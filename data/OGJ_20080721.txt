COVER
The world’s first RFID-actuated, self-powered circulating sub
represents a new direction in downhole tool design (cover). It uses
a radio frequency ID tag only 3-cm long (cover scale in mm). Canadian Natural Resources Corp. successfully ran this tool in August
2005, in the N46z well from the Ninian North platform in the
UK North Sea. Petrowell/iiiTEC designed and built the circulating
sub in Aberdeen, under license of patented technology owned by
Marathon Oil Co.This week’s special report begins on p. 37 with
an overview of RFID technology developments in the upstream oil
and gas industry. Cover images from Petrowell/iiiTEC.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Energy price hikes are two thirds of CPI’s 1% June rise Bingaman urges DOI to push lessee development
The Consumer Price Index rose 1% in June as its energy component increased sharply for a second consecutive month, the US
Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported July 16.
The energy index’s 6.6% increase on a seasonally adjusted basis
in June accounted for about two thirds of the overall increase for
all items during the month and followed a 4.4% increase in May,
it said. “The index for petroleum-based energy advanced 10%,
and the index for energy services rose 1.5%,” BLS said. The energy
index’s 29.1% increase during 2008’s first 6 months accounted
for about half of the overall total growth as energy commodity
prices climbed 34.7% and energy services prices rose 20.1%, it
indicated.
The latest CPI report to Congress came one day after the Federal
Reserve Board said steep increases in commodity prices boosted
consumer price inflation in a sluggish US economy during the first
half.
A decline in the dollar’s foreign exchange value increased import
prices, putting upward pressure on inflation, the Fed continued.

El Paso settles SEC reserve reporting charges
El Paso Corp. and five former employees settled federal charges
of inflating reported proved oil and gas reserves in violation of
federal securities antifraud laws, the US Securities and Exchange
Commission said July 11.
The five—Rodney D. Erskine, a former president of El Paso’s
exploration and production division; Randy L. Bartley, a former El
Paso E&P senior vice-president; and Steven L. Hochstein, John D.
Perry, and Bryan T. Simmons, former El Paso E&P vice-presidents—
agreed to pay fines of $40,000-$75,000 without admitting or denying the allegations.
The complaint charged that during 1998-2003, El Paso and the
employees inflated oil and gas reserves, overstated the Houston
company’s standardized measure of future cash flows, and overstated capitalized costs related to its oil and gas production.
In 2004, El Paso restated its financial statements for 1999-2002
and for the first 9 months of 2003. It reduced its previously reported total proved reserves by 2.2 tcf of natural gas equivalent for
the end of 2002; 3.3 tcfe at yearend 2002; and 3.3 tcfe at yearend
2001. It also reduced its previously reported standardized measure
of future cash flows.
The restatements reduced El Paso shareholders’ equity as of
Sept. 30, 2003, by $1.7 billion, according to SEC. Two subsidiaries,
El Paso E&P and El Paso CGP Co. LLC, also restated previously issued
financial statements to correct material overstatements of proved
oil and gas reserves, standardized measures of future cash flows,
and capitalized costs relating to oil and gas production activities,
it said.

Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and 30 other US Senate Democrats urged Interior
Secretary Dirk A. Kempthorne to act immediately to encourage development of federal oil and gas leases totaling millions of acres.
“Federal lands both onshore and on the Outer Continental Shelf
that are already leased, but not producing, are our biggest opportunity to provide needed oil and gas supply in the near term,” the
lawmakers said in a July 15 letter to Kempthorne. “We are concerned that policies of the [US Department of the Interior] do not
result in the timely production of these resources.”
The message reflected congressional Democratic sentiment
that access to additional federal acreage should not be granted to
oil and gas producers if they are not diligently developing tracts
they already have leased. US Minerals Management Service officials
and producers have said that this mandate does not recognize the
time it takes to evaluate a lease once it has been granted or capital,
equipment, and personnel constraints.
Bingaman and the other senators, including Majority Leader
Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), asked Kempthorne to immediately clarify
that oil and gas producers holding federal leases are required to
diligently develop the tracts and asked him to exercise his full authority for appropriate OCS lease term lengths and lease rates and
require lessees to regularly report their progress in diligently developing the tracts.
Recent lease sales failed to generate bids for major OCS tracts
that are already available, including about 300 million acres in the
Gulf of Mexico, the letter added.

Kazakh sulfur must be stored indoors by 2010
Kazakhstan said Chevron-led Tengizchevroil must store its openair sulfur stocks indoors by 2010. The company said it is working
on ways of storing sulfur indoors and plans to cut stocks significantly by 2017. Last year, a court imposed a 74 billion tenge fine
on Tengizchevroil but later reduced it by 50% (OGJ, Oct. 12, 2007,
p. 30).
The government reportedly also reversed another earlier decision and could try to impose export duties on Tengizchevroil
oil.
Tengizchevroil produces some 300,000 b/d of crude oil, which
accounts for 20% of Kazakhstan’s total oil production. It plans to
increase total capacity to 400,000 b/d following the first phase
expansion of 90,000 b/d, while the start-up of full facilities in
this year’s second half will further increase production capacity to
540,000 b/d (OGJ Feb. 4, 2008, Newsletter).
The Tengizchevroil partners include Chevron 50%, KazMunaiGas 20%, ExxonMobil Kazakhstan Ventures Inc. 25%, and LUKArco
5%. ✦

Brazil likely will hold two lease auctions in 2008
Brazil likely will hold two auctions for oil and gas exploration
blocks in 2008, but will exclude rights to blocks in the presalt layer
until passage of a new regulatory law.
“We are going to promote the resumption of the Eighth Round,
and also hold another auction that will involve land areas and the
fringes of the presalt area,” said Mines and Energy Minister Edison
Lobao. “An auction including the presalt area will be held only
after a new regulatory law has been passed.”
He said 15 exploratory drillings have been made in Brazil’s
presalt area, but additional wells must be drilled to determine the
area’s status.
Lobao told the state news agency that the government by early 2009 will have found a solution to the oil sector rule changes
planned for exploitation in subsalt areas.
It recently was reported that Lobao plans to propose the creation of a new state-run firm that would manage oil discoveries
made in recent months in the subsalt layer of the Santos basin (OGJ
Online, July 7, 2008).

GeoPark tests oil from Chile’s Fell block wildcat
GeoPark Holdings Ltd. discovered an oil field in Chile’s Fell block
following drilling and testing at its Aonikenk 1 exploration well.
GeoPark said a production test in the Springhill formation at
2,270 m in a 5-m perforated interval, flowed without stimulation.
GeoPark, Hamilton, Bermuda, said the rates were 1,201 b/d of
oil, 1.2 MMcfd of gas, and 1,465 b/d of water through a 12-mm
choke and with a wellhead pressure of 896 psi.
“These are preliminary results following a 6-day production
test, and further production history will be required to determine
stabilized flow rates from this well and the extent of the reservoir,”
GeoPark said.
It said 30° gravity oil is transported via trucks to a tank facility
near the Fell Block. Engineering is under way on necessary processing and sales facilities.
GeoPark said geological and geophysical interpretations suggest
opportunity for further development drilling in Aonikenk field,
and that “a new drilling location has been selected to be drilled in
fourth-quarter 2008.”
According to CEO James F. Park, “The Aonikenk oil discovery
also opens up a new potential oil region in the northeast portion of
the Fell Block, which will be further developed and explored with
additional drilling this year.”
In June, GeoPark discovered two new gas fields, with wells Nika
Oeste-3 and Bump Hill-1, on the Fell Block. The Nika Oeste-3 well
was drilled to 3,023 m TD, and at 2,960 m, produced test flows of
133,089 cu m/day of gas, 70 b/d of condensate, and 14 b/d of
water.
At a different geological structure, GeoPark’s Bump Hill-1 well was

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

drilled to 2,979 m TD. This well produced test flow rates of 25,485 cu
m/day of gas plus small quantities of condensate and water.
GeoPark said the preliminary results needed further testing to
determine stabilized flow rates and the size of the reservoir.
Last December, GeoPark reported success at the San Miguel-1
exploration well on the 440,000-acre Fell Block. The well, on a
structure defined in GeoPark’s 2006-07 3D seismic program,
gauged 3 MMcfd of gas, 65 b/d of condensate, and 35 b/d of water from Cretaceous Springhill at 3,020 m through a 10-mm choke
with 980 psi wellhead pressure (OGJ Dec. 21, 2007, p. 34).

Range boosts Marcellus shale high-grade acreage
Range Resources Corp. said it has drilled more than 100 wells
in the Marcellus shale play in the Appalachian basin, including 20
horizontal wells, and has increased its high-graded acreage position to 850,000 net acres out of 1.4 million acres total.
Previously, Range had high-graded 700,000 acres of the Marcellus. The 850,000 acres includes acquisitions expected to close
shortly.
John Pinkerton, Range’s chairman and chief executive, said
Range continues to accelerate both its drilling and acreage acquisition efforts in the Marcellus shale. Range anticipates that Marcellus
production ramp up will begin primarily in the play’s southwest
region where 60% of its high-graded acreage position lies. Pipelines and processing plants are being built.
Range has three rigs operating and plans to drill 40 horizontal
wells in 2008. Wells are being drilled, completed, tested, and shut
in awaiting pipeline construction.
Production is expected to reach 30 MMcfd in the first quarter
of 2009. The last 10 reported horizontal wells had an average peak
initial rate of 4.1 MMcfd equivalent.
Range estimates gross average reserves of 3-4 bcfe/horizontal
well. The Fort Worth independent revised upward its estimate of
the unrisked reserve potential of its leasehold position to 22 tcf
from 15 tcf.

Shell awards Oceaneering Perdido subsea works
Shell Oil Co. recently awarded a contract to Oceaneering International Inc., Houston, for fabrication and installation of subsea
equipment on Shell’s ultradeepwater Perdido Regional Development project in the Gulf of Mexico.
Engineering and fabrication are under way for 29 flowline and
well jumper spools, a pipeline tie-in sled, and related products.
Installations are scheduled to begin later this year using Oceaneering’s dynamically positioned vessels, including the Olympic Intervention IV (OI IV).
The Perdido development is 200 miles south of Freeport, Tex.,
in 7,800 ft of water. Some production wells will be in water as
deep as 10,000 ft. ✦

the Alaskan Beaufort Sea that will be able to drill wells nearly 2
miles deep and with offsets as long as 8 miles. Some planned measured depths exceed current records (OGJ, Oct. 2, 2006, p. 37).
BP will own the land-based rig and intends to use it to drill as
many as six extended-reach wells into offshore Liberty field beginning in 2010. BPXA expects oil production to begin in 2011,
ramping up to 40,000 b/d, with an ultimate recovery of 100 million bbl oil.
The construction and commissioning contract is the second
phase of Liberty field’s development. Parker anticipates that gross
margins through Phase 2 of the drilling rig project will be $14-18
million, about 1% of the overall Liberty development cost, which
BPXA anticipates to be about $1.5 billion.
Parker previously completed a 2006-07 front-end engineering
and design contract to design the rig (Phase 1) and was authorized
to procure long lead items. One of the design requirements was
the ability to drill wells out to 8.3 miles (43,824 ft). Liberty field
is nearly 6 miles offshore.
BP drilled the Liberty discovery well in 1997 from the Tern
gravel and ice island, about 20 miles east of Prudhoe Bay. The company will drill the development wells from an existing satellite pad
at its Endicott oil field. The Liberty wells will produce directly into
existing facilities.
The new rig features a state-of-the-art automated equipment
package and is designed to operate in temperatures as low as -50°
F.

Total, Inpex to spend $2 billion for Indonesian EOR
Total SA and its Japanese partner Inpex will invest, together,
some $2 billion next year to enhance recovery in the partners’ oil
and gas fields in Indonesia, both offshore and in the Mahakam
River Delta. Total has already invested $11 billion in the fields.
It will use enhanced recovery technology developed elsewhere
but not yet applied in Indonesia. The group produces 90,000 b/d
of oil and condensates and 2.6 bcfd of gas. High oil prices henceforth make it sensible to increase expenditures, especially in the
Mahakam delta, where fracturation in several layers of sand is be-

develop because of a strong carbon dioxide concentration.

Bualuang oil ﬁeld off Thailand set to produce
Soco International PLC, a partner in Bualuang field in the Gulf
of Thailand, said oil production from the field would commence
this month. Salamander Energy PLC operates the field, which was
discovered in 1993 on Block B8/38.
Thai Energy Ministry officials indicated that field output of as
much as 10,000 b/d could be expected.
The field’s proved oil reserves were recently upgraded to 11
million bbl from 7.2 million bbl, with probable and possible reserves lifted to 20 million bbl (OGJ, June 6, 2008, Newsletter).
Rubicon Vantage, the floating production, storage, and offloading vessel, was being hooked up to the wells.
Six development wells were drilled in the field, encountering
27° oil, a better-quality reservoir than forecast.
Salamander holds a 60% interest in Block B8/38, and Soco has
a 40% stake. Both companies are based in the UK.

US drilling activity stabilizes
US drilling activity remained relatively for stable the week ended July 11, with 1,922 rotary rigs working, 1 more than the previous week and up from 1,791 in the same period a year ago, said
Baker Hughes Inc.
Land drilling dipped by 4 rigs to 1,832 working the week of
July 11. That was offset by a 4-rig increase offshore, with 67 rigs
drilling in the Gulf of Mexico—currently the only activity in US
waters. Inland waters activity increased by 1 rig to 23.
Of the rigs working, the number drilling for oil dropped by
3 to 370. Units drilling for natural gas increased 5 to 1,544. The
rest were unclassified. There were 386 rigs involved in directional
drilling, down 1 from last week. There were 560 rigs drilling horizontally, 5 more than previously. ✦

ternational standards.
Work on the upgrade, valued at $2-3 billion, will begin immediately and will take up to 5 years to complete.
The Ras Lanuf facility includes a refining plant that produces
naphtha, kerosine, and light and heavy gas oil, and other units that
produce ethylene and polyethylene.
Ras Lanuf and its surrounding region have seen increased industry activity in recent months, including refining ventures and
new crude oil discoveries.

CSB cites likely cause of 2007 Valero reﬁnery ﬁre
The Feb. 16, 2007, fire at Valero Energy Corp.’s McKee Refinery
in Sunray, Tex., likely was caused by water that leaked through a
valve, froze, and cracked an out-of-service section of piping, reported the US Chemical Safety Board July 9. The refinery did not
have an adequate program to identify and protect from freezing
out-of-service or infrequently used piping, it said.
The fire occurred in the refinery’s deasphalting unit, which uses

high-pressure propane as a solvent to separate gas oil from asphalt.
Propane leaked from an ice-damaged piping elbow believed to
have been out of service since the early 1990s when Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp. owned the refinery.
The piping crack released high-pressure liquid propane that ignited, causing a massive fire that injured four workers and forced
Valero to evacuate and shut down the refinery for 2 months (OGJ
Online, Feb. 21, 2007).
Ultramar Diamond Shamrock had not identified hazards that
could arise from the dead-leg, had not removed the piping, isolated it from the process with blinds, or protected it against freezing
temperatures. Nor had officials at the McKee plant applied Valero’s
policies on emergency isolation valves to control its valves, CSB
said.
CSB has asked the American Petroleum Institute to develop a
new recommended practice to protect refinery equipment from
freezing and to improve existing practices related to fireproofing,
emergency isolation valves, and water deluge systems. ✦

Pembina completes Horizon pipeline
Pembina Pipeline Corp., Calgary, completed its $400 million
Horizon pipeline, which will provide 250,000 b/d of dedicated
transportation capacity to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.’s Horizon oil sands project. Work began in November 2006.
Construction involved laying 73 km of new pipeline following twinning in 2004 of the original Alberta Oilsands pipeline
(AOSPL—now called the Syncrude pipeline—which the company
acquired in late 2001. It expanded the AOSPL capacity to 389,000
b/d of dedicated synthetic crude oil transportation capacity to
Syncrude Canada Ltd. The following year, Pembina completed the
136,000 b/d Cheecham lateral.
Pembina spent over $600 million to expand its service offering
in the Athabasca oil sands region and now has 775,000 b/d of
fully contracted synthetic crude oil transportation capacity in three
distinct pipelines serving customers in this region.

Hungary, Romania to connect gas systems
Hungary and Romania—citing supply security issues—have
agreed to connect their natural gas systems. FGSZ Natural Gas
Transmission Co., operator of Hungary’s gas transmission system
signed a joint development agreement with Transgaz, the operator
of Romania’s gas transmission system in Arad, Romania. The interconnecting pipeline will follow the Arad-Szeged route.
FGSZ will build the 47-km Hungarian section of the gasline,
and Transgaz will lay the 67 km Romanian section, of which 36.7
km are already built.
Each side will finance its own section. For Hungary, the investment is 9 billion forints. The interconnection should become
operational in mid-2010. For the commercial operation of the
gasline, both parties intend to sign an operation agreement and a
capacity allocation agreement.
Initially, gas will be transported to Romania from Hungary. At a
later stage, if technical conditions are established, gas could be transported to Hungary from Romania. The proposed connection will help

develop gas markets in the Eastern EU and diversify supply routes,
increasing supply security for Romania and possibly Bulgaria.

Egypt starts natural gas exports to Syria
Egypt has begun sending natural gas to Syria via a pipeline that
extends through Jordan as part of a larger project to export Egyptian gas to the Middle East and, eventually, Europe.
Sufian Allaw, Syria’s oil minister, said the new line would provide his country with 88.3 MMcfd of gas, eventually rising to 212
MMcfd over the next 9 years.
Egypt has agreed to supply Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria with gas
for 30 years under terms of the $2.1 billion, 1,200-km Arab Gas
Pipeline Project, which was signed in 2001.
The first phase of the project, linking Egypt with Jordan’s Red
Sea port of Aqaba, was finished in 2003, with the pipeline passing
under the Gulf of Aqaba to avoid crossing Israeli territory.
In 2005, under the second phase of construction, the pipeline
was extended to the Jordanian town of Rihab, north of the capital
Amman.
Egypt has been exporting nearly 99 bcf/year of gas to Jordan
under a 15-year agreement.
The third phase brought the pipeline to Syria’s Deir Ali electric
power station south of Damascus, according to Allaw. Further extensions are planned to Lebanon and Turkey, where the line will be
connected to the planned Nabucco Pipeline for the delivery of gas
to Europe.

El Paso moving forward with Ruby pipeline
El Paso Corp. unit Ruby Pipeline LLC has received more than
1.1 bcfd of binding commitments from gas shippers under 10-15
year contracts and is moving forward with the project, subject to
regulatory approvals.
The 42-in. Ruby pipeline is a 670-mile interstate gas pipeline
that will extend from the Opal Hub in Wyoming to a pipeline interconnect at Malin, in southern Oregon. ✦

Message for Congress

________________

While our elected leaders on Capitol
Hill failed to acknowledge the need for
immediate and extensive exploration
efforts on both coasts and federal lands,
thoughts have come to me from my
reading of Oil & Gas Journal issues from
the last 4 years:
1. Recent advice from visiting Saudi
parliament (Majlis-e-Shura) members
could assure US lawmakers that it’s time
to drill for new oil inside the US—to
avoid additional price hikes for US
citizens. While praising the realistic view
of the Saudi Majlis members, it would
be much better to request our two top
leaders from the US House and Senate to
visit Riyadh for a crash course on energy
exploration, production, and usage in
the US.
2. Believe it or not, even US government agencies are right sometimes. Just
going through 2004 OGJ news, I found
ample and convincing predictions by
the Energy Information Administration
that (a) the world’s oil production was
declining while demand was increasing
faster due to economic growth in Asia
but that (b) pricing projections by EIA
based on International Energy Agency
data were far too low.
Now, in 2008, why is there so much
fuss about high oil prices? And why is
Congress spending so much time and
money to find the “culprits” for high
price by questioning the US oil companies repeatedly?
My message for House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid: Both of you missed the boat (not
passing smart laws encouraging energy
exploration in the US) by 4 years while
you sat on the data, creating impressions that we US oil explorers and
producers are somehow responsible for
$4/gal gasoline! If US oil production
disappeared tomorrow your respective
constituents in northern California and
southern Nevada would have to pay at
least $8/gal if not more. So please thank
us with rewards, not punish us with
proposed new super taxes.

Keeping workers safe
At the same time, however, the rate
of injuries suffered by pipeline workers
more than doubled during 2005-06,
according to the report, moving to 1.5

Still safe
Alarming as incidents such as these
and the increase in injuries seen in Canada might be, however, both the NEB and
the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
make the continued relative safety of
working in the pipeline industry explicitly clear. NEB cites statistics published by
Human Resources and Social Development Canada showing that among federally regulated industries only the banking industry suffered fewer injuries/100
hr than the pipeline industry.
A December 2007 BLS Fact Sheet
comparing pipeline injuries, illnesses,
and fatalities to all other US industries
similarly notes that in 2006 the rate
of nonfatal injuries and illnesses in
pipeline transportation was 2.2/100
full-time workers, one-half the rate for
total private industry. The rate of injuries and illnesses resulting in days away
from work for all private US industry
was 127.8 cases/10,000 workers vs.
60/10,000 in the pipeline transportation segment. Median days away from
work as a result of injury or illness were
higher for pipeline workers, 25 days
vs. 7, according to BLS figures. This is
consistent with the scale of the overall
endeavor.
These statistics and others like them
make it clear that pipeline operators
and contractors continue to do a very
good job maintaining a safe workplace.
The recent upturn in Canadian pipeline worker injuries reported by the
NEB, however, should serve to warn
that there is a need to redouble efforts
during this time of spectacular pipeline
growth. ✦

Learning to cooperate
An important development in the geopolitics
of oil has largely escaped notice where it should
be big news: in the US. Oil-exporting countries
for many years have been calling for cooperation
between themselves and major importers. Progress
is evident. But little has been said about it in the
world’s largest energy consumer.
Traditional arguments against cooperation,
most of them based on righteous allegiance to
market ideology, are losing their bite. Governments own most of the world’s oil reserves.
National oil companies compete for investment
opportunities, in their home countries and abroad,
from positions of growing strength and sophistication. Private and political interests thus intertwine as never before. While market forces always
prevail, many governments have new financial
power with which to press their energy ambitions—and diminishing reluctance to use it.

such as refining capacity, the effects of financial
markets on oil prices, technology, the effects of biofuels on refining, and carbon capture and storage.
Also in June, international leaders—including US
Energy Sec. Samuel Bodman—met in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, under the auspices of the International Energy Agency, International Energy Forum, and OPEC
to discuss the recent surge in oil prices. In a statement after the meeting, participants “recognized
the importance” of spare upstream and downstream
capacities; transparency and regulation of financial
markets; the Joint Oil Data Initiative; cooperation
between OPEC, the IEA, and IEF in reporting and
analyzing oil market developments; aid to leastdeveloped countries; cooperation in investment,
technology, and human resource development; and
promotion of energy efficiency.
It’s easy to dismiss these efforts as the endless
meetings and hollow words of international diplomacy, from which little concrete results are likely.

In May, the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) published
the “EITI Business Guide” to encourage
oil and gas companies, as well as companies in other extractive industries, to
support implementation of the EITI in
countries that are developing or operating oil and gas assets.1
The purpose of the EITI is to publish
government revenues generated by extractive industries and to compare those
revenues with payments reported by
private companies in order to improve
transparency in countries rich in oil,
gas, and mineral resources. It is hoped
that making this data public will allow
in-country civil society organizations to
hold their governments accountable for
any discrepancies, which in turn should
minimize corruption in the countries
that adopt the EITI.
Although no country is required to
participate in the EITI, once a country adopts the transparency initiative,

Of these, 16 are in Africa: Cameroon, Congo, Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Cote D’Ivoire, Equatorial
Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia,
Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Niger,
Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, and
Sierra Leone. The remaining countries
are Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Mongolia, Peru, Timor-Leste, and Yemen
(see map).
In many of these countries, adoption
of the EITI is at its initial stages. Active
involvement by oil and gas companies
in the implementation of the EITI thus
may help to decrease the risk of possible liability that can attach to oil and
gas companies required to participate
in the in-country programs. Although
participation in the EITI creates neither
legal rights nor obligations, because
EITI requirements might result in companies’ publicly revealing their payment

hopes to prevent corrupt governments
from skimming income off the top of
these revenues for their own personal
gains. However, if a discrepancy is identified, the companies making the payments, not just the countries receiving
them, may come under legal scrutiny.
As stated in the EITI Business Guide,
“[T]here is no international EITI policy
or requirement” on how data on country revenue streams and on company
payment streams reported to the independent administrator is to be published. Revenue and payment reporting
may be published on an aggregated or
disaggregated basis. Aggregated disclosure requires publication of a single
number for each benefit stream, while
disaggregated disclosure calls for publication of the overall number broken
down by company. Whether a country
chooses to publish its data on an aggregated or disaggregated basis ultimately
may affect the particular areas of legal
liability to which a company is exposed.

companies also should consider how to
minimize their FCPA exposure during
participation in the EITI. The FCPA consists of two sets of provisions:
• Antibribery provisions under 15
USC § 78dd-1(a), which prohibit payment of anything of value to a foreign
official for purposes of securing business.
• Accounting provisions in 15 USC
§ 78m(b), which require companies to
maintain certain recordkeeping standards and internal accounting controls

concurrent bribery investigations by

For example, Shell Oil currently is
under investigation by the DOJ and
the SEC for its operations in Nigeria,
a country that has adopted and implemented the EITI. US investigators are
also collaborating with the Economic
and Financial Crimes Commission
in Nigeria in that investigation. The
investigation focuses on Shell Oil’s use
of Panalpina, a Swiss freight firm that
came under scrutiny in connection with
Vetco Gray’s self-disclosed FCPA issue,
which settled in February 2007.
The investigation of Shell Oil is
just the latest in a string of FCPA
investigations in Nigeria. There is no
evidence that the EITI triggered this
series of investigations; the Panalpina
investigations were most likely triggered by Vetco Gray’s self-reporting of
FCPA problems relating to bribes paid

However, payment discrepancies could
increase FCPA scrutiny of certain companies or certain countries.
Nigeria was the first country to sign
up for the EITI, and the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(NEITI) is a recognized leader in implementing EITI objectives. The NEITI calls
for the publication, on a disaggregated
basis, of “any information concerning
the revenue of the Federal Government from [all] extractive industry
companies, as it may consider necessary.” As such, in the audit report for
1999-2004, published in late 2006, the
NEITI not only reported that there was
a net difference of $7.9 million between payments reported by the extractive industry and revenues reported by
the Nigerian government but also broke
down the discrepancies by company. In
particular, Shell failed to report $1.35
million that the Nigerian government
reported it received. In addition to this

companies and revenues received by the
government, to enhance transparency,

President George W. Bush’s July 14
cancellation of an executive order banning oil and gas leasing on 85% of the
Outer Continental Shelf.
“It is now up to Congress to lift
the moratoriums,” said the American
Petroleum Institute in a statement.
“Doing so could boost US supplies of
oil and natural gas, increase the nation’s energy security, add additional,
well-paying American jobs, and bring
billions of dollars into the Treasury.
We encourage Congress to pass a
common-sense and effective long-term
energy policy.”
Independent Petroleum Association
of America Pres. Barry Russell commented, “Congress can no longer
look the other way on this issue. If we
don’t take the necessary steps today,
America will be in a worse position
tomorrow.”
Conceding that exploring in areas
currently off limits won’t produce oil
and gas in the near term, Russell urged
adoption of a comprehensive longterm energy policy that would include
conservation, efﬁciency, unconventional fuels, “and all forms of American
energy, including additional oil and gas
resources, for the future.”
“While it is true that exploration in
areas that are currently off limits will
not produce oil and natural gas in the
short term, America must endorse solutions today that will produce results
tomorrow, Russell said.
R. Skip Horvath, president of the
Natural Gas Supply Association, said,

and had not waited until the waning
days of his presidency. Congress should
respond by strategically lifting the congressional moratoriums, and providing
the option to states to expand drilling off

“This is a smart decision because natural gas from US shores will add to our
security of supply. Natural gas is essential to maintaining a high standard
of living.
“Americans have ﬂooded Congress
and the White House with their calls
and letters on high energy prices,
and recent polls indicate that more
than 70% favor increased drilling. The
people have spoken, the president has
acted, and we hope the House and Senate are listening,” Horvath said.

A strong signal
Tom Fry, president of the National
Ocean Industries Association, said,
“While the president’s move will
not solve all of the nation’s energy
challenges, it sends a strong signal
to Congress that it is time to end the
annual congressional moratoriums. We
are the only nation in the world that
consistently limits access to our own
domestic resources, despite a long
record of safe and environmentally
responsible exploration and production of offshore oil and gas. In light of
rapidly growing global demand for hydrocarbons, and the resulting negative
impacts on the American economy and
overall quality of life, the locking up of
US energy resources makes absolutely
no sense.”
American Gas Association Pres.
David N. Parker said, “Because natural
gas helps reduce emissions, environmentally conscious Americans are demanding more and more of it to power
their homes and ofﬁces. Removing the
ban on offshore production would go
a long way in meeting the American
consumer’s increasing demand for this

their shores,” she continued.
But many Democrats did condemn
it. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said
that Bush’s move was “a false promise
on which he can’t deliver. The fact is this:

clean-burning energy source, as well as
our nation’s long-term climate-change
goals. We are pleased that President
Bush understands both the economic
and environmental beneﬁts of expanding natural gas production, and we
hope that Congress will follow his
lead,” Parker said.
American Chemistry Council Pres.
Jack N. Gerard commented, “Clearly,
the ground is shifting on energy policy.
As the crisis has grown, as it has
become clear to Americans that the
United States is jeopardizing our own
economy and our ability to compete
globally by not moving forward with
expanded domestic energy development, and as poll after poll have shown
that more than two thirds of Americans
support it, we’ve seen growing interest
in this issue among lawmakers of both
parties,” Gerard said. “We strongly
encourage the House and Senate to
continue exploring comprehensive
energy legislation that includes efﬁciency; diversity, including renewables
and other lower-emission sources and
technologies; and expanded domestic
energy supply.”
National Association of Manufacturers Executive Vice-Pres. Jay Timmons
said, “This country is facing an energy
crisis. It is imperative that every opportunity to reduce the cost of energy
be taken. An appropriate place to start
is by increasing our access to domestic
resources.”
Citing estimates that the OCS contains more than 420 tcf of gas and 86
billion bbl of oil, Timmons said that
providing access to these resources
would send a signal to the rest of the
world that the US is serious about
reducing the energy price burden that
confronts American consumers and
manufacturers.

The president is deluding the public into
believing that new offshore drilling is
a quick fix to $4/gal gasoline. Nothing
could be further from the truth. We cannot drill our way out of this problem.”

Another OCS leasing opponent,
Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), said that
the president “cruelly is misleading
Americans for attempted political gain.
He knows ruining our coastlines won’t
bring down gasoline prices nor solve
our energy challenges. In fact, a recent
report from inside his administration’s
own energy office found that increasing offshore drilling will have no
impact on [gasoline] prices.”

‘Lands with a plop’
Republicans clearly relished the
change. “A ban on drilling in the same
Gulf that’s open to Venezuelans, Indians, Vietnamese, and Cubans never
made much sense except as a political
barricade erected by anti-oil environmentalists in and out of Congress. Now
that the president is voiding the old
executive order, the issue lands with
a plop on Nancy Pelosi and [Senate
Majority Leader] Harry Reid’s collective
lap. I hope they can figure out a way not
to automatically talk themselves into a
frenzy of opposition that prevents real
action to lower gasoline prices,” said
Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), the Energy
and Commerce Committee’s ranking
minority member.
Rep. John E. Peterson (R-Pa.), who
has introduced several bills to repeal
congressionally imposed OCS leasing
moratoriums, said that Bush’s action
eliminated one of many hurdles. “Make
no mistake: The price at the pump and
sky-high natural gas prices are the result
of 27 years of failed Washington policies.
The politics of fear, implored by 14 consecutive Congresses and three presidents
at the behest of radical environmental
groups like Greenpeace, Sierra Club, and
the Center for Biological Diversity are
the reasons Americans are paying record
prices for energy,” he declared.
Bush’s move followed a week of
actions by congressional Democrats
that suggest they are feeling growing
pressure from constituents to increase
domestic oil and gas production.
Soon after Congress returned July
7 from its Independence Day recess,
Pelosi urged Bush to release crude oil

Soon after Democrats regained

he said.

The situation has improved recently, Melancon continued. “We’ve

“The leadership is always seeking

Frankly, when the Republicans were

Melancon said, “It’s a complex

IEA rolls out 2009 supply and demand forecast
Marilyn Radler
Senior Editor-Economics
The International Energy Agency has
released its outlook for 2009 oil supply
and demand.
In its latest monthly Oil Market
Report, IEA said worldwide oil demand
will increase by 860,000 b/d next year
to average 87.7 million b/d. This year’s
demand growth is forecast at 890,000
b/d.
OECD oil product demand will average 48 million b/d in 2009, down 1.2%
from 2008, as rising oil prices continue
to take their toll.
The contraction in demand is
expected to be particularly marked
in North America, down 380,000 b/d,
while demand in both Europe and the

impacts on the amount of oil needed
from OPEC. Scenarios show that they
could reduce the call on OPEC oil by
close to 4 million b/d by 2020, according to the report.
Additional policy measures would
further increase the uncertainty over
the amount of OPEC oil the market will
require by 2020. With a 9 million b/d
spread, OPEC places its then-call for oil
at 29-38 million b/d. This translates
into what the report calls an uncertainty
gap of upstream investment needs in
OPEC-member countries of over $300
billion.

Downstream demands
OPEC’s reference case estimates that
by 2015, global refining crude distillation capacity will grow 7.6 million
b/d. Adding in the effect of capacity creep, crude distillation capacity
could increase 8.8 million b/d from
2007 capacity.
While crude distillation unit additions
by 2015 look sufficient in the reference
case, those for secondary processing
units are not, OPEC warns, saying further

Paciﬁc falls by roughly 100,000 b/d
each.
But growth will be robust in developing economies, IEA said, as 1.4
million b/d of annual growth is expected to match that of 2008. Sustained
economic growth in the key regions
of Asia, the Middle East, and Latin
America will drive most of the increase
in demand.
The Paris-based agency sees supply
from countries outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
rising 640,000 b/d to 50.6 million b/d
in 2009, following a late-2008 increase,
with oil production in Asia, the Caspian, Brazil, Canada, and the US adding
to supplies.
Ongoing decline affects supply from
the North Sea, Mexico, and non-OPEC

Middle East, while Russian production
also slips in 2009. Much of a previously expected 2008 surge in OPEC gas
liquids has been pushed back into 2009
on project delays. So natural gas liquids production in Saudi Arabia, Qatar,
the UAE, Nigeria, and Iran will support
an 810,000 b/d expansion in OPEC gas
liquids next year.
Looking at recent production levels,
IEA said that last month OPEC crude
supply increased 350,000 b/d to 32.4
million b/d, as Saudi Arabian supply
rose to 9.45 million b/d, and exports
from ﬂoating storage lifted Iranian supply to 3.8 million b/d.
Although higher supply lowers effective OPEC spare production capacity to
1.7 million b/d, increases from Saudi
Arabia, Angola, Iraq, and Nigeria will
lift overall capacity by around 1 million
b/d by end-2008, IEA reported.

additions are needed, especially for hydrocracking and desulfurization.
In particular, the gap between supply and demand for middle distillates
will grow, unless more diesel-oriented
projects are implemented. This evolving
gap likely will drive price differentials
towards a premium for diesel and could
also have an impact on the absolute
level of product and crude prices, according to the WOO.
Another major driver of refining
requirements and economics is the level
and quality of product demand, OPEC
says, particularly the move toward distillates. Especially notable are diesel and

low and ultralow-sulfur fuels as OECD
regions complete their conversions to
these fuels and non-OECD countries
increasingly adopt these standards.
To meet product demand in 2030,
OPEC says a total of almost 20 million
b/d of additional distillation capacity
will be required, compared with current capacity, with substantial investments needed in all regions.
WOO estimates that the total investment in refinery processing to 2015
will be more than $320 billion in 2007
dollars in the reference case, while for
the entire forecast period to 2030 the
figure is close to $800 billion. ✦

EPA proposes rules covering carbon dioxide storage
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
The US Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) released proposals July
15 for a category of injection wells for
long-term underground carbon dioxide
storage as Congress contemplates carbon
capture and storage (CCS) technology.
The proposed rules, which outline
storage siting, testing, and monitoring
requirements, fall under EPA’s existing
Underground Injection Control (UIC)
program. They would update the 1974
Safe Drinking Water Act.
EPA hopes to ensure that stored CO2
does not move or leach heavy metals or
other contaminants out of surrounding
rock into underground water.
Benjamin Grumbles, EPA assistant
administrator for water, said a final rule
is expected in late 2010-early 2011.

Rules already exist for CO2 injected
for enhanced oil recovery projects.
Grumbles said the new rules represent
the first federal regulations for longterm CO2 storage.
EPA will accept public comment on the
Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
for 120 days following its publication.
CCS, not yet available on a large-scale
commercial basis, would contain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power
plants and other industrial sources.

water sources. LBNL also assesses potential changes in regional groundwater
flow, including displacement of preexisting saline water or hydrocarbons.
Grumbles said EPA tracks the progress
of national and international sequestration projects, including DOE’s Regional
Carbon Sequestration Partnerships.
Under the UIC program, experimental technology permits have been issued
for CO2 injection wells drilled by the
partnerships, Grumbles said.

API: US exploratory
drilling up over
50% in 2Q
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Oil and gas producers drilled over
50% more US exploratory wells in
second-quarter 2008 than a year earlier,
reported the American Petroleum Institute in its latest quarterly estimate of
domestic well completions.
Exploratory wells, which accounted
for nearly 17% of total wells drilled,
grew 53% year-to-year, it said. Oil well
completions rose 49%, while gas well
completions jumped 99% from their
level in 2007’s second quarter, API said.
API said an estimated 14,289 oil
wells, gas wells, and dry holes were
drilled domestically during the 3
months ended June 30—8% more than
a year earlier.
A resurgence of US oil well completions that began in 2000 has continued.
An estimated 5,219 wells were drilled
during second-quarter 2008, 17% more
than in the comparable 2007 period
and the highest second quarter estimated oil activity since 1986, API said.
Gas remains the primary domestic
drilling target, with an estimated 7,561
wells completed during the 2008 second
quarter, a level 3% higher year-to-year and
more than double the level 10 years ago.
API also reported that total estimated
footage drilled this past quarter reached
89,947,000 ft, 14% higher than a year
earlier and the greatest second-quarter
footage drilled ever. ✦

business at all.
Boeing executives are genuinely

In extreme weather, damage to
offshore facilities is unavoidable and
can take many forms. To better understand the scope of weather risk and
catastrophic loss in the Gulf of Mexico,
and the factors that impact the redevelopment decisions of operators, we
quantify the value of lost production
associated with the 2004-05 hurricane seasons under various price and
model scenarios.
We estimate that
the value of lost
production from
the 2004-2005
hurricane seasons
range between
$1.3 billion to $4.5
billion, depending upon the scenario
assumptions employed. For a future
average oil and gas price of $100/bbl
and $10/Mcf, the total lost production is estimated to be $3.7 billion. We
perform sensitivity analysis, describe
the maximum redevelopment cost per
structure that will yield a specific rate

Value of lost production

The decision to repair, replace,
or abandon damaged and destroyed
infrastructure is determined by several
factors. The return on investment that
an owner would expect to receive depends upon the cost to fabricate/install
a new platform, subsea assembly and/
or pipeline interconnection/tieback,
as well as the cost of removing/repairing the destroyed/damaged structure,
plug and abandonment cost, and the
cost to renter/redrill wells. All of these
costs are weighed against the potential
revenue expressed through the remaining reserves, expected future prices,
operating cost and strategic considerations. If the estimated value of future
production is less than the expected
cleanup and redevelopment cost, then
the decision to redevelop the field will
either be postponed or not undertaken.

Lost production and valuation
For each destroyed structure, we
forecast future production and abandonment according to the model specification described in Part 2. Production
is valued at a constant oil and gas price
across the life cycle of each asset under
five scenarios. We break out the production forecast and valuation for structures that yielded an acceptable initial
model fit—normal producers (Table
1); structures with less than 7 years
production history—young producers
(Table 2); and structures that required
additional processing to yield an acceptable decline model—chaotic producers
(Table 3). Model results for all three
categories are subject to uncertainty,
but the later two asset classes—and
especially young producers—are considerably more uncertain than normal
producers. The aggregate forecast and
valuation is summarized in Table 4.
For the normal producer class, the

an interested buyer for the property.
We do not attempt to estimate cleanup and redevelopment cost for the hurricane destroyed structures, since these
are site-specific, require specialized
knowledge to perform, and are subject
to significant uncertainty. Instead, we
focus on the potential value of the lost
production, since this is more accessible
and can be estimated with reasonable
certainty. Estimating the value of lost
production provides an upper bound
for the amount of money an owner
would be willing to spend to redevelop
an asset on a stand-alone basis.

amount of lost production is reasonably
sensitive to the price deck (Table 1),
while for the early and chaotic producers, the variation in production output
is less sensitive (Tables 2, 3). The likely
explanation for this is due to the nature
of the models employed in Table 1
(which includes exponential, harmonic,
and hyperbolic curves), relative to the
assumed (exponential) decline forms

employed in Tables 2 and 3. Most of the
value of future production is contained
with the early producers, both by virtue
of their higher production rates and
longer anticipated production cycles.
It is interesting to note that across all
producing structures, the amount of
lost production is only slightly sensitive
to the price deck, while the valuation
estimates are highly sensitive. This is

the allowable capital expenditures will
necessarily decrease. As the price deck
increases, the revenue from production
will increase, and with it the total expenditures that can be spent to achieve
a given return. Thus, as we proceed
down a given column, the maximum
allowed investments increase, and as we
proceed across a given row, the maximum allowable investment decreases.

Average redevelopment costs provide
insight into the cost equation facing
operators. Consider an operator with
price deck P(III) = {Po = $80/bbl, Pg
= $8/Mcf} and a desired IRR of 15%.
An “average” gulf operator could spend
$11.4-24.3 million to achieve a 15%
return, while an operator with a young
producer could spend as much as $93.1
million on redevelopment and cleanup.
An operator that required a 25% return
would have a more constrained capital
budget, ranging from $8.2-18.3 million (for normal/chaotic producers) to
$66.5 million (for young producers).
Structures early in their production
cycle, by virtue of their reserves potential and expected number of years of remaining production, can spend significantly more capital for redevelopment.
The results in Table 6 represent average
cost but can, of course, be specialized to
individual assets.

primarily due to the mature nature of
the producing properties—a high price
deck may delay the economic limit,
but does not play a significant role in
contributing to additional quantities of
production because of the high fixed
cost associated with offshore operations. In Table 2, as decline rates increase, production drops more quickly,
decreasing the reserves estimates.

Rate of return calculation
The aggregate present value of each
structure’s cash flow stream for each
price deck is shown in Table 5 under
variable discount rates, extending the
valuation estimates provided in Tables
1-4. The values represent the maximum
capital investment in total that owners would be able to spend to provide
a specified return. For a given price
deck, as the rate of return increases,

Sensitivity analysis
There are many uncertain factors
in production and valuation estimation that are not directly amenable to
analysis. Commodity price level was
considered explicitly by using price
deck scenarios, and for early producers,
we illustrated the impact of changes
in the assumed decline rate (Table 2).
Additional parameters that impact the
cumulative production and valuation
estimate is the threshold used to determine when production will no longer
be commercial and the discount factor
used in the cash flow analysis. We vary

Model limitations and constraints
Production data are extracted from
public domain sources, and so it is not
possible to fully identify those factors
which make each property unique.
We are thus limited in our ability to
understand why structures produce in
a particular way without detailed, sitespeciﬁc information.
Our ability to infer production trends
from curve ﬁtting exercises is similarly
limited, and hence our results are only
indicative of general trends, and should
only be interpreted in this manner.

Inventory may change
We only considered those structures
that were destroyed in the 2004 and
2005 hurricane seasons. An additional
76 structures were severely damaged,
and some of these may not return to
producing status.
Conversely, early producers and
those structures with a sufﬁcient
amount of remaining reserves may be
redeveloped in the future, which would
subsequently reduce the quantity and
value of “lost” production reported.
We assumed that all idle structures
will not return to producing status. This
is believed to be a reasonably good
assumption, but we recognize that in
special cases some idle structures may
have returned to production status if
they were not destroyed.
The impact of damaged or destroyed
infrastructure that served as an active
conduit, link, or hub for other producing structures was not assessed.

Stable conditions
Decline curve analysis is an empirical technique that relates production
data with one or more attributes, such
as time, cumulative production, reservoir pressure, etc. Empirical equations
ﬁt data to assumed model forms, and
do not include most of the factors that
affect past, present, or future performance.
Extrapolating the results of an
empirically-derived equation to the
future assumes that all the factors affecting performance in the past have
exactly the same cumulative effect
in the future. This is a strong, and
certainly, questionable assumption. The
use of decline curves necessitates assumptions regarding operating policy,
ﬁeld investment, mechanical problems,
marketing issues, and the occurrence
of exogenous events.
The collective set of all these conditions are assumed constant for all future time and are referred to as “stable
reservoir and investment conditions.”
Changes to any of the above-named
factors have the potential to dramatically change both the production rate
and reserves, which will impact the
forecast results.

Decline curve reliability?
The production rate of a well, group
of wells, structure, lease, ﬁeld, or other
aggregation unit can be ﬁt to any functional form or curve type. The function
may ﬁt the observed data so well that
the user may consider it to be an accurate and reliable predictor of the future.
Such a conclusion would, of course,
be a serious mistake, since many other
factors that we cannot control or direct-

the economic limit and the discount
rate across all structures to determine
the degree to which changes in these
factors impact the model output.
The change in cumulative oil, gas,
and barrels of oil equivalent production
across five price scenarios as a function
of changes in the threshold level are de-

picted in Figs. 1 and 2. In these illustrations, the economic limit τa(s) is multiplied by the factor k, k ≥0, and as the
value of k increases, k·τa will increase,
causing the economic limit to occur at
an earlier time, reducing cumulative
production and valuation estimates. The

ly account for will impact production
levels. The ability to forecast is severely
restricted by conditions that are both
unobservable and unpredictable.

Stage of production
The stage of production of an asset
is often used as a rough indication of
the amount of uncertainty that can be
expected in forecast models, but such
indicators are often ambiguous and
should be used with caution. Early in
the life of a ﬁeld, little is known about
the extent, quality, and drive mechanisms of the reservoir, and at this time,
reserves estimates and production
forecasting is the most uncertain.
As a ﬁeld is developed and production performance accumulates,
the range of error often decreases,
assuming no change in investment
strategy. For mature assets, forecasting
is considered less uncertain because
a smaller number of factors inﬂuence
production and dwindling remaining
reserves are likely to be irreversible.
“Less uncertain” is not certainty,
however, and there is still a large degree of unpredictability that can occur
near the end of the life cycle of production. Offshore production has different
economic characteristics than onshore
production, where ﬁxed costs are
smaller and production proﬁles tend to
decline at smoother rates.
In offshore operations, production
levels tend to be chaotic throughout
the life of the ﬁeld, and smoothly declining proﬁles near the end of production are not common, exacerbating the
difﬁculty associated with forecasting
abandonment timing.

greatest change in cumulative production occurs at low price decks.
The sensitivity of the present value
to changes in the discount rate is shown
in Fig. 3 for the price deck P(I) and in
Fig. 4 for the price deck P(III). As k and
D increase, present value decreases. Similar figures can be broken out for each

Many different industries use radio frequency
identification (RFID)
technology, but it is a late
arrival in the oil field.
Drilling
RFID systems have been
incorporated into seismic
acquisition systems since the 1990s,
but there has been surprisingly little use
of this rapidly evolving technology in
drilling and production.
RFID systems are wireless and
include tags, readers, antennas, and an
associated computer network. RFID tags
are either passive (no battery) or active
(battery-powered). RFID readers must
interface with the tags and with the
business network.
RFID tags are made of many different materials, are embedded within or
attached to components, and can be
used for identification, tracking, quality
control, or monitoring ambient conditions, alone or in combination with
other sensors.
RFID technology allows remote
retrieval of information from sensors.
It does not require a line-of-sight view
and the process can be automated. Tag
reading is quick and tags can be rewritten and reused.1 Tags can store a variety
of information, differentiating them
from simple barcode systems.
There are applications in manufacturing, supply chain, and field operations:1
• Casing and drill pipe quality control and traceability.
• Zonal isolation valve actuation.
• Perforating gun actuation.
• Geospatial fencing (derrick floor,
manufacturing yard, refinery).
• Sensor networks (derrick floor,
manufacturing, refining, transportation).
• Supply chain visibility (procurement, across-production, transportation).
In the last several years, operators
have tested land and offshore RFID applications, and recently, RFID material
tolerance to 12,000-ft subsea.2

Slow implementation?
Many innovative oil field technologies are first implemented offshore,
where incremental improvements in
safety and efficiency often have immediate economic payouts, or meet a
pressing regulatory need or company
mandate. As components become more
commonplace, economies of scale in
their manufacture often make the components more affordable
for land operations.
New technologies need
to be easy to use, capable
of surviving extreme working conditions (downhole,
subsea), cannot interfere
with operations, and ultimately, prove cost-effective.
Possible reasons for slow implementation of RFIDs in the oil and gas
industry are:
• Inconsistent readability. An RFID
tag’s placement and ambient environment affects its readability. Metal
surfaces interfere with radio signals

(detuning); early systems did not always account for this. Newer, successful
systems are limited to certain frequencies (e.g. UHF metal-tuned tags).1 Using
tags under water can be problematic because liquids absorb radio-wave energy
and decrease read range.
• The return on investment that is
not immediately quantifiable.

Mixing RFID and oil creates competitive advantage
Ben Zoghi
Texas A&M University
College Station,Tex.
The RFID Oil & Gas Solution Group,
a consortium of industry and universities based in Texas, offers research,
study, and pilot deployment services
to help improve automation, identify
and control equipment, assets, tools,
and related processes used in the oil
and gas and petrochemical industries.
The consortium is organized to help
industry analyze how RFID is best deployed to improve visibility and control
of assets, equipment, spares, tools,
vehicles, and manpower.
RFID technology has a proven track
record in many vertical industries,
including retail, pharmaceutical, medical, automotive, and security. These
industries have a problem in common
with the oil and gas sector: asset track-

ing. A special challenge in oil and gas
is that some assets are hard to tag and
even harder to track because of their
size and geographic placement.
RFID is a technology that can
provide the right product at the right
place at the right time. In addition to
asset tracking, RFID has the potential
to improve efﬁciency and visibility, cut
costs, prevent theft and counterfeiting,
monitor efﬁcient maintenance scheduling, manage assets, increase security,
monitor environmental conditions
for health and safety, and maximize
productivity with just-in-time spare
replacement, while reducing downtime.

Framework
The core of the system is built
around RFID tags (transponders), RFID
readers, host computer, and software.
Each tag sends its data periodically
via a radio signal to RFID readers. The

transmitters can be placed anywhere
that movement-tracking adds value to
the commercial process.
An RFID reader cross-references the
tag’s data within the reader’s database.
After the reader receives new data, it
sends the data to the host. The readers and the host communicate through
a secure wireless link. RFID links the
physical world to the digital world without any human interaction. Whatever
actions are then triggered will depend
on the individual application.
RFID is best viewed as part of a
broader spectrum of sensor-based
technologies, such as barcodes and
magnetic striping, as well as integration with sensors for such things as
temperature, position, vibration, and
moisture. RFID capability must be part
of a comprehensive technology and
applications infrastructure that can
collect events from disparate sources,
combine the data into composite transactions, and then automatically trigger
the appropriate business process.

The battery boosts transmission
power and allows active tags to be read
from greater distances, hundreds to
thousands of feet away. Active RFID tags
cost $20-100.1

Deep sea test

RFID technology is at the heart of rapid mustering systems
used during safety drills or incidents, as shown here on
a Statoil platform in the North Sea (photo from Salem
Automation Ltd., Fig. 1).

The cost of RFID tags is based on the
read range and storage capacity. Passive
tags have a read range up to 40 ft, typically contain 128 bit, and up to 1,024
38

bit data, and cost $0.05-$5.00, making
them both cheap and disposable. Active
tags contain batteries and can store
megabytes of information.

Houston-based Wescorp Energy Inc.
recently announced the results of the
first test deployment of RFID tags to
12,000 ft in the Gulf of Mexico.2
Working with two US-based engineering companies, Wescorp specially
designed, passive, UHF, EPC Gen 2 RFID
tags sealed in medical-grade plastic casings, pretested them to 8,000 psi, and
attached them to precision sonobuoys.
The sonobuoys were sent to the bottom
of the gulf, 12,000 ft subsea, and stayed
submerged for 4 months while linked
to floating radio transmitters.
Wescorp read the tags with a
handheld Motorola RFID interrogator
before and after the deployment. Scott

Special Report

There is no doubt that RFID technology presents massive potential for creating competitive advantage. Oil and
gas companies will ﬁnd that incorporating these technologies into their information infrastructure and integrating
them into their business processes will
provide substantial business beneﬁts.
RFID is being used throughout the
distribution network from managing
trucks down to actual shipments. RFID
is being used to track the movement
of trucks to ensure optimum use of
expensive capital and labor. Key assets
are being tagged and tracked throughout the entire oil and gas distribution supply chain. RFID is also well
suited for tagging parts that have to be
maintained to predetermined routines.
Many ﬂeet operators are turning to
RFID to make sure such repairs and
maintenance are done on schedule but
only when required or speciﬁed.

Roadmap
The next step is to develop a roadmap

for RFID implementation. This should
include RFID pilot projects, which allow
companies to capture and analyze data
out of the box, test new devices and
ﬁlters, and perform custom, advanced
data analysis. After the pilot project,
operators should be ready to integrate
with existing enterprise systems and
deploy RFID in the ﬁeld.
From there, the next move is to develop RFID-enabled applications and
integrate RFID data into existing applications.
There are several current uses of
RFID in the oil and gas industry:
• During the assembly of pipe
joints, RFID is proving to be a more
reliable way of ensuring the right
parts and torque pressures are used,
rather than the traditional although bar
code system. RFID tags can withstand
harsh conditions and remain operable
long after bar codes would have been
washed or worn away.
• Reﬁnery operators continually look
for ways to ensure that their processes
meet safety and audit requirements.

RFID can assist reﬁnery operators to
identify key inspection points and
provide the audit trail required to meet
audit standards.
• RFID sensors can monitor machines and equipment to detect
possible problems and deliver safety
features in wells.
RFID technology can also be used
to ensure the safe transit of materials, from tracking transfers between
authorized handlers, to limiting entry of
personnel to speciﬁc locations.

manufactures various metal piping
products, such as pipe shoes, pipe
hangers, expansion joints, slide plates,
etc. for the oil and gas industry. The
Houston-based company, in business
since 1975, planned to purchase RFID
tags to attach to these metal products
shipped to their clients’ construction
sites. Because the tags would be used
in an industrial setting, they needed to
be weather resistant and survive harsh
environments. In addition, they have to
function with large amounts of metal
structure surrounding the products.
The tags needed to have a long readrange so they could be effectively
read when 100 ft above ground, for
example.

company use to fulﬁll their operational
requirements? The RFID and Sensor
Research Laboratory at the Industrial
Engineering Department, University
of Houston, was asked to answer this
critical question.
The company had two RFID operational requirements:
1) To track inventory in pallets when

laboratory of the University of Houston’s

products are shipped to customers.
2) To track individual products attached with RFID tags to be stored and
located at various areas of a construction site for installation or part replacement.

Testing
We used two types of RFID tags,
passive and active, for testing the two
requirements: pallet-level tracking
(Fig. 1); and item-level tracking. We
conducted the tests at University of
Houston’s mockup RFID lab as well as
at the company’s manufacturing ﬂoor.
In addition, the tests of ﬁeld movement
tracking and monitoring of individual
products with RFID tags attached were
also conducted at a customer’s construction site.
After conducting several tests with
different piping products and at various
locations, we concluded that:
1. Passive RFID tags with foam back-

fairleads that handle streamers
as they are deployed over the
stern. The RFID antennas were
designed to be small and nonintrusive and are built directly
into the fairlead. As each tag
passes through the fairlead, the
antenna energizes the tag and it
responds with the unique serial
number of the section.

ing work extremely well for metallic
products. Although a 100% reading
rate was achieved, the reading range
is only about 10-15 ft, which therefore
limit its application only to short range
reading application, such as pallet level
tracking.
2. Active RFID tags work well in
harsh environments. The reading range
is 100–300 ft depending on product
memory size and vendor. In addition to
the fast reading speed, data in transit
can also be stored on the tag, and uploaded to a computer server whenever
a wireless communication is available
and established. Active RFID tags are
more applicable for long-range reading
applications, such as item level tracking
(both on the ground and above the
ground), ﬁeld movement tracking and
monitoring of individual product.

Opportunities
Throughout the study of this RFID
application, we identiﬁed many constraints and opportunities. The ﬁrst

requirement is to ﬁnd a proper location
to install and house an RFID reader.
While any RFID tag can be enclosed
with a temperature and moisture-proof
casing, an RFID reader is harder to protect from heavy rain and hot weather.
The second requirement is the need
to handle millions of data points from
RFID tags. Hundreds or even thousands of products must be tracked,
monitored, and managed. Advanced
technology, such as real-time data
synchronization and a fusion engine
under development at the University of
Houston, will be a possible solution.
Many ﬁeld operators expressed the
desire to incorporate a GPS chip into
an active RFID tag. Although the cost
factor might currently prevent this
product enhancement to be widely
adopted, the time will come when GPS
chips become a commodity and then
this advanced feature will be integrated
into RFID tags.
Another opportunity identiﬁed

during the study is to use Wi-Fi (IEEE
802.11)-based RFID tags, instead of
regular active RFID tags, for item level
tracking. Any 802.11-compatible wireless access point or router used for
regular PCs with proper adapter can
also be used to read this type of RFID
tag. A typical outdoor 802.11n-series
access point or router might have 5,000
ft or greater coverage, according to
some vendors, and is more suitable for
reading Wi-Fi-based tags at wide open
construction sites.

Industry needs to develop RFID interoperability standards
Gary M. Gaukler
Texas A&M University
College Station,Tex.
To date, RFID in the oil and gas
industry has not been used as ubiquitously as in other ﬁelds. The reason for
this lack of adoption is not that there
are no good applications here; quite to
the contrary, according to results of a
detailed mapping of RFID opportunities in the oil and gas industry that we
recently performed at the RFID and
Supply Chain Systems Lab at Texas
A&M University.
What is the reason for this disconnect? Two factors are crucial: a lack of
a clear and quantitative understanding
of beneﬁts, and a lack of well-deﬁned
standards that would make RFID
interoperable among the oil and gas
industry.
For our analysis, we focused on
applications of RFID for drilling equipment such as casing tubing, drill pipe,
collars, and couplings. The reason for
this choice was that preliminary analysis indicated that a majority of beneﬁts
and majority of potential complications
would occur in this area.
For drilling equipment, we can
roughly classify beneﬁts as traditional
asset tracking and industry-unique rig
applications. Traditional asset tracking solutions applied to the drilling
equipment supply chain mean tagging
individual casing, pipe, or collars to
achieve visibility across the supply
chain from manufacturing to distribution to the rig. Besides the minor
complication of having to attach and

successfully read RFID tags to metal
objects, this is a well-understood process that can be readily adapted from
best practices in other industries.

RFID at the rig
First, RFID tags can be used to ensure integrity of the drill string. Tags can
monitor workers: using the designated
drill pipe in the correct position, using
the correct coupling and collars, inserting the right casing, etc. This is accomplished via RFID tag reads of the drill
pipe and comparison of that drill pipe’s
speciﬁcations (cross-linked via the tag
identiﬁer to a database) before the pipe
is connected and run downhole.
Second, using RFID tags can improve the inspection and recertiﬁcation process of used drill pipe. This is
an important aspect because stress
cracks may appear suddenly and visual
inspection is not a reliable indicator
of future pipe performance. A complementary and perhaps better indicator is
to use history information on the drill
pipe (e.g., hours used, environmental
factors, position in drill string) to predict the expected remaining lifetime.
Staff can extract this history data on individual drill pipe from RFID data logs.
An industry standard is needed to
ensure interoperability of tags (for example, embedded in drill pipe) with the
RFID systems along the supply chain
and at the rig.

can withstand environmental stresses.
• Tag application—where and how to
embed the tag.
• Tag data storage—what data need
to be stored on a tag. This is not trivial.
Problems with network connectivity at
rigs in remote locations suggests that
a unique identiﬁer cross-referenced
to a central database, as in the EPC
Global retail standard, may need to be
complemented by additional on-tag
read and write ﬁelds.
• Air interface between tag and
reader. This may be different for different applications and dual-mode tags.
• Interface between tag and sensors—temperature, pressure, salinity,
etc.
Our study suggests that the business
case for RFID in oil and gas is there—
in particular in today’s environment
characterized by a renewed emphasis
on process efﬁciency. Now it’s time to
launch the discussion about standards.

Establishing an RFID interoperability
standard should address:
• Tag and reader design—casing that

new technologies in the construction
industry.10
The smart chips project “investigates
commercial-ready and near-ready” RFID
technologies that can be “easily adapted
for field construction, operations, and
maintenance applications.”
Oil field sector participants in this
project include: BP North America,
Chevron, Jacobs Engineering Group
Inc., KBR Inc., Fluor Corp., and Zachry
Construction Corp.

Looking ahead
Industry demand will drive design
innovations in RFIDs to lower costs and
provide increasingly efficient and reliable components:
• Ultralow-power components and
multi-sensing tags. Research continues
on passive tag systems that incorporate
physical sensors for light, temperature,
humidity, and chemicals. Texas Instruments, for instance, has developed an
ultralow-power microcontroller.11
• RFID antennas. Tags and receivers both depend on antennas to send
and receive data. Passive RFID tags are
especially dependent on antenna design
because they have to collect energy to
power the tag and radiate signal back to
the readers.12
• Long-range active tags. 2.45 GHz
active tags and readers are currently
available, but development will continue to extend the readable range.
Establishing standards for RFID
components and engaging in multiple
proof-of-concept projects through
cost-effective consortia will probably
increase the pace of RFID technology
adoption in the upstream oil and gas
industry.
Sam Falsafi, senior director of
business solutions at Houston-based
Shipcom Wireless, told OGJ, “RFID is
not only about trying to gain efficiencies and extract additional value from
core assets, it’s about enabling process
intelligence.” ✦

Effect of rising oil prices
The analyses showed that, after a
point, rising oil prices began to erode
refining profits. This occurred because crude prices were rising faster
than product prices. The problem was
and is that, while the crude market is
worldwide, product markets are more
regional. If products moved around the
world as easily as crude does, prices
would track each other and margins
would not be influenced directly by
increasing crude prices except for time
lags in response.
Demand for crude worldwide was
and is growing faster than demand for
products in the US. This is a problem
for refining companies because the result of these trends is an eventual profit
squeeze.

after $63.41/bbl based on the regression equation. First derivative of the

The USWC margin began to decline

Although the cash margin is not completely dependent on crude oil prices, it
highly correlates with these prices.

based on the trend line. Although the
profitability of USWC refineries was
greater than those on the USGC, this
difference is eroding and will eventually
disappear if the trend continues.
Two major forces that determine the
price of any product are supply and
demand. If one grows faster than the
other or shrinks faster than the other,
the price will change to adjust for the
imbalance.
For gasoline, for instance, demand
growth increased faster than the supply
resulting in a rise in the price relative to
production costs in the US. Production
costs began to increase faster than product prices in the US, as the growth in
world demand for crude oil exceeded
the growth in demand for petroleum
products in the US.
Demand for gasoline in the world
continued to grow at a rate greater than
that in the US as developing countries
like China restricted petroleum prod-

uct price increases to below marketclearing prices. The result was a higher
derived demand for crude globally vs.
the US. Production cost increases were
therefore not wholly covered by product price increases as evidenced by the
problems that companies in China have
experienced during the last year.
In the US, refining companies may
see profits turn to losses soon. Companies with crude production of significance may be able to cover refining
losses with crude profits. World economic growth and US policies cause
product prices to rise while refining
profitability is declining.
Politicians who want to impose taxes
on the oil industry because profits have
been high, miss the point of supply-demand forces and how these are integrated into the world economy. Cycles in
refinery profits occur and when profits
are high, politicians seem to ignore the
times when profits are actually negative

or, at best result, yielding rates of return
on investment below reasonable levels.
Two factors that contribute to the
problem’s severity, given the growth
in world demand for petroleum, are
restrictions placed on exploration and
development of domestic crude oil supplies, including shale, and barriers to
building new refinery capacity. Refineries expand, but the configurations are
not optimal.
There is functional obsolescence because refineries that are expanded cannot be made to be as efficient as a new
refinery could be. This generally results
in higher production costs and lower
production levels than if new refineries
were built. ✦

and enclosures as part of a 60-day trial
beginning June 15, 2006.
The system monitored pipeline
rectifiers to the operator’s satisfaction,
but need for improvement was noted
regarding the ground unit’s scale, cost,
and user interface (which was deemed
overly complex).
A second multi-client round of trials
began in August 2007, with equipment installed at a variety of locations
including a standard AC rectifier, a
DC-powered rectifier, and a gas-fuelled
generator. Devices responded at a 98%
rate during the trials and customers

reported satisfaction that initial shortcomings had been addressed.2 ✦

Lightweight modular mat system suited for oil ﬁeld
New composite matting systems are
suited for oil field use.
The company says its lightweight mats
are strong, rigid, and rugged, which
means users are able to readily access otherwise difficult to get to remote locations
with speed and ease.
The proprietary curved interlocking
design promises simple and quick assembly. The nonabsorbent nature of composite
surfacing materials provide an easy to
clean surface and eliminate the possibility of vegetative and chemical site crosscontamination. Light weight and resulting
buoyant characteristics of the mat help reduce the need for multiple layers, increase
the probability of 100% mat recovery,
and as a result keep reclamation costs to a
minimum, the firm points out.

THE REMAINDER

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

UNCONVENTIONAL GAS EXTRACTION BECOMING VIABLE
Production from unconventional reservoirs — tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds--accounts for a large and growing share of total gas
supply. But the reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them are continually rising while presenting unique
environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional reserves proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires
increasingly sophisticated recovery methods.
Gas recovery from unconventional reserves will be explored on September 30 – October 2, 2008 at the
Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition to be held at the Hilton Fort Worth, in Fort Worth,
Texas. Planned by the editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an Advisory Board of industry experts, the event will
highlight innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world.

House leaders
press national
drilling program
House Democrats are pressing a national drilling program for the US.
They want the oil and gas industry to
drill up existing leaseholds before they’ll
allow leasing in highly prospective but controversial areas such as the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge coastal plain in Alaska.
They tried to advance their national drilling program ﬁrst through the use-it-or-loseit approach to leasing.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

A House bill introduced last month
would have accelerated relinquishment
of unproductive leases and prevented the
issuance of new leases to companies not
developing existing leasehold diligently
enough.
The Interior secretary would have received authority to decide what constitutes
diligent development. Several antileasing
Interior secretaries of the past would have
relished the power.
HR 6251 failed. House leaders now
propose annual lease sales for the National
Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to show, according to Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer of
Maryland, that “Democrats support increasing the domestic production of petroleum
and our other energy resources.”
They just support production where they
support it and not where they don’t—such
as in ANWR or off the East and West Coasts.
They seem to think the problem is
reluctance to drill acreage already leased—
notwithstanding contrary evidence such
as briskly rising completion totals and rig
counts. Hoyer took pains to point out that
operators hold leases (he mistakenly said
drilling permits) covering 68 million acres
and that NPR-A covers 20 million acres.
Naming states whose combined areas
represent 88 million acres, he called the total “an enormous amount of land on which
drilling could take place.”
See? The Democratic leaders don’t oppose drilling—at least not now that strenuously high oil prices have made consumers
ask why so much federal acreage hasn’t
been leased.
The Democrats just want Americans to
think they know better than oil companies
do where drilling should occur. And if they
get their way it will occur there or not at all.
It’s a national drilling program, the
essence of which are drilling decisions
made by people who don’t have to place
capital at risk or know anything about play
development.
National drilling programs don’t produce much oil or gas.

Crude ﬂuctuates in $12/bbl range
Crude prices ﬂuctuated in a $12/bbl range July 7-11 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, falling sharply in the ﬁrst two sessions as the US dollar strengthened then
rebounding in the last two sessions to almost make up that loss.
The front-month crude contract lost $9.29/ bbl through July 7-8 as the US dollar
strengthened, then inched up just 1¢/bbl on July 9 before climbing $9.03/bbl over the
July 10-11 sessions amid worries of possible supply disruptions. The August contract
for benchmark US light, sweet crudes fell July 7 for the ﬁrst time in four sessions after Iran’s foreign minister hinted at conciliation over that country’s nuclear program.
It then dropped $5.37 to $136.04/bbl July 8, the biggest 1-day loss since Mar. 19, as
the strengthening dollar and other economic factors triggered a sell-off of commodities.
However, losses stopped July 9 as Iran test-ﬁred nine medium and long-range
missiles in the Persian Gulf. A June exercise by Israel’s air force earlier had triggered speculation of a possible attack on Iran’s nuclear sites. The crude contract
escalated $5.60 to $141.65/bbl July 10 on the New York Mercantile Exchange when
Iran test-ﬁred more missiles apparently in response to a warning from Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice that the US will defend Israel and other allies if attacked.
A ﬂurry of trading hiked the contract’s price by $4/bbl in the last 30 minutes of the
open session. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has warned it cannot replace the crude shortfall if Iran is attacked and its production and exports are
disrupted.
Crude futures jumped to a record $147.27/bbl in intraday trading July 11, before
closing at $145.08/bbl, up $3.43 for the day but down 21¢ for the week. It appeared
headed for another loss in early trading July 14 as the dollar appreciated vs. the euro
after the US Treasury revealed plans to provide direct loans to the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage Assoc. to shore up the value of
home loans they hold.
Factors affecting prices
Workers went on strike July 14 at 33 of Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s 42 offshore
platforms in Brazil’s Campos basin. That accounts for more than 80% of Brazil’s total
output of 1.8 million b/d. Workers vowed to resist Petrobras’ contingency plan to
maintain production. At issue is a 10-year quest by workers for Petrobras to count
the day that crews leave the offshore platforms as a working day.
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, “The
stronger dollar has offset the added geopolitical risk premium related to the 5-day
strike of Petrobras employees in Brazil. We expect that this prospective supply
disruption, as well as ongoing instability in Nigeria and Iran, will continue to add
volatility to short-term oil prices.”
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, said, “Iran has been trying to do
as good a public relations exercise as Israel and its ‘Glorious Spartan’ military exercise early in June.” Jakob said: “Israel has been telling the world that maybe it has
the logistical capacity of hitting Iran, and Iran has been telling the world that maybe
it has the capacity to hit Israel.” Discussions continued over a prenegotiation freeze
period on the nuclear issue. “If it was not for the missile test, then any advance in
the negotiations would have looked like Iran was giving in due to the Israeli threat,”
said Jakob. Meanwhile, photography experts said one photo of four Iranian missiles
being ﬁred was faked. There is speculation that Iran doctored the photo to cover up
its failure to launch one of the missiles in that group.
In other news, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela said oil prices could hit $300/
bbl if ExxonMobil Corp. were to freeze Venezuelan assets again in the dispute over
a nationalized oil project in that country. ExxonMobil earlier won a temporary court
injunction freezing $12 billion in assets held by Petroleos de Venezuela SA. A London
court later overturned that injunction, but Chavez said the US ﬁrm could seek further
action against Venezuela.
Nigerian rebels ended a 2-week ceaseﬁre July 12. Gunmen kidnapped two
employees of Julius Berger Nigeria PLC, a unit of Bilﬁnger Berger AG, Germany’s
second largest builder, in Port Harcourt July 11.
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, said, “Falling oil demand in the US and Europe is offsetting strength in China. But the continuing impact of economic gains in the other non-OECD Asian countries as well as the
Middle East, and the ‘rest of the world,’ mean that oil demand remains strong.”

Troll Gives Up Its Oil looks at the offshore Troll
ﬁeld, discovered in 1974 and declared commercial in 1983, is one of Norway’s largest gas
producers. But today, thanks to joint technical
initiatives by operator Norsk Hydro, a number of Baker-Hughes business units and other
service providers, Troll’s previously “unrecoverable” crude reserves are now ﬂowing into
multilateral wells, making it Norway’s largest
oil ﬁeld, as well.

COVER
Crews handle concrete-coated 42-in. pipe, each joint weighing
about 54,000 lb, for the Sabine Pass Pipeline being constructed for
a subsidiary of Cheniere Energy Inc. Work on the pipeline, which
includes 16 miles of land lay and push work and a directional
drill crossing of 2,200 ft, began in May 2007. The Sabine Pass
Pipeline will provide the grid interconnection for Cheniere’s 4-bcfd
sendout capacity LNG regasification terminal under construction
at Sabine Pass in southwestern Louisiana. Oil & Gas Journal’s
special report on Pipeline Economics, which begins on p. 44, provides more information on similar projects, along with operational
and financial data reported to the US Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission for 2006-07. Photo from Willbros USA Inc. by

General

Interest

Kazakh ofﬁcials suspend Kashagan ﬁeld permit
Kazakhstan officials Aug. 27 suspended the permit for exploration and development work in Kashagan oil field off Kazakhstan,
effectively halting work on the vast field for the next 3 months.
This is the latest in a series of obstacles that the consortium behind Kashagan’s development—led by Agip Kazakhstan North Caspian Operating Co. NV (Agip KCO), a unit of Italy’s Eni SPA—has
had to contend with. Most recently work in Kashagan was snagged
by alleged environmental violations that threatened to revoke the
consortium’s license (OGJ, Aug. 27, 2007, p. 26).
Eni is sole operator and holds an 18.52% interest in the North
Caspian Sea production-sharing agreement to carry out exploration, development, and production activities in an offshore area in
the northern part of the Caspian Sea, where giant Kashagan field
was discovered.
To carry out operations, Eni created Agip KCO, which acts on
behalf of the consortium.
The group plans to develop the field by drilling about 280 wells
and building offshore platforms and artificial islands.
Oil and part of the natural gas produced will be sent in two
separate trains to the treatment plant of Bolashak near Atyrau. Export options for production being considered include using an oil
pipeline owned and operated by Caspian Pipeline Consortium, in
which Eni holds a 2% interest, that links Atyrau, in Kazakhstan, to
the Russian oil terminal of Novorossisysk, in the Black Sea.
Eni also is cooperator and holds a 32.5% interest in Karachaganak Petroleum Operating BV, a consortium created to develop and
operate Karachaganak field, one of the world’s largest oil and gas
fields, in northwestern Kazakhstan.

Ryder Scott: Trinidad and Tobago reserves declining
The Ryder Scott audit of Trinidad and Tobago’s natural gas reserves has revealed a 3.83 tcf decline since January 2005.
The report found that Trinidad and Tobago has 17.05 tcf of
proved gas reserves, 7.76 tcf of probable reserves, and 6.23 tcf of
possible reserves.
The report also found that the twin-island nation’s risked 3P
reserves would be adequate to supply the demand for gas through
2016 before declining.
Trinidad and Tobago’s cabinet made four decisions arising from
the survey results, according to Energy Minister Lenny Saith:
• Increase the rate at which decisions are made and blocks
awarded for exploration.
• Do not move any gas-based project to the priority A category
from the nonpriority B category.
• Get more geological information on potential areas to explore.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

• Look at the taxation structure for exploration in high-risk
areas.
Saith said, “The survey is saying, ‘Look at your taxation for exploration in high-risk areas, not exploration in low-risk areas. Look
at your tax policy and determine if there is anything you need to
do that will speed up [companies’ willingness] to take risk in those
high risk areas.’”
Saith said 16 new wells will be drilled within the next 15
months and insisted there would not be any new LNG trains built
unless additional gas is discovered.
Trinidad and Tobago has four LNG trains and last year was responsible for 67% of total US LNG imports.
While there was a reduction in the 3Ps, the survey reported a 5
tcf increase in what it says could yet be discovered.
Ryder Scott reported that Trinidad and Tobago has a potential for
an additional 37 tcf of gas awaiting discovery.
The increase in the figure resulted from the collection and
processing of 3D data by Canada Superior and Petro-Canada that
showed there may be larger gas structures than originally thought
in the blocks they are exploring.

Indonesia’s domestic gas needs remain top priority
Indonesian Vice-President Jusuf Kalla said his country will remain “consistent” in honoring current natural gas supply contracts with Japan, but that its top priority will be to meet domestic
needs.
After meeting Aug. 20 with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,
who was on a state visit to Indonesia, Kalla said his country wanted
to increase energy exports, including to Japan, as the country needs
more export earnings.
To enable greater export potential, Kalla said improvements in
the efficiency of domestic gas use will be made, while exploration will be expanded to increase the production of oil and gas.
Kalla said exploration is already under way in Java, Papua, and the
Natuna islands.
Meanwhile, according to Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro, there was no discussion between Abe
and Kalla about any extensions of current LNG supply contracts
with Japan.
For some time now, Indonesia has had rising domestic demand
for gas. As a result, in June Indonesia said it was reallocating supplies of Tangguh LNG originally earmarked for Sempra Energy
LNG in order to boost the amounts available to state-owned utility
Perusahaan Listrik Negara (OGJ Online, June 18, 2007).
In March, in an effort to obtain higher prices for its LNG exported from Tangguh in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia said it
wanted to renegotiate LNG contract terms with South Korea (OGJ
Online, Mar. 6, 2007).

EPA: Current levels of reﬁnery emissions acceptable
The US Environmental Protection Agency reported Aug. 23 that existing levels of toxic air pollutants released from US refineries do not
require further controls to protect human health or the environment.
EPA recently conducted an analysis required under the Clean Air
Act. The analysis examined potential risks that remain after implementation of maximum achievable control technology (MACT)
standards.
MACT standards require industrial facilities to reduce emissions
of toxic air pollutants. EPA first issued MACT standards for refineries in 1995.

Exploration

&

Development

Statoil ﬁnds gas with Midnattsol well off Norway
Statoil ASA made a deepwater natural gas discovery with its
6405/10-1 exploration well in the Midnattsol 281 production license in the Norwegian Sea. The find lies 40 km north of Ormen
Lange field and 30 km south of the Ellida discovery. It is too early
to declare the find commercial, Statoil said.
The company plans to drill an additional five exploration wells
in the deepwater area in 2008. Three of these it will operate, said
Frode Fasteland, acting head of exploration on the Norwegian continental shelf.
The Midnattsol well was drilled to a TD of 3,158 m subsea in
928 m of water by Transocean Inc.’s Transocean Leader semisubmersible. The well found gas in a late Cretaceous reservoir.
Core samples have been taken and an extremely thorough data
acquisition program carried out, Statoil said. The collected data will
be analyzed to delineate and define the discovery.
Midnattsol will be permanently plugged and abandoned. And
the drilling rig will now be taken over by Eni SPA.
The licensees in PL 281, Blocks 6405/4, 7, and 10 are operator
Statoil 50%, E.On Ruhrgas 20%, Petoro SA 20%, and CononoPhillips 10%.

Drilling

&

Ithaca Energy (UK) Ltd. entered into an agreement with Senergy Ltd. to use the Stena Spey semisubmersible and drilling management services to drill the second appraisal well on the Athena
oil project in the Outer Moray Firth off Scotland.
Drilling which was scheduled to begin in late August, is part of
a work program leading up to a field development plan expected
to be filed in this year’s fourth quarter.
Well objectives are to evaluate the eastern lobe of the Athena discovery, for which probable undeveloped oil reserves have been independently verified at 28 million bbl (20 million bbl net to Ithaca).
Ithaca will spud the well close to the mapped northern pinchout of the Cretaceous Upper Leek formation. The well site is
midway between the 14/18b-11 well, which encountered good
reservoir in the Upper Leek below the oil-water contact, and the
14/18b-12 well, which encountered tight reservoir in the Upper
Leek sands but had an oil-leg in the Lower Leek sands (OGJ Online,
Nov. 30, 2006).

Statoil’s interest in PL 281 was recently increased when it acquired
Royal Dutch Shell PLC’s 20% interest (OGJ Online, Apr. 27, 2007).

Manning promises exploration incentives in 2008
Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Patrick Manning reported
during his 2007-08 budget presentation that the Caribbean island
nation next year will offer incentives to major oil and gas companies to explore for hydrocarbons in marginal fields.
Commenting on the recent Ryder Scott natural gas audit that
showed Trinidad and Tobago’s production hitting a plateau in
about 9 years, Manning said, “What is needed now is a new fiscal regime of incentives to stimulate further drilling in the Deep
Marine areas of East Coast, marginal fields, heavy oil, and farm-in,
farm-out arrangements.”
He added, “We confidently expect... new discoveries of oil and
gas and the preservation of Trinidad and Tobago’s position as an
industrial center in the region.”
During a recent energy conference in Port of Spain, the major
oil and gas companies asked the Trinidad and Tobago government
to review its taxation regime in high risk areas like its deepwater
blocks. ✦

Ithaca to drill second Athena appraisal well

8

Now EPA is seeking public comment on two options it proposed for controlling air emissions from refineries. The first option
would require no additional emissions reductions because the risks
are acceptably low. The second option would require additional
emissions reductions for certain storage vessels and wastewater
treatment units.
Under this alternative, EPA projects refineries could reduce air
toxics emissions by as much as 4,600 tons/year from 153 facilities.
EPA will accept public comment for 60 days following publication
of the proposals in the Federal Register. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Recent results of seismic processing following the drilling of
the 14/18b-15 well have confirmed the selection of the bottomhole location for the planned well, which is designed to be kept as
a production well and is in a position to optimally drain the eastern
part of Athena field.
Ithaca had expected to drill this well with the Byford Dolphin
semisubmersible this summer, but it has been delayed due to operational, scheduling, and weather-related issues on its current
program (OGJ Online, Apr. 2, 2007).
Ithaca has decided to delay taking on the Byford Dolphin semisubmersible until later this year to allow the Stena Spey to begin
the Athena work as soon as possible, the company said.

Williams studies Canadian oil sands expansion
Williams Cos., Tulsa, is making an engineering study for possible expansion of its Canadian facilities to extract ethane from offgas emissions associated with its oil sands production in Alberta.

The company recovers and purifies natural gas liquids and olefins at its Fort McMurray and Redwater oil sands production facilities in Alberta that it has operated since 2002.
It is contemplating construction of a cryogenic processing plant,
addition of a de-ethanizer, and expansion of its existing fractionator at its Redwater complex north of Edmonton, Alta; and addition
of a de-ethanizer to the Redwater complex. The de-ethanizer could
begin operating in stages as early as 2010; the new off-gas processing plant could start up in 2012, officials said.
“As the only company with facilities in service to recover olefins
and natural gas liquids from the Canadian oil sands off-gas, Williams is uniquely positioned to provide these services,” said Randy
Newcomer, vice-president. “Recovering rather than burning the
liquids contained in the off-gas not only increases the value of the
off-gas, but also results in a significant environmental benefit.”
Williams’s current operations at Fort McMurray and Redwater
reduce emissions of carbon dioxide—a greenhouse gas—in Alber-

Qatar Petroleum lets contract for reﬁnery
State-owned Qatar Petroleum plans to build a grassroots refinery with 250,000 b/d capacity and other associated facilities in
Messaieed, Qatar. QP has let a lump sum front-end engineering
design contract to Technip for the work.
The $60 million contract covers the Al Shaheen facility and an
oil pipeline that will extend from Al Shaheen oil and gas field 90
km offshore to Messaieed 110 km onshore, as well as other import-export facilities. Technip’s operations and engineering centers
in Paris and Abu Dhabi will carry out the contract work.
The refinery, which will produce mainly gasoline, diesel, and jet
fuel, will incorporate some of the most technologically advanced
conversion units for upgrading bottom of the barrel products. The
facilities are scheduled to be operational by yearend 2011.
Qatar currently has just one refinery at Umm Said. It has a capacity of 200,000 b/cd and is operated by National Oil Distribution Co.
Qatar’s crude production capacity is expected to increase to 1.1
million b/d by late 2008. The increase will come from expansion
of Al-Shaheen oil field. A development effort in progress in Al Shaheen field will raise the field’s oil production to 525,000 b/d from
240,000 b/d (OGJ, Mar. 26, 2007, Newsletter).

ta by 219,000 tons/year. It also reduces annual emissions of sulfur
dioxide—a contributor to acid rain—by more than 3,200 tons.
Williams’ contemplated expansion of its off-gas operations and
ethane removal would further decrease emissions associated with
oil sands production, officials said. The company recently signed
nonbinding letters of intent specific to the expansions it will evaluate. It’s evaluation of ethane-recovery facilities is the subject of such
an agreement with Nova Chemicals Corp.

Leed Petroleum secures rig for Gulf of Mexico work
Leed Petroleum PLC, a London-based oil and gas exploration
and production company focused on the Gulf of Mexico, will begin a multiple well drilling program in September initially on its
Eugene Island Blocks 183 and 184 in the gulf.
The company has signed a contract with Ensco Offshore Co. for
use of Rig 98 to carry out the drilling. Leed is operator of Block

to 90% from 30% and creates the capacity to increase production
of clean fuels by 1.7 million gal/day.
Malone said if BP determines that the refinery cannot operate
after the heavy crude project is implemented and still meet the
lower discharge limits, the company will develop a project to allow
it to do so.
He explained, however, that “if necessary changes to the project
result in a material impact to project viability, we could be forced
to cancel it.”
Malone said the project requires regulatory certainty. And “opposition to any increase in discharge permit limits for Lake Michigan creates an unacceptable level of business risk for this $3.8 billion investment,” he said.
During the next 18 months, BP will continue to seek issuance
of other permits, continue project design, and explore options for
operating within the lower discharge limits.
The company has agreed to participate with the Purdue Calumet Water Institute and the Argonne National Laboratory in a
joint effort to identify and evaluate emerging technologies with
the potential to improve wastewater treatment across the Great
Lakes.
BP will provide a $5 million grant to Purdue University to help
underwrite the research effort, Malone said.

BP won’t raise discharge limits at Whiting reﬁnery
BP America Inc. on Aug. 23 promised to operate its 399,900 b/cd
Whiting, Ind., refinery to meet the lower discharge limits specified
in its previous wastewater treatment permit. BP’s pledge came after
a new, recently approved permit, which allows for higher discharge
limits, met with regional opposition.
“We will not make use of the higher discharge limits in our
new permit,” said BP America Chairman and Pres. Bob Malone.
The new permit allows BP to increase discharge limits to 1,584
lb/day from 1,030 lb/day for ammonia and to 4,925 lb/day from
3,646 lb/day for total suspended solids. The permit is associated
with a $3.8 billion upgrade project that would enable BP’s Whiting
refinery to increase processing capacity for Canadian heavy crude

Nigeria’s DPR assesses 26 reﬁnery applications
Nigeria’s Department for Petroleum Resources (DPR) has received 26 applications from private companies wishing to build
refineries in Nigeria.
According to DPR’s midyear 2007 report, four of the 26 companies had their licenses overturned in March because they failed
to build the refinery by the given deadline. The applications are at
different stages of processing.
Under DPR’s guidelines companies will be required to deposit
$1 million for every 10,000 b/d of planned capacity, which would
be refundable within 18 months provided the project is carried
out to deadline.

During August Germany has suffered a one-third shortfall in oil
supplies from Russia via the Druzhba oil pipeline network. The line
delivers oil from Russia through Belarus en route to Europe.
Transneft Vice-Pres. Sergei Grigoryev told Interfax that OAO Lukoil and other smaller companies had allegedly cut deliveries and
had not given a reason for doing so.
The 220,000 b/d PCK refinery at Schwedt in eastern Germany
has sought other sources to make up for the shortfall of supply. The
company said it had been informed by suppliers that there would
be supply fluctuations and talks are ongoing between the parties.
Nevertheless the refinery is running at full capacity and is using
its resources as well as oil supplies from the North Sea.
One possible reason that Lukoil has cut crude shipments to Germany is because it wants to sell directly to the German markets
instead of through the traders who it is currently in conflict with,
according to media reports. Full supplies are expected to resume
this month.
In recent weeks there was speculation that there were problems
with the pipeline network, which was why supplies had fallen. This
is the second time in the last 8 months that Germany has seen a
shortfall (OGJ Online, Jan. 10, 2007).

disposal technologies that Argonne lists
include discharging into a larger body
of water, underground injection, evaporation, and offsite commercial disposal.
Argonne says the parameters of
greatest concern in disposal are the
organic content (oil and grease) and the
salt content (salinity, conductivity).
It notes that in some cases the salinity of discharged water such as to the
Gulf of Mexico is not a concern, but oil
and grease concentration regulations
need to be met.
Different technologies can treat the

membrane processes, including reverse

Other technologies for removing salts
are ion exchange, capacitive deionization, and thermal distillation.
Oil and grease removal technologies
include physical separation with hydrocyclones, centrifuges, and filtration. Other
options include coalesors, flotation cells,

Proﬁts and angry policy
A central motive of energy policy-making in
the US is anger at oil companies. The sentiment
expresses itself in bills passed this year by both
houses of Congress. A Senate bill would make oil
prices found to be “unconscionably excessive” a
target of criminal prosecution. A House bill would
sharply raise taxes on the oil industry.
The anger results only partly from the oil price
increases of the past few years. When confronted
with explanations for the prices—rising demand,
limited supply, hurricanes—angry observers typically note that oil-company profits reported when
prices are high are what really peeve people.
For companies that sell crude oil and its derivatives, of course, profits are hard to avoid when
commodity and product prices jump. The increases raise revenue if sales volumes hold steady or
rise. And the revenue increases lift profits if costs
hold still. That so many Americans find this arithmetic outrageous is perplexing. That the outrage so
readily influences politics is even more so.
In fact, policy mistakes born of anger outlast
price-swollen profits, which inevitably get whittled by rising costs. It’s happening now.
As the story on p. 22 reports, second-quarter
profits for a group of producers and refiners fell
from the same period last year even as revenue
increased. For 71 companies based in the US, net
income fell 9.6% on total revenue up 2.6%. Fifteen
of the companies reported net losses. For a sample
of Canadian oil and gas companies, second-quarter earnings dropped by more than 20%.
Profits can decline when revenues rise for many
reasons. But the common factor in second-quarter
financial reports will surprise no one in the oil
and gas business: surging costs.
Contemporaneous industry data on operating
costs are scarce. But various proxies make clear
that oil field costs have been zooming. For example:
• In a July report, Adam Sieminski of Deutsche
Bank, using data from the US Energy Information
Administration, estimated that worldwide finding and development costs increased 15%/year in
inflation-adjusted terms during 2005-07. He pro-

jected the rate of increase at 7.5%/year or more
during 2008-10, when the average finding and
development cost would reach $18-20/bbl.
• The annual Joint Association Survey on Drilling Costs published by the American Petroleum
Institute last April showed average drilling costs
per well and per foot, adjusted for activity and
inflation, nearly doubled for all US wells during
2000-05. The 2004-05 increases, however, were
less than 1%.
• A new index of capital costs—which don’t
immediately affect profits but rise for many of
the same reasons operating costs do—reflects a
surge that its producers call “dramatic.” For the
6 months ending last Mar. 31, the IHS/CERA
Upstream Capital Costs Index, published by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, was up 79%
from 2000. The indicated annual rate of project
inflation for the period was 14%, down from 30%
in 2006 in a trend CERA said might foreshadow a
plateau as early as next year.
Everyone in the oil and gas business knows
how costs have risen and why: competition for
workers, materials, and services. The increases
were predictable. Oil and gas price increases
since 2001 did more than raise industry revenues
and restore profitability, which in the 1990s had
become elusive for many companies. They also
stimulated activity in an industry with work capacities shrunken by years of financial trouble, an
industry suddenly needing to compete with other
active businesses for the ingredients of expansion.
So costs have jumped and are eroding profits.
The development should begin to comfort industry antagonists who think oil and gas companies
ought not to make money. It should, but it won’t.
The antagonists will just replace anger over profits
with the strangely ineradicable suspicion that
companies curb supply to drive up oil prices.
Yet behavior consistent with that suspicion is
nowhere to be seen. While US profits were falling in this year’s second quarter, operators were
completing what API estimates to have been the
highest number of wells in 21 years, and refiners
were working up to their highest rate of gasoline
output in history. ✦

During 1999-2006, US gasoline
prices almost tripled, shocking consumers and spurring public debate
about the causes of the increase.
Simply put, the debate has pitched
those who argue that the price reflects the market response to stronger
demand and increasing raw material
costs against those who see greedy oil
companies using the power of monopoly to
withhold
output
and artificially
inflate
prices.
Critics
have argued that:
• Oil companies have consolidated
to increase concentration and decrease
competition and have deliberately failed
to invest in capacity, causing shortages
and high gasoline prices.
• Speculation in futures markets has
bid up gasoline futures prices, which in
turn bids up current gasoline and crude
oil prices.
• High gasoline prices are out of
line with cost increases, allowing excessive profits in refining.
• US refineries are able to exploit
their alleged monopoly power because
of low demand price elasticities and

because consumers have no alternatives
to gasoline.
• Refineries have deliberately
reduced their inventories to increase
monopoly power, resulting in increased
price volatility.
This article examines, in the light of
economic theory and available statistical
evidence, these and other factors that
are causing high gasoline prices.

Gasoline price history
A review of the history of nominal
and real gasoline prices in the US since
1918 finds that recent gasoline price
levels are by no means unprecedented.
The price increases have been shocking because they followed more than
a decade of the lowest real prices US
markets have ever enjoyed.
Putting the current price run-up in
historical context, Fig. 1 shows nominal
US gasoline prices since 1918. Prices
were relatively stable during 1918-70,
when large multinational oil companies
controlled much of the oil flow. However, during 1973-82 prices more than
tripled in an era of tight markets, wars,
revolutions, and the emergence of powerful national oil companies. An almost
equally dramatic increase occurred during 1999 through August 2006, when
prices almost tripled. So the current
run-up is not unprecedented, and the
previous increase of this magnitude was
followed by a price decline.
The nominal gasoline prices shown
in Fig. 1 do not take into account that
over time generally all prices were
rising with inflation. When the price
is adjusted with the consumer price
index, we isolate the behavior of
gasoline prices relative to other prices
in the economy. The adjusted historical real gasoline prices in Fig. 1 show
a general downward trend in gasoline
prices except during the two periods of
sharply rising oil prices in 1973-1982
and 1999-2006. Real prices reached an
historical low in 1998 during the Asian
economic crisis and did not return to
their historical average of $2.13/gal (in
2005 dollars) until 2005. The productweighted average annual price in 2006

was lower, in real terms, than in the
1930s. Rather than being shocked by
recent high prices, one might ask why
consumers enjoyed such low gasoline
prices in the prior decade.
The run-up in gasoline prices is also
not unique among commodities. Fig.
1 also shows the combined price for
a range of industrial and agricultural
nonpetroleum commodities that make
up the Commodity Research Bureau’s
Commodity Price Index (CPI). This
index also rose sharply during 200206 to surpass its previous peak of the
early 1980s. The similar price increases
of nonpetroleum commodities suggest
that the recent trend in gasoline prices
reflects a strong world economy led by
the US, China, and India, rather than
specific actions by oil companies.

New fuel regulations have strongly
affected refiners since 1989. In addition to adding investment costs, tighter
environmental regulations effectively
reduce available refining capacity by
reducing throughput and even causing the closure of refineries that cannot
comply. Small refineries, in particular,
have been challenged in meeting new
fuel standards.

Reﬁners’ proﬁts
Higher oil prices have brought an era
of higher oil company profits, causing
some media personnel and policymakers to ask whether these profits are
excessive. These profits should be examined in an historical context.
The refining industry viewed the
early 1990s as a time of hardship, with
low capacity utilization, high environmental compliance costs, and inadequate profits (Fig. 3). As a result, in the
second half of the decade, the industry
undertook massive restructuring aimed

*First quarter

cantile Exchange was 8% less than during the second 2006 quarter. And the
refiners’ acquisition cost of crude was
down 3% from a year earlier, averaging
$62.36/bbl in the second quarter of
this year.
Cash refining margins were little
changed on the US Gulf Coast and East
Coast from a year earlier but varied
widely for US Midwest and West Coast
refiners.
The US Midwest cash margin during
the recent quarter averaged $26.95/bbl,
up 43% from a year ago, while the US
West Coast margin declined 22% to
average $28.83/bbl during the second
quarter of this year, according to Muse,
Stancil & Co.
Average front-month natural gas
prices on the NYMEX were $7.663/
MMbtu in the second quarter, up 15%
from the second quarter of 2006.

US operators
The OGJ sample of US-based oil and
gas producers and refiners collectively
recorded a 9.6% decline in net income
24

for the second quarter on revenues up
just 2.6% from a year earlier.
Hit by rising operating costs, 15 in
the group of 71 firms posted a net loss
for the second quarter.
Delta Petroleum Corp., for example, reported a $94.2 million loss
for the quarter, although its revenues
increased 20% from a year earlier to
$49 million. Delta’s operating income
for the recent quarter was hit hard by
expenses, primarily $69 million in
dry hole costs and impairments. The
Denver company’s production from
continuing operations during the
quarter increased 17% from the second
quarter of 2006.
Goodrich Petroleum Corp. incurred a
$3.3 million loss for the second quarter
in spite of posting a 39% gain in revenue from a year ago to $28 million.
Its operating loss, too, was primarily
due to higher expenses. The company
said that its depreciation, depletion, and
amortization expense for the second
quarter of 2007 was $19.5 million, up

from $10 million in the second quarter
of 2006.
Another group of 15 firms recorded
positive but reduced net income from
a year earlier at the same time that
revenues climbed. A variety of factors
contributed to these results, including higher costs, debt retirements, and
accounting adjustments on commodity trades. For some companies, these
factors outweighed gains from higher
production volumes.
For example, Swift Energy Co. posted
a 17% earnings decline to $31.5 million, while revenue increased 14% from
the second quarter of last year. Swift
said that its production volumes were
up 9% from a year earlier but that the
company incurred early debt retirement
expenses of $12.8 million during the
recent quarter. Without this, Swift’s net
income would have increased 4% for
the second quarter of 2007 to $39.5
million.
Chevron Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. recorded increases in earnings for the recent quarter. Chevron’s

net income climbed 24%, and Oxy’s
gained 64% as compared with the corresponding 2006 quarter.
But the other major producers
reported reduced earnings. At $557
million in profit, Hess Corp. recorded
a 1.6% earnings decline despite higher
sales volumes and strong trading and
refining results. Higher corporate costs
and interest expenses outweighed a 7%
gain in oil and gas production volumes.
With net income of $10.26 billion,
ExxonMobil Corp. posted a 1% decline
in results from the second quarter of
2006. The company reported that higher refining, marketing, and chemical
margins mostly offset lower natural gas
realizations during the recent quarter.
ConocoPhillips reported secondquarter net income of $301 million,
down from $5.2 billion for the second
quarter in 2006. Revenues were little
changed at $49.4 billion vs. $48.5 billion a year ago.
Second-quarter net income included
an after-tax impairment of $4.5 billion
in ConocoPhillips’s exploration and
production segment related to expropriation of the company’s oil projects in
Venezuela.
ConocoPhillips’s refining and marketing segment net income was $2.4
billion in the second quarter, up from
$1.7 billion a year earlier. The company
said the increase primarily was due to
higher worldwide margins, a net benefit associated with asset rationalization,
and lower costs associated with turnarounds and Hurricane Katrina impacts
in 2006. But these increases were offset
partially by lower volumes due to the
contribution of assets to the company’s
downstream business venture with EnCana Corp. (OGJ, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 36).

Independents, reﬁners
Abraxas Petroleum Corp. recorded
$56.9 million in earnings during the
second quarter of 2007, during which
the company closed a series of transactions that resulted in the repayment of
all of its indebtedness. For the second
quarter of 2006, the company posted
earnings of $1 million.
Oil & Gas Journal / Sept. 3, 2007

During the recent quarter, Abraxas
formed a master limited partnership,
Abraxas Energy Partners LP, to which
Abraxas contributed properties in South
and West Texas. This and subsequent
transactions resulted in the recognition
of a pretax gain in the amount of $58.5
million.
Independent refiner Frontier Oil
Corp. announced record net income of
$243.8 million for the quarter ended
June 30, 2007, compared with earnings
of $145.9 million a year earlier. For
the first half of 2007, net income was
$318.5 million, up from $203.2 million a year earlier.
Frontier said its record quarterly
results were achieved despite a planned
30-day, plant-wide shutdown at its
52,000-b/d Cheyenne refinery. As a
result of the Cheyenne turnaround, total
charges of crude and other feedstocks
at its two refineries for the second
quarter of 2007 fell to 163,991 b/d
from 171,426 b/d for the same period
of 2006. However, the company stored
intermediate and finished products during the first quarter of this year, allowing product sales to average 173,888
b/d for the most recent quarter, nearly
unchanged from the second quarter of
2006.
For the recent quarter, the Cheyenne refinery’s light-heavy differential
averaged $14.17/bbl, and the lightheavy spread at Frontier’s 110,000b/d El Dorado, Kan., refinery averaged
$18.78/bbl.
Refiners Sunoco Inc. and Valero
Energy Corp. each posted a nearly 20%
climb in earnings.
Commenting on Sunoco’s performance, analyst Eitan Bernstein of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc. said,
“Operating earnings of $482 million
were well above our forecast, primarily
due to higher-than-expected refining
margins and lower operating costs.”
Sunoco’s total throughput volumes
averaged nearly 900,000 b/d, reflecting turnaround work at the company’s
refineries, while Midcontinent margins
averaged $22.14/bbl, up 48% from a
year earlier. Northeast margins averaged

IFC to invest in Chinese coalbed methane project
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
World Bank division International
Finance Corp. has agreed to invest $15
million to help a Houston overseas
producer develop coalbed methane
resources in China. Far East Energy
Corp. will use the money to help fund
exploration and development of more
than 5,000 sq km of deposits in the
Shanxi and Yunnan provinces, IFC said
on Aug. 28.
“Given China’s significant coalbed
methane resources, this investment has
the potential to help the country meet
its growing energy needs by using domestic resources in an environmentally
conscious manner,” said Somit Varma,
IFC’s director for oil, gas, mining, and
chemicals (OGJ, Sept. 18, 2006, p. 30).
He noted that Far East Energy is the
third-largest concession holder of CBM
deposits in China, which is estimated
to have the world’s third-largest CBM
resource. The company will develop its
concession with its local joint venture
partner, state-owned China United
Coalbed Methane Co. Ltd., Varma said.
Michael R. McElwrath, Far East
Energy’s president and chief executive,

The Dingell
energy plan

DOJ will not challenge
group’s jointly proposed
nanotechnology research
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent

A

s Labor Day 2007 approached,
the most persistent question
within Washington, DC’s energy
community was what Rep. John D.
Dingell (D-Mich.) is planning. The
fiercely independent Energy and Natural Resources Committee chairman
applauded as the US House passed its
energy bill. But it was apparent that
the committee in general, and Dingell in particular, have more to say.
Unlike others who have taken positions demanding aggressive carbon
emission reductions and alternative
energy research and development,
Dingell has remained relatively quiet—publicly. In discussions behind
the scenes with the House’s Democratic leadership, he apparently has
maintained his reputation as a tough
negotiator.
It’s generally assumed that Dingell,
who has held his seat for more than
50 years, knows how Congress works
and what it will take to pass new
energy legislation. His support is
crucial, and his opinions matter.
So far, the only public indication
of what he is thinking about upcoming energy legislation is his Aug. 24
breakfast address to the American
Jewish Committee’s Detroit Chapter.
“The issue of global climate change,
and its effect on our national energy
policies, is critical,” he maintained.

comprehensive, mandatory, economy-wide program to move us further
toward the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60-80% by
2050. My own judgment is that we
are going to have to adopt a capand-trade system and some form of
carbon emission fee to achieve the
reductions we need.”
Dingell said his cap-and-trade
scheme would use the acid rain trading program which was part of the
1990 Clean Air Act amendments, and
not the European approach to controlling greenhouse gases, as a model.
He also plans to introduce a bill to
tax carbon and petroleum products
when Congress returns. “Properly
addressing climate change requires us
to address the issue of consumption.
We do that by making consumption
more expensive,” he explained.

Includes gasoline tax

Dingell said his proposal would
“impose a stiff tax on carbon,
increase the tax on gasoline, and
remove the mortgage interest deduction on ‘McMansions’—homes over
3,000 sq ft.” He added that effective
energy legislation needs to address
motor vehicles and fuels, nuclear
power’s role, coal’s future under carbon constraints, and other issues.
Like many of his past proposals,
this one won’t be popular. The idea

The US Department of Justice will
not challenge a proposal by a group of
oil and gas producers, oil field service
companies, and the University of Texas
at Austin to jointly research and develop
nanotechnology applications for oil and
gas exploration and production.
DOJ announced its position in an Aug.
23 letter from Thomas O. Barnett, assistant
attorney general in charge of the department’s antitrust division, to attorneys for
Advanced Energy Consortium (AEC).
AEC’s goal is to develop subsurface nanosensors that can be injected
into well bores, DOJ reported in the
announcement. It said the sensors’
microscopic size should allow them to
migrate out of the well bores and into
pores of the surrounding geological
structure to collect data about hydrocarbon reservoirs’ physical characteristics,
allowing more-efficient exploitation.
The consortium “appears to be

competition. To the extent that AEC engages in research efforts that would not

f you think Russia is a trustworthy
supplier of crude oil and natural
gas, think again. That’s especially necessary after recent reports that Russia
has slashed oil supplies to German
refineries, underlining concerns in
Europe and around the globe.
On Aug. 24 Russia’s OAO Lukoil,
the country’s second-largest oil producer, said supplies to Germany had
been reduced by about one-third in
July and August, but the firm refused
to explain why the reduction had
taken place.
Reports cited analysts who said
Lukoil’s decision not to provide
contract quantities of oil could be
aimed at extracting higher prices
from German refineries. Then again,
the move could be part of Lukoil’s efforts to acquire stakes in German and
European refineries.
German authorities played down
the move, saying the country’s energy
supplies were not in danger, as refineries could turn to other oil suppliers
to make up shortfalls. Said one government spokesman: “The situation
is not dramatic.”

ropean oil markets would cope with
the halt of Russian oil exports via the
Druzhba pipeline but still called for
a quick and clear resolution to the
problem?
European Union Energy Chief Andris Piebalgs said he might convene
a meeting of the bloc’s Oil Supply
Group to evaluate the situation (OGJ,
Jan. 15, 2007, p. 42).
We don’t recall that any evaluation
was ever done, but our evaluation
remains that oil has given the Russian Bear its new teeth. After years of
decline, the Russian economy has increased fivefold to nearly $1 trillion.

New teeth

The country is reaping the benefits
of buoyant oil and gas prices. Stateowned oil firm Gazprom controls
much of the country’s rich energy
resources and thus has the ability to
influence or even intimidate customers in Europe. Gazprom lends
economic teeth to Moscow’s foreign
policy goals.
Does that claim somehow give
meaning to the cut in Lukoil’s supplies to Germany? Let’s not forget

industry members will contribute
financially to the research, which the
university will carry out. UT Austin will
own all inventions resulting from that
research. Each member company contributing to an invention will receive a
royalty-free, nonexclusive, irrevocable,
worldwide perpetual license to use the
invention for noncommercial, internal
purposes. The member also will have
the independent right to create, use,
and sell any patented inventions, subject
to the payment of patenting costs, DOJ
said.
It said further that UT Austin plans
to license its rights to third parties on
a royalty-bearing basis, subject to the
approval of AEC members, which shall
not be unreasonably held. The consortium itself will not license, produce, or
market anything, the federal department
said. All members will retain the right
to conduct independent research and
development and to obtain intellectual
property rights resulting from its own
research, DOJ said.
Barnett said AEC is not designed to
restrict price or output of any product
on the basis of information it supplies
or to limit competitive research by
its member companies. The venture’s
operation should not adversely affect
other nanotechnology research, as its
participants retain the right to conduct
such research, he indicated.
“Moreover, the existence of a
substantial number of other entities
engaged in nanotechnology research,
both in the United States and abroad,
indicates that the formation and operation of the AEC is not likely to reduce
the amount or variety of such research,”
Barnett said.
The consortium’s structure makes
it unlikely that members will share
anticompetitive company information,
he continued. The agreement limits
information-sharing to information
that is “reasonably related and necessary
to the accomplishment of the research
program. It also requires that access to
confidential information be limited to
individuals who need it to carry out the
research program,” he added. ✦

Operators are consolidating acreage
positions in the Columbia River basin
as EnCana Corp.’s US unit drills its third
subbasalt wildcat in the nonproducing
area since 2004.
Exxel Energy Corp., Houston,
acquired 12.5% working interest in
390,000 gross acres in the basin in
Washington state from EnCana Oil &
Gas (USA) Inc. Netco Energy Inc., Vancouver, BC, acquired a 7.5% working
interest in the same lands.
The acquisitions included interests
in the EnCana Brown 7-24 wildcat in
Grant County, which Exxel said is drilling in the sedimentary section below
the base of basalt (OGJ, June 11, 2007,
p. 53).
EnCana has made public no results
from the three wells it has drilled in the
basin under an agreement with Shell’s
SWEPI LP unit.
The others are the Anderville Farms
1-6 in Grant County and the Anderson
11-5 in Yakima County.
Those three wells and Shell’s Yakima

exploration and development of acreage
covered by the leases within the CRB,
including the Yakima fold belt, Saddle

Exxel said its

two sets of figures has induced experts
to urge the Indian authorities to tighten
the norms for announcing oil and gas
discoveries to prevent exploration companies from overreporting or extracting
economic and political capital from
such new finds.
The revised ONGC and GSPC figures
also threaten to undermine New Delhi’s
claims that India will soon have a gas
surplus and become a net exporter of
the fuel. Gas supply in the country was
expected to reach 188 million standard
cu m/day (MMscmd) by 2009-10, a
significant rise from the present level of
80 MMscmd.
India also has been encouraging
power and fertilizer plants to switch to
gas from naphtha to cut costs. But those
plans may now go awry, given that
there will be less domestic gas production than was initially projected.

Gas imports
The country imports 70% of its
crude oil requirements and is able
to meet half its gas demand of 170
MMscmd via its domestic production. The deficit in gas consumption is
covered by LNG imports from countries
such as Qatar.
Prospects of accessing international
gas sources have brightened with progress in talks on the Iran-Pakistan-India
pipeline, a recent agreement with Algeria for LNG, and Indian plans to join the
$13 billion trans-Saharan gas pipeline.
Turkmenistan also recently said it
is interested in building a gas pipeline

many large independent
producers and a growing number of the major oil and gas
companies. This resource has become a
mainstay of the US natural gas industry
(Fig. 1).
The catch phrase “the future is
unconventional” appropriately captures
the trend for this important domestic
hydrocarbon resource.
Unconventional gas includes tight
gas sands, coalbed methane, and gas
shales.
This first of six articles will describe
the growth of the resource during the
past decade. The remaining articles in
the series will cover:

• Importance of technology progress
for unconventional gas.
• Economics for unconventional gas.
• Outlook for unconventional gas.
These articles will show that the
US is not running out of domestic
unconventional gas resources. Rather,
the nature of the remaining undevel-

is shifting towards more challenging
reservoir settings. Continuing and even
accelerating progress in technology will
be essential to develop this remaining
resource base efficiently and economically.
The recent formation of the gas technology institute called RPSEA (Research

America) prompts
optimism that investments in unconventional gas research

(R&D) will rebound
and technology
progress will, once
again, keep ahead of resource depletion.

except in the past year) have increased

Should natural gas prices decline and
remain at $4-5/Mcf (Henry Hub spot

course, with a drop in gas prices, well

decrease, and the associated loss in gas
production might then provide a price
rebound, unless low-cost LNG imports
fill the gap. ✦

A newly developed
model accurately predicts
solubility of hydrocarbon
components in methanol.
Gas Processing
Quantifying the
absorption of hydrocarbons, primarily methane and ethane,
in methanol is critical in minimizing hydrocarbon losses or optimizing
hydrocarbon recovery,
depending on the objective of the process.
This article presents
model results for an
accurate prediction
of solubility of light

alkanes in methanol, in which the obtained results of the proposed method
have been compared with experimental
data showing good agreement between
reported experimental data with the
model results.
The average absolute deviation is
1.5289%.

HC solubility

In gas processing, methanol is commonly injected into gas streams to
inhibit hydrate formation. After chilling
and separation from the hydrocarbon
phases, the aqueous methanol phase is
usually stored in atmospheric pressure
tanks for disposal.

The prediction of light alkanes’ solubility in methanol is usually based on
use of the pure component solubilities
and the mole fraction of the components in the mixture. In most cases,
however, the current models may be
insufficient.
The goal of the work presented here
is to contribute to the modeling and
understanding of methanol solubility
behavior of light alkanes. Using this
simple model, we explain the observed
solubility behavior and compare results
with experimental data.1

Model
An easy-to-use model predicts the
solubility of methane and ethane components in methanol.2 Equation 1 (see

accompanying box
on p. 40) presents
the correlation
for predicting the solubility of solutes
in which four coefficients correlate the
mole fraction of individual components
and reduced partial pressure of the
component.
Equations 2-4 calculate the required
coefficients for Equation 1; Equations 6
and 7 convert solute and solvent mole
fraction to volumetric dimensions.
This model only needs data to tune
the coefficients and accurately predict a
wide range of data.

Results
Table 1 presents the obtained
results of the model for determining

103
C2 partial pressure, KPa

the solubility of methane and ethane
components in methanol with the
experimental data. As can be seen, the
average absolute deviation for model
is 1.5289%. The proposed method is
therefore accurate in predicting the
solubility of light alkanes in methanol.
Figs. 1a and 1b illustrate the solubility trends of methane components in
methanol at different temperatures and
pressures, applying the model from Reference 2 and in molar and volumetric
dimensions.
Figs. 2a and 2b show the solubility of ethane in methanol at different

US oil pipeline operators saw their
net profits rebound in 2006, the more
than $3.7 billion earned marking an
increase of almost 18%, following a
more than 7% dip in 2005. Oil pipeline
operators’ profits equaled nearly 44% of
revenue.
Natural gas pipeline operators,
meanwhile, saw their net profits continue to grow, rising almost 4% to top

US pipeline data
At the end of this article, two large
tables (beginning on p. 59) offer a variety of data for US oil and gas pipeline
companies: revenue, income, volumes
transported, miles operated, and investments in physical plants. These data are
gathered from annual reports filed with
FERC by regulated oil and natural gas
pipeline companies for the previous
calendar year.
Data are also gathered from periodic
filings with FERC by those regulated
natural gas pipeline companies seeking
FERC approval to expand capacity. OGJ
keeps a record of these filings for each
12-month period ending June 30.
Combined, these data enable an
analysis of the US regulated interstate
pipeline system.
• Annual reports. Companies that
FERC determines to be involved in interstate movement of oil or natural gas
for a fee are jurisdictional to FERC, must
apply to FERC for approval of transportation rates, and therefore must file a
FERC annual report: Form 2 or 2A for
major or nonmajor, respectively, natural
gas pipelines; Form 6 for oil (crude or
product) pipelines.
The distinction between “major”
and “nonmajor” is defined by FERC and
appears as a note at the end of the table
listing all FERC-regulated natural gas
pipeline companies for 2006 at the end

single most expensive per-mile item.
Higher-cost labor also affected the
balance between estimated and actual
costs for both pipeline and compressor
projects completed in the 12 months
ending June 30, 2007. Actual pipeline
costs were very close to estimated costs
in aggregate, but higher than anticipated labor costs more than equaled lower
than expected expenditures in every
other category.
Higher than anticipated labor costs
also contributed almost the entire difference between estimated and actual
compressor costs, with projects completed by June 30, 2007, running more
than $100/hp more expensive than had
been predicted.

of this article (p. 64).
The deadline to file these reports
each year is Apr. 1. For a variety of
reasons, a number of companies miss
that deadline and apply for extensions,
but eventually file an annual report. That
deadline and the numerous delayed
filings explain why publication of this
OGJ report on pipeline economics occurs as late as the third quarter of each
year. Earlier publication would exclude
many companies’ information.

• Periodic reports. When a FERCregulated natural gas pipeline company
wants to modify its system, it must
apply for a “certificate of public convenience and necessity.” This filing must
explain in detail the planned construction, justify it, and––except in certain
instances—specify what the company
estimates construction will cost.
Not all applications are approved.
Not all that are approved are built.

merging or being consolidated out of
existence.
Such changes require that care be
taken in comparing annual US petroleum and natural gas pipeline statistics.
Institution by FERC of the two-tiered
(2 and 2A) classification system for
natural gas pipeline companies after
1984 further complicated comparisons
(OGJ, Nov. 25, 1985, p. 55).
Only major gas pipelines are required to file miles operated in a given
year. The other companies may indicate
miles operated but are not specifically
required to do so.
For several years after 1984, many
non-majors did not describe their
systems. But filing descriptions of their
systems has become standard, and most
provide miles operated.

Reports for 2006 show an increase
in FERC-defined major gas pipeline
companies: 73 companies of 118 filing
for 2006, from 71 of 112 for 2005.
The FERC made an additional change
to reporting requirements for 1995 for
both crude oil and petroleum products
pipelines.
Exempt from requirements to
prepare and file a Form 6 were those
pipelines with operating revenues at or
less than $350,000 for each of the 3
preceding calendar years.
These companies must now file only
an “Annual Cost of Service Based Analysis Schedule,” which provides only total
annual cost of service, actual operating
revenues, and total throughput in both
deliveries and barrel-miles.
In 1996 major natural gas pipeline

companies were no longer required to
report miles of gathering and storage
systems separately from transmission.
Thus, total miles operated for gas
pipelines consist almost entirely of
transmission mileage. To continue to
convey a 10-year trend, Table 1 has been
adjusted to reflect only transmission
mileage operated since 1995.
FERC-regulated natural gas and oil
pipeline mileage increased in 2006 after
having decreased in 2005 (Table 1). Final data show an increase of more than
9,000 miles, or nearly 3%.
This increase in majors-operated
transmission pipeline mileage came
largely on the back of a 13.73% increase in products mileage.

Rankings; activity
Major natural gas pipeline companies in 2006 saw operating revenues
increase by more than $778 million or
nearly 5% from 2005. The results were
roughly similar when both major and
nonmajor pipelines are considered, and
in both cases grew in comparison to
the $613 million move, more than 4%,
seen for majors in 2005 from 2004.
This jump in revenues once again
translated into the highest net incomes
yet seen for either majors or all companies combined. Income for majors improved by more than 4%, or more than
$160.5 million; with increases seen

for all companies in 2006 of nearly the
same 4%.
Income as a percent of revenues for
natural gas pipeline companies, however, slipped to 23.45% in 2006 from
23.59% in 2005, breaking a string of
five straight annual increases.
Oil pipelines saw even healthier
gains in both revenues and income.
Revenues increased by nearly $600 million or 7.6%, more than reversing the
declines seen in 2005, while incomes
rose more than $666.6 million or
21.7%, wiping out both the 7.4% decline seen in 2005 and the 4.2% decline
of 2004.
Products deliveries for 2006 via
pipeline rose 43.7 million bbl or 0.7%,
only partially offsetting the losses seen
in 2005. Crude oil deliveries, in contrast, were relatively flat. Throughput

measured in million bbl-miles (bblmile: 1 bbl moving 1 mile) increased
roughly 1.5%, by more than 51 billion
bbl-miles, led by product throughput
rising by more than 43.5 billion bblmiles, or 2.3%
OGJ uses the FERC annual report
data to rank the top 10 pipeline companies in three categories (miles operated,
trunkline traffic, and operating income)
for oil-pipeline companies and three
categories (miles operated, gas transported for others, and net income) for
natural gas pipeline companies.
Positions in these rankings shift year
to year, reflecting normal fluctuations in
companies’ activities and fortunes. But
also, because these companies comprise
such a large portion of their respective
groups, the listings provide snapshots of
overall industry trends and events.
Company financial data for all companies, not just the majors in both types
52

of pipeline service, provide a view of
the ongoing condition of these industries (Fig. 1; Table 3).
For all natural gas pipeline companies, for example, net income as a
portion of operating revenues fell in
2006 to 23.45%, after having risen
for 5 straight years to reach 23.59% in
2005. Income as a portion of operating
revenues stood at 15.59% in 2001.
The percentage of income in operating revenues for oil pipelines had been
hovering in the mid-20s for the first 5
years of the 1990s; for the last 10 years,
however, it pushed first into the 30s,
reaching almost 39% in 2001, and was
in the 40s from 2002-04 (43%, 45%,
and 41%, respectively).
Income as a percent of revenues retreated from these highs in 2005, dropping to 39%, but rebounded strongly in
2006, reaching nearly 44%.
Another measure of company per-

formance and health is provided by a
calculation of return on investment: net
income as a portion of gas-plant investment. This traced the slight decline
seen in income as a portion of revenue,
moving to 4.55% following 4 consecutive years of gains that saw it top out at
4.6%. Even so, it remains close to the
4.7% levels last seen in 1998.
For oil pipelines, net income as
a portion of investment in carrier
property in 2006 resumed an upward
trend begun in 1999, rising to 11.5%
after having dipped to 10.4% in 2005.
Income as part of investment in carrier
property in 2004 stood at 11.4%, having risen steadily toward that level from
6.8% in 1998.
Major and nonmajor natural gas
pipelines in 2006 reported an industry gas-plant investment of more than
$88.3 billion, the highest level ever,
up from nearly $84 billion in 2005,

In their new book, authors Michael D. Tusiani and Gordon
Shearer, using everyday language and real-world examples,
present LNG as the most viable energy answer to the everincreasing global demand for natural gas.

Even the most conservative estimates suggest that the
demand for LNG internationally will double by 2020, and
billions of dollars will be needed for the infrastructure
investment.
The authors’ straightforward explanation of a complex
industry proves that LNG can deliver a critical link in the
energy demands of international economies.

spending 2005 and 2004 relatively
flat near $29.5 billion. This plateau
followed a steep drop of nearly 8%
between 2003 and 2004.
OGJ for several years has tracked carrier-property investment by five crude
oil pipeline and five products pipeline
companies chosen as representative in
terms of physical systems and expenditures (Table 2). Starting in 2003, we
added the base carrier-property investment to allow for comparisons among
the anonymous companies.
The five crude oil pipeline companies in 2006 increased their overall
investment in carrier property by more
than $38.4 million, or 1.2%; the same
grouping of companies increased overall investment in carrier property by
nearly $108 million, or 3.6%, in 2005.
One of the five companies has lowered

its investment in carrier property for
the past 2 years, despite the increases
made by the group overall. A similar
group of companies decreased investment in carrier property by 2.4% in
2004.
The five products pipeline companies increased overall investment in carrier property in 2006 by $182 million,
or 3.39%, following a more modest
$127 million, or 2.4%, increase in
2005 and a $509 million (nearly 11%)
increase in 2004.
Comparisons of data in Table 2 with
previous years’ must be done with
caution: In 1998, a major crude oil
pipeline company listed there merged
with two other large pipeline companies. More transactions have followed,
including the 2004 sale of significant
assets by a major crude line also listed

on the table, making comparisons with
previous years’ data difficult.
Investment by the five product pipeline companies in 2006 was more than
$5.5 billion and continued a return to
growth that started in 2003 when investment of more than $4.7 billion was
up from 2002’s $4.5 billion level.
Fig. 2 illustrates the investment split
in the crude oil and products pipeline
companies.

Applications to FERC by regulated
interstate natural gas pipeline companies to modify certain systems must,
except in certain instances, provide
estimated costs of these modifications

Actual cost data must be filed within 6 months following commissioning of installed compression equipment.

estimated costs can indicate levels of
construction activity over 2-4 years.
OGJ has been doing that since this report began almost 50 years ago.
Tables 4 and 5 show companies’ estimates during the period July 1, 2006,
to June 30, 2007, for what it will cost
to construct a pipeline or install new or
additional compression.
These tables cover a variety of locations, pipeline sizes, and compressorhorsepower ratings.
Not all projects that are proposed are
56

approved. And not all projects that are
approved are eventually built.
Applications filled in the 12 months
ending June 30, 2007, remained strong
following a marked rebound in the construction of future gas pipelines along
the US interstate system in 2005 and
similar levels in 2006:
• More than 2,000 miles of pipeline
were proposed for land construction,
and 17.7 miles for offshore work. The
land level is up from both the more
than 1,450 miles proposed in 2006 and

the 1,700 miles proposed in 2005. The
offshore proposals were up from the
6.23 miles proposed in 2006, but still
well below the 2005 total of 92 miles.
• New or additional compression
proposed by the end of June 2007
reached more than 713,000 hp, continuing the upward momentum seen
in 2006 when proposed horsepower
more than tripled, reaching in excess of
583,000 hp from the nearly 175,000
hp envisioned by the pipelines in 2005
(Table 5).

Special Report

Putting the continued rebound in US
gas pipeline construction in some perspective, Table 4 lists 25 land-pipeline
construction “spreads,” or mileage segments, and 1 marine project, compared
with:
• 42 land and 1 marine project
(OGJ, Sept. 11, 2006, p. 46).
• 56 land and 4 marine projects
(OGJ, Sept. 12, 2005, p. 50).
• 15 land and 0 marine projects
(OGJ, Aug. 23, 2004, p. 60).
• 37 land and 3 marine projects
(OGJ, Sept. 8, 2003, p. 60).
• 83 land and 3 marine projects
(OGJ, Sept. 16, 2002, p. 52).
• 49 land and 2 marine projects
(OGJ, Sept. 3, 2001, p. 66).
• 115 land and 6 marine projects
(OGJ, Sept. 4, 2000, p. 68).
Further, of the 25 land pipeline projects applied for, 22 are for new pipeline
as opposed to looping or replacement
mileage. And of these 22, 12 are for
pipeline of 50 miles or more in length,
with 8 of these being for projects over
100 miles long (and 7 of the 8 of 42in. OD).
For the 12 months ending June 30,
2007, the 25 land projects would cost
more than $5.6 billion, more than
twice the estimated cost of the 42 projects proposed in 2006.
The number and nature of these
filings, pending actual progress on the
projects themselves, continue progress
in addressing the infrastructural needs
associated with anticipated US natural
gas demand growth.
Projects’ cost projections indicate
much about where companies believe
unit construction costs ($/mile) are
headed. It is telling that the number and
scale of projects remain strong despite
high costs.
For proposed US gas pipeline projects 2006-07, the average land cost was
$2.775 million/mile; in 2005-06, the
average land cost was $1.92 million/
mile; for 2004-05 the average land cost
was $2.2 million/mile; for 2003-04 the
average land cost was $1.7 million/mile;
and for the 2002-03 period the average
land cost was $1.28 million/mile.

ending June 30, 2007. Fig. 7, for the
same period, depicts how total actual
costs ($/mile) for each category compare with estimated costs.
Per-mile pipeline construction costs
for completed projects jumped by more
than 86%, led by higher than estimated
labor costs. It cost roughly the same
amount to build a total of 317.84 miles
of pipeline in the 12 months ending
June 30, 2007, as it did to build 594
miles of pipeline in the year-earlier period. Material costs were lower, in line
with the smaller mileage constructed,
with both miscellaneous and ROW
categories relatively flat.
Actual costs were only 1.2% higher
than projected costs for the 12 months
ending June 30, 2007, as some increase
in the price of labor had been anticipated, just not the amount that occurred.
Some of these projects may have
been proposed and even approved
much earlier than the 1-year survey
period. Others may have been filed for,
approved, and built during the survey
period. If a project was reported in
construction spreads in its initial filing,
that’s how it is broken out in Table 4.
Completed projects’ cost data, however,
are usually reported to FERC for an entire filing, usually but not always separating pipeline from compressor-station
(or metering site) costs and lumping
several diameters together.
The 12 months ending June 30
saw more than 96,000 hp of new or
additional compression completed,
continuing recent declines that saw
nearly 106,000 hp completed in 2006,
and 153,000 hp of new or additional
compression were reported in 2005 vs.
468,000 hp in 2004.
More than a fifth of the 2006-07
horsepower was from a single project.
Overall, actual land gas pipeline
construction costs came in less than
$40,000/mile above estimated costs.
Table 8 shows a similar trend between
installed and estimated compression
costs, with actual costs higher than
estimated and the largest discrepancy
seen in labor costs ($431/hp estimated
vs. $676/hp actual). ✦

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

These three nitrogen generator units
increase the firm’s fleet in the UK and
Norway to 37 units. Equipment meets
requirements set by the UK and Norwegian oil and gas industries. A main feature
is the reduced lifting load possible when
the system is moved in two lighter lifts, as
opposed to one heavy lift that may be difficult or impossible in many installations,
the firm points out. The power pack and
liquid N2 converter each weigh 7,500 kg.
The soundproof units comply with
ATEX 94/9/EC and are manufactured
to CE Standard. Every system features
Pyroban exhaust gas cooling systems, inlet

Database of offshore oil seeps now covers Arctic frontier
Mapping of offshore oil slicks in the
Arctic area covering more than 2 million
sq km has been completed by this firm.
The area includes the Chukchi Sea,
Beaufort Sea, Mackenzie Delta, Hudson
Strait, Greenland, and Outer Rockall areas.
The Global Seeps database, covering
more than 60 million sq km of offshore
basins, has been constructed by interpreting radar satellite data and screening
offshore basins worldwide to a water
depth of about 3,000 m. The database is
made up of more than 12,300 ERS satellite
equivalent scenes. Mapping covers rigs,
platforms, and ship traffic for a more complete picture of the controls on oil slick
distribution, the company notes.

All-powerful oil
lobby a juvenile
Obama fantasy
There’s a reason Hillary Clinton, in
her race for the Democratic presidential
nomination, is making Barak Obama look
juvenile. He acts that way.
Obama, a US senator from Illinois, has
been disparaging the oil lobby lately.
“The reason that we’re not getting things
done is not because we don’t have good
plans or good policy prescriptions,” Obama
told an audience in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

“The reason is because it’s not our agenda
that’s being moved forward in Washington.
It’s the agenda of the oil companies, the
insurance companies, the drug companies,
the special interests who dominate on a
day-to-day basis in terms of legislative
activity.”
In Waverly, Iowa, the Illinois senator
called cutting oil demand “an urgent moral
challenge” and blamed oil companies for a
lack of government action.
“Americans can’t come and sit at the
table because oil and gas companies have
bought every chair,” he said.
This kind of blather appeals to people
who reﬂexively assume the most sinister
possible interpretation about any event but
who generally ignore facts.
To such people, the existence of a potent, evil oil lobby seems not only plausible
but likely. Facts, however, indicate otherwise.
If an all-powerful oil lobby manipulated
events in Washington, DC, the worst energy
legislation in decades would not now await
action in a House-Senate conference.
If an all-powerful oil lobby had existed
in years past, drilling would be under way
on the coastal plain of the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, off the East and
West Coasts, in the eastern Gulf of Mexico,
and on inaccessible federal land in the US
West. By now, some or all of these areas
might be producing oil and gas.
If an all-powerful oil lobby controlled
events in Washington, DC, several modern
reﬁneries might be under construction or
on stream where none exist now, and existing reﬁneries wouldn’t be under stress.
The fact is that no such lobby exists.
Yes, the oil and gas industry has a lobby. All
industries have lobbies. But the suggestion
that the oil lobby accomplishes more than
occasionally keeping the government from
acting on its worst impulses is laughable.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Facilities escape damage from Dean
For all of the initial fears it generated among traders and Gulf Coast residents,
Hurricane Dean inﬂicted apparently little damage to or disruptions of oil and gas
operations in the Gulf of Mexico.
It wasn’t for want of effort. When Dean hit the Yucatan Peninsula on Aug. 21 with
165 mph winds gusting to 200 mph, it was a rare Category 5 hurricane and the thirdmost powerful Atlantic hurricane to make landfall since record-keeping began in the
1850s. But as usually happens when hurricanes move across land, Dean weakened
to a Category 1 storm before it reached the Bay of Campeche, where Petroleos
Mexicanos has 66% of its oil production. Its projected path was through the productive Cantarell oil ﬁeld, and Pemex evacuated more than 14,000 workers from 140 offshore facilities and shut in production of 2.65 million b/d of oil and 2.63 bcfd of gas.
Further north, the Minerals Management Service reported 24 of 101 drilling rigs
and 34 of 834 manned production platforms in the US sector of the Gulf of Mexico
were evacuated. Shut-in production topped out Aug. 21 at 43,881 b/d of oil, or 3.4%
of total crude production from federal leases in the gulf; and 140 MMcfd—1.83%
of total gas production. By that date, Shell Oil Co. was already returning workers
offshore and bringing shut in production on stream. By Aug. 24, MMS reported
only one production platform was still without a crew, while 2,600 b/d of oil and 1.3
MMcfd of gas remained shut in.
Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, said,
“The precautionary closing of the Mexican ﬁelds and ports will cause delays in crude
supply to US Gulf reﬁneries, but the system is accustomed to having weather delays
in Mexico, and this will not cause a state of emergency, especially when crude stocks
in the US Gulf are at multiyear high for this time of the year.”
Shell also reduced production rates at the 340,000 b/d Deer Park reﬁnery outside
Houston in anticipation of interrupted crude supplies due to Hurricane Dean. “There
is the potential for delayed oil shipments due to the weather so we are monitoring
the situation to determine its potential impact on our operations,” said Shell ofﬁcials
Aug. 22.
US inventories
Energy prices fell Aug. 20-21 when it became evident that Hurricane Dean was going to miss the US sector and strike the Mexican sector of the Gulf of Mexico. Prices
continued to fall Aug. 22 after the Energy Information Administration reported a surprise build in commercial US crude inventories and a continued decline in gasoline
stocks during the week ended Aug. 17. Crude stocks increased 1.9 million bbl to 337.1
million bbl while gasoline inventories dropped 5.7 million bbl to 196.2 million bbl.
Distillate fuel inventories increased 1.3 million bbl to 129 million bbl (OGJ Online,
Aug. 22, 2007). The new front-month crude contract closed at the lowest price level
in 2 months, while natural gas dropped 10% to a 10-month low in anticipation of
increased storage.
Jakob said, “With higher than expected crude oil imports and lower than expected gasoline stocks, the US weekly statistics provided two surprises with opposing directional inﬂuences. Products cracks have improved, but on crude oil the West
Texas Intermediate long-dated time spreads have weakened, and the WTI premium
to [North Sea] Brent is weakening on the slight increase in Cushing, Okla., stocks.
The natural gas ﬂat price [for the September contract] has now lost 20.4% in 3 days.”
Jakob said, “The weekly change [in gasoline stocks was] so large that there could
have been an early rush from retailers to ﬁll in before the expected storm in order to
not be caught short into the Labor Day weekend. High imports of crude oil (the highest since mid-May) have stopped the crude stock hemorrhage and are maintaining
them at multiyear high for the season.”
Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London, said, “Despite market fears about
demand, US gasoline demand has hit a new all-time record in the latest weekly data.
Demand for August as a whole is neck-and-neck with July’s all-time monthly record,
with gasoline inventories remaining very tight.”
On Aug. 23, EIA reported the injection of 23 bcf of natural gas into US underground storage for the week ended Aug. 17, compared with injections of 21 bcf
the prior week and 57 bcf during the same period a year ago. US gas storage now
exceeds 2.9 tcf, up 77 bcf from last year and 333 bcf more than the 5-year average.

Wasting money for CP?
What kind of question is this?
Most in the pipeline industry agree that
cathodic protection (CP) is the smart way to
provide backup corrosion protection on
underground pipelines.
But consider: If you use solid film backed
corrosion coatings, you may be wasting
money by adding CP to the pipeline.
There is a common sense reason for this
statement. CP systems protect pipelines by
delivering electrical current to the steel
surface. Solid film back corrosion coatings
have the property of resistivity, which
means they block electrical current. This
blocking effect is called cathodic shielding.
The phenomenon of cathodic shielding, or
blocking of protective CP current, has been
the subject of dozens of technical papers
since the mid 1980’s. You can review a cross
section of these papers on Polyguard’s
website.You can also view a 10 minute
explanation of the cathodic shielding process.

Worldwide, we estimate that over half of
pipelines are being coated with solid film
back coatings, such as shrink sleeves,
tapes, and 2 or 3 layer systems. Most of
these lines have CP systems. These are the
operators who may be wasting their
money on CP. Moreover, many install
shielding coatings on girth welds, the most
vulnerable area for corrosion.
Two corrosion coatings are proven to be
non-shielding, and allow passage of
protective CP currents. One of these
coatings is FBE. The other is Polyguard
RD-6.
NACE Standard RP0169-2002 states:
“Materials....that create electrical
shielding should not be used on the
pipeline” 1.
49 CFR §192.461 states: “External
protective coating...must...have properties
compatible with any supplemental cathodic

If you are concerned that your
organization is behind this curve, we
recommend:
• Visit

and review the large body of information
about shielding problems.
• Talk to operators who have used
Polyguard’s RD-6 system. (There are
many) Ask them if they know of any
serious corrosion or SCC ever found
under RD-6. (We don’t, even after 19
years and thousands of installations).
Have someone in your organization attend
the NACE course “Coatings in Conjunction
with Cathodic Protection”.

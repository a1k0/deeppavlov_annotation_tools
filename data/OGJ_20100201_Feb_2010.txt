COVER
The drilling rig is on an unconventional gas well in the Woodford
shale play of southeastern Oklahoma. Newfield Exploration Co.,
Houston, operator of the well, has drilled more than 300 horizontal wells in the play, with some of these wells having laterals
greater than 9,000 ft.The first article in OGJ’s Practical Drilling
Technology special, starting on p. 42, describes rigs one drilling
contractor has built for unconventional plays. A second article
discusses a drilling fluid design successfully used in an exploration well in Kazakhstan with a thick salt layer. Cover photo from
Newfield. Photo above from Nabors Driling USA LP.

LOGGING WHILE DRILLING

The Power of

Samples in hours, not days. And all on LWD.
Until now, retrieving formation fluid samples during the drilling
operation just couldn’t be done. Sperry Drilling services introduces
the GeoTap® IDS sensor, the peerless fluid identification and
sampling tool that captures truly representative fluid samples
on LWD. And does it in hours, not days.
Perfect for deepwater, the GeoTap IDS sensor can save you
millions in hidden NPT costs routinely incurred with wireline
sampling. And it helps reduce reservoir uncertainty even in the
most complex environments—thanks to timely downhole
capture, surface recovery and identification of multiple samples
of uncontaminated formation fluids.
Samples in hours, not days. To learn more,

General

Interest

Partners block part of Maersk’s acquisition
Maersk Oil said its agreement to buy Devon Energy Production Co. LP’s interests in the Gulf of Mexico Cascade and St. Malo
fields is off because partners declared preferential purchase rights
in those fields.
Stakes in those two fields were part of a $1.3 billion transaction
involving three fields that Devon announced last year (OGJ, Nov.
23, 2009, p. 34).
When the transaction was first announced, Maersk and Devon
said the deal was subject to a waiver of preferential purchase rights
by other partners in the fields. Maersk might still buy a stake in
Jack field from Devon.
In a news release issued late Jan. 22, Maersk said a partner exercised its preferential rights at Cascade field, where Brazil’s staterun Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) and Devon each own 50%
interest. Maersk also said partners had exercised their rights in St.
Malo field where Devon owns 25% interest. Petrobras operates
Cascade field.
Raymond James & Associates analysts reported Chevron Corp.
and Statoil ASA exercised their preferential rights in St. Malo field.
Chevron operates St. Malo field.
A Devon spokesman on Jan. 26 told OGJ that talks continue
with Maersk about its existing plans to buy Devon’s 25% interest
in Jack field. Meanwhile, Maersk is in talks with Devon about possibly buying additional gulf assets from Devon that were beyond
the initial three-field transaction.
Raymond James analysts issued a Jan. 26 research note suggesting that Jack field assets “could be taken by Maersk under the
original agreement but may be left at the altar.”

Valero to sell Delaware City assets
Valero Energy Corp., San Antonio, said Jan. 22 that it is in advanced negotiations to sell the assets of its terminal operation and
discontinued operations at its 210,000-b/d Delaware City, Del.,
refinery to PBF Investments LLC, Greenwich, Conn.
Valero last year announced it was permanently closing the refinery, citing financial losses caused by “very poor economic conditions, significant capital spending requirements, and high operating costs.” The refinery shutdown started immediately upon the
announcement (OGJ Online, Nov. 20, 2009).
Bill Klesse, Valero chairman and chief executive officer, said
there is no specific timetable for when negotiations might be completed. Valero has agreed that no removal of process equipment
will take place while negotiations are under way.
PBF Investments is a joint venture of European refinery Petroplus and the US private equity firms of Blackstone Group and First

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Reserve Corp. Reuters reported Petroplus has been interested in
US refining assets since early 2008.
Klesse noted Delaware Gov. Jack Markell has been working
with state economic development officials and Valero to find a
buyer for the Delaware City site.

Kazakhstan asks Kashagan partners to cut costs
Kazakhstan’s state-owned KazMunaiGas (KMG) has proposed
to its partners in the North Caspian Operating Co., which is developing Kashagan oil field, a reduction in spending to $7.4 billion
from the planned $10.4 billion.
In addition to KMG, the consortium includes Total SA, ExxonMobil Corp., ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Eni SPA, and
Inpex.
“We have suggested that this year the expenditures be optimized and, as a result, the budget be cut down by nearly $3
billion. The proposal is now being reviewed by the authorized
agency,” KazMunayGas Pres. Kairgeldy Kabyldin told the country’s
energy ministry, giving no reason for the cut.
However, analyst IHS Global Insight observed that the Kazakh
government and the Kashagan consortium have a “long history”
of strained relations over cost overruns and delays at the Central
Asian state’s flagship offshore project.
After a protracted negotiations, KazMunaiGas doubled its interest in Kashagan, a takeover that analysts said was part of a global
trend by governments to reclaim control over strategic energy assets.
IHS Global Insight noted that Kazmunaigaz raised its stake
to 16.81% as a result of that previous round of “sparring” between the consortium and the government, which pushed back
the timetable for production and agreed on a plan for controlling
costs.
“Nevertheless, with the wild swing in oil prices over the past
18 months, expenditures in the first stage of the project have continued to be a source of friction,” the analyst said, adding that
Kabyldin’s comments “hint that the government is keen to keep
a lid on rising costs again, which are now expected to reach $38
billion by 2014.”
Kabyldin’s comments coincided with reports that Kazakhstan
hopes to resolve a new emerged dispute with a group of foreign
companies led by BG Group and Eni over the huge Karachaganak
gas field this year.
Earlier this month, Kazakhstan’s Prime Minister Karim Masimov said his country was negotiating to purchase a stake in
the Karachaganak gas-condensate project from Karachaganak Petroleum Operating BV (KPO), a consortium of BG, Eni, Chevron
Corp., and OAO Lukoil. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Pay nearly tripled at gulf’s Lucius find

ExxonMobil to expand Iraq’s West Qurna 1 field

An appraisal well 3,200 ft south of an Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. group’s December 2009 Lucius oil and gas discovery in
the ultradeepwater Gulf of Mexico cut nearly three times the pay
thickness of the discovery well.
The updip appraisal well, drilled to about 20,000 ft in 7,100 ft
of water on Keathley Canyon Block 875 some 260 miles off Louisiana, encountered almost 600 net ft of light oil pay with additional
gas-condensate pay in thick subsalt Pliocene and Miocene sands,
Anadarko said. The discovery well found more than 200 ft of pay
(OGJ Online, Dec. 10, 2009).
Anadarko described Lucius as a “major discovery” without giving a resource estimate. Wood Mackenzie Consultants floated an
initial estimate of 150-200 million bbl of oil and natural gas liquids and around 1 tcf recoverable. Lucius is likely large enough for
stand-alone development, the consultant said.
Anadarko said, “The reservoirs are characterized by excellent
porosity and permeability and contain high-quality oil. We anticipate additional appraisal activity in 2010 as we continue to evaluate development options for this very large accumulation.”
Lucius is 70 miles south of infrastructure at the Red Hawk spar
and 7.5 miles east of Chevron’s Buckskin, a 2009 Paleogene discovery (OGJ Online, Feb. 6, 2009).
Anadarko operates Lucius with 50% working interest. Plains
Exploration & Production Co. has 33.33%, and Mariner Energy
Inc. has 16.67%.

ExxonMobil Iraq Ltd. signed an agreement with the Iraq Ministry of Oil to redevelop and expand West Qurna 1 field in southern
Iraq.
The agreement was signed in Baghdad in the presence of the
Iraq Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani and Rob Franklin, president of ExxonMobil upstream ventures. The consortium members
are ExxonMobil as the lead contractor with 60% interest, Oil Exploration Co. (owned by the Iraq government) with 25% interest,
and Royal Dutch Shell PLC with 15% interest.
Franklin said ExxonMobil would continue discussions with
the Iraqi government on other opportunities to help develop the
country’s resources.
As part of the agreement, ExxonMobil will focus on recruitment and development of local employees, development of qualified local vendors for the supply of goods and services, and on
supporting corporate citizenship initiatives in health, education,
and infrastructure.
Two competing consortia—one led by ExxonMobil and the
other by OAO Lukoil—submitted bids that met Iraq’s conditions
for the 8.6 billion bbl West Qurna 1 field, including Iraq’s price
of $1.90/bbl per additional barrel. ExxonMobil proposed an additional 2.1 million b/d, while Lukoil offered 1.5 million b/d for
the field, which now produces 279,000 b/d (OGJ Online, Oct. 19,
2009).

ConocoPhillips, Statoil to explore Chukchi Sea
Multiple pays yield gas in western New York
Gastem Inc., Montreal, found gas in one sand and two shales
with good thickness at its first well in a planned drilling program
on 35,000 acres in western New York.
The Ross-1 vertical well in Otsego County yielded gas from Ordovician Utica shale, Silurian Oneida sand, and Devonian Marcellus shale, the company said. TD is 4,950 ft. The three zones “will
be the subject of extensive programs in the coming months,” the
company said.
Gas flowed on penetration of the Marcellus and was flared at
modest rates from natural fractures. The organic-rich Oakta Creek
and Union Springs members of the Marcellus formation showed
higher permeability than anticipated and were of encouraging
thickness. The Marcellus shale was not stimulated because of the
present regulatory situation.
Oneida flowed at the rate of 2 MMcfd of gas on a 4-hr drillstem
test and has become one of Gastem’s primary targets in the area.
A completion in the Utica shale was performed using the frac
volume approved under current New York state regulations that
authorize use of 80,000 gal of water. This modest vertical frac in
one of the Utica’s three members resulted in a sustained rate of
more than 70 Mcfd over a 24-day test.
Final results of laboratory core analysis for all formations for
the determination of original gas in place and rock properties will
be completed in about a month. When review work is completed, information will include recoverable volumes across the Ross
property and a resource estimate for Gastem’s acreage.

ConocoPhillips and Statoil USA E&P have entered into a deal for
Statoil to acquire 25% working interest in 50 ConocoPhillips leases
acquired in the Chukchi Sea OCS lease sale in 2008.
ConocoPhillips will retain operatorship and majority working
interest in these leases.
Statoil and ConocoPhillips have conducted joint operations for
more than 30 years on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS).
Their NCS operating experience provided both extensive expertise in tackling harsh environments as well as developing new
technology to enhance recovery from existing fields.
“By adding on these leases to the 16 we already have in Chukchi, we have now acquired a sizable acreage portfolio to explore
in the coming years,” said Tony Dore, heading up Statoil’s exploration group in North America.
ConocoPhillips’ initial drilling in the Chukchi Sea is scheduled
for 2012.
In addition to undisclosed financial considerations from
Statoil, ConocoPhillips will also acquire 50% working interest in
16 Statoil-operated Gulf of Mexico leases and acquire all of Statoil’s
25% working interest in five additional gulf leases operated by
ConocoPhillips. All of the involved gulf blocks are in the emerging Lower Tertiary play where ConocoPhillips has participated in
the 2009-announced discoveries Tiber and Shenandoah.

Chevron Australia’s Yellowstone-1 wildcat in permit WA-268-P
in the Greater Gorgon region has intersected a 137-m gas column.
The find follows last year’s discoveries nearby at Satyr-1 and
Achilles-1. All of them bode well in support of Chevron’s plans
to eventually turn the Gorgon-Jansz-Io LNG development into a
five-train project.
At the moment the focus is on three trains and a total of 15
million tonnes/year of LNG. However as the gas reserves build
up with new discoveries, the sights will be lifted to a plant with
greater capacity output.
Separately, Woodside Petroleum Ltd. reported reaching good
gas sands with its Noblige-1 wildcat, which was drilled in permit
WA-404-P in the Greater Pluto field area.
Measurement-while-drilling logs at several levels in the well
have indicated natural gas, one of them over a 300-m gross interval in the intra-Triassic age primary target.
The well is now drilling ahead into deeper targets and Wood-

side will wait until reaching total depth before undertaking a full
evaluation. This will involve a full suite of wireline logs and pressure data to indicate the number of hydrocarbon zones, their size,
and potential.
Nobligwe-1 is close to the previous Martell discovery, which
confirmed a 110-m gas column and the presence of a gas-water
contact in 2009.
The new find is welcome news for Woodside, which is attempting to secure additional gas reserves for the second train
at its Pluto LNG facility proposed for the Burrup Peninsula plant.
Noblige-1 is part of the company’s exploration campaign of up
to 20 wells in the Greater Pluto area that began in October 2009
with the Pelion-1 and Eris-1 wells in WA-34L.
Noblige is being drilled by the Jack Bates semisubmersible rig,
but the next well, Larsen-1, will be drilled with the Maersk Discoverer semisubmersible, as Jack Bates is due for release to Hess
Corp. for its proposed 16-well program in the Carnarvon basin
region off Western Australia. ✦

Chevron proceeds with Papa Terra off Brazil

contract for redevelopment of a giant oil field.
Eni, Occidental Petroleum Corp., and Korea Gas Corp. agreed
with state-owned South Oil Co. and Missan Oil Co. as state partner to redevelop Zubair field near Basra. The companies signed
an initial agreement last November (OGJ Online, Nov. 16, 2009).
Led by Eni, the consortium plans to increase Zubair production from its current level of about 200,000 b/d to 1.2 million b/d
within 6 years and to keep output at that level for 7 years.
The group will earn $2/bbl on incremental production after
output has increased 10%. The agreement includes a cost-recovery
mechanism. Zubair Field Operating Division will manage the rehabilitation and expansion project, staffed mainly by employees
of South Oil Co. Interests are Eni 32.81%, Oxy 23.44%, Korea Gas
18.75%, and Missan Oil 25%.
The ministry describes Zubair as a series of structural traps in a
northwest-southeast trending anticline about 20 km southwest of
the city of Basrah. The field has four domes named Al-Hamar, Shuaiba, Rafidyah, and Safwan. Safwan extends into Kuwait, where
it is known as Abdalli field.
Zubair has produced from the Upper Cretaceous Mishrif formation and upper and lower units of the Lower Cretaceous Zubair
formation, all candidates for redevelopment.
The government recently has signed service contracts for similar work by a group led by ExxonMobil Iraq Ltd. at West Qurna
oil field (first phase) and by Royal Dutch Shell PLC in Majnoon oil
Iraq, Eni group sign Zubair field agreement
field, both giants in southern Iraq (OGJ Online, Jan. 18, 2009, and
The Iraqi government has signed another technical services Jan. 25, 2009). ✦

Chevron Overseas of Brazil Ltd. will proceed with the development of the Papa Terra project, its second deepwater field off
Brazil.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) is the project’s operator and
had announced in January 2009 the suspension of the development because of uncertain market conditions and excessive costs
(OGJ, Jan 26, 2009, Newsletter).
Papa Terra will produce heavy 14-17° gravity oil from Block
BC-20 in the southern Campos basin, about 70 miles off the coast
in 3,900 ft of water. The production facilities will include the
first tension-leg well platform off Brazil. The TLP will connect
to a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel that has a
140,000 bo/d production capacity.
Chevron expects production from Papa Terra to begin in 2013.
Chevron holds a 37.5% interest in the $5.2 billion Papa Terra project and estimates that the field will recover 380 million
bbl of oil. Off Brazil, Chevron started production from Frade in
2009—its first deepwater project—and also holds a 30% nonoperated interest in Maromba field, where work continues to select an
optimal development plan.
In the Santos basin, Chevron holds a 20% nonoperated interest
in Block BS-4, where the company continues to evaluate development plans to commercialize Atlanta and Oliva fields.

VCC feeds vacuum resid to a slurry phase reactor at 200 bar
with an antifoaming agent. Hydrogen bubbles through the slurry
mixture from below. Downstream of the slurry reactor, a separator removes unconverted material and the additive, while lighter
products move to a fixed-bed catalytic hydrotreatment vessel for
removal of nitrogen and sulfur. Typical products are heavy gas oil,
light gas oil, naphtha, and light olefins.
BP says VCC achieves a resid conversion rate of 95%, compared
with slightly above 70% for delayed coking.
In addition, VCC’s liquid yield exceeds 100% because of the
addition of hydrogen, while liquid yields of cokers typically fall
below 80%, BP says. BP acquired the technology when it absorbed

so much work until we pulled it down, and that also significantly
added to the increase in costs.”
Speaking at an energy conference in Port of Spain, Ali said the
refinery upgrade—to be completed by November—was crucial
because its products were increasingly uncompetitive and margins
were declining. He said the upgrade will allow the refinery to
produce more gasoline in its mix and a higher-quality diesel fuel.
Petrotrin also produces 74,000 boe/d, and Ali plans to drill
an additional 18 developmental wells to increase production and
make it more reliable.
He revealed Petrotrin will undertake 215 sq km of 3D seismic
on land that could lead to additional drilling for oil.
Petrotrin has 446.7 million boe of proved reserves.

Cleanup progresses in Port Arthur oil spill
The US Coast Guard said about half the 450,000 gal of crude oil
spilled into the Sabine Neches Waterway at Port Arthur, Tex., on
Jan. 23 had been recovered, evaporated, or dispersed by Jan. 25.
The spill occurred when the 95,660-dwt Eagle Otome tanker
collided with a barge after apparently losing power.
Although the incident forced closure of the waterway, the four
major refineries in the Port Arthur-Beaumont area were reported
to be operating at normal rates. Owners and capacities are Total
SA, 174,000 b/d; Valero Energy Corp., 250,000 b/d; ExxonMobil
Corp., 345,000 b/d; and Motiva Enterprises, 285,000 b/d.
USCG said the spill affected 9 miles of shoreline. It said cleanup involved 27 skimming vessels and 36 vessels deploying and
working 59,800 ft of boom. The 210-ft Texas Responder recovery
vessel was on scene. Lightering was planned for the Eagle Otome
and two barges involved in the collision, which were being
pushed by the towing vessel Dixie Vengeance.

Indonesia targets market for LNG sales
Indonesia’s state-owned PT Pertamina and state gas distributor
PT Perusahaan Gas have found domestic buyers for most of the
liquefied natural gas to be produced from their planned floating
terminal in Teluk Jakarta Bay.
“In 2011 we require huge amounts of LNG to fuel our power
generators and we will probably absorb 80% of LNG supplied
through the floating terminal,” said Dahlan Iskan, recently appointed as president director for state power company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).
“We also asked Pertamina to immediately begin the construction of the terminal because the supply gas for PLN will depend on
the terminal,” said Dahlan, who added that a failure to access LNG
would force the firm to use gasoline, “which is more expensive.”
12

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

In 2009, PLN predicted it would require 2,233 MMscfd in 2010,
about 1,300 MMscfd more than the available supply of about 900
MMscfd. But the firm sees increased demand growth, saying it
will need 2,474 MMscfd by 2012, while the domestic supply may
only be 1,781 MMscfd.
Meanwhile, most of the remaining supply from the Teluk Jakarta site also will go to the domestic market, according to Evita H.
Legowo, director general for oil and gas at the Energy and Mineral
Resources Ministry. She said “state fertilizer company PT Pupuk
Kujang will absorb 18% of supply from the LNG terminal.”
The Teluk Jakarta LNG terminal, 70% owned by Pertamina and
30% by PGN, will eventually have a capacity of 500 MMscfd, and
is expected to take $200 million of investment before going online by September 2011.

Chevron signs LNG deals with Kyushu Electric
Chevron Australia has signed multiple agreements with Japanese power utility Kyushu Electric Power Co. Inc. for delivery
of LNG from Chevron’s Gorgon and Wheatstone gas projects off
Western Australia.
Under the heads of agreements, Kyushu will receive 300,000
tonnes/year of LNG from Gorgon for 15 years. Kyushu will also
acquire 1.83% of Chevron’s equity share in the Wheatstone field
licenses and 1.37% interest in the proposed Wheatstone gas processing facilities to be developed onshore at Ashburton North near
Onslow.
In addition Kyushu will purchase 700,000 tpy of LNG from
Wheatstone for 20 years. This sales volume is over and above the
LNG that Kyushu will lift as an equity partner in the project, so
that Kyushu’s total uplift will be 800,000 tpy from Wheatstone.
Start of gas production from Gorgon is expected in 2014. Final
investment decision on Wheatstone is expected in 2011. ✦

Gulf current under study

Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
Benjamin Franklin was the first
scientist to study and map the Gulf
Stream, measuring wind speeds and
current depths, speeds, and temperatures during four crossings of the
Atlantic in the late 18th century. More
than 300 years later, scientists are still
probing the secrets of that “river” of
warm water flowing north from the
West Indies, along the East Coast of
North America, and east across the
Atlantic to Europe.
The US Minerals Management
Service recently released a study of the
Loop Current (LC) and Loop Current
Eddies (LCEs) in the eastern gulf aimed
at better forecasting the effect on hurricanes and oil and gas activity in deep
waters.

The LC and hurricanes
Part of the Gulf Stream, the horseshoe-shaped LC flows clockwise, transferring warm subtropical waters from
the Caribbean through the Yucatan
Straits into the Gulf of Mexico. It then
loops west and south before exiting
to the east through the Florida Straits.
The deepest levels of warm water in
the gulf are associated with the LC. The
current meanders in its journey, sometimes penetrating deeper into the gulf,
sometimes less, and the temperature of
its waters is sometimes higher than at
other times.
Random eddies or LC “rings” occasionally separate from the LC and
16

slowly drift west to splash upon the
shores of Texas or Mexico. The current
and its eddies can be determined by
measuring the level of the sea’s surface.
The flow is somewhat higher than the
surrounding ocean waters because of
the warm water it carries. On Sept. 21,
2005, the surface level of the LC and
eddies was 24 in. above surrounding
waters when Hurricane Rita intensified
to Category 5 strength as it passed over
those warmer waters.
The LC apparently has stimulated
some of the biggest storms ever to blow
through the gulf. In 1969, Camille was
already a Category 3 hurricane when
it rounded the western tip of Cuba and
charged north directly over the LC, rapidly intensifying into the top Category
5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane
Scale before smashing into Mississippi.
Hurricane Allen ramped up to Category
5 over the current but weakened over
cooler waters before it hit Texas in
1980. Hurricane Andrew crossed the
LC and grew into a Category 5 storm
before it smashed into Florida in 1992.
In 1995, Hurricane Opal escalated
from Category 1 to Category 4 in 14 hr
after encountering a warm-water eddy.
That’s when meteorologists first recognized the pivotal role of warm water
in strengthening hurricane intensity,
according to an Oct. 4, 2005, online
article in Science Daily.
Hurricane Ivan—the 10th most
intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded—twice crossed the LC in 2004,
growing to the size of Texas over those
warm waters. In 2005 when the LC
extended deep into the gulf, it boosted
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, respectively, to the sixth and fourth-strongest
storms ever, and it jacked up the

weaker Hurricane Wilma to a Category
3 before it blew into Florida that same
year.
In 2008, Hurricane Gustav encountered the current, but the LC was
shorter and cooler that year with cooler
gulf waters between it and Louisiana,
so the storm remained Category 3.
After Hurricane Katrina and a week
before Hurricane Rita, scientists deployed various technologies in the gulf
to measure salinity, currents, and water
temperature to 3,300 ft in another
study aimed at determining the paths
and intensity changes of hurricanes in
their last hours over open water.

Latest study
The latest 2-year study by MMS
in conjunction with Louisiana State
University’s Coastal Marine Institute
involved deployment in the eastern gulf
of an 11,800-ft deepwater mooring cable to supplement information gathered
from a previous 3-year deployment.
The mooring data suggest the LC and
LCEs that dominate upper-layer circulation in the eastern gulf also influence
the deeper currents in those water.
Alexis Lugo-Fernandez, the MMS
physical oceanographer responsible
for the study, noted that a method to
transmit significant energy in the form
of heat to deep water in the gulf during
the 2005 hurricane season was observed during this study.
As sea levels rise near the center of
tropical storms, the resulting higher
pressure causes a small but measurable
increase in temperature at all water
depths. Lugo-Fernandez said, “Simply due to the large number of storm
occurrences within the [gulf], these
findings represent an important process
for transmitting energy to the deep
water.” ✦

Another IPCC setback
A single mistake shouldn’t sink a boatload of science. Bias, however, will corrode any hull.
Both interpretations have been applied to a
mistake by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concerning glaciers in the Himalayas.
IPCC is the volunteer scientific group set up in
1989 by the United Nations Environment Program
and World Meteorological Organization to assess
climate science and support policy-making. In its
four-volume Fourth Assessment Report of 2007,
IPCC said Himalayan glaciers faced a “very high”
likelihood of disappearing by 2035—“and perhaps
sooner.” This month it retracted the warning.

Broader assessment
The wayward paragraph, IPCC said, contained
“poorly substantiated estimates” of the melting
rate and date when the glaciers would be gone. “In
drafting the paragraph in question,” it said, “the
clear and well-established standards of evidence,
required by the IPCC procedures, were not applied
properly.” Nevertheless, IPCC added, the general
conclusion of the report is “robust, appropriate, and
entirely consistent with the underlying science and
the broader IPCC assessment.”
The broader assessment, of course, is that most
observed warming since the middle of the 20th
century “very likely” results from human activity
and threatens, among other things, glaciers and water supplies. “Widespread mass losses from glaciers
and reductions in snow cover over recent decades
are projected to accelerate throughout the 21st
century, reducing water availability, hydropower
potential, and changing seasonality of flows in
regions supplied by meltwater from major mountain regions (e.g. Hindu-Kush, Himalaya, Andes),
where more than one sixth of the world population
currently lives,” IPCC says.
Scary stuff, this. A sixth of the world without
enough water to drink. Given the dire potential
and mass of scientific arcana in the IPCC’s report,
how can anyone worry about a lone blooper? That,
of course, is the question raised by promoters of
urgent and costly precautions against the dangerous
warming they believe to be looming.
Yes, the Himalayan mistake represents a solo
lapse in a mammoth project. But it also fits a pattern.
In 2001, IPCC’s Third Assessment Report
prominently featured the infamous “hockey-stick”
18

reconstruction of proxy temperature data from
the Northern Hemisphere. The name describes
the shape of a graph that seemed to show many
centuries of stability in global average temperature
until the time of industrialization, when temperatures began to zoom. The hockey-stick had powerful persuasive effect. It offered a simple, graphic
rebuke to scientists suggesting that the uptrend in
temperature over the last century resulted from
natural cycles. After statistical analysis behind the
graph came under challenge, though, IPCC felt
obliged in its 2007 assessment report to moderate
its conclusions and present a range of reconstructions of historical temperature data, many of which
do indicate temperature oscillations before the
Industrial Age.
More recently, scientists responsible for data central to IPCC’s computer modeling have been shown
to have manipulated numbers and suppressed
findings of anyone resistant to their push for political warming responses. Like the hockey stick and
Himalayan-glacier glitch, controversy over those
apparent failures of integrity has been dismissed as
a sideshow staged by unholy skeptics, a tactical distraction from a scientific consensus supporting the
need for prompt action against warming, whatever
the cost.

The consensus
To the extent scientific consensus does or even
can exist, however, IPCC is it. And IPCC consistently errs on the frightening side in its summaries
for policy-makers. Scientists involved in past assessment reports have complained about the political
spin the summaries give their material. Even the
way IPCC describes its initial task asserts conclusions: “Prepare a comprehensive review and recommendations with respect to the state of knowledge
of the science of climate change, social and economic impact of climate change, possible response
strategies, and elements for inclusion in a possible
future international convention on climate.”
A group with such a view of itself isn’t likely to
conclude that observed warming is mostly natural
and that governmental restraint will remain the
best policy option until more is known. The record,
in fact, increasingly suggests an activist bias. Until
that changes, IPCC will look like a pressure group
with shrinking credibility. ✦

Barring any substantial drops in
crude prices, corporate credit profiles
should remain in line with 2009 levels
across the oil and gas industry this year,
except for the refining and service and
supply businesses, reported Fitch Ratings in its 2010 oil and gas outlook.
Inflationary expectations and “significant amounts of liquidity” injected
in global financial markets will likely
keep crude prices above levels
justified by supply and demand
fundamentals, with improved
cash flows and credit profiles
for upstream, oil-focused companies, said Fitch analysts, who
assume global economies will
have weak, but positive growth
this year without a “double-dip” into
recession. Fitch’s price forecasts for
2010 are $70/bbl for crude, up from
$57.50/bbl previously, and $4/Mcf for
natural gas, down from $5/Mcf.
The credit outlook is not uniform
across the industry, however. Refiners
run the most risk as global fuel demand
and refinery utilization rates continue
to slump. Offshore drillers with deepwater rigs and sizable backlogs will
benefit from long-term contracts signed
when business was better.
Overall, the service and supply
business is suffering a major decline in
credit profiles as pricing and utilization
rates fall. That will continue this year,
with smaller, less-diversified companies under the most stress.
On the upside, increased oil demand
as the world economy returns to positive growth rates following reduced
upstream investment in 2009 will likely
lead to tighter market fundamentals. On
the other hand, Iraq’s push to increase
its oil production and additional output
from Brazil and Canadian oil sands will
provide more supply.
Producers with large exposure to
the US gas market face another year
of weak commodity prices. Barring
extreme weather conditions, the US gas

market by hedging are more likely to
weather 2010, Fitch analysts said.

Liquidity, upgrades
Despite increased asset sales to fill
capital spending shortfalls, liquidity appears adequate for most of the
upstream companies that Fitch rates.
Mergers and acquisitions usually increase in weak markets, but the ability
of producers to lock in cash flow from
higher futures prices may limit the distress fire-sales that buyers hope for.
As in the previous up-cycle, Fitch
will limit rating upgrades to companies
with “sustained and substantial commitments” to conservative financial and
operating profiles. Rating downgrades
will be primarily company-specific
unless market conditions prove so weak
that “most if not all of the issuers” in a
sector succumb to the same downward
rating pressures.
“Many issuers are entering the
current downturn from a position of
strength, as they had taken advantage of
the robust industry market conditions
and unfettered access to banking and
capital markets through midyear 2008
to protect their liquidity by extending maturities and increasing revolver
availability,” said Fitch analysts.
Fitch will continue to focus on cash
flow, which should improve moderately because of reduced capital spending budgets, cost resets, and stable-tohigher commodities pricing. “Given the
sharp premium associated with liquidity, companies are expected to continue
to shift their focus away from growthoriented objectives toward maintaining
strong balance sheets during 2010,”
analysts said.
Among the firms rated by Fitch, 82%
of the integrated companies and 77% of
pure exploration and production companies have a stable outlook. By contrast, 60% of companies in the downstream refining and marketing segment
“are either on rating watch negative or
have a negative outlook.” Fitch analysts
said, “This is largely, but not entirely,
due to the negative factors affecting the
sector, which are considered to repreOil & Gas Journal / Feb. 1, 2010

Fitch expects credit quality for the
service and suppliers to deteriorate in
2010 “due primarily to amortization
of contract backlogs, weak natural gas
prices, and the potential for weaker oil
prices, weak pricing power (including expectations of falling prices for
certain asset classes and geographic
locales), and reduced utilization levels
for fleets.” There could be modest
offsets from cost reductions from lower

any restructuring to reduce overhead

Deepwater rigs will survive lower

they said.

XTO’s US unconventional gas resource
base and technical expertise would
go well with the major’s global reach,
research and development capabilities,
and financial capacity, Tillerson said.
“The development of our combined
resources will create the opportunity
for more jobs and investment in the
production of natural gas across many
parts of the United States,” Tillerson
said. “It will support our nation’s economic recovery, strengthen [its] energy
security, and help meet [its] environmental goals.”

Focus on gas
Bob R. Simpson, XTO chairman and
founder, said the company’s management decided soon after it started to
focus not only on gas, but also on
long-lived, high-producing reserves.
That led it to tight shale gas, where it
eventually became an industry leader,
he indicated.
“In reviewing our future path, we
realized that we needed to look at options to take what we have achieved
and bring it to a new level,” he testified. “We recognized that the opportunities before us could best reach their
potential if we could find an organization that could bring additional scale,
technology, and financial capacity
to the work we have been doing. We
found that organization in ExxonMobil.”
Markey suggested that the proposed
merger has positive aspects, including
the signal that another multinational oil
company is willing to invest in developing unconventional US gas resources.
But he also said that Congress wants to
make certain those resources are developed safely, which is why it asked the
US Environmental Protection Agency
to study hydraulic fracing’s operating
record.
Republicans on the subcommittee said the technology is safe. “It is
well known that gas will play a more

prominent role in a carbon-restrained
world,” said ranking minority member
Fred Upton (R-Mich.). “In fact, the success of any climate-change policy will
need to rely heavily on gas. Yet some
members of Congress are seeking policies that would take a majority of our
domestic gas off the table.”
Several Democrats said the process
uses toxic substances that would create
serious problems if they entered drinking water supplies. Rep. Diana DeGette
(D-Colo.), who is not a member of this
subcommittee, was allowed to participate because she introduced a bill
last year to federally regulate hydraulic
fracing under the Safe Drinking Water
Act (SDWA).
“I support hydraulic fracturing,”
she said. “My bill would not make it
illegal or impractical. It simply would
require disclosure of ingredients in an
emergency situation while protecting
proprietary information.”

only four states have regulations that
specifically deal with the process. The
executives responded that several others
have water-management regulations
that serve similar purposes.
They also contended that federally
regulating hydraulic fracing simply
would add another layer to a process that states already regulate well.
Restricting its use would harm conventional production too, Tillerson
added. “A lot of conventional wells use
hydraulic fracturing to make production commercial,” he said.
When DeGette asked them how
much they think having to comply with SDWA regulations in using
hydraulic fracing would cost their
companies, the ExxonMobil and XTO
executives said they did not know.
“Much of it would depend on how EPA
decided to implement its regulation,”
Tillerson told her. “I don’t know what

Parks Service
proposes changes

A

s US Interior Secretary Ken
Salazar and the Bureau of Land
Management drew fire for proposed
changes in onshore oil and gas rules
for public lands BLM administers,
another Interior agency quietly concluded the public comment period
for policy changes it has proposed.
The National Park Service (NPS)
proposed revisions on Nov. 25, 2009,
to regulations governing 693 nonfederal oil and gas operations within
boundaries of 13 NPS units that
have been in effect for more than 30
years.
“Nonfederal oil and gas rights
are the result of a conveyance of an
interest from a grantor other than
the United States and may be held
by individuals, companies, nonprofit
organizations, or state and local government,” the DOI agency said in the
proposed rulemaking notice.
Such rights are a form of real
property and are protected under the
US Constitution’s Fifth Amendment,
it said. NPS has the authority to regulate those rights under laws passed
by Congress allowing the agency to
promulgate regulations necessary to
manage the parks system.

Current rules
Operators must document that
they are exercising a bona fide nonfederal oil and gas property right.
They must identify specific steps
they’ll take to protect park resources
and values. And they must submit a
bond to assure funds will be available to reclaim a site if the operator
defaults on his obligations, NPS said.
The agency proposed requiring
364 operations that are currently
exempt to comply with the regula26

tions. These include 190 wells just
inside park boundaries but that are
maintained without crossing park
land, and 255 operations that were
covered by a valid state permit when
the original NPS rules took effect.
NPS also proposed possibly
changing incentives for directional
drilling from outside park boundaries. It said while it realizes such
activity can have indirect impacts
such as sight, sound, odors, or spills,
effects are usually much less than
from surface activity inside the parks.

Performance bonds
The agency also is considering updating performance bonds (currently
capped at $200,000/operator), and
replacing the limit with a variable
amount of financial assurance “equal
to the reasonable estimated cost of
reclamation and liability today.” It
also proposed updating operating
standards and noncompliance assessments, and changing vehicle registrations to access fees.
In its comments, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) lauded NPS’s proposals,
but added they should be extended
beyond oil and gas to coal, sand,
gravel, and other extraction operations. There presently are no rules
governing nonfederal mineral operations within national parks other
than petroleum, it said.
“The same legal authority empowering [NPS] to regulate oil and
gas also empowers [it] to regulate
mineral extraction,” observed PEER
executive director Jeff Ruch. “As
long as NPS is updating one set of
rules, it should also take care of the
other.” ✦

would be in it, and neither do you.”
Markey concluded the hearing by
stating, “There is no secret plot on
this side of the aisle to ban hydraulic
fracturing.” But when he was asked by
reporters afterward if he planned to
schedule DeGette’s bill for markup, the
subcommittee chairman replied, “I’m
going to have to have further discussions with her on it before I decide.” ✦

speech should herald

As OGJ went to press last week,
the oil and gas industry was hoping US President Barack Obama’s Jan.
27 State of the Union address would
begin a shift of administration-industry
relations from confrontation to cooperation, American Petroleum Institute
Pres. Jack N. Gerard said.
Gerard told reporters in a Jan. 26
teleconference that he expected the
president to focus on job creation and
on reducing economic pressures on the
middle class, and that the US oil and
gas industry strongly supports both
goals.
“What we seek is not an earmark
or stimulus, merely an opportunity to
develop the vast US oil and gas resources,” Gerard continued. “We specifically
do not want the pattern we’ve seen over
the past year from the Department of
the Interior when they’ve lessened our
access to domestic resources. In the past
year, since Secretary [Ken] Salazar has
taken office, the total federal oil and
gas leasing program has shrunk to the
lowest level on record.”
He noted that in New Mexico, where
8% of the total employment is tied to
oil and gas and 40% of the state’s revenue comes from industry and related
activity, the amount of federal leasOil & Gas Journal / Feb. 1, 2010

NGSA, IPAMS urge Obama not to overlook natural gas
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
As OGJ went to press last week,
two oil and gas association officials
said they hoped US President Barack
Obama’s Jan. 27 State of the Union
message would reflect policies that
encourage—instead of discourage—the
nation’s natural gas development.
“We urge the president to remember
that natural gas is not only an environmental solution, it is an economic
solution for our country,” Natural Gas
Supply Association Pres. R. Skip Horvath said in a statement.
The industry employs several million people already and is posed to add
more as power plants, homes, businesses, and factories increase demand,
Horvath noted, adding, “Those jobs

ing dropped 58% from 2008 to 2009.
“We believe the best approach is to
develop a sound oil and gas policy that
recognizes the potential for green job
creation, but also the potential for oil
and gas development across the United
States,” he said.
Responding to reports that Salazar
planned to announce on Jan. 28 that
the US Minerals Management Service
would begin to take public comments
on a proposed Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf seismic study, Gerard said,
“This has been a no-brainer. Industry
has wanted to conduct these studies
for some time, and we’re thrilled the
decision has been made. We believe it’s
long overdue.”

‘Not as constructive’
Gerard also acknowledged that relations between the secretary and some
oil and gas groups have become contentious. “We would greatly appreciate
the opportunity to have better communications with him,” he said. “We feel
at this time they’re not as constructive
or productive as they could be, and we
28

create revenue in addition to the billions of dollars the natural gas industry
already generates for state and federal
government through royalties and
taxes.”
Marc W. Smith, executive director
for the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States, expressed
concern that the White House might
respond to a $1.35 trillion deficit with
the same $80 billion in tax hikes it
proposed last year. “These punitive
policy proposals are contrary to the
president’s goals of rebuilding our
economy, increasing energy security,
and lowering greenhouse gas emissions,” Smith said.
The anticipated tax proposals would
repeal expensing of intangible drilling costs and the percentage depletion deduction, and reduce expensing

of geological and geophysical costs,
Smith said.
G&G costs are similar to research and
development costs, which are deductible for every other industry, Smith said,
adding, “Because of American ingenuity
and advanced technologies, the American natural gas industry has increased
gas reserves by 39% in the last 3 years,
catapulting the US into sixth place in
world rankings. America has also surpassed Russia in terms of gas production because of superior R&D and better
application of technology.”
Horvath said the US should tap all
energy sources, including fossil fuels,
to make the domestic economy grow.
“Natural gas adds to the reliability
of solar and wind and, like solar and
wind, it is a sustainable and responsible choice on its own,” he said.

hope that the president’s speech tomorrow night will begin a change toward
having an open and honest dialogue.”
A spokeswoman for Salazar said later
that day in a statement that Gerard’s
statements about 2009 federal oil and
gas development relative to 2008 were
inaccurate. “Oil and gas production
on federal lands and waters is up—not
down—from 2008, and under Secretary Salazar’s leadership the department has offered more than 56 million
additional acres for development,” she
said. “[DOI’s] agencies will continue to
promote oil and gas development in the
right ways, in the right places, and with
a fair return for the American taxpayer,
regardless of the political spears Mr.
Gerard may throw on any given day.”
Gerard also said he hoped that the
administration’s fiscal 2011 federal
budget request, when it emerges in a
few more weeks, won’t have the kind
of onerous oil and gas taxes from a year
earlier and which fortunately were not
included in the final 2010 budget that
emerged from Congress.

“Previous proposals have assumed
we have too much energy development
in the United States. Clearly, no one
could believe that now,” said Gerard.
“We hope the dialogue over the past
year will soften some of the rhetoric
so we can get down to the realities of
creating jobs and improving the national economy. Energy, over time, has
become a partisan issue. It should not
be. It is something that everyone, regardless of political persuasion, should
support.”
Gerard said climate-change bills that
passed the full US House and the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee in 2009 were a false start. “We
believe that we need to consider the
reality of the energy sources we have
today, and what it will take to fuel the
economy today and into the future,”
Gerard said. “Natural gas is one example. It was not considered in the first
proposals. We believe the debate has to
mature, and the prospects aren’t likely
that there will be a climate bill this
year. A comprehensive energy bill looks
more likely.” ✦

In a press statement, the ministry
noted declining expectations for the
size of discoveries in mature areas and
the need for small discoveries to have
access to producing facilities in existing
oil and gas fields.
“It is therefore important to discover

Trinidad and Tobago makes term
changes to 2010 bid round
Curtis Williams
OGJ Correspondent
Trinidad and Tobago has announced
major changes to its fiscal terms for
energy companies operating in the
country and those seeking new blocks
in its 2010 bid round.
The government made the announcement at an energy conference
hosted by the South Trinidad Chamber
of Industry and Commerce at which it
said that it will continue to use produc-

tion-sharing contracts but will eliminate taxes on the PSCs. Instead, Trinidad and Tobago will collect its revenues
via profit oil.
Energy Minister Conrad Enill told
the conference: “Our new PSC will be
similar to the 1995-96 models in which
companies were allowed to evaluate
their risks and offer an adequate share
of profit petroleum. This is intended to
reduce some of the inherent risks and
encourage potential investment.”

Enill admitted that the world outlook for oil and gas was not as attractive as it was 18 months ago and in the
circumstances the twin-island nation
had to be more competitive.
Enill said concessionary arrangements will be put in place in areas and
activities where incentives for revitalization and sustainability are required,
such as in the mature offshore oil acreages and on land where enhanced oil
recovery projects are undertaken.
He said, “Specifically, the incentives
will directly impact on the supplemental petroleum tax rates that will
be payable by companies. In so doing,
it will provide companies with additional financial flows to reinvest in the
upstream sector. This new regime will
address small, mature fields and tailend
production and will allow for a situation intended to encourage new investment while allowing current produc-

tion levels to be sustained.” Trinidad
and Tobago produces 115,000 bo/d and
4 bcfd of gas.
Under the new fiscal terms, there
is a distinction between ‘shallow’ and
what is referred to as ‘average’ water
depths. In the shallow fields, the government has maintained its windfall
taxes but it kicks in whenever crude
prices are above $70/bbl and gas prices
are $6/MMbtu. In average water depts.,
the windfall taxes kick in at $80/bbl for
crude and $7/MMbtu for gas.
Director of Resource Management
Helena Inniss-King revealed that there
will be additional benefits for companies operating in both the shallow and
average-water depths with an increase
in the percentage of cost recovery companies can claim.
Inniss-King said, “We had some
comments on the cost recovery, that it
was too low, and we have increased the

cost recovery for the shallow water to
50% and for the average water depth
55%.” Average water depth are blocks
in more than 400 m of water.
Trinidad and Tobago says the new
fiscal regime was arrived at after consultation with the major oil and gas
companies operating in the country.
BP PLC Chief Executive Officer Tony
Hayward called for a new fiscal regime
in Trinidad and Tobago. During a recent visit, Hayward said he was confident that BP Trinidad & Tobago (BPTT)
and the Patrick Manning administration
will reach agreement on the new terms.
BPTT produces 450,000 boe/d from
its Trinidad and Tobago operations.
Trinidad and Tobago will offer seven
blocks in shallow and average water in
this year’s first quarter and has announced that later this year will offer
blocks in its deepwater areas—in water
1,000-3,500 m deep. ✦

oil and gas industry was in for an
easy time this year, they will have to
revise those thoughts immediately.
Consider the Philippines where
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) said that ExxonMobil Corp.
should recognize the Moros’ ancestral claims and rightful share of
resources extracted from Sulu Sea.
“The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front has reminded ExxonMobil,
which is presently engaged in oil
exploration in Sulu, not to forget
that it is operating within the Moro
ancestral homeland,” MILF said.
More ominously, MILF warned
that “the rightful share” of the

to 75% of the income derived, should
not be overlooked by ExxonMobil’s
agreement with Manila.

the Sulu Sea. According to recent media reports, at least three US oil firms
were the target of a series of previously undisclosed cyber attacks that
may have originated in China. Experts say the attacks highlight “a new
level of sophistication in the growing
global war of internet espionage.”

Bid data stolen

The oil and gas industry breaches,
according to a report in the Christian Science Monitor, were focused
on valuable bid data detailing the
quantity, value, and location of oil
discoveries worldwide.
The targeted companies—Marathon Oil, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips—didn’t realize the full
extent of the attacks, which occurred
in 2008, until the FBI alerted them
that year and in early 2009.

They said the tender award for the
second 1,220 km gas pipeline from Vyborg in Russia to Lubmin in Germany
“will ensure timely delivery of the

The partners said the decision was
made by the shareholder’s committee
following “thorough evaluation” of
bids from German, Japanese, and Russian companies.
“With €1 billion, the total volume
of the contracts is below the price level

The US shale business has been one
of the hottest E&P topics the past few
years, with the Marcellus capturing
most recent attention.
Many have expressed concern that
they are either too late or too slow to
enter the Marcellus and fear that the
best opportunities have passed. However, deal flow in the Marcellus since
2008 has actually increased, while entry opportunities are
still numerous and
may be strategically
matched through a
variety of business
models from existing and new players.
The main reason
is that the US unconventional gas market remains distinctly unconsolidated.
The sheer breadth of entry choices can
be executed and measured in a number
of ways from bigger corporate deals to
small focused land acquisitions.
In this article, the author suggests
a framework for explaining Marcellus
deal activity through the concept of development phases, namely where in the
operational development cycle the play
is currently and where it is going.

The most significant early deal
in the Marcellus was in 2005, with
Chesapeake Energy Corp.’s acquisition
of Columbia Natural Resources Inc. for
$2.95 billion. Through this acquisition,
coupled with engaging a “land army”
of brokers, Chesapeake built the largest acreage position in the Marcellus
fairway.
Three years later, in 2008, Statoil
entered into a strategic alliance with
Chesapeake, acquiring 32.5% of Chesapeake’s 1.8 million Marcellus acres.
Most recently, in what is the largest
multiplay unconventional gas deal so
far, ExxonMobil Corp. is expected to
acquire XTO Energy Inc. for $41 billion
in 2010. Then Chesapeake announced
its fourth major JV, with Total in the
Texas Barnett shale.
Private equity investments in the
Marcellus have also captured headlines
in the business press, including deals
involving Morgan Stanley Capital Partners and KKR. Midstream deals are also
apparent including Williams, MarkWest, and NGP Midstream Resources.
And most recently, large land acquisitions, including deals from Ultra
Petroleum, Hess Corp., and Seneca
Resources, have raised the land stakes

create value and how can success be
measured?
The development phase for most
shale plays can be roughly broken
down into four key stages: early moves
and land grabs; experimentation and
growth; core development; and, exploitation and optimization.
Early moves and land grabs: This can be
from an existing player already exposed to the play (vertical wells or
CBM); from applying technology from
one shale play to another (Barnett as a
laboratory); or by simply making early
bets (using land as a commodity). For
the Marcellus, this started with Range’s
first Marcellus well in 2003.
Experimentation and growth: Shale gas
production growth kicked off in 2005

and within 3 years became a game
changer for the US gas market. What
defines this phase is the rise of US
independent E&P companies, phenomenal increases in bonus payments, and
the entry of the majors. The Marcellus
is still in this period.
Core development: This is all about
positioning and the core. Not all shales
are created equal. Where drilling and
completion experimentation aligns
with subsurface understanding, the
difference in value between core and
noncore is great. Much of this is occurring in the Marcellus, but the play is
too large and untested to draw conclusions on the subsurface.
Exploitation and optimization: This stage
is what some consultants call factory

drilling or the flexible factory. What
defines this phase, which we are
witnessing in the Barnett, is how to
efficiently organize around the parameters of a margin business and how to
squeeze the most out of existing acreage in a volatile gas price environment.
The Marcellus is not at this stage yet.
Given that development phases and
strategic drivers are never static entities,
external drivers including changes in
the competitive environment, gas price
volatility, technological developments,
legislation, and regulation all will
influence companies’ entry strategies.
Using the entry choice framework a
discussion of past entry deals, principally in the Marcellus, is analyzed
below.

“$30,212/acre in Caddo Parish”
At the heart of this concept is the relationship between the industry strategic drivers and the development stage of the play.

Early moves and land grabs
While some companies possess what
may be called legacy positions in the
Marcellus, including Range Resources,
Atlas, and EQT, established Appalachian
producers, it was Chesapeake that made
the boldest move into the play through
the acquisition of Columbia Natural
Resources in 2005.
In the Barnett, Devon Energy
employed the early move and land
grab strategy through the $3.5 billion acquisition of Mitchell Energy in
2001. XTO Energy acquired much of its
280,000 acres Marcellus position from
Linn Energy and private sellers in 2008.
In the same year, ExxonMobil made a
$22.4 million land acquisition in Pennsylvania that at the time received little
attention.
Many private investors were fast at
making early moves into the Marcellus. Their business model is essentially
buying and selling leases as a commodity. During the high lease activity
levels in 2008, thousands of leases were
signed to companies with no intention
of developing the resources, which will
open up opportunities as the expiry
horizon closes.
The strategic drivers and value
36

propositions behind these deals vary,
but the underlying assumption is that
first-mover advantage in a new play
will offer upsides that outweigh the
underlying risk. Just 3 years ago, acreage in what are turning out to be the
most prolific counties of the Marcellus
went for $25/acre with a 12.5% royalty.
Today the same area will bring over
$5,750/acre with a 20% royalty (Fig. 2).
Comparing the NPV per well
between these figures is significant.
Taking a bet on gas prices also helped
in this period, as US gas prices trended
upwards and spiked to $13/MMbtu in
both 2005 and 2008.
Transferring technology to the play
was instrumental, too, during this
phase, building on experiences from
other shale plays.
Range Resources experimentation
of drilling and hydraulic fracturing
practices used in the Barnett is widely
regarded as helping to unlock the
Marcellus in 2003-05. The key technical and subsurface drivers during this
phase included attempting to identify
subsurface core areas using existing
well data, identifying the “sweet spot”
in the prospective zone, determining
best drilling and completion practices

to lower finding cost, and maximizing
recovery.
In addition, educating government agencies and developing service
industry capacity was essential. Smaller
companies have generally shown that
the advantages of speed of execution
and management of risk have proven to
be the most successful business model
in this part of the development phase.
Measuring success in this phase is
relative to the time horizon. Clearly
some players are positioning to be
acquired by a larger company, while
smaller private actors are playing the
waiting game to offload leases before
expiry. What is important to consider
is that as the Marcellus moved out of
this phase the breadth of entry choices
increased.

Experimentation and growth
The pace of unconventional drilling,
the growing scale of activity, and evolving completion technologies have quite
possibly created a new paradigm in the
US gas market.
Where technology, positive well
results, and high gas prices met, shale
gas soon became perceived as a game
changer in the industry. This new

and typically scattered at best. More
analysis of core data, seismic data, open
hole logging data, and post completion
analysis of results is required to identify
core areas.
Two developing core areas of note
are in northeastern Pennsylvania and
southwestern West Virginia. Some
recent deals of note that reflect the
core development phase include Ultra
Petroleum’s $400 million land acquisition in Lycoming, Clinton, and Centre
counties, Pa., at $5,000/acre. Hess
Corp., Seneca Resources, Cabot Oil &
Gas, and Chesapeake-Statoil have also
been highly active in land acquisitions
for infill acreage.
Even when the perceived core area
is found (as we won’t know until a
lot more wells are drilled), companies must continue to build areas of
contiguous acreage. As land is a finite
resource, interests around the core get
very crowded. This will involve more
exploration JVs (for example, the Hess
Corp.-Newfield Exploration deal covering 140,000 acres); the formation of
new areas of mutual interest, and all
manner of smaller, under-the-radar
swaps, acquisitions, and divestments.
Private equity is also a player, including deals from KKR with East Resources
and Morgan Stanley Private Equity’s
majority investment in Triana Energy
(Morgan Stanley’s fourth investment in
the Marcellus).
While the broader value propositions of private equity and established
independent E&P shale players may
vary, the underlying strategic drivers
in the core development phase are the
same. The value of contiguous acreage
around the core play is worth up to
double the value of late noncore entry
(using the Fayetteville as an analog).
The value of a company’s portfolio with acreage scattered around the
core and noncore areas can be fully
developed through land highgrading.
Acreage positions can be used as mini
portfolios, swapping, selling, and purchasing contiguous land tracts to build
drill ready sites.

of even small contiguous acreage in
the sweet spots will offer considerably
more value than a competitor with
larger, scattered acreage as the drill-out
probability increases and costs can be
driven down through full pad development and more efficient logistics and
permitting.
Total’s $2.25 billion JV with Chesapeake in the Barnett from January 2010
is a direct entry into the core. This
kind of entry is likely to occur in the
Marcellus the next few years. The effect of a tighter and more focused land
portfolio in the core leads to the final
development phase, that of exploitation
and optimization.

Exploitation and optimization
Because of the sheer size of the
Marcellus play, and its geographic and
subsurface variability, it will be some
time until we can assume that operators are engaged in the exploitation and
optimization development phase.
In this phase, new business models
are likely to be developed to manage
what is essentially a margin business
very different from conventional oil
and gas organization models. Brian
Forbes, Joerg Ehlert, and Herve Wilczynski from Schlumberger Business
Consulting have suggested the concept
of the flexible factory in unconventional gas development, balancing repeat-

ability and standardized design with
the specifics of subsurface characterization (Fig. 3).
The strategic drivers likely to influence this particular development phase
include gas price volatility, margin
management, competitor benchmarking, lean processes, and aboveground
regulatory issues.
Entry into the Marcellus may come
from various actors.
Utilities are likely to see entry into
the upstream as a hedge or strategic
asset, particularly if gas receives a
demand boost from legislation aimed
at lowering US carbon dioxide emissions. Utilities are used to margin
business models and have considerable
experience in state and environmental
relations.
Private equity will also continue to
see opportunities in this development
phase looking for countercyclical gas
price exposure, consolidation opportunities and providing improved management teams.
Sovereign wealth funds may also
make bets on this play, as they have
also done in mature basins including
the UK continental shelf.
Sustainable success will be measured
against those players with consistent
top quartile cost positions, which is
essentially the best long-term hedge in
structurally volatile commodity markets

such as natural gas and offers investors superior returns. In this particular
phase, the majors may already possess
some distinct advantages, through the
application of technological innovation,
supply chain management, sophisticated IT systems and procurement
economies of scale.
This particular operational model
could imply that the winners in this
phase may actually employ a business
model similar to that of the oil and
gas service industry, which again may
create new cooperation opportunities
between the service sector and E&Ps.
This is especially true of the Appalachian region, which is a multishale
play offering recovery upside through
greater subsurface understanding.
Near-term technology developments
will need to tackle some key issues
including improving recovery rates,
water management and recycling of
frac fluids, and optimizing logistics.
Long-term technological developments
will occur as a result of continual problem solving and competition, making
the Marcellus a very important place to
be for transferring technology to global

consolidation in the shale gas sector.
As the Marcellus matures, the
competitor landscape will change with
it, bringing in new players that are
measuring success and adding value in
various ways.
There is no silver bullet application
for sustainable success in shale plays,
rather the tireless drive for operational
efficiency and the application of repeatable technology. For some companies,
this will require very different business
models than they employ today, engaging aspects of manufacturing and just
in time supply-chain management.
The growth of the joint venture
model in US shale may also encourage new organizational structures and
working practices getting the best out
of the Independents and the majors.
What is sure in this play is that the level
of competition will continue to remain
high in the future. ✦

Even though more

contractors are building new land rigs to satisfy operator
demand for improved technology.
In the case of Nabors Drilling USA

programs, especially for drilling in
unconventional basins.
He said, “To meet demand we are
expanding our fleet with the new PACE
rigs.” Typically Nabors only builds
new PACE rigs when customers make a
long-term contractual commitment, he
added.
PACE stands for programmable AC
electric and the programmable refers to
various functions and controls that are
programmed in the rig’s PLCs (programmable logic controllers), Witherspoon explained.
The automation in these rigs includes a drawworks-control joystick
for raising, lowering, and stopping the
traveling blocks. Drillers input all other
drawworks operating parameters such
as upper and lower hoist limits and
speed, via a human-machine interface
screen that controls the PLC and variable-frequency drive systems (Fig. 1).
These rigs have a top-drive joystick
that operates the pipe handler rotation,
link tilt extend-retract, and makeup and
breakout functions. Drillers also use the
HMI screens for operating and monitoring other equipment such as mud
pumps, blowout preventer accumulator
system, torque wrench, rotary table,
catheads, and hydraulic power unit.
Witherspoon noted that before AC

Bringing proven ball-activated tool expertise to the drilling arena.
Across the E&P lifecycle the pressure is on to perform downhole. Now a single
drilling valve bypass system can help meet the demands of challenging
drilling operations.
Building on our success with downhole circulating equipment, M-I SWACO
takes reliable downhole performance one step further. The WELL COMMANDER*
tool enables the widest range of critical drilling functions to be performed
with confidence, from cuttings removal to lost circulation treatment and kill
weight fluid spotting.
As well as being simple to operate, versatility is maximized with seven full
cycles activated with one-size ball, while other ball-activated tool access is
maintained below this drilling valve. Engineered for reliability, an isolation
sleeve protects the activation mechanism against debris and solids-laden
fluids. The tool can be locked in either the open or closed state, and remain
unaffected by high circulation rates and pressure changes. Using the
WELL COMMANDER tool, sensitive BHA equipment can be protected from
aggressive solids-laden treatments.
Optimize rig time and resources by eliminating additional auxiliary tools and
avoiding unnecessary trips. When performing critical drilling operations with
the WELL COMMANDER tool, the ball is in your court.

providing faster tool-face settings, and
improving tool-face control.
All M-Series rigs can accommodate
multiwell pad drilling and an optional
walking system can enhance the move
capability with full setback.

AC rigs
Nabors said that it is only building
new AC rigs. The company notes that
some competitors build new DC rigs,

but “the way of the future is AC technology and we cannot justify large capital
expenditures on new non-AC rigs, when
that capital could more strategically be
deployed toward the development and
construction of PACE rigs.”
Nabors says AC technology makes it
easier to provide precise and automated
rig controls such as:
• Drawworks efficiency and safety
with a single joystick operation and effective autodrill function.
• Top-drive directional drilling efficiency.
• Mud pump speed and pressure
controls.
• Improved drilling and tripping
performance
• Reduced nonproductive time on
well.
AC-driven equipment is smaller,
more portable, and offers enhanced
performance and reliability. DC motors cannot operate at zero speed for

extended periods, while AC motors
can run at zero and low speeds at full
torque for prolonged extended periods.
The drawworks and top drives benefit
operationally from the AC motor’s ability to hold full torque and load at zero
speed for extended periods. For instance,
regeneration converts kinetic energy to
electrical energy, enabling the motor to
slow and stop rotation. This eliminates
the need for separate eddy current and
service brakes on drawworks.
Another difference is that DC motors
require brushes for rotor current. AC
motors are brushless, thereby requiring
less maintenance, and are more suited
for hazardous locations.
AC drives also improve the power
factor and increase the overall efficiency. DC motor-drive systems have a
varying power factor based on speed
(0.30-0.95). AC motor-drive systems
have a constant 0.95 power factor at all
speeds. ✦

bearing zones in the former Soviet
Union. Also it is already one of
the world’s most important oil
producing areas.
A large portion of the basin
lies in the southern part of
Kazakhstan, and the rest is in
Russia. The basin, with a total
area of 50,104 sq km (1,000 km
from east to west and 500 km
from north to south), is north of the
Caspian Sea.

for determining drilling fluid density
for salt beds is based on the drilling
fluid column pressure and the nonlinear viscoelastic deformation characteristics of salt rocks. The design includes
an analysis of the borehole shrinkage
rate under different liquid heads.
Proper drilling fluid density is then
determined from the on site borehole
shrinkage rate required for safe drilling.
This method includes creep parameters measured in the laboratory and
complicated shrinkage-rate calculations
of salt rocks.
Analysis of borehole well rock
deformation properties in deep salt
beds requires an understanding of the
short-term mechanical behavior of salt
rock because such behavior determines
the mechanisms for long-term rock
deformation.
One can use the acoustic emission
signal produced in a salt-rock triaxial
compression test (Fig. 4) to determine
the relationship between acoustic
emission and inner damage of rock to
provide a damage-expansion boundary curve of salt rock in an octahedron
stress space (Fig. 5). This is also the
shear yield strength along the crystal
grain boundary in the salt rock.2
Equation 1 in the equation box calculates the maximum octahedron shear
stress in a deep, ultra thick, salt-rock
formation.3 In the equation, ρo is the
salt-rock density and ρw is the wellbore
hydrostatic pressure.
If the borehole drilling-fluid head
is less than the salt-bed ground stress,
salt rock will creep toward the borehole. With an increase in both formation temperature and the differential
between salt-rock ground stress and
fluid head, borehole shrinkage rate also
increases.

When the thickness of salt beds is
greater than 500 m, particularly when
it is 1,000-4,000 m, one can use a
medium-high density, saturated-brine
drilling fluid to balance salt bed creep
such as in well SLK3 in the Central
Asia block and salt wells in the Sagiski
block.
A proper high-density drilling fluid
in a salt-gypsum bed should have the
following characteristics:
• Effective inhibition of salt-gypsum bed creep, salt dissolution, and
hydration expansion in the water-sensitive formation to keep the borehole
stable.
• Excellent rheological behavior
under high temperature.
• Excellent salt resistance, calcium
resistance, and drill cutting ejection
resistance, as well as excellent lubricity
and saline recrystallization resistance.
• Relatively low filtration under
high temperatures and high pressures,
as well as an ability to form thin and
tough mud cake with good compressibility.

polymer (Table 2). From Table 3, it is
obvious that most polymer candidates
do not deposit or flocculate in saturated brine and are capable of resisting
calcium.
The viscosity of macromolecular
polymer solution declines sharply in
the process of adding salt (Table 3).
This implies that under the influence
of electrolyte, macromolecular polymer
molecular chain curls and hydration
capacity declines.
Metal zwitterionic polymer because
of its molecular structure has a strong
ability to resist electrolytes. The PMHC
molecular chain stretches moderately in
brine and has relatively thick hydration
film cover. Salinity has little effect on
solution viscosity of PMHC.
The clay’s microscopic size in solution can determine the hydration and
dispersion-resistant capability of the
polymer solution. The test first combines three different polymer solutions
with the concentration of 2%. The next
step adds bentonite and rock meal into
the solution under the same conditions, and then after full dispersion,
one can measure the median diameter
and specific surface area with a laser
granulometer.
The results show that PMHC has a
relatively large median diameter that
can resist hydration and dispersion
(Table 4).
The tests used several organic filtrate
reducers capable of salt, calcium, and
temperature resistance before contaminating the fluid with 25% brine to
measure filtrate resistant (Table 5).
These tests noted that the number
of bubbles increases after the addition
of SMP-II, and hence it is one ingredient that should be controlled. Table 5
shows that SMP-II, SPC, and JT888 for
resisting salt and calcium can effectively reduce the filtrate amount. All of
them could be used in practice.

thick argillutite, gypsum, mudstone,
and red argillutite. As a result of the
different lithology and physicochemical
properties, formations differ in expansion and dispersion after encountering drilling fluids. Because of this, the
drilling fluid needs to have a strong
inhibitive ability
The properties of clay additives
decrease in brine polymer drilling
fluid because of the compression of the
electrolytic double-layer of salt. Thus,
selecting proper additives with strong
inhibitive ability is key to increasing the
inhibitive ability of brine drilling fluid.
We tested in our laboratory inhibi52

With the drilling characteristics of
the ultrathick salt-gypsum bed in the
Kolzhan block, the recommendation
from our optimization process is for
the use a zwitterionic polymer-KCl
saturated brine drilling fluid.
Roll recovery tests compared several
distinct fluids used in the area and the
zwitterionic polymer-KCl saturated
brine drilling fluid (Fig. 8). These data
show that polysulfonate drilling fluid
behaves the worst in inhabiting drill
cuttings, while the recommended
amphoteric KCl saturated brine and
polysulfonate drilling fluid perform
much better with the highest recovery
and the strongest inhibition.
Other tests carried out were for high
temperature, high-pressure expansion
of shale (Fig. 9). These experimental
results show that amphoteric KCl saturated brine and polysulfonate drilling
fluid performs the best with the smallest relative expansion while clear water
performs the worst with the largest
relative expansion.
This is consistent with the roll recovery test results.

After the inclusion of polymers accompanied with the inorganic salt KCl,
polymer absorption volume in clay surface increased and the procedure added
metal cations to decrease the ζ-electric
potential, which decreases hydration
capability of clay and enhances inhibition of the drilling fluid. Synergistic
action of organic and inorganic inhibitors used together can improve drilling
fluid inhibition.
Table 6 shows that the addition of
NaCl and KC1 markedly enhances hydration inhibition for shale.

Well SLK3 is a wildcat well drilled

department of Shengli Oilfield in the

fluid after the upper borehole. Prehydrated bentonite slurry supplemented
the drilling fluid, which included NTA
to inhibit salt recrystallization, LV-CMC
to reduce filtrate, HV-CMC to improve viscosity and colloid protection,
and SDR-1. SDR-1 is an environment
friendly and power lubricant with no
fluorescence ring and is for increasing
lubrication properties of the drilling

Water solubility and

Refining
cycloalkanes found in
crude oil have been calculated and set in an easy-to-use table.
In addition, we have developed a
new correlation for solubility of water
in crude oil that provides reliable solubility values down to very low concentrations (ppm). The correlation is based
on boiling-point temperature of the

hydrocarbon. Correlation values and
experimental data are in agreement.
The results are usable in engineering applications involving processing,
safety, hazard, and environmental
considerations.

Water solubility
The importance of the solubility of
water in crude oil will increase in view
of processing, safety, hazard, and environmental considerations focusing on
product quality and equipment sustainability. The following brief discussion
illustrates the importance.

Any processing that lowers temperatures to near the freezing point of
water may result in formation of solids
(freezing of water or hydrate formation). Such formation will affect both
fluid flows in piping and operational
characteristics of equipment.
For catalytic reactions, any water
in the hydrocarbon may poison the
catalyst that promotes the hydrocarbon
reaction.
For reactions in general, any water
in the reaction species may result in
formation of undesirable by-products
issuing from the hydrocarbon reaction.
The presence of water in the product
may degrade quality and, if sufficient
water is in the product, it may prove to
be unusable by the customer.
This brief discussion indicates that
solubility of water in hydrocarbons
contained in crude oil is important
in engineering applications involving
processing, safety, hazard, and environmental considerations.

Earlier works correlated the solubility of hydrocarbons and other chemical types in water as a function of the
boiling point of the compound.11 In
this work, it was determined that the
boiling-point method was also applicable for correlation of solubility of
water in cycloalkanes (cyclopentanes
and cyclohexanes):
log10(S) = A + B*TB
where: S = solubility of water in

The correlation applies to a range
for boiling-point temperatures of about
280 K to 590 K.
The coefficients (A and B) for the
correlation were determined from
regression of the available data. In preparing the correlation, we conducted a
literature search to identify data source

The topside pipeworks shown here (left photo) are not traditionally pigged, requiring pigging for the low-pressure isolation through nonstandard construction
pipework fittings (Fig. 2). The nonstandard construction pipework fittings (middle photo) consisted of two 1.5-D bends and a narrow 45° traverse (Fig. 3).
The geometry of the damaged section (right photo) of riser was unknown, requiring emphasis on maintaining the section’s integrity while running the pig
train through the riser (Fig. 4).
sealing off the damaged riser section
and pipework. The solution consisted of
the following elements:
• Custom-designed pig trap and pigging spread.
• High-friction pig train furnished
with the SmartTrack remote tracking
and pressure-monitoring system.
• SmartTrack subsea remote tracking
and pressure-monitoring system.
• SmartTrack topside tracking and
monitoring system with radio link to
the dive support vessel.
• Pipeline isolation ball valve.
The customized pigs outfitted with
SmartTrack transponders allow the
accurate pig tracking (±2 in.), positioning, identification, and continual
pressure monitoring deemed necessary
with divers in the water. The SmartTrack system, when mounted in the
pig body, provides two-way throughpipe-wall communication. Each pig in
the train also has a unique identifier,
further minimizing risk in the event
the train moves.2
Factory acceptance tests confirmed
pressure capabilities before executing
the job. A test rig designed and built at
TDW facilities in Stavanger had a pig
launcher-receiver, a 1.5-D bend, and a
45° traverse to simulate the environment on the satellite platform. Tests of
various configurations mirrored the
expected scenario as much as possible.
Pressure tests included pigging pressure
tests, isolation pressure tests, and flip
pressure tests.2
TDW isolated the damaged riser

section from the gas inventory in the
export pipeline in August 2009 without venting or flooding the pipeline,
or displacing the pipeline inventory. A
three-module high-friction pig train
created isolation against the gas pressure in the pipeline.
TDW first verified and recorded the
pipeline inventory gas pressure, closing
and isolating Emergency Shutdown
Valve 050. The company then removed
redundant topside pipework upstream
of the ESDV and installed a temporary
spool and 12-in. diameter valve. ESDV
leakage was monitored closely, with a
desire to minimize pressure buildup in
the spool.
A pig trap and pigging pump
launched the high-friction isolation pig
train and pigged with water to the predetermined isolation position within
a straight spool section of the vertical
riser (Figs. 2-4). Technicians aboard the
dive support vessel tracked the position of each pig, verifying the HFIPT
was below the damaged section of riser
designated for replacement. Communication skids positioned over the three
pigs and connected to the pig’s monitoring system allowed the downstream
pressure of each isolation pig to be
continuously monitored throughout the
operation.
Existing topside pipework was removed and replaced with new pipework. Divers deployed from the DSV
successfully cut and removed the riser
section with a crane aboard the DSV.
A mechanical connector locked onto

the existing riser. The new riser was
attached to a crane on the platform and
lowered to rope access workers who
installed it to the topside pipework’s
closing spool and the existing riser
above the HFIPT.
Following installation of the new
riser section, TDW verified proper
operation of the ESDV and new 12-in.
valve. After purging the riser and topside pipework, TDW slowly increased
water pressure to begin pigging the
HFIPT downstream from the platform
to the launcher. It then closed the ESDV
and 12-in. valve, increasing pipelinegas inventory pressure to keep the
HFIPT moving forward.
TDW recovered all pigs in the temporary pig trap and closed the ESDV
and new valve. The platform crane and
remotely operated vehicle removed
all pigging equipment and the crew
demobilized.
Operations took about 10 weeks,
May 20-Aug. 2, 2009, during which a
continuous flow was maintained. ✦

From the Subscribers Only area of

US energy market
wouldn’t notice
loss of biodiesel
Live by the subsidy, die by the subsidy.
Because a generous tax credit for biodiesel expired at the end of 2009, makers of
the fuel fear commercial demise is near.
Distracted by the politics of health care
reform, Congress didn’t extend the $1/gal
credit for blenders of the diesel substitute
made from soybean oil, yellow grease, or
animal fat.
Loss of the credit would ruin biodiesel

economics already squeezed by adverse
margins between diesel prices and
feedstock costs. Producers of biofuels are
reported to be closing plants and laying
off workers.
If hype were true, US employment
(green jobs!) and energy supply (homegrown energy!) should feel strain from the
threat to biodiesel.
They do not.
According to Sen. Chuck Grassley (RIowa), the biodiesel industry lost 29,000
jobs last year after supporting “more than
51,000 green jobs” in 2008.
The decline, however difficult for the
workers involved, represents less than
0.2% of the 15.3 million Americans out of
work in December.
And imperiled biodiesel production is
even less consequential to energy supply.
In the first 9 months of 2009, according
to the Energy Information Administration,
biodiesel output averaged 23,500 b/d.
That’s 0.1% of the US oil market. And 54%
of it was exported, 37% net of imports. If
biodiesel production ceased, the market
wouldn’t notice.
For commercial reasons, moreover,
biodiesel growth had stalled before Congress got busy with other concerns.
Last year’s January-September production average was down from 38,200 b/d in
the comparable period of 2008 and barely
up from 2007.
But total-year tax credits were worth
$776 million in 2008 and $490 million in
2007 to the good green folks who made
and blended the material and who now
need only to hang on.
Congress will reinstate the subsidy. It
will have to if biodiesel sales are to triple
as they must to meet a mandate at the
plateau level taking effect in only 2 years.
Besides, those shiny, tiny biodiesel
plants provide wonderful photo opportunities for lawmakers who want to appear to
have acted meaningfully on energy but
who have no real idea how to go about it.

OPEC capacity caps prices
The International Energy Agency in Paris estimated in December the sustainable production capacity for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at
35.4 million b/d, with actual output at 29.05 million b/d, leaving a spare capacity of
6.35 million b/d. That spare capacity drops to 5.37 million b/d if less dependable
producers such as Iraq, Nigeria, and Venezuela are eliminated.
The US Energy Information Administration put OPEC’s spare production capacity in December at 5.03 million b/d, zeroing out Algeria, Ecuador, Iraq, Nigeria, and
Venezuela. It estimates OPEC’s maximum production capacity at 34 million b/d.
Using both the IEA and EIA numbers, Adam Sieminski at Deutsche Bank,
Washington, DC, said, “We estimate that capacity utilization in OPEC is running
at circa 85%. Both the IEA and EIA agree that the bulk of OPEC’s spare capacity is
in Saudi Arabia, with some 3.5-3.8 million b/d of incremental output available to
the markets.” Of course, Saudi crude is heavier and more sour than the frequently
disrupted Bonnie Light crude of Nigeria. Nevertheless, Sieminski sees the spare
OPEC capacity keeping a lid on crude prices this year, with West Texas Intermediate projected at $65/bbl vs. a consensus of $75-80/bbl.
Meanwhile, the US Geological Survey recently raised its estimate of heavy oil
“technically recoverable” from the oil sands in Venezuela’s Orinoco belt to 513
billion bbl, up from 235 billion previously (OGJ Online, Jan. 22, 2010). The estimate
is based on published geologic and engineering data. USGS figures recovery rates
from a minimum 15% for cold production using horizontal wells up to a median
45% and a maximum of 70%. “Some of the assumptions, notably the 45% median
recovery factor, look quite aggressive,” said analysts in the Houston office of
Raymond James & Associates Inc., “but the more important point here is this: The
reason for the 30%-plus meltdown in Venezuelan oil production since Hugo Chavez
took power in 1998 is not a matter of geology but rather politics. With some of the
world’s worst policies towards foreign investment, Venezuela’s oil industry is set
to continue stagnating.”
Pipeline factors
OPEC’s production capacity isn’t the only thing influencing the oil market, of
course. Enbridge Inc. recently announced its Alberta Clipper pipeline from Canada
to the Midwest will start operations in early April rather than in the third quarter
as previously projected. “Combined with the start-up of the Keystone pipeline
this means that we suddenly have 900,000 b/d of additional pipeline capacity from
Canada to the US Midwest starting in the second quarter,” said Olivier Jakob at
Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland.
The line fill is taking some crude off the market, and it will take some time before the increase in Canadian production matches the pipeline capacity increase.
“But given that the Enbridge Southern Lights pipeline (carries diluents up north
to increase the flow rate of the crude oil coming south) will also start ahead of
schedule, we should nevertheless expect to see increased flows from Canada to
the Midwest in the second half of 2010, and we maintain our estimate that the US
Midwest will have cut to zero its dependency on non-Canadian foreign crude oil by
the end of this year,” Jakob said.
Meanwhile, other EIA data show pipeline imports of natural gas from Canada
fell nearly 1 bcfd in 2009. But with US demand for gas down 1.5% because of the
economic downturn, Sieminski said, LNG imports were kept near contract minimums. Now, he said, “With the economy reviving and the expectation of continued low Canadian pipeline supplies, the need for LNG should rise toward 1.75 bcfd
from an estimated 1.25 bcfd level in 2009.”
Sieminski reported, “The wave of new and ramped-up LNG projects around
the globe is still building. Facilities streamed in 2009 include Tangguh, Qatargas 2,
Sakhalin 2, Yemen, Ras Laffan 3, Snohvit, North West Shelf 5, and Atlantic LNG 4.
Over the course of 2010-11, we expect significant increases from these projects, as
well as Pluto, Algeria, Peru LNG, and [Nigerian] LNG come on line.”
According to EIA estimates, Sieminski said, “Total [US] natural gas production increased by 3.7% in 2009 even though the rig count fell by almost 60% from
peak to trough September 2008 to July 2009. The EIA believes that steep declines
from existing fields and lagged effects of the lower rig count will contribute to a
3% decline in 2010 production, making more room for LNG despite the potential
for lower gas demand from electric utilities. The surprise, if there is one, in this
outlook is likely to come from stronger-than-expected shale gas production.”

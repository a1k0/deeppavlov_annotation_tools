MMS proposes OCS royalty relief amendments
The US Minerals Management Service proposed changes to its
Outer Continental Shelf deepwater royalty relief regulations on
Dec. 21 to conform to a 2004 federal court decision.
A US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in a case involving
Santa Fe Snyder Corp. found provisions of the US Department of
the Interior agency’s interpreting Section 304 of the 1995 Deepwater Royalty Relief Act were contrary to the statute’s requirements,
MMS said.
MMS said that the court found that a lease issued under that
section could not be excluded from royalty relief if it was part of
a field that already was in production before the deepwater royalty
relief legislation became law.
The court also found that royalty suspension volumes prescribed in Section 304 should apply to each lease and not jointly to
all leases in a particular field, MMS said.
It issued an information bulletin on Aug. 8, 2005, to alert affected lessees that MMS would respect the court decision and would
revise its regulations accordingly.
MMS announced a proposal on Dec. 21, and the agency will accept comments on the proposal for 60 days following publication
by the federal government.

Cosco Busan faces $61 million in bay cleanup
The cost of cleaning up the San Francisco Bay oil spill is expected to reach $61 million and may rise even higher, according to
Admiral Thad Allen, Commander of the US Coast Guard.
Allen told Congress that figure is significant because it’s what
the owner of the Cosco Busan is required to pay under federal law
for spilling 58,000 gal of fuel after striking the Bay Bridge Nov. 7.
However he said the costs likely will rise beyond that amount to
cover costs of completing cleanup and restoring coastal areas hit
by the spillage.
Those liability limits can be increased if the US Justice Department determines a spill was caused by gross negligence. Allen said
the USCG is discussing an increase of those limits with the companies involved in the spill.
The Coast Guard said $54.7 million had been spent on cleanup
as of Dec. 14, an average of about $770,000/day.
To recover their costs, federal, state, and local authorities have
filed civil suits against the ship’s owner, Regal Stone Ltd.; its insurer, Shipowners’ Insurance & Guaranty; and the bar pilot who
was at the helm, Capt. John Cota.
A spokesman for the Hong Kong-based Regal Stone said the
company is already paying for private cleanup crews who have
been skimming oil and cleaning beaches.
He said the firm will meet its legal responsibility, but declined

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

to say if it would pay any bill exceeding the $61.8 million.
The Cosco Busan was allowed to leave San Francisco to sail to
South Korea for repairs after its owners agreed to post a $79 million bond as a guarantee the firm would pay its share of the cleanup costs.

PTT privatization OK’d; pipeline assets ceded
A top Thai court has ruled against a Thai consumer group’s petition to nullify the 2001 partial privatization of the former Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT), now PTT PLC.
However, the Supreme Administrative Court also ordered PTT to
cede back to the state its 3,000-km of natural gas pipelines and the
land appropriated to build it, which are valued at about 100 billion
baht ($2.94 billion).
The verdict saved the Thai state-controlled energy giant from
delisting from the Thai stock market, which prevented a blow to
the country’s economy.
However, the court on Dec. 14 ruled that, while the privatization of PTT was lawful, PTT had no right to transfer its (stateowned) assets to a privatized entity and would need to return them
to the state.
Had the court ruled against PTT, which accounts for 15% of
total capitalization on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, it would
have been forced to remove the listing of its stock shares from the
Thai capital market.
PTT has a market capitalization of about 800 billion baht. The
court recognized that forced removal from the Thai stock market
would jeopardize the country’s financial and social state, and even
its security.
Analysts said the transfer of PTT’s pipeline assets could have a
negative impact on the firm and the broader stock market, depending on how it is handled.
But PTT MDNM Pres. Prasert Bunsumpun downplayed the impact, saying the pipeline assets represent just over 10% of PTT’s
combined group assets and generated around 20 billion baht/year
in revenue, a small portion of the estimated 1.4 trillion baht in
revenues projected by the energy conglomerate this year.
Furthermore, Prasert said, PTT is expected to be compensated
for the transfer and will remain the pipelines’ operator.
PTT’s 2001 initial public offering was marred by complaints
about the allocation of shares to those with strong political connections to the administration of Thaksin Shinawatra, the ousted
former prime minister.
Thai consumer groups filed a legal challenge in August 2006 after successfully derailing the partial privatization of the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand, the state power utility, in March
2006 on legal grounds similar to those filed against PTT.

Indonesia to cut taxes to boost production
Indonesian government, in an effort to boost the country’s oil
output, said it will abolish import duty, value added tax, and income tax on imports of capital goods used for oil, natural gas, and
geothermal exploration and development.
Vice-President Jusuf Kalla said the incentives are expected to
boost the country’s oil production to 1.4 million b/d in 2009.
He said Indonesia needs to regain the productivity it had in 1985
when production averaged 1.7 million b/d.
“We had a very large surplus at the time. We could have become
a large oil producer. But why were we not able? Therefore, we will
increase the target further,” Kalla said.
Indonesia’s upstream oil and gas regulator BP Migas said the
country’s daily oil production would continue to fall unless new
fields were developed. Currently, oil production stands at 1.1 million b/d, while demand is at 1.3 million b/d.

BP Migas Deputy Head Trijana Kartoatmodjo said the country’s
oil production is falling by 1.2% a year, while domestic oil demand
is rising by 1.5%.
He said oil production is expected to fall to 982,000 b/d in
2008 and to 971,000 b/d in 2009 from 995,000 b/d in 2007,
while domestic consumption is projected at 1.365 million b/d in
2007, 1.443 million b/d in 2008, and 1.505 million b/d in 2009.
The Economic Research Center of the Indonesian Science Institute
(LIPI) expressed pessimism about the government’s oil output target of 1.034 million b/d for 2008.
The target on which the government calculated the 2008 state
budget is overly optimistic, said Latif Adam, coordinator of the
center’s research team. LIPI’s estimate puts output at 950,000 b/d.
Adam described the government’s crude oil production target,
and the oil price assumption of $60/bbl used for the 2008 state
budget, as “unrealistic.” ✦

Iceland to license Atlantic area in 2009
Iceland has approved its industry minister’s proposal to offer in
January 2009 oil and gas exploration and production licenses in
the Dreki area northeast of Iceland on the Jan Mayen Ridge.
The area lies between Iceland and Norway’s Jan Mayen Island.
Norway’s InSeis shot seismic in a 42,000 sq-km-area in Iceland
waters south of Jan Mayen Island in 2001. Industry has expressed
interest in the area, the ministry said Dec. 18.
The area lies 400 miles northwest of Norwegian continental
shelf oil fields and north of the Faroe Islands, where several fields
have been discovered (see map, OGJ, Aug. 20, 2007, p. 38).
The government said exploratory drilling is necessary to verify
whether oil and gas exist in the Dreki area and that its approval is
based on the findings of a detailed strategic environmental assessment.
Saying considerable discoveries could have a “vigorous impact”
on Iceland’s economy, it promised to place stringent requirements
on work safety and environmental protection.
Discovery of producible quantities of oil and gas at Dreki would
be a major addition to the hydropower and geothermal energy
already produced in Iceland, the government said.

EnCore to appraise Cobra gas ﬁnd in early 2008

Operator EnCore Oil PLC will drill an appraisal well using the
Ensco 80 rig on the Cobra discovery in the UK North Sea in firstquarter 2008.
Cobra, on Block 48/2c, tested gas at a flow rate of 2.7 MMcfd
in 1984 when Amoco initially drilled it.
The company will team with Challenger Minerals (North Sea)
Ltd. in a farmin agreement under which Challenger will receive a
5% share from EnCore in southern North Sea Blocks 48/1b and

Under terms of the farmout agreement, together with the previously announced farmout agreement with Tata Petrodyne and
Bharat Petroleum, EnCore will pay for 3% of the appraisal well cost
(subject to an overall well cost cap) and will retain a 20% interest in the license, EnCore said. EnCore also will remain the license
operator.
Alan Booth, chief executive officer of EnCore, said Cobra would
represent its first operated well. “Cobra lies close to existing infraKazakhstan nonstate gas ﬁeld ﬂow starts

BP lets Skarv FPSO installation to Aker Kvaerner
BP Norway has let a 300 million kroner contract to Aker Kvaerner to tow and install a floating production, storage, and offloading
system (FPSO) at Skarv field in the Norwegian Sea.
Aker Marine Contractors, a subsidiary, will use the offshore construction vessel BOA SUB C for 2010 preinstallation of the 15-leg
mooring system in water as deep as 3,000 m. “The vessel is equipped
with diesel-electric propulsion, dynamic positioning class, 3,400
tonnes active heave compensated crane, and 600 tonnes anchor
handling winch,” Aker Kvaerner said. Planning and engineering will
start in January, and transportation and installation of the complete
FPSO will be executed in 2011. BP wants to develop Skarv and nearby Idun gas field simultaneously, using the FPSO, which will lie in
the Norwegian Sea 200 km west of Sandnessjoen, Norway. It will be
installed between Norne field, 35 km to the north, and Heidrun, 45
km to the south (OGJ Online, Sept. 21, 2007).

Joint venture to supply nitrogen to Mexico
Air Products said a joint venture company with its Grupo Infra
partner will supply 90 MMscfd of nitrogen to Petroleos Mexicanos
Exploracion y Produccion (PEP).
Nitrogen from the gas turbine and steam-driven facility is supplied for injection and enhanced oil and gas recovery from PEP’s
Jujo-Tecominoacan oil fields near Villahermosa in Tabasco, Mexico.
The nitrogen plant project, announced in 2006, began its supply
of nitrogen during November as scheduled.
In 2006, state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos said it planned to

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

invest 13 billion pesos during 2007-21 in Jujo-Tecominoacan oil
field, its second-largest hydrocarbon reservoir in southern Mexico.
The investment is to include completing 11 development wells and
repairing 34 wells as well as the construction of 6 km of oil-gas
pipelines, 25 km of oil pipelines, and 15 km of gas pipelines.
The announcement concerning nitrogen injection coincides
with a report issued by Mexico’s ministry of energy detailing the
country’s oil outlook for 2006-16, as well as key recommendations
for the development of Pemex (OGJ Online, Dec. 14, 2007).

Broom ﬁeld production to start in ﬁrst quarter
Operator Lundin Petroleum AB expects to start oil production
in first-quarter 2008 from its development well 2/5-25 in Broom
field on Block 2/5 on the UK continental shelf.
Lundin is using the GSF Arctic II semisubmersible rig to drill
the well under the field development’s Phase 3. Drilling is under
way on the sidetrack to one of three production wells on the West
Heather structure. It will be tied-back to the existing Heather platform. “The well will receive pressure support from the existing
injection wells,” Lundin said.
Broom field has 30.9 million boe of proved plus probable gross
reserves remaining, with gross total recoverables of 54.7 million
boe. Formerly called West Heather and discovered in 1977, Broom
has oil in Middle and Upper Jurassic reservoirs (OGJ Online, Aug.
7, 2005). Lundin Petroleum holds a 55% interest, and it is working

the new pipeline, which will carry gas from Turkmenistan for delivery to Russia’s gas transportation system, will be built before
yearend 2010.
The pipeline deal will likely disappoint the US and the European
Union, which have been lobbying for a rival pipeline to be built
under the Caspian Sea, bypassing Russia.
In September, Turkmenistan President Gurbanguli Berdymukhamedov said his country was ready to bypass Russia and begin selling some of its gas directly to Europe (OGJ Online, Sept.
21, 2007).
In December, however, Russia and Turkmenistan agreed to accelerate development of the proposed Caspian Gas Pipeline project following talks between OAO Gazprom Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller, President Berdymukhamedov, and Deputy Prime
Minister Tachberdy Tagyyev.

FERC issues EIS for High Plains line expansion
Colorado Interstate Gas Co.’s proposed High Plains natural gas

Energy Regulatory Commission reported.
CIG, a subsidiary of El Paso Corp., Houston, is developing the
$196 million project as a joint venture with Xcel Energy to supply
an additional 899 MMcfd of gas to Colorado’s Front Range system.
It will link Public Service Co. of Colorado’s intrastate system with
the Rockies Express, Wyoming Interstate, and Young Gas Storage
Co. interstate systems.
The project would expand CIG’s existing gas pipeline system
by nearly 164 miles in four separate segments of 24-in. and 30-in.
pipeline and 10 measurement facilities, FERC’s staff said in a final
environmental impact statement issued on Dec. 28.
CIG plans to use existing rights-of-way for nearly 84 miles,
or about 51%, of the proposed route. The company plans to use
project-specific erosion control, revegetation, and maintenance
programs; wetland and water body construction and mitigation
procedures, and hydrostatic testing, reclamation, and invasive species control plans.
FERC said it will consider the staff’s recommendation and final
EIS before issuing a final decision on the project.

Petrobras funded for Amazonas pipelines
The Brazilian National Social and Economic Development Bank
(BNDES) has awarded state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) 2.49 billion reais for the construction of pipelines in Amazonas state.
The funds will be designated for use by Transportadora UrucuManaus SA, which will construct a 383-km, 20-in. natural gas
pipeline connecting Coari and Manaus, where it will have two delivery points.
Additionally, TUM SA also will build distribution branches to
supply seven municipalities located along the pipeline route and a
279-km, 10-in. LPG pipeline connecting the Arara Pole in Urucu
to the Solimoes Terminal in Coari.
The gas will be used initially for thermoelectric power generation in Manaus, replacing fuel oil generators now in use. Gas will
10

later be used to supply the region’s industrial, vehicle, commercial,
and residential sectors.
The project also includes the readaptation of an existing 18-in.
pipeline between Urucu and Coari, which will be interconnected
to the 20-in. line, allowing for gas production outflow.

South Korea offshore oil spill investigated
South Korean authorities said the Hong Kong-based oil tanker,
Hebei Spirit, spilled 12,547 kl of crude oil into the sea west of the
Korean Peninsula, an increase of 19.5%, or 2,047 kl, over the earlier estimate of 10,500 kl.
The Marine Accidents Inquiry Agency said the tanker was carrying 302,641 kl of crude oil and began losing oil after it was hit
Dec. 7 by a barge in the sea about 15 km off western T’aean, South
Chungcheong province, South Korea.
An MAIA official said it was difficult to correctly calculate the
amount of crude left in the tanker because the ship was tilted at
6-7° after the accident.
The tanker sailed to Daesan Port in Seosan.
The Hebei Spirit spill is considered South Korea’s worst. Officials have described it as being about one third of the size of the
Exxon Valdez disaster, which cost a reported $9.5 billion to clean
up and settle.
The Hebei Spirit tanker is registered to the Hebei Spirit Shipping
Co., of Hong Kong. The firm’s manager is Hosco, (Hebei Ocean
Shipping Co.), of Haigang Qu, Qinhuangdao Hebei.

Shell unit enters prepaid utility gas market
Public Energy Authority of Kentucky Inc. and Societe Generale
Energie (USA) Corp. signed a 20-year, $456 million prepaid natural gas contract.
Coral Energy Resources LP, a unit of Shell Energy North America
(US) LP, will supply SGE with 88.6 bcf of gas required for the
transaction, which marks the Shell subsidiary’s entry into the municipal natural gas prepayment market.
SGE will deliver the gas to PEAK, a municipal joint action agency organized by the cities of Carrollton and Henderson in northern
Kentucky.
PEAK will use the supply to serve base load gas requirements of
its municipal members and participants in Kentucky, South Carolina, New Mexico, and Alabama.
PEAK, which financed the prepayment with the proceeds of revenue bonds, concluded two earlier prepayment deals in 1998 and
2006.
The deals secure long-term, reliable gas supplies in volatile energy markets. ✦

Molecular sieves

_____________

12

Knowing the plants of Saudi Aramco
well and being in charge of product
management of CECA SILIPORITE molecular sieves, I would like to comment
on the article by Ahmed Ghazal (“Common errors can cause mol-sieve desiccant deterioration”; OGJ, Nov. 26, 2007,
p. 62) to prevent misunderstanding.
Molecular sieves remove dissolved
water (speaking about liquids) but
should not be in contact with entrained
water, as the article relates. Entrained
water will saturate them quite fast, given
the likely huge amount of water entrained, may lead to local temperature
peaks leading to faster aging, and may
bring all kind of “aggressive” molecules
(e.g., amines) with it, destroying either
the binder or the zeolite (active material
of the molecular sieve) or both.
In our more than 40 years’ experience, we cannot confirm the fact of ion
leaching due to use of molecular sieves
of different suppliers. Different suppliers
would mean different types of zeolite
and different binders. Indeed a single
supplier may have to supply molecular
sieves for natural sweetening (mercaptan
removal), which would include different types (4A, 5A, 13X sieves) fabricated
with different binders. No problems of
ion leaching due to the composition
would be noticed.
Moreover, the problems observed in
YGP might be due to liquid carryover,
causing chemical attack or simply hydrothermal damaging due to a poor regeneration procedure. Poor regeneration
procedure means in this case heating too
fast (no intermediate heating ramp) and
causing water desorption from the layers
at the inlet of heating gas and condensation of water at the still-cold layers at the
opposite site of the bed.
This liquid water together with the
high regeneration temperature will lead
to boiling of the sieves in the liquid
water, causing hydrothermal damaging.
Hydrothermal damaging means attack
of the binder, destruction of the crystal
structure of the zeolite, or pore closure
of the zeolite.
I agree with the author that it is better to use only fresh molecular sieve in

order to get the process guarantee from the supplier, ensure
the life time of the sieves (the costs of some days of production loss due to premature shutdown of the plant is huge
compared with the price of a load of sieves), and start with
low pressure drop as unloading and screening of the used
sieves will decrease the average particle size leading to higher
pressure drop.
It is strange, however, to see large beads (1⁄8-in. equivalent
or 2.5-5 mm beads or 3.2 mm pellets) in a liquid dryer. Usually small particle size—1⁄16 in. equivalent—is recommended
as the mass transfer is much shorter. For 1⁄8-in. particle, easily
half of the vessel might be used for the mass-transfer zone.
The mass-transfer zone is used to meet the specifications of
the product—in this case 10 ppm (wt)—but does not adsorb
a lot of water.
Using large particles in this case shows that the initial
design is poor and short. This could be the case if fluidization should be prevented. This poor design might also be the
origin of molecular sieve failure.
Peter Meyer
Business Manager Dynamic Applications
Molecular Sieves CECA SA

Ghazal replies
The occurrence of ion leaching at the mentioned site
was verified by Aramco’s Research and Development Center
through internal research and a series of lab tests.
Data obtained from subject study revealed a clear relationship between the instigation of ion leaching and presence
of dissimilar desiccant materials, in the same vessel, that are
supplied by different vendors and consist of different binder
additives. Chemical attacks, poor regeneration procedures,
and application of inaccurate loading configurations are all
typical causes of desiccant failure and widely known among
operating facilities.
The fact of the matter is that all troubleshooting attempts
start by investigating the more obvious factors stated by Mr.
Meyer and a rather vigorous study is initiated once the aforementioned bases are covered.
The highlighted desiccant particle sizes do not represent
existing setup at Yanbu gas plant; the information was merely
mentioned in my article to describe proper loading configuration for different layers within typical dehydration beds
that serve sweet liquid hydrocarbon streams (propane and
butane). I also might add that reflected desiccant size was obtained from engineering standards and manufacturer loading
guidelines.
Although the mixture of different desiccant in the same
dehydrator is no longer permitted at Saudi Aramco sites, we
still allow use of different brands for adjacent vessels, meaning that Bed A could possibly be loaded with a different material than Bed B.

Hetrick told OGJ that he tries to clear

puts the industry’s activities in perspective.
Even facility ownership can be complex. The High Island A389 platform, a
favorite dive spot for DUOY, was originally controlled by Mobil Oil, passed to
ExxonMobil, then Vastar, BP, and is now
operated by W&T Offshore.
Diving at the Flower Garden Banks
and on the platforms is more akin to
recreational diving than to commercial
diving, Hetrick told OGJ, though it still
carries some risk.
The educators ask a lot of questions,
and throughout the Q&A, Hetrick tried
to point out that the industry works
hard to put people’s safety first, prevent
harm to the environment, and protect
property and facilities from damage.
When demand for petroleum changes,

A new energy agenda
In an intensely political year, the US oil and gas
industry should seek opportunities to reconcile
energy politics with consumer interests. Politicians
and consumers now travel contradictory paths.
The current political agenda on energy emerges
from an undisciplined legislature taking its cues
from environmental extremists, fuel suppliers
seeking favors, and a president eager to distance
himself from oil and gas. The product is a regulatory system certain to collapse under the burden
it is creating for consumers. Its centerpiece is an
ethanol mandate that makes no energy or environmental sense, that saps the federal treasury, and
that drives up food costs.
Yet Congress just quintupled the ethanol
requirement to make corn growers and distillers
happy. It acted even though costs of the original
mandate have come into clear focus. It acted when
no politician of either party dared anger the farm
business: just weeks before fateful presidential
caucuses in Iowa. And it acted in a way that makes
the political agenda look not only confused but
also corrupt.

The agenda must change. The US needs a
political agenda on energy that’s centered on the
interests not of environmental extremists, fuel
suppliers, and politicians but of energy consumers. Those interests are easy to identify. Consumers
need reliable supply of affordable energy; mitigation of the health, safety, and environmental risks
of energy production and use; and freedom of
economic choice.
An agenda that includes those elements of consumer interest doesn’t exclude conservation and
alternative energy. It simply makes room for essentials such as currently dominant energy forms,
which will not disappear under any circumstances,
and market freedom.
The oil and gas industry must find a way to
advance a political agenda on energy that’s broader
than the one now in place. It won’t change the
agenda in Washington, DC, where it has limited
credibility. It has to start with energy consumers,
the interests of whom any replacement agenda
must have at its core.

The agenda now

A consumer-centered agenda works. One of the
most hopeful developments in energy politics in recent years was the discussion in 2005-06 of federal
oil and gas leasing—or at least gas leasing—off the
East Coast. The effort stalled when Democrats won
control of Congress and exploited rising energy
prices for political theater instead citing them as the
reason they are to act meaningfully on supply. What
remains important is that the push for East Coast
leasing came less from oil and gas producers than
from consumers—industries and states hurt by rising prices of natural gas and recognizing how new
supply would solve their problem.
Under the current political agenda, an agenda
that forces conservation and the use of nonhydrocarbon energy to the exclusion of cheaper and
larger sources of supply, consumers face a future
of too little energy and too much cost. As those
costs become clear, they’ll listen to suggestions
for something better. The oil and gas industry
should be ready to offer a superior agenda—not to
politicians but to the consumers the agenda must
serve. ✦

Ethanol draws specious intellectual support
from a political agenda obsessed with conservation
and alternatives to oil, gas, and coal. In an energy
market that the Energy Information Administration expects, under reference case assumptions, to
grow by 24% during 2006-30, conservation and
alternative energy forms are surely necessary. They
just aren’t sufficient. The US can’t conserve away expected market growth without requiring economic
sacrifice Americans won’t and shouldn’t be forced
to accept. And alternative sources, important as they
are as supplements, can’t fill the supply void.
If it is to sustain standards of living and grow,
the US needs not only more conservation and
more alternative energy but also more oil, gas,
coal, and nuclear power. Focused as it is on conservation and alternative energy, however, the US
political agenda ignores and in many ways disparages traditional energy forms, the forms with
commanding shares of the market and therefore
those best able to address US supply problems
promptly and economically.

Focus on consumers

Aggravating these shortages in materials and people, in the view of some

Elevated gas prices since the mid1990s have in part spawned the resurgence of LNG as a transportation mode.

Republicans alike—will have to believably reinforce their own definitions of
“energy security” and “energy independence” and how they would uphold
these definitions in office.
In a speech at the Brookings Institution on Dec. 18, US Sen. Dick Lugar
(R-Ind.) said, “I would state unequivocally that energy security and the economic and environmental issues closely
associated with it should be the most
important topics of the 2008 presidential election (OGJ, Dec. 24, 2007, p.

There are two contracts with Morocco and Gas Natural. We have the
right to increase the price. The contract
was signed in 1995 and now we are
in 2008; at that time oil was $15/bbl,
now it’s $90/bbl. So, definitely there
has to be an increase in price.
The third issue is that Sonatrach
cancelled the contract with Gas Natural
and Repsol. We are under arbitration
because we are seeking reparation for
the fact that they didn’t comply with
the contract’s terms. Gassi Touil was
supposed to come on stream in 2009,
and they came out saying it will come
on stream in 2012. That’s 3 years’ delay,
and that’s not complying with the contract. That’s why it was cancelled.
OGJ: How does Algeria regard the
restructuring of the European gas sector?
Khelil: We are always in favor because we have restructured our gas and
oil sector. We probably have the most
open gas sector; we have distribution
companies and transportation companies and, of course, producing companies. We have regulatory authorities, so
we are maybe better than some of the
European countries in terms of reforms.
Now, in Europe, the problem is that
every country has a different view on
what they mean by a liberalized sector.
The view of the European Commission
is that the gas sector should be run by
independent companies that don’t have
a conflict of interest in marketing the
gas. But that’s not the view necessarily of some European countries; they
feel that their companies should have a
major role in controlling some of those
pipelines. So, in that respect it doesn’t
affect us because we’re not interested in
gas pipelines and trunk lines in Europe.
Second, we are going to be selling
gas—whether it’s [to] an independent
company or an operator, the only impact is going to be [on] the consumer.
If it’s an independent, probably the
consumer would enjoy the benefits of
competition. If it’s someone with a monopoly, then of course there is a price
to pay by the consumer.
The other thing is the issue of
reciprocity, which is mentioned by

the European Commission’s directive.
It doesn’t affect Algeria; we are open,
and companies are operating there. In
the upstream and in petrochemicals
we do bidding, so it’s open. We would
like reciprocity ourselves; we did not
have reciprocity with Medgaz. We were
curtailed and of course we protested.
[Spain’s national energy commission],
the CNE, decided that we could only
distribute 1 billion cu m out of 3 billion cu m, so the question was, ‘What
do I do with the 2 billion cu m?’ At
the same time they made a decision
to interfere with the Medgaz company
and all of that was really very bad. It
left a really bad feeling for producing
countries that play the game and make
investments.
We talk about security of demand;
you hear about security of supply, but
our concern is security of demand.
The first problem we had was trying to
export gas to the US in 1970. We had a
long-term contract, and suddenly from
one day to another, after doing huge
investments, the market wasn’t there.
We had to renegotiate the whole thing
and find other uses for our gas.
OGJ: How do you see cooperation
with Gazprom evolving?
Khelil: It’s not developing: we don’t
have any cooperation. We signed a
[memorandum of understanding] with
them; we signed one with Shell and Statoil. We are not in any discussions with
them [Gazprom] at all about projects.
OGJ: How is Sonatrach’s international investment program going?
Khelil: Over the long term we are
planning to have at least 30% of our
production coming from outside [Algeria] by 2015. Part of it is the Algerian licensing round and we are being
aggressive ourselves by bidding in other
countries as well. Whenever we offer
blocks in Algeria we’d like to use this
to leverage our participation outside
because most of these companies have
that.
OGJ: There has been a lot of criticism of Algeria on resource nationalism.
What is your response to that?
Khelil: Resource nationalism is not

particular to Algeria. It’s also with the
US: there was the Unocal affair, which
was not an Algerian affair. Spain not
letting a German company take over
a Spanish one is not Algerian. French
companies not letting non-French
companies take over their companies is
not Algerian. I don’t see what they call
resource nationalism.
We imposed tax on exceptional
profits, which is not considered to be
resource nationalism. It just takes into
account that when the contracts were
signed in the 80’s the oil price was
$15/bbl, now the oil price is $90/
bbl. Some of these contracts didn’t
include the mechanism by which the
state would receive a fair share when
the oil price would go that high. The
state of Algeria has taken the decision
that it would get a fair share, and that is
not specific to Algeria. Even Alberta has
put tax on royalties, and the US has put
taxes on offshore assets in the Gulf of
Mexico.
It’s just a matter of tremendous
changes in the market and to avoid
upheavals. Our demands are based on
logic: If you sign a contract based on
$15/bbl you expect a certain return.
But if you get $90/bbl you are getting more than what you expected. In
any case it is the same company that is
making very good returns. They have a
choice not to come to Algeria: We are
not forcing them. They are free to go
to Libya and to any other country that
offers them better conditions.
OGJ: But Gassi Touil has been given
as an example where Algeria has seized
back a project that was meant to have
international partners.
Khelil: That’s not the issue. It doesn’t
have anything to do with resource
nationalism. If the companies had met
their contract commitments I don’t
think that anything would have happened. They wanted to renegotiate, but
we are in arbitration and that will determine if we did the right or the wrong
thing. We are asking for reparations
because we lost a lot in this process.
This project was done by bidding; it
was not negotiated. You can’t go back to

the second bidder; it’s too late.
OGJ: Can you tell me how much
you’re seeking and how much you’ve
lost?
Khelil: I can’t tell you. That’s part of
the arbitration. The minister of Spain’s
foreign affairs said that this is a commercial issue. It’s not about politics.
OGJ: Can Sonatrach still make
money in refining when oil is being
sold at $90/bbl?
Khelil: Sonatrach is an integrated
company and it has to look at it long
term. We are going to build a new refinery. We have finished a small refinery
of 16,000 b/d in the south with the
Chinese, and they have 70%. It started
operations earlier this year. We are
finishing a 100,000 b/d condensate
refinery in Skikda, built by the Chinese,
which will be finished next year. We are
building a new 300,000 b/d refinery
south of Algiers, and that is still under
bidding for the EPC. It will probably be
ready by 2013.
OGJ: Have you started discussions
with Brazil about joining OPEC?

Khelil: No, we haven’t and their
president said that they might become members of OPEC. I don’t know
whether it’s true or not, but it’s been reported by the press. Apparently Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has discovered
large reserves, and by the time they are
able to develop those reserves and by
the time they can increase production
to the level of being exporters, instead
of net importers, that will be at least 4
or 5 years. What I’m saying is that we
will welcome any country for that and
we have Sudan as one observer status
and Equatorial Guinea as another as it’s
a net oil exporter.
OGJ: What kind of initiatives do you
want to implement to turn around the
credibility of OPEC?
Khelil: Credibility is what we did in
2001 when I was president: whatever
we say, we do and not to say something and do something else. We want
to have credibility with the consuming countries, and I think the other
thing we mentioned was to improve
the dialogue with consuming nations,

the International Energy Agency, with
whom we have good relations. We are
working on an information databank
to make all the data about the oil market transparent.
But we need to work more on the
financial markets because financial
markets have a tremendous impact on
the oil markets through the speculation of operators. We need to work with
the consuming nations to see how the
financial markets could be improved,
either through regulations or more
transparency of various operations so as
to have less impact on the oil market. As
you know speculation has tremendous
impact on the market.
OGJ: Do you have an oil price forecast?
Khelil: No, but all I can say is that oil
prices will remain at this level. It will
maybe strengthen in the first quarter
of 2008 because some people say there
will be some bad weather. But in the
second quarter I think there will be
some relaxation on the oil price because
of lower demand. ✦

discussing the Roan Plateau’s future and
will continue talks over coming weeks,
Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter said on Dec. 20.
The federally and privately owned
northwestern Colorado plateau became

a prominent resource access symbol

Democrats from the state, John T. Salazar
and Mark Udall, tried to delay further
federal oil and gas leasing there with
amendments to various bills.

his year promises to be an
exciting and challenging year
in Washington, DC, for the oil and
gas business. But before it gets too
far under way, let’s revisit some of
2007’s more entertaining moments
and properly recognize their instigators. Yes, it’s time for the “Watchies,”
this column’s annual salute to the
past year’s most amusing moments in
government.
As in previous years, most of the
winners are members of Congress.
Roger W. Sant, who chairs the Smithsonian Institution’s board of regents,
is not. He still receives this year’s
“Good Will and Enlightenment”
Watchy for questioning the museum’s acceptance of $5 million from
the American Petroleum Institute
to help underwrite a major oceans
exhibit. API, which senior Smithsonian staffers had approached earlier
in the year, quietly withdrew the gift
before it could come to a vote before
the regents.
Sant reportedly felt that ocean life
preservation and petroleum industry
activity are incompatible. In addition
to being a former chairman of the
World Wildlife Fund, he also founded
and chaired AES Corp., which is encountering opposition to its planned
LNG terminals near Baltimore and
Boston.

J. Durbin (D-Ill.) for declaring on
Dec. 13 that “the oil companies are
celebrating in their boardrooms”
after a cloture motion failed by one
vote, dooming the 2007 energy bill’s
punitive tax provisions.
The many runners up in the
House and Senate were merely tuning up their rhetoric for the 2008
elections. There’s not enough space to
discuss what’s at various presidential
candidates’ web sites. Let’s just say
that competition will be fierce for
this Watchy this year.
Committee hearings also were
entertaining. Rep. Jay Inslee (DWash.) wins a “Deja Vu” Watchy for
his May testimony before the House
Natural Resources Committee urging incentives to stimulate marine
renewable energy development. It
was reminiscent of calls in the early
1990s to suspend royalties for initial
deepwater oil production in the Gulf
of Mexico.

Cultural relevance

Finally, Rep. Stevan Pearce (R-NM)
wins the first “Cultural Relevance”

hearing. It’s not certain whether he

generations to do everything we can
to accomplish our goals,” Ritter said in
Denver.
C. Stephen Allred, assistant US Interior secretary for land and minerals,
said he welcomed Ritter’s views. Allred
added that he and BLM Director Jim
Caswell will continue to work with BLM
Colorado State Director Sally Wisely and
the state government.
Udall said he would have preferred
that Congress adopt statutory provisions
to protect the area, “but in the absence
of action by Congress I believe the
governor’s approach represents our best
opportunity to achieve that goal.”
Meg Collins, president of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, said COGA
was pleased with Ritter’s announcement
“and the fact that he recognizes the
vast resource potential within the Roan
Plateau and the potential for substantial
revenue for the state. Most importantly,
we’re pleased that Gov. Ritter acknowledges the important role technology
plays in extracting natural gas from
environmentally sensitive places.”
COGA recognizes that discussions regarding future Roan Plateau leasing are
ongoing and looks forward to meeting
with the governor and other stakeholders, she continued.
One of Ritter’s main goals would
be to expand four wildlife protection zones, designated Areas of Critical
Environmental Concern by BLM, which
currently total 21,032 acres. Udall said
that if the Bush administration accepted
Ritter’s suggestions, about 80% of the
top of the Roan Plateau would fall under that designation.
Ritter also would like BLM to explore phased or incremental leasing to
increase state revenues, reduce environmental impacts, and “properly pace
future development.” He also suggested
possibly amending the 1997 federal
land transfer law to ensure that the state
receives bonus payments from future
leasing on the plateau.
The law moved ownership of Naval
Oil Shale Reserves 1 and 3 on the plateau from the US Department of Energy
to BLM. It also instructed the DOI agenOil & Gas Journal / Jan. 7, 2008

cy to develop a multiple-use resource management plan for
the area and issue oil and gas leases “as soon as practicable,”
according to BLM. Its current management plan would allow
91% recovery of the estimated 8.9 tcf of natural gas while
protecting 51% of the plateau.
Ritter said he also would like any future leasing there to
incorporate state-of-the-art technology to minimize environmental disturbance and to provide sustained economic
benefits to local communities and businesses.
The federal government owns 73,620 acres, or 58% of
the surface, within the Roan Plateau Planning Area, while
energy companies, ranchers and other private entities hold
the remaining 42%, according to information at the governor’s web site. It said that BLM’s current plan is to lease all
available acreage at once, resulting in up to 1,560 wells on
193 well pads being developed over 20 years. Surface disturbances would be limited to 350 acres at a time, and wells
would be clustered on multiwell pads, it said. ✦

BLM publishes draft program EIS for
commercial oil shale development
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Bureau of Land Management published a draft
programmatic environmental impact statement on Dec. 21
to guide future management of 1.9 million acres in Utah,
Colorado, and Wyoming for potential commercial oil shale
development.
A federally published draft complies with Section 369(d)
of the 2005 Energy Policy Act, which declares oil shale and
other unconventional fuels to be strategically important domestic energy sources which should be developed to reduce
US reliance on imported oil, the Department of the Interior
agency said.
“The potential of America’s oil shale resources to meet
future US demand for fuel is significant. Oil shale deposits
on public lands hold the equivalent of 1.23 trillion bbl of
oil. The lands we are proposing to make available are estimated to hold, at a minimum, the equivalent of 61 billion
bbl,” BLM Director Jim Caswell said on Dec. 20.
Rep. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) and other politicians expressed
concern following EPACT’s passage that the law did not
adequately consider possible economic, social, and environmental impacts of oil shale resource development on nearby
communities.
Caswell said BLM is taking a thoughtful, deliberate approach to completing the program’s EIS because there is no
federal program for leasing these resources. BLM cooperated
with 14 federal, state and local government agencies as it
developed the draft over nearly 2 years, he said.

The draft programmatic EIS would
not authorize any commercial development projects, provide for any leases
to be issued, or commit BLM to any
particular course of action, Caswell
emphasized.
He said that its alternatives would
exclude between 305,000 and 1.5
million acres from leasing. No leasing
would be allowed in wilderness areas,

wilderness study areas, other units of
BLM’s National Landscape Conservation System or critical environmental
concern areas that are closed to mineral

The draft proposes that oil shale
resources on identified lands would be
leased as a solid mineral and additional
site-specific analysis under the National

Environmental Impact Act would be
completed on each application before
any lease could be issued, according to
BLM.

proposal for 60 days following federal publication. The complete draft is

California suing EPA over greenhouse gas rules
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
California has filed a lawsuit against
the US Environmental Protection Agency. The anticipated action comes after
the EPA last month denied California a
waiver that the state requested under
the US Clean Air Act.
The requested waiver would have
allowed California to impose tougher
standards on motor vehicles’ emissions
32

than federal regulations require (OGJ,
June 25, 2007, p. 31).
More than 12 other states are expected to join California’s suit against EPA.
These states have adopted the California
emissions standards for GHG emissions
from new cars and trucks.
California Atty. Gen. Jerry Brown
called a news conference, saying the
lawsuit was filed on Jan. 2 in the 9th US
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
He expects that the federal government

will try to have the case transferred to an
appeals court in Washington, DC.
Brown suggested EPA’s decision was
made after “White House pressure,
automobile influence, or some other
lobbying pressure.”
The vehicle regulations are part of
California’s global warming law that
seeks to reduce GHG emissions statewide by 25%, or to 1990 levels, by
2020.

Ecuador lifts emergency
decree; will probe abuses
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Ecuador has reached an agreement
with human rights organizations and
regional leaders and has lifted the state
of emergency it decreed on Nov. 29 in
the province of Orellana.
The agreement calls for the creation
of a commission to investigate charges
of human rights abuses connected with
the emergency decree, which came
after protests shut down a key oil-production facility operated by Ecuadoran
State Petroleum Enterprise.
President Rafael Correa decreed
the state of emergency in the Dayuma
region in order to control protests by
local residents who were demanding
public works projects.
At the time, Correa said, “What we
have are organized mafias under the
orders of political bosses who live for
conflict and are the last ones who want
things to be resolved.”
Authorities arrested a score of people
under charges of sedition, but Interior
Minister Fernando Bustamante has said
that authorities would determine if the
army committed excesses at the time.
“If there has been any abuse of
authority, evidence will be gathered,”
he said. “The commission will ensure
that disciplinary measures are taken and
compensation is made.”
Justice Minister Gustavo Jalk nonetheless said he will act quickly to identify the people who were responsible
for acts of sabotage performed around
the Dayuma facility. ✦

Khodorkovsky’s
new year

W

hatever the new year may hold
for most of us in the oil and
gas industry, it will likely resemble
nothing close to what’s in store for
jailed Yukos founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his business partner
Platon Lebedev.
Remember them? If not, recent
reports say that a court in the city of
Chita, where the men are jailed, has
extended custody for them until Feb.
8, pending a new investigation into
their activities.
The new charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, who were
convicted of fraud and tax evasion
in 2005, include stealing government shares, expropriating oil, and
laundering $25 billion earned from
oil sales in 1998-2004.
The new investigation was upheld
by the Moscow City Court on Sept.
19, 2007, while Russia’s Supreme
Court ruled on Dec. 25 that the investigation was legal. How’s that for a
Christmas present?
Khodorkovsky, who acquired oil
assets through privatization deals in
the 1990s, insists that his prosecution
was orchestrated by the authorities
to silence his criticism of President
Vladimir Putin, and as part of a
campaign to bring oil and gas assets
under the Kremlin’s control.

“Everything that has taken place in
connection with this case has already been translated into the official
languages of the European Court,”
the former oil tycoon’s lawyer, Yury
Shmidt, said.
But don’t hope for much—especially given the experience of former
Yukos Vice-Pres. Vasily Aleksanyan,
who is currently in custody, and insisting on the need for hospitalization
due to his grave illness.
“Russia must comply with already
the third instruction from the European Court of Human Rights about my
urgent hospitalization to a specialized
civilian clinic from the prison where I
am now,” Aleksanyan wrote in a letter
from the pretrial detention facility.

No pity

The letter said that more than a
year ago, following a forensic examination, Aleksanyan was diagnosed
with a terminal illness.
“Already at that time my condition
required intensive chemotherapy to
ease symptoms and to prolong life.
Experts said in their report that my
staying in prison directly depends
on how soon the chemotherapy will
start,” the letter said.
“By October this year, my condition has become life-threatening.

4,260-4,340 m. It consists of shallowing-upward cycles that are best developed within the transgressive systems

2 and 3).
The cycles consist of a
Lithocodium-dominated reef facies or a grainstone shoal facies
capped by Lithocodium boundstone that developed in the high
energy setting of the platform
margin (Fig. 3). The porosity
in the upper reservoir is mostly
primary, but it was enhanced by partial
dissolution during short term subaerial
exposure of the platform (Fig. 5).
The Darkhowain structure is a combination trap in which the impermeable
quiet water carbonates of the TST of the

Previous stratigraphic workers1-3
considered the Fahliyan formation as a
single shallow marine unit of Early Cretaceous age. Recent facies analysis and
high resolution sequence stratigraphic
studies, however, have revealed that
the Fahliyan formation consists of two
unconformity-bounded sequences of
Berriasian-Valanginian age containing
both shallow (restricted marine, barrier,
and open marine) and deep marine
(pelagic and calciturbidite) facies.4-6
The first well on the Darkhowain
structure (D-1) was drilled in 1964 on a
north-south trending closure near Abadan in Southwest Iran (Fig. 1). It reached
the upper few meters of the Fahliyan
formation with some oil shows in the

active during the deposition.
The widespread development of
reservoirs in the platform facies and the
proximity to the organic-rich, deepwater Garu formation and other important
source rocks have made the Fahliyan
formation one of the important exploration targets in the Persian Gulf region
of Southwest Iran. The rocks with the
greatest hydrocarbon reservoir potential occur within the shallow marine
carbonates of the isolated platforms
surrounded by the deepwater Garu
intrashelf basin (Fig. 2).
The results of this study indicate
that high-resolution sequence stratigraphic analysis could significantly aid
exploration and enhance production,
development, and secondary recovery
in the Persian Gulf and other petroleum
provinces.

Basinal facies

The second phase of development
that is currently under way is expected
to increase the production of Darkhowain field to 160,000 b/d. The reservoirs
in Darkhowain-3 are poorly developed
because it is located off the platform,
where deeper-water facies were deposited and exposure to freshwater was
limited.

Field structure
In a sharp contrast to the northwestsoutheast trending structures of the Zagros Mountain front, Darkhowain field
is a north-south trending drapeover
anticline (Fig. 1) surrounded by a N-S
trending, deepwater intrashelf basin.
The structure was formed during the
Cretaceous prior to or during the deposition of the Fahliyan formation probably
as a result of reactivation of north-south
trending normal faults3 6 7 associated
with the Carboniferous to Early Permian rifting of the Neotethys in Northeast
Gondwana.8
The platform-to-basin facies distribution indicates that the Darkhowain
structure was an isolated carbonate
platform within the deepwater Garu
Intrashelf basin during the entire Cretaceous.
This basin9 was the site of deposition
of several thousand meters of LowerUpper Cretaceous dark gray organic

Fahliyan formation occurs in the HST
tract of the lower sequence below the
sequence boundary. A basinward progradation of the lagoonal and barrier
facies during the sea-level highstand
was followed by a subaerial exposure to
fresh water during a late Valanginian sea
level lowstand. Extensive karstification
created widespread cavernous and channel porosity by diagenetic dissolution of
carbonate grains and the interstitial matrix of the originally impermeable late
highstand lagoonal facies (Figs. 2-4).
The most productive wells (over
16,000 b/d) are associated with this
oil-saturated reservoir (over 200 m
thick) at depths of 4,350-4,500 m.
In contrast to the lower sequence,
the reservoir in the upper sequence is
best developed within the TST (Figs. 2
and 3). The reservoir rock is a reef facies
dominated by Lithocodium or ooid/
bioclast or intraclast grainstone shoal
facies capped by Lithocodium boundstone (Fig. 5).
Lithocodium is a calcareous alga
with irregular fenestral structure (Fig.
5) that was an important reef builder
during Valanginian-Aptian time.17 The
upper reservoir is over 80 m thick and
occurs at depths of 4,260-4,340 m.
Porosity development in the upper
sequence was controlled by reef growth
and the high energy setting of the shelf
margin that generated primary porosity
which was later enhanced by freshwater
dissolution during short term sea level
falls. A tight, open-marine facies capped
the reservoirs forming the trap.
The highstand tract of the upper
sequence is less productive or even
nonproductive due to the well-cemented
grainstone shoal facies and thin Lithocodium patch reefs of the lagoonal setting.

Wells activity in Shell has increased by
about 50% since 2003, obliging the
company to recruit more than 650 new
engineers over the last 4 years.
Shell’s overall priority is safety and
Sharpe says he will never consider himself successful in his job until all operations under the Wells function

at the same time achieving his
second goal of beating the competition
in operational performance.

Business environment
Sharpe noted that cost inflation
across the industry has been significant
over the last few years. “We’re writing
bigger checks for almost everything
we do.” While the service sector has

O D U C T I O N

struggled to maintain standards, “it
is certainly easier to build new hardware than it is to develop experienced
people.”
A leader in deep water, Shell anticipated the market and made a series
of long-term commitments for rigs
in 2005. This has resulted in Shell’s
deepwater fleet costs being about 30%
below the current market average.
Sharpe said
that Shell had

Career highlights
Peter J. Sharpe is vice-president of Wells and chief well engineer for Shell
International Exploration & Production BV, based in The Hague.
Since joining Shell in 1990, Sharpe worked in the Netherlands as a senior
drilling engineer, in Albania and China as operations manager, in Brunei as head
of well delivery and later, as an asset manager. He was appointed regional
wells manager for Shell’s Asia-Paciﬁc region in 2003 and was promoted to his
current position on Jan. 1, 2007.
Employment
Sharpe began his career in exploration logging in Southeast Asia. He went
on to work as a consultant for numerous operators in Thailand, Indonesia,
Philippines, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Denmark before ending up as consultant
for Shell in Syria and deciding to join them when he realized “that they had the
best-trained people in the business.”
Education
Sharpe holds a BSc in geology (1980) from Hull University, Kingston upon
Hull, England. He has since attended myriad training courses, classes, workshops, symposia, and meetings within Shell.

and improved “technical prowess,”
which he defined as staff capability
to successfully integrate and implement the complex technical solutions
required to develop an increasingly
demanding range of projects.
A key focus area for Shell through
this period of intense business growth
has been people. Sharpe believes that
Shell’s industry recognized proprietary “Round I/II” staff development
program gives them a real competitive
edge in this critical area. Shell recently
expanded the curriculum to cover all
areas of completion and well intervention. Every year, the company starts
more than 100 graduates from around
the world in this multiyear program.
Upon completing the program, the
work can be credited as a MSc. with a
leading UK university.
The Wells function in Shell also has
a well developed “technical ladder”
which ensures that people who want
technical careers can progress through
positions such as principal technical
expert and chief scientist to reach the
most senior job grades without having to move into general management
positions.

Technology
Sharpe said that Shell classifies
40

technologies as either evolutionary or
revolutionary. “If the technology is key
to what we’re working on, we’ll take it
on ourselves,” he said.
Shell has invested heavily in research,
development, and deployment of new
technologies. It took directional drilling
along a new path, successfully drilling
snake and dragon wells in Southeast
Asia. Sharpe is confident that surface
BOP systems, as planned for the BC-10
development in Brazil, and monodiameter expandables, as recently trialed in
the Gulf of Mexico, together with the
new Bully rig design will all play a part
in Shell’s plans for efficient deepwater
drilling.
Another deepwater technology enabler that Shell recently worked on with
Noble Corp. was the aluminum riser on
the Noble Clyde Boudreaux semisubmersible, now on the Perdido project
in the Gulf of Mexico. Sharpe told OGJ
that Charlie Williams, one of Shell’s
chief scientists, had been instrumental
in troubleshooting welding procedures.
The new riser was successfully deployed
in early December 2007.

and using the technical limit methodology has significantly improved drilling
performance in several key projects
in 2007, such as Pinedale (OGJ, Oct.
15, 2007, p. 52). The rDTL program is
currently being implemented across all
of Shells major drilling projects. Sharpe
said that Shell’s target is to have 75%
of its wells benchmarked in the top
quartile by the end of the decade.
About 20% of the E&P industry’s
capital expenditure on drilling is lost
to nonproductive time. Shell uses its
system of worldwide real-time operations centers (RTOCs) for well planning
and optimized drilling. This also leads to
improved safety and efficiency because
it depopulates offshore facilities and
allows scarce expertise to cover multiple
projects. For example, vibration-related
problems on an operation in Inner
Mongolia were addressed in real time
by experts in Shells research center.

Contractor performance
Shell has been collecting key performance data on drilling contractors
for more than 5 years, using a series
of KPIs to construct contractor performance league tables that it can use in
rig tender evaluation. Sharpe said the
data show that the performance of most
contractors has been deteriorating over
the last 2 years, as they have struggled
to cope with business growth, but are
now starting to show signs of improvement.
The company also collects performance statistics on key services such as
directional drilling, logging services,
drilling fluids, and cementing.

particular, worries him because of “falling experience levels in the industry
due to business growth.”

Safety—’Goal Zero’
“Looking back on my career, the
only things I’ll truly remember, other
than my colleagues and the friends
made, are the accidents that have occurred on my watch,” Sharpe said. He
stressed that they want no one to get
hurt, and expect all vendors to meet the
company’s ambitious safety standards.
The Wells group aspires to reach
“Goal Zero” and Sharpe wants to
“integrate safety into everything we
do” by focusing on the risk, listening
carefully to contractors, and simplifying standards. Sharpe believes “simpler
is always better but is usually more
difficult” and that people want to do
the right thing but need clear rules so
that they can comply. He felt that most
people know that rules and compliance
save lives but that in many cases the
rules have become so complex that they
are impossible to follow.
Sharpe stressed the importance of investigating near-miss incidents the same
way serious injuries are investigated in
order to share what is learned. Reviewing the company’s high-potential
near-miss incidents, his team found that
dropped objects were “far and away the
highest area of risk” in 2007.
Sharpe has spent 2007 ensuring that
his teams distill the key learning and action and then tailor the communication
so that the right people get the right
information in a way that they can understand. He explained that giving the
same incident investigation report to
an HSE professional, a manager, and an
OIM was hardly the best way to ensure
that they all got the information that
they needed to take action and make a
difference.
Improving the cascade of key learning from incidents is still an area that
Sharpe feels can be improved in Shell.
He questions whether the same level
of intensity and urgency goes into the
follow up and verification of action
close-out as went into the initial inves-

“Looking back on
my career, the only
things I’ll truly remember, other than
my colleagues and

watch.”

tigation. “Leaders who set clear safety
expectations, but then don’t ensure that
they are met, are poor leaders.”
Sharpe makes at least one HSE trip/
month and recently visited an operation
that had experienced several high potential, near miss incidents. He wanted
to understand what needed to change
and what could be learned. Among
other things, an overload of distractions
during start up, a new crew, and new
operation had reduced the focus on
safety. Rig start-up is a high-risk activity,
he said, and we must do a better job
in ensuring that we have the right level
of supervision and sufficient time to ensure we do it incident free. Another trip
highlighted the difficulty of communicating incident learning. Sharpe discovered that the crew believed the key
learning from an incident was around
hardware while management was
convinced that communication failure
was the root cause. Sharpe believed that
nobody was completely clear on the key
action to prevent reoccurrence, which
in his own view was that during lock
out and tag out “the person or people at
risk must also be in control of the lock
out.”
Visiting a rig in Qatar with no incidents, Sharpe attributed its success to
“committed leadership and an experienced long serving crew with a strong
intervention culture.”

Keeping operations safe requires
discipline and clear consequences; if
you cannot find the responsible person
for safety failures, you have a leadership
problem.
In Q3 2007, 46% of the rigs working globally for Shell had been free
of recordable cases for more than 12
months, i.e., had achieved “Goal Zero.”
Sharpe believes “we need a fundamental change with regard to visibility
of leading HSE indicators—total recordable case frequency is a horrible way to
talk about people being hurt and it does
nothing to stop the next accident. Why
isn’t training plan compliance a key HSE
metric made visible on a rig?”

Program focus
Under the “Goal Zero” program,
Sharpe said Shell will be simplifying
HSE standards, making safety an even
more important factor in contractor selection and ensuring that safety
leadership is key in the staff appraisal
and promotion process. The Goal Zero
message is to elevate safety from a
priority to a core value and to convince
everyone that harm is avoidable and
continued safety demands urgent action. Sharpe explained that Goal Zero
also contained specific plans for high
risk focus areas such as road transport,
contractor HSE management, process
safety, and worksite hazard recognition.

Sharpe believes that Shell can work
with anyone, anywhere, and achieve
Goal Zero. He cited the company’s work
in China on the Changbai project in
Inner Mongolia, where Shell is drilling
6-km multilaterals for tight gas with
three rigs from local contractors. The
operation has been running for 5 years
with only two people hurt and with
nobody hurt for the last year. Sharpe
attributed the success to extensive training; highly experienced supervisors,
and the time spent building a strong
safety culture with the local companies
prior to the start of operations.

Waterﬂood management
Effective waterflood management
requires a multidisciplinary team approach that includes reservoir, drilling,
and production engineers, as well as
chemists, accounting, legal, and others.
Guidelines for waterflood management include information on water
source and quality. During most of the
flood life, an oil reservoir will require
about 0.5-1.0 b/d of injection water
for each 1 acre-ft of reservoir volume.
The ultimate volume of water required
for many floods is about 1.5-2 times

The preliminary design provides
such information as phase or full development, project life, initial oil rate,
production rate forecasts, water injection rate, waterflood layout and well
spacing, injection water source, produced water disposal plan, preliminary
facilities design, capital and expense
cost estimates, economic analysis, risk
and mitigation plans, reservoir and well
monitoring programs, and logistics and
infrastructure considerations.
The design aspects include the determination of injection water source
(quality, compatibility, and recycling
produced water), water injection rate,
optimum timing, optimum pressure
level, fluid saturation at start of waterflooding, residual oil saturation at
end of waterflooding, optimum well
pattern, injection philosophy, injection
well requirement, pilot project, and
surface facilities.
A pilot test will determine if a process is applicable under the field conditions and if the process has a potential
for an economic return from a field
application.
The pilot test helps determine the
recovery efficiency and provides a better
understanding of the process mechanism as well as operational information
on injection and production rates.

the reservoir pore volume.3 4
The water injected should be inexpensive and free from bacteria, suspended solids, and oxygen. It should
also be nonreactive with any clays in the
reservoir and compatible with the reservoir rock and formation water as well as
not being corrosive in the injection and
production facilities.
Injected water can include produced,
surface, or subsurface water.4 5 The
injection rate requirement to support
the desired production rate depends on
inflow performance relationship considerations, well injection pressure and
rate, rules of thumb, local experience,
and availability of compatible water.
Controllable parameters in a waterflood are the injection and production
rates. Economic success depends on the
additional recovery obtained and the
cost of the water, injection wells, and
surface treatment facilities.
Waterfloods require a regular analysis
of the produced water to detect injected
water breakthrough by such means as a
change in chlorides if the injected and
produced water have different salinities.
Other parameters to monitor are
the presence of corrosive dissolved
gases (CO2, H2S, O2); minerals, bacterial growth; dissolved solids; suspended
solids, concentration and compositions; ion analysis; and pH. This data
is gathered at the water source wells,
water injection wells, and points in the
injection system.

Tut ﬁeld
The Tut field has proved to be a successful waterflood. The field is in southeast part of the Khalda concession in
the north part of Egypt’s western desert.
Discovered in 1986, the field currently
has 21 oil producing wells and 3 water
injection wells.
The field produces from the Alam El
Bueib (AEB), Kharita, and Bahariya formations. The AEB-3D interval has two
main sand bodies: upper and lower.
The interval is perforated and produces in most of the wells. Currently,
AEB-3D has seven oil producing wells
and two water injection wells. The zone
produced under depletion drive until
the recompletion of wells Tut-44 and
Tut-19 as water injection wells in November 2006 and May 2007 (Fig. 2).
Volumetric estimates indicated that
the zone had 13.6 million stock-tank
bbl of original oil in place. As of November 2006, cumulative production
from the zone was 2.5 million bbl, or
18% of the oil in place.
The operator expects the waterflooding of AEB-3D to increase the recovery
factor to 35%, resulting in an ultimate
oil recovery of 4.8 million bbl, or an
incremental increased recovery of 2.3
million bbl from existing wells.
Until November 2006, the zone was
producing 500 bo/d from two wells:
Tut-41 and Tut-42. In addition, the
field had several wells shut in because
of low productivity caused by a lack of

An investigation of 28 crude samples
from Russia, FSU countries, the Middle
East, North Africa, and Bulgaria showed
that the crude true boiling point (TBP),
or ASTM D-86 distillation, density, and
sulfur content, along with the Riazi’s
property distribution model and known
correlations, can determine the physical and chemical properties of each 1%
narrow cut of the crude. The samples
have densities (d420) of 0.792-0.938
and sulfur contents of 0.04-3.90%.
Crude costs, which account for
about 80% of refinery expenditures, is the single most important
determinant for the profitability of
an oil company.1 The quality and
value of a crude oil depends on its
TBP curve—which consists of white
oil fractions boiling up to 360° C., the
360-540° C. fraction, and the bottom
of the barrel (540+° C.)—and the level
of impurities like sulfur, nitrogen, metals, etc.
The TBP curve, however, does not
reflect the chemical structure of petroleum fractions that in turn affects the
yield and properties of refinery upgrading and conversion unit products.
Knowledge of the TBP curve and the
chemical nature of fractions of a crude

is therefore of great importance for
improving refinery economics. Unfortunately, obtaining this information
requires laboratory analyses, which are
costly and time consuming.
Riazi developed a two-parameter distribution model for the absolute boiling
point, molecular weight, density, and
refractive index parameter.2 3 Using that
model and appropriate correlations
allows one to determine the chemical
nature of narrow crude oil fractions.
The research laboratory of Lukoil
Neftochim Bourgas, Bulgaria, investigated 28 crudes with the intent to
develop a tool for quick crude fraction
characterization. This article discusses
the results of that study.
We found that the distribution
property parameter, B, in Riazi’s property distribution model was crude and
property specific and not a constant for
a given property, as Riazi reported. The
data of crude oil TBP, or ASTM D-86
distillation, density, and sulfur content
along with the Riazi’s property distribution model can be used for physical and
chemical characterization of each 1%
narrow cut of a crude oil.

cording to ASTM D-1298. The oil sulfur
level was analyzed according to ASTM
D-4294.
Table 1 summarizes the density,
sulfur, and composition of various
cuts: naphtha (initial boiling point, IBP
to 180° C.), kerosine (180-240° C.),
diesel (240-360° C.), vacuum gas oil
(360-540° C.). The 540+° C. fraction
is defined as 100%-naphtha-kerosinevacuum gas oil.

Equation 3 relates I to the refractive
index (n) at 20° C.
P0 is the parameter specific for
each property (T0, M0, S0, I0) and each
sample. A is also a parameter specific for
each property (AT, AM, AS, AI) and each
sample.
B is a parameter specific for each
property (BT, BM, BS, BI); Riazi discov-

ered that B is the same for all investigated samples. He determined that BS = BI
= 3, BM = 1, and BT = 1.5. With values
of BT known for different properties,
Equation 1 becomes a two-parameter
distribution model in which P0 and A
should be determined.3
Equation 1 can be converted into a
linear form (Equation 4).

The estimated parameter BD, however, varied in the range 2.88-5.65, which
is different from Riazi’s stated constant
value for BD = 3.2
There are several correlations that
calculate molecular weight from the
boiling point and density (OGJ, Dec.
28, 1987, p. 110).5-11 In this study, the
Goosens correlation was used to calculate the molecular weight of fractions
in the studied crude samples because it
has shown better accuracy in predicting
molecular weight in the entire crude oil
boiling range.11 The Goosens molecular
weight correlation is in Equation 9.
Equation 1 represents well the molecular weight distribution of fractions
of all studied crude samples—the R2
correlation coefficient was higher than
0.99 except the value for the Buzachi
crude oil (0.9873). The parameters AM
and BM were calculated by Equation 4
assuming that M0 equals 58 (the isobutane molecular weight). It is evident
that the estimated parameter BM varied
in the range 0.98-2.87 instead of BM =
1 as reported by Riazi.2
The refractive index parameter, I,
was estimated using the general relation
for the prediction of that parameter in
Equations 10 and 11.12
As was observed with the other
crude fraction properties, the parameter I also obeys Riazi’s model distribution; R2 correlation coefficient was
0.9714-0.9991. The estimated parameter BI, however, varied in the range
2.94-7.94 instead of BI = 3 as reported
by Riazi.2
The refractive index was calculated
on the basis of the refractive index
parameter I and Equation 2.
Having readily available information
about the distribution of the crude fraction refractive index, molecular weight,
and density, the chemical structure of
crude fractions can be calculated using
published correlations.13-20 In this study,
the prediction of molecular analysis by
Riazi and Daubert was used to estimate
paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic
portions in the investigated crudes.20

The correlations we used are Equations 12-17.20 The hydrogen content
was estimated by the Goosens correlation, shown in Equation 20.21
We found that the sulfur content can
be estimated using Equations 21-24.
The carbon content was calculated
as C = 100 – % hydrogen – % sulfur.
The nitrogen content was neglected,
because it is mainly concentrated in the
bottoms (540+° C.).
We studied the chemical structure
in terms of paraffinic, naphthenic, and
aromatic portions for the different
fractions for all the crude samples. Data
show that for all crude samples, the

aromatics in naphtha and kerosine are
higher than that of diesel and vacuum
gas oil. Naphthenic content is almost
the same and the paraffinic portions in
the diesel and vacuum gas oil are higher
than that of the kerosine and naphtha.
These data suggest that the highermolecular-weight crude fractions
contain more paraffinic portions and
less aromatic ones regardless of the fact
that it is well known that heavier crude
fractions contain more aromatic hydrocarbons. This may be explained by the
suggestion that in heavier fractions, the
aromatic hydrocarbons contain more
paraffinic side chains.

In this data set, the highest paraffinic
portion in all fractions was the Tunisian
crude and the most aromatic was the
Syrian crude. The Tunisian crude oil is
not the lightest, nor is the Syrian the
heaviest, which suggests that crude
density is not a good enough indicator about the chemical composition of
crude fractions.
This work demonstrates that the TBP,
density, and sulfur content of a crude
along with Riazi’s property distribution model can be used for physical
and chemical characterization of each
1% narrow cut of that crude. If the
TBP analyses are not available, one can
estimate it by computing Riazi’s boiling
temperature distribution parameters AT
and BT using the correlations in Equations 25 and 26.
These correlations were developed
via multiple nonlinear regressions of
the data for the investigated 28 crude
samples.
The chemical characterization of
crude fractions can be used as an input
to estimate refinery unit product yields
and, therefore, to examine the economic benefit of processing a given
crude. An earlier work showed that
the vacuum gas oil chemical composition can be applied for evaluation of
fluid catalytic cracking yield distribution.22 ✦

DNV released a new
revision of Submarine
Pipeline Standard—DNV
OS F101, effective Nov.
13, 2007, harmonizing
the existing standard
Pipelines
with ISO, increasing
its focus on integrity
management, and improving the document’s structure.
The revised Submarine
Pipeline Standard complies
with the new ISO 3183
on line pipe material, with
additional and modified
requirements that make it
the only pipeline standard
in compliance with ISO
13623 on pipeline design. The DNV
standard also increased its focus on the
integrity of operational pipelines.

business development, design, construction, operation, and abandonment.
All the standard’s sections now refer directly to one of these phases, and some
of the contents have been moved to fit
the new structure.
DNV introduced a new section,
“Design—materials engineering,” that
includes design-phase requirements
relating to material selection, corrosion,
sour service, hydrogen induced stress
cracking, and other topics.
Modifications made regarding pipeline design were minor. Most changes
constitute fuller interpretations of
already existing guidelines and do not
alter requirements. Pressure definitions,
however, did change and the slightly
modified criteria clarify requirements
regarding the pressure protection system.

ISO harmonization

DNV course

Newly revised ISO 3183, the material standard for C-Mn steel line pipe,
triggered revisions to DNV-OS-F101.
DNV wants to harmonize its standards
with the ISO codes, with DNV-OS-F101
focusing on both ISO 3183 (material)
and ISO 13623 (design). The new revision of ISO 3183, a merger between the
old revision and API 5L, sought to bring
US and global standards into conformity.
DNV chose to provide a self-contained standard instead of providing
additional requirements to ISO. ISO
requirements are repeated, with any
additional or modified requirements
clearly marked, including revision of
the welding and nondestructive testing
requirements. The component section
also now reflects new ISO standards.
DNV intends this document to stipulate
most of the additional requirements
purchasers normally specify regarding
ISO-API.
The update also improves requirements regarding in-service pipelines,
introducing new integrity-management
system requirements and adding a separate section on documentation.
The document now subdivides the
pipeline life cycle into concept and

DNV offers a course covering modifications to pressure and design criteria
and introducing the structure of the
line pipe section, including ISO 3183
requirements.
The course also includes modifications to components and referenced
ISO standards and installation and
operational requirements, and addresses
the latest updates to welding and NDT
requirements. The course targets engineers who have already been using
DNV-OS-F101, 2000.

Software
DNV also offers software for checking code compliance. The code-compliance software is programmed in ExcelVisual Basic and includes the following
checks:
• Burst (pressure containment)
related to system test condition and
operation.
• Collapse.
• Propagation buckling.
• Load-controlled load interaction
(moment, axial force, and overpressure).
• Displacement-controlled load
interaction (axial strain and overpressure).

Report redraws
global warming
caricatures
The global-warming discussion long
ago fell victim to a style of politics in which
one side turns the opposition into a selfdebunking caricature.
Former President Bill Clinton was and
remains a master at this. He manages to
make serious people who disagree with
him look like goons of the “vast right-wing
conspiracy” his wife invented.
So goes global warming politics. Scorn

falls to anyone who doubts that governments must restructure the world economy
to keep the planet from overheating.
That’s a shame. The issue deserves serious attention. Instead, it gets former US
Vice-President Al Gore and his moralistic
hallucinations of doom.
Gore and his cowinner of the Nobel
Peace Prize, Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) Chairman Rajendra
Pachauri, both have likened doubters of
the need for urgent warming responses to
people who believe the world is ﬂat.
There’s sophisticated discourse for you.
A consistent ploy of the Gore-Pachauri
axis and its media lemmings has been to
caricaturize opposition as the work of a tiny
cabal of crackpots supported ﬁnancially by
ExxonMobil. That maneuver hit a snag on
Dec. 20 with publication of a report documenting widespread scientiﬁc opposition to
the alarmists’ view.
The report comes from the ofﬁce of the
ranking member of the US Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works,
James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.). It cites challenges from more than 400 scientists to the
ballyhooed “consensus” view on global
warming. Some of the scientists participate
in the IPCC or have done so.
Many of the quotes are classic. Here’s
just one sample, by Dr. George Kukla, a
research scientist with the Lamont-Doherty
Earth Observatory at Columbia University, from the Apr. 24, 2007 issue of Gelf
Magazine: “The only thing to worry about is
the damage that can be done by worrying.
Why are some scientists worried? Perhaps
because they feel that to stop worrying may
mean to stop being paid.”
The report appears at http://epw.senate.

________________ According to the
Washington Times, a Gore spokeswoman
scanned the document and observed that
25-30 of the scientists might have received
funding from Exxon Mobil.
See how it works?

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

A December run for $100/bbl oil
With many observers convinced they had seen the last major run up in oil prices
for 2007, the market mounted another run at $100/bbl crude in late December.
The January contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes dropped $9.47/bbl
during the last ﬁve trading sessions of November, ﬁnishing the month at $88.71/bbl
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It ﬂuctuated at $87-90/bbl until Dec. 12 when
it jumped $4.37 to $94.39/bbl, the biggest one-day gain since Jan. 30 and then the
highest closing since Nov. 27 on NYMEX, after the US Federal Reserve offered to
$24 billion to the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank to spur economic
growth.
However, that price gain was followed by a losing streak over the next four
NYMEX sessions that reduced the January crude contract to $90.49/bbl by Dec. 18.
Then it escalated to $91.24/bbl Dec. 19 as the Energy Information Administration
reported US crude inventories fell to the lowest level since February 2005, down 7.6
million bbl to 296.9 million bbl in the week ended Dec. 14 vs. a consensus among
Wall Street analysts of a smaller drop of 1.4 million bbl.
On Dec. 20, the NYMEX price slipped to $91.06/bbl. But that was followed by
consecutive increases over the four sessions on Dec. 21, Dec. 24, and Dec. 26-27 to
$93.31/bbl for the new front-month February contract. That contract soared as high
as $97.92/bbl in electronic premarket trading Dec. 28 before proﬁt taking dropped it
to a closing price of $96/bbl.
Still, Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London, said, “The most relevant
question about $100/bbl [price for crude] is when and not if.”
Crude prices climbed in late December in the New York market with the escalation
of geopolitical tensions as the Turkish military said it would continue attacks against
Kurdish rebels across the boarder into northern Iraq. Even more distressful was the
assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and at least 20 other
people by a suicide bomber at a political rally in Pakistan. Pakistan is not a major oil
producer, but it does have nuclear weapons and ties to radical Muslims, which could
be a factor in a Middle East dispute.
Crude stocks tighten
At the same time, EIA reported another major drop in commercial US crude
inventories, down 3.3 million bbl to 293.6 million bbl in the week ended Dec. 21. US
gasoline stocks increased by 700,000 bbl to 205.9 bbl in the same period, while distillate fuel fell 2.8 million bbl to 126.6 million bbl. “US crude oil inventories have fallen
further below their 5-year average, having now fallen in absolute terms by more
than 60 million bbl since the end of June,” Horsnell said. US crude stocks “are still
falling relative to normal seasonal patterns despite the continuation of low reﬁnery
utilization rates,” he said.
“What was, as recently as July, a 40 million bbl build in total US oil inventories
above their 5-year average has now disappeared completely. Crude inventories at
Cushing, Okla., have not managed to achieve the usual scale of end-year seasonal
build, and they are ending 2007 at a level some 33% lower than that at which they
ended 2006,” Horsnell said.
The latest implied gasoline demand is 9.446 million b/d—“the highest ﬁgure since
the seasonal peaks in August and enough to turn what had been a year-over-year
decline for December-to-date into a year-over-year increase,” Horsnell said. “Despite
a 25% rise in retail prices and gathering economic pessimism, US gasoline demand
now looks set to record the 26th straight month of year-over-year increases. Distillate
demand for December-to-date is running close to the all-time high for any month,
with a very strong 7.1% year-over-year increase.”
The latest EIA petroleum data “showed an overall decline to reﬁned product
inventories, which is not typical for this time of year. The inventory drawdown was
driven by the highest weekly demand level since February 2007, which is most
likely a one time event due to holiday travel,” said Soleil-Back Bay Research analyst
Jacques H. Rousseau.
Gasoline supply remains below average, “which could be the result of some reﬁners operating below capacity due to weak margins and because of lower imports
due to a narrow US East Coast vs. Europe arbitrage spread,” said Rousseau. “We
remain cautious on the near-term outlook for the sector and believe that consensus
earnings expectations for the fourth quarter of 2007 are too high, but we expect
reﬁning margins to rebound heading into the 2008 driving season.”

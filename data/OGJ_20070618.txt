says, our Nitech‚Ñ¢ nitrogen removal technology is fast, efÔ¨Åcient and affordable on
natural gas streams of all sizes.

At BCCK Engineering, we have the people, processes and prices to help you capitalize on every nitrogencontaminated reserve that you‚Äôve ever bypassed, regardless of size. And that means new revenues made
easy ‚Äî without expensive, new exploration. So if someone tells you that BCCK can‚Äôt handle your
nitrogen removal job, you know what to tell them.
Nonsense.

COVER
In late 2006, Statoil ASA, on behalf of Kollsnes gas processing
plant operator Gassco, awarded a 790 million kroner contract to
Vetco Aibel for upgrades at the 143-million cu m/day plant
near Bergen. Involved is engineering, installation, construction,
and commissioning of a new gas compressor from the condensate
plant and a new condensate train.The Kollsnes plant currently
processes gas from Troll, Kvitebj√∏rn, and Visund and sends it on
through four pipelines to Europe.This upgrade will be completed by
fourth-quarter 2008. Oil & Gas Journal‚Äôs exclusive, annual Gas
Processing Report, which begins on p. 50, presents more detail on
worldwide activity last year. Cover photo from Statoil; above photo

Nigeria‚Äôs May production lowest since 2003
Violence pulled Nigerian oil production in May to its lowest
level since early 2003, according to the International Energy Agency‚Äôs June Oil Market Report.
IEA estimated average production during the month at 2.01
million b/d, down 245,000 b/d from April.
Production shut-ins in May reached a high of nearly 1 million
b/d and averaged more than 800,000 b/d for the month.
IEA estimates Nigerian production capacity at 2.49 million b/d,
excluding 545,000 b/d considered long-term shut-in.
During May, the agency said, attacks on offshore vessels and
onshore pipelines and pumping stations caused these production
cuts:
‚Ä¢ Abiteye field, 55,000 b/d, now restored.
‚Ä¢ Bomu manifold, attacked twice, 170,000 b/d, now restored.
‚Ä¢ Funiwa field, 15,000 b/d, now restored.
‚Ä¢ Akri and Oshi fields, 80,000 b/d, now being restored.
‚Ä¢ Nembe pipeline leak, 77,000 b/d, still offline.
‚Ä¢ Okono field offshore, 65,000 b/d, still offline.
‚Ä¢ Tebida field, 40,000 b/d, still offline.
IEA called security of oil industry workers ‚Äúprecarious‚Äù and
noted that many non-Nigerian service companies have withdrawn
from the Niger Delta. It also cited Chevron Corp.‚Äôs withdrawal of
nonessential offshore workers for a month because of security
problems (OGJ Online, May 2, 2007). This month, following political developments seen as potentially disruptive, the UK advised
its citizens to leave Bayelsa, Delta, and Rivers states.
IEA said workers‚Äô unions are considering a strike this month to
protest oil price increases and the sale of government stakes in two
refineries.

MMS announces latest RIK contracts
The US Minerals Management Service will receive more than
3.7 million bbl of oil as royalties in-kind under contracts awarded
to four US producers, the Department of the Interior agency said.
Chevron Products Co., Shell Trading Co., ExxonMobil Oil Corp.
and Marathon Petroleum Co. submitted the winning bids. They will

Exploration

&

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

supply some 3,726,000 bbl over 9 months, or 13,800 b/d, beginning July 1, MMS said.
The RIK program came under fire in Congress. Section 201 of
HR 2337 would limit such royalties to purchases for the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve. The bill went through markup by the House
Natural Resources Committee starting June 6 and was approved by
final vote June 13.
MMS said taking royalties in-kind allows it to generate more
revenue by reselling it on the open market. The program also reduces regulatory costs and reporting costs and shortens the compliance cycle, MMS said.
In a June 5 letter to Natural Resources Committee Chairman
Nick J. Rahall (D-W.Va.), Deputy US Sec. of the Interior P. Lynn
Scarlet said the RIK program has generated $28.8 million in additional federal revenue. It also reduced administrative costs by 30%
from royalty in-value activities, saving another $2.3 million, she
said.
The bill‚Äôs provision also would eliminate partnerships MMS has
with several states regarding royalties in-kind and end a program
under which RIK crude is used to help supply small refiners, Scarlet
said.

Quebec authorizes carbon emissions tax
Quebec has authorized Canada‚Äôs first carbon emissions tax, effective Oct. 1. An estimated $200 million (Can.) of annual tax revenues will be used to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and improve
public transit, officials said.
The Quebec cabinet approved the tax, which was proposed
more than a year ago. Quebec‚Äôs Natural Resources Minister Claude
Bechard suggested oil companies would absorb the tax rather than
pass it on to consumers, but analysts expect retail prices to rise.
The amount of the tax varies according to the amount of carbon dioxide each fuel produces. The tax is to 0.8¬¢ (Can.)/l. for
gasoline, 0.9¬¢ /l. for diesel, 0.96¬¢ /l. for light heating oil, and
$8/tonne for coal.
Three companies, Petro-Canada Products Ltd., Shell Canada Ltd.,
and Valero Energy Corp., operate refineries in Quebec. ‚ú¶

BP, Noble make deepwater gulf Ô¨Ånd with Isabela
BP PLC and Noble Energy Inc. hit hydrocarbon pay with their
Isabela prospect about 150 miles southeast of New Orleans in the
Gulf of Mexico. Isabela lies on Mississippi Canyon Block 562 in
6,500 ft of water and was drilled to 19,100 ft TD. The discovery
found ‚Äúhydrocarbons in two high-quality reservoirs,‚Äù Noble said.
The well, which was spud on Feb. 28, has been temporarily

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

suspended pending development plans. The most likely development scenario, says Noble, is a subsea tieback to nearby Na Kika
production facility, operated by BP.
Chuck Davidson, Noble Energy chairman, president, and chief
executive, said Isabela could add production by late 2009. Noble
also has acquired an interest in adjacent acreage with additional
exploration potential.
BP operates Isabela with a 66.67% interest. Noble holds 33.33%.

Marathon drills Droshky appraisal well in gulf
Marathon Oil Corp. has completed a successful appraisal of its
Droshky discovery on Green Canyon Block 244 in the Gulf of Mexico 137 miles off Louisiana.
The appraisal program consisted of drilling a downdip sidetrack
well in about 2,900 ft of water and a lateral sidetrack well.
The downdip sidetrack encountered more than 600 ft of net oil
pay, and the lateral sidetrack encountered 300 ft of net oil pay.
The discovery well, which was drilled to 21,190 ft TD, had encountered 250 ft of net oil pay (OGJ, Apr. 16, 2007, Newsletter).
Based on the results of the three well penetrations, Marathon
estimates the Droshky discovery holds mean reserves of 80-90 million gross boe.
Preliminary analysis suggests that Droshky holds 30-32¬∞ gravity
oil, which is similar to that of Troika field. All pay intervals are in
the Upper Miocene formation, Marathon said.
The company expects to produce this field via subsea completions through the Troika field production system, 2 miles away and
the Bullwinkle platform.
Marathon said production could start as early as 2010 if regulatory approvals and key equipment deliveries are timely.

It refrained from testing the shallower zones to preserve mechanical integrity of the well for production.
Gulfsands, operator with a 50% interest in the block, will drill
the Khurbet East-2 appraisal well immediately to test Cretaceous
and Tertiary targets.
It plans to shoot a 3D seismic survey over the Khurbet East
structure, a large fault-bound structural culmination with closure
mapped at multiple intervals. Areal extent is 15 sq km at the level
of the Kurrachine dolomite formation.
The discovery well is 12 km southwest of Souedieh oil field and
12 km south of Roumelan oil field. Development can use existing
infrastructure.

Iraq Taq Taq wells Ô¨Çow oil at high rates
The TT-06 appraisal well in Taq Taq field in the Kurdistan sector
of northeastern Iraq has flowed oil at an aggregate rate of 18,900
b/d of 48¬∞ gravity at a low gas-oil ratio from three unstimulated
Cretaceous-age formations.
It is the third appraisal well drilled in the field since 2006 by
Taq Taq Operating Co., a joint venture of Genel Enerji AS and Addax
Petroleum Corp., Calgary. TT-04 tested at nearly 30,000 b/d, and
TT-05 tested at more than 25,000 b/d.
A 105-m perforated Shiranish interval flowed 15,380 b/d, 51
m of Kometan flowed 2,020 b/d, and 10 m of Qamchuga flowed
1,500 b/d on 128‚ÅÑ64, 40‚ÅÑ64, and 32‚ÅÑ64-in. chokes, respectively. TT-06 is
the third of a six-well appraisal program.
Addax said it anticipates that ‚Äúconstructive efforts of the Kurdistan Region and Iraq towards finalizing a legal framework will
enable the corporation to generate a full development plan for the
Taq Taq field.‚Äù
Taq Taq field, 60 km northeast of Kirkuk, was discovered in
1978. Two more wells were drilled in the 1990s.

First Calgary Petroleums Ltd. has let a front-end engineering
and design contract to Genesis Oil & Gas Consultants Ltd. for its
Menzel Ledjmet East (MLE) project on Block 405B in Algeria.

FCP is working with Sonatrach to develop the block by 2009
under a $1.3 billion development plan. The partners will produce
200 MMcfd of gas from MLE oil and gas field in Algeria‚Äôs Berkine

The unnamed Omani official told the Kuwait News Agency
that Omani oil pipelines were not affected by the storm but that it
caused extensive damage to the country‚Äôs infrastructure, including
electricity, communication, and transportation sectors.
Meanwhile, shipments of LNG from the Oman LNG terminal at
Sur resumed June 10 after exports were halted earlier in the week
as a precautionary measure. Oman LNG exports most of its LNG to
Japan, South Korea, and India.
The Sur facility was operating at full capacity on June 10 with
the first ship under way since the beginning of the storm, according to an official of Oman LNG.
The resumption of activity at Oman‚Äôs oil and gas export facilities
followed the general reopening of the country‚Äôs main port of Sohar
on June 7, after being closed June 6 as the cyclone approached.
The port reopened the morning of June 7 having no major
damage, according to Jan Meijer, chief executive of Sohar Industrial
Port Co., which operates the facility.

Mubarek inÔ¨Åll well spudded off Sharjah
Sky Petroleum Inc., Austin, Tex., said drilling has started on the
K2-ST3 sidetrack in Mubarek oil field operated by Crescent Petroleum Co. International Ltd. off Sharjah.
PT Apexindo‚Äôs Rani Woro cantilever jack up is drilling the well at
the Mubarek K wellhead platform to a target depth of 13,500 ft in
the Late Cretaceous Ilam/Mishrif oil reservoir. The well sidetracks
the Mubarek K-2 well, drilled to test the Early Cretaceous Thamama
reservoir, which produces gas and condensate in the field.
Results are expected in third quarter after testing, Sky said.
The well is the second well in a Mubarek infill-drilling program
covered by an agreement Sky signed in 2005 with Buttes Gas &

Processing
Sinopec to raise product exports through JV
China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) plans to increase
its product exports by joining with two Singapore-based companies, ItalSing Petroleum Co. Pte. Ltd. and AP Oil International Ltd.,
to produce its brand-name lubricants for Asian Pacific markets.
Sinopec‚Äôs automotive lubricants will be made in Singapore by
Italsing, a joint venture of Singapore Petroleum Co. and Eni International BV, while AP Oil will make the Chinese firm‚Äôs marine
lubricants.
Sinopec said it is considering a direct manufacturing presence in
the city-state, but will first focus on developing the market through
contract manufacturing.
No details were reported on the value of the contract manufacturing deals with the two Singapore companies, but Sinopec said
it would initially produce 5,000-7,000 tonnes/year of lubricants
through them.
In a separate statement, AP Oil said it has a 5-year contract with
Sinopec to blend mainly marine lubricants. It said the volume
would vary according to Sinopec‚Äôs requirements.

Oil Inc., a subsidiary of Crescent Petroleum, Sharjah. Sky‚Äôs commitment is two wells with costs capped at $25 million. It has the
option to drill four more wells capped at $12.5 million each.
The first well, H2, had produced 83,692 bbl of oil by Mar. 31,
since coming on stream May 16, 2006.
Mubarek, producing since 1974, is undergoing redevelopment
after the companies identified attractive prospects from a 3D seismic survey. The field has produced more than 100 million bbl of
oil. It has nine wellhead platforms, a production platform with
capacities of 60,000 b/d of oil and 150 MMscfd of gas, infield
pipelines, and a 600,000 bbl floating storage unit.
Sky‚Äôs agreement includes a right of first refusal for exploration
of the Sir Abu Nu‚Äôayr prospect off Abu Dhabi. That project is under
evaluation.

China‚Äôs Jidong Ô¨Åeld to serve domestic market
Anticipated production from Nanpu block in China‚Äôs Jidong
field will likely go to the country‚Äôs domestic market, according to
a Western oil company executive.
Early indications suggest the Nanpu oil is 32¬∫ gravity with a
sulfur content of 0.1%, according to Paul Wright, project manager
for Chevron Corp.‚Äôs commercial integration team.
That makes the oil a heavier sweet grade and best suited for
processing by China‚Äôs domestic refiners, Wright told an industry
conference in Singapore. While not involved in the development
of the block, Chevron has been drilling in Bohai Bay, where the
Nanpu block is located.
PetroChina earlier said its discovery at the Nanpu block, reported to be China‚Äôs largest in 30 years, holds proven reserves of 405
million tonnes of oil and 140 billion cu m of gas. ‚ú¶

Lyondell‚Äôs 4.44 billion yuan venture with Sinopec Zhenhai Refinery & Chemical for a propylene oxide-styrene monomer (POSM)
manufacturing facility to be built in Ningbo, China.
Jacobs is committed to prepare the technical details of Lyondell‚Äôs project design package for what is to be the largest POSM
facility in the world.
The facility is expected to produce 274,000 tonnes/year of propylene oxide and 620,000 tonnes/year of styrene monomer. It is
slated for operation in 2009.
Lyondell earlier said it is to get a share of the propylene oxide
(PO) profitability from the plant in exchange for its POSM technology and overall operating and technical experience, and the two
partners will jointly market all PO manufactured by the new facility
(OGJ, May 7, 2007, Newsletter).

Elsewhere, Vaziri-Hamaneh said Iran is finalizing five Asian
joint-venture refinery projects in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Syria for a total capacity of 1.1 million b/d.
‚ÄúWe are supposed to be the partner in these refineries and also
to provide the crude oil for those refineries,‚Äù he told reporters on
the sidelines of the conference in Malaysia.
Vaziri-Hamaneh did not offer details on the projects, but a National Iranian Oil Co. official said Iran aimed to supply crude to a

planned refinery in northern Malaysia.
In April Malaysian officials said discussions were under way
over a proposed refinery complex and pipeline across northern
Malaysia.
Apart from a 320-km pipeline, they said, plans call for a
200,000 b/d coastal refinery to be built by a joint venture of local
firm SKS Development Sdn. Bhd. and NIOC (OGJ Online, Apr. 17,
2007). ‚ú¶

Final North Baja gas line EIS completed
Staffs from the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and
the California State Lands Commission (CSLC) jointly concluded that
the proposed North Baja natural gas pipeline expansion project will
be environmentally acceptable, the agencies said on June 8.
The project, which has been proposed by a US subsidiary of
TransCanada Corp., would be the US portion of a system to deliver
natural gas from terminals in Mexico to California and other southwestern US markets. It would be built adjacent to a line which was
completed in 2002. A Sempra Energy subsidiary would own the
Baja California segment.
The US segment, reviewed by FERC and CSLC, would be comprised of an 80-mile loop of 42-in. and 48-in. line; a 2.1-mile,
36-in. lateral to Southern California Gas Co.‚Äôs existing Blythe compressor station; a 46-mile, 16-in. lateral to the existing Imperial Irrigation District El Centro generating station, and other associated
facilities.
The agencies issued a final environmental statement and review
that were prepared in collaboration with the US Bureaus of Land
Management and Reclamation. BLM will use the documents to
consider amending the California Desert Conservation Area Plan
and the Yuma District Resource Plan, the agencies indicated.
The project‚Äôs sponsor said it plans to minimize its impact on the
Imperial Dunes Recreation Area by building the pipeline through
the dunes within the All American Canal/Interstate 8 corridor.
FERC and CSLC noted that directional drilling would be used
to avoid disturbing the Colorado River, All American and East
Highline canals beds and banks, and associated wetland and riparian areas. The project‚Äôs sponsor has agreed to consult with the
appropriate Indian tribes and regulatory agencies before beginning construction, they said.

Illinois-Gulf Coast crude line under study
Enbridge Inc. and ExxonMobil Pipeline Co. are studying a
crude oil pipeline that would connect refining centers on the US
Gulf Coast with production in the oil sands region of Alberta.
The pipeline under study would carry crude from a hub at
Patoka, Ill., to Beaumont, Tex., and on to Houston. Straight-line
distances total about 715 miles.
At Patoka, the pipeline would link with Enbridge systems that
carry crude from Edmonton and Fort McMurray, Alta., to the Chi-

cago area and eastern Canada.
Enbridge said it and ExxonMobil Pipeline have held discussions with potential shippers about the scope, timing, and value
of the proposal. It said the project is targeted to be in service as
soon as the end of 2010.
Enbridge is expanding its capacity to carry crude from Alberta.
Its Southern Access mainline expansion, under construction,
ultimately will add 400,000 b/d of capacity between Hardisty,
Alta., and Flanagan, Ill., near Chicago.
Its planned Alberta Clipper project involves construction of a
36-in. diameter pipeline from Hardisty to Superior, Wis., and the
addition of pumping capacity on a new 42-in. pipeline between
Superior and Flanagan. It has increased the expected capacity of
the project to 450,000 b/d from 400,000 b/d.
In its Southern Access extension, Enbridge would lay a 36in. pipeline with 400,000 b/d of capacity between Flanagan and
Patoka.

Cyprus seeks bids for LNG supplies, gas storage
Cyprus will launch a tendering process for LNG supplies and
gas storage infrastructure, according to local reports.
The government will accept tenders for a temporary offshore
storage facility as a stop gap and it also is seeking companies interested in constructing a permanent onshore site.
The LNG supplies and gas storage will help Cyprus to reduce carbon emissions within the European Union. Government
spokesman Vasilis Palmas was quoted as saying that the Cypriot
cabinet had approved both a LNG regasification terminal and gas
storage, but did not give a timeframe.
Rows have broken out among political circles in Cyprus, however, on whether it should opt for land-based gas storage or a
floating offshore unit. Government officials estimate that an onshore facility could take 5-7 years to complete.
Critics have argued against a floating storage unit, claiming
it is a risk as the technology is untested and could be a waste of
taxpayers‚Äô money. A floating unit is estimated to take as long as 5
years to implement.
Cyprus is committed to using cleaner forms of energy within
the EU by 2009. The island relies mainly upon heavy fuel oil for
its electric power generation. ‚ú¶

and less costly to build and operate.
It starts with biological conversion of H2S to hydrophilic sulfur, which
settles naturally without chemical wetting agents and virtually eliminates
plugging. This allows simpler, less costly process equipment and
requires fewer, less expensive chemical additives.
Which means your Shell-Paques system is easier to operate and
more reliable: 99+% availability in most cases. The naturally occurring
thiobacillus bacteria are self-sustaining and self-regulating.

And then there‚Äôs the biologically produced sulfur cake that is reclaimed
from the process. As a fertilizer, it breaks down quickly in soil, becoming
available to plants ten times faster than chemical sulfur.
Add it all together, and NATCO provides an unbeatable array of process
advantages for removal of H2S from gas. Let our industry leading gas
conditioning system design experts show you how easy it is to put this
technology to work for you.

gasoline will lead regional demand patterns. And LPG and naphtha can come
from natural gas processing as well as
crude oil processing. Hence, the growth
shown in OGJ‚Äôs numbers for 2006.
LPG exports in 2006-12, said Yamaguchi, will hold steady near 900,000
b/d; naphtha exports will grow to more
than 1 million b/d by the end of the
period.
While much has been made by other
observers of the growth of naphtha exports, she believes the real export leader
will be middle distillates. In 2007, such
exports will be about 800,000 b/d but
will grow to 1.4 million b/d by 2010
and to more than 2.1 million b/d by
2012.
Pushing this growth in large measure will be Qatar‚Äôs GTL projects. Its
Oryx project (Qatar Petroleum Co. 51%
and Sasol Ltd. 49%) produced its first
volumes in January (OGJ Online, Jan.
31, 2007). The Pearl project is due on
line in 2010-11; the ExxonMobil plant
is due in 2011.

Mideast ascendancy
Accustomed to being a market setter in crude oil trade, countries of the
Middle East are clearly expanding their
presence and importance in other hydrocarbon movements. That fact may or
may not comfort those concerned about
supply balances in world markets. But
the trend is inexorable.
As OGJ‚Äôs numbers continue to show
and FACTS‚Äôs analysis supports, the
world‚Äôs processing center has tilted toward the Middle East. The region, both
as producer and as market, increasingly
is acting as a fulcrum for trade patterns
to the West as well as the East.‚ú¶

The wrong energy Ô¨Åx
Minor tweaks won‚Äôt fix the Energy Policy Act
of 2005 (EPACT). But no one believes HR 2337 is
really about fixing flawed energy law.
The bill, approved last week by the House
Natural Resources Committee, would repeal a
few of EPACT‚Äôs minor triumphs. The oil and gas
measures deal with processing fees for drilling
permits, categorical exclusions from environmental statutes, royalty-in-kind payments to the federal
government, federal offshore audits, split-estate
issues on federal leases, various fees, regulation of
produced water, and leasing of oil shale and tar
sands acreage. They all would bruise oil and gas
companies.
That the law would contradict US interests in
the development of domestic energy supply is inexcusable. Worse, HR 2337 and the politics behind
it perpetuate a baffling American refusal to face
facts on energy. But the big battles over the biggest
US energy issues already were lost.

Chipping away
The US had energy problems even before
Congress lurched into action on the subject. The
country leads the world in consumption, which
grows steadily. It imports oil and gas at increasing rates while refusing to allow exploration of
promising federal acreage. Its refining capacity
doesn‚Äôt expand in step with oil demand, operates
at stressful rates, and grapples with increasingly
complex product specifications. And while air
quality has improved greatly, public concern about
greenhouse gases is intense.
EPACT, developed as ‚Äúcomprehensive energy
legislation,‚Äù at best chipped away at those problems. It mostly doled out favors to producers of
a variety of energy forms, most of them uneconomic without subsidies and unlikely ever to add
greatly to supply. Overall, it reinstituted fuel choice
by the state and shoved agriculture to the center
of energy policy. It took no major step toward expanding oil and gas leasing of federal land, choosing only the half-step of opening a small part of
the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. And it undermined
its own efforts to encourage refinery construction
by injecting, with its enthusiasm for ethanol and
other such folly, deadly new uncertainty into decisions about refining investments.

The best and wholly improbable fix for EPACT
is repeal. Sure, that would overturn minor gains
the oil and gas scored in the monstrous bill. But
those advances are in jeopardy in a hostile Congress. Against real US energy needs, a bill that
mandates ethanol in gasoline and doesn‚Äôt meaningfully broaden oil and gas leasing of federal land
cannot be called comprehensive or constructive.
EPACT repeal won‚Äôt happen, of course. Congress
would never confess to a mistake so colossal. With
HR 2337, the House has simply set about to fix
what Democrats newly in control depict as the
EPACT mistakes of their Republican predecessors,
meaning measures that in any way benefit oil and
gas companies.
Energy politics in the US has degenerated into
this kind of mindless grope for revenge against
popular demons: oil companies and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. So fixing
EPACT comes to mean not rationalizing the venal
ethanol mandate or expanding oil and gas leasing
but punishing the oil industry. Such demagoguery
plays well to the angry and unthinking crowd. But
it limits oil and gas supply and in other ways costs
people money.

Uninformed spite
The Senate seems determined to make comparable mistakes for like reasons. It began discussion
last week of a legislative package unveiled in May
that would, among other things, make ‚Äúpricegouging‚Äù a crime. The debate included a glittering illustration of the uninformed spite propelling these bills. A proposal to encourage refinery
construction, said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.),
would be ‚Äúa total taxpayer give-away to the oil industry.‚Äù She then complained that, in the less than
2 years since EPACT accelerated capital recovery for
projects that add refining capacity, no new refinery
has opened in the US.
Americans need a large supply of cheap energy.
They won‚Äôt get that from the biofuels, wind, or
solar industries. They won‚Äôt get it from an oil and
gas industry hamstrung by vindictive policy. And
they won‚Äôt get it from politicians who exploit
popular misunderstanding to the detriment of
national interests. ‚ú¶

As a result of strong margins and
high throughput rates, Valero Energy
Corp. posted a 35% increase in earnings for the first quarter as compared
to results a year earlier. The refiner‚Äôs
revenues, however, were down 6%.
Valero said it benefited from the
January commissioning of the expanded crude unit at its Port Arthur,
Tex., refinery, which increased overall
throughput capacity by 30,000 b/d to
325,000 b/d of sour crude oil.

House Republican leaders beyond
the committee leveled a broadside
against the bill on June 12. The new
House Energy Action Team (HEAT),
working through the office of Minority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), said that
HR 2337‚Äôs provisions would discourage
development of domestic resources and
increase reliance on imports.

Senate activity
In the Senate, debate continued on
the legislative package which Democratic leaders announced on May 23.
The bill aims to make oil product price
manipulation a federal crime, mandate
more efficient government offices and
motor fleets, increase biofuel supplies,
and bring other alternative fuels to market more quickly.
Discussion quickly centered on an
amendment proposed by Sen. James
Inhofe (R-Okla.) to provide additional
incentives to build new US refineries,
which he said the Democrats have failed
to address. ‚ÄúAmericans are starving for
affordable energy, and the majority‚Äôs bill
tells them to go on a diet,‚Äù he said on
June 12.
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.),
who succeeded Inhofe as chair of the
Environment and Public Works Committee following the 2006 election,
immediately called his proposal ‚Äúa total
taxpayer giveaway to the oil industry.‚Äù
She said, ‚ÄúIt would short-cut many
environmental laws which protect our
families.‚Äù Not one oil company has
opened a new US refinery since EPACT
and its incentives became law, she said.
Other Republicans expressed support for Inhofe‚Äôs amendment as debate
continued on June 13. Mel Martinez
of Florida said that the overall bill does

Hot gasoline
fuels hearing

W

hen US Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich (D-Ohio), who chairs
the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee‚Äôs Domestic
Policy Subcommittee, announced that
he would hold a hearing on gasoline prices, I was skeptical. The event
would follow gasoline price hearings
by two other House committees. I
thought Kucinich and the subcommittee‚Äôs staff couldn‚Äôt add anything new.
I was wrong. They could, and they
did.
The June 8 hearing‚Äôs title‚ÄîHot
Fuel: Big Oil‚Äôs Double Standard for
Measuring Gasoline‚Äîcame from a
staff report which predicted that US
consumers will pay a premium of approximately $1.5 billion on gasoline
this summer.
Warmer temperatures make
gasoline expand by volume but not
by weight. Since the 1920s, the oil
industry has considered this and used
a 60¬∫ F. standard to measure wholesale gasoline transactions.
‚ÄúBut the oil industry does not
adjust for temperature in retail sales to
customers. As a result, consumers pay
a premium when temperatures exceed
60¬∫, as they do during the summer,‚Äù
the report said. Assuming that thermal expansion will amount to 513.8
million gal this summer, the report
arrived at the $1.5 billion estimate.

Used in Canada
‚ÄúExisting technology can adjust
for thermal expansion at the retail
level with a technology known as
automatic temperature compensation, or ATC. It‚Äôs already being used
in Canada, but not in the United
States, where summer temperatures
are higher,‚Äù Kucinich said.
26

He said the National Conference on
Weights and Measures will consider, at
its annual meeting in July, a resolution to encourage gasoline retailers to
install ATC devices. The conference‚Äôs
chairman, Mike Cleary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, testified that a model law for
states to consider will be discussed.
Cleary said he has not taken a position on the issue but has established
a steering committee to study technical questions raised by gasoline‚Äôs
thermal expansion at the retail level
‚Äúas I believe this work will need to be
done regardless of the vote in July.‚Äù

Industry responses
Oil industry groups questioned
whether this is necessary. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs
already a vast organizational structure
nationally and in each state to assure
every consumer gets a fair measurement
of any product,‚Äù said Prentiss Searles, a
downstream marketing associate at the
American Petroleum Institute, during a
June 11 teleconference.
At the hearing, R. Timothy Columbus, general counsel for the National Association of Convenience Stores and the
Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America, said retrofits would cost
each retailer an average $8,000.
‚ÄúThis dispute has virtually nothing
to do with the integrated oil companies. These companies own, much
less than operate, less than 10% of
the retail outlets in this country. This
is all about independent retailers,‚Äù
Columbus said.
US Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Calif.),
the subcommittee‚Äôs chief minority
member, was much more critical. He
called the proceedings ‚Äúpolitical theater‚Äù and a ‚Äúfarce of a hearing.‚Äù ‚ú¶

nothing to remove barriers to building
new oil refineries in the US. ‚ÄúWe have
not built a new one in this country for
over 30 years because of burdensome
regulations,‚Äù he said, adding that the
bill‚Äôs attempt to make gasoline price
manipulation a federal crime also is
misguided.
‚ÄúThe price at the pump is affected
by both a lack of refining capacity and
a surplus of regulations on the fuels
that are produced,‚Äù said Mike Enzi of
Wyoming. ‚ÄúUnless we get rid of this refinery constriction, we‚Äôre going to face
gasoline shortages twice a year, starting
immediately.‚Äù
But Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who
has led efforts on the Senate side to
make oil market manipulation a federal
crime, agreed with Boxer that Inhofe‚Äôs
amendment would throw out important
environmental requirements. Besides,
said Cantwell, progress on increasing
motor fuel production capacity is being
made because in the last 4 years, 40
new alternative plants have been built
or are awaiting permits.
The Senate defeated Inhofe‚Äôs amendment by 52 to 43 votes at midday June
13. It then turned its attention to a proposal by Energy and Natural Resources
Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman
(R-NM) to require electric utilities to
get at least 15% of the power they sell
from renewable sources by 2020.
Among other benefits, said Bingaman, this would reduce pressure on
natural gas to generate electricity and
reduce gas prices in the process. ‚ú¶

API lists concerns about House, Senate energy bills
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
American Petroleum Institute ofÔ¨Åcials expressed concern that provisions
before the 110th US Congress could
effectively reduce available oil and gas
supplies and harm US consumers.
‚ÄúIn a nutshell, I‚Äôm worried that much
of the possible legislation simply could
repeat the mistakes of the 1970s and
‚Äò80s,‚Äù chief economist Jon C. Felmy
told reporters in a June 11 teleconference that included other ofÔ¨Åcials from
API‚Äôs upstream, downstream, and tax
departments.
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, Felmy said calls to
increase taxes on oil companies in a
manner similar to the Windfall ProÔ¨Åt
Tax of the early 1980s would lower
domestic production and move investments overseas. Felmy also criticized
bills aimed at combating alleged
price-gouging, which he characterized
as vaguely written, indirect reintroductions of price controls. He also
questioned efforts to dramatically
increase alternative fuel development
mandates.
His remarks came at the beginning
of a week in which the full Senate is
scheduled to consider a major energy

legislation package and the House
Natural Resources Committee concludes its markup of a bill that would
effectively repeal parts of the 2005
Energy Policy Act (EPACT) and impose
restrictions on produced water management, royalty in-kind payments,
and other activities.
‚ÄúMost of the proposals we see have
the unintended consequence of reducing supplies and hurting consumers,‚Äù
Felmy said.
Mark Kibbe, API senior tax policy
analyst, urged caution in reconsidering incentives in EPACT that were
designed to increase domestic production and reÔ¨Åning capacity. Efforts to repeal Section 199 of that law could raise
$7-12 billion in revenues for the US
Treasury Department but would have
the equivalent effect of a 3% increase
in the corporate tax rate for oil producers, he said.
As for calls in the House to accept a proposal from the administration of President George W. Bush for
onshore producers to pay $1,700 for
each drilling permit application that
the US Bureau of Land Management
processes, Doug Morris, API upstream
group director, said, ‚ÄúAny additional
fees imposed on drilling would have a

negative effect on production.‚Äù
Felmy added, ‚ÄúThe costs of investing in the United States have increased
dramatically to around $40/bbl to produce oil from an offshore well.‚Äù
API ofÔ¨Åcials also warned that mandating goals for speciÔ¨Åc fuel alternatives could cost consumers money.
‚ÄúWe support a realistic alternative
fuels standard with periodic economic
and technology reviews, and possible
preemption of often confusing and
contradictory state mandates,‚Äù said
Bob Greco, API downstream group
director.
In response to a question about adding clean coal and oil shale to technology development incentives, Felmy
said, ‚ÄúWe feel there‚Äôs a role for all
technologies going forward. Coal-toliquids technology has been around for
decades, but it deserves consideration
equal to cellulosic ethanol. The devil is
in the details on how much to spend
on each of these technologies.‚Äù
But the ofÔ¨Åcials‚Äô main concern apparently was preserving incentives
contained in EPACT. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not step
backward from good energy policies of
2 years ago,‚Äù Felmy said.

Rahall‚Äôs amendment also proposed
changing the original bill‚Äôs produced
water provision requiring replacement
of water resources from federal lands
by specifying ‚Äúreplacement or remediation‚Äù instead. This would give operators
more flexibility in addressing water
concerns, Rahall said. The amendment
also would require lessees to submit
a water management plan with their
drilling permit applications instead of
when the US Bureau of Land Management issues a lease, as specified in the
original bill.
The amendment‚Äôs biggest single
change was an apparently complete

ident and chief economist.
Thorning cited the results of an
ACCF-commissioned study entitled ‚ÄúPotential Effects of Proposed Price-gouging Legislation on the Cost and Severity
of Supply Interruptions.‚Äù Consultant
CRA International Inc. of Washington,
DC, prepared that study.
Thorning said price controls on
refined products discourage refining expansion and discourage energy investment. Several pieces of legislation are
being discussed on the subject of pricegouging. A US House bill proposed by
Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) would make
‚Äúprice-gouging‚Äù a criminal offense.
Stupak‚Äôs bill outlines that during an
emergency declared by the US president, it would be illegal for anyone to
sell oil products at a price that was
‚Äúunconscionably excessive‚Äù and that
indicated the seller was ‚Äútaking unfair
advantage of the circumstances related
to an energy emergency to increase
prices unreasonably‚Äù (OGJ, June 4,
2007, p. 28.)
In the US Senate, Sen. Maria Cantwell
(D-Wash.) added a price-gouging
amendment to legislation that would
raise Corporate Average Fuel Economy
(OGJ, May 14, 2007, p. 27.)

‚ÄúImposing criminal charges for price
increases would discourage suppliers from seeking replacement supplies
(which might cost more), therefore
limiting consumers‚Äô access to gasoline
supply,‚Äù Thorning said.
The expectation of price controls
tends to discourage US refinery investment, resulting in tight capacity at all

times, she added.
‚ÄúThis type of legislation will have
exactly the opposite effect that was
intended,‚Äù Thorning said. ‚ÄúThis type
of legislation will tend to make supply
shrink.‚Äù
She cited gasoline price controls of
the 1970-80s, noting that those controls did not work. Instead, she believes

Hurricane scenarios
Thorning said price controls are
likely to exacerbate potential gasoline
shortages during hurricanes. The CRA
study reported how estimated total welfare loss from imposing price controls
would have totaled $1.9 billion for
September-October 2005.
‚ÄúAdditionally, under price controls,
losses would have been much more localized in the regions that lost supplies,
like Louisiana and Mississippi because
there would have been no incentive to
increase imports (of either crude oil or
refined products),‚Äù the report said.
Thorning said price controls can
worsen shortages by reducing supplies
available to consumers. In addition,
the overall post-crisis economic losses
increase when consumers find themselves waiting in long lines for gasoline
instead of working, she said.

Sea terrorists

E

ven as increased demand strains

terrorism continues to pose a major
threat of disruption to international
deliveries.
Consider again the threat to the
Straits of Malacca, which‚Äîaccording
to Malaysia‚Äôs police chief‚Äîremains
vulnerable to a terrorist strike that
would send political and economic
shock waves worldwide.
At an ocean security conference
last week, Inspector General of Police
Musa Hassan told law and shipping
officials from more than 30 countries
that militants could storm a ship, hijack one carrying hazardous material,
or use a vessel as a weapon to hit port
and land facilities.
Maritime terrorism is a ‚Äúthreat

While pirate attacks may be down,

That‚Äôs the view of the US Navy
admiral, nominated by President
George W. Bush to serve as chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has
called for the creation of global naval
partnerships to deal with emerging
threats around the world.

BP: World oil
demand growth rate
weakened in 2006
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Global demand for oil in 2006 saw
its weakest growth rate since 2001, at
0.7% or half the average for the past
decade, according to BP PLC‚Äôs Statistical
Review of World Energy 2007, released
by the company June 12.
The main factor behind the slowdown, the report said, was that oil
consumption of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
member countries fell by 400,000 b/d
in 2006‚Äîthe first decline in more than
20 years, due largely to high oil prices.
Global oil production increased by
0.4% to 81.7 million b/d, but weak oil
demand meant that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries reduced
production late in 2006 for the first
time in nearly 2 years. ‚ÄúFor the year as
a whole, OPEC increased its production
by an average 130,000 b/d to 34.2 million b/d,‚Äù BP said.
Russia, Azerbaijan, and Canada
produced the most oil outside of OPEC
members. Russia alone increased oil
production by an additional 200,000
b/d. Outside of OPEC, output was up
some 300,000 b/d in 2006, though
this rise was less than half the 10-year
average. Oil production fell in the UK
for the seventh year consecutively and
in the US for the sixth year in a row.
However, global natural gas consumption increased by 2.5% in 2006,

driven by demand growth in Russia
and China. BP‚Äôs review showed that
gas demand fell in the US and Europe.
Europe experienced high prices and
warmer-than-normal weather. ‚ÄúRussian gas demand, almost as large as the
total consumed by the whole Asia-Pa-

cific region, increased by some 7% in
2006, accounting for 40% of the global
increase,‚Äù BP said.
China consumed 55.6 billion cu m
of gas in 2006, which was a 20% rise
on 2005. Russia was an important gas
producer in 2006 and contributed to

the 3% rise in global gas production.
The US also staged a recovery following
the severe hurricane damage in 2005.
For the second year in a row, world
energy growth slowed, rising by 2.4%,
down from 3.2% in 2005. BP attributed
the trend to high energy prices. ‚ú¶

BLM indicated it probably will be
at least 6 months before any leases are
offered.
The decision issued by the Glenwood Springs, Colo., BLM field office
covers 70% of the 73,602 acres of the
Roan. A final decision on the remaining 30%, which includes scenic and
environmentally sensitive areas, is
expected later this year following conclusion of a public comment period.
A 1997 law transferred much of the
Roan Plateau from the former Naval
Oil Shale Reserve to the US Department of Energy. The transfer act directed BLM to lease the area for petroleum
resource development and to complete
a resource management plan.
The act did not make a distinction between lands on top or below
the plateau, BLM said on its web site.
Much debate about oil and gas development there has focused on protect-

ing the top, but some critical wildlife
habitat is found below the rim.
Currently, there is no drilling on
BLM-administered lands on top of
Roan Plateau. As of August 2006, 31
wells existed on private lands on top of
the plateau. Within the 53,805 acres of
the Roan Plateau planning area on top
of the plateau, more than 19,000 acres
are private lands, BLM statistics said.
Environmentalist groups oppose oil
and gas drilling on top of the plateau.
Steve Smith, regional director for the
Four Corners States office of the Wilderness Society, suggested BLM should
have worked longer with Colorado
state officials before making a decision.
‚ÄúThere is no rush to lease the Roan
Plateau given the large number of
leases already controlled by the oil and
gas companies and the many additional BLM acres in Colorado available for
leasing,‚Äù Smith said.

Jamie Connell, Glenwood Springs
BLM field manager, said the plan
was developed with significant help
from cooperating agencies, including
the Colorado Department of Natural Resources (CDNR), Garfield and
Rio Blanco counties, and the towns
of Parachute, Glenwood Springs, and
Rifle.
‚ÄúThe innovative approach we are
taking for tightly controlled energy
development on top of the plateau
comes from a proposal submitted by
[CDNR],‚Äù Connell said.
The decision authorizes a highly
restrictive approach to oil and gas
development on top of the plateau,
Connell said. Development there will
be conducted in a staged, ridge-byridge approach, with well pads no
closer than one-half mile apart. Surface
disturbance on top is limited to 1% of
the total acres at any one time. ‚ú¶

Tanzania

La Pampa Province awarded the
Gobernador Ayala III exploration concession in the Neuquen basin to Petro
Andina Resources Inc., private Calgary
firm.
The 82,800-acre block, adjacent to
the south boundary of company operated CNQ-7/A area, brings Petro Andina‚Äôs
land position in the Centenario Trend to
285,000 net acres.
Petro Andina signed an agreement
with Argentina‚Äôs state Enarsa and another Argentina company under which
Petro Andina is operator with 70%
working interest and the other parties
share the other 30%.
Petro Andina mapped an extension
of its El Corcobo Norte field onto GAIII
and plans to drill as many as 10 appraisal and exploration wells on the new
block in 2007 and shoot a 3D seismic
survey in the fourth quarter. The 2-year
work commitment totals 25 wells.

Arawak Energy Corp., Anguilla, British West Indies, plans to acquire retroactive to Jan. 1, 2007, Saigak Investments
BV, which owns 40% of mostly developed Saigak oil field in the Aktyubinsk
area of western Kazakhstan.
Seller is Vitol BV, which owns Saigak
Investments. Vitol holds 38.15% of
Arawak through Rosco SA.
Maersk Oil Kazakhstan Gmbh operates Saigak field, at which four wells
produce 3,500 b/d of sweet, 33-37¬∞
gravity oil from 14.6 million bbl of
original recoverable reserves from multiple formations at 2,000 m. The oil is
exported.
The field contract, signed in 1992, is
valid until 2017 with possible extensions.
Production is expected to drop at
15%/year the next 5 years without
investment, but later optimizations may
arrest the decline.

Tanzanian authorities approved farmout by Aminex PLC, Dublin, of a 25%
interest in the 1,400 sq km Nyuni-East
Songo Songo PSA area in the Indian
Ocean off Tanzania.
RAK Gas, incorporated in the United
Arab Emirate of Ras al Khaimah, will
pay 37.5% of the cost of two wells on
the block to earn the 25% interest. RAK
Gas has other exploration and production efforts under way in Tanzania.
Post-farmout interests are Aminex‚Äôs
Ndovu Resources Ltd., operator, 39%,
Key Petroleum Ltd., RAK Gas 25%, East
Africa Exploration Co. Ltd. 10%, and
Bounty Oil & Gas Ltd. 6%.
The Caroil-6 rig is to drill two wells
back to back on the block this year, the
first of which is to be a directional well
from Killiwani Island 1 km southwest
of Songo Songo Island.

BHP Billiton Petroleum Inc. launched the
hull for the Neptune tension-leg platform (TLP)
on May 19, 2007. After
a 5-day sail it reached
Production
location at Green Canyon
Block 613.
J. Michael Yeager, BHP Billiton‚Äôs
group president-energy, said ‚ÄúThe Neptune sail away is an important milestone
for BHP Billiton as it marks the beginning of installation for the company‚Äôs
first operated standalone, deepwater
production facility in the Gulf of
Mexico.‚Äù
The Gulf of Mexico is on the verge
of becoming a very significant producing area for the company. In addition to
Neptune, BHP Billiton has the Genghis Khan, Atlantis (nonoperated) and
Shenzi projects in development in the
Atwater fold belt region of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Yeager noted.
In June 2005, the company and its
partners sanctioned $850 million for
development of Neptune. Despite the
horrendous hurricane season experienced on the Gulf Coast later that year,
the project remains on schedule for first
production by yearend 2007, though
costs are under review.
Neptune field consists of Atwater
Blocks 573, 574, 575, 617, and 618,
about 120 miles off Louisiana. Water
depths range 4,200-6,500 ft, and the
TLP production facility will be in about
4,250 ft, above the Sigsbee escarpment.
BHP Billiton is designated operator
of the field with a 35% interest. Partners include Marathon Oil Co. (30%),
Woodside Energy (USA) Inc. (20%), a
subsidiary of Woodside Petroleum Ltd.,
and Maxus (US) Exploration (15%), a
subsidiary of Repsol YPF.
The single-column Atlantia SeaStar
TLP can process as much as 50,000 bo/
d and 50 MMcfd of natural gas from
wet-tree production wells.
‚ÄúThe field holds 100-150 MMboe
recoverable reserves, and first oil is
expected by yearend,‚Äù said Nigel Smith,
BHP Billiton‚Äôs president of development
for the petroleum group.

O D U C T I O N

Construction
In 2005, BHP Billiton and its Neptune partners awarded an engineering, procurement, construction, and
management (EPCM) contract to design
and build a SeaStar TLP to Atlantia Offshore Ltd. (now SBM Atlantia). Atlantia
received the contract after completing a
frontend engineering and design study
for a wet-tree TLP for the Neptune prospect. Atlantia is responsible for the complete TLP,
including hull and topsides
facilities and commissioning assistance.
Atlantia hired Signal
International LLC to build
the Neptune TLP hull.
Signal International Vice-Pres. Joe
Roche told OGJ that this is the first TLP
hull built by Signal; peak number of
people on this project was about 500
(Fig. 1).
Signal ordered steel in June 2005
and began the hull fabrication work
in fourth-quarter 2005 at its Orange,
Tex. facility, which has 450,000 sq ft
of covered area. The yard has been used
extensively to construct offshore drilling and production units. In 2004, the
drilling equipment module for a large
Gulf of Mexico spar was built and as-

sembled at Signal‚Äôs yards at Orange and
Port Arthur, Tex.
The six TLP tendons were built by
Gulf Marine Fabricators.
Atlantia‚Äôs Houston-based sister
company, SBM-Imodco, designed the
Neptune topside facilities, which are
scheduled to be launched from Houma,
La., by late June. Mating of the hull and
44

topsides will be done about a week
later.
The Neptune TLP will join four existing SeaStar TLPs in the Gulf of Mexico.
Of the previous four, three accommodate wet-tree production and one
supports dry trees.

The Neptune TLP was floated off Signal International‚Äôs World War II-vintage
mobile dry dock in Port Arthur a few
days before the sail away at a 141‚ÅÑ2-ft
draft (Fig. 2).
The winds and weather were favorable on May 19, blowing about 5 mph.
‚ÄúPerfect towing conditions,‚Äù said a
representative from Otto Candies LLC.
No cold fronts were forecast and it was
too early for tropical storms.
One main tug, the Kelly Candies,
and two assist tugs took the TLP from
the dock, through the channel to the
Sabine Pass sea buoy on the first day
at 2 knots/hr on a flood tide (Fig. 3).
Once in open water, the tug could pull
at 31‚ÅÑ2 knots for another 4 days travel to
location in Green Canyon.
Heerema Marine Contractor‚Äôs largest
deepwater construction vessel (DCV)
Thialf had preinstalled the piles and was
installing the tendons at the time the
hull left the dock.
After the hull installation commences, it will take about 5 days to position
the tendons, ballast, lock off on the
tendons, and pump water to create top
tension.
Heerema‚Äôs DCV Balder will pick up
and hang the steel catenary risers for
gas and oil export and two field flow
lines; the Thialf will use its dual cranes
to mate the topsides and hull.
Neptune production will flow to the
Mardi Gras pipeline system. Enbridge
owns and operates the 26-27 miles of
lateral lines, laid by Allseas in JanuaryFebruary 2007. The jumpers will be
installed June-August, BHP Billiton‚Äôs
Smith told OGJ. Neptune‚Äôs oil will flow
to the Caesar trunkline and gas to the
Cleopatra trunkline.

TLPs
Neptune is the 23rd TLP worldwide,
according to Mustang Engineering. It
joins 14 TLPs already installed in the
Gulf of Mexico.
There are three TLPs in the North
Sea: two off Norway, and one decommissioned off the UK. Four TLPs have
been installed off Africa: Kizomba A and

The West Seno A TLP was installed in the
Makassar Strait, off eastern Java.
Conoco installed the world‚Äôs first TLP
in the UK North Sea‚Äôs Hutton field in
July 1984, a six-column conventional
semisubmersible design that could
process 120,000 bo/d and 10 MMcfd
in 482 ft water depth (now retired;
OGJ, Nov. 5, 2001). Five years later, in
July 1989, Conoco installed the world‚Äôs
second TLP at the Jolliet field in the Gulf
of Mexico. The Jolliet TLP has a four-column hull, the most common TLP hull
design (17 of 23).
Most TLPs have steel hulls, 12 or 16
tendons attached to the four hull col-

umns, and dry trees. The Heidrun TLP,
installed in the Norwegian North Sea in
June 1995, is the first and so far only,
concrete hull.
Twenty years after Hutton, in August
2004, Conoco set a depth record, installing an extended-leg TLP in the Gulf
of Mexico‚Äôs Magnolia field in 4,674 ft
water depth (OGJ, Nov 22, 2004, p.
50).
The single-column monohull design
(Atlantia SeaStar) was adopted by Eni in
August 1998, when it installed the first
of the five SeaStars over the Morpeth
field, in the Gulf of Mexico. The SeaStar
TLP design has six tendons arranged in
a 3x2 pattern; production is from wettree wells.

E&P USA‚Äôs Matterhorn (July 2003), and
now Neptune (June 2007).
BHP Billiton‚Äôs Dennis McLaughlin,
project director for Neptune, told OGJ
that the Neptune team set the robust
design criteria for the TLP in 2004, following Hurricane Ivan, and they met
all ABS, Coast Guard, and US Minerals
Management Service code standards.
‚ÄúThe industry is constantly adjusting
criteria as it learns,‚Äù he said.
Then the Typhoon SeaStar TLP was
heavily damaged during Hurricane Rita
in 2005.
McLaughlin said that BHP Billiton, a
50% partner with operator ChevronTexaco, participated in all forensic activities
related to that incident.
The Neptune team used independent
third-party checks of all engineering
and design processes, as well as comprehensive model testing at a wave tank
in the Netherlands. McLaughlin told
OGJ that Neptune‚Äôs design is considerably different from preceding installations of the SeaStar TLP. It will be
the first deepwater facility that reflects
lessons learned from the 2004-05 hurricane seasons.

‚Ä¢ Neptune-3, 2002, 120 ft net pay.
‚Ä¢ Neptune-5, 2003, 500 ft net pay.
‚Ä¢ Neptune-7, 2004, 114 ft net pay.
In 2004, BHP Billiton signed a
2-year contract to drill in the Gulf of
Mexico with the GlobalSantaFe Development Driller 1 semisubmersible. In
April 2006, the company extended the
contract 4 more years, to 2010. The
DD1 began drilling the seven production wells in June 2006. All topholes
were predrilled.
Well completion procedures will be
similar to those used at Atlantis, said
Smith, including frac packs. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre
learning a lot from our nonoperated
interests,‚Äù he said.
BHP Billiton plans subsea completions for the seven Neptune wells at
four drill centers in the currently sanctioned southern part of the Neptune
field. Two of the drill centers have single
wells, another has two wells, and the
fourth has three wells and a manifold.
The company planned for additional
drill centers along the north flow line,
installing three inline sleds.
The 8-in. nominal diameter flowlines are insulated with 4-in.-thick
GSPU (glass syntactic polyurethane) but
are not heated. They were installed by
Technip.
Cameron and Aker Kvaerner are the
main subsea suppliers on the Neptune
project.
After Neptune, the DD1 may undertake drilling at the nearby Shenzi field,
Smith told OGJ.
‚ÄúWe have a tremendous amount of
activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico at this time,‚Äù said Yeager. ‚ÄúAlso, with
operated projects in Western Australia,
Pakistan, and Trinidad continuing to
progress, we are about to significantly
change BHP Billiton Petroleum.‚Äù ‚ú¶

The Ice Maiden is an
icebreaker converted to a
dynamically positioned
flotel for use during
offshore construction
(Fig. 1).

Dynamically positioned monohull Ô¨Çotel under construction
The Ice Maiden will
be the first dynamically
positioned multisupport
construction vessel capable of working anywhere
in the world, according
Production
to the vessel owner C&M
Group.
Formerly the vessel was the 14,000tonne Russian class icebreaker MV
Paardeberg. The 167 m long vessel has
a 23-m beam, two 25-tonne capacity
cranes, and a helideck with refueling
facilities for EH101 helicopters. Built

in 1991, C&M purchased the vessel in
December 2006.
The $100 million vessel conversion
is taking place at the Atlantic Marine
Shipyard in Mobile, Ala. The yard currently is installing new topsides with
accommodations for 400 people in
single rooms (Fig. 1).
C&M says the vessel will be the first
monohull flotel to work in the North
Sea when it goes on charter later this
year, and it expects the vessel with its
icebreaking capabilities will also find
work in areas such as above the Arctic
Circle and off Sakhalin Island. With its

450-mm thick hull, vessel specifications
indicate that the vessel can cut through
1.2-m thick ice plus 0.2-m thick snow
at 1.5 knots.
C&M notes that the vessel provides
highly sophisticated communications, fiber optics, digital closed-circuit
television, passenger on-board control
systems, and special low-temperature
cabling.
For dynamic positioning, the vessel
will have three sets of thrusters: two
3-Mw azimuths, four 2-Mw azimuths
nonretractable, and two 1.4-Mw tunnel
(Fig. 2). ‚ú¶

Worldwide natural gas production in
2006 increased by less than 2%, with
production in major gas processing
countries US and Canada advancing by
0.3% and 0.9%, respectively (OGJ, Mar.
12, 2007, p. 62).
It is little wonder, then, that gas
processing capacity in the US was essentially flat and in Canada fell nearly
6% from 2005 (Table 1).

nearly 150 bcf, reflecting flat processing
capacities for the region‚Äôs gas plants.
Worldwide, natural gas processing
capacities outside the US and Canada
continued to outpace capacities in
the world‚Äôs two largest gas processing
countries, a trend that emerged last
year for 2005 data. For 2006, gas-plant
capacities in the US and Canada reached
slightly less than 50% of world capacity for the second year in a row. That
trend was pushed by plants‚Äô capacities
in the US dropping by nearly 6%, while
Canada‚Äôs plants increased capacities by
only 0.58%.

Highlights
During 2006, natural gas production increased in all the world‚Äôs regions
except for the Middle East, OGJ numbers show. But in aggregate, the increases
were smaller than seen
between 2004 and
2005 (OGJ, June 18,
2006, p. 54). Nonetheless, the tip in gas
processing capacity to
regions outside the US
and Canada that became evident in 2005
remained in 2006.
Much of the new
gas production in
2006 went to feed
new LNG production
capacity in Nigeria
and Australia. In 2006,
Qatar surpassed Indonesia and Malaysia
to become the world‚Äôs leading exporter
of LNG.
2007 will see yet more LNG capacity
come online requiring yet more natural
gas capacity: More than 22.5 million
tpy of liquefaction capacity will start up
this year, pushing world liquefaction
capacity up by about 12% to more than
184 million tonnes/year.
New figures available for Canadian
NGL production forced an adjustment
in 2006 numbers and helped push US
and Candian NGL production for the
year up to 38.7% of the world totals
from slightly more than 33% in 2005,

Activity
What follows is a series of shapshots
of gas processing events in the last 15
months.

Europe and elsewhere
In Europe, Statoil ASA, on behalf
of state-owned Gassco AS, hired Vetco
Aibel to design, build, and install a gas
compressor and a condensate train at
the Kollsnes gas processing plant near
Bergen, Norway (cover photograph).
The 790-million kroner contract extends through the second half of 2008.
The Kollsnes plant processes gas from
Troll, Kvitebj√∏rn, and Visund fields and

moves it through four pipeline systems
to continental Europe.
These installations, capable of handling 143 million standard cu m/day of
gas, are owned by Gassled and operated
by Gassco, with Statoil as the technical
service provider.
Elsewhere last year, state-owned
Uzbekneftegaz began to build a $63.6million LPG unit at its gas processing
subsidiary Shurtanneftegaz in the Kashkadarya region of Uzbekistan.
Shurtanneftegaz, one of three gas
processing companies in Uzbekneftegaz, processes 11 billion cu m/year of
gas.
After three stages of construction,
the plant will produce 175,000 tonnes/

The first stage of construction was to be
completed by yearend 2006; the unit
will reach a capacity of 45,000 tonnes/
year.
Uzbekneftegaz said it plans several
projects to increase LPG production at
the Mubarek gas processing plant and
the Shurtan gas production complex.
In Africa, Khalda Petroleum Co.
hired Petrofac of London to design and
construct a fourth gas-conditioning
train at Salam on the Khalda Concession
in the western desert of Egypt, according to Apache Corp. Khalda is a joint
venture of Apache and Egyptian General
Petroleum Corp.
The fourth train and an earlier approved third train will increase total
conditioning capacity for production
from Apache‚Äôs Jurassic gas reserves to
710 MMcfd of gas and 66,000 b/d of
condensate.
Each train will be able to process 100
MMcfd of sales gas and 14,000 b/d of
sales condensate. The expansions target
completion by late 2008.
In Asia, Oil & Natural Gas Corp. of
India hired Toyo Engineering Corp. in
a ¬•20-billion job to build an NGL extraction plant at Dahej in Gujarat state.
Due for start-up in 2008, the plant will
extract liquids for use as petrochemical feedstock from LNG from Petronet

In Canada, Inter Pipeline Fund,
Canada, invested C$36 million to increase ethane production at the Empress V plant, where Inter Pipeline is
half owner. The work will hike ethane
production by about 45%, or 7,000
b/d. Construction began earlier this
year with first volumes coming secondquarter 2008.
In Mexico, Pemex announced in early 2007 that it will build two new gas
plants for production form the Burgos
basin in northeastern Mexico. Investment will reach $276 million. Building
the plants will be by a joint venture of
Mexico‚Äôs Empresas Ica and Fluor Corp.
called ICA Fluor. The first plant is due
on stream by June 2008; the second in
Oct 2008. Each plant will process 200
MMcfd, raising output capacity at the
Reynosa complex to 1.2 bcfd.

Sulfur production
Worldwide refining and natural
gas processing‚Äôs production of petroleum-derived sulfur in 2006 continued
to slide, to 84.2 million tonnes/day
from slightly less than 85 million tpd
in 2005 and from just more than 85
million tpd in 2004. Capacity increased
slightly to 178.5 million tpd from
slightly more than 178 million tpd in
2005.
Canada and the US continued to
dominate last year with 46.9% of
processing capacity, a slip from 47%
in 2005, and 48.6% of actual production, from 49% for 2005. Both figures
continue a decline from 2004.
Canada produced 23.3 million tpd
in 2006, nearly even with 23.4 million
tpd in 2005, down slightly from 2004.
US production in 2006 continued to
slip, to more than 17.6 million tpd
from slightly more than 18.5 tpd in
2005.
Canada last continued to account for
less than 24% of the overall total capacity and more than 27.6% of production,
nearly even with 27.5% in 2005. ‚ú¶

Ethane varies by region
Ethane is seldom transported in
ships from one region to another due
to the high costs of shipping cryogenic
products and a general lack of petrochemical demand beyond indigenous
supplies. Despite that difÔ¨Åculty, ethane
is an extremely important component
of the global petrochemical industry.
Nearly all ethane is extracted from
natural gas. Its physical properties are
between those of methane and propane. Methane is the main component
of natural gas, and much of the ethane
can either be left in the gas or extracted
from it along with the LPG.
Whether to recover ethane generally
depends on the economics of extracting it from the produced natural gas.
If ethane is to be recovered, its price
must be higher than its extraction and
puriÔ¨Åcation costs, including its gasbased heating value.
Analyses by Purvin & Gertz‚Äô strategic
partner, Chemical Market Associates
Inc. (CMAI), Houston, show that ethane

35%, and Purvin & Gertz estimates
that more than 40% of the world‚Äôs LPG
supplies will come from East of Suez by
2010.
On a percentage basis, production
increases have been particularly high
in the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), where supply increased
by nearly 14% to about 12.6 million
tonnes in 2006 from 6.8 million tonnes
in 2000.
Other regions that grew quickly on a
percentage basis in the same period include the Far East, Oceania, the Middle
East, the Indian subcontinent, and Latin
America, which each saw growth of
4-5%.
Since 2000, total global LPG production has increased by more than 28 million tonnes. On an absolute production
basis, the largest supply increase came
from the Middle East, which increased
by 8.7 million tonnes to about 43.3
million tonnes in 2006 from a relatively

was used to produce almost 31 million
tonnes of ethylene in 2006, or about
28% of the 110 million tonnes of ethylene produced during the year. Despite
this very large market, ethane‚Äôs use is
extensive in only a few regions of the
world, primarily the Middle East and
North America.

Regional ethane use
The largest regional use of ethane
occurs in the US and Canada, which
account for about half of all the ethane
consumed in the world. In the US,
ethane supplies are adequate to cover
industry needs, as signiÔ¨Åcant amounts
of ethane are still not recovered from
natural gas processing.
The Canadian petrochemical
industry uses ethane extensively in
Western Canada, while the eastern
Canadian industry uses a wider variety
of feedstocks. With ethane production
declining in Western Canada, propane
has been used to supplement that
production. Longer term, additional

gas supplies from the Mackenzie Delta,
Alaska, or both should help supplement current ethane supplies.
Latin America (primarily Mexico and
Argentina) produced almost 40% of its
ethylene from ethane. Ethane consumption in Western Europe accounted
for about 9% of that region‚Äôs total ethylene production.
Lastly, the Middle East has become
a signiÔ¨Åcant component of the global
ethane market. About two-thirds of
the ethylene produced in the region is
derived from ethane. Thus, the Middle
East uses about a quarter of the total
world‚Äôs consumption of ethane. As new
ethylene plants appear in several countries in the region, the Middle East‚Äôs
share of the ethane market should
grow to about 45% by 2010.
Additional ethane will need to be
extracted from natural gas to satisfy
global consumption for petrochemical
production. Ethane demand could rise
to around 50 million tonnes by the end
of the decade. Most of this expected increase would occur in the Middle East.

small since Iraq‚Äôs production was less
than 5% of the Middle East region.
The Middle East has historically
provided much of the LPG that is consumed in Asia, and this trade pattern
will likely continue for the foreseeable
future.
Increased crude oil production in the
Middle East during the last few years
has caused an increase in associated-gas
production in the region. The corresponding increase in LPG production
has freed up some supplies for export.
The largest increase in production,
however, came from the gas processing
industry in the Middle East. Refineries

Thus, the Middle East accounted for
almost a third of the world increase in
LPG production so far in this century.
As noted previously, the CIS region had
an increase of about 5.7 million tonnes.
The Far East and Latin America each had
increases of about 5.1 million tonnes.
Although the Indian subcontinent
and Oceania had large increases on a
percentage basis, their contributions on
an absolute basis were much smaller
because they started from a smaller
production base in 2000.

increased to 4.4
million tonnes in
2006 from 3.4
million tonnes in
2000. Oceania experienced growth
of almost 5%/year
during this period,
but the absolute
volumes are small
in comparison
with overall
worldwide supply.
Regional production will continue
to expand gradually.

Europe; CIS
Within the region, Mexico, Brazil,
Venezuela, and Argentina are the largest
producers of LPG, together accounting
for more than 80% of the 2006 LPG
production in the region. Gas processing in the region accounts for more
than 60% of LPG production, a percentage that will grow in the future.
Several countries in Latin America
have plans for new and expanded
gas liquefaction that will add to the
regional LPG supply. Purvin & Gertz
expects total LPG production in the
region will rise to slightly more than
30 million tonnes by 2010. Venezuela is
likely to have the largest supply growth
in the future as several new projects
are brought on line. Peru, which began
production from the Camisea field in
2004, should grow by almost 0.8 million tonnes as well.

Indian subcontinent
Production on the Indian subcontinent rose to 7.9 million tonnes in 2006
from only 6.3 million tonnes in 2000.
India dominates the region‚Äôs LPG supply, with around 95% of production.
Much of the growth has resulted from
additional crude oil refining capacity
that was added in the late 1990s.
More than two-thirds of regional
LPG production comes from refineries, which is a wide departure from the

60

world average. By 2010, regional production will likely increase to around 9
million tonnes.

Southeast Asia; Oceania
In Southeast Asia, about 56% of LPG
is produced from gas processing, and
the balance from refineries. The largest
suppliers in the region are Indonesia,
Thailand, and Malaysia, with Thailand
being the largest producer at around
38% of regional production.
Indonesia has struggled to maintain
LPG production at historic levels, due
mainly to declining gas production at
Bontang and Arun.
The Arun LNG plant was shut down
by civil unrest in the area, and LPG
exports from Arun were discontinued several years ago. Gas volumes at
Bontang continue to decline. Although
additional LNG projects are under way,
natural gas feeding some of the newer
projects is relatively dry and unlikely to
yield much LPG.
Purvin & Gertz expects that regional
LPG production in Southeast Asia will
increase by about 1.9 million tonnes
between 2006 and 2010. This estimate
assumes some growth in regional gas
processing. Also, there are plans for a
grassroots refinery in Vietnam, but this
project is unlikely to add significant
LPG volumes until at least 2009.
In nearby Oceania, LPG production

Northern Europe is a large but
mature producing region. LPG supplies have grown by about 1.2%/year
since 2000, including a 1.1% decline
in 2006. Production from the North
Sea represents a significant portion of
regional production, but refineries in
the region provide nearly half of the
region‚Äôs total LPG supplies. We expect
that regional supplies will be flat to
slightly reduced through the end of the
decade. Increased refinery supplies of
LPG should help offset declining North
Sea supplies.
In contrast, the neighboring CIS
region is experiencing a strong increase
in supply. In 2006, the CIS region
produced 12.6 million tonnes of LPG,
which represents nearly a 14% /year
increase since 2000. This growth occurred mainly as a result of additional
gas processing in several countries.

LPG demand growth
Total global demand for LPG was
slightly more than 227 million tonnes
in 2006. Purvin & Gertz estimates that
the market will grow to about 236
million tonnes in 2007 and reach more
than 260 million tonnes by 2010. Thus,
demand will likely grow by a total of
about 32% compared with demand of
198 million tonnes in 2000 (Fig. 1).

LNG, liquids projects to push LPG into markets
Future global production of LPG will
be greatly affected by the additional
natural gas produced in conjunction
with liquefaction projects. New projects
and expansions have been announced
or planned for Qatar, Nigeria, Angola,
Indonesia, Russia, Norway, and several
other countries. These projects may
add a large increment of LPG supply
to the world markets during the next 5
years.
The most notable projects are in Qatar, with development of several new
LNG trains associated with the North
Field, the world‚Äôs largest nonassociated gas Ô¨Åeld. Recoverable reserves in
the Ô¨Åeld are estimated to be as much
as 900 tcf of natural gas, representing

LPG since 2000 averaged 2.5%/year,
growth rates in individual geographic
regions have varied significantly. The
highest growth in base demand (i.e.,
outside the price-sensitive petrochemical industry) has occurred in developing regions of the world. In the more
mature economies of Western Europe
and North America, LPG base demand
increased much more slowly than the
global average.
Demand growth in 2006 continued
to be high in the Middle East, Africa,
the CIS, Southeast Asia, and the Indian
subcontinent. Much of this demand
growth resulted from rising consumption by the residential-commercial sector. Demand growth in the Middle East
primarily, however, resulted from the
region‚Äôs expansion of its petrochemical
sector.

Asia, Oceania
The total Asian market‚Äîthe Far East,
Southeast Asia, and Indian subcontinent‚Äîovertook North America as the
largest LPG consuming market in the
world in 2001. LPG demand in Asia totaled about 66 million tonnes in 2006.
For comparison, the North American

about 20% of the world‚Äôs proven gas
reserves.
If these LNG production projects are
developed on their current timeframes,
Qatar‚Äôs production could soar to more
than 8 million tonnes of LPG by 2010
from only 1.4 million tonnes in 2000.
Iran has plans to develop natural gas
projects associated with the portions
of the same gas Ô¨Åeld that fall within
its national waters. LPG supplies from
Iran will likely increase by more than
50% as the South Pars Ô¨Åeld is developed. Some of the additional LPG will
be used in petrochemical projects that
are being developed in conjunction
with the gas production and processing
facilities.
Expansion projects in Nigeria will

also increase LPG production. Additions to the Escravos and Oso gas
liquids projects should add to LPG production by 2010, and the Olokola and
Brass LNG projects should continue
to ramp up LPG production. For both
Nigeria and Iran, however, instability
threatens the continued development
of these projects.
Along with the additional LPG
derived from natural gas liquefaction
around the world, more LPG production will also come from existing
and new gas processing and reÔ¨Ånery
projects.
Purvin & Gertz expects that LPG
supplies during 2006-10 will expand
more rapidly than in the Ô¨Årst half of the
decade. Total global LPG supply will
likely reach 260 million tonnes by 2010,
up from 227 million tonnes in 2006.

market was about 62 million tonnes in
2006.
LPG demand in Asia has increased
by an average 3.6%/year since 2000.
Nearly 70% of total demand in the
region is for use in the residential-commercial sector. It is interesting to note
that South Korea is the world‚Äôs largest
consumer of LPG for automobile fuel;
at a 2006 consumption of about 4.2
million tonnes of LPG, however, this
application still represents a relatively
small contribution to the total Asian
market demand.
Almost all of the demand growth for

LPG in Asia is in the residential-commercial sector. This region includes
more than 3.5 billion people, or almost
56% of the world‚Äôs total population.
Continued economic growth in this
region will result in additional consumption of LPG, although more slowly
than during the last 10 years. Per-capita
consumption of LPG in this region
will likely increase significantly in the
future.
Within the region, Japan and
China are the largest consumers of LPG.

na totaled about 19.0 million tonnes,
while Japan‚Äôs total was 18.2 million
tonnes.
Growth in Chinese demand for LPG
was very strong at about 20%/year
throughout the 1990s but has slowed
to 6.7%/year since 2000, with 2006
growth of only about 2%. Chinese
demand has been dampened by high
prices relative to alternatives for cooking and heating. Purvin & Gertz expects
that Chinese demand will continue to
grow but not at rates seen in the 1990s.
In contrast, Japanese demand growth
was 0.4%/year during the 1990s and
has been negative at -0.6%/year since
2000. Japan‚Äôs mature market will exhibit only modest demand growth.
The LPG market in Southeast Asia
is much smaller than the Far East but
generally growing faster. The Far East
market was more than six times the size
of the Southeast Asian market in 2000,
but the ratio has since narrowed to less
than 5.5. Some of the Southeast Asian
markets have exhibited strong growth
rates and are becoming more important
regional players in the LPG trade.
The region has experienced total
LPG demand growth of greater than
5%/year since 2000. Total LPG demand
in the region grew to about 8.7 million
tonnes in 2006 from 6.6 million tonnes
in 2000.
Much of the demand in the region is
concentrated in Malaysia and Thailand,
both of which have mature LPG markets
with high penetration in the residential-commercial markets. Together, these
two countries represent 60% of the
total demand in the region.
Most countries in Southeast Asia,
with the notable exception of Singapore, have experienced reasonably
high growth rates during the last 10
years. More than 70% of the regional
consumption is in the residential-commercial sector. Purvin & Gertz expects
that growth in this sector will continue
through the rest of the decade at more
than 5%/year.
With almost 10%/year of growth
expected, Vietnam will likely exhibit the
highest growth rate of any country in

the region through 2010.
The LPG markets in the Indian
subcontinent continue to exhibit
strong potential growth. In 2006, total
demand rose to about 11.2 million
tonnes from only 7.2 million tonnes in
2000. This increase represents growth
of more than 9%/year. Almost all of this
demand is concentrated in India, which
accounts for more than 90% of the total
LPG consumption on the subcontinent.
Compared with Asia, LPG demand
in nearby Oceania is very low at only
2.1 million tonnes in 2006. Australia
dominates the regional market with total consumption of 1.9 million tonnes.
One unique aspect of the Australian
market is the very high use of LPG as
auto fuel, an end-use sector that accounts for about 60% of the total use in

sector should remain relatively steady,
with moderate growth during the next
few years.
Iran is the next largest consumer
of LPG in the Middle East, accounting
for slightly more than 20% of regional
demand. Demand growth in Iran has
averaged almost 8%/year since 2000.
Petrochemical use of LPG in the country
will increase dramatically after 2010,
pushed by expanded production from
the South Pars field.

Europe

LPG demand has increased rapidly
in some countries of Eastern Europe.

attributes allow the US Gulf Coast to
consume large amounts of LPG when
the price is right.
Consequently, when global supply of
LPG exceeds base demand, the US Gulf
Coast is often the superior outlet for
the excess supply because the LPG can
be cracked as feedstock or stored until
prices improve.
Base demand in North America
has grown at only 0.4%/year since
2000. Even with the price-sensitive
demand included, the growth rate was
only 1.2%/year. This small percentage
growth rate, however, masks the absolute demand increase due to the large
size of the market. Total LPG consumption in the North American market increased by 4.3 million tonnes 2000-06.
For comparison, by itself, this increase
is twice the size of the total LPG consumption in Oceania in 2006.
Because North America is a very
mature market, Purvin & Gertz does
not expect base demand to grow appreciably in the region. Base demand
growth should average only about
1%/year through 2010. Demand by the
price-sensitive market, however, should
expand rapidly until the surplus peaks,
likely in 2008.
After the peak of the surplus, pricesensitive demand will decline but
should remain relatively high for several
years as the petrochemical industry
takes advantage of low-cost global
supplies. Total LPG demand, including the price-sensitive demand, will
likely average nearly 4%/year growth
through 2008, and then to decline
through the end of the decade as global
base demand catches up with the new
production.

Trade patterns
An interesting shift in global LPG
trade patterns occurred in the late
1990s. Between 1995 and 2000, LPG
demand in the East of Suez region
increased by about 17.3 million tpy.
During this same period, supplies in
the region increased by only 15 million
tonnes/year. Although these changes
seem subtle, the overall LPG supply-de-

mand balance East of Suez shifted from
a surplus of supplies to a deficit (Fig. 3).
Conversely, West of Suez experienced an
equal but opposite shift in its LPG supply-demand balance.
These relative changes in regional
supply-demand balances affected world
LPG trade patterns. The Far East continues to be the largest LPG importing region in the world. Additional consumption of LPG to produce petrochemicals
in some of the exporting countries in
the Middle East, however, has reduced
LPG available for export. Therefore,
in recent years the Far East has had to
import LPG from increasingly diverse
sources to meet the demand of the
region. As a result, imports into the Far
East have come from West and North
Africa and even from the North Sea.
The US continues to be the primary
swing destination or supplier of LPG to
the global market. The US has a large
capacity to store LPG during times of
excess global supplies and can also supply LPG from storage to other regions
when their supplies are tight. Furthermore, the US petrochemical industry
can consume large amounts of LPG
when prices are attractive relative to
other possible feedstocks.
Our analysis indicates that the
increase in global LPG supplies will outpace the increase in base demand during the next couple of years. Therefore,
discretionary consumption of LPG as
a feedstock for petrochemical production (price-sensitive demand) will need
to increase. Total global price-sensitive
demand will likely increase by as much
as 6-7 million tonnes/year 2006-08.
As base demand increases to take up
more of the surplus, the price-sensitive
demand should decline somewhat by
the end of the decade. At the peak of
the surplus, about half of the increase
is likely to come to the United States
Gulf Coast with the balance to Western
Europe and the Far East. ‚ú¶

A new method allows
for determination of axial force on subsea pipelines within the context
of DNV-RP-F105-2006,
expanding the scope of
Pipelines
current recommended
practices and benefiting
both project economics and safety.
Existing recommended practices
for free span analysis
do not address how to
determine axial force in
subsea pipelines, except
for theoretical simplified conditions of axially
completely unrestrained
or totally restrained pipe.
As a result, the designer often uses the
totally restrained value to be conservative.
Axial force plays an especially important role in pipelines operated at higher
pressures and temperatures. HPHT
conditions result in a higher axial force
and through this higher longitudinal
stresses, which affect allowable free
span lengths. Determination of actual
axial force therefore affects the economics of a pipeline project.

Method determines axial
force in subsea pipelines
Alexander Aynbinder
Houston

Effective axial force governs static
analysis, including determination of
stresses and natural frequency. It depends on operating parameters such as
pressure, temperature, pipeline deflection, and soil restriction.
Seabed unevenness, change of seabed
topology, strudel scours, and artificial
supports required for existing pipeline
crossings can all lead to free spans in
subsea pipelines. Assessment of free
span requires structural (static) analysis.
This article provides guidance within
the development of DNV RP-F1052006 for assessment of pipeline free
spans based on design criteria.

Background
For a single span, an analytical solution procedure to estimate axial forces
caused by high pressure and high temperature differentials considers pipeline
longitudinal movement (sliding) and
transverse deflection.1 It also considers
the soil resistance at the shoulder of the
span, nonlinear relations between strain
and deflection, and the thermoelasticity relationship between strain and load
effects.

Basic assumption
This article‚Äôs basic assumptions
coincide with the realistic characterization of the cross-sectional behavior
of a pipeline.1 The equations‚Äô bending
stiffness coincides with that of concrete
coated steel pipe.
This article, however, does not consider changes in the concrete-coated
pipe‚Äôs bending stiffness caused by
bending moments (OGJ, June 19, 2006,
p. 53) and assumes the steel pipe‚Äôs material linearity (OGJ, June 22, 1998, p.
72). Linear transverse and longitudinal
stiffness modeled pipe-soil interaction.
Recommended practice may determine
the values of the concrete-coated pipe‚Äôs
stiffness and the soil stiffness.1
Soil resistance and relaxation due to
pipeline displacement determine the

effective axial force caused by pressure
and temperature differentials. Timoshenko‚Äôs method addressed so-called
geometrical stiffness, governed by the
effective axial force.2 The determination of pipeline configuration due to
transverse load (submerged weight of
the pipe in vertical direction or drag
loading in horizontal direction) provides the basis for this method, prior
to analyzing the pipeline with initial
displacement due to lateral force.

Transverse load
Equation 1 provides classical equilibrium in terms of transverse displacement (v) for the free span (subscript 1)
and the shoulder (subscript 2), based
on the soil resistance model assumption
(see accompanying equation box). The

force. Equation 6c describes
the effective axial force,
which is positive in compression.
After determination of
the arbitrary constants from
the boundary conditions, the
solutions of the above differential equations (Equation
7) describe the deflection of
the free span and the shoulder. Equation 7 uses dimensionless parameters of the
effective axial force; the ratio
of the effective axial force
to the Euler critical buckling
force for the pipeline with
fixed ends and to the critical
buckling load for the infinite
pipeline with linear soil stiff-

ness.
As follows from Equation 7, the value of parameter Œª = 0 defines buckling.
Fig. 2 represents the area of stable
equilibrium.
Since a value of zero for parameter
n defines the fully fixed ends, the soil
stiffness is reduced as n increases from
zero, reducing the critical force along
with it.
Equation 8 defines bending moments M and deflections f at the middle
(Œ∂ = 1) and ends (Œ∂ = 0) of the span.
Equation 8 stems from Equation 7
which describes the pipeline deflections. These equations also represent the
known formulas for a single pipeline
span with both fixed ends multiplied by
soil stiffness parameters.
The bending moment at midspan,
caused by the compressive effective
axial force, increases with soil stiffness
reduction. The bending moments at the
span ends diminish if this axial force
is less than the Euler critical force for a
span with both fixed ends, but increase
if the axial force is more than the Euler
force for the same soil stiffness.

6c. The unknown true steel-wall axial
force depends primarily on temperature
differentials and pressure that can be
determined from the continuity equation of the longitudinal displacement at
the end of span described by Equation
9.
The nonlinear relation between the
strain, displacement, and deflection
(Equation 10) and the thermoelasticity
relationship between strain and load
effects (Equation 11) can determine
longitudinal displacement at the ends
of the span from the free-span portion. The equilibrium condition of the
shoulder line with soil stiffness in the
longitudinal direction Kx (Equation 12)
can determine the longitudinal displacement of the shoulder ends.
Calculating displacement components in Equation 9 in accordance with
Equations 13 and 14 allows rewriting
it as Equation 15. Solving nonlinear
Equation 15 allows determination of
the parameter of effective axial force, m.
MathCAD can solve this essentially
nonlinear equation. MathCAD software
provides for the numerical integration
required to solve Equation 15.

the fundamental features of Equation
15. Equation 17 shows the integral in
Equation 16 written in closed form.
Fig. 3, based on Equations 15 and
17, shows the parameter of axial force
for a free span with fixed ends vs. the
pressure and temperature differential.
This result plays an important role
in qualitative assessment. Axial force
caused by pressure and temperature
effects cannot exceed the critical force
of the span with initial deflection, the
ratio of axial force to critical force (m2)
tending to one.
Solving Equation 15 also allows determination of the fundamental natural
frequency taking boundary conditions
into account.
Ratios of natural frequencies in
pipelines with different boundary conditions are proportional to the square
roots of their corresponding static
deflections. Equation 19, therefore,
determines the fundamental natural
frequency adjusted for the axial force,
which in turn is based on the classical
solution for pipelines with fixed ends
as well as the parameters of deflection
for a free span shown in Equations 4
and 8c.

Design application
The described method can determine
free-span structural analysis parameters
such as bending moments, axial force,
deflections, and the fundamental natural
frequency required by DNV-RP-F-105.
Data for a typical 10-in. offshore high
pressure-high temperature (2,300 psig,
180¬∞ F.) pipeline illustrate the application of this new method.
Table 1 presents results of calculations (output) performed by the
MathCAD program developed for this
condition. MathCAD‚Äôs ability to conduct the numerical integration required
for the calculation procedure led to its
selection.
DNV-RP-F-105 paragraph 6.2.5
provides the basis for calculating the
stiffening effect of the concrete coating,1 with the soil transverse and axial
stiffness parameters calculated according to Equations 2c and 12.
Equation 4 then provides the basis

according to Equation 16b, and load
effect parameter according to Equation
16a. Equation 19 determines the true
steel-wall axial force once the parameter of effective axial force is known.
Total bending moments determine
maximum-minimum longitudinal
stresses due to the transverse load according to Equation 4 and axial load
according to Equation 8, as well as the
true steel wall axial force according to
Equation 19.
The Von Mises combined stress,
which considers longitudinal and hoop
stresses (according to Equation 11),
may act as one of the criteria for allowable free span assessment. Effective axial
force determines the fundamental natural frequency (first Eigen frequency)
according to Equation 19, which also
considers boundary conditions.
The proposed method can be applied
to the provisions of the DNV Codes
and allows inclusion of stress analyses
required for free span assessments of
HPHT pipelines. ‚ú¶

New corrosion inhibitor helps well production
New Clean N Cor cleaning and corrosion inhibitor treatment program is
designed to protect and maximize production from oil fields with oil sludge deposition challenges.
The program incorporates hands-on
technical expertise with advanced chemistry and in-field monitoring to provide
a comprehensive treatment solution
that removes sludge deposits from inner
pipe walls and filter equipment and then
prevents aggressive corrosion from taking
place.
In one user‚Äôs water injection system,
the firm notes, this level of sludge removal
translated to 75% more water being injected, resulting in increased oil production
and an 800% return on investment. Once
the sludge had been removed, Clean N Cor
prevented it from readsorbing and then
protected the pipe surface by providing
a film that acted as a barrier to corrosive
fluids. The required dosage to maintain an
acceptably low corrosion rate was nearly

20% lower than the dosage required for
conventional corrosion inhibitors, the firm
says.

Mobile rotary rig handles deep-hole drilling
Here‚Äôs the RD20 truck-mounted rotary,
deep-hole drilling rig designed specifically
for oil, gas, and coalbed methane wells.
Mounted on a 380 hp, five-axle, 10 ft
by 6 ft tridem carrier with manually controlled lockers on all three rear axles, it is
designed to reach most locations under its
own power. The separate truck engine and
drive train are designed to move the rig
down the road at standard highway speeds
and provide power for off-road maneuverability.
From the time the RD20 arrives on
location, it typically can be rigged up and
drilling in 1 to 3 hr, the firm says. It has a
755 hp engine and available air-on-board.

Converting the rig
for mud service is
designed to take less
than 15 min. With
the firm‚Äôs disconnect
box, the compressor can be turned off
from the power train,
saving fuel and wear.
The patented twocylinder carriage feed
system and hydraulic top-head drive are
designed to deliver 120,000 lbf ft (533.7
kN) of pullback and 30,000 lbf ft (133.5
kN) pulldown force. The drill pipe and
casing are handled with the rotary head,
eliminating the need for a large drawworks
and spinner. The torque limit control is
designed to allow precise torque settings
that match pipe and casing requirements.
When a joint is torqued to specification,
the rotary head automatically stops.

Restrained oil
investment seen
in biofuel push
When the head of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries warns that
a global rush toward biofuels might push
oil prices ‚Äúthrough the roof,‚Äù is he issuing a
calculated threat or a serious warning?
According to a June 5 report in the
Financial Times of London, OPEC Sec. Gen.
Abdalla El-Badri said OPEC members might
trim their investment plans in response

T h e
E d i t o r ‚Äô s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

to efforts by industrial countries to raise
production of biofuels.
OPEC‚Äôs most important exporters face
huge investment requirements as rising
global consumption and limits on production elsewhere raise demand for their
crude.
Their problem is determining how much
to invest now in order to meet demand
years from now, which requires knowing
what demand will be, which is impossible.
The difÔ¨Åculty is of course complicated
when governments of the largest consuming countries orient policy to using less
OPEC oil and more of costly alternatives.
Claude Mandil, head of the International
Energy Agency, was quick to point out that
the biofuels contribution to total energy
supply will remain small and that requirements for OPEC oil will continue to grow.
He should know. But he doesn‚Äôt have to
risk the hundreds of billions of dollars that
the world needs OPEC members to invest
in production capacity if energy needs are
to be met a decade or two from now.
A seemingly unrelated but similar
threat‚Äîor warning, as the case may
be‚Äîcannot have raised the conÔ¨Ådence of
OPEC‚Äôs investors.
The statement came June 7 from Charlie
Drevna, executive vice-president of the
National Petrochemical & ReÔ¨Åners Association, at a US House subcommittee hearing
on alternative fuels.
‚ÄúThe domestic reÔ¨Åning industry is likely
to look upon rapidly rising ethanol and
other biofuels requirements in the coming
years as adding signiÔ¨Åcantly more risk to
investments in capacity expansions,‚Äù he
said. In the past year, he noted, projections
of US reÔ¨Åning-capacity additions during
2006-10 have fallen to ‚Äúwell below 1 million
b/d‚Äù from 1.5 million b/d.
OPEC members know from painful
experience that US reÔ¨Åners don‚Äôt buy crude
they can‚Äôt process.
Manipulative threats or serious warnings? Check this space 25 years from now.

Good year for independent reÔ¨Åners
Although the summer season of gasoline demand in the US has barely started,
Eitan Bernstein of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc., Arlington, Va., said, ‚ÄúIt
already looks like 2007 will be the best year yet for the independent reÔ¨Åners.‚Äù
As of the Ô¨Årst week of June, he said, ‚ÄúUS reÔ¨Åning margin indicators have averaged 37% above comparable year-ago levels and, with gasoline inventories near
record lows, rising demand, and ongoing supply constraints, we believe that the current high reÔ¨Åning margin environment is likely to continue with any unexpected supply disruptions producing price spikes. Additionally, it is important to note that the
issues that contributed to the current supply situation (i.e., rising demand, an aging
reÔ¨Ånery Ô¨Çeet, more stringent environmental regulations, and a stretched labor force)
suggest that the broader upward trend in reÔ¨Åning margins may continue longer than
most investors expect.‚Äù
Gasoline inventories will likely remain low through the summer, said Bernstein.
‚ÄúUS gasoline inventories have fallen by nearly 15% over the past few months and
are now 5% below comparable prior-year levels. This is due to a combination of
strong domestic consumption growth (plus 1.7% year-to-date), a heavier-than-normal spring maintenance season, and a decline from last year‚Äôs record import levels.
While inventories have recently begun rising, they remain well below comparable
year-ago levels and will likely stay low through the summer.‚Äù
He said US gasoline inventories would have to increase a total of 9 million bbl
over the next 3 months to catch up to 2006 levels by the end of summer. ‚ÄúHowever,
over the past 3 years, gasoline inventories have fallen by an average of 10 million
bbl during the summer months, with the best year having shown no change in inventories and the worst year having experienced a 27 million bbl drop, as a very active Gulf of Mexico hurricane season materially reduced production,‚Äù Bernstein said.
The US Energy Information Administration reported a larger-than-expected jump
in commercial US gasoline stocks, up 3.5 million bbl to 201.5 million bbl in the week
ended June 1, the latest period available before deadline. That ‚Äúmarked the Ô¨Åfth
straight rise in US gasoline inventories; however, the sluggish return and string of
reÔ¨Ånery maintenance issues, combined with strong gasoline demand, has left gasoline inventories signiÔ¨Åcantly below the 5-year average,‚Äù said analysts in the Houston
ofÔ¨Åce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
Interest rates
Despite some earlier bullish indicators, crude futures prices suffered a moderate
loss in the week ended June 8 as investors‚Äô concerns that higher interest rates could
slow economic growth triggered a slump across the commodities markets in the last
trading session.
Crude prices rallied earlier in the week as Cyclone Gonu threatened Middle East
oil supplies, reports circulated of a Turkish invasion of Iraq, and ofÔ¨Åcials of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries again said they would react only to supply
and demand fundamentals, not high oil prices. ‚ÄúIn the end, there has been so far no
report of Gonu-linked damages to oil installations, Turkey did not invade Iraq, and
the OPEC statement is a repeat of what they have been saying for more than a year,‚Äù
said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland.
However, he said, ‚ÄúThe market is in a phase of reacting to bullish items and
discounting their nonconÔ¨Årmation. As long as it stays in that mode it will Ô¨Ånd further
supporting items such as strikes in Nigeria or Brazil but will need at one stage some
conÔ¨Årmation of the disruption premium it is adding to the Ô¨Çat price.‚Äù
Such conÔ¨Årmation was not forthcoming as Oman‚Äôs only oil terminal resumed
operations June 8 after being closed for 3 days by the dissipating Cyclone Gonu.
But a price decline on June 8 was tempered in early trading ‚Äúby news that Norway‚Äôs
mature oil Ô¨Åelds reduced their monthly production by 7.4%, a downward trend that
we expect to continue,‚Äù said Raymond James analysts.
The July contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes escalated by $1.13 to
$66.21/bbl June 4 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Cyclone Gonu churned
through the Arabian Sea with the force of a Category 5 hurricane, potentially threatening shipments of a Ô¨Åfth of the world‚Äôs oil through the nearby Strait of Hormuz. The
contract dropped 60¬¢/bbl in proÔ¨Åt-taking on June 5. But it recouped 35¬¢/bbl in the
next session and gained 97¬¢ to $66.93/bbl June 7, the highest front closing price in
more than a month on NYMEX. On June 8, however, it fell $2.17 to $64.76/bbl, down
32¬¢/bbl for that week.

In the 1990s, there was a move toward privatization and deregulation in most Latin American countries in an effort to lure international companies to put their money and expertise into exploration
and development of oil and gas resources. Although a few countries
have stayed the course, the recent move to “resource nationalism”
among several Latin American countries has replaced some of the
earlier policy changes and legal reforms to encourage private investment. In this issue, a special report starting on p. 20 provides a short
review of what has transpired in eight major oil and gas producing
countries in recent years. A second article on p. 24 takes a look at a
major figure behind that change,Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
Few other politicians are as well known internationally in Latin
America as Chavez, whose policies are debated throughout that
region. Almost every Latin American country has had presidential
elections in the last 2 years, and Chavez and his policies have been a
factor in most of those elections.

Iraqi oil minister defends stance on oil contracts

Kazakhstan, Eni JV near Kashagan tax agreement

Iraqi Oil Minister Husayn Al Shahristani has defended his country’s efforts to prevent international oil companies from signing
exploration and production contracts with the Kurdish Regional
Government.
In an interview televised via Dubai’s Al-Arabiyah satellite channel, Al Shahristani said current Iraqi law does not allow any governorate or ministry other than the oil ministry to conclude oil
contracts until the new oil and gas law is enacted.
When the law is enacted, he said, a Federal Oil and Gas Council
will be established, and it will be the authority to which oil contracts are submitted for approval.
Until then, he said, the constitution is clear: “Iraqi oil is for Iraq.
The only side that represents all Iraq is the federal government, and
it is not permissible for any part of Iraqi oil to be extracted and
taken by whatever quarter without the Iraqi government’s agreement.”
Al Shahristani denied that any intimidation was behind Baghdad’s decision to exclude companies that have concluded agreements with the KRG from signing contracts in other areas of Iraq.
“It is not a policy of arm-twisting,” he said, “It is a purely legal
position.”
He said dealings with the KRG and companies have not shifted
from diplomacy to threats to dissuade them from concluding contracts: “I do not call what is happening a threat to anyone. All I said
is that they should consider—and we are advising those companies—that when they violate Iraqi laws that are in force, they must
bear the consequences.”
Asked about his statement that foreign companies that produce
oil on the basis of agreements concluded with the KRG will not be
able to export the oil without the federal authorities’ agreement, Al
Shahristani said that is clear, and the companies know it.
He repeated that revenues from the export of Iraqi oil must be
paid into a single federal fund and distributed among all Iraqis in
their various areas according to the density of population.
Earlier this month, Al Shahristani said India’s Reliance Industries
Ltd. may find the going tough in acquiring future oil blocks in Iraq
(OGJ Online, Nov. 20, 2007).
His remarks followed earlier reports that the KRG had signed
five production-sharing contracts previously approved by its Regional Oil and Gas Council (OGJ Online, Nov. 13, 2007).

Kazakhstan’s Deputy Finance Minister Daulet Yergozhin said the
ministry is moving forward with tax checks into the Eni SPA-led
Agip KCO consortium just days ahead of a Nov. 30 deadline for a
deal between the consortium and the government on the Kashagan
oil field.
“We have questions,” Yergozhin said. “We will expect answers
to our inquiries over the next few days.” He said the ministry will
be ready to present a tax claim against Agip-KCO before yearend.
Yergozhin’s statement followed recent reports of progress in
talks between the government and the Agip-KCO consortium.
The Interfax-Kazakhstan news agency, citing an unnamed government source, said there is progress on the standpoints set forth
in a memorandum to the effect that KazMunayGaz’s share in the
project should be raised, that the amount of profit oil should be
increased, and that spending should be cut.
“Now a proposal agreed by all contractors remains to be received in order for the government to consider it and take the appropriate decision,” said the official, adding that members of the
consortium must submit their ideas to the Kazakh government by
Nov. 30.

Court drops Ecuadorian suits against Chevron
The US District Court for the Northern District of California has
dismissed the remaining two claims against Chevron Corp. alleging
health impacts to Ecuadorian citizens resulting from a subsidiary’s
oil operations that ended in 1992.
“The ruling, based on California’s 2-year statute of limitations,
effectively brings the matter to an end,” Chevron said in a statement. It said the lawsuit was the third in a series of suits that had
been launched by Cristobal Bonifaz, a Massachusetts-based trial attorney claiming to represent Ecuadorian plaintiffs.
The suits claimed chemicals and wastewater dumped by Chevron subsidiary Texaco Petroleum in the years it operated in Ecuador
caused several inhabitants to develop cancer. In October, however,
the judge imposed sanctions and a $45,000 fine against Bonifaz
after the plaintiffs admitted they did not have cancer.
Chevron is still fighting a major lawsuit in Ecuador over claims
of environmental damage. In October, the firm filed a petition with
the Ecuador Superior Court seeking dismissal of that suit. ✦

Reports said that as a result of the Bubut discovery, Shell will
reevaluate the nearby Danau structure, which was drilled in the
1970s. Additional appraisal work will be conducted in both fields
to define their full potential.
Both fields would be developed in a single, integrated program,
the company said.
“You can see the BLNG plant from the exploration rig. The discovery is in shallow waters and close to existing infrastructure and,
as such, we are confident of bringing production on stream in the
shorter term,” said Grahaeme Henderson, Brunei Shell managing
director, in making the announcement to local media.

CNPC, PDVSA reach deal for Orinoco exploration
China National Petroleum Corp. said Venezuela has granted oil
exploration rights in Sumano oil field to its joint venture with
state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA).
CNPC said it will take a 40% interest in any commercial production in the block, with the balance reserved for PDVSA. The two
firms will set up a joint venture to develop two additional blocks
in Venezuela’s Orinoco heavy oil belt, but CNPC did not name the
blocks.
China and Venezuela signed a series of oil development deals
during Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez’s visit to China in August 2006, including one for CNPC and PDVSA to jointly develop a
block in the Junin area of the Orinoco belt.

Afren to acquire block interests in Ghana, Angola
Afren PLC has agreed to acquire Devon Energy Corp.’s interests in two exploration blocks in Ghana and Angola. Afren will
acquire a 95% working interest in and operatorship of the Keta
Block off eastern Ghana and a 15% working interest in Angola’s
Block 16.
The acquisition, which is subject to certain conditions, preferential rights, and governmental approvals, is in line with Devon’s
strategy to sell off its West African assets, the company said. The Keta
Block lies in the Volta River basin and covers 5,500 sq km. Devon,
which had carried out extensive technical work in the area, identified primary targets as Upper Cretaceous deepwater sandstone
reservoirs that have not yet been drilled. The play type is similar to
the Mahogany and Hyedua discoveries to the west.
Further evaluation of reprocessed seismic data is ongoing, and
the expected mean potential reserves are about 250-500 MMboe.

&

The current license on the block expires at the end of 2008 and
includes one commitment well. The license can be extended for an
additional 6 years, which is divided into three 2-year periods, each
with a firm well commitment.
Ghana National Petroleum Corp. has a 5% carried interest in
the block.
Block 16 off Angola lies within the Lower Congo basin and covers an area of 4,936 sq km. AP Maersk Co. Ltd. holds a 50% interest
and operates the block. Other partners include Brazilian firm Odebrecht SA (15%) and Angola’s Sonangol EP (20%).
This exploratory block has nine wells and two discoveries of
Miocene and Oligocene age. The discoveries, prospects, leads, and
play types mapped in Block 16 are analogous to adjacent fields in
Blocks 15, 17, 31, and 32. The plays are considered to be highly
prospective with several leads and prospects identified. The expected mean potential reserves are about 1,000 MMboe. The discoveries on Block 16 are under appraisal with the potential for early
development.

Trinidad and Tobago to award Block 2 PSC soon
Trinidad and Tobago’s Ministry of Energy and Energy Resources
reported it will reach an agreement within the next 6 weeks with
Tullow Oil PLC and Centrica Resources, enabling them to explore
Block 2 (ab) off the eastern coast of Trinidad and Tobago.
The Caribbean island’s Director of Resource Management Helena Innis-King said she also expects a production-sharing contract
(PSC) to be signed with Tullow Oil for the Guayaguayare shallow
and Guayaguayare deep Blocks.
The three blocks are near BP PLC’s 163,000 b/d oil fields, which
were discovered in the early 1970s, and not far from most of the
country’s gas reserves.
Innis-King said failure to sign the PSCs more than 2 years after
the blocks were first put out for bids was due to several factors,
including the creation of new terms for PSCs and the fact that some
bids did not meet the ministry’s expectations.
She explained, “I know it has taken longer than it should have,
but the reality is that we were kept back because we were dealing
with many issues, including local content, but I expect we will
agree to production-sharing contracts by the end of the year.”
Innis-King also revealed that the merger of Statoil and Norsk
Hydro ASA delayed negotiations with then-Statoil for a PSC in Trinidad’s ultradeep water. ✦

Production

BHP brings Stybarrow project on stream
BHP Billiton Ltd. has begun production, ahead of schedule,
from the Stybarrow development on Block WA-32-L in the Exmouth subbasin 65 km off Western Australia’s North West Shelf.
The $760 million development initially was expected to start up
in early 2008.
Stybarrow lies in some 825 m of water, making it Australia’s
deepest offshore development. It contains nine subsea wells that are
connected to the 80,000 b/d Stybarrow Venture floating produc-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

tion, storage, and offloading vessel. Oil is produced from Eskdale
field via a single well tie-back to Stybarrow field. This will be followed by production from adjacent wells in the field. Production is
expected to ramp up to full flow during the next few months.
Eskdale and Stybarrow fields were discovered in February 2003
and have estimated to have total recoverable reserves of 60-90 million bbl, with a field life of 10 years.

form in Corvina field on Block Z-1 off northwestern Peru (OGJ,
Nov. 5, 2007, Newsletter).
First production came from the CX11-21XD well, which
reached a stabilized rate of 2,500 b/d of oil. The 21XD well was
shut in after the first of two leased tankers was filled with 5,000
bbl of oil to allow the company to finish the dual completion of
the CX11-14D well.
The 14D well, which has an expected maximum design throughput of 28 MMcfd of gas, flowed at a stabilized rate of 1,900 b/d
through its oil tubing, producing 5,000 bbl into the second tanker.
No formation water was detected in either well.
The two Navy tankers will deliver this first 10,000 bbl of Corvina oil to a recently refurbished 40,000 bbl transport barge moored
adjacent to Petroperu’s 62,000 b/d Talara refinery 70 miles south
of the field. Once the transport barge is filled to near capacity, the
oil will be off-loaded into the refinery.
The company expects to achieve average oil production rates of
up to 2,500 b/d.
Production is expected to increase to 4,000 b/d by yearend or
early next year when a 40,000 bbl floating production, storage,
and offloading vessel is in service.
BPZ plans to bring the next well, CX11-18D, on line in the first
quarter of 2008.

Juanambu discovery on stream in Colombia
Gran Tierra Energy has placed the Juanambu-1 discovery well
on production on the Guayuyaco Block in the Putumayo basin of
southern Colombia, said partner Solana Resources Ltd. Both companies are based in Calgary.
Juanambu was discovered and tested in the first half of this year

Processing
Argentina to hike taxes on oil, products exports
Argentina plans to increase taxes on exported oil and refined
products to keep domestic prices at below-market levels, according
to a statement issued by the ministry of planning.
In the statement, Minister of the Economy Miguel Peirano said
that when prices rise on international markets, taxes are an instrument the government can use to guarantee prices on the internal market. The government did not issue specific details of the
planned tax increases.

Foreign-owned reﬁnery licensed in Vietnam

(OGJ Online, Aug. 28, 2007). It is currently producing about 1,400
b/d of oil, 450 b/d net to Solana.
State-owned Ecopetrol recently approved Juanambu field commercial and exercised an option to back in for a 30% interest. Gran
Tierra and Solana each will retain a 35% interest in the field.
Meanwhile, on the Catguas Block in northeastern Colombia,
operator and 100% interest holder Solana on Nov. 16 spudded the
Cocodrilo-1 well, which is expected to take 3 weeks to drill.
Cocodrilo-1 targets the Eocene Barco and Paleocene Catatumbo
formations, which are oil-bearing in the Solana’s nearby Tres Curvas-1 new field discovery (OGJ Online, Sept. 17, 2007).

Sakhalin Energy shuts in oil at Vityaz complex
Production of 80,000 b/d of oil has been suspended from the
Vityaz complex off northeastern Sakhalin Island because of turbulent weather, Sakhalin Energy Investment Co. (SEIC) said Nov.
26. It also has stopped using the Okha floating storage and offtake
vessel.
“While preparing to reconnect the Okha over this weekend it
became apparent that the single-anchor leg mooring (SALM) buoy
at the Vityaz complex has suffered damage. The cause of the damage is being investigated,” SEIC added. “Oil spill response and other
vessels are at the scene to avoid the chance of further release of
oil.”
A company spokesman told OGJ it would be impossible to predict when the weather would become calm. He added that SEIC
estimates that less than 10 l. of oil had escaped into the sea because
of damage to the SALM. “Before [the investigation] is concluded, it
is hard to say when it will be repaired.”
Oil production from Vityaz is usually shut in from mid-December until early May or June because of ice. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
Meanwhile, a $3.7 billion project to build the Long Son refinery complex in southern Ba Ria Vung Tau Province is awaiting
an investment license, according to the Vietnam Oil & Gas Group
(Petrovietnam).
Nguyen Viet Son, director of Petrovietnam’s Oil Processing Department, said his group and the Vietnam Chemical Corp. will contribute 29% of the total investment. The remaining 71% will be
provided by two Thai partners, Siam Cement Group and Thailand
Plastic Co. If licensed, the first phase of the project is scheduled for
completion in 2011 and the whole project in 2013.
Petrovietnam plans to build three refineries with combined capacities of 20 million tonnes/year, two in central Thanh Hoa and
Quang Ngai Provinces and one in southern Ba Ria Vung Tau Province. Vietnam imported nearly 10.4 million tonnes of petroleum
products in the first 10 months of 2007, 12.1% over the comparable 2006 period, according to the General Statistics Office.

Vietnam’s central Phu Yen Province has licensed a joint venture
of the UK’s Techno Star Management (51%) and Russia’s Telloil
(49%) to build a 4 million tonne/year refinery.
Capitalized at more than 27,480 billion Vietnamese dong ($1.7
billion), the Vung Ro refinery in the province’s Dong Hoa district
will be the country’s first wholly foreign-owned refinery.
An official from the Phu Yen Planning and Investment Depart- Suncor’s Sarnia plant upgrade nears completion
Suncor Energy Inc. said the final phase of a 3-year upgrade projment said the Vung Ro refinery should become operational in
2012, when Vietnam’s demand for petroleum products will surge ect at its 70,000 b/cd refinery in Sarnia, Ont., is almost complete.
The final phase involved a 3-month shutdown of certain units
to an estimated 20 million tonnes/year from 12.5 million tonnes
to facilitate tie-in of new facilities. The company said the refinery
in 2006.

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Steady ﬂow may be near for Colombia’s Rubiales
Petro Rubiales Energy Corp., Vancouver, BC, said it plans to
truck Rubiales field crude to Guaduas field in Colombia for export
via the OCENSA pipeline, gradually ending local sales of the heavy
oil and as much as doubling netbacks eventually.
Once it reaches Guaduas, the 12.5° gravity Rubiales crude will
be blended with crude as light as 18° gravity and the diluted blend
will be shipped via the pipeline to the Covenas terminal on the
Caribbean Sea as part of the Vasconia stream.
Volumes of as much as 4,000 b/d are to be trucked shortly.
New Guaduas unloading facilities expected to be available at the
end of first quarter 2008 are to be able to handle 20,000 b/d.
Shipments are expected to grow later to 200,000 b/d with
construction of a pipeline to eliminate the trucking. The line is
expected to begin service in third quarter 2009.
Petro Rubiales, which said it plans to expand production capacity at Rubiales field to 126,000 b/d from 24,000 b/d, has announced a plan to merge with Pacific Stratus Energy Ltd., Toronto,
which owns the tank farm at Guaduas field on the Caguan Block
(OGJ Online, Nov. 13, 2007).

Sinopec, Iran gas supply dispute halts LNG plant
Sinopec has stopped work on an LNG receiving terminal in the
coastal city of Qingdao, in China’s Shandong Province, because it
has been unable to secure sufficient gas supplies following the collapse of a planned agreement with Iran.
The $607 million regasification project—a joint venture of
Sinopec and power firm China Huaneng Group—was to have an
initial capacity of 3 million tonnes/year of LNG, rising to 5 million
tonnes/year during a second phase. Construction was originally
scheduled to start in 2006 and complete in 2007.
China and Iran signed a memorandum of understanding in
2004 for Sinopec to buy 10 million tonnes/year of LNG from Iran
for 25 years, but reports suggest that the two sides have failed to
agree on contract terms. The Iranians reportedly think Sinopec’s
price offer is too low, while Sinopec is said to be concerned that
Iran’s political instability poses investment risks to the project.
Sinopec reportedly is seeking new supply sources in Australia
and is considering changing the location of the proposed plant.
Reports did not say where.

Two Japanese partnerships order LNG carriers
Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) Line has signed partnership agreements with two other Japanese firms for joint ownership of LNG
carriers.
In the first, NYK and Tokyo Gas Co. subsidiary Tokyo LNG Tanker
Co., Ltd., both of Tokyo, signed a joint ownership contract with
Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corp. for construction of a 177,000 cu m
capacity LNG carrier. The companies also signed a heads of agree10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

ment for joint ownership and a long-term charter for the carrier.
NYK Line will hold a 90% stake in the ship, while Tokyo LNG
will hold the remaining 10%. NYK Line also was appointed ship
manager under the 20 year-term time charter that will start from
2011, when the vessel will be completed.
Construction of the tanker will start in fiscal 2009. The Mosstype carrier will be equipped with four spherical tanks and will
be equipped with a Kawasaki advanced reheat turbine plant for
propulsion, enabling 15% higher fuel efficiency.
After its completion, the ship will transport LNG from the
Northwest Shelf Expansion, Malaysia I and III, the Darwin Project,
Sakhalin-2, Pluto, and Gorgon among others.
The agreement marks the second new carrier that NYK will coown solely with Tokyo LNG Tanker, following a 153,000 cu m capacity carrier planned to be completed in 2009. After completion,
this newbuild carrier will be used in an LNG transportation project
for Tokyo Gas Co. Ltd., said NYK Line.
In another joint ownership deal, NYK and Mitsui raised $700
million through a syndicated loan to cover some 70-80% of the
construction costs for four 145,000 cu m LNG carriers.
Mitsui and NYK will jointly own the four vessels, which are
being built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy
Industries. The first ship will be delivered in 2009, with the others
being delivered in 2010-11.
NYK and Mitsui have already chartered these ships to Taiwan’s
Chinese Petroleum Corp. for 25 years. CPC will use the vessels to
transport 3 million tonnes/year of LNG to Taiwan from Qatar.

TransCanada applies for pipeline expansion
TransCanada Corp. has requested approval from Alberta regulators to construct a 300-km, 42-in. natural gas pipeline on the
northern Alberta system to deliver more gas to oil sands producers.
The Calgary company filed an application Nov. 21 with the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board for a construction permit for the
800 MMcfd capacity line. The estimated capital cost of this expansion is $983 million (Can.). The expansion, called the North Central Corridor pipeline project, is intended to address anticipated
increased gas demand, resulting largely from increased oil sands
development, TransCanada said.
The proposed pipeline would connect the northwestern Alberta system at the existing Meikle River compressor station to the
northeast portion of the system at the existing Woodenhouse compressor station.
Construction is anticipated to begin in late 2008.
The first segment of the pipeline is expected to be completed in April 2009. TransCanada anticipates completing the second
segment and putting it in service in April 2010, the company
said. ✦

Upward price bias
This is in response to your editorial,
“The curse of $95 oil” (OGJ, Nov. 12,
2007, p. 17).
The headline article in a recent Wall
Street Journal (Nov. 19, 2007) was: “Oil
Officials See Limit Looming on Production” (Russell Gold and Ann Davis).
ExxonMobil has forecast a peak in
non-OPEC crude production by about
2010, after which only OPEC nations
will be able to increase supply to meet
relentlessly increasing demand from
the 1.3 billion people in China and the
1 billion people in India, among other
places. OPEC has done its own study and
also projects a peak in non-OPEC crude
production in the near future. Like it or
not, we are about to enter a new world,
where “the era of easy oil is over,” as
Chevron has termed it in one of its advertisements.
There will certainly be large fluctuations in the price of oil in this era, but
with a strong upward bias. OPEC producers are fully aware of how valuable
petroleum is to modern industrial societies and are gradually raising prices to
reflect more fully that value. Fortunately,
we have many ways in which to cope in
this new world, primarily by beginning
to take energy efficiency and conservation seriously. When US consumers buy
more hybrids than sport utility vehicles,
you will know that the message has
finally hit home.

It’s not easy going green

Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
Panda Ethanol Inc., Dallas, was
granted an air permit for its proposed
ethanol refinery in Muleshoe, Tex., that
is to be fueled by cow manure.
“Unlike other ethanol facilities
which burn natural gas to generate the
steam used in the ethanol manufacturing process, the Muleshoe facility will
be engineered to gasify up to 1 billion lb of cattle manure per year,” said
company officials. By doing so, they
said, “Panda is both conserving the
energy equivalent of 1,000 b/d of oil
and helping to address a significant
environmental problem for the Texas
Panhandle.”
It might also stifle public complaints
about the comparative stench of sour
gas from some Texas fields.
The proposed refinery is designed
to produce 115 million gal/year of
ethanol from 38 million bushels of
feedstock-grade corn.

Ethanol outlook
The recent spike of crude prices
toward $100/bbl “should be positive
for ethanol prices and ethanol producer
stocks because it suggests attractive
discretionary blending economics,”
said Eitan Bernstein of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc., Arlington, Va.
Moreover, he said, “We believe a big
increase in legislated demand is all but
inevitable.”
However, Bernstein reported, “Our
updated supply-demand analysis
strongly suggests that the abundance of

new supply expected to come on line
over the next 12 months will increase
downward pressure on ethanol prices,
producer profits, and valuations.”
US Department of Energy reports
indicate US demand for ethanol surged
to 7.1 billion gal/year in August from
6.3 billion gal/year in April, with most
of the new demand centered in the
Midwest. “This makes sense, given that
it requires the least transportation and
capitalizes on local loyalties, a reminder
that the easiest fruit is typically picked
first. However, for US demand to rise
materially further, ethanol consumption
will have to make substantial gains in
other regions,” Bernstein said.
He expects the US ethanol market to
be “well supplied” next year. “Moreover, with many new plants just starting
production and eagerly looking to sell
their volumes, we expect petroleum
blenders and refiners will have a great
deal of leverage in negotiating low
prices,” Bernstein said.

Green vs. red line
With some advocates pushing to
increase auto mileage to 40 mpg while
car manufacturers hustle sales with
television ads emphasizing speed and
performance, there’s little wonder auto
owners are torn between a desire to be
environmentally green vs. an urge to
put the pedal to the metal.
And then there’s the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing
(NASCAR) in Daytona Beach, Fla.—the
largest motorsports organization in the
US—which annually sanctions more
than 1,500 races at 100 tracks in 39
US states, Canada, and Mexico. Based
on television ratings, auto racing is the
second-most popular professional sport
in the US, behind the National Football
League.

It’s fast, exciting, and entertaining,
and outstanding drivers like Jimmie Johnson, Jeff Gordon, and Dale
Earnhardt Jr. are heroes to millions of
fans. No wonder it feeds “the need
for speed” among many conventional
drivers who choose high performance
engines over slower but more environmentally friendly vehicles.
With US refiners under government
mandate to remove lead and later to
find a substitute for methyl tertiary
butyl ether in reformulated and oxygenated gasoline, NASCAR continued
using lead additives in race cars up until
the Auto Club 500 race in California in
February. It earlier announced plans to
transition to unleaded fuel in the three
main racing divisions it sanctions—the
Nextel Cup, Busch, and Craftsman Truck
series—but not the annual Daytona
500.
These events feature custom-built
race cars that gulp down fuel and average only 2-5 mpg at race speeds. It’s
estimated that some 6,000 gal of fuel
are used at an average weekend Nextel
Cup event. And that’s just on the race
track, not including the thousands
of fans some of whom drive great
distances to attend races. Moreover,
NASCAR remains essentially free of the
federal regulations of the Environmental
Protection Agency, and most of the race
cars have no mufflers or catalytic converters or other emission controls.
But privately owned NASCAR has
been debating environmental issues with
racing partners like Sunoco Inc., the
Philadelphia-based refiner that produces
the official fuel used in NASCAR races.
Although still in the talking phase,
NASCAR says it is looking at the development of alternative fuels for racing cars.
That, said NASCAR officials, should have
“a very small but symbolic impact” on
the fuels market. ✦

Congress and royalties
Braying in Congress about a court decision on
deepwater royalty relief looks more like blameshifting than serious concern for federal revenue.
Forty-three senators have sent US President
George W. Bush a letter asking what his administration will do about royalty revenue they consider
lost (OGJ, Nov. 26, 2007, p. 29). He might start
by asking senators and representatives to get their
facts straight and learn how to write law.
The oil industry has reason to encourage such
an effort. Congress is blaming it, too, for a problem that stems—if it really exists—from legislative
ineptitude.

intended production amounts to be the only limit

At the beginning of the 1990s all
producing countries in Latin America
permitted limited participation of the
private sector in the oil and gas industry. The general rule was that the
participation was through some form
of association with the state-owned
oil company with the outside investor
bearing all exploration risk. The fiscal
regime consisted either of service fees

and taxes or of profit oil and taxes.
As the decade progressed, all those
countries, to varying degrees, introduced policy or legal reforms to allow
more private sector participation in the
industry. Privatization and deregulation
were in vogue. Some countries went as
far as dismantling or selling off their

maintained the mandatory association
with the state companies but increased
the opportunity for participation of the
private sector. The only country that was
and has remained closed is Mexico.
A few countries have stayed the
course, notably Brazil, Colombia, and
Peru; in the other countries those new
policies didn’t last long. Some have
made a U-turn and become more
restrictive than they were at the beginning of the 1990s. “Resource nationalism” has replaced privatization and deregulation. This article provides a short
country-by-country review of what has
transpired in Latin America in the last
10-15 years.

Argentina

The Argentine state controlled all
segments of the oil and gas industry
and all public services prior to 1990.
The state-owned Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales SA (YPF) had the monopoly
of the oil industry. Private companies
could conduct exploration and production (E&P) only pursuant

production, transmission, and distribution also were privatized and deregulated. All through the 1990s oil and gas
companies in Argentina had the right
to market freely internally or export all
hydrocarbon production at unregulated
prices.
The Argentine industry thus attracted
billions of dollars in investment in
exploration, development, and infrastructure, fueled by both domestic demand growth and demand for exports
of electricity and natural gas. But this
ended with the economic and currency
crisis at the end of 2001. Since then the
Argentine oil industry began to experience changes. The government made
the private sector shoulder the economic burden of policies designed to
curry popular favor and to control inflation. Domestic prices were reregulated,
and exports were curtailed and taxed.
The result has been a steady decline in
exploration investment. Price controls
encourage record high consumption at
the same time that the country now has
known gas reserves only for the next 10
years. Oil, gas, and electric production
and transportation are operating at their
limits. There are fuel and power shortages throughout the country.
The policy responses to this energy
crisis in Argentina are not meaningful so far. The production cannon has
recently been raised to $1,088/sq km
of land used for crude oil or natural gas
production. Relaxation of price controls
has been limited. The government has
created again a state-owned oil company, Energía Argentina Sociedad Anónima
(Enarsa). Fiscal incentives for E&P
activities are available only to those who
agree to associate with Enarsa. Lacking
capital, Enarsa must be carried through
the exploration phase.
The government is using Enarsa to
import gas from Bolivia in order to
make up domestic shortfalls. Bolivia
sells its gas at a price higher than the
regulated price in Argentina. The difference so far is being made up by squeezing more taxes from the dwindling
exports to Chile. Once the goose that
lays those golden eggs is finally dead,

in the country only through associations with YPFB. The 1996 hydrocarbons law allowed private companies to
come in on a stand-alone basis under
a tax and royalty regime. Companies
became entitled to own and freely
dispose of all hydrocarbon production
upon commercial discovery. Under this
law major international oil companies
such as Total SA, BG Group PLC, BP PLC,
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), and
Repsol YPF SA entered the country and
investment in hydrocarbons surged.
Within a new framework conducive to
investment in exploration and infrastructure, Brazil signed up to buy

Argentina, selling it fuels, and buying
its bonds. Will Argentina go back to

private sector as in the 1990s or walk

We’ll know soon; the current situation
is critical and can’t last long.

dum was held in which the majority
of Bolivian nationals voted in favor of
recovering for the state full control over
hydrocarbon resources.
In 2005 congress approved a new
hydrocarbons law that repealed the
1996 law. The new law reconstituted
YPFB and radically changed the framework for the industry but lay dormant
until Juan Evo Morales Ayma took office as president of Bolivia a year later.
Morales was leader of both the Movement for Socialism political party and
of Bolivia’s cocalero movement resisting
US efforts to eradicate coca crops
in that country. Having promised
his constituency that the hydrocarbon wealth of the country would
effectively go back to the people,
Morales issued on May 1, 2006, a
decree nationalizing the industry
and setting a 180-day deadline for
companies to convert their contracts to the new contract regime
provided by the 2005 hydrocarbons
law or to surrender their operations
to YPFB. The new contract regime is
that of the “operating contract,” under
which all production belongs to the
state and the contractor has the obligation to deliver to YPFB all the hydrocarbons produced. All the oil companies
operating in Bolivia under the 1996
law have now converted to operations
contracts under the 2005 law. Another
type of contract permitted by the 2005
law is the joint venture or association
contract under which YPFB must have
a minimum 51% participation. Reportedly, the first association would be with
Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), the
Venezuelan national oil company.
The operations contract is a sort of
service contract with YPFB whereby
the contractor undertakes to conduct
petroleum operations at its sole risk and
expense, assuming all costs and providing all required personnel, technology, facilities, materials, and capital
in exchange for the reimbursement
of certain costs and a fee. YPFB does
not assume any risk or liability for the
petroleum operations or its results. The
production is sold by YPFB as agreed
22

by YPFB. Proceeds from production
are divided as follows: first, royalties
at the rate of 18% and a direct tax on
hydrocarbons of 32% come off the top,
then the contractor is reimbursed for
the contractually recoverable costs. A
portion of the remaining proceeds is
the contractor’s fee, subject to Bolivian
income taxes.
Contractors are currently submitting
their work programs and development
and investment plans to YPFB for approval under the new contracts. Morales
has warned the companies that if they
SPECIAL

New Latin American
Energy Regimes

fail to meet their investment obligations, the operations contracts will be
rescinded without compensation.
Bolivia soon must deliver the maximum gas export volumes contracted
with Brazil. It also is exporting gas
to Argentina under a contract which
requires a large volume ramp up in a
few short years. Domestic demand is
surging. To meet domestic requirements
and export commitments Bolivia needs
several billion dollars in investment in
exploration, production, and transportation infrastructure—$3 billion to almost double current production in the
next 4-5 years, by some estimates. YPFB
does not have the required economic
and technical capacity. The private sector has not exactly been nurtured lately
to meet this challenge. Bolivia, despite
having the second largest gas reserves
of the region, thus has international
contractual problems to go with neverending political instability and social
unrest. Enter Venezuela again to support
a state with investments in replacement
of the private sector.

Brazil
Brazil successfully continues on the
course charted at the time of its energy
reforms in the late 1990s. The Petrobras
monopoly over the industry was broken
up via a constitutional amendment in
1995, and by 1997 Brazil put in place
regulatory bodies and agencies to govern equally the activities of foreign and
Brazilian oil companies, state-controlled
Petrobras included. E&P blocks are
awarded competitively. Contracts grant
E&P rights under a tax and royalty fiscal
regime with the average royalty rate being 10%. By the end of 2007 there
will have been nine international
bid rounds. The energy policy
and fiscal regime instituted by the
Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration have been maintained
stable by current socialist President
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, formerly
a labor leader and organizer of the
Workers Party.
Brazil is the tenth largest energy
consumer in the world and the
largest in Latin America. Brazil is the
fifth-largest country by geographical
area, the fifth most populous country,
and the fourth most populous democracy in the world. It is the world’s eighth
largest economy in terms of purchasing
power. Between its local oil production
and its leading production of sugarbased ethanol, Brazil is self sufficient
in liquid fuels. It is on the natural gas
front that things remain challenging.
Strong economic growth, together with
a sensible policy of avoiding overreliance on hydropower for electric generation, require that Brazil find long term,
reliable, and ever growing sources of
natural gas supply.
There are three such sources. The
first one is local production, but most
scenarios show that in the short to
medium term it is not going to be near
enough to satisfy projected demand.
The second source is imported gas
from Bolivia. These volumes are limited,
however. Bolivia attempted unilaterally
to renegotiate the price Brazil pays for
this gas. Additionally, Bolivia nationalized refinery assets of Petrobras and

Chavez dominates Latin American political debate
Jose L.Valera
King & Spalding LLP
Houston
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
wields considerable inﬂuence in Latin
America. Aside from the countries
aligned with policies that he favors and
supports (i.e., Bolivia, Ecuador, and,
to some extent, Nicaragua), Chavez is
directly or indirectly part of the political
debate in other Latin American countries.
Perhaps with the sole exception of
the US president, there is no other
political ﬁgure who is as well known
and whose policies are talked about
as much in the whole region. Chavez
says his aims are to help the poor and
redress inequalities, but what is subject
to debate is the means he proposes to
achieve that end and whether those
means are sustainable over the long
term.

Obstacles ahead
There are two fundamental obstacles
to Chavez’s inﬂuence actually taking
root in a wider area of Latin America.
The ﬁrst is economic: the availability of
cash to pay for the revolution and feed,
clothe, and house the people. Unlike
prior socialist experiments around the
globe, Chavez’s policies could have a
chance of success in Venezuela, at least

forced the conversion of Petrobras’s
E&P contracts into service contracts at
far less favorable terms. Brazil therefore does not view Bolivia as a reliable
source of supply or as a country in
which long-term investments can be
made with confidence. Brazil will continue receiving gas from Bolivia under
the current contract but will not seek to
increase volumes or to extend its term.
Bolivia’s populist energy policy is going
to cost it its biggest costumer.
The third source is LNG. Petrobras is
currently developing two LNG terminal
24

in the short term, given the massive
amounts of cash easily available to
his administration from the export of
oil and the increasing global demand
for that resource. Monopolizing oil
revenue allows for the payment of
subsidies in housing, food, health care,
and energy and makes up for declining
domestic productivity in Venezuela.
Unemployment can be masked by
inﬂating the payroll of stateowned enterprises as needed.
Chavez may assume total political
control, monopolize all major
industries, and take away the
independent means for citizens
to create wealth because there is
state cash available to the president without any controls to pay
for the subsistence of citizens.
There are politicians in other
countries who would not hesitate to adopt the Chavez model,
if they could. Bolivia illustrates this
point. President Evo Morales thought
that because Bolivia had large natural
gas resources it was automatically a
wealthy country and proceeded upon
his election to dictate new terms to
foreign investors (on a take-it-or-leaveit basis) while declaring that the natural
gas was going to help to develop
Bolivia and improve the condition of
the poor.

projects and is talking about a third. For
Brazil, LNG is the only real solution to
long-term reliable gas supply to supplement domestic production. The interconnection with Argentina and Bolivia
never translated into real integration.
The policies in these countries are devised for short-term political gain and
are too disparate with that of Brazil’s.
The conditions for true integration do
not exist.

Colombia
Colombia has followed and success-

Unfortunately for Morales, it is not
playing out that way. With the private
sector in (chased) retreat, Bolivia has
no capacity to make the necessary investments to expand production infrastructure and to generate the revenues
required to pay for the subsistence of
the people.
Unlike oil, natural gas is not a readily marketable global commodity. With
no cash, Bolivia’s Chavez-like experiment is imploding. Shortages of fuels

are seriously affecting other industries,
especially agriculture. Inﬂation looms
behind the shortages. Chavez is offering to step in with the needed investments and cash, but he can’t spread
himself too thin given that Ecuador is
positioning itself to be next in needing
this type of foreign assistance. Some
politicians prone to this policy approach in other countries are watching
this and putting their instincts on hold.
The second obstacle is political:

fully maintained a policy similar to that
of Brazil. Up to 2003, private sector
companies could operate in the country only through production-sharing
agreements with state-owned Ecopetrol
SA. Now private sector companies can
obtain E&P rights directly through the
Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos
(ANH). The fiscal regime is one of tax
and royalty. Ecopetrol has been stripped
of any regulatory and policy roles, and
it operates along side other companies under the same rules and contract
terms. The government has sold a miOil & Gas Journal / Dec. 3, 2007

some people just make different choices. Chavez’s inﬂuence has had intrinsic
limits when tested at some elections
against well-presented alternatives.
Almost every single country in Latin
America has had presidential elections
in the last 24 months. In most of those
elections Chavez and his policies were
a factor.
Some of the candidates supported
by him made it to the runoff elections.
But more often than not, alternative
policy models were voted for. Mexico
and Peru clearly illustrate this different
choice, where candidates proposing
Chavez-type policies lost.

High political risks
Elections, however, will take place
again. One can be fairly conﬁdent that
a Chavez-like candidate is unlikely to
win the presidency in a country like
Chile, which seems to have consolidated a system based on a pluralistic
democracy, the rule of law, and a market economy. Yet the fact remains that
in many other countries such an event
may still happen.
Only time will tell whether those
countries that rejected a Chavez-like
candidate in the last round of elections
will do so in the next. In this sense,
while in the short term a number of
countries remain committed to open
and free economies, the political risk
long term is still somewhat high.

nority interest in Ecopetrol in the local
stock market.
Colombia is benefiting from better
internal security and legal stability. After
the reelection of President Álvaro Uribe
Vélez for a second 4-year term in May
2006 [making him the first president to
be consecutively re-elected in Colombia in more than 100 years], the local
economy has continued growing steadily, and foreign direct investment in
hydrocarbons is soaring, having reached
the record level of $1.8 billion in 2006
and $582.6 million in the first quarter

of 2007. In its fourth year of activities
as a licensing entity, ANH has proven
that the new fiscal regime and model
contract are effective tools to attract
new foreign investment. Such new fiscal
regime includes royalties on production of 8-25% for crude oil, 6.4-20%
for onshore and offshore natural gas to
1,000 ft depth, and 4.8-15% for offshore gas at greater depths. There also is
a windfall profits payment to ANH that
applies when the accumulated production exceeds a certain volume and the
price exceeds a predetermined benchmark. Colombia has among the most
competitive terms in Latin America,
having signed a total of 105 new E&P
contracts as of Aug. 31.
Colombia’s oil reserves, production,
and exports have been declining for
years, and the government is determined to arrest this trend before the
country becomes a net oil importer.
New policies in dealing with the guerrillas are resulting in fewer reported
attacks on production and transportation facilities. The kidnapping count
also is down. As a whole, the investment
climate for oil and gas companies in
Colombia is better now than it has been
in recent memory.

Ecuador
Ecuador has maintained the dominant role of state-owned Empresa
Estatal Petróleos del Ecuador (Petroecuador). Companies operate there
through production-sharing contracts
with Petroecuador. The fiscal regime
is one of profit oil and tax. Up until a
few years ago the government intended
to reform the role of Petroecuador,
simplify E&P contracting, and improve
the fiscal regime. Those initiatives never
materialized, as they were routinely
blocked and boycotted by nationalist
and populist politicians, indigenous
groups, the military, environmentalists,
labor unions, and other interest groups.
Private companies have been involved
in tax and environmental disputes and
contract cancellations.
The bad news became worse recently
with the announcement by President

Rafael Vicente Correa Delgado that the
windfall profits tax rate was going to
be increased to 99%, on the basis of oil
revenues from sales at prices exceeding
those in effect at the time the original
contracts were signed. This tax was created with a 50% rate in early 2006. “We
are not going to be cheated again,” said
President Correa, an economist who
previously served as finance minister.
This comes at a time when Ecuador
exports crude oil and imports almost all
the oil products it uses and is looking
at having to import natural gas from
Colombia and Peru.
Ecuador recently elected members
of an assembly that will rewrite the
constitution. Allies of the president won
a majority. The stated aims include having a new framework to increase social
spending, strengthen the government’s
control over natural resources, and
reform property rights.
It is not expected that Ecuador will
become closed to foreign investment,
but the government is expected to turn
existing contracts into service contracts
through which companies would be
paid a production fee and reimbursed
for investment costs. All production
would be owned by the state. Similar
to Bolivia, Ecuador is not creating the
conditions necessary to have the private
sector contribute to meeting its challenges. But although he and Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez are friends,
Correa has said he is not part of the
Venezuela-Bolivia movement. PDVSA
has said that it will build a refinery in
Ecuador and invest in exploration there.

Mexico
Mexico remains closed. It is illegal
for private companies to risk investment capital in the oil and gas business
in Mexico. The state monopolizes all
segments of the industry and operates
through Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX).
This monopoly is maintained in the
face of declining oil reserves, soonto-occur declining oil production and
export revenues, inadequate capital
investment in infrastructure, and continued increases in domestic demand

of Petroperu’s assets and the passage
of the hydrocarbons law of 1993. This
law created an independent licensing
agency, Perupetro, which grants E&P
rights to private companies under a tax
and royalty regime with royalty rates
of 5-20% based on production levels.
Peru has had remarkable policy continuity and stability through succeeding
presidents since then. The country has
made a genuine effort to improve the
terms and conditions offered to oil
companies and to provide incentives
for investment. These include alternative methods for calculating royalties,
free sharing of technical information,
reimbursement of sales taxes incurred
during the exploration period, accelerated bidding procedures, etc. The result
has been a noticeable revival of interest

objective of these contracts was to grant
operating rights over marginal fields

the contractor with a cash fee per barrel

In practice these contracts did not impede exploration.
After President Chavez first took office in December 1998, several energy
policy changes have taken place in
Venezuela. He started by raising taxes
and royalties, then decided to alter
fundamentally the contract regime. All
private sector companies had to convert
their contracts into joint ventures with
PDVSA, with PDVSA taking more than
50% participating interest. This was
done under threat of total nationalization. Most companies complied, but a
few did not. Those that did not are no

The oil E&P framework today in
Venezuela is that of a joint-venture
company with PDVSA, where PDVSA

PDVSA. The joint ventures pay taxes and
royalties. ✦

US House chair asks EPA about groundwater agreement
Nick Snow
Washington Editor

to determine whether they were continuing to comply with the MOA 2 days
before the hearing. Only Halliburton
responded by Oct. 30 when EPA submitted Grumbles’s written testimony to
the committee. The other two arrived
at EPA the morning of the hearing, the
lawmaker said.
“Your testimony also states that ‘the
three companies . . . have converted to
nondiesel fluids.’ Of the three responding companies, however, only BJ Services explicitly states that diesel fuel is
no longer used. This is relevant because
a company can be in compliance with
the MOA and still use diesel fuel as a
fracturing fluid,” Waxman continued.
In his Oct. 31 appearance before the
committee, Grumbles said the three
service companies voluntarily agreed to
quit using diesel fuel in their fracturing
fluids in 2004 after a study by EPA, the
US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey, and several states found that
diesel posed the only significant health
risk in coalbed methane fracturing
operations. The 2005 Energy Policy Act
specifically exempted hydraulic fracking
of CBM from regulation under the Safe
Drinking Water Act as long as diesel fuel
was not used, the EPA official added.

A US House committee chairman
raised new questions about whether
the Environmental Protection Agency is
effectively monitoring a 2003 memorandum of agreement intended to
eliminate injection of diesel fuel into
underground drinking water.
Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), chairman of the Oversight and Government
Reform Committee, said that Benjamin
H. Grumbles, EPA’s assistant administrator for water, described the MOA
between EPA and the three biggest US
oil field service companies during a
hearing by the committee on Oct. 31.
“This MOA, which appears unenforceable, had been executed to address
EPA’s concerns that benzene, toluene,
ethyl benzene, and xylene (the BTEX
compounds) were being introduced
into underground sources of drinking water during hydraulic fracturing
activities,” Waxman wrote in a Nov. 26
letter to Grumbles.
He said written testimony submitted by Grumbles said the companies
(BJ Services Co., Halliburton Energy
Services Inc., and Schlumberger Technology Corp.) “have certified in written
reports that they have converted to non- ‘Less than impressive’
Waxman said Grumbles “assured the
diesel fluids and are in full compliance
with the MOA.” Grumbles also testified Congress and the public that the 2003
MOA was being actively monitored and
orally that EPA “was monitoring to see
if the three signatories were living up to
that agreement” on “an annual basis,”
according to Waxman.

‘Informal e-mails’
“Contrary to your testimony, however, the documents EPA has provided
to the committee to support your
testimony are not certified statements
of compliance. Rather, they are three
informal e-mails from the companies,”
he wrote in his letter to Grumbles.
Waxman said the e-mail messages
show that EPA contacted the companies

complied with. But the basis of your
statement appears to be less than impressive: a hastily collected set of three
e-mails amounting to just half a dozen
sentences.
If EPA has a solid basis for its assurances that these companies are not
using diesel fuel when fracturing oil
and gas wells, please provide it to the
committee,” he told the EPA official. He
requested a response by Dec. 16.
He also wrote letters to chief executives J.W. Stewart of BJ Services, David
J. Lesar of Halliburton Co., and Andrew
Gould of Schlumberger Ltd. requesting documents showing the number
of wells the company hydraulically
fractured in each state in 2005, 2006,
and 2007; the identity and total volume
of chemicals and other products used
in such operations; the percentage of
products recovered from such operations if available; and any documents
related to the products’ environmental
effects by Dec. 17.
Waxman also wrote a letter to Randy
Eresman, president and chief executive
of Encana Corp. in Calgary, requesting
the same information he sought from
the service companies by the same
deadline. The independent producer
was mentioned during the committee’s
Oct. 31 hearing, where some witnesses

UK’s HSE criticizes North Sea energy structure
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
More than half of the oil and gas
industry’s basic assets in the UK North
Sea that have been inspected over the
past 3 years are in poor condition, and
companies will face closure or prosecution if they do not improve safety

standards, warned the UK Health and
Safety Executive (HSE) in a report.
After inspecting almost 100 oil and
gas platforms, HSE said various safetyrelated incidents had occurred because
of the poor upkeep of basic structures,
and that some maintenance backlogs
were “unacceptable.”
In the KP3 report, which investigated

Distant events,
local impacts

T

estimony at a US Senate subcommittee hearing in North Dakota
took a close look at how local markets can feel the impacts of seemingly
distant events.
US Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND),
who chairs the Appropriations Committee’s Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, held the hearing
in Bismarck to examine gasoline and
diesel shortages in upper Great Plains
states this summer and fall. Officials
from area refiners, a pipeline, and
two petroleum marketer associations
testified.
So did Howard Gruenspecht,
deputy administrator of the US
Energy Information Administration.
North Dakota, he observed, receives
oil products through the NuStar
and Magellan pipelines and from
northern refineries such as Tesoro’s
plant in Mandan, ND, and Cenex’s
in Laurel, Mont. Several refineries
that serve the state experienced outages, both planned and unplanned.
“The Coffeyville refinery in Kansas
that flooded this past summer feeds
directly into the Magellan system,”
Gruenspecht said.

Pull on supply
Refinery outages elsewhere also
had an impact. Some of the biggest,
such as at BP PLC’s 400,000-b/d
Whiting, Ind., plant, increased pressure for products from upper Midwest refineries. But competition also
grew for supplies from Explorer and
other pipelines from the Gulf Coast.
“This pull on supply competes with
volumes that might otherwise move
further west,” Gruenspecht said.
Planned outages can be less
disruptive but still limit supplies,
28

he added. While a refiner planning
maintenance usually lines up supplies from other sources to meet
contractual needs, it might not
include noncontract or spot purchasers. A planned outage also might take
longer because problems are found
when maintenance begins, forcing
a refiner to buy more spot market
products for contract customers, according to Gruenspecht.
“During times such as were seen
this past summer, the federal and state
governments looked at options to
relieve the situation,” he said. “At the
end of August, the federal government
granted North Dakota’s request for a
waiver to use some gasoline supplies
from Canada that were thought to be
slightly ‘off-spec’ from US summer
gasoline requirements. Still, gasoline
supplies remained tight.”

No diesel waiver
Meanwhile, diesel prices started to
rise from growing harvest demand.
Gruenspecht said he understood
federal and state officials discussed
distillate fuel supply and decided not
to provide a waiver because supplies
were not available.
Terminal outages also made truck
drivers travel greater distances to find
oil products, he said. North Dakota
and other affected states issued executive orders approved by the Federal
Motor Carrier Safety Administration
to extend service hours for fuel supply truck drivers.
“Refineries are returning to more
normal operations, which will ease
the tight balance in North Dakota,
but we cannot predict exactly when
the problems will cease,” Gruenspecht said. ✦

the safety and integrity of offshore
installations and their equipment, HSE
noted that the sector had made some
improvements in its safety record but
stressed that “more must be done.”
Health and Safety Commission Chair,
Judith Hackitt said: “In the light of the
findings from the KP3 report, asset
integrity will continue to be one of
the main priorities for HSE’s offshore
division in 2008 and for the foreseeable
future, but it must also be clear that it is
for the industry itself to show leadership and face up to its responsibility.”
No companies were named in the
report, but she said HSE would “name
and shame” if necessary.
The criticisms followed comments
by trade unions, which argued that
some operators jeopardize their workforce’s safety. Royal Dutch Shell PLC
has been given several HSE “improvement notices” in recent years, and
it has suffered strong criticism from
its staff about safety. However, Shell
stressed that safety is a priority in its
operations.
Ian Whewell, Head of HSE’s offshore
division, recommended that companies
coordinate activities across the board
to prevent safety incidents. “The report
identified that significant improvements
in the sector could be achieved without
major capital expenditure but through
better planning, improved training,
and clear statements of performance
standards in testing and maintenance
routines,” said Whewell.
Oil and Gas UK, which represents
the industry, welcomed the report, saying it would work closer with HSE to
ensure that good practices are learned.
The industry has spent £3 billion on
asset integrity. Malcolm Webb, chief
executive of Oil and Gas UK said the
publication of the KP3 report “will
help us sharpen our industry’s focus on
those areas that require greater attention
and help steer our on-going industry
initiatives.”
But David Smith, vice-president,
energy sector, with Celerant Consulting,
an operational advisory firm, warned
that unless asset integrity was viewed as

key to profitability, it would be difficult
to see any significant improvements in
the industry’s safety record.
“Assets that demonstrate high levels
of integrity are more productive, and
more consistently productive, over

time,” he said. According to Celerant,
many companies collect too much or
inappropriate data, which prevents
senior and middle management from
truly understanding their operational
picture.

Earlier this year at Offshore Europe,
Whewell accused many companies of
being dismissive of their safety representatives on offshore platforms as an
unnecessary regulatory burden. ✦

Corruption lurks
in Brazil’s waters

B

razilian Defense Minster Nelson
Jobim claims that an oil discovery off Brazil underlines the need
for his country to develop a nuclear
submarine for protection.
“When you have a large natural
source of wealth discovered in the
Atlantic, it’s obvious you need the
means to protect it,” Jobim said. But
lost production at Brazil’s platforms
has recently cost more than any attack that would require a nuclear
submarine.
That’s clear to anyone who follows
the news about Brazil these days. The
real enemy is not lurking offshore.
The real enemy appears to be well
ensconced in onshore boardrooms.
Evidence of that emerged recently
when Brazil’s Federal Audit Court,
better known as TCU, halted the payment of $182 million by state-run
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) to
two local shipyards.

Petrobras overcharged?
The payments were the remainder
of the construction cost for the P-52
and P-54 oil platforms that Petrobras
is about to take on stream just off
Brazil’s coast in coming weeks.
The court halted a $92.2 million
payment to the Keppel Fels shipyard
and an $89.3 million payment to the
Jurong shipyard, arguing it found
signs that Petrobras was being overcharged for the construction of the
two structures.
In June Petrobras had already said
construction costs for the P-52 were
coming in at $1.1 billion, or 20%
over their original budget.
On Nov. 20 Brazilian officials
acknowledged that Petrobras is having problems increasing production
30

in existing fields with new offshore
platforms and floating units.
Average production by Petrobras
during January-September reached
1.796 million b/d, an increase of just
33,000 b/d over the same period
in 2006. This is considerably lower
than the 440,000 b/d of additional
production expected from the new
platforms and floating units purchased over the past 21 months.

Corruption at play?
Petrobras Chief Financial Officer
Almir Barbassa, in a conference call
with investors, admitted that the firm
has problems bringing the new units
to full production and fully exploiting their installed capacity.
“We’re looking for other ways
to make full use of them,” he said,
adding, “It’s part of the process. Some
oil wells respond in a different way
because of the geological structure
of the deposit. We still don’t have the
solution.”
He did not mention the corruption which has hit the country’s
offshore units in the past year—and
hit them hard.
Remember? In July Brazilian
federal police arrested three top
Petrobras executives, along with the
directors of three shipyards—Angraporto Offshore, Maua Jurong, and
IESA—and others for alleged involvement in fixing bids of contracts for
the repair of at least three offshore oil
platforms.
Petrobras said it had suspended its
employees and installed a commission to eliminate immediately any
possible irregularities. Maybe some of
those possible irregularities have yet
to be fully torpedoed. ✦

the EU 27 over the next 25 years to the
“disproportionately” low level of 0.5%/
year, compared with 1.6%/year for the
rest of the world. Data for the forecast
were compiled from industrial sources,
including 30 gas companies of members and also of Switzerland and Turkey,
and from many associated national gas
industry federations.
While the taskforce points to a 34%
energy efficiency improvement to
2030, it indicates that under a number
of different scenarios examined, fossil
energy sources will continue to be the
backbone of Europe’s energy supply.
Eurogas expects the largest increase
in gas consumption will come from
electric power generation at a growth
rate of 2.7%/year. Its share will increase
to 38% of the total 625 million tonnes
of oil equivalent (MMtoe) of gas demand in 2030, up from 28% in 2005.
Volume growth in residential-commercial use will slow to 0.4%/year to 194
MMtoe. In the industrial sector, with
some support from emissions trading,
gas sales will increase by only 1%/year
to 156 MMtoe in 2030.
Gas supply will continue to rely on
long-term contracts despite increasing
short-term agreements. The task force
indicated that the EU gas industry has
already contracted gas deliveries from
regions outside Europe that fully cover
foreseeable demand until 2015, at
which time a “substantial gap emerges
between demand and the supplies from
European production or imported from
outside Europe.”
Demand for additional gas supplies
will jump to 22% in 2020 and to about
39% in 2030—from 10% in 2015.
This is why the European gas industry
is now focusing its gas procurement
on the period after 2015. A huge effort
and substantial investments by suppliers
will be required to mobilize this gas in
time, considering the growing global
gas demand and decreasing indigenous
production in Europe, cautions the task
force, which also points to stiffer competition for supplies on international
markets. ✦

PERSONNEL MOVES AND PROMOTIONS

Pioneer makes several executive appointments
Pioneer Natural Resources Co.,
Dallas, announced three executive
appointments related to continued
expansion of its operations in the US,
South Africa, and Tunisia.
The company has divided executive
responsibility for US operations, naming Jay Still executive vice-president,
domestic operations, a position also
held by Danny Kellum.
Kellum will continue to direct the
asset teams in the Permian, Midcontinent, South Texas, and Mississippi
areas, while Still will assume responsibility for the asset teams in the Rockies, Alaska, and the Barnett shale.
Previously, Still served as Pioneer’s
executive vice-president, western division. He joined the company in 1995
and was appointed head of the western division in September 2004. Prior
to joining Pioneer, Still spent 10 years

enhanced oil recovery projects.
Closing, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected during January. The
combination is subject to approval of at
least two thirds of Canetic unitholders.
Penn West unitholders will own 67%
of the combined trust, and Canetic
unitholders will own 33%.
Terms call for Canetic unitholders
to receive 0.515 of a Penn West unit
for each Canetic unit on a tax-deferred
basis for Canadian and US tax purposes.
Canetic unitholders are scheduled to
receive $15.84/unit for every Canetic
unit based on the closing price of Penn
West units on the Toronto Stock Exchange as of Oct. 30.

Canetic may buy Titan
Titan’s board agreed unanimously to
support the offer. Materials were to be
filed and provided to Titan shareholders
by mid-November.
Canetic said it will acquire produc32

operations, and reservoir engineering
assignments.
Additionally, the company has
promoted David McManus to executive
vice-president, international operations. He joined the Pioneer team in
early 2005 as vice-president, international operations, directing operations
in South Africa and Tunisia. Before
joining Pioneer he served as executive
vice-president with BG Group. He also
served as president of ARCO Europe
and held senior positions with Lasmo

tion of more than 1,800 b/d of oil
equivalent, 63% oil, and a Canetic-estimated 7.3 million boe of proved and
probable reserves.
Canetic also will assume a dominant
position in a strategic Saskatchewan
trend. The acquisition includes more
than 49,000 gross acres in the Leitchville area of Southwest Saskatchewan
near Canetic’s existing 45,100 gross
acres in the Jurassic Lower Shaunavon
trend, where Titan produces more than
900 boe/d.
Canetic said the Leitchville area is an
emerging play with great development
and long-term reserve addition potential.
The acquisition will expand Canetic’s
position in the trend by more than onethird to 300 gross drilling locations.
The Lower Shaunavon trend contains
large reservoirs with pay zones 4-16 m
thick, relatively low permeability, and
22° gravity oil.

Bullard previously was vice-president, engineering and development,
of Pioneer’s operating subsidiary. He
joined the company in 1991 and has
served in various senior capacities,
including as vice-president, Gulf Coast
operations, for Pioneer’s operating
subsidiary. Prior to joining Pioneer, Bullard held engineering and managerial
positions with Conoco Inc. and Damson
Oil Corp.

of significant reserves and production
in the Lower Shaunavon trend,” Canetic
said.
Canetic contemplates drilling four
horizontal wells/sq mile at Leitchville.
The rest of Titan’s production is in
northern Alberta and British Columbia.

that the transaction would not impede
competition in the European Economic
Area (EEA).
KMG produces crude oil and natural
gas in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Azerbaijan, the commission said. KMG has a
single refinery in Kazakhstan and sells
petroleum products mainly in Kazakhstan, Russia, and China. It sells no
products in the EU. It is also active in
the transport of crude oil and natural
gas by pipeline and ships.
Rompetrol, Amsterdam, is a private
refiner and distributor with minor
exploration and production and oil
service operations. Its refining subsidiary Rompetrol Rafinare operates the
96,000 b/d Petromidia refinery north
of Navodari on the Black Sea and the
10,000 b/d Vega refinery at Ploiesti,
both in Romania.
The company also operates a chain
of more than 600 service stations in
Romania, France, Bulgaria, Albania,
Georgia, and Ukraine.
The commission found that the two
parties’ activities in Europe are complementary. “KMG sells no crude oil or
refined petroleum products in the EU,
and Rompetrol sells refined products
but has no production of crude oil or
natural gas,” it said.

Chevron settles bribe charges
Chevron’s kickback payments allegedly occurred in connection with 78
million bbl of oil purchased under the
United Nations’ Oil-for-Food program
from Apr.17, 2001, through May 6,
2002.
The charges were the fifth action
by the agency against a company for
allegedly paying kickbacks under the
program, which was in effect during
1996-2003 to help Iraqis cope with
sanctions imposed after Saddam Hussein’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
“Despite all cargoes purchased by
Chevron having all appropriate US government and United Nations approvals,
the settlement recognizes that certain
third-party merchants from which
Chevron purchased Iraqi crude oil paid
illegal surcharges to the government of
34

Iraq,” Chevron said in a Nov. 14 statement.
SEC said in its complaint that third
parties under contract to Chevron paid
about $20 million directly to Iraqicontrolled bank accounts in Jordan and
Lebanon, bypassing the Oil-for-Food
escrow account. It said Chevron knew,
or should have known, that third parties
were using parts of the premiums they
received from the company’s oil purchases to pay illegal surcharges to Iraq.
Chevron learned of surcharge
demands by Iraq’s State Oil Marketing
Organization in January 2001 and adopted a company-wide policy prohibiting such payments, according to the
complaint filed in US District Court for
the Southern District of New York. The
policy required traders to obtain prior
written approval for proposed Iraqi oil
purchases and charged management
with reviewing each proposed Iraqi oil
deal.
The company said it previously
ceased purchases under the Oil-forFood program in 2000 when rumors
surfaced that third-party suppliers were
paying illegal surcharges. “From the
very beginning, Chevron intended to
comply fully with the trade sanctions
then in force against Iraq and with the
requirements of the Oil-for-Food program,” Chevron said.
It said the US government advised
the company that one former Chevron
crude trader participated in transactions
where he knew or should have known
that surcharges were to be paid by the
third party merchants from which
Chevron bought the crude. “There
are no allegations that Chevron paid
surcharges, and the trader is no longer
affiliated with Chevron,” the company
said in its statement.
SEC, however, alleged that Chevron
failed to devise and maintain a system
of internal accounting controls to detect
and prevent such illicit payments. The
company’s accounting for its Oil-forFood transactions failed to properly
record the true nature of its payments
to third parties, SEC said.
Chevron, which cooperated in this in-

vestigation, neither admitted nor denied
the charges in the settlement. Other investigations of the Oil-for-Food program
are continuing, according to SEC.

Cal Dive settles charges
Cal Dive International Inc. and its
parent, Helix Energy Solutions Group
Inc., agreed to pay $2 million as part of
a settlement to resolve alleged violations of a 2005 consent decree, the US
Department of Justice said on Nov. 26.
DOJ said the Houston marine contractor violated provisions of a decree
mandated when the company acquired
assets from Stolt Offshore Inc. and S&H
Diving LLC. It required the sale of two
saturation diving vessels and another,
separate saturation diving system.
Saturation diving services in the
Gulf of Mexico are used for subsea
construction projects; for inspection,
maintenance, and repair services; and
for recovery and salvage after offshore
structures are damaged by weather or
accident, according to DOJ. By living in
air-tight chambers aboard diving vessels
in which the air pressure equals pressure at the subsea work site, saturation
divers can work for longer periods and
in deeper water than surface divers, it
said.
It said Cal Dive and Stolt were two
of only three major saturation diving
service providers in the Gulf, and the
transaction eliminated Stolt as a competitor and would have given Cal Dive
more than half of the capacity in the
market.
Cal Dive failed to sell the vessels and
diving system promptly and continued to use the Seaway Defender vessel,
profiting from cleanup work following
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, according
to DOJ. Ultimately, a court-appointed
trustee sold the assets after the company
failed to do so within the period specified by the consent decree, it said.
The $2 million payment represents
profits gained as a result of not selling the assets and reimbursement to
DOJ for investigation costs, the federal
department said. ✦

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs
once considered economically and technically impossible. Tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds
now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy. But they’re still
unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them
are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional
reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires continuous rethinking the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 - Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by
editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight
innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and
learn from other professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.

P L O R A T I O N

Companies purchase insurance policies tailored to their needs and asset
portfolio. An operator may purchase a
well control policy to cover well control
cost, redrilling costs, and third party
pollution liabilities, while a company
with a portfolio of assets may retain its
own risk through the establishment of a
captive insurance company.
A mutual insurance company may
be formed by oil companies to underwrite the risk, or a portion of the risk,
of the owner companies. The most
well-known mutual insurance firm is
the Oil Insurance Co., formed in 1971
in response to a shortage in insurance
capacity and high well control premiums.3

Risk modeling
Quantitative models using stochastic
and actuarial processes have been used
for decades in the banking, insurance,
and corporate sectors to estimate the
financial effects of high frequency-low
severity risks and their impact on risk
transfer/retention strategies.
To model the low frequency-high severity risk characteristic of catastrophic
events, it is necessary to develop physical models of the event and the manner
in which the event causes damage and
interacts with infrastructure.

Catastrophic risk models are developed following three stages.5
The first step is the hazard/peril
assessment (Fig. 5). Hazard assessment
defines events by physical characteristics
(severity) and probabilities of occurrence (frequency). The event generation
component is designed to generate realistic storm scenarios in accordance with
their relative probability of occurrence.
The result of hazard/peril modeling
is used in the vulnerability assessment
phase, which estimates the degree of
local/regional damage and the potential
for direct and indirect losses caused to
infrastructure, contents, and operating
activities. The final stage is contract assessment, which determines individual
and portfolio losses based on the terms
of coverage.
To estimate loss in contract assessment, the policy for each asset (with
coverage limits, excess points, policy
limits, etc.) is obtained for well control,
physical damage, business interruption,
loss of hire, and removal of wreck. If
the policy conditions are unknown,

wants to manage its risk profile, it then
monitors its exposures. Exposures are
unlikely to change often, unless the
operator is involved in an extensive
newbuild program, field development,
acquisition activity, or analysis reveals
a significant change in environmental
conditions or perceptions.

with increased demand
for support services, but
market conditions appear to be slowly
reverting to prehurricane conditions.
This article reports on an assessment of trends in plug and abandonment costs in the US Gulf of Mexico
2002-07, based on a sample of 1,156
wells performed by Tetra Applied Technologies LP. It summarizes descriptive
statistics and investigates the impact
of scale economies. In addition, the
article constructs relations that estimate
the cost of P&A activities based on the
number of wells in a job and the number of days of service.
Kaiser and Dodson have described
applicable technologies and procedures and P&A cost statistics from
1999-2001.1
This is the first of two articles updating recent trends in costs of gulf P&A
activities and of net-trawling operations. The concluding article will appear
next week.

ervoirs. At the ends of their useful lives,
wellbores are permanently abandoned
in a process known as plugging and
abandonment. The purpose of P&A is
to prevent migration of fluids from the
wellbore and establish a permanent barrier to the existing geologic formation.
P&A is the first stage of an offshore
decommissioning program in which
tubing, casing strings, and conductors are
cut and
removed

plugs
are set at various depths across former
producing horizons.
The operator designs a P&A operation based on the reservoir and wellbore conditions and applies for regulatory approval. In most states, rules have
evolved over many years with standards
based on experience and conformance
with industry guidelines.2 3 Different
governmental bodies regulate wellbore
abandonment; the body with primary
responsibility depends on the location
of the well. Onshore and in state waters,
county, city, or state government is
responsible for oversight; in the federal
Outer Continental Shelf, the Minerals
Management Service is lead agency.

economic to produce, the well will
often be temporarily abandoned. Wells
on destroyed infrastructure may also
be temporarily abandoned if operators intend to reenter or redrill them in
redevelopment.5
In temporary abandonment, the
wellhead is removed, the producing
formation isolated with plugs, casing
plugged below the mud line, and a
corrosion cap inserted above the mud
line (Fig. 3). For wells temporarily
abandoned, MMS requires the operator
provide within 1 year of the abandonment and at 1-year intervals a report
describing plans for reentry to complete
or permanently abandon the well (30
CFR, Ch. 11, Part 250.703).
The decision to shut in a well vs.

performing a tempoarary abandonment
is a well and company-specific decision,
depending on many considerations,
including maintenance and monitoring
requirements, workover costs, remaining recoverable reserves, and strategic
objectives.
• Permanently abandoned. At the end of a
lease’s life, when production ceases, all
its wells must be permanently abandoned. A shut-in or temporarily abandoned well is a temporary or transitory
stage, while a permanently abandoned
well is the terminal state of a wellbore.
In a permanently abandoned operation, former producing horizons are
plugged and casing is cut off below
the mud line according to regulatory
guidelines (Fig. 4). In a permanently

P&A operations are one of the more
variable portions of decommissioning
because the operation is influenced by
numerous variables and events and, as
in most other offshore activities, tend
to depend on factors that cannot be
predicted.
Some factors that influence the time
and cost to plug and abandon a well
include the contract type, site location,
job specification, water depth, and
such exogenous events as weather and
problem wells. Such factors as wellbore
complexity, job preparation, and contractor experience are also important
variables but are generally considered
unobservable.
• Contract type. P&A contracts are written on a day-rate or turnkey basis and
both are popular in the Gulf of Mexico.
Under a day-rate contract, the service
company performs activities for a fixed
fee per day worked under the supervision of the operator. The contract speciOil & Gas Journal / Dec. 3, 2007

Wells, no.

operations is generally larger and of
greater significance the farther offshore
the activity occurs.
• Water depth. Water depth is often a
primary variable in offshore construction and drilling activities because
water depth determines the size and
technical specifications of the service
vessel and rig.
In water depths 400 ft (120 m) or
shallower, depth is not expected to be a
significant factor because this category
is relatively homogeneous in type of rig
required. For deepwater wells, water
depth will likely play a greater role in
the cost of the operation.
• Age. The equipment and components of a well will deteriorate over
time from corrosion, wear, and normal
operating conditions that may affect
the ability of the work crew to perform
P&A functions. In old wells, it is not
uncommon to find downhole obstructions in the production tubing, leaks,
and corrosion.
Not all components of a well have
the same age, however, and therefore
age comparisons need to be made with
caution. A well completed 25 years ago,
for example, could have a new tubing
string installed from a recent workover.
Without detailed knowledge of the
maintenance history of each well, such
information remains inaccessible, and
age may be an unreliable indicator.
50

• Preparation. The availability of good
records is essential to planning and execution. If good records are unavailable
or do not match the well configuration,
planning success may be affected.
In old wells, records may not exist
and, if they do, often provide incomplete or inaccurate data to indicate
downhole conditions. The long time
between well completion and P&A
means that operations are often performed after the value of the reservoir
is exhausted. Ideally, operators should
develop an abandonment plan before
the well is drilled, which should be
updated each time the well’s mechanical configuration is changed.
• Problem wells. Problems may arise in
P&A activities that delay the operation.
When an obstruction prevents pumping, wireline typically recovers the obstruction or moves it to a point where
pumping can be conducted.
Differences in fluid densities of the
cement plug and wellbore fluids can
contribute to plug failures, and inconsistencies may cause the cement to
move down through the well fluid and
become contaminated. Instability is also
influenced by wellbore angle, workstring or hole diameter, and wellborefluid geologies.
Such unexpected configurations or
wellbore conditions as holes in casing
can also slow the abandonment opera-

tion and contribute to cost overruns.
• Fluid type, severity. Wells with sour
fluids will have accelerated corrosion
rates and stress cracking that, depending on the age and wellbore construction, may impair a company’s ability to
perform P&A functions. Components
that feature corrosion-resistant alloys
can mitigate the effects of sour fluids to
some extent.
• Well access. In normal operations,
P&A activity takes place from a platform or workboat, and procedures and
tools are designed for vertical access.
For structures destroyed in a hurricane,
the wellbores lie horizontally on the
seabed, requiring special equipment
and procedures.
The loss of a platform can be compensated by the use of a lift boat or
mobile drilling unit. To allow vertical
access to wellbores, divers must cut
conductors. Diver cuts are significantly
more hazardous and expensive than
mechanical cutting, and limited access
and poor visibility often slow progress
and expose personnel to more risk than
normal conditions.
• Technology. Application and use of
advanced technology vary with service
provider and job specification. Tradeoffs
exist between the cost-saving potential
associated with new technology vs. the
start-up cost of learning; e.g., multifunction fishing techniques can reduce

the number of trips required to cut and
recover casing and the wellhead assembly in deepwater operations but are also
more expensive and difficult to apply.
The impact of technology and advanced
diagnostic tools on specific operations
is usually difficult to quantify.
• Construction practices. Well-construction practices used in drilling and
completions and decisions the operator
makes during the well’s production life
can affect P&A requirements. If annuli
are properly isolated with no uncontaminated cement during completion
and if the well is kept in good mechanical condition with regular workovers,
abandonment is usually relatively
straightforward to perform.
• Rig vs. “rigless” method. P&A operations
can be performed with either rig or
rigless methods. The method chosen is
dictated by engineering requirements,
contractor preference, and equipment
availability. Both methods are popular in
the Gulf of Mexico.
The traditional approach involves
using a rig with a derrick, drawworks,
and surface equipment, and precedes
much like a normal workover. A liftboat
may be moved to the job site or platform equipment may be available. Most
subsea wellheads require a rig-based
method.
In the rigless approach, a crane pulls
pipe, and coiled tubing and wireline units assist with the placement
of cement plugs. Coiled-tubing units
can enter and exit wells faster and are
normally less expensive than the rig
method.
• Exogenous conditions. Weather conditions, mechanical problems, and logistics can significantly affect the scope
of offshore operations and in most
instances are unpredictable. Weather
is a factor in all offshore operations
and weather extremes reduce labor
productivity and increase downtime.
Mechanical problems and logistics can
be mitigated to some extent through
preparation and proper contingency
planning.

Descriptive statistics
The database for analysis was
compiled from jobs performed by
Tetra Applied Technologies in the gulf
2002-07. The sample set consisted of
256 jobs and 1,156 wells performed
across a wide cross-section of operators,
representing 15-50% of all wellbores
plugged annually. At the time of the
analysis, the sample set for 2007 was
incomplete; conclusions based on the
2007 data are therefore not definitive.
Cost and operational data were
collected by review of invoice and
job reports for all offshore operations
performed by Tetra Applied Technologies. Job reports describe the day-to-day
(actually, hour-to-hour) operations
and include information on contract
type, operational activities, and use of
liftboats and workboats.
Water depth was available for only a
portion of the sample, and job type was
described for fewer than half the wells.
Contract type was specified. Jobs mainly
involved platform wells, and although
several wells were performed with
rigless techniques, most the jobs used
rigs. All of the jobs were in water depth
less than 400 ft on dry trees. No subsea
wellheads were abandoned.
For turnkey contracts, we employed
the total cost of the operation rather

than the revenue received (the contract
bid). The majority of the sample set
represented standalone P&A jobs, but
we also included a dozen or so jobs
performed as part of a total decommissioning operation in which the P&A
cost data were clearly delineated. Costs
are reported as current (nominal) dollars and are not adjusted for inflation.
An accompanying box describes
variable notation.
• Contract cost. In 2002-07, day-rate
contracts consisted of 116 jobs and
300 wellbores, and turnkey contracts
140 jobs and 856 wellbores. Contract
type is an important determinant of the
cost of the operation. The average P&A
cost for a day-rate contract was significantly smaller than the average turnkey
cost, ranging anywhere from 50-65%
less expensive (Table 1). In 2006-07, a
dramatic reversal occurred, with average
day-rate contracts exceeding the turnkey variety by four times in 2006 and
almost double in 2007 (Table 2).
A composite average P&A cost that
aggregates day-rate and turnkey contracts exhibits more regularity over time
because it averages across all jobs (Fig.
5). Fig. 6 shows the annual increase in
the composite P&A cost: In 2002-07,
the increase in the composite average
P&A cost was 11.3%/year.

A structural shift in cost appears
between 2002-05 and 2006-07. This
change in cost is due to the influence
of three factors: scale economies, the
level of competition for services in the
aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes, and
job type performed.
Turnkey contracts averaged 3.4
wells/job in 2002, 4.3 wells/job in
2003, 4.7 wells/job in 2004, and 5.9
wells/job in 2005. During this same
period, between 1.2-2.5 wells/job were
plugged under day-rate contracts.
In 2006, because of devastation from
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, damaged
structures required more wells to be
abandoned. It appears that turnkey operations were a favored contract for this
activity. Well owners preferentially select
turnkey contracts for large well inventories, old wells, or complex operations.
The total number of jobs did not
increase significantly from previous
years, but the number of wells per job
increased substantially (averaging 15.6
wells/job). Scale effects appear to be
important when five or more wells/job
are plugged.
Cost increases observed in 2006-07
are also due to the high level of competition for services. After the 2005
storms, competition for labor, equipment, and vessels in the gulf rose dramatically, increasing vessel day rates two
or three times historic levels. The same
competitive pressures hitting day-rate
contracts also affect turnkey jobs, but
scale economies for turnkey jobs appear
to serve as a moderating lever.
The third factor contributing to cost
differences between contract types is
related to the type of job performed,

Cost relations

Limitations of analysis
The P&A job data consist of a large and diverse sample, but because the data are from a single contractor, the analysis may not be representative of the industry as a whole. We believe the beneﬁts of
using a consistent and homogeneous data set outweigh the drawbacks from potential contractor bias.
All the jobs were performed on dry-trees in water less than 400 ft deep. Because deepwater wells
and subsea wells are more complex to plug and abandon and in some cases signiﬁcantly more complex,
extrapolation of the summary statistics outside this categorization is not valid.
The reported data did not allow us to differentiate between the type of operation performed under
turnkey and day-rate contracts. In normal years, turnkey contracts are often used on complex wellbores
or uncertain operations. During the aftermath of the 2005 hurricane season, turnkey contracts were the
preferred mechanism to help operators reduce their ﬁnancial exposure and operational risk associated
with cleanup operations.
Job requirements for temporary abandonment are not as rigorous as permanent abandonment. For all
things equal, therefore, the average cost of a typical temporary abandonment would be expected to be
less than a normal permanent abandonment. Unfortunately, the two operations cannot be distinguished
from the data entries; we therefore cannot distinguish the impact of this factor on the cost data.
It would be desirable to correlate P&A costs with the characteristics of the wellbore, job and contract
type, and the technical aspects of the operation, but such a correspondence is difﬁcult to realize in practice due to the complexity and uncertainty of the operation and lack of reliable data. Even if downhole
conditions could be modeled accurately, the degree of uncertainty due to topside factors can only be
reduced, not eliminated. P&A cost estimation, like most other aspects of decommissioning operations,
will always exhibit a high degree of uncertainty.

the number of wells per job increases,
unit costs typically decline. If learning
effects are present for multiple well
operations, the contractor may become
more efficient, and this should be reflected in the cost trends.
Another reason scale economies may
be observed in P&A activity has to do
with discounts that contractors offer
operators on multiple well packages. In
this case, the discount offered by the
contractor to acquire the job, rather
than any inherent learning, would be
responsible for the cost reduction. The
job data were analyzed by contract type
according to the number of wells per
job, for 1 well job, 2-4, 5-10, 11-15,
and more than 15 well jobs. (Table 6).
For day-rate contracts, the average
cost per well exhibits no well-defined
trend, but we observe that the average
cost per well for jobs with 1-4 wells is
somewhat greater than the larger wellcount categories.
For turnkey contracts, the results
exhibit a clearer trend. As the number
of wells per job increases in turnkey
contracts, the average cost per well
decreases significantly. The average cost
per well for jobs with less than 5 wells
is $177,000/well. For jobs with 5-10
wells/job, the average cost decreases to
$90,000/well, a 50% decrease in unit
cost from the 1-4 well job category.

As the number of wells per job increases further, the unit cost continues
to decrease, from $58,000/well (11-15
wells) to $44,000/well (more than 15
wells).

CONSIDER: If you use solid film backed corrosion
coatings, you may be crippling your CP investment.
There is a common sense reason for
this. CP systems protect pipelines by
delivering electrical current to the steel
surface. Solid film back corrosion
coatings have the property of high
dielectric strength, which means they
block electrical current. This blocking
effect is called cathodic shielding.
Cathodic shielding has been the subject
of dozens of technical papers since the
mid 1980’s.

A method tested on
various diesel blends of
known cetane numbers
showed a good correlation with the fuel’s
octane numbers.
Refining
Spontaneous ignition results in knock
in a spark-ignition engine, whereas
spontaneous ignition is required in a
diesel engine. In effect, octane
number and cetane numbers are
opposite measurements of the
same phenomenon. Low octane
number implies high cetane
number.
It is advantageous to test diesel fuels in octane test engines
that are much more widely available
than cetane test engines. To investigate
this possibility, we tested 50-50 blends
of diesel fuels with iso-octane in a
motor octane engine under standard
operating conditions. The motor octane
test is run at a high temperature, which
should favor operability with diesel fuel
blends.

Method relates diesel

Correlations

C ETANE NUMBERS

diesel fuels of known cetane number,
resulting in a good correlation. The
correlation, however, did not work well
for blends containing a cetane improver.
Motor octane test results underpredicted the effect of cetane improver on
ASTM D613 cetane engine results.
The correlation for diesel fuels without cetane improvers using the motor
octane blending value is:
Cetane number = 58.4 – 0.54 ×
Motor octane blending value.
Subsequently, we performed a more
detailed study including diesel fuels
from seven different refineries within
six different companies. Diesel reference
fuels were included, and the diesel fuel
from one refinery was tested with 0.1%
and 0.2% cetane improver.
Table 1 shows the results.
As in the preliminary study, the effect
of cetane improver on cetane number
was underpredicted.
The correlation based on fuels without cetane improver using the motor
octane for a 50-50 blend of diesel and
iso-octane is:
Cetane number = 105.9 – 0.94 ×
Motor octane for 50-50 blend.

between calculated and measured cetane number for diesel fuels without a
cetane improver.
The standard error, which is only
1.29 cetane numbers, can be explained
by the variability of the cetane and motor octane tests. The lack of fit must be
small.
Converting the above equation to the
blending value form yields the improved equation:
Cetane number = 58.9 – 0.47 ×
Motor octane blending value.
The improved equation is similar to
that obtained in the preliminary work,
but this equation gives predictions
about three cetane numbers higher.
The industry may wish to consider this
test procedure as an alternate to cetane
engine test, ignition delay tests, and the
cetane index.

Despite this large disadvantage, such
a change could be worthwhile under
unusual marketing and refining conditions.

Further development
The under-prediction of cetane
improver effects could be due to the
high surface temperature of the mix-

ture heater with this method. Intake air
temperature was 100° F. and the air-fuel
mixture is 300° F.
A preliminary test with the mixture heater turned down or off might
provide an answer. The fuels would be
50-50 iso-octane blends of high-cetane
reference fuel, low-cetane reference
fuel, and low-cetane reference fuel with

NELSON-FARRAR COST INDEXES
Reﬁnery construction (1946 Basis)
(Explained on p.145 of the Dec. 30, 1985, issue)

Use of the correlation
The blending-value form of the
equation is useful because it facilitates
evaluation of alternate constituents of
diesel fuel.
For example, consider balancing the
use of 325°+ F. reformer feed vs. its
use to maximize reformate value. This
might be done by taking the cut after
hydrotreating as a premium component
for low-sulfur diesel. Otherwise, the
cut point before hydrotreating could be
changed to include the 325°+ F. portion in diesel fuel.
In either case, one can estimate the
cetane number by assuming that the
motor octane blending value will be
reasonably close to the motor octane
rating of the cut. Based on gas chromatograph data for a reformer feed, the
motor octane of the 325°+ F. portion
will be about 45. On that basis, the
cetane number will be about 38, quite
suitable for diesel fuel:
Cetane number = 58.9 – 0.47 (45)
= 37.7
Balanced against the increase in
diesel fuel volume would be the loss of
reformate quantity and quality. When
reforming to a 92 (R + M)/2 full boiling reformate, the 325°+ F. reformate
cut will be about 100 (R + M)/2.1

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

Computable parameters
Computable parameters are extensively used in understanding corrosion
and include pH, wall-shear stress, and

effect becomes prominent only in
the presence of CO2. Carbon dioxide
dissolved in water readily combines
with water to form carbonic acid. The
carbonic acid then dissociates into the
hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion. The
excess bicarbonate shifts the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the rate of
CO2 corrosion.
Bicarbonate also acts as a buffer. A
bicarbonate buffer can absorb H+ ions
and neutralize the acids produced by
CO2 dissolution. This buffer contains a
weak acid, carbonic acid, H2CO3, and a
bicarbonate anion, HCO3.
Table 5 shows the experimentally
determined variation in pit growth rates
with bicarbonate concentration.
• Chloride ion. Chloride ions are the
most common cause of pitting. Like
other halides, chloride ion acts as a very
potent agent in destroying otherwise
protective passive surface layers. In the
case of chloride-induced pitting, the
corrosion mechanism also involves
strong chloride concentrating effects
in a growing pit, accelerating the rate
of pit development in an autocatalytic
growth process.
Table 6 shows the experimentally
determined variation in pit growth rates
with chloride ions.

sion point and oil wettability require
experimental determination. Absent the
results of these experiments, this article
assumes the pipeline was operating
under water-wet conditions carrying
oil-in-water emulsion.
Production of the gas through casing venting complicated determination
of the gas production rate. Absent the
actual gas production rate, this article
simulated both low flow and high flow
regimes by calculating the pitting corrosion rate for both conditions.
Table 11 shows predicted pitting corrosion rates of 0.6-1.8 mm/year for the
low flow regime and 0.6-2.0 mm/year
for the high flow regime. This compares
quite favorably to the observed corrosion rate of 1.19-1.24 mm/year. ✦

Two new tools for E&P operations
A new quad full high-definition monitor for ultrarefined geoscience visualization and analysis and a new data-compression appliance are suited for exploration
and production uses.
The new Landmark M5600 monitor
features a 56-in. quad full high-definition
screen that the firm says is four times the
size and twice the pixel count of current
high resolution 30-in. screens. The monitor offers a resolution of 3,840 by 2,160.
When the monitor is paired with one
of the firm’s recommended visualization servers and high-performance work
stations from Dell, HP, Sun, and Verari, it
makes high-end visualization capabilities affordable and easy to deploy, both in
individual work areas and in team rooms,
the company notes.
The monitor’s resolution, when
coupled with its expansive viewing area,
allows users to view large volumes of de-

tailed data in full context. The monitor also
allows users to view multiple data sources
together. The company says this capability
enables geoscientists to digitally revisit the
days when they would put big sheets of
paper on the wall side-by-side. The M5600
allows users to do the same thing they
used to do with paper, only in high-resolution digital format.
Data-compression appliance. The device, known as the Storwize STN 6000, is
capable of tripling E&P data-storage capacities through real-time storage compression—a feature that the firm says efficiently and effectively improves storage space
without the purchase of additional storage
devices. Installation of the STN 6000 does
not require any changes to existing infrastructure. The compression operations are
invisible to users, while application and
storage performance increase as a result of
the device.

The appliance is produced by Storwize
Inc., San Jose, Calif. The STN 6000 is designed to work with any network attached
storage array.
It delivers real-time, lossless, data compression and decompression at speeds that
make it transparent to users.
The technology uses patent-pending algorithms that can reduce operating
expenses associated with a customer’s
current storage units. For example, the
technology can delay migrations to additional storage units and also lower costs
associated with power, air conditioning,
and available floor space. Because the appliance compresses large volumes of data
before backup, it can reduce downtime
and shorten backup and restore cycles, the
company says. In addition, it can reduce
the amount of data sent over wide-area
networks for remote backup.

RECOVERY METHODS

™

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs once considered economically and
technically impossible. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy.
But they’re still unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing
wells in them are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems.
Producing gas from unconventional reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the
market requires continuous rethinking – the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible
with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 – Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by editors
of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight innovation
from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and learn from other
professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.
So mark your calendar.
Plan to attend the ﬁrst annual Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition.

Gasoline price
sting not what
politicians say
The sting of rising gasoline prices is a
handy political cudgel, whatever its severity.
“For the nearly 7 years of the Bush administration,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
(D-Calif.) said recently, “the rising cost of
gas and home heating oil has been a major
economic stress on millions of American
families” (OGJ, Nov. 12, 2007, p. 36).
Yet a report by the Federal Reserve Bank

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s

by Bob Tippee, Editor

of Dallas notes that US expenditures on
gasoline as a share of American budgets
remain well below levels of the early 1980s.
“At today’s higher incomes, gasoline
expenditures claim less than 4% of US
after-tax personal income,” write Stephen
P.A. Brown, director of energy economics
and microeconomic policy, and Raghav Virmani, economic analyst, in the Dallas Fed’s
October Economic Letter. “The comparable
ﬁgure for 1981 was more than 6%.”
Early in the Bush presidency, the
gasoline claim on after-tax income was 3%
or below. It has risen steadily since 2002,
partly because of increases in driving but
mostly because of rising gasoline prices,
Brown and Virmani say.
To blame Bush for gasoline price increases is to overlook market events such
as hurricanes, strains on crude supplies,
and relentlessly growing demand—about
which presidents can’t do much.
Brown and Virmani have developed a
model showing how the US spot gasoline
price tracks the spot price of West Texas
Intermediate crude. Using just those factors, the model shows spot gasoline prices
eventually rise by 2.8¢/gal for every $1/bbl
increase in spot WTI.
Reﬁned to account for seasonality and
other factors, the model explains more than
99% of past US gasoline prices.
Its forecast? At crude prices indicated
by October futures contracts, spot gasoline
prices will rise by 20¢/gal in the next few
months then decline by 35¢/gal over the
next 3 years, with seasonal variations each
year of about 27¢/gal.
Stress? Yes. But it won’t be historic, as
politicians are sure to portray it.
“At today’s incomes,” Brown and
Vermani say, “retail gasoline prices would
have to reach about $5.50/gal before they
took the same share of US household budgets as they did in 1981.”

Marching to $100/bbl oil
When the front-month crude futures contract fell $3.45 to $91.17/bbl Nov. 13—the
lowest level in nearly 2 weeks on the New York Mercantile Exchange—after the
International Energy Agency reduced estimates of global oil demand for the fourth
quarter through 2008, many analysts declared the march to $100/bbl oil had ﬁnally
ﬁzzled. Imagine their surprise when the January crude contract jumped $3.39 to a
record closing of $98.03/bbl Nov. 20, climbing as high as the Nov. 7 record of $98.62/
bbl in intraday trading. The price continued climbing to $99.29/bbl in early electronic
trading Nov. 21 before closing at $97.29/bbl, down 74¢ for the day on NYMEX. But
the push for $100/bbl oil may not be over.
The volume of crude traded Nov. 19 on the New York market was “the lowest level
of the last 55 trading days,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix
GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, in a Nov. 21 report. In a low-volume, preholiday market, a
large pension fund buying oil assets with the weaker dollar could trigger a rally.
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. blamed the
record-low weakness of the US dollar for driving up crude prices. “Credit spreads
widened following the Federal Reserve’s cut in its growth outlook for next year to a
growth of only 1.8-2.5%. This, coupled with the US 10-year Treasury yield falling below 4% for the ﬁrst time since 2005, sunk the dollar to a new record low [of] $1.4850
vs. the euro,” they said.
Moreover, Raymond James said, “Oil was trading up premarket on expectations
of colder weather in the Northeast and supply setbacks in Canada and Mexico.” Fire
damaged a 155,000 b/d oil sands upgrader at Royal Dutch Shell PLC’s Scotford reﬁning complex near Edmonton, Alta., on Nov. 18. The upgrader and Shell’s adjacent
98,000 b/d reﬁnery were operating at reduced rates Nov. 20. Oil produced by the
upgrader is processed through the reﬁnery.
Dollar value
However, analysts at Barclays Capital Research, a division of Barclays Bank PLC,
London, claim the weakness of the dollar against other currencies has limited effect
on oil markets. “A widespread misconception is that the value of the dollar and the
price of oil are linked by a clear indirect relationship. This belief has grown stronger
over the past 3 months fueled by the simultaneous acceleration in the fall of the
greenback and the move up in oil prices. In our view, the relationship between the
two is far more tenuous that many might think. Firstly, there is no evidence that periods of dollar weakness are associated with higher oil prices, and, historically, a wide
range of behavior has been displayed,” they reported Nov. 21.
“Arguably, a weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for nondollar consumers, whereas it
squeezes proﬁts for non-US producers, which should prove supportive for prices over
time,” said Barclays analysts. “While the magnitude of the effect is far from clear, its
transmission would involve substantial time lags. Reﬁners are often insulated from
ﬂuctuations in the value of the dollar as both their inputs and outputs are denominated in the same currency, and any knock-on effect induced by higher-end user demand
would likely be in the region of quarters and years rather than days. On these grounds
we see very little substance to those explanations which base the latest move-up in oil
prices on the deterioration of the dollar, and by contrast we see the tightening of the
physical market balance as having a far better explanatory power.”
They predicted, “Severe constraints on the supply side and limited room for
maneuver by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the short term
will keep prices vulnerable to supply disruptions and a faster-than-expected erosion
of the inventory cover.”
OPEC’s summit meeting Nov. 17-18 in Riyadh was only the third meeting of member heads of state in the group’s 47 years. At that meeting, President Hugo Chavez
of Venezuela and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran urged that the cartel quit
pricing its oil in US dollars in favor of a basket of stronger currencies. Saudi Arabia
opposed that move.
Analysts at Barclays Capital Research see little chance for such a change. “It
would necessitate a major overhaul of the existing pricing system, given that OPEC
crudes are currently priced in terms of dollar adjustments from dollar-denominated
benchmarks. The absence of non-US dollar alternatives (the only exception being the
yen-denominated contracts traded on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange) would therefore require moving away from current market mechanisms and setting up a brand
new pricing system, which we believe is unfeasible,” they said.

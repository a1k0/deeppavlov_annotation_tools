Advancing Reservoir Performance

We Take the Heat
Hughes Christensen Vanguard Bits
Geothermal drilling and other hot-hole applications subject drill bits to extremely high
temperatures and pressures. These harsh drilling environments have always had a punishing
impact on bit performance — until now. Finally, there’s a drill bit that’s engineered to withstand
the specific challenges of high-temperature drilling: The all-new Hughes Christensen Vanguard
series brings unique capabilities to these demanding applications — next-generation drilling
technology you won’t find anywhere else.
 High-temperature elastomer compounds provide reliable, continuous service at
temperatures in excess of 500° Fahrenheit.
 Metal-sealed bearings use a metal-to-metal sealing system that delivers superior
performance under the most strenuous conditions.
 Specially formulated bearing grease extends bearing life with its thermal stability and
high viscosity.
Vanguard premium Tricone drill bits are customized to meet the individual requirements
of each application, for performance that simply can’t be beat. Only from
Hughes Christensen.

COVER
ExxonMobil Corp. will reduce operating costs and greenhouse
gas emissions through installation of a cogeneration plant at its
305,000-b/d refinery in Antwerp (cover).The plant will generate 125 Mw and reduce Belgium’s CO2 emissions by 200,000
tonnes/year. Oil & Gas Journal’s exclusive European Refining
report, which begins on p. 18 and continues on p. 44, analyzes
the outlook for European refiners that will need to adapt their
strategies to maintain competitiveness as the global recession eases,
especially as the International Energy Agency has warned of a possible tightening of oil supplies over the next few years. Photo from

Bill would reverse oil shale program revision

Chevron exits Kenyan marketing business

US Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) has introduced a bill to restore the Bush administration’s oil shale programs and reverse US
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar’s revision of them.
Salazar announced Feb. 25 that DOI would offer another round
of oil shale research, development, and demonstration (RD&D)
leases in Colorado and Utah. He withdrew a proposal for expanded
offerings.
An earlier oil shale RD&D lease solicitation was withdrawn because it contained several flaws, Salazar said.
On June 5, Lamborn introduced his bill, saying Salazar’s actions
bring uncertainty to future oil sands research.
“Investors will not commit millions, or potentially billions, of
dollars to the research and development needed to make oil shale
a viable energy source unless they have a clear picture of the financial rewards and challenges associated with such an investment,”
Lamborn said.
His bill directs Salazar to issue additional RD&D leases within
180 days of enactment using bids published on Jan. 15, effectively
reversing the secretary’s Feb. 25 action.
Lamborn’s bill would make commercial oil shale regulation
guidelines that DOI published in November permanent and apply
them to all commercial leasing of federal oil shale holdings. It also
would give the Interior secretary authority to provide incentives to
producers by temporarily reducing royalties and fees.
“Oil shale could result in the addition of more than 1 trillion
bbl of recoverable oil from lands in the western United States. This
is too vital a resource to keep under lock and key,” said Lamborn,
ranking minority member of the House Natural Resources Committee’s Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee. “Secretary
Salazar is dragging his feet with one of America’s most promising
new energy sources. America needs to wean itself from foreign
sources of energy once and for all.”

Chevron Africa Holdings Ltd. has sold Chevron Kenya Ltd. to
Total Outre Mer.
The initial sales agreement, announced in November 2008, was
part of Chevron’s strategy to streamline its downstream operations.
In April both parties also completed the sale of Chevron Uganda
Ltd. Chevron Kenya and Chevron Uganda’s assets include 165 Caltex-branded service stations, one terminal, seven fuel depots, six
aviation facilities, one lubricants blending plant, and a commercial
and industrial fuels business.
The values of the transactions were not disclosed.

Hamm interests take Hiland Partners private
Enid oilman Harold Hamm, his affiliates, and family trusts are
acquiring the interest they don’t already own in Hiland Partners
LP and Hiland Holdings GP LP, Enid, Okla., which will become
private entities.
Hamm proposed to take the businesses private on Jan. 15. Conflicts committees have recommended for the transactions, to be
completed in the third quarter.
In the mergers, Hiland Partners unitholders will receive $7.75
for each common unit they hold, and Hiland Holdings unitholders
will receive $2.40 for each common unit they hold.
Hiland Partners is a public midstream energy partnership that
buys, gathers, compresses, dehydrates, treats, processes, and markets natural gas and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids. It
also provides air compression and water injection services for use
in oil and gas secondary recovery operations.
Highland Partners owns 15 Midcontinent and Rocky Mountain
gathering systems totaling 2,138 miles of pipelines, six gas processing plants, seven treatment plants, three fractionation plants,
two air compression facilities, and a water injection plant.
Hiland Holdings owns the 2% general partner interest,
2,321,471 common units and 3,060,000 subordinated units in
Hiland Partners, and the incentive distribution rights of Hiland
Partners. ✦

Pioneer updates Texas, ANS drilling
Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Dallas, completed its first horizontal well in the Eagle Ford shale play.
The Friedrichs Gas Unit No. 1 well, drilled in Dewitt County,
Tex., initially flowed 3.7 MMcfd of gas equivalent, including 2.7
MMcfd of natural gas and 160 b/d of condensate, after partially
completing only five stages of a planned eight-stage completion.
Mechanical problems in the original lateral required a sidetrack
with a modified well path that reduced the well’s exposure to the

main reservoir section in the brittle shale at the base of the Eagle
Ford formation. Pioneer estimates only two stages of the fracture
stimulation, representing less than 500 ft of the 3,000-ft lateral,
penetrated the brittle shale and are contributing to gas production.
Scott Sheffield, Pioneer’s chairman and chief executive, said,
“We have drilled more than 150 wells through the Eagle Ford shale
as we developed the deeper Edwards formation and recognize the
potential that underlies our 310,000 gross acres in the play.” The

company plans to drill a second Eagle Ford well more than 40
miles southwest of the first location in the third quarter. Additional
wells are planned to high grade that acreage, including another
well in the Friedrichs area.
At Pioneer’s Oooguruk project on Alaska’s North Slope, operations are under way to drill four horizontal laterals in the Nuiqsut
formation during the second and third quarters.Two will be fracturestimulated producing wells, and two will be water-injection wells.
The first water-injection well was completed and is being produced temporarily to measure the unstimulated productive capability of the Nuiqsut formation. It was tested initially at 2,500 b/d
of oil and was put on production at a stabilized 1,000 b/d.
Initial production exceeded expectations, Sheffield said. Pioneer’s net production from Oooguruk was forecast to average
5,000 b/d in 2009, gradually increasing to 10,000-14,000 b/d
in 2011 as development drilling continues. “Later this year, we
will reevaluate our production profile to incorporate higher than
expected performance from our Kuparuk wells, early waterflood
results, and the performance of our planned fracture-stimulated
Nuiqsut wells,” Sheffield said.
Pioneer operates the Oooguruk project with 70% working interest, and Eni Petroleum US LLC holds a 30% working interest.

Africa Exploration Ltd. (EAE), a unit of Black Marlin Energy Ltd.,
for their entry into the production-sharing contracts in Ethiopia
and Kenya.
In Ethiopia, Africa Oil said it will transfer a 30% license interest
to EAE in Blocks 2/6 and 7/8, which both lie in what Africa Oil
calls “the highly underexplored” Ogaden basin of southern Ethiopia.
In Kenya, Africa Oil will transfer a 20% license interest to EAE in
prospective Block 10A, which is in northern Kenya’s Anza basin.
In both cases, EAE will pay a disproportionate share of costs associated with the planned 2D seismic data programs to be carried
out in 2009-10 as well as paying a portion of Africa Oil’s past costs
and future operational costs, Africa Oil said.
Africa Oil also said it has executed a seismic contract with Upstream Petroleum Services Ltd. to undertake the seismic acquisition in both Ethiopia and Kenya. Africa Oil remains operator of all
blocks associated with the transaction.
The farmout transaction also is subject to approvals of the appropriate regulatory authorities from the governments of Ethiopia
and Kenya, in addition to a waiver of preemptive rights by an existing partner in the Ethiopian licenses.

Centrica to buy 45% stake in Trinidad block
Repsol YPF consortium to explore off Falklands

Centrica PLC will increase its position in Trinidadian LNG development by acquiring a 45% interest in gas development Block
5(c), off the southeast coast of Trinidad and Tobago.
The company agreed to pay $142.5 million cash to Canadian
Superior Energy Inc. and will use the estimated 650 bcf of recoverable gas to supply customers in the UK, North America, or other
Atlantic Basin markets from 2014. The block is close to existing gas
pipeline infrastructure and LNG export facilities. The company’s
initial estimates of development capital expenditure attributable to
its stake are £400 million.
Centrica will join BG Group, which operates the block with a
30% stake. “The agreement is subject to preemption rights from
the existing field partners and subject to approvals from the Trinidad Government and Canadian courts,” said Centrica.
So far BG has discovered significant contingent gas reserves, and
the partners hope undrilled exploration opportunities could substantially increase the potential of the block. Centrica said its share
of reserves is equivalent to half its current UK gas reserves.
Centrica Chief Executive Sam Laidlaw said, “Trinidad is one of
the key export areas for Atlantic Basin LNG with substantial available reserves and infrastructure in place. Gas produced from this
block could help address our long-term structural hedge position
by reducing our exposure to volatile wholesale gas prices, offering a potential future gas supply option for our British Gas customers in the UK and for our Direct Energy customers in North
America.”
Africa Oil signs farmout for blocks
Centrica has an existing position in Trinidad and Tobago through
Africa Oil Corp. has announced a farmout agreement with East an equity interest in Block 2(ab). ✦

A consortium led by Repsol YPF SA plans oil and gas exploration in
international waters off the Falkland Islands beginning in early 2010.
Repsol YPF executives disclosed no project details. In 2006,
Repsol and Energia Argentina SA (Enarsa) signed two agreements
to explore and develop oil and gas off Argentina.
The first is a 10-year strategic agreement covering all areas
100% owned by Repsol or Enarsa off Argentina within three zones
of interest from the Uruguay border to the Falkland Islands.
The second agreement establishes a consortium specifically
to explore the Colorado Marina basin. Consortium members are
Enarsa, Repsol, Petrobras, and Petrouruguay.
Repsol operates the area with 35% interest while Enarsa holds
35%, Petrobras 25%, and Petrouruguay 5%.
Argentina and Britain both claim large areas of the seabed
around the islands.
Britain lodged a claim for 1.2 million sq km in May. Argentina
filed a claim for the same area in April with the UN Commission
on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.
British company Rockhopper Exploration PLC in May reclassified a 1998 North Falkland basin exploration well as a gas discovery with a 3.4 tcf mean contingent resource.

Transmission Ltd. told Canada’s National Energy Board.
Of Groundbirch’s projected throughput of 7.5 tcf, about 6.8
tcf would come from the Montney out of an estimated 40 tcf of
marketable gas expected to be available from the formation, Nova
said.
Conventional resources in the project drainage area would contribute the other 0.7 tcf. Nova noted that conventional gas production in the project drainage area comes from the Cadomin, Doig,
Gething, Baldonnel, Halfway, Bluesky, and Charlie Lake formations
above Montney and the Kiskatinaw below the Montney.
Construction on the 77-km, 36-in., 1.66 bcfd Groundbirch line
is to start in the third quarter of 2010, and the expected service
date is Nov. 1, 2010. The line is to run from Groundbirch, BC, to
Gordondale, Alta., passing north of the Dawson Creek area.
Public estimates of original gas in place in the Triassic Montney
tight sand formation in Northeast British Columbia range as high
as 318 tcf, said Nova.
Nova said it used a 25% recovery factor compared with published estimates of 10% to more than 60% recovery from the
Montney.
Nova projects flow on Groundbirch at 255 MMcfd in 2010-11
rising to more than 1 bcfd in 2015-16 and exceeding 1.4 bcfd by
2020-21 (OGJ Online, Feb. 27, 2009).

Dong E&P orders subsea production system
Dong E&P Norge AS awarded Aker Solutions a 350 million kroner engineering, procurement, and construction contract for a
subsea production system for developing Oselvar field on Blocks
1/3 and 1/2 in the North Sea.
The production system includes a four-slot template with manifold, three subsea trees, control systems, subsea wellheads, and 28
km of steel-tube umbilicals.
Oselvar, discovered in 1991, is in the southwest part of the
North Sea in about 70 m of water. Appraisal wells were drilled in
1995, 2007, and 2008.
The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate indicates that the field
may recover 4.4 million cu m of oil and 4.8 billion cu m of gas.
It says the field contains oil with a gradual transition to gas via a
condensate phase. Depth of the reservoir is at 2,900-3,250 m.
Dong E&P plans to produce Oselvar with three subsea completed horizontal wells.
The subsea production system will tie back to the BP PLC-operated Ula platform on Block 7/12, about 23 km from Oselvar.
Part of the gas from Oselvar will be used for injection in a water-

Valero halts two US hydrocracker projects
Valero Energy Corp. has suspended plans to add hydrocrackers
at two US refineries, citing its agreement to acquire a major refining interest in the Netherlands.
Valero Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Klesse said the
company is “indefinitely postponing our major new hydrocracker
projects at St. Charles and Port Arthur.”
At the 250,000-b/d Port Arthur, Tex., refinery, Valero had

alternating-gas scheme for enhancing oil recovery from Ula, and
oil and the remaining gas will go via Ula to Ekofisk for further
transport.
The contract is subject to the Norwegian government approval
of the March development and operation plan for Oselvar.
Aker will manage the contract from its Oslo headquarters and
manufacture most subsea equipment in its Norwegian facilities at
Tranby, Moss, and Egersund. Aker Solutions is a subsidiary of Aker
Subsea AS.
Aker expects to make final equipment deliveries in first quarter
2011; planned start of production is expected in fourth quarter 2011.
Operator Dong E&P holds a 40% interest in Production License
274 on Block 1/3. Partners in the license are Bayerngas Produksjon
Norge 30%, Wintershall Norge ASA 15%, and Norwegian Energy
Co. ASA 15%.
Dong E&P has an agreement to acquire Wintershall’s interest in
Oselvar.

Lacq ﬁeld CCS project is France’s ﬁrst
Following 2 years of study and preparation, Total SA has received
administrative authorization to start injecting carbon dioxide in
France’s first carbon capture and storage (CCS) pilot project.
Injection into the nearly depleted Rousse reservoir at Lacq
gas field in southwestern France is to start in late June and last 2
years.
CO2 will be captured from exhaust gases at one of five boilers at
Lacq’s steam generating plant converted to an oxyfuel combustion
unit, then compressed and sent via a 27-km pipeline for injection
into the Rousse at a depth of 4,500 m.
The pilot plant will produce some 40 tonnes/hr of steam,
which will be used by industries in the Lacq complex. It will emit
120,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2 years.
The Rousse reservoir, a carbonate formation, will be closely
monitored through detectors set throughout the surface and subsoil to measure the injection flow and the CO2 pressure, temperature, and concentration.
The €60 million pilot is being carried out in cooperation with
Institut Francais du Petrole and Bureau de Recherche Geologique et
Miniere (Mining and Geological Research Office).
Its purpose is threefold: to better master the oxyfuel combustion process, namely for applications in the production of extraheavy oils; to halve the cost of carbon capture compared with existing processes; and to develop monitoring tools, techniques, and
methods to establish that long-term and large-scale geological CO2
storage is viable. ✦

erland NV (TRN) for $752 million (OGJ Online, May 26, 2009).
TRN owns a 190,000-b/d refinery in Vlissingen with 68,000 b/d
of hydrocracking capacity.
“In the current environment, it makes more sense to acquire existing
capacity at a substantial discount to new construction costs,” he said.
In the TRN deal, Klesse said, “we believe the purchase price is
less than 50% of replacement cost for this world-class distillate
hydrocracking facility.”
In March, Valero won a bid to buy five ethanol plans plus one
under development from bankrupt VeraSun Energy Corp. at a price it
estimated to be 30% of replacement cost. It agreed to pay $477 million for total ethanol production capacity of 780 million gal/year.

Shell sells gasoline blended with cellulosic ethanol
Royal Dutch Shell PLC on June 10 launched a month-long demonstration selling gasoline blended with 10% cellulosic ethanol at
a Shell service station in Ottawa, Ont.
The cellulosic ethanol, made from wheat straw, was produced
at Iogen Energy Corp.’s demonstration plant in Ottawa using advanced conversion processes. Iogen and Shell are partners in the
plant, which produces 40,000 l./month of fuel.
The demonstration is part of Shell’s strategic investment and
development program in sustainable biofuels.
Graeme Sweeney, Shell executive vice-president future fuels,
said this demonstration is an indication of what is possible in the
future.
“While it will be some time before general customers can buy
this product at local service stations, we are working with governments to make large-scale production economic,” Sweeney said.
Brian Foody, Iogen Corp. chief executive officer, said, “Building
a demo plant is one thing but you then need to go through the
process of operating the new technology at scale, learning, modifying and lowering costs.”

Iogen, a biotechnology firm, has produced cellulosic ethanol at
its Ottawa demonstration plant since 2004.
Shell also is working with German company Choren to launch
a new biofuels plant that will convert biomass, such as woodchips,
into synthetic fuel, which is then being marketed by Choren as
SunFuel.
The fuel is being used in diesel engines and can reduce emissions.
The 15,000 tonne/year plant uses waste plant material. Shell earlier
signed a letter of intent with Volkswagen and Iogen to assess the economic feasibility of producing cellulose ethanol in Germany.

Texas suing BP Texas City reﬁnery
The Texas Attorney General’s Office is suing BP Products North
America Inc. for 46 pollution violations at its Texas City, Tex., refinery, the site of a 2005 explosion that killed 15 workers and injured
170 others.
On June 4, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said BP did not
report emissions to regulators by certain deadlines. Abbott’s office
filed a hearing for an injunction requiring BP to install additional
air monitors.
A June 29 hearing is scheduled in state district court in Austin,
where the lawsuit was filed on May 22. It claims BP improperly
released volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, hydrogen
sulfide, and nitrogen oxides.
“BP Products is charged with polluting our environment,
concealing information from authorities and harming Texans,”
Abbot said. “In recent years, more than 45 unlawful pollutant
emissions occurred at BP’s Texas City facility. This enforcement
action holds BP accountable for failing to comply with environmental, health and safety laws that are intended to protect
Texans from harm.”
In response, BP said it had no comment on the lawsuit. But BP
spokesmen in the past have said the company is working to reduce
the number of emissions events at the Texas City refinery. ✦

ConocoPhillips VLCC leaves Orkneys for Chile
A very large crude carrier (VLCC), after spending 3 months as
a floating storage unit, sailed from the Scapa Flow in Scotland’s
Orkney Islands bound for Chile with a load of North Sea Ekofisk
crude.
The Orkney Islands Council Department of Harbours said the
Malaysian-registered Bunga Kasturi Dua, carrying 2 million bbl of
crude oil, anchored in Scapa Flow on Feb. 14, chartered by ConocoPhillips.
The departure of the VLCC “leaves the Abqaiq and the Maersk
Neptune still at anchor in Scapa Flow, storing between them just
under 4 million bbl of Forties Crude,” the council said.
In May, the council said that a recent ship-to-ship transfer between the Leander and the Front Shanghai, which saw 2 million
bbl of crude transferred, brought the total amount of oil transferred this year to just more than 10 million bbl.
Oil stored in Scapa Flow is part of 20 million bbl of North Sea
oil currently stored in Europe on supertankers, creating a readily
available source of supply that has helped keep a lid on North Sea

Peru fertilizer plant would need gas line
A grassroots nitrogen fertilizer complex under consideration in
Peru would require construction of about 100 miles of gas pipeline.
CF Industries, Deerfield, Ill., has let a lump-sum contract to
Technip of Paris for front-end engineering design of the complex,
proposed to be built near the coastal city of San Juan de Marcona.
The complex, Peru’s first major nitrogen fertilizer facility, would
use natural gas from Camisea area fields about 300 miles northeast.
The contract covers a 2,600-ton/day ammonia unit, a 3,850ton/day urea synthesis plant, a 3,850-ton/day urea granulation
unit, and utility and offsite facilities.
Work is to be complete by yearend, after which a decision will
be made whether to proceed.
The plant would require a link to a pipeline that carries Camisea
gas to fractionation facilities in Pisco, south of the site of a liquefaction plant under construction by the Peru LNG consortium (OGJ

The bottom of the barrel: on the road or in the tank?
Conventionally, heavy reﬁnery residues are used as asphalt pavement or combusted
as fuel oil in power plants. This represents a waste of valuable resources, on the one
hand, and causes serious pollution, on the other.
Lurgi has engineered processes to convert these reﬁnery heavies into synthetic gas.
This gas can in turn be used as a feedstock for petrochemical products or synthetic
fuels. Such designer fuels reduce the greenhouse effect and are free from benzene,
nitrogen and sulfur.
It is thus up to you to make more out of the increasingly scarce valuable oil reserves.
To your beneﬁt. And to that of our environment.

Waste no more time and resources.

‘No regret’ warming solutions

Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
Global warming is a reality, but
many proposed solutions would be
“much more costly to society than the
danger it seeks to avert,” according to
a June report by National Center for
Policy Analysis (NCPA), a conservative
Washington, DC, think-tank.
“The world will surely regret it if
billions of people are mired in poverty
because resources are diverted to solve
a nonexistent or trivial problem. On
the other hand, the world would regret
doing nothing if human-made global
warming is a serious problem,” said the
report authored by Iain Murray with
the Competitive Enterprise Institute and
NCPA Senior Fellow H. Sterling Burnett.
They suggest “no regrets” programs
“that would prove beneficial whether
or not human activities are creating
a global warming problem” without
“sacrificing living standards.” This
includes elimination of all subsidies for
fuel use since these encourage greater
consumption and raise emission levels.
The International Energy Agency estimates developing countries spend $220
billion/year on subsidies for energy
production and consumption, including $170 billion subsidizing fossil
fuels. Even the push by US legislators to
hold down consumer costs and punish
oil companies for price increases only
encourages greater consumption of
depleting resources.
Moreover, the report said, government subsidies for energy research and
development cost millions but produce
minimal benefits and often are allocated
“on the basis of political favoritism.”
14

The report said, “The Congressional
Budget Office and other analysts note
that federal R&D money rarely produces
commercially viable technologies.”
Instead, NCPA favors an “X” prize
competition that rewards successful independent research—something like the
government and private competitions
that encouraged early development of
the automobile and the airplane.
The center does favor subsidies to
remove older, more-polluting cars from
the road by replacing them with newer
models. Auto manufacturers support
this, but collectors of antique cars
worry whether it might eliminate classic car rallies.

Drop ﬂood insurance
Another likely controversial proposal
is to repeal the US National Flood Insurance Program. NCPA said, “Subsidized
flood insurance is responsible for much
of the development in coastal areas and
in flood plains. Eliminating this subsidy
would make us less vulnerable to higher
sea levels and increased rainfall.”
The report said, “This 41-year-old
program has arguably outgrown its
original purpose, which was to provide
temporary flood insurance to property owners who were unaware they
were in flood-prone areas. Because of
full-disclosure mortgage and insurance
requirements, nearly all current owners
were aware of their area’s flood problems when they purchased or developed their properties. Today, federally
subsidized flood insurance encourages
people to build homes where they otherwise would not. It encourages lenders
to finance mortgages they otherwise
would not.” This encourages high-risk
development and harms environmentally sensitive areas, including wetlands,
floodplains, and coastal marshes.

Congestion pricing
NCPA recommends the establish-

ment of more toll roads with “congestion pricing” rates of higher fees during
peak hours and lower fees during offpeak times. “Congestion increases travel
time, worsens air pollution, increases
carbon dioxide emissions, and wastes
fuel. According to the Texas Transportation Institute, based on wasted time
and fuel, congestion in 437 urban areas
cost the nation about $78.2 billion
in 2005,” it reported. However, other
surveys have shown motorist resistance
to congestion pricing or anything else
that would raise the cost of automobile
travel.
The center favors reform of air traffic
control systems to allow pilots to fly
more direct routes and avoid lengthy
holding patterns and runway delays
so aircraft would save fuel and reduce
emissions. “The current governmentoperated air traffic control system,
based on a 1930s-era network of radio
beacons, hinders innovations that could
reduce fuel use and emissions. Specifically, allowing pilots to fly more direct
routes between destinations—so-called
‘free flight’—could save substantial
amounts of fuel and reduce aircraft
emissions by as much as 17%,” according to the report.
Meanwhile, it said, “Barring changes
in existing air travel regulations, the imposition of taxes or regulatory controls
to meet 1990 emission levels could
make it virtually impossible for US
airlines to meet the increasing demand
for air travel. The Air Transport Association estimates that reducing emissions
to 1990 levels would result in a 25-35%
reduction in air services.”
The report also favors reduction of
regulatory barriers to greater use of
nuclear power, reduction of wildfires
through alternative forest management
institutions, and the use of biotechnology to develop faster-growing trees that
can absorb and store large amounts of
carbon dioxide.

Where feds shouldn’t stray
For the push to impose federal regulation of
hydraulic fracturing, three possible motivations
exist:
• The practice exposes subsurface sources of
drinking water to risk and therefore should be
regulated.
• An exemption from federal regulation of
hydraulic fracing became law during the administration of former President George W. Bush and
therefore must be presumed environmentally
deficient.
• Hydraulic fracing is essential to unconventional gas resources and therefore should be resisted for its power to extend domestic supplies—and
therefore use—of hydrocarbon energy.
Even as it fights political assaults on many other
fronts, the US oil and gas producers must fight the
developing siege on all three levels.

Limited comprehension
The first motivation is sound in its core assertion but limited in its comprehension. Education
should represent sufficient response.
Hydraulic fracing does expose groundwater to
risk. Politicians and their constituents just learning
of the practice can find it alarming that producers
pump slurries underground via wells penetrating freshwater aquifers. When they learn about
proliferation of the method related to expansion
of unconventional gas plays, they submit easily to
fearmongering, such as that of Rep. Diana DeGette
(D-Colo.).
“This is a very serious issue,” she said recently
after disclosing that she and Maurice Hinchey
(D-NY) would introduce a bill repealing hydraulic
fracing’s exemption from the federal Safe Drinking
Water Act. “If it is not addressed, large numbers of
people are very likely to suffer. Their houses will
no longer be livable.”
In the absence of regulation, she might be
right. What she fails to tell the people she hopes
to frighten is that no such regulatory deficiency
looms. State and local governments regulate injection of frac and drilling fluids. They apparently
do so well. In more than half a century of underground fluid injection, no major contamination of
drinking water has occurred.
In 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency
published results of a comprehensive study of
underground injection of frac fluids into coalbed
16

methane wells, concluding that the practice “poses
minimal threat to [underground sources of drinking water].” Earlier this year, the Interstate Oil &
Gas Compact Commission, comprising state regulators, passed a resolution supporting the exemption of hydraulic fracing from federal regulation.
In 2002, IOGCC surveyed member states and
found no report of groundwater damage due to
hydraulic fracing. In its resolution this year, IOGCC
asserted that close to 1 million wells have been
hydraulically fraced in the US since the method
went into use more than 50 years ago “with no
known harm to groundwater.” And last month,
the Groundwater Protection Council reported
findings of a study, funded by the Department of
Energy, that found state regulation “are adequately
designed to directly protect water resources.”
To anyone concerned only about the safety
of drinking water, facts about the regulation and
safety record of hydraulic fracing should quell
pressure to add a federal layer of regulation. The
move would be unnecessary and wasteful. But
those other motives are at work.
It’s deceitful to smear hydraulic fracing’s exemption from federal regulation as a Bush environmental lapse. The exemption took effect in the
Energy Policy Act of 2005, which was hailed by
both major political parties as a triumph of bipartisanship. Since passage of the Safe Drinking Water
Act in 1974, the government never has seen the
need to apply the law to already-regulated hydraulic fracing. Indeed, the study EPA reported in 2004
began not during Bush’s term in office but during
that of his Democratic predecessor.

Raising cost
Federal regulation of hydraulic fracing would
add unnecessary cost to drilling—the American
Petroleum Institute estimates it at as much as
$100,000/well. And it would give drilling opponents another set of legal and administrative
opportunities to impede drilling.
Cost elevation and bureaucratic obstructionism
serve the interests only of those Americans who want
to abolish oil and gas in all its dimensions, in every
way possible, and at any cost. Most Americans know
those wishes are irrational and unbearably expensive.
Most Americans also recognize the dangers of
misguided regulation. Federal regulation of hydraulic fracing would be precisely that. ✦

The past year has been a challenging
one for the European refining industry,
particularly because of the drastic fluctuations of world oil prices. After peaking at
nearly $150/bbl in July 2008, oil prices
have fallen to a current level of $60-70/
bbl. Refiners had very good margins
where capacity and balances for gasoline
and diesel were rather tight at particular
points last year. Now falling margins for

fuel producers, high operating costs,
falling demand, and a supply glut in new
capacity are major problems. A string of
upgrades and conversion projects have
been postponed or canceled in light of
the global recession and the tightening of
credit availability (Fig. 1).

that the Western gasoline and diesel
markets are stabilizing after the slump
late last year. “In the US and Europe, the
gasoline and diesel markets collapsed in
the fourth quarter. We see signs of stabilization but it’s [still in the] very early
days. It could be due to seasonal factors
or destocking; we hope that we see the
signs correctly, it would be good news
if it stays like that.”

Depressed outlook
European refiners have been subdued
in presenting their recent financial results as well as their forecasts for 2009.
OMV AG, with refineries in central and
southeast Europe, identified its challenges as being lower oil prices, weakening refining margins, and depressed
demand.
Matti Lievonen, president and chief
executive officer of Neste Oil Corp.,
which has refineries in Finland, said,
“We have seen the largest drop in
demand in the diesel market, which is

€80 million isom unit, first announced
in 2008 and due for completion in
2011, was to have the capacity to
process 600,000 tonnes/year of existing gasoline fractions into premium
gasoline and increase the refinery’s total
gasoline output by 200,000 tonnes/
year.
Thomas D. O’Malley, Petroplus
Holding AG’s chairman, stated, “We
expect gasoline to be under the greatest
downward pressure during this period.
The middle distillate crack spread has
maintained its strength, but depending
on the length and severity of the global
recession, it could come under pressure.” O’Malley also views this downturn as a potential opportunity to pick
up cheap refineries.
While presenting Total SA’s yearend
2008 results, Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie said the
refining market faced the continuing
gasoline-diesel imbalance in the Atlantic
markets. The fall in US gasoline demand would impact Europe’s gasoline
20

exports, and there is a great need to
reduce refinery capacity to balance
product supply with consumer demand
(OGJ Online, Feb. 13, 2009) (Fig. 2).
Mike Wilcox, head of global downstream oil consulting at Wood Mackenzie Ltd., told OGJ, “The recession
coincided with a surge of capacity on
the market. So, with demand falling, we
believe that there were will be a global
mismatch of around 7 million b/d of
demand and refining capacity over the
next 2-3 years, and how the market will
react will vary by region. In Europe, we
expect margins this year to be significantly lower than 2007 and 2008. The
last downturn was in 2002, and the
fundamentals look worse now than
then; oil prices, however, are higher this
time round than in that period.”

Energy efﬁciency
Despite these pressures on refiners, ExxonMobil Corp. has continued
to invest in energy efficiency, taking a
long-term view of the cyclical nature of

the industry, said Darren Woods, ExxonMobil head of refineries in Europe, the
Middle East, and Africa. Speaking at the
inauguration of the company’s 125-Mw
cogeneration plant at its 305,000 b/d
refinery in Antwerp, Belgium, he said,
“We always work on the basis that there
will be periods when margins are low.
We make sure that we capture falling
costs through our the procurement
process.”
The company’s Antwerp facility,
which is Europe’s second-largest refinery, will be 12% more efficient because
of this investment. ExxonMobil has
specifically adapted the cogeneration
plant for its needs: As well as generating
steam, the plant uses a heat-recovery
system to utilize heat created in the
gas-turbine exhaust to warm crude oil.
With this 4-year project that cost more
than €100 million, ExxonMobil had
to construct the heat-recovery unit on
top of the gas turbine to which it is
connected rather than next to it because
space is so tight at the site.

Although the cogeneration unit
produces enough power to satisfy the
refinery’s requirements, ExxonMobil
still imports power for the refinery
from the national grid. The company
said the expected reliability of a singlegas turbine is less than that of the
national grid. The cogen plant also will
reduce Belgium’s carbon dioxide emissions by about 200,000 tpy, equivalent
to removing roughly 90,000 cars from
Europe’s roads.
“Energy efficiency is one of the
most effective tools available for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” said
Sherman Glass, ExxonMobil president
of refining and supply. “Since 2004,
ExxonMobil has invested in over 1,500
Mw of cogeneration capacity in five
countries,” he said.
With energy costs comprising as
much as half of a refinery’s costs, the
need for energy efficiency is imperative, said Richard Henderson, technical,
director at the Antwerp refinery. Net
operating costs also will fall because of

the cogeneration unit starting up, Henderson said. “The cogeneration plant
is a long-term investment that will last
for a minimum of 20-25 years. It will
provide Antwerp with a competitive
advantage well into the future relative
to alternate configurations. This is very
efficient compared with a conventional
stand-alone power station to run the
refinery,” he said.
Gilbert Asselman, manager of the
Antwerp refinery, said, “With the latest
technology, cogeneration is significantly
more efficient than traditional methods
of producing steam and power separately.”
According to the company’s analysis, oil products growth will average
1%/year during 2005-30 with diesel
demand driving most of this growth.
Gasoline demand will slow due to the
increase of biofuels, the company said.
“ExxonMobil wants to grow its diesel
pool, and we’re working on tuning our
operations to do this,” said ExxonMobil’s Woods.

In 2010, ExxonMobil also plans to
start up its high-pressure hydrotreater
at Antwerp, which will help increase
the refinery’s output of low-sulfur
diesel, a large amount of which will be
exported.

Tighter fuel standards
According to Europia, the trade association representing European refiners,
more than $8 billion/year is invested in
their operations. The cost of investing
over the long term is rising because of
the legislation to cut sulfur levels in refined products—particularly in gasoline
and diesel—as governments and policymakers are increasingly concerned
about the environment.
Producing fuels from lower-quality
crude is another issue that refiners are
grappling with. If oil prices rise in the
next few years, as they did in 2008,
refiners are more likely to process lessexpensive, higher-sulfur content crudes.
Neste Oil, for example, has turned
its attention to developing a €670 mil-

Snapshot of Europe’s reﬁnery upgrades, modernization plans
Below are some operators’ plans
to upgrade or expand their reﬁning
operations in Europe in 2009-12. This
is not intended to be a comprehensive list.
Total SA
As the largest reﬁner in western
Europe, Total operates 11 reﬁneries and also holds interests in the
Schwedt, reﬁnery in Germany and in
four reﬁneries in Spain. It has dedicated nearly €1.6 billion/year during
2009-13 to address the diesel shortage in Europe, tighter fuel speciﬁcations, and a rise in supplying high-sulfur crudes. In 2015, diesel production
by Total’s European reﬁneries will
be up 13 million tonnes over 2005,
representing a 50% increase.
Work at Total’s 200,000-b/d Lindsay, UK, reﬁnery includes:
• Installation by yearend of a 1
million tonne/year hydrodesulfurization unit (HDS) and a steam methane
reformer to increase the processing
of high-sulfur crudes to 70% from
10% and boost low-sulfur diesel
production. Both the HDS unit and
steam methane reformer will cost
€300 million.
Work was suspended in February for more than a week following
a strike by employees because the
subcontractor, Irem SPA, had employed foreign labor for jobs instead
of locals (OGJ Online, Feb. 2, 2009).

CBO says HR 2454 would add $846 billion in taxes

many other businesses that rely on oil to
make or transport products,” Gerard said.

A US House bill that would introduce
a domestic carbon emissions cap-andtrade program would cost $846 billion
in new taxes, the Congressional Budget
Office said on June 5.
CBO analyzed HR 2454, the 2009
American Clean Energy and Security. The
House Energy and Commerce Committee
approved HR2454 on May 21 by 33 to
25 votes.
The bill’s net contribution to the federal budget would be about $24 billion
because the bill would increase direct federal spending by $821 billion, CBO said.
“In addition, assuming appropriation
of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates
that implementing HR 2454 would
increase discretionary spending by about
$50 billion over the 2010-19 period,” it
indicated. Most of that would come from
auction proceeds outlined in the bill.
CBO also said that mandates under the
bill would exceed thresholds under the
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act by $139
million for private sector entities and $69
million for intergovernmental outlays in
2009.
American Petroleum Institute Pres. Jack
N. Gerard said on June 8 that the analysis
confirmed the bill would be “massively
costly.”
“The $846 billion price tag on emission allowances, borne disproportionately
by oil consumers, will drive up costs of
producing and refining gasoline, diesel,
and other fuel products while doing
nothing to protect fuel consumers, including American families, trucking, the
airlines, the construction industry, and

API: ‘A job-killer’
API said that based on allowance
costs in CBO’s study, impacts could be as
much as 77¢/gal for gasoline, 83¢/gal
for jet fuel, and 88¢/gal for diesel fuel.
“This is what happens when marketbased regulation is abandoned in favor
of picking winners and losers,” Gerard
said. “Putting most of the burden on
one sector also helps explain why this
legislation promises to be a job-killer.”
The bill was cosponsored by Reps.
Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), chairman
of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.),
chairman of the committee’s Energy
and Environment Subcommittee.
While opening a June 9 hearing on
the bill’s offsets, Waxman said that it
uses more than half of its allowances to
protect consumers from higher energy
prices with programs for electricity,
natural gas, and heating oil users, for
low and moderate-income families, and
to provide rebates to consumers.
HR 2454 invests in developing and
deploying energy efficiency programs
and clean energy technology, which
will create jobs, he continued. It also
provides transition assistance to US industries to assure that they stay globally
competitive, he said.
“The committee has worked hard on
this allocation plan to ensure that it is fair.
It does what a good energy bill needs
to do. It balances the interest of different parts of the country, and of different
stakeholders, and accomplishes much of
what is important to everyone. It will go

a long way to moving the country into a
clean energy future,” Waxman said.
But the committee’s ranking minority member, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.),
said that it’s not possible to design an
allocation for an economy as complex
as that of the US. “You really can’t make
it fair,” he declared.

More industry reaction
A group of larger US independent
producers warned on June 8 that the
bill includes provisions that undermine
its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
by possibly discouraging natural gas
use.
Rod Lowman, president of America’s
Natural Gas Alliance said, “The allowance allocation formula in the bill could
eliminate the incentive to burn fuels
with a lower carbon content for power
generation.”
HR 2454 initially would distribute
for free 50% of its utility allowances
based on the utility’s average annual
carbon dioxide emissions from retail
electricity sales, Lowman said. This provides a disincentive for utilities to buy
electricity from generators using gas or
other cleaner fuels, he said.
Lowman said allowance allocations
should instead reward utilities that
acquire power from fossil fuel generators
that have the lowest emissions per megawatt hour and are also the most efficient.
“The allocation policy for allowances
should complement the bill’s environmental goals, not cancel out the distinction between high and low carbon
fossil fuels for generating electricity.
Such an approach to us seems counterproductive,” he said. ✦

Calls for calm
amid hyperbole

US

Rep. Martin T. Heinrich (DNM) tried to cool things off
when he was finally recognized at the
House Natural Resources Committee’s Energy and Mineral Resources
subcommittee hearing on June 4.
The discussion of unconventional
natural gas production had turned
into a battle over hydraulic fracturing. Proponents for bringing the
technology’s regulation back under the federal Safe Drinking Water
Act said it poses a risk to drinking
water supplies otherwise. Opponents
argued that this would add a layer of
redundant regulation as producers
were beginning to tap an abundant
new domestic gas resource.
Heinrich essentially suggested that
it was time for people to step back
and take a deep breath. “We should
get at this less from politics and
more from science and technology.
My concern is how these fluids are
handled once they reach the surface
and how we’re safely disposing of
them,” he said.
“Most state water directors would
recognize two critical elements: construction of the well and handling of
fluids on the surface,” said Scott Kell,
one of the witnesses and president of
the Ground Water Protection Council.
This has led to requiring storage of
drilling and other production fluids in
lead-lined storage tanks and the fluids’
reinjection deep underground, he said.

Best practices
The council’s recommendations
include studying the most effective
hydraulic fracturing procedures to
develop best management practices
for each state.
“A one-size-fits-all federal pro26

gram is not the most effective way
to regulate in this area,” said Kell,
who also is deputy minerals resource
management division chief in Ohio’s
Department of Natural Resources.
Zones close to underground drinking water sources, as determined by a
state’s regulating agency, would be of
special concern, Kell said.
The subcommittee’s chairman,
US Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.), asked
Kell and the four other witnesses if
they knew of any best management
practices which might be applicable.
None of them did. So I put Costa’s
question to the American Petroleum
Institute, which has an active standards and practices program, on
June 8.

Several approaches
“We don’t have a practice specifically targeted at hydraulic fracturing,” said Richard L. Ranger, an API
senior policy advisor, adding, “Ours
deal with drilling, and we’re reviewing practice documents we have
including well construction and site
stewardship and management.”
Ranger said GWPC’s recent study,
which did not link contamination
with hydraulic fracturing, was only
the latest of several to reach that conclusion. “Contamination incidents are
associated with the surface, and not
what goes on below,” he said.
Ranger said he suspects that some
assertions simply roll up spill reports
and other incidents and blame
them on hydraulic fracturing. API,
meanwhile, continues its recommended standards and practices on
well construction and environmental
operations, and is looking at its site
maintenance standard, he said. ✦

Two leading US oil industry trade
associations asked the US Environmental
Protection Agency on June 9 to consider
delaying for a year the implementation
of the new renewable fuel standards.
“Given the extremely complex and
first-of-a-kind nature associated with
this rulemaking, it seems that promulgation of final rules by EPA and necessary preparations by impacted industries will not be able to meet a Jan. 1,
2010, implementation date,” Al Mannato, fuels manager for the American
Petroleum Institute, testified at an EPA
hearing on the proposed regulation.
“This rulemaking should not be
rushed,” added Greg Scott, executive
vice-president and general counsel at
the National Petrochemical & Refiners
Association. “As noted, [EPA] took considerable care in drafting the proposal.
Stakeholders such as NPRA need to take
similar care in examining the proposal;
analyzing its potential impacts on our
industry, consumers, and the economy
as a whole; and then drafting meaningful, informed and responsive comments
to the agency.”
The current US renewable fuel standard (RFS) was established under the
2005 Energy Security Act. Congress made
several important revisions to it when it
passed the 2007 Energy Independence
and Security Act, including expanding
coverage to diesel and off-highway fuels,
establishing greenhouse gas reduction
thresholds, and increasing renewable
volume standards, according to EPA.
Scott said NPRA does not believe
it can properly review the proposals
under the proposed second RFS during
the existing comment period, and has
joined API in formally asking EPA for
at least 60 additional days. Even if the

federal regulator grants the request,
NPRA also thinks EPA won’t be able to
adequately meet a Jan. 1, 2010, deadline, he continued.
“It took the agency almost 18
months to develop this proposal, and
there are sure to be thousands, if not
tens of thousands, of public comments
on the proposal. It is hard to believe
that the agency can give adequate and
fair consideration to these public comments and meet this ambitious sched-

ule,” Scott said.
Stakeholders also will need sufficient time to digest the final new rule
and plan for compliance, he added.
The first RFS was informally released in
mid-April 2007 and became effective
four and a half months later on Sept.
1, he said. “Clearly, the RFS-2 regulations, when finalized, will be far more
complex than the RFS-1 rule and will
require more lead time for compliance,” he suggested.

Mannato said it is critically important that obligated parties and all others
involved in the RFS, such as biofuel
producers and distributors, also have
time to prepare for implementation
of the proposed standard’s complex
four-tier mandate. “Also, the compliance issues associated with a partial year
program should rule out that possibility. Therefore, it appears that the only
option that is feasible is a Jan. 1, 2011,
start date,” he said. ✦

Since last week, oil workers have

a point that raised the ire of government officials.

Trinidad eyes gas pipeline
extension to Barbados
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Even as it proceeds with plans to
spend upwards of $155 million to construct a natural gas pipeline to its sister
island of Tobago, Trinidad says it is still
considering an extension of the line
onward to Barbados.
The pipeline from Trinidad to Tobago
is due for startup by first-quarter 2011,
according to Arnold De Four, vicepresident for commercial services of
Trinidad and Tobago’s National Gas Co.
(NGC).
Meanwhile, De Four said Trinidad
is awaiting a go ahead from the Barbados government, which is concerned
about the project’s financial viability, on
the proposal to extend the pipeline to
Bridgetown.
Although an extension of the line
would add another market for the sale
of Trinidad and Tobago’s gas, Barbados,
which recently passed key legislation
regarding hydrocarbons, is hoping to
discover oil and gas of its own.

he oil and gas industry will not
be surprised to learn that resurgent nationalism is killing Venezuela.
That view is increasingly evident
to all but a few observers—most of
them named Chavez.
In case anyone does need a
reminder, though, a former Venezuelan minister of mines and energy
underlined problems facing the Latin
American country due to its misguided policies.
“I believe that the government’s
level of spending, combined with this
entire process of nationalizing businesses, is placing Venezuela in a difficult situation from the financial point
of view,” said Humberto Calderon.
Calderon, who also is a former
president of state-owned Petroleos de
Venezuela SA (PDVSA), told Mexico’s
Notimex news agency that the recovery in international crude prices could
be offset in Venezuela by declining
production after the recent expropriation of 76 petroleum companies.
The former minister said these
companies had been involved in
activities like gas and steam injection in oil fields or in operating
oil platforms—operations that he
described as “extremely complex and
that require a high degree of specialization.”

in oil prices would enable his country
to cope with the global financial crisis
without any major difficulties.
But Calderon estimated that Venezuela’s financial difficulties are far from
over, as the state has unpaid debts along
with a high level of spending due to
Chavez’s nationalization policies.
“I simply cannot understand the
government’s motivations for nationalizing companies,” Calderon said, adding, “Last year, Electricidad de Caracas
had losses for the first time in its history, and Orinoco Steel is bankrupt, as
are other metalworking companies.”

Hara-kiri?

Calderon, a geologist, said what is
so serious about this situation is that
Venezuela’s government will now have
to use part of its resources to keep
these companies afloat, something that
he described as “economic hara-kiri.”
His reference to Japanese-style
suicide was timely as investors in the
Asian nation are increasingly concerned about the nationalization in
Venezuela, and they have good cause
for concern, according to a report by
the Nikkei Business Daily (NBD).
When Venezuelan Chavez visited
Japan in April, the paper noted, he
signed a comprehensive accord with
Tokyo over the development of natural resources.

shore drilling since the 1990s, when a
study by Conoco Inc. noted promise in
nearby areas. Barbados solicited its first
bids in 2007, eventually offering 26
offshore blocks for oil and gas exploration in 2008.
In July 2008, as the bidding process
was under way, Venezuela complained
that Barbados was auctioning areas that
would penetrate Venezuela’s continental
shelf in the Caribbean.
“This is an absolutely irregular situation so we’re communicating with the
foreign ministry, which is taking action,”
said Venezuelan Energy Minister Rafael
Ramirez. “What is most important is

T E R E S T
that no one have any doubts that we will
make our sovereignty respected.”
In January, Barbados awarded rights
to just two blocks, both to BHP Billiton:
the 2,498-sq-km Carlisle Bay block and
the 2,506-sq-km Bimshire block.
Despite Venezuela’s belligerent
stance, Philmore Best, deputy permanent secretary of Barbados’ energy
ministry, said the former British colony
still plans to open as many as 26 blocks
for exploration.
Andre Brathwaite, Natural Resources
Department director, said the Caribbean
nation plans to negotiate directly with
international oil companies instead of

using a bid round.
Barbados produces just 1,100 b/d of
its own oil from onshore wells. Barbados National Oil Co. sends the crude to
Trinidad and Tobago for refining, after
which it is brought back to Barbados.
BNOC’s production represents just
15% of Barbados’ fuel requirements,
with the remaining 85% filled by imports.
Like its neighbor Trinidad and
Tobago, Barbados has rejected offers
by Caracas to join the PetroCaribe plan
under which Venezuela’s state-owned
Petroleos de Venezuela SA offers lowpriced crude under long-term payment
plans. ✦

Alaskan ofﬁcials respond to Begich comment on gas line
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Alaskan officials defended the state’s
plan to build a natural gas pipeline
from the North Slope to Alberta after
US Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alas.) said the
Obama administration is frustrated that
the project isn’t farther along.
Begich told a business audience June
2 in Anchorage that he would like US
President Barack Obama to elevate the
pipeline on the national energy agenda
instead of treating it as a state project,
according to an Associated Press report.
He said that Obama has indicated that
the project is among the top five he
would like to see move forward.
Alaska Gov. Sarah H. Palin said on
June 3 that substantial progress has
been made as two competing projects
move ahead. “I am so very proud of
our gas line team, which works hard
every day to make progress on this vital
project for our state. With no need for
grandstanding, they have moved this
project along with stakeholders and
federal regulators, and that is going to
pay enormous dividends in the future,”
she said.
Two state commissioners said in a
letter to Begich that they were disappointed by his comments. Noting that it
30

would be the biggest and most complex
private sector undertaking in history,
Revenue Commissioner Patrick S. Galvin
and Natural Resources Commission
Thomas E. Irwin said that its lead time
must be measured in years instead of
months.
“However, every day the Alaska gas
pipeline project is making significant
progress toward becoming a reality.
That progress is the result of bipartisan
actions taken in Congress and in the
Alaska State Legislature in the past, actions that must continue to be bipartisan in the future,” they said.
They said that the Alaska Gasline
Inducement Act was designed to protect
values critical to state and national
interests by providing for lower tariffs
on the pipeline, ensuring expansion op-

portunities for new gas discoveries, and
protecting against basin control. Alaska’s
legislature expressed bipartisan support
for these values, including Democrats
who voted unanimously for the measure, Galvin and Irwin said.
“Further, President Obama has been
supportive of the Alaska gas pipeline
project from the very beginning of his
presidential campaign to the present,
and we applaud that support. Also, we
have heard nothing from him or members of his administration that reflects
frustration with the significant progress
that is now occurring. Finally, an overwhelming majority of Democrats and
Republicans in Congress have supported
the pipeline as an essential element of a
comprehensive energy policy,” they said
in their letter. ✦

the study by IHS Global Insight, “Measuring the Economics and Energy Impacts of Proposals to Regulate Hydraulic
Fracturing.”
API released the study as US Sen. Bob
Casey (D-Pa.) said he would sponsor
companion legislation to the bill which
Reps. Diana DeGette (D-Colo), Maurice
D. Hinchey (D-NY), and Jared Polis
(D-Colo) introduced on June 9 to bring
hydraulic fracturing back under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.
The well completion process, which
producers say is essential to produce
oil from the Bakken shale and gas

from the Marcellus and other US shale
formations, was exempted from SDWA
enforcement under the 2005 Energy
Policy Act.
“Drilling for natural gas in the
Marcellus shale across much of Pennsylvania is part of our future. I believe
that we have an obligation to develop
that gas responsibly to safeguard the
drinking water wells used by 3 million
Pennsylvanians,” Casey said.
“We already have private wells contaminated by gas and fluids used in hydraulic fracturing. We need to make sure
that this doesn’t become a statewide

problem over the next few decades as
we extract natural gas,” he continued.
Eliminating hydraulic fracturing
would be catastrophic to US oil and gas
development, resulting in 79% fewer
well completions and drops of 45% in
US gas production and 17% in oil production by 2014, the IHS Global Insight
study found, according to API.
“More than 1 million wells have
been completed using this technology.
Unnecessary regulation of this practice
would only hurt the nation’s energy
security and threaten our economy,” API
Pres. Jack N. Gerard said. ✦

Unconventional gas and oil plays
represent the future for EnCana Corp.
and the North American oil and gas
industry, EnCana said May 27.
EnCana has established a portfolio of nine gas and four enhanced
oil resource plays, said Jeff Wojahn,
executive vice-president and president
of EnCana’s USA division. Wojahn and
other principals discussed its positions
in the high-pressure,
high-temperature
established Jurassic
Deep Bossier sand and
emerging Haynesville
plays in East Texas and
North Louisiana (Fig.
1).
Gas deliveries by all operators have
grown to more than 7 bcfd in January 2009 from 2 bcfd in January 2006
from the Barnett, Fayetteville, Woodford, and Haynesville shales alone, EnCana said. Of that, the Barnett supplies
about 5 bcfd.
North America consumes about 25
tcf/year of gas, and close to half of that
comes from unconventional reservoirs
including tight sands, shales, and coalbed methane, the company noted.
The Deep Bossier play in East Texas

EnCana banking heavily
on unconventional gas, oil

has the best returns in EnCana, and the
Haynesville could become the company’s leading resource play, said Paul
Sander, vice-president, Midcontinent
business unit.

Haynesville shale
EnCana, like many operators, has a
2009 priority to demonstrate the commerciality of its Haynesville shale acreage and hone its strategy to drill and
prove its holding.
EnCana has diverted $290 million
of its 2009 budget to retain land in
the Haynesville play, most of it in the
company’s core area in Red River and
De Soto parishes.
Efforts to prove and hold acreage are
likely contributing to the current rig
count of 75-80 rigs in the Haynesville,
EnCana said. Nevertheless, only a few
Haynesville wells have more than 6
months of production history.
In the Haynesville, EnCana has divided its drilling staff into teams each
responsible for a particular section of
hole. The company has drilled 16 horizontal Haynesville wells.
EnCana has stepped up efforts to
multiply and enlarge its Haynesville frac
stages after noticing a direct relation-

Shale gas acreage, European database draw interest
Companies are seeking permits for
shale gas prospects in southeast France
in Languedoc Roussillon, the Cevennes
mountains region, and the Savoie area
near the Swiss border.
Total E&P France SA-Devon, Mouvoil
SA, Bridgeoil Ltd., and Diamoco Energy
are among the firms competing for the
Ales, Bassin d’Ales, Plaine d’Ales, and
Montelimar permits. They are competing with the Cevennes and Navacelles
permits requested in 2008 by Egdon
Resources Ltd. (also being eyed by Eagle
Energy Ltd. and YCI Resources Ltd.) and
by Cevennes Petroleum Development
Ltd.
French authorities plan to assess the
competing proposals for overlapping

shale acreage onshore north of the Gulf
of Lion and make an award in October
2009.
“There is much shale gas in France,”
said Francois Laurant, in charge of shale
gas at Institut Francais du Petrole. “It
has been seeping for centuries around
the town of Grenoble in midsoutheastern France. But the disputed areas
hold black shale in shallower ground
than elsewhere in France like the Paris
basin,” he added.
East Paris Petroleum Development
Ltd. requested the Moselle permit in
Lorraine, in northeastern France, targeting both shale gas and coalbed methane.
Charles Lamiraux, chief geologist

at France’s Environment and Energy
Ministry in charge of exploration, said
while targeting shale gas, companies
could well find conventional gas and
heavy oil.

Shale gas prospects abound
France is not the only country in
Europe in which shale gas is arousing
interest.
The Potsdam-based GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences designed
and coordinated what it describes as the
“first and biggest and most comprehensive” study on shale gas in Europe.
Brian Horsfield, one of the main
collaborators in the Gash (German for
shale gas) study, said the study was an

northern Kazakhstan’s border with Russia.
The Caspian unit of MOL Hungarian
Oil & Gas Co., operating shareholder
with 27.5% interest in Ural Oil, said
the Zhaik-1 well went to 5,844 m and
recovered oil and gas-condensate from
presalt Lower Permian and Carboniferous carbonates. The liquid hydrocarbons
were 46° gravity and had no measurable sulfur or hydrogen sulfide.
The hole’s lowermost 400 m were
drilled with slimhole technology, and
only small amounts of fluids were recovered. MOL said.

A study examined
structure removal costs
in the Gulf of Mexico for
operations performed
by TETRA Technologies
Inc. from 2003 through
Production
June 2008. The data set
included 120 projects
representing $178 million in expenditures and is one of the largest samples
of decommissioning costs analyzed in
the gulf.
The study used standard statistical
analysis, and we believe the statistical
measures are representative of the removal cost of independent operators in
the shallow-water gulf during 2003-08.
The study reports costs for preparation, pipeline abandonment, and
removal operations across several
categories.
Decommissioning represents the end
of the production life cycle of offshore
structures and involves plugging and
abandoning wells, removing infrastructure, and clearing debris from the site.
Removal of the topsides equipment,
deck, conductors, piles, and jacket is the
core of all decommissioning projects
and typically is the most expensive.

across activity and categories depends
on the requirement of the job and a
company’s accounting system.
We grouped costs into three main
categories (structure preparation,
pipeline abandonment, and structure
removal) and allocated in proportion
to effort the activities that overlapped
categories.

Structure
preparation

Gulf of Mexico structure
removal costs examined

After completion
of well plugging and
abandonment activities,
normally a crew paid
on a day rate prepares
a structure for removal.
Caissons and well protectors typically
require little or no preparation, but
fixed platform removal usually requires
the dispatching of crews for inspections, cleanup, and cutting operations.
An inspection above and sometimes
below water determines the condition
of the structure and identifies potential
problems with the salvage. Depending
on the water depth, divers or remotely
operated vehicles perform the inspection. Divers can operate effectively
down to 300 ft of water.

Total cost

Structure installation

Table 12 shows the total cost for
removing a caisson, well protector,
or fixed platform. This total includes
caisson and well protector removal and
pipeline abandonment and fixed platform preparation, pipeline abandonment, and removal cost.
We grouped caissons and well
protectors together because they have
reasonably similar functional characteristics and often do not require preparatory activity.
For caissons and well protectors,
the total removal cost ranges from
$686,000 (0-100 ft) to $1.5 million (101-200 ft). For fixed platforms,
average removal cost ranges from $1.1
million (0-100 ft) to $3.5 million
(201-300 ft).

Removal operations are essentially
the reverse of installation activities.
The cost to remove a structure should
therefore approximate installation cost
for similar structures in similar water
depth categories.
For 2003 to 2008, TETRA Technologies installed 20 structures: 3 caissons,
5 well protectors, and 12 fixed platforms. The sample is small and is used
for illustrative purposes.
The average cost (Table 14) to install
a caisson ranges between $534,000 (0100 ft) to $833,000 (101-200 ft). Well
protectors and fixed platforms exhibit
more similarities in installation expenditures than for removal operations,
probably due to the pile driving and
barge requirements.
For jacket structures, installation cost
ranges from $1 million (0-100 ft) to
$2.8 million (201-300 ft), reasonably
consistent with the structure removal
costs (Table 5).

Weight
The maximum load weights expected during the operation determines
the minimum derrick barge required to
remove a structure. Engineers estimate
this weight using blueprint specifications and physical characteristics of the
structure and derrick barge such as lift
capacity, boom length, deck size, and
jacket length.
Weight correlations depend on data
availability and quality. We focus on the
total weight relationship. In removal
operations, the heaviest lift weight will
determine the derrick barge required.
For structures in deep water, jacket
weights tend to dominate.
As foundations transect a larger water column, the deck-to-jacket weight
ratio will decrease if the deck weight
remains constant. For fixed platforms
in shallow water, deck weight usually
dominates jacket weight, but as water
depth increases, jacket weights will
often exceed deck weight.
Table 13 shows the average removal
cost as a function of total deck, jacket,
pile, and conductor weight. Caisson

will always be uncertain because of

In the late 1970s and early 1980s
Europe experienced the same dramatic
reduction in fuel oil demand as did the
US. The level of conversion in European
refineries, however, did not develop
to the same extent as in the US. This
period coincided with the rapid build
up of North Sea crude production, and
the European refiners were able to shift
their slates away from heavier Middle
East and West African crude to the
lighter and sweeter North Sea grades.
This move, coupled with increasing
demand for bunker fuel, allowed many
refiners to avoid the expense of residuedestruction investment. Only those
inland refineries that are away from the
bunker market and have no easy access
to North Sea crude have had to invest to
convert fuel oil.
As a result the average Nelson Complexity of European refineries of 7.3 is
below that of US refineries (Fig. 2).
The ownership structure of the
European refining industry has evolved
extensively over the last 2 decades.

Historically, most of the capacity was
owned by either the international majors or by national or regional companies. Fig. 3 shows there are only a small
number of independents.
The years between 1995 and 2008
saw a marked reduction in capacity
attributed to regional and European
national companies. This was in part
due to the privatization of some of the
nationally based companies in Eastern Europe and also to the series of
large acquisitions that resulted in Total
becoming an international major rather
than a national player.
Despite some initial aggressive acquisition policies the national oil companies of the oil producing countries
made few inroads into Europe. Only
Kuwait, Libya (through Oilinvest), and
PDVSA remain, with Saudi Aramco in
2005 selling its only acquisition, a share
in Motor Oil (Hellas). Ownership of
investment funds controlled by the governments of oil producing countries has
been excluded from consideration here.

Following are the three main challenges facing the industry:
• Adapting to the changing demand
patterns, both in Europe and in its trading partners.
• Participating in European efforts to
reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
• Adjusting to the effects of future
product-quality legislation.

Changing demand
Through the 1980s and early 1990s,
the European industry focused on configuring to meet the growing demand
for motor gasoline.
By 1997 gasoline demand peaked
and has been in decline since. The
decline was in part due to the well-documented switch to diesel-powered cars
by European drivers. Although sales of
gasoline cars are beginning to recover
in some markets, higher fuel prices will
continue to drive consumers to diesel
until such time as alternative power
trains are developed.
Even without the shift to diesel cars,

stringent fuel economy standards being
set by the EU would lead to a decline
in gasoline use. Although subject to
further revision, the objective agreed
with motor manufacturers is 130 g/km
CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to a
gasoline consumption of 38 mpg (6.12
l./100 km). This represents a 19% reduction from the 2006 level. A further
decrease under discussion targets 95 g/
km CO2 in 2020, equivalent to 50 mpg.
The result is an outlook that shows a
continuing decline in gasoline consumption and moderate growth in
middle distillates. Jet kerosine that had
grown strongly up to 2008 is suffering from the present recession; future
growth will be slower. Although there
are growing concerns about the GHG
emitted by aviation, the public desire
for air travel, fuelled by low-cost airline
expansion, is likely to prevail.
The forecast shows a gradual further
decline in use of heating gasoil as
the natural gas networks expand but
continuing growth for diesel fuel in
transportation. Despite a boost to con46

sumption that is being driven by diesel
cars, more than 70% of diesel use is for
commercial vehicles. Fig. 4 shows the
forecast changes in demand 2007-20.
The challenge European refiners
face is to manage a growing surplus of
gasoline while meeting an increased
demand for middle distillates. Fig. 4
compares the anticipated demand for
Europe with yields from hydroskimming Brent crude and the typical yield
from a catalytic cracking refinery, still
the dominant configuration in Europe.
The magnitude of the gasoline mismatch is immediately apparent.
The fall in gasoline demand in
Europe coincided with a period of
rapid growth in the US, hence the trade
of gasoline and gasoline components
across the Atlantic. Gasoline trade grew

from around 150,000 b/d in 2000.
Through this period, European demand
declined by 500,000 b/d, resulting in a
balance between export volume growth
and domestic demand decline.
The future looks more difficult. The

2007 US Energy Independence and
Security Act will substantially increase
the volumes of nonpetroleum gasoline
used in the US, and more importantly it
requires significant efficiency improvements from the vehicle fleet. There are
indications from the administration of
US President Barack Obama that emissions standards may be tightened further. This scenario couples with Purvin
& Gertz’s long-term oil price outlook
that is likely to promote voluntary conservation.
The result of a declining export market for gasoline and declining domestic
demand will be considerable pressure
on the entire European refining industry and may result in closure of some
marginal capacity. All refiners will see an
economic incentive to minimize gasoline production; some may consider
replacing FCC units with hydrocrackers.
The need to increase middle distillate
imports would support such a move.
On the middle distillate side, the picture is a great deal happier for European
refiners. The region continues to be

Russian imports suppressed refinery
processing in Europe because they were
available at lower cost than they could
be produced. Now consumption has
grown to a level that Europe depends
on imports.
Considerable investment will be
required in the region to supply the
relatively modest growth that is forecast. Even with a continuing investment
program, imports will rise further (Fig.

beginning of Phase 2, emission units
started trading at more than €20/tonne
of CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions,
but prices have fallen to near €15/
tonne of CO2e as a result of the recession.
In Phase 2, the scope of the program
has expanded in several ways. Three
non-EU European countries—Norway,
Iceland, and Liechtenstein—have joined
the program. The aviation sector will be
brought under the program in 2012.
And emissions of new GHG, nitrous oxides, and perfluorocarbons were added
to the program.
For Phase 3, still being defined, there
is some remaining uncertainty about
details of the program beyond 2012.
The most recent details concerning
Phase 3 were adopted by the European
Council in April 2009.
The objective of the Phase 3 is to reduce CO2e emissions by 20% by 2020,
compared with 1990 levels. Considering that verified 2005 emissions were
1% greater than 1990 levels, the EU will
need to reduce CO2e emissions by 21%
between 2005 and 2020.

ity generation sector will be required
to buy 100% of its emission offsets
through auctions.
• Other regulated industries will
be put in on transitional program,
whereby they will initially be given an
allocation of free emissions equivalent
to 80% of their average 2005-07 emissions, and will be required either to
reduce emissions by 20% or buy emission credits. The free allocations would
be progressively reduced by equal
amounts each year, declining to 30%
of 2005-07 emissions by 2020 and to
zero by 2027.
• Industries deemed to be exposed
to carbon “leakage” would continue
to receive free allocations but would
be subject to energy efficiency benchmarks. The definitions of leakage have
been set, and there is now an effort
under way to determine which industry
segments are deemed to be exposed to
leakage.
The ETS is only one item of what is
referred to as the “Climate Package.” It
is generally recognized that the objectives of the EU ETS program will be
very difficult to meet without significant contributions from renewables
and from the commercial deployment
of carbon capture and sequestration.
For this reason, the package includes a
renewables directive and a proposal for
a directive to promote CCS.
Other items of the package concern
new vehicle efficiency targets referred
to previously and policies aimed at improving energy efficiency in agricultural
and residential sectors.
At the anticipated levels of carbon
cost, the potential increase in operating
cost for a European refinery that would
have to purchase 100% of its required
emissions permits would be substantial. Purvin & Gertz has analyzed the
impact on its hydrocracking benchmark
refinery at various levels of carbon cost
(Fig. 7).
The anticipated range of carbon cost
once a large proportion of credits is
auctioned is expected to be €30-45/
tonne. At this level, refinery operating
cost would be substantially increased.

It is clear that this level of cost could
not be recovered from the market. Europe already must attract middle distillate imports to balance its supply needs
and must export gasoline and fuel oil.
It’s possible the prices of these commodities will be set in locations that
will not see the additional cost, such as
the Middle East.
The magnitude of the price increase
required to recover the carbon cost for
the refinery is far more than the freight
costs that might be incurred by an
importer. Coincidently, if for example
the product came from the Middle East,
the carbon emissions from the shipping
would be almost the same as the refinery emission to produce the incremental fuel. Thus, European refiners would
be penalized for no benefit to the global
climate.
This illustrates the care that regulations must take to ensure that “unintended consequences” don’t negate
what is trying to be achieved.

Product quality
The final challenge facing European
refiners is the continued tightening of
refined-product quality.
Since the mid-1990s, successive
regulations have sought to improve the
quality of fuels used in the EU. The benefit to air quality, particularly in urban
areas, is readily apparent. Gasoline and
diesel fuel have become almost designer
products containing no sulfur and low
levels of aromatics and olefins.
The sulfur part of the EU’s liquid
fuels directive mandates the use of low
sulfur (<1%) fuel oil inland, unless
the sulfur emissions are captured, and
reduces the sulfur content of heating
gas oil to 0.1%. A subsequent amendment imposes a lower sulfur content
on the fuel used in off-road machinery
(10 ppm) and domestic marine sectors (300 ppm, reducing to 10 ppm in
2012).
As hydrotreating capacity in the
region is fully utilized, the increase in
the volume required to be desulfur-

The drop to 0.1% sulfur and 0.5%,
however, is much more challenging.
At this level, reblending will not be
an option because there are limited
volumes of crudes available that meet
the lower sulfur level. Current technology is unable to reduce the sulfur of
residues to 0.1% unless very low sulfur
feed is used. Even if technology were to
develop to achieve this, the likelihood
is that the cost would be equivalent to
converting the fuel oil to lighter, more
valuable fuels. Refiners that could afford
to invest would simply leave the bunker
market.
Some bunker fuel could be produced
at 0.5% sulfur by segregating the residues from very low sulfur crudes. Once
again, however, desulfurization would
be required to meet the limit and even
at this level, the cost would be prohibitive and refiners would preferentially
invest to convert rather than just remove
sulfur.
In Europe the change would be
exacerbated by the lack of alternative
outlets for the high-sulfur components.
Refiners would be faced with having
either to change crude slate, export
high-sulfur components to the few remaining and rather distant markets that
would be able to accept them, or make
a major investment.
Unlike other specification changes
such as the reduction of diesel sulfur, the investment cost to desulfurize
or convert residue is very large and
location-specific and requires economy
of scale. A typical hydrocracking plus
coker complex with associated units can
cost in the order of $2 billion, a sum
that is beyond the financing capability of many smaller regional refineries.
Purvin & Gertz has studied the proposals and calculated the range of compliance investment for European refiners
lies between $20 and $25 billion.
The investment required to supply
the higher quality bunker fuels would
push up prices into the range of middle
distillate. Consequently the most likely
outcome is that refiners convert fuel oil
to distillates. The fuel cost to shipowners will rise dramatically. The higher

intensity of processing in refineries will
cause an increase in CO2 emissions that
governments struggling to meet national emissions reduction targets will
find burdensome.
Lastly, the possibility that on-board
scrubbers may be widely adopted adds
to the uncertainty surrounding the
regulation. The potential investment is
huge and the lead time correspondingly
long. The refining and shipping industries along with the regulators need
to come to an understanding soon on
future action if the IMO timetable is to
be met. ✦

tion results in good agreement with
the experimental results, verifying the
models usability in predicting hydrateformation conditions on the West-East
Gas Pipeline.
Fig. 4 shows hydrate-forming temperature of 283.15-293.15 K. when
the pipeline operates between 7 and 10
MPa. Once free water exists in a pipeline hydrates may be formed, requiring
its exclusion regardless of operating
conditions. The temperature of gas in
the pipeline equals the temperature of
soil in situ (Table 3).

Hydrate prevention
Hydrate formation requires free
water in the pipeline. All the water in
wet gas sourced from Kela 2 field will
not enter the West-East Gas Pipeline,
as some will deposit in the 138-km
branch line from Kela 2 to Lunnan before it joins the other two gas sources.
The water content in the trunkline
therefore is the average of those of three
gas sources, with precipitation of Kela 2
wet gas in the branch line taken into account and decreasing the water content.
Controlling and adjusting the ratios
of gas from the three sources during
different months ensured secure operation (no hydrate formation) under
these conditions.
From June to August gas from Yaha
field measured 3.5 × 106 cu m/day, gas
from Sangji field 3 × 106 cu m/day, and
gas from Kela 2 field 4 × 106 cu m/
day. Small amounts of water precipitated with these ratios, but no hydrates
formed because the temperature of soil
was higher than the forming temperature. In September and October
volumes from Kela 2 field dropped to
3 × 106 cu m/day to lower the water
content, and remaining gas containing
more saturated water was forced to the
east section from the west section to

prevent water precipitation.
Wet gas supplies from Kela 2 stopped
in November, with the newly returned
dry gas gradually displacing the wet
gas from west to east, ensuring free
water did not precipitate and completing successful operation of the pipeline
through the accident period. ✦

New offshore drilling power module
Here’s the new QSK60 offshore drilling
power module.
It’s rated at 1,855 hp at 1,200 rpm with
a 10% overload capability and is integrated
with an AvK DSG99 alternator at 2,150 kVa
and 690 v. The maker says its unit is suited
for durability, reliability, and power density
requirements of high-hour and hard-duty
cycle applications such as drilling power
modules with no major midlife top-end
overhaul requirement.
The modular common rail (MCR) fuel
system enables full-authority electronic
control over fuel timing, quantity, pressure, and delivery rate shape. Precision
control over the number of injection
events enables optimum performance, fuel
economy, smooth power delivery, better
idle stability, and reduced engine noise,
as well as providing the capability for an
in-cylinder Tier 2 emissions solution, the
firm notes. The company points out that

The firm designed its product for the
lowest installation cost for repowers by
using customer interfaces similar to competitor packages for quick installation in
rigs that allow for the easiest accessibility.
The QSK60 is also designed with common mounting arrangements for drilling
applications.
The power module offers an electronic
information system with a C-Command

Oil sands attack
lifts doubt about
activists’ motives
A stepped-up attack on the Canadian oil
sands strengthens doubt about the motives of
environmental activists.
A declaration by the chief executives of 30
US and Canadian environmental organizations
calls, among other things, for a moratorium
on expansion of oil sands development.
It also seeks to “halt further approval of infrastructure that would lock us into using dirty

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

liquid fuels from sources such as tar sands, oil
shale, and liquid coal.”
This is the standard environmentalist remedy: stop commercial activity. It’s the political
equivalent of snake oil.
The environmental leaders would replace
oil sands development and petroleum consumption with the magic elixir of uneconomic
energy and forced conservation.
“Strengthen investments in renewable
energy and in energy efﬁciency and conservation through creating new, clean energy
jobs and increasing prosperity through new
technologies,” the declaration urges.
This is fantasy. “New technologies” can’t
increase prosperity when applied in service
to the displacement of activities that make
economic sense by alternatives that do not.
Furthermore, the declaration makes clear
that the environmental groups don’t want to
limit their obstructionism to oil sands.
“Energy security is best achieved through
investment in the cleanest available energy
and through ending our dependence on fossil
fuels,” it says.
Wrong again. Economies caught in moneylosing spirals, which wholesale energy subsidization inevitably becomes, can hope for little
security of any type.
In their demand for an economically untenable energy system, the environmental groups
show alarmingly little interest in practical
environmental progress.
To be sure, the oil sands of Alberta present
the full spectrum of environmental problems:
widespread surface disturbance, air and water
issues, and byproduct handling to name a few.
But oil sands operators have strong economic, political, and societal pressures to ﬁnd
solutions—stronger, perhaps, than do energy
operators anywhere.
Solutions developed to environmental
problems in Alberta will become methods applicable to fossil energy production, processing, and consumption everywhere. Many
already have emerged; many more lie ahead.
Because fossil energy won’t vanish from
the energy mix on command, this progress
is supremely important. To curtail it because
some groups favor stopping work over
solving problems would be environmentally
irresponsible.

‘Goldilocks range’ of prices
Top producers—especially key members of the Organization of Petroleum Countries—seek a “Goldilocks range” of crude prices, “neither too hot nor too cold for both
producers and consumers,” said Paul Horsnell, head of commodities research at Barclays Capital, London, in a recent report.
“It should be a range that maintains investment incentives and continuing macroeconomic equilibrium for producers, without creating too powerful a feedback effect
on consumer economies and without overly endangering oil’s share of the longer-term
energy mix,” Horsnell said. That’s likely to be $75-85/bbl, with $100/bbl apparently “fairly
close to the maximum level that could be accepted” before stimulating major resistance
from consumers, he said.
Prior to the May 28 OPEC meeting, Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Ali I. al-Naimi said the
world economy was showing enough signs of recovery to cope with $75-80/bbl oil.
In early June, analysts with the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised their 2009 crude
price forecast to $85/bbl from $65/bbl previously, with the possibility of approaching
$100/bbl by the end of 2010.
However, at KBC Market Services, a division of KBC Process Technology Ltd. in
Surrey, UK, analysts noted, “As recently as the end of April, Goldman forecast that
$45/bbl was in sight due to stubbornly high oil stocks and weak oil demand. Adding
more confusion to this about-turn is that in March Goldman forecast a ‘super-spike’
to $105/bbl, and, of course, who can forget last summer’s forecast of $200/bbl oil.
But are they right this time?”
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, “Overall
economic optimism is running rampant,” partly fueled by reports of a slowdown in job
losses and a drop in initial clams for unemployment beneﬁts.
A $70/bbl ceiling
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, said, “Bears have shown that they
have a weak hand, but Bulls will now have to show that they are strong enough to
go through the resistance of $70/bbl.”
On June 5, the front-month crude contract temporarily topped $70/bbl on the
New York Mercantile Exchange for the ﬁrst time in 7 months, climbing to $70.32/
bbl before closing at $68.44/bbl. The price rise was tempered by comments from the
International Energy Agency and others that the recent rally was not supported by
market fundamentals.
Meanwhile, the dollar strengthened as the US economy appeared to stabilize.
“Should dollar strength persist, it is possible the current rally in crude and commodities could pause,” said analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC, New Orleans.
They said, “If crude does not break $70[/bbl], the momentum players may lose
interest. However, strength in oil and most commodities will most likely be dictated
by the direction of the US dollar and US government bond yields.”
KBC analysts said, “One of the justiﬁcations for oil prices within spitting distance
of $70/bbl is that recovery is on the way and commodities investors are getting in
on the ground ﬂoor. But good economic news is pretty thin on the ground, and you
have to be an incurable optimist to believe that demand is going to recover any time
soon in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development economies.”
They cited “the sobering forecast” by the IEA that global electricity demand will
fall this year for the ﬁrst time since 1945, down 3.5%. “Even in past recessions electricity demand has never fallen,” they said.
KBC analysts earlier said, “For front-month prices to continue to rise, traders will
need to be prepared either to elevate the whole forward price curve, which would
seem to be premature given the extent of OPEC spare capacity, or to accept a further
ﬂattening of the forward curve, which would accelerate the movement ashore of
oil from ﬂoating storage. This in turn would show up in onland stocks and weaken
market sentiment.” They said, “This now seems to be unfolding in the market, with
$70/bbl possibly a short-term ceiling to oil prices until all oil in ﬂoating storage has
been brought ashore. Moreover, a downward correction cannot be ruled out especially
given the speculative length. However, crude may continue to trade higher with equities. All outcomes are possible in a market driven by others’ perceptions of the future.”
KBC analysts added, “It seems that OPEC cohesion is weakening with May output
rising to 28.2 million b/d and compliance with agreed cutbacks slipping to 75%. But
the surge in oil prices has spared OPEC the difﬁcult task of either seeking to boost
compliance or making a further cut that might have been met by some disbelief in
the oil market.”

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

REGISTER TODAY!

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.
Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil supply.
They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs during periods of lower oil prices, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling
air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions, mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to these challenges, the oil sands and heavy oil industry continues to develop unconventional
resources that are critical to meeting the world’s long-term needs for reliable hydrocarbon supplies.
Continued progress in oil sands and heavy oil producing technologies means progress in ensuring a dependable supply of
petroleum products at a time when traditional recovery methods are strained by additional demand from rapidly developing
industrial nations.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make this
innovation and progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience. Join the Oil & Gas
Journal and our conference attendees in Calgary this summer for the third annual Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies
Conference and Exhibition.

Advancing Reservoir Performance

We Take the Heat
Hughes Christensen Vanguard Bits
Geothermal drilling and other hot-hole applications subject drill bits to extremely high
temperatures and pressures. These harsh drilling environments have always had a punishing
impact on bit performance — until now. Finally, there’s a drill bit that’s engineered to withstand
the specific challenges of high-temperature drilling: The all-new Hughes Christensen Vanguard
series brings unique capabilities to these demanding applications — next-generation drilling
technology you won’t find anywhere else.
 High-temperature elastomer compounds provide reliable, continuous service at
temperatures in excess of 500° Fahrenheit.
 Metal-sealed bearings use a metal-to-metal sealing system that delivers superior
performance under the most strenuous conditions.
 Specially formulated bearing grease extends bearing life with its thermal stability and
high viscosity.
Vanguard premium Tricone drill bits are customized to meet the individual requirements
of each application, for performance that simply can’t be beat. Only from
Hughes Christensen.

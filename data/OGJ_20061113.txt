A Nigerian national security official further confirmed the attack, saying militants shut down the place but that they have not yet
issued any demands to be met.
A senior official from the state environment department, however, said the militants were demanding restitution for pollution
caused by the company’s operations in the area as well as jobs for
community members.
The attack follows a spate of recent actions against oil firms by
militants in the region.
On Nov. 3, the US government issued a warning of probable
militant attacks on oil facilities throughout the volatile Niger Delta
region (OGJ Online, Nov. 3, 2006). A day earlier armed gunmen

Purnomo said three options have been prepared for the Cabiback as a deduction from other state gas taxes.

South Korean Commerce, Industry, and Energy Minister Chung

California voters rejected a state ballot measure that would have
taxed state oil production at varying rates depending on the price
of crude, and tax revenues would have financed the development
of alternative energy (OGJ, Nov. 6, 2006, p. 76).
With 90% of the votes counted, returns indicated Proposition
87 was defeated 55% to 45%, officials said Nov. 7.
Oil companies, particularly Chevron Corp., opposed Proposition 87. If Proposition 87 had passed, the California government
would have collected an estimated $200-380 million/year in new
tax revenue, but opponents said it would have caused a reduction
in state oil production and a need for increased imports.

Sye-kyun and Nigerian Oil Minister Edmund Daukoru signed a
memorandum of understanding Nov. 6 that envisions upgrading
the African country’s rail system in exchange for oil interests.
South Korea will provide Nigeria with long-term, low-interest
commercial loans and have its companies take part in the second
phase of Nigeria’s railway modernization program. In exchange,
Nigeria will transfer shares in an operational oil field to South Korea.
POSCO Engineering & Construction Co. has already signed a
separate agreement with Nigeria’s Transportation Ministry to build
the railroad, while Korea National Oil Corp. will operate the oil
field. Officials said details about the size of the loan and oil field

linking oil capital Port Harcourt on the Gulf of Guinea to Maldugun in Nigeria’s northeastern region.
Nigeria made a similar deal with China in late October in an
$8.3 billion contract to construct a railway line from the nation’s
economic capital Lagos to Kano, the largest commercial city in the
north.
The Chinese, hoping to secure oil interests in Nigeria, recently
granted the African country a $2.5 billion loan facility, a substantial
amount of which would be used on the rail project. ✦

Development

Shell starts BC-10 development off Brazil

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

OML 52 and OML 85, respectively, off Nigeria.
Foster Wheeler Energy Ltd. and Foster Wheeler (Nigeria) Ltd.,
through a joint venture agreement with NETCO, will evaluate the
economics of the planned development and investigate possible
configurations for surface facilities.
These two separate work programs will be carried out under
an existing 3-year service contract between Foster Wheeler and
NETCO via CNL.
The values of the two awards, which were announced at yearend 2005, were not disclosed.
Foster Wheeler (Nigeria) Ltd. is already working on the frontend design for the nonassociated gas wellhead platforms and pipelines portion of CNL’s Olokola Gas Supply Project in Nigeria, said
Director Anita Omoile.

Shell Exploration & Production Co. and partners have let the first
contracts for development, involving subsea liquids-gas separation
and pumping, of three deepwater heavy-oil fields on Block BC-10
off Brazil.
One of the contracts is for leasing of a floating production,
storage, and offloading vessel with 100,000 b/d of oil processing
capacity from SBM Offshore NV. Another is for the drilling of 10
wells by the GlobalSantaFe Arctic 1 semisubmersible rig, now at
work in the Gulf of Mexico.
The first phase of Block BC-10 development will involve Ostra,
Abalone, and Argonauta fields. A fourth field, O-North near Argonauta, will be developed later. State-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA
(Petrobras), a partner, calls the area Parque das Conchas and estimates production will start in 2011.
Shell, the operator, will develop the fields with horizontal subsea wells and manifolds and tie each field back to the FPSO, which
will be moored in 1,780 m of water. The longest tie-back will be
15 km for Abalone field.
A Shell statement called the project “the first full-field development based on subsea oil and gas separation and subsea pumping.” Liquids will be separated from gas in large-diameter caissons.
Electric submersible pumps on the seafloor will pump the liquids
through steel lazy-wave risers to the FPSO, where oil and water will
be separated. Equipment on the FPSO will be able to inject 75,000
b/d of water in the fields.
Gas will move through a 40-km pipeline to Jubarte.
Shell declared Block BC-10 commercial at the end of last year
after drilling 15 exploratory wells and discovering reserves estimated at 400 million bbl of 16-24º gravity oil (OGJ, Oct. 2, 2006,
Newsletter). The block is 120 km southeast of Vitoria in Espirito
Santo state.
Interests are Shell 50%, Petrobras 35%, and Oil & Natural Gas
Corp. 15%.

Heritage Oil Corp., London, has completed two drill stem tests
of the upper zone of the Kingfisher-1 well on Block 3A in Uganda.
The first test did not flow hydrocarbons to surface. However,
the second tested two zones totaling 10 m over the interval from
1,783 m to 1,795 m, which flowed at a stabilized rate of 4,120
b/d of oil through a fixed 1-in. choke at a flowing wellhead pressure of 221 psi. The oil was light (30° gravity) and sweet with a
low gas-oil ratio and some associated wax.
The test flow data suggest that when equipped for production,
the well could flow at stable rates of about 5,600 b/d. It also indicated an extremely high permeability of more than 2,000 md.
The tests represented a secondary exploration objective for the
well, which will be sidetracked. Drilling will now continue to the
deeper primary objectives. It is expected to take a further 45-60
days to reach TD of 3,000-4,000 m. Test equipment will remain
on location to test the primary target (OGJ Online, Oct. 16, 2006,
Newsletter).

than 50 sq km, which has been high-graded as an immediate drilling target. It said seismic data from the first phase of exploration
have yielded a new understanding of the prospectivity of the Muglad basin’s Jonglei subbasin. The data show a sedimentary section as
thick as 7 km and rift structures suitable for forming hydrocarbon
traps, the company said.
White Nile said it will procure a drilling rig and plans to spud
the first exploration well in first-half 2007, when it also expects to
start a new 2D seismic survey in the Pibor Post basin.
The company’s Block Ba exploration and development program
includes three exploration wells in 2007 along with further 2D
seismic acquisition.

Drilling

Medco to develop Gulf of Mexico well
Medco Energi US LLC plans in early 2007 to install a braced
caisson or minimal structure on a well recently drilled on Mustang
Island Block 758 in the western Gulf of Mexico.
The No. 1 well, drilled in 156 ft of water 50 miles east of Corpus Christi, Tex., encountered gas pay totaling 47 ft total vertical
thickness in four horizons in the Miocene Marg A series between
8,200 ft and 8,900 ft. The well reached 9,200 ft TD.
The operator set 75⁄8-in. production casing at 9,155 ft and suspended the well at the mud line. ✦

Production

Chevron brings on more production off Angola
Chevron Corp. subsidiary Cabinda Gulf Oil Co. Ltd. has begun
oil production from the Landana North reservoir in the TombuaLandana development area, Chevron’s third operated deepwater
development off Angola.
The Landana North-1 well on deepwater Block 14 was the first
of 46 wells planned in the project. The well is tied back to the
Benguela Belize—Lobito Tomboco compliant piled tower, which
allows for early production as well as the gathering of important
reservoir information.
The project lies 50 miles offshore in more than 1,200 ft of
water and will employ a compliant piled tower with one subsea
center. The projected peak production from the completed development is about 100,000 b/d of oil by 2010.
Interests in the project are operator Cabinda Gulf 31%, Sonangol
Pesquisa e Producao SARL 20%, Eni Angola Exploration BV 20%,
Total E&P Angola 20%, and GALP-Exploracao e Producao 9%.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The lease will be produced using both steam-assisted gravity
drainage (SAGD) and oil sands surface mining technologies. The
Joslyn SAGD development will bring production to 10,000 b/d of
bitumen at plateau. After dilution, the bitumen will be shipped to
a terminal on the Athabasca Pipeline.
Mining developments are planned for the first part of the next
decade. An application for the first 100,000 b/d of bitumen via
surface mining was submitted to regulatory agencies in February
and currently is undergoing review.
Total also has a 50% working interest in the Surmont SAGD
project, which is expected to begin production from its first commercial phase in early 2007 and reach plateau production of
27,000 b/d. The potential production from Surmont is more than
200,000 b/d.
Total’s share of the aggregate production from Surmont and Joslyn should reach nearly 300,000 b/d in the next decade.

Total unit enters next phase at Joslyn project
Deer Creek Energy Ltd., a recent subsidiary of Total SA, has
started the commercial production phase of the Joslyn project in
the Athabasca region, 60 km northwest of Fort McMurray, Alta.
Deer Creek is an 84% interest owner and operator of the Joslyn
lease.
This will be the first commercial production from Joslyn, for
which cumulative production is estimated at around 2 billion bbl
of bitumen.

Processing
Marathon reports Garyville expansion details
Marathon Oil Corp. disclosed processing-unit capacities in a report that its board had approved expansion of its Garyville, La.,
refinery, which the company announced a year earlier.
Marathon will spend an estimated $3.2 billion to add 180,000
b/d of crude capacity to the 245,000 b/d refinery (OGJ, Nov. 7,
2005, Newsletter).
In addition to a new crude and vacuum distillation unit, the
project will add a 44,000-b/d delayed coker, a 70,000-b/d heavy
gas-oil hydrocracker, a 65,000-b/d reformer, and a 47,000-b/d
kerosine hydrotreater.

Dragon Oil PLC has signed a 2-year contract with Continental
Industrial Supply Ltd. for use of the CIS-1 platform-based drilling
rig.
Dragon said the rig will commence drilling a series of development wells in the Cheleken contract area off Turkmenistan in
first-half 2007.
Dragon said the contract will enable it to operate several drilling
rigs simultaneously in 2007. ✦

Compania Espanola de Petroleos SA (CEPSA) has let a lump-sum
contract for an undisclosed amount to Foster Wheeler Iberia SA for
front-end engineering design and early procurement services for
crude, vacuum, and gas concentration units at its 100,000 b/cd La
Rabida Refinery at Huelva, Spain.
The new units will be based on a basic design package by UOP,
a Honeywell company. The capacity for the crude distillation unit
will be 90,000 b/sd; for the vacuum distillation unit, 30,500 b/sd;
and the gas concentration unit, about 148 tons/hr.

OMV plans petrochemical expansion in Bavaria
OMV AG will boost petrochemicals capacity as part of a €1.1
billion investment program in Bavaria over the next 4 years.
It plans to expand ethylene capacity to 450,000 tonnes/year
from 340,000 tonnes/year and propylene capacity to 560,000

tonnes/year from 245,000 tonnes/year at its complex in
Burghausen.
The expansion projects will absorb €640 million of the overall
expansion budget while another €495 million will be committed
to OMV’s share of the Bayneroil joint-venture refinery network and
filling station business.
In the olefins expansion at Burghausen, OMV will build a metathesis plant, enlarge its ethylene plant, and construct a large
cracking furnace. It will become sole supplier of propylene to the
nearby plastics complex operated by its subsidiary Borealis. The
Borealis complex will be expanded with construction of a €200
million, 330,000-tonne/year polypropylene plant. Total polyolefin
capacity at the complex will rise to 740,000 tonnes/year. The new
plant will use OMV’s Borstar technology.
OMV also plans to invest €150 million to lay a 360-km products pipeline between Munchmunster and Ludwigshafen, giving it
access to the Western Europe ethylene network. The pipeline will
have an initial capacity of 200,000 tonnes/year, expandable to
400,000 tonnes/year.
Other spending planned by OMV in Germany includes €315
million for its share of investment in the upgrade and restructuring
of the Bayernoil joint-venture refinery network and €180 million
for retail network expansion. ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
KMEP again to expand products pipeline
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP plans to invest $388 million
to further expand the 550-mile CALNEV pipeline, which transports gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel from California to Nevada.
The proposed expansion, involving construction of a 16-in.
pipeline from Colton, Calif., to Las Vegas, Nev., will increase the
system’s capacity to 200,000 b/d. The company said a further capacity increase to more than 300,000 b/d is possible with the addition of pump stations.
The new pipeline will parallel existing utility corridors between
Colton and Las Vegas to minimize environmental impacts. It will
transport gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel for the military at Nellis Air
Force Base.
Subsequently, the existing 14-in. line will be dedicated to commercial jet fuel service for McCarran International Airport and any
future commercial airports planned in Las Vegas and the 8-in. pipeline that currently serves the airport would be purged and held for
future service.
Construction of the 16-in. line is expected to be completed in
9 months, following environmental permitting and right-of-way
acquisition, expected to take 24-30 months.
Pending Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approvals,
startup of the line is scheduled for late 2009 or early 2010.
This major expansion project is in addition to three capital upgrades on the CALNEV system, announced earlier this year. Two of
these projects, when completed, will increase the line’s capacity to
156,000 b/d. The third involves construction of additional tanks
that will increase gasoline and diesel storage at Las Vegas by 26%
and 20%, respectively. The expansion projects combined are valued
at $413 million.

After the US elections
Instead of talking and not acting on meaningful energy supply, Congress now will stop talking.
That’s the biggest change likely to come from

maybe Senate in the Nov. 7 congressional elections. The Democrats will talk about energy supply,
of course—just not meaningful supply. If they

thing meaningful about what they achieve will be

The priorities appear in a document entitled

The entire international Arctic region
contains “much less” potential petroleum resources, with a mix of more
natural gas, than previously estimated,
according to a joint study released Nov.

group of companies based in the Netherlands.

and lead author of the study. “These
findings are disappointing from a world
oil resource base perspective,” he said.
“The oil-gas mix is not ideal because
remote gas is often much harder to
transport to markets.”
Moreover, Latham said, “Export and
technology constraints are expected to
delay production of a large portion of
the commercial gas until 2050.” The
largest resource plays may not generate
the highest returns because they are gas
prone or cannot be readily monetized
due to constraints on available export
infrastructure, he said.
As a result, the study said the US
“must look elsewhere to meet rising
demand,” including member nations of

supply.”
This study is the first overall assessment
of the Arctic’s total oil and gas potential by
Wood Mackenzie or anyone else, Latham
said. “Nobody has done it all, not even
the US Geological Survey,” he said.
“While these results are disappointing to the US as a whole, the Arctic still
holds great potential for individual oil
and gas companies with the advanced
technology, money, and time to develop
the challenging resources and build the
infrastructure required to transport it,”

the Arctic. Three key factors drive high
full-cycle returns potential in individual
cases: a predominance of oil rather than
gas, short production lead times, and
proximity to export routes. (A more detailed look at these opportunities appears
in Exploration & Development, p. 31).
“The chance to lead in cutting-edge
technologies and to access world-class
volumes make many of the opportunities attractive for the largest companies.
For the intermediate and smaller-scale
players, there are niche opportunities in
plays for those willing to take a risk on
frontier exploration,” Latham said.

‘Yet-to-ﬁnd resources’
Many of the Arctic basins already
have world-class discovered resource
volumes totaling 233 billion boe. Beyond that, the Wood Mackenzie-Fugro
Robertson study assessed yet-to-find
resource potential of 166 billion boe.
The South Kara-Yamal basin and the
East Barents Sea in Russia, along with
Greenland’s Kronprins Christian basin,
have yet-to-find resources greater than
10 billion boe, the study reported.
“Only the South Kara-Yamal basin and

the East Barents Sea offer the majority
of yet-to-find potential in pool sizes of
over 1 billion boe,” the report said.
Most of those yet-to-find resources
are in either ice-free or seasonal ice
areas offshore or in the onshore areas of
the basins, according to the study. “The
engineering challenges away from the
permanent ice zone are less daunting,
with emphasis on cost and efficiency
improvement of existing technologies rather than radical new solutions.
Subsea technologies will unlock the
greatest share of resources,” it said.
The cost of Arctic operations is high,
driven by extreme transportation costs,
with wide variation between basins.
“Average field development costs of
around $6/boe are comparable with
many other parts of the world. High
costs elevate average development
breakeven prices across the Arctic to
above $30/boe,” said the report.
It said there are attractive niche opportunities in many basins where the
breakeven price of the largest fields are
much less than average, below $20/bbl
in some cases. Two basins—the North
Slope in Alaska and Russia’s Pechora

Sea—achieve exploration full-cycle returns greater than 20%. “These are both
oil-prone basins with good access to
markets via pipelines and ice-free seas,”
Latham said.
All five host governments with oil
and gas holdings in the Arctic—the
US, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and
Russia—favor exploration by foreign
and domestic companies. Competition
in that region “is lower than in other
resource plays of comparable scale,” and
no preeminent “pan-Arctic champion”
has yet emerged, said Latham. “Infrastructure will be key to success in many
parts of the Arctic, and local infrastructure owners already hold strong advantages in the more-developed basins.”
Future license rounds will indicate the industry’s appetite for Arctic
exploration, along with application of
technology and development of export
infrastructure, he said.
Nearly three quarters of the yet-tofind liquids resources and half of the
yet-to-find gas resources are potentially
commercial under the base-case price
scenario, with Arctic adaptation of
proven technology, Latham said. ✦

Hurricanes spotlight jack up design, placements
Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
The storm magnitudes of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita exceeded the
design criteria of most of the jack up
rigs caught in their paths through the
central Gulf of Mexico, said industry
experts at a recent Houston workshop
sponsored by the International Association of Drilling Contractors.
Some 12% of the gulf jack up rig
fleet was lost or moved off locations
as those two hurricanes cut through
the central gulf within 24 days of each
other in August-September 2005. The
primary causes of those rig movements
and losses were wind and currents,
wave inundation, and foundation or
soil movement, officials said. The best

news, industry sources agreed, is that
there was no loss of life, no threat to
safety, and only minimal environmental
impact. That validates the “shut in and
evacuate” response to hurricanes, said
offshore veterans.
Assessments of the three worst hurricanes to hit the oil and gas areas of
the Gulf of Mexico in recent years—Katrina and Rita in 2005 and Ivan in
2004—confirm that the magnitude
of those storms exceeded the criteria
of all jack ups that were destroyed or
floated ashore, said Alberto Morandi,
executive vice-president of American
Global Maritime Inc., Houston. Storm
magnitudes also exceeded all of the rigs
that survived “in every case but one,”
he said.
The lone exception was Rowan Cos.

Inc.’s Class 224C cantilevered Super
Gorilla jack up “Bob Palmer,” named for
Rowan’s Chairman Emeritus C.R. “Bob”
Palmer. Outfitted with 713 ft legs, 139
ft more than the company’s late-model
Gorilla rigs, and with 30% larger spud
cans, the Super Gorilla can work in 550
ft of water in the Gulf of Mexico.
Otherwise, Morandi said, “no one
parameter” determined which rigs
failed and which survived the three
worse hurricanes. “There were rigs
in shallow water that failed, rigs in
deeper water that survived and rigs that
exceeded their vertical reaction and survived,” he said. Among both survivors
and wrecked units, there was “a combination of different factors,” he said.
“One MTL 166C rig was subjected to
hurricane loading that was 80% over its

design load. The combination of large
(96 ft) penetration (high fixity) and
high soil reserve strength contributed
to the rig’s survival without damage,”
Morandi reported. On another jack up
that was lost, there was “clear evidence”
on the sea floor that the spud can had
dragged out of the can hole, creating
stress that caused the rig to overturn,
he said.
Both rig survivals and losses “can be
largely explained in terms of a combination of higher or lower reserve
strength, favorable or unfavorable soil
conditions, and favorable or unfavorable
storm headings,” Morandi said. “Leg
settlement may have contributed to
wave impingement on the deck, further
increasing the total load.”
He said, “An air gap of 60-62 ft
would have been sufficient to clear the
hurricane crests, with some allowance
for leg settlement (water depth over
80 ft). This would also be in agreement
with an additional number of locations
investigated by the LeTourneau Inc.
Marine Group. [It is] also in agreement
with fixed platform observations.”
Historically, design limits for elevated
jack ups are determined via class-approved benchmark storms. The American Bureau of Shipping’s code requires
mobile offshore drilling units to be
designed to withstand a storm wind velocity of 100 knots for unrestricted offshore service. Other parameters include
water depth, wave height and period,
air gap, spud can penetration, and current velocity. “The combination of such
parameters has to be such that adequate
safety factors are met for relevant failure
modes,” said Morandi.
In practice, however, the benchmark storm parameters do not reflect
site-specific soil conditions or air gap
requirements and are not directly
related to a return period storm load
or a Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.
Therefore, Morandi said, “A site-specific
assessment is needed, which can be
performed at different levels of detail.”
Designing jack ups is “a very
complex task with a lot of trade-offs,”
Morandi noted. The complexity of
22

industry and regulatory standards is an
important factor, especially in today’s
“very tight” market for experienced
engineers. Such specialized knowledge
is more important as standards become
more and more complex, he said.
Regulators and drilling contractors
are looking harder at installation issues
as well. “Jack ups are tremendously
affected by soil conditions, which can
lead to shallow penetrations and other
problems,” Morandi said.
With strong soil structure, a jack up
rig can take more of a storm load than
it was designed for, he said. However,
he said, “Once one leg fails, the other
two will go.”

ABS guidelines
The American Bureau of Shipping plans to publish by yearend new
guidelines for the inspection of mobile
offshore rigs more than 20 years old,
said Chris Serratella, ABS director of
operational safety and evaluation, at the
Oct. 19 workshop.
Current recommendations for new
guidelines include more-detailed,
close-up survey, nondestructive testing,
and thickness gauging of major joints
and fatigue-sensitive areas under survey
plans that rig owners would create
and submit to ABS prior to inspection.
These will “ensure that critical areas are
surveyed in proper sequence using appropriate techniques,” Serratella said.
More emphasis should be placed on
corrosion and coatings maintenance,
“especially of internal surfaces.” Critical
inspection areas on jack ups include
legs, leg well areas, spud cans, cantilever push-up and hold-down structures,
crane pedestal connections, mud pits
and preload tanks for corrosion.
Moreover, ABS is compiling inspection and wear data on “any rig or rig
design where we have enough history
that we can go back and pinpoint the
critical areas that we need to look at,”
Serratella said. “Rather than just look
at specific rigs, we would look at the
rig design and all the information that
ABS gathers on those rigs, then turn

around and give that as guidance to the
surveyors.”
Conversely, he said, ABS wants to
help inspectors “stop wasting time” on
close inspection and analysis of areas
that “never show any problems” despite
frequent inspections and instead focus
on those areas with an evident history
of problems. ✦

Gas Summit analyzes
European Union gas
supply-demand issues
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
Two new features this year marked
the 11th Gas Summit held Oct. 26-27
in Paris and organized by Pétrostrategies
consultant and publisher, Institut Français du Pétrole, oil and gas consultants
SPTEC, and Poten & Partners Inc.
For the first time, no ministers or
officials attended, and discussions took
place among industry leaders alone
with few political overtones. New entrants to a liberalized gas and electricity
market were invited to explain difficulties encountered accessing that market,
which is still dominated by incumbents.
Even giant electricity provider Electricite de France (EdF) seemed hindered
in its attempts to enter the chain from
upstream development to downstream
distribution. Dominique Venet, EdF executive vice-president, gas, complained
that the incumbents hold existing
import and transportation capacities,
and new players “have to find their
way through the transit jungle.” At the
other end of the scale, Claude Gianotti,
director of the small Swiss-based trader
WorldEnergy SA, described the “hard
life of new entrants” competing for
both supply and consumption and seeking a fairly regulated EU market.

Demand to drop

whether soaring prices would slow
expected gas growth, industry leaders attending this summit noted there were indeed signs of demand destruction, at least
in Europe. By 2030, gas supply might
well be reduced by 50 billion cu m from
established forecasts, ventured Patrick
Walliez, gas advisor to the CEO of Suez.
Energy savings of 20% required by
the EU Commission before 2020 and
rising greenhouse gas emission concerns should also take their toll on gas
growth rates, pointed out Gaz de France
Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marie
Dauger. It was generally expected that
gas would continue to play a major role
in the energy mix but would face growing competition from nuclear power
and coal for the expanding electricity
sector, as all sources will be required to
meet demand.

Supply concerns
On the supply side, companies were
surprisingly less worried than politicians about the short and medium term
but were more interested in solving the
technical hurdles to uninterrupted supply. They were concerned about the political turn the market has been taking
and its impact on the implementation
of the huge investments that will be
needed to sustain and develop production and transport infrastructure. They
also were in favor of stronger partnerships, dialogue, and even interdependence with gas-producing countries.
Italy was one of the counties hardest
hit by Russia’s interruption of supplies
during the Ukraine crisis last January. ENI Gas & Power Division’s Chief

Operating Officer Domenico Dispenza
aptly summed up the situation when
he said: “Security of supply is caught
in the middle of the various forces that
are currently reshaping the market.
These various forces consist of supply
challenges, the need for a panEuropean
infrastructure, gas and power convergence, mergers and acquisitions, and
regulatory harmonization.”
He was echoed by Iberdrola’s gas
unit director Conrado Navarro, who
specified the need for investments in
cross-border capacities, cooperation
between transmission system operators
of neighboring member states, supply
diversification, interconnections, development of interruptible demand, and
storage capacity.
Officials of most companies, such as
Edison SPA’s hydrocarbon group Senior
Adviser Luciano Sgubini, called for a
“stable and regulatory framework” as
well as strong incentive policies for
investing in new pipeline and regasification plants as well as increased European-wide storage capacity. The current
lack of storage and easy access to it by
all EU members was seen as preventing
the introduction of strategic gas stocks
in the European Union to deal with
potential supply disruptions.
Supply security, all summit participants agreed, also required diversification of sources achieved through
increased recourse to LNG trade, which
is becoming increasingly globalized but
as yet not “commoditized.” Shell’s David Wells, vice-president, global energy
supply, described it as “the lubrication
in the global gas industry.”

Speakers—Rune Bjornson of Statoil
ASA, Hydro Oil & Energy’s Vice-Pres.
Torstein Indrebo, and Sonatrach’s
Marketing Vice-Pres. Chauwki Mohammed Rahal—sought to dissipate supply
security fears by demonstrating that the
range of their new projects kept them
in the “reliable long-term suppliers”
category.
Rahal was particularly anxious to dispel fears raised by Sonatrach’s partnership agreement with Gazprom that was
signed at a crucial period of the EU’s
energy security worries. He insisted it
was “a normal agreement such as was
already signed with many other international companies,” and was intended
for the development of joint projects in
Russia.
He listed Sonatrach’s “contribution
to security of supply for Europe” and
indicated that, besides its existing six
LNG carriers, Sonatrach would have two
additional Medimax carriers in operation between 2007 and 2008 and two
Atlantic Max vessels on stream in 200810. A planned 8 billion cu m/year gas

However he said that Sonatrach, like
Gazprom, did not want to remain a

UKOOA urges tax change to boost UKCS production
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
The UK government must change
the fiscal regime to ensure production of the 27 billion bbl of oil and gas
equivalent that might be recoverable
from the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS),

Malcolm Webb, chief executive of the
UK Offshore Operators’ Association
(UKOOA), said Nov. 7.
Webb warned at UKOOA’s annual
conference in Aberdeen that the UK
needs a “radical review” of the extraction of oil and gas if it is to remain
competitive in attracting investment.

Increasing UK production—which
will require investment of £300 billion ($568.9 billion)—must become
a priority, he said, or the UK would
spend billions importing oil and gas.
He stressed that it is “no given” that
this investment will be made unless
the regulatory and tax regime accom-

UKOOA: Skills shortage worries UK oil industry
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
An acute lack of skilled engineers
and technologists is threatening the
development of the UK Continental
Shelf (UKCS), speakers warned Nov. 7
at the UK Offshore Operators’ Association (UKOOA) industry conference in
Aberdeen.
The estimated 27 billion bbl of
oil and gas remaining in the mature
province will require £300 billion to
produce, and engineers will be needed
to develop innovative solutions to
extract the oil and gas in difﬁcult areas,
UKOOA Chief Executive Malcolm Webb
said. As one solution, Webb urged
participants to recruit more women
into the industry to help ease the skills
shortage. Women currently comprise
about 5% of the offshore workforce.
Oil and gas industry skills body,
OPITO, will work closely with the UK
petroleum industry to create a fasttrack skills program and develop a
sustainable workforce. It will focus
on creating upskill programs for new
entrants and existing workers, drawing up labor development frameworks

modates resource maturation and high
production costs of the UKCS.
In December 2005, Gordon Brown,
chancellor of the exchequer, shocked
the UK oil industry by doubling the
supplementary corporation tax rate
on oil and gas production to 20% in a
move that pushed the total corporate
tax on production begun after 1993 to
50% and on older production to 75%.
UKOOA said the change has reduced
the value of new investment in the UK
by around 16%. Webb criticized the
Treasury’s reluctance “to engage in any
commitment beyond the existing Parliament.”
Over the 40 years that the UKCS
has produced hydrocarbons, energy
companies have invested £350 billion
24

for speciﬁc sectors, and launching a
communications program to inform
potential recruits that the petroleum
industry offers exciting and stimulating
career paths.
Ian Dundas, head of the Industry
Leadership Team’s Workforce Capacity
and Capability Workgroup, said: “While
we are conﬁdent that the supply chain
is using everything at its disposal to
meet the demand for plant and equipment we are not seeing the same use
of industry-developed solutions to
alleviate the skills issues. If we are to
develop the tools, we must be certain
that they are appropriate and relevant
and that the industry will use them to
deliver results.”
Over the last 12 months, OPITO and
its industry partners have invested
more than £2 million in developing new pan-industry skills solutions
through the accelerated projects.
According to Ian McCafferty, chief
economic advisor at the trade body
Confederation of Business Industry, the
UK is seriously struggling to develop a
skilled workforce compared with other

to recover 35 billion bbl of oil and gas
equivalent.
“It is a foolish deception not to recognize that the UK is and will remain a
petroleum economy for the foreseeable
future and that to the extent we do not
produce our oil and gas we will have to
import it,” Webb warned.
Oil and gas will remain central to UK
energy policy, currently supplying 75%
of the nation’s energy demand. This is
expected to rise to 80% by 2020, and
gas will provide over half of the UK’s
electricity needs by 2020. Webb said,
“We could still be producing 60% of
the nation’s needs for oil and 25% of its
needs for gas in 2020 and continue to
produce both in significant volumes for

nations in Europe, and in China and
India. Although the UKCS has been at
the forefront in developing innovative
technology to produce oil and gas, it
cannot be complacent, said Tom Botts,
Shell’s executive vice-president for
Europe.
“Ten years ago the depth of wells
was limited because they were drilled
like telescopes—inserting pipes of decreasing diameter within each other as
the well deepened. Today we’ve found
solutions using expanding tubulars
that expand the pipe in the ground,
allowing for deeper and productive
wells,” he added.
Over the past 10 years, fewer young
people have opted for sciences at Alevel, the exams that students take to
enter UK universities, and they have
shunned the subject at degree level.
Since the oil price crash in the late
80’s, the general public has viewed the
industry as one in decline, and this
perception has been difﬁcult to dispel
despite recent record energy prices.
Energy companies in Aberdeen
have begun visiting schools to share
information with students and teachers about career progression and their
operations to persuade young people
to study the sciences.

decades thereafter.”
Other challenges facing North Sea
oil and gas production are rising costs,
resource constraints, and an aging
workforce (see related story, this page).
Webb called for an integrated approach
by the government to energy.
“Might not a rationalization of the
various energy groups currently spread
all across the government into one energy department result in a better focus
and a more efficient use of resource?”
he asked. He urged the government to
simplify decommissioning of obsolete
offshore equipment. And he said the
government’s ready acceptance of some
European energy and environmental
rules has damaged the UK petroleum
industry. ✦

Foreign oil ﬁrms agree
to Bolivia’s contract terms

future.
My colleagues are viewed
as thought leaders.

My company is SAIC.

Peter Howard Wertheim
OGJ Correspondent
Bolivian President Evo Morales claimed a victory
Oct. 29 when key foreign energy companies agreed
to remain in Bolivia, operate under state control, and
cede larger shares of profits to the government.
The deals strengthen Morales’s bid to give Bolivia a
larger role in its own economy: It has the continent’s
second-largest natural gas reserves after Venezuela yet
remains South America’s poorest country.
With these new contracts, Juan Carlos Ortiz, president of Bolivia state-owned Yacimientos Petrolíferos
Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), estimated that the state
will receive an additional $1.3 billion/year in revenues. Morales said these revenues could be increased
to as much as $4 billion within 4 years, when Bolivia
begins exporting 30 million cu m/day of gas to
Argentina.
According to Ortiz, the contracts also guarantee
that the country will receive investments of as much
as $2 billion. They came 10 days after Morales and
Argentine President Nestor Kirchner signed a $17 billion deal significantly expanding Bolivia’s gas exports
to Argentina over the next 20 years.
Ortez said the former contracts, which granted
ownership of hydrocarbon production and commercialization for the investor companies, violated the
Bolivian Constitution but now can be approved by
the Legislative. Now YPFB takes on a more preponderant role in the commercialization of hydrocarbons
produced (OGJ Online, Nov. 1, 2006).
Henceforth, YPFB will supervise operations of
foreign oil companies more closely and will participate in the administration of the fields, accompany
the accounts through quarterly reports, participate in
profits, supervise tender bids for goods and services,
grant approval for the value of operating costs and
capital expenditures, becoming “more like a partnership,” said Brazilian governmental authorities.
Ortiz added that the megafields will yield government take above 80%, although there will be variations, while smaller fields will yield less than 80% but
more than 50%, defined on a case-by-case basis, according to production capacity and other conditions.
The contract period for fields with lower production
also varies, from 22-31 years.

Company reactions
While Petrobras is the largest gas
producer in Bolivia, Repsol YPF SA and
its subsidiary Andina control the largest
share of Bolivia’s known 55 tcf of gas
reserves, with 35%. Petrobras controls
16% and Total SA, 14%.
The new contract will allow Petrobras an average earning capacity of
15% over E&P activities, “way above
our capital costs,” said Petrobras Pres.
José Sergio Gabrielli. Petrobras maintained its rights to explore on the Rio
Hondo, Ingre, and Irenda blocks but did
not change its contracts related to the
exportation of 26 million cu m/day of
gas from Bolivia to Brazil. Negotiations

over the gas price are set to resume next
month in Rio de Janeiro.
The two countries also have not yet
agreed on the price for indemnity due
to nationalization of two Petrobras-operated refineries that process a total of
60,000 b/d of oil: Gualberto Villarroel
(Cochabamba) and Guillermo Elder
Bell (Santa Cruz de La Sierra). Petrobras
bought the plants 7 years ago for some
$100 million.
The Spanish press quoted Repsol
YPF Chairman Antoni Brufau as saying
its agreement clarifies past uncertainty
“and allows us to invest with the necessary legal safeguards, validating the

interests we already have.” Repsol YPF
and Bolivian subsidiary Andina have
invested $1.17 billion in the country.
BG Group PLC, which has invested
£100 million in Bolivia and produces
60 MMcfd of gas, said the new contract
assures a return on current investments,
but “new investments will be analyzed
on a case-by-case basis.”
Morales said on Oct. 28 that Total
also would remain and spend about $2
billion exploring for and producing gas
from three large fields.
The contracts signed with 10 foreign
oil companies will now be submitted
to the Bolivian Congress for ratification. ✦

information, which Halliburton said it
is furnishing, about current and former
agents used in connection with several
Nigerian and global projects during the
last 20 years.
SEC also asked Halliburton in September to enter into a tolling agreement that would delay the time the
legal clock started running, or tolling,
on the case under the statute of limitations, generally 5 years for such cases. It
expects to do so, Halliburton said in its
10-Q report to the SEC of its financial
and operating results for the 3 months
ended Sept. 30.
The company said investigations
center around the use of agents or
subcontractors at the Bonny Island
natural gas liquefaction complex in
Nigeria by TSKJ, a joint venture of
affiliates of Technip SA of France,
Saipem SPA of Italy, Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root, and
JCG Corp. of Japan. Each partner holds
about 25% interest.
The investigations center on possible
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Halliburton said. “In addition
to performing our own investigation,
we have been cooperating with the SEC
and DOJ investigations and with other
investigations into the Bonny Island
project in France, Nigeria, and Switzerland,” it added.
Halliburton also said its corporate
board has appointed a committee of
independent directors to oversee and
direct the FCPA investigations.

Extended period
It said the DOJ and SEC investigations cover an extended period, in some
cases significantly before Halliburton’s
1998 acquisition of Dresser Industries

Inc. The merger brought M.W. Kellogg
Co. into Halliburton, which it combined with its own engineering and
construction division, Brown & Root.
Halliburton supplied DOJ and SEC
with documents from the files “of
numerous offices of Halliburton and
KBR, including current and former
executives of Halliburton and KBR, and
we are making our employees available
to the DOJ and SEC for interviews,” the
company said.
The SEC has subpoenaed former
KBR Chairman and consultant A. Jack
Stanley and other current and former
KBR executives and employees and at
least one KBR subcontractor, Halliburton said.
“We further understand that the DOJ
has invoked its authority under a sitting grand jury to issue subpoenas for
the purpose of obtaining information
abroad, and...that other partners of TSKJ
have provided information to the DOJ
and the SEC with respect to the investigations, either voluntarily or under
subpoenas,” the company said.
Halliburton said the two investigations include an examination of whether TSKJ’s use of Tri-Star Investments as
an agent, beginning in 1995, and an
unnamed Japanese trading company
as a subcontractor, beginning in 1996,
led to bribes of Nigerian government
officials.
Halliburton said a French magistrate
placed Tri-Star principal Jeffrey Tesler
under investigation for corruption of
a foreign public official. It said investigations of TSKJ’s activities also are
under way by a legislative committee

of Nigeria’s national assembly, by the
African nation’s Economic and Financial
Crimes Commission, and by the UK’s
Serious Frauds office.
“We notified the other owners of
TSKJ of information provided by the
investigations and asked them each to
conduct their own investigation,” Halliburton said.
TSKJ has suspended payments to and
services from Tri-Star and the Japanese
trading company and is considering
legal action to terminate all agency
agreements with Tri-Star and recovery
payments under those agreements, said
Halliburton.
TSKJ also notified Nigeria’s attorney
general in February 2005 that it would
not oppose his efforts to have Swiss
bank account money from the agreements transferred to Nigeria, Halliburton added.
Halliburton said it terminated all
relationships with Stanley and another former M.W. Kellogg employee
and consultant in June 2004 because
the company found the pair violated
Halliburton’s business conduct code
by allegedly receiving personal benefits from Tesler in connection with
TSKJ’s construction of the Bonny Island
project.
Halliburton said that in 2006 it
suspended the services of another agent
who had worked for KBR outside of
Nigeria on several current projects and
older projects going back to the 1980s.
It said it also is investigating whether
another agent involved in still another
current Nigerian project has violated
any laws and the company’s business
conduct code in response to bribery
allegations by one of the other TSKJ
partners. ✦

Blanco reacts
Blanco called the agreement “an
historic victory for Louisiana and for all
states whose voices deserve to be heard
in matters of their own destiny.”
She said, “This fight is not with the
oil and gas industry; it is with the federal government.”
A Nov. 13 trial was scheduled in
New Orleans, but the MMS said the
state of Louisiana plans to dismiss the
lawsuit upon court approval of the
settlement.
The US Geological Survey reported

ordered attorneys for MMS and Blanco
to enter into negotiations.
Blanco has pushed for what she calls
“Louisiana’s fair share of revenues from
offshore oil and gas drilling.”
She wants to secure a share of federal
offshore oil revenues to mitigate the
state’s loss of coastline (OGJ, Apr. 17,
2006, p. 26). Blanco said that restoring Louisiana’s coastline is essential for
hunting, fishing, and protecting oil and
gas infrastructure.

Offshore revenues
Meanwhile, the Louisiana congressional delegation is working for a
compromise energy bill that allocates
a portion of royalties from offshore
drilling to the state’s Coastal Protection
Fund.
The US House and Senate have
conflicting revenue-sharing bills. Blanco
called for Congress to reconcile the two.
“It’s time for Congress to pass a
revenue-sharing bill that will allow us
to get on with the business of restoring
our coast and protecting the communities that support this country’s offshore

In the first 9 months, API said, an

gas wells were drilled in the US.
The move by some producers to
oil from gas did not surprise industry observers. “It was driven by more
favorable oil prices, which provided
some extra money when they reached
$77/bbl in mid-July. Natural gas prices
were coming down after peaking a year
ago,” said Rayola S. Dougher, manager
for energy market issues at API.

ident of economics and international
affairs at the Independent Petroleum
Association of America.
Meanwhile, natural gas prices fell to
$4/MMBtu on the New York Mercantile
Exchange strip but have recently improved, he told OGJ. “Natural gas still is
strong, however, and this year, the [US
Energy Information Administration] estimates that 19,690 development wells
were drilled in the first 8 months, compared to 12,836 in the first 8 months 2
years ago,” Lawrence said.
While EIA estimated in September that an average 264 rigs drilled
for oil in the US during 2006’s first 8
months—66% more than the average
of 159 in the same 2004 period—US
oil production fell more than 7% to an
average 5.098 million b/d from 5.5
million b/d, he said.

“Although the well completion totals
are very impressive, production isn’t
keeping up. Producers need access to
more supplies and have to pay increasing costs for equipment and personnel.
The cost per well is increasing, which
diminishes some of the value of the
increased commodity prices,” Lawrence
said.
Dougher said, “Many of our fields
are being depleted. It takes ever-increasing amounts of money and technology
to get oil and gas out. The best sites
have been developed already. But there
are new frontiers, such as Chevron and
Devon’s Jack 2 well in the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico.”
Meanwhile, gas production is growing in the Rocky Mountains, according
to Jon Bargas, communications manager
with the Independent Petroleum As-

sociation of Mountain States in Denver.
“EIA estimates that we’ll pass the Gulf
of Mexico this year as the largest source
of this country’s natural gas. As long
as the American people demand it as
a clean-burning energy, the West will
remain a heavy focus,” he said.
Most of the activity is on public
lands, which requires cooperation with
governments and communities, Bargas
continued. “Oil and gas development
involves less than 1% of the West’s federal lands, so the environmental impact
is not that great, despite what some
groups are saying,” he said.
API also reported that total estimated
footage drilled in 2006’s first 9 months
and third quarter reached 212,523 ft
and 73,107 ft, respectively. The last time
estimated total footage drilled reached
this level was in 1985, it said. ✦

NPRA’s Slaughter: ‘Biofuels are not the answer’
Biofuels are not the answer to US
energy supply problems, said the
president of the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association at a management forum in Houston.
Ethanol produced from corn is
neither an economic nor energy-efficient alternative to gasoline, said
Bob Slaughter, NPRA president. “If
we were to seek to replace 10% of US
gasoline needs with ethanol in 2020,
we would have to plant all of Ohio,
Illinois, and Indiana, using one sixth
of the total land we currently use for
crops just to grow corn for ethanol,”
he said.
NPRA, which represents virtually all US refiners and petrochemical manufacturers, is not opposed to
the use of ethanol as an oxygenate
additive to gasoline or to the 85:15
ethanol-gasoline “E85” blend, or
to biodiesel and other alternative
fuels, if competitively priced without
government subsidies. “We believe
that alternative fuels will be a growing component of the nation’s future
energy supplies as their economic

viability improves. Policymakers,
however, have a responsibility to get
all the facts before mandating new
fuels,” Slaughter said.
He said, “The US oil and gas industry faces an unprecedented challenge
in satisfying the projected growth in
energy demand worldwide by 2030.
To meet the challenge, the nation’s
energy policy must be grounded in
reality, keep a long-term focus, and
continue to search for solutions based
upon sound science and careful analysis of economic and environmental
factors.”
US refiners have produced record
volumes of petroleum products in
recent years to help meet increased
demand, while investing some $50
billion over the last 2 decades to make
sweeping environmental improvements in their products and facilities.
“US refiners have announced plans to
add 1.4 million b/d of new refining
capacity to existing US refineries, an
8% increase,” Slaughter said.
For the next several decades, the US
and the rest of the world will require

more oil and gas to meet energy
needs and support economic growth.
And this has geopolitical and national
political implications, said Slaughter.
“With the lack of an explicit, supply-based energy policy to address the
US energy supply-demand imbalance,
we are increasingly in the hands of
international and global politics,” he
said. “In many ways, America’s energy
policy is still living in the past when
oil and gas were cheap and readily
available to meet constantly increasing
global energy demand. Policymakers
must accept the reality of the situation
rather than take expensive and ill-considered steps in an attempt to avoid it.”
Slaughter said, “America can take
steps to increase its domestic production of energy, affecting both producers and refiners. Paying appropriate
attention to the increasing need for
energy will be key to obtaining policies that actually increase domestic
production and refining. No nation—not even the US—can insulate
itself from the global energy challenges.” ✦

to be overlooked by some oil and gas
analysts. But there can be no doubt
that the Twin Towers of Petroliam
Nasional Bhd. (Petronas) in Kuala
Lumpur are trilling with stepped up
activity.
After all, Petronas not only markets and exports crude oil, petroleum
products, natural gas liquids, and
sulfur, it also ships crude oil and LNG
around the world and participates in
joint ventures and other affiliates at
home and abroad to refine crude oil
and market products.
One sign of that came last week
as a consortium consisting of the
UK’s Petrofac (30%), Petronas (30%),
Kufpec (25%), and the PetroVietnam Investment & Development Co.

EPA proposes further
gasoline vapor controls
The US Environmental Protection
Agency wants to expand, to nationwide
locations, its air toxic standards designed to
prevent gasoline spills and evaporation at
urban distribution facilities.
The rule, which already covers urban
facilities that store gasoline and load it
onto trucks for delivery to stations, would
be added to 3,000-5,000 more locations,
EPA said on Nov. 2. It also could begin to
cover the loading of gasoline into retailers’
storage tanks in highly populated areas, the
federal regulatory agency said.
EPA said that two alternatives are being
considered in the expansion. The first
would focus on pipelines, terminals, and
bulk plants. The second would also add
controls at urban retailers. EPA is seeking public comments on the proposals
through Dec. 31.
The standards, which EPA proposed
on Oct. 31, would reduce 45,000-46,000
tons/year of volatile organic compounds
in gasoline vapors, including 3,3003,400 tons of hazardous air pollutants,
mostly at large bulk facilities. The program
would cost about $60-65 million.
“There would be an annual benefit
of about $6 million from either of the
proposed alternatives. The value of the
recovered gasoline and gasoline not
allowed to evaporate will more than pay
for the annual cost of the expenditures
and the operation and maintenance of
the equipment,” EPA said in a fact sheet
accompanying the proposals.
Most US pipelines, bulk plants and
terminals already comply with standards
in the proposed regulations, it added.
The first alternative would require all
bulk distribution sites to have best seals
on terminal and pipeline storage tanks,
use submerged fill pipes when loading
bulk plants’ storage tanks, install vapor
processors to control tank truck loadings
at bulk terminals, use submerged fill pipes
to control tank truck loading emissions at
bulk plants, and periodically test all tank
trucks and rail cars for leaks. ✦

P L O R A T I O N

The Arctic is often considered as a
single frontier for the oil and gas industry with a unique set of challenges that
require unique exploration and development solutions. However, during the
course of completing a recent study
“Future of the Arctic—A New Dawn
for Exploration,” it became clear to UK
consultants Wood Mackenzie that the
Arctic is far from being homogenous
and there exists a range of distinct
opportunities that fit very different
strategic aims.

Arctic basins
A number of the Arctic basins, notably the North Slope of Alaska, the South
Kara/Yamal subbasin to the north of
Western Siberia, and the West Barents
and East Barents basins in Norway and
Russia, respectively, have large discovered resources that are at different
stages of development (Fig. 1).
Both the North Slope and the southern part of South Kara/Yamal are well
established as oil and gas provinces and
have pipelines that link them to global
markets.
At the other end of the spectrum a
number of sedimentary basins in the
Arctic, such as the North Greenland basin, the East Siberian Sea, and the North
Chukchi Sea, are virtually
untouched by the oil and
gas industry. In these basins
there is extremely limited
data on the subsurface, and
none of the infrastructure
associated with the industry.
The degree of development in each basin reflects
the relative severity of the
challenges faced in different
parts of the Arctic.
Remoteness is perhaps
the greatest challenge for
the oil and gas industry in
the Arctic. The great distance
from the Arctic to population centers is
a challenge in terms of shipping hydrocarbons to markets, either by pipeline
or sea transport. This remoteness is also
a challenge when it comes to mobilizing the people and equipment needed

to explore for oil and gas. Mobilizing
the necessary items to the Arctic in order to collect seismic data or drill wells
can take a long time and cost a great
deal of money.

Ice challenges
The challenges presented by ice vary
greatly across the Arctic.
North Greenland ice is permanent,
and the ice
is thicker
than that
in other
parts of
the Arctic.
There the
ice sheet is
constantly pushing against the coast.
By contrast, in other parts of the
Arctic such as the West Barents, Southwest Greenland, and the Labrador shelf
there is often no pack ice, or limited
seasonal ice which remains frozen for a
short period. Pack ice can limit drilling
to certain times of year and also require
that installations be able to resist the
load placed on them by the movement
of the ice sheet.
Icebergs are also an issue in some
basins, such as Baffin Bay, but not in
others. Rigs and platforms that are

positioned in an area affected by icebergs must be detachable in order to
avoid impact, or they need a significant
investment in iceberg management that
ensures that icebergs are deflected away
from the installation.

License availability
A further constraint on the level of
exploration in a basin is whether or not
an area is available for licensing.
While all the governments that have
jurisdiction over the Arctic are broadly
in favor of oil and gas exploration, the
availability of licenses varies greatly
from basin to basin.
Canada publishes an annual call for
nominations covering the majority of
the Beaufort-Mackenzie and Franklinian-Sverdrup basins, while there is no
active licensing in Baffin Bay.

of Arctic-class drilling rigs. Mobilizing
these in the most remote parts of the
Arctic can be very expensive. An alternative is to drill from spray-ice islands,
although this technology has not been
used widely outside Canada.
The high costs of drilling and seismic acquisition in the Arctic mean that
the upfront costs will be large. The fact
that the frontier basins do not contain
proven plays means that this is a very
high-risk strategy, and this will only be
successful if large and profitable fields
need to be discovered.
Only the frontier basins with the
highest yet-to-find potential can be
considered as attractive opportunities
for Frontier Exploration.
Most companies will have Frontier
Exploration as part of their overall
resource capture strategy, but only small
specialist companies would focus on
this exclusively. The companies that
consider Frontier Exploration in the
Arctic will be those that have the greatest appetite for risk because these basins
contain some of the most high-risk
opportunities in the world.

Arctic frontier basins
The frontier basins with the best
yet-to-find potential are the Kronprins
Christian basin east of northern Greenland, the Southwest Greenland basin,
and the Laptev Sea, which lies north of
Eastern Siberia.
All of these have material yet-to-find
potential, but their specific advantages
are very distinct.
Kronprins Christian is attractive
mainly because of the sheer size of its
yet-to-find potential. This basin faces
many of the most severe challenges in
the Arctic, with permanent ice along
the entire coastline, extreme remoteness
from markets and population centers,
and no active licensing at present.
In contrast Southwest Greenland has
around half of the resource potential

of Kronprins Christian, but it is close
to the markets in the eastern US, is ice
free for much of the year, and is actively
promoted by Greenland authorities. All
of this makes it more likely that discoveries will be developed.
The Laptev Sea is attractive mainly
because of the presence of a small
number of large oil prospects that could
prove highly profitable despite the difficultly in exporting oil from such a
remote part of the world.
These basins present the potential to
be profitable for explorers, but the risks
both below ground and above ground
are very high.
The Arctic is rightly considered to be
a difficult environment for oil and gas
companies to prosper. By understanding the differences between the different Arctic basins, companies can find
opportunities to grow their business in
the Arctic areas that fit best with their
chosen growth strategies. ✦

The process could help mitigate
expected shortages in global natural gas
supply during the next few decades in
an environmentally responsible manner.
Current energy-intensive methods often
cannot economically remove CO2 or
H2S in existing or newly discovered gas
fields if the gas contains more than 15%
CO2 or H2S.
Selective absorption in an aqueous
solution is the standard technique for
removing these gaseous contaminants
from methane.1 High contamination
levels, however, require unacceptable levels of energy consumption for
purification. These existing technologies
require more energy than the energy in
the purified gas.
Absorption and membrane technologies are understood processes that offer
no economic prospects for these fields.

Shell research project
A Shell research program investigated the application of novel rotational
separation technologies starting with
centrifugal gas separation.2-4 It established that applying this process to
clean natural gas differs from that used
in uranium enrichment, its typical use.
A modeling and experimental program,
however, also showed that building
small compact units
for a gas centrifuge device was not
feasible because of
long separation times
required because
gaseous diffusion is
slow.5
A phase change is the only way to
accelerate separation.
The program thus developed the
condensing centrifuge, a novel concept
based on the gas centrifuge.6 In this
device, unlike other devices, the centrifuge operates at elevated pressure so
that the CO2 condenses at the centrifuge
periphery.
Although this improves separation compared to the purely gas-phase
centrifuge, it was too slow to make the

process attractive for production sites
producing 100-500 MMscfd. The slowness is caused by the interior part of the
condensing centrifuge still operating in
the gas phase.
Gas-phase centrifugal processes are
restricted by the fact that the product
of density and diffusion coefficient is
constant. Although mass flows increase,
operation at high pressures leads to
slower separation without improving
net overall performance.
A way to accelerate the separation
process of the two components was to
include a phase change. This involves
changing the thermodynamic state of
the mixture so that the CO2 becomes a
liquid.
Fig. 1 shows this novel two-step
method that includes:
1. Cooling the gas to a temperature
whereby the gaseous contaminant becomes liquid in the form of a micronsized droplet mist.
2. Separating the mist from the
gas by the rotational particle separator
(rps), a device already used in health
care and environmental emission control.7-9 The process is a spin-off of the
gas centrifuge and is the core innovation in the Shell process.10
High energy demands do not
hamper this method, which has short
residence times and compact units.
It potentially can boost recoverable
38

world gas reserves by amounts that are
energetically equivalent to many billion
barrels of oil.

Thermodynamics
For economic gas-gas separation,
the process has to transform one of the
components into a phase capable of
forming particles. Cooling and condensation will do this.
Because gas in reservoirs is compressed, for example at 130-450 bar,
expansion can attain the necessary
cooling for contaminant condensation.
Even the reduced pressures available top
hole, 80-130 bar, are sufficient to drive
expansion cooling.
An expansion turbine is in most
cases preferred to techniques employing expansion by acceleration such as
the Joule-Thomson process. The turbine
can drive a compressor to bring the gas
back to system pressure. In addition,
after the turbine, the gas velocity can
remain relatively slow. Withdrawing
power from the gas rather than from
gas speed causes the cooling.
This process avoids the risk of heating the gas with internal friction, which
would cause the ultrafine condensed
droplets to evaporate.
Separation of components with condensation to form a phase boundary is
a well established process.11 The method

used is temperature reduction, although
usually with heat exchange rather than
the direct expansion method in the
Shell process.
The latter method is standard in such
processes as producing cryogenic gases
or LNG. The main problem, however, is
the spatial separation of the two phases
that often are intermixed and difficult
to split into separate streams.
The low-pressure side of the expansion refers to a condition that provides
sufficient cooling for forming and
separating the two phases. The product
phase is gaseous, enriched in methane,
with depleted CO2. The waste phase is
liquid, enriched in CO2, and depleted in
methane.
This process, of course, does not
spontaneously lead to a nicely separated
liquid and gas phase. A mixture of fine
CO2-rich droplets forms in a methanerich gas. Between the expansion and
separation steps, the microdroplets will
increase in size sufficiently for separation.
This so-called “induction” process
also takes place in knockout vessels for
removing such components as condensate components with cyclones.
These devices, however, need highvolume throughputs for droplet sizes
greater than about 15 µm and require
much lower mass loadings than are
in contaminated gases. Removal of
smaller droplets is possible but only for
extremely low throughputs, so-called
microcyclones.
In the Shell process, droplet sizes
will be smaller than this with mass
loading much higher than condensate
in gases.
Consider a feed flow (Qf) of contaminated gas that is split into a cleaned-up
stream (Qc) and a waste stream (Qw) of
CO2 rich liquid. Conservation of mass
requires that input is the same as output

Methane recovery

(Equation 1 in accompanying equations
box).
If xi is defined as the concentration
of methane in each of the three streams
(i = f, c, w), then a mass balance on the
methane component yields Equation 2.
The most obvious condition is that
the process should have the highest
concentration xp of methane possible in
the product stream. Simultaneously, the
process needs to minimize the loss of
incoming feed methane into the waste
stream so that the maximum number
of molecules of methane in the feed are
in the product stream. This corresponds
to maximizing the recovery r given by
Equation 3.
The recovery is a function of the
methane concentrations xi. This is seen
by dividing Equation 1 and 2 by Qf and
solving for the two variables Qc/Qf and
Qw/Qf. Because the input concentration
is specified, the recovery is then purely
a function of the product and waste
concentrations derived from thermodynamics.
The methane content in the clean
and waste streams (xc and xw) is
obtained from the pressure and temperature (p and T); however, the p and
T conditions have a large feasible range
with corresponding solutions for xc and
xw.
The calculations need to find realistic
values that also optimize the recovery r
at the same time.
Consider a 50/50 mixture of
CH4/CO2, for example xf = 0.5, which
is representative for contaminated gas
and used as a basis of design. For the
optimum values of product concentration xc and methane recovery r for a
variety of pressures and temperatures,12
the lower bound for these conditions
can be obtained from an evaluation of
the phase boundary for pure CO2 in the
freeze-out curve in Fig. 2.
Most materials have a triple point
below atmospheric pressure with
normal melting and boiling points corresponding to the temperature points at
1 atm where solid-liquid and liquid-gas
transitions occur, respectively. For CO2,
however, the triple point is above atmo-

spheric pressure.
For CO2, pt is 5.1 bar and Tt is –56.6º
C. The subscript t refers to the triplepoint conditions.
Fig. 2 shows that operation in the
liquid regime requires that the process
is greater than 5 bar and –56° C. This
forms the minimum value for the thermodynamic conditions.
The maximum value is set by reasonable pressures for the expansion and
bearing in mind that this is after the
cooling expansion phase.
Fig. 3 shows the methane recovery r plotted against methane product
concentration xc for a range of pressures
and temperatures, as obtained from
an extended cubic equation of state
simulation based on the Soave-RedlichKwong model. The figure shows that a
single separation step will obtain high
methane recoveries; however, the problem requires maximizing the methane
concentration in the product stream.
At the ideal point xc ≈ r ≈ 0.85, the
turbine inlet pressure would be 600
bar, which is unrealistic. In general,
given the restrictions for pipe WT and
corresponding safety and handling considerations, the process should have an
inlet pressure less than 200 bar.
The question then is to choose the
optimal realistic p and T values for the
separator operation. With too much
expansion, the temperature may be

sufficiently low but the pressure will be
too low for liquefaction to take place. A
restricted expansion, on the other hand,
may have sufficient pressure but not
enough cooling and hence insufficient
yield.
An examination of the various p and
T conditions coupled to the parameters
previously noted shows that an expansion to 25-30 bar, providing the inlet
pressure is greater than 100 bar, gives
significant phase separation.
From a practical engineering standpoint, a 102-bar expander inlet pressure is sufficient for recovering about
95% of the methane into the product
gas stream with a concentration of
about 67%. Note that phase separation
is initiated by the expansion and is only
complete by the end of the induction
period in which the liquid state is materialized in droplets of a few microns
in size. Subsequently, the spatial separation of the dispersed waste and purified
product takes place in the rotational
particle separator.
The foregoing analysis assumes that
the CO2-rich liquid is already in the dispersed waste material of flow rate QW
that will be spatially concentrated and
separated to the waste stream in the rps.

Petroleum Corp. for the 494,000-acre
Amazonian Block 15 (OGJ Online, May
16, 2006). Rodriguez cited the company’s illegal transfer of 40% of its local
operations to EnCana in 2000 as one of
the infractions.
The government had begun to talk
of canceling Oxy’s Block 15 contract
in 2004, leading to speculation that
the February sale of EnCana’s interests
to the Chinese was the culminating
force.
Occidental said that Block 15 operations represented about 7% of its firstquarter 2006 worldwide production.
The company is the largest exporter of
petroleum in Ecuador.
On May 17, Oxy presented a demand
for arbitration with the Ecuadorian government at the International Center for
the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID), Washington, DC.

On Sept. 28, Galo Chiriboga, president of Ecuadoran state petroleum firm
Petroecuador, announced on Ecuador’s
national television that it would establish Rio Napo Operations Co. to operate
oil fields formerly owned by Occidental
(OGJ Online, Sept. 29, 2006).
In early October, Oxy dropped its arbitration claim against Petroecuador but
maintained its claim against the Ecuador
government at ICSID.
Business News Americas reported on
Oct. 30 that PetroEcuador said investment within the country could reach
$5 billion, with reforms.

Change afoot?
From national elections on Oct. 28,
no clear winner emerged. The government announced a runoff, for Nov.
26, between the two top vote-getters:
leftist Raphael Correa, US-educated
economist; and banana magnate Alvaro
Naboa, from the wealthiest family in
Ecuador.
Following the election, the announcement of the next energy minister may indicate whether the new
administration will focus on promoting foreign oil and gas investment or

Although every site is different, there
are some common or basic components
needed in an analysis of the “as-built”
condition of the site’s layers of protection. The overall intent is to assess the
areas of risk and potential areas for
improvement.
The areas that should be considered
are:
• Regulatory compliance.
• Instrumentation and control.
• Asset and abnormal situation management.
• Physical and system security.
• Work practices and policies.

Regulatory compliance
At the highest level, a safety program for any refinery in the US should
conform to the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA)
standard. These regulations require that
programs are developed and implemented including these provisions:
written procedures, training for process
maintenance activities, inspection and
testing, equipment deficiencies, and
quality assurance.
OSHA and EPA regulations are performance based, allowing the owneroperator of the facility a great degree of
latitude to implement a program that
is most suitable for the organization
and site, as long as it meets the general
requirements listed in the standard.
Industry has been supportive of the
goals promulgated in these standards
and has supported their implementation
by providing standards, recommended
practices, and technical reports that
provide guidelines for these regulations.
Industry groups for areas where their
membership has particular expertise
publish this additional guidance.
Although the program that an
owner-operator implements at a specific
site is not required to be identical to
the standards, recommended practices,
and technical reports provided by
these bodies, they provide an excellent
benchmark for the practices of industry.
If a site’s programs do not conform to
these guidelines, there should be a solid

and installation is ensured.

Classiﬁcation

Safety instrumented systems

All instrumentation and control
equipment should be classified. EPA and
OSHA regulations and many industry standards are risk-based, allowing
maintenance and testing resources to be
disproportionately spent in areas where
higher risk is perceived.
In addition, different standards are
applied to different kinds of instrumentation. A good classification process is a
necessary first step in implementation
of a mechanical integrity program.
An appropriate industry standard
that can be used as a guideline for
this task is ISA 91.01, “Identification
of Emergency Shutdown Systems and
Controls that are Critical to Maintaining
Safety in Process Industries.”

Programs for safety-instrumented
systems are generally performed in accordance with ISA 84.00.01, “Functional Safety: Safety Instrumented Systems
for the Process Industry Sector.”
This standard requires that all safetyinstrumented functions be classified
with a safety integrity level of 1, 2, or
3. The equipment selection and test plan
is developed in concert with a quantitative reliability assessment showing that
the probability of failure of demand estimated for the system is in accordance
with the safety integrity level selected.

Identify programs
The body of instrumentation and
control equipment should be subdivided into categories. These are at the
discretion of the plant operator to some
degree but typically include:
• Regulatory control systems. These
are not protective and include instrument categories not listed hereafter.
• Safety instrumented systems.
• Alarm systems.
• Fire and gas systems.
• Burner management systems.
• Compressor, turbine monitoring
systems.

Regulatory controls
A program for integrity of regulatory
controls is generally considered less
critical than the program for protective
functions; however, without good regulatory control the likelihood of an upset
increases, as does a resulting escalation
to process incident.
Considering that most business decisions made in a plant are ultimately carried out by the control loop (arguably,
the heart of any automation system), it
is alarming that two thirds of all control
loops perform in a disruptive or ineffective manner.
With some manner of control-performance monitoring service, closed
loop operating data can be used to
identify areas where maintenance and

ASM consortium
The abnormal situation management (ASM) consortium
(www.asmconsortium.com) was informally started in 1992 and
formally chartered in 1994 to enable and empower operating
teams to proactively manage their plants, maximize safety, and
minimize environmental impacts while allowing the processes
to be pushed to their optimal limits. Original ASM consortium
members included Honeywell, Chevron Corp., Exxon Corp.,

Co., and Texaco Corp.

reliable operation of the control system.
Establishing clear system performance
criteria and an analysis of the effect of
any changes that may have been made
to the existing control system in the
past is the key to success.

Auxiliary systems
Other systems in the refinery may
be left out of the standard safety audit.
They are typically handled by other
departments but play an integral part in
a plant’s safety. Consider, for example:
• Fire and gas systems are typically
designed in accordance with NFPA
72, “National Fire Alarm Code.” This
guideline provides prescriptive requirements for equipment selection, installa46

API 611, 616, 617, and 618.
• Simple manually activated protective functions are typically designed in
accordance with the “emergency stop”
provisions on the NFPA 79 standard. In
addition, they are generally designed
to operate as an “independent protection layer” in conformance with AIChE
guidelines.
• Complex manually activated
functions. Some manually activated
functions are so complex and situationspecific that general industry guidance
is either unavailable or unacceptable. In
these cases special extra care should be
taken in their design and testing.

Asset management, ASM
The role of the operator is currently
in a state of evolution partially brought
on by the use of new technologies,
downsizing of operating departments,
and increased competitiveness in the
industry. This evolution is significantly
affecting the role and responsibilities of
the “traditional” operator as well as the
support elements required to make the
operator successful in this environment.
To stay competitive and continue to
advance abnormal situation management (ASM) practices in the future,
companies must align their operations
personnel to these necessary roles and
responsibilities.
Any safety audit should consider the
operating environment to assess whether a site has harnessed its respective
technology appropriately in providing a
truly effective operating environment. It
should consider:
• Operator interface.
• Alarm system performance.
• Boundary and constraint management.
• Procedural automation.
• Asset effectiveness.

Operator interface
Using generally accepted industry
guidelines, one should examine the
process-operating environment. For
example, using the evaluation methods
developed by the ASM consortium (see
box on this page) in conjunction with
basic human factor design principles,
one might consider operator task analysis, ease of access to information, alarm
handling, and navigation.
In addition, the display-based operator interface can be reviewed for consistency with known standards. The intent
is to review the following, looking for
areas for improvement:
• Display organization and navigation.
• Context-sensitive access to information.
• Integration of auxiliary information (operating procedures, operator
help, etc.).

The current operator procedures
and workflow used on site should be
considered. An evaluation of the procedure workflow, as well as an assessment
of the availability of data and standard
tools and capabilities aimed at improving workflows and procedures may help
to answer these questions.

Asset effectiveness
Directly related to the prevention of
abnormal situations is the maintenance
of a plant’s assets. According to the ASM
consortium, at least one-third of abnormal situations occurring in a typical
processing plant are due to equipment
problems.
Because operators must ultimately
deal with these failures when they
occur and given the possibility of the
operator incorrectly recognizing the
problem, it is important to consider asset management as a layer of protection.
Proper procedures and work practices
in the area of asset management can
prevent an operator from ever needing
to deal with the issue in the first place.
For a particular asset, no matter how
big or small, an increase in availability
is directly related to reliability. Reliability is the probability of equipment or
systems functioning without failure for
a stated period of time.
The achievement of availability is
supported by a range of frequently
talked about operation-based initiatives,
including reliability, asset management,
and ASM—an intense focus on the root
causes of unplanned shutdowns and the
procedures and technical tools that can
help operators deal with upsets when
they occur or prevent them from happening in the first place.

Physical, system security
Although perhaps not obvious in the
context of a safety discussion, plant and
process security is integral to ensuring
plant safety. Not all upsets or incidents
come from within.
An audit would be remiss if it did
not consider the layers relating to plant
and process security. An effective apOil & Gas Journal / Nov. 13, 2006

Work practices, policies
In “The Human Factor,” Kim Vicente
points out the way humans and technology interact at the physical (ergonomic), psychological (individual),
team, organization, and political levels.
In the case of safety, the marrying of
technology with humans is key to preventing serious if not fatal incidents.
One of the main barriers to adoption
of a safe working environment occurs at
the organizational-political level. There
are many examples of instances of
excellence at the physical, psychological, and team level. To solidify the future
of safety at a plant, organization and
political issues must be considered.

In order to complete a safety audit,
one must examine the plant’s leadership involvement in HSE self-assessment
and audit processes, executive audits,
recordable incident reviews, and risk
assessment process.

Layers of protection
In many discussions of hazard assessment, the layers-of-protection concept
is described as multiple layers of Swiss
cheese (Fig. 2). In this model, the
process has multiple layers of protection
and that protective systems have “holes”
that represent failures of a particular
layer.
The holes may represent errors or
lapses of attentions or perhaps poor
maintenance or design, and the size of
the holes simply represent the fraction of time that the system fails due
to component failures. The bigger the
holes and the fewer the layers the better
the chance of a failure passing through.
The intent of any methodology
aimed at ensuring a holistic approach
to safety is to reduce the size of holes in
the layers, and to ensure that multiple
layers of protection indeed do exist. ✦

Problems faced by the
Greater Gorgon Project
in Western Australia reflect challenges to all the
potential LNG projects in
the region (map). GreatLNG
er Gorgon is the largest
among potential LNG
export projects in Western Australia.
Phase 1 will provide 10 million
tonnes/year (tpy) of
LNG capacity; second
phase should deliver
the same again.
As with any project
of this scale, there
have been major
challenges. Costs have
increased, the schedule has slipped, the
development plan has been criticized by
environmental authorities, and uncertainties remain over partner alignment.
• Phase 1 is now expected to cost
upwards of A$16.8 billion (US$12
billion), a 53% increase on the 2005
estimate of A$11 billion.

ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
concluded that the project is environmentally unacceptable. The gas plant
and liquefaction trains will be located
on Barrow Island, a Class A nature reserve, and there are concerns about the
effect of development on local wildlife.
• ExxonMobil Corp., which is a
25% partner in the project, has yet to
announce any sales agreements for its
share of planned LNG volumes.
Despite these problems, the fundamental business case for the project is
strong. The Pacific Basin LNG market is
short of supply over the next 5-7 years,
and buyers are beginning to accept the
new reality of higher gas prices. Thus
rising costs of the Gorgon development can, to an extent, be passed on to
buyers.
The final decision on environmental
approval rests with WA’s Environment
Minister who will consider social, strategic, and economic effects, alongside
environmental issues. Wood Mackenzie
expects the minister to seek a solution
that will mitigate the environmental

impact of the project and allow it to
proceed, largely as planned.
ExxonMobil’s position is a relatively
straightforward commercial consideration. As and when the company
secures a price for its gas that accommodates risks attendant to the project
and when development costs are clearer,
ExxonMobil will likely conclude sales
agreements and stand alongside the
other partners.

Consequently, the EPA considered that
the proposals were environmentally
unacceptable.
The EPA decision is a recommendation to the state’s environment minister and also sets out conditions to
which the project must adhere, if it
goes ahead. Operator Chevron Australia is appealing the decisions, both the
recommendation and the development
conditions set.

development costs.

ExxonMobil’s position

Environmental concerns
On Barrow Island, a Class A nature
reserve and proposed location of the
processing facilities and liquefaction
plant, there are strict quarantine regulations. The island is also a nesting area
for flatback turtles, with two nesting
beaches adjacent to the proposed LNG
plant.
On June 6, 2006, Western Australia’s
Environmental Protection Agency issued
Bulletin No. 1221 stating that Greater
Gorgon’s joint venture posed an unacceptable risk to the marine ecosystem
through dredging and possible introduction of non-indigenous species.
It also stated that, because very little
data are available on the life cycle and
behavior of the turtles, it was impossible to identify management measures
that would ensure their wellbeing.

ExxonMobil has yet to announce
any gas sales contracts for its equity
volumes of LNG from the development.
Most likely, this is primarily a result of
commercial considerations from the
company’s perspective. ExxonMobil
is understood to be operating under
a less favorable tax position than the
other two partners (Chevron and Royal
Dutch/Shell), due to its operations in
the Bass Strait.
Under Australian tax rules, companies build up Petroleum Resource
Rent Tax (PRRT) credits from exploration losses, which can be transferred
between PRRT-liable projects. Neither
Chevron nor Shell has any producing
assets that are taxed under the PRRT
regime, meaning that their PRRT credits
may be utilized by Gorgon production.
ExxonMobil will likely be able to

conclude contracts to sell its share of
the LNG at a price that makes the project attractive within its global portfolio.
This may still contribute some delays to
the decision-making process, however.

Other issues
Other issues face Greater Gorgon
that, while they may not threaten its
viability, could still delay progress and
dilute project economics.

BP’s position
BP holds 12.5% equity in two of
three blocks that cover giant Io/Jansz
field, plus a block covering Maenad and
Orthrus fields and one over Geryon
field. Io/Jansz field is an integral part
of Phase 1 development. BP remains
outside the framework agreement,
signed in April 2005, which aligned the
interests of the other three partners and
allowed the current development plan
to progress.
Recent press speculation has BP looking to sell out of the acreage. Any sale
would be subject to pre-emption rights
by the other partners, and Shell Australia has said it may look at the stake, if it
came onto the market. If a third party
were to purchase BP’s stake, it would
remain outside the framework agreement and may only be able to negotiate
a small equity stake in the project.

Domestic gas allocation
In February 2006, WA’s government issued a consultation paper
regarding future domestic gas-supply
arrangements for the state. The North
West Shelf gas project (NWSGP) currently supplies around 70% of the WA
domestic market, but essentially all gas
reserved under the NWSGP state agreement has been fully contracted.
The state government is seeking to
reserve an additional amount of NWSGP gas to meet future demand, as well
as alternative supplies from proposed
LNG developments on the WA coast.
Gas fields supplying the proposed
developments lie in federal not state
waters. As such, the state government

has no direct rights to the gas, but it
must approve onshore developments
and grant export licenses.
The paper declared that it would
be prudent to impose domestic-gas
reservation requirements on future
LNG export projects. WA Premier Alan
Carpenter has proposed that 15-20%
of gas reserves should be allocated to
the domestic market. The Gorgon State
Agreement reserves 1.85 tcf of gas
for the domestic market, but the joint
venture only has an obligation to supply
this gas if it is economic to do so.
From a commercial perspective, the
major stumbling block is price. Wood
Mackenzie believes that NWSGP sells
domestic gas at around a 60% discount
to the price realized under its current
Japanese LNG contracts, a discount well
more than the cost of liquefaction.
Additional gas resources, such as the
Chandon discovery, could increase the
pressure on Greater Gorgon to supply
the domestic market simply because
current proven and probable reserves
are already well in excess of requirements for a 10-million-tpy LNG project.
While the state government appears to back intervention, the federal
government has taken a diametrically
opposed view. In May 2006, the federal
minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources stated that “artificial constraints
on export capacity, such as domestic
gas reservations, are not part of this
government’s approach.”

tal expenditure in the project’s upstream
phase. This will gradually shift more
revenue to the upstream (higher tax)
phase and steadily increase the project’s
overall tax burden.
Within the scope of the regulations,
however, lies room for an “advanced
pricing arrangement” (APA), which
would take priority over RPM. An APA
is a negotiated transfer price, agreed
between a project joint venture and tax
authorities. It is understood that Chevron is looking to negotiate an APA for
Greater Gorgon, but this could take up
to 2 years to conclude.

Wider implications

The decision of Western Australia’s
Environment Minister could have wide
implications for the Australian gas export industry.
Five major projects, with capacity totaling around 40 million tpy, are
proposed for the WA coast over the next
10-15 years.
If the minister were to rule against
locating LNG facilities on Barrow
Island, then those projects that propose
to use other greenfield sites–specifically
Ichthys and Browse–could be under
threat.
INPEX-led Ichthys is located in
Browse Basin and proposes to use two
islands for its LNG facility. The Woodside-led Browse project will operate
in and around Scott Reef, which could
invoke environmental concerns.

wants to build an import terminal with
initial capacity of 6-9 billion cu m/year.
Cost estimates run to €400 million,
with additional investment required for
a pipeline connection to the regional

4Gas chose Bordeaux because it is
close to the Spanish market and has
good port infrastructure. The specific
site is at Le Verdon at the mouth of the
La Gironde. This is the company’s fourth
terminal project and follows the Dragon
LNG venture under construction at Milford Haven, Wales, as well as two other
terminals planned in Rotterdam and
Canada’s Nova Scotia province.

Despite tight supply conditions,
EdFT is betting that it will be able to secure cargoes to fill the slots at Montoire.
“Early on,” said one company official,
“we decided that coming up with a
nicely packaged suite of contracts with
a bow on it wasn’t possible.” Instead,
the firm chose to acquire regasification
capacity to distinguish itself from other
would-be buyers.
EdFT is confident that experience
and a large, flexible contract portfolio
will give it competitive advantage in
the region. “The trick is how to get
the gas from Montoire to somewhere
actually useful,” the source said. The
bet also reflected bullish forward prices
for winter gas in Northwest Europe,
which tagged it as a premium market,
although since then the forward price
curve has declined.

consumers are eligible to select their
gas providers. Yet only about 35,000
have made a selection, and most of
these opted to stay with their provider.
Only about 300 switched to an alternative provider that offers gas at competitively determined prices.
Part of the problem is that GdF
contracted gas supplies under longterm agreements, and these will only
expire gradually. But EU competition
authorities suspect GdF of abusing its
dominant position, and the company
was among 20 firms raided in May in
an antitrust crackdown.
French politicians can only take so
much when it comes to market liberalization and reached their limit when
they learned that Italy’s Enel planned
to acquire utility Suez. Prime Minister
Dominique de Villepin subsequently
brokered a hasty merger agreement
between Suez and GdF. The agreement

would reduce the state’s share in the
combined entity to less than 50%.
This flagrant economic nationalism brought protests from EU
regulators, who are investigating the
merger’s likely impact on competition, and from French unions, which
say that the government is breaking its
pledge—enshrined in Gallic law—to
retain a majority stake in GdF. On Oct.
3 the National Assembly, France’s lower
house, approved the privatization amid
strikes and protests, and the Senate will
begin its debate shortly.
Meanwhile, the European Commission has provided detailed objections
to the merger. These focus on Belgium,
where the combined entity would have
a near-monopoly on gas and electricity, but also on France. Aspiring market
players, including Gazprom, Enel, and
Centrica, are eagerly awaiting the announcement of possible asset sales to

comply with the regulatory demands.
The merger, somewhat paradoxically,
might further increase competition for
LNG imports in the French gas market.
As a sweetener to the antimonopoly
authority, GdF has offered to expand its
Montoire terminal to anywhere from
12 to 16 billion cu m/year from the
current 10 billion cu m/year, with the
extra capacity to be offered to third
parties.
If the merger proceeds, it also said it
would functionally separate its French
LNG business from other operations. As
often occurs when a dominant player
makes concessions, though, the olive
branch warrants a closer look. Its offer
comes on the heels of the Bordeaux,
Antifer, and Dunkirk terminal announcements, and could be seen as a
move to preempt its competitors as well
as a further shove against the half-open
door of the French gas market. ✦

Confusion evident
in blast at OPEC
about production
It has long been a mystery how the US
Congress can so consistently wander astray
on oil and gas. Now we know. Guidance on
the subject comes from the Joint Economic
Committee.
On the question of oil price volatility, the
JEC has produced a culprit: the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Yes, it’s OPEC’s fault that the price of
crude spurted to $70/bbl this year. The

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s

group, JEC says, could have defended its
long-gone $22-28/bbl price band after Asian
demand spurted and supply fell for one reason after another. But it didn’t.
“If OPEC had announced continued support of the $22 to $28 price range in recent
years and taken vigorous action to increase
oil output and oil pumping capacity, then
the unexpected shift in demand would not
have raised the price by as much or for
as long,” says a new JEC research report.
“Knowledge that the supplier with the largest crude oil reserves would raise its production rate to accommodate incremental
demand would have reduced precautionary
buying in the spot market and hedging
activity in the futures market.”
Instead, OPEC was “opportunistic.”
The group’s recent attempt to trim output
proves it. Or so the JEC says.
Nonsense. The idea that OPEC could
have increased production appreciably any
time after 2002 is ludicrous. Prices have
been high not because OPEC wouldn’t
boost output but because it couldn’t.
Although major OPEC producers are in fact
adding capacity, the ability to raise output
at will remains precariously low.
Prices are falling now partly because
several years of production at maximum
practical rates have reﬁlled inventories.
But storage has limits. Production beyond
immediate needs of a market in which
demand growth is slowing soon will have
nowhere to go. In effect, the market is
rebuilding its defenses against supply
emergencies: ﬁrst inventories, soon spare
production capacity. The JEC should be
cheering.
Instead, it alleges manipulation and
conspiracy and faults producers for earning
money by doing what global consumers
needed them to do. Unbelievable.
The JEC’s aspersions won’t hurt OPEC.
But the misapprehension they betray gives
anyone interested in energy policy reason
to worry.

2006 crude prices may have bottomed out
The December contract for benchmark US crudes apparently bottomed out at a
new ﬂoor of $57.05/bbl in intraday trading Oct. 31 before closing at $58.73/bbl, up
37¢ for the day in a late technical rally that forced many traders to cover lower-priced
sales positions on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The December crude contract climbed to $59.14/bbl Nov. 3 on NYMEX in the wake
of an apparently false telephone bomb threat against BP PLC’s 400,000 b/d reﬁnery
in Whiting, Ind. Meanwhile, a militant group in Nigeria gave international oil companies 72 hours to evacuate facilities in the proliﬁc Niger Delta prior to threatened
attacks on as many as 20 facilities during “Operation Black November.”
An earlier threat to the Ras Tanura oil terminal off Saudi Arabia prompted a sharp
rise in oil prices, which then declined when no attack transpired (OGJ Online, Oct.
30, 2006). However, oil prices rebounded sharply on renewed threats of attacks on
the international oil infrastructure, missile tests by Iran, and strong employment
numbers that quelled fears of a sharp slowdown in the US economy. “Interestingly
though, oil prices really didn’t react to [the latest] US inventory data, which revealed
a slightly less-than-expected draw in crude stocks along with much larger-than-projected draws in gasoline and distillate inventories,” said Robert S. Morris, Banc of
America Securities LLC, New York.
The Energy Information Administration reported that commercial inventories of
benchmark US crudes increased by 2 million bbl to 334.3 million bbl in the week ended
Oct. 27. The rise followed an unexpected drop of 3.3 million bbl the previous week when
the 3-day closure of the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port cut US crude imports by a whopping
936,000 b/d to 9.5 million b/d. Gasoline stocks fell 2.8 million bbl to 204.6 million bbl in
the latest period. Distillate fuel inventories dropped 2.7 million bbl to 141.3 million bbl,
with a 3.2 million bbl increase in ultralow-sulfur diesel fuel offset by a 4.4 million bbl
drop in conventional diesel and a 1.5 million bbl decline in heating oil.
Although members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (other
than Iraq) said they would cut crude production by 1.2 million b/d to 26.3 million
b/d, the industry was still looking for evidence of any serious rollbacks by Nov. 1.
Meanwhile, Indonesia said it would not reduce production. Its September production
topped out at 862,900 b/d and it was a net importer of crude in May-July, sources
said. Nigeria and Venezuela also have production problems and generally are not
expected to reduce output either.
Natural gas
The December natural gas contract increased 7¢ to $7.88/MMbtu Nov. 3 on NYMEX, its fourth consecutive gain in as many sessions. After previously increasing
from a 4-year low, composite spot natural gas prices retreated that week, however,
due largely to forecasts of warm weather. Although residual fuel oil prices dropped
below natural gas prices in some key regions, Morris said, “We do not believe any
fuel switching away from natural gas and back to residual fuel oil occurred.”
EIA reported withdrawal of 9 bcf of natural gas from US underground storage in
the week ended Oct. 27, compared with injections of 19 bcf the previous week and
27 bcf during the same period last year. US gas storage was at 3.45 tcf, up 288 bcf
from a year ago and 276 bcf above the 5-year average (OGJ Online, Nov. 2, 2006).
Withdrawals of gas from US storage during October “are quite rare,” said analysts at
Barclays Capital Inc., London.
Meanwhile, Ronald J. Barone, managing director of UBS Securities LLC, New
York, said, “Shortages of natural gas feedstock in the global market are signiﬁcantly
constraining both the operation of existing liquefaction plants and the development
of new LNG projects. Several large exporting terminals around the world are sitting
idle due to the lack of available natural gas supply. Some of the impacted gas-exporting counties include major international players such as Oman, Malaysia, Indonesia,
Trinidad, and Nigeria. Oman LNG, for example, has 1 million tons/yr of spare capacity due to feedstock shortages,” Barone added. “With most of the existing production already committed under long- or medium-term contracts, the shortage of
feedstock to feed the available spare capacity is having a greater effect on an already
constrained spot market. Consequently, importing counties, such as the US, are
experiencing a steady decline of LNG shipments. (The US decline is largely due to
upstream difﬁculties in Trinidad, the country’s largest exporting partner, speciﬁcally
at Trinidad’s Atlantic LNG Train 4.)”

Foreword

 
This 2006 version of SPE’s Petroleum Engineering Handbook is the result of several years of effort by technical editors, copy edi-
tors, and authors. It is designed as a handbook rather than a basic text. As such, it will be of most beneﬁ t to those with some experience 
in the industry who require additional information and guidance in areas outside their areas of expertise. Authors for each of the more 
than 100 chapters were chosen carefully for their experience and expertise. The resulting product of their efforts represents the best 
current thinking on the various technical subjects covered in the Handbook.
  
The rate of growth in hydrocarbon extraction technology is continuing at the high level experienced in the last decades of the 20th 
century. As a result, any static compilation, such as this Handbook, will contain certain information that is out of date at the time of pub-
lication. However, many of the concepts and approaches presented will continue to be applicable in your studies, and, by documenting 
the technology in this way, it provides new professionals an insight into the many factors to be considered in assessing various aspects 
of a vibrant and dynamic industry.
 
The Handbook is a continuation of SPE’s primary mission of technology transfer. Its direct descendents are the “Frick” Handbook, 
published in 1952, and the “Bradley” Handbook, published in 1987. This version is different from the previous in the following ways:

 
 
 
 

(cid:129) It has multiple volumes in six different technical areas with more than 100 chapters.
(cid:129) There is expanded coverage in several areas such as health, safety, and environment.
(cid:129) It contains entirely new coverage on Drilling Engineering and Emerging and Peripheral Technologies.
(cid:129) Electronic versions are available in addition to the standard bound volumes.

This Handbook has been a monumental undertaking that is the result of many people’s efforts. I am pleased to single out the con-

 
tributions of the six volume editors:

General Engineering—John R. Fanchi, Colorado School of Mines
Drilling Engineering—Robert F. Mitchell, Landmark Graphics Corp.
Facilities and Construction Engineering—Kenneth E. Arnold, AMEC Paragon
Production Operations Engineering—Joe D. Clegg, Shell Oil Co., retired
Reservoir Engineering and Petrophysics—Ed Holstein, Exxon Production Co., retired
Emerging and Peripheral Technologies—Hal R. Warner, Arco Oil and Gas, retired

It is to these individuals, along with the authors, the copy editors, and the SPE staff, that accolades for this effort belong. It has been 

 
my pleasure to work with and learn from them.

Preface

General Engineering, Volume I of the new Petroleum Engineering Handbook, has been designed to present 
 
material that is needed by all practicing petroleum engineers. It includes chapters on mathematics, properties of 
ﬂ uids, rock properties, rock/ﬂ uid interactions, economics, the law, and the social context of fossil energy.
 
The mathematics chapters of this volume are a major departure from previous editions. The mathematical tables 
presented in previous editions are now readily available using hand-held calculators or software on desktop comput-
ers. The mathematics chapters present mathematical topics that petroleum engineers need to better understand the 
literature and the software they use on a day-to-day basis. Topics such as vibrating systems, ordinary and partial 
differential equations, linear algebra and matrices, and Green’s functions are introduced and references are provided 
for readers who would like to pursue the topics in more detail.
The  discussion  of  ﬂ uid  properties  covers  ﬂ uid  sampling  techniques;  properties  and  correlations  of  oil,  gas, 
 
condensate, and water; hydrocarbon phase behavior and phase diagrams for hydrocarbon systems; and the phase 
behavior of water/hydrocarbon systems. Two chapters consider the properties of waxes, asphaltenes, and crude oil 
emulsions.
 
Rock properties and rock/ﬂ uid interactions are discussed. The rock properties include bulk rock properties, such 
as porosity, elastic rock properties, and rock failure relationships. Measurement techniques and models of single-
phase permeability are then presented, followed by a review of the properties that describe the interaction between 
rocks and ﬂ uids, notably relative permeability and capillary pressure.
 
In  addition  to  mathematics,  ﬂ uid  properties,  and  rock  properties,  petroleum  engineers  need  to  understand 
economic and legal issues. Essential aspects of the economic and regulatory environment are addressed in the last 
section. A brief review of the role of fossil energy in the 21st century energy mix ends the volume.
 

I want to thank all of the authors who donated their time and expertise to the preparation of this volume.

Chapter 1
Mathematics of Vibrating Systems
Alfred W. Eustes, III, SPE, Colorado School of Mines

1.1 Introduction
Many mathematical tools can be used to analyze vibrational systems. One of the first mathemat-
ical  tools  a  neophyte  engineer  learns  is  calculus.  The  basics  of  limits,  differentiation,  and
integration  permeate  all  of  engineering  mathematics.  This  chapter  offers  a  cursory  review  of
these topics and uses the mathematics of vibrations to demonstrate how the concepts operate.
For more specific information on all these topics, consult relevant sections of this Handbook.

Many  of  the  mathematical  tools  engineers  use  to  evaluate  and  predict  behavior,  such  as
vibrations, require equations that have continuously varying terms. Often, there are many terms
regarding  the  rate  of  change,  or  the  rate  of  change  of  the  rate  of  change,  and  so  forth,  with
respect to some basis. For example, a velocity is the rate of change of distance with respect to
time. Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity, which makes it the rate of change of
the rate of change of distance with respect to time. Determining the solutions to these types of
equations is the basis of differential calculus.

An equation with continuously varying terms is a differential equation. If only one basis is
changing, then it is an ordinary differential equation (ODE); however, if two or more bases are
changing, then it is a partial differential equation (PDE). An ODE uses the notation “d” and a
PDE uses ∂ to refer to change.

Understanding differentiation starts with an understanding of limits.

1.1.1 Limits.  A graph is a useful method for determining how an equation behaves. The inde-
pendent variable t in Eq. 1.1 determines how the dependent variable y behaves. The operators
and  constants  in  an  equation  specify  this  behavior.  Fig.  1.1  shows  the  graph  of  Eq.  1.1,  the
distance of freefall over time with an initial velocity of zero. Down is considered negative in
this equation:

y =

−gct2
2

. ................................................................. (1.1)

The  x-axis  (abscissa)  usually  is  the  independent variable, and  the  y-axis  (ordinate) usually
is the dependent variable; however, many drilling charts hold an exception to this generality, in

I-2

that  their  ordinate  often  is  the  independent  variable,  and  their  abscissa  is  the  dependent  one.
An example of such a drilling chart is the depth vs. time graph.

In Fig. 1.1, at the time of 3 seconds, the distance is –96.522 ft. A tangent line to the graph
at 3 seconds is known as the slope (A) of the graph at that point. To quickly estimate the slope
of the tangent, divide the rise (Δy) by the run (Δt), as shown in Eq. 1.2:

A =

y2 − y1
t2 − t1

= Δy

Δt . .......................................................... (1.2)

In this case, the tangent y value at 2 seconds is –48.261 ft and at 4 seconds is –241.305 ft.

The slope then is:

A = −241.305 − − 48.261

4 − 2

= −193.044

2

= − 96.522. ............................... (1.3)

Because the units in this case are ft/sec, this slope gives the velocity at that point. It is the rate
of change of the distance with respect to time.

A  limit  is  defined  as  the  value  of  a  function  at  a  given  point  as  that  point  is  approached
from  either  higher  or  lower  values  (often  referred  to  as  approaching  from  the  left  or  right,
respectively). The limit (Y) of Eq. 1.1 at 3 seconds is:

−gct2
2

Y = lim
t → 3

. ............................................................. (1.4)

Y  is  known  as  the  limit  of  the  function.  In  this  simple  case,  Y  is  the  same  regardless  of
whether t approaches 3 from the left or the right. This is not true in all cases, however (e.g.,
with  a  discontinuous  function).  In  these  cases,  the  limit  can  be  determined  analytically.  One
can also determine the limit using a graph such as in Fig. 1.1.

Limits have the following properties:

If

lim
t → z

f(t) = P and lim
t → z

g(t) = Q,

then lim
t → z

f(t) + g(t) = P + Q, .................... (1.5)

r jz J − j. .................................................. (1.8)

1.1.2 Derivatives.  As noted earlier, the slope of graph of Eq. 1.1 at 3 seconds = –96.522 ft/
sec  and  is  the  velocity  (v)  of  free-fall  at  3  seconds  from  release.  This  value  is  known  as  the
first derivative of Eq. 1.1 at the value of 3. It is written as:

f′(t) = d

dt f(t) = d

dt y = dy

dt = v = − 96.522........................................ (1.9)

and is defined as:

dy
dt = lim
Δt → 0

f(t + Δt) − f(t)

Δt

. .................................................. (1.10)

As the limit of the value of Δt approaches zero, the solution converges to the first derivative.

Derivatives have the following properties (r = constant).

If y = f(t) = r,

then dy

dt = f′(t) = 0. .......................................... (1.11)

If y = f(t) = rtn,

then dy

dt = f′(t) = rntn − 1. .................................... (1.12)

If y = f(t) = sin (rt),

then dy

dt = f′(t) = r cos (rt). .............................. (1.13)

If y = f(t) = cos (rt),

then dy

dt = f′(t) = − r sin (rt). ............................ (1.14)

If y = f(t) = ert,

then dy

dt = f′(t) = rert. ....................................... (1.15)
dt = f′(t) = 1

t . ..................................... (1.16)

then dy

If y = f(t) = ln (rt),

In the case of Eq. 1.7, where Q = 0, L’Hopital’s rule can help find the limit. This is shown

in Eq. 1.17:

lim
t → z+

f(t)
g(t) = lim
t → z+
or where f(t) = g(t) = ± ∞. ................................................. (1.17)

, where f(t) = g(t) = 0

f′(t)
g′(t)

Other rules regarding differentials are the following.

then f′(t) = ∑

and continued differentiations can be shown by

dt3 f(t) = f‴(t). .......................................... (1.23)
A useful point to recognize is where a slope equals zero, which can correspond to a maxi-
mum,  a  minimum,  or  an  inflection.  To  determine  these  points,  determine  a  first  derivative  of
an  equation.  Then,  set  this  first-derivative  equation  to  equal  zero  and  solve  for  the  basis  (the
unknown). To determine whether this point is a maximum, a minimum, or an inflection, deter-
mine the second derivative of that equation. If that value is negative, the point is a maximum;
if it is positive, the point is a minimum; and if it is zero, the point is an inflection.

The graph of Eq. 1.24 (Fig. 1.2) is an example of this process:

The first derivative of Eq. 1.24 is:

y = t3 − 5t2 + 3t + 5. ........................................................ (1.24)

dy
dt = 3t2 − 10t + 3, ......................................................... (1.25)

Chapter 1—Mathematics of Vibrating Systems

which,  when  set  equal  to  zero,  is  a  quadratic  equation  with  two  roots,  t = 3 and 1 / 3.  These
two points correspond to the maximum and minimum points on the graph. To prove which is
which, a second derivative is taken:

d2y
dt2 = 6t − 10, ............................................................ (1.26)
which at t = 3 and 1 / 3 is equal to 8 and –8, respectively. This means that at t = 3, the func-
tion is at a minimum and at t = 1/3, the function is at a maximum.

The  first  differentiation  of  the  equation  of  the  position  of  a  free-falling  object  starting  at

rest (Eq. 1.1) gives the slope of the graph, which, as noted, is the velocity:

dy
dt = v = gct. ............................................................. (1.27)

A second differentiation gives the change of the slope with respect to time (acceleration), and
is:

d2y
dt2 = gc, ................................................................ (1.28)

which is the acceleration caused by Earth’s gravity.

1.1.3 Differential-Equation  Solutions.    Solutions  to  differential  equations  solved  in  closed
form can range from trivial to impossible. Numerical methods often are required. Nevertheless,
some general strategies have been developed to solve differential equations.1,2,3

An  ODE  with  only  first  derivatives  is  known  as  a  first-order  ODE.  A  second-order  ODE
has  second  and  possibly  first  derivatives.  The  same  reasoning  applies  to  third  order  and  be-
yond. Likewise, when a PDE has only first derivatives, it is a first-order PDE. The second and
third orders and beyond are defined on the basis of their highest-order derivative.

This section has covered some of the basics of ODE and PDE mathematics. The reader is

urged to review mathematical texts and handbooks for more details on this subject.

To illustrate some of the aforementioned principles of ODE and PDE mathematics, the rest
of this chapter discusses examples within the subject of vibrations. Vibration mathematics has

been chosen because vibrations are notorious for instigating drilling and production problems.
The  next  section  covers  some  basic  information  on  the  nature  of  vibrations,  with  subsequent
sections devoted to some aspect of the mathematical models of vibrations.

1.2 Introductory Thoughts About Vibrations
The fundamental theories of vibration are not new. Indeed, Saint-Venant4 published his theory
on the vibrations of rods in 1867, and Love5 published an entire treatise on vibration theory in
1926. The mathematics of vibration theory involves infinite series, complex functions, and Fouri-
er integral transforms, and its physics involves Newtonian mechanics and stress analyses. Until
recently,  except  under  relatively  simple  conditions,  the  complexity  of  such  mathematics  had
restrained the application of vibration theory to solving simple common problems. Now, howev-
er,  state-of-the-art  computers  can  perform  these  complex  calculations  in  a  reasonable  time
frame, making possible a wave of new studies.

1.3 Vibration Theory
A  vibration  is  a  fluctuating  motion  about  an  equilibrium  state.  There  are  two  types  of  vibra-
tion:  deterministic  and  random.  A  deterministic  vibration  is  one  that  can  be  characterized
precisely, whereas a random vibration only can be analyzed statistically. The vibration generat-
ed  by  a  pumping  unit  is  an  example  of  a  deterministic  vibration,  and  an  intermittent  sticking
problem within the same system is a random vibration.

In mechanical systems, deterministic vibrations are excitations that elicit a response from a
system,  as  shown  schematically  in  Fig.  1.3.  In  theory,  as  long  as  two  of  the  three  variables
(excitation,  system,  and  response)  are  known,  the  third  one  can  be  determined;  however,  the
mathematics might be challenging. Most often, the response function is sought, so that the exci-
tation function and the system must be known.

Vibration  systems  can  be  linear  or  nonlinear,  and  discrete  or  continuous  (Fig.  1.4).  In  all
cases, a vibration system can be in one, two, or three mutually orthogonal dimensions. A linear
system  is  a  system  in  which  proportionality  (Eq.  1.29)  and  superposition  (Eq.  1.30)  are  true,
that is, in which:

If E(t) → R(t),

then rE(t) → rR(t)........................................... (1.29)

and

If E1(t) → R1(t) and E2(t) → R2(t),

then E1(t) + E2(t) → R1(t) + R2(t). ............................................ (1.30)

When proportionality and superposition are not true, then the system is nonlinear.

A  discrete  system  is  one  having  a  finite  number  of  independent  coordinates  that  can  de-
scribe  a  system  response.  These  independent  coordinates  are  known  as  degrees  of  freedom
(DOFs).  If  the  motion  of  mass,  either  translational  or  rotational,  of  a  vibrating  system  is  a
function  of  only  one  independent  coordinate,  then  the  system  has  one  DOF.  If  two  or  more
independent coordinates are required to describe one or both types of motion, then the system
has two or more DOFs. If a system is continuous (an infinite set of independent coordinates is

needed to describe the system response), it has an infinite number of DOFs. Because material
structures  all  have  a  continuous  nature,  all  systems  have  an  infinite  number  of  DOFs.  Most
systems have dominant DOFs; some even have a single dominant DOF. Such systems therefore
can be characterized as discrete systems, which makes the mathematics more tractable.

If a system has a single DOF or set of DOFs in only one direction, it is a 1D system. If
there are two mutually orthogonal directions for the DOF, it is a 2D system; and if there are
three mutually orthogonal directions for the DOF, it is a 3D system.

As  Fig.  1.5  shows,  the  excitation  function  can  be  periodic  or  transient,  and  absent  or
present.  A  periodic  vibration  is  one  that  can  be  characterized  mathematically  as  an  indefinite
repetition. A transient vibration is of finite length and is composed of waves that have a defi-
nite beginning and that eventually die out. These waves can be of extremely short duration or
last for some time.

A standing wave is a vibration whose wave profile appears to be standing still, though actu-
ally  the  particles  that  make  up  the  material  are  oscillating  about  an  equilibrium  position.
Because of the geometry and boundary conditions of the material through which they are trav-
eling,  the  waves  and  the  reflected  waves  cancel  and  reinforce  themselves  over  the  same
location in the material, which makes the wave profile appear not to be moving. The point at
which  no  motion  is  occurring  is  a  nodal  point,  or  node.  The  point  of  maximum  amplitude  is
the antinode.

In  reality,  all  waves  are  transient  in  some  way.  If  a  wave  is  repeated  over  a  longer  time
than it takes for a single wave to propagate through a material, then this series of waves can
be called a vibration. All vibrations are transient, as well. If the vibration lasts longer than the
time under analysis, then it can be characterized as infinite in length.

I-8

Fig. 1.6—Types of elastic waves.

When the excitation is present and is actively affecting the system within the analysis time
frame, the response is called a forced vibration. The response of a system with an absent exci-
tation  function—one  that  is  not  present  within  the  analysis  time  frame—is  called  a  free
vibration. As such, the system can be responding to the removal of an excitation function. For
example,  if  the  response  of  a  mass  and  spring  system  is  sought  after  the  system  has  been
pulled down and released, the original excitation function (the pulling force) is considered ab-
sent because the analysis is being performed after the release.

1.4 Wave Propagation
The  method  by  which  a  vibration  travels  through  a  system  is  known  as  wave  propagation.
When  an  external  force  is  impressed  on  a  real-world  elastic  body,  the  body  does  not  react
instantly over its entire length. The point immediately under the external force reacts first, and
then the section just under that point reacts to the previous section’s reaction, and so on. This
series of reactions is called wave propagation because the reactions propagate through the body
over a period of time at a specific velocity. If the rate of change of the external force is slow
enough,  static  equilibrium  analysis  can  model  the  reactions  adequately  for  most  engineering
applications. This is called rigid-body analysis. If the external force changes rapidly, however,
wave-propagation analysis is necessary to model the reactions effectively.

1.4.1 Types of Waves.  There are many types of elastic waves. Some listed in this section are
longitudinal, lateral, and bending waves.6 Some of these are shown in Fig. 1.6.

In longitudinal waves (also variously called compression/tension, axial, dilatational, and ir-
rotational waves), the particles that make up the elastic medium are forced directly toward and
away from each other, and the direction of the particles’ motion is parallel to that of the wave
motion. In most steels, longitudinal waves travel at ≈16,800 ft/sec. Longitudinal waves are not
dispersive. This means that all the wave components that make up a longitudinal wave travel at
the same velocity and, hence, do not separate (disperse).

In  lateral  waves  (also  known  variously  as  shear,  torsional,  transverse,  equivoluminal,  and
distortional  waves),  the  particles  slip  beside  each  other,  and  move  perpendicular  to  the  direc-
tion of the wave motion. Because slipping uses more energy, lateral waves are slower. In steel,
for  example,  they  travel  at  10,400  ft/sec.  A  rapidly  changing  torsional  force  on  a  section  of

Chapter 1—Mathematics of Vibrating Systems

I-9

pipe will cause a lateral wave to propagate from the point of application to all other parts of
the pipe. It propagates as an angular twist. Lateral waves are nondispersive and have a similar
solution  method  as  the  longitudinal  waves;  however,  shear  or  transverse  waves  are  dispersive
(i.e.,  the  wave  components  that  make  up  a  shear  wave  travel  at  different  velocities).  Their
wave components will disperse and “smear” the initial wave profile. This complicates the anal-
ysis significantly.

Bending  waves  (flexural  waves)  travel  as  a  bend  in  a  bar  or  plate  and  have  longitudinal
and lateral components. Rotary shears and moments of inertia complicate bending-wave analysis.
Wave-propagation  studies  in  petroleum  engineering  areas  generally  have  been  confined  to
longitudinal, torsional, and lateral waves. Of these, longitudinal waves generally are easiest to
model  and  are  considered  in  this  section.  A  compression  wave  is  a  stress  wave  in  which  the
propagated  stress  is  in  compression.  Likewise,  a  tension  wave  is  a  stress  wave  in  which  the
propagated stress is in tension.

1.5 Wave Behavior
Wave velocity depends  primarily on  density  and  modulus  of  elasticity but  also  is  affected by
damping and frequency. For example, hitting one end of a long steel rod with a hammer will
generate a longitudinal wave that compresses the particles of the steel. The wave’s length is set
by the length of time that the hammer is in contact with the end of the rod, whereas its magni-
tude  is  set  by  the  force  of  the  hammer  blow.  As  the  wave  moves  along  the  rod,  the  steel
within  the  length  of  the  wave  is  compressed.  After  the  wave  passes,  the  steel  returns  to  its
unstressed state, though not necessarily in the same location as before the wave passage.

As  another  example,  twisting  (shearing)  a  steel  rod  will  generate  a  shear  wave.  A  shear
wave moves along the rod more slowly than the longitudinal wave does. Similarly to the longi-
tudinal wave discussed above, its length is set by the duration of the twisting action, whereas
its magnitude is set by the torque from the twisting action.

Waves  act  independently,  but  the  stresses  they  create  can  be  additive.  For  example,  two
equal compression waves that are generated simultaneously by hammer blows at each end of a
long steel rod will meet in the center of the rod, pass through one another, and then each con-
tinue along the rod as if the other never existed (independence). While the waves are passing
each other, however, the compression in the steel will be twice (additive) that of either wave.

1.5.1 Natural Frequencies and Resonance.  Everything  has  a  natural  frequency,  a  frequency
at which it would vibrate were it given the energy to vibrate and left alone. For instance, the
human body has a natural frequency of ≈5 cycles/sec. All drill and rod strings have a natural
frequency that depends on the material properties and geometry. The material properties deter-
mine the wave velocity, and the geometry determines how waves are reflected and refracted.

During wave propagation, the wave eventually reaches an end of the material. Some of the
wave will reflect back to its source. If the reflection reaches the source at the same time a new
wave is generated, the two waves will combine and be synchronized in phase. Later, if those
two waves’ reflections return to the source at the same time the next new wave is generated,
all  three  waves  will  combine.  This  will  continue  for  as  long  as  waves  are  generated  under
these  conditions,  and  the  resultant  wave  will  increase  in  amplitude,  theoretically  to  infinity.
This is called resonance. The frequency at which resonance occurs is the natural frequency or
an integer multiple of that frequency (called a harmonic). If this wave reinforcement is allowed
to continue, the system eventually will either self-destruct or fatigue to failure.

A continuous system contains an infinite number of natural frequencies, whereas a discrete
single-degree-of-freedom  (SDOF)  system  (e.g.,  a  point  mass  on  a  massless  spring)  has  only
one natural frequency. If two point masses are connected using two springs, then there are two
natural  frequencies  in  this  2DOF  system.  In  general,  the  number  of  DOFs  in  a  system  deter-
mines the number of natural frequencies it has, which means that any discrete system will have

I-10

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

a finite number of natural frequencies; however, in reality, there is an infinite number of natu-
ral  frequencies  because  all  systems  are  continuous.  Some  frequencies  will  have  higher  ampli-
tudes  than  others.  Such  continuous  systems  with  discrete  higher-amplitude  responses  can  be
modeled with a discrete methodology.

1.5.2 Damping.  Resonance  energy  does  not  reach  an  infinite  value  because  of  damping,  the
dissipation  of  energy  over  time  or  distance.7  Without  damping,  or  friction,  the  energy  from
vibrations  would  build  until  there  is  more  energy  than  the  structure  can  sustain,  which  can
cause structural failure.

A wave propagating into a system adds energy to a system, whereas damping removes it.
Generally, the dissipated energy from the vibration is converted to heat, and if damping does
not  take  enough  energy  out  of  a  system,  the  system  can  self-destruct  from  energy  overload.
The  amount  of  energy  in  a  system  at  a  given  time  is  reflected  in  the  system’s  stress/strain
level.  The  more  stresses/strains  in  the  system,  the  higher  the  energy  level.  Once  the  stresses
reach  a  value  greater  than  the  yield  strength  of  the  system,  yield  failure  is  imminent.  If  the
stresses are greater than the ultimate strength of the material, failure is immediate.

In the borehole, three distinctive types of damping occur: viscous, Coulomb, and hysteretic.
Viscous  damping  occurs  when  the  damping  force  generated  is  proportional  to  the  velocity  of
the particles. Coulomb damping (also called dry friction) is the force generated by the move-
ment  of  materials  past  one  another,  and  it  usually  is  proportional  to  the  force  normal  to  the
materials’ surfaces. The dynamic and static coefficients of friction are the proportionality con-
stants. Hysteretic damping is the friction force generated by the relative motion of the internal
planes  of  a  material  as  a  wave  causes  particle  motion.  Although  this  is  true  of  all  materials,
some materials are viscoelastic (i.e., they show a much larger hysteretic effect than do others).
Viscous  Damping.    As  noted  above,  viscous  damping  occurs  when  the  damping  force  is

proportional to the velocity of the particles. Viscous damping is shown by:

Fd = c dx

dt . ................................................................ (1.31)

One way that viscous damping arises in jarring analysis is from the interaction of a solid and
liquid  at  their  interface,  such  as  where  the  steel  contacts  the  liquid  mud  along  the  sides  of  a
drillstring.

One  method  for  determining  the  damping  involves  noting  the  decrement  of  acceleration
over one vibration cycle.8 An impulse is impressed on the drillstring to produce a wave. While
the wave is decaying, the acceleration is measured and recorded multiple times at one location
on the string and at the same phase (i.e., crest to crest). The time between recordings also is
noted. These values are used in Eq. 1.32 to compute the damping coefficient (c). Unfortunate-
ly, though, this method gives the total damping and does not distinguish between viscous and
Coulomb damping.

. .......................................................... (1.32)

Coulomb Damping.  Coulomb  damping  is  the  friction  that  occurs  when  two  dry  surfaces
slide over each other, and its force is a constant value that is independent of particle velocity
and displacement, but dependent on the friction factor (μ) and the force normal to the friction
surface. This value is:

Ff = μFn. ................................................................. (1.33)

Chapter 1—Mathematics of Vibrating Systems

I-11

The Coulomb damping force always is of the opposite sign from that of the particle velocity,
so that the damping force reverses when the particle velocity changes signs. This discontinuity
makes it a nonlinear damping force, shown as:

Ff = ±( dx

dt )μFn. .......................................................... (1.34)

Nonlinearity makes a closed-form solution to an equation of motion difficult.

Hysteretic Damping.  Hysteretic damping also is called structural damping because it arises
from internal friction within a structure. A wave moves through a material because the atomic
structure  is  reacting  to  an  applied  force.  As  the  atoms  of  the  structure  move,  energy  is  lost
through the interaction of these atoms with their neighboring atoms. Hysteretic damping is the
energy lost when atoms move relative to each other.

If a material had a perfectly linear stress/strain relationship, hysteretic damping would not
occur.  In  reality,  though,  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  perfectly  linear  stress/strain  curve.  Two
curves develop on the stress/strain diagram while a material is stressed and relieved. The center
area  between  these  two  curves  represents  the  energy  lost  to  internal  friction.  (This  hysteresis
loop  is  the  reason  for  the  name  of  this  damping  type.)  This  variation  can  be  small,  but  the
amount of energy dissipated can be large because high-frequency vibrations can cause this loop
to be repeated many, many times over a given time period.9

The hysteretic-damping value is highly dependent on a number of factors. One factor is the
condition  of  the  material  (i.e.,  chemical  composition,  inhomogeneities,  and  property  changes
caused by thermal and stress histories). Another is the state of internal stress from initial and
subsequent thermal and stress histories. Also, the type and variation of stress—axial, torsional,
shear, and/or bending—affect the hysteretic-damping value.

A way of looking at hysteretic-damping force is to set it proportional to the particle veloci-

ty divided by the wave frequency. This is shown in Eq. 1.35.10

Fh = h
ω

dx
dt . ............................................................... (1.35)

1.6 Equivalent Springs
Many systems can be modeled as multiple springs. Such springs can be combined into a sin-
gle, equivalent spring (Fig. 1.7). For parallel springs, the sum of the spring constants is equal
to the equivalent spring constant (Eq. 1.36). For series springs, the reciprocal of the sum of the
reciprocals of the spring constants is equal to the equivalent spring constant (Eq. 1.37). A lin-
ear  spring  oscillates  in  a  single  translational  direction.  A  torsional  spring  oscillates  with  an
angular twist (Eq. 1.38).

1.7 Boundary and Initial Conditions
The boundary conditions (how the ends of a system are attached) and initial condition (condi-
tion of the system at the start in time) are extremely important in vibration and wave propaga-
tion  analysis.  The  specific  solution  of  any  ODE  or  PDE  requires  a  set  of  boundary  and/or
initial  conditions.  Usually,  a  displacement  (boundary  condition)  and  an  initial  velocity  (initial
condition) are specified.

In  wave  propagation,  the  boundary  conditions  also  dictate  wave  behavior.  For  example,  a
compression  wave  is  reflected  from  a  free  end  as  a  tension  wave  and  from  a  fixed  end  as  a
compression  wave.  If  two  rods  are  connected  at  their  ends  and  are  of  different  geometry  or
material, then a fraction of the energy of the wave is reflected and the remaining portion of the
energy is refracted at their connection. Other types of boundaries direct the system response by

limiting the DOF. This includes boundary conditions of pinned, revolute, translational, transla-
tional and rotational; forcing function; mass spring and/or damper, and a semi-infinite connec-
tion. In addition, changes in material properties will affect the various constants and will cause
wave-propagation  reflections  and  refractions  at  the  boundary  between  the  properties.  Fig.  1.8
shows some typical boundary conditions.

1.8 Mechanical Vibration Analysis
There are three components to mechanical vibration analysis: to determine the geometric com-
patibilities;  to  determine  the  constitutive  (material  properties)  equations;  and  to  determine  the
equilibrium condition.

The  geometric  compatibilities  are  the  displacement  constraints  and  connections.  They  also
include the continuous properties, which state that the system does not separate into individual

Chapter 1—Mathematics of Vibrating Systems

I-13

pieces. (If it does, that is another problem altogether.) The constitutive equations represent the
material  properties,  which  include  mass,  damping,  and  spring  coefficients.  These  constitutive
equations include stress/strain relationships and Hooke’s law (Eqs. 1.39a and 1.39b):

σ = Eε................................................................... (1.39a)

or, in another form,

F =

E Ac
L Δl. ............................................................. (1.39b)

The coefficient of Δl  in Eq. 1.39b often is called the spring constant or stiffness constant.

The equilibrium condition is based on both static and dynamic conditions. A static equilibri-

um states that the sum of the forces acting on an object is equal to zero:

∑F = 0. .................................................................. (1.40)

A dynamic equilibrium is based on Newton’s second law and is the basis of many vibra-
tion analysis methods. The sum of the forces acting on an object is equal to its mass times the
acceleration  of  the  object.  Other  dynamic-equilibrium  analysis  includes  virtual  work  methods
and energy-balance methods (Hamilton’s principle).

Newton’s second law for a translational system is

∑F = mx¨................................................................. (1.41)

and for torsional systems is

∑T = Iθ¨. ................................................................. (1.42)

Newton’s second law can be rewritten in a form known as D’Alembert’s principle:

∑F − mx¨ = 0, ............................................................. (1.43)

in which mx¨  is treated as a force and is called an inertial force.

Some basic equations of vibration analysis are shown in Table 1.1.

1.9 SDOF System
An SDOF system is the most basic vibration analysis. The typical SDOF system is the classi-
cal linear oscillator (CLO), as shown in Fig. 1.9. It consists of a point mass, spring, and damper.

1.9.1 Free Vibration Without Damping.  The first analysis is free vibration without damping.
Using Newton’s second law and D’Alembert’s principle, the equation that describes free vibra-
tion without damping (c = 0) is:

∑F = k x, ................................................................ (1.52)

which gives k x = mx¨, which when rearranged becomes:

mx¨ + k x = 0. .............................................................. (1.53)

Eq. 1.55 is substituted into Eq. 1.54, the result is:

2π  gives the natural frequency in cycles/unit time. When

x = C1 sin ωnt + C2 cos ωnt. .................................................. (1.56)

The constants C1 and C2 are based on the initial and boundary conditions. If at time 0, x = x0
and x˙ = v0, the initial location and velocity, respectively, the first coefficient is:

C2 = x0, .................................................................. (1.57)

which is the initial location. Differentiating once gives:

x˙ = C1ωn cos ωnt − C2ωn sin ωnt, ............................................. (1.58)

which, when t = 0, gives the other coefficient:

C1 =

Ex. 1.1 is an SDOF free and undamped CLO system.

1.9.2 Free Vibration With Damping.  The second analysis of free vibration is with damping
(Fig. 1.10). Using Newton’s second law, the equation that describes free vibration with damp-
ing (c ≠ 0) is:

∑F = k x + cx˙, ............................................................ (1.61)

which is rearranged as before to get:

mx¨ + cx˙ + k x = 0. .......................................................... (1.62)

The general solution to this differential equation is:

−c +( c2 − 4mk)t

2m

−c −( c2 − 4mk)t

x = C1e

, .................................. (1.63)

although the specific solution depends on the value under the square root. When c2 − 4mk = 0,
the system is critically damped. Another way to look at this critical damping point is:

ccrit = 4mk = 2mωn. ....................................................... (1.64)

I-16

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Example 1.1—SDOF free and undamped CLO system.

Often, the damping coefficient is divided by the critical damping coefficient to get the critical
damping ratio:

c

2mωn

= c
ccrit

= ξ. .......................................................... (1.65)

If ξ > 1, the system is underdamped. When disturbed, the system will experience an oscil-
lating  decay.  If  ξ  <  1,  the  system  is  overdamped  and,  when  disturbed,  will  die  out  without
oscillating. If ξ = 1, the system is critically damped and also will not oscillate.
A useful simplifying equation is the “damped” natural frequency, ωd. It is:

ωd = ωn 1 − ξ2. ........................................................... (1.66)

If the system is underdamped, that is, if 0 ≤ ξ < 1, the solution is:

x = e

but  in  this  case,  ωd = ωn ξ2 − 1.  The  order  changed  because  it  was  an  imaginary  number.
With the same initial and boundary conditions as before, the solution is as before:

ary conditions is:

Ex. 1.4 is an SDOF free and critically damped CLO system.

1.9.3 Forced Vibration Without Damping.  The next sets of systems have a forcing function
driving the vibration. The first of these is a CLO without damping (c = 0), as shown in Fig.
1.11. The equation of motion for this system with F = F0 sin ωf t, a sinusoidally varying force,
using Newton’s second law, is:

mx¨ + k x = F0 sin ωf t. ....................................................... (1.74)

In  this  case,  there  are  two  terms  in  the  solution,  the  homogenous  or  transient  term,  and  the
particular  or  steady-state  term.  The  homogenous  term  is  the  same  as  in  a  free-vibration  case
and is solved by setting the forcing function to zero (that is, the free-vibration case, Eq. 1.60).
If the same initial and boundary conditions are applied as before, the solution for the homoge-
nous case is the same as before:

xh = x0 cos ωnt +

The second term is the effect of the forcing function on the system. This is solved by assum-

x˙ p = C1ωf cos ωf t − C2ωf sin ωf t. ............................................ (1.77)

Ex. 1.5 is an SDOF forced and undamped CLO system. 

Note that when the forcing frequency, ωf, matches the natural frequency, ωn, the value of
the coefficient is infinity. This is the resonance condition, and it can lead to excessively large
displacements (see Fig. 1.12).

When  the  forcing  frequency  is  close  to  but  not  at  the  natural  frequency,  a  beating  phe-
nomenon occurs. This appears as a low frequency impressed over the frequency of the system.
When  the  engines  of  a  twin-engine  aircraft  are  not  quite  synchronized,  for  example,  one  can
hear  a  beating  sound  as  a  low-frequency  pulse  (the  “wow-wow”  throb).  Fig.  1.13  illustrates
this beating phenomenon.

1.9.4 Forced Vibration With Damping.  The  second  system  with  a  forcing  function  driving
the vibration is a CLO with damping (c ≠ 0), as shown in Fig. 1.14. The equation of motion
for this system with the same force as before, F = F0 sin ωt, is:

mx¨ + cx˙ + k x = F0 sin ωf t. ................................................... (1.86)

The solution has two parts, as before. It is similar to the last example, except for an addi-
tional  damping  term.  The  particular  solution  is  solved  similarly  to  the  last  example  in  Eqs.
1.76, 1.77, and 1.78. Differentiating and substituting into Eq. 1.86 gives:

m(−ωf 2C1 sin ωf t − ωf 2C2 cos ωf t) + c(C1ωf cos ωf t − C ω2 f

The total solution is homogenous and the particular solutions added together. In this case,
if the same initial and boundary conditions are applied as before, the homogenous solution is
the same as in the free-vibration case and is Eq. 1.69. The particular solution is Eq. 1.93 and is
the effect of the forcing function on the system. As noted before, the critical damping coeffi-
cient dictates the behavior of the homogenous part of the solution.

Ex. 1.6 is an SDOF forced and underdamped CLO system.

1.10 Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2DOF) Systems
At the basic level, systems with two and more DOFs are similar to SDOF systems. In a 2DOF
system,  two  independent  equations  of  motion  are  required  to  define  a  system  (e.g.,  a  double
CLO or a double pendulum), but the DOFs need not be the same. For example, a system could
have a translational and a rotational DOF. As long as the equations of motion are independent
of one other, it is a 2DOF system. These equations must be solved simultaneously.

1.10.1 Free Undamped 2DOF System.  As in the SDOF system, an undamped (c1 and c2 = 0)
system  will  be  developed  first.  Fig.  1.15  shows  such  a  system.  As  before,  Newton’s  second
law can determine the equations of motion. In the SDOF system, a solution in the form of sine
and cosine was used. For the first 2DOF system, another valid form of a solution, a sine with
a phase angle, Φ, is used to show another solution form. The equation for mass 1 is

m1x¨ 1 = − k1x1 + k2(x2 − x1)................................................... (1.94)

and for mass 2 is

m2x¨ 2 = − k2(x2 − x1). ....................................................... (1.95)
These  two  equations  of  motion  must  be  solved  simultaneously  because  they  are  coupled
through  the  displacement  terms,  x1  and  x2.  As  before,  a  solution  is  assumed  and  substituted
back into the equations of motion. The assumed solution is

x1 = C1 sin (ωt + Φ)......................................................... (1.96)

and

x2 = C2 sin (ωt + Φ), ....................................................... (1.97)

for which the second differentiation is

Chapter 1—Mathematics of Vibrating Systems

I-27

x¨ 1 = − ω2C1 sin (ωt + Φ).................................................... (1.98)

and

x¨ 2 = − ω2C2 sin (ωt + Φ). ................................................... (1.99)

Substituting back into the equations of motion and collecting terms, the result is:

(k1 + k2 − ω2m1)C1 − k2C2 = 0................................................ (1.100)

and

−k2C1 + (k2 − ω2m2)C2 = 0. .................................................. (1.101)
The only way not to have a trivial solution (C1 and C2 = 0) to these equations is to have the
determinate of the coefficients be zero:

|( k1 + k2 − ω2m1

−k2

−k2

k2 − ω2m2)| = 0. ......................................... (1.102)

Using linear algebra, the determinate is:

m1m2ω4 − m1k2 + m2(k1 + k2) ω2 + k1k2 = 0, .................................... (1.103)

which is a quadratic equation in terms of the square of the natural frequencies, ω2. This solves
to:

ω2 =

m1k2 + m2(k1 + k2) ± m1k2 + m2(k1 + k2) 2 − 4m1m2k1k2

2m1m2

. .................... (1.104)

There  are  two  roots  to  this  equation,  which  means  that  there  are  two  natural  frequencies.
The  solution  therefore  must  be  in  terms  of  the  two  frequencies.  Substituting  the  first  natural
frequency back into the equation of motion solution gives the result of the first natural frequency:
2m1)C11 − k2C21 = 0............................................... (1.105)

(k1 + k2 − ω1

and

−k2C11 + (k2 − ω1

2m2)C21 = 0. ................................................ (1.106)

The ratio of C11 to C21, known as the mode shape, for the first natural frequency is:

and

x2 = C21 sin (ω1t + Φ1). .................................................... (1.110)

The mode shape for the second natural frequency is:

and

x2 = C22 sin (ω2t + Φ2). .................................................... (1.114)

The complete solution then is both displacements added into one equation:

x1 = C11 sin (ω1t + Φ1) + C12 sin (ω2t + Φ2)

λ1C21 sin (ω1t + Φ1) + λ2C22 sin (ω2t + Φ2)..................................... (1.115)

and

x2 = C21 sin (ω1t + Φ1) + C22 sin (ω2t + Φ2). ................................... (1.116)
The values of C11, C12, C21, C22, Φ1, and Φ2 depend on the initial conditions and the mode

shapes, λ1 and λ2.

Ex. 1.7 is a 2DOF free and undamped CLO system.

1.10.2 Free Damped 2DOF System.  Adding damping complicates the equations considerably,
but  the  procedure  remains  the  same.  In  this  case,  it  is  easier  to  use  linear  algebra.  Using  the
same model as before (see Fig. 1.16), but adding viscous dampers (c1 and c2 ≠ 0), the equa-
tions of motion for the independent DOFs are determined for mass 1 as

is true is if the determinate of the coefficient of Ceωtis zero; that is, if

The determinate of Eq. 1.141 is a fourth-order polynomial in terms of a, which means that

there are four roots. These roots can be:

Example 1.8—2DOF free and damped CLO system (continued).

If number one is the case, then the result is an exponentially decaying motion without oscil-
lation.  It  is  similar  to  the  overdamped  case  for  an  SDOF  system.  If  number  two  is  the  case,

I-34

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

then the motions will be exponentially decaying oscillations for both DOFs. This is similar to
the  underdamped  case  for  an  SDOF  system.  Finally,  for  case  number  three,  either  condition
can occur.

Ex. 1.8 is a 2DOF free and underdamped CLO system.
More information on linear algebra can be found in Chap. 2 of this section of the Handbook.

1.10.3 Forced Damped 2DOF System.  Adding forcing complicates the equations considerably
yet again. The procedure is the same, however, and it is a matter of keeping the mathematics
straight. Many texts are available to delve more deeply into this subject. For more information,
please refer to Refs. 11 through 19.

1.10.4 Multiple-DOF Systems.  The previous discussion of 2DOF systems points out how to
handle  any  DOF  system.  The  last  example  used  matrix  notation  to  define  the  system  for  the
solution process. Multiple-DOF systems are solved similarly with the primary difference being
the degree of the defining matrices is greater, as is the degree of difficulty in solving the sys-
tem.  The  matrix  will  have  the  same  number  of  rows  and  columns  as  the  degree  of  freedom.
There are other methods (e.g., finite-element modeling) that can be used to tackle the complex-
ity of multiple-DOF systems.

1.11 Continuous Systems
If one continues to add DOFs, the limit at an infinite DOF defines a continuous system. The
result  becomes  a  PDE.  The  following  is  a  brief  description  of  the  separation  of  variables
method for solving a PDE.

Fig. 1.17 shows a freebody diagram for axial and torsional systems. The axial system equa-
tions will be used to determine the solution of the equations of motion. Eq. 1.162 is the axial
equation of motion:

m∂2u
∂t2 = AcE ∂2u
∂t2  =  the  inertial  force,   AcE ∂2u

∂x2 − c∂u

where  m∂2u

∂t − mgc, ........................................... (1.162)

weight of the element, and c∂u
be solved using the separation of variables method. This is shown as:

∂x2  =  the  rate  of  strain  change,  mgc  =  the  static
∂t  = the force from viscous damping. This PDE, Eq. 1.162, can

U (x, t) = X(x)T(t). ........................................................ (1.164)

The following solution assumption is made concerning the time function:

T(t) = eiωt. ............................................................... (1.165)

This equation is substituted back into the assumed solution, which then is appropriately differ-
entiated and substituted back into the equation of motion. The equation becomes

AcE∂2X(x)

∂x2 eiωt + (mω2 − ciω)X(x)eiωt = 0, .................................. (1.166)

which is of the form

Chapter 1—Mathematics of Vibrating Systems

I-35

Fig. 1.17—Freebody diagrams for axial and torsional motion.

y″ + φ2y = 0. ............................................................ (1.167)

The standard solution of this equation is:

X(x) = C1e−iφx + C2eiφx. ................................................... (1.168)

The constants of integration, C1and C2, are determined by the initial and boundary conditions,
and φ is a collection of the constants and is given by:

φ = mω2 − ciω

. ......................................................... (1.169)

Therefore, the total solution is:

U (x, t) = (C1e−iφx + C2eiφx)eiωt. ............................................. (1.170)
The solution to the torsional equation of motion is derived similarly to the axial equation,
with the substitution of the appropriate variables and noting that there is no initial strain from
gravity. The variables u, m,  Ac, E, c, ω, vs, and φ are replaced by θ, I,  J, G, cθ, ωθ, vθ, and
η, respectively. The torsional equation of motion is:

1.12 Wave Reflection From Various Geometric Boundaries
As  discussed  early  in  the  chapter,  wave  propagation  is  the  movement  of  a  distinct  group  of
waves through some material in response to an external force.

A key point in wave-propagation studies is how waves interact with geometric discontinu-
ities. What happens as a wave meets a fixed or free boundary condition? Also, what happens
to a wave as it encounters a geometrical area change or a change in material properties?

There  are  two  limiting  boundary  conditions  for  wave  propagation:  a  fixed  (pinned)  end
(zero displacement) and a free end (zero stress). A fixed end is a boundary condition in which
there  is  zero  displacement.  According  to  wave  theory,  during  a  wave  encounter  with  a  fixed
end, the stress at the fixed end doubles during the passage of the wave. A reflection of a stress
wave will simply bounce back with the same sign. A compression wave will reflect as a com-
pression wave and a tension wave will reflect as a tension wave. At a fixed end, because the
displacement is zero, the particle velocity will be zero. The wave particle velocity amplitude is
inverted during a reflection from a fixed end.

A free end is defined as a boundary condition free to move. The stress at the free end is
always  zero.  The  effects  on  stress  and  particle  velocity  caused  by  a  free  end  are  opposite  of
the effects on stress on a fixed end. A compression wave encountering a free end reflects as a
tension wave, and a tension wave reflects as a compression wave. The wave particle velocity
values double during an encounter with a free end and reflect with the same sign.

As a wave encounters a change in cross-sectional area, some of the wave is reflected and
some  is  transmitted  (refracted).  The  amplitudes  and  sign  of  the  waves  depend  on  the  relative
change in cross-sectional area. The equation that describes the effect on the incident force, Fi,
of a cross-sectional-area, density, or modulus-of-elasticity change for the transmitted wave is

Ft =

If an incident wave encounters a junction where the relative change in cross-sectional area
is greater than 1 (a smaller area to a larger area), most of the wave will transmit through the
junction.  Some  of  the  wave  will  reflect  from  the  junction  and  will  keep  the  same  sign.  For
example, a compression wave will transmit through the junction and keep going as a somewhat-
diminished  compression  wave.  The  part  of  the  wave  that  is  reflected  is  still  a  compression
wave, but its amplitude is less than that of the wave that transmitted though the junction.

On the other hand, if an incident wave encounters a junction where the relative change in
cross-sectional area is less than 1 (a larger area to a smaller area), most of the wave will re-
flect off the junction, but some of it will transmit through the junction and will keep the same
sign. For example, a compression wave will transmit through the junction and keep going as a
diminished compression wave. The reflected part of the wave is a tension wave whose absolute
amplitude is greater than that of the compression wave that is transmitted through the junction.
As with most drillstrings, there are many geometric discontinuities (changes in cross-section-
al area) that will cause part of the wave to refract and part to reflect. For example, drill collars
to heavyweight drillpipe to drillpipe all are geometric discontinuities. Sometimes, too, there are
material discontinuities—changes in material density or modulus of elasticity—that cause refrac-
tions  and  reflections.  A  third  possible  type  of  discontinuity  is  when  there  are  different  end-
points.  For  example,  if  the  pipe  is  stuck,  one  end  can  be  modeled  as  stuck.  If  the  pipe  is
hanging freely, such as with casing running, then the end is free.

More-detailed information on wave propagation can be found in Refs. 20 through 25.

Appendix—Glossary of Vibration Theory Terms
The period of a vibration is the time taken for a motion to repeat.

Frequency is the number of repeats per unit of time. This also is called a cyclic frequency.
An angular frequency (sometimes called circular frequency) (ω) is measured in radians per unit
time. Angular frequency is the product of 2π and the cyclic frequency.7

The amplitude of a frequency is the difference between the maximum or minimum values
of a sinusoidally varying quantity and its mean. A wave’s crest is its maximum amplitude, and
the trough is its minimum amplitude.

The  wave  period  is  the  length  of  time  is  takes  a  wave  to  travel  from  crest  to  crest.  The

wave frequency is the inverse of the wave period.

The wavelength is the distance covered by one wave period.
The  phase  angle  (abbreviated  to  “phase”)  of  a  wave  is  the  fraction  of  the  distance  the
wave  has  traveled  relative  to  an  arbitrary  reference.  The  points  at  which  the  various  waves
cross the average amplitude line do not coincide unless the phase is zero. The phase is nega-
tive if the crossing occurs before the reference wave crossing, and positive if it occurs after the
reference wave crossing.

Phase  velocity  is  the  velocity  of  a  given  point,  as  defined  by  the  phase  angle  on  a  sinu-
soidal wave. When the phase velocity and the frequency remain constant, it is a nondispersing
wave. If the phase velocity and the frequency are not constant, the wave disperses.

The wave number is the ratio of the wavelength to 2π.10 If this ratio is a real number, the
wave will be a nondispersing wave (i.e., it will have a constant phase velocity for all its com-
ponents  and  will  retain  its  shape).  If  the  wave  number  is  complex,  then  the  wave  will  be  a
dispersing wave (i.e., its components will have different phase velocities and it will not retain
its shape and will disperse over time). All waves encountered in macroscopic reality are dispers-
ing to some extent.

The group speed is the response of a wave’s group of sinusoidal components, and is differ-
ent from phase velocity. Group speed is important; the interaction of all the wave components
in terms of wave number, amplitude, and frequency causes the appearance of a carrier wave of
some wave number, amplitude, and frequency. This carrier wave is modulated by group waves
that propagate at group speeds. In a nondispersing wave, the group speeds are the same as the

Chapter 1—Mathematics of Vibrating Systems

I-43

phase velocity of the wave components. In a dispersing wave, however, these group speeds can
be  different.  If  the  group  speeds  are  greater  than  the  phase  velocities,  it  will  appear  that  a
carrier wave originates at the back of the wave, propagates forward until it reaches the front of
the  wave,  vanishes,  and  reappears  at  the  back  of  the  wave.  If  the  group  speeds  are  less  than
the phase velocities, it will appear that a carrier wave originates at the front of the wave, prop-
agates backward until it reaches the back of the wave, vanishes, and reappears at the front of
the wave. This can be visualized by thinking of a caterpillar’s motion. The caterpillar’s ripples
appear to move backward, yet the caterpillar moves forward.24 This is one reason the analysis
of dispersing waves can be very complicated.

The  natural  frequency  of  a  system  is  the  frequency  at  which  the  system  vibrates  when

free of any friction or forcing functions.

A damped natural frequency is a natural frequency with friction.
Damping is the dissipation of energy with time or distance. Several forms of damping are

discussed in this chapter.

A harmonic is a frequency that is an integer multiple of a given frequency.
A mode is a particular harmonic frequency.
The mode shape is a pattern of the system assumed during a harmonic.
A frequency spectrum is a band of frequencies.
A forcing function is an external force that is acting on a vibrating system. This has the
effect of modifying the vibrations that are experienced in the system, sometimes significantly.
For example, in a rotating-drillstring system, the drill bit will impart a forcing vibration to the
lower end of the string.

A  critical  frequency  is  a  frequency  at  which  amplitudes  become  unbounded.  This  occurs

when the frequency of the system matches one of the natural frequencies.

The critical rotary speed is a rotary speed that coincides with one of the critical frequen-

Resonance occurs when the frequency of the forcing function is equal to one of the natural

cies of the system.

frequencies of the system.

A stable system returns to its former position after the removal of the force that disturbed
the system. In pipe work, stability is involved with buckling, bending, and straightness of the
pipe.

An incident wave is a wave going into a geometric or material discontinuity.
A transmitted wave is the portion of a wave that passes through a geometric or material

A reflected wave is the portion of a wave that does not pass through a geometric or mate-

discontinuity.

rial discontinuity.

Impedance  is  the  ratio  of  a  force-like  quantity  to  a  velocity-like  quantity  when  the  argu-
ments of the real or imaginary parts of the quantities linearly increase with time. The recipro-
cal  of  impedance  is  mobility.  If  the  mechanical  impedance  of  two  materials  and  their
geometries are equal, then the maximum amount of energy will be transmitted at their intersection.
The beating phenomenon occurs when two harmonic waves of slightly different frequen-
cies are impressed on a body. They are a periodic variation in vibration at a frequency that is
the difference between to two frequencies.

Self-excited  vibrations  occur  when  the  forcing  function  is  a  function  of  the  displacement,
velocity, or acceleration of the system mass. If the energy gained from the self-excited vibra-
tions is more than the system can absorb, the system will self-destruct.

A standing wave is a wave that appears to be standing still. There is no discernible begin-

ning or end in time to the wave.

A transient wave is a wave that has a definite beginning and eventually dies out.
Strain energy is the energy gained by a mass as it is deformed.

Mathematics of Fluid Flow

2.1 Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to review the mathematics of fluid flow. We limit our review to
essential aspects of partial differential equations, vector analysis, numerical methods, matrices,
and  linear  algebra.  These  topics  are  discussed  in  the  context  of  two  fluid  flow  applications:
analysis  of  the  convection/dispersion  equation  and  diagonalization  of  the  permeability  tensor.
For more details about the mathematics presented here, consult Refs. 1 through 4.

2.2 Partial Differential Equations
Partial  differential  equations  (PDEs)  are  frequently  encountered  in  petroleum  engineering.  We
review basic concepts of PDEs by considering the relevant mathematical properties of the con-
tinuity equation.

2.2.1 Continuity Equation.  Fluid flow through a volume can be described mathematically by
the continuity equation. The continuity equation has many uses, and its derivation is provided
to illustrate the construction of a partial differential equation from physical reasoning.5 We be-
gin by considering the flow illustrated in Fig. 2.1. The block in Fig. 2.1 has length (Δx), width
(Δy),  and  depth  (Δz).  Fluid  flux  (J)  is  the  rate  of  flow  of  mass  per  unit  cross-sectional  area
normal to the direction of flow. The notation (Jx)x denotes fluid flux in the x direction at loca-
tion x. The cross-sectional area perpendicular to the flux direction is ΔyΔz. Fluid flows into the
block at x with fluid flux Jx and out of the block at x + Δx with fluid flux Jx+Δx. Applying the
principle of conservation of mass, we have the mass balance, which is written as

Mass in − mass out = mass accumulation. ........................................ (2.1)

The mass entering the block in time interval, Δt, for flux across the face of the block at x is

(Jx)xΔy Δz Δt = mass in. .................................................... (2.2)

The mass leaving the block in time interval, Δt, across the face of the block at x + Δx is

I-46

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Fig. 2.1—Coordinate system for continuity equation.

(Jx)x + ΔxΔy Δz Δt + qΔx Δy Δz Δt = mass out, .................................. (2.3)
where we have added a source term q. Flow out of the block through q is represented by q >
0, and flow into the block is represented by q < 0. The source term, q, can represent a variety
of important physical systems, including wells, aquifer support, fluid flow into a fracture sys-
tem  from  matrix  blocks  in  a  naturally  fractured  reservoir,  and  gas  flow  into  a  cleat  system
from the coal in a coalbed.

Mass accumulation in the block is the change in concentration C of the mass in the block
during  the  time  interval  Δt,  where  concentration,  C,  is  defined  as  the  total  mass  in  the  block
divided by the block volume. The mass accumulation term is

(C)t + Δt − (C)t Δx Δy Δz = mass accumulation, .................................. (2.4)

where concentration is evaluated at times t and t + Δt.

Substituting Eqs. 2.2 through 2.4 into Eq. 2.1, dividing by ΔxΔyΔzΔt, and rearranging gives

(Jx)x + Δx − (Jx)x

(C)t + Δt − (C)t

. ....................................... (2.5)

In the limit as Δx → 0, Δt → 0, the differences in Eq. 2.5 are replaced by partial derivatives.
We assume the fluxes and concentrations are sufficiently smooth and continuous to allow the
replacement  of  differences  by  partial  derivatives.  Eq.  2.5  becomes  the  continuity  equation  in
one space dimension.

2.2.2 Partial Differential Equations.  PDEs are an extension of the concept of ordinary differ-
ential equations (ODEs). Unlike an ODE, which depends on only one independent variable, a
PDE depends on two or more independent variables. In the previous example, Eq. 2.6 depends
on two independent variables: one space dimension (x) and time (t). The order of Eq. 2.6 de-

pends on the form of concentration and flux. The order of a PDE is the order of the highest
derivative that appears in the equation.

∂ x , ∂ψ

for a function (ψ) of two or more independent variables {x,y,…}. A PDE is linear if it is first
order  in  the  unknown  function  and  its  partial  derivatives,  and  the  coefficients  of  the  partial
derivatives,  are  either  constant  or  depend  on  the  independent  variables  {x,y,…}.  We  illustrate
these concepts by considering the continuity equation for flow of a fluid with density (ρ), veloc-
ity (vx), and no source or sink terms. The concentration, C, and flux,  Jx, for this example are

c = ρ;
Jx = ρvx;

and

Substituting Eq. 2.8 into Eq. 2.6 gives

q = 0. ..................................................................... (2.8)

∂ x (ρ vx) = 0. ........................................................ (2.9)
Eq. 2.9 is a linear, first-order PDE if density is the unknown function and velocity is constant.
The situation is not so simple in more physically realistic systems.

∂ρ
∂t + ∂

Consider, for example, a slightly compressible fluid in which density is given by6

ρ = ρ0 exp c f (P − P0) , ..................................................... (2.10)
where P is pressure, c f  is fluid compressibility, and the subscript, 0, refers to a reference val-
ue of pressure. Assume, as well, that velocity is proportional to pressure gradient so that

vx = α∂ P

∂ x , ............................................................... (2.11)

where α is the proportionality constant. Substituting Eqs. 2.10 and 2.11 into Eq. 2.9 gives

∂ P
∂t + α
c f

∂2P

∂ x2 + α(∂ P
∂ x)2

= 0. .............................................. (2.12)

Eq. 2.12 is a nonlinear, second-order PDE. It is second order because of the second-order par-
tial  derivative  of  pressure  with  respect  to  x,  and  it  is  nonlinear  because  of  the  square  of  the
pressure gradient term.

Solutions  of  PDEs  depend  on  the  form  of  the  PDEs  and  their  associated  boundary  condi-

tions. An important class of second-order PDEs has the form

where the functions {A, B, C, G} are known functions of two independent variables {x, y} and
the first-order partial derivatives ∂ψ(x, y) /∂ x and∂ψ(x, y) /∂ y in a region (R) bounded by
a  surface  (S).  The  mathematical  properties  of  the  second-order  PDEs  depend  on  the  relation-
ship  between  the  functions  {A,  B,  C,  G}.  A  classification  scheme  for  second-order  PDEs  is
given in Table 2.1.

Boundary conditions for second-order PDEs may be written as

α(x, y)ψ(x, y) + β(x, y)∂ψ(x, y)

∂n

= γ(x, y), .................................... (2.14)

where ψ(x, y) is the unknown function of two independent variables {x, y}, and ∂ψ(x, y) /∂n
is the derivative normal to a boundary. The functions {α, β, γ} are known functions of {x, y}.
All of the functions and applicable derivatives are defined in a domain (R) bounded by a sur-
face (S). A classification scheme for the boundary conditions of a second-order PDE is given
in Table 2.2. The boundary conditions associated with the examples in Table 2.1 are given in
Table 2.3. The significance of PDE classification is considered further in the discussion of the
convection/dispersion equation presented next.

2.2.3 One-Dimensional  (1D)  Convection/Dispersion  Equation.    The  continuity  equation  is
used to describe the mixing of one substance with another by writing flux in the form

Jx = C v − D ∂C

∂ x . ......................................................... (2.15)

The concentration, C, is the concentration of the solute in the solvent. The term v is the veloci-
ty  of  the  solute,  and  D  is  the  dispersion  of  the  solute  into  the  solvent.  Substituting  Eq.  2.15
into Eq. 2.6, the 1D convection/dispersion equation without sources or sinks, gives

D ∂2C
∂ x2 − v∂C

∂ x = ∂C

∂t . .................................................... (2.17)

Eq. 2.17 is the 1D convection/dispersion (C/D) equation. The dispersion term is D∂2C/∂x2, and
the convection term is –v∂C/∂x. If the dispersion term is much larger than the convection term,
the solution of Eq. 2.17 can be approximated by the solution of the equation

D ∂2C
∂ x2 = ∂C

∂t . ............................................................ (2.18)

Eq. 2.18 is a parabolic PDE and behaves mathematically like a heat conduction equation. If the
convection term is much larger than the dispersion term, the solution of Eq. 2.17 can be approx-
imated by the solution of the equation.

Eq. 2.19 is a first-order hyperbolic PDE.

Fig. 2.2—Analytical solution of the 1D C/D equation.

A solution of the 1D C/D equation, given in Eq. 2.17, is obtained as follows. We assume
that solute is moving in the x-direction with constant speed (vx). The concentration C(x,t) is a
function of space and time. We must specify two boundary conditions and an initial condition
for  the  concentration  C(x,t)  to  solve  the  C/D  equation.  We  impose  the  boundary  conditions,
C(0, t) = 1 and C(∞, t) = 0, for all time, t > 0, and the initial condition, C(x, 0) = 0, for all
values of x > 0. The boundary condition, C(0, t) = 1, says that we are injecting 100% solute at
x = 0, and the boundary condition, C(∞, t) = 0, says that the solute never reaches the end of
the flow path at x = ∞. The initial condition, C (x, 0) = 0, says that there is no solute in the
solvent at the initial time, t = 0. The solution of the C/D equation is

C(x, t) = 1

the C/D equation.

2.3 Vector Analysis
Fluid flow equations in two and three dimensions can be compactly represented using concepts
from  vector  analysis.  For  example,  the  continuity  equation  in  three  space  dimensions  for  the
Cartesian coordinate system, shown in Fig. 2.1, is

∂ Jx
∂ x −

∂ Jy
∂ y −

−

∂ Jz
∂ z − q = ∂C

∂t . ............................................ (2.22)

The flux terms (Jy) and (Jz) have meanings analogous to (Jx) for flux in the y and z directions,
respectively. If we write the components of flux as the flux vector  J→ = {Jx, Jy, Jz}, Eq. 2.22
can be written in vector notation as

−∇ · J→ − q = ∂C

∂t , ....................................................... (2.23)

where the divergence of vector  J→ = {Jx, Jy, Jz}, in Cartesian coordinates, is

∇ · J→ =

∂ Jx
∂ x +

∂ Jy
∂ y +

∂ Jz
∂ z . ............................................... (2.24)

The  divergence  operator  ∇ ·  is  an  example  of  an  operator  from  vector  analysis  that  deter-
mines  the  spatial  variation  of  a  vector  or  scalar  field.  Following  Fanchi,4  we  first  review  the
concepts of scalar and vector fields and then define gradient (grad), divergence (div), and curl
operators.

2.3.1 Scalar and Vector Fields.  We define scalar and vector fields in a Cartesian coordinate
system with position vector

x→ = xi^ + y j^ + zk^, ......................................................... (2.25)
where  {i^, j^, k^}  are  unit  vectors  defined  along  the  orthogonal  {x,y,z}  coordinate  axes.  If  we
can associate a scalar function ( f ) with every point in a region (R), then the scalar field may
be written as

f (x, y, z) = f( x→). ......................................................... (2.26)

Examples of scalar fields include pressure, temperature, and saturation.

If,  instead  of  a  scalar  function  ( f ),  we  can  associate  a  vector   v→  with  every  point  in  the

region (R), we can construct a vector field of the form

v→(x, y, z) = v→( x→). ........................................................ (2.27)
The vector field is a function that assigns a vector to every point in the region R. Examples of
vector fields include the Darcy velocity field and seismic velocities.

I-52

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Fig. 2.3—Gradient ∇f normal to surface S.

2.3.2 Gradient, Divergence, and Curl.  The spatial variation of a scalar or vector field can be
determined with the del operator ∇. The del operator, ∇, is defined in Cartesian coordinates
as

∇ ≡ i^ ∂

∂ x + j^ ∂

∂ y + k^ ∂

∂ z . ................................................. (2.28)

The gradient of a scalar field (f) is obtained by operating on the scalar field with the del opera-
tor, thus

grad f = ∇ f ≡(i^ ∂

∂ x + j^ ∂

∂ y + k^ ∂

∂ z) f = i^∂ f

∂ x + j^∂ f

∂ y + k^∂ f

∂ z . ............... (2.29)

The  direction  of  the  gradient  of  the  scalar  field  ( f )  evaluated  at  a  point  is  oriented  in  the
direction of maximum increase of the scalar field. In addition, the vector field, ∇ f , is perpen-
dicular to a surface that corresponds to a constant value of the scalar field (Fig. 2.3).

Two outcomes are possible when the del operator is applied to a vector field. One outcome
is to create a scalar, and the other is to create a vector. A scalar is obtained when we take the
dot  product  of  the  del  operator  with  a  vector  field  ( v→).  The  result  is  the  divergence  of  the
vector field.

The  curl  of  the  vector  field   v→  is  called  the  rotation  of  the  vector  field.  It  is  a  vector  that  is
normal to the plane containing the vector field  v→. The divergence of the gradient of a scalar
field ( f ) is

∇ × (∇ f ) ≡ ∇2 f = ∂2 f

∂ x2 + ∂2 f

∂ y2 + ∂2 f

where we introduce the Laplacian operator,

∇2 = ∂2

∂ x2 + ∂2

∂ y2 + ∂2

∂ z2 , ................................................. (2.33)

in Cartesian coordinates.

The  gradient,  divergence,  curl,  and  Laplacian  operators  arise  in  many  PDEs  that  affect
petroleum  engineering.  For  example,  a  vector  field   v→  is  said  to  be  irrotational  if  curl v→ = 0,
and it is said to be solenoidal if div v→ = 0. These properties of the vector field are useful for
analyzing the propagation of seismic waves. Another useful application of vector analysis is to
the mathematical representation of fluid flow in two or three spatial dimensions. Two examples
are presented next.

2.3.3 Incompressible Flow.  Incompressible  flow  occurs  when  the  density  of  a  fluid  is  con-
stant. In this case, the continuity equation for flow of a fluid with density (ρ) and velocity ( v→)
has concentration (C) and flux ( J→) given by

C = ρ, J→ = ρ v→. ........................................................... (2.34)

The concentration and density are scalar fields, and the velocity and flux are vector fields. The
continuity equation without source or sink terms becomes

∂t + ∇ ·(ρ v→) = 0. ....................................................... (2.35)
∂ρ

A  more  suitable  form  of  the  continuity  equation  for  describing  incompressible  fluid  flow  is
obtained by substituting the differential operator,

D
D t = ∂

∂t + v→

· ∇, ....................................................... (2.36)

into Eq. 2.35 to obtain

D ρ
D t + ρ∇ · v→ = 0. ......................................................... (2.37)

In the case of incompressible fluid flow, density is constant and Eq. 2.37 reduces to

∇ · v→ = 0. ............................................................... (2.38)

I-54

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Eq. 2.38 shows that the divergence of the velocity of a flowing, incompressible fluid is zero.

2.3.4 Three-Dimensional  (3D)  Convection/Dispersion  Equation.    The  convection/dispersion
equation in three dimensions is obtained by writing flux ( J→) in the multidimensional form

J→ = C v→ − D ∇C. ......................................................... (2.39)

Substituting Eq. 2.39 into the 3D continuity equation gives

−∇ · C v→ + ∇ · D ∇C − q = ∂C

∂t . ........................................... (2.40)

If we assume that  v→ and D are constant, we can simplify Eq. 2.40 to the form of

D ∇2C − v→

· ∇C − q = ∂C

∂t . ............................................... (2.41)

· ∇C is the convection term.

Eq. 2.41 is the 3D convection/dispersion equation. The term D ∇2C is the dispersion term, and
the term − v→
2.4 Numerical Methods
Systems of nonlinear PDEs are needed to describe realistic multiphase, multidimensional flow
in  a  reservoir.  As  a  rule,  these  equations  cannot  be  solved  analytically;  they  must  be  solved
with  numerical  methods.  To  illustrate  the  mathematics,  we  discuss  the  numerical  solution  of
the 1D C/D equation.

D ∂2C
∂ x2 − v∂C

∂ x = ∂C

∂t , .................................................... (2.42)

as introduced in Sec. 2.2. As a reminder, v is velocity, D is dispersion, and C is concentration.
Eq.  2.42  is  a  good  example  to  use  because  it  illustrates  many  useful  numerical  methods  that
can be compared with the analytical solution given by Eq. 2.20. We first introduce the concept
of  finite  differences  to  convert  Eq.  2.42  to  an  equation  that  can  be  solved  numerically.  We
then present a numerical representation of Eq. 2.42 and illustrate its solution. For more details,
you  should  consult  the  chapter  on  reservoir  simulation  in  Vol.  V,  Reservoir  Engineering  and
Petrophysics, as well as Refs. 8 through 14.

2.4.1 Finite Differences.  One way to solve a PDE is to convert the PDE to finite-difference
form. The finite-difference form is obtained by replacing the derivatives in the PDE with differ-
ences that are obtained from Taylor’s series. To illustrate the procedure, let us suppose that we
know  the  function   f (x)  at  two  discrete  points  x = xi  and  x = xi + Δx,  where  Δx  is  an  incre-
ment  along  the  x-axis  (Fig.  2.4).  We  can  approximate  the  derivative  d f (x) / dx  at  x = xi  by
solving the Taylor’s series,

f (xi + Δx) = f (xi) + Δx d f

for d f (x) / dx. The result is

If we neglect ET, we obtain the finite-difference approximation of the first derivative.

Eq. 2.46 is an approximation because we are neglecting all of the terms in  ET, which is called
the truncation error. In the limit as the increment Δx approaches zero, the truncation error ap-
proaches zero, and the finite difference approaches the definition of the derivative.

The finite difference in Eq. 2.46 is called a forward difference. Other differences are possi-

ble. Two that we use next are the backward difference,
f (xi) − f (xi − Δx)

and the centered difference,

Eqs. 2.46 through 2.48 are all derived from Taylor’s series.

2.42,  see  Chap.  4  of  Ref.  8.  In  our  example,  we  choose  a  backward  difference  for  the  time
derivative  in  Eq.  2.42,  a  centered  difference  for  the  space  derivative  in  the  convection  term,
and a centered-in-time/centered-in-space difference for the dispersion term. Eq. 2.42 is convert-
ed from a PDE to the difference equation

Δx = xi + 1 − xi. The concentration at time tn + 1 and spatial location xi is denoted by Ci
The future concentration distribution is found from the current concentration distribution by

Eq. 2.53 can be written in matrix form as

M C = D, ................................................................. (2.54)

where M  is the NX × NX matrix of coefficients, C is the column vector of unknown concentra-
tions at time tn + 1, and D is the column vector of right-hand-side terms that depend on known
concentrations at time tn. Both column vectors C and D have NX elements.

The  system  of  equations  in  Eq.  2.54  is  called  a  tridiagonal  system  because  it  consists  of
three lines of nonzero diagonal elements centered about the main diagonal. All other elements
are  zero.  Techniques  for  solving  the  tridiagonal  system  of  equations,  using  the  Thomas  algo-
rithm, are presented in Refs. 8 through 11 and Ref. 15. A solution of the set of equations for
physical parameters v = 1 ft/day and D = 0.01 ft2/day and finite-difference parameters Δx = 0.1
ft  and  Δt  =  0.1  day  is  shown  in  Fig.  2.5.  The  difference  between  the  analytical  solution  and
the  numerical  solution  is  because  of  numerical  dispersion,8,16–17  which  is  beyond  the  scope  of
this chapter. What interests us here is the appearance of matrices in the mathematics of fluid
flow. Matrices are the subject of the next section.

2.5 Matrices and Linear Algebra
An example of a matrix was introduced in Sec. 2.4 for the 1D C/D equation. It is often easier
to  work  with  many  fluid  flow  equations  when  they  are  expressed  in  terms  of  matrices.  Our
review follows the presentation in Ref. 4. We begin our discussion with an example of a ma-
trix  that  is  used  later  in  this  chapter,  namely  the  matrix  associated  with  the  rotation  of  a
coordinate system. We then summarize some important properties of matrices and determinants
and review the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors from linear algebra.

2.5.1 Rotation of a Cartesian Coordinate System.  Fig. 2.6 illustrates a rotation of Cartesian
coordinates from one set of orthogonal coordinates {x1, x2} to another set {y1, y2} by the an-
gle θ. The equations relating the coordinate systems are

y1 = x1 cos θ + x2 sin θ;
y2 = − x1 sin θ + x2 cos θ.

................................................ (2.55)

The set of equations in Eq. 2.55 has the matrix form

2.5.2 Properties of Matrices.  In general, a matrix with m  rows and n  columns has the order
and is referred to as a m × n matrix. The entry in the ith row and jth column of the
m × n

Chapter 2—Mathematics of Fluid Flow

I-59

matrix is the ijth element of the matrix. If the number of rows equals the number of columns
so that m = n, the matrix is called a square matrix. On the other hand, if m ≠ n, the matrix is
a rectangular matrix.

If the matrix has a single column so that n = 1, it is a column vector as in Eq. 2.58. If the
matrix has a single row so that m = 1, it is a row vector. A row vector can be created from a
column vector by taking the transpose of the column vector. For example, the transpose of the
column vector x in Eq. 2.58 may be written as

xT =

T

x1
x2

= x1 x2 , ................................................... (2.60)

where the superscript T  denotes the transpose of the matrix. In general, we can write a m × n
matrix  A with a set of elements {ai j : i = 1, 2 ,

... n; j = 1, 2 ,

... m} as

A = ai j . ................................................................. (2.61)

The transpose of matrix  A is

AT = ai j

T = a ji . ......................................................... (2.62)

The  conjugate  transpose  of  matrix   A  is  obtained  by  finding  the  complex  conjugate  of  each
element in  A and then taking the transpose of the matrix  A. This operation can be written as

A+ = A* T = ai j

* T = a ji

* , .................................................. (2.63)

where * denotes complex conjugation. Recall that the conjugate z* of a complex number z  is
obtained  by  replacing  the  imaginary  number  i = −1  with  −i = − −1  wherever  it  occurs.  If
all the elements of matrix  A are real, the conjugate transpose of matrix  A is equal to the trans-
pose of matrix  A.

I-60

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

If  the  matrix   A  is  a  square  matrix  and  the  elements  of  matrix   A  satisfy  the  equality
ai j = a ji, the matrix  A is called a symmetric matrix. A square matrix  A is Hermitian, or self-
adjoint, if  A = A+ (i.e, the matrix equals its conjugate transpose).
The set of elements {aii} of a square matrix  A is the principal diagonal of the matrix. The
elements {a ji} with i ≠ j are off-diagonal elements. The matrix  A is a lower triangular matrix
if ai j = 0 for i < j, and  A is an upper triangular matrix if ai j = 0 for i > j. The matrix  A is a
diagonal matrix if ai j = 0 for i ≠ j.
2.5.3 Matrix  Operations.
  A, B, and C  with  elements
{ai j}, {bi j}, and {ci j}have the same order m × n. We are using double underlines to denote
matrices. Other notations are often used, such as boldface. The addition or subtraction of two
matrices may be written as

 matrices

 

 Suppose

 the

A ± B = C ,

ai j ± bi j = ci j. ............................................... (2.64)

The product of a matrix  A with a number k  may be written as

B = k A,

bi j = k ai j. ...................................................... (2.65)

The product of matrix  A with order m × n and matrix B with order n × p is

C = A B ,

n
ci j = ∑
q = 1

aiqbq j, ................................................. (2.66)

where matrix C has order m × p. Notice that matrix multiplication is possible only if the num-
ber of columns in  A equals the number of rows in B. This requirement is always satisfied for
square matrices.

The transpose of the product of two square matrices  A and B is

(A B)T = BT AT, ............................................................ (2.67)

and the adjoint of the product of two square matrices is

(A B)+ = B+A+. ............................................................ (2.68)

Notice that the product of two matrices may not be commutative (i.e.,  A B ≠ B A in general).

The identity matrix, I, is a square matrix with all off-diagonal elements equaling zero and
all diagonal elements equaling one. The identity matrix preserves the identity of a square ma-
trix  A in matrix multiplication, thus

A I = I A = A. ............................................................. (2.69)

By contrast, a null matrix 0 is a matrix in which all elements are zero. In this case, the product
of the null matrix with a matrix  A is

Chapter 2—Mathematics of Fluid Flow

I-61

A0 = 0 A = 0. .............................................................. (2.70)

The matrix,  A, is singular if the product of matrix  A with a column vector x  that has at least
one nonzero element yields the null matrix; that is,  A is singular if

A x = 0 , x ≠ 0. ........................................................... (2.71)

The concepts of identity matrix and matrix singularity are needed to define the inverse ma-

trix. Suppose we have two square matrices  A and B that satisfy the product

A B = B A = I. ............................................................. (2.72)

Notice that the matrices  A and B commute. The matrix  A is nonsingular, and the matrix B is
the inverse of  A, thus B = A−1, where  A−1 denotes the inverse of  A. Eq. 2.72 can be written in
terms of the inverse as

A A−1 = A−1 A = I. ......................................................... (2.73)

The inverse matrix is useful for solving systems of equations. For example, suppose we have a
system of equations that satisfies

A x = b , .................................................................. (2.74)

where the column vector b  and the matrix  A are known, and the column vector x  contains a
set of unknowns. Eq. 2.54 is an example for the 1D C/D equation. We can solve for x in Eq.
2.74 by premultiplying Eq. 2.74 by  A−1. The result is

A−1A x = x = A−1b .

....................................................... (2.75)

Of course, we have to know  A−1 to find x. This leads us to a discussion of determinants.

2.5.4 Determinants, Eigenvalues, and Eigenvectors.  The determinant (det) of a square matrix
A is  denoted  by   det (A)  or   | A| .  Two  examples  of  determinants  are  the  determinants  of  a
2 × 2matrix and a 3 × 3 matrix. The determinant of a 2 × 2 matrix is

det

a11 a12
a21 a22

= a11a22 − a21a12, ............................................ (2.76)

and the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix is

det

a21 a22 a23

= a11a22a33 + a12a23a31 + a13a21a32

........................................... (2.77)

Determinants  are  useful  for  determining  if  an  inverse  matrix   A−1  exists.  Inverse  matrices
 The  condition
are  needed  to  solve  finite-difference  equations  representing  fluid  flow.
det (A) ≠ 0 says  that  an  inverse  matrix   A−1  exists,  even  though  we  may  not  know  the  ele-
ments  of  the  inverse  matrix.  Determinants  are  also  useful  for  determining  eigenvalues  and
eigenvectors.

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are useful for understanding the behavior of physical quanti-
ties that may be represented by a matrix. An example in fluid flow is permeability, which we
discuss in more detail later in this chapter. First, we need to define the concepts of eigenvalue
and eigenvector.

Eigenvalues are the values of λ in the eigenvalue equation

A x = λ x, ................................................................. (2.78)

where   A is  an  n × n  square  matrix  and  x  is  a  column  vector  with  n  rows.  The  eigenvalue
equation may be written as

(A − λ I ) x = 0, ............................................................ (2.79)

where I  is the n × n identity matrix. Eq. 2.79 has nonzero solutions,  x, if the eigenvalue, λ, is
a characteristic root of  A, that is, λ must be a solution of

det (A − λ I ) = 0........................................................... (2.80)

Eq. 2.80 is the characteristic equation of  A, and the n values of λ are the characteristic roots of
the characteristic equation. The characteristic roots, λ, are obtained by expanding the determi-
nant in Eq. 2.80 into an nth-degree polynomial and then solving for the n  values of λ. These
concepts are illustrated in the next section.

2.6 Diagonalizing the Permeability Tensor
The form of Darcy’s law that is most widely used in formulating fluid flow equations in reser-
voir  simulators  assumes  that  the  coordinate  system  is  aligned  with  the  principal  axes  of  the
permeability  tensor.  The  resulting  diagonalized  permeability  greatly  simplifies  the  fluid  flow
equations. The simplified equations are easier to code and can be solved with less computation
time than fluid flow equations that include the full permeability tensor. Research in naturally-
fractured-reservoir  modeling,18  geomechanics,19  and  upscaling20  has  demonstrated  that  the  full
permeability  tensor  is  needed  to  correctly  solve  fluid  flow  problems  in  a  variety  of  realistic
settings.  The  mathematical  procedure  for  diagonalizing  the  permeability  tensor  is  presented
here as an illustration of the mathematics discussed in Sec. 2.5. The relationship between the
diagonalized-permeability-tensor  assumption  and  grid  orientation  is  discussed  in  Sec.  2.7.  An
understanding of the relationship between grid orientation and the permeability tensor can help
us decide how to orient a fluid flow grid to most accurately represent the permeability distribu-
tion in a reservoir. The directional dependence of permeability and the permeability tensor are
first introduced. The procedure for diagonalizing the permeability tensor is then presented.

2.6.1 Darcy’s Law and the Permeability Tensor.   In  one  dimension,  Darcy’s  law  says  that
flow rate is proportional to pressure gradient. This can be expressed in oilfield units for single-
phase flow as

where  q→ is flow rate (B/D), x is length (ft), A is cross-sectional area (ft2), μ is fluid viscosity
(cp), k is permeability (md), and Φ is the phase potential (psia).

Φ = P − γ(Δz). ............................................................. (2.82)

In  Eq.  2.82,  Δz  is  depth  from  a  datum  (ft),  P  is  fluid  pressure  (psia),  and  γ  is  the  pressure
gradient associated with the gravity term (psia/ft). The form of Darcy’s law with full permeabil-
ity tensor in Cartesian coordinate system {x, y, z} is

where we have treated the cross-sectional area, A, as a constant with respect to direction. Eq.

by treating permeability as a matrix. We are interested here in the matrix representation.

The diagonal permeability elements {kxx, kyy, kzz} represent the dependence of flow rate in
one direction on pressure differences in the same direction. The off-diagonal permeability ele-
ments  {kxy,  kxz,  kyx,  kyz,  kzx,  kzy}  account  for  the  dependence  of  flow  rate  in  one  direction  on
pressure  differences  in  orthogonal  directions.  Expanding  Eq.  2.83  gives  the  corresponding  set
of three equations demonstrating this dependence.

2.6.2 Similarity  Transformations.    Eq.  2.85  relates  flow  rate  (q)  and  the  pressure  gradient
term, Λ.  We  can  use  a  similarity transformation to  diagonalize the  matrix k  while  preserving
the form of the relationship between q and Λ. Let us first show that a similarity transformation
preserves the form of Eq. 2.85.

We begin by multiplying Eq. 2.85 on the left by  A to find

Aq = AkΛ, ............................................................... (2.87)

where  A is a nonsingular, n × n square matrix. Because  A is nonsingular, it is invertible; that
is, it satisfies the equality

A−1A = AA−1 = I, .......................................................... (2.88)

where I  is the n × n identity matrix. Substituting Eq. 2.88 into Eq. 2.87 gives

Aq = Ak A−1AΛ. ........................................................... (2.89)

Defining the transformed matrices

q′= Aq and
Λ′= AΛ,

................................................................ (2.90)

and using the similarity transformation

in Eq. 2.89 yields

Eq. 2.92 is the same form as Eq. 2.85.

k′= Ak A−1............................................................... (2.91)

q′= k′Λ′. ................................................................ (2.92)

 the

 has

mation matrix  A. The procedure for finding a matrix  A that diagonalizes an n × n matrix k  is
as follows:4
• Find the eigenvalues {λi: i = 1, …, n} of k  from the eigenvalue equation det(k − λI) = 0.
• Find n linearly independent eigenvectors {ai : i = 1, ⋯ n}.
• Form the similarity transformation matrix  A with the eigenvectors as columns.

Chapter 2—Mathematics of Fluid Flow

I-65

• Calculate the diagonalized matrix k´. The diagonal entries of k´ are the eigenvalues corre-

sponding to the eigenvectors {ai : i = 1, ⋯ n}.
The coordinate axes {x′, y′, z′} are the principal axes of the diagonalized tensor, and the
diagonal  form  of  the  permeability  tensor  is  obtained  by  a  principal-axis  transformation.  The
flow equations along the principal axes are

............................................... (2.93)

The  form  of  the  permeability  tensor  depends  on  the  properties  of  the  porous  medium.  If  the
medium  is  anisotropic,  at  least  two  elements  of  the  diagonalized  permeability  tensor  are  not
equal. If permeability does not depend on direction, then permeability is isotropic, and the ele-
ments of the diagonalized permeability tensor are equal, that is,

kx′x′= ky′y′= kz′z′= k. ...................................................... (2.94)

If the magnitude of the elements of the permeability tensor varies from one point in the medi-
um  to  another,  the  permeability  tensor  is  heterogeneous;  otherwise,  permeability  is  homoge-
neous. The principal axes of the permeability tensor may also vary from point to point in the
medium if permeability is heterogeneous.

2.6.4 Diagonalizing a Symmetric 2 × 2 Matrix.  The ideas previously presented are implement-
ed by applying the matrix diagonalization algorithm to the 2 × 2 symmetric matrix

k =

k11 k12
k21 k22

, ........................................................... (2.95)

as viewed in the two-dimensional (2D) Cartesian coordinate system  x = {x1, x2} shown in Fig.
2.6. For this example, we require that the elements of k  satisfy the relations

k11 ≠ k22
k12 = k21. ................................................................. (2.96)

The relation k12 = k21 for off-diagonal elements is necessary to assure that the matrix k  is sym-
metric.  The  requirement  that  k  is  symmetric  is  important  when  we  consider  a  coordinate
transformation. To find the diagonal matrix k´ corresponding to k, we must first solve the eigen-
value problem

det k − λI = 0. ............................................................ (2.97)

The two characteristic roots or eigenvalues λ+ and λ– of Eq. 2.97 are the diagonal elements of
the diagonalized 2 × 2 matrix k´, thus

where λ+ and λ– are calculated as the solutions to the eigenvalue problem.

k22 − λ | = 0, .................................................... (2.99)

(k11 − λ)(k22 − λ) − k12k21 = 0.................................................. (2.100)

We expand the characteristic equation to get

k11k22 − λ(k11 + k22) + λ2 − k12

2 = 0. ............................................ (2.101)

The two eigenvalues are found from the quadratic equation to be

2.7 Rotational Transformation of a 2 × 2 Permeability Tensor
We want to calculate changes to the permeability tensor when we transform from a coordinate
system  y = {y1, , y2} where only the diagonal elements of a square matrix k´ are nonzero to a
coordinate  system  x = {x1, x2}  in  which  a  2  ×  2  square  matrix  k  has  nonzero  off-diagonal
elements.  We  do  this  by  performing  a  similarity  transformation  on  the  matrix  k.  The  coordi-
nate systems x = {x1, x2} and  y = {y1, , y2} are related by the similarity transformation matrix
A such that

y = Ax.

................................................................ (2.127)

The two coordinate systems are shown in Fig. 2.6.

An angle (θ) is associated with the transformation in Eq. 2.127 by writing the 2D coordi-

nate transformation as

y1

=

cos θ
− sin θ

.

........................................... (2.128)

The coordinate systems x = {x1, x2} and  y = {y1, , y2} are related by the counterclockwise ro-
tation  shown  in  Fig.  2.6.  We  have  an  aligned  coordinate  system   y = {y1, , y2}  with  the
principal  axes  of  the  permeability  tensor.  The  diagonal  tensor  in  the  coordinate  system
y = {y1, , y2}has the form

k′=( kmax 0

kT), ......................................................... (2.129)

0

I-70

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

where  kmax  is  the  maximum permeability in  the  direction y1  and  kT  is  the  permeability that is
transverse to kmax in the direction y2. We want to know how the elements of the permeability
tensor change if we transform to the different coordinate system  x = {x1, x2}.

The relationship between the elements of k′ and k  is

k′= Ak A−1, ............................................................. (2.130)

where  A is

A =

cos θ
− sin θ

sin θ

. ..................................................... (2.131)

If we multiply Eq. 2.130 from the left by  A−1 and from the right by  A, we obtain

k = A−1k′A.

............................................................ (2.132)

We find the elements of  A−1 by solving

A−1A =

The result is

A−1 =

where  AT is the transpose of  A. Substituting Eqs. 2.131 and 2.134 into 2.132 gives

k =

kmax cos 2θ + kT sin 2θ

kmax cos θ sin θ − kT cos θ sin θ

kmax sin θ cos θ − kT sin θ cos θ

kmax sin 2θ + kT cos 2θ

=

k11 k12
k21 k22

.

........................................................... (2.135)

We can use Eq. 2.135 to calculate the elements of k  for any rotation angle θ. If the permeabili-
ty is isotropic, we have kmax = kT = kiso and Eq. 2.135 simplifies to the form

k =

Fig. 2.7—Coordinate rotation in 2D.

Fig. 2.8—Plan view of channel sand with two permeability regions.

In the special case of isotropic permeability, the orientation of the coordinate system does not
affect the values of the elements of the permeability tensor.

Fig. 2.7 shows the results for an anisotropic case in which kmax = 200 md and kT = 50 md.
The values of elements k11, k12 and k22 of k  are presented in the figure. The off-diagonal terms
satisfy  the  equality  k12  =  k21  for  a  symmetric  matrix  given  in  Eq.  2.96,  so  it  is  sufficient  to
show only k12. The values of the diagonal elements change most as θ approaches 45°, and the
values of the off-diagonal elements are greatest at θ = 45°. A rotation of 90° recovers a diago-
nal permeability tensor, but kmax is now aligned along x2, and kT is aligned along x1.

2.7.1 Gridding a Channel Sand.  The ideas discussed are now considered in the context of a
realistic application. Our problem is to find a coordinate system that lets us accurately model
fluid flow in a channel sand with the two permeability regions in Fig. 2.8.

Fig. 2.9—Case A: homogeneous and anisotropic permeability.

Fig. 2.10—Case B: heterogeneous and anisotropic permeability.

We  can  highlight  important  features  of  the  relationship  between  grid  orientation  and  the
assumption of diagonalized permeability by assuming the permeability in each region is anisotrop-
ic with a maximum permeability kmax and a permeability kT that is transverse to the direction of
kmax. The diagonalized, anisotropic permeability tensor k′ in the y1-y2 plane of a channel sand
is the matrix

2.10.

Fig. 2.11—Possible coordinate systems for grid orientation.

Fig. 2.11 shows two possible coordinate systems for orienting the grid. Coordinate system
y = {y1, , y2}is  more  closely  aligned  with  the  spatial  orientation  of  Region  I  than  coordinate
system x = {x1, x2}, while coordinate system x = {x1, x2} is more closely aligned with the spa-
tial  orientation  of  Region  II  than  coordinate  system   y = {y1, , y2}.  The  coordinate  system
y = {y1, , y2}is obtained by rotating the coordinate system x = {x1, x2} through an angle θ as
in Fig. 2.6.
We  consider  four  grid  orientations  for  each  case:  (1)  grid   y = {y1, , y2}  in  Regions  I  and
II; (2) grid  y = {y1, , y2} in Region I and grid x = {x1, x2} in Region II; (3) grid x = {x1, x2}
in Region I and grid  y = {y1, , y2} in Region II; and (4) grid  y = {y1, , y2} in Regions I and
II. The grid orientation cases allow us to consider the effect of different coordinate systems on
the permeability tensor in each region. We assume in our analysis that the reservoir simulator
is a typical simulator with a formulation of fluid flow equations that uses Darcy’s law with a
diagonal permeability tensor. We also assume the simulator allows different grid orientations in
different regions of the model; otherwise, grid orientation cases 2 and 3 are not feasible. Our

I-74

analysis  does  not  include  multidimensional  numerical  dispersion,17  which  can  also  affect  the
accuracy of flow calculations. Results of the analysis are summarized in Table 2.4.

An “ok” in the “Permeability Tensor” column in Table 2.4 indicates that the diagonal per-
meability tensor is aligned with the grid. An “X” indicates that the magnitudes of the diagonal
terms in the permeability tensor must be corrected with Eq. 2.135. An “ok” in the “Formula-
tion” column in Table 2.4 indicates that the formulation of the fluid flow equations is correct.
An “X” indicates that the formulation of the fluid flow equations is incorrect because the for-
mulation does not include off-diagonal terms in the permeability tensor. Based on the results in
Table 2.4, we observe that the grid orientation in Case A.1 provides the most faithful represen-
tation of the permeability tensor in Case A, and the grid orientation in Case B.2 provides the
most faithful representation of the permeability tensor in Case B.

Mathematics of Transient Analysis
Erdal Ozkan, Colorado School of Mines

This  chapter  explains  how  fluid  flow  in  porous  media  can  be  translated  into  a  mathematical
statement and how mathematical analysis can be used to answer transient-flow problems. This
broad area is common to many other disciplines, such as heat conduction in solids and ground-
water  hydrology.  The  objective  of  this  chapter  is  to  introduce  the  fundamentals  of  transient
analysis, present examples, and guide the interested reader to relevant references.

3.1 Introduction
Most  physical  phenomena  in  the  domain  of  transient  fluid  flow  in  porous  media  can  be  de-
scribed  generally  by  partial  differential  equations  (PDEs).  With  appropriate  boundary  condi-
tions and sometimes with simplifying assumptions, the PDE leads to an initial boundary value
problem  (IBVP)  that  is  solved  to  find  a  mathematical  statement  of  the  resulting  flow  in  the
porous  medium.  This  section  briefly  discusses  the  statement  of  the  IBVP  for  transient  fluid
flow in porous media.

3.1.1 Equations of Transient Fluid Flow in Porous Media.  In essence, fluid motion in porous
media  can  be  specified  by  the  knowledge  of  the  velocity  vector,   v→,  and  the  density  of  the
fluid, ρ, as a function of the position (x, y, z) and time, t; that is,  v→ = v→(x, y, z, t) and ρ= ρ
(x, y, z, t). Relative to the fixed Cartesian axes, the velocity vector can be written as

v→ = vx ix

→ + vy iy

→ + vz iz

→, ..................................................... (3.1)

→,iy

→, and  iz

→ are the unit vectors in the

where vx, vy, and vz are the velocity components, and  ix
x, y, and z directions, respectively.

The physical law governing the macroscopic fluid-flow phenomena in porous media is the
conservation of mass, which states that mass is neither created nor destroyed. The mathemati-
cal formula of this rule is developed by considering the flow through a fixed arbitrary closed
surface, Γ, lying entirely within a porous medium of porosity Φ, which is filled with a fluid of
viscosity μ. Fig. 3.1 illustrates an arbitrary closed surface in porous medium.

The conservation of mass principle requires that the difference between the rates at which
fluid enters and leaves the volume through its surface must equal the rate at which mass accu-
mulates within the volume. The total mass within the volume at any time is given by

which,  by  the  conservation  of  mass  law,  is  equal  to  the  rate  at  which  mass  enters  V  through

Consider the differential surface element, dΓ, shown in Fig. 3.1. The mass entering the vol-

and the total mass of the fluid passing through Γ during Δt is

The surface integral in Eq. 3.4 accounts for both influx and outflux through the surface of
the volume; that is, ΔMg is the difference between the masses entering and leaving the control
volume during the time increment, Δt. Then, the mass rate entering the volume, V, through its
surface, Γ, can be written as

A more useful relation is found with the divergence theorem, which states that the flux of
ρ v→through the closed surface, Γ, is identical to the volume integral of ∇ ·(ρ v→) (the diver-
gence of ρ v→) taken throughout V; that is,

If  the  functions  involved in  the  argument of  the  integral in  Eq.  3.10  are  continuous,  then  the
integral is identically zero if and only if its argument is zero (because the volume integral in
Eq. 3.10 is identically zero for any arbitrarily chosen volume). Then, the following continuity
equation can be obtained.

(ρ Φ) + ∇ ·(ρ v→) = 0. ................................................... (3.11)

∂

Eq. 3.11 is a PDE that is equivalent to the statement of the conservation of mass for fluid
flow in porous media. For practical purposes, however, Eq. 3.11 is expressed in terms of pres-
sure  because  density  and  velocity  cannot  be  measured  directly.  To  express  density,  ρ,  and
velocity,   v→,  in  terms  of  pressure,  we  use  an  equation  of  state  and  a  flux  law,  known  as
Darcy’s law, respectively.

The following definition of isothermal fluid compressibility, c, is a useful equation of state

that relates density to pressure.

If  c  is  a  constant  (the  compressibility  of  many  reservoir  liquids  may  be  considered  as  con-
stant), then Eq. 3.12 can be integrated to yield

ρ = ρ0 exp c(p − p0) , ...................................................... (3.13)

I-80

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

where  subscript  0  indicates  the  conditions  at  the  datum.  Similarly,  the  compressibility  of  the
porous rock, cf , is defined by

c f = 1
Φ

∂Φ
∂p , ............................................................. (3.14)

and the total system compressibility, ct , is given by

ct = c + c f . ................................................................ (3.15)

These definitions of compressibility help recast Eq. 3.11 in terms of pressure.

Darcy’s law for fluid flow in porous media is a flux law. Neglecting the gravity effect, it is

expressed by

v→ = − k

μ ∇ p. ............................................................. (3.16)

In  Eq.  3.16,  μ  is  the  viscosity  of  the  fluid,  and  k  is  the  permeability  tensor  of  the  formation
given by

k =( kαα kαβ kαγ

kβα kββ kβγ
kγα

kγγ), ....................................................... (3.17)

kγβ

where α, β, and γ are the directions, and kij is the permeability in the i direction as a result of
the pressure gradient in the j direction.

If Eqs. 3.13 through 3.16 are used in Eq. 3.11, an alternative statement of the conservation

of mass principle for fluid flow in porous media is obtained:

∇ ·( k

μ ∇ p) + c k

μ

(∇ p)2 = Φ ct

∂p
∂t . .......................................... (3.18)

Eq. 3.18 is the PDE that governs transient fluid flow in porous media. In the present form, Eq.
3.18 is not very useful in obtaining practical solutions because of the nonlinearity displayed in
the second term of the left side. For liquid flow, the viscosity, μ, is constant and Eq. 3.18 can
be linearized by assuming that the pressure gradients, ∇ p, are small in the reservoir and the
compressibility of the reservoir liquids, c, is on the order of 10−5 or smaller. Then, the second
term of the left side of Eq. 3.18 may be neglected compared with the remaining terms and the
following linear expression is obtained:

∇ · (k ∇ p) = Φ ct μ ∂p

∂t . ................................................... (3.19)

Eq. 3.19 (or Eq. 3.18) is known as the diffusivity equation. As an example in Cartesian coordi-
nates,  assuming  that  the  coordinate  axes  can  be  chosen  in  the  directions  of  the  principal
permeabilities, k, in Eq. 3.19, may be represented by the following diagonal tensor:

Then, Eq. 3.19 may be written as

∂2p
∂x2 + ky

∂2p
∂y2 + kz

∂2p
∂z2 = Φ ct μ ∂p

∂t . ........................................ (3.21)

If each coordinate, j = x, y, or z, is multiplied by  k / kj, where k may be chosen arbitrarily
), Eq. 3.21 may be trans-

(to preserve the material balance, k is usually chosen to be  kxkykz
formed into the diffusion equation for an isotropic domain:

η∇2p − ∂p

∂t = 0, .......................................................... (3.22)

where η is the diffusivity constant defined by

η =

k
Φ ct μ . ................................................................ (3.23)
If the same transformation is also applied to the boundary conditions (see Sec. 3.1.2), the
problems in anisotropic reservoirs may be transformed into those in isotropic reservoirs provid-
ed  that  the  system  is  infinite  or  bounded  by  planes  perpendicular  to  the  principal  axes  of
permeability. In all other cases, this transformation distorts the bounding surfaces.

For the flow of gases, the assumptions of small fluid compressibility and pressure gradient
may not be appropriate and the c(∇ p)2 term in Eq. 3.18 may not be negligible. In these cases,
an expression similar to Eq. 3.21 may be obtained from Eq. 3.18 in terms of pseudopressure,
m, as

kx

∂x2 + ky

Here, the pseudopressure is defined by1

p
m(p) = 2∫
0

p′
μ Z d p′, ......................................................... (3.25)

where  Z  is  the  compressibility  factor.  To  define  a  complete  physical  problem,  Eq.  3.21  (or
3.24) should be subject to the initial and boundary conditions discussed in Sec. 3.1.2.

3.1.2 Initial  and  Boundary  Conditions.    The  solution  of  the  diffusivity  equation  (Eq.  3.19)
should satisfy the initial condition in the porous medium. The initial condition is normally ex-
pressed in terms of a known pressure distribution at time zero; that is,

I-82

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

p(x, y, z, t) = f (x, y, z). ................................................ (3.26)

lim
t → 0

The  most  common  initial  condition  is  the  uniform  pressure  distribution  in  the  entire  porous
medium; that is, f (x, y, z) = pi.

The  boundary  conditions  are  specified  at  the  inner  (wellbore)  and  outer  boundaries  of  the
reservoir. These are usually in the form of prescribed flux or pressure at the boundaries. The
condition of prescribed flux can be formulated as

(∂p
∂n)Γ

= g(t), ............................................................. (3.27)

where  Γ  is  the  surface  of  the  boundary,  and  n  indicates  the  outward  normal  direction  of  the
boundary surface. The prescribed flux condition may be used at the inner and outer boundaries
of the reservoir. The most common use of the prescribed flux condition at the inner boundary
is for the production at a constant rate. In this case, the function, g(t), is related to a constant
production rate, q. At the outer boundary, the prescribed flux condition is usually used to indi-
cate impermeable boundaries [g(t)=0] and leads to a pseudosteady state under the influence of
boundaries.

For some applications, pressure may be specified at the inner and outer boundaries. In this

case,

(p)Γ = h(t). ............................................................... (3.28)

When  used  at  the  inner  boundary,  this  condition  represents  production  at  a  constant  pressure,
pwf; that is, h(t) = pwf. At the outer boundary, specified pressure, pe, is usually a result of injec-
tion or influx from an adjacent aquifer, which usually leads to steady state in the reservoir.

It is also possible to have boundary conditions of mixed type. These usually correspond to
interface conditions in porous media. Ref. 2 contains more details about the common boundary
conditions for the diffusion equation.

3.1.3 Assumptions and Limits.  Some  assumptions  have  been  made  in  the  derivation  of  the
diffusivity equation given by Eq. 3.19. These assumptions determine the limits of applicability
of the solutions obtained from Eq. 3.19. One of the most important assumptions involved is the
continuity  of  the  properties  involved  in  Eq.  3.19.  (This  was  required  to  obtain  Eq.  3.19  from
the more general integral form in Eq. 3.10.) Therefore, sharp changes in the properties of the
reservoir rock and fluid (such as faults and fluid banks) should be incorporated in the form of
boundary or interface conditions in the solution of Eq. 3.19.

The  second  important  assumption  is  that  Darcy’s  law  describes  the  flux  in  porous  media.
This  assumption  is  valid at  relatively low  fluid  velocities that may  be  appropriate to  describe
liquid flow. At high velocities (when Reynolds number based on average sand grain diameter
approaches  unity)  such  as  those  observed  in  gas  reservoirs,  Darcy’s  law  is  not  valid.3  In  this
case,  Forchheimer’s  equation,4  which  accounts  for  the  inertial  effects,  should  be  used.  In
petroleum  engineering,  it  is  a  common  practice  to  consider  the  additional  pressure  drop  as  a
result of non-Darcy flow in the form of a pseudoskin because it is usually effective in a small
vicinity of the wellbore. Therefore, in this chapter, we do not consider non-Darcy flow in the
reservoir.

3.2 Bessel Functions
As  Sec.  3.3  illustrates,  the  Laplace  transform  of  the  diffusion  equation  in  radial  coordinates
yields a modified Bessel’s equation, and its solutions are obtained in terms of modified Bessel

extent that they are encountered in the solutions of more common petroleum engineering prob-
lems.

Bessel’s equation of order v is called a modified Bessel function of order v.

3.2.2 Solutions of Bessel’s Equations and Bessel Functions.  There are many methods of ob-
taining or constructing Bessel functions.5 Only the final form of the Bessel functions that are
of interest are presented here.

If v is not a positive integer, then the general solution of Bessel’s equation of order v (Eq.

3.29) is given by

y = AJv(z) + BJ−v(z), ....................................................... (3.32)

where A and B are arbitrary constants, and Jv(z) is the Bessel function of order v of the first
kind given by

. ............................................. (3.36)

Similarly, if v is not a positive integer, the general solution of the modified Bessel’s equation
of order v (Eq. 3.31) is given by

y = AIv(k z) + BI−v(k z), ..................................................... (3.37)

where Iv(z) is the modified Bessel function of order v of the first kind defined by

∞ (k z / 2)v + 2m
Iv(z) = ∑
m = 0

m! Γ(v + m + 1) . .................................................. (3.38)

If v is a positive integer, n, Iv, and I−v are linearly dependent. The solution for this case is

y = AIn(k z) + BKn(k z), ..................................................... (3.39)

where Kn(z) is the modified Bessel function of order n of the second kind and is defined by

Kn(z) = lim

The  modified  Bessel  functions  of  order  zero  and  one  are  of  special  interest,  and  Sec.  3.2.3
discusses some of their special features.

3.2.3 Modified Bessel Functions of Order Zero and One.  Modified Bessel functions of order
zero and one are related to each other by the following relations:

These  relations  are  useful  in  the  evaluation  of  the  asymptotic  behavior  of  transient-pressure
solutions.

3.3 Laplace Transformation
Integral  transforms  are  useful  in  solving  differential  equations.  A  special  form  of  the  linear
integral transforms, known as the Laplace transformation, is particularly useful in the solution
of the diffusion equation. The Laplace transformation of a function, F(t), denoted by L{F(t)},
is defined by

where s is a number whose real part is positive and large enough for the integral in Eq. 3.58 to
exist. In this chapter, a bar over the function indicates the image or the Laplace transform of
the function; that is,

p(s) = L{p(t)}. ............................................................ (3.59)

3.3.2 Inverse Laplace Transformation and Asymptotic Forms.  For the Laplace transform to
be useful, the inverse Laplace transformation must be uniquely defined. L−1 denotes the inverse
Laplace transform operator; that is,

p(t) = L−1{p(s)}. .......................................................... (3.69)

In this operation, p(t) represents the inverse (transform) of the Laplace domain function,  p(s).
A uniqueness theorem of the inversion guarantees that no two functions of the class ε have the
same Laplace transform.6 The class ε is defined as the set of sectionally continuous functions F
(t)  that  are  continuous  on  each  bounded  interval  over  the  half  line  t  >  0  except  at  a  finite
number of points, ti, where they are defined by

F(ti) = 1

2 F(ti − 0) + F(ti + 0) , ............................................... (3.70)

and  | F(t) | < Meαt for any constants M and α.

The  most  rigorous  technique  to  find  the  inverse  Laplace  transform  of  a  Laplace  domain
function  is  the  use  of  the  inversion  integral,6  but  its  discussion  is  outside  the  scope  of  this
chapter. For petroleum engineering applications, a simple table look-up procedure is usually the
first resort. Table 3.1 shows an example table of Laplace transform pairs that may be used to
find  the  Laplace  transforms  of  real-space  functions  or  the  inverse  Laplace  transforms  of  the
Laplace domain functions. Fairly large tables of Laplace transform pairs can be found in Refs.
6 and 7. The relations given in the Laplace transform tables may be extended to more complex
functions with the fundamental properties of the Laplace transforms noted in Sec. 3.3.1.

When  a  simple  analytical  inversion  is  not  possible,  numerical  inversion  of  a  Laplace  do-
main  function  is  an  alternate  procedure.  Many  numerical  inversion  algorithms  have  been
proposed in the literature. For the inversion of the transient-flow solutions in Laplace domain,
the numerical inversion algorithm suggested by Stehfest8 is the most popular algorithm.

The  Stehfest  algorithm  is  based  on  a  stochastic  process  and  suggests  that  an  approximate
value,   pa(T),  of  the  inverse  of  the  Laplace  domain  function,   p(s),  may  be  obtained  at  time
t = T by

pa(T) = ln 2

. .................. (3.72)

In  Eqs.  3.71  and  3.72,  N  is  an  even  integer.  Although,  theoretically,  the  accuracy  of  the
inversion should increase as N tends to infinity [pa (T ) should tend to p(T )], the accuracy may
be lost because of round-off errors when N becomes large. Normally, the optimum value of N
is determined as a result of a numerical experiment. As a reference, however, the range of 6 ≤
N ≤ 18 covers the most common values of N for transient-flow problems. The Stehfest algo-
rithm is not appropriate for the numerical inversion of oscillatory and discontinuous functions.
In these cases, a more complex algorithm proposed by Crump9 may be used.

In some cases, obtaining asymptotic solutions for small and large values of time may be of
interest.  These  asymptotic  results  may  be  obtained  without  inverting  the  full  solution  into  the
real-time domain. The limiting forms of the full solution as s → ∞ and s → 0 correspond to
the  limiting  forms  in  the  time  domain  for  short  and  long  time,  respectively.  The  inversion  of
the limiting forms may be easier than the inversion of the full solution. Examples 3.1 through
3.4 demonstrate the use of Laplace transformation in the solution of transient-flow problems.

Example 3.1  Consider  transient  flow  toward  a  fully  penetrating  vertical  well  in  an  infi-

nite homogeneous reservoir of uniform thickness, h, and initial pressure, pi.

Solution. This problem may be formulated most conveniently in the radial coordinates. The

diffusivity equation governing fluid flow in porous media is given, in radial coordinates, by

where ∆p = pi – p. Eq. 3.73 is the same in absolute (cgs or SI) or Darcy units. (In field units,
some conversion coefficients are involved in Eq. 3.73.) The initial condition is

Δp(r, t = 0) = 0, ........................................................... (3.74)

which means that the pressure is uniform and equal to pi initially throughout the reservoir. The
outer boundary condition for an infinite reservoir is

Δp(r → ∞, t) = 0, ......................................................... (3.75)

which  physically  means  that  for  any  given  time,  t,  there  is  a  large  enough  distance,  r,  in  the
reservoir at which the initial pressure, pi, has been preserved.

The  inner  boundary  condition  depends  on  the  production  conditions  at  the  surface  of  the

wellbore (r = rw). Assuming that the well is produced at a constant rate, q, for all times,

(r ∂Δp
∂r )r = rw

= − qBμ

2πk h . ................................................... (3.76)

The  inner  boundary  condition  given  in  Eq.  3.76  is  simply  a  restatement  of  the  flux  law
(Darcy’s law given by Eq. 3.16) at the surface of the wellbore.

Eqs. 3.73 through 3.76 define the IBVP to be solved to obtain the transient-pressure distri-

bution for the given system. Application of the Laplace transforms to Eq. 3.73 yields

To  complete  the  solution  of  the  problem,  Eq.  3.85  should  be  inverted  into  the  real-time
domain.  The  real  inversion  of  Eq.  3.85,  however,  is  not  available  in  terms  of  standard  func-
tions. One option is to use Stehfest’s numerical inversion algorithm8 as discussed in Sec. 3.3.2.
The dashed line in Fig. 3.3 represents the numerical inversion of the solution in Eq. 3.85. An-
other  option  is  to  find  an  approximate  inversion.  One  of  these  asymptotic  forms  is  known  as
the line-source solution and commonly used in transient-pressure analysis.

To obtain the line-source approximation of the solution given in Eq. 3.85, we assume that
the radius of the wellbore is small compared with the other dimensions of the reservoir. Thus,
if we assume rw→0 and use the relation given in Eq. 3.56, we obtain

Fig. 3.3 shows a comparison of the results computed from Eq. 3.85 (finite-wellbore radius)
and  Eq.  3.91  (line  source)  for  the  data  noted  in  the  figure.  The  two  solutions  yield  different
results at early times but become the same at later times. In fact, it can be shown analytically
that the long-time approximation of the finite-wellbore radius solution (Eq. 3.85) is the same as
the  line-source  well  solution.  To  show  this,  we  note  that  the  long-time  approximation  of  the
solution  in  the  time  domain  corresponds  to  the  limiting  form  of  the  solution  in  the  Laplace

Example 3.3  Consider  the  flowing  wellbore  pressure  of  a  fully  penetrating  vertical  well

with wellbore storage and skin in an infinite reservoir.

Solution.  Revisit  the  case  in  Example  3.1  and  add  the  effect  of  a  skin  zone  around  the
wellbore. Assume that the constant production rate is specified at the surface so that the stor-
age  capacity  of  the  wellbore  needs  to  be  taken  into  account.  Before  presenting  the  initial-
boundary value problem, skin factor and surface production rate should be defined.

Using van Everdingen and Hurst’s thin-skin concept10 (vanishingly small skin-zone radius),

the skin factor is defined by

sm =

p(rw + ) − pw f
(r ∂p

where  qsf  is  the  sandface  production  rate,  p(rw  +)  denotes  the  reservoir  pressure  immediately
outside  the  skin-zone  boundary,  and  pwf  is  the  flowing  wellbore  pressure  measured  inside  the
wellbore. Rearranging Eq. 3.110, we obtain the following relation for the flowing wellbore pres-
sure.

When the production rate is specified at the surface, it is necessary to account for the fact
that  the  wellbore  can  store  and  unload  fluids.  The  surface  production  rate,  q,  is  equal  to  the
sum of the wellbore unloading rate, qwb, and the sandface production rate, qsf ; that is,

q = qwb + qs f , ............................................................ (3.112)

3.4 Green’s Functions and Source Functions
Green’s  function  and  source  functions  are  used  to  solve  2D  and  3D  transient-flow  problems
that  may  result  from  complex  well  geometries,  such  as  partially  penetrating  vertical  and  in-
clined  wells,  hydraulically  fractured  wells,  and  horizontal  wells.  Before  introducing  these
techniques, it is useful to clarify the terminology.

In our terminology, a source is a point, line, surface, or volume at which fluids are with-
drawn from the reservoir. Strictly speaking, fluid withdrawal should be associated with a sink,
and  the  injection  of  fluids  should  be  related  to  a  source.  Here,  however,  the  term  source  is
used for both production and injection with the convention that a negative withdrawal rate indi-
cates injection.

Green’s  functions  and  source  functions  are  closely  related.  A  Green’s  function  is  defined
for a differential equation with specified boundary conditions (prescribed flux or pressure) and
corresponds to an instantaneous point-source solution. A source function, on the other hand, is
the  solution  of  the  given  differential  equation  with  specified  boundary  conditions  and  source
geometry.

The details of the theory and application of Green’s function and source functions for the
solution  of  transient-flow  problems  in  porous  media  can  be  found  in  Ref.  2  and  Refs.  13
through  20.  A  brief  account  of  the  use  of  these  techniques  is  presented  here,  as  well  as  an
introduction of the fundamental solution and point-source concepts.

where δ(M, M′, t, τ) is a generalized (symbolic) function15 called the Dirac delta function and
is defined on the basis of its following properties:

The delta function is symmetric in M and M′ and also in t and τ. In this formulation, the
delta function represents the symbolic density of a unit-strength, concentrated source located at
M′ and acting at time τ. In physical terms, this source corresponds to an infinitesimally small
well (located at point M′) at which a finite amount of fluid is withdrawn (or injected) instanta-
neously  (at  time  τ).  Therefore,  the  solution  of  Eq.  3.144  (the  fundamental  solution)  is  also
known  as  the  instantaneous  point-source  solution.  Formally,  the  point-source  solution  corre-
sponds to the pressure drop, Δp = pi − p, at a point M and time t in an infinite porous medium
(reservoir) because of a point source of unit strength located at point M′ and acting at τ <t.

3.4.2 The  Source-Function  Solutions  of  the  Diffusion  Equation.    The  point-source  solution
was  first  introduced  by  Lord  Kelvin16  for  the  solution  of  heat  conduction  problems  and  was
extensively discussed by Carslaw and Jaeger.14 The point-source solution is usually obtained by
finding the limiting form of the pressure drop resulting from a spherical source as the source
volume vanishes. To demonstrate the derivation of the instantaneous point-source solution, con-
sider the transient flow of a slightly compressible fluid of constant compressibility and viscosi-
ty toward a spherical source of radius r = a in an infinite, homogeneous, and isotropic porous
medium. Because of the spherical symmetry of the physical problem, we can conveniently ex-
press the governing equation of fluid flow in porous media in spherical coordinates as

q˜

This solution may be interpreted as the pressure drop at a distance r  because of a volume of
fluid,  q˜,  instantaneously  withdrawn  at  r  =  0  and  t  =  0.  Consistent  with  this  interpretation,
q˜/ (Φc)is the strength of the source, which is the pressure drop in a unit volume of the porous
medium caused by the instantaneous withdrawal of a volume of fluid, q˜ (see Eq. 3.155).

Instantaneous Point Source in an Infinite Reservoir.  Nisle21 presented a more general solu-
tion  for  an  instantaneous  point  source  of  strength  q˜/ (Φc)  acting  at  t  =  τ  in  an  infinite,
homogeneous, but anisotropic reservoir as

Δp(M, M′, t − τ) =

In Eq. 3.158, M and M′ indicate the locations of the observation point and the source, respec-
tively. For a 3D Cartesian coordinate system, M = (x, y, z), M′ = (x′, y′, z′), and (M − M′)2/η˜ =
(x − x′)2/ηx + (y − y′)2/ηy + (z − z′)2/ηz with ηx, ηy, and ηz representing the diffusivity constants
(defined in Eq. 3.23) in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.

Continuous Point Source in an Infinite Reservoir.  If the fluid withdrawal is at a continuous
rate, q˜(t), from time 0 to t, then the pressure drop as a result of a continuous point source in an
infinite reservoir is obtained by distributing the point sources of strength q˜(τ) / (Φc) over a time
interval 0 ≤ τ ≤ t. This is given by

ing  to  the  pressure  drop  because  of  production  from  a  line,  surface,  or  volumetric  source,

source geometry. For example, the pressure drop as a result of an infinite line source at x′, y′

Source Functions for Bounded Reservoirs.  The  source  solutions  discussed  previously  can
be extended to bounded reservoirs. The method of images provides a convenient means of gen-
erating the bounded-reservoir solutions with the use of the infinite reservoir solutions, especial-
ly  when  the  reservoir  boundaries  consist  of  impermeable  and  constant-pressure  planes.  The
method of images is an application of the principle of superposition, which states that if f1 and

f2 are two linearly independent solutions of a linear PDE and c1 and c2 are two arbitrary con-
stants,  then  f3  =  c1 f1  +  c2 f2  is  also  a  solution  of  the  PDE.  Examples  of  source  functions  in
bounded reservoirs are presented here.

Instantaneous Point Source Near a Single Linear Boundary.  To generate the effect of an
impermeable  planar  boundary  at  a  distance  d  from  a  unit-strength,  instantaneous  point  source
in an infinite reservoir (see Fig. 3.7), we can apply the method of images to the instantaneous
point-source solution given in Eq. 3.157 as

tween  the  two  sources  is  a  no-flow  boundary.  Similarly,  to  generate  the  effect  of  a  constant-
pressure  boundary,  we  use  the  method  of  images  and  the  unit-strength,  instantaneous  point-
source solution (Eq. 3.160) as follows:

3.4.3 The Use of Green’s Functions and Source Functions in Solving Unsteady-Flow Problems.
As discussed in Sec. 3.4.2, the conventional development of the source-function solutions uses
the  instantaneous  point-source  solution  as  the  building  block  with  the  appropriate  integration
(superposition) in space and time. In 1973, Gringarten and Ramey13 introduced the use of the
source  and  Green’s  function  method  to  the  petroleum  engineering  literature  with  a  more  effi-
cient method of developing the source solutions. Specifically, they suggested the use of infinite-
plane  sources  as  the  building  block  with  Newman’s  product  method.22  In  this  section,  we
discuss the use of Green’s functions and source functions in solving unsteady-flow problems in
reservoirs.

Green’s function for transient flow in a porous medium is defined as the pressure at M (x,

In Eq. 3.193, the boundary of the porous medium consists of two surfaces: the inner bound-

Γe. Eq. 3.193 may be written as

The  integration  in  the  right  side  of  Eq.  3.201  represents  the  distribution  of  instantaneous
point  sources  over  the  length,  area,  or  volume  of  the  source  (well),  and  S  denotes  the  corre-
sponding instantaneous source function. In Sec. 3.4.2, we discussed the conventional derivation
of  the  source  functions  starting  from  the  basic  instantaneous  point-source  solution.  Here,  we
discuss the use of infinite-plane sources as the building block with Newman’s product method.22
Newman’s product method22 may be stated for transient-flow problems in porous media as
follows:13 if a well/reservoir system can be visualized as the intersection of 1D or 2D systems,
then the instantaneous source or Green’s function for this well/reservoir system can be construct-
ed  by  the  product  of  the  source  or  Green’s  functions  for  the  1D  and/or  2D  systems.  For
example, an infinite line-source well at x = x′, y = y′, and −∞ ≤ z′ ≤ +∞ in an infinite reservoir
may be visualized as the intersection of two infinite, 1D plane sources; one at x = x′, −∞ ≤ y′
≤ +∞, and −∞ ≤ z′ ≤ +∞, and the other at −∞ ≤ x′ ≤ +∞, y = y′, and −∞ ≤ z′ ≤ +∞. Then, the
instantaneous  source  function  for  this  infinite  line-source  well,  S(x,  x′,  y,  y′,  t  −  τ),  may  be
obtained as the product of two infinite, 1D plane sources, given by

S( j, j′, t − τ) =

. .......... (3.203)

As expected, this solution is the same as Eq. 3.163, which was obtained by integration of
an instantaneous point source in an infinite reservoir. For a radially isotropic reservoir (ηx = ηy
= ηz), Eq. 3.203 yields

S(r, r′, θ, θ′, t − τ) =

4ηr(t − τ) , ............................. (3.204)

Similarly,  intersecting  three  infinite  instantaneous  plane  sources  (or  a  line  source  and  a

plane source), we can obtain the instantaneous point-source solution in an infinite reservoir as

Instantaneous  plane  sources  in  slab  reservoirs  can  be  generated  with  the  plane  sources  in
infinite reservoirs and the method of images as discussed in Sec. 3.4.2. Similarly, the instanta-
neous slab sources can be obtained by integrating plane sources over the thickness of the slab
source  (see  Sec.  3.4.2).  Table  3.2,  compiled  from  the  work  of  Gringarten  and  Ramey,13
presents the basic instantaneous source functions in infinite reservoirs, and Table 3.3 shows the
corresponding geometries of the source-reservoir systems. The basic instantaneous source func-
tions  given  in  Table  3.3  may  be  used  to  construct  the  source  functions  that  represent  the
appropriate well geometry by Newman’s product method.

Gringarten and Ramey13 have also presented the approximating forms of the instantaneous
linear sources and the time ranges for these approximations to be valid. The approximate solu-
tions are very useful in obtaining expressions for pressure distributions at early and late times
and identifying the flow regimes during the corresponding time periods. Table 3.4 presents the
short-  and  long-time  approximating  forms  for  instantaneous  linear  sources  and  their  time
ranges. Examples 3.6 and 3.7 present some applications of the product-solution method and the
derivation of the approximate solutions for pressure distributions.

Example 3.6  Consider  transient  flow  toward  a  partially  penetrating  vertical  fracture  of
vertical penetration hf and horizontal penetration 2xf in an infinite, homogeneous, slab reservoir
of uniform thickness, h, and initial pressure, pi, with impermeable top and bottom boundaries.

Solution.  Fig.  3.11  shows  the  geometry  of  the  well  reservoir  system  of  interest.  Approxi-
mate  the  fracture  by  a  vertical  plane  of  height  hf  and  length  2xf.  The  corresponding  source
geometry may be visualized as the intersection of an infinite plane source at y = y′ in an infi-
nite reservoir (Source I in Tables 3.2 and 3.3), an infinite-slab source of thickness 2xf at x = x′
in an infinite reservoir (Source IV), and an infinite-slab source of thickness hp=hf at z = zw in
an infinite-slab reservoir of thickness h (Source VIII). Then, by Newman’s product method, the
appropriate source function is given by

reservoir (Source I in Tables 3.2 and 3.3) and an infinite-slab source of thickness 2xf at x = x′
in an infinite reservoir (Source IV). This source function then could be used in Eq. 3.200.

the early-time flow is radial in the y-z plane around the axis of the horizontal well. This solu-
tion corresponds to the time period during which none of the reservoir boundaries influence the

ate  time-flow  behavior.  If  we  approximate  the  source  function  in  the  x  direction  (Source

This approximation should correspond to the time period during which the influence of the
top and/or bottom boundaries may be evident but the lateral boundaries in the x and y direc-
tions  do  not  have  an  influence  on  the  pressure  response.  This  solution  also  could  have  been
obtained by assuming a laterally infinite reservoir. In this case, the source function would have
been constructed as the product of three source functions: an infinite-plane source at y = y′ in
an infinite reservoir (Source I in Tables 3.2 and 3.3), an infinite-slab source of thickness Lh at
x = x′ in an infinite reservoir (Source IV), and an infinite-plane source at z = zw in an infinite-
slab reservoir of thickness h with impermeable boundaries (Source V).

3.4.4 The Use of Source Functions in the Laplace Domain To Solve Unsteady-Flow Problems.
There are many advantages of developing transient-flow solutions in the Laplace transform do-
main. For example, in the Laplace transform domain, Duhamel’s theorem23 provides a conve-
nient means of developing transient-flow solutions for variable-rate production problems using
the solutions for the corresponding constant-rate production problem. Duhamel’s theorem states
that if Δp and Δpc denote the pressure drawdown corresponding to the variable production rate,
q(t), and the constant production rate, qc, respectively, then

I-122

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

The simplicity of the expression given in Eq. 3.220 explains our interest in obtaining transient-
flow solutions in the Laplace transform domain.

Another  example  to  explain  the  convenience  of  the  Laplace  domain  solutions  is  for  the
naturally  fractured  reservoirs.  Common  transient-flow  models  of  naturally  fractured  reservoirs
lead  to  the  following  differential  equation  in  radial  coordinates  in  the  Laplace  transform
domain:2

where the subscript f indicates the fracture property, and tD and rD are the dimensionless time
and distance (as defined in Eqs. 3.230 and 3.234).
The naturally fractured reservoir function, f (s), is a function of matrix and fracture proper-
ties  and  depends  on  the  model  chosen  to  represent  the  naturally  fractured  reservoir.2  The
corresponding differential equation for a homogeneous reservoir is obtained by setting f (s) = 1

where the right side of Eq. 3.227 indicates the substitution of sf (s) for s in sΔp(s). This discus-
sion  demonstrates  that  it  is  possible  to  derive  transient-flow  solutions  for  naturally  fractured
reservoirs by following the same lines as those for the homogeneous reservoirs. Furthermore, if
the solution for the corresponding homogeneous reservoir system is known in the Laplace trans-
form  domain,  then  the  solution  for  the  naturally  fractured  reservoir  problem  may  be  directly
obtained from Eq. 3.227.

Obtaining the Laplace transforms of the Green’s and source function solutions developed in
the time domain with the methods explained in Secs. 3.4.2 and 3.4.3 usually poses a difficult
problem. The problems arise mainly because of the use of the product method solution. For a
specific class of functions, Chen et al.24 presented a technique that may be used to apply the
Laplace transform to the product-solution technique. For a more general procedure to develop
source function solutions in the Laplace transform domain, however, the product solution tech-
nique should be avoided.20

Ozkan and Raghavan18,19 have shown that it is more convenient to develop source-function
solutions  in  the  Laplace  transform  domain  if  the  point-source  solution  is  used  as  a  building
block. Then, other source geometries may be obtained by the superposition (integration) of the
point sources along the length, surface, or volume of the source.

Point-Source Solution in the Laplace Domain.  Consider the flow of a slightly compressible
fluid in an infinite, naturally fractured reservoir. We can use the double-porosity model suggest-
ed  by  Barenblatt  et  al.25  and  Warren  and  Root26  to  develop  the  governing  flow  equations  for
naturally fractured reservoirs. The results, however, will be applicable to the model suggested
by Kazemi27 and de Swaan-O28 with a simple modification.

Flow around a point source in an infinite porous medium may be expressed conveniently in
spherical coordinates. The  differential equations governing  flow  in  a  naturally fractured reser-
voir are given in spherical coordinates by

In  Eqs.  3.228  and  3.229,  subscripts  f  and  m  indicate  the  property  of  the  fracture  and  matrix
systems, respectively. Initial pressure, pi, is assumed to be uniform in the entire system; that is,
pfi = pmi = pi. The dimensionless time, tD, is defined by

The inner-boundary condition corresponding to the instantaneous withdrawal of an amount
of fluid, q˜, at t = 0 from a point source is obtained by considering the mass balance on a small
sphere. If we require that at any time t =T > 0, the sum of the flux through the surface of a
small sphere around the source location must equal the volume of the fluid, q˜, instantaneously
withdrawn from the sphere at t = 0, we can write29

Although  the  withdrawal  of  fluids  from  the  sphere  is  instantaneous,  the  resulting  flow  in  the
porous  medium,  and  the  flux  across  the  surface  of  the  sphere,  is  continuous.  Therefore,  if  q
represents the total flux across the surface of the small sphere during the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤
T, then the mass balance requires that the cumulative production (flux across the surface of the
small  sphere)  at  time  T  be  equal  to  the  instantaneous  withdrawal  volume  of  fluid  from  the
sphere. That is,

In Eq. 3.245, the term q˜/ (VΦct) f + (VΦct)m  represents the strength of the source for the nat-
urally fractured porous medium.
The solution of Eqs. 3.242, 3.244, and 3.245 yields the following solution for the pressure
distribution in the reservoir, except at the source location (the origin), because of an instanta-
neous point source of strength q˜/ (VΦct) f + (VΦct)m  acting at t = 0:

ren  and  Root26  can  also  be  used  for  the  model  suggested  by  Kazemi27  and  de  Swaan-O,28
provided  that  the  appropriate  f(s)  function  is  invoked.  To  obtain  the  solution  for  a  homoge-

Only  sources  in  infinite  reservoirs  have  been  considered  so  far.  These  solutions  may  be
easily extended to bounded reservoirs. The following sections present some useful solutions for
transient-flow problems in bounded porous media. The first group of solutions is for laterally
infinite reservoirs bounded by parallel planes in the vertical direction (infinite-slab reservoirs).
The second and third groups comprise the solutions for cylindrical and rectangular reservoirs,
respectively.

Solutions for Infinite-Slab Reservoirs.  In  this  section,  we  consider  one  of  the  most  com-
mon  reservoir  geometries  used  in  pressure-transient  analysis  of  wells  in  porous  media.  It  is
assumed that the lateral boundaries of the reservoir are far enough not to influence the pressure
response during the time period of interest. The top and bottom boundaries of the reservoir at z
=  0  and  z  =  h  are  parallel  planes  and  may  be  of  impermeable,  constant  pressure,  or  mixed
type. Table 3.6 presents the solutions for the most common well geometries (point-source, ver-
tical,  fractured,  and  horizontal  wells)  in  infinite-slab  reservoirs.  Next,  we  briefly  discuss  the
derivation of these solutions.

Consider  a  point  source  in  an  infinite-slab  reservoir  with  impermeable  boundaries  at  the
bottom, z = 0, and the top, z = h. To obtain the point-source solution for this case, we use the
point-source  solution  in  an  infinite  reservoir  given  by  Eq.  3.252  with  the  method  of  images.

The  point-source  solutions  for  infinite-slab  reservoirs  with  constant  pressure  and  mixed
boundaries at the top and bottom are obtained in a similar manner17 and are given in Table 3.6.
The point-source solutions can be used with Eqs. 3.254 and 3.256 to generate the solutions for
the other well geometries given in Table 3.6. For example, to generate the solution for a partial-
ly penetrating vertical line-source well of length hw in an infinite-slab reservoir with imperme-
able slab boundaries, we integrate the right side of Eq. 3.263 from zw − hw / 2 to zw + hw / 2
with respect to z′, where zw is the vertical coordinate of the midpoint of the open interval. If hw
=  h  (i.e.,  the  well  penetrates  the  entire  thickness  of  the  slab  reservoir),  then  this  procedure
yields the solution for a fully penetrating vertical line-source well. The solution for a partially
penetrating  fracture  of  height  hf  and  half-length  xf  is  obtained  if  the  point-source  solution  is
integrated  once  with  respect  to  z′  from  zw  −  hf  /  2  to  zw  +  hf  /  2  and  then  with  respect  to  x′
from  xw  –  xf  to  xw  +  xf,  where  xw  and  zw  are  the  coordinates  of  the  midpoint  of  the  fracture.
Similarly, the solution for a horizontal-line source well of length Lh is obtained by integrating
the point-source solution with respect to x′ from xw − Lh / 2 to xw + Lh / 2, where xw is the x-
coordinate of the midpoint of the horizontal well.

Solutions  for  Cylindrical  Reservoir.    Solutions  for  cylindrical  reservoirs  may  also  be  ob-
tained by starting from the point-source solution in the Laplace transform domain. The Laplace
domain  solution  for  a  point  source  located  at  r′D,θ′,  z′D  should  satisfy  the  following  diffusion
equation in cylindrical coordinates.19

Assuming that the reservoir is bounded by a cylindrical surface at rD = reD and by the parallel
planes  at  zD  =  0  and  hD,  we  should  also  impose  the  appropriate  physical  conditions  at  these
boundaries.

We seek a point-source solution for a cylindrical reservoir in the following form:

Δp = P + Q. .............................................................. (3.267)

In Eq. 3.267, P is a solution of Eq. 3.264 that satisfies Eq. 3.266 and the boundary conditions
at  zD  =  0  and  hD.  P  may  be  chosen  as  one  of  the  point-source  solutions  in  an  infinite-slab
reservoir given in Table 3.6, depending on the conditions imposed at the boundaries at zD = 0
and hD. If Q is chosen such that it satisfies the boundary conditions at zD = 0 and hD, its contri-
bution to the flux vanishes at the source location, and  P + Q satisfies the appropriate boundary
condition  at  rD  =  reD,  then  Eq.  3.267  should  yield  the  point-source  solution  for  a  cylindrical
reservoir with appropriate boundary conditions.

Consider the example of a closed cylindrical reservoir in which the boundary conditions are

This solution procedure may be extended to the cases in which the boundaries are at con-
stant pressure or of mixed type.19 Table 3.7 presents the point-source solutions for cylindrical
reservoirs for all possible combinations of boundary conditions. Solutions for other source ge-
ometries in cylindrical reservoirs may be obtained by using the point-source solutions in Table
3.7 in Eq. 3.255 (or Eq. 3.256).

Example 3.8  Consider a partially penetrating, uniform-flux fracture of height hf and half-
length xf in an isotropic and closed cylindrical reservoir. The center of the fracture is at r′ = 0,
θ′ =0, z′ = zw, and the fracture tips extend from (r′ = xf, θ = α + π) to (r′ = xf, θ = α).

Solution.  Fig.  3.15  shows  the  geometry  of  the  fracture/reservoir  system  considered  in  this
example.  The  solution  for  this  problem  is  obtained  by  first  generating  a  partially  penetrating
line source and then using this line-source solution to generate the plane source. The solution
for a partially penetrating line source at r′D,θ′, zw is obtained by integrating the corresponding
point-source solution given in Table 3.7 with respect to z′ from zw – hf / 2 to zw + hf / 2 and is

Example 3.9  Consider  a  uniform-flux,  horizontal  line-source  well  of  length  Lh  in  an
isotropic and closed cylindrical reservoir. The well extends from (r′ = Lh/2, θ = α + π) to (r′ =
Lh/2, θ = α), and the center of the well is at r′ = 0, θ′ = 0, z′ = zw.

Solution.  The  solution  for  a  horizontal  line-source  well  in  a  closed  cylindrical  reservoir  is
obtained by integrating the corresponding point-source solution in Table 3.7 with respect to r′
from 0 to Lh / 2 with θ′ = α + π in the third quadrant and with θ′ = α in the first quadrant. The

Solutions for Rectangular Parallelepiped Reservoir.  Solutions for rectangular parallelepiped
reservoirs may also be obtained by starting from the point-source solution in the Laplace trans-
form domain in an infinite reservoir and using the method of images to generate the effects of
the planar boundaries. Although the formal procedure to obtain the solution is fairly easy, the
use  of  the  method  of  images  in  three  directions  (x,  y,  z)  yields  triple  infinite  Fourier  series,
which  may  pose  computational  inconveniences.  As  an  example,  the  solution  for  a  continuous
point source located at x′, y′, z′ in a rectangular porous medium occupying the region 0 < x <
xe, 0 < y < ye, and 0 < z < h is obtained by applying the method of images to the point-source
solution given by Eq. 3.252:19,29

Following a procedure similar to the one explained here, it is possible to derive the point-
source solutions in rectangular parallelepiped reservoirs for different combinations of boundary
conditions.17,29 Table 3.8 gives these solutions, which may be used to derive the solutions for
the  other  source  geometries  with  Eq.  3.255  (or  Eq.  3.256).  Examples  3.10  and  3.11  demon-
strate the derivation of the solutions for the other source geometries in rectangular reservoirs.

Example 3.10  Consider a fully penetrating vertical fracture of half-length xf located at x′

= xw and y′ = yw in a closed rectangular reservoir.

Solution. Assuming uniform-flux distribution along the fracture surface, the solution for this
problem  is  obtained  by  integrating  the  corresponding  point-source  solution  in  Table  3.8,  first
with respect to z′ from 0 to h and then with respect to x′ from xw – xf to xw + xf. The result is

In Eq. 3.301, y˜D1, y˜D2, εn, εk, and εk, n are given by Eqs. 3.293 through 3.297.

Conversion From 3D to 2D Anisotropy.  The solutions previously presented assume that the
reservoir is anisotropic in all three principal directions, x, y, and z with kx, ky, and kz denoting
the corresponding permeabilities. In these solutions, an equivalent isotropic permeability, k, has
been defined by

3

k = kxkykz

. .............................................................. (3.302)

For some applications, it may be more convenient to define an equivalent horizontal permeabil-
ity by

kh = kxky................................................................ (3.303)

and replace k in the solutions given in this section (Sec. 3.4.4) by kh. Note that k takes place in
the definition of the dimensionless time tD (Eq. 3.230). Then, if we define a dimensionless time
t˜D based on kh , the relation between t˜D and tD is given by

t˜D = khtD / k. ............................................................. (3.304)

Because in the solutions given in this section the Laplace transformation is with respect to tD,
conversion from 3D to 2D anisotropy requires the use of the following property of the Laplace
transforms:

cF(cs) = L{F(t / c)}. ....................................................... (3.305)

As an example, consider the solution for a horizontal well in an infinite-slab reservoir. As-
suming  that  the  midpoint  of  the  well  is  the  origin  (xwD  =  0,  ywD  =  0)  and  choosing  the  half-
length  of  the  horizontal  well  as  the  characteristic  length  (i.e.,  ℓ  =  Lh  /  2),  the  horizontal-well
solution given in Table 3.6 may be written as

Computational Considerations and Applications.  The numerical evaluation of the solutions
given previously may be sometimes difficult, inefficient, or even impossible. Alternative com-
putational forms of some of these solutions have been presented in Refs. 18, 19, and 29. Here,
we present a summary of the alternative formulas to be used in the computation of the source
functions  in  the  Laplace  transform  domain.  Some  of  these  formulas  are  for  computations  at
early  or  late  times  and  may  be  useful  to  derive  asymptotic  approximations  of  the  solutions
during the corresponding time periods.

As Sec. 3.3.1 notes, the short- and long-time approximations of the solutions correspond to
the limiting forms of the solution in the Laplace transform domain as s→∞ and s→0, respec-
tively.  In  the  solutions  given  in  this  section,  we  have  defined  u  =  sf(s).  From  elementary
considerations,  it  is  possible  to  show  that  the  definition  of  f(s)  given  in  Eq.  3.243  yields  the
following limiting forms:

lim
s → ∞

u = lim

s f (s) = sω................................................... (3.321)

and

lim
s → 0

u = lim
s → 0

f (s) = s. ...................................................... (3.322)

These limiting forms are used in the derivation of the short- and long-time asymptotic approxi-
mations. In the following expressions, homogeneous reservoir solutions are obtained by substi-
tuting ω = 1.

The integrals in Eqs. 3.324 through 3.326 may be evaluated with the standard numerical inte-
gration algorithms for yD ≠ 0. For yD = 0, the polynomial approximations given by Luke30 or
the  following  power  series  expansion  given  by  Abramowitz  and  Stegun7  may  be  used  in  the
computation of the integrals in Eqs. 3.324 through 3.326:

As  Refs.  18,  19,  and  29  show,  it  is  possible  to  derive  the  following  short-  and  long-time

Example 3.12  Consider a fully penetrating, uniform-flux fracture of half-length xf located

at x′=0, y′=0 in an infinite-slab reservoir with closed top and bottom boundaries.

The  numerical  evaluation  of  the  integrals  in  Eqs.  3.368  through  3.370  for  yD  ≠  0  should  be
straightforward with the use of the standard numerical integration algorithms. For yD = 0, the
polynomial approximations given by Luke30 or the power series expansion given by Eq. 3.327
should be useful.

The  short-  and  long-time  asymptotic  approximations  of  the  fracture  solution  are  also  ob-
tained by applying the relations given by Eqs. 3.330 and 3.332, respectively, to the right side
of Eq. 3.367. This procedure yields, for short times,

The  computation  of  the  first  term  in  the  right  side  of  Eq.  3.375  [2πk hΔp f / (qμ)]  is  the
same as the computation of the fracture solution given by Eq. 3.367 and has been discussed in

given by Eqs. 3.347 through 3.350. Of particular interest is the case for −1 ≤ xD ≤ +1. In this

Although  the  assumption  given  in  Eq.  3.387  may  not  be  justified  by  itself,  the  solution
given  in  Eq.  3.392  is  a  very  good  approximation  for  Eq.  3.385,  especially  when  reD  is  large.
For a fracture at the center of the cylindrical drainage region, Eq. 3.392 simplifies to

It  is  also  possible  to  obtain  short-  and  long-time  approximations  for  the  solution  given  in
Eq.  3.393.  For  short  times,  u→∞  and  the  second  term  in  the  argument  of  the  integral  in  Eq.
3.393 becomes negligible compared with the first term. Then, Eq. 3.393 reduces to the solution
for  an  infinite-slab  reservoir  given  by  Eq.  3.367,  of  which  the  short-time  approximation  has
been discussed in Example 3.12.

To obtain a long-time approximation, we evaluate Eq. 3.393 at the limit as s→0 (u→s). As
shown  in  Sec.  3.2.3,  for  small  arguments  we  may  approximate  the  Bessel  functions  in  Eq.
3.393 by

K0(z) = − ln (eγz / 2), ..................................................... (3.394)
K1(z) = 1 / z + (z / 2) ln (eγz / 2) − 1 / 2 , ....................................... (3.395)

and

I1(z) = z / 2 + z3 / 16, ....................................................... (3.397)

where γ = 0.5772 … . With Eqs. 3.394 through 3.397 and by neglecting the terms of the order
s3/2, we may write29

Therefore, the solution given by Eq. 3.402 may be written as follows for computation at early

I-162

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

pD f = pDi + pDb, ........................................................ (3.411)

where  pDi is given by Eq. 3.409 and corresponds to the solution for a fractured well in an infinite-
slab  reservoir  (see  Eq.  3.367  in  Example  3.12)  and   pDb  represents  the  contribution  of  the
lateral boundaries and is given by

pDb = pDb1 + pDb2 + pDb3. ................................................. (3.412)

In Eq. 3.412,  pDb1,  pDb2, and  pDb3 are given, respectively, by Eqs. 3.406, 3.407, and 3.410.
The integrals appearing in Eqs. 3.409 and 3.410 may be evaluated by following the lines out-
lined by Eqs. 3.324 through 3.326.

It is also possible to derive short- and long-time approximations for the fracture solution in
a  closed  rectangular  parallelepiped.  The  short-time  approximation  corresponds  to  the  limit  of
the solution as s→∞. It can be easily shown that the  pDb term in Eq. 3.411 becomes negligi-
ble  compared  with  the   pDi  term  for  which  a  short-time  approximation  has  been  obtained  in
Example 3.12 (see Eqs. 3.371 and 3.372).
To  obtain  a  long-time  approximation  (small  values  of  s),  the  solution  given  in  Eq.  3.402

Fluid Sampling

4.1 Introduction
Many  general  petroleum  engineering  texts  have  sections  covering  the  measurement  of  phase
behavior or pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) analysis, but few have detailed descriptions of
fluid-sampling practices. This chapter covers the sampling of all produced reservoir fluids. It is
intended  to  provide  an  overview  of  sampling  methods,  guidelines  for  selecting  suitable  meth-
ods, and detailed procedures for the most common practices.

An enormous range of reservoir fluids exists, and this means that the limited measurements
of produced oil and gas properties that can be made in the field are far from adequate to pro-
vide  the  detailed  characterization  that  modern  petroleum  engineering  requires.  In  addition  to
PVT  analysis,  of  fundamental  importance  to  reservoir  management,  measurements  relating  to
corrosion potential, solids formation, and nonhydrocarbon constituents have the potential to pro-
duce  serious  effects  on  the  design  of  production  facilities,  on  compatibility  with  pipeline
transport, on product sales value, on refinery maintenance costs, and on reservoir asset values
in general. The lack of such data could easily represent more risk than that tolerated when the
decision to perform sampling and laboratory studies is taken. Examples of the financial impact
of errors in fluid-property measurements are given elsewhere.1 Fluid samples are thus required
to enable advanced physical and chemical analyses to be carried out in specialized laboratories.
Samples  must  be  collected  from  a  wide  range  of  locations,  including  separators,  pipelines,
tanks, wellbores, and the formation itself. This chapter primarily targets the sampling of fluids
under pressures above atmospheric, where numerous tools and procedures have been developed
that are essentially specific to the petroleum industry. Best practices are proposed for fluid sam-
pling, reporting of data, and quality control of samples.

Reservoir-fluid-property  measurements  derive  from  a  complicated  series  of  processes  rely-
ing both on the operation of equipment and the performance of people, so the scope for errors
is very significant. The overriding challenge in fluid sampling is that of ensuring that the fluid
entering  the  sample  container  is  representative  of  the  bulk  fluid  being  sampled.  It  is  equally
important that the sample remains representative during handling and storage, until all required
measurements have been completed. Although thorough sample-checking procedures can identi-
fy  some  of  the  most  obvious  problems,  there  is  never  absolute  certainty  that  the  fluid  under

study  is  truly  representative  of  the  reservoir  fluid.  On  occasion,  laboratory  measurements  can
show that a fluid is definitely not representative (e.g., saturation pressure is significantly higher
than reservoir pressure), but even here the problem could lie with errors in field measurement
data rather than with the samples themselves. Thus, it is essential that all the necessary precau-
tions are taken to prevent poor samples from leading to erroneous physical-property measure-
ments.

Fig. 4.1 is a schematic diagram illustrating some of the most common sources of error in
relation to the collection of production samples and data in the field. Perhaps the most impor-
tant,  yet  often  misunderstood,  phase  of  any  sampling  program  is  that  of  well  conditioning.  A
poorly conditioned well may still be producing drilling-mud filtrate, workover fluids, or reac-
tion products and, in extreme cases, such materials may remain even after months of produc-
tion. A conflicting aim of well conditioning is to avoid excessive pressure drawdown and the
creation of a large region of two-phase reservoir fluid around the wellbore, which may be diffi-
cult to remove. This is especially important in the case of gas/condensate reservoirs, of which
many are found at their saturation pressures. The sampling program must ensure that appropri-
ate procedures are used to ensure that samples are taken under the best conditions.

Measurements of reactive or nonhydrocarbon components of reservoir fluids are complicat-
ed by the potential for loss through reaction or adsorption in contact with the production tubing
or with sample-bottle walls, especially during long storage periods. On-site measurements can
be very important if performed and recorded properly.

The schematic in Fig. 4.1 emphasizes sampling activities in cased-hole wells, but pressur-
ized samples are also obtained with formation-test tools in openhole wells. Here, contamination
by mud filtrate or excessive pressure decrease (drawdown) during sampling means that it may
not be possible to obtain quality PVT samples. Contamination by oil-based mud (OBM) is es-
pecially  problematic.2  Sampling  from  tanks  or  pipelines  also  requires  that  care  be  taken  to
ensure that the fluid is representative of the location or condition required to be studied.

Not only may errors in the field mean that samples are not fully representative of the reser-
voir fluid, but even good fluid samples may be studied under invalid conditions. Pressure and
temperature errors can influence measurements and their interpretation, but it is especially er-
rors in gas/oil ratio (GOR) that can have a major influence on a PVT study. Even basic data,
such as sampling date and time, if not recorded or erroneous, can reduce the value of samples,
even to the point of making measurements meaningless.

4.2 General Guidelines for Setting Up a Sampling Program
The specific requirements for samples and laboratory studies naturally will depend on the state
of knowledge about a prospect. Thus, it may be advisable to perform extensive sampling and a
complete  suite  of  laboratory  measurements  on  a  wildcat  well  when  nothing  is  previously
known about the reservoir; this may provide the only fluid data on which to base future explo-
ration  work.  However,  the  early  wells  in  a  field  may  not  provide  the  best  samples  because
drilling and workover practices will not have been optimized, and the wells’ response to testing
programs may require changes that are detrimental to fluid sampling. It may then be necessary
to repeat some analyses during the appraisal stage, typically when wells will yield samples that
are  more  representative  of  likely  production.  In  contrast,  sampling  late  in  the  appraisal  phase
may be needed only on occasions when surface measurements indicate unexpected fluid character.
The composition of subsurface water commonly changes laterally, as well as with depth, in
the same aquifer. Changes may be brought about by the intrusion of other waters and by dis-
charge from and recharge to the aquifer. It is thus difficult to obtain a representative sample of
a  given  subsurface  body  of  water.  Any  one  sample  is  a  very  small  part  of  the  total  mass,
which may vary widely in composition. Therefore, it is generally necessary to obtain and ana-
lyze many samples. Also, the samples may change with time as gases come out of solution and

supersaturated solutions produce precipitates. Sampling sites should be selected, if possible, to
fit into a comprehensive network to cover an oil-productive geologic basin. There is a tendency

Chapter 4—Fluid Sampling

I-177

for some oilfield waters to become more diluted as the oil reservoir is produced. Such dilution
may result from the movement of water from adjacent compacting clay beds into the petroleum
reservoir as pressure declines with the continued removal of oil and brine. The composition of
oilfield water varies with the position within the geologic structure from which it is obtained.
In  some  cases,  the  salinity  will  increase  up-structure  to  a  maximum  at  the  point  of  oil/water
contact.

The  first  priority  in  developing  a  sampling  program,  whether  extensive  or  limited,  is  to
establish exactly what measurements are required. Table 4.1 gives a wide range of the measure-
ments  that  are  typically  considered  for  exploration  wells.  This  can  be  used  as  a  checklist,
together with direct contacts with users in other functions, to identify specific requirements for
sampling and on-site measurements. Generally, it is advisable to plan to perform all applicable
measurements  unless  sufficient  information  is  already  available  from  earlier  tests  of  other
wells.  The  fact  that  a  measurement  proves  to  be  “normal,”  or  an  unwanted  component  is  not
detected, should not be regarded as a waste of resources because it can still provide essential
information, especially if data are different on other wells or changes are identified during pro-
duction. On-site measurements are recommended for all reactive components because concentra-
tions  may  change  with  time  (e.g.,  during  a  well  test),  and  losses  frequently  occur  during

I-178

sample  transport  and  storage.  Table  4.1  is  not  a  comprehensive  list,  and  other  measurements
will be required in certain locations and for specific purposes.

Having decided which fluid measurements are required, it is necessary to set up a suitable
sampling program, taking into account the cost of the work, the quality and quantity of sam-
ples and subsequent measurements, the urgency with which data are required, and the applica-
tion of safe practices. The program should specify who has overall responsibility if a change is
required in the program, as often occurs. Sampling programs should not be developed in isola-
tion from the other objectives of a well test because there is direct conflict in some cases, such
as when the well test requires large drawdowns for gas/condensate fluids as part of flow-capac-
ity  tests.  Thus,  in  the  case  of  a  well  test,  the  overall  plan  should  include  the  following:  (a)
establish  the  production  potential,  (b)  determine  the  permeability,  (c)  determine  the  skin,  and
(d) collect fluid samples. Each objective should be defined in sufficient detail so that all parties
involved  are  fully  aware  of  their  obligations,  thus  increasing  the  likelihood  of  achieving  the
objective. Objectives must be realistic and must allow for possible changes. In the case of fluid
sampling and on-site analyses, the following sorts of questions should be considered in decid-
ing  the  detailed  sampling  objectives:  (1)  How  much  information  is  available  on  the  likely
reservoir fluid? (2) What types of fluid sampling will be best? (3) What is the most suitable well-
cleanup  and  -conditioning  procedure,  and  how  can  this  be  integrated  with  other  well-test
objectives? (4) How many samples are needed, and do partners need duplicates? (5) When is
the  ideal  time  to  take  samples?  (6)  Will  on-site  analyses  be  required?  (7)  Who  will  perform
sampling and analysis duties?

Fluid-sampling operations are often left to service-company personnel, but because signifi-
cant variation in levels of competence exists within the industry and within service companies
themselves, it is recommended either to use specialist laboratory personnel or to supervise the
service-company operations closely.

General guidelines for choosing reservoir-fluid-sampling methods and sample quantities re-
quired are summarized in Table 4.2. Regardless of the actual volumes mentioned, you should
collect at least two separate samples of each fluid, referred to as duplicate or replicate samples.
This  reduces  the  chance  of  losing  information  if  one  of  the  samples  leaks  or  is  accidentally
damaged during laboratory operations, and it allows a comparison between the samples as part
of the quality-control procedures.

Surface-separator  sampling  is  the  most  common  technique,  but  the  reservoir-fluid  sample
recombined in the laboratory is subject to errors in the measured GOR and any imprecision in
the  laboratory  recombination  procedure.  Downhole  samples  (or  wellhead  samples)  are  not  af-
fected by such inaccuracies but require the fluid to be in monophasic condition when sampled;
this can be confirmed definitively only afterward in the laboratory. Also, there is general reluc-
tance  to  attempt  downhole  sampling  in  gas/condensate  reservoirs  because  many  are  saturated,
and the phases are likely to segregate in the wellbore. The ideal situation for a laboratory is to
receive both surface and downhole samples because a choice is then available, and a good idea
can be obtained of how representative the resulting fluid is.

In  certain  circumstances,  it  can  be  good  practice  to  collect  “backup”  fluid  samples  at  the
earliest opportunity during a production test, even if a well has not cleaned up properly. If the
test  has  to  be  aborted  for  some  reason  [well  bridging,  unexpected  levels  of  hydrogen  sulfide
(H2S), etc.], the backup samples may be of great value, even if they are not 100% representa-
tive.  If  the  test  is  completed  successfully,  the  backup  samples  can  be  discarded  to  avoid  the
cost of unnecessary shipment and testing.

If sampling is part of a long-term monitoring program, such as those required by govern-
ment authorities or those forming part of custody-transfer contracts, the methods defined in the
appropriate  documentation  or  contracts  must  be  followed  as  closely  as  possible,  even  if  this
constitutes  differences  with  the  procedures  or  recommendations  in  this  text  or  in  the  industry

standards cited here. Full use of this text and appropriate industry standards should, of course,
be made in setting up new procedures and contracts that require long-term sampling and mea-
surement programs.

In some cases, fluid sampling may be made on short notice in response to a problem, with
the  intention  of  identifying  the  cause  and  preventing  any  recurrence.  Here,  it  is  essential  to
record all the operating conditions and any changes that may have contributed to the problem.

If there is concern about whether the fluid is homogeneous in a flow line or tank, the best
approach is to take samples from different locations and compare them. In a liquid flow line,
take samples from the top and bottom; in a tank, take samples at different depths. If samples
are indeed different, it is advisable to locate a better sampling point (e.g., where there is suffi-
cient  turbulence  to  homogenize  the  fluid).  Failing  this,  the  only  solution  may  be  to  mix  the
samples together in an attempt to provide a representative average fluid. If, however, the pur-
pose  of  the  sampling  is  to  study  the  nonhomogeneity,  then  separate  samples  should  be  taken
accordingly.

When samples are collected from drillstem tests (DSTs), which do not involve surface pro-
duction, the limited volume of fluid produced from the reservoir may be insufficient to remove
mud filtrate or other contaminated or changed fluid. Thus, even samples collected from the last
fluid  that  enters  the  drillstem  may  not  be  truly  representative.  This  is  especially  the  case  for
formation-water samples, which are more widely susceptible to contamination from drilling flu-
ids,  well-completion  fluids,  cements,  tracing  fluids,  and  acids,  which  contain  many  different
chemicals.  The  most  representative  formation-water  samples  are  usually  those  obtained  after
the oil well has produced for a period of time and all extraneous fluids adjacent to the well-
bore have been flushed out.

Also, it can be useful to collect a reference sample when operation is normal, if this is possible
(e.g., a sporadic problem or a similar installation not affected), to allow comparisons. Laborato-
ry  personnel  also  should  be  contacted  regarding  the  sample  needs  and  the  types  of  analyses
that could be performed.

4.3 Reservoir-Fluid Type
One of the principal variables in reservoir-fluid sampling is the type of reservoir fluid present.
This is rarely known with certainty and, in exploration wells, may be completely unknown at
the start of testing. Determining the exact nature of a reservoir fluid is, of course, a key objec-
tive of sampling and laboratory study. Fig. 4.2 shows the relation between the major classes of
hydrocarbon reservoir fluid in terms of a generalized phase diagram. Although the shape of the
phase diagram is specific to the actual fluid composition, it is the reservoir temperature com-
pared to the temperature Tc of the critical point (Tc determines if the fluid is an oil or a gas).
When the reservoir temperature is lower than Tc, the fluid is an oil and will exhibit a bubble-
point when pressure is reduced into the two-phase region. If the reservoir-fluid temperature is
above  Tc,  the  fluid  is  a  gas  and  will  either  show  gas/condensate  behavior  and  a  dewpoint  on
pressure reduction or, if the reservoir temperature is also above the cricondentherm Tt, the fluid
will behave as a one-phase gas with no liquid formation in the reservoir on pressure reduction.
If  the  fluid  exists  in  the  reservoir  at  or  close  to  its  critical  temperature,  it  is  classified  as  a
critical or near-critical fluid. These fluids exhibit neither bubblepoint nor dewpoint, but on pres-
sure  reduction  into  the  two-phase  region,  they  immediately  form  a  system  comprising  large
proportions of both gas and liquid (e.g., 60% gas and 40% liquid by volume).

The  reservoir  pressure  determines  whether  the  fluid  is  at  the  boundary  of  the  two-phase
region  (and  referred  to  as  saturated)  or  at  a  higher  pressure  than  the  two-phase  region  (and
referred  to  as  undersaturated).  Saturated  fluids  will  immediately  enter  the  two-phase  region
when a well produces fluid because of the reduction of pressure in the well and near-wellbore
region. More details on phase diagrams are available in the General Engineering section of this
Handbook.

Both  the  reservoir-fluid  type  and  the  saturation  condition  influence  the  way  fluid  samples
must be collected, yet this information can be estimated only at the time of the sampling pro-

gram and is especially uncertain when fluids are close to the boundaries between the different
types.  Numerous  correlations  are  available  for  estimating  reservoir-fluid  type  and  condition
from  produced-fluid  flow  rates  and  properties  measured  at  the  wellsite  (such  as  those  devel-
oped by Standing3 and those given elsewhere in this Handbook), but you should be careful in
using these methods, especially when the fluid properties differ significantly from those used to
develop the correlation. For this reason, it is good practice to allow for significant error in the
reservoir-fluid character when designing and implementing sampling programs.

4.4 Well Conditioning
The best way to prepare a well for sampling is dependent on the reservoir-fluid type, as indicat-
ed earlier. With the exception of one-phase gas reservoirs, prolonged production will cause all
reservoirs to reach saturation conditions, thus bringing about changes in the fluid composition
throughout  the  reservoir.  When  this  happens,  there  is  no  longer  any  possibility  of  obtaining
truly representative fluid samples. Thus, although in one-phase gas reservoirs (and for a certain
length  of  time  in  undersaturated  reservoirs),  the  fluid  will  remain  unchanged  during  pressure
depletion—the true nature of the fluid will be unknown until samples actually have been ana-
lyzed in a laboratory—it is strongly recommended to take samples at the earliest opportunity in
the life of a well.

Both  in  openhole  and  in  cased-hole  completions,  the  best  depth  or  production  interval  for
sampling will be as far away as possible from gas/oil, gas/water, and oil/water transition zones
to reduce the chances of coning. Every attempt should be made to test zones individually be-
cause  commingled  production  may  be  difficult  to  detect  and  is  impossible  to  correct  in  the
laboratory.

The possible influence of any matrix-treatment chemicals on sampling programs should be
evaluated, and treatment schedules should be modified accordingly. Problems such as the liber-
ation  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  or  H2S  after  acid  treatments  are  possible,  as  is  the  release  of
other components such as metal ions, and these could affect analyses. On the other hand, sam-
pling  after  an  acid  treatment  has  been  properly  cleaned  up  has  the  probable  advantage  of
reduced drawdown in the near-wellbore region.

Because  of  the  enormous  variety  of  constraints,  there  can  be  no  definitive  guidelines  for
well  conditioning.  The  first  phase  of  conditioning  involves  the  cleanup,  in  which  the  well  is
flowed to the surface to remove any solids resulting from perforating activities, drilling mud or
completion fluids in the well, and mud filtrate or workover fluids that may remain in the forma-
tion near the wellbore. Here, the production rate must provide a sufficient flow velocity in the
production string to lift solids, hydrocarbon liquids, and water to the surface, but conditioning
is typically performed at the maximum rate, as this reduces the total length of the cleanup period.
The cleanup period typically lasts from a few hours to 24 hours, and progress is monitored
by regular measurements of flowing wellhead pressure, basic sediment and water (BS&W), and
other  parameters.  At  the  end  of  the  cleanup  period,  production  may  be  diverted  through  the
separator to check its operation. This is an ideal moment to take backup samples.

Depending  on  the  fluid  type,  significant  differences  can  exist  in  conditioning  procedures,
which  attempt  to  control  or  eliminate  any  modified  reservoir  fluid  so  that  fluid  entering  the
well is identical to that in the reservoir. For an unknown fluid, one of the most important con-
siderations  is  the  need  to  interpret  the  response  of  the  well  to  different  flow  conditions  and
then develop the final sampling program during the test itself on the basis of this information.
If  initial  production  indicates  an  oil,  the  best  approach  is  to  evaluate  the  response  of  surface
GOR  to  changes  in  production  rate.  As  long  as  representative  reservoir  fluid  enters  the  well-
bore and is carried to the surface, and the same separator operating conditions of temperature
and pressure are maintained, the GOR should remain stable for different choke sizes. A GOR
that changes significantly between choke sizes is indicative of nonrepresentative production ei-
ther caused by two-phase flow effects in the near-wellbore region or possibly by commingled

I-182

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

production of more than one reservoir fluid (e.g., oil zone and gas cap), and production should
be choked back until GOR no longer changes with choke size.

If, however the reservoir contains a saturated gas condensate, extra flow periods will sim-
ply  compound  the  condensate-buildup  problem,  so  sampling  at  the  earliest  stable  rate  is
probably  advisable.  In  fact,  some  modeling  work4  has  shown  that  when  an  important  ring  or
bank of condensate has built up in the reservoir, it may be possible to produce at reasonably
high rates with an apparently stable GOR while producing fluid that is not representative of the
original reservoir fluid. At very high flow rates, the GOR may appear to increase as a result of
liquid carry-over in the separator gas stream.

Gas  wells  that  have  a  small  flow  velocity  will  exhibit  liquid  “slippage”  in  the  tubing  and
heading or unstable flow rates at the surface. Several methods of establishing the required min-
imum flow rate are available, of which an industry nomogram5 has been used extensively. In
very-low-permeability, saturated gas/condensate reservoirs, it may not be possible to lift conden-
sate  from  the  well  without  creating  a  major  pressure  drawdown  in  the  reservoir  and  causing
nonrepresentative fluid to enter the wellbore. The best approach here is to select a small tubing
diameter before the test so that the minimum lift velocity can be achieved with a low flow rate
and, thus, reduced drawdown.

In highly undersaturated reservoirs, it is possible to take downhole samples while the reser-
voir  is  producing,  provided  that  the  downhole  flowing  pressure  is  greater  than  the  fluid
saturation pressure. In many cases, however, the saturation pressure will be unknown or cannot
be estimated with sufficient accuracy; then, the best recommendation for downhole sampling in
an  oil  reservoir  is  to  sample  when  shut  in,  as  for  reservoirs  that  are  at  or  close  to  saturation
pressure. Before downhole sampling with the well shut in, it is necessary to allow pressure to
build  up  near  to  static  and  then  to  purge  fresh  reservoir  fluid  at  a  low  rate  to  replace  any
“changed” fluid in the wellbore or in the near-wellbore region. The most suitable time for down-
hole  sampling  during  the  well  test  is  probably  after  the  initial  cleanup  and  buildup,  but  an
alternative is at the very end of the test if a long buildup is part of the test plan.

On a different aspect of well conditioning, the use of OBM during drilling operations can
lead  to  contamination  of  the  near-wellbore  region,  and  any  subsequent  contamination  of  fluid
samples  by  base  oil  may  not  be  identified.  This  is  unlikely  to  pose  a  problem  if  the  well  is
properly cleaned up, but it can result in significant contamination if samples are collected using
an  openhole  formation  tester  in  which  only  small  volumes  are  purged.  It  is  thus  best  if  lost
circulation can be minimized during drilling and ideal if only water-based muds are used.

If surface-separator sampling is planned, another form of conditioning can be necessary if
chemicals are in use. Injection of methanol or glycol upstream of the separator can be used to
prevent gas-hydrate formation, and the injection of antifoaming agents and demulsifiers may be
required in oil reservoir fluids. If possible, any such injection should be stopped before separa-
tor  samples  are  taken,  and  enough  time  should  be  allowed  for  such  potential  contaminants  to
be purged from the separator (e.g., by waiting at least five times the residence time). Residence
times can be derived from the nomogram given in the chapter on Design of Two- and Three-
Phase Separators in the Facilities and Construction Engineering section of this Handbook.

Separator  conditions  themselves  also  have  an  influence  on  sampling  operations.  Separator
temperature can be controlled only by changing the production rate or by the use of a heater,
but there is generally more flexibility in the separator pressure, which can be set at any value
not  exceeding  the  choke  downstream  pressure  limit  for  critical  flow  (or  the  working  pressure
of the separator, if it is lower). The advantages of using the highest-acceptable separator pres-
sure include more intermediate components being in the liquid (increasing the liquid flow rate
somewhat), more gas in sample bottles because of the increased pressure, and generally a lean-
er gas stream with less condensation on cooling. Although service companies may be reluctant
to operate separators at higher pressures, these benefits can be important for the quality of fluid

Chapter 4—Fluid Sampling

measurements.  For  low-GOR  oil  production,  a  lower  separator  pressure  may  be  advisable  be-
cause  it  can  significantly  increase  the  gas  flow  rate  and  improve  its  measurement  accuracy.
Separator liquid levels also can be adjusted in many separators; lower levels increase gas resi-
dence  time  and  thus  can  reduce  carry-over  problems  for  gas  wells,  whereas  higher  levels
increase oil residence time, which can reduce emulsion or foaming problems.

In view of the concerns presented above, the current best practices for conditioning a well
for  sampling  should  include  the  following  steps.  Complementary  details  of  guidelines  can  be
found elsewhere.1,6

For oil reservoirs:
• Clean up the well until wellhead pressure and BS&W stabilize.
• For  surface  sampling,  reduce  the  flow  rate  in  steps  until  the  separator  GOR  does  not

change between choke sizes, then stabilize separator conditions and take separator samples.

• For downhole sampling, shut in the well and build up to static pressure; produce at a low
rate  for  long  enough  to  remove  all  changed  material  in  the  near-wellbore  region,  and  briefly
shut in.

• Finally, purge fluid past the sampler in the well at a bleed rate and shut in before sam-

pling (this step may be omitted if downhole fluid is known to be monophasic).

• For gas/condensate reservoirs:
• Clean up the well until wellhead pressure and BS&W stabilize, then flow the well at the

lowest flow rate that will lift liquids up the tubing.

• For surface sampling, stabilize separator conditions and take separator samples.
• For  downhole  sampling  (undersaturated  reservoir  with  monophasic  flow  downhole),  col-

lect downhole samples.

Recommendations for well conditioning in a near-critical-fluid reservoir are not widely avail-
able,  both  because  these  reservoirs  are  fairly  rare  and  because  there  is  no  sure  way  of
identifying the situation from surface measurements. A rule of thumb is that reservoirs with near-
critical  fluids  often  exhibit  separator  GORs  in  the  region  of  4,000  scf/bbl  (700  m3/m3),  but
there  are  no  well-established  GOR  ranges  for  the  near-critical  region,  and  correlations  are
rarely  applicable  in  this  area.  Because  pressure  drawdown  can  result  in  major  changes  in  the
reservoir fluid, it is advisable to perform sampling at the earliest moment (a good practice for
all reservoir types) and to condition the well by flowing it at successively slower rates to re-
move all nonrepresentative hydrocarbon phases as far as possible. However, it may be difficult
to  establish  when  the  well  is  adequately  conditioned  because  the  surface  GOR  may  change
only slightly with different quantities of downhole phases, and expert advice should be sought
to evaluate all the observations.

4.5 Selection and Preparation of Sampling Equipment
Equipment  planning  must  start  as  soon  as  the  sampling  program  is  defined  to  ensure  that  all
necessary equipment will be available and checked well in advance of the sampling operation.
For  pressurized  sampling  operations,  metal  cylinders  are  invariably  used,  almost  always  with
valves at each end that facilitate filling, transfer, and cleaning operations. For downhole sam-
ples and separator liquid samples, the sampling procedure requires maintaining pressure on the
sample while the sample cylinder is filled. Achieving this by draining mercury from a full cylin-
der7  has  been  largely  discontinued  owing  to  the  safety  and  environmental  concerns  with
mercury. The industry is now using piston cylinders, which have an internal piston to separate
the  sample  part  of  the  chamber  from  the  hydraulic  fluid  (commonly  a  mixture  of  water  and
ethylene  glycol).  Maintenance  of  the  piston  cylinders  is  more  complicated  because  the  piston
seals must be in excellent condition to prevent the occurrence of internal leaks.

Cylinders are commonly made from stainless steel or titanium, the latter being significantly
lighter  and  offering  better  resistance  to  H2S  (while  being  incompatible  with  mercury).  Alu-
minum cylinders are in common use because larger volumes of sample are generally required,

I-184

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

and  the  cylinder  weight  is  a  concern.  Cylinders  with  internal  coatings,  such  as  Teflon®*,  are
also  used  occasionally.  The  wide  variety  of  materials  used  for  pressurized  sampling  demon-
strates  the  fact  that  there  is  no  perfect  solution  to  the  problems  of  resistance  to  corrosion,
sample  preservation,  volume,  and  weight.  All  cylinders  must  be  provided  with  plugs  for  the
valves, endcaps to protect the valves, and storage containers to facilitate handling and to pro-
tect cylinders during transport. It is good practice to plug and label cylinders when they have
been prepared for sampling to avoid any confusion when at the job site.

For atmospheric samples, containers that are used for water samples include polyethylene,
other  plastics, hard  rubber,  metal cans,  and  borosilicate glass,  but  the  choice should  be  based
on  the  measurements  that  will  be  performed  on  the  samples.  For  stock-tank  hydrocarbon  liq-
uids,  glass  or  plastic  containers  are  more  resistant  to  corrosive  components  and  are  generally
preferred for smaller volumes. Although plastic containers are more robust, they can contami-
nate  samples  with  plasticizers,  and  glass  bottles  must  be  used  for  storing  stock-tank  samples
intended for geochemical analysis. Glass containers must be well protected against the risk of
breakage.

For  water  samples,  glass  will  adsorb  various  ions  such  as  iron  and  manganese  and  may
contribute boron or silica to the aqueous sample, so its use should be avoided if ionic analyses
are required. Plastic and hard rubber containers are not suitable if the sample is to be analyzed
to  determine  its  organic  content,  and  a  metal  container  is  often  used  if  the  sample  is  to  be
analyzed for dissolved hydrocarbons such as benzene. Otherwise, a polyethylene bottle is prob-
ably  the  most  satisfactory  container,  especially  if  the  sample  is  to  be  stored  for  some  time
before analysis. Also, a plastic container is less likely to break than is glass if a water sample
is transported in freezing temperatures. However, not all polyethylenes are acceptable because
some  contain  relatively  high  amounts  of  metal  contributed  by  catalysts  in  their  manufacture.
The approximate metal content of the plastic can be determined by a qualitative emission spec-
trographic technique.

In addition to sample containers, sampling equipment must include fittings, valves, gauges,
and lines to enable samples to be recovered safely from the required location. Trained person-
nel must be assigned to collect samples. They should have copies of the sampling program and
field  procedures,  the  prepared  forms  for  recording  data,  and  a  supply  of  labels.  All  sampling
equipment  must  have  been  previously  pressure  tested  and  be  clean  and  dry.  Downhole-sam-
pling equipment such as production samplers and formation-test samplers are extremely sophis-
ticated  and  must  be  prepared  by  specialists.  Great  care  must  be  taken  with  maintenance,
cleaning, and assembly to ensure the maximum chance of correct operation and the minimum
chance of contamination or other nonrepresentative sampling.

4.6 Pressurized Hydrocarbon Fluid-Sampling Procedures
The  procedures  covered  here  apply  to  reservoir  fluids  or  production  streams  above  ambient
pressure, and they are highly specific to the petroleum industry. The American Petroleum Inst.
publishes a detailed recommended practice,6 which is the most complete industry standard cov-
ering  the  sampling  of  pressurized  hydrocarbon  fluids.  It  should  be  consulted  for  additional
information  to  that  presented  here.  The  choice  of  sampling  method  depends  on  the  reservoir-
fluid  type;  this  has  been  explained  in  the  guidelines  mentioned  above.  Here,  the  various
methods have been subdivided into downhole- or surface-sampling methods. The former obvi-
ously apply to a specific well, whereas the latter can be used for wells, gathering stations, or
other surface facilities.

Although here, “hydrocarbon” is intended to mean fluids containing hydrocarbons and non-
hydrocarbons but no (or only small) quantities of water, techniques in this section also can be
applied to the sampling of pressurized water fluids, though this is not very common.

4.6.1 Production Downhole Sampling.  Production downhole sampling, also referred to as bot-
tomhole sampling, involves running a special sampling tool into the well on wireline so that a
sample of the fluid in the well can be collected under the increased pressure of the fluid col-
umn. Careful well conditioning is necessary, as described earlier, to ensure that the fluid is in
monophasic condition. Modern samplers are triggered either by a timer or a mechanical clock
in the tool itself, or by an electric signal conveyed by electric line. The former system is more
common, being able to be run with any wireline unit, but it has the inconvenience of needing a
preset delay to allow the tool and well to be set up for sampling. The sampler should be low-
ered  into  the  well  until  it  is  a  short  distance  above  the  upper  limit  of  the  perforated  interval
(unless there are mechanical limitations that prevent the tool from reaching this depth) to col-
lect a sample that is representative of all the produced intervals. Various drillstem and tubing-
conveyed  installations  are  available  for  downhole  samplers,  which  allow  them  to  be  operated
without  the  use  of  wireline.  These  can  allow  samples  to  be  collected  downhole  in  high-risk
wells in which wireline operations are not permitted.

One advantage of downhole sampling is that it can be performed without a separator at the
well.  There  are  several  problems  that  can  occur  in  downhole  sampling:  the  fluid  around  the
sampler may be in two-phase condition, or it may have segregated in the wellbore; a mechani-
cal problem can lead to incorrect opening or closing of the device; the fluid may be contaminat-
ed  with  water  or  drilling  mud;  or  the  sample  may  not  be  made  fully  homogeneous  before
transfer  into  a  shipping  bottle.  Use  of  a  pressure  survey  may  help  check  the  whereabouts  of
any interfaces in the wellbore, but lack of an interface does not guarantee that the fluid present
has not lost any material in the form of condensation or wax or asphaltene precipitation.

It is common practice for downhole samples to be transferred at the wellsite, as this allows
a measure of the quality of the sample to be obtained, and can allow additional sampling runs
to be made in most cases (if needed) while still at the wellsite. This approach also can reduce
rental charges for the downhole samplers if supplied by a service company. Because it is diffi-
cult either to transfer the entire downhole sample (such that it need not be homogeneous) or to
make it fully homogeneous (and just transfer a portion), the best practice is to try to achieve
both objectives. Samplers with moving metal parts to facilitate mixing are now fairly common
and  are  preferred.  General  recommendations  to  be  followed  for  downhole  sampling  are  given
in Table 4.3.

Downhole  samples  are  commonly  transferred  to  shipping  bottles  at  the  wellsite,  and  the
following  subsection  describes  a  method  suitable  for  most  production  downhole  samples  and
many  formation-test  samples.  This  step-by-step  method  is  reproduced  from  RP  44  (where  it
appears  as  Section  6.2.5)6  by  kind  permission  of  the  American  Petroleum  Inst.  (API).  It  may
need to be modified according to the actual type of transfer equipment available.

API RP 44 Method for Sample Transfer to Shipping Container.  If the sampler itself is not
used  to  transport  the  sample  to  the  laboratory,  the  sample  must  be  transferred  to  a  transfer
container for shipping or transport. Whatever vessel is used, it must have an adequate pressure
rating and be certified to meet all applicable shipping regulations. Further, the shipping cylin-
ders  must  be  cleaned  thoroughly;  this  is  particularly  important  to  avoid  contamination  of  the
sample from trace amounts of heavy components remaining in the cylinder from previous use.
The primary concern in transferring a downhole sample to a shipping container is to main-
tain the integrity of the sample during the transfer operation. This requires that the fluid in the
sampler be maintained in a single-phase condition during the entire sample-transfer process or,
if the fluid is in a two-phase condition, that the entire contents of the sampler be transferred.
(The sampler should be heated if wax or asphaltenes are present.) If only a portion of a two-

I-186

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

phase sample is transferred, the fluid transferred to the shipping container will differ from the
original sample because the two phases in the sampler almost certainly cannot be transferred in
the proportions that exist in the sampler. Because valid transfer is crucial to sample quality, the
preferred procedure is to maintain the fluid in a single-phase state and transfer it in its entirety.
An important consideration is that pressurizing the sample may produce a single-phase condi-
tion  but  may  not  homogenize  the  sample;  thus,  thorough  agitation  (by  rocking  the  cylinder)
during the process is important.

In  addition,  the  sample  composition  must  not  be  altered  either  by  (a)  leaks  of  hydraulic
fluid  across  the  piston  of  piston-type  samplers  or  (b)  by  selective  absorption  of  components
from the sample into a transfer fluid (e.g., water or glycol) in cases in which the transfer fluid
is  in  direct  contact  with  the  sample.  The  latter  is  a  particular  problem  in  samples  containing
CO2 or H2S, which are very soluble in the transfer fluid.

At  all  stages  of  the  transfer  process,  the  pressure  must  be  maintained  substantially  higher
than the sample saturation pressure. Fig. 4.3 shows a schematic diagram of a transfer apparatus
for piston-type samplers and transport containers. The 1966 Edition 1 of API RP 447 should be
consulted  for  transfer  apparatus  involving  direct  contact  between  the  sample  and  mercury  (as
the hydraulic fluid).

the sample side of the transfer container.

The transfer procedure is as follows.
1. Use the pump to fill all lines between valves B and F with hydraulic fluid (refer to Fig.
4.3).  This  can  be  done  by  loosening  the  fittings  at  these  valves  and  pumping  until  hydraulic
fluid  appears,  then  tightening  each  fitting.  Note:  Valves  A  and  B  and  F,  G,  and  H  may  be
integral parts of the sampler and transfer container, respectively, depending on the design of
these vessels. Also, valve H and its line may be arranged somewhat differently from Fig. 4.3 so
that valve H simply “tees” into the line from valve A to valve G.

2. With valves A, D, E, and F closed and valve C open, slightly open valve B and note the
opening pressure of the sampler. Valve B is often hydraulically or spring-actuated in cases in
which  it  is  part  of  the  sampler;  if  so,  use  the  pump  to  raise  the  pressure  until  valve  B  just
opens, and record the opening pressure.

3. Open valve G and evacuate through valve H the line between valves G and A, including

Chapter 4—Fluid Sampling

I-187

Fig. 4.3—Diagram of sample transfer apparatus.

4. Close valve H.
5. Open valve F and use the pump to bring the hydraulic oil pressure in both the sampler

and the shipping container to a pressure well above the saturation pressure of the sample.

6. Slightly  open  valve  A  and  fill  the  line  between  that  valve  and  the  upper  face  of  the
piston in the shipping container with sample fluid, using the pump to keep the pressure on the
gauge well above the saturation pressure during this transfer process.

7. Close valve C, then slightly open valve D, allowing hydraulic fluid to drain slowly into
the  hydraulic  oil  reservoir  (open  to  atmospheric  pressure)  as  fluid  flows  from  the  sampler  to
the shipping container. Use the calibrated pump to (a) keep the pressure in the sampler above
the  saturation  pressure  and  to  (b)  keep  track  of  the  amount  of  sample  transferred.  When  the
desired amount of sample has been transferred, close valve D, then close valves A and G.

8. Before the transferred sample can be shipped, a vapor space must be created in the ship-
ping  container.  To  do  this,  slightly  open  valve  E  and  allow  hydraulic  oil  to  drain  from  the
shipping container into an open calibrated receiver. Close valve E, then valve F, when the vol-
ume  of  hydraulic  fluid  in  the  receiver  equals  10%  of  the  volume  of  the  shipping  container.
This will result in a 10% vapor space (“ullage” or “outage”) in the shipping container. Such a
void  volume  is  required  for  safety  because  very  high  pressures  can  result  if  the  temperature
increases  even  slightly  in  a  totally  liquid-filled,  closed  vessel.  Note:  Special  sample  cylinders
with  an  auxiliary  gas  cap  are  available  for  samples  that  must  be  retained  in  single-phase
(monophasic) condition.

9. Close valve B if it is not self-sealing. Open valve C, then valve D, to relieve pressure in
the  pump.  At  this  point,  the  sampler  and  shipping  (transfer)  vessel  can  be  disconnected  from
the transfer apparatus.

4.6.2 Downhole Sampling With Formation Testers.  The collection of reservoir-fluid samples
by formation-test tools was originally a secondary benefit of their use for the measurement of
pore pressures. Formation-test tools can obtain reservoir-fluid samples without any production
to the surface. The tool is typically run into an openhole well containing drilling mud or com-
pletion fluid to a specific depth, and a probe is forced against the formation, providing a seal
and allowing formation fluid to flow into the tool. Modern formation testers generally can be
equipped  with  numerous  devices  designed  specifically  to  enable  samples  of  reservoir  fluid  to
be collected in a series of sample chambers. These tools offer the advantage of the ability to
collect samples without performing a DST with fluid flow to the surface, and they are especial-
ly  useful  in  obtaining  fluids  from  a  number  of  discrete  depths,  thus  helping  identify  possible
fluid gradients. However, the principal disadvantage is the limited cleanup that is possible, re-
sulting  in  various  levels  of  contamination  by  drilling-mud  filtrate.  These  problems  have  been

I-188

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

reduced  by  developments  allowing  the  pumping  of  significant  volumes  of  fluid  into  the  well
and the monitoring of the quality of the fluid flowing into the tool. Nevertheless, samples col-
lected  almost  always  contain  some  contamination  (both  from  mud  filtrate  and  from  small
quantities  of  water  used  to  fill  connecting  lines  when  the  tool  is  prepared),  but  when  the
drilling mud is water-based, such contamination can be separated in the laboratory, and it is a
significant  concern  only  when  sampled  fluids  contain  soluble  components  such  as  H2S  and
CO2. When sampling in wells that have been drilled with OBM, contamination is more diffi-
cult to detect and impossible to remove physically. Advanced spectroscopic detection systems
have been developed for formation-test tools, but the industry is now beginning to accept that
there  always  will  be  problems  with  formation-test  sample  contamination  where  OBMs  have
been used, and laboratories have developed various methods for evaluating the level of contam-
ination  and  for  estimating  the  true  physical  properties  of  uncontaminated  reservoir  fluid.8  In
fact,  this  problem  is  not  limited  to  formation-test  samples  because  in  some  cases,  production
testing  may  not  fully  clean  up  OBM  filtrate,  especially  if  there  have  been  significant  losses
during drilling.

Formation-test tools are extremely sophisticated and must be run by specially trained engi-
neers and wireline operators. In addition, significant differences exist between the tools avail-
able from the various service companies, and technological developments are occurring all the
time,  so  specific  operating  details  will  not  be  given  here.  However,  in  addition  to  the  well
preparation described earlier, a number of recommendations can be made for the sampling pro-
cess:

• Planning must optimize the match between tool capability and sampling and analysis needs.
• Sample  sizes  collected  should  be  compatible  with  storage  containers  so  that  individual

samples can be transferred in their entirety.

• Sample  chambers  containing  mixing  devices  are  to  be  preferred  because  they  facilitate
sample homogenization before transfer; where possible, duplicate samples should be taken from
each depth sampled.

• To  determine  depth  gradients,  samples  should  be  collected  from  at  least  three  different
depths spanning the reservoir interval; when available, fluid-quality monitors should be used to
evaluate cleanup of the fluid entering the tool.

• The  fluid-sampling  rate  should  be  adjusted  where  possible  to  minimize  pressure  draw-
down, unless downhole bubblepoint measurement or estimation are available that allow higher
sampling rates to be used with confidence.

• If OBM was used in drilling, collect a sample of the mud that has been used most recent-
ly, and contact a laboratory that will analyze the samples to establish which fluid samples are
needed; for some correction techniques, samples are required from the same depth with differ-
ent levels of filtrate contamination.

• Use of the formation-tester pump to compress collected samples (sometimes referred to as
“overpressuring”)  may  help  reduce  the  effects  of  cooling,  but  it  should  not  be  used  if  final
pressures are to be used as a measure of sample quality. If phase segregation on cooling must
be avoided, single-phase sample chambers should be selected as described below.

• If fluid pumpout into the well is not possible (e.g., for safety reasons—H2S, low overbal-
ance, etc.), large sample chambers should be used at the start of sampling to serve as “dump”
chambers, allowing better-quality samples to be collected afterward.

• The  depth  and  sampling  time  must  be  recorded  together  with  the  serial  number  of  each

chamber.

• If  possible,  avoid  using  OBM  when  drilling,  or  switch  to  water-based  mud  for  probable
hydrocarbon-bearing intervals. Handling and transfer of formation-test samples should be along
the lines described above for production-test downhole samples.

4.6.3 Single-Phase  Sampling.    Downhole  samples  cool  down  as  they  are  pulled  out  of  the
well, and the associated fall in pressure will usually result in the sample entering the two-phase
region,  thus  necessitating  homogenization  before  transfer.  Special  versions  of  downhole  sam-
plers  now  available,  known  as  single-phase  or  monophasic  samplers,  use  the  release  of  gas
pressure  behind  an  additional  piston  to  maintain  a  downhole  sample  above  reservoir  pressure
while it is brought to the surface. This design of sampler is especially used for reservoir fluids
likely to precipitate asphaltenes, which are very susceptible to pressure reduction and difficult
to homogenize. For other fluids, single-phase samplers facilitate sample transfer and reduce the
chance of the transferred fluid not being representative of the fluid in the sampler. One disad-
vantage  of  the  one-phase  sampler  is  that  a  “bubblepoint  check”  cannot  be  performed  on  site
because  the  gas  buffer  will  mask  sample  behavior.  One  solution  to  this  limitation  is  to  run  a
conventional sampler in tandem to permit a quality check on one of the samples in the field.

Although the single-phase sampler will prevent the formation of a gas phase in most cases,
it  does  not  prevent  the  formation  of  a  wax  phase  in  waxy  reservoir  fluids,  which  commonly
occurs with cooling. A sampler with a heated chamber is available but has not been used wide-
ly.  Also,  gas/condensate  fluids  undergo  significant  shrinkage  on  cooling,  and  single-phase
samplers  may  not  prevent  the  formation  of  condensate  in  the  sample  chamber.  Single-phase
versions of formation-tester sample chambers are also available.

4.6.4 Other Downhole-Sampling Tools.  Various other tools can be used to collect downhole
fluid samples, such as DST chambers, but thought must be given to the problems in recovering
a valid sample from the tool, and preference must be given to configurations that allow sam-
ples  to  be  homogenized,  transferred  under  pressure,  and  preferably  contained  in  a  single
storage cylinder. Industry practice now favors the use of standard wireline samplers conveyed
into the well as part of the DST tool.

4.6.5 Separator Sampling.  Surface  sampling  primarily  involves  sampling  individual  gas  and
liquid  streams  from  a  production  separator  or  similar  installation,  and  it  is  by  far  the  most
common method of sampling pressurized hydrocarbon fluids. The operation of oil and gas sep-
arators  is  covered  in  detail  elsewhere  in  this  Handbook.  Usually,  the  objective  of  separator
sampling is to obtain a fluid representative of the production of one well that enters the separa-
tor in its entirety, but the method also can be used to obtain a fluid representing commingled
production  from  a  number  of  wells  into  a  single  gas/oil  separation  plant.  In  either  case,  the
objective is to collect separate samples of the gas and liquid exiting the separator and to mea-
sure the separate flow rates of the two phases and obtain the GOR. Although the two phases
are never in perfect equilibrium, providing that the two samples are representative of the sepa-
rate flows, it is possible to mix the two samples together in the same proportion in which they
are produced to obtain a recombined sample that represents the fluid entering the separator.

Some of the biggest errors affecting fluid samples are related to the measurement of separator-
gas  and  -liquid  flow  rates,  which  are  crucial  for  the  recombination  process  in  the  laboratory.
Good  accuracy  is  often  considered  to  be  in  the  region  of  5%,  but  the  figure  can  be  much
worse, for example, if there is carry-over of liquid in the gas exit stream (or carry-under of gas
in  an  oil  with  foaming  tendencies).  Problems  are  especially  common  for  gas-well  production
tests, where very high flow rates can be used, and special techniques are available for trying to
measure liquid carry-over in such situations. However, the best approach involves proper sizing
and  adjustment  of  the  separator  for  the  production  rate.  Another  important  source  of  error  in
this domain involves confusion over whether liquid flow rates are reported at separator condi-
tions or at tank conditions; this has serious implications for gas/condensate fluids in which the
separator-liquid shrinkage is typically much larger than in the case of an oil.

Although  broad  guidelines  were  given  above  concerning  the  volumes  of  samples  that
should be collected, special attention should be given when collecting gas samples from separa-

tors  operating  at  low  pressures  because  the  lower  density  may  result  in  the  collection  of
insufficient weight of gas. Fig. 4.4 enables the required volume of gas to be estimated simply
as a function of separator pressure, GOR, and the volume of liquid that is required. This chart

In line with current trends in the oil industry, this work recommends using evacuated bot-
tles  for  gases  and  piston  bottles  for  liquids  and  avoiding  any  use  of  mercury  in  sampling
operations.  At  extremely  low  temperatures,  piston  bottles  have  been  reported  to  leak  past  the
piston seal, so sampling under such conditions should be avoided if possible. If these methods
cannot be used, then repeated purging (a minimum of five times) should be used for gas sam-
ples, and the displacement of brine should be used for liquid samples unless high H2S or CO2
levels are present, in which case it is preferable to use separator water saturated with gas if it
is  available.  The  principal  guidelines  to  be  followed  for  surface  sampling  are  given  in  Table
4.4.

The following two subsections describe the two most common separator-sampling methods

in detail.

API RP 44 Gas Method No. 1: Filling an Evacuated Container.  The following step-by-step
method is reproduced from RP 44 (where it appears as Section 6.3.7.1)6 by kind permission of
API.

This  method  is  especially  simple  and  accurate.  The  principal  undesirable  feature  of  the
method  is  the  requirement  that  the  vessel  be  evacuated  before  its  transport  to  the  sampling
point (with possible loss of vacuum during transport), or that a vacuum pump be provided at
the wellsite. Testing pre-evacuated vessels for adequate vacuum at the time of sampling should
be done only by personnel well trained in vacuum-testing procedures because improper testing
often leads to loss of vacuum or introduction of air into the sample vessel. (Collecting an addi-
tional sample may be preferable to vacuum testing.) A clean, evacuated container should never
be purged with separator gas and re-evacuated in the field because any liquid that condenses in
the container during the purge may not totally re-evaporate during evacuation in the field.

I-192

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Sample collection is accomplished by the following steps:
1. Locate an appropriate sample source valve A (see Fig. 4.5) on the separator from which
the desired sample can be collected. Clean any debris from valve A; open the valve briefly to
blow it out, and then close it.

2. Connect the fitting on the flexible tubing of the sampling rig securely to valve A on the

separator. Open the line valve B, and open the purge valve C.

3. If  a  vacuum  pump  is  available  and  personnel  are  qualified  in  vacuum  techniques,  con-
nect  the  sample  inlet  valve  D  on  the  sample  container  to  the  fitting  on  the  sampling  rig,  as
shown in Fig. 4.5. Connect the vacuum pump to valve C, open valve C and valve B to evacu-
ate  the  sampling  rig,  then  close  valve  C  and  disconnect  the  pump.  Slowly  reopen  valve  A
completely to establish full separator pressure on the entire sampling rig from valve A to valve
D, and proceed to Step 6.

4. If a vacuum pump is not available, open valves B and C, then open and close valve A in
one quick burst to purge air from the sampling rig, and quickly close valve B. Slowly reopen
valve A completely to establish full separator pressure on the entire sampling rig from valve A
to valve B.

5. Connect the sample inlet valve D on the sample container to the fitting on the sampling
rig,  as  shown  in  Fig.  4.5.  Open  valve  C,  then  open  and  close  valve  B  in  one  quick  burst  to
purge air from the line connecting valves B and D, and close valve C promptly. Note: Use a
long vent line on valve C if H2S is present. Reopen valve B to establish full separator pressure
on the entire sampling rig from valve A to valve D.

6. Cautiously  crack  open  valve  D,  while  carefully  monitoring  the  pressure  gauge,  and  fill
the container slowly. Continuously adjust valve D as needed to keep full pressure on the pres-
sure gauge. Filling a large container can take as long as 20 minutes. The progress of the filling
process can be monitored by listening for a hissing sound at valve D (and in the container) and
by  monitoring  the  pressure  gauge.  When  you  think  that  the  container  is  full,  open  valve  D
further while listening to the container and monitoring the pressure gauge.

7. When the container is full, close valve D, and then close valve B.
8. Slightly open valve C to bleed the connections between valves B and D to atmospheric
pressure. Note: The line from valve A to valve B, including the pressure gauge, is still under
full pressure. Use a long vent line on valve C if H2S is present.

9. Disconnect the sample container. This is the last step in collecting the first sample. The

apparatus is now ready for collecting additional samples by repeating Steps 5–8.

10. Following collection of the last sample, close valve A securely, then open valve B (and
valve C, if it is not already open) to bleed pressure from all parts of the line and sampling rig
before  disconnecting  the  line  from  valve  A.  Note:  Use  a  long  vent  line  on  valve  C  if  H2S  is
present.

11. Insert sealing plugs into the valves on each sample container; then check the valves for
leaks  by  immersing  them  in  water  or  painting  them  with  soap  solution.  Before  inserting  the
sealing  plugs,  the  threads  should  be  lubricated  by  stretching  Teflon®  tape  into  the  threads  or
by applying pipe dope. After a container is determined to be leak-free, it should be tagged and
otherwise prepared for storage or transit.

API RP 44 Oil Method No. 3: Filling a Piston-Type Container.  The following step-by-step
method is reproduced from RP 44 (where it appears as Section 6.3.8.3)6 by kind permission of
API. It refers to the same sampling rig as that used for the gas-sampling method above, though
the sample cylinder will contain a piston, and valve E will represent the hydraulic-fluid connec-
tion, as indicated in Fig. 4.6. Some steps in this procedure may need modification depending
on  exact  equipment  design;  this  is  notable  for  sample  cylinders,  which  have  an  additional
purge valve at the sample inlet end of the cylinder.

Fig. 4.6—Diagram of a liquid-sampling apparatus.

This  is  a  preferred  method  for  nonmercury  liquid-sample  collection.  It  has  the  advantage
that the liquid sample can be kept at the saturation pressure throughout the collection process,
which avoids gas breakout from the sample. In addition, the sample does not come into contact
with any other fluids during sampling or during transfer in the laboratory. The undesirable fea-
ture  of  the  method  is  that  with  sample  containers,  the  potential  for  contamination  with  hy-
draulic fluid exists if the seal on the piston leaks. (Water can be used as the hydraulic fluid to

I-194

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

minimize the possibility of contamination, but the operator should first check with the manufac-
turer to ensure that water will not damage the container.)

If a piston-type container is being used, hydraulic fluid must be preloaded behind the piston
so  that  the  piston  position  is  fully  toward  the  sampling  end.  A  danger  is  that  inexperienced
personnel  may  not  know  this  and  may  attempt  to  use  this  type  of  container  without  a  proper
fill of hydraulic fluid and without proper hydraulic-pressure support on the piston seal. In such
a case, full pressure will not be maintained on the separator oil during sampling, and the pro-
cess  essentially  will  be  the  same  as  filling  an  empty  container,  except  that  the  seal  on  the
piston might leak. The manufacturer’s instructions should be consulted to ensure that the opera-
tion  of  the  piston-type  container  is  completely  understood  before  commencing  the  sampling
operation.

The procedure is as follows:
1. Locate an appropriate sample source valve A on the separator (see Fig. 4.6) from which
the  desired  oil  sample  can  be  collected.  Clean  any  debris  from  valve  A,  hold  a  rag  over  the
valve (or attach a temporary purge line connected to a suitable container), open valve A slow-
ly, purge sufficient oil through the valve, and then close valve A. Remove the rag or tempo-
rary purge line. Note: Use a long vent line if H2S is present.

2. Connect  the  fitting  on  the  flexible  tubing  of  the  sampling  rig  (see  Fig.  4.6)  securely  to

valve A on the separator. Open the line valve B, and open the purge valve C.

3. If  a  vacuum  pump  is  available  and  personnel  are  qualified  in  vacuum  techniques,  con-
nect  the  sample  inlet  valve  D  on  the  sample  container  to  the  fitting  on  the  sampling  rig,  as
shown in Fig. 4.6. Connect the vacuum pump to valve C, open valve C and valve B to evacu-
ate  the  sampling  rig,  and  then  close  valve  B.  Slowly  reopen  valve  A  completely  to  establish
full  separator  pressure  on  the  entire  sampling  rig  from  valve  A  to  valve  B.  Open  valve  D  to
evacuate  the  connection  and  the  small  dead  volume  in  the  container  (the  internal  volume  be-
tween valve D and the face of the piston when the piston position is at the sampling end), then
close  valve  C  and  disconnect  the  pump.  Slowly  reopen  valve  B  completely  to  establish  full
separator pressure on the entire system from valve A through valve D to the face of the piston
in the container, and proceed to Step 6. Be sure that valve D is completely open.

4. If a vacuum pump is not available, close valve B and open valve A slowly (the pressure
on the gauge should rise to the separator pressure). Close valve A, attach a purge line at the
end of the rig below valve C, close valve C, and open valve B to let the pressure deplete to
atmospheric.  Close  valve  B,  then  slowly  reopen  valve  A  completely.  Slightly  open  valve  B,
and slowly purge a volume of oil equivalent to several times the volume of the sampling rig,
collecting  the  purged  oil  in  a  suitable  container  (maintain  full  separator  pressure  on  the  pres-
sure  gauge  during  this  purge).  Close  valve  B,  and  remove  the  purge  line.  Full  separator
pressure should now be on the entire sampling rig from valve A to valve B.

5. Connect the sample inlet valve D on the sample container to the fitting on the sampling
rig, as shown in Fig. 4.6, and attach a purge line at the end of valve C. Open valve D, close
valve  C,  and  open  valve  B  slowly  to  pressure  up  the  connection  with  the  container  and  any
dead  volume  in  the  sample  container.  Close  valve  B,  and  open  valve  C  to  let  the  pressure
deplete  to  atmospheric.  Close  valve  C,  then  slowly  reopen  valve  B  completely.  Slightly  open
valve C, and slowly purge a volume of oil equivalent to several times the volume of the con-
nection, collecting the purged oil in a suitable container (maintain full separator pressure on the
pressure  gauge  during  this  purge).  Close  valve  C,  and  remove  the  purge  line.  Full  separator
pressure should now be on the entire sampling rig from valve A through valve D to the face of
the piston in the sample container. Be sure that valve D is completely open. Note: This method
is not perfect because the oil in the dead volume in the sample container has not been purged
under pressure. However, if the piston position is fully toward the sampling end of the contain-
er, the amount of oil in the dead volume will be negligible.

Chapter 4—Fluid Sampling

6. Cautiously  crack  open  sample  outlet  valve  E  while  carefully  monitoring  the  pressure
gauge, and allow the sample fluid to slowly displace the preload hydraulic oil into a suitable
collection  vessel.  Continuously  adjust  valve  E  as  needed  to  be  sure  that  the  rate  of  sample
collection is sufficiently slow so that full separator pressure is maintained on the sample side
of the piston (as indicated by the pressure gauge). The sampling operation can be ended when
a  desired  volume  of  sample  is  collected  (as  indicated  by  a  given  volume  of  hydraulic  fluid
being displaced to the collection vessel). The operation must be stopped with at least enough
preload liquid left in the container to provide the “outage” required in Step 7. Close valves E,
D, and B, in that order. (If the container has a magnetic indicator to show the position of the
piston, then nitrogen gas can be used as the hydraulic fluid behind the piston, and Step 7 can
be eliminated so long as approximately 10% volume of nitrogen remains on the hydraulic side
of the piston.)

7. Open valve E slightly (with valve D closed), and drain into the collection vessel a vol-
ume of hydraulic oil equal to approximately 10% of the container volume. This will create the
necessary vapor space in the container without altering the overall composition of the oil sam-
ple.  (Be  sure  to  leave  at  least  some  hydraulic  oil  behind  the  piston  so  that  there  is  pressure
support on the seal and very little pressure drop across the seal). Close valve E securely.

8. Slightly open valve C to bleed the connections between valves B and D to atmospheric
pressure. Note: The line from valve A to B, including the pressure gauge, is still under pres-
sure. Use a long vent line if H2S is present.

9. Disconnect the sample container. This is the last step for the first sample and leaves the

apparatus ready for collection of additional samples by repeating Steps 5–8.

10. Following collection of the last sample, close valve A securely, then open valve B (and
valve C, if it is not already open) to bleed pressure from all parts of the line and sampling rig
before disconnecting the line from source valve A.

11. Wipe  the  valves  on  the  sample  container  clean  and  inspect  for  any  signs  of  leakage.
After a container is determined to be leak-free, insert plugs in the valves, then tag the contain-
er and otherwise prepare it for storage or transit. Before inserting the sealing plugs, the threads
should be lubricated by stretching Teflon® tape into the threads or by applying pipe dope.

4.6.6 Wellhead Sampling.  Wellhead sampling, more commonly known as flowline sampling,
involves  the  collection  of  a  fluid  sample  at  the  surface  from  the  wellhead  itself  or  from  the
flowline  or  upstream  side  of  the  choke  manifold,  provided  that  the  fluid  is  still  in  one-phase
condition.  This  option  is  restricted  to  wells  producing  dry  gas,  very-low-GOR  oils,  and  some
high-pressure/high-temperature  reservoir  fluids.  Dry-gas  wellhead  samples  can  be  collected  as
for  gas  sampling  from  a  separator,  whereas  wellhead  sampling  of  other  or  unknown  fluids
should be performed as for separator liquids. However, all equipment must be compatible with
maximum wellhead pressure, and as the state of the fluid is not usually known with certainty,
separator sampling also should be performed if possible, as a backup.

4.6.7 Isokinetic Sampling.  Isokinetic sampling, also known as split-stream sampling, involves
collecting samples from well production in two-phase flow, using a small side stream to allow
the two-phase fluid to be collected and measured in laboratory scale equipment at the wellsite.
There  are  two  principal  challenges  in  this  approach:  controlling  the  side  stream  so  that  it  is
removed from the main flow at identical velocity (hence the term isokinetic) to avoid dispropor-
tionate  sampling  of  the  two  phases,  and  ensuring  that  the  flow  is  turbulent  upstream  of  the
sampling probe so that the minor phase is finely distributed in the major phase. Although this
special type of sampling has been used for more than 60 years, mainly for sampling gas/con-
densate  production,  many  still  consider  it  to  be  at  the  development  stage,2  and  it  has  never
achieved  wide  acceptance.  A  more  recent  development  of  isokinetic  sampling  involves  sam-
pling of the exit gas stream from a separator and calculation of a figure for separator

I-196

efficiency.  This  efficiency  is  then  used  to  modify  the  GOR  used  for  recombining  separator
samples, but it should be compared to the separator efficiencies reported elsewhere in this Hand-
book.

4.7 Nonpressurized Hydrocarbon Fluid-Sampling Procedures
The sampling of nonpressurized or atmospheric-pressure hydrocarbon fluids from lines is rela-
tively  simple  to  perform,  but  attention  must  be  paid  to  the  need  to  purge  sampling  lines  and
pipework  with  at  least  three  times  their  volume  of  fresh  fluid  before  each  sampling  session.
This is especially important in some installations and processing facilities, where the sampling
point may be at the end of a “dead-leg” or trap in which fluid has collected or stagnated over
a long period of time. In general, oil or condensate samples should be collected from a sample
tap on the side of the line or the top of the line to avoid any water or sediment that may have
accumulated  at  the  bottom  of  the  line.  Atmospheric  gas  samples  are  rarely  collected,  but  if
they  are  required,  they  should  be  collected  in  evacuated  chambers  to  minimize  contamination
by air.

Atmospheric  hydrocarbon  samples  also  may  be  collected  from  pressurized  lines  or  from
samples  collected  in  pressurized  chambers,  such  as  downhole  samples.  Usually,  this  will  in-
volve  the  release  of  gas  and  the  collection  of  oil  or  condensate.  Because  the  separation
procedure that releases gas is dependent on the temperature and pressure (which may be above
atmospheric  if  the  liquid  is  collected  in  a  closed  trap),  the  properties  of  samples  collected  in
this way may vary. Also, because the fluid in a sample chamber may already be in two-phase
condition (or may have segregated), liquid from the entire sample should be collected to mini-
mize uncertainty in the sample quality.

Sampling from tanks is complicated by the need to collect samples from various depths to
allow  for  any  property  changes  or  segregation  that  may  exist.  The  procedure  given  next  is  a
traditional method used for measuring and testing a field tank of crude oil, frequently referred
to as “running” when related to custody-transfer transactions. It was published as API Standard
2500  but  is  no  longer  available.  The  method  is  reproduced  here  with  the  permission  of  the
American Petroleum Inst. It is intended to support operations still using this method, or meth-
ods derived from it, and serve as a guideline to engineers setting up similar methods. Detailed
descriptions of individual calibration and measurement methods are available in the API Manu-
al  of  Petroleum  Measurement  Standards  (MPMS),9  which  represents  all  branches  of  the
petroleum industry and is the recognized standard for downstream measurement methods.

4.7.1 Procedure for Typical Measuring, Sampling, and Testing of a Tank of Oil.

1. The  tank  is  vertical,  nonpressurized,  and  has  a  fixed  roof  with  side  outlets;  it  is  to  be
gauged  by  the  innage method (a  process  to  determine the  depth  of  liquid in  a  tank,  which  is
measured from the surface of the liquid to the tank bottom or to a fixed datum plate).

2. The oil viscosity is less than 100 Saybolt seconds at 100°F and is a liquid at atmospher-

ic temperature and pressure.

3. A cup-case thermometer is used to read the temperature of the oil in the tank.
4. A thief is used to obtain fluid samples from the tank. (A “thief” is an industry term for a
bottom-closure, core-type sampler used to secure samples from chosen depths in storage tanks.)
5. The  API  gravity  scale  hydrometer  test  method  is  used  to  determine  the  API  gravity  of

the oil; the temperature of the oil has to be near 60°F (±5°F).

6. The water and sediment in the oil are to be determined by the centrifuge method with a

203-mm (8-in.) cone-shaped tube.
The following outline gives the sequence of steps to be taken and the key points to be noted at
each step.

1. Isolate the tank to be checked.

Chapter 4—Fluid Sampling

I-197

2. Use safety precautions and fresh air bottles if an H2S hazard exists.
3. Ground yourself to a stair railing or tank shell before reaching the top. This prevents static-

electrical discharge in a hazardous area.

4. Stand to the side of the hatch when opening it to permit wind to blow gas away from you.
5. Measure the temperature: suspend a thermometer in the oil tank. The thermometer should

be 12 in. or more from the tank shell and must be immersed in oil for 5 minutes.

Use an American Soc. for Testing and Materials (ASTM)-approved, wood-back or corrosion-
resistant metal cup case. If atmospheric temperature differs by more than 20°F from that of the
liquid  in  the  tank,  the  cup  case  should  be  given  at  least  two  preliminary  immersions.  Empty
the cup case after each immersion.

Rapidly withdraw the thermometer and read and record the temperature to the nearest 1°F.

Note: The number of temperature measurements varies with the depth of the liquid.

In a tank containing more than 15 ft of liquid, three measurements should be taken: (1) 3 ft
below  the  top  surface  of  the  liquid,  (2)  in  the  middle  of  the  liquid,  and  (3)  3  ft  above  the
bottom of the liquid.

In  a  tank  containing  10  to  15  ft  of  liquid,  two  measurements  should  be  taken:  (1)  3  ft
below the top surface of the liquid, and (2) 3 ft above the bottom surface of the liquid. In a
tank containing less than 10 ft of liquid, one measurement should be taken in the middle of the
liquid.  For  tanks  over  10  ft  high  with  a  capacity  of  less  than  5,000  bbl,  one  measurement  in
the middle of the liquid should be taken.

6. With a thief, take sample(s) for a BS&W centrifuge test. Note: The number of samples

to be taken for BS&W determination varies.

In tanks larger than 1,000-bbl capacity that contain more than 15 ft of liquid, equal-volume
samples should be taken (1) 6 in. below the top of the liquid, (2) at the middle of the liquid,
and (3) at the outlet connection of the merchantable oil, in the order named. This method also
may be used in tanks up to and including a capacity of 1,000 bbl.

In  a  tank  larger  than  1,000-bbl  capacity  that  contains  more  than  10  ft  and  up  to  15  ft  of
liquid, equal-volume samples should be taken (1) 6 in. below the top surface of the liquid and
(2) at the outlet connection of the merchantable oil, in the order named. This method may be
used on tanks up to and including a capacity of 1,000 bbl.

In  a  tank  larger  than  1,000-bbl  capacity  that  contains  10  ft  or  less  of  liquid,  one  sample

may be taken in the middle of the column of liquid.

7. Place the BS&W composite sample in a sample container. The sample should be a blend
of  the  upper,  middle,  and  lower  samples  (if  three  samples  were  required),  containing  equal
parts from the samples taken.

8. Seal  the  sample  container.  In  the  lower  48  states,  with  the  exception  of  California,  the
sample is  ready  to  be  tested for  BS&W,  as  described in  Step  17.  In  California, the  container
should be labeled and delivered to the laboratory for BS&W determination. (Note: These U.S.
state references were part of the original standard.)

9. With a thief, take a sample for gravity determination. The sample should be taken mid-
way between the oil surface and the pipeline connection. Hang the thief in the hatch. Remove
bubbles, and place the hydrometer in the oil sample.

10. Determine  and  record  the  sample  temperature  to  the  nearest  0.5°F.  The  hydrometer
must  float  away  from  the  wall  of  the  cylinder;  the  temperature  of  the  surrounding  media
should not change more than 5°F.

Depress the hydrometer two scale divisions and release. Read the hydrometer to the nearest

0.05°API on a scale at which surface or liquid cuts scale.

11. Read and record the sample temperature to the nearest 0.5°F. Repeat the gravity reading
if  the  temperature  of  the  sample  before  and  after  the  gravity  reading  has  changed  more  than
1°F.  Apply  any  relevant  correction  to  the  observed  hydrometer  reading  (correction  scale  on

I-198

bulb)  to  the  nearest  0.1°API.  Record  the  mean  temperature  reading  observed  before  and  after
the final hydrometer reading to the nearest 1°F.

Note:  Hydrometer  scale  readings  at  temperatures  other  than  calibration  temperatures
(60°F)  should  not  be  considered  more  than  scale  readings  because  the  hydrometer  bulb
changes with temperature.

12. Convert the relevant corrected value to standard temperatures. Use API MPMS Chapter

11.1 (Table 5A)9 for crude oils.

13. Take the bottom thief sample for BS&W height. Lower the clean, dry thief slowly into
the  oil  to  the  desired  depth,  trip  the  thief,  and  raise  it  slowly  to  avoid  agitation.  When  the
sample is taken, the top of the thief must be 2 in. above the bottom of the pipeline connections.
14. Determine and record BS&W height in the tank. Pour the remaining thief sample over
a  test  glass  until  contamination  appears.  Measure  and  record  (as  the  BS&W  height)  the  dis-
tance from the bottom of the thief to the top of the contamination in the thief. If BS&W height
is less than 4 in. from the bottom of the pipeline connection, do not run the tank.

15. Gauge the tank. Do not gauge a boiling or foaming tank. Use steel innage tape with an
innage plumb bob. Always make contact between the gauge line and the hatch while running
tape into the tank.

Gauge  the  tank  only  at  the  reference  point  on  the  gauging  hatch.  On  tanks  of  1,000-bbl
capacity or less, read to the nearest 1/4 in. On tanks of 1,000 bbl or more, read to the nearest
1/8 in. Record the reading immediately; repeat until two identical gauges are obtained.

16. Saturate  solvent  with  water.  Toluene  is  approved  solvent;  it  is  flammable  and  toxic.

Care should be taken when using toluene.

Fill a 1-qt or 1-L glass bottle with a screw top with 700 to 800 mL of toluene. Add 25 mL
of either distilled or tap water. Screw the cap on; shake vigorously for 30 seconds. Loosen the
cap; place the bottle in a bath for 30 minutes. Maintain the bath at a constant temperature of
140 ±5°F. Remove, tighten the cap, and shake vigorously for 30 seconds. Repeat three times.

Allow the bottle of water/toluene mixture to sit in the bath for 48 hours before using. Be

sure that no free water is left in the bottle.

17. Shake the sample container until the sample is well mixed. Fill two 203-mm (8-in.) cone-
shaped  centrifuge  tubes  with  50  mL  of  sample.  Use  a  pipette  to  add  50  mL  of  toluene.
Toluene should be water saturated at 140°F. Read the top of the meniscus at both the 50- and
100-mL marks. Add a 0.2-mL demulsifier if necessary for a clean break in the oil/water contact.
Stopper the tube tightly; invert the tube 10 times to ensure that oil and solvent are uniform-

ly mixed.

18. Loosen  the  stopper  slightly.  Immerse  the  tube  to  the  100-mL  mark  in  a  bath  for  15
minutes. The  bath  must  maintain a  temperature of  140  ±5°F;  by  contract agreement, the  bath
temperature may be 120 ±5°F.

Remove the tube from the bath and tighten the stopper. Invert the tube 10 times to ensure

that oil and solvent are uniformly mixed.

19. Place the tubes in trunnion cups on opposite sides of the centrifuge. Spin for 10 min-

utes while maintaining minimum relative centrifuge force of 600.

Following the spinning, read and record the combined volume of water and sediment at the
bottom of each tube. Read to the nearest 0.05 mL for oil from 0.1- to 1-mL graduation. Read
to the nearest 0.1 mL above 1-mL graduation. Estimate to the nearest 0.025 mL below 0.1-mL
graduation.

Return  the  tube  to  the  centrifuge  without  agitation.  Spin  for  10  minutes  at  the  same  rate.
Repeat  this  operation  until  the  combined  volume  of  water  and  sediment  remains  constant  on
two consecutive readings.

20. Record the final volume of water and sediment in each tube. The sum of the two admis-

sible readings is the vol% of water and sediment in the sample.

After the tank has been run, the following closing data should be obtained.
21. Closing  oil  temperature:  no  closing  temperature  is  necessary  on  tanks  of  5,000  bbl  or

less; on tanks of 5,000 bbl or more, always read to the nearest 1°F.

ing gauge reading.

More  information  concerning  the  specific  measurement  methods  referred  to  here  can  be
found in the API MPMS.9 The manual is being updated continually, and care should be taken
that  the  current  standard  or  chapter  is  used.  Identification  of  the  appropriate  section  can  be
made using the publication catalog on the API website (http://www.api.org/cat/).

4.8 Oilfield Waters
Oilfield waters are often referred to as brines, especially when they contain significant quanti-
ties of dissolved salts. They also frequently contain dissolved gases (more details are available
elsewhere  in  this  Handbook)  and  may  contain  small  quantities  of  the  heavier  hydrocarbons
found in oils. Water can be present in a surface separator during production, either from liquid
water  in  the  zone  being  tested  or  by  condensation  from  water  vapor  in  the  produced  gas,  or
possibly from both. Water from aquifers or seawater may also need to be analyzed in connec-
tion with water-injection activities.

The  analysis  of  oilfield  waters  has  a  wide  range  of  applications,  including  identifying  the
origin  of  produced  water,  characterizing  aquifer  properties,  interpreting  wireline-log  measure-
ments,  predicting  formation  damage  from  water  incompatibility,  investigating  scaling  tenden-
cies in surface and downhole equipment, monitoring fluid movement in reservoirs, identifying
the presence of bacteria, evaluating disposal options and environmental compliance, and predict-
ing and monitoring corrosion. Water analyses also can be useful in diagnosing and correcting
numerous oilfield operating problems.

API publishes Recommended Practice 45,10 which contains information on the applications
of  oilfield-water  analyses  and  gives  recommendations  for  the  proper  collection,  preservation,
and  labeling  of  oilfield-water  samples.  RP  45  also  gives  a  description  of  numerous  analytical
methods and recommends appropriate reporting formats for analytical results. This publication
should  be  consulted  for  more  information  about  specific  analytical  methods  and  any  special
sampling  or  storage  requirements  linked  to  such  methods.  Numerous  analytical  methods  are
also available as ASTM standards.11

When  sampling  and  analysis  are  part  of  a  long-term  monitoring  program,  such  as  those
required by government authorities or those forming part of custody-transfer contracts, the meth-
ods  defined  in  the  appropriate  documentation  or  contracts  must  be  followed  as  closely  as
possible,  even  if  this  constitutes  differences  with  the  procedures  or  recommendations  in  this
text or with the industry standards cited here. However, the guidelines provided here should be
taken into consideration before contracts are drafted or when existing contracts are renewed.

If samples are to be collected for the measurement of trace components, biological species,
or  reactive  chemicals  that  are  likely  to  be  affected  by  storage,  container  material,  or  ambient
conditions, on-site analyses should be considered. API RP 45 lists the following measurements
that should be carried out immediately in the field after sampling and filtering oilfield waters:
(1)  pH,  (2)  temperature,  (3)  alkalinity,  (4)  dissolved  oxygen,  (5)  CO2,  (6)  H2S,  and  (7)  total
and soluble iron. Other measurements or preparations to be performed in the field include (8)
turbidity on an unfiltered sample, (9) total suspended solids with at least primary filtration and
washing  performed  in  the  field,  (10)  bacteria  with  filtering  and/or  culturing  in  the  field,  and
incubation and counting performed in the laboratory. Biological determinations are outside the
scope of this document but are covered in detail elsewhere.12,13

I-200

Fig. 4.7—Water-sampling method to avoid air.

For many other analyses, special preparation and preservation measures are required to be
performed in the field. This can involve acidification with various acids, addition of other chem-
icals,  refrigeration  [ideally  39°F  (4°C)],  and  storage  in  the  dark.  If  there  is  any  uncertainty
concerning sample storage  conditions, the  laboratory that will  perform  the  analyses  should  be
consulted  for  advice.  If  no  information  is  available,  it  is  advisable  to  keep  samples  cool  and
out of the sunlight.

For a DST that does not flow to the surface, great care must be taken to determine if the
test  has  flowed  sufficient  fluid  to  allow  representative  reservoir  brine  into  the  tool.  The  best
practice is to sample the water after each stand of pipe is removed. Normally, the total-dissolved-
solids  content  will  increase  downward  and  become  constant  when  pure  formation  water  is
obtained. A test that flows water will give even higher assurance of an uncontaminated sample.
If  only  one  DST  water  sample  is  taken  for  analysis,  it  should  be  taken  just  above  the  tool
because this is the last water to enter the tool and is least likely to show contamination.

Surface sampling is commonly used to obtain a sample of formation water from a sampling
valve at the wellhead or another sampling point. A plastic or rubber tube can be used to trans-
fer  the  sample  from  the  sample  valve  into  the  container.  Fig.  4.7  shows  a  simple  method  of
excluding  air  when  sampling  water  in  this  way.  After  purging  the  sample  valve  and  line  to
remove  any  foreign  material,  water  is  delivered  to  the  bottom  of  the  sample  bottle,  which  is
placed in a large, much taller beaker until the water fills the beaker and overflows. Then, the
cap is immersed in the beaker and inverted to eliminate air bubbles before removing the deliv-
ery tube and closing the sample bottle under water. This technique cannot be used when acid
or other preservatives must be added to the sample.

An  alternative  sampling  technique  for  use  when  a  clean  source  of  water  is  available  is
shown in Fig. 4.8. Here, once the sample point and line have been purged, the sample is col-
lected  in  the  sample  cylinder  by  closing  the  two  valves.  This  system  should  not  be  used  to
collect pressurized water samples.

In  many  producing  wells,  it  may  be  impossible  to  locate  a  suitable  sampling  point  free
from oil or gas, such as for pumping wellheads in which the brine will surge out in heads and
be mixed with oil. In such situations, a larger container equipped with a sampling tap near the
bottom can be used as a surge tank or oil/water separator. Such a device is shown in Fig. 4.9.
This method will serve to obtain samples that are relatively oil-free.

Fig. 4.9—Oil/water separator and water-sample filtering system.

For some measurements, it is necessary to obtain a field-filtered sample. The filtering sys-
tem  shown  in  Fig.  4.9  is  simple  and  economical  and  can  be  used  for  various  applications.  It
consists of a 50-mL disposable syringe, two check valves, and an inline disk-filter holder. The
filter holder takes size 47-mm-diameter, 0.45-μm pore-size filters, with the option of including
various prefilters. The syringe fill line should be connected to a source of brine free from oil
or gas, either directly to a suitable sample point or to the brine outlet from a suitable separa-

I-202

tion vessel, as shown in Fig. 4.9. The brine is drawn through the inlet line into the syringe and
then forced through the filter into the collection bottle. The check valves allow the syringe to
be used as a pump for filling the collection bottle without needing to open and close valves. If
the filter becomes clogged, it can be replaced in a few minutes. Approximately 2 minutes are
required to collect 250 mL of sample. Usually two samples are taken, with the one being acidi-
fied to pH 3 or less with concentrated hydrochloric or nitric acid. The system can be cleaned
easily or flushed with brine to prevent contamination.

If pressurized water samples are required, most of the procedures described previously for
pressurized hydrocarbon fluids can be used, including downhole sampling. Piston sample bot-
tles are essential because the sample cannot be collected by the displacement of water or brine.

4.9 Sampling-Data Measurement and Recording
In the same way that laboratory measurements require representative samples to be meaningful,
the samples themselves must be supported by accurate data to provide a unique identification
and to record all important production and sampling parameters that will be used in checking
the sample and (in many cases) in determining the exact measurements that will be performed.
This section reviews the importance of data measurement and provides guidelines for recording
and validating the necessary data.

Provided that flowmeters and pressure gauges are properly sized for a measurement, so that
readings are not made at the low end of the measurement range, random errors are generally
small.  Systematic  errors  are  a  major  concern,  however,  for  all  measurements,  deriving  from
sensor  malfunction,  poor  (or  lack  of)  calibration,  and  human  error  in  general;  the  latter  item
can  include  both  errors  in  recording  and  reporting  data  and  those  deriving  from  the  use  of
computer-based  acquisition  systems  (e.g.,  entry  of  erroneous  calibration  data,  incorrect  sensor
connections, and even software bugs). Although systematic errors are comparatively rare, their
magnitude can be significant. In fact, on some occasions, errors are identified only when mea-
sured values are so large that the values become ridiculous.

The GOR is considered to be the most important measurement for separator samples, and it
is  dependent  on  errors  in  both  the  gas  flow  rate  and  the  oil  flow  rate,  which  are  measured
separately. New techniques have seen limited application to reduce errors in GOR, such as the
injection  of  a  standard  marker  chemical  upstream  of  the  separator  and  measurements  of  the
concentrations in the separated gas and liquid streams. Also, use of various carry-over measure-
ment  techniques  has  been  made,  such  as  the  isokinetic  approach  described  briefly  earlier.
However,  significant  improvements  can  be  achieved  simply  by  proper  sizing,  calibration,  and
recording.

In  production  testing,  gas  flow  rate  itself  is  widely  measured  by  the  orifice  meter.  This
system has been in use for a long time, but new standards have been issued more recently that
improve gas rate calculations.14 The orifice meter relies on a range of coefficients or factors to
calculate the flow rate from the differential pressure measured across the orifice. Many of these
factors  are  derived  from  on-site  measurements  of  the  gas.  The  measurement  accuracy  can  be
improved by ensuring that the orifice plate has been sized correctly for the flow so that it falls
within  30  to  70%  of  full  range  (or  higher,  if  there  is  no  chance  of  going  off  scale).  Likely
additional  sources  of  error  come  from  what  could  be  considered  mechanical  factors,  such  as
the physical condition of the orifice plate itself; waxy deposits or damage will change the flow
performance and can lead to significant errors. An obvious but commonly overlooked potential
error concerns not the condition of the orifice, but the recording of the orifice size. An over-
sight here can have serious implications not only for fluid analysis but for well-test interpreta-
tion.  Errors  in  the  differential-pressure measurement derive primarily from  poor  calibration of
the  recording  instrument  or  from  liquid  buildup  in  the  lines  that  have  not  been  purged.  The
orifice  meter  pressure-base  factor  is  a  common  source  of  errors  because  variations  do  exist
between  the  reference  pressure  and  temperature  used  for  gas  measurements  (e.g.,  a  variation

Chapter 4—Fluid Sampling

I-203

between  100  kPa  and  14.7  psia  is  an  increase  of  1.4%).  Thus,  it  is  essential  that  reference
conditions are quoted correctly. The actual source of gas gravity and supercompressibility fac-
tors (Fg and Fpv) is usually not important for fluid studies because accurate values are common-
ly calculated in the laboratory on the basis of compositional analysis of the gas sample, but it
is necessary to know exactly which values were used to correct gas flow rate to the new val-
ues.  To  ensure  the  highest  accuracy  in  gas  flow-rate  measurement,  a  check  should  be  made
that  all  the  meter  factors  are  determined  and  used  correctly.  Approximate  flow  rates  can  be
derived from the choke setting, and a comparison should identify any major error in the orifice
meter calculation.

Condensate or oil flow rates are normally measured by a positive displacement meter that
is  placed  in  the  outlet  line  from  the  separator  upstream  of  the  flow  control  valve.  The  most
common  error  derives  from  incomplete  reporting  of  the  measurement  conditions  for  the  oil
rate, especially whether  the  oil  flow  is  measured at  separator  or  at  stock-tank conditions, and
the meter factors and shrinkage values that should be applied if stock-tank rates are reported.
The most likely causes of error in the measurement itself are poor calibration, worn seals (al-
lowing liquid to bypass the measuring element), or the release of gas leading to high-volume,
two-phase measurement. The latter problem can be treated by the installation of a “gas elimina-
tor,” which is effectively a tiny separator before the meter. Gas breakout in the meter may be
signaled  by  sudden  flow-rate  fluctuations,  whereas  stable  foams  with  some  oils  (occasionally
referred to as “carry-under”) may be less obvious and may require antifoaming agents to over-
come. Any water and sediment in the oil flow should be determined by the BS&W measure-
ment and corrected for accordingly. It is good practice to size the flowmeter according to the
expected flow rate, as recommended for gas flows. Flow rates also should be checked by gaug-
ing the stock tank regularly.

BS&W  measurement  is  performed  by  centrifuging  a  sample  of  liquid  mixed  with  solvent;
although relative error in the measurement can be very important at low BS&W, measurement
accuracy  is  generally  adequate  for  the  purposes  of  flow-rate  correction.  Of  more  concern  is
whether  the  sample  used  for  the  measurement  is  representative,  so  samples  should  be  taken
from the top and bottom of the liquid flowline, and a comparison should be made.

The  shrinkage  factor,  used  to  relate  separator-liquid  volumes  to  stock-tank  conditions,  de-
pends  on  a  differential  liberation  of  gas  and  may  give  different  values  from  the  true  flash
process as separator liquid enters the tank stage. In normal circumstances, it is thus much bet-
ter to rely on a separator flow rate measured with a calibrated meter than to use the tank flow
rate corrected according to the shrinkage tester. In the worst case, with no reliable liquid flow
rates at separator conditions, an experimental shrinkage factor must be determined in the labo-
ratory and used with the average tank flow rate to obtain the necessary rate.

Further details of proper oil- and gas-measurement practices are available elsewhere in this
Handbook and in other sources.1,2 Table 4.5 provides a checklist that can ensure that surface-
measurement data are as reliable as possible. Other surface measurements should be validated
in  similar  fashion;  for  example,  wellhead  pressures  should  be  measured  with  a  dead-weight
tester or with a pressure gauge that has been calibrated recently.

Among the downhole measurements, it is the reservoir temperature that is the most impor-
tant for fluid studies because this is the temperature at which reservoir-fluid-property measure-
ments will be made. In addition, pressures, gradients (density, pressure, and temperature), and,
indeed,  the  depth  at  which  these  measurements  are  made  are  all  important  in  validating  sam-
ples  and  in  interpreting  laboratory  measurements.  Downhole  temperature  and  pressure  gauges
should be calibrated, under well conditions if possible, and adequate time allowed for tempera-
tures  to  stabilize  if  fluid  production  or  injection  has  influenced  downhole  temperatures.  Good
knowledge of temperatures in a reservoir may only be available once measurements have been
made in several wells.

I-204

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

The data listed in Tables 4.6 and 4.7 must be considered essential if fluid samples are to
be  studied  properly  in  the  laboratory.  These  data  are  the  absolute  minimum  needed  for  valid
laboratory  studies.  Every  attempt  should  be  made  to  provide  all  the  information  requested  on
sampling sheets. An independent check at the wellsite is advisable to ensure that sampling per-
sonnel have achieved this need. Many additional measurements are of value in sample valida-
tion,  and  measurement  trends  with  time  are  important  in  monitoring  well  behavior  (such  as
during  cleanup  or  when  evaluating  the  effect  of  changes  in  production).  To  enable  a  proper
check to be made of well conditioning, separator stability, and data recorded on the sampling
sheets, it is recommended that a full copy of the well-test report (or records of production data
for production facilities) be sent to the laboratory that will be working on the samples.

Water can be produced in a surface separator—either from liquid water in the zone being
tested  or  by  condensation  from  water  vapor  in  the  produced  gas,  or  possibly  from  both—and
can affect measurement accuracy. The effect of water on gas gravity (and, thus, the gas flow
rate) is currently ignored because it is not routinely measured either in the field or in the labo-
ratory.  In  most  cases,  this  is  an  acceptable  approach,  but  in  separators  operating  at  high
temperatures and low pressures, the water content of the gas stream can reach significant pro-
portions  (for  further  details,  refer  to  the  nomogram15  “Water  content  of  hydrocarbon  gas”).

Chapter 4—Fluid Sampling

I-205

Water  production  can  have  more  serious  consequences  if  separator-liquid  flow  rates  are  not
properly corrected for BS&W measurements.

The data in Table 4.8 should be recorded for the sampling of water from a well. Similar

data should be recorded for water samples taken from other installations or facilities.

4.10 Quality Control of Samples

4.10.1 Selecting Samples for Study.  This is an area in which there have been significant im-
provements  in  recent  years,  with  significantly  more  details  of  quality-control  tests  being
reported by laboratories, yet only limited information has been published on the aspect of fluid
sampling.16  This  section  highlights  the  principal  controls  that  should  be  performed  and  gives
guidelines  for  selecting  which  samples  are  most  likely  to  be  representative.  Newer  concerns
involve  the  quality  of  formation-test  samples  from  wells  drilled  with  OBM.  Because  of  the
wide range of fluids and sampling conditions, comparison of duplicate (or, more correctly, repli-
cate) samples is generally the best method of evaluating whether the sample is representative.

The primary objectives must be selection of a fluid that is most representative of the reser-
voir  fluid  and  identification  of  any  serious  quality  problems  related  to  the  samples  or  the
sampling data; these problems must be communicated to the client before proceeding with the
fluid study.

Poor  sample  quality  can  arise  from  such  sources  as  sampling  nonrepresentative  fluid,  hu-
man error during sampling or field transfers, contaminated sample containers, and leaks during
shipment.

For separator-gas samples, the quality checks that should be made when the sample bottles
have been heated to, or slightly above, separator temperature are (1) determination of opening

I-206

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

pressure;  (2)  compositional  analysis,  including  air  content;  and  (3)  determination  of  residual
liquids, possibly from carry-over.

Separator  liquids  transported  with  a  gas  cap  must  be  homogenized  by  pressurization  and
agitation. In this instance, the controls that must be performed are (1) determination of initial
opening pressure; (2) determination of bubblepoint pressure at ambient or (preferably) separator
temperature;  (3)  a  check  for  presence  of  sediments  or  an  aqueous  phase;  and,  when  feasible,
(4) flash separation to give GOR, shrinkage, gas gravity, or composition.

Downhole  samples  should  be  checked  in  the  same  way,  except  that  bubblepoint  pressure
can be measured at either ambient or reservoir temperature. Measurement at reservoir tempera-
ture takes longer but is preferable for comparisons with downhole static or flowing pressures.

Chapter 4—Fluid Sampling

I-207

Ambient bubblepoint-pressure estimates are often available from field transfers, but they should
be  used  only  as  a  guide  because  thorough  mixing  of  the  sample  may  not  be  achieved  during
recompression, and temperatures may be unstable. In downhole samples of a highly volatile oil
or a gas condensate, no “break point” will be seen on the recompression curve, and a satura-
tion pressure must be determined in a windowed PVT cell.

The following are parameters that should be used, in order of preference, when a sample is
selected on the basis of sample quality alone (i.e., when samples are essentially duplicates col-
lected  at  the  same  time  and  under  the  same  conditions):  (1)  an  adequate  sample  volume  or
pressure;  (2)  a  downhole  sample  bubblepoint  pressure  lower  than  downhole  pressure  during
sampling; (3) contamination levels lower than, or similar to, duplicate samples; (4) bottle open-
ing  pressures  that  agree  with  sampling  data  (i.e.,  leaks  are  unlikely);  (5)  surface  sample
bubblepoint pressures that agree with separator data; (6) a close correlation between laboratory
measurements on duplicate samples; and (7) one sample that represents “average” properties of
duplicates.

For gas and oil samples collected from a separator, if at all possible, production test reports
or other documentation should be studied in addition to the sampling sheets that normally ac-
company  samples  because  a  high  proportion  of  sampling  sheets  contain  inconsistencies.  Data
should be studied with the following objectives: (1) to identify what well or plant conditioning
has been performed; (2) to look for the stability of gas and liquid rates when the surface sam-
ples were taken and, possibly, to calculate averages at the time the samples were taken; (3) to
ensure that the GOR is based on oil flow rate at separator conditions; (4) to determine which
gas gravity and nonideality (Z) factors were used, as well as the reference pressure and temper-
ature; and (5) to verify reservoir temperature and static pressure.

If all samples meet the quality criteria, the choice can be made on the basis of field data
alone, although the selection tends to be a compromise in some cases. Both operator and labo-
ratory  personnel  must  be  involved  in  these  choices.  Primary  emphasis  should  be  given  to  (1)
samples collected after proper well conditioning, (2) surface oil and gas samples taken simulta-
neously or close together, (3) a downhole sample that was collected above its bubblepoint that
compares well with the bubblepoint pressure for duplicate samples, (4) a good downhole sam-
ple  in  preference  to  a  recombined  surface  sample,  and  (5)  a  recombined  surface  sample  if
doubt exists about the quality of downhole samples. In cases in which downhole samples have
been  backed  up  by  surface  samples  (an  excellent  practice),  creation  of  a  recombined  surface
sample from the best surface samples might be worthwhile, especially if there are only one or
two downhole samples that appear to be valid. This allows comparison of the recombined sur-
face sample with the downhole samples. In fact, in important wells, complete analyses of the
two types of reservoir-fluid samples might be useful. Such an approach can give a high level
of confidence in the data and could provide a crosscheck of separator GORs.

All validation data and analyses do not need to be included in the report when laboratory
measurements  are  reported,  but  it  is  good  practice  to  use  a  minimum  of  one  page  to  explain
sample  selection  and  to  detail  any  quality  or  field-data  problems.  This  information  can  be  of
major value to engineers using the measured data.

Wells drilled with OBM are particularly problematic for formation-test-tool sample quality,
and many research and development (R&D) centers worldwide are working on correction tech-
niques. Figs. 4.10 and 4.11 demonstrate the sort of contamination that can occur; because the
base oil is miscible with reservoir oil, it is impossible to remove this contamination from sam-
ples.  It  is  essential  to  perform  “fingerprint”-type  gas  chromatography  (GC)  analyses  as  a
minimum quality control on formation-test samples to provide a qualitative indication of con-
tamination,  and  even  on  production-test  samples  for  which  thorough  cleanup  may  not  have
been achieved.

Special  correction  techniques  are  increasingly  used  within  the  oil  industry,  and  because
these techniques vary between organizations and laboratories, sample selection should be done
only  after  considering  which  method  to  use.  Many  companies  are  forced  to  use  oil-based
drilling muds to manage drilling costs in water-sensitive formations, and the added expense of
handling contaminated samples (and the risk associated with poorer-quality data) must be used
to evaluate the overall economic balance.

For water samples, comparisons of duplicates also give a good indication of quality. Where
fluid concentration may be stabilizing (e.g., at the end of a cleanup), sequential samples should
be  used  to  look  for  compositional  trends  and  thus  to  help  decide  if  representative  fluid  has
been  sampled.  For  some  sampling  procedures  involving  trapping  or  precipitation  of  particular
components,  it  is  highly  recommended  to  use  blank  “samples,”  which  undergo  exactly  the
same treatment and storage as the actual sample and provide a reference measurement to assist
with the interpretation of laboratory measurements. More details are available in API RP 45.10

Although  this  chapter  concentrates  on  sampling  rather  than  on  analytical  measurements,  it
is worth providing simple quality-control guidelines for GC here. This is because of the impor-
tance of GC analytical techniques both in the quality-control procedures described above and,
increasingly, in on-site measurements and because simple guidelines of the sort given in Table
4.9 are not widely reported.

4.10.2 Selecting Fluid Samples for Storage.  Decisions concerning sample storage involve the
following constraints: (1) discarding samples may prevent future measurements or checking of
dubious results; (2) long-term storage of pressurized samples may incur very high rental costs;
(3)  sample-bottle  purchase  involves  higher  “short-term”  cost  (instead  of  long-term  rental
charges)  but  may  sidestep  the  issue  of  deciding  on  a  long-term  storage  policy;  and  (4)  long-
term storage requires a safe storage area and a catalog to be maintained (subcontracting is an
option to be considered by producers).

One policy could be to keep duplicate samples for a short length of time on a rental basis
and  then  to  transfer  minimum  sample  quantities  into  bottles  purchased  specifically  for  long-
term storage. In all cases, it is advisable to budget for long-term storage within the project costs.
A good approach is for the laboratory report to recommend which samples should be kept
or discarded on the basis of the quality checks and the study itself. An initial selection can be
made at the end of the study, or even at the quality-control stage, if useless samples are identi-
fied. Then, the “customer” can respond on the basis of this information and the other needs of
the project.

Further measurements may be warranted for a number of reasons: doubts about initial mea-
surements;  measurements  required  at  different  temperature  or  pressure  conditions;  advanced
PVT  measurements  that  are  deemed  necessary  (interfacial  tension,  phase  diagram,  etc.);  new
analytical techniques that are developed before the reservoir is developed; or an asset purchase
or joint venture that changes needs or requires independent measurements.

Because of the complexity of the heavy components in reservoir fluids, it is impossible to
make  an  adequate  synthetic  mixture  based  on  the  liquid  composition  determined.  It  is  thus
good  practice  to  store  at  least  1L  of  stock-tank  liquid.  This  can  be  stored  cheaply  in  a  low-
pressure closed container, but it also could be blended with a synthetic gas mixture (based on
separator-gas and stock-tank gas analyses) to recreate a sample close to the original fluid com-
position, if further work was eventually required on the reservoir fluid itself.

I-210

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

A small volume (e.g., 100 cm3) of separator gas should be stored under pressure in case more-
accurate or new analytical measurements are required on the gas later. For a downhole sample,
a flash separation can be made at a convenient pressure to generate a suitable gas sample for
storage.

Note that the quantities specified above are recommended in the case that no further labora-
tory  measurements  are  anticipated.  If  further  work  appears  likely,  appropriate  quantities  of
samples should be stored in addition to these minimum volumes.

This work recommends that a suitable sample-storage policy be identified and implemented

in operating companies.

4.11 Hazards
No text covering fluid sampling would be complete without reference to the numerous hazards
that must be considered when establishing safe working practices and sampling programs. Like
many areas of the petroleum industry, if not managed properly, hazards can lead to equipment
damage  or  loss,  personal  injury,  and  even  death.  Common  hazards  include  the  following
(though  this  list  is  not  exhaustive  and  may  not  cover  unusual  locations  or  special  operating
practices).

Hydrogen  Sulfide  (H2S).  This  poisonous  chemical  is  present  in  numerous  hydrocarbon
reservoirs  and  can  be  present  both  in  gas  streams  and  dissolved  in  hydrocarbon  liquids.  Al-
though  H2S  is  recognizable  by  its  smell  at  the  low  parts  per  million  (ppm)  level,  above
approximately  100  ppm  the  human  nose  becomes  insensitive  to  the  gas,  and  personnel  could
easily be exposed to lethal levels of H2S (700 ppm can lead to instant death) if proper safety
equipment is not in use. Safety measures should range from automatic alarm systems, personal
monitors,  and  evacuation  equipment  to  positive-pressure  breathing  systems,  depending  on  the
exact nature of the risk.

High  Pressures.  Fluid  sampling  frequently  involves  pressures  up  to  10,000  psi  (700  bar),
and  even  higher  pressures  are  becoming  increasingly  common.  Basic  precautions  should  in-
volve  careful  checking  that  equipment  has  a  working  pressure  rating  compatible  with  the
maximum  pressure  that  can  be  encountered  at  a  sampling  point  (beware  that  flowing  streams
can produce a “hammer” effect when valves are closed suddenly), routine wearing of eye pro-
tection, and releasing of pressure before tightening leaking connections and attaching the ends
of lines used to vent pressure.

Flammable  Materials.  Reservoir-fluid  samples  contain  combustible  hydrocarbons,  so  care
must be taken to eliminate all sources of ignition from areas in which samples are collected or
stored, especially where hydrocarbons are released during the purging of lines. Equipment must
never be pressurized with oxygen or air (e.g., to clear blockages), as this can result in autoigni-
tion of heavy hydrocarbons (the “diesel” effect).

Solvents. Cleaning agents may contain dangerous compounds such as chlorinated solvents,
and  indeed,  produced  fluids  may  contain  benzene.  Breathing  of  vapors  and  skin  contact  with
solvents should be avoided as much as possible. Solvents should be used as efficiently as possi-
ble, and all waste materials should be stored in closed containers before proper disposal.

Transport and Storage. Physical shocks are common during transport, so sample contain-
ers should be shipped with connecting ports plugged and exposed valves protected by endcaps.
Liquid-filled containers are at risk of developing high pressures when heated; the best protec-
tion is to collect samples so that the liquid is in two-phase condition, with a gas cap represent-
ing approximately 10% of the capacity, or to use sample containers with a special separate gas
cap. Rupture disks can be used to provide similar protection, but there is an increased risk of
sample loss and venting of hazardous material.

Other Hazards. Examples of other dangers that sampling personnel must be aware of in-
clude  offshore  operations  (special  survival  training  is  available),  lack  of  oxygen  in  enclosed
areas  where  large  volumes  of  gases  can  be  vented  (notably  nitrogen,  but  other  gases  such  as

Chapter 4—Fluid Sampling

I-211

hydrocarbons  are  an  equal  danger),  and  the  toxicity  of  mercury,  still  used  in  some  sampling
operations.

Personnel who are not trained to work safely in the presence of these or other hazards must
not undertake fluid-sampling activities. Assistance in properly managing all hazards should be
obtained from qualified safety specialists.

4.12 Special Topics in Fluid Sampling

4.12.1 Sampling of Crude-Oil Emulsions.  Samples of emulsions may be required for several
reasons, including verifying crude specifications, evaluating the performance of emulsion-treat-
ing  systems,  or  for  laboratory  testing  such  as  choice  of  demulsifiers  and  optimum  concentra-
tion.  Emulsions  frequently  must  be  sampled  under  pressure,  and  special  procedures  must  be
used  to  obtain  representative  samples.  For  crude  specification  testing,  it  is  not  important  to
maintain the integrity of the water droplets; however, the sample location point may be critical.
In general, samples should not be withdrawn from the bottom of the pipe or vessel, where free
water  may  accumulate,  affecting  the  BS&W  reading  and,  thus,  the  validity  of  the  sample.  In
addition, the sample should not be withdrawn from the top of the vessel or pipe, as it is likely
to contain primarily oil. The best position in the pipe to take an emulsion sample is from the
side at approximately midheight, preferably with a sampling probe (often known as a “quill”).
Choosing a sampling point at which there is turbulence and high fluid velocity in the pipe may
also avoid problems caused by segregation and ensure that the sample is homogeneous.

As for all sampling activities, every effort should be made to obtain representative samples.
When sampling from pressurized lines and vessels, care should be taken to ensure that emulsi-
fication  does  not  occur  during  the  sampling  process  itself.  For  example,  samples  obtained  at
the wellhead or production headers may show a high percentage of emulsion (as a consequence
of the sampling as the sample was depressurized into the sample container), whereas the actual
oil and water inside the piping may or may not be in the form of an emulsion. Also, emulsions
exhibit a wide range of stability, so samples of emulsions collected in the field may separate
partially or even totally during shipment to the laboratory.

The  best  sampling  procedure  to  use  for  samples  from  pressurized  sources,  without  further
emulsification of the liquids, is the technique based on a floating-piston cylinder, as described
in Section 4.6.5. A setup similar to that in Fig. 4.6 is used, with the hydraulic section of the
cylinder filled with a pressurizing fluid (e.g., a glycol/water mixture or a synthetic oil) and the
top  of  the  cylinder  evacuated.  Purging  of  the  sample  line  can  be  made  but  should  be  carried
out  at  a  bleed  rate.  The  sample  collection  should  be  performed  slowly  to  obtain  the  sample
with a minimum pressure drop between the cylinder and the sampling point. Alternative meth-
ods  use  a  simple  sample  cylinder  (without  any  floating  piston),  which  is  initially  filled  with
water (or mercury). Once the pressurized sample is captured, the cylinder can be depressurized,
if required, by removing further quantities of hydraulic fluid extremely slowly with little effect
on the sample.

In situations in which sampling into a pressurized container is not possible, the best method
to take an emulsion sample is to bleed the sample line very slowly into the sample container.
The idea is to minimize shear and reduce emulsification that may be caused by the sampling
procedures. Emulsions are covered in more detail elsewhere in this Handbook.

4.12.2 Waxy and Asphaltenic Fluids.  Great care should be taken in sampling fluids that have
potential  for  the  precipitation  of  wax  or  asphaltenes  because  loss  of  a  solid  or  flocculated
phase  during  sampling  or  handling  will  produce  fluids  that  are  no  longer  representative.  Be-
cause  these  tendencies  may  not  be  recognized  until  the  samples  are  being  studied,  the  same
precautions are advisable for all fluids that have not been characterized previously in detail.

I-212

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Asphaltene  problems  in  particular  are  difficult  to  predict  owing  to  a  poor  correlation  be-
tween asphaltene concentration and flocculation tendency. Because of the difficulty of homoge-
nizing  fluids  containing  flocculated  asphaltenes,  it  is  highly  recommended  that  downhole
samples be collected using single-phase samplers with the pressure raised well above reservoir
pressure by the nitrogen charge. Separator oils and atmospheric oils generally suffer from limit-
ed asphaltene deposition problems because they contain very few of the light hydrocarbons that
contribute to flocculation.

Paraffinic  or  waxy  crude  oils  can  be  extremely  difficult  to  sample,  with  separator  liquids
occasionally  solidifying  in  sampling  lines  and  equipment,  and  the  use  of  heated,  short,  large-
diameter  sampling  lines  is  recommended.  At  downhole  temperatures,  sampling  is  generally
easier, and limited availability of heated sampling tools exists. Single-phase sampling tools can
be used, especially if asphaltene and wax problems may occur, but pressure maintenance alone
will  not  prevent  wax  precipitation  on  cooling,  as  this  is  strongly  dependent  on  temperature.
Though rarer, gas/condensate reservoirs can also produce liquids that show wax-forming tenden-
cies, which require special handling procedures.

Sample bottles containing movable mixing devices are recommended in all these cases, as
returning  samples  to  original  sampling  conditions  and  agitating  for  a  lengthy  period  (e.g.,
overnight) gives the highest chance of recovering representative samples from samplers or sam-
pling cylinders.

4.12.3 On-Site Measurements.  It  is  worth  giving  some  details  of  common  on-site  measure-
ments  because  they  must  be  performed  on  representative  samples  or  sample  streams  and  are
frequently included in sampling programs.

The most common on-site gas analysis method is the “length-of-stain” detector tubes (often
called  “sniffer”  tubes  or  Drager  tubes,  after  one  of  the  suppliers)  used  primarily  for  H2S  but
available for CO2 and a wide range of other gases and vapors. This method is relatively simple
to use, and principal errors derive from incorrect use of response factors or stroke counts. The
ASTM  has  a  number  of  standards  that  apply  to  this  method,17–19  and  all  propose  a  sampling
system based on a modified polythene wash bottle (or equivalent setup) to ensure that measure-
ments  are  performed  on  a  representative  sample  stream.  Flexible  tubing  is  connected  from  a
control  valve  at  the  sample  point  to  the  wash-bottle  delivery  tube,  and  the  screw  cap  is  re-
moved (or perforated). Then, the control valve is opened slightly to allow gas to flow into the
bottom of the wash bottle, which purges air out of the top. After purging for at least 3 min-
utes,  the  length-of-stain  detector  can  be  inserted  through  the  top  of  the  wash  bottle  and  the
pump operated to perform the measurement. This arrangement ensures that the gas sampled is
at atmospheric pressure. Detector tubes have a limited life and should not be used beyond the
date  limit.  Care  must  be  taken  to  avoid  contacting  any  liquids  with  the  end  of  the  tube.  An
alternative  approach  used  a  gas  bag,  which  must  be  made  from  an  inert  material  and  purged
completely at least five times immediately before the measurement. In some circumstances, gas
concentrations  above  the  detector-tube  limit  can  be  estimated  by  using  fewer  or  fractional
pump strokes, but such practices must be recorded clearly to help interpret measurements. For
reactive species like H2S, there is significant justification for making on-site concentration mea-
surements by two independent techniques, as this provides on-site quality assurance.20

Portable  gas  chromatographs  are  becoming  more  common  at  the  wellsite,  and  they  bring
the  advantage  of  early  characterization  of  gas  composition,  together  with  an  identification  of
most nonhydrocarbons present (depending on the carrier gas used). However, such instruments
are accurate only when operated by trained personnel and when properly calibrated. Also, the
additional cost of the service must be justified, though this could occur in the following cases:
(1) high nitrogen or helium is anticipated, (2) early decisions must be made on the basis of gas
sales value, (3) variable nonhydrocarbon concentrations occur within a field and will contribute

Chapter 4—Fluid Sampling

I-213

to property mapping or be used to determine if fluid sampling is required, or (4) sample trans-
port logistics mean that laboratory analyses may take a very long time.

The  possibility  of  sulfate-reducing  bacteria  (SRB)  contaminating  completion  fluids  and
even souring the reservoir itself represents a significant risk, and tests on site or sampling for
SRB  are  recommended  to  identify  and  address  potential  problems.  Tests  that  give  a  negative
result can be particularly helpful in identifying the origin of SRB development later in the life
of a field.

Many additional analytical measurements can now be performed on site because there is a
wide  variety  of  portable  chemical  test  kits  available,  especially  for  water  analysis.  However,
suitably trained operators are essential.

4.12.4 Drilling-Mud Gas.  During drilling operations, returning drilling mud is commonly mon-
itored for the presence of hydrocarbons, both for formation-evaluation purposes and for safety
concerns. Generally, hydrocarbons are extracted from the mud to provide an air sample contain-
ing  hydrocarbons,  and  as  the  extraction  technique  is  dependent  on  equipment  design  and
installation, measured compositions are rarely quantitatively representative of the concentrations
in the drilling mud. This limitation is commonly accounted for by the use of hydrocarbon ra-
tios when interpreting drilling-mud hydrocarbon analyses and logs, but it has been shown21 that
effective quantitative measurements can be obtained with careful location of the mud-sampling
point, the use of a special extraction device, and care to account for losses of hydrocarbon gas
from the return line before the mud-sampling point. Mud logging is covered in detail elsewhere
in this Handbook.

4.12.5 Water-Cut Measurements.  Downhole  sampling  can  be  used  as  a  means  to  measure
water cut in producing oil wells, especially when there are no separation facilities or suitable
measuring instruments at the wellsite or when measurements with depth are required as an al-
ternative  to  (or  validation  for)  production  logs.  In  these  cases,  the  well  should  be  flowing  at
normal producing conditions, unless the purpose of the sampling is to investigate the water cut
at other production conditions. As in all cases in which sampling is attempted from two-phase
flow,  there  is  the  potential  for  preferential  collection  of  one  of  the  phases;  this  is  especially
likely  if  the  two  phases  are  not  well  distributed.  It  may  be  advisable  to  set  the  sampler  to
collect the sample in the shortest time to minimize any segregation. Care also should be taken
in high-angle well sections, where the sampler will lie in the lowest part and is likely to sam-
ple water preferentially.

For  a  measurement  of  total  water  cut,  it  is  advisable  to  sample  from  a  depth  a  moderate
distance [e.g., 20 ft (6 m)] above the top of the perforated interval. Also, it is good practice to
take  a  number  of  separate  samples  under  identical  flow  conditions  to  allow  evaluation  of  the
repeatability of  water-cut measurements. Good  agreement between replicate samples,  although
not absolute proof, gives high confidence in the reliability of the measurements, whereas signif-
icant variation is a clear sign of unrepresentative sampling or of variable water cut in the fluids
entering the wellbore. Sampling from a range of depths both above and within the perforated
interval  in  a  well  can  provide  more-detailed  information  on  water  production,  but  it  does  not
give production-rate information on its own.

Volumetric measurement of water cut should ideally be made on site so that repeat measure-
ments  can  be  made  as  required.  If  emulsion  is  present  in  the  sampled  fluid,  this  should  be
given time to break, or suitable chemicals should be used to demulsify the sample before the
definitive water-cut measurement.

4.13 Conclusions
Optimizing costs in all petroleum-industry activities continues to have a major effect on sam-
pling  operations,  with  competition  between  production  testing  and  formation-test-tool  opera-

I-214

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

tions leading to widespread industry acceptance of lower-quality fluid samples from the latter.
A  key  challenge  at  present  is  to  get  better-quality  formation-test-tool  samples  not  simply  by
advanced tool capability but by better planning and preparation for the test. Increasing efforts
to obtain reservoir information from short well cleanups is also putting pressure on fluid-sam-
pling  operations,  but  in  some  cases  (such  as  on-site  measurements),  this  change  in  emphasis
may provide opportunities for measurements that otherwise would not be available.

Multiphase metering is likely to have an increasing impact on sampling operations because
the accuracy of flow-rate measurement is seen to be improving, and the economic benefits of
avoiding  the  use  of  separators  will  be  major.  However,  even  with  significant  development  of
special sampling approaches (such as isokinetic sampling), it seems unlikely that the same qual-
ity of samples will be available as with traditional separator methods.

Among the major developments in the past 10 to 15 years is the progress toward the world-
wide  elimination  of  the  use  of  mercury  in  fluid-sampling  operations,  producing  significant
improvements  in  personnel  safety  and  environmental  protection.  Efforts  must  continue  to
achieve better management of sampling programs and cost-efficient sample storage, despite the
difficult challenge of trying to assign monetary values to fluid samples and the measurements
made on them.

Specific technical developments that can be anticipated are a greater use of automatic surface-
sampling systems, introduction of equipment better designed to preserve reactive samples such
as fluids containing H2S, an increase in gas/condensate downhole sampling and in use of down-
hole  sampler  technology  (such  as  heated  chambers  for  sampling  waxy  fluids),  and  downhole
measurement of simplified composition and physical properties such as bubblepoint.

With  the  tremendous  pace  of  the  development  and  functionality  of  new  downhole  tools,
there is a need for speedy updating of industry standards documentation to allow broad dissem-
ination  of  new  sampling  knowledge  and  practices;  however,  it  is  clear  that  this  is  not  a  role
readily  filled  by  traditional  standards  organizations  such  as  API.  Working  groups  and  forums
involving  service  companies  and  operators  may  provide  the  best  prospect  of  developing  stan-
dards updates, which can be published in peer-reviewed petroleum engineering journals.

5.1 Molecular Weight
Molecules of a particular chemical species are composed of groups of atoms that always com-
bine according to a specific formula. The chemical formula and the international atomic weight
table  provide  us  with  a  scale  for  determining  the  weight  ratios  of  all  atoms  combined  in  any
molecule. The molecular weight, M, of a molecule is simply the sum of all the atomic weights
of  its  constituent  atoms.  It  follows,  then,  that  the  number  of  molecules  in  a  given  mass  of
material is inversely proportional to its molecular weight. Therefore, when masses of different
materials  have  the  same  ratio  as  their  molecular  weights,  the  number  of  molecules  present  is
equal.  For  instance,  2  lbm  hydrogen  contains  the  same  number  of  molecules  as  16  lbm
methane. For this reason, it is convenient to define the unit “lbm mol” as a mass of the materi-
al in pounds equal to its molecular weight. Similarly, a “g mol” is its mass in grams. One lbm
mol  or  one  g  mol  of  any  compound,  therefore,  represents  a  fixed  number  of  molecules.  This
number for the g mol was determined in 1998 by the U.S. Natl. Inst. of Standards and Technol-
ogy to be 6.02214199×1023. The number of significant digits shown is the accuracy to which it
has been determined experimentally.

5.2 Ideal Gas
The kinetic theory of gases postulates that a gas is composed of a large number of very small
discrete  particles.  These  particles  can  be  shown  to  be  identified  with  molecules.  For  an  ideal
gas, the volume of these particles is assumed to be so small that it is negligible compared with
the total volume occupied by the gas. It is assumed also that these particles or molecules have
neither  attractive  nor  repulsive  forces  between  them.  The  average  energy  of  the  particles  or
molecules can be shown to be a function of temperature only. Thus, the kinetic energy, Ek, is
independent of molecule type or size. Because kinetic energy is related to mass and velocity by
Ek=½mv2,  it  follows  that  small  molecules  (less  mass)  must  travel  faster  than  large  molecules
(more mass) when both are at the same temperature. Molecules are considered to be moving in
all directions in a random manner as a result of frequent collisions with one another and with
the walls of the containing vessel. The collisions with the walls create the pressure exerted by
the  gas.  Thus,  as  the  volume  occupied  by  the  gas  is  decreased,  the  collisions  of  the  particles
with  the  walls  are  more  frequent,  and  an  increase  in  pressure  results.  It  is  a  statement  of

I-218

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Boyle’s law that this increase in pressure is inversely proportional to the change in volume at
constant temperature:

V1
V2

=

p2
p1

, .................................................................. (5.1)

where p is the absolute pressure and V is the volume.

Further,  if  the  temperature  is  increased,  the  velocity  of  the  molecules  and,  therefore,  the
energy with which they strike the walls of the containing vessel will be increased, resulting in
a rise in pressure. To maintain the pressure constant while heating a gas, the volume must be
increased in proportion to the change in absolute temperature. This is a statement of Charles’
law,

V1
V2

=

T1
T2

, .................................................................. (5.2)

where T is the absolute temperature and p is constant.

From a historical viewpoint, the observations of Boyle and Charles in no small degree led
to the establishment of the kinetic theory of gases, rather than vice versa. It follows from this
discussion that, at zero degrees absolute, the kinetic energy of an ideal gas, as well as its vol-
ume and pressure, would be zero. This agrees with the definition of absolute zero, which is the
temperature at which all the molecules present have zero kinetic energy.

Because the kinetic energy of a molecule depends only on temperature, and not on size or
type of molecule, equal molecular quantities of different gases at the same pressure and temper-
ature would occupy equal volumes. The volume occupied by an ideal gas therefore depends on
three  things:  temperature,  pressure,  and  number  of  molecules  (moles)  present.  It  does  not  de-
pend  on  the  type  of  molecule  present.  The  ideal-gas  law,  which  is  actually  a  combination  of
Boyle’s and Charles’ laws, is a statement of this fact:

pV = nRT, ................................................................. (5.3)

where p = pressure, V = volume, n = number of moles, R = gas-law constant, and T = absolute
temperature.

The gas-law constant, R, is a proportionality constant that depends only on the units of p,
V,  n,  and  T.  Tables  5.1a  through  5.1c  present  different  values  of  R  for  the  various  units  of
these parameters. The value of the gas constant is experimental, and more-accurate values are
reported occasionally. The values in Tables 5.1a through 5.1c are based on the values reported
by Moldover et al.1 Their value was determined from measurements of the speed of sound in
argon  as  a  function  of  pressure  at  the  temperature  of  the  triple  point  of  water.  Note  that  be-
cause pV has the units of energy, the value of R is typically given in units of energy per mole
per absolute temperature unit [e.g., the appropriate SI value for R is 8.31447 J/(g mol-K), and
the appropriate British gravitational (sometimes called the American customary units) value for
R is 1,545.35 ft-lbf/(lb-mol°R)]. However, sometimes pressure and volume units are more ap-
propriate, such as R = 10.7316 (psia-ft3)/ (lb mol-°R).

5.3 Critical Temperature and Pressure
Typical pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) relationships for a pure fluid are illustrated in Fig.
5.1. The curve segment B-C-D defines the limits of vapor/liquid coexistence, with B-C being
the bubblepoint curve of the liquid and C-D being the dewpoint curve of the vapor. Any com-

Chapter 5—Gas Properties

I-219

bination of temperature, pressure, and volume above that line segment indicates that the fluid
exists  in  a  single  phase.  At  low  temperatures  and  pressures,  the  properties  of  equilibrium  va-
pors and liquids are extremely different (e.g., the density of a gas is low, while that of a liquid
is relatively high). As the pressure and temperature are increased along the coexistence curves,
liquid density, viscosity, and other properties generally decrease while vapor density and viscos-
ity generally increase. Thus, the difference in the physical properties of the coexisting phases
decreases.  These  changes  continue  as  the  temperature  and  pressure  are  raised  until  a  point  is
reached at which the properties of the equilibrium vapor and liquid become equal. The temper-
ature,  pressure,  and  volume  at  this  point  are  called  the  “critical”  values  for  that  species.
Location  C  on  Fig.  5.1  is  the  critical  point.  The  critical  temperature  and  pressure  are  unique
values for each species and are useful in correlating physical properties. Critical constants for
some  of  the  commonly  occurring  hydrocarbons  and  other  components  of  natural  gas  can  be
found in Table 5.2.

5.4 Specific Gravity (Relative Density)
The specific gravity of a gas, γ, is the ratio of the density of the gas at standard pressure and
temperature to the density of air at the same standard pressure and temperature. The standard
temperature is usually 60°F, and the standard pressure is usually 14.696 psia. However, slightly
different standards are sometimes used in different locations and in different units. The ideal-
gas laws can be used to show that the specific gravity (ratio of densities) is also equal to the
ratio of the molecular weights. By convention, specific gravities of all gases at all pressures are

I-220

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

usually  set  equal  to  the  ratio  of  the  molecular  weight  of  the  gas  to  that  of  air  (28.967).  Al-
though specific gravity is used throughout this chapter, this traditional term is not used under
the SI system; it has been replaced by “relative density.”

5.5 Mole Fraction and Apparent Molecular Weight of Gas Mixtures
The analysis of a gas mixture can be expressed in terms of a mole fraction, yi, of each compo-
nent, which is the ratio of the number of moles of a given component to the total number of
moles  present.  Analyses  also  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  volume,  weight,  or  pressure
fraction of each component present. Under limited conditions, where gaseous mixtures conform
reasonably well to the ideal-gas laws, the mole fraction can be shown to be equal to the vol-
ume fraction but not to the weight fraction. The apparent molecular weight of a gas mixture is
equal to the sum of the mole fraction times the molecular weight of each component.

5.6 Specific Gravity of Gas Mixtures
The specific gravity (γg) of a gas mixture is the ratio of the density of the gas mixture to that
of air. It is measured easily at the wellhead in the field and therefore is used as an indication
of the composition of the gas. As mentioned earlier, the specific gravity of gas is proportional
to its molecular weight (Mg) if it is measured at low pressures where gas behavior approaches

Chapter 5—Gas Properties

I-221

ideality.  Specific  gravity  also  has  been  used  to  correlate  other  physical  properties  of  natural
gases. To do this, it is necessary to assume that the analyses of gases vary regularly with their
gravities.  Because  this  assumption  is  only  an  approximation  and  is  known  to  do  poorly  for
gases  with  appreciable  nonhydrocarbon  content,  it  should  be  used  only  in  the  absence  of  a
complete analysis or of correlations based on a complete analysis of the gas.

5.7 Dalton’s Law
The  partial  pressure  of  a  gas  in  a  mixture  of  gases  is  defined  as  the  pressure  that  the  gas
would  exert  if  it  alone  were  present  at  the  same  temperature  and  volume  as  the  mixture.
Dalton’s law states that the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in a mixture is equal to
the total pressure of the mixture. This law can be shown to be true if the ideal-gas laws apply.

5.8 Amagat’s Law
The partial volume of a gas in a mixture of gases is defined as the volume that the gas would
occupy  if  it  alone  were  present  at  the  same  temperature  and  pressure  as  the  mixture  of  the
gases.  If  the  ideal-gas  laws  hold,  then  Amagat’s  law  (that  the  sum  of  the  partial  volumes  is
equal to the total volume) also must be true.

Fig. 5.1—A typical pressure/volume diagram for pure components.

5.9 Real Gases
At  low  pressures  and  relatively  high  temperatures,  the  volume  of  most  gases  is  so  large  that
the  volume  of  the  molecules  themselves  may  be  neglected.  Also,  the  distance  between
molecules is so great that the presence of even fairly strong attractive or repulsive forces is not
sufficient to affect the behavior in the gas state. However, as the pressure is increased, the total
volume  occupied  by  the  gas  becomes  small  enough  that  the  volume  of  the  molecules  them-
selves  is  appreciable  and  must  be  considered.  Also,  under  these  conditions,  the  distance
between the molecules is decreased to the point at which the attractive or repulsive forces be-
tween the molecules become important. This behavior negates the assumptions required for ideal-
gas behavior, and serious errors are observed when comparing experimental volumes to those
calculated with the ideal-gas law. Consequently, a real-gas law was formulated (in terms of a
correction to the ideal-gas law) by use of a proportionality term.

5.10 Real-Gas Law
The volume of a real gas is usually less than what the volume of an ideal gas would be at the
same temperature and pressure; hence, a real gas is said to be supercompressible. The ratio of
the  real  volume  to  the  ideal  volume,  which  is  a  measure  of  the  amount  that  the  gas  deviates
from perfect behavior, is called the supercompressibility factor, sometimes shortened to the com-
pressibility  factor.  It  is  also  called  the  gas-deviation  factor  and  given  the  symbol  z.  The  gas-
deviation factor is by definition the ratio of the volume actually occupied by a gas at a given
pressure and temperature to the volume it would occupy if it behaved ideally, or:

z = Actual volume of gas at specified T and p

Ideal volume of gas at same T and p

...................................... (5.4)

Note that the numerator and denominator of Eq. 5.4 refer to the same mass. (This equation for
the z factor is also used for liquids.) Thus, the real-gas equation of state is written:

pV = znRT.................................................................. (5.5)

I-224

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

The  gas-deviation  factor,  z,  is  close  to  1  at  low  pressures  and  high  temperatures,  which
means  that  the  gas  behaves  as  an  ideal  gas  at  these  conditions.  At  standard  or  atmospheric
conditions, the gas z factor is always approximately 1. As the pressure increases, the z factor
first decreases to a minimum, which is approximately 0.27 for the critical temperature and criti-
cal  pressure.  For  temperatures  of  1.5  times  the  critical  temperature,  the  minimum  z  factor  is
approximately 0.77, and for temperatures of twice the critical temperature, the minimum z fac-
tor  is  0.937.  At  high  pressures,  the  z  factor  increases  above  1,  where  the  gas  is  no  longer
supercompressible.  At  these  conditions,  the  specific  volume  of  the  gas  is  becoming  so  small,
and the distance between molecules is much smaller, so that the density is more strongly affect-
ed  by  the  volume  occupied  by  the  individual  molecules.  Hence,  the  z  factor  continues  to
increase above unity as the pressure increases.

Tables of compressibility factors are available for most pure gases as functions of tempera-
ture  and  pressure.  Compressibility  factors  for  mixtures  (or  unknown  pure  compounds)  are
measured  easily  in  a  Burnett2  apparatus  or  a  variable-volume  PVT  equilibrium  cell.  The  gas-
deviation factor, z, is determined by measuring the volume of a sample of the natural gas at a
specific  pressure  and  temperature,  then  measuring  the  volume  of  the  same  quantity  of  gas  at
atmospheric pressure and at a temperature sufficiently high so that the hydrocarbon mixture is
in the vapor phase. Tables of compressibility factors are available for most pure gases as func-
tions  of  temperature  and  pressure.  Excellent  correlations  are  also  available  for  the  calculation
of compressibility factors. For this reason, compressibility factors are no longer routinely mea-
sured  on  dry-gas  mixtures  or  on  most  of  the  leaner  wet  gases.  Rich-gas/condensate  systems
require  other  equilibrium  studies,  and  compressibility  factors  can  be  obtained  routinely  from
these data.

If the gas-deviation factor is not measured, it may be estimated from correlations. The cor-
relations depend on the pseudoreduced temperature and pressure, which in turn depend on the
pseudocritical temperature and pseudocritical pressure. The pseudocritical temperature and pseu-
docritical pressure normally can be defined most simply as the molal average critical tempera-
ture and pressure of the mixture components. Thus,

ppc = Σyi pci and Tpc = ΣyiTci, ................................................ (5.6)

where  ppc=  pseudocritical  pressure  of  the  gas  mixture,  Tpc=  pseudocritical  temperature  of  the
gas mixture, pci= critical pressure of component i in the gas mixture, Tci=critical temperature of
component i in the gas mixture, and yi=mole fraction of component i in the gas mixture. These
relations are known as Kay’s rule after W.B. Kay,3 who first suggested their use.

The pseudocritical temperature and pressure are not the actual critical temperature and pres-
sure  of  the  mixture  but  represent  the  values  that  must  be  used  for  the  purpose  of  comparing
corresponding  states  of  different  gases  on  the  z-factor  chart  (Fig  5.2).  It  has  been  found  to
approximate the convergence of the lines of constant volume on a pressure/temperature diagram.
Sutton4  found  that  Kay’s  rules  for  the  determination  of  pseudocritical  properties  did  not
give accurate results for higher-molecular-weight mixtures of hydrocarbon gases. He found that
they resulted in errors in the z factor as high as 15%. Instead, Sutton4 proposed a modification
of a method first proposed by Stewart et al.5 Sutton’s4 method is to first define and determine
the pseudocritical properties of the C7+ fraction, then calculate the pseudocritical properties of
the mixture as follows:

If the composition of the gas is unknown, then a correlation to estimate pseudocritical tem-
perature and pseudocritical pressure values from the specific gravity is used. There are several
different correlations available, but Fig. 5.3 was developed by Sutton4 on the basis of 264 dif-
ferent gas samples. Sutton also used regression analysis on the raw data to obtain the following
second-order fit for the pseudocritical properties of hydrocarbon mixtures:

Fig. 5.4—Gas-deviation factors for natural gases at pressures of 10,000 to 20,000 psia.7

These  equations  and  Fig  5.3  are  valid  over  the  range  of  specific-gas  gravities  with  which
Sutton4 worked: 0.57 < γg < 1.68. Using the obtained pseudocritical values, the pseudoreduced
pressure and temperature are calculated using

pr = p

The  gas-deviation  factor  is  then  found  by  using  the  well-known  correlation  chart  of  Fig.
5.2, originally developed by Standing and Katz.6 Compressibility factors of high-pressure natu-
ral gases (10,000 to 20,000 psia) may be obtained from Fig. 5.4, which was developed by Katz
et al.7 Figs. 5.5 and 5.6 may be used for low-pressure applications after Brown et al.8

Dranchuk and Abou-Kassem9 fitted an equation of state to the data of Standing and Katz,6
which  is  more  convenient  for  estimating  the  gas-deviation  factor  in  computer  programs  and
spreadsheets.  Hall  and  Yarborough10  also  have  published  an  alternative equation of  state. The
Dranchuk and Abou-Kassem9 equation of state is based on the generalized Starling equation of

A9 = 0.1056; A10 = 0.6134; and A11 = 0.7210.

Dranchuk and Abou-Kassem9 found an average absolute error of 0.486% in their equation,
with a standard deviation of 0.00747 over ranges of pseudoreduced pressure and temperature of
0.2 < ppr < 30; 1.0 < Tpr < 3.0; and for ppr < 1.0 with 0.7 < Tpr < 1.0.

Dranchuk and Abou-Kassem9 also found that this equation and other equations of state give
unacceptable results near the critical temperature for Tpr = 1.0 and ppr >1.0, so these equations
are not recommended in this range.

Because  the  parameter  z  is  embedded  in  ρr,  an  iterative  solution  is  necessary  to  solve  the
Dranchuk  and  Abou-Kassem  equation  of  state,  but  this  can  be  programmed.  An  example  of
this is provided by Dranchuk and Abou-Kassem.9 The equation also can be solved on a spread-
sheet using the nonlinear-equation-solver option, which is discussed in more detail elsewhere.11
Nonlinear equation solvers are also set up specifically to solve these equations easily.

The  z-factor  chart  of  Standing  and  Katz  (Fig  5.2)  and  the  pseudocritical  property-calcula-
tion methods of Sutton4 are valid only for mixtures of hydrocarbon gases. Wichert and Aziz12
have developed a correlation to account for inaccuracies in the Standing and Katz chart when
the gas contains significant fractions of acid gases, specifically carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydro-
gen sulfide (H2S). The Wichert and Aziz12 correlation modifies the values of the pseudocritical
temperature and pressure of the gas. Once the modified pseudocritical properties are obtained,

they  are  used  to  calculate  pseudoreduced  properties,  and  the  z  factor  is  determined  from  Fig.
5.2 or Eq. 5.10. The Wichert and Aziz12 correlation first calculates a deviation parameter ε:

ε = 120(A0.9 − A1.6) + 15(B0.5 − B4), ........................................... (5.17)

where A = the sum of the mole fractions of CO2 and H2S in the gas mixture and B = the mole
fraction  of  H2S  in  the  gas  mixture.  Then,  the  value  of  ε  is  used  to  determine  the  modified
pseudocritical properties as follows:

The correlation is valid only in units of T in R and p in psia. It is applicable to concentrations
of  CO2  <  54.4  mol%  and  H2S  <  73.8  mol%.  Note  that  ε  also  has  units  of  R.  The  correction
factor,  ε,  has  been  plotted  against  H2S  and  CO2  concentrations  in  Fig.  5.7  for  convenience.
Note that maximum correction occurs around A = B = 47% or 47% H2S concentration and 0%
CO2 concentration. Wichert and Aziz12 found their correlation to have an average absolute er-
ror  of  0.97%  over  the  following  ranges  of  data:  154  psia  <  p  <  7,026  psia  and  40°F  <  T  <

Piper et al.13 have also adapted the Stewart et al.5 method to develop equations that can be

and  the  Wichert  and  Aziz12  correction,  and  (b)  the  method  of  Piper  et  al.,13  calculate  the  z
factor for a gas with the following properties and conditions:

γg = 0.7, H2S = 7%, and CO2 = 10%; p = 2,010 psia and T = 75°F.
Solution. (a) First, calculate the pseudocritical properties.

Next,  calculate  the  adjustments  to  the  pseudocritical  properties  using  the  Wichert  and

Finally, looking up the z-factor chart (Fig 5.3) gives z = 0.745.

The two methods give results that differ by 3.6% of the smaller value (z = 0.745), which is
within the range of accuracy of either method. Because the method of Piper et al.13 is based on
a  larger  data  set  and  has  integrated  the  nonhydrocarbon  compositions  into  the  method,  it  is
likely to be more accurate.

5.11 Gas Density and Formation Volume Factor
The formation volume factor of gas is defined as the ratio of the volume of gas at the reservoir
temperature and pressure to the volume at the standard or surface temperature and pressure (ps
and Ts). It is given the symbol Bg and is often expressed in either cubic feet of reservoir vol-
ume  per  standard  cubic  foot  of  gas  or  barrels  of  reservoir  volume  per  standard  cubic  foot  of
gas.  The  gas-deviation  factor  is  unity  at  standard  conditions;  hence,  the  equation  for  the  gas
formation volume factor can be calculated using the real gas equation:

Bg =

VR
Vsc

= znRT
p

=

psczT

The n divides out here because both volumes refer to the same quantity of mass.

When  ps  is  1  atm  (14.696  psia  or  101.325  kPa)  and  Ts  is  60°F  (519.67°R  or  288.71°K),

this equation can be written in three well-known standard forms:

Bg = 0.0282793 zT
= 0.00503676 zT
= 0.350958 zT

p rcf/ scf
p RB/ scf
p Rm3/ Sm3, ................................................ (5.25)

where rcf/scf = reservoir cubic feet per standard cubic feet, RB = reservoir barrels, and Rm3/
Sm3 = reservoir cubic meters per standard cubic meters. The formation volume factor is always
in units of reservoir volumes per standard volumes.

The three forms in Eq. 5.25 are for specific units. In the first two equation forms, the pres-
sure is in psia and the temperature is in °R. In the third form, the pressure is in kPa and the
temperature is in K.

The  density  of  a  reservoir  gas  is  defined  as  the  mass  of  the  gas  divided  by  its  reservoir

volume, so it can also be derived and calculated from the real-gas law:

5.12 Isothermal Compressibility of Gases
The isothermal gas compressibility, cg, is a useful concept that is used extensively in determin-
ing  the  compressible  properties  of  the  reservoir.  The  isothermal  compressibility  is  also  the
reciprocal of the bulk modulus of elasticity. Gas usually is the most compressible medium in
the  reservoir;  however,  care  should  be  taken  so  that  it  is  not  confused  with  the  gas-deviation
factor, z, which is sometimes called the compressibility factor.

The isothermal gas compressibility is defined as:

I-234

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

cg = − 1

Vg(∂Vg

........................................................... (5.27)

An expression in terms of z and p for the compressibility can be derived from the real-gas law

For gases at low pressures, the second term is small, and the isothermal compressibility can
be  approximated  by  cg  ≈  1/p.  Eq.  5.30  is  not  particularly  convenient  for  determining  the  gas
compressibility because in Fig 5.2 and Eq. 5.16, z is not actually expressed as a function of p
but of pr. However, Eq. 5.30 can be made more convenient when written in terms of a dimen-
sionless, pseudoreduced gas compressibility defined as

cr = cg ppc................................................................. (5.31)

Multiplying Eq. 5.30 through by the pseudocritical pressure gives

cr = cg ppc = 1

Charts  of  the  pseudoreduced  gas  compressibility  have  been  published  by  Trube14  and  by
Mattar et al.,15 and two of these are shown in Figs 5.8 and 5.9. Mattar et al.15 also developed
an analytical expression for calculating the pseudoreduced compressibility; that expression is

Parameters A1 through A11 are defined after Eq. 5.16. Eq. 5.34 can then be substituted into Eq.
5.33, and the pseudoreduced gas compressibility can be calculated. Then, if the pseudoreduced
gas  compressibility  is  divided  by  the  pseudocritical  pressure,  the  gas  compressibility  is  ob-
tained analytically. Either the graphical method or the analytical method can be used, but the
analytical method is easier to apply in a spreadsheet, nonlinear solver, or other computer program.
There is also a close relationship between the formation volume factor of gas and the isother-

mal gas compressibility. It can easily be shown that

5.13 Gas Viscosity
Just as the compressibility of natural gas is much greater than that of oil, water, or rock, the
viscosity of natural gas is usually several orders of magnitude smaller than oil or water. This
makes  gas  much  more  mobile  in  the  reservoir  than  either  oil  or  water.  Reliable  correlation
charts  are  available  to  estimate  gas  viscosity.  Carr  et  al.16  have  developed  charts  (Figs.  5.10
through  5.13)  that  are  the  most  widely  used  for  estimating  the  viscosity  of  natural  gas  from
the pseudoreduced critical temperature and pressure. Fig. 5.10 gives the viscosities for individu-
al components. Fig. 5.11 gives the viscosities for gas at the desired temperature and atmospher-
ic pressure based on the temperature and specific gravity or molecular weight. The viscosity of
gas mixtures at one atmosphere and reservoir temperature can either be read from Fig. 5.11 or
determined from the gas-mixture composition with Eq. 5.36.

where μga = viscosity of the gas mixture at the desired temperature and atmospheric pressure;
yi = mole fraction of the ith component; μi = viscosity of the ith component of the gas mixture
at the desired temperature and atmospheric pressure (obtained from Fig. 5.10); Mgi = molecular
weight  of  the  ith  component  of  the  gas  mixture;  and  N  =  number  of  components  in  the  gas
mixture.

This viscosity is then multiplied by the viscosity ratio (from Fig. 5.12 or Fig. 5.13) to ob-
tain  the  viscosity  at  reservoir  temperature  and  pressure.  Note  that  Figs.  5.12  and  5.13  (from
Carr et al.16) are based on pseudocritical properties determined with Kay’s rules. It would not
be correct, then, to use the methods of Sutton4 or Piper et al.13 to calculate the pseudocritical
properties  for  use  with  those  charts.  However,  Kay’s  rules  require  a  full  gas  composition.  If
only  specific  gravity  is  known,  then  the  pseudocritical  properties  would  have  to  be  obtained
from Fig. 5.3 or Eqs. 5.13 and 5.14. The inserts of Fig. 5.11 are corrections to be added to the
atmospheric viscosity when the gas contains N2, CO2, and H2S.

Lee et al.17 developed a useful analytical method that gives a good estimate of gas viscosi-
ty for most natural gases. This method lends itself for use in computer programs and spread-
sheets.  The  method  uses  the  gas  temperature,  pressure,  z  factor,  and  molecular  weight,  which
have  to  be  measured  or  calculated;  the  density  can  be  measured  or  calculated  as  well.  The
equations of Lee et al.17 are for specific units as noted below and are as follows:

For the data from which the correlation was developed, the standard deviation in the calcu-
lated  gas  viscosity  was  2.7%,  and  the  maximum  deviation  was  9%.  The  ranges  of  variables
used in the correlation were 100 psia < p < 8,000 psia, 100 <T (°F) < 340, and 0.90 < CO2 (mol
%)  <  3.20  and  0.0  <  N2  (mol%)  <  4.80.  In  using  these  equations,  it  is  important  either  to
measure  the  density  or  to  ensure  that  the  z-factor  calculation  has  included  the  effect  of  N2,
CO2,  and  H2S  using  the  method  of  Wichert  and  Aziz.12  The  equations  of  Lee  et  al.17  were
originally  written  to  give  the  viscosity  in  micropoise,  but  the  modified  form  above  gives  the
viscosity  in  the  more  commonly  used  centipoise.  This  viscosity  unit  (cp)  is  also  easily
converted to the SI unit of Pa·s by dividing by 1,000.

(c) The viscosity is determined using the charts of Carr et al.16 in Figs. 5.10 through 5.13.
First, the viscosity for Mg = (0.7)(28.967) = 20.3 at p = 1 atm and T = 75°F is read from Fig.
5.11.  This  gives  0.0102  cp,  but  corrections  are  needed  for  the  acid  gases.  The  correction  for
10%  CO2  is  0.0005  cp,  and  the  correction  for  7%  H2S  is  0.0002  cp.  Hence,  this  gives  μga  =
0.0109 cp.

Next,  the  ratio  of  μg/μga  is  read  from  Fig.  5.13,  which  gives  μg/μga  =  1.55.  Hence,  μg  =

(1.55) (0.0109 cp) = 0.0169 cp.

(d) The compressibility is determined by first reading Fig. 5.8 or Fig. 5.9 for the previously
calculated values of pr = 3.200 and Tr = 1.500 to give crTr = 0.5. Because Tr = 1.500 then cr =
0.5/1.5 = 0.3333. Because cr = cg ppc,

cg = cr / ppc = 0.3333 / 628.21
cg = 5.306 × 10−4psi−1.

5.14 Real-Gas Pseudopotential
In  the  analysis  of  gas  reservoirs,  well-test  analysis,  gas  flow  in  pipes,  and  other  calculations
can  be  made  more  accurate  by  the  use  of  the  real-gas  pseudopotential.  This  is  because  the  z
factor and viscosity that appear in such equations along with pressure terms are dependent on
pressure. Consequently, the integral of pressure divided by the z factor and viscosity is defined
as a separate parameter called the real-gas pseudopotential and is designated here as ψ(p).

ψ(p) = 2∫po

p p
μz dp, ........................................................ (5.38)

where po is some arbritary low base pressure (typically atmospheric pressure). This integral is
usually evaluated numerically using values of z and μ for the particular gas at a particular tem-
perature.  Then,  the  pseudopotential  is  tabulated  as  a  function  of  pressure  and  temperature.
Illustrations  of  the  calculation  and  use  of  the  real-gas  pseudopotential  are  provided  elsewhere
in this Handbook.

5.15 Vapor Pressure
At a given temperature, the vapor pressure of a pure compound is the pressure at which vapor
and  liquid  coexist  at  equilibrium.  The  term  “vapor  pressure”  should  be  used  only  with  pure
compounds and is usually considered as a liquid (rather than a gas) property. For a pure com-
pound,  there  is  only  one  vapor  pressure  at  any  temperature.  A  plot  of  these  pressures  for
various  temperatures  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.14  for  n-butane.  The  temperature  at  which  the  vapor
pressure is equal to 1 atm (14.696 psia or 101.32 kPa) is known as the normal boiling point.

5.15.1 The Clapeyron Equation.  The  Clapeyron  equation  gives  a  rigorous  quantitative  rela-
tionship between vapor pressure and temperature:

dpv
dT =

Lv
TΔV , ............................................................. (5.39)

where pv=vapor pressure, T=absolute temperature, ΔV=increase in volume caused by vaporizing
1 mole, and Lv=molal latent heat of vaporization.

Assuming ideal-gas behavior of the vapor and neglecting the liquid volume, the Clapeyron

equation can be simplified over a small temperature range to give the approximation

d( ln pv)

dT

=

Lv
RT2 , .......................................................... (5.40)

which is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Integrating this equation gives

Fig. 5.14—Vapor pressure of n-butane.

∫d( ln pv) =∫

Lv
RT2 dT = ln pv =

Lv
RT + b, ...................................... (5.41)

where  b  is  a  constant  of  integration  that  depends  on  the  particular  fluid  and  the  data  range.
This equation suggests that a plot of logarithm of vapor pressure against the reciprocal of the
absolute  temperature  would  approximate  a  straight  line.  Such  a  plot  is  useful  in  interpolating
and  extrapolating  data  over  short  ranges.  However,  the  shape  of  this  relationship  for  a  real
substance  over  a  significant  temperature  range  is  more  S-shaped  than  straight.  Therefore,  the
use of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is not recommended when other methods are available,
except over short temperature ranges in regions where the ideal-gas law is valid.

5.15.2 Cox Chart.  Cox18  further  improved  the  method  of  estimating  vapor  pressure  by  plot-
ting the logarithm of vapor pressure against an arbitrary temperature scale. The vapor-pressure/
temperature  plot  forms  a  straight  line,  at  least  for  the  reference  compound  (and  usually  for
most of the materials related to the reference compound). This is especially true for petroleum
hydrocarbons. A Cox chart, using water as a reference material, is shown in Fig. 5.15. In addi-
tion  to  forming  nearly  straight  lines,  compounds  of  the  same  family  appear  to  converge  on  a
single point. Thus, it is necessary to know only vapor pressure at one temperature to estimate
the  position  of  the  vapor-pressure  line.  This  approach  is  very  useful  and  can  be  much  better
than the previous method. Its accuracy is dependent to a large degree on the readability of the
chart.

5.15.3 Calingeart and Davis Equation.  The Cox chart was fit with a three-parameter function
by Calingeart and Davis.19 Their equation is

ln pv = A −

B
T − C , ........................................................ (5.42)

Chapter 5—Gas Properties

I-243

Fig. 5.15—Cox chart for normal paraffin hydrocarbons.18

where A and B are empirical constants and, for compounds boiling between 32 and 212°F, C is
a  constant  with  a  value  of  43  when  T  is  in  K  and  a  value  of  77.4  when  T  is  in  °R.  This
equation generally is known as the Antoine20 equation because Antoine proposed one of a very
similar nature that used 13 K for the constant C. Knowledge of the vapor pressure at two tem-
peratures will fix A and B and permit approximations of vapor pressures at other temperatures.
Generally,  the  Antoine  approach  can  be  expected  to  have  less  than  2%  error  and  is  the  pre-
ferred approach if the vapor pressure is expected to be less than 1,500 mm Hg (200 kPa) and
if the constants are available.

5.15.4 Lee-Kesler Equation.  Vapor  pressures  also  can  be  calculated  by  corresponding-states
principles.  The  most  common  expansions  of  the  Clapeyron  equation  lead  to  a  two-parameter
expression. Pitzer et al.21 extended the expansion to contain three parameters:

ln(pvr) = f 0(Tr) + ω f 1(Tr), .................................................. (5.43)

where pvr is the reduced vapor pressure (vapor pressure/critical pressure),  f 0 and  f 1 are func-
tions of reduced temperature, and ω is the acentric factor.

Lee and Kesler22 have expressed  f 0 and  f 1 in analytical forms:

f 0 = 5.92714 − 6.09648

Tr

−(1.28862) ln Tr + 0.169347(Tr)6......................... (5.44)

and

f 0 = 15.2518 − 15.6875

Tr

−(13.4721) ln Tr + 0.43577(Tr)6, ......................... (5.45)

I-244

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

which  can  be  solved  easily  by  computer  or  spreadsheet.  Lee-Kesler22  is  the  preferred  method
of calculation but should be used only for nonpolar liquids.

The  advent  of  computers,  calculators,  and  spreadsheets  makes  the  use  of  approximations
and charts much less advantageous than it was before the 1970s. Values of acentric factors can
be found in Poling et al.,23 who also presented many other available vapor-pressure correlations
and calculation techniques, with comments about their advantages and limitations.

(a) Calculate zg from the known composition in Table 5.5.
Using Kay’s3 rules, we obtain from the known gas composition:
Tpc =ΣyiTi = 393.8°R,

ppc =Σyipci = 662.88 psia,
ppr = p/ppc = 1,525/662.88 =2.301,
and from Fig. 5.3, zg = 0.71.
(b) From Sutton’s4 gas gravity method, γg = 0.705; then, we obtain from Eqs. 5.7 and 5.8

that

2
ppc = 756.8 − 131.07γg − 3.6γg

= 756.8 − (131.07)(0.705) − (3.6)(0.7052)

Finally, looking up the z-factor chart (Fig. 5.3) gives z = 0.745.

Conclusion. Even though the Sutton4 correlation and the Piper et al.13 correlation gave slight-
ly different critical properties, the z factors from those two methods are the same. Kay’s3 rule
gives a value that is 4.6% lower, but the result using Sutton’s4 correlation and the Piper et al.13
correlation has been shown to be more accurate. The density is then given by

(0.745)(10.7316)(534.67) = 7.286 lbm/ ft3 = 116.8 kg/ m3.

Example 5.5 Calculate the z factor for the reservoir fluid in Table 5.6 at 307°F and 6,098

psia.

The experimental value is z = 0.998.
Solution. Using the Piper et al.13 method, we first calculate J and K using

Solution  (by  the  Carr  et  al.16  Method).  First,  calculate  the  pseudocritical  properties  using
Kay’s3 rules. The charts of Carr et al.16 are based on pseudocritical properties determined with
Kay’s  rules;  it  would  not  be  correct,  then,  to  use  the  methods  of  Sutton4  or  Piper  et  al.13  to
calculate the pseudocritical properties for use with the viscosity calculation. The details are in

These parameters are then used to determine the viscosity at 1 atm. First, the viscosity for Mg
= 20.079 at p = 1 atm and T = 150°F is read from Fig. 5.11. This gives μga = 0.0114 cp, but a
correction  is  needed  for  the  nitrogen.  The  correction  for  15.8%  N2  is  0.0013  cp.  Hence,  this
gives μga = 0.0127 cp.

Next, the ratio of μg/μga is read from Fig. 5.13 using the pseudoreduced properties calculat-
ed above, which gives μg/μga = 1.32. Hence, μg = (1.32) (0.0127) = 0.0168 cp. This represents
a 2.5% error from the experimentally determined value of 0.0172 cp.

Solution (by the Lee et al.17 Method). In this method, the z factor is required; this is most

accurately determined with the Piper et al.13 method, the details of which are in Table 5.10.

μg = K1 exp (XρY) = 0.012294 exp (5.3181)(0.110251.3364) = 0.01625 cp.

This  method  gives  a  value  that  is  5.5%  less  than  the  experimentally  determined  value  of
0.0172 cp.

Example 5.7 The vapor pressure of pure hexane as a function of temperature is 54.04 kPa
at 50°C and 188.76 kPa at 90°C. Estimate the vapor pressure of hexane at 100°C, using all the
methods outlined previously.

Solution:  Clausius-Clapeyron.  The  Clausius-Clapeyron  equation  can  be  solved  graphically
by  plotting  a  log  of  vapor  pressure  vs.  reciprocal  absolute  temperature  and  extrapolating.  It
also  can  be  solved  by  slopes  fitting  an  equation  of  the  form  log(pv)  =c/T+b  to  the  two  data
points. Because the other three methods must be done in American customary units, the Clausius-
Clapeyron method also will be converted to those units.

T1 = 50°C = 122°F = 581.67°R,
l/T1 = 0.0017192°R–1,
T2 = 90°C = 653.67°R,
1/T2 = 0.0015298°R–1,
pv at T1 = 54.04 kPa = 7.8374 psia,
log pv = 0.89417,

I-252

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

pv at T2 = 188.76 kPa = 27.3773 psia,
log pv = 1.43739,
Δlog pv = –0.543195,
1/T1–1/T2 = 0.00018936,
and c = slope = –0.543195/0.00018936
= –2868.52°R.
Solving for b, log pv = –2868.52/T+b yields
b = 5.8257,
T3 = 100°C = 212°F = 671.67°R,
and 1/T3 = 0.0014888.
Solving for pv at 100°C yields

log pv = − 2868.52 / T + 5.8257
= − 2868.52 (0.0014888) + 5.8257

= 1.555;

hence, pv = 35.89 psia = 247.46 kPa.
Alternatively, if the vapor pressure at 70°C is 105.37 kPa and is known, you can use the
70 to 90°C temperature differential to calculate the slope and intercept and ultimately calculate
pv = 35.79 psia = 246.79 kPa.

Solution:  Cox  Chart.18  From  Fig.  5.15,  the  vapor  pressure  at  100°C  can  be  approximated

between 35 and 36 psia. A larger chart is required for more-precise readings.

Solution: The Calingeart and Davis or Antoine Equation. This can be used by obtaining the
Antoine constants from Poling et al.23 For n-hexane, with temperature in K, these constants are
A = 15.8366, B = 2697.55, and C = –48.78. Then,

ln pv = A −

T − C = 15.8366 −

2697.55
373 − 48.78 = 3.60233,

and pv = 36.68 psia = 252.73 kPa.

Solution: Lee-Kesler. The use of the Lee-Kesler22 equation requires pc, Tc, and ω for n-hex-

ane. These can be obtained from Table 5.2.

pc = 436.9 psia (29.7 atm),
Tc = 453.7°F or 913.3°R or 507.4 K,
and ω = 0.3007.
For 100°C,
Tr = 0.7351,
(Tr)6 = 0.15782,
ln Tr = –0.30775,

f 0 = 5.92714 − (6.09648/ 0.7351) + 1.28862(0.30775) + 0.169347(0.15782)

= − 1.94296,

and f 1 = 15.2518 − (15.6875/ 0.7351) + 13.4721(0.30775) + 0.43577(0.15782)

Conclusions. Lee-Kesler gives the best answer, but the Clausius-Clapeyron method is also
very accurate to within 0.17 psi, which is typical if the extrapolation is close to the appropriate
range.

Oil System Correlations

6.1 Introduction
The calculation of reserves in an oil reservoir or the determination of its performance requires
knowledge of the fluid’s physical properties at elevated pressure and temperature. Of primary
importance  are  those  properties  including  bubblepoint  pressure,  solution  gas/oil  ratio  (GOR),
and  formation  volume  factor  (FVF).  In  addition,  viscosity  and  surface  tension  must  be  deter-
mined  for  calculations  involving  the  flow  of  oil  through  pipe  or  porous  media.  Ideally,  these
properties are determined from laboratory studies designed to duplicate the conditions of inter-
est;  however,  experimental  data  are  quite  often  unavailable  because  representative  samples
cannot be obtained or the producing horizon does not warrant the expense of an in-depth reser-
voir  fluid  study.  In  these  cases,  pressure-volume-temperature  (PVT)  properties  must  be  deter-
mined by analogy or through the use of empirically derived correlations. This chapter reviews
methods for the determination of bubblepoint pressure, solution GOR, oil FVF, isothermal com-
pressibility, dead (gas-free) oil viscosity, gas-saturated (bubblepoint) oil viscosity, undersaturat-
ed  oil  viscosity,  and  gas/oil,  oil/water,  and  gas/water  surface  tension.  Table  6.1  (Refs.  1
through 28) summarizes the recommended methods for general use determination of each prop-
erty. These recommendations are based on the correlation performance derived from a common
data  set  or  the  author’s  experiences  drawn  from  using  various  correlations  for  a  number  of
years. In Appendix A, Tables A-1 through A-12 (Refs. 29 through 65) contain a comprehen-
sive and descriptive list of available correlations because specific applications could require the
use of methods other than those listed in Table 6.1.

During the last 60 years, several correlations have been proposed for determining PVT prop-
erties.  The  most  widely  used  correlations  treat  the  oil  and  gas  phases  as  a  two-component
system.  Only  the  pressure,  temperature,  specific  gravity,  and  relative  amount  of  each  compo-
nent  are  used  to  characterize  the  oil’s  PVT  properties.  Crude  oil  systems  from  various  oil-
producing regions of the world were used in the development of the correlations. These crude
oils can exhibit regional trends in chemical composition, placing them into one of the follow-
ing  groups:  paraffinic,  napthenic,  or  aromatic.  Because  of  the  differences  in  composition,
correlations  developed  from  regional  samples,  predominantly  of  one  chemical  base,  may  not
provide satisfactory results when applied to crude oils from other regions.

Hydrocarbons are classified according to the structure of the molecule.66 Paraffin hydrocar-
bons  are  characterized  by  open  or  straight  chains  joined  by  single  bonds.  Examples  are

I-258

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

methane,  ethane,  propane,  and  decane.  Isomers  of  these  compounds,  which  contain  branched
chains, are also included as paraffins. The first four members of the series are gaseous at room
temperature  and  pressure.  Compounds  ranging  from  pentane  (C5H12)  through  heptadecane
(C17H36) are liquids, while the heavier members are colorless, wax-like solids. Unsaturated hy-
drocarbons, which consist of olefins, diolefins, and acetylenes, have double and triple bonds in
the molecule. These compounds are highly reactive and are not normally present to any great
extent in crude oil. Naphthene hydrocarbons are ringed molecules and are also called cycloparaf-
fins.  These  compounds,  like  the  paraffins,  are  saturated  and  very  stable.  They  make  up  a
second primary constituent of crude oil. Aromatic hydrocarbons are also cyclic but are deriva-
tives  of  benzene.  The  rings  are  characterized  by  alternating  double  bonds  and,  in  contrast  to
olefins, are quite stable, though not as stable as paraffins. Crude oils are complex mixtures of
these  hydrocarbons.  Oils  containing  primarily  paraffin  hydrocarbons  are  called  paraffin-based
or paraffinic. Traditional examples are Pennsylvania grade crude oils. Naphthenic-based crudes
contain a large percentage of cycloparaffins in the heavy components. Examples of this type of
crude come from the United States midcontinent region. Highly aromatic crudes are less com-
mon  but  are  still  found  around  the  world.67  Crude  oils  tend  to  be  a  mixture  of  paraffins-
naphthenes-aromatics,  with  paraffins  and  naphthenes  the  predominant  species.  Fig.  6.1,
although not complete, shows a distribution of crude oil samples obtained worldwide. Geochem-
ical analyses provided the crude’s chemical nature.

Resins and asphaltenes may also be present in crude oil.69,70 Resins and asphaltenes are the
colored  and  black  components  found  in  oil  and  are  made  up  of  relatively  high-molecular-
weight,  polar,  polycyclic,  aromatic  ring  compounds.  Pure  asphaltenes  are  nonvolatile,  dry,
solid, black powders, while resins are heavy liquids or sticky solids with the same volatility as
similarly  sized  hydrocarbons.  High-molecular-weight  resins  tend  to  be  red  in  color,  while
lighter resins are less colored. Asphaltenes do not dissolve in crude oil but exist as a colloidal
suspension. They are soluble in aromatic compounds such as xylene, but will precipitate in the
presence of light paraffinic compounds such as pentane. Resins, on the other hand, are readily
soluble in oil.

No  crude  oil  has  ever  been  completely  separated  into  its  individual  components,  although
many components can be identified. Table 6.2 lists the more important compounds in a sample
of Oklahoma crude. A total of 141 compounds were identified in this oil sample that account
for  44%  of  the  total  crude  volume.  Despite  this  complexity,  several  properties  relevant  to
petroleum engineers can be determined from black oil PVT correlations.

6.2 Crude Oil Characterization
Crude oil characterization has long been an area of concern in refining; however, the need to
identify the chemical nature of crude has gained importance in upstream operations. Tradition-
ally,  this  has  been  done  by  simply  stating  the  crude  oil  gravity.  The  petroleum  industry  uses
API gravity as the preferred gravity scale, which is related to specific gravity as

Whitson71 has suggested use of the Watson72,73 characterization factor as a means of further
characterizing crude oils and components. In 1933, Watson and Nelson introduced a ratio be-
tween  the  mean  average  boiling  point  and  specific  gravity  that  could  be  used  to  indicate  the
chemical nature of hydrocarbon fractions and, therefore, could be used as a correlative factor.
Characterization factors are calculated with

. ................................................................. (6.2)

Characterization factors are useful because they remain reasonably constant for chemically sim-
ilar  hydrocarbons.  A  characterization  factor  of  12.5  or  greater  indicates  a  hydrocarbon  com-
pound  predominantly  paraffinic  in  nature.  Lower  values  of  this  factor  indicate  hydrocarbons
with more naphthenic or aromatic components. Highly aromatic hydrocarbons exhibit values of
10.0 or less; therefore, the Watson characterization factor provides a means of determining the
paraffinicity  of  a  crude  oil.  Using  work  from  Riazi  and  Daubert,74  Whitson71  developed  the
following relationship in terms of molecular weight and specific gravity.

Kw = 4.5579 Mo

Table 6.3 provides values of Watson characterization factors for selected pure components clas-
sified as paraffins, naphthenes, or aromatics. The characterization factor values provide insight
into their use.

Crude  oils  typically  have  characterization  factors  ranging  from  11  to  12.5.  Table  6.4  was
derived  from  assay  data  available  in  the  public  domain.  It  samples  crudes  from  around  the
world and can be used to provide insight into PVT behavior on a regional basis.

The  properties  of  the  heptanes-plus  fraction  in  the  stock  tank  crude  oil  are  an  additional
source  that  can  provide  insight  into  the  Watson  characterization  factor.  It  is  important  to  ac-

count  for  the  lighter  paraffin  components  found  in  the  oil  to  arrive  at  the  characterization
factor for the entire crude.

Fig.  6.2  depicts  a  relationship  between  crude  oil  gravity  and  characterization  parameter.
While not definitive, it can be observed that lower gravity crudes tend to be more naphthenic,
while higher-gravity crudes tend to be more paraffinic.

6.3 Bubblepoint Pressure
Tables A-1 and A-2 summarize correlations of bubblepoint. Since Standing’s29 correlation ap-
peared  in  1947,  more  than  30  methods  have  been  proposed.  Many  of  these  were  developed
during the last 15 years. The effective use of the correlations lies in an understanding of their
development, along with knowledge of their limitations. These equations can be expressed func-
tionally as

pb = f (T, γAPI, γg, Rs). ..................................................... (6.4)
Solution GOR is determined by rearranging any given correlation equation. Recent studies75–78
provide statistical analyses for bubblepoint-pressure correlations and provide recommendations
based on their findings; however, none of these references examines the full set of correlations.
Al-Shammasi2 compiled a databank of 1,243 data points from the literature. This was supple-
mented  by  133  samples  available  from  a  GeoMark  Research  database,68  bringing  the  total
number  of  data  points  to  1,376.  These  data  were  then  used  to  rank  the  bubblepoint  pressure
correlations. Table 6.5 summarizes the ranges of data found in this compilation and the distri-
bution. Fig. 6.3 shows the distribution of data used to prepare PVT correlations.

Table 6.6 summarizes correlation performance. The results are sorted by absolute average

relative error, which provided a means to rank the methods.

The data were further grouped to examine the impact of crude oil gravity and GOR on the
consistency  of  the  correlations.  Methods  proposed  by  Lasater,1  Al-Shammasi,2  and  Velarde  et
al.3  showed  reliability  over  a  wide  range  of  conditions.  The  author  has  experienced  good  re-
sults from both the Standing21,29 and Glasø12 correlations, although they may not have ranked
highly with this data set. Fig. 6.4 depicts these correlations for comparison.

Fig.  6.5  graphically  summarizes  the  results  of  all  32  bubblepoint  pressure  correlations  for
varying  GOR,  a  35°API  crude  oil,  a  hydrocarbon  gas  gravity  of  0.65,  and  a  temperature  of
150°F. Individual methods are unlabeled because it is the envelope and range of answers that
are of interest. Some information concerning correlation trends can be gathered from the outliers.

Fig. 6.2—Typical characterization factors for various crude oil gravities.

Owolabi’s33 method for Alaska Cook Inlet Basin crude oil systems, shown in Fig. 6.5, illus-
trates the impact of gas impurities on the correlation. This crude oil system is characterized by
GORs in the range 200 to 300 scf/STB and nitrogen contents of 5 to 15%. The limited range
of  GORs  combined  with  the  nitrogen  in  the  surface  gas  results  in  a  correlation  that  predicts
rather large values of bubblepoint pressure when extrapolated to higher GORs. This illustrates
the pitfalls of developing a correlation from a limited set of data and further defines the impor-
tance of understanding the range of applicability for any given correlation. The method may be
perfectly  valid  within  a  limited  range  of  conditions;  however,  the  equations  that  define  the
method may not be suitable for extrapolation.

This  example  also  illustrates  the  importance  of  adjusting  the  calculated  bubblepoint  pres-
sure for the effects of gas impurities. For the most part, bubblepoint-pressure correlations have
been established with little or no impurities in the gas. Owolabi recognized the importance of
these  impurities  and  their  impact  on  the  calculated  results.  Methods  to  adjust  the  calculated

bubblepoint pressure for gas impurities have been developed and should be used. Sec. 6.4 cov-
ers these methods.

It is instructive to focus on the large spread in the range of correlations presented in Fig.
6.5.  The  correlations  form  a  core  envelope  of  results  that  coincide  with  variations  expected
because  of  the  chemical  nature  of  the  crude  oil.  Correlations  with  results  residing  above  and
below  the  core  envelope  were  ignored,  and  the  difference  between  high  and  low  results  was
determined as shown in Fig. 6.6.

I-266

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Fig. 6.4—Selected bubblepoint pressure correlations.

Correlations  using  only  API  gravity  to  define  the  crude  oil  component  do  not  adequately
describe the chemical nature of the crude oil. Lasater’s method relies on a relationship relating
crude oil gravity and molecular weight. Whitson’s Watson characterization factor equation can
be used to examine this relationship. Lasater reported that the oil gravity/molecular weight rela-
tionship corresponded to a Watson characterization factor of 11.8; however, on closer examina-
tion, the correlation is representative of paraffinic oil with a Watson characterization factor of
approximately 12.2, as Fig. 6.7 shows. Whitson and Brulé13 recommended that Cragoe’s79 rela-
tionship to determine molecular weight from API gravity be used to determine crude molecular
weight.

Mo =

6,084
γAPI − 5.9 . ............................................................ (6.5)
First published in 1929, this equation is generally used with condensates and is applicable
over the range of 20 to 80°API. It should not be used outside this range. A Watson characteri-
zation factor of 11.8 is defined by Cragoe’s relationship over the API gravity range 30 to 40.
Whitson’s work with North Sea crudes that have a characterization factor of 11.9 supports this
recommendation.  A  more  general  recommendation  is  to  use  Whitson’s  equation  to  determine
the  molecular  weight  from  the  Watson  characterization  factor  and  oil  specific  gravity.  This
adds the dimension of crude oil chemical nature to the estimate of fluid properties using corre-
lations. Lasater developed a correlation between a bubblepoint pressure factor, pbγg/T, and the
mole fraction of gas dissolved in the oil, which is depicted in Fig. 6.8. The equation fit to the
data  has  been  modified  to  provide  better  performance  of  the  correlation  at  high  GOR  condi-
tions. Lasater’s method is summarized in its entirety in Tables A-1 and A-2.

Whitson and Brulé offered a modification to Glasø’s correlation to account for changes in
characterization  factor.  Glasø’s  correlation  was  developed  from  North  Sea  crude  oils  with  a
Watson characterization factor of 11.9. The proposed modification is

Fig.  6.9  depicts  the  effect  of  changing  the  Watson  characterization  factor  on  bubblepoint

factor to correlation of bubblepoint pressure offers increased flexibility in the use of a correla-
tion on a worldwide basis. Whitson and Brulé present graphs detailing the relationship between
bubblepoint pressure and characterization that show bubblepoint pressure declining with an in-
crease in characterization factor. Their analysis procedure also allows for changing API gravity
and  GOR.  By  allowing  these  two  quantities  to  vary,  their  evaluation  shows  the  converse  of
Fig. 6.9.

A  correlation  is  an  equation  or  method  fit  to  specific  data  groups  to  provide  the  relation-
ship  between  dependent  and  independent  variables.  Properly  defined,  the  variables  cover  a
wide range of conditions, enabling the correlation to properly represent the physical processes
being modeled. Formulation of the equations is important because they are routinely extrapolat-
ed outside the range used for their development. Some correlations have been developed with
multiple  equations  for  various  ranges  of  crude  oil  gravity.  Normally,  30°API  is  selected  as  a
point  at  which  the  equations  change.  Discontinuities  in  relationships  can  arise  as  a  result  of
using  multiple  equations.  Other  methods  show  nonphysical  trends.  Care  must  be  exercised  in
the use of these methods for “general use” calculations over a wide range of conditions.

Correlations  proposed  by  Vazquez  and  Beggs,23,24  Al-Najjar  et  al.,38  Kartoatmodjo  and
Schmidt,6–8 De Ghetto et al.,44,45 and Elsharkawy and Alikhan47 use multiple equations to cover
the  range  of  API  gravities.  These  methods  often  exhibit  discontinuities  across  the  boundaries.
The method of Dokla and Osman39 shows virtually no sensitivity to crude oil gravity. Bubble-
point  pressure  should  increase  with  rising  temperature.  Methods  proposed  by  Dokla  and
Osman,  Almehaideb,46  Elsharkawy  and  Dindoruk,  and  Christman9  show  a  decrease.  Bubble-
point pressure should decrease with increasing gas gravity. Methods proposed by Asgarpour et
al.37 (for the Cardium/Viking and D2/Leduc formations) and Elsharkawy are insensitive to gas
gravity  or  show  increasing  bubblepoint  pressure  with  increasing  gas  gravity.  Omar  and
Todd’s41,42  correlation  shows  a  parabolic  trend  that  is  inaccurate  for  high  gas  gravities.  This

method  should  be  avoided  for  crude  oil  systems  with  gas-specific  gravities  greater  than  1.10.
Figs. 6.10 through 6.12 show these results graphically.

Additionally,  several  other  correlations  have  been  found  to  exhibit  undesirable  tendencies.
At  atmospheric  pressure  where  solution  GOR  is  zero,  Petrosky  and  Farshad10,11  determines  a
value of 50 to 100 scf/STB. Dindoruk and Christman provided separate equations for GOR and
bubblepoint  pressure  because  of  their  complexity.  Both  equations  provide  nearly  identical  re-

sults for low GOR systems. For higher GOR systems (e.g., greater than 2,000 scf/STB), their
GOR equation provides more realistic results; therefore, when using the Dindoruk and Christ-
man  method,  their  equation  for  solution  GOR  is  recommended.  For  calculating  bubblepoint
pressure, this equation must be solved with numerical methods because of its formulation. Cor-
relations proposed by Owolabi33 and Hasan et al.43 are undefined at pressures less than 55 psia,
while  Al-Marhoun’s34  method,  published  in  1985,  has  an  upper  pressure  limit  of  5,348  psia
because of the formulation of the equations.

In summary, correlations are often incorporated into computer programs in which they can
easily  be  used  for  conditions  outside  the  range  intended  for  the  method.  Some  methods  are
well behaved and provide reasonable results when extrapolated. Other methods should only be
used within the bounds defined by the data used in the development of the correlation.

6.4 Nonhydrocarbon Gas Effects
Nonhydrocarbon  gases  typically  found  in  crude  oil  systems  are  nitrogen,  carbon  dioxide,  and
hydrogen sulfide. The bubblepoint pressure correlations (with the exception of Owolabi,33 Al-

Marhoun,34,36  and  Dokla  and  Osman39)  were  developed  with  crude  oil  systems  that  did  not
contain  significant  amounts  of  impurities  in  the  gas  phase.  Work  by  Jacobson,80  Glasø,12  and
Owolabi  point  out  the  need  for  procedures  to  modify  the  calculated  bubblepoint  pressure  for
these  impurities.  Nitrogen  does  not  readily  dissolve  in  crude  oil,  resulting  in  an  increase  in
bubblepoint pressure. On the other hand, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide are more soluble
in crude oil than natural gas, which has the effect of lowering bubblepoint pressure. Jacobson
evaluated 110 crude oil PVT samples containing up to 14% nitrogen and found that a correc-
tion  factor  need  only  be  based  on  the  nitrogen  content  of  the  gas  and  the  temperature  of  the
mixture. An equation to account for the effects of nitrogen on bubblepoint pressure was devel-
oped.

Glasø  examined  the  effects  of  nitrogen,  carbon  dioxide,  and  hydrogen  sulfide  on  bubble-
point pressure and developed corrections for each impurity. The correction for nitrogen content
is a function of nitrogen content in the gas, temperature, and crude oil gravity.

Figs.  6.13  through  6.15  depict  these  corrections.  Owolabi  found  that  Jacobson’s  method
was superior for correcting the calculated bubblepoint pressure for the nitrogen content in Cook
Inlet  crude  oil  systems.  Jacobson’s  method  was  derived  from  measured  data  containing  less
than 14% nitrogen, while Glasø’s data covered systems with nearly 20% nitrogen. Glasø’s cor-
rection factors for carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide used measured data containing impuri-
ties of 20 and 40%, respectively.

6.5 Solution GOR
This  property  is  determined  by  rearranging  the  equations  for  calculating  bubblepoint  pressure
as discussed in Secs. 6.3 and 6.4.

6.6 Formation Volume Factor
The oil FVF relates the volume of oil at stock-tank conditions to the volume of oil at elevated
pressure and temperature. Values typically range from approximately 1.0 bbl/STB for crude oil
systems containing little or no solution gas to nearly 3.0 bbl/STB for highly volatile oils. Ta-
bles A-3 and A-4 summarize thirty correlations for saturated crude oil systems that have been
identified in the literature. For saturated systems, gas is liberated as pressure is reduced below
the  bubblepoint.  This  results  in  a  corresponding  shrinkage  in  oil  volume,  as  shown  for  all  of
the methods in Fig. 6.16. The rather large number of correlations preclude the identification of
individual methods. The results show a relatively narrow range of oil FVF values determined

by  all  of  the  correlation  methods.  These  correlations  determine  FVF  based  on  the  following
function.

Bob = f (T, γAPI, γg, Rs). ................................................... (6.11)
Solution GOR accounts for the largest change in FVF. Increases in temperature, crude oil grav-
ity, and gas gravity provide a small increase in FVF.

Recent  studies75–77,81  provide  statistical  analyses  for  bubblepoint  oil  FVF  correlations  and
provide recommendations based on their findings; however, none of these references examines
the  full  set  of  correlations.  Al-Shammasi2  compiled  a  databank  of  1,345  data  points  from  the
literature  that  was  combined  with  133  data  points  from  the  GeoMark  Research  database68  to
yield  a  total  of  1,478  data  points.  These  data  were  used  to  rank  the  accuracy  of  the  oil  FVF
correlations. The ranges and distribution of these data can be found in Table 6.5 and Fig. 6.3.
Table 6.7 summarizes correlation performance. The results are sorted by absolute average rela-
tive error, which provides a means to rank the methods.

The  data  were  further  grouped  to  examine  the  impact  of  crude  oil  gravity  and  GOR  on
consistency of the correlations. Methods proposed by Al-Marhoun,4 Al-Shammasi,2 Farshad et
al.,5 and Kartoatmodjo and Schmidt6–8 showed reliability over a wide range of conditions. The
author has experienced good results from both the Standing50 and Glasø12 correlations, although
they may not have ranked highly with this data set. Fig. 6.17 summarizes these methods.

The correlations were tested against the other parameters used in the derivation of the meth-
ods:  crude  oil  API  gravity,  gas  gravity,  and  temperature.  Several  methods  use  multiple  equa-
tions valid for specified ranges of crude oil gravity. Discontinuities, which are summarized in
Fig. 6.18, can result from the use of this technique to develop a correlation. Furthermore, FVF
should increase with increasing API gravity. Fig. 6.18 shows methods that exhibit nonphysical
results.

Chapter 6—Oil System Correlations

I-275

Fig. 6.14—Carbon dioxide bubblepoint pressure correction factor.

FVF should increase with increasing solution gas gravity. Fig. 6.19 shows that a number of
correlations  predict  results  opposite  to  this  trend.  Correlations  listed  in  Figs.  6.18  and  6.19
should  be  used  with  caution  to  avoid  problems  associated  with  discontinuities  or  nonphysical
behavior. Limitations imposed by data used in the correlation’s development should be followed.

6.7 Isothermal Compressibility
The isothermal compressibility of undersaturated oil is defined as

co = − 1

V (∂V
∂p)T

= − 1

Bo (∂Bo
∂ p )T

, .......................................... (6.12)

which reflects the change in volume with change in pressure under constant temperature condi-
tions.  Below  the  bubblepoint  pressure,  oil  isothermal  compressibility  is  defined  from  oil  and
gas properties to account for gas coming out of solution. The corresponding saturated oil com-
pressibility is

co = − 1

Bo (∂Bo
∂ p )T

− Bg(∂Rs
∂ p )T

. .......................................... (6.13)

Above  bubblepoint  pressure,  oil  volume  changes  as  a  function  of  isothermal  compressibility
only.  Tables  A-5  and  A-6  summarize  the  correlations  developed  to  predict  this  property.  Oil
FVFs for undersaturated crude oil are determined as a function of bubblepoint FVF, isothermal
compressibility, and pressure above bubblepoint from

A total of 141 data points were available from the GeoMark PVT database.68 Geographically,
these  samples  were  obtained  from  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  the  Gulf  of  Suez.  Table  6.8  pro-
vides a summary of the data. This data was used to evaluate and rank the performance of the
isothermal  compressibility  correlations.  Table  6.9  provides  the  results.  Data  in  the  table  have
been  sorted  by  absolute  average  relative  error,  which  provides  a  means  to  rank  the  methods.
Fig. 6.20 graphically shows isothermal compressibility vs. pressure.

Methods proposed by Standing13 and Ahmed52 exhibit excessive changes in compressibility
compared  with  the  other  methods  and  can  determine  results  that  are  physically  unreal.  Fig.
6.21  shows  how  isothermal  compressibility  changes  with  crude  oil  gravity.  As  oil  gravity  in-
creases, isothermal compressibility should increase. Results predicted by Ahmed, Al-Marhoun,4
De Ghetto et al.,44,45 and Elsharkawy and Alikhan47 do not properly model the phenomena. De
Ghetto  et  al.  proposed  a  method  that  uses  several  equations  covering  various  API  gravity
ranges. This technique results in discontinuities in predicted properties as the equations change.
Fig. 6.22 shows the change in isothermal compressibility with solution GOR. Varying this prop-
erty  also  results  in  varying  the  bubblepoint  pressure.  To  illustrate  this  effect,  isothermal
compressibility  is  determined  at  1,000  psi  above  a  variable  saturation  pressure.  Results  from
methods  proposed  by  Petrosky  and  Farshad,10,11  Kartoatmodjo  and  Schmidt,6–8  and  Dindoruk
and  Christman9  are  undefined  for  solution  GORs  of  zero.  Methods  proposed  by  Ahmed,  Al-
Marhoun, and Kartoatmodjo produce unphysical results with changing GOR.

The physical property density is the ratio between mass and volume. The density of crude oil
can be determined from specific gravity of the crude oil, the solution gas gravity, the solution

This is valid for all pressure and temperature conditions for which the PVT properties are deter-
mined. As expressed, this equation provides density with the units of lbm/ft3.

6.9 Viscosity
Absolute viscosity provides a measure of a fluid’s internal resistance to flow. Any calculation
involving the movement of fluids requires a value of viscosity. This parameter is required for
conditions ranging from surface gathering systems to the reservoir. Therefore, correlations can
then be expected to evaluate viscosity for temperatures ranging from 35 to 300°F. Fluids that
exhibit  viscosity  behavior  independent  of  shear  rate  are  described  as  being  Newtonian  fluids.
Viscosity correlations discussed in this chapter apply to Newtonian fluids.

The principal factors affecting viscosity are oil composition, temperature, dissolved gas, and
pressure.  Typically,  oil  composition  is  described  by  API  gravity  only.  As  discussed  earlier  in

I-278

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

this chapter, this is a shortcoming. The use of both the API gravity and the Watson characteri-
zation  factor  provides  a  more  complete  description  of  the  oil.  Table  6.10  shows  an  example
for  a  35°  API  gravity  oil  that  points  out  the  relationship  of  viscosity  and  chemical  makeup
recalling a characterization factor of 12.5 is reflective of highly paraffinic oils, while a value of
11.0 is indicative of a naphthenic oil. Clearly, chemical composition, in addition to API gravi-

ty, plays a role in the viscosity behavior of crude oil. Fig. 6.23 shows the effect of crude oil
characterization factor on dead oil viscosity. In general, viscosity characteristics are predictable.
Viscosity increases with decreases in crude oil API gravity (assuming a constant Watson char-
acterization  factor)  and  decreases  in  temperature.  The  effect  of  solution  gas  is  to  reduce
viscosity. Above saturation pressure, viscosity increases almost linearly with pressure. Fig. 6.24
provides the typical shape of reservoir oil viscosity at constant temperature.

Viscosity  calculations  for  live  reservoir  oils  require  a  multistep  process  involving  separate
correlations for each step of the process. Dead or gas-free oil viscosity is determined as a func-
tion of crude oil API gravity and temperature. The viscosity of the gas saturated oil is found as
a function of dead oil viscosity and solution GOR. Undersaturated oil viscosity is determined
as a function of gas saturated oil viscosity and pressure above saturation pressure.

Figs. 6.25 and 6.26 summarize all of the dead oil viscosity correlations described in Tables
A-7 and A-8. The results provided by Fig. 6.26 show that the method proposed by Standing94
is not suited for crude oil with gravities less than 28°API. Al-Kafaji et al.’s59 method is unsuit-
ed for crudes with gravities less than 15°API, while Bennison’s62 method, developed primarily
for low API gravity North Sea crudes, is not suited for gravities greater than 30°API.

Fig. 6.27 provides an annotated list of the most commonly used methods. The results illus-
trate  the  trend  for  dead  oil  viscosity  and  temperature.  As  temperature  decreases,  viscosity
increases. At temperatures below 75°F, the method of Beggs and Robinson19 significantly over-
predicts  viscosity  while  Standing’s  method  actually  shows  a  decrease  in  viscosity.  These
tendencies  make  these  methods  unsuitable  for  use  in  the  temperature  range  associated  with
pipelines. Beal’s20,21 method was developed from observations of dead oil viscosity at 100 and
200°F and has a tendency to underpredict viscosity at high temperature. Dead oil viscosity cor-
relations are somewhat inaccurate because they fail to take into account the chemical nature of
the crude oil. Only methods developed by Standing13 and Fitzgerald15,16,61 take into account the

chemical  nature  of  crude  oil  through  use  of  the  Watson  characterization  factor.  Fitzgerald’s
method was developed over a wide range of conditions, as detailed in Tables A-7 and A-8, and
is the most versatile method suitable for general use of the correlations listed in that table. Fig.
6.28 provides the area of applicability for Fitzgerald’s method.

Andrade’s55,56 method is based on the observation that the logarithm of viscosity plotted vs.
reciprocal  absolute  temperature  forms  a  linear  relationship  from  somewhat  above  the  normal
boiling  point  to  near  the  freezing  point  of  the  oil,  as  Fig.  6.29  shows.  Andrade’s  method  is
applied  through  the  use  of  measured  dead  oil  viscosity  data  points  taken  at  low  pressure  and
two or more temperatures. Data should be acquired at temperatures over the range of interest.
This method is recommended when measured dead oil viscosity data are available.

Tables  A-9  and  A-10  provide  a  complete  summary  of  the  bubblepoint  oil  viscosity  meth-
ods.  Correlations  for  bubblepoint  oil  viscosity  typically  take  the  form  proposed  by  Chew  and
Connally.17 This method forms a correlation with dead oil viscosity and solution GOR where A
and B are determined as functions of solution GOR.

μob = Aμod

Figs. 6.30 and 6.31 shows the correlations for the A and B parameters developed by various
authors. Fig. 6.32 shows the effect of the A and B correlation parameters on the prediction of
viscosity.  This  plot  was  developed  with  a  dead  oil  viscosity  value  of  1.0  cp  so  the  effect  of
solution GOR could be examined. Correlations proposed by Labedi,31,57 Khan et al.,64 and Alme-
haideb46 do not specifically use dead oil viscosity and solution GOR and were not included in
this plot.

Chapter 6—Oil System Correlations

When pressure increases above bubblepoint, the oil becomes undersaturated. In this region,
oil viscosity increases nearly linearly with pressure. Tables A-11 and A-12 provide correlations
for modeling undersaturated oil viscosity. Fig. 6.33 presents a visual comparison of the methods.

6.10 Surface Tension
Interfacial or surface tension exists when two phases are present. These phases can be gas/oil,
oil/water, or gas/water. Surface tension is the force that holds the surface of a particular phase
together and is normally measured in dynes/cm. The surface tension between gas and crude oil
ranges from near zero to approximately 34 dynes/cm. It is a function of pressure, temperature,
and  the  composition  of  each  phase.  Two  forms  of  correlations  for  calculating  gas/oil  surface
tension have been developed. The first form is a pseudocompositional black oil approach. Two
components,  gas  and  oil,  are  identified,  and  techniques  used  with  compositional  models  are
used to calculate surface tension. The second approach uses empirical correlations to determine
surface  tension.  Black  oil  correlations  may  provide  less  than  accurate  results  because  of  the

I-282

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

simplified characterization of the crude oil. Generally, the heavy end components of a crude oil
may be made of asphaltic and surface active materials that have a measurable effect on surface
tension.

With the compositional approach, surface tension is determined from the following equation

proposed by Weinaug and Katz.83

where the density terms are defined with units of g/cm3. Pi is the parachor of each component.
This  property  is  a  characteristic  of  pure  components  and  is  determined  from  surface  tension
measurements where the density of the gas and liquid phases are known. Fig. 6.34 provides a
relationship between parachors and molecular weight.

In  1973,  Ramey85  proposed  a  pseudocompositional  method  for  calculating  surface  tension.
The two components are oil and gas. Gas is free to dissolve in the oil phase, and oil is free to
vaporize  in  the  gas  phase,  which  makes  this  method  more  versatile  than  the  other  methods
discussed in this chapter. The Weinaug-Katz equation is modified as

While  this  method  appears  different  from  that  proposed  by  Ramey,  it  is  identical  for  the
Ramey case in which no oil vaporizes into the gas phase. This method differs from Ramey’s
method only by the definition of the oil and gas parachors.

The Baker and Swerdloff 26,27 method was published in 1955. It was presented in the form

should  be  used.  Similarly,  if  the  temperature  is  less  than  68°F,  the  value  calculated  for  68°F
should be used. For intermediate temperatures, surface tension is derived by linear interpolation

Eq. 6.39, which Fig. 6.37 shows graphically.

Table  6.11  shows  the  statistics  provided  by  Abdul-Majeed  comparing  the  results  of  the  pro-
posed method with the Baker and Swerdloff method. Fig. 6.39 shows a comparison of the four
methods for calculating surface tension.

6.11 Water-Hydrocarbon Surface Tension
The surface tension of a water-hydrocarbon system varies from approximately 72 dynes/cm for
water/gas  systems  to  20  to  40  dynes/cm  for  water/oil  systems  at  atmospheric  conditions.  In
1973,  Ramey85  published  methods  to  evaluate  the  surface  tension  of  water-hydrocarbon  mix-

correlation  suitable  for  use  with  gas  and  liquid  hydrocarbons.  Surface  tension  data  from  pure

For  methane-brine  systems,  Standing13  has  indicated  that  the  surface  tension  will  increase

1.398  bbl/STB;  therefore,  the  accuracy  of  the  bubblepoint  FVF  is  primarily  affected  by  the

lution  GOR.  Errors  in  individual  correlations  can  compound  and  propagate  through  to  the
resulting  answer.  For  instance,  if  the  measured  bubblepoint  viscosity  is  used  in  Eq.  6.61,  the
result  is  0.52  cp—much  closer  to  the  measured  value.  Therefore,  care  should  be  exercised  in
the selection of accurate correlations for individual properties.

Thermodynamics and Phase Behavior
R.T. Johns, U. of Texas at Austin

7.1 Introduction
Phase  behavior  describes  the  complex  interaction  between  physically  distinct,  separable  por-
tions  of  matter  called  phases  that  are  in  contact  with  each  other.  Typical  phases  are  solids,
liquids, and vapors. Phase behavior plays a vital role in many petroleum applications, such as
enhanced  oil  recovery,  compositional  simulation,  geochemical  behavior,  wellbore  stability,
geothermal energy, environmental cleanup, multiphase flow in wellbores and pipes, and surface
facilities.

Thermodynamics, which is central to understanding phase behavior, is the study of energy
and  its  transformations.  Using  thermodynamics,  we  can  follow  the  energy  changes  that  occur
during  phase  changes  and  predict  the  outcome  of  a  process.  Thermodynamics  began  as  the
study of heat applied to steam power but was substantially broadened by Gibbs in the middle
to  late  1800s.  Gibbs’  most  significant  contribution  was  the  development  of  phase-equilibrium
thermodynamics applied to multicomponent mixtures, particularly the concept of chemical po-
tential.1 The concept of chemical potential leads to the result that, at equilibrium, the chemical
potential of each component must be the same in all phases (μiL = μiV).
Phase-equilibrium thermodynamics seeks to determine properties such as temperature, pres-
sure,  and  phase  compositions  that  establish  themselves  once  all  tendencies  for  further  change
have disappeared. This chapter reviews the fundamentals of phase-equilibrium thermodynamics
used in petroleum applications, especially those that require liquid-vapor phase behavior.2–7 The
next chapter in this section of the Handbook illustrates phase behavior through diagrams.

7.2 Fundamental Ideas and Problem Statement
Fig.  7.1  is  a  schematic  showing  a  closed  container  of  liquid  and  vapor.  Given  constant  and
known temperature, pressure, and overall compositions (zi where i = 1, … , nc) at equilibrium,
the fundamental task is to quantify the molar fractions of the phases (L, V) and compositions
of the vapor (yi  where i = 1, … , nc) and liquid phases (xi  where i = 1, … , nc) that form at
equilibrium.  The  phases  are  assumed  to  be  homogeneous,  in  which  intensive  parameters  such
as pressure, temperature, density, viscosity, and phase compositions are uniform throughout the
phase.  (Thus,  gravity  effects  are  not  typically  considered.)  Intensive  properties  are  those  that
are  independent  of  the  amount  of  the  phases  (e.g.,  phase  density,  pressure,  and  temperature).
Alternatively, extensive properties depend on the amount of the phases (e.g., total volume and

line shows a distinct interface between the two phases.

moles of liquid). Intensive properties can be determined as the ratio of two extensive proper-
ties; for example, molar density is the number of moles divided by the total volume.

The overall compositions and phase compositions in Fig. 7.1 are written as mole fractions,

which are defined by

overall and phase compositions by

Thus, once the overall compositions and phase compositions are known, the phase molar frac-
tions, L and V, are also known.

7.2.1 Gibbs Phase Rule and Duhem’s Theorem.  The Gibbs phase rule and Duhem’s theorem
assure us that the problem illustrated in Fig. 7.1 can be solved. Ideas and theories from thermo-
dynamics are  based  on  observations.  Gibbs,  for  example, observed  that the  equilibrium inten-
sive state of the system is fully known once the pressure, temperature, and phase compositions
are  specified.  The  number  of  intensive  properties  that  we  would  like  to  know  is,  therefore,
2 + ncnp,  where  np  is  the  number  of  phases  (for  vapor/liquid  equilibrium,  np  is  two).  These
intensive properties can only be determined if a sufficient number of equations are available or
if  some  of  them  are  explicitly  specified.  An  inventory  of  equations  shows  that  there  are  np
summation equations (i.e., the phase mole fractions for each phase sum to 1.0) and nc(np − 1)
equilibrium  relations,  for  a  total  of  np + nc(np − 1)  equations.  The  equilibrium  relations  could
be given as K-values (Ki =
), which relate the component liquid and vapor mole fractions or,
as described later, chemical potential criteria for equilibrium (i.e., μiL = μiV).
The Gibbs phase rule says that the degrees of freedom are 2 + nc − np, which is the differ-
ence  between  the  number  of  required  intensive  properties  (unknowns)  and  the  number  of
relations  (equations).  The  Gibbs  phase  rule  is  only  practically  useful  for  a  small  number  of
components  but  does  offer  significant  insight  into  the  maximum  number  of  phases  that  can
form as well as how many intensive properties can be independently specified.

For  example,  suppose  that  only  one  phase  (np  =  1)  is  present  at  equilibrium  in  a  system
containing a pure fluid (nc  = 1). The Gibbs phase rule says that only two intensive properties
can be specified (degrees of freedom are two). We cannot specify three or more intensive prop-
erties for this case, but we are free to choose which intensive properties are set. Typically, we
would  choose  temperature  and  pressure.  The  choice  of  intensive  properties  is  not  completely
arbitrary,  for  only  properties  related  to  an  individual  phase  can  be  selected.  Thus,  properties
such  as  the  overall  density  of  the  two-phase  system  or  the  phase  molar  fractions,  L  and  V,
cannot be used to reduce the degrees of freedom.

xi

Suppose next that three equilibrium phases exist in the pure fluid (i.e., the triple point). For
this case, the degrees of freedom are zero, and no intensive properties can be specified. That
is, the intensive properties, such as temperature and pressure, are determined and are not arbi-
trary  at  the  triple  point.  Four  phases  in  equilibrium  with  each  other  are  not  allowed  by  the
Gibbs phase rule (neither are they observed experimentally).

Duhem’s theorem is another rule, similar to the phase rule, but it specifies when both the
extensive  and  intensive  states  of  the  system  are  determined.  The  theorem  states  that  for  any
closed system containing specified moles of nc  components (from which the overall composi-
tions can be calculated), the equilibrium state is completely determined when any two indepen-
dent properties are fixed. The two independent properties may be either intensive or extensive;
however,  the  maximum  number  of  independent  intensive  properties  that  can  be  specified  is
given by the Gibbs phase rule. For example, when the degrees of freedom are one, at least one
of the two variables must be extensive. When the degrees of freedom are zero, both must be
extensive. Thus, the combination of the Gibbs phase rule and Duhem’s theorem shows that the
extensive and intensive state of the two-phase problem in Fig. 7.1 can be determined when the
temperature,  pressure,  and  moles  of  all  the  components  are  specified.  For  a  pure  component

system,  the  intensive  and  extensive  state  of  the  system  is  determined  when  the  temperature,
pressure, and the total number of moles are given.

7.2.2 Equilibrium, Stability, and Reversible Thermodynamic Systems.  Thermodynamics is a
macroscopic viewpoint in that it concerns itself with the properties of a system, such as temper-
ature and density. Thermodynamics predicts the nature of a new equilibrium state—not the rate
at which that state is reached. One of the characteristics of equilibrium is that the thermodynam-
ic  properties  are  time  invariant.  Furthermore,  once  equilibrium  is  reached,  the  process  or
pathway that led to equilibrium cannot be determined.

The equilibrium state is always time invariant, whether it is dynamic or static. A dynamic
equilibrium  process  is  a  steady-state  process,  in  which  the  properties  change  spatially  but  not
temporally. A static process, while having the appearance of reaching a static state on a macro-
scopic  scale  (such  as  that  shown  in  Fig.  7.1),  is  anything  but  static  on  a  microscopic  scale.
Molecules from the liquid phase continue to move into the vapor phase and vice versa, but the
rates of energy and mass transfer are equal, giving the appearance of equilibrium on a macro-
scopic  scale.  Indeed,  this  is  exactly  the  definition  for  equilibrium  embodied  by  the  chemical
potential criterion μiL = μiV.
The criterion of time invariance is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for equilibrium.
Some systems can exist in metastable states that are time invariant. For example, at the Earth’s
surface, diamonds are in a metastable state of pure carbon, whereas graphite is the equilibrium
state. Fig. 7.2 illustrates the concept of equilibrium vs. metastable or unstable (nonequilibrium)
states by considering a ball rolling down a hill into a valley. When the ball is on the side of
the  hill,  it  is  unstable  and  will  roll  down  the  slope  because  of  gravitational  forces;  this  is  an
unstable process. The ball, however, if initially trapped in a small depression on the side of the
hill, will  not  roll  down  the  hill; this  is  a  metastable state. Lacking any  additional energy,  the
ball  will  stay  in  the  metastable  position.  If  the  depression  is  removed,  or  the  ball  is  slightly
moved, the ball will roll down the hill until it reaches the lowest position, which corresponds
to the lowest gravitational potential energy or equilibrium position.

Later on, we will find that a definition for equilibrium is when the Gibbs free energy of the
system is the lowest value possible, and this is how one can recognize unstable or metastable

Chapter 7—Thermodynamics and Phase Behavior

states from the true equilibrium. Generally, equilibrium states that arise naturally are stable to
small  disturbances.  On  the  flip  side,  metastable  equilibrium  states,  which  are  not  stable  to
small disturbances, do not occur often in nature. Our mathematical description of equilibrium,
however, will exhibit these unstable and metastable states, so we must be able to recognize them.
Processes of interest to us are often not time invariant, and it would appear that equilibrium
thermodynamics is not very useful. For example, we typically run transient simulations to esti-
mate the recovery of reservoir oil by injection of a gas. The concept of local equilibrium and
reversibility are used to overcome this apparent limitation of thermodynamics. Equilibrium at a
point in a reservoir, termed local equilibrium, often applies when internal relaxation processes
are rapid with respect to the rate at which changes are imposed on the system. That is, equilib-
rium thermodynamics can be applied over small volumes of the reservoir, even though pressure
and other gradients remain in the reservoir. In reservoir simulation, the small volumes are grid-
blocks, although the size of the gridblocks must be sufficiently small so that good accuracy is
obtained.

The concept of reversibility of a process is also important. A reversible process proceeds in
sufficiently small steps so that it is essentially in equilibrium at any given time (i.e., the pro-
cess at a point in the reservoir proceeds in a succession of local equilibrium steps). A process
is reversible when its direction can be reversed at any point by an infinitesimal change in exter-
nal conditions.

The concept of reversibility is, in a sense, the temporal equivalent to the spatial concept of
local  equilibrium.  Thus,  the  concepts  of  local  equilibrium  and  reversibility  allow  the  applica-
tion  of  equilibrium  thermodynamics  to  real  systems,  which  are  invariably  nonequilibrium  at
large scales. For most cases, very little accuracy is lost in making such assumptions.

7.3 Fundamental Equations
Relatively few ideas and equations are used to solve the phase behavior problem illustrated in
Fig.  7.1.  The  most  fundamental  idea  in  thermodynamics  is  the  conservation  of  total  energy,
which  is  termed  “the  first  law  of  thermodynamics.”  The  first  law  is  based  on  our  every  day
observation that for any change of thermodynamic properties, total energy, which includes inter-
nal, potential, kinetic, heat, and work, is conserved. The second fundamental idea in thermody-
namics  is  the  total  entropy  balance  or  “the  second  law  of  thermodynamics.”  Entropy  is  a
thermodynamic  property  that  expresses  the  unidirectional  nature  of  a  process  and,  in  some
sense,  is  “nature’s  clock.”  For  example,  a  cup  of  hot  coffee  at  room  temperature  cools  down
instead of heating up. The conservation of total mass is also used to constrain thermodynamic
processes.

These  equations  are  applied  to  a  thermodynamic  system.  A  thermodynamic  system  is  de-
fined as that part of the universe we are considering—for example, the inside of the container
in Fig. 7.1. Everything else is called the surroundings. A system may be related to its surround-
ings in a variety of ways, depending on whether mass or energy (in the form of heat or work)
is exchanged (see Fig. 7.3). When no heat or mass is transferred, and no work is done on or
by  the  surroundings,  the  system  is  referred  to  as  an  “isolated”  system.  When  only  energy  is
exchanged  between  the  system  and  surroundings,  the  system  is  “closed.”  Last,  the  system  is
“open”  when  both  mass  and  energy  are  exchanged  between  the  system  and  its  surroundings.
No work is allowed on or by an isolated system, and its boundaries are therefore rigid.

A  thermodynamic  state  is  given  by  its  thermodynamic  properties  (e.g.,  pressure,  density,
enthalpy, temperature, internal energy, entropy, and other properties). All of these are state func-
tions  that  depend  only  on  the  present  state  reached  (point  conditions)—not  the  path  that  the
system  took  to  reach  that  state.  For  example,  if  methane  is  heated,  compressed,  and  then  re-
turned to its initial volume and temperature, the methane will have exactly the same pressure
as before, independent of how it was heated or compressed. The usefulness of state functions

is the simplest possible path can be selected for the calculation of the change in a state func-
tion; that is, we would likely choose a reversible path that consists of isothermal or isobaric steps.
In contrast to state functions such as entropy or pressure, heat and work are not thermody-
namic properties but depend on the nature or path of the process that the system undergoes. A
different path will give a different amount of work and heat.

7.3.1 First Law of Thermodynamics.  We begin with the first law of thermodynamics applied
to an open thermodynamic system. As illustrated in Fig. 7.3, an open system allows mass and
energy to flow into or out of the system. We make the following assumptions and definitions:

1. Mass flows into or out of the system along one boundary of the system. The mass flow
rate into  the  system  is  positive, whereas  flow  rates  out  of  the  system  to  the  surroundings  are
negative.

2. Mass can carry internal energy into or out of the system. We neglect kinetic and poten-
tial energy carried by the mass. This is often a good assumption when the fluid is not moving
near the speed of sound, the change in height over the system is not large, or the system tem-
perature variations are not large.

3. The  only  types  of  work  that  are  present  are  expansion/compression  of  the  system  and
flow work. The boundaries of the system can expand or contract. Thus, work can be done by
the system on the surroundings or vice versa. Work is positive when the surroundings do work
on the system (i.e., the system contracts). The mass that enters or exits the system also does work
—sometimes called flow work or pressure work.

4. We neglect potential energy and kinetic energy changes within the system.
5. Energy in the form of heat might enter or leave the system across the system boundaries.

Heat transfer is positive when heat is exchanged from the surroundings to the system.

Before  proceeding,  we  must  define  internal  energy.  Internal  energy  of  a  substance  is  the
sum of the potential energy arising from chemical bonds of atoms and electrons and the sum
of the kinetic energy of the atoms and molecules. The microscopic kinetic energy is sometimes
called thermal energy, which is proportional to temperature.

With this definition, a total macroscopic energy balance in the system, at an instantaneous

point in time, gives

energy within the system ) =( Net rate of transport of total

where

and nU, the total internal energy, is equal to the total energy within the system by assumption
four  previously  discussed.  The  property,  U,  is  the  molar  internal  energy  (total  energy/mole).
Eq. 7.3 shows that when work or heat is added to the system, the molecular activity increases,
causing the total internal energy to increase; that is,  d(nU )
dt

The term on the right side of Eq. 7.2 contains three terms: mass influx into the system that
carries energy; heat transfer into the system; and compression work done by the surroundings
on the system. Because we neglect potential and kinetic energy of the mass that flows into the
system (assumption two), the energy associated with the mass influx into the system is simply
U n˙,  where  n˙  is  the  molar flow  rate. Based  on  assumption  one,  there is  only  one  molar flow
rate into the system. The rate of heat flow from the surroundings across the system boundaries
into  the  system  is  given  by  Q˙.  Compression  (or  expansion)  of  the  system  boundaries  causes
work on the system denoted by W˙ . Substitution of these terms into Eq. 7.2 gives

where the left side refers to energy within the system and the right side to energy that flows
across the system boundaries into the system.

The two types of work considered are expansion/compression work and flow work (assump-
tion three). From physics, work is performed whenever a force acts over a distance. Thus, the
differential  mechanical  work  that  results  from  a  differential  displacement  d l→  is  given  by
dW = F→
· d l→. For expansion/compression work, the external force is equal to an external pres-
sure supplied by the surroundings multiplied by the corresponding area along the boundary of
the system.
In  Cartesian  coordinates,  dW = − pext(A xd x + A yd y + A zdz),  where  the  external  pressure
is constant along the boundary of the system.  A x is the area normal to the x-coordinate that is
being  displaced,  and  so  forth.  The  minus  sign  indicates  that  work  is  positive  if  the  displace-
ment  is  negative  (i.e.,  an  external  force  compresses  the  system).  The  expression  for  the
differential work can be simplified further as dW = − pextd(nV), where nV  is the total volume
and V  is the molar volume (volume/mole). The rate of work is W˙ = − pe xt
. This equation
applies to any arbitrarily shaped system.

For example, consider a rectangular box that expands differentially into the surroundings on
three sides, as illustrated in Fig 7.4. Here,  A x ≈ yz,  A y ≈ xz, and  A z ≈ xy, where the differen-
tial
 therefore,
dW = − pext(yzd x + xzd y + xydz), provided the external pressure is the same on all faces of
 to  d(nV) = d(xyz) =
the
yzd x + xzd y + xydz,  which  gives  the  desired  result.  In  this  example,  the  differential  work  is
negative because the system does work on the surroundings. The example also illustrates that
even though the system expands into the surroundings, the work is always related to the exter-
nal pressure. If the external pressure is zero, no work will be done by the system because the
surroundings will offer no resistance.

Flow work is done by mass that enters or exits the system. A flowing fluid element does
work  on  the  fluid  ahead  of  it,  and  the  fluid  behind  it  does  work  on  that  fluid  element.  Flow

For  reversible  displacements,  the  pressure  in  the  system  must  equal  the  external  pressure,

Eq. 7.5 can be simplified by defining the enthalpy, H = U + pV. The definition for enthalpy is
defined strictly for mathematical convenience. For liquids and solids at low pressures, we often
take  H = U  because  the  product   pV  is  small  compared  to  U  (the  molar  volume  of  the  con-
densed phases is also small). Combining the first and third terms on the right side of Eq. 7.5

Eq. 7.6 can be written in thermodynamic shorthand as

For closed systems, dn = 0 (the total moles in the system is constant), and Eq. 7.7 becomes

d(nU ) = dQ − pd(nV).

Chapter 7—Thermodynamics and Phase Behavior

For isolated systems, dn = 0, dQ = 0, and d(nV) = 0; therefore, Eq. 7.7 reduces to

d(nU ) = 0, ................................................................ (7.8)

which shows that the total internal energy of an isolated system is constant (nU = constant).

7.3.2 Second Law of Thermodynamics.  Conservation  of  total  mass  and  energy  are  insuffi-
cient  to  solve  many  phase-equilibrium  problems.  Processes  that  satisfy  these  conservation
equations may not be physically possible; that is, the process of a cold cup of coffee sponta-
neously heating up on your dinner table would satisfy the first law of thermodynamics but has
a near zero probability to occur. Processes have a natural direction to them in that spontaneous
processes  tend  to  dissipate  gradients  (e.g.,  Darcy’s  law  for  pressure  gradients  and  Fick’s  law
for  concentration  gradients)  in  the  system  until  equilibrium  is  reached.  A  system  that  is  not
subject to forced flows of mass or energy from its surroundings will evolve to a time-invariant
state  that  is  uniform  or  composed  of  uniform  subsystems—the  equilibrium  state.  The  second
law  of  thermodynamics  introduces  a  new  thermodynamic  property,  entropy,  and  provides  a
mathematical statement that describes this unidirectional nature of processes.

The second law also has implications for the efficiency of processes. Heat and work are not
of the same quality in that work can be efficiently converted to thermal energy (e.g., frictional
heat  losses),  but  thermal  energy  can  be  only  partially  converted  into  mechanical  energy  (e.g.,
steam  power  plants).  Thus,  work  is  a  more  valuable  form  of  energy  than  heat—work  has  a
high  quality.  Furthermore,  energy  at  higher  temperatures  is  more  useful  than  energy  at  lower
temperatures. For example, the ocean contains an immense amount of energy, but it is not very
useful because of its low temperature. Energy is degraded when heat transfers from one system
to another of lower temperature. Entropy is a measure of the energy degradation or disorder of
the system.

Entropy is a thermodynamic property just like temperature and pressure. Entropy is a state
function,  in  which  changes  during  a  reversible  process  in  a  closed  system  are  given  by  the
ratio Q /T. Entropy increases as T decreases or Q increases.

Entropy is related to the likelihood that equilibrium will be reached. Entropy is best under-
stood by examining a very simple example at the microscopic scale. Fig. 7.5 shows the initial
state of a hypothetical closed system that contains four molecules. The system is initially parti-
tioned into two halves, such that the molecules from one half cannot move into the other half.
One  molecule  is  in  the  left  subsystem  and  three  are  in  another,  thus,  the  pressures  are  not
initially the same. Each subsystem has only one possible configuration—the initial state. Thus,
the subsystems are well ordered, and entropy is initially small.

When  the  partition  is  removed,  however,  the  molecules  from  each  subsystem  are  free  to
move into the other half of the system, and a total of 16 different configurations are possible,
as  shown  in  Fig.  7.5.  Because  each  of  these  configurations  is  equally  likely,  the  probability
that the system will be found in its original configuration is only 1/16 (i.e., 2–4). The system is
more likely to contain two molecules in each subsystem (probability of 6/16 or 3/8), which is
the equilibrium state—the most disordered state. Entropy is related to the maximum number of
possible configurations of the system, and thus, the entropy after the partition is removed has
increased. The configurations could also be arrangements of energy quanta, instead of molecu-
lar arrangements, as in this example.

Although the original configuration for four molecules is not improbable, real systems con-
tain many more molecules. For example, if one mole of a gas were present in the system (6.0
× 1023 molecules), the likelihood that the system would be found in its initial state would be
very  unlikely  (2−6  ×  1023).  However,  the  probability  that  the  system  would  contain  a  similar

removed, the molecules are free to move around the entire system by Brownian motion. Equilibrium is
the most likely final state.

number of molecules on each side would be near 1.0 (i.e., the pressure would be equal through-
out the closed system).

The steps to write the entropy balance for an open system are similar to those for the first

law of thermodynamics. We allow for the following:

1. Mass flows into or out of the system at only one location on the boundary of the system.
The  mass  flow  rate  into  the  system  is  positive,  whereas  flow  rates  out  of  the  system  to  the
surroundings are negative.

2. Mass  can  carry  entropy  into  or  out  of  the  system.  The  rate of  entropy  transfer  into  the

system by mass flow is given by Sn˙.

3. Energy in the form of heat may enter or leave the system across the system boundaries
at  a  specified  exterior  temperature,  T.  Heat  transfer  is  positive  when  heat  is  exchanged  from

Chapter 7—Thermodynamics and Phase Behavior

I-343

the surroundings to the system. Entropy, Q /T, is transferred from the surroundings to the sys-
tem  during  heat  transfer.  The  rate  of  entropy  transfer  into  the  system  by  heat  transfer  is
therefore  Q˙
T .

4. The  temperature  at  the  boundary  or  exterior  of  the  system  is  equal  to  the  temperature

within the system (i.e., the heat transfer process is reversible).

5. Unlike total energy or mass, entropy is generated within a system that is not in equilibri-
um.  Entropy  generation  is  related  to  irreversibilities  in  the  system  such  as  temperature  gradi-
ents,  pressure  gradients,  or  concentration  gradients.  The  second  law  of  thermodynamics  states
that entropy generation is always positive.

With these assumptions and definitions, the entropy balance is

d(nS)

dt

= Sn˙ + Q˙

T + S˙G, ....................................................... (7.9)

where the term on the left is the change in total entropy within the system (S is entropy/mole),
and the first two terms on the right are the net rate of total entropy transported into or out of
the system by mass and heat transfer. The last term is the internal generation rate of entropy
within the system. In thermodynamic shorthand, the entropy balance can be written as

d(nS) = Sdn + dQ

T + dSG. ................................................... (7.10)

For closed systems (dn = 0), the entropy balance becomes d(nS) = dQ
tems (dn = 0 and dQ = 0), the entropy balance is

T + dSG. For isolated sys-

d(nS) = dSG. .............................................................. (7.11)

In an isolated system at equilibrium, the total entropy cannot change with time. Thus, the gen-
eration  of  entropy  must  be  zero  at  equilibrium  (dSG = 0),  which  we  stated  previously.  Away
from  equilibrium,  entropy  generation  is  positive  (dSG > 0),  which  implies  that  entropy,  in  an
isolated system, increases with time and reaches a maximum at equilibrium.
Why  is  entropy  generation  positive  away  from  equilibrium?  Consider  an  isolated  system
that  is  composed  of  two  open  subsystems  A  and  B.4  Heat  is  exchanged  only  from  the  high
temperature subsystem A to the low temperature subsystem B. Thus, the rate of heat transfer is
Q˙ A = − Q˙ B = − h(TA −TB),  where  h  is  a  constant  heat-transfer  coefficient.  Each  subsystem  is
well mixed so that T is always uniform [i.e., no internal gradients exist, and subsystems A and
B  must  pass  through  a  succession  of  equilibrium  states  (i.e.,  the  process  is  reversible  and
S˙GA = S˙GB = 0)].  From  Eq.  7.9  and  the  expressions  for  the  rate  of  heat  transfer,  the  entropy

temperatures  are  positive  and  the  heat  transfer  coefficient  is  positive,  this  result  demonstrates
that entropy generation is always positive away from equilibrium. At equilibrium TA = TB, and
the entropy generation term is zero, as stated before. Furthermore, the rate of entropy genera-
tion  is  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  gradients  (temperature  difference  in  this  case).  If  the
temperature gradients are kept small with time (infinitesimal equilibrium steps), entropy genera-
tion remains near zero.

A  process  is  reversible  if  it  occurs  with  small  gradients  (i.e.,  consists  of  a  succession  of

infinitesimal equilibrium steps). Thus, dSG = 0 for a reversible process, and from Eq. 7.10,

d(nS) = Sdn +

For a closed system that undergoes a reversible process, Eq. 7.12 reduces to dQrev = Td(nS).
In  summary,  the  second  law  of  thermodynamics  states  that  the  rate  of  entropy  generation
within a system must be greater than or equal to zero. A process for which the rate of genera-
tion  of  entropy  is  always  zero  is  a  reversible  process.  A  large  rate  of  entropy  generation
corresponds to greater process irreversibilities.

7.3.3 Fundamental Property Relations and Equilibrium Conditions.  We would like to calcu-
late thermodynamic properties and the equilibrium state from a simplified mathematical model,
called  an  equation-of-state  (EOS).  To  do  this,  we  need  equations  that  relate  thermodynamic
quantities in terms of pressure, molar volume, and temperature data (PVT data), and we want
to eliminate any path dependence by eliminating all properties that are not state functions. Sub-
stitution  of  Eq.  7.10  into  Eq.  7.7  by  elimination  of  dQ  (a  path  dependent  quantity)  and
selection of a reversible path (such that dSG = 0) gives

d(nU ) = Hdn +Td(nS) −TSdn − pd(nV). ...................................... (7.13)

All of the properties in Eq. 7.13 are state functions; thus, Eq. 7.13 is independent of the path
or process. After combining like terms, Eq. 7.13 becomes

d(nU ) = Gdn +Td(nS) − pd(nV), ............................................. (7.14)

where  G ≡ H −TS  is  defined  as  the  molar  Gibbs  energy.  For  a  closed  system  (dn = 0),  Eq.
7.14 becomes

d(nU ) = Td(nS) − pd(nV). ................................................... (7.15)

Eqs. 7.14 and 7.15 are examples of fundamental property relations. Other fundamental property
relations are possible. For example, differentiation of the definition for total Gibbs energy gives
d(nG) = d(nH) −Td(nS) − (nS)dT.
 enthalpy  gives
d(nH) = d(nU ) + pd(nV) + (nV)d p. Substitution of these relations into Eq. 7.14 (or Eq. 7.15)
by elimination of the enthalpy term gives the fundamental property relation for the total Gibbs
free energy of a closed system as

 differentiation  of  the  total

Equilibrium Criteria for Single-Component Liquid/Vapor Systems.  Consider an isolated sys-
tem of a pure fluid with two phases, vapor and liquid. Initially, the temperature, pressure, and
other  properties  of  the  two  phases  are  not  in  equilibrium.  Fig.  7.6  illustrates  the  composite
isolated system in which each phase is treated as a subsystem.

We  begin  by  writing  the  differential entropy  change from  Eq.  7.14  for  each open  subsys-

tem. The vapor phase equation is

For an isolated system, the change in the total internal energy is zero (see Eq. 7.8), as is the
change  in  the  total  mass  and  volume.  Thus,  dnL = − dnV,  d(nU )L   = − d(nU )V,  and
d(nV)L = − d(nV)V. The differential entropy change for an isolated system at equilibrium must
also be zero (see Eq. 7.11). Eq. 7.20 becomes

two  equilibrium  criteria  are  obvious.  The  equilibrium  condition  that  the  Gibbs  free  energy  of
the phases is equal is not as obvious.

Other  systems  lead  to  similar  equilibrium  conditions.  For  example,  for  a  closed  system  at
constant pressure and temperature (d p = 0, dT = 0) the fundamental property relation from Eq.
7.16  becomes  d(nG) = 0.  Thus,  the  equilibrium  criterion  here  is  that  the  Gibbs  free  energy
must be a minimum. This criterion also leads to the equality of the Gibbs free energy of both
phases at equilibrium, GL = GV.
Fugacity of a Pure Fluid.  Fugacity criterion is often used as a substitute for the Gibbs free-
energy  criterion.  The  definition  for  fugacity  comes  from  an  analogue  with  ideal  gases  that  is
derived  for  a  closed  system  under  isothermal  conditions.  Eq.  7.16  for  an  isothermal  process
(dT = 0) is

d(nG) = (nV)d p. ........................................................... (7.21)

For an ideal gas, V = RT

p , and Eq. 7.21 becomes

d(nG)ig = nRT

p d p = nRTd( ln p). ............................................. (7.22)

Fugacity is defined by analogy for a fluid that is not ideal. That is, we define the fugacity, f,
based on a comparison with Eq. 7.22, which is written as

d(nG) = nRTd( ln f ). ....................................................... (7.23)

Eq. 7.23 shows that the value for fugacity is whatever is required to give the correct behavior
of  the  real  fluid.  More  exactly,  fugacity  measures  how  the  Gibbs  free  energy  of  a  real  fluid
deviates  from  that  of  an  ideal  gas.  Fugacity  has  units  of  pressure,  and  for  an  ideal  gas  the
fugacity is equal to the pressure (compare Eqs. 7.23 and 7.22).

We showed that at equilibrium for a pure fluid GL = GV. By integration of Eq. 7.23 under
isothermal conditions, the Gibbs free-energy criterion implies that the fugacity of the liquid and
vapor phases must also be equal at equilibrium. That is, at equilibrium for a pure fluid,

fL = fV. .................................................................. (7.24)

Chapter 7—Thermodynamics and Phase Behavior

I-347

We  would  like  an  expression  for  fugacity  in  terms  of  our  convenient  quantities  of  pressure,
molar volume, and temperature, so that an EOS can be used. Substitution of Eq. 7.21 into Eq.
7.23 gives

Vd p = RTd( ln f ).

Subtraction of  RTd p

The  fugacity  coefficient  is  therefore  equal  to  1.0  for  an  ideal  gas.  Eq.  7.25  requires  knowing
the compressibility factor as a function of pressure.

Models for compressibility factor, such as a cubic EOS, however, are typically not explicit
functions of pressure. A more convenient form would be to transform the integral with respect
to pressure to one with respect to volume. Eq. 7.25 can be transformed to

The importance of Eq. 7.26 is that the fugacity can be calculated if the molar volume, tempera-
ture,  and  pressure  are  known  over  the  full  range  of  molar  volumes  from  V  to  ∞.  Typically,
sufficient  laboratory  data  (p,  V,  T)  is  not  available,  and  mathematical  models,  such  as  cubic
EOS, are used. We will use Eqs. 7.24 and 7.26 in Sec. 7.4 to calculate the intensive and exten-
sive state of a pure fluid at equilibrium using a cubic EOS.

Equilibrium Criteria for Multicomponent Liquid/Vapor Systems.  The  procedure  to  deter-
mine  the  equilibrium  criterion  for  multicomponent  systems  is  similar  to  that  used  for  pure
fluids. We consider a closed system with a multicomponent mixture of n moles as illustrated in
Fig.  7.1.  Transfer  of  mass  from  one  phase  to  the  other  is  allowed,  but  the  overall  system  is
closed, such that the overall composition of the system is constant. Given the overall composi-

I-348

tions  (zi),  pressure,  and  temperature,  we  seek  to  determine  the  amount  of  liquid  and  vapor
present at equilibrium, as well as the component mole fractions for the phases (xi and  yi).
As before, the closed system consists of two subsystems, the liquid and vapor phases (see
Fig. 7.6). The primary difference between the derivation for pure fluids and the derivation for
multiple  components  is  that  the  fundamental  property  relations  for  the  open  system  must  be
modified  to  include  mass  transfer  of  different  components.  That  is,  we  must  compute  the
change in the total Gibbs energy of the liquid phase as small amounts of each component (dni)
are  transferred  from  the  vapor  phase  to  the  liquid  phase  (or  vice  versa  for  the  vapor  phase).
For example, Eq. 7.17 becomes

for the vapor phase. As for pure fluids, these two equations are added to obtain the differential
total Gibbs energy of the entire closed system. Because the differential total Gibbs free energy
of the closed system must be zero when pressure and temperature are constant, we obtain

d(nG) = d(nG)L + d(nG)V = ∑
i = 1

nc (μiLdniL + μiVdniV) = 0. ........................... (7.28)

Conservation  of  mass  requires  that  any  component  that  enters  a  phase  must  have  come  from
the other phase so that dniL = − dniV, and upon substitution into Eq. 7.28,

nc (μiL − μiV)dniL = 0.

Because the dni are independent and arbitrary, we must have at equilibrium

μiL = μiV,

Chapter 7—Thermodynamics and Phase Behavior

I-349

Eq.  7.29  says  that  at  equilibrium  the  chemical  potential  of  a  component  in  the  liquid  phase
must be equal to the chemical potential of the same component in the vapor phase. This equi-
librium criterion reduces to GL = GV  for the case of a pure fluid.
Fugacity of a Component in a Mixture.  The  equilibrium  criterion  expressed  as  component
fugacities is often used instead of chemical potentials. The reason for this is primarily one of
convenience because component fugacity has units of pressure. Just as for pure fluids, the fu-
gacity of a component is defined as an analogue to an ideal gas mixture.

Consider an ideal gas mixture at a temperature T. The pressure for n moles is  p = nRT

nV . In
this  mixture,  each  component  has  ni  moles.  If  ni  moles  of  each  component  in  this  mixture
occupy  the  same  total  volume  alone  at  the  same  temperature,  the  pressure  would  be

pi =
V . Division of this result by the pressure gives the partial pressure of a compo-

nent  in  an  ideal  gas  mixture.  That  is,   pi = yi p,  where   yi =
n  is  the  vapor  molar  fraction  of
each component. The sum of the partial pressures equals the pressure  p =∑i = 1

yi pi.

For  an  ideal  pure  gas  at  constant  temperature,  we  had  dGi

p d p = RTd ln p  (see  Eq.
7.22). It follows, therefore, that the partial molar Gibbs energy of a component should be eval-
uated at the partial pressure, or

ig = RT

ig = RTd ln pi = RTd ln (yi p). ............................................. (7.30)
For  a  real  mixture  (not  an  ideal  gas  or  solution),  the  component  fugacity  is  defined  by  ana-
logue with Eq. 7.30.

dGi

dGi = dμi = RTd ln f^ i, ..................................................... (7.31)

where  f^ i  is the fugacity of component i  in a mixture. The component fugacity for real fluids
is  sometimes  referred  to  as  a  corrected  partial  pressure.  Comparison  of  Eqs.  7.30  and  7.31
show  that  for  ideal  mixtures,   f^ i = yi p.  From  the  integration  of  Eq.  7.31  and  the  use  of  the
equilibrium criteria of Eq. 7.29, we obtain the equilibrium criteria for component fugacities as

f^ iL = f^ iV,

for i = 1, … , nc. ................................................ (7.32)

Eq. 7.32 is often used instead of the equality of chemical potentials to determine equilibrium.
To calculate component fugacities of a real mixture, we subtract the chemical potential for

component i in an ideal gas (Eq. 7.30) from both sides of Eq. 7.31. The result is

Eq. 7.34 is similar in form to Eq. 7.25 for a pure fluid. Table 7.1 compares the fundamen-

volumes  from  V  to  ∞.  Sufficient  laboratory  data  is  typically  not  available  for  the  integration
and an EOS must be used. We will use Eqs. 7.32 and 7.35 in Sec. 7.5 to calculate the inten-
sive and extensive state of a multicomponent mixture at equilibrium using a cubic EOS.

7.4 Volumetric Properties of Pure Fluids
The  phase  behavior  of  a  typical  pure  fluid  can  be  represented  on  a  pressure-temperature  dia-
gram, as illustrated in Fig. 7.7. From the Gibbs phase rule (Sec. 7.2.1), the number of degrees
of freedom are 3 − np, which means that one, two, or three phases can be present at equilibri-
um. For simplicity, these phases are shown as a solid, liquid, and a vapor, although numerous
additional solid and liquid phases are possible, as long as no more than three of those phases
coexist at equilibrium at the same temperature and pressure. Water, for example, has nine dif-
ferent  solid  phases,  each  of  which  has  a  different  crystalline  structure.6  At  the  pressure  and
temperature  of  the  Earth’s  surface,  however,  we  experience  only  one  solid,  liquid,  and  vapor
phase of water.

Chapter 7—Thermodynamics and Phase Behavior

I-351

Fig. 7.7—Illustration of a pressure-temperature diagram for a pure fluid. The path indicated from point A,
a vapor, to point B, a liquid, would never encounter an interface.

According to the Gibbs phase rule, there are no degrees of freedom when three phases are
in  equilibrium.  This  necessarily  implies  that  three  phases  must  be  in  equilibrium  only  at  one
temperature and pressure; this is the triple point indicated in Fig. 7.7. That is, we are not free
to choose the temperature and pressure at which three phases can coexist. The temperature and
pressure of the triple point are determined.

For two phases, however, the degrees of freedom are one, and we can set either the temper-
ature  or  the  pressure,  but  not  both.  Once  the  temperature  is  specified,  the  pressure  is  deter-
mined.  Thus,  two  equilibrium  phases  are  represented  by  curves  on  a  pressure-temperature
diagram. The sublimation curve gives the locus of points where solid and vapor are in equilib-
rium;  the  melting  or  fusion  curve  gives  the  locus  of  points  where  solid  and  liquid  are  in
equilibrium; and the vaporization or saturation curve gives the locus of points where the liquid
and vapor are in equilibrium. The pressure along the vaporization curve is called the vapor or
saturation pressure. For example, the pure fluid at temperature T1 in Fig. 7.7 has a vapor pres-
v.
sure of  p1
A single solid, liquid, or vapor phase can exist over a range of temperatures and pressures
(degrees of freedom are two). This is indicated in Fig. 7.7 by the three single-phase regions of
solid, liquid, and vapor.

When the temperature and pressure along the vaporization curve is increased to the critical
pressure,   pc,  and  temperature,  Tc,  the  interface  between  the  liquid  and  vapor  phases  becomes
indistinct. This occurs at the critical point shown in Fig. 7.7. Beyond the critical point, fluids
become “supercritical” and no phase interface is visible. For example, the vapor at point “A”
in Fig. 7.7 would become more liquid-like as the pressure and temperature are varied along the
semicircle to point “B,” a liquid. The fluid would never exhibit two phases during the process,
as identified by an interface. Because there is no actual boundary that defines the supercritical
region, fluids should be described in terms of liquid-like or vapor-like.

One  important  characteristic  of  critical  fluids  is  that  thermodynamic  properties  approach
each other; that is, the densities/viscosities of the vapor and liquid phases become the same at
the critical point. We often inject supercritical fluids, such as carbon dioxide, into reservoirs so
that, as the supercritical fluid and the reservoir fluid mix, phase interfaces disappear, facilitat-
ing production of hydrocarbon components previously not recovered (see the chapter on steam

accurate characterization of critical behavior is very important.

A  pressure-temperature  diagram  contains  no  information  about  molar  volume—just  phase
boundaries.  Consider  an  experiment  in  a  closed  system  that  is  held  at  constant  temperature
(ignoring  the  solid  phase).  The  experiment  is  designed  to  measure  pressure  as  the  volume  is
changed  and  is  generally  referred  to  as  a  PVT  experiment.  Fig.  7.8  illustrates  several  phase
behavior states that occur in a PVT experiment. The chapter on phase diagrams in this section
of  the  Handbook  outlines  similar  experiments  for  multicomponent  mixtures.  The  steps  in  the
PVT experiment for a pure fluid are listed next.

1. Place a known amount of a single-component fluid in a constant temperature PVT cell at
vapor state one, illustrated in Fig. 7.8. The molar volume of the fluid can be calculated from

2. Inject a volume of mercury into the cell. Calculate VV  again, and monitor the correspond-
ing  pressure  change.  Because  vapor  is  highly  compressible  and  the  mercury  is  highly  incom-
pressible,  the  pressure  change  with  decreasing  molar  volume  of  the  vapor  phase  will  be
relatively small. The fluid remains a vapor.

3. Continue to inject mercury until the vapor becomes saturated at state two. At this pres-

fixed  if  the  temperature  is  constant).  Because  the  pressure  does  not  change  with  decreasing
molar volume, the compressibility of the closed system is infinite.

5. Continue  to  inject  mercury  to  state  four  until  only  a  small  drop  of  vapor  remains  (for
multicomponent  mixtures,  this  is  the  bubble  point).  Calculate  the  saturated  liquid  molar  vol-
ume, VL.
6. Continue mercury injection to state five and calculate VL, while monitoring the pressure.
During  this  step,  the  fluid  remains  a  liquid,  and  the  pressure  rises  very  quickly  for  small
changes  in  the  molar  volume.  The  pressure  rises  quickly  with  decreasing  molar  volume  be-
cause liquids are nearly incompressible compared to vapors.

The  PVT  process  just  described  generates  an  isotherm  on  a  pressure-volume  diagram,  as
illustrated in Fig. 7.9. States one through five correspond to those in the isothermal PVT exper-
iment. A vapor pressure dome or two-phase envelope outlines the two-phase region. Along the
left  boundary  of  the  dome,  the  liquid  is  completely  saturated,  for  any  reduction  in  pressure
would  cause  a  bubble  of  vapor  to  form.  Along  the  right  boundary  of  the  dome,  the  vapor  is
saturated. To the left of the dome the liquid is subcooled, whereas to the right of the dome, the
vapor  is  superheated. Two  metastable states  have  been  observed  within  the  two-phase  region:
superheated liquid and subcooled vapor. These states are unlikely to exist in a reservoir where
nucleation is always present (see Ref. 2 on nucleation).

From the Gibbs phase rule, the pressure within the two-phase region along the T1 isotherm
remains at its corresponding vapor pressure as molar volume changes from states two to four
(i.e.,  VV  to  VL).  VV  in  Fig.  7.9  is  the  molar  volume  of  the  saturated  vapor,  whereas  VL  is  the
saturated liquid molar volume. VC is the molar volume of the fluid at its critical point.

I-354

The critical point, in which the molar volumes of the liquid and vapor become equal, is at
the apex of the dome in Fig. 7.9. The critical point must be at the apex because the isotherms
in  the  two-phase  region  are  horizontal,  as  required  by  the  Gibbs  phase  rule.  Thus,  the  slope
and the inflection point of the isotherm at the critical temperature must be zero. For isotherms
where T > TC, the molar volume (inverse of molar density) changes continuously from vapor-
like values to liquid-like values as the pressure increases.
The  isothermal  compressibility  of  the  fluid  is  given  by  the  inverse  of  the  slopes  of  the
isotherms. For isotherms where T < TC, the slope is small in the superheated vapor region, indi-
cating that the fluid compressibility is large. The slope is large in the subcooled liquid region,
indicating that the fluid is nearly incompressible. At the boundary of the two-phase dome, the
isothermal compressibility is discontinuous and is equal to infinity (zero slope). Compressibility
is  infinite  in  the  two-phase  region  because,  as  the  system  volume  is  decreased,  some  of  the
vapor  molecules,  which  occupy  more  space,  are  condensed  into  the  denser  liquid  phase  in
which they occupy less space.

For a two-phase mixture at constant temperature, such as that shown by state three in Fig.
7.9,  the  molar  phase  volumes,  VV  and  VL,  do  not  change  as  the  volume  of  the  closed  system
changes. This occurs because the pressure is constant in the two-phase region for a pure fluid.
Thus,  as  the  volume  is  changed,  the  molar  densities  of  the  vapor  and  liquid  phases  do  not
change, but only the molar fractions (or amounts) of the phases change. The overall density of
the two-phase mixture will change as the closed system is compressed or expanded.

For example, consider state three in the two-phase region at a temperature of T1. The vapor
molar  density  is   1
(at  state  four).  The
VV
mole fraction of vapor at state two is V. Extensive parameters, such as the total molar volume
of the two-phase mixture, can be calculated by

 (at  state  two),  whereas  the  liquid  molar  density  is   1

where  HL  is  the  molar  enthalpy  of  the  saturated  liquid,  and  HV  is  the  molar  enthalpy  of  the

Eq. 7.38 is known as a lever rule. The fluid quality is the molar volume fraction V  as a percent-
age.  An  illustration  of  quality  lines  is  given  in  Fig.  7.10.  A  quality  of  100%  is  a  saturated
vapor. State three in Fig. 7.10 has a quality of about 60%.

7.4.1 Phase Behavior Models of Pure Fluids.  An accurate characterization of phase behavior
is critical to the prediction of oil recovery. Often, sufficient PVT experimental data is not avail-
able, and mathematical models that are “tuned” to experimental data are needed. EOS calcula-
tions  are  used  for  this  purpose.  EOS  models  are  typically  easy  to  implement  in  a  numerical
simulator.

Fig. 7.10—Quality lines within the two-phase region on a pressure-volume diagram.

One of the first EOS was Boyle’s and Charles’s law. These laws were combined into the
ideal gas equation we use today,  pV = RT. The ideal gas equation is generally satisfactory for
vapors  at  pressures  below  a  few  atmospheres.  Numerous  other  types  of  EOS  were  developed
through the years,5 but the most widely used EOS type in the petroleum industry is the cubic
EOS.

Van der Waals developed the first cubic EOS. Unlike the ideal gas equation, which is limit-
ed to low pressure vapors, the van der Waals EOS attempted to provide good phase behavior
estimates for both liquids and vapors by using only one equation. He also developed the princi-
ple of corresponding states, which is frequently used in the petroleum industry today. Numer-
ous  cubic  EOS  models  are  available  today  that  give  better  accuracy  than  the  van  der  Waals’
EOS.  The  two  most  widely  used  cubic  EOS  are  the  Peng-Robinson  EOS8  and  modified  ver-
sions of the Redlich-Kwong EOS.9,10

Prediction of the phase behavior of real reservoir fluids is difficult because of the complex
interaction of molecules. Intermolecular forces of attraction and repulsion determine thermody-
namic properties for any mixture of molecules. The attraction forces allow fluids to form liquid
and solid phases, whereas repulsions are responsible for resistance to compression.

The  accuracy  of  any  EOS  depends  on  its  ability  to  model  the  attractions  and  repulsions
between molecules over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. EOS models are empirical
in  that  they  do  not  attempt  to  model  the  detailed  physics  but  only  the  cumulative  effect  in
terms  of  a  small  number  of  empirical  parameters.  Generally,  EOS  models  are  more  accurate
when  attractions  are  small,  which  explains  why  water,  a  polar  substance,  is  more  difficult  to
model.

Ideal Gas Equation.  The simplest and most fundamental EOS is the ideal gas equation, in

which the pressure, volume, and temperature of a fluid are related by

pV = RT. ................................................................. (7.39)

As stated previously, the behavior of a gas may be approximated by Eq. 7.39 if the pres-
sure  is  relatively  low  (i.e.,  less  than  a  few  atmospheres).  A  gas  is  ideal  if  molecular  interac-
tions  are  negligible,  something  that  could  only  occur  at  zero  pressure.  Thus,  molecular
interactions  are  negligible  at  zero  pressure;  therefore,  thermodynamic  properties,  such  as  the
molar internal energy of an ideal gas, are only a function of temperature.

I-356

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Real Fluid Equation.  Most fluids are not ideal. Real fluids, whether vapor or liquid, can be

defined by the compressibility factor

Z = pV

RT . .................................................................. (7.40)

Intensive thermodynamic properties, such as the molar internal energy, are a function of both
temperature and pressure for a real fluid. A common mistake is to believe that Eq. 7.40 is only
applicable to gases. Eq. 7.40 will be used later in this chapter to represent the behavior of any
phase, whether liquid or vapor.

Coefficient of Isothermal and Isobaric Compressibility.  For a single-phase fluid, we often
employ very simple equations-of-state that describe the relationships between pressure, temper-
ature,  and  molar  volume.  As  stated  previously,  molar  volume  is  a  state  function—it  is  not
determined by the process or path taken to that state. Thus, for every temperature and pressure,
there corresponds only one value of molar volume, and hence, we can write an equation that
describes differential changes in molar volume as

dV =(∂V
∂T ) p

isobaric compressibility of the fluid. The minus sign is introduced, per convention, to make the
compressibilities positive.

V (∂V
∂p)Tis  the  isothermal  compressibility  of  the  fluid,  and  cp = 1

Eq. 7.42 describes the fractional change in the molar volume for small changes in tempera-
ture  and  pressure.  Because  reservoirs  are  usually  thought  to  be  isothermal,  the  isothermal
compressibility is most often used in reservoir engineering. It is often written in terms of densi-
ty or formation volume factor (FVF) as

c = − 1

Second, when the process is isothermal, Eq. 7.42 reduces to  dV

V = − cd p. This result can

where subscript o  is a reference state. Eq. 7.43 is often referred to as the EOS for a constant
compressibility  fluid.  It  can  be  rewritten  in  a  more  familiar  form  as  V = Voe
ρ = ρoe
Third,  when  the  compressibility  of  the  fluid  is  both  constant  and  small,  and  the  pressure
change  is  not  too  large,  the  exponential  term  in  Eq.  7.43  can  be  simplified  so  that
V = Vo(1 − cΔp)or ρ = ρo(1 + cΔp). This result is often referred to as the EOS for a fluid with
a slight, but constant, compressibility.

Eq. 7.44 is exact, whether the fluid is a vapor or liquid. For an ideal gas, the compressibili-

ty  factor  is  constant  and  equal  to  1.0,  and  Eq.  7.44  reduces  to  c = 1
compressibility for an ideal gas is inversely proportional to pressure.

Cubic Equations-of-State.  The van der Waals EOS was the first EOS capable of represent-
ing  both  the  liquid  and  vapor.  The  van  der  Waals  EOS,  however,  is  not  used  because  of  its
lack  of  accuracy  near  critical  points.  The  Peng-Robinson  EOS  and  a  modified  version  of  the
Redlich-Kwong EOS are generally used (see Table 7.2 for comparison). Nevertheless, the sim-
plicity of the van der Waals EOS makes it useful in demonstrating several key concepts.

As  for  other  cubic  EOS,  the  van  der  Waals  EOS  describes  the  pressure  as  a  function  of

molar volume and temperature, which is written as
V − b − a

p = RT

V 2 , .......................................................... (7.45)
where  b  is  the  repulsion  parameter,  and  a  is  the  attraction  parameter.  The  first  term  on  the
right side of Eq. 7.45 attempts to represent the pressure deviation from an ideal gas that results
from molecules occupying and competing for space. The effective volume available for move-
ment  of  the  molecules  (on  a  molar  basis)  is  V  –  b—not  V,  as  it  would  be  for  an  ideal  gas.
Thus,  b  represents  the  smallest  possible  volume  that  one  mole  of  molecules  can  occupy  (no
space would exist between the molecules).

As  V  approaches  b,  the  denominator  in  the  first  term  on  the  right  side  becomes  small  so
that  pressure  increases  very  rapidly.  Because  b  is  based  on  the  effective  molecule  size,  the
value for b will change with the nature of the pure fluid and will determine the lower bound-
ary for the region of interest on a pressure-volume diagram (i.e., the physical region of interest
is only where V > b).

The  second  term  on  the  right  side  of  Eq.  7.45  accounts  for  the  attractive  forces  between
molecules. The attractive forces will be proportional to the square of the number of molecules
present and, thus,  1
V 2  on a macroscopic scale. The proportionality constant, a, depends on the
nature  and  strength  of  the  forces  between  the  molecules  and,  therefore,  the  fluid  type.  As  V
becomes large, the contribution of the attractive forces becomes small, and the second term on
the right side of Eq. 7.45 becomes negligible. Under these conditions, the van der Waals EOS
approaches the ideal gas equation (Eq. 7.39). This is also true for the other EOS in Table 7.2.

The van der Waals EOS can be rewritten in cubic form as

I-358

Determination of a and b From van der Waals EOS.  We  previously  demonstrated  that  an
isotherm on a pressure-volume diagram must have zero slope at the critical point. There is also
an inflection point there. Thus, any cubic EOS must be constrained by

Eq.  7.47  consists  of  two  equations  that  can  be  solved  simultaneously  to  determine  the  un-
knowns, a and b. This procedure can be somewhat tedious, especially for more advanced cubic
EOS.
A  simpler  method  is  to  recognize  that  Eq.  7.47  implies  that  only  one  volume  root  of  the
cubic EOS exists at the critical point. Mathematically, this can be expressed as (V −VC)3 = 0,
3 = 0.  Comparison  of  this  expansion  to  Eq.

The  result  shows  that  the  critical  compressibility  factor  is  constant  and  is  independent  of
the  fluid.  This  is  true  for  the  other  cubic  EOS  models  in  Table  7.2.  For  the  van  der  Waals
EOS, we obtained ZC = 3
8 = 0.375. In reality, the critical compressibility factor is not constant
for different fluids and is generally smaller than 0.3. For example, water has a critical compress-
ibility of about 0.23, and that of carbon dioxide is 0.27. The poor match of the van der Waals
EOS at the critical point explains why it is not used today. Both the Redlich-Kwong EOS and
the  Peng-Robinson  EOS  have  critical  compressibilities  closer  to  measured  values  (see  Table
7.2).

RTC

A constant critical compressibility factor means that only two of the three critical properties
can be satisfied at the critical point. For example, if critical pressure and temperature are speci-
fied,  the  critical  volume  will  not  be  correctly  predicted.  For  the  van  der  Waals  EOS,
VC = 3
. Thus, when the critical pressure and temperature are specified, the critical volume

or critical density of the fluid is likely in error. In general, liquid densities predicted by cubic
EOS exhibit greater error than do vapor densities. Ref. 2 gives a good description of how den-
sity predictions can be improved using volume translation parameters.

We  determined  a  and  b  only  at  the  critical  point.  Their  values  could  be  different  away
from  the  critical  point  and  could  be  functions  of  temperature.  Therefore,  in  general,

approach 1.0 at the critical point. For most cubic EOS, β is taken to be 1.0, and α is adjusted
to give the correct vapor pressure (see Table 7.2).

Construction of Pressure-Volume Diagram From Cubic EOS.  Once  a  and  b  are  defined,  a
cubic  EOS  can  be  used  to  generate  the  pressure-volume  diagram,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  7.9.
From  the  Gibbs  phase  rule,  there  is  only  one  degree  of  freedom  within  the  two-phase  region
for pure fluids. We assume that temperature has been specified but not the pressure. Our goal,
therefore, is to solve for the vapor pressure, given temperature and the critical properties of the
fluid.

The procedure used to estimate a and b ensures that the cubic EOS gives the experimental-
ly measured shapes of the isotherms for temperatures greater than or equal to the critical point.
Fig. 7.11  illustrates the  isotherms  generated from  a  cubic EOS.  As  shown  by  the  loop  in  the
curve, cubic EOS can have three roots for isotherms below the critical temperature. The loop is
not physical because the pressure must be constant in the two-phase region.

The nonphysical condition must be removed to achieve the correct physical response in the
two-phase region. That is, the loop within the two-phase region must be discarded and replaced

The areas above and below the dashed line should be equal when the pressure is equal to the equilibrium
vapor pressure (Maxwell’s equal-area rule).

by the correct vapor pressure. The procedure is relatively simple. Within the two-phase region,
there are three roots along an isotherm. At the vapor pressure, the root with the largest molar
volume is taken to be the molar volume of the saturated vapor VV, whereas the smallest root is
VL. The middle root is discarded because choosing that root would lead to unstable phases (see
Sec. 7.2.2). The middle root is clearly nonphysical in that it is located on the isotherm where
(∂p
∂V )T > 0(i.e., pressure increases as density decreases).
Principle of Corresponding States.  Correlations for reservoir fluids, such as the generalized
compressibility factor charts for natural gases, use reduced temperature, pressure, and volume,
where TR = T
. A cubic EOS shows why these parameters give good

correlations. For example, substitution of the reduced parameters into the van der Waals EOS
(Eq. 7.45), along with the definitions of a and b, gives

Eq. 7.48 is dimensionless and is often called the reduced form of the van der Waals EOS. The
reduced form leads directly to the principle of corresponding states. The two-parameter princi-
ple of corresponding states says that all fluids, when compared at the same reduced tempera-
ture and pressure, have approximately the same compressibility factor, and all deviate from ideal-
gas  behavior  by  about  the  same  degree.  The  reduced  compressibility  factor  is  given  by
Z
. Because ZC is constant for a cubic EOS, the compressibility factor is constant for
ZC
the same reduced temperature and pressure (reduced volume is related to reduced pressure and
temperature through Eq. 7.48).

The principle of corresponding states is a powerful idea even though it is only qualitatively
correct. Experiments show that ZC  is not constant for different fluids. Nevertheless, it demon-

In reality, fluids can deviate from the principle of corresponding states. Pitzer noted that a
plot of  1
v  for simple fluids (molecules that are roughly spherical in shape such

as  the  Noble  gases)  collapse  onto  a  straight  line  (see  Fig.  7.12).  The  parameter,   pR
reduced pressure at the vapor pressure. Other more complex and nonspherical molecules such
as hydrocarbon-chained molecules, however, do not plot on that same line. Thus, Pitzer defined
an additional correlation variable called the acentric factor, where

ω = − 1.0 − log 10(pR

v) | TR = 0.7 = log 10

pC

10(pv)TR = 0.7

.

The  acentric  factor  measures  the  deviation  of  complex  fluids  from  the  simple  fluids  at  a
reduced  temperature  of  0.70  (see  Fig.  7.12).  Hydrocarbons  with  longer  chains  generally  have
greater acentric factors. For example, methane has an acentric factor of 0.008, while n-butane
has an acentric factor of 0.193.

Because the acentric factor is simple to measure, it is often used to improve phase-behavior
calculations  from  cubic  EOS.  The  three-parameter  principle  of  corresponding  states  is  that  a
fluid will have about the same compressibility factor as another fluid, if the reduced pressure,
reduced temperature, and acentric factors are similar.

Calculation of Vapor Pressure.  Although the shape of an isotherm from a cubic EOS can
be  made  qualitatively  correct,  the  problem  remains  that  the  vapor  pressure  is  unknown  for  a
given  temperature.  The  vapor  pressure  is  determined  using  the  equilibrium  criterion  of  Eq.
7.24. For example, substitution of the Soave Redlich-Kwong EOS into Eq. 7.25 and subsequent
integration gives the fugacity as a function of pressure, molar volume, and temperature. That is,

f = p exp ln( V

V − b) +( aα

RTb) ln( V

V + b) + Z − 1 − ln Z .

I-362

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Fig. 7.13—Procedure for determination of vapor pressure for a pure fluid.

The fugacity of the vapor is computed using the molar volume of the vapor phase, VV, whereas
the  liquid  fugacity  is  determined  using  VL.  Thus,  the  fugacity  for  the  vapor  phase  from  the
Soave Redlich-Kwong EOS is

fV = p exp ln( VV

VV − b) +( aα

RTb) ln( VV

VV + b) + ZV − 1 − ln ZV , .................... (7.49)

VL − b) +( aα

RTb) ln( VL

VL + b) + ZL − 1 − ln ZL , .................... (7.50)

where ZL =

RT .

The problem of calculating the vapor pressure reduces to finding the pressure that gives the
required  phase  molar  volumes  so  that  the  fugacities  of  the  phases  are  equal.  Fig.  7.13  illus-
trates the procedure. The procedure works well as long as the initial guess for the pressure is
in the range of the cubic EOS where three roots exist (i.e., the pressure is within the loop of
the cubic EOS). If the pressure is above the critical pressure, only one root exists for the molar
volume.  This  is  also  true  if  the  pressure  is  below  the  minimum  value  of  the  loop  (the  mini-
mum pressure of the loop could be negative).

For  a  pure  fluid,  the  vapor  pressure  can  also  be  determined  graphically  with  Maxwell’s
equal area construction. Fig. 7.11 shows that the vapor pressure is the pressure required so that
the  areas  bounded  by  the  vapor  pressure  line  and  the  loop  of  the  cubic  EOS  must  be  equal.
The  equal  area  construction  results  from  the  equality  of  Gibbs  energy  (or  fugacities).  This

reduced  temperature  at  40°C  is  0.913).  Fig.  7.14  shows  the  isotherm  at  40°C  calculated  with
the SRKEOS.

Based on the calculated isotherm, we select an initial value of 10 bars for the vapor pres-
sure. Any value within the S-loop of the isotherm would be satisfactory as an initial guess for
the vapor pressure. A vapor pressure of 13.8 bars is calculated with the iteration procedure of
Fig.  7.13.  The  calculated  vapor  pressure  is  the  pressure  at  which  the  fugacities  of  the  vapor
and liquid phases are equal (illustrated in Figs. 7.11 and 7.14 by the Maxwell equal-area rule).
The  fugacities  are  11.3  bars  at  the  vapor  pressure,  which  are  calculated  with  Eqs.  7.49  and
7.50.  The  equilibrium  liquid  molar  volume  is  105  cm3/mol,  and  the  vapor  molar  volume  is
1462 cm3/mol.

Fig. 7.14 also illustrates the phase behavior with the SRKEOS at a higher temperature of 70°
C. The calculated vapor pressure at this temperature is 26.2 bars. The equilibrium liquid molar
volume is 128 cm3/mol, and the vapor molar volume is 691 cm3/mol. Thus, as the temperature
is increased, the size of the two-phase region shrinks. Fig. 7.14 shows the two-phase envelope
that  connects  the  liquid  and  vapor  molar  volumes.  At  the  critical  temperature,  the  two-phase
region disappears.

The values for vapor pressure and molar volumes are calculated parameters only. Using the
critical temperature and pressure, the critical volume from the SRKEOS is approximately 241
cm3/mol  (ZC = 1/3  always  for  the  SRKEOS).  The  actual  critical  volume  from  experimental

I-364

data is 200 cm3/mol, which is about 20 percent smaller than the calculated value. Ref. 2 out-
lines  a  more  complex method to  improve the  calculated match of  cubic EOS  to  experimental
data.

7.5 Volumetric Properties of Mixtures
The  interaction  of  the  different  molecules  in  a  mixture  causes  behavior  not  observed  in  pure
fluids. The chapter on phase diagrams in this section of the handbook describes the volumetric
behavior  of  mixtures.  Sec.  7.5  presents  the  basic  procedure  to  predict  the  equilibrium  phase
behavior  of  mixtures  by  a  cubic  EOS.  More  detailed  information  can  be  found  in  many
sources, including Refs. 2 and 7.

The  thermodynamic  properties  of  a  mixture  can  be  calculated  with  the  same  EOS  for  a
pure fluid, with some modifications. The primary difference is that the mixture molar volume
for a phase is calculated with EOS constants and temperature-dependent functions of the phase
molar composition, either xi  or  yi. For example, the Soave Redlich-Kwong EOS written for a
mixture is

p =

RT

Vm − bm

−

(aα)m

Vm(Vm + bm) ,

where subscript m indicates a mixture property. The mixture properties are calculated with mix-
ing rules that are often linear or quadratic functions of the phase mole fractions. For example,
for the liquid phase, the mixing rule for the product, aα, is often the quadratic equation,

nc
(aα)m = ∑
i = 1

nc
∑
j = 1

xix j(aα)i j,

where  (aα)i j = (1 − ki j) (aα)i(aα) j.  The  parameters  ki j  are  called  binary  interaction  parame-
ters.  Binary  interaction  parameters  are  constants  that  are  determined  by  fitting  the  cubic  EOS
to  experimental  PVT  data.  The  mixing  rule  for  aα  is  theoretically  justified  from  virial  EOS,
which  are  discussed  in  Refs.  2  through  7.  For  bm,  the  linear  relationship,  bm =∑i = 1
xibi,  is
often used.
For equilibrium calculations, the fugacity of every component in each phase must be calcu-
lated. Eq. 7.35 is used for this purpose. For example, substitution of the Soave Redlich-Kwong
EOS into Eq. 7.35 gives the fugacity of a component in the liquid phase, which is written as

7.5.1 Procedure for Equilibrium Calculations of a Mixture.  The  procedure  for  equilibrium
calculations of a potential two-phase mixture is more complex than that of a pure fluid. For an
equilibrium flash calculation, the pressure and temperature and overall mole fractions are speci-
fied (i.e., pressure and temperature are now independent, as specified by the Gibbs phase rule).
The general procedure for a flash calculation is discussed next.

1. Make an initial guess of the K-values, where Ki =

. When the guess of the K-values is
near the equilibrium solution, the procedure will converge rapidly. If the guess is not good, the
procedure  might  not  converge  at  all.  Most  EOS  programs  use  some  empirical  correlation  to
estimate  the  phase  mole  fractions  based  on  K-values.  The  Wilson  equation11  is  often  used,

2. Calculate xi and  yi with the Rachford-Rice procedure.12 Once the K-values for each com-
ponent are specified, the Rachford-Rice procedure is used to estimate the phase mole fractions.
A material balance on each component gives zi = Lxi + (1 − L)yi, where L is the mole fraction
liquid  (see  Eq.  7.1).  Substitution  of   yi = Kixi  into  the  material  balance  equation  gives,  upon
rearrangement, xi =
. Substitution of these expres-

 or alternatively  yi =

sions into the function F(L) =∑i = 1
= 0. This is
a nonlinear equation that can best be solved by a simple Newton-Raphson iteration, where for
each iteration the new value of the liquid mole fraction is found from  Lnew = Lold − F(Lold)

For the first iteration, choose L = 0.5 and iterate until ( Lnew

L + (1 − L)Ki

3. Calculate the cubic EOS parameters (e.g., am  and bm). This step is very straightforward
and  depends  on  the  selected  EOS  and  its  associated  mixing  rules.  The  critical  temperatures,
pressures, and acentric factors for each component are needed to calculate the EOS parameters.
4. Solve the cubic EOS for the phase molar volumes VmL and VmV. This step requires solu-
tion of the cubic EOS for the compressibility factor, Z, of the vapor and liquid (or alternatively
for  VV  and  VL).  Because  the  compositions  of  the  vapor  and  liquid  are  different,  two  separate
solutions  for  the  roots  of  the  cubic  EOS  are  required.  A  cubic  equation-solver  or  iteration
method should be used to obtain the roots of the EOS.

The procedure for this step is more complex than for a pure fluid because six roots of the
cubic EOS are calculated (i.e., three roots for the liquid and three for the vapor). The middle
root for the vapor and liquid are discarded because that solution leads to unstable phases, simi-
lar to pure fluids. One of the remaining two liquid roots is paired with one of the other vapor
roots to calculate component fugacities and equilibrium. If the wrong root pairing is selected,
the  solution  could  be  false  in  that  an  unstable  or  metastable  solution  could  be  obtained.  The
correct  equilibrium  solution  is  the  one  that  minimizes  the  total  Gibbs  energy  compared  with
the other possible root-pairings. Refs. 2 and 7 provide a good description of how to select the
liquid  and  vapor  roots  so  that  the  total  Gibbs  energy  of  the  two-phase  mixture  is  minimized.
For most cases, the correct root for the liquid is the one that gives the smallest molar volume,
and the correct root for the vapor is the one that gives the largest molar volume.

Refs.  2  and  7  also  examine  using  stability  analyses  to  determine  whether  a  mixture  will
form  three  phases  instead  of  just  one  or  two  phases.  The  chapter  on  phase  diagrams  in  this

I-366

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

section  of  the  handbook  discusses  the  formation  of  three  equilibrium  phases  in  CO2/crude  oil
systems.

5. Calculate the component fugacities of each component in each phase,  f^ iV  and  f^ iL. The
selected  cubic  EOS  is  used  to  determine  an  expression  for  the  fugacity  of  a  component  in  a
phase (see Eq. 7.51 for example).

6. Check to see if equilibrium has been reached. A good criterion is ( f^ iV
found exactly, we accept the solution if ( f^ iV

− 1) < 10−5 for
− 1) < 10−5 for each component. The tolerance of

all components. If the criteria are satisfied, equilibrium has been obtained. The correct equilib-
rium  solution  is  found  when   f^ iL = f^ iV  for  each  component.  Because  the  solution  is  never

f^ iL

f^ iL

10−5can be decreased if better accuracy is required.

7. If  the  criteria  have  not  been  satisfied,  the  K-values  should  be  updated  and  steps  two
through six repeated. This step is also very important; it affects both the rate of convergence
and whether the iteration converges at all. One procedure that works well is the simple succes-
f^ iL
sive substitution scheme that relies on the fact that φ^

.  At  equilibrium,  the  component  fugacities  are  equal  so  that

until  convergence  in  step  six  is  achieved.  Convergence  from  successive  substitutions  can  be
slow near the critical region. Other methods may be required when convergence is slow.2

7.6 Characterization of In-Situ Fluids
Phase behavior calculations require that all components and their properties be specified. Crude
oils, however, typically have hundreds of components, making the EOS procedure in Sec. 7.5
computationally  intensive.  Thus,  components  are  often  lumped  into  pseudocomponents  to  ap-
proximate  the  in-situ  fluid  characterization.  The  characterization  usually  takes  the  following
three steps:

1. The  hydrocarbon  components  in  the  in-situ  fluid  are  analyzed  using  analytical  tech-
niques, such as chromatography or distillation. New analytical techniques often give a reliable
analysis  for  hydrocarbon  components  up  to  C30,  instead  of  the  traditional  C7.  Properties  for
hydrocarbon components greater than C30 are reported as a C30+ fraction.

2. The measured components are separated and lumped into a minimum number of pseudo-
components. The chosen number of pseudocomponents is often a result of the measured fluid
characterization and the degree of accuracy required (see step three). The properties and selec-
tion of the pseudocomponents are determined using a variety of methods as reported in Ref. 7.
The  required  pseudocomponent  properties  are  those  needed  for  the  cubic  EOS  calculations,
such as critical temperature, pressure, and acentric factor.

3. The pseudocomponent properties are adjusted to match all available phase behavior data
(e.g., PVT reports). This process, which typically uses nonlinear regression, is known as EOS
tuning.  EOS  tuning  is  needed  because  of  the  inherent  uncertainty  in  the  properties  estimated
from step two, especially for the heavier components. Binary interaction parameters are typical-
ly  the  first  parameters  to  be  adjusted,  although  all  of  the  parameters  may  need  some  tuning.

Chapter 7—Thermodynamics and Phase Behavior

I-367

The number of pseudocomponents may need to be increased from step two to obtain a good fit
of the calculated phase behavior with the measured phase behavior data.

The  selection  of  pseudocomponents  and  their  property  values  are  likely  not  unique,  as  is
often  the  case  when  numerous  model  parameters  are  estimated  by  fitting  measured  data  with
nonlinear regression. Care should be taken to avoid estimates in the pseudocomponent proper-
ties  that  are  unphysical  and  to  reduce  the  number  of  parameters.  Furthermore,  the  final  EOS
characterization is most accurate in the range of the measured phase behavior data. Phase be-
havior  data  should  be  collected  that  covers,  as  much  as  possible,  the  conditions  that  occur  in
the reservoir. The characterization should be updated when new data becomes available.

Finally,  fluid  characterizations  may  vary  from  one  location  in  the  reservoir  to  another.  In
such cases, multiple EOS characterizations might be required. Compositional variations can oc-
cur  for  a  variety  of  reasons.  For  example,  gravity  can  cause  vertical  compositional  gradients,
where  heavier  components  become  more  concentrated  at  greater  depths.  Refs.  2,  13,  and  14
provide examples of gravitational concentration gradients. Variations caused by thermal gradi-
ents are also discussed in Ref. 2.

8.1 Introduction
Petroleum reservoir fluids are complex mixtures containing many hydrocarbon components that
range in size from light gases such as methane (C1) and ethane (C2) to very large hydrocarbon
molecules containing 40 or more carbon atoms. Nonhydrocarbon components such as nitrogen,
H2S, or CO2 also may be present. Water, of course, is present in essentially all reservoirs. At a
given temperature and pressure, the components distribute between the solid, liquid, and vapor
phases present in a reservoir. A phase is the portion of a system that is homogeneous, is bound-
ed  by  a  surface,  and  is  physically  separable  from  other  phases.  Equilibrium  phase  diagrams
offer convenient representations of the ranges of temperature, pressure, and composition within
which various combinations of phases coexist. Phase behavior plays an important role in a vari-
ety  of  reservoir  engineering  applications,  ranging  from  pressure  maintenance  to  separator
design  to  enhanced  oil  recovery  (EOR)  processes.  This  chapter  reviews  the  fundamentals  of
phase diagrams used in such applications. Additional material on the role of phase equilibrium
in petroleum/reservoir engineering can be found in Refs. 1 and 2.

8.2 Phase Diagrams for a Single Component
Fig. 8.1 summarizes the phase behavior of a single component. The saturation curves shown in
Fig. 8.1 indicate the temperatures and pressures at which phase changes occur. At temperatures
below the triple point, the component forms a vapor phase if the pressure is below that indicat-
ed by the sublimation curve and forms a solid phase at pressures above the curve. At pressures
and temperatures lying on the sublimation curve, solid and vapor can coexist. At pressures and
temperatures on the melting curve, solid and liquid are in equilibrium. At higher temperatures,
liquid and vapor can coexist along the vaporization or vapor-pressure curve. If the pressure is
greater than the vapor pressure, a liquid forms; if the pressure is lower than the vapor pressure,
a vapor forms. The vapor-pressure curve terminates at the critical point. At temperatures above
the critical temperature, Tc, a single phase forms over the entire range of pressures. For a sin-
gle component, the critical temperature is the maximum temperature at which two phases can
exist.  Critical  temperatures  of  hydrocarbons  vary  widely.  Small  hydrocarbon  molecules  have
low critical temperatures, while large hydrocarbon molecules have much higher critical temper-
atures.  Critical  pressures  generally  decline  as  the  molecular  size  increases.  For  instance,  the

I-372

critical  temperature  and  pressure  of  C1  are  –117ºF  and  668  psia;  for  decane,  the  values  are
652ºF and 304 psia.

For many reservoir engineering applications, liquid/vapor equilibrium is of greatest interest,
although  liquid/liquid  equilibria  are  important  in  some  EOR  processes.  Solid/liquid  phase
changes, such as asphaltene or paraffin precipitation (see the chapter on crude oil emulsions in
this volume), occasionally occur in petroleum production operations.

Fig. 8.2 shows typical volumetric behavior of a single component in the range of tempera-
tures and pressures near the vapor-pressure curve in Fig. 8.1. If the substance under considera-
tion  is  placed  in  a  pressure  cell  at  constant  temperature,  T1,  below  Tc  and  at  a  low  pressure
(point A, for instance), it forms a vapor phase of high volume (low density). If the volume of
the sample is decreased with the temperature held constant, the pressure rises. When the pres-
sure  reaches  pv(T1),  the  sample  begins  to  condense.  The  pressure  remains  constant  (see  Sec.
8.3) at the vapor pressure until the sample volume is reduced from the saturated vapor volume
(VV) to that of the saturated liquid (VL). With further reductions in volume, the pressure rises
again as the liquid phase is compressed. Small decreases in volume give rise to large pressure
increases in the liquid phase because of the low compressibility of liquids. At a fixed tempera-
ture,  T2,  above  the  critical  temperature,  no  phase  change  is  observed  over  the  full  range  of
volumes and pressures. Instead, the sample can be compressed from high volume (low density)
and low pressure to low volume (high density) and high pressure with only one phase present.

8.3 The Phase Rule
The  number  of  components  present  in  a  system  determines  the  maximum  number  of  phases
that can coexist at fixed temperature and pressure. The phase rule of Gibbs states that the num-
ber  of  independent  variables  that  must  be  specified  to  determine  the  intensive  state  of  the
system is given by

F = 2 + nc − np − Nc, ........................................................ (8.1)

Chapter 8—Phase Diagrams

I-373

Fig. 8.2—Volumetric behavior of a pure component in the vapor/liquid region.

where F is the number of degrees of freedom, nc is the number of components, np is the num-
ber  of  phases,  and  Nc  is  the  number  of  constraints  (e.g.,  chemical  reactions).  For  a  single-
component system, the maximum number of phases occurs when there are no constraints (Nc =
0) and no degrees of freedom (F = 0). Thus, the maximum number of possible phases is three.
Therefore, if three phases coexist in equilibrium (possible only at the triple point), the pressure
and  temperature  are  fixed.  If  only  two  phases  are  present  in  a  pure  component  system,  then
either  the  temperature  or  the  pressure  can  be  chosen.  Once  one  is  chosen,  the  other  is  deter-
mined.  If  the  two  phases  are  vapor  and  liquid,  for  example,  choice  of  the  temperature  deter-
mines  the  vapor  pressure  at  that  temperature.  These  permitted  pressure/temperature  values  lie
on the vapor-pressure curve in Fig. 8.1.

In a binary system, two phases can exist over a range of temperatures and pressures. The

number of degrees of freedom is calculated by

F = 2 − Nc; ................................................................ (8.2)

therefore, both the temperature and pressure can be chosen, although there is no guarantee that
two phases will occur at a specific choice of T and p.

For multicomponent systems, the phase rule provides little guidance because the number of
phases is always far less than the maximum number that can occur. However, for typical appli-
cations, the temperature, pressure, and overall composition of a system are known in advance.
This  allows  the  number  of  phases  in  the  system  to  be  predicted  by  stability  analysis,  as  de-
scribed  in  the  chapter  on  phase  behavior  in  this  volume.  Secs.  8.4  through  8.8  introduce  the
types  of  phase  diagrams that can  be  used  to  portray  the  thermodynamic phenomena that play
important roles in oil and gas production.

8.4 Binary Phase Diagrams
Fig. 8.3 is a pressure-composition (p-x-y) phase diagram that shows typical vapor/liquid phase
behavior for a binary system at a fixed temperature below the critical temperature of both com-
ponents.  At  pressures  below  the  vapor  pressure  of  Component  2,  pv2,  any  mixture  of  the  two

ature of both components.

components forms a single vapor phase. At pressures between pv1 and pv2, two phases can coex-
ist  for  some  compositions.  For  instance,  at  pressure  pb,  two  phases  will  occur  if  the  mole
fraction of Component 1 lies between xB and xE. If the mixture composition is xB, it will be all
liquid; if the mixture composition is xE, it will be all vapor. At constant temperature and pres-
sure,  the  line  connecting  a  liquid  phase  and  a  vapor  phase  in  equilibrium  is  known  as  a  tie
line. In binary phase diagrams such as Fig. 8.3, the tie lines are always horizontal because the
two phases are in equilibrium at a fixed pressure. For 1 mole of mixture of overall composi-
tion, z, between xB and xE, the number of moles of liquid phase is

L =

xE − z
xE − xB

. ............................................................... (8.3)

Eq. 8.3 is an inverse lever rule because it is equivalent to a statement concerning the dis-
tances  along  a  tie  line  from  the  overall  composition  to  the  liquid  and  vapor  compositions.
Thus, the amount of liquid is proportional to the distance from the overall composition to the
vapor composition, divided by the length of the tie line.

Phase diagrams such as Fig. 8.3 can be determined experimentally by placing a mixture of
fixed overall composition in a high-pressure cell and measuring the pressures at which phases
appear and disappear. For example, a mixture of composition xB would show the behavior indi-
cated qualitatively in Fig. 8.4. At a pressure less than pd (Fig. 8.3), the mixture is a vapor. If
the mixture is compressed by injecting mercury into the cell, the first liquid, which has compo-
sition xA, appears at the dewpoint pressure, pd. As the pressure is increased further, the volume
of liquid grows as more and more of the vapor phase condenses. The last vapor of composition
xE disappears at the bubblepoint pressure, pb.

If  the  system  temperature  is  above  the  critical  temperature  of  one  of  the  components,  the
phase  diagram  is  similar  to  that  shown  in  Fig.  8.5.  At  the  higher  temperature,  the  two-phase

region  no  longer  extends  to  the  pure  Component  1  side  of  the  diagram.  Instead,  there  is  a
critical point, C, at which liquid and vapor phases are identical. The critical point occurs at the
maximum  pressure  of  the  two-phase  region.  The  volumetric  behavior  of  mixtures  containing
less Component 1 than the critical mixture, xc, is like that shown in Fig. 8.4. Fig. 8.6 shows
the  volumetric  behavior  of  mixtures  containing  more  Component  1.  Compression  of  the  mix-
ture of composition x2 (in Fig. 8.5) leads to the appearance of liquid phase of composition x1
when pressure pd1 is reached. The volume of liquid first grows and then declines with increas-
ing pressure. The liquid phase disappears again when pressure pd2 is reached. Such behavior is
called “retrograde vaporization” or “retrograde condensation” if the pressure is decreasing.

If the system temperature is exactly equal to the critical temperature of Component 1, the
critical point on the binary pressure-composition phase diagram is positioned at a Component 1
mole fraction of 1.0. Fig. 8.7 shows the behavior of the two-phase regions as the temperature
rises. As the temperature increases, the critical point moves to lower concentrations of Compo-
nent  1.  As  the  critical  temperature  of  Component  2  is  approached,  the  two-phase  region
shrinks, disappearing altogether when the critical temperature is reached.

Fig. 8.8 shows a typical locus of critical temperatures and pressures for a pair of hydrocar-
bons. The critical locus shown in Fig. 8.8 is the projection of the critical curve in Fig. 8.7 onto
the  p-T  plane.  Thus,  each  point  on  the  critical  locus  represents  a  critical  mixture  of  different
composition, although composition information is not shown on this diagram. For temperatures
between the critical temperature of Component 1 and Component 2, the critical pressure of the
mixtures can be much higher than the critical pressure of either component. Thus, two phases
can coexist at pressures much greater than the critical pressure of either component. If the dif-
ference in molecular weight of the two components is large, the critical locus may reach very
high pressures. Fig. 8.9 gives critical loci for some hydrocarbon pairs.3

The binary phase diagrams reviewed here are those most commonly encountered. However,
more  complex  phase  diagrams  involving  liquid/liquid  and  liquid/liquid/vapor  equilibriums  do
occur  in  hydrocarbon  systems  at  very  low  temperatures  (well  outside  the  range  of  conditions
encountered  in  reservoirs  or  surface  separators)  and  in  CO2/crude  oil  systems  at  temperatures
below approximately 50°C. See Refs. 4 and 5 for reviews of such phase behavior.

temperature of Component 1.

8.5 Ternary Phase Diagrams
Phase behavior of mixtures containing three components is represented conveniently on a trian-
gular diagram such as those shown in Fig. 8.10. Such diagrams are based on the property of
equilateral triangles that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any point to each side of
the diagram is a constant equal to the length of any of the sides. Thus, the composition of a
point in the interior of the triangle can be calculated as

x1 =

L1
LT

,

x2 =

L2
LT

,

x3 =

L3
LT

, .............................................. (8.4)

where

LT = L1 + L2 + L3. ........................................................... (8.5)

Several  other  useful  properties  of  triangular  diagrams  are  a  consequence  of  this  fact.  For
mixtures along any line parallel to a side of the diagram, the fraction of the component of the
corner  opposite  to  that  side  is  constant  (Fig.  8.10b).  In  addition,  mixtures  lying  on  any  line
connecting  a  corner  with  the  opposite  side  contain  a  constant  ratio  of  the  components  at  the
ends of the side (Fig. 8.10c). Finally, mixtures of any two compositions, such as A and B in
Fig.  8.10d,  lie  on  a  straight  line  connecting  the  two  points  on  the  ternary  diagram.  Composi-
tions  represented  on  a  ternary  diagram  can  be  expressed  in  volume,  mass,  or  mole  fractions.
For vapor/liquid equilibrium diagrams, mole fractions are most commonly used.

Fig. 8.11 shows the typical features of a ternary phase diagram for a system that forms a
liquid and a vapor at fixed temperature and pressure. Mixtures with overall compositions that
lie inside the binodal curve will split into liquid and vapor. Tie lines connect compositions of

liquid  and  vapor  phases  in  equilibrium.  Any  mixture  with  an  overall  composition  along  a  tie
line  gives  the  same  liquid  and  vapor  compositions.  Only  the  amounts  of  liquid  and  vapor
change  as  the  overall  composition  changes  from  the  liquid  side  of  the  binodal  curve  to  the
vapor side. If the mole fractions of Component i in the liquid, vapor, and overall mixture are
xi, yi, and zi, the fraction of the total moles in the mixture in the liquid phase is given by

. ................................................................ (8.6)

Eq. 8.6 is another lever rule similar to that described for binary diagrams. The liquid and
vapor portions of the binodal curve meet at the plait point, a critical point at which the liquid
and vapor phases are identical. Thus, the plait-point mixture has a critical temperature and pres-
sure  equal  to  the  conditions  for  which  the  diagram  is  plotted.  Depending  on  the  pressure,
temperature, and components, a plait point may or may not be present.

Any one ternary diagram is given for fixed temperature and pressure. As either the temper-
ature  or  pressure  is  varied,  the  location  of  the  binodal  curve  and  slopes  of  the  tie  lines  may
change. Fig. 8.12 shows the effect of increasing pressure on ternary phase diagrams for mix-
tures  of  C1,  butane  (C4),  and  decane  (C10)  at  160°F.6,7  The  sides  of  the  ternary  diagram
represent a binary system; therefore, the ternary diagram includes whatever binary tie lines ex-
ist  at  the  temperature  and  pressure  of  the  diagram.  Fig.  8.13  shows  the  corresponding  binary
phase diagrams for the C1–C4 and C1–C10 pairs. The C4–C10 pair is not shown because it forms
two  phases  only  below  the  vapor  pressure  of  C4,  approximately  120  psia  at  160°F  (see  Fig.
8.9).

As Fig. 8.12 shows, at 1,000 psia the two-phase region is a band that stretches from the C1–
C10  side  of  the  diagram  to  the  tie  line  on  the  C1–C4  side.  If  the  pressure  is  increased  above
1,000  psia,  the  liquid  composition  line  shifts  to  higher  methane  concentrations;  methane  is
more soluble in both C4 and C10 at the higher pressure (see Fig. 8.13). The two-phase region
detaches from the C1–C4 side of the diagram at the critical pressure of the C1–C4 pair (approxi-
mately 1,800 psia). As the pressure increases above that critical pressure, the plait point moves
into the interior of the diagram (Fig. 8.12, lower diagrams). With further increases in pressure,

the  two-phase  region  continues  to  shrink.  It  would  disappear  completely  from  the  diagram  if
the pressure reached the critical pressure of the C1–C10 system at 160°F (nearly 5,200 psia).

According to the phase rule, three phases may coexist at a fixed temperature and pressure
for  some  ternary  systems.  Fig.  8.14  shows  the  general  structure  of  such  systems.  The  three-
phase region (3Φ) on a ternary diagram is represented as a triangle in Fig. 8.14. Any overall
composition lying within the three-phase region splits into the same three phases (I, II and III).
Only  the  amounts  of  each  phase  change  as  the  overall  composition  varies  within  the  three-
phase  region.  Given  1  mole  of  an  overall  mixture  in  the  three-phase  region,  the  geometrical
relations

determine the fraction of each phase. The edges of the three-phase region are tie lines for the
associated  two-phase  (2Φ)  regions;  thus,  there  is  a  two-phase  region  adjacent  to  each  of  the
sides  of  the  three-phase  triangle.  Three-phase  regions  can  exist  in  several  phase  diagrams  ap-
plied in the design of EOR processes. Examples are discussed in Secs. 8.7 and 8.8.

8.6 Quaternary Phase Diagrams
Phase diagrams for systems with four components can be represented conveniently on a tetrahe-
dral diagram like that shown in Fig. 8.15a, which shows a quaternary phase diagram calculated
with  the  Peng-Robinson8  equation  of  state  for  mixtures  of  methane  (C1),  C3,  C6,  and  hexade-
cane  (C16)  at  200°F  and  2,000  psia.  These  phase  diagrams  have  a  property  similar  to  that  of
ternary  diagrams:  the  sum  of  the  lengths  of  perpendicular  lines  drawn  from  a  composition
point  in  the  interior  of  the  diagram  to  the  four  faces  of  the  diagram  is  a  constant  length.
Hence, the fractions of four components can be represented by an extension of Eq. 8.4 to four
components.

The  faces  of  the  quaternary  diagram  are  ternary  phase  diagrams.  Fig.  8.15b  shows  the
ternary  diagram  for  the  ternary  methane  (C1)/hexane  (C6)/hexadecane  (C16)  system,  which  is
the bottom face of the quaternary diagram. The two-phase region is a band across the diagram,
and there is no critical point on that face. Fig. 8.15c shows the C1/C3/C16 system, which is the
left face of the quaternary diagram. That ternary system does have a critical point. While the
ternary diagram for C1/C3/C6 is not shown separately, it is qualitatively similar to the diagram
for the C1/C3/C16 system in Fig. 8.15c.

The two-phase region in the interior of the quaternary diagram is a 3D region of composi-
tion  space  bounded  by  the  ternary  two-phase  regions  on  the  faces.  Within  that  region,  every
mixture composition forms two phases, and each composition point lies on a tie line that con-
nects equilibrium vapor and liquid compositions. A vertical slice through the two-phase region
is shown in Fig. 8.15a, along with a few tie lines that lie in the interior of the diagram. The
mole fraction of liquid phase is still calculated with Eq. 8.6, which applies to systems with any
number of components.

Chapter 8—Phase Diagrams

I-381

Fig. 8.11—Ternary phase diagram at a constant temperature and pressure for a system that forms a liquid
and a vapor.

The boundary of the two-phase region in the interior of the quaternary diagram is divided
into  two  parts:  a  surface  that  includes  all  the  vapor-phase  compositions  and  a  corresponding
surface of liquid-phase compositions. The dividing line between the liquid and vapor surfaces
is a critical locus (the dotted line in Fig. 8.15c) that connects the critical point in the C1/C3/C16
face (Fig. 8.15a) with the critical point in the C1/C3/C6 face. The critical locus is a set of com-
positions at which the liquid and vapor phases have identical compositions and properties. The
compositions and limiting tie lines on the critical locus play important roles in the description
of EOR processes (see Sec. 8.8).

8.7 Reservoir Fluid Systems
Real reservoir fluids contain many more than two, three, or four components; therefore, phase-
composition  data  can  no  longer  be  represented  with  two,  three  or  four  coordinates.  Instead,
phase diagrams that give more limited information are used. Fig. 8.16 shows a pressure-temper-
ature  phase  diagram  for  a  multicomponent  mixture;  it  gives  the  region  of  temperatures  and
pressures at which the mixture forms two phases. The analog of Fig. 8.16 for a binary system
can  be  obtained  by  taking  a  slice  at  constant  mole  fraction  of  Component  1  through  the  dia-
gram  in  Fig.  8.7.  Also  given  are  contours  of  liquid-volume  fractions,  which  indicate  the
fraction of total sample volume occupied by the liquid phase; however, Fig. 8.16 does not give
any compositional information. In general, the compositions of coexisting liquid and vapor will
be different at each temperature and pressure.

At temperatures below the critical temperature (point C), a sample of the mixture described
in Fig. 8.16 splits into two phases at the bubblepoint pressure (Fig. 8.4) when the pressure is
reduced  from  a  high  level.  At  temperatures  above  the  critical  temperature,  dewpoints  are  ob-
served  (Fig.  8.6).  In  this  multicomponent  system,  the  critical  temperature  is  no  longer  the
maximum temperature at which two phases can exist. The critical point is the temperature and
pressure at which the phase compositions and all phase properties are identical.

The  bubblepoint,  dewpoint,  and  single-phase  regions  shown  in  Fig.  8.16  are  sometimes
used to classify reservoirs. At temperatures greater than the cricondentherm, which is the maxi-
mum temperature for the formation of two phases, only one phase occurs at any pressure. For

instance, if the hydrocarbon mixture in Fig. 8.16 were to occur in a reservoir at temperature TA
and pressure pA (point A), a decline in pressure at approximately constant temperature caused
by removal of fluid from the reservoir would not cause the formation of a second phase.

While  the  fluid  in  the  reservoir  remains  a  single  phase,  the  produced  gas  splits  into  two
phases  as  it  cools  and  expands  to  surface  temperature  and  pressure  at  point  A′.  Thus,  some
condensate  would  be  collected  at  the  surface  even  though  only  one  phase  is  present  in  the
formation. The amount of condensate collected depends on the operating conditions of the sep-
arator.  The  lower  the  temperature  at  a  given  pressure,  the  larger  the  volume  of  condensate
collected (Fig. 8.16).

Dewpoint reservoirs are those for which the reservoir temperature lies between the critical
temperature and the cricondentherm for the reservoir fluid. Production of fluid from a reservoir
starting  at  point  B  in  Fig.  8.16  causes  liquid  to  appear  in  the  reservoir  when  the  dewpoint
pressure is reached. As the pressure declines further, the saturation of liquid increases because
of retrograde condensation. Because the saturation of liquid is low, only the vapor phase flows
to  producing  wells.  Thus,  the  overall  composition  of  the  fluid  remaining  in  the  reservoir
changes continuously.

The phase diagram shown in Fig. 8.16 is for the original composition only. The preferential
removal of light hydrocarbon components in the vapor phase generates new hydrocarbon mix-
tures, which have a greater fraction of the heavier hydrocarbons. Differential liberation experi-
ments, in which a sample of the reservoir fluid initially at high pressure is expanded through a
sequence of pressures, can be used to investigate the magnitude of the effect of pressure reduc-
tion  on  the  vapor  composition.  At  each  pressure,  a  portion  of  the  vapor  is  removed  and
analyzed. These experiments simulate what happens when condensate is left behind in the reser-

at 160°F.

voir  as  the  pressure  declines.  See  Ref.  9  for  more  details  on  pressure/volume/temperature
experiments.

As the reservoir fluid becomes heavier, the boundary of the two-phase region in a diagram
like Fig. 8.16 shifts to higher temperatures. Thus, the composition change also acts to drive the
system toward higher liquid condensation. Such reservoirs are candidates for pressure mainte-
nance  by  lean  gas  injection  to  limit  the  retrograde  loss  of  condensate  or  for  gas  cycling  to
vaporize and recover some of the liquid hydrocarbons.

Bubblepoint reservoirs are those in which the temperature is less than the critical tempera-
ture  of  the  reservoir  fluid  (point  D  in  Fig.  8.16).  These  reservoirs  are  sometimes  called
undersaturated because the fraction of light components present in the oil is too low for a gas
phase to form at that temperature and pressure. Isothermal pressure reduction causes the appear-
ance  of  a  vapor  phase  at  the  bubblepoint  pressure.  Because  the  compressibility  of  the  liquid
phase is much lower than that of a vapor, the pressure in the reservoir declines rapidly during
production  in  the  single-phase  region.  The  appearance  of  the  much  more  compressible  vapor
phase reduces the rate of pressure decline. The volume of vapor present in the reservoir grows
rapidly with reduction of reservoir pressure below the bubblepoint.

Because  the  vapor  viscosity  is  much  lower  than  the  liquid  viscosity  and  the  gas  relative
permeability goes up markedly with increasing gas saturation, the vapor phase flows more easi-
ly.  Hence,  the  produced  gas/oil  ratio  climbs  rapidly.  Again,  pressure  maintenance  by  water-
drive,  water  injection,  or  gas  injection  can  improve  oil  recovery  substantially  over  the  10  to
20%  recovery  typical  of  pressure  depletion  in  these  solution-gas-drive  reservoirs.  As  in  dew-

I-384

point  reservoirs,  the  composition  of  the  reservoir  fluid  changes  continuously  once  the  two-
phase region is reached.

There  is,  of  course,  no  reason  why  initial  reservoir  temperatures  and  pressures  cannot  lie
within the two-phase region. Oil reservoirs with gas caps and gas reservoirs with some liquids
present are common. There also can be considerable variation in the initial composition of the
reservoir  fluid.  The  discussion  of  single-phase,  dewpoint,  and  bubblepoint  reservoirs  is  based
on  a  phase  diagram  for  one  fluid  composition.  Even  for  one  fluid,  all  the  types  of  behavior
occur  over  a  range  of  temperatures.  In  actual  reservoir  settings,  the  composition  of  the  reser-
voir fluid correlates with depth and temperature. Deeper reservoirs usually contain lighter oils.10
Fig. 8.17 shows the relationships between oil gravity and depth for two basins. The higher
temperatures  of  deeper  reservoirs  alter  the  original  hydrocarbon  mixtures  to  produce  lighter
hydrocarbons  over  geologic  time.10  Low  oil  gravity,  low  temperature,  and  relatively  small
amounts of dissolved gas all combine to produce bubblepoint reservoirs. High oil gravity, high
temperatures,  and  a  high  concentration  of  light  components  produce  dewpoint  or  condensate
systems.

8.8 Phase Diagrams for EOR Processes
Phase behavior plays an important role in a variety of EOR processes. Such processes are de-
signed  to  overcome,  in  one  way  or  another,  the  capillary  forces  that  act  to  trap  oil  during
waterflooding. Interpretation of phase diagrams is particularly important in the design of surfac-
tant/polymer processes and gas-injection processes.

8.8.1 Surfactant/Polymer Floods.  In surfactant/polymer displacement processes, the effects of
capillary forces are reduced by injection of surfactant solutions that contain molecules with oil-
and  water-soluble  portions.  Such  molecules  migrate  to  the  oil/water  interface  and  reduce  the
interfacial tension, thereby reducing the magnitude of the capillary forces that resist movement
of trapped oil.

Fig. 8.1811 shows phase diagrams typical of those used to describe the behavior of surfac-
tant systems. In these ternary diagrams, the components shown are no longer true thermodynam-
ic  components  because  they  are  mixtures.  A  crude  oil  contains  hundreds  of  components,  and
the brine and surfactant pseudocomponents also may be complex mixtures. The simplified rep-

resentation,  however,  has  obvious  advantages  for  describing  phase  behavior,  and  it  is  reason-
ably  accurate  as  long  as  each  pseudocomponent  has  approximately  the  same  composition  in
each  phase.  In  Fig.  8.18a,  for  instance,  the  “oil”  pseudocomponent  can  appear  in  an  oil-rich
phase or in a phase containing mostly surfactant and brine. If the oil solubilized into the surfactant/
brine phase is nearly the same mixture of hydrocarbons as the original “oil,” then the represen-
tation in terms of pseudocomponents is reasonable. The compositions shown in Fig. 8.18 are in
volume  fractions.  An  inverse  lever  rule  similar  to  Eqs.  8.3  and  8.6  gives  the  relationship  be-
tween the volumes of the two phases for a given overall composition, as Fig. 8.18 illustrates.

Fig. 8.18a is a phase diagram for the liquid/liquid equilibrium behavior typical of mixtures
of brines of low salinity with oil. If there is no surfactant present, the oil and brine are immis-
cible;  mixture  compositions  on  the  base  of  the  diagram  split  into  essentially  “pure”  brine  in
equilibrium with “pure” oil. The addition of surfactant causes some oil to be solubilized into a
microemulsion rich in brine. That phase is in equilibrium with a phase containing nearly pure
oil.  Thus,  in  the  low-salinity  brine,  the  surfactant  partitions  into  the  brine  phase,  solubilizing

some oil. The plait point in Fig. 8.18a lies close to the oil corner of the diagram. Because only
two phases occur and the tie lines all have negative slope, such phase is often called Type II(-).
Phase diagrams for high-salinity brines are often similar to Fig. 8.18b. In the high-salinity
systems,  the  surfactant  partitions  into  the  oil  phase  and  solubilizes  water  into  an  oil-external
microemulsion. In this case, the plait point is close to the brine apex on the ternary diagram.
For  intermediate  salinities,  the  phase  behavior  can  be  more  complex,  as  Fig.  8.18c  shows.  A
triangular three-phase region occurs (see Fig. 8.14) for which the phases are a brine-rich phase,
an oil-rich phase, and a microemulsion phase. There is a two-phase region adjacent to each of
the sides of the three-phase triangle. In Fig. 8.18c, the two-phase region at low surfactant con-
centrations is too small to show on the diagram. It must be present, however, because oil and
brine form only two phases in the absence of surfactant.

8.8.2 Gas-Injection Processes.  Miscible displacement processes are designed to eliminate in-
terfaces  between  the  oil  and  the  displacing  phase,  thereby  removing  the  effects  of  capillary
forces  between  the  injected  fluid  and  the  oil.  Unfortunately,  fluids  that  are  strictly  miscible
with oil are too expensive for general use. Instead, fluids such as C1, C1 enriched with interme-
diate hydrocarbons, CO2, or nitrogen are injected, and the required miscible-displacing fluid is
generated by mixing the injected fluid with oil in the reservoir. Phase behavior of gas/oil sys-
tems is often summarized in pressure-composition (p-x) diagrams.

Fig. 8.19 is an example of a p-x diagram for mixtures of CO2 (containing a small amount
of C1 contamination) with crude oil from the Rangely field.12 The behavior of binary mixtures
of CO2 with a particular oil is reported for a fixed temperature; therefore, the oil is represented
as a single pseudocomponent. The bubblepoint and dewpoint pressures, the regions of pressure
and composition for which two or more phases exist, and information about the volume frac-
tions  of  the  phases  are  indicated.  However,  the  diagrams  provide  no  information  about  the
compositions of the phases in equilibrium.

Fig. 8.20 illustrates the reason for the absence of composition data and gives data reported
by Metcalfe and Yarborough13 for a ternary system of CO2, C4, and C10. Binary-phase data for

basin and (b) Pennsylvanian Tensleep reservoirs in Wyoming.

14 and CO2–C10

15 systems also are included. Fig. 8.20 shows a triangular solid with-
the CO2–C4
in  which  all  possible  compositions  (mole  fractions)  of  CO2–C4–C10  mixtures  for  pressures
between 400 and 2,000 psia are contained. The two-phase region is bounded by a surface that
connects the binary-phase envelope for the CO2–C10 binary pair to that on the CO2–C4 side of
the diagram. That surface is divided into two parts-liquid compositions and vapor compositions.
Tie  lines  connect  the  compositions  of  liquid  and  vapor  phases  in  equilibrium  at  a  fixed
pressure.  Thus,  the  ternary  phase  diagram  for  CO2–C4–C10  mixtures  at  any  pressure  is  just  a
constant pressure (horizontal) slice through the triangular prism. Several such slices at different
pressures are shown in Fig. 8.20. At pressures below the critical pressure of CO2–C4 mixtures
(1,184 psia), both CO2–C10 and CO2–C4 mixtures form two phases for some range of CO2 con-
centrations.  At  400  and  800  psia,  the  two-phase  region  is  a  band  across  the  diagram.  Above
the critical pressure of CO2–C4 mixtures, CO2 is miscible with C4 and ternary slices at higher
pressures  show  a  continuous  binodal  curve  on  which  the  locus  of  liquid  compositions  meets
that of vapor compositions at a plait point. The locus of plait points connects the critical points
of the two binary pairs.

To see the effect of representing the phase behavior of a ternary system on a pseudobinary
diagram, consider a p-x diagram for “oil” composed of 70 mol% C10 and 30 mol% C4. At any
fixed pressure, the mixtures of CO2 and oil, which would be investigated in an experiment to
determine a p-x diagram, lie on a straight line (the dilution line), which connects the original
oil  composition  with  the  CO2  apex.  Thus,  a  p-x  diagram  for  this  system  is  a  vertical  slice
through the triangular prism shown in Fig. 8.20. The saturation pressures on a p-x diagram are
those at which the dilution plane intersects the surface that bounds the two-phase region. Bub-

blepoint pressures occur where the dilution plane intersects the liquid composition side of the
two-phase surface, while dewpoint pressures occur at the intersection with vapor compositions.
Comparison  of  the  phase  envelope  on  the  resulting  p-x  diagram  with  binary  phase  diagrams
yields the following observations.

• Tie lines do not, in general, lie in the dilution plane; they pierce that plane. This means
that the composition of vapor in equilibrium with a bubblepoint mixture on the p-x diagram is
not the same as that of the dewpoint mixture at the same pressure.

• The critical point on the p-x diagram occurs where the locus of critical points pierces the
dilution  plane.  It  is  not,  in  general,  at  the  maximum  saturation  pressure  on  the  p-x  diagram.
The maximum pressure occurs where the binodal curve in a horizontal slice is tangent to the
dilution  plane.  The  critical  point  on  the  p-x  diagram  can  lie  on  either  side  of  the  maximum
pressure, depending on the position of locus of plait points on the two-phase surface.

It is apparent from Fig. 8.20 that the composition of the original oil has a strong influence
on the shape of the saturation-pressure curve and on the location of the critical point on the p-
x  diagram.  If  the  oil  had  been  richer  in  C4,  the  critical  pressure  and  maximum  pressure  both
would have been lower. Thus, it should be anticipated that the appearance of p-x diagrams for
CO2/crude oil systems should depend on the composition of the oil.

Figs. 8.19 and 8.21 illustrate the complexity of phase behavior observed for CO2/crude oil
systems. Fig. 8.19 gives the behavior of mixtures of CO2 (with approximately 5% C1 as a con-
taminant) with Rangely crude oil at 160°F. The oil has a bubblepoint pressure of approximate-
ly 350 psia. Mixtures containing up to approximately 80 mol% CO2 (+ C1) show bubblepoints,
while  those  containing  more  CO2  show  dewpoints.  At  the  relatively  high  temperature  of  the

Rangely field, only two phases, a liquid and a vapor, form. At lower temperatures, more com-
plex phase behavior can occur.

Fig.  8.21  shows  the  behavior  of  mixtures  of  an  oil  containing  no  dissolved  gas  from  the
Wasson  field4  with  CO2.  At  90°F  and  105°F,  the  mixtures  form  a  liquid  and  a  vapor  at  low
pressures  and  two  liquid  phases  at  high  pressures  and  high  CO2  concentrations.  They  form
three  phases,  two  liquids  and  a  vapor,  for  a  small  range  of  pressures  at  high  CO2  concentra-
tions.  The  liquid/liquid  and  liquid/liquid/vapor  behavior  disappears  if  the  temperature  is  high
enough.  At  120°F  (Fig.  8.21c),  the  three-phase  region  disappears.  For  the  systems  studied  to
date, 120°F appears to be a reasonable estimate of the maximum temperature for liquid/liquid/
vapor separations. See Refs. 4 and 5 for detailed discussions of such phase behavior. Well-char-
acterized  ternary  systems  that  display  similar  behavior  are  described  by  Larsen  et  al.,16  who
report ternary diagrams like Fig. 8.14 for CO2/hydrocarbon systems.

8.8.3 Multicontact Miscibility in Gas-Injection Processes.  Phase  diagrams  of  the  types  de-
scribed here are often used to represent miscible gas-injection processes. The simplest form of
miscibility is first contact miscibility. It occurs when a given gas is injected into oil at a tem-
perature and pressure at which any mixture of the oil and gas result in a single-phase fluid. For
an oil/gas pair to be first contact miscible, the dilution line, which connects the oil composition
and the gas composition, cannot intersect the two-phase region. The lowest pressure at which
first contact miscibility can occur is the pressure at which the dilution line is tangent to the two-
phase boundary; therefore, this pressure is referred to as the first contact miscibility pressure.
However,  multicontact  miscibility  can  develop  at  pressures  lower,  often  substantially  lower,
than the first contact miscibility pressure.

For ternary systems, two mechanisms can lead to the development of a multicontact misci-
ble displacement: vaporizing drives and condensing drives. Fig. 8.22a demonstrates the features
of a vaporizing drive for the displacement of a C6–C16 mixture (O1) by pure C1. The displace-
ment composition path traverses the two-phase region along two key tie lines in compositional
space: the tie line that extends through the injected gas composition (the injection tie line) and
the tie line that extends through the initial oil composition (the initial tie line).17,18 As the pres-
sure  is  increased,  the  two-phase  region  shrinks  and,  at  some  point,  one  of  the  key  tie  lines
become a critical tie line (a tie line that is tangent to the two-phase region at a critical point).

Fig. 8.22b demonstrates the features of a condensing gas drive for a C1–C3 mixture displac-
ing oil consisting of C1 and C16. In this case, the injection tie line is closer to the critical point,
and as the pressure is increased, it is the first to become a critical tie line. For both cases, the
pressure at which one of the key tie lines become a critical tie line is known as the minimum
miscibility pressure (MMP).18 Thus, in three-component systems, a displacement can be multi-
contact miscible only if one of the two key tie lines is a critical tie line. If it is the initial oil
tie line that is critical, the displacement is a vaporizing drive, and if the injection gas tie line is
the critical tie line, the displacement is a condensing drive.

For four-component systems, the displacement path has been shown to include a third key
tie line referred to as the crossover tie line.19 Fig. 8.22c shows the crossover tie line. Just as in
the ternary displacements, miscibility develops when any one of the key tie lines reduces to a
critical  point.  If  the  pressure  in  Fig.  8.22c  is  increased,  the  crossover  tie  line  will  become  a
critical  tie  line  before  either  the  initial  or  injection  tie  lines.  Hence,  the  existence  of  the
crossover tie line introduces a third mechanism for the development of multicontact miscibility.
This mechanism is known as the combined condensing/vaporizing drive.20,21 Fig. 8.22c shows
that the displacement composition path for a four-component system in which a mixture of C1
and C3 displaces an oil containing C1, C6, and C16 includes a vaporizing segment connected to
a condensing segment by the crossover tie line.

With  each  additional  component  added  to  the  displacement  process,  another  crossover  tie
line  is  added  to  the  displacement  composition  path.  The  MMP  for  such  multicomponent  gas-
injection processes can be determined by locating the key tie lines and calculating the length of
these tie lines as the pressure is increased. The MMP is the pressure at which one of the key
tie lines has zero length. Fig 8.2322 reports the result of such a calculation for a 15-component
fluid description. In this system, the injection gas contains 11 components and is rich in C1 but
includes  N2,  CO2,  and  hydrocarbons  up  to  C7.  The  eighth  crossover  tie  lie  becomes  a  critical
tie line at the MMP of 5,350 psia. Displacements that display the combined condensing/vapor-
izing mechanism are common in oilfield fluid systems.

9.1 Introduction
Deposition  of  the  high-molecular-weight  components  of  petroleum  fluids  as  solid  precipitates
in surface facilities, pipelines, downhole tubulars, and within the reservoir are well-recognized
production  problems.  Depending  on  the  reservoir  fluid  and  the  type  of  recovery  process,  the
deposited  solid  may  consist  of  asphaltenes,  waxes,  or  a  mixture  of  these  materials.  The  de-
posits also can contain resins, crude oil, fines, scales, and water.1

This  chapter  discusses  the  experimental  measurement  and  thermodynamic  modeling  of  the
phase  behavior  of  solid  waxes  and  asphaltenes  in  equilibrium  with  fluid  hydrocarbon  phases.
Models for solid deposition in the reservoir and in pipelines also are presented. Although some
of  the  laboratory  techniques  for  determining  solid  precipitation  are  applicable  to  both  waxes
and asphaltenes, the characteristic behaviors of these materials can be very different; therefore,
wax and asphaltene topics are treated separately.

Sec. 9.1 presents some commonly observed behaviors of asphaltenic and waxy crudes. Sec.
9.2 gives the chemical characteristics of asphaltenes and waxes. Secs. 9.3 through 9.6 discuss
asphaltene  measurement,  precipitation  modeling,  and  deposition  modeling  and  provide  a  brief
review of remediation methods. Secs. 9.7 through 9.10 present the same sequence of topics for
waxes. See the chapters on phase behavior and phase diagrams in this section of the handbook
for  additional  information  on  hydrocarbon  phase  behavior.  Information  on  water/hydrocarbon
systems is given in the chapters on water hydration and crude oil emulsions.

9.1.1 Asphaltene-Precipitation Behavior.  Asphaltenes precipitation is caused by a number of
factors  including  changes  in  pressure,  temperature,  and  composition.  The  two  most  prevalent
causes  of  asphaltene  precipitation  in  the  reservoir  are  decreasing  pressure  and  mixing  of  oil
with injected solvent in improved-oil-recovery (IOR) processes. Drilling, completion, acid stim-
ulation,  and  hydraulic  fracturing  also  can  induce  precipitation  in  the  near-wellbore  region.  As
oil  flows  up  the  wellbore,  asphaltene  can  precipitate  as  a  result  of  pressure  and  temperature
changes. A summary of the different field and laboratory observations associated with asphal-
tene precipitation during primary depletion and IOR gas injection follows.

Asphaltene  Precipitation  During  Primary  Depletion.    In  normal  pressure  depletion,  reser-

voirs that experience asphaltene precipitation usually have the following characteristics2:

• The fluid in place is light to medium oil with small asphaltene content.

I-398

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

• The initial reservoir pressure is much larger than the saturation pressure. That is, the fluid

is highly undersaturated.

• Maximum precipitation occurs around the saturation pressure.
Heavier crudes that contain a larger amount of asphaltene have very few asphaltene-precipi-
tation  problems  because  they  can  dissolve  more  asphaltene.  Leontaritis  and  Mansoori3  and
Kokal and Sayegh4 compiled field cases with asphaltene-precipitation problems during primary
depletion.  Extreme  cases  include  the  Venezuelan  Boscan  crude  with  17  wt%  asphaltene  pro-
duced nearly without precipitation, whereas the Venezuelan Mata-Acema crude with 0.4 to 9.8
wt%  asphaltene  and  the  Algerian  Hassi  Messaoud  crude  with  0.062  wt%  encountered  serious
precipitation problems during production.

Asphaltene Precipitation During IOR Gas Injection.  The injection of hydrocarbon gases or
CO2 for IOR promotes asphaltene precipitation. Numerous field reports and laboratory studies
on this phenomenon have been published.4–12 Although it frequently manifests itself at the pro-
duction wellbore at solvent breakthrough, precipitation can occur anywhere in the reservoir.

Asphaltene precipitation also may occur during solvent injection into heavy-oil reservoirs.13
Butler and Mokrys14 proposed an in-situ solvent-extraction process for heavy oils and tar sands
called  VAPEX.  This  process  uses  two  horizontal  wells  (one  injector  and  one  producer).  The
injection  of  solvent  (e.g.,  propane)  creates  a  solvent  chamber  in  which  oil  is  mobilized  and
drained  toward  the  producer.  In  addition  to  the  mobilization  process,  the  solvent  may  induce
asphaltene precipitation, which provides an in-situ upgrading of the oil.

Asphaltene Precipitation and Deposition.  Sec. 9.2.2 discusses the chemistry of asphaltenes
and  nature  of  the  thermodynamic  equilibrium  of  asphaltenes  in  petroleum  fluids.  Changes  in
pressure, temperature, and composition may alter the initial equilibrium state and cause asphal-
tene precipitation.

The  region  in  which  precipitation  occurs  is  bounded  by  the  asphaltene  precipitation  enve-
lope  (APE).  Fig.  9.1  shows  a  typical  pressure-composition  APE  and  a  pressure-temperature
APE.15,16  The  APEs  also  are  referred  to  as  asphaltene  deposition  envelopes.  In  this  chapter,
precipitation refers to the formation of the asphaltene precipitate as a result of thermodynamic
equilibrium  and  deposition  refers  to  the  settling  of  the  precipitated  asphaltene  onto  the  rock
surface in a porous medium. The onset conditions correspond to points on the APE. Within the
APE, the amount of precipitated asphaltene increases as pressure decreases from the upper on-
set pressure to the saturation pressure of the oil. The precipitation reaches a maximum value at
the saturation pressure and decreases as pressure decreases below the saturation pressure.

Inside  the  reservoir,  after  precipitation  has  occurred,  the  asphaltene  precipitate  can  remain
in  suspension  and  flow  within  the  oil  phase  or  can  deposit  onto  the  rock  surface.  The  main
deposition  mechanisms  are  adsorption  and  mechanical  entrapment.  The  deposited  asphaltene
may plug the formation and alter rock wettability from water-wet to oil-wet.

9.1.2 Wax-Precipitation  Behavior.    Wax  components  can  precipitate  from  petroleum  fluids
when the original equilibrium conditions of the reservoir are changed so that the solubility of
the waxes is reduced; however, wax precipitation does not necessarily lead to deposition. Indi-
vidual  wax  crystals  tend  to  disperse  in  the  fluid  instead  of  depositing  on  a  surface.  If  the
number  of  wax  crystals  becomes  large  enough  or  if  other  nucleating  materials  such  as  as-
phaltenes, formation fines, clay, or corrosion products are present, the crystals may agglomer-
ate  into  larger  particles.  These  larger  particles  then  may  separate  out  of  the  fluid  and  form
solid deposits.

Fig. 9.2 shows a typical wax-precipitation envelope on a pressure-temperature diagram. In
contrast  to  the  APE,  the  solid/liquid-phase  boundary  is  nearly  vertical  for  waxes,  illustrating
wax precipitation’s strong dependence on temperature and weak dependence on pressure.

Fig. 9.2—Pressure-temperature wax precipitation envelopes (after Leontaritis16).

Temperature reduction is the most common cause of wax deposition because wax solubility
in hydrocarbon fluids decreases as the temperature is lowered.1 Reservoir fluid cooling occurs
throughout the producing fluid system. Cooling can be caused by oil and gas expansion at the
formation  face,  through  casing  perforations,  or  through  other  orifices  or  restrictions;  by  dis-
solved gas being liberated from solution; by radiation of heat from the fluid to the surrounding
formation as it flows up the wellbore; by transfer of the fluid through low-temperature surface
facilities; and by injection of water or other fluids at temperatures below the reservoir temperature.
Pressure  changes  usually  have  a  very  small  effect  on  wax-precipitation  temperatures  and
amounts; however, changes in the original equilibrium composition of the fluids can result in a
loss of wax solubility. A fairly consistent trend is that the lightest components in a crude oil

I-400

act as good solvents for waxes. Liberation of solution gas from a crude oil as pressure decreas-
es below the bubblepoint of the fluid has been shown to increase the cloud-point temperature
of the oil.17 This effect also has been observed in synthetic mixtures of methane, decane, and
heavy  n-alkanes  with  carbon  numbers  from  18  to  3018  and  for  stock-tank  oils  mixed  with
methane and carbon dioxide.19 This trend has been shown to be reversed in a study of two gas-
condensate fluids in which the cloud-point temperature decreases as pressure is reduced below
the vapor/liquid-phase boundary and may increase only at very low pressures.20 The addition of
intermediate  paraffinic,  naphthenic,  and  aromatic  components  with  carbon  numbers  from  5  to
10 has been shown experimentally to decrease the cloud-point temperature for two crude oils.21
Some model predictions contradict these results, indicating an increase in cloud-point tempera-
ture when pentane, hexane, or nonane were mixed with stock-tank oils.19

9.2 Characteristics of Asphaltenes and Waxes

9.2.1 Chemical  Classification  of  Petroleum  Fluids.    Petroleum-reservoir  fluids  are  complex
multicomponent mixtures. The chemical constituents of petroleum may be classified broadly as
belonging  either  to  the  C6-  or  the  C6+  fraction.  The  light  end,  or  C6-  fraction,  of  petroleum
fluids is composed of well-defined pure hydrocarbon components with carbon numbers up to 5
and the light gases N2, CO2 and H2S. The hydrocarbons in the light end primarily are straight-
chain normal alkanes (n-alkanes) and their branched isomers (i-alkanes). The heavy end, or C6+
fraction, consists of all the components with carbon numbers of 6 or greater.

Classification of Petroleum Constituents.  A  classification  system  and  nomenclature  com-
monly used in the petroleum industry describes components as belonging to the paraffinic (P),
naphthenic (N), or aromatic (A) fractions.22,23 These are often referred to jointly as PNA.

Paraffins.  This class includes n-alkanes and i-alkanes that consist of chains of hydrocarbon
segments (-CH2-, -CH3) connected by single bonds. Methane (CH4) is the simplest paraffin and
the most common compound in petroleum-reservoir fluids. The majority of components present
in solid-wax deposits are high-molecular-weight paraffins.

Naphthenes.  This class includes the cycloalkanes, which are hydrocarbons similar to paraf-
fins but contain one or more cyclic structures. The elements of the cyclic structures are joined
by single bonds. Naphthenes make up a large part of microcrystalline waxes.

Aromatics.  This class includes all compounds that contain one or more ring structures simi-
lar  to  benzene  (C6H6).  The  carbon  atoms  in  the  ring  structure  are  connected  by  six  identical
bonds that are intermediate between single and double bonds, which are referred to as hybrid
bonds, aromatic double bonds, or benzene bonds.

Resins and Asphaltenes.  Resins  and  asphaltenes  primarily  are  a  subclass  of  the  aromatics,
although some  resins  may  contain only  naphthenic rings.  They  are  large molecules consisting
primarily  of  hydrogen  and  carbon,  with  one  to  three  sulfur,  oxygen,  or  nitrogen  atoms  per
molecule.  The  basic  structure  is  composed  of  rings,  mainly  aromatics,  with  three  to  ten  or
more rings per molecule.

SARA Classification of Petroleum Constituents.  The components of the heavy fraction of a
petroleum fluid can be separated into four groups: saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes
(SARA).

• Saturates  include  all  hydrocarbon  components  with  saturated  (single-bonded)  carbon

atoms. These are the n-alkanes, i-alkanes, and cycloalkanes (naphthenes).

• Aromatics include benzene and all the derivatives composed of one or more benzene rings.
• Resins are components with a highly polar end group and long alkane tails. The polar end
group  is  composed  of  aromatic  and  naphthenic  rings  and  often  contains  heteroatoms  such  as
oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen. Pure resins are heavy liquids or sticky solids.

• Asphaltenes are large highly polar components made up of condensed aromatic and naph-

thenic rings, which also contain heteroatoms. Pure asphaltenes are black, nonvolatile powders.

The experimental method used to determine the weight fractions of these groups is called

SARA analysis.24

9.2.2 Asphaltene Characteristics.  Nature of Asphaltenes.  Asphaltenes  are  a  solubility  class
that  is  soluble  in  light  aromatics  such  as  benzene  and  toluene  but  is  insoluble  in  lighter
paraffins.25,26  They  normally  are  classified  by  the  particular  paraffin  used  to  precipitate  them
from crude (e.g., n-pentane or n-heptane). Fig. 9.3 from Mitchell and Speight25 shows that dif-
ferent  alkane  solvents  yield  different  amounts  of  precipitates.  Fig.  9.4  from  Speight  et  al.26
shows  dependence  of  the  aromacity  (hydrogen/carbon  atomic  ratio)  and  molecular  weight  of
asphaltene on the precipitating solvent. These figures also indicate that the amounts and natures
of asphaltenes precipitated with n-heptane or heavier alkanes are very similar. Ref. 26 provides
a summary of standard analytical methods for asphaltene separation with either n-pentane or n-
heptane.

Although  the  exact  nature  of  the  original  state  of  equilibrium  of  asphaltenes  in  petroleum
fluids is still under investigation, one characteristic is the tendency of asphaltenes to form ag-
gregates in hydrocarbon solutions. These aggregates are called micelles. The micelles and the
hydrocarbon medium form a colloidal system. One commonly held view is that the colloids are
stabilized  by  resins  adsorbed  on  their  surface,27,28  and  the  dispersion  of  colloids  in  the  fluid
form a two-phase system. Fig. 9.5 from Leontaritis29 schematically shows asphaltene-resin mi-
celles that are suspended in the oil. Colloids also may be solvated by the surrounding medium,
forming a true single-phase solution. Thermodynamic models (e.g., the solubility-parameter mod-
el of Hirschberg et al.)6 inherently assume the single-phase view. The role of resins in the single-
phase or two-phase solution models may be quite different.30 Changes in pressure, temperature,

ation and cause precipitation.

The  definition  of  asphaltenes  as  compounds  that  are  soluble  in  aromatics  such  as  toluene
and  insoluble  in  light  alkanes  are  referred  to  as  laboratory  asphaltenes  by  Joshi  et  al.31  As-
phaltenes  that  precipitate  in  the  field  from  a  depressurization  process  are  called  field  as-
phaltenes  and  contain  different  constituents.
 Laboratory  and  field  precipitates  contain
combinations of asphaltenes and resins. Speight24 referred to them as asphalts, but that distinc-
tion is not made here.

Fig. 9.6—SARA effect on the stability of several crude oils regarding asphaltene precipitation.32

Stability of Asphaltenic Crudes.  SARA  ratios  play  an  important  role  in  the  solubility  of
asphaltenes. Avila et al.32 performed SARA analyses on 30 Venezuelan oil samples and attempt-
ed to associate the SARA contents with asphaltene precipitation observed in the field. Fig. 9.6
shows the SARA contents of crude oils that experience asphaltene precipitation in the field and
those  that  do  not.  Crude  oils  with  a  high  content  of  saturates  and  low  contents  of  aromatics
and resins clearly are more prone to asphaltene precipitation.

Correlation for Asphaltene Precipitation With Alkanes.  Asphaltene precipitation at laborato-
ry  and  field  conditions  can  be  predicted  with  thermodynamic  models.  Sec.  9.4  discusses  this
topic  in  detail.  For  precipitation  with  alkanes  at  atmospheric  conditions,  a  simple  correlation
from Rassamdana et al.33 and Sahimi et al.34 can be used.

Fig. 9.7 from Sahimi et al.34 shows the experimental weight percents of precipitated asphal-
tene,  W  (g  of  precipitated  asphaltene/g  of  crude  oil  ×  100%),  as  a  function  of  the  solvent  to
crude oil ratio, R (cm3 of solvent /g of crude oil), from precipitation experiments of an Iranian
crude oil with n-C5, n-C6, n-C7, n-C8, and n-C10 at 26°C and atmospheric pressure. As expect-
ed, the amount of precipitates decreases with increasing solvent carbon number. Rassamdana et
al.33 and Sahimi et al.34 found that the experimental points in Fig. 9.7 could be collapsed onto
a scaling curve of Y vs. X with

X = r /(Ma)1 / 4.............................................................. (9.1)

and Y = W R2, .............................................................. (9.2)

where  Ma  is  the  molecular  weight  of  the  alkane  solvent.  Fig.  9.8  shows  the  resulting  scaling
curve. This curve can be represented accurately by a cubic order polynomial:

9.2.3 Characteristics of Petroleum Waxes.  This section discusses the phase behavior and prop-
erties  of  wax-forming  components,  primarily  normal  alkanes,  relevant  to  understanding  and
modeling wax-phase behavior.

Types of Petroleum Waxes.  Petroleum waxes are complex mixtures of n-alkanes, i-alkanes,
and cycloalkanes with carbon numbers ranging approximately from 18 to 65.35 The minimum
energy-chain  structure  of  alkanes  is  a  flat  zig-zag  of  carbon  atoms  with  the  hydrogen  atoms
located in planes passing through the carbon atoms perpendicular to the chain axes. Fig. 9.936
shows this structure schematically for typical petroleum-wax components.

There  are  two  general  classes  of  petroleum  waxes.  Waxes  composed  primarily  of  normal
alkanes crystallize in large flat plates (macrocrystalline structures) and are referred to as paraf-
fin waxes. Waxes composed primarily of cycloalkanes and i-alkanes crystallize as small needle
structures and are referred to as microcrystalline waxes.35 Table 9.1 shows a comparison of the
properties of paraffin and microcrystalline waxes as given by Gilby.37 Musser and Kilpatrick38
isolated waxes from sixteen different crude oils and found that paraffinic waxes had molecular
weight ranges of 350 to 600, while microcrystalline waxes had large molecular weight ranges
of  300  to  2,500.  Of  the  16  oils  analyzed,  five  exhibited  microcrystalline  wax  deposition,  six
precipitated paraffinic waxes, and the remaining five showed a mixture of paraffinic and micro-
crystalline waxes.

In addition to the possibility of precipitating mixtures of the two different types of waxes,
the  crystal  structures  in  solid-wax  deposits  will  be  malformed  to  some  degree  because  of  the
complex precipitation environment encountered in petroleum production. Crystal imperfections

may occur when the temperature of the solution is decreased rapidly or when heavy aromatic
components of the oil are incorporated into the lattice structure. The presence of molecules that
hinder the lattice formation result in a wax phase composed of many small, independent crystal
lattices.39

Precipitation of Petroleum Waxes.  Solid-wax formation consists of two distinct stages: nu-
cleation  and  crystal  growth.  As  the  temperature  of  a  liquid  solution  is  lowered  to  the  wax-
appearance  temperature  (WAT),  the  wax  molecules  form  clusters.  Wax  molecules  continue  to
attach and detach from these clusters until they reach a critical size and become stable. These
clusters  are  called  nuclei  and  the  process  of  cluster  formation  is  called  nucleation.  Once  the
nuclei are formed and the temperature remains below the WAT, the crystal-growth process oc-
curs as further molecules are laid down in a lamellar or plate-like structure.40

Nucleation is described as either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Homogeneous nucleation
occurs  in  liquids  that  are  not  contaminated  with  other  nucleating  materials.  In  this  case,  the
development of nucleation sites is time dependent. Heterogeneous nucleation occurs when there
is  a  distribution  of  nucleating  material  throughout  the  liquid.  If  there  is  sufficient  nucleating
material,  heterogeneous  nucleation  can  be  nearly  instantaneous.  Pure  hydrocarbon  mixtures  in
laboratories  rarely  undergo  heterogeneous  nucleation,39  whereas  crude  oil  in  the  reservoir  and
production  tubing  will  most  likely  nucleate  this  way  because  of  the  presence  of  asphaltenes,
formation fines, clay, and corrosion products.

Solidification Behavior of Normal Alkanes.  Turner41 reviewed the properties of normal alka-
nes  found  in  petroleum  waxes,  including  solid-phase  transitions,  crystal  structures,  and  phase
behavior of binary mixtures. Fig. 9.10 shows experimental data42,43 and correlation predictions44
for  normal  alkane-melting  temperatures  at  atmospheric  pressure  as  a  function  of  carbon  num-
ber.  In  addition  to  the  solid/liquid-phase  transition  indicated  in  this  figure,  many  normal
alkanes undergo solid/solid-phase transitions within a few degrees below the melting point.35

Normal  alkanes  can  assume  four  different  crystal  structures:  hexagonal,  orthorhombic,  tri-
clinic, and monoclinic. For normal alkanes with odd carbon numbers from 11 to 43 and even
carbon numbers from 22 to 42, the crystal structure formed on cooling from a melt is hexago-
nal.  This  structure  has  a  high  degree  of  molecular-rotational  freedom  and  is  characteristically

Chapter 9—Asphaltenes and Waxes

I-407

plastic and translucent. All the other crystal structures are restricted rotationally, resulting in a
hard  deposit  and  opaque  appearance.  The  even-carbon-number  alkanes  from  12  to  20  form  a
triclinic  structure  on  cooling  from  the  melt,  whereas  all  alkanes  with  carbon  numbers  43  or
greater form an orthorhombic structure on cooling from the melt. This is also the stable low-
temperature form of the alkanes with odd carbon numbers less than 43, which is achieved by
further cooling from the hexagonal structure. The monoclinic structure is never attained direct-
ly  from  the  melt  but  is  assumed  by  the  even-carbon-number  alkanes  on  cooling  from  the
hexagonal or orthorhombic structures.

Solidification Behavior of Alkane Mixtures.  Binary mixtures of wax-forming n-alkanes are
completely miscible in the liquid state. In general, these binary mixtures form continuous-solid
solutions  if  both  molecules  are  similar  in  form  and  dimension  and  exhibit  the  same  crystal
structure in their pure state. Practically, this means that single-phase-solid solutions form when
the molecular length difference is less than 6%. For n-alkanes with carbon numbers 18 to 35,
the critical length difference is 2 to 6 carbon atoms.41 The behavior of binary mixtures depends
on whether the constituents are both odd-numbered alkanes, both even-numbered alkanes, or a
mixture  of  odd-  and  even-numbered  alkanes  because  of  the  different  pure  component  crystal
structures.

The solid-phase behavior of binary mixtures also has been observed to be time and temper-
ature  dependent.  Dorset45,46  shows  that  some  mixtures,  such  as  C30  with  C36,  form  metastable
continuous-solid  solutions  that  separate  into  eutectics  with  complete  fractionation  of  the  con-
stituents over a period of days. Other mixtures, such as C30 with C40, show complete immisci-
bility immediately on cooling.

For binary mixtures that form continuous-solid solutions, the stable low-temperature config-
uration  is  an  orthorhombic  structure,  which  is  slightly  different  from  the  pure  component
orthorhombic crystal. This occurs for systems in which one alkane is contaminated with even 1
or 2% neighboring alkanes.35 This same structure has been observed for synthetic ternary and
higher mixtures, as well as for diesel fuels.47 The diesel fuels exhibited an amorphous (micro-
crystalline)  solid  phase  in  addition  to  the  orthorhombic  macrocrystalline  phase.  Pedersen
et  al.48  and  Hansen  et  al.49  also  noted  the  probable  existence  of  solid/solid-phase  transitions
with variations in temperature in their studies on a number of North Sea crude oils.

In contrast with the phase separations observed in binary mixtures of alkanes with signifi-
cant  length  differences,  Dirand  et  al.50  and  Chevallier  et  al.51  found  that  commercial  paraffin
waxes  with  continuous  distributions  of  20  to  33  consecutive  n-alkanes  formed  single-phase
orthorhombic-solid  solutions  at  room  temperature.  The  wax  deposit  from  one  crude  oil  also
showed  the  same  single-phase  macrocrystalline  structure;  however,  an  amorphous  solid  was
also present. Increasing the temperature of the commercial waxes to their melting points of 55
to 65°C showed the existence of several different two-phase solid domains for these mixtures.

Significance of Experimental Solidification Behavior for Model Development.  As indicated
in the previous discussion, solidification behavior of petroleum-mixture components can range
from the relatively simple crystallization of pure n-alkanes into well-defined solid structures to
the  very  complex  precipitation  of  solids  from  live  reservoir  fluids  into  multiphase  microcrys-
talline  and  imperfect  macrocrystalline  domains.  Development  of  thermodynamic  models  for
predicting the equilibrium-phase behavior of solid waxes depends on which phenomena are to
be modeled and on the availability of experimental data for estimating parameters and testing
models.  The  determination  of  the  properties  and  phase  behavior  of  solid  waxes  is  an  area  of
active research.

The simplest models are written for a single-component single-phase solid. Models of this
type may be applied to pure-component-solidification cases or as an approximation in which a
multicomponent wax is treated as one lumped component. More common is the solid-solution
model  in  which  a  single-phase  multicomponent-solid  deposit  is  assumed.  Some  researchers

I-408

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

have  extended  the  experimental  evidence  of  immiscible  pure  solid  phases  for  binary  mixtures
to  the  multicomponent  case.  Lira-Galeana  et  al.52  proposed  a  multisolid  wax  model  in  which
the solid deposit is assumed to consist of a number of immiscible solid phases, each of which
is composed of a single pure component. Generally, the solid deposit is considered to be made
up of a number of multicomponent phases, as in the work of Coutinho.53

The experimental work discussed generally supports the assumption of multiple solid phas-
es, although Dirand et al.50 and Chevallier et al.51 have shown that commercial waxes with a
large  number  of  consecutive  n-alkanes  can  form  a  single  multicomponent  solid  solution  at
room temperature. As Sec. 9.8 discusses, the models currently available are able to operate in
predictive mode for some well-defined systems, but reservoir-fluid modeling still relies heavily
on the availability of experimental data.

9.3 Experimental Measurements of Asphaltene Precipitation

9.3.1 Measurements of APE.  As  previously  discussed,  the  APE  defines  the  region  in  which
asphaltene precipitation occurs. Accurate measurements of the APE and the amounts of precipi-
tate within the APE are required for design purposes and for tuning existing models. The upper
pressure on the APE is denoted by pAu and the lower pressure on the APE is denoted by pAℓ.
Several techniques are available for determining the onset of precipitation with various degrees
of accuracy.

Gravimetric Technique.  This technique5,54 is conducted in a conventional pressure/volume/
temperature (PVT) cell. For a pressure below the pAu, precipitation occurs and larger particles
segregate and settle at the bottom of the cell because of gravity. Asphaltene analysis (titration
with n-pentane or n-heptane) of the oil shows a decrease in asphaltene content compared with
the  original  oil.  Pressure  steps  must  be  chosen  carefully  to  capture  the  inflection  point  at  pAu
and pAℓ.

Acoustic-Resonance Technique.  The acoustic-resonance technique has been used effective-
ly to define pAu.4,55 The live oil is charged at a high pressure (e.g., 8,500 psia) into a resonator
cell maintained at the reservoir temperature. The resonator pressure then is decreased at a very
low rate (e.g., 50 psia/min) by changing the volume. The depressurization rate decreases with
time  to  a  typical  rate  of  5  psia/min  toward  the  end  of  the  experiment.  Acoustic  data  exhibit
sharp changes at pAu and at the oil saturation pressure, ps.

Light-Scattering Technique.  Light-scattering  techniques  also  have  been  successfully  used
to measure the APE.40,55–58 For dark-colored oil, a near-infrared laser light system (800×10-9 m
to 2200×10-9 m wavelength) is required to detect asphaltene-precipitation conditions. The prin-
ciple  behind  the  measurements  is  based  on  the  transmittance  of  a  laser  light  through  the  test
fluid  in  a  high-pressure,  high-temperature  visual  PVT  cell  undergoing  pressure,  temperature,
and  composition  changes.  A  receiver  captures  the  amount  of  light  that  passes  through  the  oil
sample. The power of transmitted light (PTL) is inversely proportional to the oil mass density,
to the particle size of the precipitate, and to the number of particles per unit volume of fluid.58
The PTL curve exhibits sharp jumps at pAu, ps, and pAℓ.

Filtration Technique.  In  this  method,  the  cell  contents  during  a  depressurization  test  are
mixed in a magnetic mixer, and small amounts of the well-mixed reservoir fluid are removed
through  a  hydrophobic  filter  at  various  pressures.54  The  material  retained  on  the  filter  is  ana-
lyzed for SARA contents.

Electrical-Conductance Technique.  This  technique  measures  the  change  in  the  fluid  con-
ductivity  with  changes  in  concentration  and  mobility  of  charged  components.56,59  Asphaltenes
have  large  dipole  moments,  and,  therefore,  the  conductivity  curve  exhibits  a  change  in  the
slope when precipitation occurs.

Chapter 9—Asphaltenes and Waxes

I-409

Viscometric Technique.  The key point of this method is the detection of a marked change
in the viscosity curve at the onset of precipitation12,60 because the viscosity of oil with suspend-
ed solids is higher than that of the oil itself.

Other Techniques.  Asphaltene precipitation has  been  detected through  visual  observations
with a microscope.6 Measurements of interfacial tension between oil and water61,62 also can be
used to detect the onset. A technique based on pressure-drop measurements across a capillary
tube was discussed by Broseta et al.63

Comparison of Different Methods.  Fig. 9.11 shows the results of Jamaluddin et al.’s54 com-
prehensive comparison of measurements with the gravimetric, acoustic-resonance, light-scatter-
ing, and filtration techniques on the same oil. These methods, except for the acoustic-resonance
technique, determine both the upper and lower APE pressure. The acoustic-resonance technique
normally provides only the upper onset pressure. In addition to APE pressures, the gravimetric
and filtration techniques also give the amount of precipitated asphaltene within the precipitation
region.  The  gravimetric  and  filtration  techniques  are  more  time  consuming  than  the  acoustic-
resonance  and  light-scattering  techniques.  Fotland  et  al.59  showed  that  the  electrical-conduc-
tance  technique  can  determine  both  precipitation  onset  and  amounts  of  precipitate  that  are
consistent with the gravimetric technique. The advantage of the viscometric technique is in its
applicability to heavy crude oil, which may give some difficulties to light-scattering techniques,
and in the low-cost equipment. In many cases, two measurement techniques are applied to the
same  oil  to  enhance  data  interpretation.  MacMillan  et  al.56  recommended  the  combination  of
light-scattering  and  electrical-conductance  techniques,  while  Jamaluddin  et  al.54  suggested  the
simultaneous application of light-scattering and filtration techniques.

9.3.2 Reversibility.  The reversibility of asphaltene precipitation is a subject of some controver-
sy.  Fotland64  and  Wang  et  al.65  suggested  that  asphaltene  precipitation  is  less  likely  to  be
reversible  for  crude  oils  subjected  to  conditions  beyond  those  of  the  precipitation  onset.
Hirschberg et al.6 speculated that asphaltene precipitation is reversible but that the dissolution
process is very slow. Hammami et al.58 reported experimental measurements that seem to sup-
port this conjecture. They observed that asphaltene is generally reversible but that the kinetics
of the redissolution vary significantly depending on the physical state of the system. Fig. 9.12
from Hammami et al.58 shows the laser-power signal (light-scattering technique) from a depres-
surizing and repressurizing experiment on a light oil that exhibits strong precipitation behavior.
The  laser-power  signal  increased  linearly  as  the  pressure  decreased  from  76  to  56  MPa.  This
increase results from the continuous decrease of oil density above the bubblepoint as the pres-
sure  is  reduced.  With  further  depletion  between  56  and  52  MPa,  a  large  drop  (one  order  of
magnitude) in the laser-power signal occurred. The onset of asphaltene precipitation was esti-
mated to be 55.7 MPa and the laser-power signal dropped to a very low level at 45 MPa. The
bubblepoint pressure for this oil is 33.5 MPa. On repressurization of this oil from 27 MPa (7
MPa below the bubblepoint), almost the entire laser-power signal was recovered, but the signal
followed a slightly different curve. Fig. 9.12 shows that the repressurization laser-power curve
lags the depressurization curve, which is an indication that the kinetics of redissolution is slow-
er  than  the  kinetics  of  precipitation.  Fig.  9.12  also  shows  that  the  ultimate  laser-power  value
reached from repressurization is higher than the predepletion value. Hammami et al.58 suggest-
ed  that  a  large  fraction  of  the  precipitated  asphaltene  (the  suspended  solid)  could  easily  go
back  into  solution  while  a  smaller  fraction  exhibits  partial  irreversibility  or  slow  dissolution
rate.  The  oil  at  the  end  of  the  repressurization  process  is  partially  deasphalted  and  is  slightly
lighter that the original oil.

Joshi et al.31 performed further experiments to study the reversibility process. Their results
corroborate the observations of Hammami et al.58 for depressurization and repressurization ex-
periments  at  field  conditions;  however,  they  observed  that  the  precipitation  caused  by  the

I-410

addition of alkane at atmospheric conditions is partially irreversible. They explained that asphal-
tene precipitation with pressure depletion at field conditions (field asphaltenes) results from the
destabilization  but  not  the  destruction  of  asphaltene  micelles.  On  the  other  hand,  asphaltene
precipitation  caused  by  the  addition  of  an  alkane  solvent  in  the  laboratory  under  atmospheric
conditions (laboratory asphaltenes) strips the asphaltene micelles of their resin components, and
the restoration of reformed micelles is a very difficult process.

Similar experimental results on partial irreversibility were obtained by Rassamdana et al.33
with an Iranian oil and different alkane solvents at atmospheric conditions. The laboratory as-
phaltenes  from  Joshi  et  al.31  and  Rassamdana  et  al.33  were  precipitated  from  light  oils.

Peramanu et al.66 performed precipitation experiments with Athabasca and Cold Lake bitumens
and n-heptane solvent and found the process completely reversible. It could be argued that in
heavy oils and bitumens, larger amounts of resins and asphaltenes facilitate the reversibility of
asphaltene  precipitation  with  alkane  solvents;  thus,  precipitation  behaviors  for  light  oils  and
heavy oils/bitumens are quite different and need to be examined separately.

Many  of  the  references  in  Secs.  9.3.1  and  9.3.2  contain  data  on  precipitation  caused  by
pressure depletion. Additional data can be found in Hirschberg et al.6 and Burke et al.5 Asphal-
tene precipitation also occurs during rich-gas and CO2-flooding processes. Sec. 9.3.3 discusses
the experimental results on these processes.

9.3.3 Asphaltene Precipitation During Rich-Gas and CO2 Flooding.  Hirschberg  et  al.6  pre-
sented  static  precipitation  data  of  a  recombined  crude  oil  with  the  separator  gas,  a  lean  gas,
and a rich gas. The results show that precipitation is more pronounced with rich gas and that
the  injection  of  separator  gas  could  induce  asphaltene  precipitation  at  reservoir  conditions.
Burke et al.5 reported comprehensive static precipitation data for six recombined reservoir oils
and different hydrocarbon gases. Their results indicate that precipitation depends on the compo-
sition  of  the  crude  oil,  the  added  solvent,  and  the  concentration  of  asphaltene  in  the  crude.
They also observed that for oil/solvent mixtures that exhibit a critical point on the p-x diagram,
maximum precipitation occurred at the critical point.

Monger and Fu67 and Monger and Trujillo7 provided extensive data on asphaltene precipita-
tion  in  CO2  flooding.  In  Monger  and  Trujillo,7  17  stock-tank  oils  with  gravity  ranging  from
19.5 to 46.5°API were used in a variable-volume circulating cell that could reproduce multiple-
contact  experiments.  The  temperature  was  set  to  114°F  (319  K)  and  run  pressures  were  set
above the minimum miscibility pressures. Fig. 9.13 shows the amounts of precipitation induced
by CO2 in the variable-volume circulating cell vs. the n-C5 asphaltene content of the stock-tank
oil. This figure shows that the CO2-induced precipitate is not the same as the n-pentane precip-
itate from the stock-tank oil. For Samples 1, 2, and 8, the extent of precipitation is substantial-
ly  less  than  the  asphaltene  content.  For  Samples  3  and  9,  the  extent  of  precipitation  exceeds
the asphaltene content. They concluded that the precipitation of asphaltene by CO2 was neither
complete nor exclusive. Some asphaltenes can remain suspended, and other heavy organic com-
pounds  can  precipitate.  It  also  was  observed  that  precipitation  usually  occurs  in  the  develop-
ment  of  miscibility.  Srivastava  et  al.10,11  studied  asphaltene  precipitation  for  Saskatchewan
Weyburn’s oil with CO2 and found that precipitation started to occur at 42 mol% CO2 concen-
tration in a static test. After that, there was a linear increase in asphaltene precipitate with CO2.

tank oil.7

It  has  been  reported  that  asphaltene  precipitation  from  static  tests  may  be  quite  different
from  dynamic  tests.  Parra-Ramirez  et  al.68  performed  static  and  multiple-contact  precipitation
experiments  with  a  crude  oil  from  the  Rangely  field  and  CO2.  They  observed  that  live  oils
yielded  significantly  higher  amounts  of  precipitates  than  the  corresponding  dead  oil  and  that
multiple-contact experiments gave rise to more precipitation than single-contact experiments.

This  discussion  shows  that  field  asphaltene  precipitates  resulting  from  a  rich-gas  or  CO2-
injection  process  are  different  from  laboratory  asphaltenes  induced  by  the  addition  of  alkane.
This field asphaltene is also different from the field asphaltene resulting from pressure deple-
tion, and its nature also varies with the composition of the injection fluid.

9.4 Thermodynamic Models for Asphaltene Precipitation

9.4.1 Thermodynamic Equilibrium.  Thermodynamic models for predicting asphaltene-precip-
itation  behavior  fall  into  two  general  categories:  activity  models  and  equation-of-state  (EOS)
models. With the precipitated asphaltene treated as a single-component or multicomponent sol-
id, the condition for thermodynamic equilibrium between the oil (liquid) and solid phase is the
equality of component chemical potentials in the oil and solid phases. That is,

μio = μis,

i = 1, ..., nc, ................................................... (9.6)

where μio and μis are the chemical potential of component i in the oil and solid phases, respec-
tively,  and  nc  is  the  number  of  components.  The  application  of  activity  coefficient  models  or
EOS models gives different expressions for the chemical potential. In addition, not all compo-
nents  in  the  oil  phase  undergo  precipitation;  therefore,  Eq.  9.6  applies  only  to  those  compo-
nents that precipitate.

9.4.2 Activity Models.  Activity Coefficients.  Because  asphaltenes  are  a  solubility  class  that
can be precipitated from petroleum by the addition of solvent, activity-coefficient models have
been  applied  to  model  the  phase-equilibrium  phenomena.  The  introduction  of  activity  coeffi-
cients in Eq. 9.6 yields

volume of component i in phase k (k = o, s), yik = mole fraction of component i in phase k (k
= o, s), and γik = activity coefficient of component i in phase k (k = o, s).

Several approaches that use the activity-coefficient model assume the oil and asphaltene as
two  pseudocomponents:  one  component  representing  the  deasphalted  oil  and  the  other  the  as-
phaltenes. Andersen and Speight69 provided a review of activity models in this category. Other
approaches  represent  the  precipitate  as  a  multicomponent  solid.  Chung,70  Yarranton  and
Masliyah,71 and Zhou et al.72 gave detailed descriptions of these models.

Flory-Huggins Model.  The  solubility  model  used  most  in  the  literature  is  the  Flory-Hug-
gins  solubility  model  introduced  by  Hirschberg  et  al.6  Vapor/liquid  equilibrium  calculations
with the Soave-Redlich-Kwong EOS73 are performed to split the petroleum mixture into a liq-
uid  phase  and  a  vapor  phase.  The  liquid  phase  then  is  divided  into  two  components:  a
component  that  corresponds  to  the  asphaltene  and  a  component  that  represents  the  remaining
oil (deasphalted oil). When solvent is added into the oil, the second component represents the
mixture of deasphalted oil and solvent. These two components are for modeling purposes and
do not correspond to any EOS components used in the vapor/liquid calculations. It also is as-
sumed that asphaltene precipitation does not affect vapor/liquid equilibrium.

Application  of  the  Flory-Huggins  solution  theory  gives  the  following  expression  for  the

chemical potential of the asphaltene component in the oil phase.

asphaltene in the mixture, and μa

ubility parameter, δm, is calculated from

δm = ΔUv / vm, ......................................................... (9.11)

I-414

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Fig. 9.14—Asphaltene solubility for a light crude oil.2

where ΔUv  is the molar internal energy of vaporization at the system temperature, which also
can be calculated from the Soave-Redlich-Kwong EOS. The remaining parameters are the mo-
lar volume of asphaltene, va, and the solubility parameter of asphaltene, δa, which are essential
to the performance of this model. The molar volume of asphaltene can only be speculated on.
Hirschberg et al.6 used values of va in the range of 1 to 4 m3/kmol. The solubility parameter of
asphaltene  can  be  estimated  by  measuring  the  solubility  of  asphaltene  in  different  solvents  of
increasing solubility parameters. The asphaltene is assumed to have the solubility parameter of
the best solvent. Hirschberg et al.6 suggests that the solubility parameter of asphaltene is close
to  that  of  naphthalene.  Eq.  9.10  gives  the  amount  (volume  fraction)  of  asphaltene  soluble  in
the oil mixture. The amount of precipitation is determined by the difference between the total
amount  of  asphaltenes  present  in  the  initial  oil  and  the  solubility  of  asphaltene  under  given
conditions.

The solubility parameter can be correlated as a linear equation with respect to temperature

as

δa = a + bT, ............................................................ (9.12)

where a and b are constants. Parameter b is negative as the solubility parameter decreases with
increasing  temperature.  Buckley  et  al.74  and  Wang  and  Buckley75  showed  that  the  measure-
ments of the refractive index of crude oils can be used to determine the solubility parameters
required for the Flory-Huggins model.

The Hirschberg et al.6 approach also has been used with some degree of success by Burke
et al.,5 Kokal and Sayegh,4 Novosad and Costain,8 Nor-Azian and Adewumi,76 and Rassamdana
et  al.33;  de  Boer  et  al.  used  this  model  to  screen  crude  oils  for  their  tendency  to  precipitate
asphaltene. They  compared  properties of  some  crudes  in  which  asphaltene problems  were  en-
countered  and  properties  of  crudes  that  operated  trouble  free.  They  found  that  asphaltene
problems  were  encountered  with  light  crudes  with  high  C1  to  C3  contents,  high  bubblepoint
pressures, large differences between reservoir pressure and bubblepoint pressure, and high com-
pressibility.  With  an  asphaltene  molar  volume  of  1  m3/kmol,  de  Boer  et  al.2  showed  that  the
solubility of asphaltene in a light crude oil with Eq. 9.10 follows the curve shown in Fig. 9.14.
Above the bubblepoint, the decrease in asphaltene solubility is caused by pressure effects. Be-
low the bubblepoint, the increase in asphaltene solubility is caused by the variation in the oil
composition. Clearly, a minimum asphaltene solubility occurs around the bubblepoint.

Fig. 9.15—Maximum supersaturation of asphaltene at saturation pressure.2

de Boer et al.2 calculated the solubility of asphaltene with Eq. 9.10 for different values of
in-situ  crude  oil  densities  and  asphaltene-solubility  parameters.  They  also  introduced  a  maxi-
mum supersaturation at bubblepoint defined as

where  pr  and  pb  are,  respectively,  the  reservoir  pressure  and  the  bubblepoint  pressure  at  the
reservoir  temperature.  Fig.  9.15  shows  the  maximum  supersaturation  at  the  bubblepoint  as  a
function  of  the  difference  between  reservoir  and  bubblepoint  pressure,  the  in-situ  oil  density,
and the asphaltene-solubility parameter. The influence of the asphaltene-solubility parameter is
very small. Supersaturations are larger for lighter crudes. The boundary between problem and
nonproblem  areas  lies  at  a  maximum  supersaturation  of  approximately  1.  Although  these  re-
sults were derived with North Sea and Kuwait crudes, Hammami et al.58 showed that they also
are applicable to crudes from the Gulf of Mexico.

Extension of Flory-Huggins Model.  The Flory-Huggins model initially was developed for
polymer solutions. The Hirschberg et al.6 approach is based on the representation of asphaltene
as  a  homogeneous  polymer.  Novosad  and  Constain8  used  an  extension  of  the  model  that  in-
cludes asphaltene polymerization and asphaltene-resin association in the solid phase. Kawanaka
et al.77 proposed an improvement whereby the precipitated asphaltene is treated as a heteroge-
neous  polymer  (i.e.,  a  mixture  of  polymers  of  different  molecular  weights).  The  Scott-Magat
theory was used to obtain a solubility model for a given molecular-weight distribution for as-
phaltene. Cimino et al.57 also used the Flory-Huggins model with two components (solvent and
asphaltene) but considered the solid phase to be a mixture of solvent and asphaltene instead of
pure  asphaltene  as  in  Hirschberg  et  al.’s  approach.  Yang  et  al.78  proposed  a  multicomponent
Flory-Huggins model in which components are the same as the EOS components used in the oil/
gas flash calculations.

Multicomponent Activity Coefficient Models.  These  models  are  derived  from  methods  for
modeling  wax  precipitation.39,79,80  Multicomponent  solid/liquid  K  values  are  derived  from  Eq.

where  Tif  =  fusion  temperature  of  component  i,  ΔCpi  =  Cpo,i  –  Cps,i,  heat  capacity  change  of
fusion, and ΔHif = heat of fusion of component i. ΔCpi is assumed to be independent of temper-
ature in Eq. 9.17.

Starting with Eq. 9.17, methods were derived through the use of different models for activi-
ty  coefficients.  The  earliest  approach  is  from  Won79  in  the  modeling  of  wax  precipitation.
Won79 suggested that the term involving ΔCpi and the integral involving Δvi are negligible and
used regular solution theory to calculate the activity coefficients in Eq. 9.17 as follows.

where  δik  is  the  solubility  parameter  of  component  i  in  phase  k  (k  =  o,  s),  vik  is  the  molar
volume of component i in phase k, and Φik is the volume fraction of component i in phase k.
Won gave solubility parameter values, δio and δis, for normal paraffins up to C40. Correlations
also are provided to calculate ΔHif, vio, and vis. Although Won’s model was developed for wax
precipitation, Thomas et al.9 have applied it with some success in predicting asphaltene precipi-
tation. However, they have developed their own correlations for solubility parameters. MacMil-
lan et al.56 also used Won’s model but kept all the terms in Eq. 9.17 instead of neglecting the

Chapter 9—Asphaltenes and Waxes

I-417

terms involving ΔCpi and Δvi as Won did. They also included additional multiplication factors
to the different terms in Eq. 9.17 to facilitate phase-behavior matching.

Hansen  et  al.38  and  Yarranton  and  Masliyah71  used  the  Flory-Huggins  model  to  calculate
the  activity  coefficients  in  Eq.  9.17.  Hansen  et  al.38  applied  their  method  to  the  modeling  of
wax  precipitation,  while  Yarranton  and  Masliyah71  modeled  precipitation  of  Athabasca  as-
phaltenes.  Yarranton  and  Masliyah71  proposed  an  approach  for  calculating  the  molar  volumes
and solubility parameters from experimental measurements of molar mass and density. Asphal-
tene density, molar volume, and solubility parameter are correlated with molar mass. Zhou et al.
72 used the Flory-Huggins polymer-solution theory with a modification to account for the col-
loidal suspension effect of asphaltenes and resins.

9.4.3 EOS Models.  These approaches model the oil, gas, and precipitate by an EOS, which is
used to calculate the component fugacities in different phases. Cubic EOSs have been used to
model  petroleum-reservoir  fluids  that  exhibit  vapor/liquid  1/liquid  2  behavior  (see  Fussell,81
Nghiem and Li,82 or Godbole et al.83). Godbole et al.83 observed that the apparent second liq-
uid phase could be approximated as a mixture of aggregated asphaltenes (solid phase) entrained
in a portion of the other liquid phase in the modeling of mixtures of crude oil from the North
Slope  of  Alaska  and  enriched  gas.  Under  certain  conditions,  a  phase-behavior  program  that
includes a three-phase calculation with an EOS could be used to model some aspects of asphal-
tene precipitation; however, the prevailing approach consists of  the use  of  a  cubic EOS  (e.g.,
Soave-Redlich-Kwong EOS73 or Peng-Robinson EOS84) for the oil and gas phases and a solid
model for the precipitate.

The  simplest  model  for  precipitated  asphaltene  is  the  single-component  solid  model.  The
precipitated asphaltene is represented as a pure solid, while the oil and gas phases are modeled
with a cubic EOS. The fugacity of the pure solid is given by
vs(p − p*)

, ............................................. (9.21)

ln fs = ln fs

* +

RT

* = reference solid fugacity, p = pressure, p* = reference pressure,
where fs = solid fugacity,  fs
R = gas constant, vs = solid molar volume, and T = temperature. The following fugacity-equali-
ty equations are solved to obtain oil/gas/solid equilibrium.

fio = fig,

i = 1, ..., nc................................................... (9.22a)

and fao = fs. ............................................................. (9.22b)

The oil and gas fugacities, fio and fig, for component i are calculated from an EOS. In Eq.
9.22b, subscript a denotes the asphaltene component in solution. Normally, this asphaltene com-
ponent  is  the  heaviest  and  last  component  of  the  oil  (i.e.,  a  =  nc).  The  following  simple
stability test can be used to determine whether there is asphaltene precipitation: if fao ≥ fs, as-
phaltene precipitation occurs, and if fao < fs, there is no precipitation.

Earlier  applications  of  the  single-component  solid  model  for  asphaltene  precipitation  were
not successful.9 Nghiem et al.85 introduced a method for representing the asphaltene component
in the oil that improves the capabilities of the single-component solid model to predict asphal-
tene precipitation. The method was subsequently refined by Nghiem et al.86–90 The key to the
approach  is  the  split  of  the  heaviest  fraction  of  the  oil  into  two  pseudocomponents:  one  that
does  not  precipitate  (nonprecipitating  component)  and  one  that  can  precipitate  (precipitating
component).  These  two  pseudocomponents  have  identical  critical  temperatures,  critical  pres-

I-418

sures,  acentric  factors,  and  molecular  weights.  The  differences  are  in  the  interaction  coeffi-
cients.  The  interaction  coefficients  between  the  precipitating  components  and  the  light
components are larger than those between the nonprecipitating component and the light compo-
nents. The parameters of the model are the reference fugacity and the solid molar volume. The
reference  fugacity  could  be  estimated  from  a  data  point  on  the  APE,  and  a  value  for  solid
molar volume slightly larger than the EOS value for the pure component a is adequate.85

The following application of the model to a North Sea fluid from Nghiem et al.87 illustrates
the procedure. Table 9.2 shows the pseudocomponent representation of the reservoir fluid with
the  separator  gas  and  separator  oil  compositions.  The  reservoir  oil  corresponds  to  a  combina-
tion of 65.3 mol% separator oil and 34.7 mol% separator gas. The crucial step in the modeling
of asphaltene is the split of the heaviest component in the oil (e.g., C32+) into a nonprecipitat-
ing  component  (C32A+)  and  a  precipitating  component  (C32B+).  These  two  components  have
identical  critical  properties  and  acentric  factors  but  different  interaction  coefficients  with  the
light components. The precipitating component has larger interaction coefficients with the light
components.  With  larger  interaction  coefficients,  the  precipitating  component  becomes  more
“incompatible” with the light components and tends to precipitate as the amount of light com-
ponent in solution increases. Although C32B+ is called the precipitating component, the amount
that precipitates is governed by Eq. 9.21. Normally, only a portion of the total amount of C32B+
will precipitate during a calculation. Hirschberg et al.6 reports that the asphalt precipitate from
a tank oil consists mainly (90%) of C30 to C60 compounds. For the purpose of modeling asphal-
tene precipitation, a heaviest component in the vicinity of C30+ is adequate. For this example,
C32+ is used.

The Peng-Robinson EOS was used to model the oil and gas phases. The critical properties
and acentric factors of the pseudocomponents in Table 9.2 are calculated as described in Li et
al.91 The interaction coefficients are calculated from

di j = 1 −( 2 · vci

1 / 6 · vc j
1 / 6
1 / 3
1 / 3 + vc j
vci

)e

, .............................................. (9.23)

where dij = the interaction coefficient between component i and j, vci = the critical volume of
component  i,  and  e  =  an  adjustable  parameter.  A  value  of  e(C32A+)  =  0.84  and  a  value  of
e(C32B+) = 1.57 were found to provide a good match of the saturation and onset pressure. The
reference  solid  fugacity  was  obtained  by  calculating  the  fugacity  of  oil  at  one  point  on  the

Chapter 9—Asphaltenes and Waxes

APE (recombined oil with 69.9 mol% separator gas and 30 000 kPa) with the Peng-Robinson
EOS and equating it to fs
*. The molar volume of the asphaltene precipitate was assumed equal
to 0.9 m3/kmol.

Fig. 9.16 shows a good match of the experimental and calculated APE and saturation pres-
sure curves at the reservoir temperature of 90°C. The model was able to predict precipitation
conditions that are far from the reference conditions used to determine fs
*. Fig. 9.16 shows the
amounts of precipitation calculated as constant weight percent of precipitate (similar to “quality
lines” in oil/gas phase diagrams). As pressure decreases below the APE, the amount of precipi-
tation  increases  and  reaches  a  maximum  at  the  saturation  pressure.  Below  the  saturation
pressure, the amount of precipitation decreases with decreasing pressure. The results are consis-
tent with the laboratory observations described in Sec. 9.3.

For nonisothermal conditions, Eq. 9.24 can be used to calculate the solid fugacity at (p, T)

from the solid fugacity at a reference condition (p*, T*).88,92

Kohse  et  al.92  used  Eq.  9.24  to  model  the  precipitation  behavior  of  a  crude  oil  with
changes in pressure and temperature. Fig. 9.17 shows good agreements between the experimen-
tal and calculated APE and saturation-pressure curves. The measured data point of 1.6 wt% of
precipitate also is close to the predictions.

The previous two examples illustrate the application of the single-component solid model to
the  modeling  of  precipitation  behavior  of  crudes  with  changes  in  pressure,  temperature,  and
composition. From a mechanistic point of view, the nonprecipitating component can be related

I-420

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Fig. 9.17—PT asphaltene and saturation curves for a South American fluid.92

to resins, asphaltene/resin micelles that do not dissociate, and heavy paraffins. The precipitating
component corresponds to both the asphaltenes that dissociate and the asphaltene/resin micelles
that precipitate unaltered. Because of identical critical properties and acentric factors, the non-
precipitating  and  precipitating  components  behave  as  a  single  component  in  solution.  The
larger  interaction  coefficients  between  the  precipitating  and  the  solvent  components  cause  the
precipitation  of  the  former  with  the  addition  of  solvent.  The  amount  of  precipitation  depends
on the solution of Eqs. 9.22a and 9.22b. Normally, only a portion of the precipitating compo-
nent actually precipitates.

Solid  precipitation with  the  previous  model is  reversible. Nghiem  et al.90  proposed an  en-
hancement  to  the  approach  to  obtain  partial  irreversibility.  A  second  solid  (Solid  2)  is  intro-
duced that is obtained from the reversible solid (Solid 1) through a chemical reaction:

Solid 1

k12
→
k21
←

Solid 2

If  the  forward  reaction  rate  k12  is  much  larger  than  the  backward  reaction  rate  k21,  Solid  2
behaves as a partially irreversible solid.

9.4.4 Thermodynamic-Colloidal Model.  Leontaritis and Mansoori28 proposed a more mecha-
nistic  approach  based  on  the  assumption  that  asphaltenes  exist  in  the  oil  as  solid  particles  in
colloidal  suspension  stabilized  by  resins  adsorbed  on  their  surface.  This  thermodynamic-col-
loidal  model  assumes  thermodynamic  equilibrium  between  the  resins  in  the  oil  phase  and  the
resins adsorbed on the surface of colloidal asphaltene (asphaltene micelle). The corresponding
equilibrium equation is

I-421

Assuming that resins behave as monodisperse polymers and applying the Flory-Huggins polymer-
solution theory gives the volume fraction of dissolved resins as

ln Φr =

−

RT (δm − δr)2 − 1, ......................................... (9.26)

which is analogous to Eq. 9.10 for the asphaltene component in Hirschberg et al.’s approach.
In Hirschberg et al.’s approach, the asphaltene component contains both resins and asphaltene,
whereas  Eq.  9.26  applies  to  the  resins  only.  As  in  Hirschberg  et  al.’s  approach,  EOS  flash
calculations with a multicomponent system are performed to obtain an oil/gas split and oil prop-
erties from which Φr is calculated. This value of Φr is compared with a critical resin concentra-
tion,  Φcr,  which  is  given  as  a  function  of  pressure,  temperature,  molar  volume,  and  solubility
parameters.  Φcr  is  the  key  parameter  of  the  model.  If  Φr  >  Φcr,  the  system  is  stable  and  no
precipitation  occurs.  If  Φr  ≤  Φcr,  asphaltene  precipitation  occurs.  The  amount  of  precipitated
asphaltene can be made a function of the asphaltene particle sizes.

9.4.5 Thermodynamic-Micellization Model.  Pan and Firoozabadi93,94 proposed the most mech-
anistic  approach  to  model  asphaltene  precipitation  by  calculating  the  Gibbs  free  energy  of
formation of the asphaltene micelle and including it in the phase-equilibrium calculations. De-
tails of the approach can be found in Firoozabadi.95 Fig. 9.18 portrays schematically the system
to  be  modeled.  The  species  in  the  liquid  phase  (L1)  are  monomeric  asphaltenes,  monomeric
resins,  micelles,  and  asphalt-free  oil  species.  The  micelle  consists  of  a  core  of  n1  asphaltene
molecules surrounded by a shell containing n2 resins molecules. The precipitate phase is consid-
ered as a liquid mixture (L2) of asphaltene and resin molecules. An expression for Gibbs free
0 , which includes n1, n2, and the shell thickness, D, was
energy of formation of the micelle, ΔGm
proposed. The Gibbs free energy of the liquid phase, L1, then is derived with an EOS for the
asphalt-free  oil  species,  activity  models  for  the  monomeric  asphaltenes  and  resins,  and  the
0 .  Similarly,  the  Gibbs  free  energy  of  the
Gibbs  free  energy  of  formation  of  the  micelle,  ΔGm
precipitated phase, L2, which is a binary mixture of monomeric asphaltenes and resins, also is
derived with the use of an EOS. The total Gibbs free energy of the system,

then is minimized with respect to n1 = number of asphaltene molecules in the micellar core, n2

The model was applied to predict precipitation from a tank oil with propane,6 Weyburn oil
with CO2,10 and a North Sea oil with separator gas. Fig. 9.19 shows the predictions of Wey-
burn oil with CO2 obtained with the thermodynamic-micellization model. For comparison, the

9.5 Asphaltene Deposition and Plugging

9.5.1 Outline.    The  measurements  and  modeling  of  the  phase  behavior  aspect  of  asphaltene
precipitation were described in the previous sections. After precipitation, asphaltene can remain
as  a  suspended  solid  in  the  oil  or  deposit  onto  the  rock.  Here,  the  term  precipitation  corre-
sponds  to  the  formation  of  a  solid  phase  from  thermodynamic  equilibrium  and  deposition
means the settling of solid particles onto the rock surface. Deposition will induce alteration of
wettability  (from  water-wet  to  oil-wet)  of  the  rock  and  plugging  of  the  formation.  These  as-
pects have been known for a long time and are the subject of many recent investigations. This
section reviews the investigations and laboratory observations of these aspects.

9.5.2 Experiments.  Measurements of the deposition and plugging effects were performed by
Piro et al.96 in sand packs and by Turta et al.,12 Minssieux,97 and Ali and Islam98 in cores to
study  asphaltene  deposition  and  the  subsequent  effect  of  permeability  reduction.  Yeh  et  al.,99
Kamath  et  al.,100  and  Yan  et  al.101  performed  core  displacements  to  investigate  the  effect  of

wettability alteration caused by deposition and its subsequent effect on the recovery. The fol-
lowing  sections  discuss  the  results  from  these  experiments  with  techniques  for  modeling  the
observed phenomena.

9.5.3 Deposition  and  Plugging.    Asphaltene  deposition  in  porous  media  exhibits  similarities
with the deposition of fines. The main phenomena are adsorption, surface deposition, and plug-
ging deposition.

Piro et al.96 used asphaltene precipitates collected from a field in northern Italy or induced
by diluting two crude oils with n-heptane. The diluted mixture of crude oil with a given con-
centration  of  precipitate  was  injected  into  sand  packs,  and  the  concentration  of  asphaltene
precipitate at the outlet was measured. The deposited amounts were calculated by difference.

Minssieux97 performed comprehensive core experiments for three crude oils from different
parts  of  the  world  (France,  North  Africa,  and  North  America)  and  four  types  of  cores  (three
sandstone  cores  with  different  permeabilities  and  clay  contents  and  a  core  from  the  Algerian
Hassi Messaoud field, which suffers strong asphaltene-precipitation problems). Asphaltene pre-
cipitates  were  obtained  by  diluting  crude  oils  with  n-heptane.  Pressure  drops  across  the  core
were  measured  to  determine  the  permeability  reduction  caused  by  asphaltene  deposition.  The
amounts of deposited asphaltene along the core were estimated with a pyrolysis technique.

Ali and Islam98 performed core tests with crude oils from the United Arab Emirates. Crude
oil  with  3  wt%  of  asphaltene  precipitate  (induced  by  n-heptane)  was  injected  into  carbonate
cores  at  four  different  rates.  The  pressure  drops  across  the  core  were  measured  to  determine
the permeability reduction.

Turta  et  al.12  performed  high-pressure  core-displacement  experiments  with  propane.  Crude
oils  from  west-central  and  northwestern  Alberta  were  used.  Asphaltene  precipitation  occurred
within  the  core  when  propane  mixed  with  the  oil  in  the  displacement  process.  Permeability
reduction was inferred by measuring pressure drops across the core.

Adsorption.  The  first  step  in  the  deposition  is  the  adsorption  of  asphaltene  onto  the  rock
surface.  The  adsorption  of  asphaltene  onto  different  rocks  has  been  measured  extensively  in
static experiments that showed that the asphaltene adsorption onto different rocks can be mod-
eled  with  Langmuir  isotherms.102–104  Fig.  9.20  from  Dubey  and  Waxman103  shows  typical
Langmuir isotherms for asphaltene adsorption on different rocks. The Langmuir isotherm equa-
tion is

wsa =

(wsa)max Ka Csf
Ka Csf + 1

, .................................................... (9.28)

where Csf = concentration of suspended solid in the oil phase, wsa = mass of adsorbed asphal-
tene per mass of rock, (wsa)max  = maximum adsorbed mass fraction (the plateau in Fig. 9.20),
and Ka = ratio of rate constants of the adsorption/desorption reactions. Adsorption is higher for
rock  containing  a  higher  content  of  shales.  Because  adsorption  is  a  surface  phenomenon,  its
main effect is the alteration of the rock wettability from water-wet to oil-wet.

General Deposition Process.  In addition to adsorption, Minssieux97 showed that deposition
occurs  because  of  mechanical  entrapment  similar  to  the  deposition  of  fines  in  porous  media.
Pressure drops across the core were measured for several experiments to assess the deposition
and  plugging  effects  caused  by  asphaltene.  Minssieux  reported  that  the  most  noticeable  plug-
ging  occurred  in  sandstones  containing  clays  and  in  tight  sandstones.  Fig.  9.21  shows  the
reduction  of  oil  permeability  as  a  function  of  pore  volume  injected  for  sandstones  with  and
without  clay.  Fig.  9.22  shows  the  permeability  reduction  for  tight  sandstone.  Minssieux  also
used the pore-blocking model of Wojtanowicz et al.105 to analyze the experimental results.

Ali  and  Islam98  combined  a  model  for  adsorption  with  the  model  of  Gruesbeck  and
Collins106 for the entrainment and deposition of fines in porous media to analyze their experi-
mental results. Gruesbeck and Collins assumed that the porous medium could be divided into
two parallel pathways: small pore sizes, in which plug-type deposits occur and can eventually
be  plugged  completely,  and  larger  pore  sizes,  in  which  surface  nonplugging  deposits  occur.
Particles  could  be  mobilized  from  the  surface  deposits  if  the  fluid  velocity  exceeds  a  critical
value. Fig. 9.23 illustrates this concept.

of deposited asphaltene in pluggable pathway, and α, β, χ, and γ = model parameters.

Gruesbeck  and  Collins  gave  empirical  correlations  for  calculating  up  and  unp  from  u,  as
well as the permeabilities of pluggable and nonpluggable pathways as functions of the volumes
of  deposited  asphaltene.  Eq.  9.29  implies  that  the  deposited  asphaltene  in  nonpluggable  path-
ways is mobilized if the velocity, unp, is greater than the critical velocity, uc. Ali and Islam98
developed a 1D, single-phase flow simulator with the Gruesbeck and Collins deposition model.
They  identified  three  regimes  for  asphaltene  deposition  and  plugging  depending  on  the  flow
rate: monotonous steady state, quasisteady state, and continuous plugging. Fig. 9.24 shows the
experimental  results  and  the  match  obtained  with  the  model  described  in  Eqs.  9.29  and  9.30.
At low flow rates (monotonous steady-state regime), the permeability reduction took place in a
monotonous  fashion.  At  intermediate  flow  rates  (quasisteady-state  regime),  initial  reduction  in
permeability  was  observed  until  a  minimum  was  reached.  After  reaching  this  minimal  value,
the trend was reversed with an increase in permeability. Ali and Islam attributed this increase
to  the  mobilization  of  asphaltene  deposited  in  nonpluggable  pathways.  At  higher  flow  rates

I-426

(continuous-plugging regime), the permeability reduction began late in the injection process but
was very rapid once begun.

Wang and Civan107,108 modified the Gruesbeck and Collins model to obtain

∂Ea
∂t

= β Ca Φ − α Ea(vo − vc) + γ (1 + η) uo, ............................... (9.31)

where  Ea  =  volume  of  deposited  asphaltene  per  bulk  volume  of  rock,  vc  =  critical  interstitial
velocity for surface deposition, vo = interstitial oil velocity ( = uo/Φ), and α, β, γ, η are model
parameters. The separation of pathways into pluggable and nonpluggable has been eliminated.
The last term in Eq. 9.31 represents the plugging deposit and is set to zero if the average pore
throat diameter is greater than a critical pore throat diameter (i.e., there is no plugging deposit
if the pore throat is large).

The porosity occupied by the fluid is

where Φ0 is the initial porosity. The reduction in permeability is calculated from

factor.107  Wang  and  Civan107  developed  a  1D,  three-phase,  four-pseudocomponent  simulator
that  incorporates  the  previous  deposition  and  plugging  model.  They  showed  that  their  model
could match some of the core deposition experiments by Minssieux97 and Ali and Islam.98

Kocabas  and  Islam109  extended  the  model  of  Ali  and  Islam  to  the  analysis  of  deposition
and  plugging  in  the  near-wellbore  region.  Leontaritis110  also  developed  a  single-phase  radial

model to analyze the near-well pressure behavior when asphaltene deposition and plugging oc-
cur. Ring et al.111 described a three-component, thermal reservoir simulator for the deposition
of waxes in which only surface deposition is considered. Nghiem et al.87,88 have incorporated
in  a  3D  compositional  simulator  both  a  thermodynamic  single-component  solid  model  for  as-
phaltene  precipitation  and  a  deposition  model  based  on  adsorption  and  plugging  deposit.  A
resistance factor approach was used to model permeability reduction caused by asphaltene depo-
sition. Qin et al.112 proposed a method for compositional simulation based on similar approaches.

9.5.4 Wettability Alteration.  The alteration of formation wettability caused by asphaltene de-
position has been the subject of numerous investigations. Asphaltene adsorption onto the rock
surface  is  the  main  factor  for  wettability  alteration  from  water-wet  to  oil-wet.  Collins  and
Melrose,102 Kamath et al.,100 Clementz,113 Crocker and Marchin,114 and Buckley et al.115,116 de-
scribed the change of formation wettability from water-wet to mixed-wet or oil-wet on adsorp-
tion of asphaltene onto the rock surface. Clementz113 discussed the permanent alteration of core
properties  after  asphaltene  adsorption.  Collins  and  Melrose102  showed  that  asphaltene  adsorp-
tion is reduced but not eliminated by the presence of water films on water-wet rock. Crocker
and Marchin114 and Buckley et al.115,116 studied asphaltene adsorption for different oil composi-
tions and the corresponding degree of wettability alteration. Yan et al.101 performed injection of

I-428

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

asphaltenes (obtained for diluting crude oils from Wyoming and Prudhoe Bay with n-hexane)
into Berea core. After the displacements, imbibition tests were performed to determine changes
in  core  wettability.  They  showed  that  the  amount  of  adsorbed  asphaltene  is  dependent  on  the
ions present in the brines (in this case Na+, Ca2+, and Al3+) and that adsorption increases with
an increase in ion valency. The highest adsorption occurred with Al3+ in the brine. Significant
changes in wettability of the sandstone core were observed after asphaltene adsorption.

Morrow117 reviewed the effect of wettability on oil recovery. Wettability has been shown to
affect relative permeabilities, irreducible water saturation, residual oil saturation, capillary pres-
sures,  dispersion,  and  electrical  properties.  The  alteration  of  relative  permeabilities  and  end-
points  has  the  strongest  influence  on  displacement  processes.  Morrow117  reviewed  results  for
core waterfloods showing that the shift toward a less water-wet condition can range from being
highly adverse to highly beneficial to oil recovery. Huang and Holm,118 Lin and Huang,119 and
Yeh et al.99 presented results on the implication of wettability changes on water-alternating-gas
(WAG)  processes.  Typical  results  for  CO2  WAG  processes118  indicate  that  the  amount  of  oil
trapped in water-wet cores (45%) was much higher than that trapped in either mixed-wet (15
to 20%) or oil-wet cores (5%).

Yeh  et  al.99  performed  experiments  in  a  capillary-tube  visual  cell  showing  the  change  in
wettability  on  asphaltene  precipitation  by  mixing  a  west  Texas  oil  with  CO2  and  a  Canadian
Mitsue  crude  oil  with  hydrocarbon  gas  at  reservoir  conditions.  They  also  carried  out  WAG
coreflood  experiments  under  reservoir  conditions  in  which  asphaltene  precipitation  occurred.
The  residual  oil  saturation  after  each  flood  was  measured  and  compared  with  the  value  ob-
tained  in  displacements  with  refined  oils  in  which  there  were  essentially  no  changes  in
wettability.  For  some  experiments,  they  observed  substantial  reduction  in  residual  oil  satura-
tions when wettability was altered. A wettability change from water-wet to oil-wet conditions
increases the contact between oil and solvent and is responsible for a decrease in residual oil
saturation.

Kamath et al.100 performed injection of a precipitating solvent (n-pentane or n-heptane) in
cores saturated with crude oil. The plugging caused by asphaltene was assessed by measuring
pressure drops across the cores. After the injection of solvent, water was injected and recovery
and  relative  permeabilities  were  measured  to  study  the  effect  of  deposition  on  displacement
efficiency. Three cores were used. Core 1 is a Berea sandstone core with permeability of 236
md and porosity of 27.9%. Cores 2 and 3 are unconsolidated sandpack cores with permeability
of 2380 and 1520 md and porosity of 32.7 and 31.3%, respectively. Fig. 9.25 shows the reduc-
tion in permeability with respect to the degree of asphaltene deposition. As expected, permeabil-
ity  reduction  was  highest  for  the  least  permeable  core  (Core  1)  and  smallest  for  the  most
permeable  core  (Core  2).  Fig.  9.26  shows  cumulative  fractional  recovery  for  Core  1  vs.  pore
volume  of  water  injected  for  various  degrees  of  asphaltene  deposition.  The  results  show  an
improved  displacement  efficiency  with  an  increase  in  the  deposited  amounts.  Similar  results
were  obtained  for  Cores  2  and  3.  Kamath  et  al.100  concluded  from  their  experiments  that  al-
though deposition causes permeability reduction, it may improve the sweep efficiency through
the  alteration  of  relative  permeability  curves  and  flow-diverting  effects.  Shedid120  performed
similar  displacement  experiments  on  low-permeability  carbonate  cores  instead  of  sandstone
cores and observed substantial permeability damage with deposition.

The wettability alteration caused by asphaltene deposition is a complex process that is still
a  subject  of  many  investigations.  The  degree  of  wettability  change  may  not  be  uniform,  as
discussed in Al-Maamari and Buckley.121 The subsequent effect of wettability on relative per-
meabilities and oil recovery is also a complex subject. There are still unexplored areas, and the
whole process is not completely understood at this time. Although the change from water-wet
to oil-wet conditions caused by asphaltene precipitation may favor sweep efficiency of water-
flood  or  WAG  processes  inside  the  reservoir,  the  plugging  effect  near  the  wellbore  remains

Chapter 9—Asphaltenes and Waxes

I-429

detrimental to oil production. Inside the reservoir, fluids can find their way around regions of
deposition, but, around the wellbore, plugging will prevent flow of oil from converging to the
wellbore. Remedial actions then are required to increase production.

9.6 Remedial Treatment for Asphaltene Precipitation
Asphaltene precipitation and its subsequent deposition in the wellbore and near-well region are
detrimental to oil production. The most effective preventive method is to operate at conditions
outside the APE. This is not always possible because of the large drawdown in the vicinity of
the wellbore, which lowers the reservoir pressure below the onset pressure. For precipitation in
the  wellbore,  mechanical  methods,  such  as  rod  and  wireline  scrapers,  can  be  used  to  remove
asphaltene deposits. Although these methods provide good cleaning and minimal formation dam-
age,  their  application  is  limited  to  the  wellbore  and  does  not  resolve  the  problem  associated
with near-wellbore formation plugging.

Because  the  solubility  of  asphaltene  increases  with  an  increase  in  aromatic  contents,  sol-
vents  such  as  xylene  and  toluene  commonly  are  used  to  dissolve  asphaltene  deposits  in  both
the  wellbore  and  formation.  Stricter  regulations  governing  disposals,  volatile-emission  limits,
and flammability concerns have made the use of xylene and toluene less attractive, and alter-
nate  solvents  have  been  investigated.122  Cosolvents  for  asphaltene  removal  also  have  been
studied.123 Cosolvents are xylene-enriched materials with water-wetting properties that use mod-
erate-length  carbon-chain  alcohols.  Production  restoration  is  comparable  to  that  obtained  with
xylene,  but  the  treatment  lasts  longer  (average  of  6  to  8  months).  Polymeric  dispersants  also
have been used as alternatives to aromatic solvents.124 These dispersants inhibit the deposition
of asphaltene by breaking the precipitate into smaller particle sizes, which can remain in sus-
pension  in  the  oil  phase.  Solubility-parameter  models  have  been  used  to  evaluate  and  screen
solvents and inhibitors.122,124 Jamaluddin et al.125 performed experiments that showed that deas-

deposition.100

phaltened  oil  is  a  strong  solvent  for  asphaltene  because  of  its  native  resin  and  aromatic
contents; however, the cost of producing large amounts of deasphaltened oil to be used as sol-
vent is not viable economically.

9.7 Experimental Analysis of Wax Characteristics of Petroleum Fluids
There  are  a  number  of  experimental  measurements  performed  on  petroleum  fluids  to  define
their tendency to precipitate wax. Measurements of the temperature at which wax precipitation
occurs and the amount of wax precipitated are done with stabilized (stock tank) oils and live
reservoir fluids. Compositional analysis of the fluids is performed to determine the concentra-
tions  of  chemical  species  that  can  precipitate  as  waxes.  This  section  describes  these  types  of
analyses.

9.7.1 Compositional Analysis of Petroleum Fluids.  As discussed in Sec. 9.2, petroleum con-
stituents may be broadly classified as belonging to the C6- or the C6+ fraction. The heavy end
may be further classified with SARA analysis. Various chromatography methods allow the de-
termination of the mass fractions of single carbon number (SCN) fractions of a fluid. One SCN
is  composed  of  all  the  components  with  boiling  points  between  consecutive  n-alkane  boiling
points.  For  example,  the  C7  SCN  is  composed  of  all  the  components  with  boiling  points  be-
tween the boiling point of n-C7 and n-C8. These analyses routinely extend up to carbon number
30 and may be done up to a carbon number of 45 or more.

Detailed PNA analyses also can be performed. Depending on the details of the analysis, the
aromatic fraction may or may not include the resins and asphaltenes. It is also possible to deter-
mine  the  amounts  of  individual  n-alkanes.  These  types  of  analyses,  although  expensive,  are
especially valuable for wax-precipitation modeling because they very accurately define the com-
ponents of a fluid that will precipitate as wax.

Chapter 9—Asphaltenes and Waxes

I-431

9.7.2 Measurement of Wax-Precipitation Data.  There are a few basic measurements that char-
acterize  a  fluid’s  tendency  to  precipitate  wax.  Lira-Galeana  and  Hammami36  reviewed  the
experimental techniques used to obtain these measurements.

Wax-Appearance Temperature or Cloud Point.  When a liquid solution or melt is lowered
to  the  WAT,  the  wax  molecules  form  clusters  of  aligned  chains.  Once  these  nuclei  reach  a
critical  size,  they  become  stable  and  further  attachment  of  molecules  leads  to  growth  of  the
crystal.  Formation  of  these  nuclei  causes  the  fluid  to  take  on  a  cloudy  appearance,  hence  the
name cloud point. This also is referred to as the wax-crystallization temperature or wax-appear-
ance point. Determination of a WAT significantly higher than the temperatures expected to be
encountered during production indicates the potential for wax-deposition problems.

The WAT depends on which technique is used for the analysis. For example, a microscopy
method allows for observation of much smaller wax crystals than a visual technique with the
unaided eye. The following techniques are used to determine the WAT.

• American  Soc.  for  Testing  and  Materials  (ASTM)  visual  methods.  Oil  in  a  glass  jar  is
submerged  in  a  cooling  bath.  As  the  temperature  of  the  bath  is  lowered,  the  temperature  at
which the fluid’s cloudiness is first observed is determined to be the cloud point.

• Cold  finger.  A  temperature-controlled  rod  is  inserted  in  a  gently  heated  oil  sample.  The

WAT is determined as the temperature at which wax begins to adhere to the rod.

• Viscometry  methods.  Viscometric  techniques  rely  on  detection  of  changes  in  rheological
properties of an oil as wax precipitates. A break in the curve of viscosity plotted vs. tempera-
ture is taken as the WAT.

• Differential-scanning  calorimetry.  This  method  detects  the  latent  heat  of  fusion  released
on crystallization. Although there can be some uncertainty in interpretation of the results, differ-
ential-scanning calorimetry has been widely used for WAT determination and also can provide
data on the heat capacities and heats of fusion or transition associated with liquid/solid and solid/
solid phase transitions.

• Cross-polarized microscopy. In this technique, a microscope with a temperature-controlled
“hot stage” is used to view an oil sample that is being cooled at a constant rate. The use of a
polarized  light  source  and  polarized  objectives  on  the  microscope  allow  the  wax  crystals  to
show  up  as  bright  spots  on  a  black  background.  This  technique  usually  provides  the  highest
WAT value for dead oils.

• Light  transmittance.  The  experimental  apparatus  for  this  method  consists  of  a  PVT  cell
with  a  light  source  and  a  light  power  receiver  mounted  on  opposite  sides  of  the  cell.  When
wax  crystals  appear  in  the  fluid,  the  amount  of  light  transmitted  is  reduced  dramatically,  and
the WAT can be seen as a sharp drop in a plot of light power received vs. temperature. This
method can be used at high pressure and, therefore, can be applied to live reservoir fluids as
well as stock-tank oils.

• Ultrasonics.  Similar  to  the  light-transmittance  technique,  an  ultrasonic  signal  is  sent
through the fluid sample and received at a transducer. The velocity of the ultrasonic wave de-
pends on the density of the medium; thus, the transit time for the wave will change at the WAT.
Wax-Dissolution Temperature.  The wax-dissolution temperature is defined as the tempera-
ture  at  which  all  precipitated  wax  has  been  dissolved  on  heating  the  oil.  The  experimental
techniques  most  often  used  for  determining  wax-dissolution  temperature  are  differential-scan-
ning calorimetry and cross-polar microscopy.

Pour-Point Temperature.  The  pour-point  temperature  is  the  lowest  temperature  at  which
the  oil  is  mobile.  This  is  usually  identified  as  the  stock-tank-oil  gelation  temperature.  The
ASTM pour-point test, similar to the ASTM cloud point tests, involves placing a sample of the
fluid in a jar and cooling it in a temperature-controlled bath. At each 3°C temperature step, the
sample is tested by tipping the jar to determine if the oil is still mobile.

I-432

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Quantification of Wax Precipitation.  None of the tests used to determine the WAT provide
data on the amount of solid precipitated at a temperature below the WAT. Experimental tech-
niques to determine the amount of precipitated wax are described next.

Bulk-Filtration Apparatus.  In this simple experiment, oil in a cylinder is equilibrated at the
desired conditions of pressure, temperature, and, possibly, solvent concentration. The entire con-
tents  of  the  cylinder,  including  oil  and  any  solids  that  may  have  precipitated,  are  ejected
through a filter. The solids collected in the filter then may be analyzed for amount and chemi-
cal  composition.  This  technique  is  time  consuming  and  expensive  but  has  the  advantage  of
providing samples of the precipitated solid for analysis.

Pulsed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).  Pedersen  et  al.48  used  an  NMR  apparatus  to
determine the amount of precipitated solids as a function of temperature for 17 crude oils. The
experimental NMR signals for each oil were compared with calibrated samples of polyethylene
in wax-free oil. Although this technique does not allow for chemical analysis of the deposited
solids, results are obtained much more quickly than with the bulk-filtration apparatus.

9.8 Thermodynamic Models for Wax Precipitation
The thermodynamic basis of solid/liquid equilibrium of components in a melt or dissolved in a
solution  is  well  established  and  is  described  in  many  standard  texts  (e.g.,  Prausnitz  et  al.126).
The basic principles continue to be applied to more complex systems as researchers attempt to
develop  more  accurate  models  of  solid-wax  precipitation.  Lira-Galeana  and  Hammami36  re-
viewed  experimental  techniques  and  thermodynamic  models  for  studying  wax  precipitation  in
petroleum fluids.

The  predictive  capability  of  the  thermodynamic  models  is  affected  both  by  the  form  and
assumptions of the models themselves and the characterization procedures used to quantify the
number  and  properties of  wax-forming  components present  in  a  fluid.  This  section  presents  a
general  form  of  the  thermodynamic  relation  used  to  define  the  K  values  for  solid  and  liquid
phases in equilibrium, and the effect of different simplifying assumptions and thermodynamic
descriptions of the phases involved on the model results are examined.

9.8.1 Thermodynamics of Solid/Liquid Equilibrium.  Thermodynamic Equilibrium.  Thermo-
dynamic models for predicting wax precipitation may be derived assuming single-component or
multicomponent, single-phase or multiphase solid deposits. Regardless of which set of assump-
tions  is  chosen,  the  condition  of  thermodynamic  equilibrium  between  phases  is  expressed  as
the  equality  of  chemical  potential  for  each  component  in  all  phases.  For  one  solid  phase  in
equilibrium with an oil, this condition is given by

μio = μis,

i = 1, ..., nc, .................................................... (9.34)

where μio and μis are the chemical potentials of component i in the oil and solid phases, respec-
tively,  and  nc  is  the  number  of  components.  With  the  fundamental  relation  between  chemical
potential and fugacity of component i (nc),

(dμi = RTd ln fi)T, ......................................................... (9.35)

the equilibrium relation also may be expressed in terms of fugacities:

fio = fis,

i = 1, ..., nc, .................................................... (9.36)

where fio and fis are the fugacities of component i in the oil and solid phases, respectively.

Calculation  of  Pure  Solid  Component  Fugacity.    EOSs  are  not  available  to  describe  the
volumetric behavior of the solid phase as a general function of temperature and pressure; there-
fore,  thermodynamic  solid-precipitation  models  are  derived  by  relating  the  chemical  potential
of a pure solid to the chemical potential of the pure liquid at the same pressure and tempera-
ture  in  terms  of  experimentally  known  melting  properties.  Derivation  of  this  expression  is
discussed in standard thermodynamics texts such as Prausnitz et al.126 The most general form
of this relationship, including multiple solid-phase transitions, is127,128

In the majority of wax-precipitation models, multiple-solid-state transitions are not consid-
ered, or the effects are lumped into the enthalpy of fusion and heat capacity of fusion terms.
Removing these terms and applying the relation between chemical potential and fugacity given

K-Value Equations.  Eq. 9.38 may be used directly to determine pure-solid-component fu-
gacities, or it may be combined with activity- or fugacity-coefficient models to derive expres-
sions  for  solid/liquid  K  values.  This  section  gives  the  fundamental  forms  of  these  K-value
equations.  These  equations  then  are  used  with  various  assumptions  to  perform  solid/liquid  or
solid/liquid/vapor equilibrium calculations.

Activity-Coefficient Models.  Activity coefficients can be defined in terms of fugacities as95

where γi = activity coefficient of component i in a mixture, fi = fugacity of component i in the
0 = standard state fugacity of
mixture, xi = mole fraction of component i in the mixture, and  fi
component i. The standard state fugacity is the fugacity of component i in the same state and
at the same temperature as the mixture and at an arbitrarily chosen pressure and composition.
If  the  activity  coefficients  are  defined  with  reference  to  an  ideal  solution  in  the  sense  of
Raoult’s law, then the pressure is chosen as the system pressure and the composition is chosen
as pure component i. The development of the equations presented here uses this definition.

An expression for solid/liquid K values in terms of activity coefficients can be derived with

the use of the definition of Eq. 9.39 as

pure component i in phase k (k = o, s). For use with activity-coefficient models, the condition
of  equilibrium  between  the  solid  and  liquid  phases  given  in  Eq.  9.36  can  be  substituted  into
Eq. 9.38 to yield the following relation in terms of pure component fugacities.

Fugacity-Coefficient Models.  For use with EOSs, it is convenient to write the solid/liquid K-

Mixed-Activity and Fugacity-Coefficient Models.  The use of the fugacity coefficient as de-
fined in Eq. 9.44 for the liquid phase and the activity coefficient as defined in Eq. 9.39 for the
solid phase leads to the following equation for the solid/liquid K values when the equality of
fugacity condition is applied.

This  formula  is  convenient  when  the  fluid-phase  fugacities  are  determined  with  an  EOS  and

9.8.2 Pure Ideal Solid Model.  In Eq. 9.42, the last term in the exponential accounting for the
difference in molar volume between the solid and liquid as a function of pressure is usually the
smallest and is most often neglected. The heat-capacity term is of larger magnitude but also is
assumed  negligible  in  many  applications.  If  the  nonidealities  of  the  oil  and  solid  phases  also
are considered to be small (i.e., γio/γis = 1) and the solid phase is assumed to be a pure compo-
nent, the equation of ideal solubility results in

Reddy130  reported  one  application  of  the  ideal  solubility  equation.  Eq.  9.47  was  used  to
determine the cloud points and amounts of precipitated wax for synthetic fuels and diesels. In
this case, only n-paraffins were assumed to precipitate. For the synthetic fuels, measured quan-
tities  of  n-paraffins  were  combined  with  a  solvent.  For  the  diesel  fuels,  the  amounts  of  n-
paraffins up to C27 were determined experimentally. The ideal solubility equation was used to
convert the amounts of all n-paraffins in a system to an equivalent amount of reference paraf-
fin. The solubility behavior of the reference component, n-eicosane, was determined experimen-
tally.  The  mixtures  then  were  treated  as  binary  solute/solvent  systems  for  computation.  The
predicted  amount  of  wax  precipitated  at  one  temperature  below  the  cloud  point  is  compared
with the experimental values in Fig. 9.27. These results illustrate the ability of the ideal solubil-
ity equation to correlate correctly experimentally observed trends, provided the distribution of
wax-forming components is well defined.

The  ideal  solubility  equation  also  was  used  by  Weingarten  and  Euchner131  for  predicting
wax  precipitation  from  live  reservoir  fluids.  Experimental  determination  of  wax-crystallization
temperatures (cloud points) for two reservoir fluids was performed at 10 different bubblepoint
pressures  during  differential-liberation  experiments.  Constants  relating  the  enthalpy  of  fusion

and temperature of fusion were determined by linear regression to the experimental data. Fig.
9.28 shows a comparison of the crystallization temperature predicted by the model to the exper-
imental  values.  In  this  implementation,  no  characterization  of  the  feed  is  necessary.  The
precipitated  wax  is  treated  as  a  single  component.  The  model  is  able  to  only  approximately
reproduce an important trend in the data as a function of pressure: at high pressures, at which
only small amounts of the lightest gases are being liberated, the crystallization temperature in-
creases slowly with decreasing pressure; at lower pressures, at which more gas and heavier gas
components are liberated, the crystallization temperature increases more rapidly with decreasing
pressure.

9.8.3 Solid-Solution Models.  Wax  models  describing  the  precipitated  solid  as  a  single-phase
multicomponent  solution  have  been  used  in  a  large  number  of  studies.  The  solid  phase  has
most often been modeled as an ideal or regular solution. The fluid phases are modeled with the
regular solution theory, Flory-Huggins theory, or EOSs. This section describes some of the vari-
ations of the solid-solution model.

Regular  Solid-Solution  Models.    Regular  solution  theory,  as  developed  by  Scatchard  and
Hildebrand,  refers  to  mixtures  with  zero-excess  entropy  provided  that  there  is  no  volume
change of mixing. The Scatchard-Hildebrand equation for activity coefficients is126

Won  also  presented  correlations  for  the  heat  of  fusion,  temperature  of  fusion,  and  molar  vol-
ume as functions of molecular weight and tabulates values of the solubility parameters for the
liquid and solid phases. The correlations are applicable to normal paraffins. The heat of fusion
is given by

ΔHif = 0.1426 MiTif , ....................................................... (9.54)

where Mi is the molecular weight of component i. The heat of fusion from Eq. 9.54 is approxi-
mately equal to the sum of the heat of fusion and one-half the heat of transition for molecules
heavier  than  C22  and  approximately  equal  to  the  heat  of  fusion  for  odd  carbon  number
molecules lighter than C22. The temperature of fusion is given by

Tif = 374.5 + 0.02617 Mi − 20172 / Mi, ......................................... (9.55)

and the molar volume is given by

vio = Mi / ( 0.8155 + 0.6272 × 10−4 Mi − 13.06 / Mi ). ............................. (9.56)
In  Won’s79  model,  solid/liquid/vapor  equilibrium  is  determined.  Liquid/vapor  K  values  are
calculated with the Soave-Redlich-Kwong EOS.73 These K values are used with the solid/liquid
K  values  in  a  three-phase  flash  algorithm  to  determine  the  solid/liquid/vapor-phase  split  as  a
function  of  temperature  and  pressure.  There  is  an  inconsistency  in  this  technique  in  that  the
liquid properties are calculated from an activity-coefficient model for the solid/liquid K values
and  from  an  EOS  for  the  vapor/liquid  K  values.  Despite  this  inconsistency,  Won’s  technique
has  some  important  advantages  over  the  ideal  solubility  models  presented  previously.  These
advantages  include  accounting  for  nonidealities  in  the  solid  and  liquid  phases  and  accounting
for the simultaneous effects of pressure, temperature, and vaporization or solution of gas in the
liquid on solid precipitation.

Won79  applied  this  method  to  a  hydrocarbon  gas  defined  as  a  mixture  of  SCN  fractions
from  C1  to  C40.  These  SCN  fractions  are  assumed  to  have  paraffinic  properties  as  given  by
Eqs.  9.54  through  9.56.  The  feed  composition  is  determined  by  extrapolating  the  measured
mole  fractions  of  C15  through  C19.  Fig.  9.29  shows  the  effect  of  temperature  on  the  molar-
phase splits for this feed gas. The cloud-point temperature can be seen as the highest tempera-
ture at which the solid phase exists, just below 310°K. The amount of solid increases rapidly
as the temperature is decreased below this point. Fig. 9.30 shows the effect of pressure on the
phase equilibrium.

Regular Solution Theory Model for Liquid Phase.  Pedersen et al.80 use the general form of
the solid/liquid K-value relation as given in Eq. 9.42, including the heat-capacity term but ne-
glecting the pressure term. This results in the following equation for the K values:

and the model is completed by defining a relation for the heat-capacity difference as

ΔCpi = a4 Mi + a5 MiT....................................................... (9.61)

Constants a1 through a5 were determined by a least-squares fit to the data of Pedersen et al.48
as a1 = 0.5914 (cal/cm3)0.5, a2 = 5.763 (cal/cm3)0.5, a3 = 0.5148, a4 = 0.3033 cal/(g·K), and a5 =
0.635×10-4 cal/(g·K2).

The oils were characterized on the basis of experimentally determined SCN fraction distri-
butions.  The  fractions  are  subdivided  into  a  paraffinic  part  and  a  naphthenic  plus  aromatic
(NA)  part.  The  NA  fractions  are  given  solubility  parameters  20%  higher  than  those  obtained
from Eqs. 9.8 and 9.59, while the enthalpy of formation for the NA fractions is set to 50% of
the value calculated from Eq. 9.60.

Pedersen et al.80 compared experimental wax precipitation as a function of temperature with
model  predictions  for  16  crude  oils.  Only  liquid/solid  equilibrium  was  calculated.  Fig.  9.31

by Eqs. 9.57 through 9.61. The asterisks show the calculation results obtained when the heat-
capacity  difference  is  neglected.  The  triangles  show  the  results  of  the  use  of  pure  component
enthalpies of fusion of n-alkanes instead of those obtained with Eq. 9.60, and the crosses show
the results of the use of the liquid- and solid-solubility parameters of Won, as opposed to those
given by Eqs. 9.58 and 9.59.

Internally Consistent Model With EOS for Fluid Phases.  Mei et al.132 applied the mixed activity/
fugacity coefficient model given in Eq. 9.46 with a three-phase flash algorithm, in conjunction
with  liquid/vapor  K  values  obtained  from  the  Peng-Robinson  EOS.  As  opposed  to  Won’s
model,79  this  form  maintains  internal  consistency  with  the  use  of  the  EOS  for  all  fluid  phase
calculations  and  uses  regular-solution  theory  only  for  the  solid  solution.  The  fugacity  of  the
pure  solid  is  calculated  with  Eq.  9.41,  neglecting  the  pressure  effect.  Solid-solubility  parame-
ters required for regular-solution theory are calculated with a correlation given by Thomas et al.
9  Won’s  correlations79  for  enthalpy  of  fusion,  temperature  of  fusion,  and  molar  volume  are
used  with  additional  adjustable  coefficients.  A  heat  capacity  of  fusion  correlation  of  the  form
given by Pedersen133 completes the model.

Fluids  used  in  the  study  were  characterized  on  the  basis  of  experimental  SCN  analysis  to
C40. No further subdivision of the components into P, N, and A subfractions was performed. A
good match to experimental cloud points and wax precipitation amounts as a function of tem-
perature was attained through the adjustment of five correlation coefficients.

Ideal Solid-Solution Models.  Applying the assumptions that the solid phase may be consid-
ered  an  ideal  solution,  the  heat  capacity  terms  are  negligible,  and  the  pressure  terms  are
negligible, the K-value expression from Eq. 9.42 can be written as

Flory-Huggins Model for the Liquid Phase.  Flory and Huggins derived expressions for the
thermodynamic properties of polymer solutions. A key parameter in determining the properties
of these mixtures was found to be the large difference in molecular size between the polymer
and  the  solvent  species.  The  same  situation  is  found  in  petroleum  fluids,  in  which  the  large
molecules  of  the  heavy  end  are  in  solution  with  much  smaller  hydrocarbons.  Flory-Huggins
theory has been applied to asphaltene-precipitation modeling as discussed in Sec. 9.4.

Hansen et al.39 used the generalized polymer-solution theory given by Flory134 to derive an
expression  for  the  activity  coefficient  of  a  component  in  the  liquid  phase.  Eq.  9.62  then  was
applied to liquid/solid equilibrium calculations. Characterization of the oils is done on the basis
of  experimental  determination  of  the  SCN  fraction  distribution  to  at  least  C20+.  Each  of  the
SCN fractions then is divided into two subfractions: the aromatic part and the combined paraf-
finic and naphthenic part. Flory interaction parameters are calculated between the subfractions
with  a  group-contribution  method.  Although  good  results  were  obtained,  the  resulting  expres-
sion is complicated and the model has not been used by other researchers.

Ideal Solution Model for the Liquid Phase.  Erickson et al.135 used Eq. 9.62 with the addition-
al assumption that the liquid phase is also an ideal solution. These authors note that the heat of
fusion  and  melting-temperature  terms  are  of  much  greater  importance  than  the  activity-coeffi-
cient terms for prediction of liquid/solid equilibria of stabilized liquids, justifying the use of the
ideal  solubility  equation.  Won’s  correlation79  for  melting  temperature  as  given  in  Eq.  9.55  is
used for n-alkanes. A modification of this expression is used for all other species in the fluid.
A  single  constant  multiplying  Won’s  enthalpy  of  fusion  correlation  is  used  as  an  adjustable
parameter to enable a better fit of the experimental data.

Erickson  et  al.135  applied  the  model  to  stabilized  oils  with  detailed  experimental composi-
tional  analysis,  which  allows  a  direct  determination  of  the  amount  of  n-alkanes  in  each  SCN
fraction up to carbon numbers of 35 or 40. Extrapolation to C50 or higher is then performed.
They also apply a “staged” equilibrium flash, which assumes that once a solid forms, it does
not remix with additional solid that precipitates at lower temperatures. Fig. 9.32 compares mod-
el results with experimental data.

EOS Models for Liquid and Vapor Phases.  Brown et al.17 used a simplification of the fugac-
ity  coefficient  form  of  the  solid/liquid  K-value  expression  (Eq.  9.45)  to  study  the  effects  of
pressure and light components on wax formation. The assumptions used are that the heat capac-

ity difference is negligible, the solid phase can be considered an ideal solution, Δvi is constant,
and pif is small compared with p. Applying these conditions leads to the final K-value expression:

The melting temperature and heat of fusion terms are calculated with the correlations given
by  Erickson  et  al.,135  and  the  molar-volume  difference  is  correlated  as  function  of  molecular
weight. Brown et al. used the simplified perturbed-hard-chain theory EOS to calculate the fu-
gacity coefficients. A correlation was developed for binary-interaction parameters of the paraf-
fin components. The fluid-characterization method is the same as that described for the model
of Erickson et al.135

Model predictions are compared with experimental data in Fig. 9.33 for a live fluid with a
bubblepoint  of  285  bar.  The  model  predictions  show  that  increasing  the  pressure  from  atmo-
spheric (dead) oil causes a decrease in the cloud-point temperature as light ends dissolve in the
oil phase. The light ends increase the solubility of heavy-wax components in the oil. A mini-
mum in the cloud point is achieved at the bubblepoint of the oil. Further pressure increase in
the single-phase region causes an increase in the cloud-point temperature.

Pedersen133  used  the  fugacity-coefficient  model  of  Eq.  9.63  with  the  additional  simplifica-
tion that the pressure effects were neglected, resulting in the following expression for the solid/
liquid K values:

The  Soave-Redlich-Kwong  EOS  is  used  to  determine  the  fugacity  coefficients  for  liquid
and  vapor  phases.  The  characterization  of  the  fluid  is  performed  on  the  basis  of  a  standard
extended compositional analysis in which the mole fraction, molecular weight, and density of
each  SCN  fraction  is  given.  Pedersen133  developed  an  empirical  expression  to  calculate  the

mole  fraction  of  the  potentially  wax-forming  part  of  any  SCN  fraction.  This  approach  is  in
contrast to the characterization procedure of Erickson et al.,135 in which all the subfractions of
a SCN fraction may potentially enter the wax phase, but the parameters of the nonnormal alka-
ne fractions are defined such that they will enter the solid phase in lesser amounts.

Three  adjustable  parameters  are  used  in  the  expression  to  determine  the  mole  fraction  of
the  wax-forming  part  of  each  SCN  fraction.  Fig.  9.34  shows  example  results  for  the  model
comparing the predicted and experimental amount of wax precipitated as a function of tempera-
ture.

9.8.4 Multiple-Pure-Solid-Phase  (Multisolid)  Models.    All  the  models  discussed  up  to  this
point  treat  the  deposited  wax  as  a  single  phase,  consisting  of  either  a  pure  component  or  a
mixture of components as a solid solution. As discussed in Sec. 9.2, experimental work on binary-
alkane  mixtures  shows  that  the  components  can  separate  into  two  immiscible  solid  phases,
where each phase is essentially a pure component. Solid-phase transitions also are observed in
crude oils.

Lira-Galeana et al.52 developed a thermodynamic model for wax precipitation based on the
concept that the precipitated wax is made up of several solid phases, at which each phase con-
sists  of  a  single  component  or  pseudocomponent.  From  stability  considerations,  a  component
may exist as a pure solid if the following inequality is satisfied:

fio − fis

0 ≥ 0................................................................ (9.65)

The  number  of  solid-forming  components  and  the  number  of  solid  phases,  ns,  is  determined
from Eq. 9.65. Once the number of solid phases is known, the phase-equilibrium relationships
for vapor, liquid, and solid are given by

Eq. 9.41 is used, neglecting pressure effects, to obtain the pure-solid fugacity. The pure-liquid
fugacity  is  obtained  from  the  Peng-Robinson  EOS,84  as  are  the  component  fugacities  in  the
liquid and vapor phases.

In the original multisolid-wax model presented by Lira-Galeana et al.,52 the fluids are char-
acterized  by  splitting  the  C7+  fraction  into  7  to  12  pseudocomponents.  No  further  subdivision
of the pseudocomponents into P, N, or A fractions is performed. Instead, melting temperature
and enthalpy of fusion correlations are developed to define properties that represent an average
of the three subgroups. These correlations weight the aromatic properties more heavily for heav-
ier molecular-weight pseudocomponents. The heat capacity of fusion is given by the correlation
of  Pedersen  et  al.,48  as  shown  in  Eq.  9.61.  Fig.  9.35  shows  experimental  data  and  predicted
results of the model.

Pan et al.19 also have used the multisolid-wax model but with a different fluid-characteriza-
tion procedure. The characterization is based on experimental SCN analysis. Every five consec-
utive  carbon  number  fractions  are  lumped  together.  The  relative  amounts  of  the  P,  N,  and  A
subfractions  are  determined  experimentally  or  with  correlations.  Melting  temperature  and  en-
thalpy of fusion properties are assigned to the paraffinic subfractions with Won’s correlations.79
For naphthenes and aromatics, the correlations of Lira-Galeana et al.52 were used, with the ex-
ception of the enthalpy of fusion for aromatics, which was fit with a new correlation indepen-
dent  of  the  molecular  weight.  For  the  heat  capacity  of  fusion,  the  correlation  of  Pedersen

et  al.48  was  used  for  all  components.  Results  of  the  model  for  a  synthetic  oil  at  110  bar  are
shown in Fig. 9.36, illustrating the reduction in cloud point and also the reduction in amount
of wax precipitated with the addition of methane to the system.

Multisolid-Wax Model Including Enthalpies of Transition.  Nichita  et  al.128  used  Eq.  9.37
to derive an expression for the ratio between the pure-solid and pure-liquid fugacities including
the  effect  of  multiple  solid-state  transitions.  Assumptions  used  in  the  derivation  are  that  the
heat capacity of fusion is constant, the heat capacities of transition are negligible, the solid/liq-
uid  molar-volume  difference  is  constant,  and  the  terms  for  the  enthalpies  of  transition  are  all
evaluated at the temperature of the first transition. The authors state that this treatment of the
enthalpies of transition may lead to relative differences in results of up to 10% compared with
lumping the enthalpies of transition in with the enthalpy of fusion. Applying these considera-
tions results in

Ungerer  et  al.136  derived  a  similar  expression  with  multiple  enthalpies  of  transition;  how-
ever, the enthalpy terms are evaluated at the fusion temperature rather than the first transition
temperature.  The  model  is  applied  with  a  single  pure-component-solid  phase.  Nichita  et  al.128
used Eq. 9.68 with the modified multisolid-wax model presented in Pan et al.,19 including the
correlations  for  all  component  properties  except  enthalpies  of  fusion  and  enthalpies  of  transi-
tion; new correlations are presented for these properties. The model of Nichita et al.128 is used
with the Peng-Robinson EOS to calculate a pressure-temperature phase diagram, shown in Fig.
9.37, for a synthetic fluid with phenanthrene as the precipitating component. The binary-interac-
tion  parameter  between  methane  and  phenanthrene  was  adjusted  to  match  the  vapor/liquid
dewpoint.

Excess-free-energy models thus can be used with the solid/liquid K-value equation expressed in

Coutinho and coworkers published a number of studies on modeling paraffin-wax formation
from synthetic and real petroleum fluids.53,137–139 In these works, an equation is used for the pure-
component  solid  to  liquid-fugacity  ratio  similar  to  that  given  in  Eq.  9.68,  with  the  additional
assumption  that  only  a  single  enthalpy  of  transition  term  is  used  and  the  pressure  effect  is

Excess  Gibbs  energy  models  are  used  for  the  solid  phase.  A  modified  Wilson’s  equation
with  one  adjustable  parameter  was  used  initially.138  Then,  a  predictive  version  of  the  UNI-
QUAC equation was developed,53 which incorporates multiple-mixed-solid phases and is used
to predict wax formation in jet and diesel fuels.139 An analysis of the amounts of the individual
n-alkanes is required for the fluid characterization. The N and A subfractions of a SCN frac-
tion  can  be  treated  separately  or  lumped  as  a  single  pseudocomponent.  Fig.  9.38  presents
model results for the amount of wax precipitated as a function of temperature compared with
experimental  data  for  a  number  of  fuels.  Fig.  9.39  shows  the  change  in  composition  of  the
solid phase as a function of temperature. The accuracy of the model is very good.

ity  coefficients  in  the  solid  phase  at  atmospheric  pressure.  The  Poynting  factor  is  used  to
determine  the  high-pressure  solid  fugacity  from  the  fugacity  determined  at  atmospheric  pres-
sure. The liquid phase is modeled with an EOS/GE model. This combination of fluid and solid
treatments yields good results for prediction of solid/liquid and solid/liquid/vapor phase bound-
aries up to 200 Mpa for binary and multicomponent systems of n-alkanes. The quality of the
predictions is a result of the treatment of the pressure effect on the solid phase and the EOS/
GE model, which guarantees continuity between fugacities of the fluid and solid phases.

9.8.6 Comparison of Models.  Pauly et al.139 compared the models of Won,79 Pedersen et al.,80
Hansen  et  al.,39  Coutinho  and  Stenby,138  Ungerer  et  al.,136  and  the  ideal  solution  model.  The
models  are  tested  on  systems  composed  of  n-decane  and  a  heavy  fraction  of  normal  alkanes
from C18 to C30. Fig. 9.40 compares the total amount of solid precipitate as a function of tem-
perature for the models with experimental data. The solid-solution models overpredict the cloud-
point temperature and the amount of solid precipitated, while the multisolid model gives better
results  for  the  cloud  point  but  underpredicts  the  amount  of  wax  precipitated,  at  least  for  the
higher  temperature  region.  Coutinho  and  Stenby’s  model138  gives  a  very  good  match  of  the
data.

Nichita et al.128 also compared their modification of the multisolid-wax model with a solid-
solution  model.  The  solid  phase  is  assumed  to  be  ideal,  and  the  liquid  phase  is  described  by
the EOS. Results for the two models are compared in Fig. 9.41 for three synthetic mixtures of
n-decane  with  n-alkanes  from  C18  to  C30.  As  in  the  comparison  performed  by  Pauly  et  al.,141
the solid-solution model overpredicts the cloud-point temperature and the amount of wax pre-
cipitated, while the multisolid-wax model gives good estimates of the cloud-point temperature
yet underpredicts the amount of wax precipitated.

9.9 Wax-Deposition Models
A  number  of  thermodynamic  models  were  described  in  the  previous  section  to  calculate  the
amount of solid wax precipitated as a function of pressure, temperature, and fluid composition.
As discussed in Sec. 9.1, wax precipitation does not necessarily lead to solid deposition. Ther-

modynamic  models  for  solid/liquid  K  values  have  been  coupled  with  models  for  wax  deposi-
tion in pipelines. The form of these models is discussed briefly in this section. For deposition
to occur in pipelines, the following conditions must be fulfilled.142

• The pipeline wall temperature must be below the WAT for the fluid.
• A negative radial temperature gradient must be present in the flow. That is, the wall tem-
perature  must  be  lower  than  the  centerline  temperature.  A  zero  gradient  implies  that  no
deposition will occur.

• Wall friction must be large enough so that wax crystals can stick to the wall.
Burger et al.143 investigated the significant physical processes leading to wax deposition in
pipelines.  These  processes  are  molecular  diffusion,  Brownian  diffusion,  shear  dispersion,  and
gravity  settling.  Brownian  movement  of  small  solid-wax  crystals  will  result  in  diffusion-like
transport of these particles when a concentration gradient exists. This effect is normally neglect-
ed  in  pipeline-deposition  models.  Gravity  settling  can  occur  because  precipitated  wax  crystals
are denser than the surrounding liquid. Again, this effect is usually neglected in flow models.
Molecular diffusion and shear dispersion are described next,144 assuming that the three deposi-
tion conditions have been satisfied.

9.9.1 Molecular  Diffusion.    Flow  in  pipes  will  be  laminar  or  will  have  a  laminar  sublayer
adjacent  to  the  pipe  wall.  There  will  be  a  temperature  gradient  across  this  sublayer  with  the
lower temperature at the pipe wall. When the temperature is below the WAT, the flowing oil
will contain precipitated solid wax, which is in equilibrium with the liquid. Because the temper-
ature  is  colder  toward  the  wall,  more  of  the  wax  components  will  exist  in  the  solid  phase  at
equilibrium. This results in a concentration gradient in the liquid phase with a lower concentra-
tion  of  wax-forming  components  at  the  pipe  wall.  Wax  molecules  will  be  transported  toward
the wall by molecular diffusion. Once these molecules reach the solid/liquid interface, they are
available to be added to the solid deposit by the mechanisms of crystal growth. The equation
describing the rate of mass transport caused by molecular diffusion is

where mi =  mass of component i, t = time, ρoil =  mass density of oil, Di =  effective diffu-
sion  coefficient  for  component  i,  A  =  deposition  area,  wi =  weight  fraction  of  component  i,
and r = radial distance.
Because the radial-concentration gradient is not readily available, the chain rule is used in
Eq.  9.73  to  express  this  as  the  product  of  the  mass-concentration  (weight  fraction)  gradient
with  respect  to  temperature  and  the  temperature  gradient.  The  mass-concentration  gradient  is
derived from the solubility limit as a function of temperature obtained from a thermodynamic
model.

9.9.2 Shear Dispersion.  When suspended solid particles are being transported in a fluid in the
laminar-flow regime, they tend to travel with the mean speed and direction of the fluid. Parti-
cles have higher velocities at greater distances from the pipe wall, and the particles also rotate

I-452

as they flow. These rotating particles will exert drag forces, causing displacement of the flow
paths  of  any  neighboring  particles.  When  the  particle  concentration  is  high,  these  interactions
result in net transport of particles toward the low-velocity region at the pipe wall.

Considering  all  the  wax-forming  components  together  as  a  single  wax  pseudocomponent,

the rate of mass transport of wax caused by shear dispersion takes the form

d mw
d t = k *Cwγ A, .......................................................... (9.74)
where  mw  =  mass  of  wax,  k*  =  empirical  constant,  Cw  =  concentration  of  precipitated  wax  at
the wall, and γ = shear rate. The form of this equation shows that the deposition rate increases
linearly with increasing shear rate.

Weingarten  and  Euchner131  reported  results  of  diffusion  and  shear-deposition  experiments
and modeling with Eqs. 9.73 and 9.74. They note that shear rate also has an important effect
that is not related to shear transport. Pieces of deposited wax can be dislodged from the pipe
wall in a process called sloughing. Sloughing will be dependent on the shear rate, the nature of
the deposit, and the nature of the wall surface. Sloughing occurs when the wall shear rate ex-
ceeds the shear strength of the deposit and may occur both in the laminar and turbulent flow
regimes.

Keating and Wattenbarger145 also have used the diffusion and shear-deposition equations in
conjunction with a wellbore simulator to model wax deposition and removal in wellbores. Wax
removal is caused by equilibrium conditions, not explicit modeling of the sloughing process. A
study  isolating  and  comparing  the  relative  effects  of  molecular  diffusion  and  shear  dispersion
on wax deposition concludes that molecular diffusion is the dominant effect.146 Majeed et al.147
obtained good results modeling wax deposition in pipelines considering only the diffusive trans-
port.

A detailed compositional wax-deposition model for pipelines has been derived by combin-
ing the differential equations of mass and energy conservation and the laws of diffusion with a
thermodynamic  model  for  solid/liquid  K  values  of  the  form  given  in  Eq.  9.54.142  These  mass
and heat-transfer relations also have been applied with the multisolid-wax model by Ramirez-
Jaramillo et al.148

9.10 Prevention and Remediation of Wax Precipitation
Crystallization  of  waxes  in  crude  oils  leads  to  non-Newtonian  flow  characteristics,  including
very high yield stresses that are dependent on time and the shear and temperature histories of
the fluid. This crystallization may cause three problems: high viscosity, which leads to pressure
losses; high-yield stress for restarting flow; and deposition of wax crystals on surfaces.149

Wax-precipitation-induced viscosity increases and wax deposition on pipes are the primary
causes of high flowline pressure drops. In turn, these pressure losses lead to low flow rates that
make  conditions  for  wax  deposition  more  favorable.  In  extreme  cases,  pumping  pressure  can
exceed  the  limits  of  the  system  and  stop  flow  entirely.  A  related  problem  is  the  high-yield
stress for restarting flow. When oil is allowed to stand in a pipeline at temperatures below its
pour point, a certain pressure is required to break the gel and resume flow. Again, this pressure
may be higher than the pressure limits of the pumps and pipelines.149

Wax  can  deposit  on  surfaces  in  the  production  system  and  in  the  formation.  Wax  deposi-
tion can be prevented or removed by a number of different methods. These methods fall into
three main categories: thermal, chemical, and mechanical.

9.10.1 Thermal.  Because precipitation is highly temperature dependent, thermal methods can
be  highly  effective  both  for  preventing  and  removing  wax-precipitation  problems.  Prevention

Chapter 9—Asphaltenes and Waxes

I-453

methods  include  steam-  and  electrical-heat  tracing  of  flowlines,  in  conjunction  with  thermal
insulation. Thermal methods for removing wax deposition include hot oiling and hot watering.
Hot-water treatments cannot provide the solvency effects that hot oiling can, so surfactants are
often  added  to  aid  in  dispersion  of  wax  in  the  water  phase.  Surfactants  are  discussed  under
chemical methods.

Hot  oiling  is  one  of  the  most  popular  methods  of  deposited  wax  removal.  Wax  is  melted
and dissolved by hot oil, which allows it to be circulated from the well and the surface-produc-
ing  system.  Hot  oil  is  normally  pumped  down  the  casing  and  up  the  tubing;  however,  in
flowing wells, the oil may be circulated down the tubing and up the casing. There is evidence
that hot oiling can cause permeability damage if melted wax enters the formation.1

Higher  molecular-weight  waxes  tend  to  deposit  at  the  high-temperature  bottom  end  of  the
well.  Lower  molecular-weight  fractions  deposit  as  the  temperature  decreases  up  the  wellbore.
The upper parts of the well receive the most heat during hot oiling. As the oil proceeds down
the well, its temperature decreases and the carrying capacity for wax is diminished. Thus, suffi-
cient oil must be used to dissolve and melt the wax at the necessary depths.150

9.10.2 Chemical.  The types of chemicals available for paraffin treatment include solvents, crys-
tal modifiers, dispersants, and surfactants.

Solvents  can  be  used  to  treat  deposition  in  production  strings  and  also  may  be  applied  to
remediate  formation  damage.151  Although  chlorinated  hydrocarbons  are  excellent  solvents  for
waxes, they generally are not used because of safety and processing difficulties they create in
the produced fluid. Hydrocarbon fluids consisting primarily of normal alkanes such as conden-
sate  and  diesel  oil  can  be  used,  provided  the  deposits  have  low  asphaltene  content.  Aromatic
solvents such as toluene and xylene are good solvents for both waxes and asphaltenes.

Crystal  modifiers  act  at  the  molecular  level  to  reduce  the  tendency  of  wax  molecules  to
network and form lattice structures within the oil. Operating at the molecular level makes them
effective in concentrations of parts per million, as opposed to hot oil and solvents, which must
be applied in large volumes. Crystal modifiers have relatively high molecular weights to allow
them  to  interact  with  high-molecular-weight  waxes.  Because  they  have  high  melting  points,
their use is limited in cold climates.150

Dispersants are chemicals that break deposited wax into particles small enough to be reab-
sorbed  into  the  oil  stream.  These  chemicals  are  used  in  low  concentrations  in  aqueous  solu-
tions, making them relatively safe and inexpensive.

Surfactants may be used as deposition inhibitors or can act as solubilizing agents for nucle-

ating agents in an oil. Surfactants are not used as generally as the other chemical types.

9.10.3 Mechanical.  Scrapers  and  cutters  are  used  extensively  to  remove  wax  deposits  from
tubing because they can be economical and result in minimal formation damage.1 Scrapers may
be  attached  to  wireline  units,  or  they  may  be  attached  to  sucker  rods  to  remove  wax  as  the
well is pumped. Deposits in surface pipelines can be removed by forcing soluble or insoluble
plugs  through  the  lines.  Soluble  plugs  may  be  composed  of  naphthalene  or  microcrystalline
wax. Insoluble plugs are made of plastic or hard rubber.

Another  method  of  mechanical  intervention  to  prevent  deposition  is  the  use  of  plastic  or
coated pipe. Low-friction surfaces make it more difficult for wax crystals to adhere to the pipe
walls.  Deposition  will  still  occur  if  conditions  are  highly  favorable  for  wax  precipitation,  and
deposits will grow at the same rate as for other pipes once an initial layer of material has been
laid down; therefore, the pipe and coating system must be capable of withstanding one of the
other methods of wax removal.

Properties of Produced Water
David J. Blumer, ConocoPhillips

10.1 History of Produced Water in Oil and Gas Fields
Early U.S. settlements commonly were located near salt licks that supplied salt to the popula-
tion. These salt springs were often contaminated with petroleum, and many of the early efforts
to  acquire  salt  by  digging  wells  were  rewarded  by  finding  unwanted  amounts  of  oil  and  gas
associated with the saline waters. In the Appalachian Mountains, saline water springs common-
ly occur along the crests of anticlines.1

In 1855, it was found that petroleum distillation produced light oil that was, as an illumi-
nant,  similar  to  coal  oil  and  better  than  whale  oil.2  This  knowledge  spurred  the  search  for
saline  waters  containing  oil.  With  the  methods  of  the  salt  producers,  Colonel  Edward  Drake
drilled a well on Oil Creek, near Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859. He struck oil at a depth of
70 ft, and this first oil well produced approximately 35 B/D.3

Early  oil  producers  did  not  realize  the  significance  of  the  oil  and  saline  waters  occurring
together.  In  fact,  it  was  not  until  1938  that  the  existence  of  interstitial  water  in  oil  reservoirs
was generally recognized.4 Torrey5 was convinced by 1928 that dispersed interstitial water ex-
isted  in  oil  reservoirs,  but  his  colleagues  rejected  his  belief  because  most  of  the  producing
wells  did  not  produce  any  water  on  completion.  Occurrences  of  mixtures  of  oil  and  gas  with
water  were  recognized  by  Griswold  and  Munn,6  but  they  believed  that  there  was  a  definite
separation of the oil and water, and that oil, gas, and water mixtures did not occur in the sand
before a well tapped a reservoir.

It was not until 1928 that the first commercial laboratory for the analysis of rock cores was
established, and the first core tested was from the Bradford third sand (Bradford field, McKean
County,  Pennsylvania).  The  percent  saturation  and  percent  porosity  of  this  core  were  plotted
vs. depth to construct a graphic representation of the oil and water saturation. The soluble min-
eral salts that were extracted from the core led Torrey to suspect that water was indigenous to
the oil-productive sand.

Shortly thereafter, a test well was drilled near Custer City, Pennsylvania, that encountered
greater than average oil saturation in the lower part of the Bradford sand. This high oil satura-
tion resulted from the action of an unsuspected flood, the existence of which was not known
when  the  location  for  the  test  well  had  been  selected.  The  upper  part  of  the  sand  was  not
cored. Toward the end of the cutting of the first core with a cable tool, core barrel oil began to
come into the hole so fast that it was not necessary to add water for the cutting of the second

I-466

section of the sand. Therefore, the lower 3 ft of the Bradford sand was cut with oil in a hole
free from water.

Two samples from this section were preserved in sealed containers for saturation tests, and
both  of  them,  when  analyzed,  had  a  water  content  of  approximately  20%  pore  volume.  This
well  made  approximately  10  BOPD  and  no  water  after  being  stimulated  with  nitroglycerine.
Thus,  the  evidence  developed  by  the  core  analysis  and  the  productivity  test  after  completion
provided a satisfactory indication of the existence of immobile water, indigenous to the Bradford-
sand oil reservoir, which was held in its pore system and could not be produced by convention-
al pumping methods.5

Fettke7  was  the  first  to  report  the  presence  of  water  in  oil-producing  sand;  however,  he
thought that the drilling process might have introduced it. Munn8 recognized that moving under-
ground  water  might  be  the  primary  cause  of  migration  and  accumulation  of  oil  and  gas.
However, this theory had little experimental data to back it until Mills9 conducted several labo-
ratory experiments on the effect of moving water and gas on water/oil/sand and water/oil/gas/
sand  systems.  Mills  concluded  that  “the  updip  migration  of  oil  and  gas  under  the  propulsive
force of their buoyancy in water, as well as the migration of oil, either up or down dip, caused
by hydraulic currents, are among the primary factors influencing both the accumulation and the
recovery  of  oil  and  gas.”  This  theory  was  seriously  questioned  and  completely  rejected  by
many of his contemporaries.

Rich10 assumed that “hydraulic currents, rather than buoyancy, are effective in causing accu-
mulation  of  oil  or  its  retention.”  He  did  not  believe  that  the  hydraulic  accumulation  and
flushing of oil required rapid movement of water, but rather that oil was an integral constituent
of  the  rock  fluids,  and  that  it  could  be  carried  along  with  them  whether  the  movement  was
very slow or relatively rapid.

The  effect of  water  displacing oil  during  production was  not  recognized in  the  early days
of  the  petroleum  industry  in  Pennsylvania.  Laws  were  passed,  however,  to  prevent  operators
from  injecting  water  into  the  oil  reservoir  sands  through  unplugged  wells.  In  spite  of  these
laws, some operators at Bradford secretly opened the well casing opposite shallow groundwater
sands to start a waterflood in the oil sands. Effects of artificial waterfloods were noted in the
Bradford field in 1907 and became evident approximately 5 years later in the nearby oil fields
of  New  York.11  Volumetric  calculations  of  the  oil-reservoir  volume  that  were  made  for  engi-
neering studies of the waterflood operations proved that interstitial water was generally present
in the oil sands. Garrison12 and Schilthuis4 reported on the distribution of oil and water in the
pores of porous rocks. They described the relationship between water saturation and formation
permeability, while discussing the origin and occurrence of “connate” water in porous rocks.

Lane and Gordon13 first used the word “connate” to mean interstitial water deposited with
the sediments. The processes of rock compaction and mineral diagenesis result in the expulsion
of large amounts of water from sediments and movement out of the deposit through the more
permeable rocks; therefore, it is highly unlikely that the water now in any pore is the same as
when the particles that surround it were deposited. White14 redefined connate water as “fossil”
water because it has been out of contact with the atmosphere for an appreciable part of geolog-
ic time period. Thus, connate water is distinguished from “meteoric” water, which entered the
rocks  in  geologically  recent  times,  and  from  “juvenile”  water,  which  came  from  deep  in  the
earth’s crust and has never been in contact with the atmosphere.

Meanwhile,  petroleum  engineers  and  geologists  had  learned  that  waters  associated  with
petroleum could be identified, with regard to the reservoir in which they occurred, by knowl-
edge  of  their  chemical  characteristics.15  Commonly,  the  waters  from  different  strata  differ
considerably in their major dissolved chemical constituents, making the identification of water
sourced  from  a  particular  stratum  possible.16  However,  in  some  areas,  the  concentrations  of
dissolved constituents in waters from different strata do not differ significantly, and the identifi-

cation of such waters is difficult or impossible. Sec. 10.4 describes new techniques to assist in
this  process,  because  several  new  analytical  and  statistical  techniques  for  trace  species  apply
nicely to this problem.

The enormous quantities of water produced from many fields originally surprised operators
and, even today, water-handling costs continue to be significant to company management try-
ing to reduce costs. The amount of water produced with the oil usually increases as the amount
of oil produced decreases, even during primary production. At the end of the life of some reser-
voirs, 100 times (or more) as much water is processed as oil sold.

The history of oil production is replete with operators who decided that the water-handling
costs  were  too  high  for  an  older  field  to  be  profitable,  so  they  sold  the  property  to  another
operator.  The  new  operator  finds  ways  of  reducing  the  impacts  of  that  water  to  produce  the
smaller  oil  stream  profitably,  until  they  become  discouraged  and  sell  to  yet  another  operator,
and  so  on.  Very  few  mature  reservoirs,  especially  those  that  have  undergone  secondary  and
tertiary recovery, have been completely abandoned because new technology and better engineer-
ing have made it economical to produce oil at extremely high water cuts or to reduce the water
cut by controlling water production in the reservoir and wells. It is the challenge of producers
to recover the most oil from the reservoir profitably, which means discovering methods to min-
imize the impacts of produced water for that particular field.

10.1.1 Produced  Water  Is  Important.    As  mentioned  previously,  extraction  of  oil  and  gas
from  underground  reservoirs  often  is  accompanied  by  water  or  brine,  which  is  referred  to  as
produced water. As reservoirs mature, especially if secondary or tertiary recovery methods are
used,  the  quantity  of  water  climbs  and  often  exceeds  the  volume  of  the  hydrocarbons  before
the reservoir is exhausted. The cost of producing, handling, and disposing of the produced wa-
ter  often  defines  the  economic  lifetime  of  a  field  and  the  actual  hydrocarbon  reserves;  there-
fore, understanding and predicting the aspects, behavior, and problems induced by the produced-
water flow is important.

Because  the  produced  water  is  not  usually  a  revenue  stream,  the  emphasis  on  water-flow
prediction,  technology  development,  and  engineering  application  has  not  traditionally  been  a
major  focus  of  oil-  and  gas-production  engineering.  This  is  complicated  by  the  multidisci-
plinary nature of produced-water issues, including chemistry; hydrodynamics; surface/interfacial
science; materials science; corrosion; mechanical, chemical, and petroleum engineering; as well
as environmental regulators. Compared with the advanced knowledge of water and brines, pro-
duced water is relatively poorly understood because of its unique aspects.

Produced water is chemically very complex. The process of producing and processing pro-
duced  water  causes  changes  in  temperature  and  pressure.  The  addition  of  treating  chemicals,
along with the presence of coproduced gas, oil, and likely solids, changes the produced-water
properties and behavior. Understanding how production perturbs the chemical state of the pro-
duced  water  is  the  key  to  predicting  and  controlling  many  problems.  Also,  the  chemical
composition is an excellent source of information about the particular reservoir and the reser-
voir depletion process.

Diagnosing the source of the increased water production from a well is important in decid-
ing whether to pursue water-shutoff options. First, if the field is waterflooded, water must be
produced  to  recover  the  oil  in  accordance  with  relative  permeability;  only  water  in  excess  of
this should be a target for remedial treatments. If this is edge water, water shutoff can be diffi-
cult,  even  with  polymer-gel  technology.  Polymer-gel  water-shutoff  treatments  have  proved
successful in cases in which faults intersect the wellbore, causing a channel for water flow. If
excess water production is bottomwater, the well can be plugged back. However, excess water
production is often the result of intrusive water from a shallow sand or another aquifer gaining
access to the well from a leaky casing or faulty completion. This source of intrusive water can
be repaired, depending on the economics.17

Waters  produced  with  petroleum  are  growing  in  importance  from  an  environmental  stand-
point.  In  the  past,  these  waters  were  considered  waste  and  required  disposal.  Early  on,  less
attention  was  paid  to  the  fate  of  the  produced  water  in  the  environment,  because,  after  all,  it
was only water. It later became clear that possible contamination from produced-water disposal
practices, especially on the surface, needs to be considered. The bulk of produced water from
land-based operations is reinjected. Injection of these waters back into the petroleum reservoir
serves three purposes: it produces additional petroleum through secondary recovery (waterflood-
ing), it uses a potential pollutant, and, in some areas, it controls land subsidence.

Secondary and tertiary oil-recovery processes that use water injection result in the produc-
tion  of  even  more  water  with  the  oil.  To  inject  these  waters  into  reservoir  rocks,  suspended
solids  and  oil  must  be  removed  to  an  appropriate  degree  to  prevent  plugging.  Most  offshore
platforms dispose of their produced water directly into the ocean, but have to meet increasingly
stringent regulations on the entrained and dissolved oil and other chemicals that are in the pro-
duced  water.  Some  offshore  operators  are  considering  produced-water  reinjection  to  avoid
meeting these expensive ocean-disposal requirements.

10.1.2 Where Does the Water Come From?  As  discussed  previously,  in  the  original  reser-
voir,  the  pores  in  the  mineral  matrix  contain  the  natural  fluids  at  chemical  equilibrium.
Because reservoir rock is largely of sedimentary origin, water was present at the time of rock
genesis  and,  therefore,  is  trapped  in  the  pores  of  the  rock.  Water  may  also  move  or  migrate
according to the hydraulic pressures induced by geological processes that also form the reservoirs.
In  hydrocarbon  reservoirs,  some  of  the  water  is  displaced  by  the  hydrocarbon,  but  some
water  always  remains.  If  the  rock  originated  in  a  sea  or  ocean,  then  it  will  be  saline.  Rocks
deposited in lakes, rivers, or estuaries have fresher water. Originally, the water was in chemical
equilibrium with the mineral suite of the rock, but, on invasion of the oil and gas, a new equi-
librium with those phases was achieved. Thus, there are both equilibria and chemical-reaction
dynamics  associated  with  the  inorganic  (mineral)  phases  and  the  oil  and  gas  phases  that  are
important  to  understand.  Water  is  an  excellent  solvent;  it  will  react  to  dissolve  many  of  the
phases it contacts.

10.2 Primary Production
When  oil  or  gas  is  flowed  or  lifted  from  a  reservoir,  some  water  inevitably  accompanies  the
other  phases.  This  is  a  consequence  of  the  relative  permeability  behavior  of  the  rock,  as  dis-
cussed in the chapter on relative permeability in this section of the Handbook. In particular, if
the water saturation is above the irreducible water saturation (Swr), then some water will move
along  with  the  oil  and  gas  phases  present  as  the  fluids  flow  from  the  pores  of  the  reservoir
rock.  This  water  is  in  chemical  equilibrium  with  the  rock  and  gas  phases  under  the  original
temperature and pressure present in the reservoir. Because the pressure and temperature change
as  a  consequence  of  producing  the  oil  and  gas,  the  chemical  equilibrium  of  the  water  is  per-
turbed. The perturbation can have severe detrimental effects. The operator must be interested in
these effects to mitigate their economic and environmental impacts.

The  chemical  changes  occurring  during  primary  production  are  largely  a  result  of  cooling
the water and reducing the pressure as it comes up the tubing into the surface production facili-
ties. However, more-complex behavior can result if multiple zones or reservoirs are coproduced
either  within  the  same  wellbore  downhole  or  mixed  on  the  surface.  The  mixing  can  lead  to
scale  deposition,  corrosion,  and  other  effects.  Artificial  lift  can  also  alter  the  stability  of  the
water.  In  particular,  gas  lift  and  jet  pumps  are  particular  artificial-lift  examples  in  which  the
chemical composition of the system may change because of the addition of foreign gas or wa-
ter  streams  in  the  wellbore.  Another  impact  of  artificial  lift  is  on  the  pressure  profile  of  the
system.  Electrical  submersible  pumps  can  locally  heat  the  water  enough  to  enter  a  scaling

regime  (particularly  for  calcium  carbonate)  in  the  area  of  the  motor,  deposit  scale  on  it,  and
cause the motor to burn out.

During primary production, the water cut may increase as the reservoir is depleted. This is
particularly  important  in  reservoirs  that  have  natural  waterdrives  so  that  a  water  aquifer  is  in
both pressure and hydraulic communication with the hydrocarbon reservoir. Thus, as the hydro-
carbon is produced, the water from the aquifer is drawn in to fill the void left behind, and the
water  saturation  of  the  rock  is  increased.  The  pressure  in  the  reservoir  attempts  to  stay  con-
stant.  Depending  on  the  efficiency  of  the  hydraulic  connection  to  the  aquifer,  the  pressure
decline over time will be reduced, perhaps to zero in some cases. However, the proportion of
water produced will rise until the cost of handling the water exceeds the value of the hydrocar-
bons produced. Oil and gas reserves of the typical reservoir are limited by this water-handling
cost. Clearly, produced-water issues are central, although this may not be immediately apparent
because only the hydrocarbons produce revenue.

10.3 Economics of Produced Water
Except in the case of gas production from coal seams, water production rates usually start slow-
ly  from  the  initial  development  of  a  property.  Facility  designers  may  deliberately  forestall
construction  and  installation  of  water-handling  equipment  at  the  beginning  of  a  project  to  re-
duce  upfront  capital  costs.  The  eventual  appearance  of  water  production  requires  the  addition
of the capital investment and operational expense to handle the growing water rates, which do
not generate revenue to offset the cost. The natural tendency for companies is to minimize the
immediate  expense;  as  a  result,  companies  often  underdesign  the  equipment  or  fail  to  budget
properly for operational expenses.

Fig. 10.1 demonstrates the impact of rising water cut on the total cost of producing a barrel
of oil assuming a constant water-treatment cost of U.S. $0.10 per barrel of water. Actual water
costs can be lower or higher. This sobering fact vividly illustrates the importance of improving
the technology of water treatment to lower the unit cost over time as reservoirs mature. Most
secondary and tertiary oil reserves are produced at high water cuts.

Typically, the connate water (as the original water in the reservoir is called) is more saline
than surface water. Many oil and gas reservoirs are in rocks originally lying at the bottom of
oceans and were saturated with the seawater present at the time. Of course, the composition of
these  ancient  seawaters  may  be  significantly  different  than  current  seawater.  Additionally,  as
the sediments were buried and the temperature and pressure increased, the chemical composi-
tion  of  the  water  and  rock  changed  to  maintain  chemical  equilibrium.  These  reactions  took
place  over  geologic  time,  so  the  aqueous  phases  of  most  oil  reservoirs  are  in  true  chemical
equilibrium with the mineral suite with which it is in contact. The converse is not necessarily
true; many examples of meta-stable mineral suites are known in hydrocarbon reservoirs, proba-
bly  because  of  mass-transfer  limitations.  Thus,  one  use  of  an  examination  of  the  water
composition by geochemists is to provide insight into the burial history of the sediments in the
reservoir.  In  particular,  the  isotope  ratios  of  the  elements  are  indicative  of  the  origins  of  the
waters and, in some cases, of the mechanisms by which the hydrocarbons were produced dur-
ing geologic time.

Besides  the  commonly  thought  of  species  or  components  in  the  water  such  as  salts  and
dissolved  minerals,  oilfield  waters  also  contain  organic  species.  Much  less  attention  has  been
allocated  to  the  organic  chemical  species  in  the  produced  water,  yet  they  also  have  conse-
quences. In particular, new environmental concerns about water and air pollution have required
more focus on the dissolved organic species in the water. Some examples of these species in-
clude  the  volatile  organic  acids  like  formic,  acetic,  propionic,  and  butyric  acids;  naphthenic
acids; and dissolved aromatic compounds like benzene, toluene, and xylenes. The latter species
are  particularly  important  for  offshore  overboard  water-disposal  operations,  because  they  are
often included in the measurements of the oil-in-water carryover, which are limited by law in
many areas. The carryover of oil and other hydrocarbons in the produced water is one of the
most important issues facing the surface engineer.

10.3.1 How Do We Characterize Produced Water?  Because produced waters are chemically
complex systems, compositional computer models are needed to predict their behavior accurate-
ly. This technology has advanced steadily since the mid-1970s. One of the first thermodynamics-
based  water-chemistry  computer  models  was  WATEQ,  developed  by  Truesdale  and  Jones  at
USGS, along with its database of 522 dissolved species and 192 mineral phases. This computer
code was converted to FORTRAN IV in 1974 and became known as WATEQF. It has become
the standard against which all future chemistry models are measured. Several major efforts to
improve and extend the range of applications of these chemistry models have resulted in sophis-
ticated  programs  to  model  water  flow  and  geochemical  reactions  in  reservoirs,  production  of
water  to  surface,  and  water-chemistry  changes  during  processing  in  surface  facilities.  These
changes can have extremely serious impacts through precipitation of scales and corrosion; there-
fore, the accuracy of these predictions affects the profitability and, sometimes, the viability of
many oil and gas projects.

Along  with  the  computer  models  is  the  improvement  in  analytical  chemistry  technology
needed to characterize the individual water in a particular system and provide the fundamental
chemical equilibrium and kinetics data that form the basis for the computer models. The analyt-
ical  instruments  now  used  include  inductively  coupled  plasma  spectroscopy  (ICP),  ion  chro-
matography  (IC),  capillary  electrophoresis  (CE),  ion  selective  electrodes,  and  automatic
titrators.  In  certain  special  analyses,  more  advanced  techniques  are  used  such  as  mass  spec-
troscopy,  high  performance  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC),  and  various  “hyphenated  tech-
niques” such as inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), gas chromatography-
mass spectroscopy, and HPLC-mass spectroscopy. In circumstances in which speciation of the
inorganic  constituents  is  particularly  of  interest,  ion  chromatography  can  be  used  along  with
ICP  or  ICP-MS  detection.  Laser  light-scattering  instruments  are  usually  used  for  looking  at
suspended particles and entrained oil droplets and their size distribution.

One of the most significant produced-water developments during the last two decades has
been in the environmental impact and regulatory area. It is no longer a technical issue regard-
ing the composition and fate of the produced water from oil and gas extraction (and transporta-
tion  and  refining,  also).  In  many  cases,  government  regulations  limit  or  change  the  options
available and may define the degree of characterization through sampling and analysis imposed
on the operator. In the United States, produced water is still an exempt effluent and need not
meet the more stringent requirements of hazardous wastes; however, other regulations impose
many  other  requirements  that  must  be  monitored,  met,  and  documented  continuously.  These
regulations, the priority of concerns, and their degree of enforcement differ worldwide. When
operating in nondomestic areas, familiarization with these regulations is mandatory, preferably
during the conceptual facility- and field-design stages of a new development. These regulations
have  changed  worldwide  toward  more  stringent  requirements.  When  choosing  a  particular
method to handle produced water, that method’s viability for the long term must be considered.

10.4 Scale Deposition and Corrosion
The  two  main  detrimental  effects  encountered  during  handling  produced  water  are  deposition
of insoluble scales and corrosion of metal surfaces, which leads to leaks and costly repairs.18,19
In accordance with the importance of the topics of scale and corrosion, there is an enormous
and quickly growing literature, which cannot be reviewed easily here. Scale deposition is pre-
dicted  through  the  use  of  the  computer  chemistry  models  mentioned  previously.  The  most
common  scales  are  calcium  carbonate,  calcium  sulfate,  barium  sulfate,  iron  sulfide,  and  iron
carbonate.

Inhibition of most of these scales is now successful through proper application of particular
organic compounds, most of which act to poison the growth sites of the crystals while they are
still  submicron  in  size.  Two  common  classes  of  these  inhibitors  are  the  organophosphonates,
such  as  diethylenetriaminepentamethylene  phosphonic  acid,  and  low-molecular-weight  poly-
acrylic  acid  polymers  (commonly  <1,000  molecular  weight).  Unfortunately,  the  computer
programs are less useful in predicting precisely which scale inhibitor to select for a particular
produced  water;  therefore,  laboratory  experiments  are  needed.  These  experiments  are  often
done with synthetic waters made to reflect the composition of the actual produced water; how-
ever, because minor and trace species are sometimes ignored in formulating these synthetic test
waters,  the  results  of  the  laboratory  tests  can  be  incorrect  in  picking  the  most  effective
inhibitor,20 which can result in ineffective inhibition or much higher treating costs.

Corrosion predictions for produced waters are much less certain than scale-precipitation pre-
dictions. The corrosion reactions are much more complex and involve many factors other than
the  thermodynamics  of  the  obvious  chemical  reactions  of  oxidizing  and  dissolving  the  metal,
such as mass transport, concentration cells, effect of fluid flow and velocity, scale deposition,
and  microbes.  In  cases  in  which  H2S  levels  become  high,  improperly  specified  metallurgy  or
welding procedures can lead to catastrophic and rapid failure from sulfide stress cracking. Loss
of life has resulted from this corrosion. Every effort must be taken to measure and predict the
water and gas compositions properly, so that the metallurgy will accommodate those levels. If
levels  approaching  0.05  psia  H2S  are  encountered,  National  Assn.  of  Corrosion  Engineers
(NACE) specifications should be followed carefully.

While there are several computer programs that attempt to predict corrosivity of a produced-
water  system,  these  are  currently  just  reasonably  good  guides.  Because  of  the  complexity  of
real systems, an approach that begins with the water and gas composition inputs to these com-
puter models and then is followed by laboratory testing, field testing, and, finally, an ongoing
field-monitoring  program  is  likely  to  result  in  successful  corrosion  control  in  that  particular
system.  The  level  of  effort  applied  should  be  proportional  to  the  aggressiveness  of  the  corro-
sion, the consequences of failure, and the length of time the system must operate.

I-472

Corrosion mitigation typically takes two forms: investment in corrosion-resistant alloys or a
chemical  corrosion-inhibition/monitoring  program.  Choosing  the  best  option  on  a  new  project
should involve a complete life-cycle cost analysis. Existing operations often have already deter-
mined that choice, so it is up to the engineers, production chemists, and operators to create the
most cost-effective solutions to the corrosion challenges presented by that particular produced
water.  Like  scale  inhibitors,  corrosion  inhibitors  must  be  chosen  for  each  particular  area  by
thorough laboratory and field testing to find the inhibitor with the best combination of cost and
performance.  Dosage  adjustments  based  on  field  corrosion-monitoring  results  can  ensure  long
facility life and few, if any, leaks. An inhibitor mitigation process that incorporates a feedback
loop will optimize the dosages of the inhibitor until corrosion-damage/repair cost is minimized,
while  the  amount  of  inhibitor  pumped  is  no  greater  than  necessary.  A  similar  process  can  be
applied to scale inhibitors and other treating chemicals with modifications with appropriate mon-
itoring techniques.

10.4.1 Sampling  and  Analyses  of  Produced  Waters.    The  composition  of  subsurface  water
commonly changes vertically and laterally in the same aquifer. Changes may be brought about
by the intrusion of other waters and by discharge from and recharge to the aquifer. As a reser-
voir  is  produced,  the  compositions  typically  change  with  time;  therefore,  it  is  difficult,  but
important,  to  obtain  a  representative  sample  of  a  given  subsurface  body  of  water.  Any  one
sample  is  a  very  small  part  of  the  total  mass,  which  may  vary  widely  in  composition;  there-
fore,  it  is  generally  necessary  to  obtain  and  analyze  many  samples.  Also,  the  samples  them-
selves  may  change  with  time  as  gases  evolve  from  solution  or  may  precipitate  solids  when
coming to ambient conditions. The sampling sites should be selected to fit into a comprehen-
sive network to cover an oil-productive basin, in which case the information is of value in both
exploration and production.

Water  compositions  from  particular  wells  change  over  time,  so  a  periodic  sampling  pro-
gram  is  needed.  The  sampling  frequency  needed  is  not  universal.  The  best  guideline  is  the
particular field itself: the faster the composition changes, the more often the water needs sam-
pling.  Fields  undergoing  waterflood  or  tertiary  recovery  naturally  show  water-chemistry
changes as the injected water mixes with the formation water. Reservoirs under primary produc-
tion  can  show  dilution  from  water  moving  from  adjacent  compacting  clay  beds  into  the
petroleum reservoir as the pressure declines because of the removal of oil, gas, and brine. This
can be a detector for possible subsidence of the reservoir and perhaps the surface. The compo-
sition of oilfield water can vary with the position within the geologic structure from which it is
obtained. In some cases, the salinity will increase upstructure to a maximum at the point of oil/
water contact.

10.5 Drillstem or Downhole Water Sampling

10.5.1 Sample Methods.  Various techniques and devices are now available for the evaluation
of newly drilled wells, but there remain some important factors that must be considered when
obtaining these samples and evaluating the results. The primary problem stems from the con-
tamination of the reservoir with the drilling, completion, and stimulation fluids used during the
well-construction  operation.  The  contamination  is  usually  easily  detected  from  the  analytical
results.  If  one  realizes  that  high  concentrations  of  particular  species  that  were  used  in  those
wellbore  fluids  appear  in  the  water-analysis  results,  then  the  sample  was  likely  contaminated
and the usefulness of the sample reduced accordingly. Naturally, one must always include these
species in the analysis. Unfortunately, if a sample is contaminated there is seldom an opportuni-
ty to re-enter the hole and obtain a new sample, except at great cost.

One approach for a standard drillstem test (DST) is to sample the water after each stand of
pipe  is  removed.  Normally,  the  total-dissolved-solids  (TDS)  content  will  increase  downward,

Chapter 10—Properties of Produced Water

becoming  constant  when  pure  formation  water  is  obtained.  A  test  that  flows  water  improves
the  chances  of  an  uncontaminated  sample;  otherwise,  the  best  chance  is  to  sample  just  above
the DST tool, because this was the last water to enter the tool. Newer downhole samplers some-
times  allow  multiple  samples  to  be  obtained;  therefore,  if  one  first  pulls  a  large  volume  of
water  into  the  tool  and  then  a  second  (or  third)  sample  from  the  same  interval,  there  is  a
chance of getting uncontaminated water in that sample.

For  example,  analyses  of  water  obtained  from  a  DST  of  Smackover  limestone  water  in
Rains County, Texas, demonstrates the errors caused by improper sampling of DST water. Anal-
yses  of  top,  middle,  and  bottom  samples  taken  from  a  50-ft  zone  of  fluid  recovery  show  an
increase in salinity with depth in the drillpipe, indicating that the first water was contaminated
by mud filtrate.20 Thus, the bottom sample was the most representative of Smackover water.

Sample Containing Dissolved Gas.  Knowledge  of  certain  dissolved  hydrocarbon  gases  is
used in exploration.21,22 Mapping anomalies of hydrocarbons in both surface water and subsur-
face aquifer water samples is an extraordinarily powerful geochemical tool.

Sampling at the Flowline.  Another method of obtaining a sample for analysis of dissolved
gases is to place a sampling device in a flowline, as Fig. 10.2 illustrates. The device is connect-
ed to the flowline, and water is allowed to flow into and through the container, which is held
above the flowline, until 10 or more volumes of water have flowed through the container. The
lower valve on the sample container is closed, and the container removed. If any bubbles are
present in the sample, the sample is discarded, and a new one is obtained.

Sampling at the Wellhead.  It  is  common  practice  to  obtain  a  sample  of  formation  water
from  a  sampling  valve  at  the  wellhead.  A  plastic  or  rubber  tube  can  be  used  to  transfer  the
sample from the sample valve into the container (usually plastic). The source and sample con-
tainer  should  be  flushed  to  remove  any  foreign  material  before  a  sample  is  taken.  After
flushing the system, the end of the tube is inserted into the bottom of the container, and sever-
al volumes of fluid are displaced before the tube is removed slowly from the container and the

container  is  sealed.  Fig.  10.3  illustrates  a  method  of  obtaining  a  sample  at  the  wellhead.  An
extension of this method is to place the sample container in a larger container, insert the tube
to the bottom of the sample container, allow the brine to overflow both containers, and with-
draw the tube and cap the sample under the fluid.

At  pumping  wellheads,  the  brine  will  surge  out  in  heads  and  be  mixed  with  oil.  In  such
situations, a larger container equipped with a valve at the bottom can be used as a surge tank,
an oil/water separator, or both. To use this device, place the sample tube in the bottom of the
large container, open the wellhead valve, rinse the large container with the well fluid, allow the
large  container  to  fill,  and  withdraw  a  sample  through  the  valve  at  the  bottom  of  the  large
container. This method obtains samples that are relatively oil free.

Field-Filtered Sample.  For  some  studies,  it  is  necessary  to  obtain  a  field-filtered  sample.
Fig.  10.4  shows  a  filtering  system  that  has  proved  to  be  successful  for  various  applications.
This filtering system is simple and economical. It consists of a 50-mL disposable syringe, two
check valves, and an inline-disk filter holder. The filter holder takes size 47-mm-diameter, 0.45-
μm pore-sized filters, with the option of a prefilter and depth prefilter. After the oilfield brine
is separated from the oil, the brine is drawn from the separator into the syringe. With the sy-
ringe,  it  is  forced  through  the  filter  into  the  collection  bottle.  The  check  valves  allow  the
syringe to be used as a pump for filling the collection bottle. If the filter becomes clogged, it
can be replaced in a few minutes. Approximately 2 minutes are required to collect 250 mL of
sample. Usually three samples are taken, with one being acidified to pH 3 or less with concen-
trated HCl or HNO3, and another stabilized with biocide. The system can be cleaned easily or
flushed with brine to prevent contamination.

Sample for Stable-Isotope Analysis.  Stable isotopes have been used in several research stud-
ies  to  determine  the  origin  of  oilfield  brines.23–25  The  most  common  isotopes  studied  are
deuterium/hydrogen, 2H/1H; oxygen, 18O/16O; and stable carbon isotopes, 13C/12C. Also, isotopi-
cally labeled compounds are sometimes used to trace injection waters or stimulation fluids. The
isotopic analyses of the water, gas, and oil phases can be useful to geochemists in determining
the sequence of fluid migrations in reservoirs during their genesis.

Sample for Determining Unstable Properties or Species.  A  mobile  analyzer  was  designed
to measure pH, Eh (redox potential), O2, resistivity, S=, HCO3
=, and CO2 in oilfield water
at the wellhead. Portable field kits for chemical analysis are available for these analyses, which
provide  reasonably  accurate  on-site  results.  When  oilfield  brine  samples  are  collected  in  the
field and transported to the laboratory for analysis, many of the unstable constituents change in
concentration. The amount of change depends on the sampling method, sample storage, ambi-

-, CO3

Chapter 10—Properties of Produced Water

ent  conditions,  and  the  amounts  of  the  constituents  in  the  original  sample.  Therefore,  an
analysis of the brine at the wellhead is necessary to obtain reliable data.26

Sample Containers.  The types of containers that are used include polyethylene, other plas-
tics,  hard  rubber,  metal  cans,  and  borosilicate  glass.  Glass  will  adsorb  various  ions,  such  as
iron and manganese, and may contribute boron or silica to the aqueous sample. Plastic and hard-
rubber  containers  are  not  suitable  if  the  sample  is  to  be  analyzed  to  determine  its  organic
content, unless tested and shown otherwise. A metal container is used by some laboratories if
the sample is to be analyzed for dissolved hydrocarbons such as benzene. Produced water often
will corrode metal containers, unless they are lined. The corrosion will alter the chemical com-
position  of  the  water  by  adding  metal  ions  such  as  iron  and  manganese  and  by  lowering  the
pH. The type of container selected depends on the planned use of the analytical data.

10.5.2 Water  Sampling  and  Analysis  Specification.    This  section  defines  a  “standard  water
analysis” that specifies the complete suite of species and provides suggestions on sampling and
analytical techniques. The analysis specifications have been used by the author for two decades
and have been used by others, with adaptations for particular needs. The results of this exten-
sive list of analyses are the required input for the various computer multicomponent simultaneous-
equilibrium  chemistry  models  that  can  predict  correctly  the  changes  in  the  water  chemistry,
scale precipitation, rock/water interactions, water sources and mixing, and corrosion.

While there is always temptation and pressure to limit the range of analyses performed on
a sample, analytical technology has reduced dramatically the value of limiting the range of an
analysis. Most instruments automatically measure many different species in a single run; there-
fore,  it  may  cost  the  same  to  get  one  species  as  it  does  to  get  many,  depending  on  the
analytical technique. For instance, the commonly used ICP instruments typically measure 10 to
60  elements  at  a  time  (depending  on  the  particular  instrument)  in  a  few  minutes;  therefore,
adding or subtracting a species on the ICP changes the actual cost very little.

The  analytical  results  should  be  stored  in  an  electronic  database  for  further  analysis  and
comparison of samples from the same points over time. Certain evaluations can be performed
on  individual  samples,  such  as  scale-deposition  predictions  or  monitoring  for  corrosion  with
dissolved  manganese  and  iron.  Other  evaluations  require  successive  samples,  with  consistent
sample-collection and -analysis procedures, for the data to be meaningful. These results can be

mapped  to  follow  the  reservoir-area  changes  over  time.  They  also  can  provide  insight  as  to
potential improvements in reservoir management of a waterflood, because the various ions pro-
vide natural tracer data for the injected water. The data are also useful for deciphering casing
leaks, conductive (but unmapped) faults, and, in favorable cases, zonal splits of water produc-
tion.  If  the  data  were  not  collected  on  each  sample  consistently  or  if  the  analysis  suite  was
minimized to save money in the laboratory, these valuable evaluations are not possible.

Tabulation of Sample Description.  Fig. 10.5 illustrates the information that should be ob-
tained for each sample of oilfield water. As much information as possible should be recorded
when  taking  the  sample.  The  following  measurements  must  be  taken  in  the  field  at  the  sam-
pling  point  coincident  with  taking  the  sample  because  these  values  change  quickly  once  the
sample is removed: temperature, pH, Eh (optional), dissolved O2 (Chemet or meter), H2S, CO2,
pressure, and bicarbonate (HCO3−) alkalinity titration (recommended).

Example 10.1  Problem. Conduct laboratory analyses to generate the data needed to enter
into the computer programs that will predict the stability of water, with respect to precipitation
of scales as a function of temperature and pressure.

Solution. Obtain three bottles for each sample: one for cations/metals (Table 10.1), one for
anions/etc. (Table 10.2), and one for organic acids (Table 10.3). The bottles should be polyethy-
lene,  Teflon,  or  polycarbonate.  Not  all  polyethylenes  are  satisfactory  because  some  contain
relatively  high  amounts  of  metal  contributed  by  catalysts  in  their  manufacture.  Fill  a  bottle
with acid solution, let stand for a week, and then analyze the acid for metals to test the bottle’s
suitability.  Glass  should  be  avoided  if  the  sample  can  freeze,  because  it  is  likely  to  break.

Chapter 10—Properties of Produced Water

I-477

Glass often is reactive with highly saline brines and strongly adsorbs some oils and other organ-
ics, including treating chemicals.

Filter  a  measured  portion  of  the  sample  taken  for  the  anion  analysis  through  a  0.45-μm
filter to measure the total suspended solids. If a large amount of solids is collected, the filter
paper should be saved for later X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (to identity the solids), and a laser particle-size analysis.
Tables 10.1 and 10.3 specify that the bottles for the cation and organic-acids analyses have
additives: 10 mL of ultrapure nitric acid (HNO3) for the ICP analysis and 1 mL of glutaralde-

I-478

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

hyde for the organic acids. This stabilizes the samples so that precipitation of the metals does
not  ruin  the  results  for  the  ICP  analysis.  In  particular,  the  iron  will  precipitate  as  the  sample
sits  and  that  precipitate  removes  many  of  the  other  species  from  solution.  Also,  the  naturally
present bacteria in the water will quickly eat the organic acids in the samples unless biocide is
added to that sample. If no biocide, such as glutaraldehyde, has been added, no organic acids
are  detected;  therefore,  adding  glutaraldehyde  to  a  bottle  used  for  the  organic-acid  analysis  is
highly recommended.

In addition to the water analysis, the gas in contact with the water is important. Taking a
gas sample at the same time is recommended, although one taken at a different time can suf-
fice for less critical applications. The main constituents of interest in the gas are the CO2 and
H2S. The H2S analysis usually is done at the sampling point. CO2 and H2S are very important
in predicting what will happen with the water.

In general, bacterial surveys are recommended, primarily with the serial dilution technique
with one medium for sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and another medium for general anaero-
bic  bacteria.  Many  times,  the  exact  medium  composition  (and  sometimes  the  incubation
temperature) has to be adjusted for a particular field to get that population to grow well. The
bacteria have a lot of negative side effects, such as generating H2S, causing a safety and corro-
sion problem, and making the schmoo (organic/inorganic deposits) formation in the produced-
water  problem  worse.  Microbial-induced  corrosion  can  be  very  severe,  especially  in  deadlegs
(stagnant areas in which water and solids are trapped), low-flow areas, and underdeposits.

10.5.3 Physical Properties of Oilfield Waters.  This section discusses important physical prop-
erties  of  oilfield  waters.  As  a  rule,  it  is  best  to  have  reliable  laboratory  measurements  of  the
physical properties of oilfield waters. If laboratory measurements are not available, correlations
may have to be used. For example, McCain has published some of the most widely used corre-
lations  for  the  physical  properties  of  oilfield  waters.21,22  In  addition  to  defining  physical
properties of oilfield waters, we present correlations for calculating many of those properties.

10.6 Compressibility
The  compressibility  of  formation  water  at  pressures  above  the  bubblepoint  is  defined  as  the
change  in  water  volume  per  unit  water  volume  per  psi  change  in  pressure.  This  is  expressed
mathematically as

cw = − 1

Bw1 and Bw2 = water formation volume factor (FVF) p1 and p2, bbl/bbl, and
Bw= average water FVF corresponding to V, bbl/bbl.
Water  compressibility  also  depends  on  the  salinity.  In  contrast  to  the  literature,  laboratory
measurements  by  Osif23  show  that  the  effect  of  gas  in  solution  on  compressibility  of  water
with NaCl concentrations up to 200 g/cm3 is essentially negligible. Osif’s results show no ef-
fect  at  gas/water  ratios  (GWRs)  of  13  scf/bbl.  At  GWRs  of  35  scf/bbl,  there  is  probably  no
effect, but certainly no more than a 5% increase in the compressibility of brine.

Laboratory measurements20 of water compressibility resulted in linear plots of the reciprocal
of compressibility vs. pressure. The plots of l/cw vs. P have a slope of m1 and intercepts linear
in  salinity  and  temperature.  Data  points  for  the  systems  tested  containing  no  gas  in  solution
resulted in Eq. 10.2.

where  cw  =  water  compressibility,  psi−1;  p  =  pressure,  psi;  C  =  salinity,  g/L  of  solution;  T  =
temperature, °F; m1 = 7.033; m2 = 541.5; m3 = −537; and m4 = 403.3 × 103. Eq. 10.2 was fit
for pressures between 1,000 and 20,000 psi, salinities of 0 to 200 g/L NaCl, and temperatures
from 200 to 270°F. Compressibilities were independent of dissolved gas.

When conditions overlap, the agreement with the results reported by both Dorsey24 and Dot-
son and Standing25 is very good. Results from the Rowe and Chou26 equation agree well up to
5,000 psi (their upper pressure limit) but result in larger deviations with increasing pressure. In
almost all cases, the Rowe and Chou compressibilities are less than that of Eq. 10.2.

10.7 Density
The  density  of  formation  water  is  a  function  of  pressure,  temperature,  and  dissolved  con-
stituents.  It  is  determined  most  accurately  in  the  laboratory  on  a  representative  sample  of
formation  water.27  The  formation-water  density  is  defined  as  the  mass  of  the  formation  water
per unit volume of the formation water. Electronic densiometers can quickly determine the den-
sity  with  accuracy  of  +/−0.00001  g/cm3  over  a  wide  range  of  temperatures,  although  most
oilfield data are reported at a 60°F reference temperature.

I-480

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Fig. 10.6—Specific gravity of salt solutions at 60°F and 14.7 psia.

In the past, density in metric units (g/cm3) was considered equal to specific gravity; there-
fore,  for  most  engineering  calculations,  density  and  specific  gravity  were  interchangeable  in
most of the older designs.16 However, process simulation software used in modern facility de-
sign uses the true density or specific gravity of the water to avoid significant cumulative errors,
especially when working with low-gravity heavy oils or concentrated brines. Thus, water sam-
ples  taken  for  providing  input  to  these  programs  must  have  accurate  densities  determined
experimentally.  Alternatively,  some  modern  multicomponent  chemical  equilibrium  simulators
accurately calculate the densities (and other physical properties) from the complete analysis of
the  waters  within  the  temperature  and  pressure  range  of  the  thermodynamic  database.  Experi-
mental  verification  of  the  computer  predictions  should  be  performed  in  cases  in  which  any
error could have significant impact.

When laboratory data or actual water samples are unavailable, the density of formation wa-
ter  at  reservoir  conditions  can  be  estimated  roughly  (usually  to  within  +/−10%)  from  correla-
tions  (Figs.  10.6  through  10.8).  The  only  field  datum  necessary  is  the  density  at  standard
conditions, which can be obtained from the salt content by use of Fig. 10.6. The salt content
can  be  estimated  from  the  formation  resistivity,  as  measured  from  electric-log  measurements.
The density of formation water at reservoir conditions can be calculated in four steps.

• With  the  temperature  and  density  at  atmospheric  pressure,  obtain  the  equivalent  weight

percent NaCl from Fig. 10.7.

• Assuming  the  equivalent  weight  percent  NaCl  remains  constant,  extrapolate  the  weight

percent to reservoir temperature and read the new density.

• Knowing  the  density  at  atmospheric  pressure  and  reservoir  temperature,  use  Fig.  10.8  to
find  the  increase  in  specific  gravity  (density)  when  compressed  to  reservoir  pressure.  For  oil
reservoirs below the bubblepoint, the “saturated-with-gas” curves should be used; for water con-

sidered to have no solution gas, the “no-gas-in-solution” curves should be used. These curves
were computed from data given by Ashby and Hawkins.28

• The  density  of  formation  water  (g/cm3)  at  reservoir  conditions  is  the  sum  of  the  values
read from Figs. 10.7 and 10.8. They can be added directly because the metric units are referred
to the common density base of water (1 g/cm3). The metric units can be changed to customary
units (lbm/ft3) by multiplying by 62.37.

Another approach to calculating water density is to first calculate the density of formation

water at standard conditions with McCain’s correlation.21,22

ρw = 62.368 + 0.438603 × S + 1.60074 × 10−3 × S2, ............................ (10.3)

where density is in lbm/ft3, and S is salinity in weight percent. Then, density at reservoir condi-
tions  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  density  in  Eq.  10.3  by  the  brine  FVF  at  the  reservoir
temperature and pressure of interest.

The specific gravity of formation water can be estimated, if the TDS is known, with

γw = 1 + Csd × 0.695 × 10−6, ............................................... (10.4)

where Csd = concentration of dissolved solids (also known as TDS), mg/L.

Rogers  and  Pitzer29  provide  precise  but  very  detailed  calculations.  They  tabulated  a  large
number  of  values  of  compressibility,  expansivity,  and  specific  volume  vs.  molality,  tempera-
ture,  and  pressure.  A  semiempirical  equation  of  the  same  type  was  found  to  be  effective  in

describing thermal properties of NaCl (0.1 to 5 molality) and was used to reproduce the volu-
metric data from 0 to 300°C and 1 to 1,000 bars.

10.8 Formation Volume Factor
The  water  FVF,  Bw,  is  defined  as  the  volume  at  reservoir  conditions  occupied  by  1  STB  of
formation  water  plus  its  dissolved  gas.  It  represents  the  change  in  volume  of  the  formation
water  as  it  moves  from  reservoir  conditions  to  surface  conditions.  Three  effects  are  involved:
the liberation of gas from water as pressure is reduced, the expansion of water as pressure is
reduced, and the shrinkage of water as temperature is reduced.

Fig. 10.9  is  a  typical  plot  of  water  FVF  as  a  function  of  pressure.  As  the  pressure  is  de-
creased to the bubblepoint, pb, the FVF increases as the liquid expands. At pressures below the
bubblepoint, gas is liberated, but, in most cases, the FVF still will increase because the shrink-
age of the water resulting from gas liberation is insufficient to counterbalance the expansion of
the liquid. This is the effect of the small solubility of natural gas in water.

The  most  accurate  source  of  the  FVF  is  laboratory  data.  It  also  can  be  calculated  from
density correlations if the effects of solution gas have been accounted for properly. Eq. 10.5 is
used to estimate Bw if solution gas is included in the laboratory measurement or correlation of
ρrc.

Vsc = volume occupied by a unit mass of water at standard conditions, ft3,
ρsc = density of water at standard conditions, lbm/ ft3, and
ρrc = density of water at reservoir conditions, lbm/ ft3.
The density correlations and the methods of estimating ρsc and ρrc were described previous-
ly. The FVF of water can be less than one if the increase in volume resulting from dissolved
gas is not great enough to overcome the decrease in volume caused by increased pressure. The
value of FVF is seldom higher than 1.06.

An alternative expression for the FVF of brine may be calculated from McCain:21,22

Bw = (1 + ΔVw p)(1 + ΔVwT), .................................................. (10.6)

where  p  =  pressure  in  psia,  and  T  =  temperature  in  °F.  McCain  reported  that  this  correlation
agrees with a limited set of published experimental data to within 2%. The correlation is con-
sidered valid for temperatures to 260°F, and pressures to 5,000 psia. An increase in dissolved
solids causes a slight increase in ΔVwT and a slight decrease in ΔVwp, which offset each other
to within 1%.

10.9 Resistivity
The resistivity of formation water is a measure of the resistance offered by the water to electri-
cal  current.  It  can  be  measured  directly  or  calculated.16  The  direct-measurement  method  is
essentially  the  electrical  resistance  through  a  l-m2  cross-sectional  area  of  1  m3  of  formation
water. Formation-water resistivity, Rwg, is expressed in units of Ω-m. When resistivity of forma-
tion water is used in electric-log interpretation, the value is adjusted to formation temperature.

10.10 Surface (Interfacial) Tension
Surface tension is a measure of the attractive force acting at a boundary between two phases.
If the phase boundary separates a liquid and a gas or a liquid and a solid, the attractive force
at the boundary usually is called surface tension; however, the attractive force at the interface
between  two  liquids  is  called  interfacial  tension  (IFT).  The  lower  the  IFT,  the  smaller  the
droplet  of  the  internal  phase.  At  very  low  values  of  IFT,  oil  and  water  become  miscible  and
behave as a single phase. IFT is an important factor in enhanced recovery. Also, the IFT deter-
mines  the  ease  of  separation  of  oil  from  water,  because  it  determines  the  size  of  the  oil  or
water droplets, depending on which phase is internal.

Most  chemicals  added  during  the  course  of  drilling  or  production  have  a  major  effect  on
the IFT of the produced water and the hydrocarbons. Indeed, certain corrosion inhibitors added
to the three-phase production stream can lower the produced-water IFT enough (<1 to 5 dyne/
cm)  to  cause  the  droplet  size  of  the  entrained  oil  to  be  small  enough  that  no  injection-well
plugging  is  observed,  even  at  high  oil  carryover  (percent  levels)  in  the  reinjected  produced
water.29 In attempting to separate the oil from the three-phase production stream, the addition
of  emulsion  breakers  changes  the  IFT  and  promotes  the  agglomeration  of  small  droplets  into
larger ones that separate quickly. Formulating, selecting, testing, and troubleshooting emulsion
breakers is the focus of an enormous amount of the effort devoted to the impacts of producing
water with hydrocarbons.

Surface tension is measured in the laboratory by a tensiometer, by the drop method, or by a
variety of other methods. Descriptions of these methods are found in most physical chemistry
texts. The laboratory measurements traditionally have been difficult and done only by special-
ized  facilities.  Computerized  commercial  pendant-drop  and  falling-drop  tensiometers  are  now
available for use by chemists in more general field R&D laboratories. IFT is a critical property
of produced water, but is rarely measured because of the analytical difficulties. This new tech-
nology  promises  to  improve  the  ability  to  troubleshoot  problems  by  directly  measuring  IFT
instead of trial-and-error testing.

10.11 Viscosity
The  viscosity  of  formation  water,  μw,  is  a  function  of  pressure,  temperature,  and  dissolved
solids.  In  general,  brine  viscosity  increases  with  increasing  pressure,  increasing  salinity,  and
decreasing temperature.31 Dissolved gas in the formation water at reservoir conditions generally
results in a negligible effect on water viscosity. There is little information on the actual numer-
ical effect of dissolved gas on water viscosity.

Gas-in-the-water phase behaves entirely differently than gas in hydrocarbons.* In water, the
presence of the gas actually causes the water molecules to interact with each other more strong-
ly,  thus  increasing  the  rigidity  and  viscosity  of  the  water.  However,  this  effect  is  very  small
and has not been measured to date. In the physical chemistry literature, there is an enormous
amount of indirect evidence to support this concept.

For  the  best  estimation  of  the  viscosity  of  water,  refer  to  Kestin  et  al.32  Their  correlating
equations  involve  32  parameters  for  calculating  the  numerical  effect  of  pressure,  temperature,

The  28  tables  generated  from  the  correlating  equations  cover  a  temperature  range  from  20  to
150°C, a pressure range from 0. 1 to 35 mPa, and a concentration range from 0 to 6 molal.

Figs. 10.10 through 10.12 may be used to approximate water viscosity. These figures are
calculated from the following correlation presented by McCain20,21 for water viscosity (in cp) at
1 atm:

between 100 and 400°F, and salinities to 26 wt%.

McCain reported that Eq. 10.12 fits the data to within 4% for pressures below 10,000 psia and
temperatures in the range from 86 to 167°F. The fit is within 7% for pressures between 10,000
and 15,000 psia.

Figs. 10.10 through 10.12 show the effects of pressure, temperature, and NaCl content on
the  viscosity  of  water.  They  may  be  used  when  the  primary  contaminant  is  sodium  chloride.
Alternatively, the viscosities are calculated and reported by computer chemistry models at the
particular temperature, pressure, and gas compositions present in the facilities.33

Some  engineers  assume  that  reservoir-brine  viscosity  is  equal  to  that  of  distilled  water  at
atmospheric pressure and reservoir temperature. In this case, it is assumed that the viscosity of
brine  is  essentially  independent  of  pressure  (a  valid  premise  for  the  pressure  ranges  usually
encountered). In some high-temperature/high-pressure reservoirs recently developed, this assump-
tion  breaks  down.  In  those  cases,  experimental  measurements  under  the  relevant  temperature/
pressure conditions are recommended over attempting to extrapolate the distilled-water viscosi-
ties or even the computer models.

10.12 The pH
Water (H2O) reversibly dissociates into hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which is described
by the equilibrium constant for this chemical reaction, Keq (H2O) or simply Kw. The acidity or
hydrogen  ion  activity  of  aqueous  solutions  controls  many  of  its  properties  and  is  commonly
expressed as the pH.

and

pH = − log10aH + , ........................................................ (10.14)

where  aH+  is  known  as  the  activity  of  hydrogen  ion  in  solution.  The  hydrogen  ion  activity  is
related to the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] by means of the activity coefficient, γH+, giving

aH + = γH + × H+ . ...................................................... (10.15)

Solutions are known as neutral when the pH = 7, because at that point hydrogen ions and
hydroxide ions are present in equal amounts, aH+ = aOH− = 10−7 M. When hydrogen ions pre-
dominate, the pH falls below 7, and the solution is described as being acidic. In the opposite
case  in  which  hydroxide  ions  outnumber  the  hydrogen  ions,  the  pH  climbs  above  7,  and  the
solution is known as basic or alkaline. The pH is commonly accurately measured with an elec-
trode and meter, while field determinations also may use pH paper strips or colorimetric methods.

I-488

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

When the water is very pure and contains little dissolved salts, the value of γH+ approaches
1.0.  The  activity  and  concentration  of  hydrogen  ion  are  essentially  the  same,  so  that  the  pH
definition simplifies to

pH = − log10 H+ . ......................................................... (10.16)

However, in what must seem to be nature’s perversity, produced water from oil reservoirs usu-
ally  contains  large  amounts  of  dissolved  salts.  The  value  of  γH+  is  <  1.0  as  a  result,  so  the
more  simple  form  of  the  pH  definition  is  not  correct.  Careful,  direct  pH  measurement  is  the
best approach for accurate pH determination, although some of the most sophisticated comput-
er  models  give  reasonable predictions at  moderate conditions of  brine  concentration, tempera-
ture, and pressure.

The pH of oilfield waters usually is controlled by the CO2/bicarbonate system. Because the
solubility  of  CO2  is  directly  proportional  to  temperature  and  pressure,  the  pH  measurement
should  be  made  in  the  field  if  a  close-to-natural-conditions  value  is  desired.  The  pH  of  the
water  is  not  very  useful  for  water  identification  or  correlation  purposes,  but  it  does  indicate
possible scale-forming or corrosion tendencies of a particular water. The pH also may indicate
the presence of drilling-mud filtrate or well-treatment chemicals. Organic acids, such as acetic
acid, also can control the pH. The following is a typical reaction.

CO2(g) ⇔ CO2(aq) + H2O ⇔ H2CO3(aq) ⇔ HCO3
CH3COOH ⇔ CH3COO− + H+

− + H+ ⇔ CO3

= + H+

The pH of concentrated brines usually is less than 7.0, and the pH will rise during laborato-
ry  storage,  indicating  that  the  pH  of  the  water  in  the  reservoir  probably  is  appreciably  lower
than many published values. In pure water or brines with little buffering capacity, like seawa-
ter,  the  addition  of  gas  containing  CO2  at  high  pressure  can  depress  the  pH  to  less  than  2.9,
making the water very reactive. This water will dissolve and corrode steel with great rapidity
or, if in the reservoir, will dissolve minerals either wholly or partly. This can lead to formation
damage and dramatically reduce injection and production because the newly dissolved species
reprecipitate as the pressure drops at the producer well.

Addition  of  the  carbonate  ion  to  sodium  chloride  solutions  will  raise  the  pH.  If  enough
calcium  is  present,  calcium  carbonate  precipitates.  The  reason  the  pH  of  most  oilfield  waters
rises during storage in the laboratory is because of the formation of carbonate ions as a result
of bicarbonate decomposition caused by evolution of dissolved CO2 gas. An important consid-
eration of CO2 gas evolution/dissolution is that it is not anything close to instantaneous; a fact
that has been underappreciated by many, with very expensive and confusing consequences.

In  pure  water,  the  CO2  equilibrium  takes  on  the  order  of  tens  of  minutes  (≈20  min.)  to
adjust to a change in CO2 pressure and for the pH to stabilize to a new level. However, with
large  amounts  of  bicarbonate  in  an  oilfield  water,  the  adjustment  is  even  slower,  while  the
buffering action of the bicarbonate itself will limit how much the pH will eventually change.

Organic  acids  play  an  extremely  important  role  in  the  water  chemistry.34  Because  the
volatile  fatty  acids,  such  as  formic,  acetic,  propionic,  and  butyric  acids,  are  quite  commonly
found in the waters, they can control the water chemistry to a large degree, especially the CO2/
bicarbonate  system.  From  a  historical  standpoint,  this  is  important  because  analytical  difficul-
ties prohibited obtaining organic acid compositional data. Thus, much of the confusing behav-
ior  that  workers  observed  in  scale-deposition  predictions  based  on  the  analysis  of  inorganic

Chapter 10—Properties of Produced Water

I-489

species  compared  with  the  actual  field  results  turns  out  to  be  explainable  once  the  organic
acids are considered.

Historically,  the  typical  analytical  procedure  for  bicarbonate,  the  alkalinity  titration,  also
happens to titrate the organic acids because they have Ka values similar to that of bicarbonate.
Thus,  scale  predictions  that  used  those  bicarbonate  values  are  somewhat  incorrect,  with  the
degree of error depending on the amounts of organic acids that were included with the bicar-
bonate  value.  Oilfield  waters  sometimes  will  have  an  unusual  odor,  which  often  comes  from
rather  high  concentrations  of  these  organic  acids.  The  formic,  acetic,  propionic,  and  butyric
acids will not precipitate scale under most conditions, but certainly do buffer the water system
effectively.  Also,  they  seem  to  slow  down  the  approach  to  CO2  equilibrium  as  well,  so  that
water samples containing several hundred ppm of organic acids will not change their pH signif-
icantly when stored for several days. This also means that the dissolved CO2 in the produced
water remains high even after the pressure has been reduced in a separator. It still can remain
corrosive, even though it would not normally be expected to be very corrosive. One procedure
to  correct  the  bicarbonate  analysis  for  the  volatile  fatty  organic  acid  concentration  is  to  mea-
sure  the  organic  acid  content  by  an  independent  technique,  such  as  IC  or  CE,  calculate  the
equivalent amounts of the acids, and then subtract those equivalents from the apparent bicarbon-
ate concentration as measured by the alkalinity titration.

Naphthenic acids can precipitate and form scales, in contrast to the volatile fatty acids. Cal-
cium naphthenate scale deposits have been identified recently in several fields that produce high-
acid-number crude oils; however, the concentration of naphthenic acids in water is limited by
their higher molecular weights and high oil solubility.48

10.13 The Redox Potential
The redox potential (often abbreviated as Eh) may be referred to as oxidation potential, oxidation/
reduction potential, or pE. It is expressed in volts or millivolts (mV), and, at equilibrium, it is
related to the proportions of oxidized and reduced species present. Standard equations of chem-
ical thermodynamics express the relationships.

The  Nernst  equation  expresses  the  relationship  between  concentrations  of  oxidation-reduc-
tion couples. For example, a common redox couple involves the dissolved iron species Fe(II)
and Fe(III), which can be described thermodynamically as

E = Eo − RT/ nF log (Fe+3)/(Fe+2) = Eo − 0.0591T/ n log (Fe+3)/(Fe+2)............. (10.17)

and

ΔG = − nF E, ............................................................ (10.18)

where

E = the voltage of the system vs. the standard hydrogen electrode,
Eo  =  the  voltage  of  the  oxidation  reaction  at  standard  conditions  (1  mole/liter,  298  K,  1

n = the number of electrons transferred in the reaction,
R = the ideal gas constant,
T = temperature, °K, and
F = Faraday’s Constant.
Eh is usually measured with a platinum electrode against a different reference, such as Ag/
AgCl or saturated calomel reference electrodes. Knowledge of the redox potential is useful in
studies of how compounds such as uranium, iron, sulfur, and other minerals are transported in

I-490

aqueous systems. The solubility of some elements and compounds depends on the redox poten-
tial and the pH of their environment.

Some water associated with petroleum is interstitial (connate) water and has a negative Eh,
which has been proved in various field studies. Knowledge of the Eh is useful in determining
how to treat a water before it is reinjected into a subsurface formation. For example, the Eh of
the  water  will  oxidize  if  the  water  is  open  to  the  atmosphere,  but,  if  it  is  kept  in  a  closed
system in an oil-production operation, the Eh should not change appreciably as it is brought to
the surface and reinjected. In such a situation, the Eh value is useful in determining how much
iron will stay in solution and not deposit in the wellbore.

Organisms that consume oxygen lower the Eh. In buried sediments, it is the aerobic bacte-
ria  that  attract  organic  constituents  that  remove  the  free  oxygen  from  the  interstitial  water.
Sediments  laid  down  in  a  shoreline  environment  will  differ  in  degree  of  oxidation  compared
with those laid down in a deepwater environment. For example, the Eh of the shoreline sedi-
ments may range from −50 to 0 mV, but the Eh of deepwater sediments may range from −150
to −l00 mV.

Aerobic  bacteria  die  when  the  free  oxygen  is  totally  consumed;  anaerobic  bacteria  attack
the sulfate ion, which is the second most important anion in the seawater. During this attack,
the  sulfate  reduces  to  sulfide,  the  Eh  drops  to  negative  potentials  (approximately  −600  mV),
and  H2S  is  liberated.  This  process  is  known  as  reservoir  souring  and  is  a  major  concern  to
engineers working on fields undergoing waterflood with injected seawater or other sulfate-con-
taining  injectant.  Most  waterfloods  have  eventually  gone  sour.  Hydrogen  sulfide  generation
causes problems from a health and safety standpoint because it is so poisonous. H2S also caus-
es  rapid,  nearly  instantaneous,  failure  of  steel  because  of  sulfide  stress-corrosion  cracking,
unless  the  steel  has  been  specified  for  “sour  service.”  Besides  the  presence  of  sulfate  ions,
dissolved organic acids play a role in feeding the SRB. Predicting and mitigating reservoir sour-
ing is an active area of research. SRB and other bacteria often cause a different, much slower
type of pitting corrosion on steel, known as microbially induced corrosion (MIC). MIC is com-
monly seen in low-flow piping areas, under deposits of solids or sludges, or in vessels and tanks.

10.14 Dissolved Gases
Large  quantities  of  dissolved  gases  are  contained  in  oilfield  brines.  Most  of  these  gases  are
hydrocarbons; however, other gases such as CO2, N2, and H2S often are present. The solubility
of  the  gases  in  water  generally  decreases  with  increased  water  salinity  and  temperature  and
increases with pressure.

Hundreds  of  drillstem  samples  of  brine  from  water-bearing  subsurface  formations  in  the
U.S.  Gulf  Coast  area  were  analyzed  to  determine  the  amounts  and  kinds  of  hydrocarbons.35
The chief constituent of the dissolved gases usually was methane, with measurable amounts of
ethane,  propane,  and  butane.  The  concentration  of  the  dissolved  hydrocarbons  generally  in-
creased  with  depth  in  a  given  formation  and  increased  basinward  with  regional  and  local
variations. In close proximity to some oilfields, the waters were enriched in dissolved hydrocar-
bons. Up to 14 scf dissolved gas/bbl water was observed in some locations.

10.15 Organic Constituents
In addition to the simple hydrocarbons, many organic constituents in colloidal, ionic, and molec-
ular form occur in oilfield brines.35 Because the analytical problems are difficult and very time
consuming, many organic constituents present in oilfield brines were not determined. In recent
years,  some  of  these  organic  constituents  have  been  measured  quantitatively,  because  better
analytical techniques have been adapted to the difficult produced-water matrix.

Knowledge of the dissolved organic constituents is important because these constituents are
related to the origin and/or migration of an oil accumulation, as well as to the disintegration or
degradation of an accumulation.36 The concentrations of organic constituents in oilfield brines

Chapter 10—Properties of Produced Water

I-491

vary widely. In general, the more alkaline the water is, the more likely it will contain higher
concentrations  of  organic  constituents.  The  bulk  of  the  organic  matter  consists  of  anions  and
salts of organic acids; however, other compounds also are present. Explorationists can use such
data  to  look  for  anomalies  in  these  constituents,  while  environmental  scientists  can  use  it  to
evaluate spills and effluents. The corrosion engineer needs to know how much of the inhibitor
added at the well remains in the produced water so that its corrosion can be controlled. Organic-
scale-inhibitor compounds are monitored routinely to verify that their concentration exceeds the
minimum effective dose.

Knowledge  of  the  concentrations  of  benzene,  toluene,  xylenes,  and  other  components  in
oilfield brines is used in exploration. The solubilities of some of these compounds in water at
ambient conditions and in saline waters at elevated temperatures and pressures have been deter-
mined.37,38

However,  the  actual  concentrations  of  these  and  other  organic  constituents  in  subsurface
oilfield  brines  are  another  matter.  It  has  been  shown  experimentally  that  the  solubilities  of
some organic compounds found in crude oil increase with temperature and pressure if pressure
is  maintained  on  the  system.  The  increased  solubilities  become  significant  above  150°C.  The
solubilities  decrease  with  increasing  water  salinity.  Waters  associated  with  paraffinic  oils  are
likely to contain fatty acids, while those associated with asphaltic oils more likely contain naph-
thenic acids.

Quantitative  recovery  of  organic  constituents  from  oilfield  brines  is  difficult.  Temperature
and pressure changes, bacterial actions, adsorption, and the high inorganic/organic-constituents
ratio in most oilfield brines are some reasons why quantitative recovery is difficult. The effect
of  bacteria  on  the  samples  is  particularly  significant.39  Unless  samples  are  stabilized  with  an
effective dose of biocide, significant or complete depletion of the organic acids is likely before
the sample can be analyzed. Total loss of 300 ppm of acetic acid within 24 hours in an unstabi-
lized produced-water sample was observed, while one containing 200 ppm of biocide suffered
no loss of acetic acid.

10.15.1 Interpretation  of  Chemical  Analyses.    Oilfield  waters  include  all  waters  or  brines
found in oil fields. Such waters have certain distinct chemical characteristics.40,41 Approximate-
ly  70%  of  the  world  petroleum reserves  are  associated with  waters  containing more  than  100
g/L of dissolved solids.42 Water containing dissolved solids in excess of 100 g/L can be classi-
fied as brine. Waters associated with the other 30% of petroleum reserves contain less than 100
g/L of dissolved solids. Some of these waters are almost fresh; however, the presence of fresh-
er waters usually is attributed to invasion after the petroleum accumulated in the reservoir trap.
Examples of some of the low-salinity waters can be found in the Rocky Mountain areas in
Wyoming fields such as Enos Creek, South Sunshine, and Cottonwood Creek.43,44 The Douleb
oil  field  in  Tunisia  is  another  example.  Extremely  fresh  water  was  discovered  in  the  Cano
Limon, Colombia, oil field with only 300 mg/L TDS, mostly sodium bicarbonate and sodium
acetate. The chloride content was only approximately 20 mg/L.

The  composition  of  dissolved  solids  found  in  oilfield  waters  depends  on  several  factors.
Some of these factors are the composition of the water in the depositional environment of the
sedimentary  rock,  subsequent  changes  by  rock/water  interaction  during  sediment  compaction,
changes by rock/water interaction during water migration (if migration occurs), and changes by
mixing  with  other  waters,  including  infiltrating  younger  waters  such  as  meteoric  waters.  The
following are definitions of some types of water.

Meteoric Water.  This is water that recently was involved in atmospheric circulation; further-
more, “the age of meteoric groundwater is slight when compared with the age of the enclosing
rocks and is not more than a small part of a geologic period.”14

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Seawater.  The composition of seawater varies somewhat but, in general, will have a com-
position  relative  to  the  following  (in  mg/L):  chloride—19,375,  bromide—67,  sulfate—2,712,
potassium—387, sodium—10,760, magnesium—1,294, calcium—413, and strontium—8.

Interstitial Water.  Interstitial water is the water contained in the small pores or spaces be-
tween the minute grains or units of rock. Interstitial waters are syngenetic (formed at the same
time as the enclosing rocks) or epigenetic (originated by subsequent infiltration into rocks).

Connate Water.  The  term  “connate”  implies  born,  produced,  or  originated  together  (con-
nascent); therefore, connate water probably should be considered interstitial water of syngenetic
origin.  Connate  water  of  this  definition  is  fossil  water  that  has  been  out  with  the  atmosphere
for  at  least  a  large  part  of  a  geologic  period.  The  implication  that  connate  waters  are  “born
with” the enclosing rocks is an undesirable restriction.14

Diagenetic Water.  Diagenetic waters are those changed chemically and physically, before,
during,  and  after sediment consolidation. Some  of  the  reactions that occur  in  or  to  diagenetic
waters  include  bacteria  change,  replacement  (dolomitization),  infiltration  by  permeation,  and
membrane filtration.

Formation Water.  Formation  water,  as  defined  here,  is  water  that  occurs  naturally  in  the

rocks and is present in them immediately before drilling,

Juvenile Water.  Juvenile water is water derived from primary magma.
Condensate Water.    Water  associated  with  gas  is  carried  as  vapor  to  the  surface  of  the
well,  where  it  condenses  and  precipitates  because  of  temperature  and  pressure  changes.  This
water  occurs  more  often  in  the  winter,  in  colder  climates,  and  in  gas-producing  wells.  This
water  is  easy  to  recognize  because  it  contains  a  relatively  small  amount  of  dissolved  solids,
mostly derived from reactions with chemicals in or on the well casing or tubing or carried as a
mist in high-rate-gas-flow wells.

Water analyses may be used to identify the water source. In the oil field, one of the prime
uses  of  these  analyses  is  to  determine  the  source  of  extraneous  water  in  an  oil  well  so  that
casing can be set and can prevent such water from flooding the oil or gas horizons. In some
wells, a leak may develop in the casing or cement, and water analyses are used to identify the
water-bearing horizon so that the leaking area can be replaced. With the current emphasis on
water pollution prevention, it is very important to locate the source of a brine so that remedial
action can be taken.

Historically, comparisons of water-analysis data are tedious and time consuming; therefore,
graphical  methods  were  mainly  used  for  positive,  rapid  identification.  A  number  of  systems
were developed, all of which have some merit, with the most popular being the Stiff diagram
(Fig. 10.13). The new computer chemistry models mentioned previously have largely displaced
the manual graphics, but the visual comparisons are still useful in certain situations.

10.16 The Mixing-Line Technique
In  situations  in  which  two  different  waters  are  being  mixed,  it  is  desirable  to  measure  the
amounts of each in the mixed stream. Also, if that capability exists, it is desirable to look at
each  constituent  to  see  if  it  undergoes  any  phenomenon  other  than  simple  mixing.  Thus,  this
can  be  a  powerful  technique  for  detecting  water/rock  reactions  that  can  lead  to  formation
damage.45

The  fundamental  concept  is  that  mixing  two  waters  should  result  in  the  volume-weighted
average of each constituent of the two original waters, unless some chemical or biological reac-
tion  occurred.  This  is  essentially  similar  in  appearance  to  a  binary  phase  diagram,  with  the
endpoints  of  the  line  defined  by  the  concentrations  of  the  constituent  in  each  of  the  water
streams  being  mixed.  For  the  technique  to  be  useful,  at  least  one  species  needs  to  be  found
that can act as a tracer for one of the waters. The requirements for this species are that it does
not participate in chemical or other reactions under the conditions of interest; it has a relatively

large  difference  in  concentration  between  the  two  waters;  and  its  analysis  is  easy  and  cheap
with excellent accuracy.

Candidate  species  include  boron,  iodide,  bromide,  and  chloride.  The  boron  species  is  one
that has been valuable in this role for reservoirs in several areas, including the North Sea and
the North Slope of Alaska. Seawater is used as the injection water, with a typical boron con-
tent  of  4.5  mg/L.  Boron  typically  does  not  undergo  any  precipitation,  dissolution,  ion  ex-
change,  adsorption,  or  microbiological  reactions  and  is  stable  in  samples.  Boron  analysis  by
ICP is cheap, fast, accurate, and has detection limits of better than 0.05 mg/L with ≈1% rela-
tive standard deviation. The formation waters have original boron concentrations ranging from
15 to 160 mg/L; thus, boron can serve as a tracer for the formation water.

where

Xfm = the fraction of formation water in the mixed produced water,
[B]pw = the measured boron concentration in the produced water sample,
[B]fm = the boron concentration in the original formation water,
[B]inj = the boron concentration in the injection water,
Wi = the percentage of injection water in the mixed produced water, and
Wf = the percentage of original formation water in the mixed produced water.
With the use of this calculated index for the amount of formation (or injection) water, the
concentrations of each of the species measured in the standard water analysis can be graphed.
The pure formation and injection waters define the two endpoints of the mixing line. The ana-
lytical  data  for  that  species  in  each  of  the  produced  water  samples  are  then  plotted  and
compared with the theoretical mixing line.

10.17 Role of Suspended Solids in Produced Water
Solids are almost always present in an oil, gas, and water-producing stream. Unfortunately, the
solids are usually ignored until the problems caused by the solids become so onerous that ac-
tion is required. In some cases, the reservoir sands are known to be unconsolidated, and sand
control  is  part  of  the  project  development.  However,  even  if  sand  control  is  successful,  fine
solids will still be produced and end up in the produced-water system. If the volume of water
handled  is  small,  the  solids  issues  may  never  be  important.  When  a  lot  of  water  is  present,
problems  such  as  pump  wear,  formation  of  deposits,  injection-well  plugging,  filling  vessels,
corrosion, and oil carryover begin to appear. Water intended to be injected is often specified to
meet certain levels of particulates with a maximum size.

The solids can be produced from the reservoir rock (e.g., clays, quartz) or from hydraulic
fractures (proppant flowback), or it can precipitate from the produced water (e.g., iron sulfide).
Particle  sizes  cover  a  wide  range.  In  the  hydraulic-fracture  case,  the  proppant  size  may  be  1
mm or larger, while iron sulfide precipitate can be < 0.1 μm.

Because the solids are denser than either the oil or the produced water, they tend to sink to
the bottom of the pipes, vessels, or tanks. Systems with low flow rates usually build stagnant
deposits of the solids. A rule of thumb that can be used is < 3 ft/sec for lines that will build
solids deposits. The solids often are coated with oil and become neutrally buoyant in the water
or water/oil interface, so they remain suspended and can travel great distances. Treating chemi-
cals such as corrosion or scale inhibitors or emulsion breakers are surface active, are strongly
attracted to the surfaces of the solids, and act to attract oil, paraffins, asphaltenes, and bacteria,
so  that  the  once-dense  particle  is  now  much  larger  and  less  dense.  They  also  are  sticky  and
agglomerate  easily,  eventually  forming  what  has  been  termed  “schmoo.”46  The  resulting
schmoo  is  an  organic/inorganic  scale  that  effectively  coats  the  surfaces  exposed  to  the  pro-
duced water: piping, vessels, meters, tubing, and injector-well perforations. This heterogeneous
coating has been observed in produced-water piping more than 1 to 3 in. thick around the full
pipe circumference.

Schmoo  deposits  harbor  bacteria  implicated  in  corrosion  of  the  produced-water  system.47
Also,  schmoo  can  plug  injector  wells,  primarily  in  the  perforations  and  formation  face,  al-
though  occasionally  large  quantities  slough  off  the  tubing  and  fill  the  wellbore.  Many  times,
the produced water in the injector-well tubing will build a thick enough layer of schmoo that
wireline tools cannot be run. Oiled tubing-fill cleanouts are effective at removing the schmoo
and  restoring  injectivity.  Soaking  the  system  with  particular  surfactant  formulations  has  been
effective in removing the schmoo deposits, preventing corrosion, and restoring injectivity.

Phase Behavior of H2O + Hydrocarbon Systems
E.D. Sloan, SPE, Center for Hydrate Research, Colorado School of Mines

11.1 Introduction
The phase behavior of H2O + hydrocarbon mixtures differs significantly from the vapor/liquid
equilibria of normal hydrocarbons in two ways: the aqueous and hydrocarbon components usu-
ally separate, with very low mutual solubility; and hydrates often form with water and hydro-
carbons  smaller  than  n-pentane.  Water  generally  is  avoided  because  it  is  incombustible,  and
hydrate solids usually are avoided because their presence creates flow assurance difficulties.

When hydrocarbon contacts water, the two components separate into two phases in which
the mutual component solubility is less than 1.0 mol% at ambient conditions. This splitting of
phases affects almost all treatments of H2O + hydrocarbon systems and is caused by the differ-
ent molecular attractions within water and hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon molecules have a weak,
noncharged  attraction  for  each  other,  while  water  attracts  other  water  molecules  through  a
strong, charged hydrogen bond.

Because  hydrogen  bonds  are  significantly  stronger  than  those  between  hydrocarbon
molecules,  hydrocarbon  solubility  in  water  (and  that  of  water  in  hydrocarbons)  is  very  small.
Hydrogen bonds are responsible for most of the unusual properties water displays. One exam-
ple is water’s very high heat of vaporization, which absorbs large amounts of heat and buffers
many  hydrocarbon  reservoir  temperatures.  Another  example  is  the  very  high  normal  boiling
point water has relative to its molecular weight.

This  chapter discusses  H2O  +  hydrocarbon  phase  equilibria in  macroscopic terms,  such  as
temperature, pressure, concentration, and phase diagrams—more easily applied by the engineer
—because a quantitative molecular prediction of H2O + hydrocarbon phase behavior is beyond
the current state of the art. Quantitative predictions of macroscopic phase behavior are illustrat-
ed  by  example,  along  with  a  few  results  from  hand  calculations,  though  the  many  excellent
commercial phase equilibria computer programs now available largely have eliminated the need
for the hand calculations. This chapter also explains qualitative trends, to help the engineer to
understand the implications of temperature, pressure, and composition changes. Such a qualita-
tive  understanding  and  a  few  hand  calculation  methods  serve  as  an  initial  check  on  the
quantitative predictions of computer programs.

This chapter is divided into three main sections. The first section covers phase definitions
and the Gibbs1 phase rule, which are used to define the problem. Only the two most common

I-500

concerns are treated in this section; for a rigorous discussion of H2O + hydrocarbon phase dia-
grams, see Harmens and Sloan.2 The second section goes on to cover the simplest case—that
of an H2O + hydrocarbon mixture when all phases are fluid, as vapor and/or liquid, and with-
out  hydrate  formation.  This  H2O  +  hydrocarbon  equilibrium  without  hydrates  exists  at  high
temperature  or  low  pressure  or  when  only  large  (greater  in  size  than  n-pentane)  hydrocarbon
components are present.

Because  of  the  importance  of  hydrates  in  H2O  +  hydrocarbon  equilibria,  however,  the
largest  and  third  section  of  this  chapter  deals  with  systems  containing  small  hydrocarbon
molecules (<9Å) that form hydrates with water. This is an important section—hydrates are the
most  common  solid-phase  problem  in  flow  assurance.  They  are  solid  crystalline  compounds
that typically plug flow channels, valves, drillstrings, blowout preventers, etc.; therefore, hydrate-
formation  regions  normally  are  avoided.  A  chapter  on  emerging  technologies  related  to  flow
assurance and hydrates is in the Emerging and Peripheral Technologies section of this Handbook.

11.2 Phase Definitions and the Gibbs Phase Rule
Phases  are  homogeneous  regions  of  matter—gas,  liquid,  or  solid—that  can  be  analyzed  using
common  tools  such  as  pressure  gauges,  thermocouples,  and  chromatographs.  In  this  chapter,
phases are distinct homogeneous regions larger than 100 μm. The shorthand used here for the
various phases are:

• HC = hydrocarbon, typically with a very low (<1%) water concentration.
• I = pure ice.
• L = liquid that is either water (LW) or hydrocarbon (LHC).
• V = vapor that is always a single phase, never splitting.
• W = liquid water, usually of high (>99%) purity, except where indicated.
• H = hydrate or solid.
The  order  of  phase  listing  is  by  decreasing  water  concentration.  For  example,  the  listing
order  LW  >  H  >  V  >  LHC  means  that  hydrates  (H)  contain  less  water  than  the  liquid  water
phase  (LW),  but  more  water  than  vapor  (V),  which  in  turn  contains  more  water  than  liquid
hydrocarbon (LHC).

The  Gibbs1  phase  rule  for  nonreacting  systems  provides  the  most  convenient  method  for
determining how many intensive variables are important in phase equilibria. The Gibbs phase
rule states:

F = C − P + 2, ............................................................ (11.1)

where F = number of intensive variables (e.g., pressure, temperature, single phase composition)
required to define the system (known as the degrees of freedom); C = number of components;
and P = number of phases.

For  example,  when  excess  gas  (excess  so  that  its  composition  does  not  change)  contacts
water to form hydrates, there are three phases (P = 3, namely LW + H + V) and two compo-
nents  (C  =  2,  namely  water  and  a  gas  of  constant  composition),  so  that  F  =  1;  only  one
intensive variable (either pressure, temperature, or one phase composition) is needed to define
the system. If this system is uniquely specified at a given pressure, for example, the identical
temperature, and same individual phase compositions always will occur for the initial compo-
nents  at  that  pressure,  when  three  phases  are  present.  This  system  definition  assures  the
engineer  of  uniqueness,  so  that  the  identical  equilibrium  phase  behavior  will  be  achieved.  If
gas  also  condenses  (P  =  4,  with  the  addition  of  LHC),  however,  or  the  gas  quantity  is  small
enough to change composition (such that C > 2), then the F = 1 restriction no longer holds.

As a second example, consider again the case of a constant composition hydrocarbon vapor
in equilibrium with water, so that C = 2. With two phases (V + LW), by the Gibbs phase rule
the degrees of freedom are two (F = 2), so that for this example, both temperature and pres-

sure  are  needed  to  determine  the  water  composition  in  the  hydrocarbon  at  conditions  under
which  the  two  phases  coexist.  In  contrast  to  the  single  variable  required  for  three-phase  sys-
tems in the above paragraph, with this case of two phases and two components, the saturated
water  concentration  in  the  hydrocarbon  (or  water  dewpoint)  is  determined  by  two  variables.
The water content in a hydrocarbon vapor is correlated with temperature and pressure in Sec.
11.3.1  below.  Identical  restrictions  apply  to  the  hydrocarbon  content  in  the  water  phase,  also
considered briefly in Sec. 11.3.1.

The same restriction of F = 2 applies when a constant composition liquid hydrocarbon ex-
ists  in  equilibrium  with  liquid  water.  However,  because  both  phases  (LW  +  LHC)  are  dense,
very large pressure changes are required to influence the water content of the hydrocarbon. In
general,  when  condensed  phases  coexist,  temperature  and  concentrations  have  a  much  greater
influence than does pressure. With liquid hydrocarbon and water, the temperature controls the
mutual solubility (i.e., the concentration of the water in the hydrocarbon liquid, as well as the
concentration of the hydrocarbon in the liquid water). The mutual solubility of water and liquid
hydrocarbons is correlated with temperature in Sec. 11.3.2 below.

The Gibbs phase rule is discussed further in Chap. 7 of the General Engineering section of

this Handbook.

11.3 Equilibrium of H2O + Hydrocarbon Systems Without Hydrates
This section considers two equilibrium conditions. First, it investigates the point at which, at a
given temperature and pressure, water becomes saturated in either hydrocarbon vapors or hydro-
carbon  liquids  and  forms  a  separate  fluid  phase.  Second,  it  considers  the  point  at  which
hydrocarbon becomes saturated in liquid water and forms a separate hydrocarbon phase. Thus,
both  water  and  hydrocarbon  dewpoints  are  represented  as  the  maximum  solubility  of  each
phase in the other.

The  discussion  in  this  section  assumes  that  hydrates  will  not  form;  prevention  of  hydrate
formation requires a high temperature, a low pressure, or that all hydrocarbons be larger than n-
pentane (9Å). Prediction of hydrate formation is covered in Sec. 11.4 of this chapter, whereas
the discussion of nonhydrate-forming systems in this section provides a basis for understanding
the subsequent equilibria of hydrocarbons and water.

11.3.1 Water  Solubility  (Dewpoint)  in  a  Hydrocarbon  Gas.    The  chart  by  McKetta  and
Wehe3  (Fig.  11.1)  acceptably  correlates  the  water  content  of  hydrocarbon  gases  as  a  function
of temperature and pressure. Because F = 2, two intensive variables are needed to specify the
system. At a given temperature and pressure, the user can determine the saturated water con-
tent of gases, the point at which a liquid water phase will precipitate. For this reason Fig. 11.1.
frequently is called the water dewpoint chart. Before using Fig. 11.1, however, note that:

• Water content is given in H2O lbm/MMscf of gas at 60°F and 1 atm.
• Remarkably, the chart can be used for any hydrocarbon gas or gas mixture, regardless of
gas composition. However, the water content should be multiplied by a slight correction factor
for  gas  gravity  (gas  gravity  =  gas  molecular  weight  divided  by  air  molecular  weight).  Larger
correction factors are required for sour (H2S + CO2) gases.

• To  construct  the  chart,  data  from  several  investigators  were  measured  at  high  (>50  lbm/
MMscf)  water  contents  and  extrapolated  (as  ln  water  content  vs.  temperature)  along  isobaric
lines of constant pressure to lower water content.

• While  the  semilogarithmic  plot  adequately  correlates  data  for  gases  at  higher  water  con-
tents, the correlation cannot be extrapolated to lower water content (<20 lbm/MMscf) because
the lines bend sharply downward at the hydrate formation temperature and pressure.

• Dashed lines in Fig. 11.1 represent metastable equilibrium of water in the vapor, giving a
metastable water content that is higher than the equilibrium water content of gas in equilibrium
with hydrates, the stable condensed phase at lower temperatures.

• Fig.  11.1  should  not  be  used  for  low  water  concentrations;  instead,  use  a  computer  pro-

gram, as indicated in Sec. 11.4.2 below.

Despite  its  limitations,  Fig.  11.1  is  very  useful  and  provides  a  check  against  high  water

content values calculated by commercial phase equilibria computer programs.

No similar measurements and charts are available for determining the hydrocarbon content
in water vapor, with a separate liquid hydrocarbon phase. To approximate this at low pressures,
an engineer may use the rule of thumb that hydrocarbon liquid will condense when the hydro-
carbon partial pressure equals its vapor pressure. This calculation rarely is performed, however,
because  water’s  hydrogen  bonds  cause  water  vapor  pressure  to  be  lower  than  that  of  many
hydrocarbons. At temperatures below 100°C, only alkanes with carbon numbers above seven (n-
C8H18

+) have lower vapor pressures than water, because of water’s strong hydrogen bonds.

For this reason, it is much more common for water to precipitate from a hydrocarbon vapor
in gas/petroleum operations than it is for hydrocarbon to precipitate from a low-pressure water
vapor.  Therefore,  Fig.  11.1  is  most  practical  for  determining  water  solubility  in  hydrocarbon
vapor.

11.3.2 Mutual Solubility of Liquid Water and Liquid Hydrocarbons.  Tsonopoulos4,5 correlat-
ed  mutual  liquid  solubility  of  liquid  water  and  well-defined  liquid  hydrocarbons  (normal
alkanes,  1-alkenes,  alkylcyclohexanes,  and  alkylbenzenes)  for  molecules  that  are  too  large
(>9Å) to form hydrates. Solubilities in more general liquids (e.g., petroleum fractions) are not
in the open literature and can be approximated using well-defined hydrocarbon fluid solubilities
or their mixtures. The correlations for such fluids are given in four parts in this section:

• Solubility of hydrocarbons in liquid water at 298 K.
• Solubility of hydrocarbons in liquid water as a function of temperature.
• Solubility of water in liquid hydrocarbons at 298 K.
• Solubility of water in liquid hydrocarbons as a function of temperature.
Pressure does not significantly affect the mutual solubilities of liquids.
Solubility  of  Hydrocarbon  in  Liquid  Water  at  298  K.  Because  of  dissimilarity  in  bonds
between water and hydrocarbon, the mole fraction of well-defined hydrocarbon in water at 298
K always is very small, ranging from a high of 5 × 10–4 for alkylbenzenes with a carbon num-
ber of 6 (Nc = 6), to a low of 2 × 10–9 for nonane, a normal alkane. Even with these low water
concentrations,  at  the  same  carbon  number,  the  hydrocarbon  in  water  concentrations  decrease
in  the  order  of  alkylbenzenes  >  alkylcyclohexanes  >  linear  1-alkenes  >  normal  alkanes,  as
shown  in  Fig.  11.2.  For  a  given  chemical  type,  larger  molecules  always  are  less  soluble  in
water than are smaller molecules.

The correlation for the mole fraction of hydrocarbons in water (xHC-W) at 298 K is:

ln xHC − W = a + bNc + c
Nc

, .................................................. (11.2)

where Nc = the carbon number, and a, b, and c = constants as given in Table 11.1. For normal
alkanes, the correlation does not fit well after Nc = 11.

Solubility of Hydrocarbon in Liquid Water as a Function of Temperature. Liquid hydro-
carbon solubility in water generally increases with temperature; however, there appears to be a
minimum in solubility that ranges from 291 K for alkylbenzenes to 303 K for alkanes. As the
temperature  moves  below  these  minimum  values,  the  hydrocarbon  concentration  in  water  in-
creases.

These  solubilities  change  enough  that  the  temperature  effects  for  each  compound  must  be
treated individually. The hydrocarbon mole fraction for hydrocarbon liquids (xHC-W) in water, as
a function of temperature (T) in K, is well-described by the correlation:

individual 1-alkenes, alkylcyclohexanes, and alkylbenzenes, see Tsonopoulos.5

Solubility of Water in Liquid Hydrocarbons at 298 K. The solubility of water in hydrocar-
bon  liquids  at  298  K,  like  that  of  hydrocarbons  in  liquid  water,  is  small,  ranging  from  3.2  ×
10–4 for ethane to 3 × 10–3 for alkylbenzenes (Nc = 6), as shown in Fig. 11.3. The solubility of
water in liquid hydrocarbons decreases in the following order for the same Nc: alkylbenzenes >
linear 1-alkenes > normal alkanes > alkylcyclohexanes.

Solubility  of  Water  in  Liquid  Hydrocarbons  as  a  Function  of  Temperature.  Unlike  the
three above solubility correlations, the solubility of water in hydrocarbons increases dramatical-
ly with temperature. At high temperatures (>500 K) the solubility of water in hydrocarbons can
exceed 0.1 mole fraction, and may not be negligible, as with some of the above concentrations.
These  solubilities  change  so  dramatically  that  the  temperature  solubility  of  each  compound
must be treated individually. The correlation of the mole fraction of water in liquid hydrocar-
bons as a function of temperature (K) is:

ln xW − HC = a + b

where a and b = constants as given in Table 11.4 for normal alkanes, as well as the heat of

liquid water. Consult Tsonopoulos5 for constants and ranges for individual 1-alkenes, alkylcy-
clohexanes, and alkylbenzenes.

11.4 Equilibrium of an H2O + Hydrocarbon System With Hydrates
For  systems  containing  both  water  and  small  (<9Å)  hydrocarbons,  hydrates  are  an  important
part of the phase diagram. This section addresses phase equilibria with hydrates, and is divided
into  two  subsections:  hydrate  structures,  stability,  and  measurements  (Sec.  11.4.1);  and  phase
equilibria and calculations involving hydrates (Sec. 11.4.2). A discussion of hydrates relative to
such issues as safety, flowline blockage, gas storage, seafloor stability, and energy recovery is
offered in the Emerging and Peripheral Technologies section of this Handbook.

11.4.1 Hydrate  Structures,  Stability,  and  Measurements.    On  a  molecular  scale,  hydrates
form when single, small guest molecules are encaged (enclathrated) by hydrogen-bonded water
cages, which then combine as solid unit crystals in these nonstoichiometric hydrates. Hydrocar-
bon guest repulsions prop open different sizes of water cages, which combine to form the three
well-defined unit crystal structures shown in Fig. 11.4. Cubic structure I (sI), with small (4.0

to  5.5  Å)  guests,  predominates  in  natural  environments.  Cubic  structure  II  (sII)  generally  has
larger (6.0 to 7.0 Å) guests and mostly occurs in man-made environments. Hexagonal structure
H  (sH)  may  occur  in  either environment, but  only  with  mixtures of  small (4.0  to  5.5  Å)  and
the very large (8.0 to 9.0 Å) molecules. The smallest hydrated molecules (Ar, Kr, O2, and N2),
with diameters of less than 4.0 Å, form sII; still smaller molecules cannot be enclathrated ex-
cept at extreme pressures.

These three common hydrate structures each have large and small cavities. In all three struc-
tures,  the  small  cavity  is  similar  and  is  called  a  512  cavity  because  it  contains  12  pentagonal
faces composed of water molecules. In structure I, however, the large 51262 cavity has 12 pen-
tagonal faces and two hexagonal faces and is somewhat smaller than the large 51264 cavity in
structure II, which has four hexagonal faces and is large enough to contain molecules as large
as n-butane. Structure H has the largest cavity—a 51268 that can hold molecules as large as 9.0
Å—as well as three 512 cavities and two unusual 435663 cavities with three square faces. Table
11.5 shows properties of these three common unit crystals.

I-508

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Remarkably, when all hydrate cavities are filled, the three crystal types have similar compo-
nent concentrations: 85 mol% water and 15 mol% guest(s). This makes hydrate formation most
probable at the interface between the bulk guest and aqueous phases because hydrate compo-
nent concentrations exceed the mutual water/hydrocarbon solubilities. The solid hydrate film at
the interface acts as a barrier against further contact of the bulk fluid phases, and fluid surface
renewal is required for continued hydrate formation. The gas concentration in hydrates is com-
parable to that of a highly compressed gas (e.g., methane at 273 K and 17 MPa).

In addition to the three crystal structures in Fig. 11.4 and Table 11.5, a fourth8 and a fifth*
hydrate  structure  recently  were  found.  These  two  new  structures  are  omitted  from  this
overview because hydrocarbons have yet to be found in them, but their discovery points to the
probability  that  more  hydrate  structures  exist.  Accurate  stability  predictions  rely  on  accurate
knowledge of the phases present, but for now, an accurate answer to the question of how many
hydrate structures exist is unavailable. Currently, one must manage with the rule of thumb that
three structures are common with hydrocarbons.

Hydrate  stability  conditions,  which  depend  on  hydrate  structure,  usually  are  measured  in
terms  of  dissociation  because  there  is  much  less  metastability  on  dissociation  than  on  forma-
tion,  when  the  two  disordered  phases  of  gas  and  water  must  organize  themselves  to  hydrate.
Hydrate dissociation typically is detected at low pressures (<70 MPa) by visual crystal disap-
pearance  and  at  higher  pressures  by  measuring  the  gas  phase  pressure  increase  (because  of
high  gas  concentration  in  the  hydrate  phase)  or  liquid  phase  temperature  decrease  or  salinity
decrease (because of the endothermic heat of dissociation or hydrate phase water intake).

Because  there  are  several  hydrate  structures,  however,  measuring  every  phase  except  the
hydrate  phase  can  introduce  large  data  errors.  For  example,  recently  it  was  proven9  that  mix-
tures  of  methane  and  ethane  (each  an  sI  former  as  a  pure  guest)  form  sII  at  methane  gas
concentrations ranging from 77 to 99.4% at deep-sea temperature (277 K). This finding means
that  more  than  50%  of  the  methane  +  ethane  hydrate  data  measured  since  1934  incorrectly
assumed the sI hydrate structure for this most common hydrocarbon binary mixture.

Three experimental tools are used for nondestructive hydrate phase measurements: diffrac-
tion tools, such as X-ray or neutron,10 Raman spectroscopy,11 and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy.12 Without hydrate phase measurement, one must assume the hydrate struc-
ture  and  properties  are  predicted  acceptably  by  a  mathematical  model.  This  can  lead  to
inaccuracies, as shown in the above case of the methane + ethane system.

11.4.2 Phase Equilibria and Calculations Involving Hydrates.  There are four types of H2O +
hydrocarbon  equilibrium  that  include  hydrates,  as  indicated  in  the  pressure/temperature  (P/T)
diagrams. These equilibria types are:

• Gases, such as CH4 or N2, that exist only as vapor for conditions of interest (Fig. 11.5a).
• Gas + single condensate + water systems (e.g., H2O + C2H6, C3H8, or i-C4H10) in which

the hydrocarbon may be vapor or liquid (Fig. 11.5b).

• Systems with gas + mixed oil/condensate + water (Fig. 11.5c).
• Systems with inhibitors (Fig. 11.5d).
Pressure/temperature diagrams for each of the above system types are discussed in the next
four sections of 11.4.2. The section following those presents hand calculation methods for esti-
mating hydrate equilibria.

provides phase behavior understanding for gas systems without a liquid hydrocarbon phase.

enough that it neither changes composition nor condenses, in which case the vapor composition
is constant (Cv = 1). If water forms a condensed phase, however, which it frequently does, then
the system is below the water dewpoint, but above the hydrocarbon dewpoint.

phases). To obtain nearly straight lines, semilogarithmic plots [ln pressure (p) vs. absolute tem-
perature (Ta)] are used.

Consider the quadruple point (Q1) in Fig. 11.5a, where four phases (I-LW-H-V) coexist. The
Q1  temperature  is  close  to  273  K  for  all  hydrate  formers,  yet  the  quadruple  pressures  vary
widely  (e.g.,  0.0113  MPa  for  i-C4H10,  2.56  MPa  for  CH4,  and  14.3  MPa  for  N2).  Q1  is  the
starting point for four 3-phase lines:

• The LW-H-V line, which has P/T conditions at which water and vapor form hydrates, con-

ditions of most interest in natural gas hydrate systems.

• The I-H-V line, which terminates at about 273 K and has a lower slope than the LW-H-V
line.  Industrially,  the  region  below  273  K  is  avoided,  if  possible,  because  of  flow  assurance
problems stemming from either ice or hydrate formation.

• The  I-LW-H  line,  which  rises  vertically  from  Q1,  with  very  large  pressure  changes  for

small temperature changes, typical of incompressible phases.

• The  I-LW-V  line,  which  connects  Q1  to  the  pure  water  triple  point  (I-LW-V)  (273.16  K,
0.62 kPa) and denotes the transition between water and ice without hydrate formation. Because
Q1  is  close  to  273  K  for  all  natural  gas  systems,  the  I-LW-V  line  extends  almost  vertically
below Q1 to 0.62 kPa.

Eq. 11.6 and Table 11.6 enable prediction of the most common regions of interest for sim-
ple  natural  gas  components—the  pressure  and  temperature  conditions  for  both  LW-H-V  and
I-H-V.

p = exp(a + b

T), .......................................................... (11.6)

where p = pressure, in kPa; a and b = constants; and T = temperature, in K, as shown in Table
11.6.

I-514

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

When using Eq. 11.6, carefully note the temperature limits. It would be a mistake, for ex-
ample, to extend the prediction of the LW-H-V region beyond the temperature of either Q1 or
Q2 (given in Table 11.7), where LW-H-V cannot exist.

The pressures and temperatures in Fig. 11.5a are of interest in natural gas systems for the

following reasons:

• The  pressures  and  temperatures  of  the  LW-H-V  and  the  I-H-V  lines  mark  the  limits  of
hydrate formation. Hydrates cannot form to the right of either line, but will form to the left of
both.  Because  both  ice  and  hydrates  cause  flow  problems,  a  gas  pipeline  rule  of  thumb  is  to
keep the system temperature above the ice point and to the right of the LW-H-V line.

• The LW-H-V line has no upper pressure or temperature limit because the methane (or ni-
trogen)  vapor/liquid  critical  points  (191  and  126  K,  respectively)  are  far  below  Q1.  Such  low
critical temperatures prevent intersection of the vapor pressure line with the LW-H-V line above
273 K, and so prevent the forming of an upper quadruple point. Similarly, a gas at conditions
above its dewpoint will not have an upper point where the liquid phase occurs, and the LW-H-
V line will continue to much higher temperatures and pressures.

• No upper pressure limit to the I-LW-H line is known. Note that these phases all are nearly
incompressible, so that only a small temperature change is required to cause a very large pres-
sure change.

• The  areas  between  the  three-phase  lines  represent  the  two-phase  region  held  in  common
with the bounding three-phase lines. For instance, the area between LW-H-V and I-H-V is the H-
V  region,  in  which  hydrates  are  in  equilibrium  only  with  water-saturated  hydrocarbon  vapor.
Similarly, the LW-H two-phase region exists between LW-H-V and I-LW-H lines, and the I-H two-
phase  region  exists  between  the  I-LW-H  and  I-H-V  lines.  The  two-phase  regions  overlap,  so
that  at  some  P/T  conditions  there  are  two  2-phase  regions  that  differ  in  water  composition.
This seeming paradox is resolved by the fact that the three-phase lines all are not in the plane
of the page, but rather have been compressed from 3D (P/T/composition) into 2D (P/T).

• The diagram schematic is the same for sI hydrate systems (CH4 + H2O) and sII formers
(N2 + H2O), as well as for those of fixed natural gas mixture compositions without an LHC phase.
Gas + Pure Condensate + Water Systems (e.g., H2O + C2H6, C3H8, or i-C4H10).  Fig. 11.5b is
slightly more complex than Fig. 11.5a, for systems such as ethane + water, propane + water,
isobutane + water, or water + either carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide, two common noncom-
bustibles. If the hydrocarbon phases are maintained at the same, constant composition in both
vapor  and  liquid  phases,  these  systems  can  represent  multicomponent  gas  and  oil/condensate
systems.

Chapter 11—Phase Behavior of H2O + Hydrocarbon Systems

I-515

The systems differ from those in Fig. 11.5a in that they have an additional three-phase (LW-
V-LHC) line at the upper right area of the diagram. This line is very close to the vapor pressure
(V-LHC)  line  of  the  pure  hydrocarbon,  because  the  presence  of  the  nearly  pure  water  phase
adds a very low vapor pressure to the system. In this system, each liquid phase, LHC and LW,
exerts its vapor pressure.

Fig.  11.5b  shows  that  where  the  LW-V-LHC  line  intersects  the  LW-H-V  line  is  a  second
quadruple  point  (Q2),  with  phases  LW-H-V-LHC.  Table  11.7  shows  measured  upper  quadruple
points for simple natural gas components. Q2 is the origin for two additional 3-phase lines: a
vertical LW-H-LHC line that is very incompressible and an H-V-LHC line (of less concern).

For systems with an upper quadruple point, the hydrate region is bounded by line I-H-V at
conditions below Q1, by line LW-H-V at conditions between Q1 and Q2, and by line LW-H-LHC
at  conditions  above  Q2.  Hydrates  will  form  at  temperatures  and  pressures  to  the  left  of  the
region enclosed by the three lines, whereas to the right of this region, hydrates are not possi-
ble. Upper quadruple point Q2 often is approximated as the maximum temperature of hydrate
formation because line LW-H-LHC is approximately vertical because of the incompressibility of
those three phases.

To  a  good  approximation,  P/T  conditions  for  LW-H-V  of  the  pure  components  in  Table
11.7  lie  on  a  straight  line  between  Q1  and  Q2,  on  a  semilogarithmic  plot  (ln  p  vs.  1/Ta).  As
discussed  below  in  the  Hand  Calculations  of  Hydrate  Formation  Conditions  section,  there  is
no simple way to expand the above pure lines into that for a mixture, though there are several
ways to hand-calculate LW-H-V conditions (P/T) for mixed hydrocarbon hydrate formers.

In  Fig.  11.5b,  the  areas  between  the  three-phase  lines  represent  two-phase  regions  held  in
common with the three-phase lines. The P/T area bounded by three 3-phase lines (LW-H-V, LW-
H-LHC, and I-LW-H) is the LW-H region, in which hydrates are in equilibrium only with liquid
water. Similarly, the H-V region is between the three 3-phase lines (H-V-LHC, LW-H-V, and I-H-
V). Finally, the H-LHC two-phase region exists between LW-H-LHC and H-V-LHC lines, and the
I-H two-phase region exists between the I-LW-H and I-H-V lines.

Note that the last paragraph contains three 2-phase regions (H-V, H-LHC, and I-H) for hy-
drate  equilibrium  with  phases  that  are  not  liquid  water.  It  is  a  common  misconception  that
hydrates  cannot  form  without  a  liquid  water  phase,  yet  this  clearly  is  possible  according  to
these  diagrams.  Professor  Kobayashi’s  laboratory  at  Rice  U.  has  measured  hydrate  equilibria
without  a  free-water  phase  for  more  than  a  quarter  century,14  so  there  is  no  thermodynamic
prohibition to hydrate formation without a free-water phase. However, the kinetics of such hy-
drate formation are extremely slow, so that in man-made systems and time scales, it may not
be practical to consider hydrate formation without a free-water phase.

Pressure/Temperature Diagrams for Gas + Oil/Condensate Systems.  For natural gases with-
out  a  liquid  hydrocarbon,  the  P/T  phase  diagram  is  similar  to  that  shown  in  Fig.  11.5a.  The
few changes would be that the LW-H-V line would be for a fixed composition mixture of hydro-
carbons rather than for pure methane; that Q1 would be at the intersection of the LW-H-V line
and 273 K, at a pressure lower than that for methane; and that the other three-phase lines (for I-
LW-H  and  I-H-V)  would  have  nearly  the  same  slope  at  Q1,  but  Q1  would  be  at  a  lower
pressure than for methane. Otherwise, the same points in Sec. 11.4.1 apply.

For natural gases that contain oils or mixed condensates, however, the upper portion of the
diagram is more like that in Fig. 11.5b. A straight line labeled LW-H-V represents the hydrate
formation region that is equivalent to the region between Q1 (I-LW-H-V) and Q2 (LW-H-V-LHC)
in Fig. 11.5b.

A second significant change is that point Q2 becomes a quadruple line. When a liquid hy-
drocarbon mixture is present, the LW-V-LHC line, to the right of Q2 in Fig. 11.5b, broadens to
become an area, such as that labeled CFK in Fig. 11.5c. This area develops because a single
hydrocarbon is no longer present, so that a combination of hydrocarbon and water vapor pres-

I-516

sures  creates  a  broader  phase-equilibria  envelope.  Consequently,  Q2  evolves  into  a  line  KC
between Q2L and Q2U for the multicomponent hydrocarbon system.

Line KC might not be straight in the four-phase region, though it is drawn as such here for
illustration  purposes.  The  lower  point,  K’s  location,  is  determined  by  the  point  at  which  the
phase envelope ECFKL intersects the LW-H-V line. To determine the upper point C, calculate
the vapor/liquid equilibrium, assuming that the liquid phase (exiting the envelope at point C) is
the  vapor  composition  at  point  K.  The  resulting  equilibrium  (bubblepoint)  vapor  is  plugged
into a vapor/liquid water/hydrate calculation to find the upper intersection with the phase enve-
lope ECFKL.

Pressure/Temperature  Diagrams  for  Systems  With  Inhibitors.    The  presence  of  inhibitors
causes  a  change  in  the  P/T  diagram,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  11.5d.  For  simplicity,  the  diagram
shows  only  the  hydrate  bounding  region  (to  the  left  of  line  AQ1Q2B)  for  an  uninhibited  pure
component system with upper and lower quadruple points (Q1 and Q2). Line AQ1Q2B in Fig.
11.5d is equivalent to line AQ1Q2B in Fig. 11.5b, with three slopes that change at the quadru-
ple points.

In  Fig.  11.5d,  the  presence  of  an  inhibitor  [e.g.,  methanol  (MeOH)]  shifts  the  upper  two-
thirds  of  the  line  Q1Q2B  to  the  left,  approximately  parallel  to  the  uninhibited  line  on  a
semilogarithmic plot (ln p vs. Ta). With an inhibitor however, the transition temperature from
water to ice (Q1) is decreased, so that the inhibited LW-H-V line intersects the I-H-V at a lower
point (labeled Q1 for 10 wt% methanol and Q1 for 20 wt% methanol). The three inhibited par-
allel lines represent LW-H-V and LW-H-LHC equilibria at 0, 10, and 20 wt% methanol concentra-
tions in the free-water phase.

Each line in Fig. 11.5d bounds hydrate formation conditions listed with a methanol concen-
tration in the free-water phase. To the left of each line, hydrates will form with a water phase
of the given methanol composition; to the right of each line, hydrates will not form. For exam-
ple, when the free-water phase has 10% methanol, hydrates will not form at P/T conditions to
the right of the line marked 10% MeOH. Yet, if no methanol were present, the hydrates would
form at pressures and temperatures between the two lines marked 10% and 0% MeOH. Similar-
ly, more than 20% methanol would be required to prevent hydrate formation to the left of the
line marked 20% MeOH.

For  clarity,  Fig.  11.5d  has  omitted  the  lines  analogous  to  the  three  3-phase  lines  in  Fig.
11.5b  (I-LW-H,  which  would  intersect  Fig.  11.5d’s  AQ1Q2B  at  Q1,  and  LW-V-LHC  and  H-V-
LHC, which would intersect it at Q2). Such lines are less important for hydrate formation, but
join  the  diagram  at  the  appropriate,  shifted  quadruple  points.  For  systems  without  an  upper
quadruple  point  (as  in  Fig.  11.5a)  and  systems  with  a  liquid  hydrocarbon  region  (as  in  Fig.
11.5c),  the  hydrate  boundary  region  similarly  is  shifted  to  the  left  of  (and  is  approximately
parallel to) the uninhibited phase lines.

Other inhibitors, such as monoethylene glycol (MEG) and salts, shift the hydrate lines simi-
larly to the left, but to a different degree. However, methanol is the most economical inhibitor
on a weight basis. Note that all inhibited LW-H-V lines are parallel to the pure water LW-H-V
line;  that  is,  the  hydrate  temperature  depression  (∆T)  is  constant,  regardless  of  pressure.  To
estimate ∆T for several inhibitors in the aqueous liquid, the natural gas industry uses the origi-
nal Hammerschmidt15 expression:

ΔT =

2,335W

100M − MW , ........................................................ (11.7)

where ΔT = hydrate temperature depression from the equilibrium temperature at a given pres-
sure,  °F);  M  =  molecular  weight  of  the  inhibitor;  and  W  =  wt%  of  the  inhibitor  in  the  free-
water phase.

Chapter 11—Phase Behavior of H2O + Hydrocarbon Systems

I-517

With the above equation, the engineer can determine how much inhibitor should be added
to the free-water phase to bring the LW-H-V line below the lowest operating temperature of the
system.  Before  the  Hammerschmidt  equation  can  be  used,  however,  one  must  determine  the
equilibrium temperature Teq that is to be depressed by the inhibitor. The Hand Calculations of
Hydrate  Formation  Conditions  section  below  covers  determination  of  Teq  and  provides  a
method  to  estimate  the  total  amount  of  inhibitor  to  inject,  including  not  only  the  inhibitor
amount in the aqueous liquid as calculated here by the Hammerschmidt equation, but also the
amount in the vapor and liquid hydrocarbon.

Hand Calculations of Hydrate Formation Conditions.  The most accurate predictions of hy-
drate  formation  conditions  are  made  using  commercial  phase  equilibria  computer  programs
such  as  ASPEN,  HYSYS,  Multiflash,  Process  II,and  PVTsim.*  These  programs  are  of  two
types:  those  which  enable  the  prediction  of  the  pressure  and  temperature  at  which  hydrates
begin  to  form  (incipient  hydrate  formation  programs),  and  those  which  predict  all  phases  and
amounts at higher pressures and lower temperatures than the incipient hydrate formation point
(flash programs, or Gibbs energy minimization programs).

Of these two program types, the flash/Gibbs type is gaining pre-eminence because its pre-
dictions are available in the phase diagram interior (where many systems operate), whereas the
incipient type provides the P/T points of hydrate initiation. At present, state-of-the-art programs
are transitioning to the flash/Gibbs free-energy type.

The basis for both program types is a hydrate equation-of-state (EOS). A clear, prescriptive
method for constructing the hydrate flash program has recently been published.16 The hydrate
flash  program  usually  is  so  complex  as  to  require  two  or  more  man-years  of  single-minded
effort to construct a robust version of the program. For this reason and because of readily avail-
able  commercial  programs,  engineers  usually  elect  to  use  those  rather  than  construct  another
program. (For more details about the hydrate EOS, however, see Chap. 5 of Sloan.7)

When  gathering  critical  prediction  results  for  a  design,  however,  it  is  important  to  check
the program results by hand to determine whether the program has made an unusual prediction.
This section offers some hand-calculation techniques for this type of evaluation.

Which Hydrate Conditions Are Calculable by Hand?  Not all hydrate conditions are calcula-
ble by hand. The Three-Phase LW-H-V Calculations, Estimating the Total Amount of MeOH or
MEG  to  Inject  to  Inhibit  Hydrates,  and  Hydrate  Formation  on  Expansion  Across  a  Valve  or
Restriction sections below give hydrate formation hand calculations along the three-phase (LW-
H-V)  system  and  for  three-phase  (LW-H-V)  hydrate  formation  on  wet  gas  expansion,  as
through a valve.

The other three-phase regions (e.g., LW-H-LHC and I-H-V) are less important, and methods
presented in Three-Phase LW-H-V Calculations are suitable for checking the accuracy of a com-
puter  program  in  the  LW-H-V  region  as  an  indication  of  the  quality  of  the  other  three-phase
predictions. Four-phase (LW-H-V-LHC) hand calculation methods are not available, and one gen-
erally must rely on computer methods for this most common flow assurance hydrate concern.
Recent work by Hopgood17 shows that hydrate prediction programs commonly are in error by
as much as 5°C for hydrate formation conditions in black oils; this is an area of current research.
For  the  two-phase  regions  of  hydrate  equilibria, such  as  those  shown  schematically in  the
Gas + Pure Condensate + Water Systems (e.g., H2O + C2H6, C3H8, or i-C4H10) section above
(i.e., V-H, LHC-H, and I-H), the key question is that of water content: how much water can a
vapor or liquid hydrocarbon phase hold before hydrates will precipitate? Just as knowing the V
and LHC saturation conditions allows the engineer to avoid solid hydrate formation, determining
the I-H region (below 273 K) lets the engineer avoid ice or hydrate formation, both of which

cause flow problems. Unfortunately, however, for hydrate precipitation from a vapor or liquid
hydrocarbon, there is no water content hand calculation analogous to either Fig. 11.1 (for V-LW
water dewpoints) or Fig. 11.3 (for LHC-LW water dewpoints).

Three-Phase LW-H-V Calculations.  There are several ways to do hand calculations for three-

phase LW-H-V conditions:

• For pure hydrate guests (e.g., CH4, C2H6, C3H8, and i-C4H10), Eq. 11.6 can be used with
the constants in Table 11.6, noting the range of application. A somewhat less accurate semilog-
arithmic  interpolation  can  be  performed  between  the  two  quadruple  points  listed  for  pure
components  in  Table  11.7,  as  briefly  discussed  in  Gas  +  Pure  Condensate  +  Water  Systems
(e.g., H2O + C2H6, C3H8, or i-C4H10).

• For  gas  mixtures,  a  relatively  low  pressure  is  required  for  hydrate  formation.  For  exam-
ple, at a typical seafloor temperature of 277 K, hydrates will form in a natural gas system if
free water is available and the pressure is greater than 1.2 MPa. Hydrate formation data at 277
K  were  averaged  for  20  natural  gases,7  and  the  average  formation  pressure  was  1.2  MPa.  Of
the  20  gases,  the  lowest  formation  pressure  was  0.67  MPa  for  a  gas  with  7.0  mol%  C3H8,
while the highest value was 2.00 MPa for a gas with 1.8 mol% C3H8. At temperatures below
277 K, pressures below the 1.2 MPa average are required.

• Although it is not presented in this section, the Katz18 KVH value method can be used for
hydrate  formation  condition  estimation  from  gas  mixtures.  Hydrate  KVH  values  (defined  as  a
component’s mole fraction divided by that in the hydrate) for each gas component are used to
determine  a  hydrate  dewpoint  for  a  gas  of  constant  composition.  As  with  the  more  common
DePriester19 vapor/liquid values (KVL), the hydrate KVH values are functions of temperature and
pressure. The KVH method is not considered here for two reasons. First, at a given temperature
and  pressure,  the  method  gives  the  same  KVH  value,  regardless  of  hydrate  type,  even  though
the KVH value should be a strong function of crystal type. Second, the number of plots (>11)
for the corrected method is unwieldy. See Sloan7 for details and examples of the original KVH
method, including an extension to hydrate formation from water and liquid hydrocarbon (LW+LHC
+H).

• A more compact, accessible method for hydrate formation from water and gas mixtures is
the gas gravity method. Presented in detail below, the gas gravity method is suitable for calcu-
lation  of  LW-H-V  equilibrium  pressures  and  temperatures  at  the  point  of  hydrate  formation.
Although the method is only up to 75% accurate in pressure, it gives a fast initial estimate and
has  the  advantage  of  being  extended  easily  to  expansion  calculations  for  hydrate  formation
from wet gases.

The gas gravity method is the simplest method for quantifying the hydrate formation tem-
perature  and  pressure.  Gas  gravity  is  defined  as  the  molecular  weight  of  the  gas  divided  by
that of air. To use the chart shown in Fig. 11.6, calculate the gas gravity and specify the low-
est temperature of the pipeline/process. The pressure at which hydrates will form then is read
directly from the chart at that gas gravity and temperature.

To  the  left  of  every  line,  hydrates  will  form  with  a  gas  of  that  gravity.  At  pressures  and
temperatures to the right of every line, the system will be hydrate-free. The following example,
modified from Katz’s20 original work, illustrates chart use.

Example 11.1 A  gas  is  composed  of  (mol%)  92.67%  methane,  5.29%  ethane,  1.38%
propane,  0.182%  i-butane,  0.338%  n-butane,  and  0.14%  pentane.  When  free  water  is  present
with the gas, find:

• The pressure at which hydrates form at 283.2 K (50°F).
• The temperature at which hydrates form at 6.8 MPa (1,000 psia).

Chapter 11—Phase Behavior of H2O + Hydrocarbon Systems

Fig. 11.6—Pressure/temperature curves for predicting hydrate formation (from Katz20).

• The  highest  gas  gravity  without  hydrate  formation,  when  the  pressure  is  4.76  MPa  (700

psia) and the temperature is 289 K (60°F).

The  gas  gravity  (γg)  is  calculated  as  0.603,  using  the  average  molecular  weight  calculated

in Table 11.8 and Eq. 11.8:

γg = M g
Ma

= 17.470

28.966 = 0.603, ................................................. (11.8)

where  M g  =  the  total  molecular  weight  of  the  gas  in  the  mixture  and  Ma  =  the  molecular
weight of air. Using this gas gravity number to read Fig. 11.6 indicates that:

• At 50°F, the hydrate formation pressure is 450 psia at a gas gravity of 0.603.
• At 1,000 psia, the hydrate formation temperature is 61°F at a gas gravity of 0.603.
• At 700 psia and 60°F, gases with gravity below 0.69 are not expected to form hydrates.
• Caution: this method is only approximate for several reasons:
• Fig. 11.6 was generated for gases containing only hydrocarbons and should be used with

caution for gases with substantial amounts of CO2, H2S, or N2.

• The  curves  should  not  be  extrapolated  to  temperatures  below  273  K  (32°F)  or  to  pres-

sures above 2.72 MPa (4,000 psia)—the data limits upon which the gas gravity plot is based.

I-520

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

• For  the  hydrate  equilibrium  temperature  (Teq)  and  pressure  (peq),  the  estimated  inaccura-

cies21 for 0.6 gravity gas are at a maximum of ±7°F or ±500 psia.

Over the 60 years since the generation of the chart in Fig. 11.6, the development of more
accurate hydrate data and prediction methods have led to the gravity method being used as a
first estimate or a check, rather than as a principle method, despite its ease of calculation. The
introduction of the Hand Calculations of Hydrate Formation Conditions section above discuss-
es  the  computer  programs  available,  which  are  the  current  and  most  accurate  method  for
prediction of hydrate conditions.

Most  commonly  now,  perhaps,  the  gas  gravity  chart  is  used  to  check  the  conditions  at
which  a  flowline  fluid  will  enter  the  hydrate  formation  region.  Such  a  calculation  requires  a
second  multiphase  fluid  flow  simulator,  such  as  OLGA  or  Pipephase.*  A  discussion  of  such
simulators is beyond the scope of this chapter, however.

Estimating the Total Amount of MeOH or MEG to Inject to Inhibit Hydrates. The amount
of injected MeOH or MEG needed to inhibit hydrate formation is the total of the amounts that
reside  in  three  phases:  aqueous  liquid,  hydrocarbon  vapor,  and  liquid  hydrocarbon.  The  in-
hibitor in the hydrocarbon vapor and liquid hydrocarbon phases has no effect—hydrate inhibi-
tion occurs only in the aqueous phase—but this inefficiency is unavoidable.

The  Hammerschmidt15  equation  (Eq.  11.7)  provides  the  MeOH  or  MEG  concentration  in
the aqueous phase. With that inhibitor concentration as a basis, the amount of inhibitor in the
vapor or liquid hydrocarbon phases is estimated by:

K = exp(a − b

T), .......................................................... (11.9)

where K is a function of inhibitor used and the phase into which it partitions [e.g., (KV)MeOH or
(KL)MEG]; a and b = constants6 for the two most common inhibitors, MeOH and MEG, as listed
in Table 11.9; and T = temperature, in °R.

With  Eq.  11.9,  one  can  calculate  the  total  amount  of  hydrate  inhibitor  needed,  as  shown
below in Ex. 2. Note that the fourth (missing) value of (KV)MEG in the above table is taken as
zero  because  the  amount  of  ethylene  glycol  lost  to  the  vapor  phase  is  too  small  to  measure.
Although these expressions for the inhibitor partitioning are the most current, inhibitor partition-

ing is an active research area, for which new equations and constants will be developed over
the coming few years.

Example 11.2 A pipeline with the gas composition below has inlet pipeline conditions of
195°F and 1,050 psia. The gas flowing through the pipeline is cooled to 38°F by the surround-
ing water. The gas also experiences a pressure drop to 950 psia. Gas exits the pipeline at a rate
of 3.2 MMscf/D. The pipeline produces condensate at a rate of 25 B/D, with an average densi-
ty  of  300  lbm/bbl  and  an  average  molecular  weight  of  90  lbm/lbm  mol.  Produced  free  water
enters the pipeline at a rate of 0.25 B/D.

Find the rate of methanol injection that will prevent hydrates in the pipeline for a natural
gas  composed  of  (mol%)  71.60%  methane,  4.73%  ethane  1.94%  propane,  0.79%  n-butane,
0.79% n-pentane, 14.19% carbon dioxide, and 5.96% nitrogen.

The basis for these calculations is 1.0 MMscf/D. Methanol will exist in three phases: water,

gas, and condensate. The steps in the solution are:

1. Calculate hydrate formation conditions using the gas gravity chart (Fig. 11.6).
2. Calculate the wt% MeOH needed in the free-water phase.
3. Calculate the free (produced and condensed) H2O/MMscf of natural gas.
4. Calculate the methanol needed in the aqueous phase.
5. Calculate the methanol lost to the gas phase.
6. Calculate the methanol lost to the liquid hydrocarbon phase.
7. Sum the amounts in steps 4, 5, and 6 for the total methanol needed.
Step 1—Calculate hydrate formation conditions using the gas gravity chart. Start by calcu-

lating the gas gravity (γg), using Eq. 11.8 and the data in Table 11.10:

γg = M g
Ma

= 22.708

28.966 = 0.784.

At γg = 0.704, the gas gravity chart shows the hydrate temperature to be 65°F at 1,050 psia.
Step  2—Calculate  the  wt%  MeOH  needed  in  the  free-water  phase.  Recall  the  Hammer-

schmidt15 equation (Eq. 11.7):

ΔT =

2,335W

100M − MW ,

where  ΔT  =  the  hydrate  temperature  depression  from  the  equilibrium  temperature  at  a  given
pressure (65°F – 38°F = 27°F); M = molecular weight of the inhibitor (methanol = 32.0); and
W = wt% of the inhibitor in the free-water phase. Rearranging the Hammerschmidt equation to
find W:

I-522

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

W =

100MΔT
MΔT + 2,335 =

(100)(32)(27)
(32)(27) + 2,335 = 27,

yields that 27 wt% of methanol is needed in the free-water phase to provide hydrate inhibition
at 1,050 psia and 38°F (highest pressure, lowest temperature) for this gas.

Step 3—Calculate the mass of liquid water/MMscf of natural gas.
a) Calculate the mass of condensed H2O. In the absence of a water analysis, use the water
content chart (Fig. 11.1) to calculate the amount of water in the vapor/MMscf. By this chart,
1,050  psia  and  195°F,  the  inlet  gas  water  content  is  600  lbm/MMscf.  At  950  psia  and  38°F,
the exiting gas contains 9 lbm/MMscf of water. The difference between the original water and
the water remaining in the gas is the mass of liquid water from condensation: 600 – 9 = 591
lbm/MMscf.

b) Calculate the mass of produced H2O flowing into the line. Convert the produced water

of 0.25 B/D to lbm/MMscf:

0.25 B/ D × 42 U.S. gal/ bbl × 8.34 lbm/ gal × 1 d/ 3.2 MMscf = 27.4 lbm/ MMscf H2O.

c) Calculate the total mass of water/MMscf of gas. Sum the condensed and produced water:

591 + 27.4 = 618.4 lbm / MMscf.

Step  4—Calculate  the  rate  of  methanol  needed  in  the  aqueous  phase.  With  27.0  wt%
methanol required to inhibit the free-water phase, and the mass of water/MMscf calculated at
618.4 lbm in the free-water phase, the mass (m) of MeOH/MMscf is

27.0 wt % MeOH =

m lbm MeOH

m lbm MeOH + 618.4 lbm H2O × 100 %

Solving this equation yields m =228.7 lbm MeOH in the water phase.

The mole fraction MeOH in the free-water phase (xMeOH-W) is:

Chapter 11—Phase Behavior of H2O + Hydrocarbon Systems

I-523

=

228.7 lbm MeOH / (32 lbm / lbm mol MeOH)

228.7 lbm MeOH/ (32 lbm/ lbm mol MeOH) + 618.4 lbm H2O/ (18 lbm/ lbm mol H2O)

xMeOH−W

The mole fraction MeOH in the free-water phase is xMeOH-W = 0.172.

Step 5—Calculate the MeOH lost to the gas phase. The distribution constant of MeOH in

the gas is calculated by Eq. 11.9 to be 38°F (497.7°R), relative to the methanol in the water:

(KV)

MeOH = exp (5.706 − 5738 × (1/ 497.7)) = 0.00296

The mole fraction of MeOH in the vapor (yMeOH)-V is:

yMeOH − V = (KV)

MeOH × xMeOH − W = 0.00296 × 0.172 = 0.000509.

The daily gas rate is 8,432 lbm mol [= 3.2 × 106 scf/(379.5 scf/lbm mol), where an scf is
at 14.7 psia and 60°F], so that the MeOH lost to the gas is 4.29 lbm mol (= 0.000509 × 8,432)
or 137.3 lbm/D. Because the calculation basis is 1 MMscf/D, the amount of MeOH lost is 42.9
lbm/MMscf (= 137.3 lbm/3.2 MMscf).

Step 6—Calculate the amount of MeOH lost to the condensate.

(KL)

MeOH = exp 5.90 − 5404.5 × (1/ 497.7°R) = 0.00702

The mole fraction MeOH in condensate (xMeOH-HC) is:

MeOH × xMeOH − W = 0.00702 × 0.172 = 0.001207.

The condensate rate is 26.0 lbm mol/MMscf (= 25 B/D × 300 lbm/bbl × 1 lbm mol/90 lbm
×  1  d/3.2  MMscf),  so  that  the  amount  of  MeOH  in  condensate  is  0.0314  lbm  mol/MMscf

This example illustrates the fact that a significant amount of MeOH partitions into the va-
por  and  liquid  hydrocarbon  phases.  The  calculation  could  be  done  equally  well  for  MEG,

Hydrate  Formation  on  Expansion  Across  a  Valve  or  Restriction.    When  water-wet  gas  ex-
pands rapidly through a valve, orifice, or other restriction, hydrates form because of rapid gas
cooling by Joule-Thomson (constant enthalpy) expansion. Hydrate formation with rapid expan-
sion from a wet line is common in fuel gas or instrument gas lines. In well-testing, startup, and
gas lift operations, hydrates can form with high pressure drops, even with a high initial temper-
ature,  if  the  pressure  drop  is  very  large.  This  section  provides  an  initial  hand  calculation
method for situations when hydrates will form upon rapid expansion. Sloan6 (pp. 21ff) contains
a more accurate computer calculation method and discussion.

If a gas expands rapidly through a valve or restriction, the fluids will cool much faster than
with heat transfer, possibly causing the system to enter the hydrate formation regime at the valve/
restriction  discharge.  Two  rapid  expansion  curves  for  the  same  0.6-gravity  gas  are  shown  in
Fig. 11.7. Intersections of the gas expansion curves with the hydrate formation line limits the
expansion  discharge  pressures  from  two  different  high  initial  P/T  conditions,  labeled  Gas  A
and Gas B.

In  Fig.  11.7,  the  curves  determine  the  restriction  downstream  pressure  at  which  hydrate
blockages will form for a given upstream pressure and temperature. Gas A expands from 13.6
MPa (2,000 psia) and 316 K (110°F) until it strikes the hydrate formation curve at 0.53 MPa
(780 psia) and 287 K (57°F), so 0.53 MPa (780 psia) represents the limit to hydrate-free expan-

sion. Gas B expands from 12.2 MPa (1,800 psia) and 322 K (120°F) to intersect the hydrate
formation curve at a limiting pressure of 1.97 MPa (290 psia) and 279 K (42°F). In expansion
processes, the upstream temperature and pressure are known, but the discharge temperature usu-
ally is unknown, and a downstream vessel normally sets the discharge pressure.

Cooling curves such as the two in Fig. 11.7 were determined for constant enthalpy (Joule-
Thomson)  expansions,  obtained  from  the  First  Law  of  Thermodynamics  for  a  system  flowing
at steady state, ignoring kinetic and potential energy changes:

ΔH2 = Q −Ws, ............................................................ (11.10)

where ΔH2 = the enthalpy difference across the restriction (downstream to upstream), Q = the
heat  added,  and  Ws  =  shaft  work  obtained  at  the  restriction.  Normal  flow  restrictions  (e.g.,
valves and orifices) have no shaft work, and because rapid flow approximates adiabatic opera-
tion, both Ws and Q are zero. The result is constant enthalpy (ΔH2 = 0) operation on expansion.
Katz20 generated charts to determine the hydrate-free limit to gas expansion, combining the
gas gravity chart (Fig. 11.6) and the gas enthalpy/entropy charts by Brown22 to determine Fig.
11.7’s hydrate formation line and cooling lines labeled Gas A and Gas B, respectively. Interest-
ingly,  Brown’s  charts  also  could  be  used  with  Fig.  11.6  to  determine  the  limits  to  wet  gas
expansion across an isentropic device such as a nozzle or turboexpander; however, that has not
been done.

Cautioning that the charts apply to gases of limited compositions, Katz20 provided constant
enthalpy  expansion  charts  for  gases  of  0.6,  0.7,  and  0.8  gravities,  shown  in  Figs.  11.8,  11.9,
and 11.10, respectively. The abscissa (x-axis) in each figure represents the lowest downstream
pressure  without  hydrate  formation,  given  the  upstream  pressure  on  the  ordinate  (y-axis)  and
the upstream temperature (a parameter on each line).

Note that maxima in Figs. 11.8 through 11.10 occur at the upstream pressure of 40.8 MPa
(6,000 psia), the Joule-Thomson inversion pressure. At pressures above 6,000 psia, these gases
will cool on expansion.

The following three examples of chart use are from Katz’s20 original work.

Example 11.3a  To  what  pressure  can  a  0.6-gravity  gas  at  13.6  MPa  (2,000  psia)  and

311 K (100°F) be expanded without danger of hydrate formation?

According to Fig. 11.8, the maximum pressure of gas expansion is 7.14 MPa (1,050 psia).

Example 11.3b How  far  can  a  0.6-gravity  gas  at  13.6  MPa  (2,000  psia)  and  333  K

(140°F) be expanded without hydrate formation?

Fig.  11.8  shows  that  there  is  no  intersection  with  the  333  K  (140°F)  isotherm.  Hydrates

will not form upon expansion to atmospheric pressure.

Example 11.3c A  0.6-gravity  gas  is  to  be  expanded  from  10.2  MPa  (1,500  psia)  to  3.4
MPa (500 psia). What is the minimum initial temperature that will permit the expansion with-
out danger of hydrates?

Fig. 11.8 shows that 310 K (99°F) is the minimum initial temperature to avoid hydrates.

Figs. 11.8 through 11.10 incorporate the inaccuracies of the gas gravity charts from which
they were derived. As indicated in the Three-Phase LW-H-V Calculations section above, the 0.6-
gravity  chart  (used  for  both  hydrate  formation  and  gas  expansion)  may  have  inaccuracies  of

±3.4  MPa  (500  psia).  Accuracy  limits  for  these  expansion  curves  have  been  tested  by  Loh
et al.,23 who found, for example, that the allowable 0.6-gravity gas expansion from 23.8 MPa
(3,500  psia)  and  338  K  (150°F)  should  be  2.8  MPa  (410  psia),  rather  than  the  value  of  4.76
MPa (700 psia) given by Fig.11.8.

11.5 Conclusions
The fundamental reason an engineer should consider the equilibria is the possible existence of
a water phase, in which hydrates can form, causing multiphase flow, flow blockage, and other
engineering  challenges.  Flowline  blockages  can  cause  losses  of  millions  of  dollars  of  income
while  blockage  remediation  is  occurring.  The  most  accurate  prediction  methods  allow  avoid-

ance of flowline blockages. With this review of the topic of H2O + hydrocarbon equilibria and
the hand-calculation methods provided in this chapter, the engineer should be able to determine
whether the computer calculation is within the accuracy bounds of the hand-calculation meth-
ods and, if not, whether the circumstances require a more accurate computer calculation. For a

Crude Oil Emulsions
Sunil L. Kokal, Saudi Aramco

12.1 Introduction
Crude oil is seldom produced alone because it generally is commingled with water. The water
creates  several  problems  and  usually  increases  the  unit  cost  of  oil  production.  The  produced
water must be separated from the oil, treated, and disposed of properly. All these steps increase
costs. Furthermore, sellable crude oil must comply with certain product specifications, includ-
ing the amount of basic sediment and water (BS&W) and salt, which means that the produced
water must be separated from the oil to meet crude specifications.

Produced water may be produced as “free” water (i.e., water that will settle out fairly rapid-
ly),  and  it  may  be  produced  in  the  form  of  an  emulsion.  A  regular  oilfield  emulsion  is  a
dispersion  of  water  droplets  in  oil.  Emulsions  can  be  difficult  to  treat  and  may  cause  several
operational  problems  in  wet-crude  handling  facilities  and  gas/oil  separating  plants.  Emulsions
can create high-pressure drops in flow lines, lead to an increase in demulsifier use, and some-
times cause trips or upsets in wet-crude handling facilities. The problem is usually at its worst
during  the  winter  because  of  lower  surface  temperatures.  These  emulsions  must  be  treated  to
remove the dispersed water and associated inorganic salts to meet crude specifications for trans-
portation,  storage,  and  export  and  to  reduce  corrosion  and  catalyst  poisoning  in  downstream
processing facilities.

Emulsions  occur  in  almost  all  phases  of  oil  production  and  processing:  inside  reservoirs,
wellbores, and wellheads; at wet-crude handling facilities and gas/oil separation plants; and dur-
ing  transportation  through  pipelines,  crude  storage,  and  petroleum  processing.  The  chapter  on
emulsion treating in the Facilities section of this handbook deals with the hardware of emulsion-
treating  equipment.  This  chapter  is  limited  to  the  produced  oilfield  emulsions  at  the  wellhead
and in the wet-crude handling facilities. The primary focus is on the fundamentals and the ap-
plication of available technologies in resolving emulsions. The chapter looks at the characteris-
tics,  occurrence,  formation,  stability,  handling,  and  breaking  of  produced  oilfield  emulsions.
There  are  several  good  general  references  available  for  more  detailed  and  diversified  discus-
sions on crude oil emulsions. A comprehensive presentation and further basic information can
be found in an encyclopedia of emulsion technology,1–3 Becher’s classic book4 on the subject,
and recent books on petroleum emulsions.5,6

This  chapter  covers  four  aspects  of  produced  oilfield  emulsions.  [CD  edition  includes

• Sec. 12.1 provides a brief introduction to the occurrence, types, and characteristics of emul-
sions.  It  deals  with  the  fundamental  nature  of  emulsions  including  their  definitions,  how  they
form, and their physical properties. It also includes a subsection on viscosities of emulsions.

• Sec. 12.2 discusses the stability of emulsions including the formation of films or “skins”
on  the  droplets.  Factors  that  affect  emulsion  stability  include  heavy  polar  material  in  the  oil
(asphaltenes,  waxes),  very  fine  solids,  temperature,  droplet  size,  pH,  and  brine  composition.
This section also discusses how to measure emulsion stability.

• Sec. 12.3 visits the mechanisms of demulsification. The factors that destabilize emulsions
include  temperature,  shear,  removal  of  solids,  and  control  of  emulsifying  agents.  This  section
also discusses the practical aspects of demulsification and highlights methods of emulsion break-
ing including thermal, mechanical, electrical, and chemical.

• Sec. 12.4 discusses field applications and special topics that should be useful for the prac-
ticing  engineer  dealing  with  emulsions,  either  regularly  or  on  a  limited  basis.  A  method  to
sample  oilfield  emulsions  is  included.  A  field  emulsion  treatment  program  is  discussed  and,
more importantly, methods to prevent emulsion problems are highlighted. Finally, the practical
aspects of demulsifier selection and optimization are included.

12.1.1 Definition.  An emulsion is a dispersion (droplets) of one liquid in another immiscible
liquid. The phase that is present in the form of droplets is the dispersed or internal phase, and
the phase in which the droplets are suspended is called the continuous or external phase. For
produced  oilfield  emulsions,  one  of  the  liquids  is  aqueous  and  the  other  is  crude  oil.  The
amount of water that emulsifies with crude oil varies widely from facility to facility. It can be
less than 1% and sometimes greater than 80%.

12.1.2 Types  of  Emulsions.    Produced  oilfield  emulsions  can  be  classified  into  three  broad
groups:  water-in-oil,  oil-in-water,  and  multiple  or  complex  emulsions.  Water-in-oil  emulsions
consist  of  water  droplets  in  a  continuous  oil  phase,  and  oil-in-water  emulsions  consist  of  oil
droplets in a water-continuous phase. Figs. 12.1 and 12.2 show the two basic (water-in-oil and
oil-in-water) types of emulsions. In the oil industry, water-in-oil emulsions are more common
(most  produced  oilfield  emulsions  are  of  this  kind);  therefore,  the  oil-in-water  emulsions  are
sometimes referred to as “reverse” emulsions.

Multiple  emulsions  are  more  complex  and  consist  of  tiny  droplets  suspended  in  bigger
droplets that are suspended in a continuous phase. For example, a water-in-oil-in-water emul-

Fig. 12.3—Photomicrograph of a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion.

sion consists of water droplets suspended in larger oil droplets that, in turn, are suspended in a
continuous water phase. Fig. 12.3 shows an example of a multiple emulsion.

Given the oil and water phases, the type of emulsion formed depends on several factors. As
a rule of thumb, when the volume fraction of one phase is very small compared with the other,
the  phase  that  has  the  smaller  fraction  is  the  dispersed  phase  and  the  other  is  the  continuous
phase. When the volume-phase ratio is close to 1 (a 50:50 ratio), then other factors determine
the type of emulsion formed.

Emulsions are also classified by the size of the droplets in the continuous phase. When the
dispersed  droplets  are  larger  than  0.1  μm,  the  emulsion  is  a  macroemulsion.5,7  Emulsions  of
this kind are normally thermodynamically unstable (i.e., the two phases will separate over time
because  of  a  tendency  for  the  emulsion  to  reduce  its  interfacial  energy  by  coalescence  and
separation). However, droplet coalescence can be reduced or even eliminated through a stabi-
lization mechanism. Most oilfield emulsions belong in this category. In contrast to macroemul-
sions,  there  is  a  second  class  of  emulsions  known  as  microemulsions.  These  emulsions  form
spontaneously  when  two  immiscible  phases  are  brought  together  because  of  their  extremely
low interfacial energy. Microemulsions have very small droplet sizes, less than 10 nm, and are

considered  thermodynamically  stable.
macroemulsions in their formation and stability.

 Microemulsions  are  fundamentally  different

 from

12.1.3 Formation of Emulsions.  Crude oil emulsions form when oil and water (brine) come
into  contact with  each other,  when  there is  sufficient mixing, and  when  an  emulsifying agent
or emulsifier is present. The amount of mixing and the presence of emulsifier are critical for
the formation of an emulsion. During crude oil production, there are several sources of mixing,
often  referred  to  as  the  amount  of  shear,  including  flow  through  reservoir  rock;  bottomhole
perforations/pump;  flow  through  tubing,  flow  lines,  and  production  headers;  valves,  fittings,
and chokes; surface equipment; and gas bubbles released because of phase change. The amount
of mixing depends on several factors and is difficult to avoid. In general, the greater the mix-
ing,  the  smaller  the  droplets  of  water  dispersed  in  the  oil  and  the  tighter  the  emulsion.
Emulsion studies have shown that the water droplets can vary in size from less than 1 μm to
more than 1000 μm.

The  second  factor  important  in  emulsion  formation  is  the  presence  of  an  emulsifier.  The
presence, amount, and nature of the emulsifier determines, to a large extent, the type and “tight-
ness”  of  an  emulsion.  The  natural  emulsifiers  in  a  crude  are  resident  in  the  heavy  fraction.
Because there are different types of crudes and because these crudes have different amounts of
heavy components, the emulsifying tendencies vary widely. Crude with a small amount of emul-
sifier  forms  a  less  stable  emulsion  and  separates  relatively  easily.  Other  crudes  contain  the
right type and amount of emulsifier, which lead to very stable or tight emulsions.

12.1.4 Emulsifying Agents.  Produced oilfield water-in-oil emulsions contain oil, water, and an
emulsifying agent. Emulsifiers stabilize emulsions and include surface-active agents and finely
divided solids.

Surface-Active  Agents.    Surface-active  agents  (surfactants)  are  compounds  that  are  partly
soluble in both water and oil. They have a hydrophobic part that has an affinity for oil and a
hydrophilic part that has an affinity for water. Because of this molecular structure, surfactants
tend to concentrate at the oil/water interface, where they form interfacial films. This generally
leads to a lowering of the interfacial tension (IFT) and promotes dispersion and emulsification
of the droplets. Naturally occurring emulsifiers in the crude oil include higher boiling fractions,
such as asphaltenes and resins, organic acids, and bases. These compounds have been shown to
be  the  main  constituents  of  interfacial  films  that  form  around  water  droplets  in  many  oilfield
emulsions. The stabilizing effects of asphaltenes are discussed in Sec. 12.2.2. Other surfactants
that  may  be  present  are  from  the  chemicals  injected  into  the  formation  or  wellbores  (e.g.,
drilling fluids, stimulation chemicals, corrosion inhibitors, scale inhibitors, wax, and asphaltene-
control agents).

Finely Divided Solids.  Fine solids can act as mechanical stabilizers. These particles, which
must be much smaller than emulsion droplets (usually submicron), collect at the oil/water inter-
face  and  are  wetted  by  both  oil  and  water.  The  effectiveness  of  these  solids  in  stabilizing
emulsions depends on factors such as particle size, interparticle interactions, and the wettability
of the particles.8 Finely divided solids found in oil production include clay particles, sand, as-
phaltenes and waxes, corrosion products, mineral scales, and drilling muds. Fig. 12.4 shows the
photomicrograph of an emulsion showing the presence of solids.

12.1.5 Characteristics and Physical Properties.  Oilfield emulsions are characterized by sever-
al  properties  including  appearance  and  color,  BS&W,  droplet  size,  and  bulk  and  interfacial
viscosities.

Appearance and Color.  Color and appearance is an easy way to characterize an emulsion.
The characterization becomes somewhat easy if the emulsion is transferred into a conical glass
centrifuge tube. The color of the emulsion can vary widely depending on the oil/water content

Chapter 12—Crude Oil Emulsions

and the characteristics of the oil and water. The common colors of emulsions are dark reddish
brown,  gray,  or  blackish  brown;  however,  any  color  can  occur  depending  on  the  type  of  oil
and  water  at  a  particular  facility.  Emulsion  brightness  is  sometimes  used  to  characterize  an
emulsion. An emulsion generally looks murky and opaque because of light scattering at the oil/
water  interface.  When  an  emulsion  has  small  diameter  droplets  (large  surface  area),  it  has  a
light color. When an emulsion has large diameter droplets (low total interfacial surface area), it
generally looks dark and less bright. Understanding the characteristics of an emulsion by visual
observation is an art that improves with experience.

Basic Sediment and Water.  BS&W is the solids and aqueous portion of an emulsion. It is
also referred to as BSW, bottom settlings and water, or bottom solids and water. Several meth-
ods are available to determine the amount of water and solids in emulsions. Standard methods
have  been  proposed  by  several  organizations  including  the  Institute  of  Petroleum,  American
Petroleum Institute, and the American Society for Testing Materials.5 The most common tech-
nique for the determination of oil, water, and solids consists of adding a slight overdose of a
demulsifier to an emulsion, centrifuging it, and allowing it to stand. The amount of solids and
water  separated  is  measured  directly  from  specially  designed  centrifuge  tubes.  When  only  the
water content is desired, Karl-Fischer titration can also be used. It is very accurate at low con-
tents of water (<2%) but can also be used for determining higher content (>10%). Other, less
common methods are based on electrical properties (conductance and dielectric constants), gam-
ma-ray attenuation, and microwave-based meters.5

Droplet  Size  and  Droplet-Size  Distribution.    Produced  oilfield  emulsions  generally  have
droplet  diameters  that  exceed  0.1  μm  and  may  be  larger  than  100  μm.  Emulsions  normally
have  a  droplet  size  range  that  can  be  represented  by  a  distribution  function.  Fig.  12.5  shows
the  drop-size  distributions  of  typical  petroleum  emulsions.  The  droplet-size  distribution  in  an
emulsion depends on several factors including the IFT, shear, nature and amount of emulsify-
ing agents, presence of solids, and bulk properties of oil and water. Droplet-size distribution in
an emulsion determines, to a certain extent, the stability of the emulsion and should be taken
into  consideration  in  the  selection  of  optimum  treatment  protocols.  As  a  rule  of  thumb,  the
smaller the average size of the dispersed water droplets, the tighter the emulsion and, therefore,
the longer the residence time required in a separator, which implies larger separating plant equip-
ment sizes. The photomicrographs in Figs. 12.1 through 12.4 show the droplet-size distribution
for several emulsions.

The droplet-size distribution for oilfield emulsions is determined by the following methods.5

• Microscopy  and  image  analysis.  For  example,  the  emulsion  photomicrographs  in  Figs.
12.1  through  12.4  can  be  digitized  and  the  number  of  different-sized  particles  measured  with
image analysis software.

• By the use of electrical properties such as conductivity and dielectric constants.
• By the use of scattering techniques such as light scattering, neutron scattering, and X-ray

scattering. These techniques cover droplet sizes from 0.4 nm to more than 100 μm.

• Physical  separation  including  chromatographic  techniques,  sedimentation  techniques,  and

field-flow fractionation.

Rheology.  Viscosity of Emulsions.  Emulsion viscosity can be substantially greater than the
viscosity of either the oil or the water because emulsions show non-Newtonian behavior. This
behavior is a result of droplet crowding or structural viscosity. A fluid is considered non-New-
tonian when its viscosity is a function of shear rate. At a certain volume fraction of the water
phase  (water  cut),  oilfield  emulsions  behave  as  shear-thinning  or  pseudoplastic  fluids  (i.e.,  as
shear rate increases, viscosity decreases). Fig. 12.6 shows the viscosities of tight emulsions at
125°F at different water cuts. The constant values of viscosity for all shear rates, or a slope of
zero, indicate that the emulsions exhibit Newtonian behavior up to a water content of 40%. At
water  cuts  greater  than  40%,  the  slope  of  the  curves  deviate  from  zero,  which  indicate  non-
Newtonian behavior. The non-Newtonian behavior is pseudoplastic or shear-thinning behavior.
The very high viscosities achieved as the water cut increase up to 80% (compared with viscosi-
ties  of  oil  approximately  20  cp  and  water  <1  cp).  At  approximately  80%  water  cut,  an
interesting phenomenon is observed. Up to a water cut of 80%, the emulsion is a water-in-oil
emulsion;  at  80%,  the  emulsion  “inverts”  to  an  oil-in-water  emulsion,  and  the  water,  which
was  the  dispersed  phase,  now  becomes  the  continuous  phase.  In  this  particular  case,  multiple
emulsions (water-in-oil-in-water) were observed up to very high water concentrations (>95%).

Temperature also has a significant effect on emulsion viscosity. Fig. 12.7 shows an exam-
ple  of  the  effect  of  temperature  on  emulsion  viscosity.  Emulsion  viscosity  decreases  with
increasing temperature (the data have been plotted on a semilog scale). The viscosity of emul-
sions  depend  on  several  factors:  viscosities  of  oil  and  water,  volume  fraction  of  water  dis-
persed, droplet-size distribution, temperature, shear rate, and amount of solids present.

Figs. 12.6 and 12.7 show that the viscosity of the emulsion can be substantially higher than
the viscosity of the oil or water at a given temperature. The ratio of the viscosity of an emul-
sion  to  the  viscosity  of  the  virgin  crude  oil  at  the  same  temperature  can  be  approximated  by
the following equation.

varies depending on the type of emulsion: 7.3 for very tight emulsion, 5.5 for tight emulsion,
4.5 for medium emulsion, 3.8 for loose emulsion, and 3.0 for very loose emulsion.

Fig. 12.8 shows viscosities calculated with Eq. 12.1. Emulsion viscosity depends on several
factors,  and  Eq.  12.1  provides  an  estimate  only.  For  more  precise  values,  experimental  data
must be used. Emulsion viscosity is measured by standard viscometers, such as capillary tube
and rotational viscometers (concentric cylinder, cone and plate, and parallel plate). It is impor-
tant that temperature is constant and quoted with the viscosity data. Special procedures must be
adopted for measuring the rheology of emulsions.5

Interfacial  Viscosity.    The  previous  discussion  on  viscosity  was  limited  to  bulk  emulsion
viscosity.  A  closely  related  and  very  important  property,  especially  for  demulsification,  is  the
interfacial viscosity, or the viscosity of the fluid at the oil/water interface. As mentioned previ-
ously,  water-in-oil  emulsions  form  rigid  interfacial  films  encapsulating  the  water  droplets.
These interfacial films stabilize an emulsion by lowering IFT and increasing interfacial viscosi-
ty. These films retard the rate of oil-film drainage (see Sec. 12.2.2) during the coalescence of
water droplets, thereby greatly reducing the rate of emulsion breakdown. The oil-drainage rate

I-540

depends on the interfacial shear viscosity. High interfacial viscosities significantly slow the liq-
uid  drainage  rate  and  thus  have  a  stabilizing  effect  on  the  emulsion.  Emulsion  interfacial
viscosity plays a very important role in demulsification and is discussed in Sec. 12.2.1. Refs. 9
through  11  provide  a  detailed  discussion  of  measurement  techniques  and  application  to  emul-
sion stability.

12.2 Stability of Emulsions
From a purely thermodynamic point of view, an emulsion is an unstable system because there
is a natural tendency for a liquid/liquid system to separate and reduce its interfacial area and,
hence,  its  interfacial  energy.  However,  most  emulsions  demonstrate  kinetic  stability  (i.e.,  they
are  stable  over  a  period  of  time).  Produced  oilfield  emulsions  are  classified  on  the  basis  of
their degree of kinetic stability. Loose emulsions separate in a few minutes, and the separated
water  is  free  water.  Medium  emulsions  separate  in  tens  of  minutes.  Tight  emulsions  separate
(sometimes only partially) in hours or even days.

Water-in-oil  emulsions  are  considered  to  be  special  liquid-in-liquid  colloidal  dispersions.
Their kinetic stability is a consequence of small droplet size and the presence of an interfacial
film around water droplets and is caused by stabilizing agents (or emulsifiers). These stabiliz-
ers suppress the mechanisms involved (sedimentation, aggregation or flocculation, coalescence,
and  phase  inversion)  that  would  otherwise  break  down  an  emulsion.  Sedimentation  is  the
falling  of  water  droplets  from  an  emulsion  because  of  the  density  difference  between  the  oil
and water. Aggregation or flocculation is the grouping together of water droplets in an emul-
sion  without  a  change  in  surface  area.  Coalescence  is  the  fusion  of  droplets  to  form  larger
drops with reduced total surface area. Sec. 12.3 discusses the mechanisms of emulsion breakup.

12.2.1 Surface Films and Stability to Coalescence.  As  mentioned  previously,  produced  oil-
field  emulsions  are  stabilized  by  films  that  form  around  the  water  droplets  at  the  oil/water
interface. These films are believed to result from the adsorption of high-molecular-weight polar
molecules that are interfacially active (surfactant-like behavior). These films enhance the stabil-
ity of an emulsion by increasing the interfacial viscosity. Highly viscous interfacial films retard
the  rate  of  oil-film  drainage  during  the  coalescence  of  the  water  droplets  by  providing  a  me-
chanical  barrier  to  coalescence,  which  can  lead  to  a  reduction  in  the  rate  of  emulsion  break-
down. Figs. 12.9 and 12.10 show the persistent film in a water-in-oil emulsion. The presence
of fine solids can also strengthen the interfacial film and further stabilize emulsions.

The  properties  of  interfacial  films  depend  on  the  type  of  crude  oil  (asphaltic,  paraffinic,
etc.), composition and pH of the water, temperature, the extent to which the adsorbed film is
compressed,  contact  or  aging  time,  and  the  concentration  of  polar  molecules  in  the  crude

oil.5,12–14 A good correlation exists between the presence of incompressible interfacial film and
emulsion  stability.  These  films  are  classified  into  two  categories  on  the  basis  of  their
mobilities.12,13 Rigid or solid films are like an insoluble, solid skin on water droplets character-
ized  by  very  high  interfacial  viscosity.  There  is  considerable  evidence  that  very  fine  solids
stabilize these films. They provide a structural barrier to droplet coalescence and increase emul-
sion stability. These films also have viscoelastic properties. Mobile or liquid films are character-
ized by low interfacial viscosities. Liquid films are formed, for example, when a demulsifier is
added to an emulsion. They are inherently less stable than rigid or solid films, and coalescence
of water droplets is enhanced.

Emulsion stability has been correlated with the mobility of interfacial films.10,13 Surfactants
that modify the rigidity of the film can affect demulsification considerably. Sec. 12.3 discusses
this topic further.

12.2.2 Factors Affecting Stability.  It  is  evident  from  the  previous  discussion  that  interfacial
films are primarily responsible for emulsion stability. In this section we discuss the factors that
affect interfacial films and, therefore, the emulsion stability. Important factors are heavy polar
fractions  in  the  crude  oil;  solids,  including  organic  (asphaltenes,  waxes)  and  inorganic  (clays,

I-542

scales,  corrosion  products,  etc.)  materials;  temperature;  droplet  size  and  droplet-size  distribu-
tion; pH of the brine; and brine composition.12–16

Heavy Polar Fraction in Crude Oil.  Naturally occurring emulsifiers are concentrated in the
higher-boiling polar fraction of the crude oil.12–18 These include asphaltenes, resins, and oil-sol-
uble  organic  acids  (e.g.,  naphthenic,  carboxylic)  and  bases.  These  compounds  are  the  main
constituents  of  the  interfacial  films  surrounding  the  water  droplets  that  give  emulsions  their
stability.

Asphaltenes.    Fig.  12.11  shows  that  asphaltenes  are  complex  polyaromatic  molecules  de-
 acetate  and  insoluble  in  low-molecular-weight
fined  to  be  soluble  in  benzene/ethyl
n-alkanes.19,20 They are dark brown to black friable solids with no definite melting point. As-
phaltenes are considered to consist of condensed aromatic sheets with alkyl and alicyclic side
chains  and  heteroatoms  (nitrogen,  oxygen,  sulfur,  and  trace  metals  like  vanadium  and  nickel)
scattered  throughout.  Fig.  12.12  shows  the  hypothetical  structure  of  a  petroleum  asphaltene,
and  Fig.  12.13  shows  a  3D  representation.  Asphaltene  molecules  can  have  carbon  numbers
from 30 and over and molecular weights from 500 to more than 10,000. They are characterized
by a fairly constant hydrogen/carbon ratio of 1.15 with a specific gravity near one.

The  nature  of  asphaltenes  in  the  crude  oil  is  still  a  subject  of  debate  (see  the  chapter  on
asphaltenes in this section of the Handbook). The asphaltenes are believed to exist in the oil as
a colloidal suspension and to be stabilized by resins adsorbed on their surface.21 In this regard,
the  resins  act  as  peptizing  agents  for  asphaltenes  and  together  form  clusters  called  micelles
(Fig. 12.14). These micelles or colloids contain most of the polar material found in the crude
oil and possess surface-active properties (interfacially active material). The surface-active prop-
erties are the result of the sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen, and metal containing entities in asphaltenes
molecules that form polar groups such as aldehydes, carbonyl, carboxylic, amine, and amides.

It is this surface-active behavior of asphaltenes that makes them good emulsifiers. Surfac-
tants are compounds that have a polar part with an affinity to water and a nonpolar part with
an  affinity to  oil  (Fig. 12.15).  This  dual  affinity is  satisfied when  they  are  positioned (or  ad-
sorbed) at the oil/water interface with the polar part immersed in water and the nonpolar part
in  oil.  This  orientation  results  in  a  decrease  in  the  thermodynamic  free  energy  of  the  system.
The accumulation of high-molecular-weight substances at the interface results in the formation
of  the  rigid  film.  Fig.  12.16  shows  an  asphaltene-stabilized  water  droplet.  When  such  a  film
forms,  it  acts  as  a  barrier  to  drop  coalescence.  For  two  drops  to  coalesce,  the  film  must  be
drained and ruptured. The presence of the asphaltenes can naturally retard the drainage of this
film.  The  primary  mechanism  involved  in  this  retardation  is  the  steric  repulsion  or  hindrance

caused by the high-molecular-weight materials in the film.8,22 Fig. 12.17 shows the steric repul-
sion produced by the interaction between the nonpolar or hydrophobic groups of the surfactant
molecules. With asphaltenic-surfactant molecules, the side chains can extend considerably into
the  oil  phase  and  steric  repulsion  can  maintain  the  interface  at  a  distance  sufficient  to  inhibit
coalescence. The molecules at the oil/water interface result in an increase in both the interfacial
viscosity and the apparent viscosity of the oil in the film between the droplets. Both of these
effects oppose film drainage and inhibit coalescence.22

The state of asphaltenes in the crude oil has an effect on its emulsion-stability properties.
While asphaltenes stabilize emulsions when they are present in a colloidal state (not yet floccu-
lated),  there  is  strong  evidence  that  their  emulsion-stabilizing  properties  are  enhanced  signifi-
cantly  when  they  are  precipitated  from  the  crude  oil  and  are  present  in  the  solid  phase.  The
effect of polar fractions (primarily asphaltenes) on the film properties was investigated by Stass-
ner.13  In  a  series  of  tests,  it  was  demonstrated  that  the  removal  of  asphaltenes  (deasphalting)
from the crude oil resulted in a very loose emulsion characterized by mobile films. Adding the
precipitated asphaltenes back to the deasphalted oil in increasing quantities resulted in the for-

mation of rigid or solid films and increasingly stable emulsions. Fig. 12.18 shows the effect of
asphaltenes  (when  added  to  deasphalted  oil)  on  emulsion  stability.  Another  study18  examined
the effect of asphaltenes on emulsion stabilization and showed that the extent of emulsification
was  related  to  the  aromatic/aliphatic  ratio  of  the  crude  oil.  This  was  further  substantiated  by
Bobra.15  Both  studies15,18  reported  that  two  factors  control  emulsion  stability:  the  amount  of
asphaltenes  and  the  aromatic/alkane  ratio  in  the  crude  oil.  Emulsification  tendencies  reduce

with increasing aromatic content of the crude oil. Asphaltenes, apart from stabilizing emulsions
themselves,  alter  the  wettability  of  other  solids  present  and  make  them  act  as  emulsifying
agents for water-in-oil emulsions.16,17,23–25

Resins.  Resins are complex high-molecular-weight compounds that are not soluble in ethyl-
acetate but are soluble in n-heptane (Fig. 12.11). They are heterocompounds, like asphaltenes,
that contain oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms. Molecular weights of resins range from 500 to
2,000.  As  Fig.  12.14  shows,  resins  have  a  strong  tendency  to  associate  with  asphaltenes,  and
together they form a micelle. As Figs. 12.16 and 12.17 illustrate, the asphaltene-resin micelle
plays a key role in stabilizing emulsions. It appears that the asphaltene-resin ratio in the crude
oil is responsible for the type of film formed (solid or mobile) and, therefore, is directly linked
to the stability of the emulsion.13,15

Waxes.    Waxes  are  high-molecular-weight  alkanes  naturally  present  in  the  crude  oil  that
crystallize  when  the  oil  is  cooled  below  its  “cloud  point.”  They  are  insoluble  in  acetone  and
dichloromethane  at  30°C.  There  are  two  types  of  petroleum  waxes:  paraffin  and  microcrys-
talline.  Paraffin  waxes  are  high-molecular-weight  normal  alkanes,  and  microcrystalline  waxes
are high-molecular-weight iso-alkanes that have melting points greater than 50°C.

Waxes  by  themselves  are  soluble  in  oil  and,  in  the  absence  of  asphaltenes,  do  not  form
stable emulsions in model oils.15 However, the addition of a nominal amount of asphaltenes (an
amount insufficient by itself to produce emulsions) to oils containing wax can lead to the for-
mation  of  stable  emulsions.  Therefore,  waxes  can  interact  synergetically  with  asphaltenes  to
stabilize emulsions. The physical state of the wax in the crude oil also plays an important role
in emulsion stabilization. Waxes are more apt to form a stable emulsion when they are present
as  fine  solids  in  the  emulsion;  thus,  waxy  emulsions  are  more  likely  at  lower  temperatures.
Waxes, being oil-wet, have a tendency to stabilize water-in-oil emulsions. Crudes that have a

high  cloud  point  generally  have  a  greater  tendency  to  form  stable  and  tight  emulsions  than
crudes  with  low  cloud  points.  Similarly,  lower  temperatures  generally  enhance  the  emulsion-
forming tendencies of crude oils.

Solids.  Fine  solid  particles  present  in  the  crude  oil  are  capable  of  effectively  stabilizing
emulsions. The effectiveness of these solids in stabilizing emulsions depends on factors such as
the solid particle size, interparticle interactions, and the wettability of the solids.8,26,27 Solid par-
ticles  stabilize  emulsions  by  diffusing  to  the  oil/water  interface,  where  they  form  rigid  films
that can sterically inhibit the coalescence of emulsion droplets. Furthermore, solid particles at
the  interface  may  be  electrically  charged,  which  may  also  enhance  the  stability  of  the  emul-
sion. Particles must be much smaller than the size of the emulsion droplets to act as emulsion
stabilizers. Typically these solid particles are submicron to a few microns in diameter.8

The wettability of the particles plays an important role in emulsion stabilization. Wettability
is  the  degree  to  which  a  solid  is  wetted  by  oil  or  water  when  both  are  present.  Fig.  12.19
shows the three cases of wettability in terms of the contact angle. When the contact angle, δ, is
less  than  90°,  the  solid  is  preferentially  oil-wet.  Similarly,  when  the  contact  angle  is  greater
than 90°, the solid is preferentially water-wet. Contact angles close to 90° result in an interme-
diately wetted solid that generally leads to the tightest emulsions. If the solid remains entirely
in the oil or water phase, it will not be an emulsion stabilizer. For the solid to act as an emul-
sion stabilizer, it must be present at the interface and must be wetted by both the oil and water
phases. In general, oil-wet solids stabilize a water-in-oil emulsion. Oil-wet particles preferential-
ly partition into the oil phase and prevent the coalescence of water droplets by steric hindrance.
Similarly, water-wet solids stabilize a water-continuous or an oil-in-water emulsion. Examples
of oil-wet solids are asphaltenes and waxes. Examples of water-wet solids are inorganic scales
(CaCO3, CaSO4), clays, sand, and corrosion products. Water-wet particles can be made oil-wet
with a coating of heavy organic polar compounds.23,24

When solids are wetted by the oil and water (intermediate wettability), they agglomerate at
the interface and retard coalescence. These particles must be repositioned into either the oil or
water for coalescence to take place. This process requires energy and provides a barrier to coa-
lescence.

The role of colloidal solid particles in emulsion stability and the mechanisms involved are

summarized in the following points.8

• The  particles  must  be  present  at  the  oil/water  interface  before  any  stabilization  can  take
place. The ability of the particles to diffuse to the interface and adsorb at the interface depends
on its size, wettability, and the state of dispersion of the solids (whether flocculated or not).

• The ability of the solids to form a rigid, protective film encapsulating the water droplets

is important for stabilizing these emulsions.

• Water-wet particles tend to stabilize oil-in-water emulsions, and oil-wet particles stabilize

water-in-oil emulsions.

Chapter 12—Crude Oil Emulsions

I-547

Fig. 12.20—Droplet stabilization by solids.

• Some degree of particle interaction is necessary for effective stabilization.
The effectiveness of colloidal particles in stabilizing emulsions depends largely on the for-
mation of a densely packed layer of solid particles (film) at the oil/water interface (Fig. 12.20).
This film provides steric hindrance to the coalescence of water droplets. The presence of solids
at the interface also changes the rheological properties of the interface that exhibits viscoelastic
behavior. This affects the rate of film drainage between droplets and also affects the displace-
ment  of  particles  at  the  interface.  It  has  also  been  demonstrated15  that  for  asphaltenes  and
waxes to be effective emulsifiers, they must be present in the form of finely divided submicron
particles.

Temperature.  Temperature  can  affect  emulsion  stability  significantly.  Temperature  affects
the physical properties of oil, water, interfacial films, and surfactant solubilities in the oil and
water  phases.  These,  in  turn,  affect  the  stability  of  the  emulsion.  Perhaps  the  most  important
effect of temperature is on the viscosity of emulsions because viscosity decreases with increas-
ing temperatures (Fig. 12.7). This decrease is mainly because of a decrease in the oil viscosity.
When  waxes  are  present  (the  temperature  of  the  crude  is  below  its  cloud  point)  and  are  the
source of emulsion problems, application of heat can eliminate the problem completely by re-
dissolving  the  waxes  into  the  crude  oil.  Temperature  increases  the  thermal  energy  of  the
droplets and, therefore, increases the frequency of drop collisions. It also reduces the interfacial
viscosity, which results in a faster film-drainage rate and faster drop coalescence.

The effect of temperature on crude oil/water interfacial films was studied in some detail by
Jones  et  al.,12  who  showed  that  an  increase  in  temperature  led  to  a  gradual  destabilization  of
the crude oil/water interfacial films. However, even at higher temperatures, a kinetic barrier to
drop coalescence still exists. Temperature influences the rate of buildup of interfacial films by
changing the adsorption rate and characteristics of the interface. It also influences the film com-
pressibility by changing the solubility of the crude oil surfactants in the bulk phase.

Slow  degassing  (removal  of  light  ends  from  the  crude  oil)  and  aging  lead  to  significant
changes in the interfacial film behavior at high temperatures. The films generated by this pro-
cess remain incompressible and nonrelaxing (solid films) at high temperatures at which emul-
sion resolution is not affected by heating.

Drop Size.  As mentioned earlier, emulsion droplet sizes can range from less than a micron
to  more  than  50  microns.  Fig.  12.5  shows  the  typical  droplet-size  distributions  for  water-in-
crude  oil  emulsion.  Droplet-size  distribution  is  normally  represented  by  a  histogram  or  by  a
distribution function.

Emulsions that have smaller size droplets will generally be more stable. For water separa-
tion, drops must coalesce—and the smaller the drops, the greater the time to separate. The droplet-
size  distribution  affects  emulsion  viscosity  because  it  is  higher  when  droplets  are  smaller.
Emulsion viscosity is also higher when the droplet-size distribution is narrow (i.e., droplet size
is fairly constant).

Fig. 12.21—Effect of pH and demulsifier concentration on emulsion stability.13

pH.  The pH of water has a strong influence on emulsion stability.12–14 The stabilizing, rigid
emulsion film contains organic acids and bases, asphaltenes with ionizable groups, and solids.
Adding  inorganic  acids  and  bases  strongly  influences  their  ionization  in  the  interfacial  films
and radically changes the physical properties of the films. The pH of water affects the rigidity
of  the  interfacial  films.  It  was  reported13  that  interfacial  films  formed  by  asphaltenes  are
strongest in acids (low pH) and become progressively weaker as the pH is increased. In alka-
line medium, the films become very weak or are converted to mobile films. The films formed
by  resins  are  strongest  in  base  and  weakest  in  acid  medium.  Solids  in  the  emulsions  can  be
made  oil-wet  by  asphaltenes,  an  effect  that  is  stronger  in  an  acidic  than  in  a  basic  medium.
These partially oil-wet solids tend to stabilize water-in-oil emulsions.

pH also influences the type of emulsion formed. Acid or low pH generally produces water-
in-oil emulsions (corresponding to oil-wetting solid films), whereas basic or high pH produces
oil-in-water  emulsions  (corresponding  to  water-wetting  mobile  soap  films).  Fig.  12.21  shows
the effect of pH on emulsion stability for a Venezuelan crude.13 Optimum pH for demulsifica-
tion is approximately 10 in the absence of a demulsifier.

Brine  composition  also  has  an  important  effect  (in  relation  to  pH)  on  emulsion  stability.
Fig. 12.22 shows the effect of a bicarbonate brine and distilled water on emulsion stability as a
function of pH.13 Optimal pH for water separation changes from approximately 10 for distilled
water  to  between  6  and  7  for  the  brine  solution  because  of  an  ionization  effect  (association/
interaction of ions present in the brine with the asphaltenes). The study suggests that for most
crude oil/brine systems an optimum pH range exists for which the interfacial film exhibits min-
imum  emulsion-stabilizing  or  maximum  emulsion-breaking  properties.  The  optimum  pH  for
maximum emulsion stability depends on both the crude oil and brine compositions. The latter
seems to be more important.

Frequently, severe emulsion upsets occur in surface-treating facilities following acid stimu-
lation.28–30 It has also been linked to formation damage. Following acid treatment, wells can be
very  slow  to  clean  up,  often  resulting  in  partial  or  complete  plugging  of  the  well.  This  plug-
ging  and  formation  damage  generally  occurs  because  of  solid  precipitates  or  sludges  forming
on contact of the crude oil with the acid. These precipitates are mainly asphaltenes, resins, and
other high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons. These materials are apparently precipitated from the
crude oil by the reduction in pH30 and are among the tightest emulsions produced. Proper de-
sign of the acid treatment is necessary to avoid well productivity decline and emulsion upsets
caused by acidization.29

Brine Composition.   Specific  ions  present  in  the  brine  can  also  influence  interfacial  film
behavior.  The  effect  of  brine  composition  on  interfacial  film  and  emulsion  stability  has  been
reported.12–14 Waters from petroleum formations generally contain many ions. Sodium and chlo-
ride  ions  are  usually  present  in  high  concentrations,  while  other  ions  are  present  in  wide-
ranging  quantities.  At  the  interface,  these  ions  may  react  chemically  with  the  hydrophilic
groups to form insoluble salts. In the studies cited, an insufficient number and variety of crude
oil/brine  systems  were  tested  to  draw  any  concrete  conclusions  regarding  the  effect  of  brine
and its composition on interfacial film and emulsion-stabilizing properties. However, the follow-
ing general trends are noted.

• Brine composition (alkalinity in particular because of a buffering effect) is intimately tied

to the pH in determining the stabilizing properties of the interfacial films.13

• Brines  with  high  Ca++  ions  and  a  high  Ca++/Mg++  ratio  form  nonrelaxing,  rigid  films

around the water droplets, resulting in stable emulsions.12

• Higher concentration of divalent ions and high pH result in reduced emulsion stability.

Many species of polar molecules are present at the interface, and each species responds differ-
ently. Synergistic effects may occur when several different cations are present at the same time.

12.2.3 Stability  Measurement.    From  a  practical  point  of  view,  measurement  of  stability  is
one of the most important tests that can be performed on an emulsion. It determines the ease
with which the oil and water separates in an emulsion. There are numerous methods available
for determining emulsion stability,5 and the most common is the simple bottle test.

The bottle test involves diluting the emulsion with a solvent, mixing in a demulsifier, shak-
ing to disperse the demulsifier, and observing the phase separation as a function of time. The
tests are normally done at elevated temperature and may involve centrifugation to speed up the
separation. While different methods and procedures are followed by various laboratories, there
is a standard ASTM method (ASTM 4007) for determining the bottom sediments and water in
an emulsion. The stability of the emulsion is generally related to the ease of water separation
with time and demulsifier dosage. For example, at a given demulsifier concentration, emulsions
can  be  rated  on  their  stability  by  the  amount  of  water  separated  in  a  given  period  of  time.
Alternatively, for a fixed length of time and a given demulsifier concentration, different demul-
sifiers can be graded in terms of their demulsification qualities. The bottle test is used regularly
as a screening test for potential demulsifiers.

While a standard method is available for determining BS&W, no standard method is avail-
able in the literature for determining the stability of the emulsion with the bottle test. Recently,
a method was proposed31 for measuring the stability of an emulsion quantitatively. The concept

I-550

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

of  an  emulsion  separation  index  was  proposed  to  measure  the  tightness  of  an  emulsion.  The
fraction of the total water separated in a regular bottle test at different demulsifier dosages is
averaged to determine a separation index for the emulsion. The separation index measures from
zero (no separation) to 100% (full separation). The separation index thus provides a measure of
emulsion tightness (or stability): the lower the index, the greater the tightness or stability. The
index must be quoted at the temperature of the test and for a given demulsifier. The index is
very useful for comparing the stability of emulsions from different sources (for example, differ-
ent  wells  or  wet-crude  handling  facilities).  Appendix  A  briefly  describes  the  procedure,  and
Ref. 31 provides additional details.

Other  techniques  also  have  been  used  for  the  measurement  of  emulsion  stability.  A  tech-
nique based on light scattering in crude-oil emulsions was used to measure the coalescence of
water droplets (and, hence, emulsion stability).32 The method can be used to monitor the coales-
cence  action  of  demulsifiers.  Another  technique33  suggests  the  measurement  of  dielectric
constant of oilfield emulsions as a measure of their stability. The dielectric constant, which can
be  measured  readily,  can  be  used  to  characterize  emulsions.  A  change  in  dielectric  constant
with time or demulsifier dosage can be used as a measure of the emulsion stability. This tech-
nique  may  be  used  for  screening,  ranking,  and  selecting  demulsifiers  for  emulsion  resolution.
Recently, electroacoustical techniques5,34 have shown promise for electrokinetic measurement of
colloidal  phenomena  in  emulsions  and  the  rate  of  flocculation  and  coalescence  of  water
droplets  in  water-in-oil  emulsions.  The  technique,  based  on  the  ultrasound  vibration  potential,
which involves the application of a sonic pulse and the detection of an electric field, was used
successfully  in  monitoring  coagulation  in  a  water-in-oil  emulsion.5  Another  technique  devel-
oped recently used critical electric field measurements for emulsion stability.35

12.3 Demulsification
Demulsification is the breaking of a crude oil emulsion into oil and water phases. From a pro-
cess point of view, the oil producer is interested in three aspects of demulsification: the rate or
the speed at which this separation takes place, the amount of water left in the crude oil after
separation,  and  the  quality  of  separated  water  for  disposal.  A  fast  rate  of  separation,  a  low
value of residual water in the crude oil, and a low value of oil in the disposal water are obvi-
ously  desirable.  Produced  oil  generally  has  to  meet  company  and  pipeline  specifications.  For
example,  the  oil  shipped  from  wet-crude  handling  facilities  must  not  contain  more  than  0.2%
BS&W and 10 pounds of salt per thousand barrels of crude oil. This standard depends on com-
pany and pipeline specifications. The salt is insoluble in oil and associated with residual water
in the treated crude. Low BS&W and salt content is required to reduce corrosion and deposi-
tion of salts. The primary concern in refineries is to remove inorganic salts from the crude oil
before  they  cause  corrosion  or  other  detrimental  effects  in  refinery  equipment.  The  salts  are
removed by washing or desalting the crude oil with relatively fresh water.

12.3.1 Destabilizing  Emulsions.    As  mentioned  previously,  produced  oilfield  emulsions  pos-
sess  some  kinetic  stability.  This  stability  arises  from  the  formation  of  interfacial  films  that
encapsulate the water droplets. To separate this emulsion into oil and water, the interfacial film
must be destroyed and the droplets made to coalesce. Therefore, destabilizing or breaking emul-
sions  is  linked  directly  to  the  removal  of  this  interfacial  film.  The  factors  that  affect  the
interfacial  film  and,  consequently,  the  stability  of  the  emulsions  were  discussed  earlier.  The
factors that enhance or speed up emulsion breaking are discussed here.

Temperature.  Application of heat promotes oil/water separation and accelerates the treating

process. An increase in temperature has the following effects.

• Reduces the viscosity of the oil.
• Increases the mobility of the water droplets.
• Increases the settling rate of water droplets.

Chapter 12—Crude Oil Emulsions

I-551

• Increases droplet collisions and favors coalescence.
• Weakens or ruptures the film on water droplets because of water expansion and enhances

film drainage and coalescence.

• Increases the difference in densities of the fluids that further enhances water-settling time

and separation.
All  these  factors  favor  emulsion  destabilization  and  oil/water  separation;  however,  heat  by  it-
self is not a cure-all and even has some disadvantages (e.g., loss of light ends from the crude
oil).  An  economic  analysis  should  be  performed  that  takes  into  consideration  factors  such  as
heating costs, reduced treating time, and residual water in the crude. An increase in tempera-
ture  also  can  be  achieved  by  burying  crude-oil  pipelines  or  by  insulating  them.  These  factors
should be evaluated carefully during development, especially at facilities where emulsion prob-
lems are anticipated.

Agitation or Shear.  Generally, reducing agitation or shear reduces emulsion stability. Very
high shear is detrimental and should be avoided. High shear causes violent mixing of oil and
water and leads to smaller droplet sizes. Smaller droplets are relatively more stable than larger
droplets;  therefore,  measures  that  increase  shearing  of  the  crude  oil  (for  example,  mechanical
chokes, valves, flow obstructions, and pressure drops) should be avoided or minimized where
possible.  However,  a  certain  amount  of  shear  is  required  for  mixing  the  chemical  demulsifier
into the bulk of the emulsion.

Residence or Retention Time.  The period of time that the emulsion is held at the treating
temperature is the residence, retention, or treating time. This typically is between 10 to 30 min-
utes  for  normal  crude  oil  production;  however,  it  may  need  to  be  much  longer  to  treat  tight
emulsions effectively. An increase in residence time increases the separation efficiency and re-
duces the residual amount of water in the crude. Increasing residence time, however, comes at
the expense of high separator-equipment costs.

Solids Removal.  Solids have a strong tendency to stabilize emulsions, especially if they are
present as fines or when they are wetted by both oil and water. Removing the solids or their
source is sometimes all that is required for eliminating or reducing the emulsion problem. Oil-
wet  solids  stabilize  water-in-oil  emulsions.  Water-wet  solids  can  also  be  made  oil-wet  with  a
coating of heavy polar materials and can participate effectively in the stabilization of water-in-
oil emulsions.23,24 The presence of solid asphaltenes and waxes has a definite detrimental effect
on  the  emulsion  problem,  and  every  effort  should  be  made  to  eliminate  their  presence  in  the
crude  oil.  The  solids  can  be  removed  by  dispersing  them  into  the  oil  or  can  be  water-wetted
and removed with the water.

Control of Emulsifying Agents.  Because emulsifying agents are necessary in the stabiliza-
tion of emulsions, controlling them allows for their destabilization and resolution. Some of the
ways to control emulsifiers include the following processes.

• Careful  selection  of  chemicals  that  are  injected  during  oil  production.  The  chemicals  in-
clude,  for  example,  acids  and  additives  during  acidization,  corrosion  inhibitors  for  corrosion
protection, surfactants and dispersants for organic- and inorganic-deposition control, and poly-
mers  and  blocking  agents  for  water-production  control.  Laboratory  compatibility  testing  of
these chemicals should be conducted before field injection to avoid tight emulsions.

• Avoiding incompatible crude-oil blends. A crude-oil blend is incompatible if it results in
the precipitation of solids (organic and inorganic). This occurs, for example, when an asphaltic
crude  oil  is  mixed  with  a  paraffinic  crude  oil,  resulting  in  the  precipitation  of  asphaltenes.
Again, laboratory testing can identify incompatible crudes.

• Use  of  dispersants  for  controlling  the  precipitation  of  asphaltenes  and  the  use  of  pour-
point  depressants  for  controlling  waxes.  Alternatively,  emulsion  stability  can  be  controlled  by
raising the temperature of the crude above its cloud point.

I-552

• Neutralizing the effect of stabilizing film encapsulating the water droplets by demulsifiers.

These chemicals promote coalescence of water droplets and accelerate water separation.

Retrofitting.  Additional water separation can be achieved by retrofitting the existing equip-
ment. Invariably, emulsion problems increase after the separation equipment has been installed
because of field aging, increased watercuts, improper design, or several other reasons. Addition-
al equipment (for example, free-water knockout drums and heater treaters) can be installed to
assist in the breaking of oilfield emulsions. Internals can also be installed or retrofitted in pro-
duction-separation traps. The most common retrofitting is the installation of a coalescer section
that assists in coalescing water droplets. There are several options available, and re-engineering
is generally required on a case-by-case basis. The chapter on emulsion treating in the Facilities
section of this Handbook provides further information.

12.3.2 Mechanisms Involved in Demulsification.  Demulsification, the separation of an emul-
sion  into  its  component  phases,  is  a  two-step  process.  The  first  step  is  flocculation  (aggrega-
tion, agglomeration, or coagulation). The second step is coalescence. Either of these steps can
be the rate-determining step in emulsion breaking.

Flocculation or Aggregation.  The first step in demulsification is the flocculation of water
droplets. During flocculation, the droplets clump together, forming aggregates or “floccs.” The
droplets are close to each other, even touching at certain points, but do not lose their identity
(i.e., they may not coalesce). Coalescence at this stage only takes place if the emulsifier film
surrounding the water droplets is very weak. The rate of flocculation depends on the following
factors.15

• Water  content  in  the  emulsion.  The  rate  of  flocculation  is  higher  when  the  water  cut  is

• Temperature  of  the  emulsion  is  high.  Temperature  increases  the  thermal  energy  of  the

droplets and increases their collision probability, thus leading to flocculation.

• Viscosity of the oil is low, which reduces the settling time and increases the flocculation

higher.

rate.

• Density difference between oil and water is high, which increases the sedimentation rate.
• An electrostatic field is applied. This increases the movement of droplets toward the elec-

trodes, where they aggregate.

Coalescence.  Coalescence is the second step in demulsification. During coalescence, water
droplets  fuse  or  coalesce  together  to  form  a  larger  drop.  This  is  an  irreversible  process  that
leads to a decrease in the number of water droplets and eventually to complete demulsification.
Coalescence is enhanced by the following factors.5,15

• High rate of flocculation increases the collision frequency between droplets.
• The absence of mechanically strong films that stabilize emulsions.
• High interfacial tension. The system tries to reduce its interfacial free energy by coalescing.
• High water cut increases the frequency of collisions between droplets.
• Low interfacial viscosity enhances film drainage and drop coalescence.
• Chemical demulsifiers convert solid films to mobile soap films that are weak and can be

ruptured easily, which promotes coalescence.

• High temperatures reduce the oil and interfacial viscosities and increase the droplet colli-

sion frequency.

Sedimentation  or  Creaming.    Sedimentation  is  the  process  in  which  water  droplets  settle
down in an emulsion because of their higher density. Its inverse process, creaming, is the ris-
ing  of  oil  droplets  in  the  water  phase.  Sedimentation  and  creaming  are  driven  by  the  density
difference  between  oil  and  water  and  may  not  result  in  the  breaking  of  an  emulsion.  Unre-
solved  emulsion  droplets  accumulate  at  the  oil/water  interface  in  surface  equipment  and  form

time.

an  emulsion  pad  or  rag  layer.  A  pad  in  surface  equipment  causes  several  problems  including
the following.

• Occupies  space  in  the  separation tank  and  effectively reduces  the  retention or  separation

• Increases the BS&W of the treated oil.
• Increases the residual oil in the treated water.
• Increases arcing incidences or equipment upset frequency.
• Creates a barrier for water droplets and solids migrating down into the bulk water layer.

Emulsion pads are caused or exacerbated by ineffective demulsifier (unable to resolve the emul-
sion);  insufficient  demulsifier  (insufficient  quantities  to  break  the  emulsion  effectively);  other
chemicals that nullify the effect of the demulsifier; low temperatures; and the presence of accu-
mulating solids. Because emulsion pads cause several operational problems, their cause should
be determined and appropriate actions taken to eliminate them.

12.3.3 Methods of Emulsion Breaking or Demulsification.  In the oil industry, crude-oil emul-
sions  must  be  separated  almost  completely  before  the  oil  can  be  transported  and  processed
further. Emulsion separation into oil and water requires the destabilization of emulsifying films
around water droplets. This process is accomplished by any, or a combination, of the following
methods:

• Adding chemical demulsifiers.
• Increasing the temperature of the emulsion.
• Applying electrostatic fields that promote coalescence.
• Reducing the flow velocity that allows gravitational separation of oil, water, and gas. This

is generally accomplished in large-volume separators and desalters.

Demulsification methods are application specific because of the wide variety of crude oils,
brines,  separation  equipment,  chemical  demulsifiers,  and  product  specifications.  Furthermore,
emulsions  and  conditions  change  over  time,  which  adds  to  the  complexity  of  the  treatment.
The most common method of emulsion treatment is the application of heat and an appropriate
chemical  demulsifier  to  promote  destabilization,  followed  by  a  settling  time  with  electrostatic
grids to promote gravitational separation.

Thermal Methods.  Heating reduces the oil viscosity and increases the water-settling rates.
Increased  temperatures  also  result  in  the  destabilization  of  the  rigid  films  because  of  reduced
interfacial viscosity. Furthermore, the coalescence frequency of water droplets is increased be-
cause  of  the  higher  thermal  energy  of  the  droplets.  In  other  words,  heat  accelerates  emulsion
breaking; however, it very rarely resolves the emulsion problem alone. Increasing the tempera-
ture  has  some  negative  effects.  First,  it  costs  money  to  heat  the  emulsion  stream.  Second,
heating can result in the loss of light ends from the crude oil, reducing its API gravity and the
treated  oil  volume.  Finally,  increasing  the  temperature  leads  to  an  increased  tendency  toward
some forms of scale deposition and an increased potential for corrosion in treating vessels.

The application of heat for emulsion breaking should be based on an overall economic anal-
ysis of the treatment facility. The cost-effectiveness of adding heat should be balanced against
longer  treatment  time  (larger  separator),  loss  of  light  ends  and  a  resultant  lower  oil-product
price, chemical costs, and the costs of electrostatic grid installation or retrofitting.

Mechanical Methods.  There is a wide variety of mechanical equipment available for break-
ing  oilfield  emulsions  including  free-water  knockout  drums,  two-  and  three-phase  separators
(low- and high-pressure traps), desalters, settling tanks, etc. See the chapter on emulsion treat-
ing  in  the  Facilities  section  of  this  Handbook  for  a  detailed  description  of  emulsion-treating
equipment.

Free-Water Knockout Drums.  Free-water knockout drums separate the free water from the
crude oil/water mixture. Some of the associated gases may be separated in these drums. Free-

I-554

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

water knockout drums are supplementary equipment that aid in the treatment of produced crude
oil emulsions.

Production Traps or Three-Phase Separators.  Three-phase separators or production traps are
used  to  separate  the  produced  fluids  into  oil,  water,  and  gas.  These  separators  can  be  either
horizontal or vertical in configuration. Each separator is sized with a set retention time to pro-
vide  adequate  separation  at  a  given  throughput  rate.  The  separator  may  include  a  heater
section, wash water, a filter section, a coalescing or stabilizing section, and electrostatic grids.
Fig. 12.23 shows a typical three-phase separator.36 There is a large variety of separators in use
today.  For  example,  a  separator  may  have  a  large  heater  section  or  may  have  no  coalescer
packing. Selecting the right separator for any given set of conditions is a complex engineering
task that depends on several factors.

Oil/water separation is usually based on a gravitational separation. Because water has a high-
er density than oil, water droplets have a tendency to settle down. Stokes’ Law approximates
the settling rate of water droplets.

2gr2(ρw − ρo)

9μ

v =

, ......................................................... (12.2)

where v is the settling velocity of the water droplets, g is the acceleration caused by of gravity,
r  is  the  radius  of  the  droplets,  (ρw − ρo)  is  the  density  difference  between  the  water  and  oil,
and μ is the oil viscosity. Stokes’ Law suggests that the settling velocity is increased by increas-
ing  the  density  difference  between  water  and  oil,  reducing  the  viscosity,  and  increasing  the
drop size. However, Stokes’ Law should be applied to emulsions with caution. Increasing the
coalescence rate increases the droplet size and has the strongest effect on the settling velocity.
While  it  is  true  that  larger  diameter  droplets  settle  faster,  emulsifiers  prevent  droplet  coales-
cence in an actual treating system. Another important consideration is that Stokes’ Law applies
only  to  a  static  system  with  nondeforming  droplets.  Both  these  assumptions  are  not  true  in
complex emulsion-treating equipment. It is a dynamic system, and where the motion is vigor-
ous, re-emulsification is possible. Stokes’ Law also applies only to isolated particles or, in this
application, to dilute emulsions.

A degree of flexibility in the separator design, with options to modify, is the best strategy
when designing emulsion-treatment separators. Operating conditions (such as pressures, temper-
atures,  water  cuts,  and  oil/brine  compositions)  change  during  the  life  of  the  field,  and  the
equipment should be able to handle these changes or be modified to account for them.

One way to improve the efficiency of separators is to install coalescer packs. These packs
increase the travel of the fluid through the separator. The wiping or rolling action of the emul-
sion as it passes through the packing or baffles causes the water droplets to coalesce. Spreaders
also can be installed to increase the collision frequency between droplets.

Desalters.  The oil from the separator is generally “off-spec” (i.e., it still contains unaccept-
ably  high  levels  of  water  and  solids).  It  must  be  further  treated  to  meet  crude  specifications.
For the refinery, the salt level must be further reduced. Refinery crude should contain no more
that  a  specified  amount  of  inorganic  solids  (salts).  This  is  generally  expressed  in  pounds  per
thousand  barrels.  The  industry  standard  is  1  pound  per  thousand  barrels.  The  removal  of  the
salts, along with the remaining water, is the process of desalting.

Desalters  are  normally  designed  as  either  one-stage  or  multistage  desalters.  Fig.  12.24
shows a schematic of a one-stage desalter. Generally, desalters use a combination of chemical
addition,  electrostatic  treating,  and  settling  time.  The  retention  time  is  based  on  a  certain  oil
specification for a given product rate. Also, fresh water (wash water) is added with the chemi-

cals to reduce the concentrations of dissolved salt (by diluting) in the treated water and, hence,
the outgoing crude.

Desalter  performance  is  generally  optimized  by  a  careful  manipulation  of  system  parame-
ters.  Operational  data  are  obtained  by  altering  the  system  parameters  and  monitoring  their
effect  on  the  quality  of  oil  (or  water/salt  removal).  Optimum  set  points  can  be  obtained  for
operating  temperatures,  interface  level,  treating  chemicals,  wash-water  rates  and  injection
points, and mix valves settings.

Electrical Methods.  Electrostatic  grids  are  sometimes  used  for  emulsion  treatment.  High-
voltage electricity (electrostatic grids) is often an effective means of breaking emulsions. It is
generally  theorized  that  water  droplets  have  an  associated  net  charge,  and  when  an  electric
field is applied, the droplets move about rapidly and collide with each other and coalesce. The
electric field also disturbs the interfacial film by rearranging the polar molecules, thereby weak-
ening the rigid film and enhancing coalescence. Fig. 12.23 shows a cross section of a typical
electrostatic treater36 (a three-phase separator, in this case). The electrical system consists of a
transformer  and  electrodes  that  provide  high-voltage  alternating  current.  The  electrodes  are
placed to provide an electric field that is perpendicular to the direction of flow. The distance
between the electrodes is often adjustable so that the voltage can be varied to meet the require-
ment of the emulsion being treated.

Electrostatic dehydration generally is used with chemical and heat addition. Invariably, the
use of electrostatic dehydration results in reduced heat requirements. Lower temperatures result
in fuel economy, reduced problems with scale and corrosion formation, and reduced light-end
loss. Electrostatic grids can also lead to a reduction in the use of emulsion-breaking chemicals.
The  one  limitation  of  electrostatic  dehydration  is  shorting/arcing,  which  generally  happens
when excess water is present. Recent designs in electrostatic grids have eliminated shorting/arcing.
Chemical Methods.  The  most  common  method  of  emulsion  treatment  is  adding  demulsi-
fiers.  These  chemicals  are  designed  to  neutralize  the  stabilizing  effect  of  emulsifying  agents.
Demulsifiers are surface-active compounds that, when added to the emulsion, migrate to the oil/
water interface, rupture or weaken the rigid film, and enhance water droplet coalescence. Opti-
mum emulsion breaking with a demulsifier requires a properly selected chemical for the given
emulsion; adequate quantity of this chemical; adequate mixing of the chemical in the emulsion;
and sufficient retention time in separators to settle water droplets. It may also require the addi-
tion of heat, electric grids, and coalescers to facilitate or completely resolve the emulsion.

Chemical Selection.31,37–40  Selection of the right demulsifier is crucial to emulsion breaking.
The  selection  process  for  chemicals  is  still  viewed  as  an  art  rather  than  a  science.  However,

Chapter 12—Crude Oil Emulsions

I-557

with  the  increasing  understanding  of  emulsion  mechanisms,  the  availability  of  new  and  im-
proved chemicals, and new technology, research, and development efforts, selection of the right
chemical is becoming more scientific. Many of the failures of the past have been eliminated.

Demulsifier  chemicals  contain  the  following  components:  solvents,  surface-active  ingredi-
ents,  and  flocculants.  Solvents,  such  as  benzene,  toluene,  xylene,  short-chain  alcohols,  and
heavy  aromatic  naptha,  are  generally  carriers  for  the  active  ingredients  of  the  demulsifier.
Some solvents change the solubility conditions of the natural emulsifiers (e.g., asphaltenes) that
are accumulated at the oil/brine interface. These solvents dissolve the indigenous surface-active
agents back into the bulk phase, affecting the properties of the interfacial film that can facili-
tate coalescence and water separation.

Surface-active ingredients are chemicals that have surface-active properties characterized by
hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values. For a definition and description of HLB, see Ref.
5. The HLB scale varies from 0 to 20. A low HLB value refers to a hydrophilic or water-solu-
ble  surfactant.  In  general,  natural  emulsifiers  that  stabilize  a  water-in-oil  emulsion  exhibit  an
HLB value in the range of 3 to 8.5 Thus, demulsifiers with a high HLB value will destabilize
these emulsions. The demulsifiers act by total or partial displacement of the indigenous stabiliz-
ing interfacial film components (polar materials) around the water droplets. This displacement
also brings about a change in properties such as interfacial viscosity or elasticity of the protect-
ing film, thus enhancing destabilization. In some cases, demulsifiers act as a wetting agent and
change the wettability of the stabilizing particles, leading to a breakup of the emulsion film.

Flocculants  are  chemicals  that  flocculate  the  water  droplets  and  facilitate  coalescence.  A
detailed  process  for  selecting  the  appropriate  demulsifier  chemicals,  described  in  Ref.  5,  in-
cludes the following steps.

• Characterization of the crude oil and contaminants includes the API gravity of the crude
oil, type and composition of oil and brine, inorganic solids, amount and type of salts, contami-
nant type and amounts.

• Evaluation of operational data includes production rates, treating-vessel capabilities (resi-
dence  time,  electrostatic  grids,  temperature  limitations,  etc.),  operating  pressures  and  tempera-
tures,  chemical  dosage  equipment  and  injection  points,  sampling  locations,  maintenance
frequency, and wash-water rates.

• Evaluation of emulsion-breaking performance: past experience and operating data includ-
ing  oil,  water,  and  solids  content  during  different  tests;  composition  and  quality  of  interface
fluids; operating costs; and amounts of water generated and its disposal.

Testing procedures are available to select appropriate chemicals.31 These tests include bottle
tests, dynamic simulators, and actual plant tests. All test procedures have limitations. Hundreds
of  commercial  demulsifier  products  are  available  that  may  be  tested.  Changing  conditions  at
separation facilities result in a very slow selection process, especially at large facilities; there-
fore,  it  is  important  at  such  facilities  to  maintain  a  record  of  operational  data  and  testing
procedures as an ongoing activity.

Mixing/Agitation.    For  the  demulsifier  to  work  effectively,  it  must  make  intimate  contact
with the emulsion and reach the oil/water interface. Adequate mixing or agitation must be pro-
vided  to  thoroughly  mix  the  chemical  into  the  emulsion.  This  agitation  promotes  droplet
coalescence; therefore, the  point  at  which  the  demulsifier is  added  is  critical. Once  the  emul-
sion  has  broken,  agitation  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum  to  prevent  re-emulsification.  There
should be sufficient agitation in the flow stream to allow the chemical to mix thoroughly, fol-
lowed by a period of gentle flow inside the separator to promote gravity separation.

Dosage.  The amount of chemical added is also important. Too little demulsifier will leave
the emulsion unresolved. Conversely, a large dose of demulsifier (an overtreat condition) may
be detrimental. Because demulsifiers are surface-active agents like the emulsifiers, excess demul-

sifier may produce very stable emulsions. The demulsifier simply replaces the natural emulsi-
fiers at the interface.

It is difficult to prescribe standard or typical dosage rates for treating emulsions because of
the wide variety of demulsifier chemicals available, the different types of crude being handled,
the choice of separation equipment, and the variations in product qualities. Furthermore, some
of  the  chemicals  come  in  different  concentrations  (active  ingredient  in  a  carrier  solvent).  The
amount or dosage of demulsifier required is very site-specific and depends on several factors,
some of which are discussed in this chapter. On the basis of an evaluation of the literature, the
demulsifier rates quoted vary from less than 10 to more than 100 ppm (based on total produc-
tion  rates).  These  numbers  are  provided  for  primary  or  secondary  oil-recovery  emulsions.
During tertiary oil recovery (especially during surfactant or micellar flooding), demulsifier rates
typically can be in the hundreds of ppm and even higher in extreme cases.

Factors Affecting Demulsifier Efficiency.  Several factors affect demulsifier performance in-
cluding temperature, pH, type of crude oil, brine composition, and droplet size and distribution.
As described previously, an increase in temperature results in a decrease in emulsion stability,
and, hence, a lower dosage of demulsifier is required. pH also affects demulsifier performance.
Generally, basic pH promotes oil-in-water emulsions and acidic pH produces water-in-oil emul-
sions.  High  pH,  therefore,  helps  in  destabilizing  water-in-oil  emulsions.  It  has  also  been
reported that basic pH reduces demulsifier dosage13 requirements (see Fig. 12.21).

Demulsifiers  that  work  for  a  given  emulsion  may  be  completely  ineffective  for  another.
Demulsifiers are typically formulated with polymeric chains of ethylene oxides and polypropyl-
ene  oxides  of  alcohol,  ethoxylated  phenols,  ethoxylated  alcohols  and  amines,  ethoxylated
resins,  ethoxylated  nonylphenols,  polyhydric  alcohols,  and  sulphonic  acid  salts.  Fig.  12.25
shows  typical  demulsifier  molecular  formulas.  Commercial  demulsifiers  may  contain  one  or
more types of active ingredient. There is a wide variation within the active ingredient type as
well. For example, the molecular weight and structure of the ethylene or propylene oxides can
be  changed  to  effect  a  complete  range  of  solubilities,  HLBs,  charge  neutralization  tendencies,
solids-wetting characteristics, and costs.

The demulsifier displaces the indigenous surfactants in the interfacial film.

Mechanisms Involved in Chemical Demulsification.  Chemical  demulsification  is  very  com-
plex. There are several hypotheses and theories regarding the physicochemical mechanism for
the  action  of  a  chemical  demulsifier.22  The  only  clear  generalization  regarding  demulsifiers  is
that they have a high molecular weight (about the same as natural surfactants) and, when used
as emulsifying agents, they tend to establish an emulsion opposite in type to that stabilized by
natural surfactants. There are thousands of products that have been patented as crude oil demul-
sifiers.  A  detailed  knowledge  of  the  functionality  of  demulsifiers  and  their  effectiveness  in
breaking emulsions is still lacking; however, there are a few general rules for chemical demul-
sifiers and their ability in breaking emulsions.41

Several studies have been conducted on certain aspects of the chemical demulsification pro-
cess.7,12,16,22,37–47 It has been suggested39 that demulsifiers displace the natural stabilizers present
in  the  interfacial  film  around  the  water  droplets.  This  displacement  is  brought  about  by  the
adsorption of the demulsifier at the interface and influences the coalescence of water droplets
through enhanced film drainage.

Fig.  12.26  shows  the  film  drainage  process  schematically.  When  two  droplets  approach
each  other,  the  thickness  of  the  interfacial  film  decreases  as  the  liquid  flows  out  of  the  film.
This sets up an IFT gradient with high IFT inside the film and low IFT outside the film. The
interfacial  viscosity  is  very  high  because  of  the  adsorbed  natural  surfactants  (asphaltenes).
Demulsifier  molecules  have  a  higher  surface  activity  than  natural  surfactants  and,  therefore,
replace  them  at  the  interface.  When  demulsifier  molecules  are  adsorbed  in  the  spaces  left  by
the natural surfactants, the IFT gradient is reversed, film drainage is enhanced, and the interfa-
cial viscosity is reduced.44,45 This causes the film to become very thin and collapse, resulting in
droplet  coalescence.  The  efficiency  of  the  demulsifier  thus  depends  on  its  adsorption  at  the
droplet surface. There is competition for adsorption when other surface-active species are present.
39  The  indigenous  surfactants,  like  asphaltenes,  present  in  the  crude  oil  are  only  weakly  ad-
sorbed and are readily displaced by the demulsifier.

Because  of  the  large  variety  of  components  in  the  crude  oil,  it  is  not  surprising  that  the
effectiveness of a given demulsifier is sensitive to the crude oil type. In addition, the adsorp-
tion  and  displacement  processes  and,  hence,  the  demulsifier  effectiveness  also  depend  on  pH,
salt  content,  and  temperature.  The  best  demulsifiers  are  those  that  readily  displace  preformed
rigid  films  and  leave  mobile  films  (films  that  exhibit  little  resistance  to  coalescence)  in  their
place.

Besides  displacing  the  natural  surfactants  at  the  interface  (breaking  the  rigid  film),  many
chemical additives reduce or inhibit the rate of buildup of interfacial films. The best demulsi-
fiers  should  possess  both  types  of  film  modifying  behavior:  displacement  of  components  in
rigid interfacial films and inhibition of the formation of the rigid films.

I-560

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

The  demulsifier  effectiveness  also  depends  on  its  dosage.  An  increase  in  demulsification
rate is generally observed with increasing demulsifier concentration up to a critical concentra-
tion (the critical aggregation concentration). This is attributed to a monolayer adsorption of the
demulsifier at the interface (simultaneously displacing the indigenous crude oil surfactant film).
Higher  concentrations  beyond  this  critical  concentration  (overdosing)  result  in  two  different
types of behavior.39,42 Type I behavior is the leveling of the demulsification rate with increased
demulsifier concentration. This type of behavior is attributed to the formation of a liquid crys-
talline phase. Type II behavior is a reduction in demulsification rate with increased demulsifier
concentration. This type of behavior is attributed to steric stabilization of grown water droplets
and  is  detrimental  to  demulsification  because  it  retards  the  separation  rate  during  overdosing.
The  type  of  behavior  observed  depends  on  the  concentration  and  type  of  demulsifier.  Some
demulsifiers form aggregates in water or oil to give a viscous phase, while others may stabilize
the emulsion sterically.

The solubility of the demulsifier in oil and water, or its partitioning, is also very crucial in
determining the effectiveness of the demulsifier. The partitioning of the surfactant is measured
either  by  the  partition  coefficient  or  by  its  HLB  value.  Several  studies33,38,41,44,45  have  tried  to
link  the  demulsifier  effectiveness  to  its  partition  coefficient.  For  the  demulsifier  to  be  fairly
active,  it  must  be  an  amphiphile  with  a  partition  coefficient  of  unity44,45  (i.e.,  the  demulsifier
should partition equally between the oil and water phases). The surface adsorption rate is faster
when the demulsifier has a partition coefficient of close to one. Because of this criterion and
the fact that demulsifiers are added to the continuous oil phase, demulsifiers that are soluble in
water only (low partition coefficient or low HLB) are not very effective in breaking water-in-
oil  emulsions.  Oil  solubility  is  important  because  oil  forms  the  continuous  phase,  permits  a
thorough  distribution  of  the  demulsifier  in  the  emulsion,  and  affects  its  diffusion  to  the  oil/
water  interface.  When  this  demulsifier  reaches  the  interface,  it  must  partition  into  the  water
phase (droplets) to displace the natural stabilizers at the interface effectively. This results in a
reduction of interfacial viscosity and a change in the IFT gradient, both of which enhance film
thinning and water droplets coalescence.

To ensure good overall performance, a demulsifier should meet the following criteria.44
• Dissolve in the continuous oil phase.
• Have  a  concentration  large  enough  to  diffuse  to  the  oil/water  interface.  However,  it

should not be higher than the critical aggregate concentration.

• Partition into the water phase (partition coefficient close to unity).
• Possess a high rate of adsorption at the interface.
• Have  an  interfacial  activity  high  enough  to  suppress  the  IFT  gradient,  thus  accelerating

the rate of film drainage and promoting coalescence.

12.4 Special Topics in Crude Oil Emulsions

12.4.1 Emulsion Sampling.  Samples of the emulsion may be required for several reasons in-
cluding  crude  specification  verification,  performance  evaluation  of  the  emulsion-treating  sys-
tem, or simply for laboratory testing. Invariably, the emulsion to be sampled is under pressure,
and  special procedures  must  be  used  to  obtain representative samples.  For  crude  specification
testing, it is not important to maintain the integrity of the water droplets; however, the sample
location point may be critical. In general, samples should not be withdrawn from the bottom of
the  pipe  or  vessel.  Free  water  may  be  present  and  accumulate  at  the  bottom  of  the  pipe  or
vessel, affecting the BS&W reading. Neither should the sample be withdrawn from the top of
the  vessel  because  it  primarily  will  be  oil.  The  best  position  in  the  pipe  to  take  an  emulsion
sample  is  on  the  side,  preferably  with  a  quill.  Turbulence  and  high  fluid  velocity  in  the  pipe
may also ensure that the sample is homogenous and representative.

Chapter 12—Crude Oil Emulsions

I-561

Fig. 12.27—Sampling of a high-pressure emulsion.

Every  effort  should  be  made  to  obtain  a  sample  that  closely  represents  the  liquid  from
which  it  is  taken.  This  is  especially  true  of  liquids  under  pressure.  Emulsification  should  not
occur during the sampling itself. For example, samples obtained at the wellhead or production
headers may show a high percentage of emulsion, whereas the actual oil and water inside the
piping  may  or  may  not  be  in  the  form  of  an  emulsion.  This  indicates  that  the  emulsification
was a consequence of the sampling because the sample was depressurized into the sample con-
tainer.

A special procedure is used to obtain representative samples from pressurized sources with-
out further emulsification of the liquids. Fig. 12.27 shows a floating piston cylinder used in the
procedure.  The  cylinder  is  first  evacuated  and  filled  with  a  pressurizing  fluid  (for  example,
glycol or a synthetic oil) on one side of the floating piston. The top of the cylinder (evacuated
side)  is  then  connected  to  the  sampling  location  from  which  the  sample  is  to  be  taken.  The
bottom valve on the cylinder is closed and the top valve slowly opened to pressurize the fluid
in the cylinder. This is usually a small amount because of the low compressibility of the liquid
in the cylinder. Once the top valve is completely open, the bottom valve is opened very slowly
to  drain  the  pressurizing  liquid  while  allowing  the  sample  liquid  to  be  taken  in  from  the  top
into  the  cylinder.  The  procedure  should  be  performed  slowly  to  obtain  the  sample  without  a
pressure drop between the cylinder and the sampling location. Another variation of the method
is  to  charge  the  sample  into  a  simple  cylinder,  without  a  floating  piston,  filled  with  water  or
mercury. Once the sample is captured, the cylinder can be depressurized extremely slowly with
little effect on the sample. In situations in which this procedure is not possible, the best sam-
pling method is to bleed the sample line very slowly into the sample container. The idea is to
minimize shear and reduce emulsification that may be caused by the sampling procedures.

12.4.2 Field Emulsion-Treatment Program.  There is a lack of specific case studies on emul-
sion treatment in the open literature for the following reasons.

• An emulsion treatment program is very site-specific. Each producing system is unique and

is reviewed individually for solutions.

I-562

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

• Traditionally,  demulsifier  selection  has  been  conducted  by  the  chemical  service  compa-
nies, who have been reluctant to part with the information. This has also been, in part, because
of the lack of understanding of emulsion treatment.

• Chemical selection has been viewed as a “black art”5 that has produced as many failures

as successes.

• The  scope  of  emulsion  treatment  is  very  broad,  and  it  is  usually  difficult  to  address  the

complexities in generalized studies. Parts of the specifics have been reported extensively.

• Most of the operating oil companies have some sort of optimization programs for emul-

sion treatment. In general, this includes addition of chemicals, heat, and retrofitting.

The design of emulsion-treating equipment and procedures for a given field or application
requires experience and engineering judgment. The engineer must rely on laboratory data, data
from nearby wells or fields, and experience. There is no standard solution available for striking
a  balance  between,  for  example,  the  amount  of  chemical  and  heat  to  resolve  emulsions.  The
greater the treatment temperature, the lower the amount of demulsifier needed. In general, eco-
nomic  analysis  dictates  the  type  and  size  of  equipment  used  and  the  balance  between  the
amount of chemical used and heating requirements. In some cases, crude oil specifications may
decide the system to be used for emulsion treatment. Other factors include internal packing and
the  size  of  the  equipment.  The  savings  in  equipment  cost  must  be  balanced  against  the  in-
creased capital and operating costs of the packing or coalescing grids.

Laboratory bottle tests can provide an estimate of treating temperatures and retention times
that  can  be  used  for  design  and  operation;  however,  these  tests  are  done  under  static  condi-
tions, and field usage is dynamic. Demulsifier dosages, for example, generally are much greater
in  the  static  bottle  tests  than  during  field  conditions.  However,  laboratory  testing  is  excellent
for screening different emulsion samples for relative tightness, evaluating prospective demulsi-
fiers, and evaluating the effects of different variables on emulsion resolution.

General  guidelines  for  an  emulsion-treatment  program  in  the  field  include  the  following

points.

• Each producing stream is unique and must be evaluated individually to determine the best
separation strategy. Laboratory tests should be conducted with actual samples to determine the
tightness of the emulsions; however, data from nearby wells and fields can be used as estimates.
• During the early design of the separation facility, planning for future emulsion treatment
should  begin.  For  example,  if  water  cuts  are  anticipated  to  increase,  appropriate  measures
should be taken in the design phase of the equipment or handling facilities for increased water
handling.

• Operational experience and laboratory work are needed to substantiate emulsion concerns
and identify solutions. Pilot and plant tests should determine the actual treatment requirements.
As noted previously, bottle tests have limitations in determining dosage but are good for screen-
ing and trend analysis.

• Treatment  capacities  can  be  increased  for  existing  separator  trains  by  re-engineering  and
retrofitting. For example, internal packing can be installed in the separator for improving emul-
sion resolution. See the chapter on emulsion treating in the Facilities section of this Handbook
for additional details.

• For existing systems, demulsifier and other relevant operational data (production rates, wa-
ter  cuts,  temperatures,  and  costs)  should  be  recorded  over  time.  These  data  can  be  useful  for
analyzing  demulsifier  dosages  (for  example,  during  summer  and  winter)  and  unit  demulsifier
costs and can pinpoint certain activities that may be responsible for emulsion upsets and under-
lying problems. These data are also very useful for optimization of emulsion-treatment programs.
• The  emulsion-treatment  program  should  be  reviewed  periodically  because  conditions
change. The frequency of evaluation depends on many factors including the relative cost of the
demulsifier usage, heating costs, capacity limitations, and manpower requirements.

12.4.3 Emulsion Prevention.  Emulsions are always a drain on the operating budget. It is al-
most impossible to eliminate emulsions during crude production; however, emulsion problems
can  be  reduced  and  optimized  by  following  good  operating  practices.  The  following  points
should be included in operating practices.

• Solids management. Fine solids stabilize emulsions, and efforts should be made to reduce
solid  contaminants  during  production.  These  solids  include  asphaltenes,  which  can  be  con-
trolled by effective asphaltene management, dispersants, etc.; scales, which should be reduced
by scale inhibitors; and waxes, which should be controlled with pour-point depressants or heating.
• Reduction of corrosion products. These products can be reduced with effective corrosion

inhibitors.

• Acidization.  Stimulation  with  acids  can  cause  very  tight  emulsions;  consequently,  acid
jobs  should  be  designed  with  care,  and  their field performance should  be  reviewed.  To  avoid
emulsion upsets, the acid job design should incorporate effective demulsifiers at relatively high
concentrations, use mutual solvents, and minimize fines and precipitates during acidization.

• Mixing  or  turbulence.  Chokes  and  other  devices  such  as  pumps  should  be  controlled  to
optimize  shear  and  mixing.  While  a  moderate  amount  of  mixing  is  necessary  and  beneficial,
severe mixing leads to tight emulsions or even re-emulsification after water separation. Another
place to control mixing is in gas lift operations by injecting the optimum amount of gas.

• Compatibility of chemicals. Increasingly, more chemicals are being used for improved oil
recovery and crude processing. The chemical may be the source of the emulsion problem. Com-
patibility  studies  should  be  performed  with  the  chemicals  that  are  used  during  crude  oil
production (from the reservoir to the separation facilities), and their emulsion-forming tenden-
cies should be evaluated.

12.4.4 Demulsifier Selection and Optimization.  For  an  existing  facility,  important  questions
include, “Are we using the best demulsifier?” and, “Is my demulsifier usage optimized?” Demul-
sifier  selection  is  still  considered  an  art  that  improves  with  experience;  however,  there  are
methods now available to eliminate some of the uncertainties involved in demulsifier screening
and selection. The properties of a good demulsifier were addressed previously. How to select
the best demulsifier and to optimize its usage is addressed here.

Demulsifier selection should be made with the emulsion-treatment system in mind. Some of

the questions to be asked include the following.

• What is the retention time of the emulsion in the equipment?
• What type of emulsion is to be treated?
• What is the water cut?
• Is the system heated, or can it be heated if necessary?
• What is the range of operating temperatures during the summer and winter months?
• Is the feed constant or changing in composition?
As  field  conditions  change,  demulsifier  requirements  also  change.  Lower  temperatures  in
the winter can induce wax-related and other problems. Well treatments can upset the treatment
plant. For example, acidizing a well can result in asphaltenic sludges that may form tight and
stable emulsions. Similarly, well workovers and chemical treatments can lead to emulsion-relat-
ed problems at the treatment facility. The consequences of well treatments and other activities
should  be  anticipated, and  the  operator should  be  ready  to  increase the  demulsifier dosage,  if
necessary. It cannot be expected that the same demulsifier or the same demulsifier dosage will
be capable of resolving emulsions when conditions change.

To select a demulsifier for a given system, one generally starts with the bottle tests. Repre-
sentative  emulsion  samples  are  taken  and  transferred  into  several  centrifuge  tubes.  Several
demulsifiers,  usually  from  different  demulsifier  vendors,  are  added  to  the  centrifuge  tubes  in
various amounts, and water-dropout data are collected and analyzed to determine the best demul-
sifier.  Before  the  tests,  the  demulsifier  vendors  can  be  invited  to  provide  one  or  two  of  their

I-564

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

demulsifiers.  Most  vendors  would  want  to  test  their  chemicals  with  emulsions  from  the  field
before submitting their best candidates. A quantitative method for demulsifier testing was devel-
oped recently,31 and the calculation procedures are described in the Appendix. For selecting the
best  demulsifier,  several  sets  of  tests  may  be  necessary  at  different  concentrations,  tempera-
tures,  water  cuts,  etc.  The  demulsifier  dosages  obtained  in  the  lab  are  generally  greater  than
what  will  be  needed  in  the  field.  It  is  highly  recommended  that  the  bottle  test  be  conducted
with fresh emulsions (i.e., within a few minutes of sampling), because sample aging has a sig-
nificant  effect  on  demulsifier  dosages.  During  the  bottle  tests,  other  factors  should  be  noted:
color and appearance of the emulsion, clarity of the water, sediments in the water, presence of
a  rag  layer,  and  loose  solids  hanging  at  the  interface.  These  factors  can  provide  information
that may be important during demulsifier selection.

After the bottle tests, two or three promising demulsifiers are selected for field testing. Dur-
ing the field trials, the screened chemicals should be tested at various concentrations, operating
temperatures, and settling times and tested for clarity of separated water and, most importantly,
the amount of water and salt remaining in the produced crude. It is also a good idea to test the
chemicals over a period of time (minimum of 1 to 2 days and longer, if possible) to evaluate
the performance and compare it with the incumbent chemical performance. The best demulsifi-
er is the one that produces the fastest, cleanest separation at the lowest possible cost per unit
barrel of crude.

The demulsifier concentrations generally range from less than 5 ppm (approximately 1 gal/
5,000 bbl) to more than 200 ppm (approximately 8 gal/1,000 bbl). The most common range is
between  10  and  50  ppm.  Whatever  the  demulsifier  dosage  and  range,  it  may  be  possible  to
reduce  and  optimize  the  demulsifier  usage  by  evaluating  various  components  in  the  treatment
program.

Proper Demulsifier Mixing.  For the demulsifier to be effective, it must mix intimately with
the emulsion and migrate to the film surrounding the water droplets. If the mixing is poor, the
demulsifier  will  be  ineffective.  Ideally,  the  demulsifier  should  be  injected  in  a  continuous
stream through inline mixers that are sufficiently upstream so that the demulsifier has time to
mix  thoroughly  with  the  emulsion.  Demulsifier  slugging  should  be  avoided  because  it  creates
localized  high  concentration  regions  (an  overtreat  condition)  and  promotes  re-emulsification.
One way to enhance the mixing is to dilute the demulsifier with sufficient quantities of a dilu-
ent,  generally  a  solvent,  and  inject  the  diluted  demulsifier/solvent  mixture  into  the  emulsion.
The larger quantity of the mixture makes it possible for the chemical to be mixed more uniform-
ly with the emulsion.

Similarly, turbulence enhances the diffusion and dispersion of demulsifier into the emulsion
and increases the probability of collisions between water droplets. This turbulence must persist
long  enough  to  allow  the  chemical  to  reach  the  interface  between  the  oil  and  water,  but  the
intensity should not be so severe that it causes further tightening of the emulsion. This level of
turbulence is usually provided by normal flow through the emulsion-treating unit that occurs in
the pipes, manifolds, valves, and separators. When the flow rates are too low for proper mix-
ing, special care must be taken for mixing the chemical. Special mixers, such as mixing valves,
injection quills, kinetic mixers, and vortex mixers, may be installed to ensure proper demulsifi-
er mixing.

The point at which the demulsifier is injected is also important. In general, the further up-
stream the demulsifier is injected, the better. However, if there is considerable turbulence and
shear  between  the  point  where  the  demulsifier  is  injected  and  the  point  where  water  is  re-
moved,  it  may  be  worthwhile  to  reconsider  that  decision.  Another  problem  with  very  far
upstream  injection  is  the  separation  of  water  in  the  pipes,  which  can  lead  to  other  problems,
such as corrosion. In many instances, demulsifier is injected at multiple points to optimize its

Chapter 12—Crude Oil Emulsions

I-565

overall  usage;  however,  this  is  an  option  for  high-volume  treatment  facilities  and,  here  again,
the demulsifier-split ratio (between different points) should be optimized by trial and error.

Another  problem  sometimes  ignored  is  the  settling  characteristics  of  the  demulsifier.  The
active  ingredients  in  some  demulsifiers  tend  to  settle  at  the  bottom  of  demulsifier  tanks  be-
cause of insolubility, incomplete mixing, and density differences. If this happens, the surface-
active ingredient injection into the treatment facility is erratic. During the first few days of the
tank charge and injection, the demulsifier may work satisfactorily; however, subsequent perfor-
mance  may  deteriorate  as  the  active  ingredients  are  exhausted  and  only  the  carrier  solvent  is
injected.  If  this  cycle  is  observed,  the  culprit  is  the  settling  of  the  active  ingredients  of  the
demulsifier in the tank. Steps to eliminate settling include installing a mixer in the demulsifier
tank or replacing the demulsifier.

Demulsifier Overdosing.  Overdosing of the chemical can result in enhanced stability of the
emulsion, leading to rag layers or pads inside the separators. This is a severe problem because
it worsens with increased demulsifier costs. It can be difficult to determine that there is demul-
sifier  overdosing  at  a  treatment  facility.  One  way  to  reduce  overdosing  is  to  conduct  field-
optimization tests periodically to determine optimum demulsifier rates. These tests are done by
going through a series of demulsifier rates at the treatment facility and monitoring the product
crude and water characteristics. These trials provide the best demulsifier rates for the facility.
A better way to optimize demulsifier rates is by installing automated or semiautomated demul-
sifier control systems. The control systems receive input from sensors in the treatment facility
and take action to increase or decrease the demulsifier rates. The sensors monitor grid voltages
in  the  dehydrator  and  desalter,  emulsion  layer  inside  the  separator  (monitoring  through  inter-
face levels), crude and water quality, and operating temperature. The controller can also inject
additional demulsifier into the separator inlet during upset conditions to minimize their impact.
An automatic controller should always be searching for the minimum demulsifier usage.

Understanding the Causes of Emulsions.  For larger facilities it may be worthwhile to un-
derstand  the  causes  of  tight  emulsions.  Some  of  the  factors  that  stabilize  emulsions,  such  as
fine solids, asphaltenes and waxes, temperature, size of water droplets, pH, brine composition,
etc.,  were  highlighted  earlier.  Some  of  the  factors,  such  as  brine  composition  and  water  cuts,
cannot  be  controlled;  however,  other  factors  can  be  controlled.  The  temperature  can  be  in-
creased  by  heating  the  crude  or  burying/insulating  the  flowlines.  Water  droplet  sizes  can  be
increased by reducing mixing or shearing. Organic precipitates can be eliminated with disper-
sants  and  specialty  chemicals.  The  first  task  is  to  diagnose  the  causes.  Understanding  the
causes leads to better decisions for controlling the demulsifier usage. Several investigative case
studies have been reported for understanding the causes of tight emulsions16,31,48 and optimizing
demulsifier usage.

Evaluating the Process.  A  thorough  evaluation  of  the  emulsion-treatment  facility  may  be
worthwhile for optimizing costs. Some of the factors to explore include the extent of agitation,
wash-water rates, electrostatic grid voltages, retention times, and separator internals.

Agitation.  Some agitation is necessary to mix the demulsifier into the bulk of the emulsion.
Agitation is also necessary for the water droplets to collide, increasing the probability of their
coalescence. However, every effort should be taken to prevent excessive agitation because this
may  lead  to  further  emulsification.  In  other  words,  a  moderate  level  of  agitation  is  required,
and  excessive  turbulence  should  be  avoided.  Demulsification  can  be  assisted  by  the  use  of
plate packing or baffles inside the separators. These baffle plates distribute the emulsion evenly
and cause gentle agitation, which assists in the coalescing of droplets. The surface of the plates
also helps in drop coalescence.

Retention Time.  The  gentle  agitation  necessary  after  the  mixing  of  the  demulsifier  should
be  followed  by  a  period  of  quiescent  settlement  to  enhance  coalescence,  generally  by  gravity

I-566

settling.  This  relates  to  the  retention  time  of  the  fluid  in  the  separator  and  the  dimensions  of
the vessel.

Electrostatic Coalescing.  Drop coalescence can be assisted by the application of a high-volt-
age  electric  field  to  the  emulsion.  This  is  particularly  beneficial  for  polishing  the  oil  and
reducing  the  oil’s  water  content  to  very  low  levels  (less  than  0.5%).  Electrostatic  coalescing
works  by  charging  the  water  droplets  and  increasing  the  frequency  of  their  collision,  which
improves their chance of coalescence.

Maintaining a Database on Usage and Costs.  Experience  and  demulsifier  data  are  impor-
tant because they can be used to optimize usage. Typical data to maintain in a database include
oil and water rates, temperatures, demulsifier rates, demulsifier costs, and comments regarding
any changes that were made in the treatment facilities. Table 12.1 provides typical data for an
operating wet-crude handling facility. Such data can be analyzed to diagnose demulsifier-usage
problems.  They  can  also  be  used  as  a  base  to  compare  the  results  for  new  and  experimental
demulsifiers. Furthermore, they provide a quick, easy reference for understanding the seasonal
variation in consumption, causes of upsets, or increased demulsifier usage.

Appendix A—Emulsion Separation Index (ESI) Test
The emulsion bottle test is a quantitative method for demulsifier testing and involves the follow-
ing procedure.

• The crude oil emulsion sample is tested as soon as possible after it is received in the lab.
The pressurized method for sampling the emulsion is recommended. The samples are remixed
with a standard bottle shaker for approximately a minute. The same amount of shaking should
be used in all tests.

• The mixed emulsion sample is added to 100-ml standard centrifuge tubes.
• The centrifuge tubes are placed in a water bath for a minimum of 30 minutes to reach the

desired temperature.

• The required dosage of the chemical is added to the centrifuge tubes. The amount of chem-

ical is based on the total amount of emulsion (oil and water).

• The  tubes  are  shaken  by  hand  a  given  number  of  times  (approximately  20  shakes)  and

placed in the water bath at the desired temperature.

• The amount of water separated is measured with time (5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes).
• After 20 minutes, the tubes are centrifuged for another 20 minutes at the desired tempera-

ture, and the final amounts of water and emulsion or rag layer are measured.

• Generally,  these  experiments  should  be  done  in  sets  to  investigate  the  effect  of  certain
variables.  All  efforts  should  be  made  to  keep  all  the  variables  constant  except  the  one  under
investigation.

The ESI is then calculated from the measured oil/water separation data.

I = ∑W
∑n

, ................................................................ (A-1)

where I = emulsion separation index, W = water separation at a given demulsifier concentration/
time as a percentage of BS&W, and n = number of experiments.

12.A1 Notes

• Direct comparison of demulsifier dosage obtained in the laboratory with field observations
should always be made with caution because the laboratory experiments are made under static
conditions, and field usage observations are made under dynamic conditions. Furthermore, ESI
tests are done on dead crude, while field usage tests are on live (gas dissolved) crudes. Howev-
er,  laboratory  testing  is  excellent  for  screening  wellhead  samples  for  relative  emulsion  tight-
ness;  evaluating  prospective  demulsifiers;  and  evaluating  the  effects  of  different  variables  on

emulsion resolution because all the conditions are kept constant except the variable under inves-
tigation.

• Although ESI quantifies the bottle tests, it has a qualitative edge and has a range of repro-
ducibilities  because  of  several  possible  errors.  These  possible  errors  include  sampling  error,
operator error, inability to read the level of water separated properly because the oil has a ten-
dency to stick to the glass, and temperature error.

• There is a definite effect of aging. The longer an emulsion (oil/water mixture) stays in the
lab  before  testing,  the  higher  the  demulsifier  dosage  required  to  break  it;  therefore,  for  best
results, ESI tests should be done on fresh emulsion samples.

13.1 Introduction
Rock and fluid properties provide the common denominator around which we build the mod-
els,  interpretations,  and  predictions  of  petroleum  engineering,  as  well  as  geology  and  geo-
physics. We consider here the properties of sedimentary rocks, particularly those that make up
hydrocarbon  reservoirs.  Usually,  these  consist  of  sandstones,  limestones,  and  dolomites.  We
must be more inclusive, and consider rocks such as shales, evaporates, and diatomites because
these provide the seals, bounding materials, or source rocks to our reservoirs. It is important to
note that shales and claystones make up the most abundant rock type in the typical sedimenta-
ry column. Features such as seismic signature depend as much on the enclosing shale as on the
reservoir sands.

In this chapter, we will tabulate important mineral and rock properties, and provide many
of the mathematical models used to describe and predict properties. Much of this summary is
drawn upon the extensive work and compellations already available. As examples, Clark1 pro-
vides an extensive list of mineral and rock properties; Birch2 presents tables of compressional
velocities,  and  Gregory3  gives  a  detailed  overview  of  the  use  of  rock  property  information  in
seismic interpretation. Castagna et al.4 focused on rock properties for use in amplitude versus
offset analyses. Useful handbooks on this topic include Carmichael5 and Lama and Vutukuri.6,7
Probably  the  best  reference  covering  a  wide  range  of  rock  property  formulas  and  models  is
Mavko et al.8 These references can be consulted for details not presented here.

13.1.1 Knowledge of Rock Properties Is Largely Empirical.  Many  theoretical  models  have
been developed to predict or correlate specific physical properties of porous rock. Most theoret-
ical  models  are  built  on  simplified  physical  concepts:  what  are  the  properties  of  an  ideal
porous media. However, in comparison with real rocks, these models are always oversimplified
(they  must  be,  to  be  solvable).  Most  of  these  models  are  capable  of  “forward  modeling”  or
predicting  rock  properties  with  one  or  more  arbitrary  parameters.  However,  as  is  typical  in
Earth science, our models cannot be inverted from measurements to predict uniquely real rock
and pore-fluid properties. Many efforts have been made and will continue to be made to build
porous rock models, but progress is very limited. Some of the most fundamental questions are
still unanswered.

I-572

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

To establish the basic relationships between physical properties and rock parameters, labora-
tory investigations are made. Laboratory measurements of rock samples can provide controlled
conditions and high data quality (“hard data”). These relationships can be extended to a larger
scale, or can even be made scaleless. Typically, models and relations based on laboratory data
are then applied to in-situ measurements to derive the parameters we actually need (say, perme-
ability) from information we can actually collect (say, density and gamma ray radiation). The
relative merits and problems associated with several rock and fluid measurement techniques are
presented in Table 13.1.

Although many empirical relationships already have been established, when facing a fron-
tier basin, new development areas, or untested portions of known formations, valid prediction
of  rock  properties  usually  requires  core  data  (including  “sidewall”  plugs).  For  many  applica-
tions, standard trend data may not be adequate. A broad investigation is needed.

13.1.2 A Philosophy for Rock Properties.  Many  of  the  factors  affecting  rock  properties  are
incompletely ascertained. For example, acoustic velocities can be affected by numerous parame-

Chapter 13—Rock Properties

I-573

ters, many of which cannot be measured. In addressing a rock physics problem, the following
aspects should be remembered:

• There may be no exact solution.
• Rock properties are controlled by rock parameters, and these physical correlations can be

examined and recognized (although perhaps not understood).

• Often nature gives us a break. At certain conditions, relationships between the rock prop-

erties and rock parameters can be simplified (such as Archie’s Law).

• We usually must settle on imperfect solutions with some uncertainty. Statistical trends or

high and low bounds might be used to handle the uncertainty.

• Every measurement is, to some degree, wrong. The question is: Can we tolerate the errors

and understand how they propagate through our analyses?
We will begin this chapter with a suite of definitions and examples, then move on to data and
models of individual properties. By necessity, we will be restricted in the material we can cov-
er  in  a  single  chapter.  As  a  result,  we  will  not  go  into  many  details  of  rock  fabrics  and
petrography. Also, with a few exceptions, the information provided here assumes that rocks are
homogeneous and isotropic.

13.2 Rocks: Minerals Plus Pores
Rocks are defined for our purposes as aggregates or mixtures of minerals plus pores. The three
general rock types are classified as igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. Although hydrocar-
bon  reservoirs  have  been  found  in  all  three  rock  types,  we  will  consider  here  primarily
sedimentary rocks, by far the most common rocks associated with hydrocarbons.

Minerals are defined as naturally occurring solids: They have a definite structure, composi-
tion, and suite of properties that are either fixed or vary systematically within a definite range.
Although  there  are  dozens  of  elements  and  hundreds  of  described  minerals  available  in  the
Earth’s crust, the actual number that we must concern ourselves with for reservoir engineering
purposes  is  remarkably  small.  Classification  can  be  broken  into  silicates,  carbonates,  sulfates,
sulfides, and oxides. In addition, “solid” organic mixtures such as coal or bitumen can be abun-
dant.  Common  sedimentary  silicates  include  quartz,  feldspars,  micas,  zeolites,  and  clays.  Car-
bonates usually consist of calcite and dolomite, although siderite may be present. Gypsum and
anhydrite are the most common sulfates, with pyrite the typical sulfide. Oxides are usually ma-
terials  such  as  magnetite  and  hematite.  For  most  of  our  purposes,  we  can  further  restrict  our
attention  to  the  subset  of  quartz,  feldspars,  clays,  calcite,  dolomite,  and  anhydrite.  A  working
knowledge of six or so minerals fulfills most engineering needs.

Clays represent an entire family of minerals with widely differing properties. This situation
is compounded by the fact that clays are among the most abundant minerals in the sedimentary
section. Clays are also problematic because their properties can vary with the in-situ pressure,
temperature,  and  chemical  environment.  These  issues  have  led  to  an  unfortunate  bias  against
clays when measuring or describing rocks. A “clean” sand, for example, is one that has little
or no clay. “Dirty” sandstones or limestones have significant amounts of clay. Clays and their
influence  on  rock  properties  remain  poorly  understood  and  continue  to  be  an  area  requiring
intensive research.

The properties of primary engineering interest are often controlled more by the rock fabric
than by the bulk composition. The “holes” are usually more important than the mineral frame.
With  the  following  few  examples,  we  will  see  many  of  the  most  common  sedimentary  rock
forms and textures. Numerous attempts have been made to extract rock properties from images
of the rock and pore space.9–11 These techniques often work well, but depend on the observa-
tion scale, representative nature of the image, and internal heterogeneity.

A thin section of clean sandstone is shown in Fig. 13.1. Under plane-polarized light, quartz
grains appear white and pores are stained blue. This is a high-porosity, friable sample that has
not undergone substantial consolidation. Silica cement can be seen coating the individual grains

I-574

microstructures determine the properties of the rock on a whole.

and bonding the largely unchanged, rounded quartz grains. Grain-to-grain stress is indicated by
the fractures radiating from points of grain contact. Although these fractures have a relatively
small volume, they have a disproportionately large influence on the mechanical properties, par-
ticularly  the  pressure  dependence.  With  continued  diagenesis,  quartz  grains  typically  would
become intergrown, and large amounts of cement would develop, reducing the pore volume.

A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) image of another sandstone is seen in Fig. 13.2. A
higher degree of compaction is indicated here by the intergrown, sutured contacts of the quartz
grains (gray areas). A grain undergoing alteration (a) as well as some of the matrix quartz (b)
contain  isolated,  ineffective  porosity.  Fractures  are  again  present,  particularly  near  point  of
grain contact. Many of these fractures, however, may be caused by stress relief as the sample
was  cored,  or  by  the  cutting  and  polishing.  The  most  obvious  features  are  the  contorted  and
rotated mica grains (d). These micas were crushed due to compaction, and now host numerous

features. Some grains are either altering (a) or have internal, ineffective porosity (b). Fractures (c) cut

sets of parallel fractures. Some diagenetic clays are also beginning to grow in the pore spaces
and act as a cement.

A  cementation  “front”  is  visible  in  Fig.  13.3.  Cements  come  in  a  wide  variety  of  forms.
Open  pores  are  black  in  the  SEM  image.  In  this  case,  the  lighter  gray  calcite  has  filled  the
pores in the lower portion of the image. Unlike the dispersed silica and clay cements seen in
the previous figures, the calcite is deposited with an abrupt front. This kind of texture is com-
mon  for  carbonate  cements  in  sands  and  is  probably  caused  by  the  availability  of  crystal
nucleation  sites  available  to  a  slightly  supersaturated  pore  fluid.  We  would  obviously  expect
vastly  different  properties  of  the  uncemented  vs.  cemented  portions  separated  by  only  a  few
grain diameters. This rock is an example of the extreme heterogeneity that can frequently occur
even within the same small geologic unit of the same formation.

Carbonates can have extremely complex textures resulting form the mixture of fossils and
matrix  building  the  rock.  In  Fig.  13.4,  an  optical  image  demonstrates  the  multitude  of  forms
that  can  be  present.  Shell  fragments  appear  as  crescent  shapes  in  cross  section.  Much  of  the
material between fragments can be filled with carbonate mud, reducing the porosity substantial-
ly. In this sample, bulk porosity is dominated by the larger disconnected vugs. Such vugs can
occur as parts of fossils or as a result of chemical dissolution after deposition. Here, a coating
of  crystals  has  grown  on  the  vug  surfaces.  Because  of  the  wide  range  of  sizes,  shapes,  and
compositions  that  can  occur  in  carbonate  rocks,  they  are  often  difficult  to  characterize  with
core or even log sampling.

Dolomites are usually formed by recrystallization of original aragonite or calcite crystals in
sediments. Magnesium in the pore fluids replace some of the calcium, forming a Mg-Ca carbon-
ate  structure.  Because  of  the  greater  density  of  dolomite,  this  transformation  can  include  a
porosity  increase.  Sometimes,  the  replacement  can  be  subtle,  and  original  sedimentary  struc-

the original rock fabric and rhombohedral dolomite crystals appear, as at (a) in Fig. 13.5. The
other intergrown dolomite crystals form porosity that is polygonal. In this sample, many of the
pores are coated (b) with pyrobitumin, a complex organic material similar to coal. This pyrobi-
tumen  is  sometimes  incased  within  dolomite  crystals.  In  this  case,  it  will  lower  the  apparent
grain density and strength of the rock.

As mentioned, clays are among the most abundant minerals. These minerals can influence
or  control  physical  properties  to  a  major  degree.  In  addition,  many  clays  are  sensitive  to  the
environment  and  will  change  properties  and  forms  under  different  conditions.  An  example  of
such “sensitive” clay fabrics is shown in Fig. 13.6. Note that the scale is much finer here than
in  previous  figures.  In  Fig.  13.6a,  chlorite  originally  coats  the  quartz  grains.  On  top  of  the
chlorite, a smectite coating was developed. This core sample was allowed to dry, and the smec-
tite  collapsed,  forming  long  slender  columns  in  the  pore  space.  Resaturating  the  rock  with
distilled water allowed the smectite coating to expand and fill the pore space (Fig. 13.6b). The
closed  pores  will  obviously  have  different  fluid-flow  characteristics.  In  this  case,  we  cannot
assume  the  mineral  in  is  a  passive,  inert  solid.  This  rock  will  change  properties  according  to
pore fluid chemistry.

The  most  common  sedimentary  rock  types  are  shales  and  silts.  In  Fig.  13.7,  white  quartz
grains float in the surrounding clay matrix. Black organic material in thin layers indicates the
horizontal  bedding.  As  a  result,  this  rock  has  properties  that  vary  strongly  with  direction  and
are  thus  anisotropic.  This  material  could  serve  as  both  a  source  rock  and  reservoir  seal.  This
sample  demonstrates  how  a  mudstone  or  shale  could  have  a  complex  composition.  Although
clays typically make up a large portion of fine-grained rocks, terms such as “clay” and “shale”
are not synonymous.

Most sedimentary rocks have porosities under 0.50 (fractional). This is easy to understand,
particularly  with  coarser  clastic  sediments,  in  which  open  grain  packings  that  can  support  a
matrix framework have maximum porosities around 0.45. Exceptions to this and other general-

izations can occur, and an example is shown in Fig. 13.8. This globigerina “ooze” is composed
largely of the small shells or tests of organisms. The matrix mud fills the region between tests,
but interiors remain empty. In addition, the tests themselves are porous. As a result, porosities
can  be  as  high  as  0.8.  Despite  these  huge  porosities,  because  of  the  isolated  nature  of  the
pores, permeability can be in the microdarcy range. A similar situation often occurs in shallow
clay-rich sediments where the open clay plate structure results in initial very high porosities. In
the remainder of this chapter, however, these types of sediments will be considered exceptional
and will not be included in our analyses.

The rock images shown in these several figures are meant to convey a feel for the types of
textures  common  in  sedimentary  rocks,  and  that  influence  physical  properties.  We  will  refer
back  to  these  images  later  in  the  chapter.  These  few  images  can  in  no  way  be  considered  a
complete description of rock textures. For a more thorough treatment, the reader should consult
one of the standard petrography texts or pertinent papers.12–14

13.3 Density and Porosity

13.3.1 Basics and Definitions.  Density is defined as the mass per volume of a substance.

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Fig. 13.5—Thin-section image of a dolomite. Dolomite rhombohedra (a) are common. Within the pore space
and between grains are black layers of phyrobitumen (b and c).

Density = Mass

Volume = ρ, ..................................................... (13.1)

typically with units of g/cm3 or kg/m3. Other units that might be encountered are lbm/gallon or
lbm/ft3 (see Table 13.2).

For  simple,  completely  homogeneous  (single-phase)  material,  this  definition  of  density  is
straightforward.  However,  Earth  materials  involved  in  petroleum  engineering  are  mixtures  of
several phases, both solids (minerals) and fluids. Rocks, in particular, are porous, and porosity
is intimately related to density. For rocks, porosity (Φ) is defined as the nonsolid or pore-vol-
ume fraction.

Porosity = Pore Volume

Total Volume = Φ. ............................................... (13.2)

Porosity is a volume ratio and thus dimensionless, and is usually reported as a fraction or per-
cent. To avoid confusion, particularly when variable or changing porosities are involved, it is
often reported in porosity units (1 PU = 1%).

Several volume definitions are required to describe porosity:

Total volume of rock
Volume of mineral phase
Volume of pores or openings

= VT orVr x
= Vg orVm
= Vpor

where  Ms,  Md,  Msat,  Mb,  and  Mfl  are  the  mass  of  the  solid,  dry  rock,  saturated  rock,  buoyant
rock, and fluid, respectively.

Fig. 13.8—Thin-section image of fossil-rich globigerina ooze. Because of the porosity of the individual
fossil tests, the total rock porosity reaches 80%. Much of this is microporosity. Despite the high porosity
and soft nature of this rock, a fracture has formed across the sample.

13.3.2 Relationships.    The  density  of  a  composite  such  as  rocks  (or  drilling  muds)  can  be
calculated  from  the  densities  and  volume  fraction  of  each  component.  For  a  two-component
system,

ρmix = Aρ A + BρB = Aρ A + (1 − A)ρB, .......................................... (13.6)

where ρmix is the density of the mixture; ρA is the density of Component A; ρB is the density of
B; A and B are the volume fractions of A and B respectively (and so B = 1−A).

Expanding this into a general system with n components,

I-582

Fig. 13.9—Calculated density vs. porosity for sandstone, limestone, and dolomite.

ρmix = A1ρ A1 + A2ρ A2 + A3ρ A3 + … + (1 − A1 − A2 − A3 … − An − 1)ρn. ............ (13.7)

For example, exploiting Eqs. 13.4, 13.5, and 13.6 for a rock made up of two minerals, m1 and
m2, and two fluids, f 1 and f 2, we find

ρg = Am1ρm1 + (1 − Am1)ρm2

ρ f = A f 1ρ f 1 + (1 − A f 1)ρ f 2,................................................ (13.8)

and

ρr x = Φρ f + (1 − Φ)ρg.

..................................................... (13.9)

Eq. 13.8 is a fundamental relation used throughout the Earth sciences to calculate rock den-
sity. Given a porosity and specific fluid, density can be easily calculated if the mineral or grain
density is known. Grain densities for common rock-forming minerals are shown in Table 13.3.
The result of applying Eq. 13.9 is shown in Fig. 13.9.

Note  in  Table  13.3  that  there  are  several  densities  reported  for  the  same  mineral  group,
such  as  feldspar  or  clay.  The  density  will  change  systematically  as  composition  varies.  For
example, in the plagioclase series, the density increases as sodium (albite, ρ = 2.61 g/cm3) is
replaced by calcium (anorthite, ρ = 2.75 g/cm3). The most problematic minerals are clays, par-
ticularly expanding clays (montmorillonite or smectite) capable of containing large and variable
amounts of water. In this case, densities can vary 40% or more. This is a particular problem,
because clays are among the most common minerals in sedimentary rocks.

Reservoir rocks often contain significant amounts of semisolid organic material such as bi-

tumen. These will typically have light densities similar in magnitude to those of coals.

Pore-fluid densities are covered in detail in the fluid property section (13.4).

13.3.3 In-Situ Density and Porosity.  In general, density increases and porosity decreases mono-
tonically  with  depth.  This  is  expected,  because  differential  pressures  usually  increase  with

Chapter 13—Rock Properties

I-583

depth. As pressure increases, grains will shift and rotate to reach a more dense packing. More
force  will  be  imposed  on  the  grain  contacts.  Crushing  and  fracturing  is  a  common  result.  In
addition, diagenetic processes such as cementation work to fill the pore space. Material may be
dissolved  at  point  contacts  or  along  styolites  and  then  transported  to  fill  pores.  Some  of  the
textures resulting from these processes were seen in the photomicrographs of the previous sec-
tion.  In  Fig.  13.10,  generalized  densities  as  a  function  of  depth  for  shales  are  plotted.  The
shapes and overall behaviors for these curves are similar, even though they come from a wide
variety  of  locations  with  different  geologic  histories.  These  kinds  of  curves  are  often  fit  with
exponential functions in depth to define the local compaction trend.

Differential or effective pressures do not always increase with increasing depth. Abnormally
high pore fluid pressures (“overpressure”) can occur because of rapid compaction, low perme-
ability, mineral dewatering, or migration of high-pressure fluids. The high pore pressure results
in an abnormally low differential of effective pressure. This can retard or even reverse the nor-

mal  compaction  trends.  Such  a  situation  is  seen  in  Fig.  13.11.  Porosities  for  both  shales  and
sands show the expected porosity loss with increasing depth in the shallow portions. However,
at  about  3500  m,  pore  pressure  rises  and  porosity  actually increases  with  depth.  This  demon-
strates why local calibration is needed. This behavior is also our first indication of the pressure
dependence of rock properties, a topic covered in more detail in Section 13.5.

13.3.4 Measurement Techniques. Laboratory.  Numerous methods can be used in the laborato-
ry to determine porosity and density. The most common are by saturation weight and Boyle’s
law.  For  rocks  without  sensitive  minerals  such  as  smectites,  the  porosity  and  dry,  grain,  and
saturated densities can be derived from the saturated mass, dry mass, and volume (or buoyant
weight). These measurements allow calculation of saturated, dry, and grain density as well as
porosity and mineral and pore volume by employing Eqs. 13.3 through 13.5.

The Boyle’s law technique measures the relative changes in gas pressures inside a chamber
with  and  without  a  rock  specimen.  The  internal  (connected)  pore  volume  is  calculated  from
these variations in pressure, from which porosities and densities are extracted.

Logging.  Several logging techniques are available to measure density or porosity.27,28 These
indirect  techniques  can  have  substantial  errors  depending  on  borehole  conditions,  but  they  do

(= geopressure) reduce the effective pressure and cause an increase in porosity (from Stuart26).

provide a measure of the in-situ properties. Gamma ray logs bombard the formation with radia-
tion  from  an  active  source.  Radiation  is  scattered  back  to  the  logging  tool,  depending  on  the
electron density of the material. Formation density is extracted from the amplitude of these back-
scattered gamma rays. The neutron log estimates porosity by particle interaction with hydrogen
atoms. Neutrons lose energy when colliding with hydrogen atoms, thus giving a measure of the
hydrogen content. Because most of the hydrogen in rocks resides in the pore space (water or
oil),  this  is  then  related  to  the  liquid-filled  porosity.  Note  that  the  neutron  log  will  include
bound  water  within  clays  as  porosity.  In  addition,  when  relatively  hydrogen-poor  gas  is  the
pore fluid, the neutron log will underestimate porosity. In a similar fashion, the nuclear magnet-
ic resonance (NMR) log will resolve the hydrogen content. This tool, however, has the ability
to differentiate between free bulk water and bound water. Sonic logs are also used for porosity
measurements, particularly when anomalous minerals (such as siderite) or borehole conditions
render other tools less accurate. The technique involves inverting velocity to porosity using one
of the relationships provided in the velocity section below. Gravimetry has also been used down-
hole to measure variations in density. Although this tool is insensitive to fine-scale changes, it
permits density measurement far out into the formation.

Seismic.  On a coarse scale, densities can sometimes be extracted from seismic data. This
method requires separating the density component of impedance. This normally requires an anal-
ysis of the seismic data as a function of offset or reflection angle. This technique will probably
see more use as seismic data improves and is further incorporated into reservoir description.

13.4 Fluid Properties
Hydrocarbons  occur  in  a  variety  of  conditions,  in  different  phases,  and  with  widely  varying
properties.  In  this  section,  we  will  cover  the  important  geophysical  properties  of  pore  fluids.
For more general information on the engineering properties of fluids, see the appropriate sec-

tion  in  the  Handbook.  Fig.  13.12  shows  schematically  the  relation  among  the  different  mix-
tures. For a single, constant composition mixture, as we vary temperature and pressure over a
wide  range,  we  would  encounter  the  boundary  between  the  single  and  multiphase  regions.  In
contrast, if  we  restrict the  temperatures and  pressures  to  those  typical of  reservoirs,  we  could
again  move  in  this  phase  “space”  by  changing  compositions.  Velocities  and  densities  will  be
high (close to water) for heavy “black” oils to the left of the figure and decrease dramatically
as we move right toward lighter compounds. In many cases, the hydrocarbons are greater than
critical  pressure  and  temperature  conditions  (greater  than  critical  point).  Properties  then  can
vary  continuously  from  liquid-like,  for  oils  with  gas  in  solution,  to  gas-like,  for  mixtures  of
light  molecular  weight.  With  changing  pressure  and  temperature  conditions,  phase  boundaries
can be crossed, resulting in abrupt changes in fluid properties. Additional components are often
injected during production, further complicating the distribution of compositions and properties.

13.4.1 Gas.  The gas phase is the easiest to characterize. The compounds are usually relatively
simple, and the thermodynamic properties have been thoroughly examined. Hydrocarbon gases
usually  consist  of  the  light  hydrocarbons  of  methane,  butane,  and  propane.  Additional  gases,
such as water vapor and heavier hydrocarbons, will occur in the gas depending on the pressure,
temperature, and history of the deposit. The specific weight of these gases, as compared to air
at standard temperature and pressure, will vary from about 0.6 for nearly pure methane to over
1.5  for  gases  with  heavier  components.  Fortunately,  when  a  rough  idea  of  the  gas  weight  is
known, a fairly accurate estimate can be made of the gas properties at pressure and tempera-
tures. Thomas et al.29 did a complete analysis of the acoustic properties of natural gases, and
we will follow a similar analysis here.

The important seismic characteristics of a fluid (the bulk modulus, density, and sonic veloc-
ity)  are  all  related  to  primary  thermodynamic  properties.  Therefore,  for  gases,  we  are  obliged
to start with the ideal gas law.

Chapter 13—Rock Properties

PV = nRTa, .............................................................. (13.10)

where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the gas constant,
and Ta the absolute temperature. This leads to a density ρ, of

for compressibility defined as a positive number.

If we calculate the “isothermal” velocity VT, we find

βTρ = RT

M ........................................................... (13.13)

for  an  ideal  gas.  The  acoustic  velocity  is  controlled  by  the  stiffness  of  the  material  and  its
density (see the derivation in Section 13.5.5). Therefore, velocity would increase with tempera-
ture and be independent of pressure.

Two mitigating factors bring the relationship closer to reality. First, because there are rapid
temperature changes associated with the passage of an acoustic wave, we must use the adiabat-
ic compressibility, βS, rather than the isothermal compressibility γ βS = βT .

Here,  γ  is  the  ratio  of  heat  capacity  at  constant  pressure  to  the  heat  capacity  at  constant
volume. In most solid materials, the difference between the isothermal and adiabatic compress-
ibilities is negligible. However, in fluid phases, particularly gases, the isothermal compressibili-
ty can be twice the adiabatic value.

The  second,  more  obvious  factor  stems  from  the  inadequacies  of  the  ideal  gas  law  (Eq.
13.10). The gas law can be corrected by adding a compressibility factor (Z). The relationships
are thus modified:

PV = ZnRTa, ............................................................. (13.14)
ρ = M P/ ZnRTa, .......................................................... (13.15)

and

βS = βT / γ = M / (γρZRTa). ................................................... (13.16)

The heat capacity ratio can itself be derived if the equations of state of the material are known.
The seismic characteristics of the gas can, therefore, be described if we have an adequate de-
scription of Z with pressure, temperature, and composition.

Thomas  et  al.29  made  use  of  the  Benedict-Webb-Rubin (BWR)  equation  to  define  the  gas
behavior. The BWR equation of state is a rational equation, with numerous constants based on
the  behavior  of  natural  gas  mixtures.  These  gas  mixtures  range  in  gravity  G  (relative  to  air)
from  about  0.5  to  1.8.  The  results  of  the  density  calculations  are  shown  in  Fig.  13.13.  As

would be expected, the gas densities increase with pressure and decrease with temperature. How-
ever, the densities also strongly depend on the gas gravity, which is composition-dependent.

The  adiabatic gas  modulus  K  (the  inverse  of  β)  also  strongly  depends  on  the  composition
as  well  as  the  pressure  and  temperature  conditions.  Fig.  13.14  shows  the  calculated  modulus
from the Thomas relationships. Again, the modulus increases with pressure and decreases with
temperature, but the relationship is not as linear. The impact of variable composition (gravity)
is again obvious.

13.4.2 Oil.  Crude oils can be mixtures of extremely complex organic compounds. Natural oils
range  from  the  lightest  condensate  liquids  of  low  carbon  number  to  very  heavy  tars.  At  the
heavy  extreme  are  bitumen  and  kerogen,  which  may  be  denser  than  water  and  act  essentially
like  solids.  At  the  light  extreme  are  condensates  that  may  become  gas  with  decreasing  pres-
sure.  Oils  can  absorb  large  quantities  of  hydrocarbon  gases  under  pressure,  thus  significantly
decreasing the moduli. Under room conditions, the densities can vary from 0.5 to greater than
1 gm/cc with most produced oils in the 0.7 to 0.8 gm/cc range. The American Petroleum Insti-
tute (API) number is defined as

API = 141.4 / ρ − 131.5. ..................................................... (13.17)

This results in API numbers of about 5 for very heavy oils to near 100 for light condensates.
The extreme variations in composition and ability to absorb gases produce greater variations in
the seismic properties of oils.

and 1.2 (from Batzle and Wang30).

If we had a general equation of state for oils, we could calculate the moduli and densities
as we did for the gases. Such equations abound in the petroleum engineering literature. Unfor-
tunately,  the  equations  are  almost  always  strongly  dependent  on  the  exact  composition  of  a
given oil. For the purposes of this Handbook, we will develop only very general relations. Of-
ten, in petrophysical analysis we only have a rough idea of what the oils may be like. In some
reservoirs,  individual  yet  adjacent  zones  will  have  quite  distinct  oil  types.  We  will,  therefore,
proceed along empirical lines based on the density of the oil.

The acoustic properties of numerous organic fluids have been studied as a function of pres-
sure or temperature (see, for example, Rao and Rao31). Generally, the velocities, densities, and
moduli are quite linear with pressure and temperature away from phase boundaries. In organic
fluids typical of crude oils, the moduli decrease with increasing temperature and increase with
increasing  pressure.  Wang  and  Nur32  did  an  extensive  study  of  several  light  alkanes,  alkenes,
and cycloparaffins and found simple relationships among the density, moduli, temperature, and
carbon number or molecular weight. For velocity they found

VT = Vo − bΔT, ............................................................ (13.18)

where  Vo  is  the  initial  velocity,  VT  is  the  velocity  at  temperature  T,  ΔT  is  the  temperature
change, and b is a constant for each compound of molecular weight M:

b = 0.306 − 7.6 / M. ........................................................ (13.19)

Similarly, the velocities are related in molecular weight by

VTM = VTOMO − bΔT − am 1/ M − 1/ Mo , ...................................... (13.20)

where VTM is the velocity of oil of weight M, and VTOMO is the velocity of a reference oil of
weight Mo at temperature To. The variable am is a positive function of temperature. We can see
from the rightmost term in Eq. 13.20 that the velocity of the fluid will increase with increasing
molecular weight. When compounds are mixed, Wang and Nur32 found that the resulting veloc-
ity  is  a  simple  fractional  average  of  the  end  components.  This  is  roughly  equivalent  to  a
fractional average of the bulk moduli of the end components. Pure simple hydrocarbons, there-
fore, behave in a simple predictable way. We must extend this analysis to include crude oils,
which are generally much heavier and have more complex compositions. The influence of pres-
sure must also be determined. In the petroleum engineering literature, broad empirical relation-
ships  are  available.  By  empirically  fitting  equations  to  these  data,  we  can  get  density  as
functions of initial density (or API number), temperature, and pressure

Very large amounts of gas or light hydrocarbons can go into solution in crude oils. In fact,
the lighter crudes are condensates from the gas phase. We would expect the “live” or gas-satu-
rated oils to have significantly different properties than the “dead” or gas-free oils commonly
available  and  measured.  The  amount  of  gas  that  can  be  dissolved  is  a  function  of  pressure,
temperature, and the composition of both the gas and the oil.34

where R is the gas-oil ratio in liters/liter (1 liter/liter = 5.615 cu ft/bbl) at atmospheric pressure
and  at  15.5°C  and  G  is  the  gas  gravity.  Eq.  13.26  indicates  that  much  larger  amounts  of  gas
can  go  into  the  light  (high  API  number)  oils.  In  fact,  heavy  oils  may  precipitate  heavy  com-
pounds if much gas goes into solution.

The effect of this gas in solution on the oil acoustic properties has not been well document-
ed. Sergeev35 noted that gas in solution will reduce both oil and brine velocities. He calculated
that this mix would change some reservoir reflection coefficients by more than a factor of two.
A rough estimate of this dissolved gas effect can be made by assuming that the relationship in
Eq. 13.26 remains valid and by adjusting the oil density to include the gas component. We are
assuming here that the gas is a liquid component with its own volume and density and that the
result is an ideal liquid mixture. The simple additive relations found in Wang and Nur32 sup-
port this concept. The estimated density becomes

ρG = ρO(0.972 + 0.000147F 1.175), ............................................ (13.27)

where  ρO  is  the  dead  oil  density  and  ρG  is  the  gas  saturated  live  oil  density.  The  factor  F  is
derived from the gas/oil ratio

F = R G/ ρO

Fig.  13.17  shows  the  live  and  dead  oil  velocities  measured  in  Wang  et  al.33  along  with  the
estimates using Eqs. 13.25, 13.27, and 13.28.

13.4.3 Brines.    The  great  bulk  of  the  pore  fluids  consists  of  brines.  Their  composition  can
range  from  almost  pure  water  to  saturated  saline  solutions.  Gulf  of  Mexico  area  brines  often
have rapid increases in concentration with increasing depth. In other areas, the concentrations
are often lower but can vary drastically between adjacent fields.

The thermodynamic properties of aqueous solutions have been studied in detail. Keenan et
al.36  give  a  relation  for  pure  water  that  can  be  iteratively  solved  to  give  densities  at  pressure
and temperature. Helgeson and Kirkham37 use this and other data to calculate a wide variety of
water properties over an extensive temperature and pressure range. One obvious effect of salin-
ity is to increase the density of the fluid. Rowe and Chou38 presented a polynomial to calculate
both  specific  volume  and  compressibility  of  various  salt  solutions  at  pressure  over  a  limited
temperature range. Extensive additional data on sodium chloride solutions is provided in Zarem-
bo  and  Fedorov39  and  Potter  and  Brown.40  Using  all  these  data,  a  simple  polynomial  can  be
constructed that will adequately calculate the density of sodium chloride solutions:

Here, T and P are in °C and bars, respectively; x is the weight fraction of sodium chloride; and

data from Zarembo and Federov,39 are plotted in Fig. 13.18. The accuracy of this relationship
is limited largely to the extent that other mineral salts, particularly divalent ions, are in solution.
A vast amount of acoustic data is available for brines, but generally for pressure, tempera-
ture,  and  salinity  expected  under  oceanic  conditions.  Wilson41  provides  a  relationship  for  the
velocity Vw of pure water to 100°C and about 1000 bars

Millero et al.42 and Chen et al.43 give additional factors to be added to the velocity of water to
calculate the effects of salinity. Their corrections, unfortunately, are limited to 55°C and 1 mo-
lal ionic strength (55,000 ppm). We can extend their results by using the data of Wyllie et al.44
to  100°C  and  150,000  ppm  NaCl.  Still,  this  leaves  the  high-temperature  and  -pressure  region
with no data. Here we can use the isothermal modulus calculated from Eq. 13.29 to estimate
the adiabatic moduli. We can also use the velocity function provided in Chen et al.43 but with
the  constants  modified  to  fit  the  additional  data.  The  heat  capacity  ratio  for  the  brine  can  be

13.5 Elasticity, Stress-Strain, and Elastic Waves
We will begin this section with an introduction to stress-strain relations. These form the founda-
tion  for  several  rock  properties,  such  as  elastic  moduli  (incompressibility),  effective  media
theory, elastic wave velocity, and rock strength.

13.5.1 Stress and Pressure—Definitions.  Stress is the force per unit area.

Stress = Force

Area = σi j. ...................................................... (13.33)

Chapter 13—Rock Properties

I-595

Fig. 13.19—Brine modulus as a function of temperature, pressure, and salinity (ppm = parts per million
NaCl). Water and brines are peculiar fluids in that they have a modulus (and velocity) maximum around
70ºC.

The metric units of stress or pressure are N/m2 or Pascals (Pa). Other units that are commonly
used are bars, megapascals (MPa), and lbm/in.2 (psi) (see Table 13.4). These stresses can take
various forms such as a homogeneous pressure P, normal stress σn, or stress applied at a gener-
al  angle  σg  (Fig.  13.20).  This  general  stress  can  be  decomposed  into  normal  and  tangential
components.  We  usually  refer  to  balanced  stresses  because,  under  quasistatic  conditions,  they
produce no net acceleration. Stress is a second-order tensor denoted by σij, where the first in-
dex denotes the surface and the second the direction of the applied force (see Fig. 13.21). In
Earth  sciences  and  engineering,  compressive  stresses  are  usually  considered  positive,  whereas
most material sciences consider tensional stress positive. More details on the influence of stress-
es and the stress tensor can be found in Jeager and Cook46 and Nye.47

Several standard stress conditions are either assumed for the Earth for analysis or modeling,

or applied in the laboratory:

stant during an experiment)

Hydrostatic stress: all confining stresses are equal
Uniaxial stress: one stress applied along a single axis (other stresses are zero or held con-

Biaxial stress: two nonequal stresses applied (third direction is equal to one of the others)
Triaxial  stress:  (1)  Common  usage—separate  vertical  and  two  equal  horizontal  stresses

(e.g., biaxial); (2) better—three independent principal stresses.

Anisotropic  stresses  are  usually  responsible  for  rock  deformation  and  failure  (see  Section
13.7). In much of this section, however, we will concern ourselves primarily with mean stress
(σm) or pressure (P).

It  is  important  to  distinguish  among  the  various  kinds  of  pressure,  because  the  combination
often determines any specific rock property and influences the response to any production pro-
cedure.

Increasing  confining  pressure  (Pc)  alone  will  result  in  a  decrease  of  rock  volume,  or  com-
paction.  In  contrast,  increasing  the  pore  pressure  (Pp)  tends  to  increase  rock  volume.  Pp
counteracts the effects of Pc. Thus, rock properties are controlled largely by the difference be-
tween  Pc  and  Pp,  or  the  differential  pressure  Pd.  A  more  exact  form  will  account  for  the
interaction  of  the  fluid  pressure  with  the  pore  space  and  minerals  and  result  in  an  effective
stress (Pe) law

Pe = Pc − nP p, ........................................................... (13.35)

where n is a term that can be derived theoretically or defined experimentally for each property.

13.5.2 Deformation, Strain, and Modulus.  Application of a single (vertical) stress is one typi-
cal  experiment  run  to  measure  material  mechanical  properties  (Fig.  13.22).  If  this  stress
continues to increase, eventually the material will fail when the uniaxial compressive strength
is  reached  (see  Section  13.7).  For  the  rest  of  this  chapter,  however,  we  will  deal  only  with
small  deformations  and  stresses  such  that  the  rock  remains  in  the  elastic  region.  Under  this
restriction, several important material properties can be defined. For an isotropic, homogeneous
material,  there  is  a  vertical  deformation  (ΔL)  associated  with  the  vertical  stress.  Normalizing
this deformation by the original length of the sample, L, gives the vertical strain

εzz = ΔL

L . ............................................................... (13.36)

By definition, Young’s modulus, E, is the ratio of the applied stress (σzz) to this strain

E =

σzz
εzz

.................................................................. (13.37)

Because strain is dimensionless, E is in units of stress.

This same stress will generally result in a lateral or horizontal deformation, ΔW. The lateral

strain can then be defined

The minus sign is attached because the signs of the deformations are opposite for the horizon-
tal vs. vertical strains in this simple case.

If instead we applied a pressure, we would get a volumetric strain εv:

Chapter 13—Rock Properties

εV = ΔV

V . ................................................................ (13.40)

The bulk modulus of a material is then defined as the ratio of applied pressure to volumetric
strain

K = − P
εV

. ............................................................... (13.41)

Bulk modulus is equivalent to the inverse of compressibility, β.

In a similar way, shear modulus, μ (often “G” in many publications), can be defined as the

ratio of shear stress to shear strain:

μ =

σshear
εshear

. ............................................................... (13.42)

These various equations are special cases of Hooke’s Law, which can be written for the gener-
al case

σi j = Ci jk l εk l. ............................................................ (13.43)

Stress  and  strain  are  both  tensors  with  9  components.  Cijkl  would  then  be  a  tensor  with  81
components.  However,  because  of  symmetry  considerations,  only  a  maximum  of  21  can  be
independent  (a  thorough  treatment  of  the  tensor  relations  is  provided  in  Nye47).  For  isotropic
materials, this reduces to

σi j = λδi j + 2μεi j, ......................................................... (13.44)

where  λ  is  Lame’s  constant.  In  fact,  for  isotropic  materials,  there  are  only  two  independent
elastic  parameters.  Any  isotropic  elastic  constant  can  be  written  in  terms  of  two  others.  For
example, λ can be defined as

λ = K − 2μ/ 3

. ............................................................ (13.45)

The possible combinations among various isotropic elastic constants are shown in Table 13.5.
This becomes important in applications, because restricting one term, say ν, fixes the ratio of
other moduli such as μ and K.

13.5.3 Effective  Media,  Bounds.    Rocks  are  usually  not  homogeneous,  but  are  made  up  of
multiple components such as mineral grains and pore space. On a larger scale, the bulk proper-
ties of rocks will be some weighted combination of the small-scale components. This averaging
or  upscaling  step  is  needed  if  we  wish  to  understand  the  behavior  of  our  laboratory  data  or
extract useful parameters from field data such as logs or seismic measurements.

The  simplest  bounds  are  provided  by  the  constant  strain  and  constant  stress  limits.  This
method is equivalent to the series vs. parallel effective resistance of a resistor network. In the
case  that  strains  of  the  two  materials  making  up  our  material  are  equal,  as  with  the  parallel
plates in Fig. 13.23a, we get the upper s(Voigt) limit. The response is controlled by the stiffer
component.

Fig. 13.23—Constraints leading to bounds on the elastic properties of a composite material. For rocks,
one component is usually considered the mineral matrix, the other component the pore space: (a) constant
strain condition, Voigt bound; (b) constant stress condition, Reuss bound.

MV = A MA + (1 − A)MB, .................................................... (13.46)

where MV is the effective Voigt modulus, MA and MB are the component moduli, and A is the
volume  fraction  of  component  A.  In  contrast,  with  the  constant-stress  case  (Fig.  13.23b),  the
soft component dominates the deformation and we get the lower (Reuss) limit.

1/ MR = A/ MA + (1 − A)/ MB, ............................................... (13.47)

where MR is the lower Reuss effective modulus. The average value between these two limits is
often used in property estimation and is termed the Voigt-Reuss-Hill relation

MV RH = (MV + MR)/ 2. ..................................................... (13.48)

Note that in the case for minerals plus pores, Mpore = 0 and MV decreases linearly with porosi-
ty. MR equals zero for all porosities.

An  alternative  approach,  known  as  the  Hasin-Shtrikman  technique,48  is  to  fill  space  with
concentric  spheres.  Material  1  is  in  the  interior,  and  Material  2  forms  a  surrounding  shell.
Spheres  such  as  these  but  of  varying  size  are  packed  together  to  fill  the  entire  medium  (Fig.

modulus are given by

where  Ki,  μi,  and  fi  refer  to  the  bulk  and  shear  moduli  and  volume  fraction  of  component  i,
respectively. The upper and lower bounds are derived by exchanging the stiff and soft compo-
nents as “1” or “2.”

The results of using Eqs. 13.46 through 13.50 are shown in Fig. 13.25. Using quartz as the
first  component  and  porosity  as  the  second,  the  composite  bulk  modulus  is  plotted  in  Fig.
13.25a as a function of porosity. In one case, the pores are empty (black), in the other, water
fills the pores and is the second component (blue). Because we used quartz as the solid compo-
nent  (Table  13.6),  these  bounds  should  contain  all  possible  values  for  sandstones  (remember:
for  isotropic  and  homogeneous  sandstones).  If,  on  the  other  hand,  our  rock  was  made  up  of
only quartz and calcite, we get bounds that appear in Fig. 13.25b. Note that the bounds have
collapsed and produce only a narrow spread. This is a result of the two end components both
being stiff and closer together. In cases such as these, a simple linear average can work well.

Example of bounds for a quartz-calcite mixture. Because the properties are comparable between the two
minerals, the bounds act much more like simple linear averages.

13.5.4 Mineral Properties.  There  are  numerous  ways  to  measure  mineral  moduli.  The  most
obvious  is  by  deforming  single  crystals.  Alternatively,  elastic  velocities  can  be  measured  and
moduli extracted for zero porosity aggregates. Tables 13.6a and 13.6b present lists of “isotrop-
ic”  densities,  mineral  bulk  and  shear  moduli,  and  elastic  velocities.  In  reality,  minerals  are
anisotropic,  and  the  values  listed  in  the  table  are  averages  derived  from  the  effective  media
fomulas  presented  above  to  represent  polygrained  isotropic  composites.  The  highest-velocity,
highest-moduli are for such minerals as almandine and rutile. Velocities can reach 9 km/s for

I-604

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Vp,  and  moduli  can  be  in  the  hundreds  of  GPa.  Clays  are  a  particular  problem.  As  noted  be-
fore, they are among the most abundant minerals on the surface of the Earth, and are common
in most sedimentary rocks. Their small size, variable composition, and chemical activity make
them  difficult  to  characterize  from  a  mechanical  point  of  view.  The  results  of  Katahara,49
Wang et al.,50 and Prasad et al.51 are given in Table 13.6b.

Mineral properties can also be extracted from the numerous empirical trends developed for

rocks, as we will see below.

13.5.5 Elastic Wave Velocities.  So far, we have considered only the static elastic deformation
of  materials.  By  adding  the  dynamic  behavior,  we  arrive  at  how  elastic  waves  propagate
through materials. If a body is changing its speed as well as deforming, there will be an unbal-
anced force because of the acceleration described through Newton’s Second Law:

3 ∂
∑
∂xi
i = 1

∂2u j
∂t2 , ................................................. (13.51)
where  ρ  is  density,  a  is  acceleration,  u  is  displacement,  and  t  is  time.  Combining  this  with
Hook’s Law (Eq. 13.43) gives the general wave equation. For a plane wave in the xx direction,
this can be written as

σi j = ρa j = ρ

∂σx x
∂x +

∂2ux
∂t2 . ............................................ (13.52)
However, if the material is being deformed, we will have strains associated with the change of
displacement with position. In turn, these strains can be related to the stresses through the ap-
propriate modulus, M (for example, Eq. 13.37):

∂σxz

13.5.6 Porosity Dependence.  The  bounding  relations  we  examined  above  can  be  applied  di-
rectly  to  rock  acoustic  velocities.  Some  dolomites  with  vuggy  pores  may  approach  the  Voigt
bound. Highly fractured rocks may approach the Reuss bound. However, there is often a great
difference between these idealized bounds and real rocks. For sandstones, we would expect to
begin with quartz velocity at zero porosity and have decreasing velocity with increasing porosi-
ty. By combining Eqs. 13.46 and 13.47 for moduli in Eq. 13.55, we can plot expected velocity
bounds, as in Fig. 13.26a. Observed distributions for sandstones are also plotted, and we see a
systematic  discrepancy  with  the  upper  (Voigt)  bound.  At  high  porosities,  grains  separate,  and
the  mixture  acts  as  a  suspension.  The  majority  of  rocks  have  an  upper  limit  to  their  porosity

I-608

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

usually termed “critical porosity,” Φc (Yin et al.53 and Nur et al.54). At this high porosity limit,
we reach the threshold of grain contacts and grain support (Han et al.55).

Brine-saturated  sandstone  velocities  can  be  separated  into  classes  based  on  their  velocity-
porosity  relations  (Fig.  13.26b).  Very  clean  sandstones  (Class  I)  decrease  in  a  simple  linear
trend from the 6 km/s velocity of quartz as porosity increases. Most consolidated rocks (Class
II) have somewhat lower velocities, still decreasing with increasing porosity. Poorly cemented
sands (Class III) approach the lower Reuss bound for velocity. Pure suspensions are dominated
by the modulus of water (Class IV) and are almost independent of the porosity. However, such
suspensions are rare. Another important class is dominated by fractures (Class V). As we shall

see  later,  fractures  have  a  far  greater  effect  on  velocity  than  might  be  expected  for  their  low
porosity, and may approach the Reuss bound.

13.5.7 Measured  Velocity-Porosity  Relations.    Numerous  systematic  investigations  into  the
relationship  of  velocity,  porosity,  and  lithology  (usually  clay  content)  have  been  conducted.
The  results  of  Vernik  and  Nur56  for  brine-saturated  sandstones  are  shown  in  Fig.  13.27  for
compressional  and  shear  velocities,  respectively.  Very  clean  sands  (clean  arenites)  show  the

are segregated into lithologic type, and show decreasing velocity as rocks depart from pure quartz content

is similar to the Vp trends seen in (a) above (after Vernik and Nur56).

linear decrease from quartz velocity. However, even small amounts of clays will substantially
lower the trend. Increasing clay content will then continue to lower velocities.

Numerous  examples  of  general  porosity/velocity/clay  content  relations  for  sandstones  are
given in Table 13.7 a and b (symbol definitions for these relations are in Table 13.7c). These

Chapter 13—Rock Properties

I-611

types of relations have proved very useful in giving velocities under general conditions, provid-
ing the overall effects of clay, and establishing the relation of compressional to shear velocity
(Vp/Vs  ratios).  Vp−Vs  relations  are  extremely  important,  because  shear  logs  are  relatively  rare,
yet  shear  velocities  are  critical  in  determining  seismic  direct  hydrocarbon  indicators  such  as
reflection Amplitude-Versus-Offset (AVO) trends (Castagna et al.18).

Measured data for carbonates are less abundant. A systematic investigation of samples from
several wells was reported by Rafavich et al.57 A plot of their results for carbonate Vp as func-
tions of porosity and composition is shown in Fig. 13.28. They collected detailed information
on fabric and texture as well as porosity and mineralogy. Performing regressions on their exten-
sive  data  set  produced  the  relations  given  in  Table  13.8a.  The  coefficients  associated  with
these equations are given in Table 13.8b. Note that the relations are dependent on the effective
pressure.

A  similar set  of  measurements by  Wang  et al.58  are shown  in  Fig. 13.29.  For  carbonates,
the data can be quite scattered, but can still show the general velocity decrease with increasing

I-612

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

porosity. These results were summarized in a set of relations (Table 13.9) again showing pres-
sure dependence. Their data, however, includes measurements made with samples not only brine-
saturated, but hydrocarbon-saturated and after simulated reservoir floods. They demonstrate that
the overall velocity and impedance changes were strongly dependent on the imposed sequence
of flooding. The ability to observe a particular reservoir process will be more complicated than
simply completely substituting fluids into the rocks.

13.5.8 Pressure.  Rock  moduli  (compressibility)  and  elastic  velocities  are  strongly  influenced
by pressure. With increasing effective pressure, compliant pores within a rock will deform, con-
tract, or close. The rock becomes stiffer, and, as a result, velocities increase. Two examples are
shown  in  Fig.  13.30.  The  typical  behavior  is  rapid  increase  in  velocity,  with  increasing  pres-
sure  at  low  pressures,  followed  by  a  flattening  of  the  curve  at  higher  pressures.  Presumably,
compliant  pores  and  cracks  are  closed  at  higher  pressure,  and  velocities  asymptotically  ap-
proach  a  relatively  constant  velocity.  This  specific  behavior  at  high  pressures  leads  to  the
simple  velocity-porosity  transforms  and  probably  is  responsible  for  our  ability  to  use  sonic
tools as in-situ porosity indicators with little regard to local pressures.

portion of the figure (from Rafavich et al.57).

The  stress  dependence  of  granular  material  has  been  examined  extensively.  For  example,
Gassmann60  and  Duffy  and  Mindlin61  modeled  various  packings  of  spheres.  In  general,  they
found that

where f is approximately linear. This type of relation is particularly useful for poorly consolidat-
ed sands.

Although the absolute pressure dependences shown in Fig. 13.30a vs 13.30b are in signifi-
cant  contrast,  for  most  sandstones,  relative  changes  are  more  consistent.  By  normalizing  the
velocities  to  those  at  high  pressure  (40  MPa),  we  get  a  much  more  consistent  behavior  (Fig.

where  Pe  is  the  effective  pressure.  For  carbonates,  the  explicit  pressure  dependence  given  in
Tables 13.8a and 13.9 allow the pressure dependence to be evaluated. The pressure dependence
for  carbonate  Vp  from  Rafavich  et  al.57  is  shown  in  Fig.  13.32.  Note  that  pressure  sensitivity
increases with increasing porosity. These types of relations permit velocity changes associated
with pressure changes in the reservoir to be modeled.

It  is  important  to  note  that  all  these  relations  involve  either  differential  pressure  (Pd)  or
effective pressure (Pe). Pore pressure (Pp) counters the influence of confining pressure (Pc), so
the  difference  between  these  two  controls  rock  properties.  This  has  been  expressed  simply  in
the Terzaghi63 relation for the pressure dependence of a given porous material property S,

S' = S(Pc − P p). ........................................................... (13.61)
This  kind  of  behavior  has  been  seen  in  numerous  cases,  as  in  Fig. 13.33.  This  is  one  reason
why  properties  such  as  density,  resistivity,  and  velocity  can  decrease  with  increasing  depth
when  “overpressure”  or  when  increased  pore  pressure  is  encountered.  Changes  in  reservoir
pore  pressure  will  have  a  similar  influence.  More  precisely,  it  is  the  effective  pressure  (Eq.
13.35) that controls properties rather than just the differential. However, the magnitude of effec-
tive pressure is often found to be close to the simpler differential pressure.

13.5.9 In-Situ Stresses.  The  in-situ  “lithostatic”  stresses  are  usually  unequal.  Such  different
stresses are required or faults, folds, and other structural features would never be developed. In
contrast, most laboratory data are collected under equal stress or “hydrostatic” conditions. Dif-
ferential or triaxial measurements are comparatively rare (e.g., Gregory,65 Nur and Simmons,66
Yin,67 and Scott et al.68).

In a simple compacting basin with neither lateral deformation nor tectonic stresses, the ver-
tical stress will be largest. Lateral stresses will be developed in a basin as sediments are buried
and compacted but are constrained horizontally. Both uniform hydrostatic and unequal lithostat-
ic stress conditions are shown in Fig. 13.34.

A simple estimate of the horizontal stress, σh, can be made from the axial stress, σv, by

σh = σvν/ (1 − ν), .......................................................... (13.62)

Chapter 13—Rock Properties

I-617

where  ν  is  Poisson’s  ratio.  Calculated  stresses  typical  for  sands  (ν  =  0.1)  and  more  clay-rich
rocks (ν = 0.25) are also shown in Fig. 13.34. This basic relation (Eq. 13.62) is an oversimpli-
fication of actual conditions, but it does provide a useful conceptual model, and lateral stresses
indeed are found to be lower in sandstones than in shaly sections in most places.

From a matrix of velocities measured over axial and lateral stress conditions, velocity sur-
faces  could  be  calculated  for  a  given  rock  sample.  Data  such  as  those  shown  in  Fig.  13.35
were fitted to a form based on that of Eq. 13.58:

where  σe  is  the  effective  stress.  Fits  are  usually  very  good  even  for  consolidated  rocks  with
regression factors of around 0.98.

Fig. 13.30—Examples of dry and water-saturated sandstone velocities as a function of hydrostatic differ-
ential pressure. As pressure increases, compliant pores close, making the rock stiffer with higher velocity
and lower pore fluid sensitivity.

Velocities can vary substantially over the stress field shown in Fig. 13.34, not only among
samples but also between compressional and shear waves. Fig. 13.36 shows the Vp and Vs sur-
faces  for  Woodbine  sandstone.  Figures  such  as  13.36  demonstrate  that  the  Vp,  Vs,  and  Vp/Vs
ratio  will  all  be  strongly  dependent  on  the  exact  stress  tensor  at  depth.  Laboratory  measure-
ments under hydrostatic conditions are at best a first-order approximation.

13.5.10 Temperature.  For  consolidated  rocks  (Classes  I,  II,  and  V,  Fig.  13.26b),  the  elastic
mineral  frame  properties  are  usually  only  weakly  dependent  on  temperature.  This  is  true  for
most reservoir operations with the exception of some thermal recovery procedures. In the case
of  poorly  consolidated  sands  containing  heavy  oils,  velocities  show  that  a  strong  temperature
dependence  is  observed  (Fig.  13.37).  Several  factors  can  combine  to  produce  such  large  ef-
fects.  First,  in  heavy-oil  sands,  the  material  may  actually  be  a  suspension  of  minerals  in  tar
(Fig. 13.26b, Class IV). The framework is basically a fluid, not solid. In addition, during many
measurements, pore pressure cannot reach equilibrium. The large coefficient of thermal expan-
sion  of  oils  combined  with  the  high  viscosity  often  results  in  high  pore  pressures  within  the

average trend can be used.

rock  samples.  Thus,  effective  pressures  can  drop  substantially  (Eq.  13.61).  Care  needs  to  be
taken during such measurements that equilibrium pressures are reached.

The primary influence of temperature is through the pore fluid properties (refer to the Fluid
Properties section). Fig. 13.38 demonstrates this general temperature dependence. For dry (gas-
saturated) rock, or rock saturated with brine, almost no change in velocity is observed, even for
changes of almost 150°C. At elevated pore pressures, both gas and brine have only weak tem-
perature  dependence.  Mineral  properties  are  almost  unchanged.  However,  when  the  rocks  are
even  partially  saturated  with  oil,  dramatic  temperature  dependence  is  observed.  Such  changes
can be understood by first calculating fluid properties with temperature, then using a Gassmann
substitution to calculate the bulk rock properties. Note that for heavy viscous oils, velocity dis-
persion  (velocity  dependence  on  frequency)  can  be  significant,  and  measured  ultrasonic  data
may not agree with seismic results.

Fluid  phase  changes  may  also  occur  as  temperature  is  raised.  These  phase  changes  can
have a strong influence, particularly for high-porosity rocks at low pressures. The effect can be
seen  in  Fig.  13.38b,  where  exsolving  a  gas  phase  could  reduce  the  velocity  from  nearly  3.2
km/s to around 2.1 km/s. In several thermal recovery monitoring projects, the strongest seismic
expression was a result of gas coming out of solution to form a separate phase, rather than the
thermal effects themselves.

13.5.11 Gassmann Fluid Substitution.  To extract fluid types or saturations from seismic, cross-
well, or borehole sonic data, we need a procedure to model fluid effects on rock velocity and

density. Numerous techniques have been developed. Gassmann’s equations are by far the most
widely  used  relations  to  calculate  seismic  velocity  changes  because  of  different  fluid  satura-
tions in reservoirs. Gassmann’s formulation is straightforward, and the simple input parameters
typically can be directly measured from logs or assumed based on rock type. This is a prime
reason for its importance in geophysical techniques such as time-lapse reservoir monitoring and
direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHI) such as amplitude “bright spots,” and amplitude vs. offset
(AVO). Because of the dominance of this technique, we will describe it at length.

Despite  the  popularity  of  Gassmann’s  equations  and  their  incorporation  within  most  soft-
ware  packages  for  seismic  reservoir  interpretation,  important  aspects  of  these  equations  are
usually  not  observed.  Many  of  the  basic  assumptions  are  invalid  for  common  reservoir  rocks
and  fluids.  Many  efforts  have  been  made  to  understand  the  operation  and  application  of
Gassmann’s  equations  (Han,70  Mavko  and  Mukerji,71  Mavko  et  al.,8  Sengupta  and  Mavko,72
and  Nolen-Hoeksema73).  Most  of  these  works  have  attempted  to  isolate  individual  parameter
effects.  We  will  extend  this  analysis  to  incorporate  mechanical  bounds  for  porous  media  (see
previous) and the magnitude of the fluid effect.

Fig.  13.33—Compressional  velocities  through  a  water-saturated,  oil-wet  sandstone  sample  at  various
confining and pore pressures. When confining and pore pressures are varied together to give constant
differential pressure, the velocity stays almost constant (after Wyllie et al.64).

Compressional (P-wave) and shear (S-wave) velocities along with densities directly control
the seismic response of reservoirs at any single location. Fig. 13.39a shows measured dry and
water saturated P- and S-wave velocities of sandstones as a function of differential pressure. P-
wave velocity increases, while S-wave velocity decreases slightly with water saturation. Howev-
er, both P- and S-wave velocities are generally not the best indicators for any fluid saturation
effect.  This  is  a  function  of  coupling  between  P-  and  S-wave  through  the  shear  modulus  and
bulk  density.  In  contrast,  if  we  plot  bulk  and  shear  modulus  as  functions  of  pressure  (Fig.
13.39b), the water-saturation effect shows the following:

1. Bulk modulus increases about 50%.
2. Shear modulus remains almost constant.
Bulk modulus is more strongly sensitive to water saturation. The bulk volume deformation
produced  by  a  passing  seismic  wave  results  in  a  pore  volume  change,  and  causes  a  pressure
increase of pore fluid (water). This has the effect of stiffening the rock and increasing the bulk
modulus. Shear deformation usually does not produce pore volume change, and differing pore
fluids often do not affect shear modulus.

Gassmann’s  equations  provide  a  simple  model  to  estimate  fluid  saturation  effect  on  bulk
modulus. Eqs. 13.64a through 13.65 are convenient forms for Gassmann’s relations that show
the physical meaning:

where  K0,  Kf,  Kd,  and  Ks,  are  the  bulk  moduli  of  the  mineral,  fluid,  dry  rock,  and  saturated
rock  frame,  respectively;  Φ  is  porosity;  and  μs  and  μd  are  the  saturated  and  dry  rock  shear
moduli. ΔKd is an increment of bulk modulus caused by fluid saturation. These equations indi-
cate  that  fluid  in  pores  will  affect  bulk  modulus  but  not  shear  modulus,  consistent  with  the
earlier discussion. As pointed out by Berryman,74 a shear modulus independent of fluid satura-
tion is a direct result of the assumptions used to derive Gassmann’s equation.

Numerous assumptions are involved in the derivation of Gassmann’s equation:
1. The porous material is isotropic, elastic, monomineralic, and homogeneous.
2. The pore space is well connected and in pressure equilibrium (zero frequency limit).
3. The medium is a closed system with no pore fluid movement across boundaries.
4. There is no chemical interaction between fluids and rock frame (shear modulus remains

constant).

Many of these assumptions may not be valid for hydrocarbon reservoirs, and they depend
on rock and fluid properties and in-situ conditions. For example, most rocks are anisotropic to
some degree. The work of Brown and Korringa75 provides an explicit form for an anisotropic
fluid  substitution.  In  seismic  applications,  it  is  normally  assumed  that  Gassmann’s  equation
works  best  for  seismic  data  at  frequencies  less  than  100  Hz  (Mavko  et  al.8).  Recently  pub-
lished  laboratory  data  (Batzle  et  al.76)  show  that  acoustic  waves  may  be  dispersive  in  rocks
within  the  typical seismic band,  invalidating assumption  2.  In  such  cases,  seismic frequencies
may  still  be  too  high  for  application  of  Gassmann’s  equation.  Pore  pressures  may  not  have
enough time to reach equilibrium. The rock remains unrelaxed or only partially relaxed.

The primary measure of the sensitivity of rock to fluids is its normalized modulus Kn: the

ratio of dry bulk modulus to that of the mineral.

Kn = Kd / K0. ............................................................. (13.66)

This  function  can  be  complicated  and  depends  on  rock  texture  (porosity,  clay  content,  pore
geometry, grain size, grain contact, cementation, mineral composition, and so on) and reservoir
conditions (pressure and temperature). This Kn can be determined empirically or theoretically.
For relatively clean sandstone at high differential pressure (>20 MPa), the complex dependence
of Kn (x, y, z,…) can be simplified as a function of porosity.

Fig. 13.37—Compressional velocity as a function of temperature for a sandstone sample testing the effects
of thermal flooding. The large drop in velocity is a combined effect of grain separation, pore pressure, and
fluid modulus changes.

Thus, fluid saturation effects on the bulk modulus are proportional to the gain function G(Φ)
and the fluid modulus Kf. The G(Φ) in turn depends directly on dry rock properties: the normal-
ized  modulus  and  porosity.  In  general,  G(Φ)  is  independent  of  fluid  properties  (ignoring
interactions between rock frame and pore fluid). We must know both gain function of dry rock
frame and pore fluid modulus to evaluate the fluid saturation effect on seismic properties. Note
that the normalized modulus must be a smooth function of porosity or G(Φ) can be unstable,
particularly at small porosities.

At  high  differential  pressure  (>20  MPa),  the  Ks  of  water-saturated  sands  calculated  using
simplified  form  is  3%  overestimated  for  porous  rock  (porosity  >  15%).  Those  errors  will  de-
crease  significantly  with  low  fluid  modulus  (gas  and  light  oil  saturation).  For  low-porosity
sands  with  high  clay  content,  the  simplified  Gassmann’s  equation  overestimates  water  satura-
tion effects substantially.

In Eq. 13.64b, there are five parameters, and usually the only applied constraint is that the
parameters  are  physically  meaningful  (>0).  Incompatible  or  mismatched  data  might  generate
wrong  or  even  unphysical  results  such  as  a  negative  modulus.  In  reality,  only  K0  and  Kf  are
completely independent. Ks, Kd, and porosity Φ are actually closely correlated. Bounds on Kd
as a function of porosity, for example, constrain the bounds of Ks.

Because this Voigt bound is the stiffest upper limit, the fluid saturation effect on bulk modulus
here (ΔKdmin) will be a minimum (see Fig. 13.40).

As we have seen, the low modulus bound for porous media is the Reuss bound.

Again, Gassmann’s equation is consistent with the dry and fluid-saturated Reuss bounds. Physi-
cally, for rocks with the weakest frame, fluids have a maximum effect.

Critical  porosity,  Φc,  can  be  used  to  give  tighter  constraints  for  dry-  and  fluid-saturated
bulk  modulus  for  sands.  A  new  triangle  is  formed  which  provides  a  linear  formulation  and  a
graphic procedure for Gassmann’s calculation: the fluid saturation effect on bulk modulus pro-
portional  to  normalized  porosity  and  the  maximum  fluid  saturation  effect  on  bulk  modulus
(Reuss bound) at the critical porosity (Fig. 13.40).

This is consistent with the results of Mavko and Mukerji.71

For typical sandstones, the critical porosity Φc is around 40%. Thus, we also can generate a

Extending our empirical approach to first order, both P- and S-wave velocity can correlate lin-
early with porosity at high differential pressure. From Table 13.7, for dry clean sands,

where we assume the density of these sands is equal to

ρd = 2.65 (1 − Φ). ......................................................... (13.85)

Since the modulus is the product of the density and square of velocity, we get an equation that
is cubic in terms of porosity. The bulk modulus can be derived as

Kd = (1 − AΦ + B Φ2 − C Φ3) * K0, ........................................... (13.86)

where A = 3.206, B = 3.349, and C = 1.143. Eq. 13.86 can be further simplified if porosity Φ
is not too large (< 30%):

Kd = (1 − D * Φ)2 * K0, ..................................................... (13.87)

where  D  for  clean  sandstone  is  equal  to  1.52.  This  includes  an  empirical  expression  of  the
normalized  modulus  as  a  direct  dependence  on  porosity  and  “D”  parameter.  Table  13.10  and
Fig. 13.41 show empirical relations generated from dry velocity data of relatively clean rocks.
The parameter D is related to rock texture and should be calibrated for local reservoir condi-
tions.  In  general,  it  has  a  narrow  range  from  1.45  to  slightly  more  than  2.0,  primarily
depending on rock consolidation.

By inserting this D function into Eq. 13.71, we find

G(Φ) = D2 × Φ × (2 − D × Φ)2. ........................................... (13.88)

13.5.12 Solid Mineral Bulk Modulus.  The mineral modulus (solid grain bulk modulus) K0 is
an independent parameter, and the rock texture controls Kd. However, as mentioned previously,
the normalized modulus Kn controls the fluid saturation effect rather than Kd or Ks individually.
The  mineral  modulus  K0  is  equally  as  important  as  Kd.  However,  in  most  applications  of  the
Gassmann’s  equation,  only  Kd  is  measured.  Properties  of  the  mineral  modulus  K0  are  often
poorly  understood  and  oversimplified.  K0  is  the  modulus  of  the  solid  material  that  includes
grains,  cements,  and  pore  fillings  (Figs.  13.1  through  13.8).  If  clays  or  other  minerals  are
present with complicated distributions and structures, K0 can vary over a wide range. Unfortu-
nately,  few  measurements  of  K0  have  been  made  on  sedimentary  rocks  (Coyner78),  and  the
moduli  of  clays  are  a  particular  problem  (Wang  et  al.50  and  Katahara49;  see  Table  13.6b).
These data show that at a high pressure, K0 for sandstone samples range from 33 to 39 MPa.
K0  is  not  a  constant  and  can  increase  more  than  10%  with  increasing  effective  pressure.  Fig.
13.42 shows the influence of K0 on Gassmann’s calculation. This case uses a dry bulk modulus
calculated with the mineral modulus of 40 GPa, D = 2, and a water modulus of 2.8 GPa. The
water saturation effect was calculated for three mineral moduli of 65, 40, and 32 GPa. Results
show that for the same Kd and Kf, bulk modulus increment ΔK because of fluid saturation in-

creases with increasing mineral modulus K0. Errors caused by uncertainty of K0 decrease with
increasing porosity and fluid modulus Kf.

Because  of  lack  of  measurements  on  bulk  mineral  modulus,  we  often  must  use  measured
velocity/porosity/clay-content relationships for shaly sandstone to estimate the mineral modulus.
Assuming  zero  porosity  and  grain  bulk  modulus  of  2.65  gm/cc,  we  can  derive  mineral  bulk
and  shear  modulus  from  measured  P-  and  S-wave  velocity.  The  results  are  shown  in  Table
13.11.

1. For relatively clean sandstone (with few percent clay content), mineral bulk modulus is
39 GPa, which is stable for differential pressures higher than 20 MPa. Mineral shear modulus
is around 33 GPa, which is significantly less than 44 GPa for a pure quartz aggregate. Shear
modulus is more sensitive to differential pressure and clay content.

2. For shaly sandstone, mineral bulk modulus decreases 1.7 GPa per 10% increment of clay

content.
Such derived mineral bulk moduli can be used for Gassmann’s calculation if there are no direct-
ly measured data or reliable models for calculation.

With  a  change  of  fluid  saturation  from  Fluid  1  to  Fluid  2,  the  bulk  modulus  increment

(ΔK) is equal to

ΔK21 ≈ G(Φ) × (K f 2 − K f 1), ............................................... (13.89)

where  Kf1  and  Kf2  are  the  moduli  of  Fluids  1  and  2,  respectively,  and  ΔK21  represents  the
change in the saturation increment that results from substituting Fluid 2 for Fluid 1. Eq. 13.89
uses the fact that the gain function G(Φ) of the dry rock frame remains constant as fluid modu-

is simply proportional to the difference of fluid bulk modulus.

where  ρ1,  ρ2,  Vp1,  and  Vp2  are  the  density  and  velocity of  rock  with  Fluid  1  and  2  saturation.
Both Eqs. 13.89 and 13.90 are direct results from simplified Gassmann’s equation (Eq. 13.64).
In  Fig.  13.43,  we  show  the  typical  fluid  modulus  effect  on  the  saturated  bulk  modulus  Ks.
Even at a modest porosity of 15%, changes can be substantial. At in-situ conditions, pore flu-
ids are often multiphase mixtures. Dynamic fluid modulus may also depend on fluid mobility,
fluid distribution, rock compressibility, and seismic wavelength.

13.5.13 Cracked Rock.  For  some  cracked  rocks,  different  methods  of  calculating  velocities
and  the  effects  of  pore  fluids  are  preferable.  Numerous  theories  have  been  developed  to  de-
scribe the effects of crack-like pores. Most view cracks as ellipsoids with their aspect ratio, α,
defined as the ratio of the semiminor to semimajor axes. Eshelby79 examined the elastic defor-
mation of such elliptical inclusions, and these results were then applied to the compressibility
of rocks by Walsh.80 In concept, long, narrow cracks are compliant and can be very effective
at  reducing  the  rock  moduli  at  low  crack  porosities.  The  primary  controlling  factor  for  these

els, such as the following:

occur among fractures.

1. The porous material is isotropic, elastic, monomineralic, and homogeneous.
2. The  fracture  population  is  dilute,  and  few,  or  only  first-order,  mechanical  interactions

elliptical  fractures  is  the  aspect  ratio,  α,  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  ellipse  semiminor  (a)  to
semimajor (b) axes:

α = a/ b

. ................................................................. (13.91)

The smaller the value of α, the softer the crack and cracked rock, resulting in lower velocities
and stronger pressure dependence.

Numerous assumptions are made in the derivation and application of cracked media mod-

3. Fractures can be described by simple shapes.
4. The pore-fluid system is closed, and there is no chemical interaction between fluids and

rock frame (however, shear modulus need not remain constant).
Some  of  these  assumptions  may  be  dropped,  depending  on  the  model  involved.  For  example,
Hudson81 specifically includes the effect of anisotropic crack distributions.

One particularly useful result was derived by Kuster and Toksoz.82 Using scattering theory,
they derived the general relation of bulk and shear moduli of the cracked rock (K*, μ*) to the
crack  porosity  (c),  aspect  ratio  (αm),  mineral  (K0,  μ0),  and  inclusion  or  crack  moduli  (K′,  μ′)
(Cheng and Toksoz83).

Here,  T1  and  T2  are  scalar  functions  of  K0,  μ0,  K′,  and  μ′,  and  correspond  to  Tiijj  and  Tijij  in
Kuster and Toksoz.82 This formulation allows the effects of several populations (several values
of  m)  of  cracks  to  be  summed.  The  general  limitation  is  that  the  porosity  for  any  particular
aspect ratio cannot exceed the value of the aspect ratio itself.

The results of the Kuster-Toksoz model are shown in Fig. 13.44. Numerous important fea-
tures  should  be  noted.  Velocities  drop  rapidly  for  long,  narrow  cracks  (small  α),  with  even
small  crack  porosities.  For  such  soft  cracks,  the  increase  in  velocity  is  dramatic.  At  a  shape
close to spherical (α above about 0.5), the pores are stiff, and the change in density dominates.
Thus, with αs close to unity, going from dry to water-saturated actually decreases the velocity.
Notice also that for small aspect ratios, the shear velocity increases with water saturation. This
requires a changing shear modulus with saturation, in direct violation of a primary assumption
of Gassmann’s relations. This changing shear modulus is one reason why Gassmann’s relations
may not work well in fractured rocks. An example of a rock modeled by both Gassmann’s and
Kuster-Toksoz techniques is shown in Fig. 13.45. For this limestone, Gassmann’s relations sub-
stantially  under  estimate  the  effect  of  liquid  saturation.  The  Kuster-Toksoz  prediction  for  oil
saturation is close to the experimental observed values. However, the success of this model is
not  quite  as  spectacular  as  it  seems,  because  an  arbitrary  population  of  fractures  and  aspect

ratios (αms) can be included to force such a good fit. The actual population of cracks in rocks
remains unknown.

The expressions in Eqs. 13.92 and 13.93 are complicated and difficult to apply. The linear
relation  of  normalized  velocities  to  crack  aspect  ratio  and  porosity  suggests  that  a  simplified
form can be derived to give a first-order approximation.

13.5.14 Anisotropy.  To this point, we have usually considered rocks to be isotropic. In reali-
ty, most rocks are anisotropic to some degree. Some dominant lithologies, such as shales, are
by definition anisotropic (otherwise, they are mudstones). In addition, many ubiquitous sedimen-
tary  features  such  as  bedding  will  lead  to  anisotropy  on  a  larger  scale.  In-situ  stresses  are
anisotropic  (Fig.  13.34),  resulting  in  an  anisotropy  in  rock  properties.  Anisotropy  in  transport
properties  such  as  permeability  is  a  common  concern  in  describing  reservoir  flow.  Fractured
reservoirs typically have a preferred fracture and flow direction, and these directions often can
be ascertained from oriented borehole or surface seismic data.

An  interesting  aspect  of  anisotropy  is  the  phenomenon  of  shear-wave  splitting.  Elastic
anisotropy means that the stiffness or effective moduli in one direction will be different from
that  in  another.  For  shear  waves,  their  particle  motion  will  be  approximately  normal  to  the
direction  of  propagation.  The  velocity  will  depend  on  the  orientation  of  the  particle  motion.

Chapter 13—Rock Properties

I-635

Fig. 13.45—Measured and modeled velocities on the Bedford Limestone (Wang et al.58).

The  shear  wave  will  then  “split”  into  two  shear  waves  with  orthogonal  particle  motion,  each
traveling with the velocity determined by the stiffness in that direction. An example of this is
shown  in  Fig.  13.46  from  Sondergeld  and  Rai.84  The  recorded  waveform  can  be  seen  as  two
distinct shear waves traveling at their own velocities. Note that when these distinct waves are
examined in isolation, their velocity is independent of direction. A single input wave has been
split into two waves. This is similar to the image splitting in optics when light travels through
an anisotropic medium. On the other hand, because compressional waves have particle motion
only along the direction of propagation, they have no splitting.

Although the split shear waves may travel each with a constant velocity, the amplitude with-
in  each  will  be  strongly  dependent  on  angle.  The  energy  of  the  initial  single  shear  wave  is
partitioned  as  vector  components  in  each  of  the  principal  directions.  This  amplitude  depen-
dence on angle is shown in Fig. 13.47, also from Sondergeld and Rai.84 Figs. 13.46 and 13.47
demonstrate that measurement of seismic shear waves at the surface will be useful in delineat-
ing in-situ anisotropy directions. This anisotropy can then be related to factors such as oriented
fractures and in-situ stress directions.

A typical homogeneous but bedded sedimentary unit would have a horizontal plane of sym-
metry as well as a vertical symmetry axis of rotation. This situation is commonly referred to as
Vertical Transverse Isotropy (VTI), although the term “Polar Anisotropy” has also been suggest-
ed (Thomsen85). For “weak” anisotropy (Thomsen86), the dependence of velocities as a function
of angle (θ) from the symmetry axis can be written as

When particle motion is either parallel or perpendicular to the shale fabric, only one arriving wave is seen.

The anisotropic parameter δ is more difficult to characterize, and is the primary component
modifying the compressional moveout velocity from the isotropic case. To describe it, we must
refer back to stiffness defined in the generalized Hooke’s law given in Eq. 13.43.

The  advantage  of  these  formulations  is  that  they  can  be  extracted  from  observed  shear-wave
splitting  or  extracted  from  normal  moveout  (NMO)  corrections  during  seismic  processing.
Thus, they provide a valuable tool to describe the anisotropic character of reservoirs from re-
mote measurements.

13.5.15 Attenuation and Velocity Dispersion.  As seismic acoustic waves pass through rock,
some  of  their  energy  will  be  lost  to  heat.  For  tight,  hard  rocks,  this  loss  can  be  negligible.
However,  for  most  sedimentary  rocks,  this  loss  will  be  significant,  particularly  on  seismic
scales. In reality, all rocks are anelastic to some degree. We must rewrite our wave equation to
include this energy or amplitude loss with depth, z.

A(z, t) = A0ei(k * z − ωt), ................................................... (13.101)

where A(z,t) is the amplitude at some point of depth and time, A0 is the initial amplitude, and
k* is the complex wave number (k* = k + iαl). Note that here αl is a loss parameter, and not
an aspect ratio. Therefore, we can rewrite Eq. 13.101 as

I-638

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

A(z, t) = A0e−αl zei(k z − ωt). ................................................ (13.102)

Another common measure is the loss decrement δ:

δ = αlλ = ln A(z1)/ A(z2) , ................................................ (13.103)

where the wavelength λ depends on the velocity V and frequency f: λ = V/f. However, the most
common measure of attenuation is 1/Q.

1/ Q = δ/ π

. ............................................................. (13.104)

One of the most straightforward descriptions of the relation of velocity to attenuation was de-
veloped by Cole and Cole87 and applied to attenuation measurements by Spencer.88 The Cole-
Cole  relationships  involve  both  a  peak  frequency  or  characteristic  relaxation  time,  τ,  for  the
attenuation mechanism, and a spread factor, b, which determines the distribution of relaxation
times. The real and imaginary components, B′ and B", of a general modulus, B = B′+ iB", are

where y = ln(ωτ), B0 and B∞ are the zero and infinite frequency moduli.

This would lead to a general attenuation of
Q = B"

These relations connecting velocity and attenuation are plotted in Fig. 13.48. This figure repre-
sents  losses  and  velocity  dispersion  (frequency  dependence)  caused  by  a  single  relaxation
mechanism. At high frequencies, the material is unrelaxed and stiffer, and it has a higher veloc-
ity. At low frequencies, the material has time to relax, and velocities are lower.

Fluid  mobility  also  influences  rock  inelastic  properties.  Most  of  the  observed  losses  are
caused by relative motion of fluid in the pore space. For a constant pore fluid type, permeabili-
ty will control the motion and dissipation, thus making attenuation a permeability indicator. For
variations in viscosities, mobility also will be dependent on frequency, and attenuation and dis-
persion may indicate fluid type.

Many  models  have  been  proposed,  such  as  those  of  Biot,89  O’Connell  and  Budiansky,90
Walsh,91 and Dvorcik and Nur.92 Unfortunately, the different mechanisms proposed often give
contradictory results.

Wave attenuation and dispersion in vacuum dry rock is relatively negligible.93 Porous rocks
containing fluids show a strong frequency-dependent attenuation. Variations in fluid properties
such  as  modulus,  viscosity,  and  polarity  have  a  strong  influence  on  1/Q  (Clark,93  Winkler
et al.,94 Murphy,95 Tittmann et al.,96 Jones,97 and Tutuncu et al.98). These results indicate that
the  dominant  1/Q  mechanism  is  the  interaction  and  motion  of  fluid  in  the  rock  frame  rather

than intrinsic losses either in the frame or the fluids themselves. Squirt flow is believed to be
the  primary  loss  mechanism  in  consolidated  rocks,  although  the  inertial  Biot  mechanism  may
be important in highly permeable rocks (Vo-Thant,104 Yamamato et al.100).

Fluid  motion  and  pressure  control  velocity  changes  and  seismic  sensitivity  to  pore  fluid
types. One obvious factor is viscosity. The two most commonly used theoretical concepts are
the inertial coupling of Biot89 and the squirt-flow mechanism (see, for example, O’Connell and
Budiansky,90  or  Dvorcik  and  Nur92).  Biot  gives  a  characteristic  frequency,  ωc  (roughly,  the
boundary between high and low frequency range) with the viscosity dependence, η, in the nu-
merator:

ωc = ηΦ/ kρ

. ............................................................ (13.108)

Here, Φ is porosity, k is permeability, and ρ is fluid density. However, squirt-flow mechanisms
lead to viscosity dependence in the denominator:

ωc = Kα3/ η

. ............................................................ (13.109)

Here, K is frame modulus, and α is crack aspect ratio. These contrasting dependencies indicate
that viscosity can be an obvious test to ascertain which theory is applicable.

Compressional (Vp) and shear (Vs) velocities for a sample of the Upper Fox Hills Sandstone
(Heather well) are shown in Fig. 13.49. Several features should be noted. For the dry sample
(open  symbols),  Vp  and  Vs  show  little  frequency  or  temperature  influence.  This  confirms  that
the  primary  dispersive  and  temperature  effects  are  dependent  on  pore  fluids.  When  saturated
with glycerine, strong temperature and frequency dependence is obvious. Shear velocity is not
independent of the fluid, but increases with increasing fluid viscosity, indicating a viscous con-
tribution to the shear modulus. Vp increases with viscosity also. More importantly, the disper-

uration with glycerine, dispersion occurs both in Vp and Vs. This dispersion is shifted to lower frequencies
at lower temperatures because of the increased glycerine viscosity.

sion curve shows a systematic shift to lower frequencies with increasing velocities, consistent
with squirt flow.

Attenuation  (1/Q)  and  velocity  dispersion  are  strongly  dependent  on  pore  phase  and  com-
pressibility,  particularly  as  controlled  by  partial  gas  saturation.  Attenuation  could  become  a
valuable direct hydrocarbon indicator (e.g., Tanner and Sheriff101). More recently, Klimentos102
used  the  ratio  of  compressional  to  shear  attenuations  as  a  hydrocarbon  indicator  in  well  logs.
Unfortunately, application of these properties is not frequent because of incomplete understand-
ing  of  the  phenomena  and  lack  of  appropriate  tools  to  extract  the  information.  Laboratory
measurements  at  frequencies  and  amplitudes  encompassing  the  seismic  range  have  confirmed
the  strong  dependence  on  partial  gas  saturation  (Fig.  13.50a).  However,  attenuation  is  de-
creased by confining pressure, dropping rapidly as pressure increases (Fig. 13.50b). Attenuation
peaks will also depend on specific rock characteristics. Absorption peaks seen in one frequency
band may not be apparent in others.

With the improving quality of seismic data, maps of the estimated attenuation are becoming
a  common  displayed  attribute.  The  relative  values  of  1/Q  measured  through  time-lapse  reser-
voir  monitoring  are  becoming  robust.  As  indicated  in  Fig.  13.50a,  1/Q  will  be  sensitive  to
many of the common recovery processes.

13.6 Rock Failure Relationships

13.6.1 Introduction.  In  this  section,  we  will  go  through  the  various  relationships  describing
mechanical failure in rocks. This is important because under reservoir pressure and stress condi-
tions,  production  can  induce  rock  failure,  sometime  with  catastrophic  effects.  By  applying
strength  criteria,  within  reservoir  simulators  we  can  predict  when  problems  might  occur.  In
Section  13.5,  we  examined  the  elastic  behavior,  which  was  largely  reversible.  Here  we  deal

with  permanent  deformation.  By  rock  failure,  we  mean  the  formation  of  faults  and  fracture
planes, crushing, and relative motion of individual mineral grains and cements. Failure can in-
volve formation of discrete fracture zones and the more “ductile” or homogeneous deformation.
The later deformation is caused by a broad distribution of fracture zones or general grain crush-
ing  during  compaction.  We  will  not  consider  deformation  caused  by  plastic  strains  of  the
mineral components, as is common in salt and in calcite at higher temperatures. In our analy-
sis,  several  assumptions  are  made:  The  material  is  isotropic  and  homogeneous;  stresses  are
applied uniformly; textural characteristics such as grain size and sorting have no influence; tem-

perature and strain rate are ignored; and the intermediate stresses are presumed to play no role.
Each  of  these  assumptions  can  be  violated,  and  some  have  been  demonstrated  to  have  major
influences on rock strength.

13.6.2 Coulomb-Navier Failure.  To begin with, a brief review of the standard Mohr failure
criteria  will  be  examined  to  introduce  concepts  and  define  terms,  as  well  as  to  establish  the
basic mathematics behind the strength relationships. Units of stress and strength are the same
as pressure and were covered previously. More detailed descriptions can be found in standard
textbooks (i.e., Jaeger103). Mohr circles and a linear failure envelope are the most common meth-
ods  used  to  plot  stresses  and  indicate  strength  limits.  This  technique  predicts  failure  when
stresses  surpass  both  the  intrinsic  strength  of  a  rock  and  internal  friction.  The  primary  terms
and characteristics are shown in Fig. 13.51. Normal stresses across any plane are plotted on the
horizontal  axis,  and  shear  stresses  are  plotted  on  the  vertical  axis.  Compressive  stresses  are
defined as positive (as opposed to the mechanical engineering convention of tensional stresses
being  positive).  For  the  hydrostatic  case,  all  stresses  are  equal;  this  stress  state  is  represented
by a point on the horizontal axis. When stresses differ, the maximum principal stress, σ1, and
minimum stress, σ3, are plotted on the horizontal axis and the possible shear stresses along any
plane fall on a hemisphere connecting σ1 and σ3 (Fig. 13.52). The mean stress, σm, and radius
of this circle, r, are simple sums and differences of the principal stresses.

σm = /2

r = /2

1 (σ1 − σ3). ........................................................... (13.111)

The normal stress across any plane, σn, and the shear stress along the plane, τ, are functions

of the principal stresses and the plane orientation.

where θ is the angle between the plane and the σ3 direction.

From Eqs. 13.114 and 13.115, the maximum shear occurs along a plane oriented at θ =  π
4
(45°). However, because of friction, rocks do not fail along this plane. Instead, failure occurs
along  some  rotated  plane  where  friction  is  lower,  yet  shear  stress  is  still  high.  This  failure
point (or plane) is shown in Fig. 13.51 as the nearly diagonal line. Fig. 13.51 also shows the
associated normal and shear stresses. If numerous failure tests are made and plotted, an enve-
lope is defined as in Fig. 13.52. In this case, friction is assumed to be a simple linear function
of normal stress, and the resulting envelope is also linear. The slope of this envelope is α, and
we define μ as the angle of internal friction

μ = tan−1α. .............................................................. (13.116)

Within this framework, we can define several important properties of the rock as shown in Fig.
13.52:

C0 = Uniaxial or unconfined compressive strength (σ3 = 0)
Cu = Cohesive strength or the intercept of the envelope with σn = 0.
Ct = Tensional strength.

The failure envelope is then defined by the line

τ = Cu + α σn. ............................................................ (13.117)

If the rock has already been broken, or a fracture already exists, then both Cu and Ct will be
close to zero.

Several  useful  equations  can  be  derived  from  the  geometric  relationships  shown  so  far.

From the equation for a circle,

If the envelope could be continued into the tensional region, the tensional strength could easily
be obtained:

Ct =

Cu
α . ............................................................... (13.126)

Under  tension,  the  stresses  are  negative,  although  the  tensional  strength  is  a  positive  number.
Thus, if rocks could fail according to a constant internal friction, we would have a simple way
to relate the stresses involved and need only a couple of material constants, such as Cu and α.

13.6.3 Mohr Failure, Curved Envelopes, and Hoek-Brown Relationships.  We are immediate-
ly  faced  with  two  problems  when  we  try  to  apply  Coulomb-Navier failure criteria: (1)  Rocks
do  not  generally  have  a  linear  failure  envelope,  and  (2)  material  properties  controlling  failure
must be obtained either through logs or assumed behavior. Fig. 13.53 shows the type of enve-
lope  commonly  seen.  In  fact,  we  know  that  the  slope  must  change  as  stresses  are  increased
because rocks begin yielding and act more plastically. Fig. 13.54 shows the generalized behav-
ior  expected.  At  normal  stresses  above  the  brittle-ductile  transition,  failure  can  no  longer  be
maintained  on  a  single  plane,  but  is  distributed  more  homogeneously  throughout  the  sample.
We must develop different failure criteria, one that produced an appropriately curved envelope,
and we expect it to have a strong porosity dependence (Fig. 13.55).

Numerous  failure  criteria  have  been  proposed  that  are  primarily  empirically  based.  Table
13.12  shows  some  of  the  criteria  proposed  both  for  general  purposes  and  for  specific  rock
types or conditions. Observed failure envelopes are smooth forms so simple exponential or power-
law  functions  can  usually  be  found  that  fit  the  data  well.  The  relations  of  Bienlawski111  and
Hoek  and  Brown112  are  most  common.  Much  of  the  recent  work  in  rock  mechanics  has  been
directed toward ascertaining the constants of these relationships in terms of easily measurable
rock  properties.  Note  that  these  relationships  apply  primarily  to  the  brittle  failure  regime  and
cannot be used for grain crushing or pore collapse (as we shall see later) or when substantial

ductile or plastic deformation is involved. We will examine these proposed forms to interrelate
terms and reduce unknowns to variables that can be derived from logs.

Hoek and Brown112 compiled extensive data on a variety of rock types and produced rela-
tionships  that  are  simple  and  can  be  developed  into  forms  amenable  to  well-log  analysis.  A
primary feature of this failure criterion is a relation between the maximum and minimum stress-
es when both are normalized by the uniaxial compressive strength

This  formulation  was  motivated  by  the  systematic  behavior  seen  in  many  tests  as  shown  in
Fig. 13.56. In Eq. 13.127, m and s are material constants dependent on the overall quality of
the  rock  mass,  and  m  is  also  dependent  on  the  rock  type  (Table  13.13).  Note  that  we  could
derive the value for m from a mineralogic analysis. In our analysis, we will presume that the
local rock mass of interest is intact, and thus

Such normalized stress states were used to construct the curved envelope in Fig. 13.54.

Other basic properties are not so simply derived.

We  must  produce  from  the  stress  relationships  (Eqs.  13.127  or  13.130)  an  equation  for  a
failure envelope that permits us to resolve the shear and normal stresses on a failure plane, its
orientation, and an approximation of the internal friction, and simply predict regions of instabil-
ity.  The  general  envelope  shapes  seen  in  Figs.  13.54  and  13.56  suggest  a  form  like  that
proposed by Murrell107 and Bienlawski111:

I-648

where  A,  b,  and  n  are  material  constants.  Because  the  envelope  intersects  the  horizontal  axis
when the normal stress equals the tensional strength,

When the normal stress is zero, the envelope intersects the vertical axis at the cohesion value
Cu. From Eq. 13.134, this requires

Therefore, the general form for an envelope is

where β is a value around 0.5. We could substitute this term into Eqs. 13.141 and 13.142 and
solve for β. However, this results in a rather complicated root to a third-order polynomial. For-
tunately,  by  iteration,  we  can  show  that  β  is  relatively  constant  at  about  0.62  with  little
dependence on m. Using this value of β in Eq. 13.143 and substituting into the previous equa-
tions gives us our cohesion. For a sandstone with m = 15, we get

Fig. 13.57—Examples of reported uniaxial compressive strength (Co) relations for different rock types.

The definition of our curved envelope in Eq. 13.137 is not strictly compatible with the Hoek-
Brown  stress  relations.  However,  we  can  get  an  estimate  of  the  exponent,  n,  by  using  our
tensile  and  cohesion  strengths  and  some  reasonable  value  of  σn  such  as  σn  =  C0.  From  Fig.
13.54, we can see that τ is approximately 1.1 C0 at this point. From Eq. 13.137, with m equal
to 15,

n = 0.71. ................................................................ (13.145)

This value falls within the range of 0.65 to 0.75 suggested by Yudhbir et al.113 Thus, from a
presumed simple relation between σ1 and σ3, almost all the necessary parameters can be derived.

13.6.4 Uniaxial  Compressive  Strength.    We  have  seen  how  a  general  rock  failure  criterion
can be reduced to a few parameters dependent on lithology (m) and the uniaxial compressive
strength (C0). Lithology is commonly derived during log analysis, so m may be estimated (Ta-
ble 13.13). What is needed still is an initial measure of rock strength provided by C0. C0 can
be estimated from porosity or sonic velocities, but many factors such as grain size, clay con-
tent, or saturation have significant influences.

A large amount of C0 data is available and, although there is considerable scatter, C0 usual-
ly varies systematically with other rock characteristics. We will concentrate on porosity as the
primary controlling factor because it is routinely available from logs and is a fundamental in-
put into reservoir simulators.

Numerous relationships have been developed to estimate C0, often in conjunction with gen-
eral rock strength relationships. Table 13.14 lists many of the proposed relations for C0, some
of which are plotted for various rock types in Fig. 13.57 and for sandstones in Fig. 13.58. We
expect  C0  to  decrease  as  porosity  increases.  At  some  transition  porosity,  rocks  will  lose  all

initial strength and become merely a loose aggregate. No matter which relationship is chosen,
variables such as cementation, alteration, texture, and so on can cause significant scatter.

If we accept the restrictive relationships for failure of Eq. 13.130 or 13.134, we can derive

C0 from any such strength data:

C0 = − 25m + 25(m2 − 2.4Φ−1.63) /2

1

........................................... (13.146)

However, this equation predicts a finite strength even as porosity approaches 1.0. More realis-
tic  forms  must  be  used  so  that  strength  vanishes  at  some  porosity  Φc.  This  limiting  porosity
was shown as a crossover porosity from rock to a slurry by Raymer et al.119 and was referred
to  as  “critical  porosity”  elsewhere.  Jizba108  used  such  a  concept  to  derive  a  general  strength
relationship for sandstones:

τ = 37(0.36 − Φ)1.05σn

0.6, ................................................... (13.147)

where τ and σn are the shear and normal stresses at failure.

The  0.36  within  the  parentheses  is  her  presumed  value  for  Φc.  Notice,  however,  that  this
form  indicates  that  sandstones  have  no  tensile  or  cohesive  strength.  We  can  obtain  a  better
result  by  using  Jizba’s  relationship  at  elevated  confining  pressure  (say,  50  MPa),  where  it  is
more valid, and recasting the trend in terms of Eq. 13.130, as we did for the Scott relation.105
Dobereiner  and  DeFreitas121  measured  several  weak  sandstones,  and  their  results  suggest  that
critical porosity is approximately 0.42. Using this critical porosity, we derive a uniaxial com-
pressive strength

This  C0  equation  is  plotted  in  Fig.  13.58  along  with  the  modified  Scott110  and  Jizba108  equa-
tions and data of Dobereiner and DeFreitas.121

13.6.5 Compaction Strength.  As was indicated in Fig. 13.55, at some elevated stress or con-
fining pressure, the rock will begin to show ductile deformation. The grain structure begins to
collapse, and the rock will compact and lose porosity. This compaction strength, Cc, is itself a
function  of  porosity  as  well  as  mineralogy,  diagenesis,  and  texture.  In  Figs.  13.59a  and
13.59b,  the  behavior  of  two  rocks  under  hydrostatic  pressure  is  shown.  The  high-porosity
(33%) sandstone (Fig. 13.59a) has a low “crush” strength of about 55 MPa. With a lower poros-
ity of 19%, Berea sandstone has a much higher strength of 440 MPa (Fig. 13.59b). Notice that
in both Figs. 13.59a and 59b, permanent deformation remains even after the stress is released.
This hysteresis demonstrates the damage to the matrix structure caused by exceeding the crush
strength.

In  the  cases  in  which  studies  are  restricted  to  sandstones,  an  exponential  dependence  on
porosity is usually observed (Fig. 13.59a). Scott110 fit his and the Dunn et al.106 data to the form

σ f = 38.95Φ−0.815 at σ3 = 50 MPa . ......................................... (13.149)

With a general relationship available for uniaxial compressive strength and the compaction lim-
it, rock failure envelopes can be determined for sandstones at any porosity. Fig. 13.60 shows
the complete envelopes for the porosity range 0.15 to 0.35.

13.6.6 Clay  Content.    Most  sandstones  are  mixtures  of  mineral  such  as  feldspars,  calcite,
dolomite,  micas,  clays,  and  of  course  quartz.  Clays  are  a  very  common  component  and  can
make  up  anywhere  from  0  to  nearly  100%  of  a  clastic  rock.  Usually,  at  some  point  greater
than  40%  clay,  the  rock  is  considered  a  shale  or  mudstone  rather  than  a  sandstone  (refer  to
Section 13.7). The structure of clay minerals and their typical methods of bonding are signifi-

communication); (b) hydrostatic compaction of Berea sandstone (T.E. Scott, personal communication).

cantly different from those of quartz, so we would expect clays to strongly influence mechani-
cal  properties.  Such  influences  depend  on  the  nature  of  the  clay,  the  amount  and  location
within the rock framework, and the state of hydration.

There  have  been  few  systematic  studies  of  clay  effects  on  the  mechanical  properties  of
rocks.  Corbett  et  al.120  demonstrated  how  the  coefficient  of  internal  friction  and  thus  the
strength of Austin chalk strongly depends on even a small clay fraction (Fig. 13.61). In particu-
lar,  smectite  content  was  found  to  have  more  influence  in  this  case  than  other  clays.  This
allows us to derive a general relationship between failure and clay content.

σ f = 405 − 977Φ − 3557C + (1.85 − 0.039Φ)σ3, ................................ (13.150)

where C is the smectite fraction. Unfortunately, this equation was developed for dry samples.

Jizba114  tested  several  dry  clay-rich  samples  and  proposed  a  general  linear  envelope  form

for shales and shaley sandstones.

τ = 63(1 − 1.15C') = 0.7σn. ................................................. (13.151)

More  relevant  data,  however,  comes  from  Steiger  and  Leung122  with  both  dry  and  saturated
shale  measurements  (Fig.  13.62).  From  these  data,  we  derive  an  approximation  for  the  wet
shale uniaxial compressional strength.

C0 = 88 − 110C. .......................................................... (13.152)

Brown parameter m = 15 used.

This relation, as well as those for the Austin chalk, suggests a strong clay dependence. Jizba,108
however, reported only a slight dependence of C0 on clay content in shaley sands.

It  is  likely that in  many  sands,  clays  reside  as  pore-filling materials and  have  only  a  sec-
ondary  effect  on  mechanical  properties.  At  this  point,  we  expect  clays  to  have  a  significant
effect even in fairly pure sands (this will be seen also in sonic velocity measurements). Thus, a
more general form for uniaxial compressive strength of sandstones would be

C0 = − 25m + 25{m2 + 2520(0.42 − Φ)2.8} /2

1

− aC, .............................. (13.153)

where  the  coefficient a  has  a  value of  approximately 100.  The  influence of  clays  on  the  me-
chanical properties of rocks needs much further investigation.

13.6.7 Pore Fluid Effects.  Fluids can alter rock mechanical properties of rocks through fluid
pressure,  chemical  reactions  with  mineral  surfaces,  and  by  lubricating  moving  surfaces.  The
primary  fluids  encountered  are  brines  and  hydrocarbon  oils  and  gases.  Drilling,  completion,
and fracturing fluids can also be present, and their effects are typically studied to prevent for-
mation  damage.  We  will  concentrate  on  the  role  of  water  and,  in  particular,  how  water
saturation can influence rock strengths measured in the laboratory or derived from well logs.

Effective Stress.  Pore fluid pressures will reduce the effective stress supported by the rock
mineral frame. This effect has been well known since the publication of Terzaghi and Peck63
and has been documented by numerous investigators. The most common form for the effective
stress law is

σe = σa − nPP, ........................................................... (13.154)

I-656

et al.120).

where  σe  is  the  effective  stress,  σa  the  applied  stress  on  the  rock  surface,  Pp,  and  the  pore
pressure.  Note  that  this  is  the  same  as  Eq.  13.35.  The  effective  stress  coefficient  n  is  also
called Biot’s poroelastic term.

n = 1 −

Kd
Ko

, ........................................................... (13.155)

where  Kd  is  the  dry  rock  bulk  modulus  and  Ko  the  mineral  bulk  modulus.  Because  the  rock
modulus  is  usually  much  lower  than  the  mineral  modulus,  n  is  often  close  to  unity.  In  many
applications and when no other information is available, n is usually taken as one.

In our analyses, all of the stresses used to describe rock failure were actually effective stress-
es. Rock failure can be dramatically affected by pore pressure, as indicated in Fig. 13.63. An
envelope is plotted for a sandstone with porosity of 25%. For applied principal stresses of 225
MPa for σ1, 175 MPa for σ3, and a Pp of 75 MPa, the effective Mohr circle plots well within
the field of stability. The pore pressure has been subtracted from both applied stresses to give
effective  principal  stresses  of  150  and  100  MPa.  If  pore  pressure  is  increased,  the  effective
stresses decrease, and the Mohr circle is shifted left until eventually the envelope may be con-
tacted and the rock fails by brittle fracture. On the other hand, if pore pressure decreases, the
Mohr circle shifts right, and the rock may contract the Roscoe surface and fail by compaction
or grain crushing. In any case, if pore pressures are known, their effects can be accounted for
in a straightforward way.

Chapter 13—Rock Properties

I-657

Fig. 13.62—Effect of increasing clay content on strength.

Fig. 13.63—Rock failure caused by either increasing or decreasing pore pressure. Increased pore pressure
decreases effective stress, leading to fracture failure. Decreasing pore pressure increases effective stress,
which can produce crushing.

Problems can arise experimentally because of the inability of pore pressure to reach equilib-
rium. If fluid can flow freely and constant pore pressure is maintained, then an experiment is
termed “drained.” If deformation is too rapid, permeability low, fluid viscosity high, or bound-
aries are sealed, then fluid is trapped in the rock, and fluid pressure changes as a function of
rock deformation. Brace and Martin123 showed that strain rates must be very low in crystalline
rocks  of  low  permeability  to  maintain  a  uniform  pore  pressure  and  follow  a  macroscopically
defined effective stress law such as Eq. 13.154. For most sandstones, permeability is sufficient
to  provide  drained  conditions.  Problems  usually  occur  in  low-permeability  rocks  such  as  silt-
stone  or  shales.  Considerable  effort  and  time  are  usually  needed  to  allow  constant  pore
pressure,  or  merely  to  maintain  pore  pressure  equilibrium  (Steiger  and  Leung122).  Tests  are

made under undrained conditions, but the resulting changes in pore pressure must then be mea-
sured or otherwise calculated. These effects are mechanical problems that are often difficult to
deal with, but the processes are basically well understood.

Zhang131).

Chemical Effects.  A more subtle problem involves chemical effects of pore fluids. Water is
an  active,  polar  compound,  and  numerous  investigations  (Griggs124  and  Kirby125)  have  shown
that even small amounts of water or brine can have a substantial influence on rock mechanical
properties.  Colback  and  Wiid126  demonstrated  how  even  changes  in  the  relative  humidity  or
partial  pressure  of  water  in  the  pores  can  lower  rock  strength  dramatically  (Fig.  13.64).  Col-
back and Wiid126 and Dunning and Huff127 saw a direct relationship between the loss in rock
strength and the chemical activity of the pore fluid. Meredith and Atkinson,128 Freeman,129 and
others have shown increased crack velocities and acoustic emissions at constant crack intensity
factors  when  water  is  introduced.  Ujtai  et  al.130  saw  substantial  effects  of  water  on  all  time-
dependent tests for creep strain, fatigue, and slow crack growth. In general, uniaxial compres-
sive  strength  is  reduced  by  20  to  25%  in  wet  rocks.  This  implies  that  many  laboratory
measurements result in rock strengths that are systematically too high.

A strong influence of the chemical activity on rock mechanical properties is supported by
other  types  of  measurements.  Seismic  properties  depend  upon  mineral  grain  stiffness  and  the
stiffness of grain-to-grain contacts. In completely dry rocks (oven-dried under vacuum), there is
almost no seismic attenuation, and rocks are stiff. Even small amounts of water, a few mono-
layers, can appreciably lower rock stiffness and seismic velocities.

Uniaxial compressive strength is derived using Eq. 13.153. Weaker sands can be identified and failure
predicted based on in-situ stresses around a borehole and a particular production scenario (red zones).

Bulk Lubrication.  Common experience leads us to expect many geologic materials, such as
soils,  to  be  substantially  weaker  when  wet.  We  have  already  seen  this  effect  in  chalk  and
shales. Surface bonding energies and water surface tension result in strong capillary forces that
draw and hold water in pore spaces. Water penetrates and separates grains. Grain movement is
facilitated by motion in mobile fluid layers. This is a highly scientific way of saying “slippery
when wet.” Clay minerals in particular are well known for their ability to absorb large quanti-
ties of water. Swelling properties of clays and shales are often studied for drilling engineering
purposes.  Not  only  do  clays  have  lower  friction surfaces  when  wet,  but  water  absorption  and
the resulting clay expansion can disaggregate the rock matrix. Loss of strength because of such
mechanisms is more important in poorly consolidated or unconsolidated sediments. Dobereiner
and DeFreitas121 and Morgenstern et al.131 report a 60% reduction in strength for muddy sedi-
ments upon saturation. At this point, we have not developed a systematic way of including a

Russell137).

lubrication factor except as an implicit part of the clay corrections mentioned previously or as
a measured reduction of the shear or Young’s modulus. We would expect the loss of intergrain
friction to reduce the shear modulus significantly.

13.6.8 Grain Size and Texture.  In granular rocks, grain size also influences strength. For con-
stant  porosity,  mineralogy,  and  texture,  a  smaller  grain  size  means  greater  strength.  This
tendency  has  been  observed  in  several  sandstones  and  can  be  understood  in  terms  of  grain
contact models. Nelson132 presents data on Navajo sandstone strength indicating a strong depen-
dence  on  grain  size.  If  a  rock  can  be  considered  an  aggregate  of  uniform  spheres,  smaller
spheres  will  have  more  grain  contacts  per  unit  volume.  Loads  are  distributed  over  more  con-
tracts,  and  each  grain  experiences  lower  stresses.  Zhang133  used  Hertzian  contact  theory  to
calculate  critical  crushing  strengths  of  quartz  sands  and  found  that  porosity  and  grain  radius
combine  to  determine  strength  (Fig.  13.65).  By  fixing  grain  size,  Zhang’s  relationships  could
also  provide  crushing  or  compaction  limits  (Roscoe  surfaces,  Fig.  13.60)  for  sands  at  various
porosities. For a grain size of 0.2 mm, we get a crushing strength, Cc, of

Cc = 13.9

Φ ............................................................... (13.156)

However, factors such as cementation and grain angularity will strongly alter this simple rela-
tionship.

If grains become cemented, not only does porosity decrease, but the effective area of inter-
granular contracts increases. Even small amounts of cement will increase strength substantially.
Angularity of grains and sorting will also influence strength. More angular grains result in sharp-
er point contacts, stress concentrations, and lower strength.

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Fig. 13.68—Gamma-ray energy levels resulting from disintegration of unstable isotopes (adapted from
Tittman et al.96).

In general, if grain size is known to be smaller or cementation greater (for a given porosity
and composition), then increased strength can be estimated by reducing the Hoek-Brown coeffi-
cient  m.  A  value  of  m  =  0  for  siltstones  and  shales  was  suggested  by  Hoek  and  Brown.134
Notice that this leads to minor contradiction because clays, with very fine grain size, weaken
rocks.  It  is  possible  that  many  of  Hoek  and  Brown’s  “shales”  were  well  indurated  (slightly
metamorphosed?), and grain size and increased cementation account for the increased strength
(and reduced m). In rocks with low levels of diagenesis, clays reduce strength and require an
increased m.

13.6.9 Rock Strength From Logs.  Several  techniques  have  been  proposed  for  deriving  rock
strength  from  well  log  parameters.  Coates  and  Denoo135  calculated  stresses  induced  around  a
borehole and estimated failure from assumed linear envelopes with strength parameters derived
from  shear  and  compressional  velocities.  They  relied  on  the  work  of  Deere  and  Miller136  to
provide  estimates  of  compressive  strength  from  dynamic  measurements.  Simplified  forms  of
these relations are:

C0 = 1.839 E1058 for limestone.............................................. (13.157a)

C0 = 4.746 E0.9665 for sandstone............................................ (13.157b)

where  C0  is  uniaxial  compressive  strength  and  E  is  dynamic  Young’s  modulus  (see  Section
13.5). Alternatively, we can include an empirical dependence of the internal friction angle, α,
or the porosity, Φ.

Eqs.  13.159  and  13.160  provide  a  way  to  derive  strengths  assuming  a  linear  envelope,  and
provided that compressional and shear velocity, lithology (e.g., gamma ray or SP), and density
logs are available. If there is no shear log, one can be derived from the compressional velocity
log and Vp-Vs relationships previously shown in Table 13.7.

The  strength-porosity  trend  shown  in  Eq.  13.146  and  modulus-porosity  trends  in  Section

13.5 imply a correlation between strength and shear modulus for sandstone:

If  we  presume  a  simple  relationship  between  compressional  velocity  of  brine-saturated  sand-
stones and shear velocity as developed by Castagna et al.,4 we get

The  shear  modulus  (or  velocity)  should  be  the  most  sensitive  measure  of  strength,  and  shear
properties are little affected by fluid saturations. Whenever possible, shear wave data should be
collected and used in this analysis. If only compressional data is available, care must be used
in translating the information into effective gas- or brine-saturated values (see Section 13.5.11).
This is particularly true for partial oil saturations.

In  our  analysis,  C0  was  first  determined  from  porosity.  The  influence  of  clay  content  was
examined separately. The velocity-strength relationships above were derived from the porosity
dependence,  but  clays  are  handled  only  indirectly  through  their  effects  on  velocities.  Strength

parameters can be calculated directly from porosity (Eq. 13.148), but clays must then be includ-
ed,  as  in  Eq.  13.153.  Calculated  strengths  based  directly  on  porosity  and  clay  content  are
shown  in  Fig.  13.66.  These  types  of  logs  can  be  very  valuable  in  detecting  weak  zones  and
units  susceptible  to  failure.  If  at  all  possible,  these  kinds  of  logs  should  be  calibrated  with
strength measurements directly on core samples.

13.7 Gamma Ray Characteristics

13.7.1 Introduction.  The radioactivity of rocks has been used for many years to help derive
lithologies. Natural occurring radioactive materials (NORM) include the elements uranium, tho-
rium,  potassium,  radium,  and  radon,  along  with  the  minerals  that  contain  them.  There  is
usually no fundamental connection between different rock types and measured gamma ray in-
tensity, but there exists a strong general correlation between the radioactive isotope content and
mineralogy.  Observed  distributions  have  been  available  for  numerous  decades.  In  Fig.  13.67,
the distributions of radiation levels observed by Russell137 are plotted for numerous rock types.
Evaporites (NaCl salt, anhydrites) and coals typically have low levels. In other rocks, the gener-
al  trend  toward  higher  radioactivity  with  increased  shale  content  is  apparent.  At  the  high
radioactivity  extreme  are  organic-rich  shales  and  potash  (KCl).  These  plotted  values  can  in-
clude  beta  as  well  as  gamma  radioactivity  (collected  with  a  Geiger  counter).  Modern  tech-
niques concentrate on gamma ray detection.

The primary radioactive isotopes in rocks are potassium-40 and the isotope series associat-
ed with the disintegration of uranium and thorium. Fig. 13.68 shows the equilibrium distribu-
tion  of  energy  levels  associated  with  each  of  these  groups.  Potassium-40  (K40)  produces  a
single  gamma  ray  of  energy  of  1.46  MeV  as  it  transforms  into  stable  calcium.  On  the  other
hand, both thorium (Th) and uranium (U) break down to form a sequence of radioactive daugh-
ter  products.  Subsequent  breakdown  of  these  unstable  isotopes  produces  a  variety  of  energy
levels. Standard gamma ray tools measure a very broad band of energy including all the prima-

ry  peaks  as  well  as  lower-energy  daughter  peaks.  As  might  be  expected  from  Fig.  13.68,  the
total count can be dominated by the low-energy decay radiation.

The radionuclides, including radium, may become more mobile in formation waters found
in oil fields. Typically, the greater the ionic strength (salinity), the higher the radium content.
Produced waters can have slightly higher radioactivity than background. In addition, the radionu-
clides are often concentrated in the solid deposits (scale) formed in oilfield equipment. When
enclosed  in  flow  equipment  (pipes,  tanks,  etc.)  this  elevated  concentration  is  not  important.
However, health risks may occur when equipment is cleaned for reuse or old equipment is put
to different application.

Table  13.15  lists  some  of  the  common  rock  types  and  their  typical  content  of  potassium,
uranium, and thorium. Potassium is an abundant element, so the radioactive K40 is widely dis-
tributed (Table 13.16). Potassium feldspars and micas are common components in igneous and
metamorphic rocks. Immature sandstones can retain an abundance of these components. In ad-
dition, potassium is common in clays. Under extreme evaporitic conditions, KCl (sylvite) will
be  deposited  and  result  in  very  high  radioactivity  levels.  Uranium  and  thorium,  on  the  other
hand,  are  much  less  common.  Both  U  and  Th  are  found  in  clays  (by  absorption),  volcanic
ashes, and heavy minerals.

13.7.2 Measurement.  Gamma ray logs are among the most common and useful tools in the
oil  and  gas  industry.  Originally,  measurements  were  reported  in  count  rates,  but  all  modern
tools  are  calibrated  to  API  units.  Typical  sedimentary  response  ranges  from  0  to  200  in  API
units. Gamma ray log character is one of the primary methods used to correlate the stratigraph-
ic section. For most engineering and geophysical applications, the gamma ray log is primarily
used to extract lithologic, mineralogic, or fabric estimates.

The most common use of gamma ray logs is to estimate the shale “volume” in rocks. It is
important to remember that the tool measures radioactivity, and the correlation to shale content
is empirical. Shales are presumed to be composed of clay minerals. Thus, the gamma ray level
is  assumed  to  be  correlated  with  grain  size.  In  reality,  shales  may  be  composed  of  30%  or
more of quartz and other minerals. The clays within the shales may not be radioactive, and the
adjacent sands may contain radioactive isotopes. However, radioactivity levels typically are re-

The log response depends on the radiation, tool characteristics, and logging parameters. A
30-cm sodium iodide scintillation crystal with a photomultiplier tube is a common detector con-
figuration. Thin, highly radioactive beds may be detected, but cannot be resolved below about
0.25  m.  Radiation  is  damped  primarily  by  formation  material  electron  density  and  Compton
scattering. This limits the depth of investigation to around 30 cm, although it will depend on
the  energy  levels.  Because  the  radioactive  decay  is  a  statistical  process,  slower  logging  rates
produce  better  results.  The  low  number  of  counts  resulting  from  logging  too  fast  cannot  be
increased  by  logging  rate  correction  factors.  Most  tools  are  usually  out  of  calibration  if  they
are not centered in the borehole. Heavy barite mud can also lower the overall count rate, partic-
ularly for low-energy gamma rays.

Rather than merely measuring total gamma radiation, the energy levels can be detected sep-
arately. This allows the concentrations of K, U, and Th to be derived as independent parame-
ters. Fig. 13.69 shows the energy windows used in a Baker-Atlas tool. This would allow, for
example, the feldspars in immature sands to be separated from clays with adsorbed U or Th.

and  radioactivity  level  measured  directly;  crosses  are  fine-grained  sands,  while  dots  are  silts
and clay-rich rocks.

To  extract  the  shale  content  in  rocks,  a  linear  or  near-linear  relation  is  used  to  convert  a
gamma ray index, Igr, to shale volume Vsh. Because local sands can contain radioactive compo-
nents,  and  the  shales  may  vary  with  depth,  local  baseline  levels  are  chosen  near  the  zone  of
interest.

Igr =

R − Rcleansand
Rshale − R , ...................................................... (13.163)
where R is the measured radiation level, Rcleansand is the baseline level through a reference sand,
and Rshale is the baseline through a representative shale. Several relations have been developed
to derive shale volume (Fig. 13.71). A linear relation simply sets the shale content equal to the
gamma ray index.

lines are locally established; then, shale content is a linear interpolation between the two.

Vsh = Igr................................................................. (13.164)

Other proposed relations shown in Fig. 13.71 are defined in Table 13.17. Several assumptions
are made in these evaluations:

• Compositions of sand and shale components are constant.

Chapter 13—Rock Properties

I-671

Fig. 13.74—A measured core gamma-ray profile vs. logged data in a carbonate section. Comparison of
peaks shows the offset in measured depth (adapted from Core Labs data).

• Baselines  are  chosen  on  representative  “shales”  and  “clean”  sands  (although  these  terms

are very subjective).

• Simple mixture laws apply.
• Fabric is not important.

Many of these assumptions may be poor approximations.

A more likely presumption is that the radiation level is dependent on the mixture densities
and  not  volumes  (Wahl139  and  Katahara140).  In  this  case,  a  fabric  analysis  can  also  be  per-
formed. Katahara139 modeled the shale component of shaly sands as existing in three forms:

• Structural—an original depositional granular form.
• Dispersed—clay distributed through the rock and pore space.
• Laminated—thin layers of shale cutting the sand beds.
In Fig. 13.72, his results show a surprisingly simple form. The conclusion is that in most

cases, the simple linear relation is appropriate.

As  an  example  of  this  process,  the  shale  content  of  a  zone  in  a  Gulf  of  Mexico  well  is
estimated. In Fig. 13.73, a sand-shale sequence gives a gamma ray range of approximately 20
to 90 API units. A baseline of approximately 25 is chosen through the sand, and a baseline of
approximately 98 is chosen for the shale. Using the relations in Eqs. 13.163 and 13.164 result
in the shale volume estimates scaled at the bottom of the logged zone.

Gamma radiation levels can also be measured on core. This technique provides a profile of
levels  along  the  length  of  the  core.  The  primary  use  is  to  correlate  core  depths  to  logged
depths. An example is shown in Fig. 13.74. This procedure can be used to identify log features
or positioning of the cored interval. Especially when core recovery is poor, this method is very
useful  in  tying  the  core  fragments  to  true  depths.  Core  plugs  can  also  be  measured,  although
special equipment must be used to record the low levels of radiation associated with the small
samples.  In  general,  property  correlations  to  the  measured  gamma  ray  levels  are  much  better
for cores than for the log because of the depth averaging in the log.141

Single-Phase Permeability

14.1 Introduction
The  capacity  to  flow  fluids  is  one  of  the  most  important  properties  of  reservoir  rocks.  As  a
result, extensive research has been applied to describe and understand the permeability of rocks
to  fluid  flow.  In  this  chapter,  only  single-phase  or  absolute  permeability  will  be  considered.
Multiphase relative permeabilities must be derived using relations described in the chapter on
relative permeability and capillary pressure.

Permeability (k) is a rock property relating the flow per unit area to the hydraulic gradient

by Darcy’s law,

q / A = − (k / μ) grad (p − ρgz),................................................ (14.1)

where  p  is  pressure,  ρ  is  fluid  density,  g  is  gravitational acceleration, z  is  elevation, and  μ  is
the dynamic viscosity. The ratio q/A has the units of velocity and is sometimes referred to as
the “Darcy velocity” to distinguish it from the localized velocity of flow within pore channels.
The  natural  unit  of  k  is  length  squared;  however,  petroleum  usage  casts  Eq.  14.1  in  mixed
units, so that the unit of k is the darcy, which is defined as the permeability of a porous medi-
um  filled  with  a  single-phase  fluid  of  1-cp  viscosity  flowing  at  a  rate  of  1  cm3/s  per  cross-
sectional  area  of  1  cm2  under  a  gradient  of  1  atm  pressure  per  1  cm.1  Reservoir  rocks  are
usually characterized in millidarcies (md), a unit that is 1/1000 of a darcy. Conversion factors
are  1  darcy  =  0.9869×10-12  m2  or  1  md  =  0.9869×10-11  cm2.  Bass2  noted  that  Darcy’s  law
holds  only  for  viscous  flow  and  that  the  medium  must  be  100%  saturated  with  the  flowing
fluid when the determination of permeability is made. Furthermore, the medium and the fluid
must  not  react  by  chemical  reaction,  absorption,  or  adsorption;  otherwise,  the  permeability
changes as the fluid flows through the sample. Darcy’s law (Eq. 14.1) has many practical appli-
cations, including determination of permeability in the laboratory and wellbore.

In  hydrological  applications,  the  fluid  is  assumed  to  be  water  at  near-surface  conditions.
The viscosity of water is factored into the transport term, which is called hydraulic conductivi-
ty (K) and has the units of velocity. Darcy’s law is then written as

I-688

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

q / A = − K grad (p / ρg − z)................................................... (14.2)

This  version  of  Darcy’s  law  is  not  useful  to  the  petroleum  engineer,  but  it  is  sometimes
handy to be able to convert from hydraulic conductivity units to permeability. To obtain k in
darcies, multiply K in m/s by 1.04×105.

Permeability  is  a  property  of  pore  space  geometry;  specifically,  it  has  been  found  to  be
proportional to (RΦ)2, where R is a pore throat dimension and Φ is porosity. However, a mea-
sure  of  R  is  not  available  unless  capillary  pressure  determinations  have  been  made,  in  which
case permeability has also been determined in the laboratory. Because permeability can be mea-
sured only on a restricted set of samples or from a limited number of well tests, it must often
be derived from other properties or measurements. Porosity and permeability are routinely mea-
sured on core plugs; for this reason, the systematics of permeability and porosity are reviewed
in this chapter.

The  topics  of  fluid  sensitivity  and  stress  also  deserve  consideration.  Many  rocks  contain
clays  or  other  minerals  that  are  sensitive  to  the  pore  fluid.  If  an  incompatible  pore  fluid  is
introduced during a production process, these minerals can change form, swell, or migrate. Per-
meability  can  then  decrease  by  orders  of  magnitude.  As  effective  pressure  is  increased,  pore
space  decreases  and  permeability  is  lowered.  The  change  in  permeability  with  pressure  is
greater at low effective pressures. This pressure dependence is also strong in poorly consolidat-
ed rocks or rocks where flow is dominated by fractures. As rocks become consolidated or well
cemented, the pressure dependence may become negligible.

Finally, the problem of quantitatively predicting permeability from porosity and other mea-
surements that can be made with well logs is examined. To predict permeability, one needs a
physical model and a method of zoning or clustering the data. Models used to predict perme-
ability  from  porosity  and  other  measurable  rock  parameters  fall  into  classes  based  on  grain
size,  mineralogy,  surface  area,  or  pore  dimension  parameters.  Zonation  techniques  include
database, statistical, clustering, and neural network approaches. Ultimately, the choices of mod-
el and zonation method depend on the problem at hand, the data available, and the resources
devoted to the task.

14.2 Petrologic Controls
Permeability values of rocks range over many factors of 10; therefore, permeability is plotted
on  a  logarithmic  scale.  Values  commonly  encountered  in  petroleum  reservoirs  range  from  a
fraction of a millidarcy to several darcies. The log10(k)-Φ plot of Fig. 14.1 shows four data sets
from sands and sandstones, illustrating the reduction in permeability and porosity that occurs as
pore dimensions are reduced with compaction and alteration of minerals (diagenesis). In these
examples,  k  of  newly  deposited  beach  sands  exceeds  30  darcies,  k  of  partially  consolidated
sandstones ranges from 300 to 2,000 md, k of consolidated sandstones ranges from 0.01 to 100
md, and k of tight gas sandstones is <0.01 md. Porosity is reduced from a maximum of 52%
in  newly  deposited  sandstones  to  as  low  as  1%  in  consolidated  sandstones.  In  this  section,
some of the causes of variability in log10(k)-Φ space are examined.

The permeability and porosity of a rock are the result of both depositional and diagenetic
factors (Fig. 14.2) that combine to produce a unique set of pore space geometries as the rock
is formed. Consequently, the heavy line in Fig. 14.2 represents only one of many possible evo-
lutionary paths in log(k)-Φ space. First, consider the depositional factors. Better sorting increas-
es  both  k  and  Φ.  Gravel  and  coarse  grain  size  produce  anomalously  high  k  even  though
decreasing Φ. Very fine grains of silt and detrital clay produce low permeability at high porosi-
ty.  High  quartz  content  can  produce  efficient  systems  having  good  permeability  even  at  low
porosity, whereas sandstones with feldspar or lithic grains may develop significant noneffective
porosity content. Diagenetic effects, starting with compaction and followed by cementation and

alteration of depositional minerals to clays, tend to decrease log(k) proportionately as Φ is de-
creased. Several examples are presented to illustrate these controls.

In  newly  deposited  sands  and  poorly  consolidated  sandstones,  grain  size  correlates  well
with pore size and hence is a primary control on permeability. Grain size ranges for sandstones
are  defined  by  factors  of  two  (Fig.  14.3).  For  example,  a  sand  with  grain  diameters  between
250 and 500 μm is classed as a medium-grained sand. The sedimentological phi scale provides
a  convenient  label  to  the  size  classes,  and  D=2-phi  is  the  grain  diameter  in  mm  (for  example,
2-3=0.125 mm=125 μm). Also shown in Fig. 14.3 are size ranges for various types of carbon-
ates. Note that grain diameters can be as large as 2,000 μm in very coarse-grained sands and
as small as 1 μm in chalks.

14.2.1 Unconsolidated Sandpacks.  One laboratory study deserves examination because it illus-
trates the relationships among grain size, sorting, k, and Φ. Using sand from two Texas rivers,
Beard and Weyl3 sieved 48 sand samples into 8 size classes and 6 sorting classes. Each data
point  shown  in  Fig.  14.4  represents  the  permeability  and  porosity  of  a  sample  with  a  unique

I-690

italics) and diagenetic processes (such as compaction and cementation) on permeability/porosity trends

grain size and sorting. Median grain size ranges from 0.840 mm for the coarse sample to 0.074
mm  for  the  very  fine  sample.  The  authors  present  photomicrographs  of  thin-section  compara-
tors for each of the 48 samples to document the wide range of size and sorting represented by
the sample suite. The maximum permeability value for a well-compacted, unconsolidated sand-
pack is about 500 darcies. Porosity ranges from 23.4% to 43.5%. Note the general increase in
permeability as grain size increases from very fine to coarse and the increase in both porosity
and permeability as sorting progresses from very poor to well sorted.

Consider the extremely well-sorted samples represented by the open-circle data points along
the right-hand edge of Fig. 14.4. For these extremely well-sorted samples, porosity is indepen-
dent  of  grain  size,  as  it  should  be  for  a  packing  of  uniform  spheres.  However,  for  those
samples  that  are  not  well  sorted,  an  increase  in  coarse  grain  content  results  in  somewhat  de-
creased  Φ  even  as  k  increases.  This  pattern  is  preserved  in  some  consolidated  samples.  The
extremely well-sorted samples of Fig. 14.4 also show that log(k) increases in equal increments
as grain size increases. The samples were sized so that the mean grain diameter of each adja-
cent size interval increases by the square root of 2. Permeability increases by a factor of 2 for
each increment of grain size. Thus, Beard and Weyl’s data show that permeability is proportion-
al to the square of grain size. Because theoretical models show that flow is proportional to the
square of the radius of a pore opening, it can be said that Beard and Weyl’s data demonstrate
that pore size is proportional to grain size in sandpacks.

et al.12 See Discussion for explanation of vertical bars showing grain and pore throat sizes in a consoli-
dated sandstone.

14.2.2 Clays and Shales.  The permeability of shales and mudstones determines the effective-
ness  of  seals  for  many  hydrocarbon  reservoirs,  but  measurements  are  few.  Neuzil4  compiled
data  sets  from  12  laboratory  studies  and  7  field  studies  that  provided  ranges  of  permeability
and  porosity  data  in  bottom  muds,  clay,  unconsolidated  sediment,  glacial  till,  clayey  siltstone
and sandstone, claystone, mudstone, and argillite. Permeability is as high as 1 md in unconsoli-
dated  sediment  with  70%  porosity  and  as  low  as  0.01  nanodarcy  (nd)  in  argillite  with  5%
porosity. With few exceptions, permeability ranges over 3 factors of 10 at a given porosity and
decreases progressively as porosity decreases. For example, at a porosity of 20%, permeability
ranges  from  0.1  μd  to  0.1  nd,  a  range  well  below  the  lower  limit  of  k  plotted  in  Fig.  14.1.

bols linked with solid lines denote size ranges; dotted lines distinguish sorting classes.

Although it was expected that permeability would be scale dependent in clays and shales (re-
gional permeability would be greater than laboratory sample permeability because of fractures),
it was found that permeability ranges from the field studies are roughly the same as the labora-
tory studies, thereby indicating a lack of scale dependence.

14.2.3 Sandstones.    Thomson5  describes  continental  sandstones  from  the  Lower  Cretaceous
Hosston  formation  in  Mississippi  (Fig.  14.5):  “Secondary  quartz  cement  and  compaction
through  pressure  solution  of  grains  are  the  principal  causes  of  porosity  reduction.  The  early
introduction of large amounts of dolomite has inhibited compaction of framework grains. Kaoli-
nite  ranges  from  5%  to  15%  of  total  rock  volume.  All  samples  contain  a  little  illite.  The

Chapter 14—Single-Phase Permeability

permeability/porosity plots indicate a progressive and uniform loss of permeability as porosity
is reduced, suggesting that the sandstones underwent a simple diagenetic history, uncomplicat-
ed by such late processes as leaching, development of authigenic clay minerals, and so forth.”
Thomson also suggests that the introduction of hydrocarbons caused a cessation in diagenesis
in the lower part of the reservoir. The effect of grain size remains apparent in the data of Fig.
14.5, although diagenetic effects have blurred the separations seen in Fig. 14.4, so some of the
medium-grained samples have k as low as in the very fine-grained samples.

Permeability in Oligocene-Miocene sandstones ranges from <1.0 to >1,000 md (Fig. 14.6).
Bloch6 reports that the sandstones were deposited in a variety of environments and that litholo-
gy  ranges  from  lithic  arkoses  to  feldspathic  litharenites,  meaning  that  25%  or  more  of  the
primary grain composition is either lithic fragments or feldspar grains. Up to 30% of porosity
is secondary porosity, formed by dissolution of potassium feldspar. Because permeability is >1
darcy at porosity values <20%, the secondary porosity is probably well connected and contribut-
ing to flow. Although the samples with coarsest grain sizes tend to have the highest permeabil-
ity  values,  the  symbols  depicting  different  grain  sizes  are  intermixed,  another  indication  that
secondary porosity is contributing to flow.

Bos7  describes  results  from  an  exploration  well  that  encountered  (1)  clean  sandstone,  (2)
sandstone  with  pores  filled  with  kaolinite,  (3)  laminated  sandstone,  part  clean  and  part  filled
with kaolinite (indicated as “laminated” in Fig. 14.7), and (4) shale. Scanning electron micro-
scope photographs document the extent to which kaolinite fills the pores, thereby reducing k as
shown in Fig. 14.7. Here again we see a linear relationship between log(k) and Φ, with pore-
infilling clays reducing both k and Φ in a fairly systematic fashion.

Wilson8 contends that many clay coatings, particularly on eolian sandstones, formed on the
framework grains before deposition. Their presence actually preserves porosity because quartz
overgrowths  cannot  readily  form.  According  to  Wilson,  many  of  the  largest  petroleum  reser-
voirs (North Sea, North Slope of Alaska) have retained good porosity because of detrital clay
coatings. Samples in which kaolinite and illite occur as clay coatings fall within the boundaries
of the three upper fields in Fig. 14.8. However, fibrous illite can form within the pore space in
the Rotliegend sandstones (lower two fields in Fig. 14.8), reducing the permeability one to two
orders  of  magnitude  compared  with  rocks  in  which  clay  occurs  as  grain  coatings.  Under  the
scanning  electron  microscope,  the  appearance  of  numerous  fine  strands  of  illite  within  pores
makes  it  obvious  why  permeability  is  so  impaired.9  Special  core  preparation  techniques  are
required to preserve clay textures so that laboratory measurements reflect the in-situ permeabil-
ity values.10

14.2.4 Carbonates.  Samples from an oil-productive dolomite facies in the Williston basin of
North Dakota were characterized in terms of the size of dolomite grains.11 Originally deposited
as  a  carbonate  mud,  after  burial  this  facies  was  altered  to  a  sucrosic  dolomite  or  calcareous
dolomite  with  good  intercrystalline  porosity.  At  any  given  porosity,  samples  with  the  larger
dolomite  crystal  sizes  have  the  highest  permeability  (Fig.  14.9).  At  a  given  crystal  size,  an
important  control  on  porosity  is  the  amount  of  calcite,  which  is  believed  to  be  recrystallized
lime  mud.  Vuggy  porosity  is  5%  or  less.  Different  productive  zones  in  the  same  field  may
have different dolomite textures,11 suggesting that original sediment texture and chemistry were
the main factors determining the distribution of crystal sizes.

In the North Sea, oil is produced from Cretaceous and Tertiary chalks, even though perme-
ability  is  <10  md  (Fig.  14.10).  From  measurements  of  specific  surface  area,  the  equivalent
grain diameter is computed to range from 1.0 to 2.7 μm. As indicated in Fig. 14.10, the separa-
tion between the two chalks is attributed to specific surface area, which is higher in the lower-
permeability  Danian  samples  than  in  the  Maastrichtian  samples.  The  addition  of  pore  space
produces  modest  gains  in  permeability  (low  slopes  for  the  two  data  sets  in  Fig.  14.10),  from
which one can infer that a significant fraction of the pore space is poorly connected or of very
small size. Mortensen et al.12 conclude that the intrafossil porosity behaves the same, in terms
of flow, as interparticle porosity.

Lucia13  found  a  size  effect  in  limestones  and  dolostones,  as  evidenced  by  dolostone  data
shown in Fig. 14.11. To obtain petrophysically viable groupings, Lucia grouped all dolomitized
grainstones  with  mud-dominated  samples  having  large  dolomite  crystals  and  grouped  dolomi-
tized  packstones  with  mud-dominated  samples  having  medium-sized  dolomite  crystals  (key  in
Fig. 14.11). He suggests that the plot can be used to estimate permeability of a nonvuggy car-
bonate rock if the porosity and particle size are known. He points out that the effect of vugs is
to increase porosity but not alter permeability much. In Fig. 14.11 we can see the quasilinear log
(k)-Φ  relationship  and  the  decline  in  slope  (and  k)  with  decreasing  grain  size.  It  appears  that
the fundamental controls observed in the sandstones are also present in these selected carbon-
ates, if care is exercised in categorizing the carbonates in terms of grain or crystal size.

14.2.5 Summary: Empirical Trends.  Figs. 14.5 through 14.11 exhibit a linear or piecewise-
linear relationship between log(k) and Φ as determined in many consolidated sandstones and in

carbonates if  care  is  taken to  isolate rock  types.  Such  linear trends  are  often  seen  in  samples
from an individual rock unit or formation. These trends have the general form of

log(k) = a + bΦ............................................................. (14.3)

Eq. 14.3 is strictly an empirical relationship between log(k) and Φ. It is useful when data from
an  area  of  interest  are  available  because  log(k)  can  be  predicted  simply  from  Φ.  However  it
masks the dependence of log(k) on pore throat size and thereby obscures the physics of flow in
porous media, as is shown in a subsequent section.

14.3 Corrections to Core Measurements
Before selecting a method of determining permeability in a specific reservoir, one must first be
assured that the core measurements are appropriate for reservoir conditions. Sample collection,
selection, and preparation are important steps in ensuring that the data set represents the geolo-
gy at in-situ conditions; some precautions are discussed in the chapter on relative permeability
and capillary pressure. Adjustments may be necessary for the type of test fluid and for pressure
effects.

14.3.1 Klinkenberg Effect.  The permeability of a sample to a gas varies with the molecular
weight of the gas and the applied pressure, as a consequence of gas slippage at the pore wall.
Klinkenberg14  determined  that  liquid  permeability  (kL)  is  related  to  gas  permeability  (kg)  by
kL=kg/(1+b/p), where p is the mean flowing pressure and b is a constant for a particular gas in

a given rock type. The correction parameter b is determined by conducting the test at several
flowing pressures and extrapolating to infinite pressure. Alternatively, one can use an empirical
correlation established by Jones15 to estimate b. The correlation, with R2 of 0.90, is based on
measurements  on  384  samples  (mostly  sandstones)  with  permeabilities  ranging  from  0.01  to
2500 md. For helium, bhelium=44.6(k/Φ)-0.447 and for air, bair=0.35bhelium. The units of b are psi
for permeability in units of md and porosity expressed as a fraction. Another empirical correla-
tion was established by Jones and Owens16 for tight gas sandstones with permeabilities ranging
from 0.0001 to 10 md: b=0.86k-0.33, where b is in atm and k is in md. The Klinkenberg correc-
tion is quite important for low-permeability rocks and less important or unimportant for high-
permeability  rocks.  The  value  of  kL  obtained  after  applying  the  correction  represents  the
permeability to a gas at infinite pressure or to a liquid that does not react with the component
minerals of the rock.

14.3.2 Pore Fluid Sensitivity.  The clays or other materials coating grain surfaces can be sensi-
tive  to  pore  fluid.  This  complicates  the  problem  of  describing  permeability  because  flow
properties depend not only on the lithology but also on pore fluid chemistry. This kind of reac-
tion was seen in Fig. 13.6. Measured permeabilities on this sample as a function of salinity are
shown  in  Fig.  14.12.  Samples  were  obtained  after  drying  and  storage,  and  as  a  result,  clays
had collapsed (Fig. 13.6a). This collapsed state did not significantly change when the rock was
saturated with very-high-salinity brine. As the pore fluid decreased in salinity, at a point near
30,000 ppm salt content, the clays expanded and effectively plugged the pore space. This result
demonstrates  the  need  to  take  special  precautions  in  preserving  and  drying  the  core,  as  men-
tioned previously.

ocene (Danian) age, from Mortensen et al.12

In  low-permeability  sandstones,  permeability  to  water  (kw)  is  systematically  less  than  the
Klinkenberg-corrected permeability (kL). A correction equation16 based on >100 samples with a
permeability range of 0.0001<kL<1 md is kw=kL
1.32. The correction is only approximate, as scat-
ter  on  a  graph  of  kw  vs.  kL  is  high  at  kL<0.01  md.  Surprisingly,  the  sensitivity  to  brine
concentration in low-permeability sandstones is reported to be less than that in high-permeabili-
ty sandstones.16

14.3.3 Pressure Dependence.  Permeabilities discussed so far were measured at constant effec-
tive pressure. However, as increasing pressure closes fractures and compresses the pore space,
permeability  will  decrease.  The  magnitude  of  the  change  depends  on  the  rock  fabric.  Weak,
unconsolidated rocks will collapse easily, and the drop in permeability can be dramatic. As the
rock becomes better consolidated, this pressure dependence decreases. On the other hand, even
for  tight  rocks,  as  fractures  are  introduced  and  begin  to  dominate  the  fluid  flow,  this  general
trend is reversed and pressure dependence increases.

The  pressure  dependence  can  often  be  fit  well  with  an  empirical  power  law  and  negative

exponential relation,

where k(pe) is the permeability measured at effective pressure pe, ko is the permeability at zero
pressure,  and  b  is  a  parameter  adjusted  to  fit  each  rock.  This  general  relation  for  normalized
permeability is shown in Fig. 14.13. A larger b factor yields a stronger pressure dependence.

In Fig. 14.14, sample D1452-281 seen previously in Fig. 13.1 is a clean sandstone with a
high  porosity  of  35%.  The  pressure  dependence  is  strong,  as  can  be  seen  in  Fig.  14.14.  A  b
factor of 0.13 fits the general trend of the data (when pressure is expressed in MPa). In more
compacted or cemented samples, such as in Fig. 14.15, with a lower porosity of 18%, the per-
meability  decrease  can  be  fit  well  with  b=0.07.  In  general,  as  cementation  increases,  the
pressure  sensitivity  declines,  and  the  value  of  b  approaches  zero.  On  the  other  hand,  in  low-
porosity, brittle rocks, flow often becomes fracture dominated. Because fractures are compliant
and close easily with pressure, the pressure dependence of permeability again becomes high. In
Fig. 14.16, permeability of a very-low-porosity (0.18%) crystalline rock is plotted on a logarith-
mic scale. Even though the absolute value of permeability is low to begin with, k drops to 1%
of its unconfined value at 100 MPa, and the decline curve can be fit with a b factor of 0.6.

A more elaborate equation relating Klinkenberg-corrected permeability k to effective confin-

ing pressure p is17

where ko, the permeability at zero confining pressure, slope a, pressure coefficient P*, and coef-
ficient C are determined from experimental data. However, if constant values of C=3×10-6 psi-1
and P*=3,000 psi are used, errors are about 5%, and the two remaining coefficients, ko and a,
can be determined if k is determined at only two values of p. Jones17 recommends the use of
1,500  and  5,000  psi,  although  very  poorly  consolidated  samples  may  require  that  the  higher
value of p be reduced so as not to exceed the yield strength of the sample.

In practice, one may be required to correct values of k measured with air at ambient condi-
tions  to  k  for  brine  at  reservoir  conditions.  The  correction  should  be  based  on  samples  and
conditions  for  the  problem  at  hand.  As  a  guide,  Swanson18  established  a  correction  of
kbrine=0.292kair
1.186 for a collection of 24 sandstone and 32 limestone samples (0.002<kbrine<400
md), where kbrine was measured at 1,000-psi effective stress. Swanson’s empirical equation ap-
pears to incorporate all three factors discussed above: the gas slippage effect, presence of brine
as opposed to an inert fluid, and effect of stress.

14.4 Petrophysical Models

14.4.1 Kozeny-Carman Equation.  The problem of predicting permeability is one of selecting
a  model  expressing  k  in  terms  of  other,  measurable  rock  properties.  Historically,  the  first  ap-
proaches  were  based  on  a  tube-like  model  of  rock  pore  space  known  as  the  Kozeny-Carman
relationship.19–22 The derivation of this “equivalent channel model” has been reworked by Pater-
son23 and Walsh and Brace.24 The model assumes that flow through a porous medium can be
represented  by  flow  through  a  bundle  of  tubes  of  different  radii.  Within  each  tube,  the  flow
rate is low enough that flow is laminar rather than turbulent. A tube is assigned a shape factor
f,  a  dimensionless  number  between  1.7  and  3,  and  length  La  that  is  greater  than  the  sample
length  L.  The  assumption  is  that  each  flow  path  forms  a  twisted,  tortuous,  yet  independent
route from one end of the rock to the other. The tortuosity is defined as τ=(La/L)2. From consid-
erations of flow through tubes, the resulting equation is
2/ f τ = Φ/ f τΣ p

2 , ................................................... (14.5a)

k = Φrh

where the hydraulic radius, rh, is defined as the reciprocal of Σp, the ratio of pore surface area
to  pore  volume.  The  pore  surface  area  normalized  by  a  volume  is  often  called  the  specific

Note logarithmic scale for permeability.

surface  area.  The  form  of  Eq.  14.5a  depends  on  which  volume is  used  to  normalize the  pore
surface area. If specific surface area is instead expressed as Σr, the ratio of pore surface area to
rock volume, then Eq. 14.5a becomes

k = Φ3/ f τΣr

2.............................................................. (14.5b)

If specific surface area is defined as the ratio of pore surface area to grain volume, Σg, the

expression is

k = Φ3/ f τΣg2(1 − Φ)2...................................................... (14.5c)

Thus,  the  functional  dependence  of  k  on  Φ,  which  differs  among  Eqs.  14.5a,  14.5b,  and

14.5c, depends on the definition of specific surface area.

Paterson23 and Walsh and Brace24 establish a relationship between electrical properties and
tortuosity,  determining  that  formation  factor  F=(La/L)2/Φ=τ/Φ.  They  note  that  this  expression
differs from earlier incorrect formulations. With it, tortuosity can be eliminated from Eq. 14.5a
to obtain

k = rh

2/ f F = 1/ f FΣ p

2 ..................................................... (14.5d)

Different  approaches  to  porous  media  theory  apply  the  concept  of  tortuosity  in  different
ways.25 For purposes of this chapter, tortuosity is represented by electrical formation factor, as
in Eq. 14.5d, or by porosity raised to an exponent.

As  shown  in  the  following  sections,  many  models  that  relate  k  to  a  pore  dimension  r  are
derived,  either  in  spirit  or  in  rigor,  from  the  Kozeny-Carman  relationship,  which  recognizes
explicitly the dependence of k on r2.

14.4.2 Models Based On Grain Size.  Krumbein  and  Monk’s  Equation.  Using  experimental
procedures that were later adopted by Beard and Weyl,3 Krumbein and Monk26 measured per-
meability in sandpacks of constant 40% porosity for specified size and sorting ranges. Analysis
of their data, coupled with dimensional analysis of the definition of permeability, led to

Chapter 14—Single-Phase Permeability

I-703

k = 760dg

2exp( − 1.31σD), .................................................... (14.6)

where  k  is  given  in  darcies,  dg  is  the  geometric  mean  grain  diameter  (in  mm),  and  σD  is  the
standard deviation of grain diameter in phi units, where phi=-log2(d) and d is expressed in mil-
limeters.  Although  the  Krumbein  and  Monk  equation  is  based  on  sandpacks  of  40%  porosity
and does not include porosity as a parameter, Beard and Weyl showed that Eq. 14.6 fits their
own data fairly well even though porosity of the Beard and Weyl samples ranges from 23% to
43%.  In  fact,  because  of  difficulties  in  obtaining  homogeneous  sandpacks,  Beard  and  Weyl
chose  to  use  computed  k  values  from  Eq.  14.6  rather  than  their  measured  data  in  tabulating
values for fine and very fine samples with poor or very poor sorting. If Eq. 14.6 can predict k
for a varying Φ in unconsolidated sandpacks, then the exponential dependence on sorting must
be adequate to describe all the effects associated with porosity reduction. In other words, both
k and Φ reduction pictured in Fig. 14.2 are due primarily to a decline in degree of sorting.

The  laboratory  studies  of  Krumbein  and  Monk26  and  Beard  and  Weyl3  dealt  with  sieved
sands  from  a  common  source,  so  such  grain  properties  as  angularity,  sphericity,  and  surface
texture  did  not  vary  much.  Moreover,  sorting  was  purposely  controlled  to  be  log  normal.  In
situations where these ideal conditions are not met, other techniques must be invoked to predict
permeability in unconsolidated sands. A disproportionate amount of fines can drastically reduce
k in unconsolidated sands. Morrow et al.,27 using statistical techniques on data from Gulf Coast
sands, found that permeability correlated best with the logarithm of grain size times sorting if
the fines fraction, taken to be <44 μm, was accounted for.

Berg’s Model.  An  interesting  model  linking  petrological  variables—grain  size,  shape,  and
sorting—to permeability is that of Berg.28 Berg considers “rectilinear pores,” defined as those
pores  that  penetrate  the  solid  without  change  in  shape  or  direction,  in  various  packings  of
spheres.  Simple  expressions  for  k  are  derived  from  each  packing,  which  form  a  linear  trend
when log(k) is plotted against log(Φ). From these geometrical considerations comes an expres-
sion relating k to Φ raised to a power and to the square of the grain diameter,

k = 5.1 × 10−6Φ5.1d2e−1.385 p, .............................................. (14.7a)

where k is given in darcies, d (in mm) is the median grain diameter, Φ is porosity in percent,
and  p,  a  sorting  term,  is  explained  below.  If  permeability  is  expressed  in  millidarcies,  d  in
micrometers, and Φ as fractional porosity, this expression becomes

k = 80.8Φ5.1d2e−1.385 p...................................................... (14.7b)

To  account  for  a  range  of  grain  sizes,  Berg  considered  two  mixtures  of  spheres  and  as-
sumed that k will be controlled primarily by the smaller grains. This introduces a sorting term
p=P90-P10, called the percentile deviation, to account for the spread in grain size. The p term is
expressed in phi units, where phi=-log2d (in mm). For a sample with a median grain diameter
of 0.177 mm, a value of 1.0 for p implies that 10% of the grains are >0.25 mm and 10% are
<0.125 mm.

Berg’s expression (Eq. 14.7b) is illustrated in Fig. 14.17 for p=1 and varying d. Permeabili-
ty  increases  rapidly  with  increasing  porosity,  depending  on  Φ  to  the  fifth  power,  and  the
curves migrate downward and to the right with decreasing grain size. Nelson29 finds that Fig.
14.17 is remarkably concordant with several published data sets. Berg’s model appears to be a
usable means of estimating permeability in unconsolidated sands and in relatively clean consol-
idated quartzose rocks. This is true even though Berg did not expect his model to be applicable
for porosity values <30%.

I-704

with varying median grain size (d).

Van Baaren’s Model.  Proceeding along more empirical lines, Van Baaren30 obtains a result
nearly identical to that of Berg. Van Baaren begins with the Kozeny-Carman expression of Eq.
14.5b and makes a series of substitutions (see summary by Nelson29) that result in

k = 10dd

2Φ3.64 + mC−3.64, ................................................... (14.8a)

where dd (in μm) is the dominant grain size from petrological observation, m is the cementa-
tion  exponent,  and  C  is  a  sorting  index  that  ranges  from  0.7  for  very  well  sorted  to  1.0  for
poorly sorted sandstones. Consequently, Eq. 14.8a can be used to estimate k from petrological
observations on dominant grain diameter dd and degree of sorting, along with a porosity esti-
mate obtained from either core or logs.

Assuming that the dominant grain size dd is equivalent to Berg’s median grain diameter d,
then Eq. 14.8a is very similar in form to Eq. 14.7a. For example, a sorting parameter p=1 in
Berg’s Eq. 14.7b results in

k = 20.2d2Φ5.1, ........................................................... (14.7c)

Chapter 14—Single-Phase Permeability

I-705

where  k  is  given  in  millidarcies,  whereas  for  a  well-sorted  sandstone,  C=0.84  and  Eq.  14.8a
becomes

k = 18.8dd

2Φ3.64 + m......................................................... (14.8b)

Van Baaren’s Eq. 14.8b is so close to Berg’s Eq. 14.7c that a separate log(k)-Φ plot is not
warranted here. Van Baaren’s expression is probably easier to use because the parameters are
directly related to practical petrological variables. Both models display a porosity exponent >5,
and  both  are  compatible  with  the  data  of  Beard  and  Weyl  on  unconsolidated  sands  in  that  k
increases with the square of grain size.

14.4.3 Models With Mineralogical Factors.  Several models have been devised to accommo-
date the influence of mineralogical textures on k. The first two described below are based on
the  Kozeny-Carman  equation;  the  third  uses  a  network  topology  that  is  independent  of  the
Kozeny-Carman equation.

Herron31 uses Eq. 14.5c as a starting point for a model using mineralogical abundances in

place of specific surface area. He obtains

k = A f Φ3/ (1 − Φ)2 exp(ΣBiMi), ............................................. (14.9)

where Mi is the weight fraction of each mineral component in the solid rock and Bi is a con-
stant  for  each  mineral,  so  that  quartz  produces  high  k  and  clay  minerals  produce  low  k.
Mineral abundances are obtained by performing an element-to-mineral transform on data from
a  logging  tool  that  measures  chemical  elemental  concentrations  by  means  of  neutron-induced
gamma ray spectroscopy. The coefficient Af is a textural maturity indicator; it can be used to
reflect the amount of feldspar alteration to clay minerals. Nelson29 gives further details on the
model.

Panda  and  Lake32  extended  the  Kozeny-Carman  expression  to  include  the  effect  of  grain-
size  sorting.  They  assume  a  sandpack  of  spherical  grains  having  a  log-normal  distribution  of
grain  diameters  d,  characterized  by  mean  diameter,  standard  deviation,  and  skewness.  Their
expression is based on Eq. 14.5c, substituting Σg=6/D and incorporating an additional term in-
cluding standard deviation and skewness. With the additional term accounting for sorting, their
extended  model  agrees  well  with  Beard  and  Weyl’s  data  for  sandpacks  but  overpredicts  k  in
consolidated sandstones. To make the model applicable to consolidated sandstones, three types
of cement filling the pore space were considered33: pore-bridging, pore-lining, and pore-filling
cement. Their resulting equation for k includes the sum of surface areas contributed by each of
the  cement  geometries  and  a  tortuosity  factor  that  is  a  function  of  cement  type,  as  well  as
statistical terms describing the log-normal distribution of grain diameters d.

Bryant et al.34 and Cade et al.35 performed numerical modeling on a pack of (initially) equal-
ly sized spheres in a geometry based on a laboratory random pack. Permeability is computed
directly by considering flow across the faces of individual linked tetrahedra; thus, the method
is  independent  of  the  Kozeny-Carman  equation.  Their  method  simulates  a  quartz  system  in
which  all  surfaces  participate  in  compaction  and  cementation  processes,  causing  k  and  Φ  to
decrease  along  a  characteristic  curve  in  log(k)-Φ  space.  At  some  point  in  this  process,  clay
minerals  are  introduced  in  grain-rimming  or  pore-filling  geometries,  and  k  decreases  more
sharply  with  a  continuing  decrease  in  Φ.  The  resulting  computed  curve  in  log(k)-Φ  space
tracks the effects of progressive diagenesis of a single pack as burial progresses.

14.4.4 Models Based on Surface Area and Water Saturation.  Two ideas inherent in Eq. 14.5
are important for later developments: the dependence of k on a power of porosity and on the

I-706

parameter, after Granberry and Keelan.36

inverse square of surface area. Eq. 14.5 has been used as a starting point for predicting perme-
ability from well log data by assuming that residual water saturation is proportional to specific
surface area, Σ.

Granberry and Keelan’s Chart.  Granberry and Keelan36 published a set of curves relating
permeability,  porosity,  and  “critical  water”  saturation  (Sciw)  for  Gulf  Coast  Tertiary  sands  that
frequently are poorly consolidated. Their chart, originally presented with Sciw as a function of
permeability  with  porosity  as  a  parameter,  is  transposed  into  log(k)-Φ  coordinates  in  Fig.
14.18. The Sciw parameter is taken from the “knee” of a capillary pressure curve and is greater
than irreducible water saturation, Swi. It is said that if the water saturation in the formation is
less  than  this  critical  value,  the  well  will  produce  water  free.  Because  Sciw  is  taken  from  the
capillary pressure curve, it is a function of the size of interconnected pores. Fig. 14.18 cannot
be  used  to  estimate  permeability  from  porosity  and  water  saturation  as  determined  from  well
logs because it reflects only the critical water saturation. It was determined from reservoirs in
which oil viscosity was approximately twice that of water and requires adjustment for low- or
high-gravity oils.

Timur’s Model.  Timur22  used  a  database  of  155  sandstone  samples  from  three  oil  fields
(Fig. 14.19). The three sandstones exhibit varying degrees of sorting, consolidation, and ranges
of porosity. Timur measured irreducible water saturation (Swi) using a centrifuge and then held
k proportional to Swi

−2 in the general power-law relationship,

k = a Φb Swi

Fig. 14.19—Permeability/porosity data from three U.S. oil fields by Timur.22

Coefficients a and b were determined statistically. Timur’s statistical results show that the
exponent b can range between 3 and 5 and still give reasonable results. Results for b=4.4 pro-
duced a fit somewhat better than other values; it was obtained by taking the logarithm of both
sides of Eq. 14.6 and testing the correlation coefficient with respect to Φb/Swi
2. For b=4.4, the
value  of  a  is  0.136  if  Φ  and  Swi  are  in  percent  and  8,581  if  Φ  and  Swi  are  fractional  values.
There is no theoretical basis for the substitution of Swi for specific surface area Σ, so although
the form of Eq. 14.10 is similar to that of Eq. 14.5, it is strictly an empirical relationship. The
effectiveness of Eq. 14.10 as a predictor of permeability is shown in Fig. 14.20, and its form
on a log10(k)-Φ plot is shown in Fig. 14.21.

It is not easy to apply Eq. 14.10, which is based totally on core data, to an oil reservoir.37
The Swi core data used to establish Eq. 14.10 were obtained for a fixed value of capillary pres-
sure (Pc). In a reservoir, Pc varies with height, and because Swi varies with Pc, it is necessary to
assume a functional dependence of Swi on Pc. There are also some practical difficulties in estab-
lishing  the  coefficients  a  and  b  in  a  reservoir  in  which  the  oil/water  contact  cuts  across
lithologies  because  of  regional  dip  or  structure.  In  particular,  within  the  transition  zone,  only
part of the water is irreducible (Swi); the remainder is movable. Thus, a log-based estimate of
saturation immediately above the oil/water contact will overestimate Swi.

Dual-Water Model.  An algorithm discussed by Ahmed et al.38 is attributed to Coates. An
extension of Eq. 14.10 and Fig. 14.21, it assumes that permeability declines to zero as Swi in-
creases to fill the entire pore space:

k = 100Φe

2(1 − Swi)/ Swi

2................................................... (14.11)

A  further  refinement incorporates the  presence  of  clay minerals and  is  based  on  the  dual-
water  model.  It  requires  log-based  estimates  of  the  total  porosity  (Φt)  and  either  effective
porosity  (Φe)  or  bound  water  saturation  (Sbw).  Effective  porosity  is  defined  as  Φe=Φt(1-Sbw).
The fractional volume of bound water, Vbw=SbwΦt, is computed, and an estimate of a parameter
Vbi=SwiΦt called the (fractional) bulk volume irreducible water in clean wet rock must also be
provided. Then, computed as a function of depth is the total immovable water,

Vwt = Vbi(1 − Sbw) +Vbw, .................................................... (14.12)

and the permeability,

k = 100Φe

2(Φt −Vwt)/Vwt

2.................................................. (14.13)

The  algorithm  of  Eqs.  14.12  and  14.13  uses  a  pair  of  parameters,  Vbi  and  Vbw,  which  in
effect  sweep  out  a  broad  region  of  the  log(k)-Φ  crossplot  (Fig.  14.22).  For  the  solid  curves,
Vbw has been set to 0.0 as if the rock were entirely clay free. As irreducible water Vbi increas-
es, the curves shift downward and to the right, into the regime populated by fine-grained rock.
The  dashed  curve  is  drawn  for  Vbw  and  Vbi  each equal to  0.05,  thereby representing one  of  a

second family of curves for a fine-grained dirty sandstone. Note how Sbw increases with decreas-
ing Φ.

This  algorithm  produces  reasonable  results  in  sandstones  if  Vbi  is  chosen  judiciously.  One

difficulty is choosing a value for Vbi in coarse-grained and gravel-bearing sandstones.

“Tight”  Sandstones.    Predicting  permeability  becomes  much  more  difficult  in  formations
with  small  grain  size  and  an  abundance  of  clay  minerals.  Such  rocks  are  called  “tight  gas
sands” or “submillidarcy reservoirs” (see example in Fig. 14.1). Kukal and Simons39 show that
the  Timur  equation  produces  k  values  much  too  high  in  such  formations  and  establish  some
predictive equations that decrease the porosity by multiplying Φ by 1-Vcl, where Vcl is the clay
fraction.  They  show  that  the  water  saturation  term  Swi  is  not  so  important  in  these  high-clay
rocks. Although their predictive equation is a welcome improvement, the scatter shows the dif-
ficulty in dealing with such low-porosity systems.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.  Eq.  14.5a  indicates  that  other  measures  of  specific  surface
area could be correlated with permeability. A study by Sen et al.40 provides laboratory data on
100  sandstone  samples  on  exchange  cation  molarity  (Qv),  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)
longitudinal  decay  time  (t1),  and  pore-surface-area-to-pore-volume  ratio  (Σp)  from  the  gas  ad-
sorption method. Borgia et al.41 provide data on Σp and t1 on 32 samples. Both studies include
measurements of k, Φ, and formation factor (F) on their samples. Both sample suites are made

up of samples from different formations, so the log(k)-Φ plots exhibit scatter, as shown by Fig.
14.23.

Both groups of experimenters found that k correlated best with measures of specific surface
when  it  formed  a  product  with  Φm  or  Φ2.  For  example,  Sen  et  al.40  found  k  to  be  strongly
correlated  (R  around  0.9)  with  (Φm/Σp)2.08,  with  (Φmt1)2.15,  and  with  (Φm/Qv)2.11.  Two  of  these
correlations are shown as insets in Fig. 14.23. Borgia et al.41 did not incorporate m into their
regression equations but found k to be best correlated with (Φ4/Σp
2)0.76 and with (Φ4t12)0.72. As
an example of these statistical fits, the expression from Sen et al.,40

k = 0.794(Φmt1)2.15, ....................................................... (14.14)

where k is in millidarcies, t1 is in milliseconds, and Φ is fractional porosity, is plotted in Fig.
14.24. Because the porosity exponent is very close to that established by Timur (Eq. 14.9), the
curves in Fig. 14.24 are quite similar to those in Fig. 14.21.

Later work showed that the transverse decay time t2, which is a more practical parameter to
detect with a logging tool than t1, could also be used to estimate permeability (consult Refer-
ences 21, 42, and 43 for further details on NMR):

k = cΦ4t2gm2, ............................................................ (14.15)

where k is in millidarcies, t2gm is the geometric mean of t2 in milliseconds, and c=4.5 in sand-
stones and 0.1 in carbonates.43 The value of k obtained from Eq. 14.15 is referred to as kSDR.
Better results are obtained if a cutoff can be selected for t2L so that only the pores contributing
to permeability are included. Kenyon43 notes that the NMR measurement is inherently respon-
sive  to  pore  size,  whereas  permeability  depends  on  pore  throat  size.  He  suggests  that  the
experimentally  determined  Φ4  dependence  somehow  accounts  for  the  way  in  which  the  ratio
(pore throat size to pore size) varies with porosity.

The Coates equation for estimating permeability is

k = cΦ4(V ffi /Vbvi)2, ....................................................... (14.16)

where k is in millidarcies, Vbvi is the bulk volume irreducible fluid fraction, Vffi is the free fluid
fraction  and  is  equal  to  Φ-Vbvi,  and  porosity  Φ  is  taken  from  the  NMR  tool.42,44  Eq.  14.16
closely  resembles  Eq.  14.11,  which  is  written  in  terms  of  irreducible  water  saturation;  Vbvi  is

computed from the portion of the t2 spectrum with the smallest times. Except for the porosity
term  Φ4,  there  is  little  obvious  resemblance  between  Eqs.  14.15  and  14.16.  However,  Sigal45
argues  that  a  t2  cutoff  time  is  implicit  in  Eq.  14.16  and  that  its  value  is  incorporated  in  the
constant c. Even so, the two equations are not equivalent because the two choices of t2 result
in different weightings of the pore size distribution spectrum. Sigal relates the two choices of
t2, one explicit in Eq. 14.15 and the other implicit in Eq. 14.16, for different distributions of t2
and for several experimental data sets.

As Sigal45 points out, the problem of selecting a value of t2 from NMR data is analogous
to the problem of selecting a value of R from capillary pressure data (which is reviewed in the
next section): One must capture the length scale appropriate to the estimation of permeability.

Summary.  Timur’s equation and its corresponding chart offer a viable method of permeabil-
ity estimation in which porosity and irreducible water saturation can be estimated. Difficulties
arise  if  there  is  uncertainty  in  Swi,  as  there  is  within  an  extensive  transition  zone.  The  dual-
water  predictor  is  an  interesting  embellishment  that  can  include  a  clay  content  parameter.
Laboratory  data  show  that,  when  combined  with  Φm,  specific  surface  area,  cation  exchange
molarity, and NMR decay time all correlate well with k. Because it responds to the pore size
spectrum, NMR is a particularly effective tool in obtaining log-based estimates of permeability.

nation of characteristic pore dimension.

14.4.5 Models Based on Pore Dimension.  Capillary Pressure and Pore Size.  Of  course,  the
dimension of interconnected pores plays a major role in determining permeability (Eq. 14.5a).
Thus,  all  the  methods  of  estimating  permeability  discussed  so  far  are  indirect  methods.  A  vi-
able direct method requires both adequate theoretical underpinnings relating pore throat dimen-
sion to permeability and experimental determination of the critical pore dimension parameters.
Many workers have made use of the capillary pressure curve, obtained experimentally by inject-
ing  mercury  into  a  dried  sample.  As  mercury  pressure  is  increased,  more  mercury  is  forced
into  progressively  smaller  pores  in  the  rock,  and  the  resident  pore  fluid  (air)  is  expelled.  A
length r, usually referred to as the pore throat radius, is related to the injection pressure by the
Washburn equation,

Pc = 2σcosθ/ r, ........................................................... (14.17)

where σ is the interfacial tension and θ is the wetting angle. The injection process can be visu-
alized  by  examining  the  idealized  capillary  pressure  curve  of  Fig.  14.25.  A  finite  pressure  is
required to inject mercury into a 100% water-saturated sample (right side of Fig. 14.25). At the
first inflection point (entry pressure), mercury occupies only a small fraction of the pore vol-
ume  containing  the  largest  pores.  Next,  much  of  the  pore  space  becomes  filled  with  mercury
with a comparatively slight increase in pressure (progressing from the circle labeled Katz and
Thompson  to  the  circle  labeled  Swanson  in  Fig.  14.25).  Finally,  large  pressure  increases  are
required to force more mercury into the smallest pores (steep curve to left of Swanson circle).
Many  authors  have  linked  capillary  pressure  curves  to  permeability.  Purcell46  derived  an
expression  relating  k  to  an  integral  of  Pc
-2  over  the  entire  saturation  span,  achieving  a  good
match  with  core  data.  The  relationships  established  by  Timur22  and  Granberry  and  Keelan,36
discussed  previously,  are  represented  at  low  water  saturation  in  Fig.  14.25.  Contributions  by

Swanson,18 Winland,47 and Katz and Thompson,48 symbolized by the circles in Fig. 14.25, are
reviewed next.

Swanson’s Equation.  Swanson18 provides a method of determining air and brine permeabil-
ities from a single point on the capillary pressure curve. His regression relationships are based
on permeability and capillary pressure data on 203 sandstone samples from 41 formations and
116 carbonates from 33 formations. His method picks the maximum ratio of mercury saturation
to pressure, (Sb/Pc)max, from the capillary pressure curve, arguing that at this point all the con-
nected  space  is  filled  with  mercury  and  “this  capillary  pressure  corresponds  to  pore  sizes
effectively  interconnecting  the  total  major  pore  system  and,  thus,  those  that  dominate  fluid
flow.” From linear regression, Swanson obtains simple equations of the form,

k = a(Sb/ Pc)max

c

, ........................................................ (14.18)

where the constants a and c depend on rock type (carbonate vs. sandstone) and fluid type (air
or brine). For carbonates and sandstones combined, c=2.005. Because Sb is defined as the mer-
cury  saturation  as  percent  of  bulk  volume,  it  must  be  proportional  to  Φ(1-Sw);  through  Eq.
14.17, Pc can be linked with a pore throat radius rapex. Thus, Swanson’s result shows that k is
proportional  to  [Φ(1-Swi)rapex]2,  again  demonstrating  the  dependence  of  k  on  the  square  of  a
pore throat size.

Winland’s  Equation  and  Pittman’s  Results.    An  empirical  equation  relating  permeability,
porosity, and a capillary pressure parameter is referred to as Winland’s equation.47,49 Based on
laboratory measurements on 312 samples, Winland’s regression equation is

logr35 = 0.732 + 0.588logk − 0.8641logΦ, ...................................... (14.19)

where r35 is the pore throat radius at 35% mercury saturation, k is air permeability, and Φ is
porosity  in  percent.  A  log(k)-Φ  plot  based  on  Eq.  14.19  and  showing  five  characteristic  lines
for pore throat radius is shown in Fig. 14.26. Note that at a given porosity, permeability increas-
es roughly as the square of the pore throat radius. And for a given throat size, the dependence
of permeability on porosity is slightly less than Φ2. Kolodzie47 states that a pore throat size of
0.5  μm  was  used  as  a  cutoff  for  reserves  determinations,  in  preference  to  the  use  of  k  or  Φ.
Hartmann  and  Coalson50  also  present  Winland’s  equation  in  the  same  format  as  Fig.  14.26.
They state that r35 is a function of both entry size and pore throat sorting and is a good mea-
sure of the largest connected pore throats in a rock with intergranular porosity.

Martin et al.51 used the r35 parameter, along with other petrophysical, geological, and engi-
neering  data,  to  identify  flow  units  in  five  carbonate  reservoirs.  With  Eq.  14.19,  r35  can  be
computed  from  permeability  and  porosity  measurements  on  core  samples.  Flow  units  are
grouped  by  the  size  of  pore  throats  using  the  designations  of  megaport,  macroport,  mesoport,
and microport shown in Fig. 14.26. A completion analysis for the different r35 size ranges in a
reservoir of medium thickness and medium gravity oil yielded the following: megaport, tens of
thousands of barrels of oil per day; macroport, thousands; mesoport, hundreds; and microport,
nonreservoir.  After  flow  units  are  identified,  well  logs  and  sequence  stratigraphy  are  used  to
identify zones with similar properties where no core data exist. The method works well in car-
bonates  where  flow  is  controlled  by  intergranular,  intercrystalline,  or  interparticle  pore  space
but not so well if fractures or vugs are present.

Pittman49  sheds  additional  light  on  Winland’s  equation,  linking  it  to  Swanson’s  results.
Pittman used a set of 202 sandstone samples from 14 formations on which k, Φ, and mercury
injection data had been obtained. Using Eq. 14.17, he associated a pore size rapex with the cap-

Chapter 14—Single-Phase Permeability

ranges of r35 are taken from Martin et al.51

illary pressure, Pc, determined by Swanson’s method and found that the mean value of rapex has
a  mercury  saturation  of  36%.  That  is,  on  a  statistical  basis,  the  points  denoted  by  circles  la-
beled  Swanson  and  Winland  in  Fig.  14.25  are  practically  identical,  and  the  two  methods  are
sampling the same fraction of the pore space.

Pittman49 also established regression equations for pore aperture sizes ranging from 10% to
75% mercury saturation. His expressions have been rearranged and displayed in Table 14.1 to
show  the  exponents  of  r  and  Φ  required  to  predict  k.  (Because  r  was  used  as  the  dependent
variable  in  Pittman’s  regressions,  the  coefficients  in  Table  14.1  differ  somewhat  from  what
would be obtained if k were the dependent variable; however the changes would not invalidate
the point of this discussion.) Note that the r exponent decreases with increasing mercury satura-
tion, while the Φ exponent increases. That is, the porosity term contributes relatively less to k
than does r for mercury saturation values <35%. In fact, Pittman noted that the porosity term
was statistically insignificant for r10 through r35.

Katz and Thompson’s Equation.  Another  investigation  on  the  influence  of  pore  structure
on flow properties comes from Katz and Thompson48 and Thompson et al.52 They use percola-
tion theory to derive a deceptively simple relationship,

k = (1/ 226)lc

2σ/ σo, ...................................................... (14.20a)

I-716

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

2), σ is electrical conductivity of the rock, and
where k is absolute permeability (same units as lc
σois the conductivity of the saturant. The value of the constant, given as 1/226, is dependent
on  the  geometry  assumed  for  the  pore  space.  They  substantiate  Eq.  14.20a  with  experimental
data on 60 sandstone and carbonate samples with permeabilities ranging from <1 md to 5 darcies.
The parameter lc in Eq. 14.20a represents a dimension of a very particular subset of pores:
“The arguments suggest that permeability can be estimated by assuming that the effective pore
size is the smallest pore on the connected path of pores containing the largest pores. We call
that effective pore size lc.” To obtain lc, the pressure at the inflection point on a capillary pres-
sure  curve  is  converted  to  a  diameter.  The  authors  argue  that  the  inflection  point  marks  the
pressure  at  which  a  sample  is  first  filled  continuously  end  to  end  with  mercury  and  that  the
large pores first filled are those that control permeability.

The Katz and Thompson48 equation and its characteristic curves are given in Fig. 14.27. To
plot curves on log(k)-Φ plots, we assumed the simplest relation between formation factor and
porosity (cementation exponent of 2.0), σ/σo=Φ2. Some data points from Katz and Thompson’s
experiments are posted in Fig. 14.27 to indicate how well their measured lc match the curves
(This is not really a test of their model because they used formation factor in their correlations,
not Φ2). Their result is similar to that of Swanson’s and Winland’s equations: Permeability is
closely proportional to the square of rΦ.

To obtain compatibility with other worker’s expressions, we define a critical radius rc=lc/2,

keeping both permeability and rc

2 in units of μm2:
k = (4/ 226)rc

2σ/ σo........................................................ (14.20b)

Eq.  14.20b  is  identical  in  form  to  Eq.  14.5d,  but  the  percolation  concepts  used  to  derive
Eq. 14.20b are quite different from the geometrical arguments used to derive the Kozeny-Car-
man expression. The coefficient in Eq. 14.5d, which is ≈0.4, is considerably greater than that
(0.0177) in Eq. 14.20b. Consequently, the characteristic radius rc is ≈4.7 times greater than the
hydraulic radius, rh. Although rh is defined as the ratio of pore volume to pore surface area, it
can be determined in a variety of ways, including the use of mercury injection. Conceptually,
then,  the  Kozeny-Carman  equation  could  also  be  represented  by  an  extended  horizontal  line
across Fig. 14.25; i.e., as a method that samples a broad spectrum of pore sizes.

son.48 Values of rc posted next to data points are from mercury injection tests.

It  is  interesting  to  compare  the  Katz  and  Thompson  model  (Fig.  14.27)  with  Winland’s
empirical  equation  (Fig.  14.26).  The  shapes  of  the  curves  are  comparable;  i.e.,  the  models
agree  on  the  approximate  Φ2  dependence.  The  pore  radii  given  by  the  Winland  equation  are
smaller than comparable radii in the Katz and Thompson model. This is expected because the
Winland  equation  requires  a  saturation  of  35%,  a  criterion  of  greater  injection  pressure  than
that  of  Katz  and  Thompson.  What  is  noteworthy  is  the  general  agreement  between  the  two
models  regarding  the  form  of  the  log(k)-Φ  relationship.  They  demonstrate  that  in  the  models
invoking higher powers of Φ, which we have shown in previous graphs are not well grounded
physically, the higher powers of Φ are required to compensate for lack of knowledge regarding
the  critical  pore  dimension.  It  does  seem,  however,  that  the  empirical  data  that  often  show  a
“straight-line”  log(k)-Φ  relationship  contain  some  fundamental  information  regarding  how  the
critical pore dimension relates to porosity.

Flow Zone Indicator.  Amaefule  and  Altunbay53  rearranged  a  version  of  the  Kozeny-Car-

man equation (Eq. 14.5c) to obtain a parameter group named the flow zone indicator (I),

I = 1/ √( f τ)∑g = 0.0314√(k / Φ)

(1 − Φ) / Φ , ............................... (14.21)

where  the  factor  0.0314  allows  k  to  be  expressed  in  millidarcies.  As  can  be  seen  from  Eq.
14.21, I has the units of pore size, in micrometers, and can be computed from core measure-
ments  of  k  and  Φ,  even  though  it  is  defined  in  terms  of  f,  τ,  and  Σg,  which  are  not  easily
measured. The choice of Eq. 14.5c over other forms of the Kozeny-Carman equation that use

(I), in μm. Data from southeast Asia and algorithm taken from Amaefule and Altunbay.53

alternative definition of specific surface area (Eqs. 14.5a and 14.5b) seems a bit arbitrary and
results in the particular combination of porosity terms used in Eq. 14.21.

Amaefule  and  Altunbay53  use  I  to  define  zones  called  “hydraulic  flow  units”  on  a  doubly
logarithmic plot incorporating the terms in Eq. 14.21. For compatibility with other plots in this
chapter, a plot in log(k)-Φ coordinates is shown in Fig. 14.28. Each data point on a log(k)-Φ
plot has an I value that associates it with a nearby curve of constant I value. The difficult step
is  deciding  where  the  boundaries  between  adjacent  I  bands  should  be  positioned  and  how  to
compute a value of I from well logs in uncored wells. Options for doing so are described next.

14.5 Statistical Approaches and Reservoir Zonation
Having  considered  petrological  controls  on  permeability/porosity  patterns  in  Section  14.2  and
various petrophysical (grain size, surface area, and pore size) models in Section 14.4, we now
consider techniques for applying well logs and other data to the problem of predicting k or log
(k)  in  uncored  wells.  If  the  rock  formation  of  interest  has  a  fairly  uniform  grain  composition
and a common diagenetic history, then log(k)-Φ patterns are simple, straightforward statistical
prediction  techniques  can  be  used,  and  reservoir  zonation  is  not  required.  However,  if  a  field
encompasses several lithologies, perhaps with varying diagenetic imprints resulting from vary-

Chapter 14—Single-Phase Permeability

I-719

ing mineral composition and fluid flow histories, then the log(k)-Φ patterns are scattered, and
reservoir zonation is required before predictive techniques can be applied.

A widely used statistical approach is multiple linear regression.54,55 Linear regression tech-
niques are popular for establishing predictors of geological variables because the methods are
effective  at  predicting  mean  values,  are  fast  computationally,  are  available  in  statistical  soft-
ware packages, and provide a means of assessing errors.

14.5.1 Predictors With One or Two Input Variables.  When  a  straight-line  relationship  be-
tween log(k) and Φ exists, as it does in Figs. 14.5 and 14.6, the computation of a predictor for
log(k)  by  Eq.  14.3  is  straightforward  and  merits  little  discussion.  Curvature  in  the  log(k)-Φ
relationship  is  treated  by  adopting  a  polynomial  in  Φ.  Increased  accuracy  is  also  afforded  by
dividing the field by area or vertically and computing regression coefficients for each area. In
one area, curvature in the statistical predictor may be rather pronounced; in another, curvature
may be absent.

14.5.2 Predictors With Several Input Variables.  The  quality  of  the  predictor  can  often  be
enhanced by adding a variable such as gamma ray response or depth normalized to top of for-
mation. As variables are added to Eq. 14.3, families of curves are required to present graphical-
ly the effect of combinations of variables. When one or two parameters are varied, the curves
sweep out a large area on the log(k)-Φ plot. Predictive power can be increased by adding other
parameters. Predictive accuracy does not increase indefinitely as parameters are added but in-
stead usually reaches a limit after several (anywhere from two to six) parameters are included
in the regression (see Fig. 17 of Wendt et al.55 for an example).

14.5.3 Predictors  Using  Computed  Parameters.    Computed  logs  such  as  shale  volume  and
differences between porosities from different logs can be included as independent variables. In
this way, petrological information can also be incorporated into the predictive relationships. A
petrological parameter (cement or gravel) is first “predicted” from well logs using core observa-
tions  as  “ground  truth.”  The  predicted  petrological  parameters  can  then  be  included  in  a
relationship to estimate permeability.

As  the  complexity  of  the  log(k)-Φ  plot  increases  (i.e.,  as  the  data  deviate  from  a  linear
trend),  more  variables  must  be  incorporated  into  the  predictive  model  to  maintain  predictive
accuracy, although instability can result from having too many variables. The better the under-
standing  is  of  petrological  controls  on  permeability,  the  more  effective  the  predictor  and  its
application will be. Other complications with regression methods, including underestimation of
high-permeability zones and overestimation of low-permeability zones, are mentioned by vari-
ous authors.54–56 At some point, it becomes necessary to adopt a method of zoning the reservoir.
A database approach equivalent to an n-dimensional lookup table can also be used for pre-
dicting permeability within a field or common geology.56 In this approach, the user must first
select the logs or log-derived variables that offer sufficient discriminating power for permeabil-
ity.  One  must  also  choose  a  suitable  bin  size  for  each  variable  on  the  basis  of  its  resolution.
Then,  a  database  is  constructed  from  the  core  permeability  values  and  associated  log  values.
Each  n-dimensional  bin  or  volume  is  bounded  by  incremental  log  values  and  contains  mean
and standard deviation values of permeability plus the number of samples. In application, per-
meability  estimates  are  extracted  from  a  bin  addressed  by  the  log  values.  An  interpolation
scheme  is  used  to  extract  an  estimate  from  an  empty  bin.  Like  the  regression  method,  the
database approach can be used only when adequate core data are available to build the model,
and results generally cannot be transferred to other areas.

Fuzzy clustering techniques provide a means of determining the number of clusters (bins in
the  preceding  paragraph)  and  their  domains.57  The  term  “fuzzy”  indicates  that  a  given  input/
output pair can belong (partially) to more than one cluster. Finol and Jing57 applied the tech-

I-720

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

nique to a shaly sandstone reservoir in which permeability ranged from 0.05 to 2,500 md. Six
clusters were defined. In each cluster, permeability is determined by

log (ki) = ai0 + ai1Φ + ai2log(Qv),

i = 1, … , 6, ............................... (14.22)

where  Φ  is  porosity  and  Qv  is  the  cation  exchange  capacity  per  unit  pore  volume.  The  final
determination  of  log(k)  is  a  weighted  sum  of  the  six  log(ki),  with  weights  determined  by  the
degree  of  membership  of  Φ  and  log(Qv)  in  their  respective  clusters.  An  average  correlation
coefficient  of  0.95  was  obtained  on  test  sets.57  Implementation of  Eq.  14.22  in  uncored  wells
requires  that  Qv  be  determined  from  a  porosity  log  and  requires  an  estimate  of  grain  density
and shale fraction (Vsh).

Artificial neural networks are a third method of establishing a predictor specific to an area
of interest. A back-propagation neural network is optimized on a training set in which the de-
sired  output  (permeability  at  a  given  depth)  is  furnished  to  the  network,  along  with  a  set  of
inputs chosen by the user. Rogers et al.58 established a predictor for a Jurassic carbonate field
using only porosity and geographic coordinates as inputs. For each value of permeability to be
predicted, porosity values spanning the depth of the desired permeability value were provided
as inputs, rather than a single porosity value at a single depth. Permeability values predicted by
the neural network in test wells were generally closer to the core measurements than were the
values predicted by linear regression.

14.6 Discussion
The best petrophysical models show that pore throat size r is a prime control on k. Yet, r is
missing from example data sets (Figs. 14.5 through 14.11) and from the diagram summarizing
diagenetic processes (Fig. 14.2). With the models, it is possible to consider what the range of
pore  sizes  might  have  been  when  sediments  were  deposited  and  what  the  range  is  in  the
present  state  of  consolidation.  As  an  example,  consider  the  samples  in  Fig.  14.5  from  the
Hosston formation. The uppermost vertical bar in Fig. 14.3 shows the range of grain size report-
ed  for  the  Hosston  formation.  The  range  of  initial  pore  throat  sizes  (vertical  hachured  bar  in
Fig.  14.3)  was  computed  from  the  present-day  grain  size  using  data  from  Beard  and  Weyl3
(Fig. 14.4) to transform grain size to initial permeability, followed by application of the Katz-
Thompson  equation  (Eq.  14.20)  to  obtain  pore  throat  size  from  k  and  Φ.  Present-day  pore
throat sizes (lowermost solid bar in Fig. 14.3) were computed from present-day k and Φ with
the  Katz-Thompson48  equation  (Eq.  14.20).  From  this  exercise,  one  can  see  that  the  largest
pore throat size has diminished from 250 (initial) to 45 (present day) μm, that the smallest present-
day sizes are <2 μm, and that the range of pore throat size has broadened considerably on the
logarithmic phi scale.

Expressions  relating  permeability  k  to  porosity  Φ  are  summarized  in  Table  14.2.  There,
permeability is in millidarcies, and grain sizes (d) and pore sizes (r) are expressed in microme-
ters,  so  the  coefficients  may  differ  from  the  originating  equation  in  the  text.  From  these
representative equations, it can be seen that (1) the predictive equations are simple in form, (2)
k  is  related  to  a  power  of  Φ  (except  for  the  Krumbein  and  Monk26  equation),  and  (3)  k  is
related to the square of either a characteristic length or a measure of surface area.

We  have  seen  that  models  relying  on  estimates  of  surface  area,  whether  that  estimate
comes from irreducible water saturation, NMR, gas adsorption, or cation exchange data, require
porosity raised to a power of ≈4. How can surface-area models requiring a porosity power of 4
(Figs.  14.21  and  14.24)  be  reconciled  with  pore  dimension  models  requiring  a  power  of  2
(Figs.  14.26  and  14.27)?  The  answer  lies  in  the  pore-size  distribution.  Because  most  of  the
surface area is contributed by the smallest grains (pores), measures of surface area emphasize
the small end of the pore-size spectrum. Yet, the small pores contribute least to permeability.

Chapter 14—Single-Phase Permeability

I-721

The high (≈4) power of porosity serves to unweight the contribution of the small pores. In the
surface-area models, porosity serves a dual role, first as a measure of tortuosity and second as
a measure of the pore-size distribution function.

A  similar  question  arises  with  the  grain  size  models.  Both  models  by  Berg28  (Fig.  14.17)
and Van Baaren38 require a porosity power of ≈5, multiplied by the square of a dominant grain
size. Why is the porosity power so high? The probable reason is that the dominant grain size
becomes a progressively poorer measure of dominant pore size as the spread in grain size in-
creases  and  small  grains  (pores)  become  more  abundant.  Again,  porosity  serves  as  both  a
measure of tortuosity and a weighting factor to compensate for the presence of small pores at
lower  porosities.  Moreover,  the  retention  of  a  sorting  term  in  Eqs.  14.7a  and  14.8a  is  inade-
quate compensation for  small pores,  even  though  a  sorting  term is  all that is  needed in  sized
samples (Eq. 14.6).

Models incorporating an estimator of pore size (Eqs. 14.5d, 14.19, and 14.20 in Table 14.2)
include porosity raised to a power of m (≈2). Estimates of dominant or characteristic pore size
are  more  effective  at  predicting  k  than  estimates  of  grain  size  or  surface  area,  so  the  higher
exponent of porosity to compensate for the low end of the porosity spectrum is not required.
Given a measure of r and Φ, the more information that r contains regarding the large through-
going pores, the lower the dependence on Φ is. Indeed, the findings of Beard and Weyl,3 Swanson,
18 Pittman,49 and Katz and Thompson48 all show that Φ is not so important as a predictor of k
as long as the dominant r is well specified. Conversely, using Pittman’s findings of Table 14.1,
as r decreases below rapex, r becomes a progressively poorer estimator of the dominant r, and a
higher  exponent  of  Φ  is  required  to  compensate  for  the  inclusion  of  pore  throats  that  do  not
contribute to flow.

The preceding considerations hold for predicting k on individual samples from a wide range
of rock formations, whereas the first part of this chapter shows that Φ can be a good predictor
of  k  for  samples  from  a  given  rock  formation.  Why  is  this?  The  pore-size  models  produce
curves of constant pore size that transgress the steeper log(k)-Φ data trends. The cutting of the
log(k)-Φ  trends  by  the  curves  of  constant  pore  size  shows  that  porosity  reduction  is  always
accompanied  by  a  reduction  in  characteristic  pore  size.  As  rocks  from  a  common  source  are
compacted and undergo diagenesis, pore space is reduced, and permeable pathways are progres-

I-722

sively  blocked  in  a  systematic  way  that  maintains  a  consistent  relationship  between  Φ  and  r.
Samples  from  different  formations  that  have  undergone  different  diagenetic  processes  follow
different evolutionary paths in log(k)-Φ-r space and thus produce different trends on a log(k)-Φ
plot.

14.7 Practical Applications
The  problem  of  predicting  permeability  has  been  reviewed  by  compiling  data  and  predictive
algorithms  from  the  literature.  Which  approach  should  be  used  to  estimate  permeability  from
core  and  well  log  data?  As  a  practical  matter,  it  depends  on  what  data  are  available  from  a
given well or field:

1. In  cases  in  which  no  core  data  are  available,  one  can  proceed  by  analogy  using  data
developed  in  formations  with  geological  properties  similar  to  the  one  under  study.  Figs.  14.5
through 14.8 are examples of the types of analog data that one might use.

2. When porosity and grain size estimates are available, refer to Fig. 14.17. This chart ap-
pears to give good estimates for many consolidated rocks. Exceptions will exist, such as rocks
containing  illite  in  pore  space  and  low-permeability  formations  such  as  those  shown  in  Fig.
14.8.

3. In  situations  in  which  porosity  and  water  saturation  can  be  estimated,  permeability  can
be estimated from Timur’s22 relationship (Eq. 14.10 and Fig. 14.21). In clay-bearing rocks, the
dual-water relationship for permeability (Eqs. 14.12 and 14.13) is an interesting enhancement,
but the user is required to provide estimates of both interstitial and bound water.

4. When NMR logs are available, one can make use of the permeability transforms devel-

oped for such logs. Laboratory determination of a t2 cutoff is advised.

5. Permeability is controlled by a pore dimension of a selected subset of the pore popula-
tion and can be determined from capillary pressure by mercury injection (Figs. 14.26 and 14.27
and Eqs. 14.18 through 14.20). Mercury injection can be applied to determine the permeability
of small or fragmented samples.

6. In field developments in which core data are abundant and a relatively simple (linear) log
(k)-Φ  relation  is  the  result  of  a  fairly  uniform  lithology  and  uncomplicated  diagnetic  history,
then one can turn to regression methods to predict k from well log estimates of Φ.

7. In heterogeneous reservoirs, a high degree of scatter on a log(k)-Φ plot requires that the
reservoir be zoned before k can be estimated. One must choose a petrophysical parameter with
which to zone the reservoir rocks. Various practitioners have used r35, the flow zone indicator
(I), the square root of k/Φ, and even k itself (note that each of these four parameters has the
dimension of length or length squared). One must also choose a method of zoning or cluster-
ing;  among  the  candidates  are  linear  regression,  neural  networks,  data  binning,  and  fuzzy
clustering.  A  good  set  of  core  data  is  required  to  establish  the  zones  or  clusters.  After  the
method  is  tested,  then  well  logs  are  used  to  compute  a  value  of  the  zonation  parameter.  The
more geological information that can be incorporated into the zonation procedure, the better. In
fact,  the  breadth  of  petrophysical,  well  test,  and  geological  data  is  probably  more  important
than  the  particular  zonation  parameter  or  clustering  methodology  chosen.  Complex  reservoirs
require complex methods.

8. Fractured reservoirs are a special and difficult case. Fracture permeability cannot be mea-
sured  with  core  samples,  so  it  is  difficult  to  establish  ground  truth.  Methods  of  estimating
fracture  permeability  from  fracture  aperture  and  fracture  density  are  tenuous  because  aperture
varies throughout the fracture plane, some fractures are sealed with mineral deposits, and some
are  open.  Combinations  of  techniques  seem  to  work  well.  Examination  of  core  can  provide
orientation and number of fractures, facies descriptions, and mineralization on fracture surfaces.
Borehole images provide fracture number, orientation, and aperture. Flow (spinner) logs reveal
zones of fluid flow into the wellbore. Sonic waveform logs show fracture location, and if con-
ditions  permit,  permeability  estimates  can  be  extracted  from  Stoneley  waves.  Other  well  logs

Chapter 14—Single-Phase Permeability

I-723

provide porosity estimates. Well tests provide estimates of permeability over isolated intervals.
Analysis  of  the  state  of  stress  can  provide  insight  on  fracture  location  and  the  probability  of
being open or closed. Analysis of complementary data sets can provide insights that cannot be
obtained from isolated data sets.

In all cases, one must bear in mind that a permeability predictor will be unique to the field
or  formation  for  which  it  is  developed.  This  unfortunate  fact  is  a  result  of  the  multiple  path-
ways that can be followed during burial and diagenesis, as seen in Section 14.2.

Relative Permeability and Capillary Pressure
Richard L. Christiansen, Colorado School of Mines

15.1 Introduction
Reservoir engineers use relative permeability and capillary pressure relationships for estimating
the amount of oil and gas in a reservoir and for predicting the capacity for flow of oil, water,
and gas throughout the life of the reservoir. Relative permeabilities and capillary pressure are
complex functions of the structure and chemistry of the fluids and solids in a producing reser-
voir. As a result, they can vary from place to place in a reservoir. Most often, these relation-
ships  are  obtained  by  measurements,  but  network  models  are  emerging  as  viable  routes  for
estimating capillary pressure and relative permeability functions.

Before defining relative permeability and capillary pressure, let us briefly review the defini-
tion of permeability. Permeability represents the capacity for flow through porous material. It is
defined by Darcy’s law (without gravitational effects) as

q = − k A
μ

ΔP
L .............................................................. (15.1)

Darcy’s  law  relates  the  flow  rate  q  to  the  permeability  k,  cross-sectional  area  A,  viscosity  μ,
pressure  drop  ΔP,  and  length  L  of  the  material.  High  permeability  corresponds  to  increased
capacity for flow. The dimensions of permeability are length squared, often expressed as dar-
cies  (1  darcy  =  0.987×10–8  cm2),  millidarcies,  or  micrometers  squared.  Some  writers  use
“absolute permeability” or “intrinsic permeability” in place of permeability.

For multiple-phase flow, the following expressions define relative permeabilities, specifical-

where kro and krw are the relative permeabilities of oil and water, respectively. Relative perme-
abilities  are  dimensionless  functions  that  usually  range  between  0  and  1.  Eqs.  15.2  and  15.3
allow  for  differences  in  the  pressure  in  the  oil  and  water  phases.  The  difference  in  pressure
between the two phases is the capillary pressure:

Pcow = po − pw. ........................................................... (15.4)

Capillary  pressure  relationships  are  dimensional  functions  that  range  from  large  negative  to
large  positive  values.  (Capillary  pressure  is  often  defined  as  the  pressure  of  the  less-dense
phase minus the pressure of the more-dense phase.) Relative permeabilities and capillary pres-
sures are usually viewed as functions of the saturation of phases in the porous sample—so, for
oil/water flow in the absence of a gas phase, we have kro(Sw), krw(Sw), and Pc(Sw). Saturation is
the  fraction  of  pore  space  that  is  occupied  by  a  phase.  In  the  present  example  of  oil/water
flow, Sw+So =1.

In  some  discussions,  the  products  of  permeability  and  relative  permeability  (e.g.,  kkro  and
kkrw in Eqs. 15.2 and 15.3) are termed the effective permeabilities. Effective permeability of oil
at irreducible water saturation, or ko(Swi), is sometimes used to normalize relative permeabilities
in  place  of  absolute  permeability.  With  this  normalization,  kro(Swi)  equals  1.  It  is  possible  for
water  relative  permeability  to  exceed  1  when  ko(Swi)  is  the  normalizing  factor.  One  must  be
very careful when using data to note whether absolute permeability or an effective permeability
is used for normalizing.

The remainder of this chapter includes discussion of typical capillary pressure relationships
and capillary pressure models, typical relative permeability relationships and relative permeabil-
ity models, measurement of rock/fluid relationships, and trends in rock/fluid properties.1

15.2 Observations of Capillary Pressure Relationships
As defined in the Introduction, capillary pressure refers to the difference in pressure across the
interface between two phases. With Laplace’s equation, the capillary pressure Pcow between ad-
jacent oil and water phases can be related to the principal radii of curvature R1 and R2 of the
shared interface and the interfacial tension σow for the oil/water interface:

Pcow = po − pw = σow( 1

R1

+ 1

R2). ............................................. (15.5)

The  relationship  between  capillary  pressure  and  fluid  saturation  could  be  computed  in  princi-
ple, but this is rarely attempted except for very idealized models of porous media. Methods for
measuring the relationship are discussed later in this chapter.

Fig.  15.1  shows  a  sketch  of  a  typical  capillary  pressure  relationship  for  gas  invading  a
porous medium that is initially saturated with water; the gas/water capillary pressure is defined
as  Pcgw = pg − pw.  For  this  example,  water  is  the  wetting  phase,  and  gas  is  the  nonwetting
phase. As shown in Figs. 15.2 and 15.3, a wetting phase spreads out on the solid, and a non-
wetting  phase  does  not.  Wettability  of  a  solid  with  respect  to  two  phases  is  characterized  by
the contact angle. Popular terminology for saturation changes in porous media reflects wettabil-
ity: “drainage” refers to the decreasing saturation of a wetting phase, and “imbibition” refers to
the increasing wetting-phase saturation. Thus, the capillary pressure relationship in Fig. 15.1 is
for drainage—specifically primary drainage, meaning that the wetting phase (water) is decreas-
ing from an initial value of 100%.

Gas  does  not  penetrate  the  medium  in  Fig.  15.1  until  the  capillary  pressure  exceeds  the
threshold pressure Pct, which depends on the size and shape of the pores and the wettability of
the sample. As capillary pressure increases beyond this value, the saturation of the water contin-

Water is the wetting phase.

ues to decrease. It is generally believed that the gas cannot flow until its saturation is greater
than a critical level Sgc, which is often 5 to 15% of the total pore volume. If gas is not mobile
below Sgc, then the capillary pressure relationship between Sw = 1–Sgc and Sw = 1 in Fig. 15.1
is fictitious, as suggested by Muskat2—a detail largely ignored in later literature.

Below  Sw  =  1–Sgc,  the  capillary  pressure  increases  with  decreasing  water  saturation,  with
water saturation approaching an irreducible level Swi at very high capillary pressures. Morrow
and  Melrose3  argue  that  capillary  pressure  measurements  have  not  reached  equilibrium  if  the

capillary pressure trend asymptotically approaches an irreducible water saturation. As the water
saturation decreases during a measurement, the capacity for flow of water rapidly diminishes,
so the time needed for equilibration often increases beyond practical limitations. Hence, a dif-
ference  develops  between  the  measured  relationship  and  the  hypothetical  equilibrium  relation-
ship, as shown in Fig. 15.1.

After completing measurements of capillary pressure for primary drainage, the direction of
saturation change can be reversed, and another capillary pressure relationship can be measured—
it is usually called an imbibition relationship. Imbibition is often analogous to the waterflood-
ing process. The primary drainage and imbibition relationships generally differ significantly, as
shown in Fig. 15.4 for a gas/water system. This difference is called capillary pressure hysteresis
—the magnitude of capillary pressure depends on the saturation and the direction of saturation
change.  For  imbibition  of  a  strongly  wetting  phase,  the  capillary  pressure  generally  does  not
reach zero until the wetting-phase saturation is large, as shown in Fig. 15.4. For a less strongly
wetting phase, the capillary pressure reaches zero at a lower saturation, as shown in Fig. 15.5.
Capillary pressure behavior for secondary drainage is also shown in Figs. 15.4 and 15.5.

As  shown  in  Figs.  15.4  and  15.5,  the  wettability  of  the  porous  material  is  an  important
factor  in  the  shape  of  capillary  pressure  relationships.  Wettabilities  of  reservoir  systems  are
categorized by a variety of names. Some systems are strongly water-wet, while others are oil-
wet  or  neutrally  wet.  Spotty  (or  “dalmation”)  wettability  and  mixed  wettability  describe  sys-
tems with nonuniform wetting properties, in which portions of the solid surface are wet by one
phase,  and  other  portions  are  wet  by  the  other  phase.  Mixed  wettability,  as  proposed  by
Salathiel,4 describes a nonuniform wetting condition that developed through a process of con-
tact  of  oil  with  the  solid  surface.  Salathiel  hypothesized  that  the  initial  trapping  of  oil  in  a
reservoir is a primary drainage process, as water (the wetting phase) is displaced by nonwetting
oil.  Then,  those  portions  of  the  pore  structure  that  experience  intimate  contact  with  the  oil
phase become coated with hydrocarbon compounds and change to oil-wet.

The drainage and imbibition terminology for saturation changes breaks down when applied
to reservoirs with nonuniform wettability. Rather than using drainage and imbibition to refer to
the  decreasing  and  increasing  saturation  of  the  wetting  phase,  some  engineers  define  these
terms  to  mean  decreasing  and  increasing  water  saturation,  even  if  water  is  not  the  wetting
phase for all surfaces.

Treiber et al.5 reported a study of wettabilities of 55 oil reservoirs. Twenty-five of the reser-
voirs were carbonate, and the others were silicic (28 sandstone, 1 conglomerate, and 1 chert).
To characterize wettability, they used the following ranges for the oil/water/solid contact angle
as measured through the water phase:

0 to 75° = water-wet
75 to 105° = intermediate-wet
105 to 180° = oil-wet
Their wettability results are listed in Table 15.1. At the time of publication in 1972, it was
surprising to readers that two-thirds of the reservoirs were oil-wet. Previously, reservoirs were
believed to be mostly water-wet. Treiber et al.5 also observed that calcium sulfate is strongly
water-wet;  thus,  carbonate  reservoirs  with  some  calcium  sulfate  grains  may  have  microscopic
variations in wettability—dalmation wettability, as described previously.

15.2.1 Drainage and Imbibition for a Strongly Wet System.  An  example  of  capillary  pres-
sure  relationships  during  drainage  and  imbibition  for  an  unconsolidated  dolomite  powder  is
shown  in  Fig.  15.6.6  The  wetting  phase  is  water,  and  the  nonwetting  phase  is  decane.  The
imbibition curve remains above zero capillary pressure, similar to the typical form of Fig. 15.4.

15.2.2 Heterogeneity.  Most naturally occurring porous media are heterogeneous, having lami-
nations, fractures, vugs, and so forth. Such heterogeneities give rise to “bumps” in a capillary
pressure  relationship.  An  example  of  these  bumps  is  shown  in  Fig.  15.7,  as  estimated  with  a
simple model for a laminated material: the Brooks-Corey expression (Eq. 15.9 in the Capillary
Pressure Models section of this chapter) for gas/oil capillary pressure was applied to rock con-
sisting of alternate layers of two differing permeabilities. The permeabilities of the two layers
differ by a factor of 4, and the threshold pressures differ by a factor of 2 (per the inverse-square-
root  proportionality  to  permeability  that  is  suggested  by  Eq.  15.6  in  the  Capillary  Pressure

Models section). The threshold pressure for the higher-permeability layer is 1 psi. The residual
oil saturation is 0.20, and the exponent λ is 2 for both layers. All layers have the same thick-
ness.  Starting  at  100%  oil  saturation,  the  oil  first  drains  from  the  high-permeability  layers;
when the capillary pressure reaches the threshold pressure for the low-permeability layers, oil
drains  from  those  layers.  The  consequence  is  a  bump  in  the  capillary  pressure  relationship  at
oil  saturation  equal  to  approximately  0.70.  Heterogeneities  other  than  laminations  can  cause
bumps. Any porous material that is a composite of two types of pore structure should demon-
strate bumps. Similar bumps are often seen for actual rock, as demonstrated with the mercury
capillary pressure data in Fig. 15.8.

15.2.3 Wettability.    As  reported  by  Bethel  and  Calhoun,7  wettability  affects  the  position  of
capillary pressure curves, as shown in Fig. 15.9 for displacement of oil (starting at So = 100%)
by water from a glass-bead pack. The contact angles in the legend of Fig. 15.9 are as suggest-
ed  by  Bethel  and  Calhoun.  The  wettability  moves  from  strongly  water-wet  at  the  top  of  the
legend  to  strongly  oil-wet  at  the  bottom.  With  increasing  oil  wetness,  the  capillary  pressure
shifts  upward,  reflecting  the  increased  pressure  needed  to  push  water  into  the  pore  spaces  of

the specimen. Fig. 15.9 also shows a variation in the residual oil saturation Sor with increasing
wettability. When strongly water-wet, Sor is approximately 14%; when intermediate-wet, Sor ris-
es  to  approximately  35%;  and  when  strongly  oil-wet,  Sor  returns  to  approximately  15%.
Morrow8 reports numerous examples of Sor between 6 and 10% for strongly oil-wet and inter-
mediate oil-wet bead packs. For water-wet systems, the residual oil saturation is 14 to 16% for
an  unconsolidated  sand  with  fairly  uniform  grain  size,  according  to  Chatzis  et  al.9  These  au-
thors reported residual nonwetting saturations of 11% for clusters of smaller beads surrounded
by larger beads. For larger beads surrounded by smaller beads, the residual nonwetting satura-
tion rose to 36%.

Jerauld and Rathmell10 report the imbibition and secondary-drainage data of Fig. 15.10 for
a  rock  sample  (permeability  =  223  md,  porosity  =  0.257)  from  the  Prudhoe  Bay  field,  which
they identify as a mixed-wet reservoir. As is typical of mixed-wet samples, the water saturation
increases rapidly during imbibition for decreasing capillary pressure in the vicinity of zero. Sim-

ilarly,  water  saturation  decreases  rapidly  during  the  secondary-drainage  cycle  for  increasing
capillary pressure just above zero.

15.3 Capillary Pressure Models

15.3.1 Leverett  j-Function.    Leverett  and  coworkers,11  based  on  the  evaluation  of  gas/water
capillary  pressure  data  for  drainage  and  imbibition  in  unconsolidated  sands,  proposed  the  fol-
lowing definition:

Pcgw = σgw

Φ
k j(Sw). ....................................................... (15.6)
The function j(Sw), defined in Eq. 15.6, is known to many as the “Leverett j-function.” The j-
k
Φ  against Sw. The combination
function is obtained from experimental data by plotting 
k / Φ is often considered an estimate of the mean hydraulic radius of pore throats. However,
the  directional dependence of  permeability complicates this  interpretation: Which permeability
should be used? While permeabilities for just one direction are one answer, this choice is often
not available.

Pcgw
σgw

The  j-function  has  been  used  for  correlating  capillary  pressure  data  for  rocks  with  similar
pore types and wettability, but with different permeabilities.12 Applications include allotment of
oil reserves during unitization negotiations. However, one should be very careful when correlat-
ing data with Eq. 15.6 to use permeabilities that are measured in the same direction. Perhaps
some of the scatter typical of j-function correlations results from inconsistent directions of per-
meability measurement.

The  proportionalities  of  Eq.  15.6  summarize  an  intuitive  expectation  for  the  relationship
between capillary pressure, interfacial tension (IFT), and permeability that is widely used. Occa-
sionally, cos θ is included adjacent to σgw in the definition of the j-function, although Leverett
did  not  write  it  that  way.  While  the  contact  angle  should  affect  capillary  pressure,  the  cosine
function may not be the correct function to include in the definition of the j-function. Indeed,
the  dependence  of  capillary  pressure  on  the  contact  angle  could  be  quite  complex.  Neverthe-

Chapter 15—Relative Permeability and Capillary Pressure

less,  the  traditional  procedure  for  adjusting  capillary  pressures  for  wettability  uses  the  cosine
function:

Pc, Condition 1
Pc, Condition 2

=

(σ cos θ)Condition 1
(σ cos θ)Condition2

. ........................................... (15.7)

This procedure of Eq. 15.7 has been applied to the conversion of mercury capillary pressures
to  oil/water,  gas/oil,  and  gas/water  capillary  pressures.  The  results  are  mixed:  sometimes  it
works well, and sometimes it does not.

15.3.2 Thomeer  Model.    Thomeer13  proposed  a  model  of  the  following  form  for  describing
mercury-injection capillary pressure data:

Pc = Pcte

−G/ ln(SH g/ SH g∞), ................................................. (15.8)
in  which  SHg  is  the  saturation  of  mercury.  The  Thomeer  function  has  three  parameters:  the
threshold pressure Pct, the pore geometric factor G, and the mercury saturation at infinite capil-
lary pressure SHg∞. (Thomeer wrote Eq. 15.8 with bulk mercury saturation instead of mercury
saturation. Bulk mercury saturation equals the product of porosity and mercury saturation. Bulk
mercury saturation is appropriate for irregularly shaped samples as collected from drilling cut-
tings.) Thomeer related absolute permeability to the three parameters of Eq. 15.8.

15.3.3 Brooks and Corey.  Brooks and Corey,14 extending the earlier work of Corey,15 suggest-
ed the following relationship for capillary pressure during primary drainage of oil from an oil-
saturated porous medium during gas invasion:

Pcgo = Pct( 1 − Sor

So − Sor)1 / λ

. .................................................... (15.9)

Sor is the residual oil saturation that remains trapped in the pore at high capillary pressure. Pct,
the  threshold  pressure,  corresponds  approximately  to  the  pressure  at  which  the  gas  phase  is
sufficiently connected to allow flow. Brooks and Corey related the parameter λ to the distribu-
tion of pore sizes. For narrow distributions, λ is greater than 2; for wide distributions, λ is less
than  2.  Eq.  15.9  should  be  representative  of  any  primary-drainage  process  as  long  as  the
porous medium is homogeneous and strongly wetted by the drainage phase; that is, the contact
angle measured through the wetting phase must be small.

Brooks and Corey provide no suggestions for estimating the residual oil saturation and the
threshold  pressure  in  Eq.  15.9.  Typical  values  of  residual  oil  saturation  vary  from  8  to  40%.
Thomas et al.16 suggested the following expression for roughly estimating gas/water threshold
pressures of low-permeability (less than 1 md), water-saturated sandstones and limestones:

Pcgwt = 7.37 k −0.43........................................................ (15.10)

(0.43 is near to the 0.5 in the Leverett function). For this expression, the appropriate units are
millidarcies for permeability k and psi for threshold pressure Pcgwt. Eq. 15.10 should be applica-
ble to fluid pairs other than gas and water if it is adjusted for IFT differences.

Fig. 15.11—Typical relative permeability behavior for a gas/oil system.

15.3.4 Bentsen and Anli.  Bentsen and Anli17 proposed the following expression for capillary
pressure for a primary-drainage process in which a porous sample initially saturated with water
is invaded by an oil phase:

Pcow = Pct − Pcs ln( Sw − Swi

1 − Swi ). .............................................. (15.11)

Pcs is a parameter with pressure units for controlling the shape of the capillary pressure func-
tion.  Bentsen  and  Anli  developed  Eq.  15.11  following  a  qualitative  argument.  These  authors
reported  a  range  of  parameters  for  several  rock/oil/water  systems,  but  they  did  not  suggest
means for estimating those parameters.

15.3.5 Alpak-Lake-Embid Model.  An  interesting  model  was  proposed  by  Alpak  et  al.18  for
representing both capillary pressure and relative permeability relationships. For capillary pres-
sure,  they  suggested  an  expression  that  can  be  obtained  by  applying  basic  thermodynamic
arguments to capillary pressure concepts. Their model relates capillary pressure to the change
of oil/water interfacial area and water/solid interfacial area with water saturation. Alpak et al.18
applied their model to drainage and imbibition data with fair success. Research in the years to
come may show whether this approach to interpreting capillary pressure is useful.

15.4 Observations of Relative Permeability Relationships
As  defined  in  the  Introduction  of  this  chapter,  relative  permeabilities  are  dimensionless  func-
tions of saturation with values generally ranging between 0 and 1. Figs. 15.11 and 15.12 show
typical behavior for a gas/oil system. The semilog scale of Fig. 15.12 is convenient for reading
the relative permeabilities less than 0.05. Although the curves are labeled “Gas” and “Oil” in
these figures, the phase identity of a curve can be deduced without the labels. For example, the
relative permeability that increases in the direction of increasing oil saturation must be the oil
relative permeability. The endpoints of the relative permeabilities in Figs. 15.11 and 15.12 are
defined by the critical gas saturation Sgc and the residual oil saturation Sor. Common names and
symbols for some saturation endpoints are listed in Table 15.2.

15.4.1 Hysteresis.  As is the case for capillary pressure, the relative permeabilities depend on
the direction of saturation change, as shown schematically in Fig. 15.13. For this gas/oil sys-
tem, hysteresis is much greater for the gas relative permeability. Usually, the hysteresis of the

wetting phase (oil, in this example) is very small. The trapped-gas saturation Sgt that remains at
the end of the imbibition process is a key feature of hysteresis.

Actual  observations  of  hysteresis  for  water/oil  systems  are  shown  in  Figs.  15.14  through
15.16. These three figures share some common characteristics. For example, one phase shows
large  hysteresis,  while  the  other  phase  shows  small  hysteresis.  Interestingly,  the  imbibition
tracks in Figs. 15.15 and 15.16 are above the secondary-drainage trends. Jones and Roszelle19
report large variations in krw and small variations in kro in what they consider to be a water-wet
sample.

15.4.2 Wettability.  Wettability affects the position of relative permeabilities, as shown in Fig.
15.17  (from  Owens  and  Archer22).  The  authors  measured  oil/water  relative  permeabilities  for
varying wettabilities with a Torpedo sandstone sample. Wettability was controlled by the con-
centration of additives in the oil and water. Advancing contact angles were measured on a flat
quartz surface.

Fig. 15.17 shows two important trends. With increasing wetting by the water, the intersec-
tion  of  the  oil  and  water  relative  permeabilities  shifts  to  the  right,  and  the  maximum  krw

decreases.  Similar  trends  were  documented  by  Morrow  et  al.23  and  by  McCaffery  and
Bennion.24 Reservoir engineers use these trends as indicators of wettability.

As  mentioned  previously,  Treiber  et  al.5  reported  wettabilities  for  55  oil-producing  reser-
voirs. A rock was deemed water-wet if krw at Sor is less than 15% of kro at Swi; intermediate-
wet if krw at Sor is between 15 and 50% of kro at Swi; and oil-wet if krw at Sor is greater than
50% of kro at Swi.

In addition to the shape of the relative permeability relationships, the authors used connate
water saturations, gas/oil and gas/water relative permeabilities, and contact-angle measurements
to supplement their judgment of wettability. The judgments of Treiber et al.5 relied heavily on
the results of Schneider and Owens25 and Owens and Archer.22 Treiber et al.5 emphasized that
interpretation of wettability from relative permeability behavior is subject to large error because
the  relative  permeabilities  depend  on  connate  water  saturations  and  pore-size  distribution  in
addition to wettability. Furthermore, the authors recognized that laminations and other hetero-
geneities can dramatically alter the relative permeability behavior and, hence, the interpretation
of wettability. To prevent such mistaken interpretations, the authors selected rock samples with
a high degree of homogeneity.

15.4.3 IFT.  Relative permeabilities change with decreasing IFT, especially when IFT falls be-
low 0.1 dyne/cm2. The sensitivity of relative permeability to decreasing IFT is of great interest
for  enhanced-oil-recovery  processes,  such  as  miscible-gas  processes  and  surfactant  processes,
and for the recovery of fluids from retrograde gas reservoirs.

The change in gas/oil relative permeabilities with decreasing gas/oil IFT as reported by Bar-
don  and  Longeron26  is  shown  in  Fig.  15.18.  At  very  low  IFT,  the  relative  permeabilities
approach an “X” shape, with endpoints close to oil saturations of 0 and 1, while at higher IFT,
the  relative  permeabilities  display  more  curvature  and  have  endpoints  more  distant  from  the
edges of the water-saturation scale. Significant changes in relative permeabilities are not usual-
ly  observed  until  the  IFT  falls  below  approximately  0.1  dyne/cm2.  Another  example  of  the
effect of IFT on relative permeabilities as reported by Haniff and Ali27 is shown in Fig. 15.19.
Asar  and  Handy28  also  reported  on  the  changes  in  relative  permeabilities  for  gas/condensate
systems as the gas/condensate IFT decreased from approximately 10 to 0.01 dyne/cm2. Amae-
fule and Handy29 reported relative permeabilities for low-IFT oil/water displacements.

15.4.4 Endpoint Saturation Relationships.  Residual  oil  saturation,  irreducible  water  satura-
tion, trapped-oil and -gas saturations, and critical gas and condensate saturations are the most
frequently  encountered  saturation  endpoints.  Residual  oil,  irreducible  water,  and  trapped-gas
and trapped-oil saturations all refer to the remaining saturation of those phases after extensive

and Archer22). Contact angles measured through the water phase are shown in degrees. For all measure-
ments, the water saturation was increasing, as it does in waterflooding.

displacement by other phases. Critical saturation, whether gas or condensate, refers to the mini-
mum saturation at which a phase becomes mobile.

The endpoint saturation of a phase for a specific displacement process depends on the struc-
ture  of  the  porous  material,  the  wettabilities  with  respect  to  the  various  phases,  the  previous
saturation history of the phases, and the extent of the displacement process (the number of pore
volumes  injected). The  endpoint saturation also  can  depend  on  IFTs  when  they  are  very  low,
and on the rate of displacement when it is very high.

Results reported by Chatzis et al.9 give general insight on the combined effects of wettabili-
ty  and  porous  structure  on  residual  saturations.  In  tests  with  an  unconsolidated  sand  of
nonuniform grain size, the wetting phase (oil) was displaced by a nonwetting phase (air) from
an initial saturation of 100% to a residual value. The authors observed residual wetting-phase
saturations Swr of 7 to 8%. They also found that heterogeneities in the porous medium can lead
to Swr greater or less than 7 to 8%, depending on the nature of the heterogeneities. Chatzis et
al.9  also  reported  residual  nonwetting-phase  (air)  saturations  Snwr  for  displacements  by  a  wet-
ting  phase  (oil).  They  reported  that  Snwr  is  approximately  14%  for  an  unconsolidated  sand  of

fairly uniform size. In tests on sandpacks of distributed grain size, Snwr rose to an average of
16%. Chatzis et al.9 also measured Snwr for glass-bead packs consisting of lightly consolidated
clusters  of  glass  beads  of  one  grain  size  distributed  in  unconsolidated  glass  beads  of  another
size. They reported that Snwr was 11% for clusters of smaller beads surrounded by larger beads.
For  larger  beads  surrounded  by  smaller  beads,  Snwr  rose  to  36%.  These  results  suggest  two
general  conclusions.  First,  the  residual  saturation  of  a  wetting  phase  is  less  than  the  residual
saturation  of  a  nonwetting  phase.  Second,  the  residual  saturation  of  a  nonwetting  phase  is
much more sensitive to heterogeneities in the porous structure.

General conclusions on the effects of wettability are useful, but the diverse array of wetting
alternatives suggests caution, especially in oil/water reservoir systems. This wide range of wet-
ting possibilities is an obstacle to interpreting or predicting the effect of wettability on endpoint
saturations. Indeed, conflicting results for different porous media are likely. For example, Jad-
hunandan and Morrow30 report that residual oil saturation displays a minimum value for mixed-
wet media as wettability shifts from water-wet to oil-wet—counter to the results of Bethel and
Calhoun,7 who reported a maximum for media of uniform wettability.

In the subsections below, specific relationships for endpoints of the oil, gas, and water phas-

es are discussed.

Critical Gas Saturation.  The critical gas saturation is that saturation at which gas first be-
comes mobile during a gasflood in a porous material that is initially saturated with oil and/or
water. If, for example, the critical gas saturation is 5%, then gas does not flow until its satura-
tion exceeds 5%. Values of Sgc range from zero to 20%.

Critical Condensate Saturation.  Interest  in  the  mobility  of  condensates  in  retrograde  gas
reservoirs developed in the 1990s, as it was observed that condensates could hamper gas pro-
duction  severely  in  some  reservoirs,  particularly  those  with  low  permeability.  The  trend  of
increasing critical condensate saturations with decreasing permeability, as summarized by Bar-
num et al.,31 is reproduced in Fig. 15.20.

Trapped, or Residual, Gas Saturation.  As shown in Fig. 15.21, the remaining gas satura-
tion after a waterflood depends on the gas saturation before the waterflood. The relationship of
Fig.  15.21  is  often  called  a  “trapping  relationship.”  The  amount  of  gas  that  is  trapped  in  gas
reservoirs is of considerable economic significance. For example, in a gas reservoir, encroach-
ment of the aquifer will lead to trapping of some portion of the gas.

Several  correlations  and  summaries  for  residual  gas  saturation  are  found  in  the  literature.
Katz and Lee32 provide a summary of residual gas saturations in a graphical form that is useful
for estimates. According to the model presented by Naar and Henderson33 for multiphase flow
through rock, the trapped or residual gas saturation is one-half of its initial saturation; this Naar-

Henderson  rule  is  the  simplest  correlation  for  residual  gas.  Agarwal34  correlated  a  large
collection of residual gas saturations for consolidated and unconsolidated sandstones, for uncon-
solidated  sands,  and  for  limestones.  The  ranges  of  parameters  in  the  correlations  are  summa-
rized in Table 15.3. The correlations may be erroneous outside of these ranges. Three of the
Agarwal correlations are listed below:

Consolidated Sandstone : Sgr = 0.8084 Sgi − 0.6387 Sgi

Unconsolidated Sandstone : Sgr = − 0.5126 Sgi + 2.61 ΦSgi − 0.2677 Φ + 0.148. ........ (15.13)

Limestone : Sgr = − 0.5348 Φ + 0.03356 log 10k + 0.1546 Sgi + 0.144. ............... (15.14)

In these expressions, residual gas saturation Sgr, initial gas saturation Sgi, and porosity Φ are

fractional quantities, not percents. Permeability k is in millidarcies.

Land36 suggested the following form for estimating trapped-gas saturation Sgr as a function

of initial gas saturation Sgi:

Land37 reported C = 1.27 for four Berea sandstone samples.

Residual Oil Relationships.  Residual oil saturations after waterflooding or gasflooding are
clearly significant for oil recovery. Here, the dependence of residual oil saturation on initial oil
saturation and capillary number for a waterflood will be considered.

The relationship between initial and residual oil saturation is termed the oil-trapping relation-
ship. For strongly water-wet rocks, the oil-trapping relationship should be identical to the gas-
trapping relationship. Indeed, because of this analogy and because it is easier to measure gas-
trapping relationships, few oil-trapping relationships have been measured. A set of oil-trapping
relationships reported by Pickell et al.38 are shown in Fig. 15.22. Oil-trapping relationships are
important for estimating reserves in transition zones. In conventional reservoir engineering, resid-
ual oil saturation refers to the remaining oil saturation after a displacement that starts near the
maximum initial oil saturation, which generally equals one minus the initial water saturation.

In the remainder of this section, the dependence of residual oil saturation on capillary num-
ber is discussed for processes starting with initial oil saturation at a maximum value: So = 1–
Swi.  This  topic  has  received  much  more  attention  in  the  literature  than  oil-trapping  functions.
The capillary number is the ratio of viscous forces to capillary forces. It is represented quantita-
tively with various expressions, as summarized by Lake.39 These expressions are derived from
the ratio of pressure drop in the water phase to the capillary pressure between the oil and wa-
ter phases. A popular definition of the capillary number is as follows:

Nc =

μwv
σow

, ............................................................... (15.17)

I-744

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Fig. 15.22—Oil-trapping relationships for samples of Dalton sandstone.38

with v representing the velocity of the water. The capillary number is small (less than 0.00001)
when  capillary  forces  dominate  the  flow  processes.  The  following  example  shows  just  how
small capillary numbers can be.

Example 15.1  Use  the  following  quantities  to  estimate  a  capillary  number  for  a  water-

flood with Eq. 15.17, where
μw = 1 cp = 0.01 g/cm/s
v = 1 ft/D = 30.48 cm/(24 × 3,600 s) = 0.00035 cm/s
σow = 30 dynes/cm
Therefore, the capillary number is as follows:

Nc =

(0.01 g / cm / s)(0.00035 cm / s)

(30 dynes / cm)

= 1.2 × 10−7.

Capillary forces do indeed dominate flow processes for waterfloods. Even in high-velocity re-
gions, such as the vicinity of a well that is producing oil and water, the capillary number will
remain very small.

Having  defined  the  capillary  number,  the  relationship  between  residual  oil  saturation  and
capillary number will be discussed next. As the capillary number for an oil-displacing process

increases,  residual  oil  saturation  decreases  in  the  manner  sketched  in  Fig.  15.23.  Above  the
“critical capillary number,” the rate of decrease of Sor is particularly rapid. The critical capil-
lary  number  is  10–5  to  10–4  for  porous  media  with  fairly  uniform  pore  sizes.  With  increasing
distribution  of  pore  sizes,  the  critical  capillary  number  decreases,  the  Sor  at  low  Nc  increases,
and the domain for decreasing Sor becomes broader. Extensive discussion of these relationships
is available elsewhere.40 King et al.41 suggested centrifuge methods for measuring these relation-
ships.  Pope  et  al.42  correlated  residual  phase  saturation  with  a  modified  form  of  the  capillary
number,  which  was  termed  the  “trapping  number.”  Adjusting  a  parameter  in  their  correlation
fits the effects of wetting on residual saturation.

Residual (Irreducible) Water Saturation.  Residual,  or  irreducible,  water  saturation  Swi  is
the lowest water saturation that can be achieved by a displacement process, and it varies with
the nature of the process—gas displacement or oil displacement. Also, Swi varies with the ex-
tent  of  the  displacement,  as  measured  by  pore  volumes  of  oil  or  gas  injected  or  by  time
allowed for drainage.

To be more specific, the results of Chatzis et al.9 (discussed in the introduction to this sec-
tion) can be extended to suggest irreducible water saturations of 7 to 9% for displacements in
unconsolidated sand and glass beads that are water-wet. Furthermore, Swi should increase slight-
ly  with  increasing breadth of  grain-size distribution. Significant variations in  Swi  should  occur
when small clusters of consolidated media of one grain size are surrounded by media of anoth-
er grain size. If the grains of the clusters are smaller than those of the surrounding media, Swi
increases; if the grains of the clusters are larger than those of the surrounding media, Swi decreases.
The saturation of water in an oil or gas reservoir at discovery is called the connate water
saturation, or Swc. The connate water saturation and the irreducible water saturation can differ.
If the reservoir processes that produced the connate water saturation can be replicated, then the
Swi for the replicated processes should be the same as Swc. Swc is significant for its connection
to initial oil or gas saturation in a reservoir. For an oil reservoir, So = 1–Swc; for a gas reser-
voir,  Sg  =  1–Swc.  The  connate  water  saturation  will  also  affect  initial  oil  or  gas  relative
permeability and, hence, the economic viability of a reservoir. Bulnes and Fitting44 concluded
that  low-permeability  limestone  reservoirs  are  more  viable  than  sandstone  reservoirs  of  the
same permeability because the connate water saturation is lower in the limestones than in the
sandstones; as a result, the relative permeabilities to oil are higher in the limestones than in the
sandstones.

I-746

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Salathiel4  observed  that  the  connate  water  saturations  in  carefully  retrieved  rock  samples
from some oil reservoirs are substantially lower than can be achieved when the rock is water-
flooded and then oilflooded. He attributed this effect to the mixed-wettability condition. When
the reservoir was first invaded by oil, the rock was water-wet, and low water saturations were
obtained.  However,  the  wettability  of  the  rock  surfaces  that  were  now  in  contact  with  oil
changed  from  water-wet  to  oil-wet  as  portions  of  the  hydrocarbons  adsorbed  onto  the  solid
surfaces. So, when such a rock is waterflooded and then oilflooded, the connate water satura-
tion is not obtained because the water in the oil-wet portions of the rock becomes trapped.

15.4.5 Temperature.  The  effects  of  temperature  on  relative  permeability  have  been  studied
primarily  for  applications  to  steamflooding  and  in-situ  combustion.  Mechanistically  speaking,
temperature can affect relative permeability by altering the IFT between flowing phases or by
altering the wettability of the porous material. IFT between water and oil should decrease with
increasing temperature, but to substantially influence relative permeability, the IFT would need
to  decrease  to  0.1  dyne/cm2  or  less,  according  to  the  discussions  in  previous  sections.  Such
reductions would be possible only at very high temperatures with light oils. Therefore, tempera-
ture-related  IFT  reductions  could  influence  relative  permeabilities  for  in-situ  combustion  pro-
cesses, but they would not be important for typical steamflooding.

The  influence  of  temperature  on  wettability  and,  hence,  on  relative  permeability  is  more
likely to be important for most applications. With increasing temperature, the wettability could
shift either to more water-wet or more oil-wet conditions, depending on the reservoir fluids and
the chemical composition of the porous medium.

Akin  et  al.45  reviewed  a  wide  variety  of  published  studies  of  relative  permeabilities  for
heavy oil and water at different temperatures. Some of the studies concluded that these relative
permeabilities were unaffected by temperature changes, while other studies concluded the oppo-
site. In the light of the previous paragraph, these contradictory observations in the literature are
not surprising. However, Akin et al.45 concluded that viscous instability—not wettability change
—is the cause of most reported changes in relative permeability with increasing temperature.*
With increasing temperature, the viscosity of the heavy oil decreases, and the water/oil displace-
ment process becomes more stable. The changing stability of the displacement (estimated with
the expression of Peters and Flock46) causes the apparent relative permeabilities to change with
temperature. Nevertheless, it is possible that relative permeabilities do change with temperature
for some systems. As Akin et al.45 conclude, further study of this subject is needed.

15.5 Relative Permeability Models

15.5.1 Brooks-Corey and Related Models.  In 1954, Corey15 combined predictions of a tube-
bundle model with his empirical expression for capillary pressure to obtain expressions for gas
and oil relative permeabilities. In 1964, Brooks and Corey47 extended Corey’s results using Eq.
15.9 for capillary pressure to obtain the following expressions for oil and gas relative permeabil-
ities:

kro =( So − Sor

1 − Sor ) 2 + 3λ

λ

...................................................... (15.18)

* Viscous  instability  results  from  displacement  of  a  viscous  (low-mobility)  phase  by  a  less-viscous  (high-mobility)  phase.  The  high-
mobility phase is prone to bypass or “finger” through the low-mobility phase. With “viscous fingering,” the displacement must be
2D or 3D rather than 1D. One-dimensional displacements are preferred for measurement of relative permeabilities.

Eqs.  15.18  and  15.19  apply  to  a  porous  material  that  is  initially  fully  saturated  with  oil  and
then invaded by gas. These equations do not allow for nonzero critical gas saturation. For λ=2,
Eqs. 15.18 and 15.19 reduce to the 1954 Corey expressions. Brooks and Corey related the pa-
rameter  λ  to  the  distribution  of  pore  sizes.  For  narrow  distributions,  λ  is  greater  than  2;  for
wide  distributions,  λ  is  less  than  2.  They  reported  that  λ=7.30  for  an  unconsolidated  pack  of
glass  beads  of  uniform  diameter.  For  sandpacks  with  broader  distributions  of  particle  sizes,  λ
ranged from 1.8 to 3.7. For a particularly homogeneous consolidated sandstone, they reported λ
=4.17.

The following “power-law” relationships are often used to describe oil, water, and gas rela-

tive permeabilities, respectively:

krw = krw, max(

Sw − Swc

Sg − Sgc

The exponents no, nw, and ng range from 1 to 6. The maximum relative permeabilities, kro,max,
krw,max,  and  krg,max,  are  between  0  and  1.  These  expressions  are  often  referred  to  as  modified
Brooks-Corey relations, reflecting their similarity to the Brooks-Corey expression for oil rela-
tive permeability.

15.5.2 A Model for Heterogeneous Rock.  In  1956,  Corey  and  Rathjens48  extended  Corey’s
earlier work to explain the effect of laminations on gas/oil relative permeability relations. They
considered  flow  parallel  and  flow  perpendicular  to  N  laminations.  For  flow  perpendicular  to
laminations,

In  these  expressions,  ki  is  the  permeability  of  each  layer;  kroi  and  krgi  are  oil  and  gas  relative
permeabilities  for  each  layer,  respectively;  fi  is  the  fraction  of  total  sample  volume  for  each
layer; kT is the total permeability of the laminated materials; and kroT and krgT are the resulting
total  relative  permeabilities  of  the  laminated  materials.  The  predictions  of  Eqs.  15.23  through
15.26 for N = 2 are shown in Fig. 15.24. The permeability of one region is one-fourth that of
the other region. The relative permeabilities are given by Eqs. 15.18 and 15.19 with λ = 2 and
with Sor = Sgc = 0.20. Corey and Rathjens48 noted two consequences of laminations: bumps in
the relative permeability relationships and a shifting of the critical gas saturation. As shown in
Fig. 15.24, the critical gas saturation shifts from 0.20 for the uniform sample to 0.10 for flow
parallel to strata, and to 0.33 for flow perpendicular to laminations. Also, the relative permeabil-
ity  for  flow  perpendicular  to  laminations  is  much  less  than  that  parallel  to  laminations.  As
shown in Fig. 15.25, measured relative permeabilities for a sample of Berea outcrop sandstone
with visually apparent laminations show the predicted trends. The Corey-Rathjens observations
were  used  by  Ehrlich49  to  explain  the  relative  permeability  behavior  of  vuggy  and  fractured
samples.

15.5.4 Correlations of Honarpour et al. and Ibrahim.  Other researchers have offered correla-
tions for laboratory measurements of relative permeabilities. Honarpour et al.52 suggest correla-
tions for two sets of rock samples—sandstones and conglomerates and limestones and dolomites
—with varying wettabilities. Ibrahim53 reported a more extensive set of correlations. Such cor-
relations  are  useful  for  understanding  general  trends  and  for  preliminary  estimates;  however,
they can be far from correct when applied to a specific formation.

15.5.5 Hysteresis Models.  The  effect  of  relative  permeability  hysteresis  on  reservoir  perfor-
mance  can  be  significant  for  processes  with  variable  directions  of  saturation  change.  For
example, during coning of water toward an oil-producing well, the water saturation is increas-
ing;  however,  if  the  production  rate  is  decreased  or  set  to  zero,  the  water  saturation  can
decrease. Hysteresis also can affect the performance of a waterflood if the relative production
rate of a well in a pattern of producers is changed. To facilitate simulation of these processes,
a number of models have been proposed for representing hysteresis effects on relative perme-
ability  and  capillary  pressure.  The  hysteresis  models  of  Killough54  and  Carlson55  are  used  in
some commercial simulation software. Fayers et al.51 proposed another model for incorporating
hysteresis  effects  in  reservoir  simulation.  These  models  extrapolate  and  interpolate  from  mea-
sured drainage and imbibition curves to generate “reasonable” estimates of relative permeabili-
ties.  Although  these  models  may  be  satisfactory  for  preliminary  estimates,  many  more
experimental data on hysteresis of relative permeability and capillary pressure are needed.

15.5.6 Carman-Kozeny Models.  Alpak et al.18 used concepts from a model for capillary pres-
sure to build a relative permeability model with the form of the Carman-Kozeny expression for
permeability.  (See  Alpak  et  al.18  for  references  to  other  related  models.)  The  Alpak  et  al.18
model relates relative permeabilities to the total surface area of the solid AT, the oil/water inter-
facial area Aow, the water/solid interfacial area Aws, and the oil/solid interfacial area Aos:

This relative permeability model includes tortuosity relationships, τw/τ and τo/τ, that do not arise
in the capillary pressure model of Alpak et al.18 This interesting difference suggests that rela-
tive permeabilities cannot be estimated from capillary pressure information alone. Alpak et al.18
suggested  relationships  for  the  tortuosity  and  the  area  functions.  They  used  the  model  to  fit
relative permeability data for unconsolidated and consolidated media. Future research will test
the merit of this approach to modeling relative permeability.

15.5.7 Network Models.  The advent of computers led to the development of models that rep-
resent  porous  structure  as  2D  and  3D  networks  of  flow  channels.  Analysis  of  these  network
models leads to capillary pressure and relative permeability relationships. The capacity of these
models to represent real behavior has increased with improved descriptions of the displacement
mechanisms.56

15.5.8 Models for Three-Phase Relative Permeabilities.   Many  reservoir  processes,  such  as
waterflooding below the bubblepoint pressure of the oil in place, involve simultaneous flow of
three phases. To model these processes, three-phase relative permeabilities are mandatory. Mea-
surements  of  three-phase  relative  permeabilities  are  much  rarer  than  those  for  two-phase
relative permeabilities, and there is more uncertainty in the reported three-phase data, as noted
by Baker57 in his 1988 review of three-phase correlations.

Current  efforts  in  three-phase  relative  permeability  studies  are  weighted  toward  identifica-
tion  of  models  for  extrapolating  two-phase  relative  permeability  data  to  three-phase  applica-
tions. Stone58 started this trend in 1970 with a model that is now known as the Stone I model.
In  this  model  for  water-wet  porous  media,  the  three-phase  water  relative  permeability  krw,wog
depends only on water saturation and is identical to krw,wo measured in water/oil displacements:

krw, wog(Sw) = krw, wo(Sw). .................................................. (15.33)

Similarly, the three-phase gas relative permeability krg,wog depends only on gas saturation and is
identical to krg,go measured in gas/oil displacements at irreducible water saturation.

kr g, wog(Sg) = kr g, go(Sg). ................................................... (15.34)

The equality of water and gas relative permeabilities in two- and three-phase flow, as described
by Eqs. 15.33 and 15.34, is supported by much of the three-phase data in the literature for water-
wet media. On the other hand, the three-phase oil relative permeability kro,wog depends nonlin-
early on water and gas saturations:*

* The factors that contain kro,wo (Swc) in Eqs. 15.35 and 15.41 reflect normalization of relative permeabilities with respect to absolute
permeability, as is the convention in this chapter. For a comparison of these normalized equations to data, see Ref. 59. Originally,
Stone normalized with respect to oil permeability at irreducible water saturation. The Stone versions of Eqs. 15.35  and 15.41  can
be recovered exactly by omitting the extra factors from Eqs. 15.35 and 15.41.

According to Stone, the minimum oil saturation Som should be in the range of ¼ Swc to ½ Swc,
and it should be less than or equal to the smaller of Sorw or Sorg, the residual oil saturations for
waterflooding and gasflooding, respectively. Fayers and Matthews59 proposed the following ex-
pression for Som:

Som = αSorw + (1 − α)Sor g, .................................................. (15.39)
with  α = 1 − Sg/(1 − Swc − Sor g).  Aleman,  as  reported  by  Baker,57  proposed  an  alternative  ex-
pression:

Som = Sorw(

Sw − Swc

1 − Sowc − Sorw)α

+ Sor g(

1 − Sowc − Sorw)β

Sg

. ......................... (15.40)

To account for hysteresis effects in three-phase flow, Stone recommended use of the appropri-
ate  two-phase  relative  permeabilities.  For  example,  in  a  water-wet  system,  if  oil  saturation  is
decreasing and gas and water saturations are increasing in the three-phase setting, then the fol-
lowing  two-phase  relative  permeabilities  should  be  used:  kro,wo  for  decreasing  oil  saturation;
krw,wo for increasing water saturation; and krg,go for increasing gas saturation.

In 1973, Stone60 proposed another model, which has become known as the Stone II model.
In  this  model,  the  three-phase  water  and  gas  relative  permeabilities  are  again  equal  to  those
measured in two-phase flow, as expressed by Eqs. 15.33 and 15.34, while the oil relative per-
meability is as follows:

kro, wog(Sw, Sg) = kro, wo(Swc){

kro, wo
kro, wo(Swc) + krw, wo

kro, og
kro, wo(Swc) + kr g, go

−(krw, wo + kr g, go)}. ....................................................... (15.41)

The water/oil and the gas/oil relative permeabilities in Eq. 15.41 are functions of water satura-
tion and gas saturation, respectively.

Baker57 compared four versions of the Stone models and various other models to available
data for three-phase relative permeabilities. He concluded that models based on linear interpola-
tion  from  the  two-phase  relative  permeabilities  perform  as  well  as  the  other  models.  As  an
example of linear interpolation models, Baker suggested the following saturation weighting of
two-phase relative permeabilities:

Blunt61  showed  how  to  extend  this  model  to  describe  relative  permeability  of  oil  at  very  low
saturations, often termed the “layer drainage” regime.

Another model for three-phase relative permeabilities and capillary pressures was proposed
recently by Fayers et al.51 The lasting value of this or any of the above-mentioned models, will
be known only when more data become available for comparisons.

15.6 Measurement of Rock/Fluid Relationships

15.6.1 Reliability of Measurements.  The reliability of measurements of relative permeabilities
and  capillary  pressures  is  an  important  issue  for  reservoir  engineering.  Although  there  are
many factors that influence reliability, the following three topics are emphasized here:

• Sampling of rocks for measurements.
• Measurement methods.
• Treatment of data from the measurements.
Proper sampling of rocks for measurements is most important for ensuring the reliability of
relative permeability and capillary pressure data. If samples are obtained improperly, costly and
reliable  methods  for  measuring  rock/fluid  properties  may  no  longer  be  necessary  or  suitable.
The goal of sampling should be to avoid or minimize mechanical and chemical damage to the
rock.  Mechanical  and  chemical  damage  can  occur  during  any  of  four  steps  in  the  sampling
process:  coring  and  core  retrieval,  shipping  and  storing,  cutting  samples  from  the  core,  and
cleaning and preparing the sample. With all of these opportunities, some damage is inevitable.
It should be obvious that reliable data require good measurement methods and correct treat-
ment  of  the  data  obtained.  But  defining  “good”  and  “correct”  requires  some  not-so-obvious
understanding—a  goal  of  this  discussion  is  to  touch  on  the  important  issues.  Measurement  of
relative permeability and capillary pressure relationships is complicated, particularly because of
the intertwining nature of these rock/fluid properties. Indeed, it is the deciphering of these com-
plications that largely defines what is meant by “good” and “correct.”62

15.6.2 Sample Handling and Preparation.  From cutting a core from a formation to final prepa-
rations  of  a  specimen  for  testing,  improper  practices  will  alter  the  porous  structure  and
wettability  of  rock  samples,  which  in  turn  will  alter  the  quality  of  measurements.  The  most
appropriate procedures depend on the ultimate objective of sample analysis. If the sample is to

Chapter 15—Relative Permeability and Capillary Pressure

I-753

be used only for porosity and permeability measurement, wettability alterations during handling
are not important. But for capillary pressure and relative permeability measurements with native-
state wetting conditions, one must work to avoid contamination of the sample. Next, a distilla-
tion of industry experience with handling and preparation of samples is presented.

Cutting a Core From a Formation.  Drilling fluids often contain oxygen, surfactants, poly-
mers,  clays,  and  other  particulates  in  oil-  or  water-based  slurries.  To  minimize  contamination
with  drilling  fluids,  cores  are  sometimes  cut  with  fresh  formation  oil,  synthetic  formation
brines,  or  drilling  fluids  formulated  to  minimize  invasion.  Sometimes,  the  extent  of  invasion
can be assessed later in the laboratory. Coring also can produce fractures in the rock, either by
the  mechanical  stress  of  the  drilling  process,  by  relief  of  the  in-situ  mechanical  and  thermal
stresses on the core as it travels to the surface, or by retrieval (often with a big hammer) from
the core barrel at the surface.

Shipping.  A variety of methods are used to ship core. Core has been shipped in containers
filled with oil or water from the producing formation, it has been shipped in sealed polymeric
bags with metallic barriers to oxygen permeation, and it has been shipped after wrapping with
a metallic foil and a wax-coated fabric. Some core has been frozen immediately with dry ice
or  liquid  nitrogen  upon  arrival  at  the  surface,  then  shipped  in  a  frozen  condition  to  prevent
oxidative and bacterial actions and to minimize evaporation of the water or oil.

Sample Collection.  Selection  of  the  locations  in  the  core  for  taking  samples  is  a  critical
step.  For  porosity  and  permeability  testing,  samples  are  usually  collected  at  regular  intervals
(e.g., every foot). Sometimes, the most homogeneous samples are selected. Such a bias likely
imposes  an  undesirable  bias  on  the  results.  Selecting  locations  for  sampling  should  follow  a
logical  or  a  statistical  thought  process.  For  example,  criteria  for  sample  selection  can  include
mineralogy, pore structure, homogeneity or heterogeneity, porosity, and permeability. Comput-
erized tomography (CT) scanning can help the selection of samples without internal pebbles or
fractures that might drastically affect the outcome of measurements. In general, the characteris-
tics of a collected sample should represent a significant portion of the reservoir. After locations
are  chosen,  collection  can  begin.  Collecting  a  rock  sample  from  the  core  generally  entails  a
cutting action with diamond-coated saws and boring tools. The coolant for these cutting process-
es is a source of contamination. To reduce contamination, liquid nitrogen is sometimes used as
a coolant, but most often kerosene or water is used—these coolants should be free of contami-
nants.  For  preserving  water  saturations  in  the  sample,  kerosene  is  a  common  choice  for
cooling.  Excessive  exposure  of  the  core  to  air  during  sample  collection  can  foster  a  shift  of
wettability from its native condition.

Sample Cleaning and Preparation.  After  collection  from  the  core,  rock  samples  are  thor-
oughly cleaned in preparation for porosity, permeability, and other measurements. Cleaning by
flushing the sample alternately with toluene, chloroform, acetone, and methanol (and mixtures
of these) is common and often satisfactory. To preserve delicate clay structures in some sam-
ples,  a  cleaning  process  with  miscible  fluids  and  supercritical  drying  is  sometimes  used.
Cleaning a sample with boiling solvent (such as toluene) in a reflux-extraction unit should be
avoided. During such cleaning, water vaporizes, and any surface coated with water can become
coated with high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons that are less soluble at elevated temperatures—
this can impart a nearly permanent change in wettability.

Final  Preparations  for  Testing.    After  suitable  cleaning,  the  samples  can  be  used  in  the
clean  condition  for  porosity,  absolute  permeability,  and  mercury  capillary  pressure  measure-
ments; alternatively, the condition of the samples can be returned to near reservoir condition by
processes of flooding with brine and oil from the formation and aging in formation oil. Such
restored-state samples can be suitable for capillary pressure and relative permeability measure-
ments  with  reservoir  fluids.  Common  practice  includes  centrifugation  of  brine-saturated  sam-
ples  in  air  to  reduce  the  brine  saturation  to  near  reservoir  levels.  Some  rock  samples  are  not

cleaned after collection from the core but are maintained instead in a preserved state by storing
them in uncontaminated oil from the reservoir. Such samples are flooded with formation oil in
preparation for measurements.

15.6.3 Measuring Capillary Pressure Relationships.  Most  methods  for  measuring  capillary
pressure  may  be  grouped  under  three  headings:  mercury  methods,  porous-plate  methods,  and
centrifuge  methods.  Each  of  these  is  discussed  below.  Vapor-pressure  and  gravity-equilibrium
methods also have been used, but they are not discussed here. The literature offers few exam-
ples of capillary pressure measurements with overburden stress matching that in the reservoir.
The magnitude of error caused by this omission will vary, of course, from reservoir to reser-
voir,  but  the  meaning  and  significance  of  capillary  pressure  data  without  the  appropriate
overburden stress are questionable. Some commercial laboratories offer capillary pressure mea-
surements with overburden stress.

Mercury Methods.  In the mercury method, a sample of rock is evacuated, and the volume
of mercury that enters the sample at increasing pressures is measured, as shown in Fig. 15.26.
Mercury  methods  are  especially  suited  for  samples  of  irregular  shape,  such  as  those  found  in
drill cuttings. Mercury methods are useful for investigating the porous structure of the sample.
Complete mercury capillary pressure curves can be determined within an hour or so, depending
on the permeability of the sample. To apply the proper overburden stress, a cylindrical sample
could  be  mounted  in  a  confining  sleeve  in  a  variation  of  the  apparatus  of  Fig.  15.26.  Some
commercial laboratories offer mercury measurements with overburden stress.

Use of the mercury method was first documented in the petroleum literature by Purcell in
1949.63 Purcell showed that mercury capillary pressure and air/water capillary pressure relation-
ships  could  be  correlated.  He  outlined  a  method  for  estimating  permeability  from  mercury
measurements.  Rose  and  Bruce64  proposed  a  relationship  between  a  rock’s  threshold  capillary
properties  and  its  permeability.  Thomeer13  proposed  a  correlation  for  estimating  permeability
from three parameters of the mercury capillary pressure curve, as mentioned previously. Swan-
son65  proposed  a  correlation  between  permeability  and  the  intersection  of  a  45°  line  with  the
mercury capillary pressure relationship plotted on a log-log scale.

Porous-Plate Methods.  The porous-plate method can yield very accurate capillary pressure
relationships. The following example describes the method. Consider a cylindrical rock sample
that is first saturated with water. A flat face of the sample is then pressed against a flat porous
plate (or membrane) in a chamber filled with gas, as shown in Fig. 15.27. The porous plate is

I-755

Fig. 15.27—The difference in pressure between the gas and the liquid (at ambient pressure) must not
exceed the threshold pressure of the porous plate.

also saturated with water. Often, a moist tissue is placed between the sample and the plate to
produce good capillary contact.

Then, pressure in the gas phase above the porous plate is increased by a small step, forcing
gas to displace the water from the sample through the plate. When the displacement ceases, the
difference in pressure between the gas surrounding the sample and the water on the lower side
of the plate is the capillary pressure corresponding to the saturation of water remaining in the
sample. After a measurement is completed, the pressure in the gas is increased again, forcing
more gas into the sample. This process is repeated, increasing the capillary pressure in a series
of steps, yielding the capillary pressure relationship for decreasing water saturation.

If the pressure in the gas is raised too far, the gas will penetrate through the porous plate,
terminating the test. The highest capillary pressure that can be achieved with the porous-plate
method  equals  the  threshold  pressure  of  the  plate—that  pressure  at  which  gas  can  penetrate
through the plate. The plate threshold pressure depends on the size of pores in the plates and
the interfacial properties of the two fluids separated by the plate. The process of gas injection
is  often  reversed  before  the  capillary  pressure  reaches  the  threshold  pressure  of  the  plate.  By
decreasing the pressure in the gas in small steps, the capillary pressure relationship for increas-
ing water saturation can be determined.

Porous-plate  methods  have  been  applied  to  gas/water  systems,  gas/oil  systems,  and  oil/
water  systems  using  porous  plates  with  suitable  wettability  to  prevent  penetration  through  the
plate  of  the  phase  surrounding  the  rock  sample.  Considerable  time  may  be  needed  to  reach
equilibrium with porous-plate methods—often a week or more at each displacement step for oil/
water systems. Christoffersen and Whitson66 provide an example of the porous-plate technology
with automated control of gas/oil displacements. To reduce equilibration time, their system fea-
tures a thin membrane in place of a porous plate. They could complete the measurements on a
5-md chalk sample in 14 days.

As  suggested  earlier,  capillary  pressure  relationships  should  be  measured  with  an  applied
overburden  stress  that  approximates  the  stress  in  the  reservoir.  The  apparatus  of  Fig.  15.27
does not provide specifically for overburden stress, but by confining a cylindrical sample in a
rubber (or similarly flexible) sleeve, one can apply approximately the needed stress. The down-
side  of  applying  stress  with  the  sleeve  is  that  much  of  the  surface  area  of  the  sample  is
blocked, which slows the pace of the test.

Centrifuge Methods.  Centrifuge  methods  are  increasingly  favored  for  measuring  capillary
pressures. Although not as quick as mercury measurements, centrifuge measurements are much

I-756

faster than porous-plate methods. To measure a gas/oil capillary pressure relationship with the
centrifuge method, a cylindrical sample is first saturated with oil; next, it is mounted in a cen-
trifuge,  as  shown  in  Fig.  15.28,  and  is  spun  in  steps  of  increasing  spin  rate.  The  centrifugal
forces throw oil from the sample while pulling surrounding gas into the sample. The duration
of each spin step must be sufficient for production of oil to cease.

The  average  saturation  of  oil  in  the  sample  at  each  spin  rate  may  be  calculated  from  the
volume  of  oil  that  is  produced  to  the  collector  relative  to  the  porous  volume  of  the  sample.
Because 4 to 24 hours are needed to reach equilibrium at each spin rate, most centrifuge data
sets consist of eight or fewer spin rates. Ruth and Chen67 recommend at least 15 spin rates for
accurate evaluation of capillary pressure.

The capillary pressure distribution Pc(r) at each spin-rate step depends on the gas/oil densi-
ty difference Δρ, the spin rate ω, and the dimensions of the sample relative to the axis of rotation:

Pc(r) = 1

2 Δρω2(ro

2 − r2). ................................................... (15.45)

Here,  ro  is  the  radius  from  the  axis  of  rotation  to  the  outside  face  of  the  sample  (see  Fig.
15.28), and r is the radial distance to any point in the sample. At each spin rate, the capillary
pressure at the inside face of the sample (at ri) is
2 Δρω2(ro

2). .................................................... (15.46)

Pci = 1

2 − ri

The process for converting a set of average saturations and Pci from centrifuge measurements
to capillary pressure relationships can involve differentiation of the centrifuge data, as first de-
scribed  by  Hassler  and  Brunner.68  This  differentiation  process  compounds  any  error  in  the
original  data.  So,  although  the  centrifuge  method  is  faster  than  the  porous-plate  method,  it  is
not as accurate.69

Many variations of the centrifuge method are found in the literature and in industry prac-
tice.  For  example,  to  measure  water/oil  capillary  pressure  for  increasing  water  saturation,  the
bucket in Fig. 15.28 is reversed so that the rock is on the outside, surrounded by water; the oil
that is displaced by the water segregates toward the axis of rotation. Means for applying over-
burden stress also have been included in centrifuge designs. Baldwin and Spinler70 and Spinler

et  al.71  used  magnetic  resonance  imaging  to  obtain  capillary  pressure  relationships  by  direct
measurement of fluid saturations in a rock sample taken from a centrifuge test.

15.6.4 Measurement  of  Relative  Permeabilities.    There  are  many  variations  in  methods  for
measuring relative permeabilities; only their general features will be discussed here. Usually, a
cylindrical porous sample is mounted in a holder similar to that shown in Fig. 15.29. The cylin-
drical surfaces of the sample are sealed to prevent flow. The seal is accomplished in Fig. 15.29
with  a  rubber  sleeve  that  also  allows  for  application  of  a  radial  confining  stress.  Fluids  are
injected  and  produced  from  the  sample  through  ports  at  each  end.  Often,  additional  ports  are
added for pressure measurement. In addition to the sample holder, other apparatus are needed
to  inject  and  collect  fluids,  measure  pressures,  apply  confining  pressure,  measure  saturations,
and so forth. Some of these external features are shown in Fig. 15.30. Phase saturations can be
estimated from the change in mass of the rock sample, the change of electrical conductivity, or
the  change  of  absorption  of  X-rays72  or  other  radiation.  Acoustic  methods73  and  CT
scanning74,75  are  also  used.  To  measure  the  change  in  mass,  the  rock  sample  is  quickly  re-
moved  from  the  assembly,  weighed,  then  returned  to  the  assembly.  Because  this  procedure
could cause the saturation to change, in-situ techniques such as electrical conductivity or X-ray
absorption  have  an  advantage.  Steady-state  and  unsteady-state  methods  for  measuring  relative
permeabilities are discussed further in the subsections below.

Steady-State Methods.  In steady-state methods, both phases (oil and water, gas and oil, or
gas and water) are injected simultaneously at constant rates. Injection continues until a steady
state is reached, as indicated by constant pressure drop and constant saturations. Four subcate-
gories of the steady-state methods are introduced below.

Multiple-Core  Method.    In  the  multiple-core  method,  frequently  called  the  Penn  State
method,  a  rock  sample  is  sandwiched  between  two  other  rock  samples  to  build  a  lengthened
sample.  The  upstream  and  downstream  rock  samples  distribute  flow  of  the  multiple  phases
over  the  cross  section  of  the  rock  and  reduce  the  influence  of  capillary  end  effects76  on  the
central rock sample. Pressure drop is measured across the central sample while two fluid phas-
es  are  pumped  through  the  sample  at  constant  flow  rates.  In  some  early  applications  of  this
method,  the  saturations  in  the  central  rock  sample  were  measured  by  quickly  removing  the
sample and measuring its mass.

I-758

Fig. 15.30—Sample holder with auxiliary apparatus for managing and monitoring the displacement.

High-Rate Method.  In the high-rate method, two fluid phases are injected into a rock sam-
ple  at  high  and  constant  flow  rate.  The  actual  magnitude  of  rate  that  is  required  for  this
method will depend on the length of the rock sample as well as its capillary pressure proper-
ties.  The  injection  rate  must  be  sufficient  so  that  capillary  end  effects  are  negligible.  Of  the
steady-state methods, the high-rate subcategory is used most frequently.

Stationary-Liquid Method.  In the stationary-liquid method, relative permeability of one high-
ly mobile phase is measured in the presence of an essentially immobile second phase. Typical-
ly, the immobile phase is a liquid phase, while the mobile phase is usually gas. Because of the
high mobility of gas, the liquid phase can be essentially immobile as long as the pressure gradi-
ent is small.

Uniform-Capillary-Pressure Method.  In the uniform-capillary-pressure method, often called
the Hassler77 method, the capillary pressure between two flowing phases is kept uniform through-
out a rock sample by keeping the pressure gradients in both phases equal. This is accomplished
by incorporating porous plates or membranes at the entrance and exit faces of the porous sam-
ple (not shown in Fig. 15.29). The membranes allow passage of just one of the injected fluids,
so the pressure drop in each flowing phase can be measured separately. Although the Hassler
method is rarely used, measurement methods with selective membranes are frequently encoun-
tered in the literature.

Unsteady-State Methods.  In  unsteady-state  methods,  just  one  phase  is  injected  at  either  a
constant flow rate or a constant pressure drop. Throughout the injection, the pressure drop and
production of phases are measured. Three subcategories are described next.

High-Rate Methods.  For measurements with high-rate unsteady-state methods, the injection
rate must be sufficient so that capillary spreading effects and capillary end effects can be elimi-
nated. The injection and production data and the differential pressure data must be differentiat-
ed  to  obtain  the  relative  permeabilities.  These  high-rate  methods  are  used  most  frequently  in
the  oil  and  gas  industry.  They  provide  results  for  the  least  cost  and  with  the  least  delay  in
time. The quality of the results has been questioned, but there is evidence in the literature that
the methods can give results equivalent to those obtained with other methods.

Chapter 15—Relative Permeability and Capillary Pressure

I-759

Low-Rate Methods.  The enormous increase in computing power and its availability in the
last  20  years  has  facilitated  measurement  of  relative  permeabilities  in  low-rate  unsteady-state
tests. These tests are preferred to high-rate tests for samples that have fines that become mobile
at high rates. The test equipment is identical to that used for high-rate methods, but numerical
models are used for interpreting the production and pressure-drop data. The low-rate methods
are not widely used.

Centrifuge Methods.  Relative  permeabilities  can  be  measured  in  centrifuge  tests  using  the
same apparatus as that described for measurements of capillary pressure (Fig. 15.28). Standard
practice provides for measurement of the relative permeability of the lowest-mobility phase. To
obtain  this  relative  permeability,  the  production  of  one  phase  as  a  function  of  drainage  time
must  be  measured.  Then,  differentiation  of  the  data  per  the  algorithm  devised  by  Hagoort78
gives the relative permeability.

15.6.5 Measurement  of  Endpoint  Saturations.    Endpoint  saturations  are  often  valued  more
highly than capillary pressures and relative permeabilities for several reasons. First, the residual
oil saturation for a waterflood defines the maximum amount of oil that can be recovered, so it
is very useful for economics calculations. Irreducible water saturation is very useful for assess-
ing the volume of oil in place in a reservoir. Furthermore, the endpoints can be measured more
accurately than capillary pressure and relative permeability relationships. As such, some discus-
sion of methods for measuring endpoint saturation is included here.

To  measure  residual  oil  saturations  after  a  waterflood  or  gasflood,  the  apparatus  of  Figs.
15.29 and 15.30 can be used, but pressure-drop data are not needed—just the oil saturation at
the  end  of  the  flood  is  required.  As  a  result,  residual  oil  saturations  are  much  less  costly  to
measure than relative permeabilities and capillary pressures. Still, care is needed to ensure prop-
er wetting conditions for the measurements.

In principle, irreducible water saturation should be measured by oilflooding a rock sample
that is initially saturated with water. (Of course, the wettability of the sample will influence the
results, so care in handling and preparing the sample is important.) However, irreducible water
saturations from such oilflooding are often greater than water saturations measured in retrieved
cores  from  reservoirs.  Therefore,  alternative  approaches  have  been  explored.  Satisfying  esti-
mates  of  Swi  have  been  obtained  from  mercury-injection  tests,  with  the  mercury  representing
the oil phase and the vapor phase in the test representing the displaced water phase.79

15.7 Trends and Cautions in Rock/Fluid Properties
At the conclusion of this discussion of capillary pressure and relative permeabilities, five impor-
tant trends and cautions are worth emphasizing. Some of them were discussed in this chapter;
others are offered as extrapolations from discussions of this chapter.

First, the need for accurate measurement of capillary pressure and relative permeability func-
tions increases with the resolution of reservoir models. With low-resolution models, there is a
need for algorithms to “upscale” permeabilities, relative permeabilities, and capillary pressures
from the scale of measurement on a small sample of rock to the relatively huge size of blocks
in reservoir models. The results of the averaging processes of upscaling are insensitive to the
quality of measurements on small samples. The need for upscaling should diminish as increas-
es in computer power permit higher-resolution models.

Second,  to  obtain  accurate  measurements  of  capillary  pressure  and  relative  permeabilities,
tests with representative samples at representative conditions are critical. Much of the available
data in our industry do not pass this standard.

Third,  capillary  end  effects  and  viscous  fingering  have  corrupted  a  significant  portion  of
relative permeability data. If capillary pressure and relative permeabilities are available, the ex-
tent of this corruption for a sample can be assessed and sometimes corrected.

I-760

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

Fourth,  we  often  interpret  water/oil  wettabilities  from  the  shape  of  relative  permeabilities.
Such interpretations are particularly susceptible to error caused by the heterogeneity of the sam-
ple  used  for  measurements.  This  susceptibility  was  conceded  in  the  original  literature  on
wettability interpretation, but it is not widely acknowledged.

Fifth, the quality of estimates of capillary pressure and relative permeability with network
models  is  increasing.  These  models  offer  the  hope  of  providing  estimates  for  a  large  set  of
rock samples for any particular reservoir while avoiding the costs of measuring capillary pres-
sure and relative permeability.

16.1 Introduction
Economics drives the entire oil/gas producing industry. Almost every decision is made on the
basis  of  an  economic  evaluation.  Economic  evaluations  are  also  performed  to  determine  re-
serves  and  the  “standardized  measure  of  value”  for  reporting  purposes  for  publicly  held
companies.  In  many  cases,  the  goal  of  the  company  is  to  make  decisions  that  have  the  best
chance of maximizing the present day profit. This chapter discusses economic evaluation under
two conditions. First, techniques that assume we know the future parameters with certainty are
discussed.  Later,  methods  of  handling  the  inherent  uncertainty  involved  in  oil/gas  operations
are discussed.

Having stated a company goal in terms of profit, it behooves us to examine the definition
of profit. There are at least three ways to calculate profit, each with its own set of assumptions
and rules and each leading to a different answer. The three models are the net cash flow mod-
el, the financial net income model, and the tax model.

In  the  simplest  analysis,  profit  for  a  period  is  the  revenue  received  during  the  period  less
the  costs  incurred  during  the  period.  Note  that  profit  is  defined  for  some  time  period,  which
can be arbitrarily long. In the oil/gas business the period is usually one month or one year. The
amount of revenue received during the period is usually similar for all three models, especially
for yearly periods. There might be some timing differences in revenue recognition, but they are
usually relatively minor. The three models differ considerably in the timing of the costs. Costs
can  be  further  subdivided  into  expenses,  which  benefit  only  the  current  period,  and  invest-
ments, which benefit more than one period. The cash flow model assumes that 100% of both
the  investment  and  the  expenses  are  recognized  when  they  occur.  The  financial  net  income
model  attempts  to  match  the  revenue  with  the  costs  to  produce  that  revenue.  This  leads  to
recognizing  the  expenses  in  the  current  period  and  recognizing  the  investment  over  a  longer
time period—often the life of the project. The total cost over the life of the project is the same
in the cash flow model and the financial net income model, but the portion of the costs allocat-
ed to each time period is significantly different. The concept of spreading the investment over
the productive life of the project leads to depreciation.

Accountants  may  use  various  types  of  depreciation  to  match  the  revenues  with  the  costs
required  to  generate  the  revenues.  Two  major  types  of  depreciation  are  “units-of-production”
and “straight-line” depreciation. Dividing the production for a period by the total volume to be

I-768

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

produced  and  multiplying  that  fraction  by  the  total  investment  yields  the  units-of-production
depreciation  for  a  period.  This  results  in  the  investments  being  allocated  on  a  $/barrel  basis.
The  straight-line  method  of  depreciation  allocates  the  investment  on  $/unit  time  basis.  Table
16.1 shows an example of each of the different ways of allocating an investment including the
modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS), which is currently used by the U.S. Inter-
nal Revenue Service for most oilfield investments.

The federal and state governments use the tax model to determine the amount of profit that
a company has made for each year so that a portion of that profit can be extracted to pay for
government services. The tax model allocates the investments to the period under consideration
in  yet  another  manner.  The  Internal  Revenue  Service  publishes  a  somewhat  arbitrary  table  of
allocation factors for different types of investments. This table is called a depreciation schedule
and  is  currently  the  MACRS  table  shown  in  Table  16.1.  The  term  “depreciation”  is  used  in
both  the  financial  net  income  model  and  the  tax  model,  but  the  calculation  method  is  very
different.

16.2 Economic Model for Oil and Gas Property Evaluation
The cash flow model is the most common model used to evaluate oil/gas projects. Normally,
only  very  large  acquisitions  are  evaluated  by  examining  the  impact  of  the  acquisition  on  the
financial net income. The tax model is used only if an after-tax analysis is done.

Cash flows for the project are forecast for each year or each month until the well or project
is no longer economical. Because of the ready availability of powerful computers, evaluations
are usually done on a monthly basis, and the results are reported on an annual basis. Monthly
calculations are more detailed but not necessarily more accurate. (There is often a tendency to
consider  more  detailed  calculations  as  being  more  accurate.  The  use  of  finer  time  increments
does not necessarily lead to projections that are more in conformity with truth.)

Whether  the  calculations  are  done  on  a  monthly  or  yearly  basis,  the  same  process  is  fol-
lowed.  The  profit  for  each  period  is  defined  as  net  cash  flow  and,  for  a  Royalty-Tax  system
such as that used in the U.S. and about one-half the other countries in the world, is calculated
as shown schematically in Fig. 16.1, adapted from Thompson and Wright,1 page 1-13. A sam-
ple calculation is shown in Table 16.2. The values in this table were calculated monthly and
then  accumulated  on  an  annual  basis.  Several  “terms  of  art”  are  used  in  the  oil/gas  business
and are described next.

Chapter 16—Petroleum Economics

Thompson and Wright.1

16.2.1 Gross Production.  Gross  production  is  the  volume  of  oil/gas  that  is  projected  to  be
produced during the particular month or year being calculated. Gross production is one of the
most important numbers entering the net cash flow calculation and, simultaneously, one of the
most difficult to determine accurately. Much of the science and art of petroleum engineering is
involved in estimating these numbers for future time periods.

16.2.2 Shrinkage.  In  the  model  defined  in  Fig.  16.1,  “shrinkage”  is  used  to  reduce  the  vol-
umes  produced  from  a  well  to  the  volumes  sold  from  a  well.  Usually  the  decline curves  that
are used to forecast future revenues are based on production rather than sales. If there is signif-
icant  shrinkage,  that  should  be  taken  into  account  before  calculating  the  cash  flows.  Typical
causes of shrinkage include lease use of gas for heater treaters or compressor fuel. Oil shrink-

I-770

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

age  might  occur  because  of  basic  sediment  and  water  (BS&W)  corrections  or  because  of
temperature  differences  between  the  volume  of  oil  measured  at  the  tank  and  volume  of  oil
measured at the refinery.

16.2.3 Gross Sales.  Gross sales is the volume of oil/gas that is projected to be sold during the
time period. If shrinkage is negligible, gross sales will equal gross production.

Typically, the people who drill and operate a well do not own the minerals they are extract-
ing.  For  example,  the  U.S.  Government,  state  governments,  Indian  tribes,  or  private  citizens
usually own minerals in the United States. In most other countries, the state usually owns the
minerals. The producers lease the right to develop the minerals from the mineral owners. This
leads to various kinds of interests in the property.

16.2.4 Working Interest.  Working interest is a share of the costs. The total of all the working
interests  in  a  well  must  be  equal  to  one.  Along  with  the  share  of  the  costs  comes  a  reduced
(usually) share of the revenue. It is quite common for a company to own less than 100% of the
working interest in a well or project. Owning smaller interests in many projects, called diversi-
fication, is one of the ways to manage the risk involved in drilling for oil/gas. Working interest
may  also  change  over  time  as  a  result  of  “oil  field  deals.”  Sometimes  one  party  will  pay  a
disproportionate share of the costs to drill the first well on a prospect to earn a share of a lease
held by some other oil company. As deals become more and more complex, it becomes very
difficult to determine ownership. One method of answering the “who, what, when” question is
discussed in Ref. 1.

16.2.5 Royalty.  Royalty is a share of the revenue free and clear of all costs of development
and production. The royalty is paid to the owner of the mineral interest under the land associat-
ed with the well. In the United States, the mineral interest can be “severed” from the surface
ownership so that the person who owns the surface may not have any interest in the minerals
and may not receive any income from a well. In rare cases the owners of the working interest
will  own  the  minerals  and,  in  that  case,  there  is  no  royalty.  Typical  royalty  rates  in  the  U.S.
range from 1/8 (12.5%) to 25% of the production. Royalties in other countries can range from
zero to more than 30%. Some royalties, such as Alberta’s, increase with increasing production
and price.

I-771

16.2.6 Overriding Royalty.  Overriding  royalty  is  the  same  as  a  royalty,  except  it  does  not
come about because of ownership of the mineral interest. An “override” is a classic way for a
lease broker or geologist to be compensated for buying leases or putting a deal together. Over-
rides may range from 1% of large deals to 7.5% of really “hot” or promising prospects.

16.2.7 Net Revenue Interest.  For net revenue interest, the working interest owners pay all of
the  costs.  Because  the  royalty  and  overriding  royalty  interest  owners  share  in  the  production,
but  not  in  the  costs,  the  working  interest  owners  as  a  group  receive  less  than  100%  of  the
revenue. In many cases, the working interest owners receive around 80% of the gross revenues,
although sometimes it might be as high as 87.5% or as low as 70% (or less). The share of the
gross  production  from  the  well  is  referred  to  as  “net  revenue  interest.”  If  there  is  a  12.5%
royalty, a 7.5% overriding royalty, and you own a 50% working interest, then your net revenue
interest is 40% (100% less 12.5% less 7.5% times 50%).

16.2.8 Net Sales.  Net  sales  is  the  product  of  gross  sales  and  net  revenue  interest.  It  is  your
share of the production after accounting for shrinkage, royalties, and splitting the proceeds with
other working interest owners.

16.2.9 Price.  Oil is usually priced in U.S.$/barrel except in some countries where it is priced
by the tonne. Gas is priced either in $/million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) or by the cubic
meter.  Be  careful  to  use  the  same  volume  units  on  the  sales  forecast  and  the  price  forecast.
The price of oil/gas varies dramatically with time and less dramatically with the quality of the
oil or gas. There are several “benchmark” crudes in the world, for which the price is reported
on a daily basis. Benchmark crudes include Brent in the North Sea, Minas in Indonesia, Urals
in Russia, Dubai in the Persian/Arabian Gulf, and others. The most commonly quoted number
in the U.S. is West Texas Intermediate (WTI) delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma.

WTI  is  the  underlying  product  for  the  New  York  Mercantile  Exchange  (NYMEX)  futures
prices.  According  to  the  NYMEX,  “crude  oil  is  the  world’s  most  actively  traded  commodity.
Over the past decade, the NYMEX division light, sweet (low-sulfur) crude-oil futures contract
has become the world’s most liquid forum for crude oil trading, as well as the world’s largest
volume futures contract trading on a physical commodity. Because of its excellent liquidity and
price  transparency,  the  contract  is  used  as  a  principal  international  pricing  benchmark.”2  The
physical  specifications  for  WTI  on  the  NYMEX  are  “crudes  with  0.42%  sulfur  by  weight  or
less, not less than 37°API gravity nor more than 42°API gravity.” Since 1992, the spot price of
WTI has been as low as $10.50/bbl in December 1998 and as high as more than $36.00/bbl in
the fall of 2000.

The actual price received by a producer is usually set for several days or one month at a
time  and  may  include  a  transportation  charge,  which  reduces  the  effective  price,  or  a  bonus
depending upon the supply and demand conditions in the local area. Many refiners are posting
prices  online,  and  these  postings  change  rapidly.  Conoco,  for  example,  posted  147  different
prices between January 1, 2001 and August 31, 2001, while Enron had 191 different prices in
the same period. (Crude oil price postings are another indicator of the volatility of the oil/gas
industry. When this chapter was first drafted in September 2001, the links to the postings were
Conoco,  Enron,  Tosco,  and  Phillips.  Since  then,  Enron  went  out  of  business,  while  Phillips
purchased  Tosco  and  then  merged  with  Conoco.)  Websites  that  have  crude  oil  price  bulletins
for  various  companies  are  www.conocophillips.com/buy/postings;  www.kochoil.com/crude.asp;
www.shell.ca/code/prices/oilprices.html; and seweb1.phillips66.com/crude/crudesupply.nsf.

Projecting the future price of oil to use in an evaluation is quite difficult, and unfortunately,
oil price is usually one of the most important factors in the evaluation. One popular, although
not necessarily accurate, way of projecting future prices is to use a forward “strip” either from
the NYMEX or from other crude oil traders. Fig. 16.2 shows the NYMEX oil strip as of Septem-

ber  1,  2001.  A  differential  between  the  property  being  evaluated  and  the  NYMEX  is  then
applied to estimate prices at the property. More information can be obtained from the NYMEX
website, which is www.nymex.com.

Natural  gas  prices  are  also  quoted  at  more  than  50  market  centers  throughout  the  United
States.  Examples include Opal,  Wyoming; Katy  Hub,  Texas; and  the  southern  California bor-
der.  Sabine  Pipe  Line  Company’s  Henry  Hub  in  Louisiana  is  the  hub  most  often  quoted.  In
April 1990 the NYMEX launched the world’s first natural gas futures contract with Henry Hub
as the physical delivery point. In October 1992, the NYMEX began trading options on natural
gas futures, which allowed traders and speculators to “play” the market. The natural gas mar-
ket  is  even  more  volatile  than  the  oil  market  with  prices  as  low  as  $1.80  in  early  1999  and
over $10 for a short time in December 2000. Future gas prices for use in an economic evalua-
tion  are  often  forecast  in  the  same  manner  as  previously  described  for  oil.  The  Henry  Hub
future  price  from  the  NYMEX  is  adjusted  for  “basis”  differential.  Fig.  16.3  shows  the
NYMEX gas strip as of September 1, 2001.

The NYMEX trades in “paper barrels,” in which the seller of a contract either has to pur-
chase an offsetting contract or deliver a specified volume of a specified quality of hydrocarbon
at  a  specified  location.  A  contract  on  the  NYMEX  consists  of  1,000  bbl  of  crude  or  10,000
MMBtu of gas. The forward strip shows the month when the crude or natural gas will have to
be  delivered;  the  prices  at  which  the  contract  traded  during  the  day;  the  number  of  contracts

“open” (open interest) where the obligation to deliver the commodity still exists; and the num-
ber  of  contracts  traded  during  the  previous  day.  Fig.  16.2  shows  that  on  September  1,  2001
there  were  open  interests  for  130  million  barrels  of  crude  for  October  delivery.  This  volume
represents more than one-half the crude oil produced in the United States during October 2001.
More information on these contracts can be obtained at www.nymex.com/jsp/index.jsp.

Many producers have chosen to use the NYMEX to “hedge” or set a price for their oil/gas
in the future. This can be an effective strategy for managing risk, but it can also be extremely
frustrating when gas is currently selling for $8/MMBtu on the spot market and it was agreed
months ago to sell gas today for $2.80/MMBtu.

16.2.10 State and Local Taxes.  In the U.S., most states levy a tax called a “severance” tax on
all  minerals  extracted  and  sold  from  a  property.  This  tax  may  range  from  3  to  12.5%  of  the
value of the minerals produced. Local taxing districts such as counties or taxing districts such
as fire districts may also impose a tax on oil/gas production. This tax is often referred to as an
ad  valorem  tax  from  the  Latin  for  “according  to  value.”  In  most  cases  the  assessed  value  of
the  property  is  multiplied  by  the  mill  levy  of  the  taxing  district  just  like  the  property  tax  on
houses and buildings. The method of calculating assessed value varies considerably from state
to state. The two most common methods of calculating assessed value are to use some fraction
of  the  revenue  received  and  to  use  some  fraction  of  the  calculated  net  present  value  of  the
projected  production.3  The  methodology  used  varies  widely  from  state  to  state  and  from  time
to  time.  Often,  ad  valorem  taxes  are  approximated  as  a  percentage  of  each  owner’s  revenue

I-774

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

when  calculating  net  cash  flow.  The  percentage  can  range  from  less  than  5  to  20%.  Indian
tribes  and  cities  in  some  states  may  also  collect  a  severance  tax  on  oil/gas  produced  within
their  borders.  In  most  cases,  each  party  pays  their  own  severance  and  ad  valorem  taxes.  In
other  words,  the  working  interest  owners  only  pay  state  and  local  taxes  on  their  share  of  the
production, and the royalty owners pay the tax on their share of the production.

In  countries  other  than  the  U.S.,  it  is  not  so  common  for  local  governments  to  impose  a
severance  tax,  but  it  does  occur.  An  example  is  Argentina,  where  the  provincial  governments
impose  a  sales  tax  ranging  from  1  to  2%.  In  most  cases  there  are  numerous  other  taxes  that
may need to be taken into account such as road taxes, airport taxes, or stamp duties. The oil
company usually attempts to negotiate an agreement that exempts them from all these taxes in
return for a royalty or a share of the production. These negotiations are sometimes successful
and sometimes not.

16.2.11 Operating Costs.  Operating costs are those costs that are necessary to maintain pro-
duction from the well. They would include direct expenses, such as electricity for a pumping
unit motor; hot oil treatments; payments to a pumper to monitor and do minor repairs on the
well;  replacement  of  pumps  or  rods;  fixing  flow  line  leaks;  plowing  roads;  and  a  myriad  of
other  expenses  associated  with  owning  an  interest  in  an  oil/gas  well.  Direct  expenses  might
range  from  $250/well  per  month  for  a  flowing  gas  well  to  $3,000/well  per  month  for  an  on-
shore  oil  well  producing  a  large  amount  of  fluid.  Offshore  wells  can  have  even  higher
operating costs.

Another  component  of  operating  costs  is  the  Council  of  Petroleum  Accountants  Societies
(COPAS)  or  fixed-rate  overhead  charge.  (As  stated  from  the  COPAS  website,  “COPAS  was
created in 1961 to provide a forum for discussing and solving the more difficult problems relat-
ed  to  accounting  for  oil/gas.  These  discussions  frequently  have  resulted  in  the  creation  of
guideline  documents  and  educational  materials.  You  can  find  these  materials  in  the  Products
section  of  this  site.  COPAS  has  grown  to  23  local  Societies  and  over  2,700  members  in  the
United States and Canada. COPAS has a strong emphasis in providing quality educational ma-
terials  related  to  oil/gas  accounting.”)4  For  producing  wells  this  is  a  charge  levied  by  the
operator of the property to reimburse the operator for the costs of administering the payment of
invoices,  disbursement  of  monies,  and  filing  of  government  forms  associated  with  the  lease.
This charge is subject to negotiation between the operator and the non-operators in a property
and  can  range  from  $100/well  per  month  to  $1,500/well  per  month  or  more.  The  accounting
firm  of  Ernst  &  Young  (E&Y)  surveys  operators  for  their  costs  of  company  operated  wells
annually. Even though the figures that E&Y solicit are internal numbers, they give an idea of
what  might  be  expected  for  COPAS  charges.  Their  most  recent  report  can  be  obtained  from
www.ey.com/global/Content.nsf/US/Energy_Chemicals_Utilities_-_Annual_Fixed_Rate_
Overhead_Survey.

Operating costs in other countries can vary dramatically. In most cases the operating costs
will include facilities to house expatriate workers and their dependents as well as other normal
operating expenses. Depending on the situation, these costs can be very significant in the cash
flow calculations.

16.2.12 Net Operating Income.  Sometimes called “cash generated from operations” or other
names,  net  operating  income  is  the  cash  flow  to  the  working  interest  owner  after  operating
costs  and  state  and  local  taxes  have  been  paid,  but  before  investments  have  been  made.  This
represents the cash generated during the period that is available for investment.

16.2.13 Income Tax.  Almost all federal governments including the United States Government
and most state governments levy a tax on income. The calculation of these taxes can be fairly
straightforward in countries such as Indonesia or extremely difficult, especially when a single

Chapter 16—Petroleum Economics

I-775

project is being evaluated for a reasonably large company in the U.S. Even when the appropri-
ate  software  is  available  to  aid  in  the  evaluation,  the  input  data  necessary  to  accurately
calculate income tax is often hard to obtain. For this reason and because income tax often has
a relatively low impact on the final decision, it is common practice to calculate before federal
income  tax  (BFIT)  net  cash  flows  when  evaluating  U.S.  properties.  Major  oil  companies  are
more likely to attempt to include the effects of income tax in their calculations, while indepen-
dents seldom include it. The effect of using BFIT numbers on the ultimate decision is highly
dependent  on  the  individual  case,  but  experience  indicates  that  in  the  U.S.  it  seldom  changes
the decision.

16.2.14 Investment.  Investments are costs that benefit future periods as opposed to operating
costs  that  only  benefit  the  current  period.  Examples  include  buying  a  lease,  drilling  a  well,
buying  and  installing  a  pumping  unit,  and  building  tank  batteries.  In  all  of  these  cases,  the
goods purchased are expected to help produce money far into the future.

16.2.15 Net Cash Flow.  Net cash flow is the amount of money that flows into or out of the
treasury during any one period. It is equal to the net operating income (either before or after
income taxes) less the investments.

Each of these items is estimated for every future time period until the net operating income
is no longer positive. At that time the well(s) is (are) usually assumed to be plugged and aban-
doned. There may be an additional expense at that time for abandonment costs, or the salvage
value of the equipment may be equal to or greater than the abandonment costs.

16.3 Time Value of Money
Money has a time value. This means a dollar received today has more value to us than a dollar
received far in the future. Other than a desire for instant gratification, there is a very rational
reason  for  this  phenomenon.  If  we  have  a  dollar  today,  we  can  put  it  to  work  by  making  an
investment and have more than a dollar at some future date. This concept of putting the money
to work has important implications later in this section when discount rates are discussed.

Another  important  concept  is  the  concept  of  equivalence  between  a  current  lump  sum  of
money and a lump sum to be received in the future. Offering someone a choice between receiv-
ing $100 today and receiving $101 one year from today can demonstrate this. Most people will
opt for the $100 today. If we increase the amount of future money to $115 or $125 or perhaps
$200  and  guarantee  payment,  there  will  be  a  point  at  which  the  future  sum  of  money  will
become more attractive than the current $100. The amount of future money necessary to sway
the person to choose the future sum is dependent upon many things—the inflation rate, current
opportunities to invest the $100, and perceived risk, among others. No matter what the amount
of money necessary to tip the scales, the concept that money has a time value is established.

In the case just discussed, if the person is indifferent to receiving $125 one year from now
or $100 now, we say that the two sums are “equivalent.” This concept of equivalence is funda-
mental  to  the  evaluation  of  all  engineering  projects.  We  are  often  faced  with  the  choice  of
having  a  certain  sum  of  money  now  or  receiving  various  sums  of  money  in  the  future.  By
determining the equivalence between money received today and money received in the future,
we can make an informed decision.

In the previous example, making the choice is relatively simple. There are only two sums
to  compare,  and  the  time  period  is  one  year.  This  is  usually  not  the  case  in  oil/gas  property
evaluations,  so  we  need  a  mechanism  to  handle  complex  choices.  The  mechanism  that  works
best is interest.

We can define interest as the amount of money that must be added to our current sum to
make an equivalent future sum. The amount of interest necessary to create equivalence is de-
pendent  upon  the  period  under  consideration.  We  may  be  indifferent  to  receiving  $100  now,

I-776

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

$112.50 six months from now, or $125 one year from now. In that case, the $12.50 or $25.00
is  the  amount  of  interest.  To  easily  compare  all  three  alternatives,  interest  is  compared  as  a
rate. It may be expressed as 12.5% per six months or 25% per year. The interest rate is calcu-
lated  by  dividing  the  amount  of  interest  paid  per  period  by  the  principal  amount  at  the
beginning of the period. Often, interest rate is expressed on an annual basis such as 25% per
annum.

For loans or bank deposits that exceed one year, the interest is usually compounded. That
is, the interest earned during the first period is added to the original principal to form the prin-
cipal for the second period. The compound interest concept will be used when calculating the
equivalence between a sum of money today and future sums of money.

16.3.1 Future Worth of a Lump Sum.  If we have a present sum of money, P, and we put it
to  work  at  a  compound  interest  rate,  i,  we  will  have  a  future  lump  sum  of  money,  F,  at  the
end of n periods. The relationship between these parameters is expressed in equation form as

F = P (1 + i)n. ............................................................ (16.1)

The term (1 + i)n is called the single payment compound amount factor in many texts and is
often tabulated.

Example 16.1 Future  Value.  $1,000  is  placed  in  a  bank  paying  12%  per  compounding

period. How much money will be in the account after five periods?

F = P (1 + i)n.

F = $ 1,000 (1 + 0.12)5.

F = $ 1,762.

16.3.2 Present Worth of Lump Sum.  Present worth of lump sum is by far the most important
equation  in  discussing  the  time  value  of  money.  This  one  equation  allows  the  creation  of  an
equivalence  between  future  projected  net  cash  flows  and  current  sums  of  money,  which  can
then be compared to the amount to be invested to obtain those net cash flows.

If an amount, F, is going to be received n periods in the future, then its present value, P,

can be calculated for a given interest rate, i, by rearranging Eq. 16.1.

P =

F

(1 + i)n . ............................................................. (16.2)

This is the inverse of the single payment compound amount formula. The justification for this
formula  lies  in  the  equivalence  concept.  The  sums  P  and  F  are  equivalent  to  each  other  be-
cause P could be invested at i for n periods to become F. The term (1 + i)–n is often referred
to  as  the  “single  payment  present  worth  factor”  or  “discount  factor.”  The  value  of  n  in  the
previous equations does not have to be an integer. Although there are some theoretical difficul-
ties, it is quite practical to use a value of 2.5 for n to create an equivalence between a future
lump  sum  received  2.5  periods  in  the  future  and  a  present  lump  sum.  This  technique  is  used
quite often when calculating the present value of annual cash flow streams.

When cash flows are calculated for several periods, as done in Fig. 16.1, Eq. 16.2 can be used
repeatedly to find the equivalent present value of each of the future cash flows.

16.3.3 Annuities and Loans.  There  are  a  number  of  specialized  equations  that  can  be  used
when particular types of repetitive cash flows are projected. In particular, when the same cash
flow, A, is received at the end of every period, the present value of the cash flow stream can
be calculated from the equation,

P =

A

i

(1 + i)n − 1

+ i

. ....................................................... (16.3)

Eq. 16.3 is often called the annuity equation because it can be rearranged to calculate the value
of  A,  which  is  the  amount  of  money  one  would  receive  at  the  end  of  every  n  period  if  one
invested  P  at  an  interest  rate  of  i.  It  is  also  used  to  calculate  loan  payments  where  P  is  the
principal amount.

Example 16.3 Loan. What are the monthly payments on a $100,000 loan with a term of

360 months (30 years) at an interest rate of 1% per month compounded monthly?

A = P

(1 + i)n − 1

A = $ 1,028.61.

There are a number of other specialized equations, but they are of limited use in today’s era of
fast computers. See Thompson and Wright,1 Chap. 2, for examples.

16.3.4 Annual vs. Monthly Interest Rates.  Interest rates are normally expressed on an annual
basis or per annum. As the previous equations show, when working with monthly cash flows,
it is necessary to convert the annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate. There are two ways
to do this: divide the annual interest rate by 12, or calculate the equivalent effective monthly
interest rate. These two methods will result in different answers.

I-778

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

from www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/consumerhdbk/cost.htm.

Consumer lending groups use the divide-by-12 method to comply with the Truth-in-Lend-
ing  Act.  The  Truth-in-Lending  Act  required  disclosures  from  lenders,  which  include,  among
other  things,  the  note  interest  rate,  any  points  or  origination  costs,  and  most  lender  imposed
fees, such as underwriting and processing fees. These fees are all rolled into the calculation of
an  annual  percentage  rate  (APR)  for  the  loan.  As  the  name  implies,  this  is  an  annual  rate.
Because most consumer loans are paid on a monthly basis, the monthly rate, used in Eq. 16.3
to  determine  the  monthly  payments,  is  obtained  by  dividing  the  annual  rate  by  12.  Fig.  16.4
from  the  Federal  Reserve  website  shows  some  sample  monthly  payments.  The  next  example
illustrates the calculation.

Example 16.4 Monthly Payment Calculation.
Loan principal = $6,000.
APR = 15%.
Monthly interest rate = 15%/12 = 1.25%/month.
Loan term = 4 years (48 months).

A = P

A = $ 6,000

+ 0.0125 .

(1 + 0.0125)48 − 1
A = $ 166.98.

The effective-monthly-rate method, although more complicated to calculate, has some advan-
tages as discussed later in Sec. 16.5. In this method, the annual interest rate is converted to a
monthly rate, which, when compounded 12 times, results in the annual interest rate. The deriva-
tion of the effective monthly interest rate begins with the relationship (1 + i) = (1 + im)12.

Rearranging this equation gives

im =

1

(1 + i)12 − 1........................................................... (16.5)

The  divide-by-12  method  leads  to  a  higher  monthly  payment  than  the  effective-monthly-rate
method, as shown in the next example.

16.4 Key Economic Parameters
When  the  purpose  of  an  economic  analysis  is  to  help  make  a  decision,  there  are  several  key
managerial  indicators  or  economic  parameters  that  are  considered.  Although  there  are  many
parameters  that  can  be  considered  (see  Thompson  and  Wright,1  Chap.  3),  the  most  common
decision  criteria  are  net  present  value,  internal  rate  of  return,  and  profit-to-investment  ratio
(both discounted and undiscounted). Each of these criteria is discussed next.

16.4.1 Net Present Value.  Net  present  value  is  the  sum  of  the  individual  monthly  or  yearly
net cash flows after they have been discounted with Eq. 16.2. In Table 16.2, the three columns
labeled “Discounted Net Cash Flow” show this calculation at annual discount rates of 10, 20,
and 34.3%. The net present values (NPV) at these discount rates are $99,368, $51,950, and $0,
respectively. In this table, the NPV were calculated on a monthly basis using effective-monthly
interest rates converted from annual rates with Eq. 16.5.

After the discounting method has been specified, there is still the question of what discount
rate  to  use.  The  author  recommends  the  company’s  average  investment  opportunity  rate  (see
Thompson and Wright,1 pages 3-7 and 3-8 and Newendorp and Schuyler,5 pages 9 through 12).
The average investment opportunity rate is the interest rate that represents, on average, the re-
turn of the future investment opportunities available to the company. This is the rate at which
the  treasury  will  grow.  An  alternative  interest  rate  is  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital
(WACC). This is an interest rate that, as the name indicates, is the average of the cost of each
source  of  financing  weighted  by  the  fraction  of  the  total  financing  that  source  represents.
Sources  of  financing  include  debt,  which  has  an  explicit  interest  rate  associated  with  it,  and
equity, which has an implicit cost associated with attracting and retaining investors. The aver-
age investment opportunity rate and the weighted average cost of capital are often very similar
to each other and often much lower than the typical “hurdle rates” used in the industry.

The  use  of  high  discount  rates  to  account  for  risk  is  not  recommended.  Much  has  been
written about the fallacy of using high discount rates (see, for example, Capen6). Later sections
of this chapter deal with decisions under uncertainty.

The  decision  criterion  using  net  present  value  is  very  simple.  For  project  screening,  all
projects  with  a  positive  NPV  at  the  company  average  investment  opportunity  rate  are  accept-
able.  If  the  projects  with  a  positive  NPV  perform  as  projected,  they  will  return  more  to  the
treasury than the average company project will return. In the case of mutually exclusive alterna-
tives,  where  choosing  one  alternative  precludes  choosing  another,  the  alternative  with  the

I-780

highest NPV should be chosen. An example of mutually exclusive alternatives might be choos-
ing between injecting CO2 or high- pressure air as a secondary recovery method—only one or
the other may be chosen, not both.

16.4.2 Internal Rate of Return.  Internal rate of return (IRR) has been a popular managerial
indicator since the 1950s, and it is still widely used today. IRR is defined as that interest rate
which,  when  used  in  the  calculation  of  NPV,  causes  the  NPV  to  be  zero.  In  Table  16.2  that
interest  rate  is  2.488%  per  month  or  34.30%  per  year.  Notice  that,  once  again,  we  are  using
the effective monthly interest rate and, therefore, must use Eq. 16.5 to convert to annual inter-
est rate.

IRR can easily be used to screen projects. If the IRR is greater than the average investment
opportunity  rate,  the  project  passes  the  screen.  However,  the  unwary  might  be  trapped  in  a
situation  where  two  mutually  exclusive  projects  are  being  compared.  Many  evaluators  have  a
tendency to think that the project with the larger IRR is the better project. This is not necessar-
ily so. If IRR is used to compare two mutually exclusive projects, it is necessary to calculate
the  IRR  on  the  incremental  capital  used  for  the  project  with  the  larger  investment.  Although
this  can  lead  to  the  correct  decision,  the  procedure  is  tedious  enough  that  it  is  easier  to  just
compare NPVs at the average investment opportunity rate. Choosing the project with the high-
er  NPV,  at  the  average investment opportunity rate, leads  to  the  same  decision as  calculating
incremental IRR.

Under  certain  circumstances  there  may  be  more  than  one  interest  rate  that  will  cause  the
NPV  to  be  zero.  This  is  referred  to  as  multiple  rates  of  return  and  occurs  primarily  in  the
evaluation  of  acceleration  projects.  As  stated  by  Phillips,7  an  acceleration  project  is  “one  in
which money is invested, not necessarily to show a profit but to decrease the time required to
obtain  the  income  from  a  project.  In  fact,  acceleration  projects  will  generally  result  in  a  net
loss.” An example acceleration project might be a decision to downspace from 80 acres to 40
acres in a coalbed methane field. In this hypothetical case, virtually the same amount of gas is
expected to be produced over a shorter time period, yet there is a large investment to drill the
additional  wells.  When  the  infill  project  is  evaluated  on  an  incremental  basis,  the  cash  flow
stream is negative then positive and then negative again, as shown in Table 16.3. On an undis-
counted  basis,  the  project  loses  money.  The  only  justification  for  doing  the  project  (in  this
hypothetical case) is to “accelerate” the cash flows, so the company can invest them elsewhere.
The number of sign changes in the cash flow stream is the number of potential values for
IRR. In Table 16.3, there are two sign changes (negative to positive in year one and positive to
negative in year six), so there are two values of IRR.

The key to evaluating acceleration projects is again to examine the NPV of the project at
the company average investment opportunity rate. The rationale for accelerating the cash flows
is to invest them elsewhere, so you must know what you are going to do with them (on aver-
age). If the NPV of the project is positive at the company average investment opportunity rate,
then  you  can  profitably  invest  the  accelerated  cash  flows  elsewhere.  If  the  NPV  is  negative,
you  are  better  off  not  accelerating  the  cash  flows.  Table  16.3  also  illustrates  how  sensitive
some of these projects can be to the company average investment opportunity rate. This project
is only profitable at interest rates between 1.2 and 12.9%, as shown in columns E and F. The
discounted net cash flow is zero at those interest rates. You would have to be very sure of the
numbers to invest $2,500,000 to return $15,374 more than average projects.

Several  years  ago,  a  spirited  discussion  appeared  in  the  literature  sparked  by  E.L.
Dougherty’s  paper  on  discounted  cash  flow  rate  of  return.8  This  discussion  presents  a  good
analysis of different points of view.

16.4.3 Discounted Profit-to-Investment Ratio.  Discounted profit-to-investment ratio has been
touted  by  R.D.  Seba9  as  “the  only  investment  selection  criterion  you  will  ever  need,”  in  his

Chapter 16—Petroleum Economics

I-781

paper of the same name. This paper and the various discussions of it present a good discussion
of  the  method.  Mechanically,  profit-to-investment  ratio  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  sum  of
either the net operating income or the net cash flow from a project by the sum of the invest-
ments.  If  undiscounted  numbers  are  used,  the  result  is  an  undiscounted  profit-to-investment
ratio;  if  discounted  numbers  are  used,  the  result  is  a  discounted  profit-to-investment  ratio.  If
net operating income is used in the numerator, a value of 1.0 is a breakeven value where the
investment  is  just  recovered.  If  net  cash  flow  is  used  in  the  numerator,  a  value  of  0.0  is  a
breakeven value. Either definition is appropriate for the numerator, as long as it is clearly stat-
ed which definition has been used.

Discounted profit-to-investment ratio at the company average investment opportunity rate is
indeed  a  powerful  selection  and  ranking  tool,  as  stated  by  Seba.  As  a  selection  tool,  all
projects  with  a  value  greater  than  1.0  (or  0.0)  would  be  selected.  In  the  presence  of  limited
capital, the projects are ranked in decreasing order of discounted profit-to-investment ratio and
selected until the capital available for investment is exhausted. This very simple tool results in
the portfolio of projects that causes the treasury to grow at the fastest rate, if the projects per-
form  as  expected.  Erdogan  et  al.10  pointed  out  that  “this  approach  maximizes  expected  value
but ignores risk. In fact, funding projects with the highest discounted P/I will tend to produce a
high-risk portfolio.” This is a valid criticism and is addressed at length in Sec. 16.8.

The example in Table 16.2 can be used to demonstrate the calculation of profit to invest-

ment ratio.

Total undiscounted net operating income = $585,369.

Total  investment  discounted  at  10%  =  $425,000  (because  only  one  investment  was  made

and that was at time 0).

Total net cash flow discounted at 10% = $99,368.

16.5 Recommended Practices for Economic Calculations
More than 70 different people have calculated the simple problem shown in Table 16.2 in three
phases.  Phase  One  consisted  of  30  runs  with  different  programs  during  the  1990s.  In  Phase
Two, the problem was run by 12 vendors of commercially available economic evaluation soft-
ware  in  late  1999  and  early  2000.  Phase  Three  included  runs  by  various  oil  company  and
vendor  personnel  during  late 2000  and  early 2001.  In  each phase,  the  problem statement was
identical, except for the effective and production dates, which were always January 1 and Febru-
ary  1,  respectively,  of  the  year  when  the  case  was  run.  The  problem  is  an  evaluation  of  a
drilling  prospect  assuming  a  single  “time  0”  investment,  exponential  decline,  and  escalating

Chapter 16—Petroleum Economics

prices and costs. The problem was originally designed to be solved by hand, so it has a five-
year life.

There  was  a  surprising  diversity  in  the  reported  answers.  For  example,  the  NPV  at  20%
was  expected  to  be  $51,950,  yet  the  answers  received  ranged  from  about  $3,000  to  almost
$100,000.  In  fact,  the  problem  was  solved  74  different  times,  which  resulted  in  68  different
answers. (More details are available in Wright and Thompson.11) In 2000, a large project con-
ducted  by  the  Society  of  Petroleum  Evaluation  Engineers  (SPEE)  found  that  the  differences
arise  from  a  combination  of  unstated  assumptions;  differences  in  interpretation  of  various  pa-
rameters;  different,  but  equally  valid,  treatment  of  factors  such  as  discounting  or  escalation;
and  apparent  misunderstanding  of  the  problem  statements.  The  results  of  that  study  indicated
that there was a great need for standardization and communication regarding upstream econom-
ic  calculation.  To  begin  that  communication  process,  the  SPEE  formed  committees  to  draft
recommended  evaluation  practices.  Ten  of  those  recommended  evaluation  practices  were  ap-
proved  by  the  members  attending  the  annual  meeting  of  SPEE  in  June  2001  and  are  in  the
process of being approved by the SPEE membership as a whole. These recommended engineer-
ing  practices  (REP)  address  issues  such  as  the  elements  of  a  report  (REP  1)  and  how  to
discount  cash  flows  (REP  5).  The  REPs  are  available  on  the  SPEE  website,  which  is
www.spee.org.  The  SPEE  REPs  are  not  intended  to  be  required  practices  but  are  suggested
ways to present the problem when you do not have compelling reasons to do otherwise.

REP 5 on discounting is of particular interest in the context of this chapter. It is recommend-
ed that end-month discounting be used for calculations using monthly cash flows and that mid-
year  discounting  be  used  for  calculations  using  yearly  cash  flows.  Additionally,  it  is
recommended  that  the  effective  monthly  interest  rate,  as  defined  by  Eq.  16.4,  is  used.  When
monthly cash flows are discounted using the effective monthly interest rate, the results are very
similar to that obtained by discounting annual numbers using mid-year discounting.

16.6 Risk Analysis for Oil and Gas Property Evaluation
In the previous discussions, we assumed to know the model parameters with certainty. This is
clearly not the case, so some method of handling uncertainty is appropriate. There have been a
number  of  textbooks  written  on  the  subject,  but  one  of  the  best  is  Decision  Analysis  for
Petroleum Exploration, originally written in 1975 by Paul Newendorp and updated in 2000 by
Newendorp and John Schuyler. The following discussion briefly covers some of the topics con-
tained in their book.

16.6.1 Risk and Uncertainty.  When making a decision in the oil/gas business, we are seldom
certain of the results of that decision. This is both the curse and the attraction of the industry.
Great fortunes can be made or squandered on the basis of a single decision. Some authors use
the terms “risk” and “uncertainty” interchangeably, and some authors make a great distinction
between them. We shall use the term uncertainty to express the concept that we do not know
the outcome of a decision when we make it. We shall use the term risk to mean that in any
decision we make, there is a possibility of an unpleasant outcome—losing money in the con-
text of this chapter. Further, we will assume rational decision making.

The practice of “risk analysis” or “decision analysis” is a way to analyze the potential re-
sults  of  decisions  objectively  and  consistently.  Risk  analysis  does  not  eliminate  dry  holes  or
even bankruptcy, but applied properly it helps keep you in the game. One of the most impor-
tant  aspects  of  “playing  the  game”  is  to  try  to  make  sure  you  are  in  a  winning  game.  Risk
analysis can provide the information to keep you from playing a known losing game, such as
being on the wrong side of the roulette wheel in a gambling casino, but it may not help you
much if you are unknowingly playing a losing game while thinking you have a chance of win-
ning. Judgment (and luck) still count.

I-784

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

16.6.2 Expected Monetary Value Concept.  Expected  monetary  value  (EMV)  is  the  founda-
tion of risk analysis as described in this chapter. Newendorp and Schuyler5 (page 82) state that
“the  expected  value  concept  is  more  nearly  a  strategy,  or  philosophy  for  consistent  decision
making than an absolute measure of profitability.” In applying the strategy, the decision maker
should  be  playing  a  winning  game,  should  have  sufficient  money  for  repeated  trials,  and
should apply the concept consistently over a large number of decisions. Numerically, expected
value  is  the  return  on  average  given  repeated  trials.  That  is,  over  the  long  haul,  we  would
obtain an average result equal to the expected value. When making a decision, each alternative
has an expected value associated with it. Having made a decision, there are a number of poten-
tial outcomes. The expected value of a decision alternative is obtained by summing the product
of the probability of occurrence of a potential outcome and the payoff for each potential out-
come. This is done for each decision alternative, and we then choose the one with the highest
expected monetary value.

As an example, assume you have 100 prospects to drill: 10 prospects contain oil worth $10
million (each), and 90 contain nothing but heartbreak and cost you $100,000 (each) to drill and
abandon.  All  numbers  are  net  present  values  at  the  company  average  opportunity  investment
rate and, therefore, include the costs to drill and produce the oil. The costs include additional
development  wells.  If  you  drill  all  100  prospects,  you  will  have  a  present-day  profit  of  10  ×
$10 million less 90 × $100,000 or $1 million. This is certainly a winning game. [(Now, if we
could run a three-dimensional (3D) seismic survey to highgrade the prospects and only drill 20
wells  to  get  our  $100  million  of  oil,  we  would  be  playing  a  winning  game.  That  analysis  is
beyond the purview of this chapter but is a topic under the category of “decisions to purchase
imperfect information.”] We can divide the $1 million profit by the 100 wells we drilled and
see  that  each  well  is  worth  $10,000  on  average.  Let  us  use  expected  value  to  investigate  the
drilling of one well.

Out of 100 possible wells, ten will result in field discoveries. Therefore, the probability of
success is 10%. If we are successful in discovering a field, the conditional value of that suc-
cess  is  $1  million.  The  probability  of  failure  (dry  hole)  is  90%,  and  the  conditional  value  of
failure is –$100,000. We can analyze this example in a table such as Table 16.4. The expected
value  of  the  decision  alternative  is  +$10,000,  found  at  the  bottom  of  column  D.  This  is  the
same value we calculated (on average) assuming we drilled all 100 prospects. So what happens
if  our  model  truly  represents  nature  and  we  drill  the  well?  We  probably  drill  a  dry  hole  and
lose $100,000. In fact, that will happen nine times out of ten (on average). This is where the
repeated trials and consistent application previously mentioned come in. If we apply the same
methodology a large number of times, the odds are in our favor, and we will prevail. We ex-
pect the odds to catch up with us somewhere around 30 trials.

In  this  table,  we  are  modeling  what  we  expect  to  find  in  nature.  That  model  can  be  as
simple  as  shown  in  Table  16.4,  or  it  can  be  excruciatingly  complex  with  hundreds  or  even
thousands of potential outcomes. However, simple or complex, some conditions must be met.
First, the probabilities in column B must sum to exactly one. That means our model includes

Chapter 16—Petroleum Economics

I-785

all  possible  outcomes  or  states  of  nature.  This  may  be  uncomfortable  at  first,  but  it  is  neces-
sary.  Second,  each  conditional  value  for  an  outcome  must  include  all  costs  to  achieve  that
outcome and all revenues from that outcome. Third, the net present values must be calculated
using  the  company  average  opportunity  rate.  We  are  always  comparing  a  decision  alternative
with the “do nothing” alternative. If we “do nothing,” we are implicitly saying we are going to
invest the money in average projects for the company, which will earn money at the company
average  opportunity  rate.  The  expected  monetary  value  (EMV)  for  that  decision  alternative  is
zero. In order for our analysis to make any sense at all, that rate must be used in calculating
expected values.

Expected value theory assumes that the decision maker is impartial to money. This means
that a gain of $10,000 brings the same amount of positive “utility” as a loss of $10,000 brings
negative utility. If the gain of $1 million does not bring ten times as much pleasure as the loss
of $100,000 brings pain, then the expected values should be expressed in a “currency” such as
utility that linearizes the problem. Newendorp and Schuyler (Chap. 5) discuss utility theory as
do others.12–14 In practice, the decision maker is usually impartial to money because the individ-
ual  decisions  are  small,  relative  to  the  size  of  the  treasury,  or  can  get  that  way  by  joint
venturing with other companies.

EMV  provides  a  means  to  screen  projects,  compare  two  mutually  exclusive  projects,  and
rank projects in the presence of uncertainty. When screening projects, all projects with positive
EMVs pass the screen. When comparing mutually exclusive projects, choose the one with the
largest EMV. When ranking projects, rank them by the EMV to expected investment ratio.

Ranking  projects  by  EMVs  to  expected-investment  ratio  suffers  from  the  same  criticism
that discounted profit-to-investment ratio suffers. Namely, this ranking may lead to the highest
aggregate NPV, but it also leads to the highest risk portfolio. It may be possible to choose a
different mix of projects that will significantly reduce the overall risk without significantly re-
ducing the overall EMV. That is the goal of the emerging field of “portfolio analysis,” which
is discussed in Sec. 16.8.

EMV  calculations  lend  themselves  to  sensitivity  analysis.  It  is  a  simple  matter  to  change
probabilities and/or payoffs and recalculate the results. One very enlightening graph is a plot of
expected value vs. probability of success. For a two-outcome scenario (or a scenario that can
be reduced to two outcomes), the relationship between EMV and probability of success is lin-
ear. You only need to know the NPV given failure and the NPV given success to prepare the
plot. The plot for the example in Table 16.4 is shown in Fig. 16.5. Note that at a probability
of  success  of  10%,  the  EMV  is  $10,000.  As  the  probability  of  success  increases,  the  EMV
increases rapidly, reaching $450,000 per well at a 50% success ratio. The plot can be used to
estimate the breakeven probability of success, which in this case is 9%. If the considered opin-
ion  of  the  explorationists  is  that  the  probability  of  success  lies  between  15  and  30%,  the
decision is easy. If the probability of success lies between 5 and 15%, more analysis may be
indicated.

16.6.3 Decision Trees.  Decision  trees  are  useful  tools  to  analyze  a  series  of  sequential  deci-
sions,  although  they  can  be  used  for  single  decisions  as  well.  They  are  a  way  to  graphically
represent the principles discussed in the section about expected monetary value. Traditionally,
decision  trees  are  constructed  with  “time”  flowing  from  left  to  right  and  are  made  up  of
“nodes” that are connected by “branches.” There are three types of nodes: decision nodes repre-
sented  by  squares,  chance  nodes  represented  by  circles,  and  terminal  nodes  represented  by
triangles. Fig. 16.6 illustrates the previous sample EMV problem in a decision tree format.

The first square node shows two possible decisions: drill a well, or drop the acreage. In a
real-world example, we may have more options, such as release the property, bring in a part-
ner,  and  others,  but  that  just  adds  to  the  number  of  branches  emanating  from  the  decision
node. If we drop the acreage, we arrive at a terminal node, and it will cost us nothing. If there

I-786

Fig. 16.6—Example decision tree.

were abandonment costs, they would be shown as negative numbers on that terminal node. The
round  chance  node,  if  we  drill,  shows  all  the  possible  outcomes  just  like  the  decision  table
(Table 16.4). Notice that if we drill, the probabilities and payoffs are the same as those used in
the EMV problem.

The  probabilities  attached  to  a  chance  node  must  sum  to  exactly  1.0.  This  means  we  be-
lieve we have modeled all the possible outcomes. If a two-outcome decision tree is too simple
for your problem, as it probably should be, then you can add as many branches as you wish to
the  chance  node.  There  are  two  options  in  assigning  costs  or  payoffs  to  get  to  the  terminal
node.  One  is  to  only  show  the  incremental  costs  (payoffs)  to  get  from  one  node  to  another.
The other is to show all the costs and payoffs from the root to the terminal node. The incremen-
tal  method  makes  sensitivity  runs  easier,  while  the  total  cost/payoff  method  is  often  easier  to
explain. Done properly, both methods arrive at the same answer.

A decision tree is solved from right to left by “rolling” it back. The expected value of each
chance  node  closest  to  the  terminal  nodes  is  determined  just  as  shown  in  the  expected  value
table (Table 16.4). The chance node may now be replaced with its expected value and the tree
to  the  right  “trimmed”  to  simplify  the  presentation.  This  procedure  is  repeated  with  the  next
line of chance nodes, if any, until a decision node is reached. At this node the decision rule is
to make the decision with the highest EMV. Note that the highest EMV may still be negative

but less negative than the alternatives. Again, the decision node can be replaced with the value
of the highest EMV. The procedure is repeated until there is only one decision node remaining
at the left side of the tree. The decision rule is to make the decision with the highest EMV.

The  solved  decision  tree  for  the  example  is  shown  in  Fig.  16.7.  The  chance  node  on  the
upper right, which had shown a 10% chance of a +$1,000,000 outcome and a 90% chance of a
–$10,000  outcome  has  been  replaced  by  the  “certainty  equivalent”  of  +$10,000.  (0.1  times
+1,000,000 plus 0.9 times –100,000 equals +10,000.) Notice that the rejected decision alterna-
tive  “drop”  has  two  slashes  through  its  branch.  This  is  the  traditional  method  of  showing  a
rejected alternative. Once a decision tree has been solved, it is a simple matter to run sensitivi-
ty  analyses.  If  we  wish  to  evaluate  the  difference  a  $150,000  dry  hole  cost  has  on  our
example, we could revise the terminal value for dry hole and resolve the decision tree. In that
case, the expected value of the decision alternative drill is –$35,000, and we should drop the
lease  without  drilling.  Fig. 16.8  shows  the  solved  decision  tree  for  that  case.  But  what  if  the
probability  of  success  is  really  20%  with  a  $150,000  dry-hole  cost?  Fig.  16.9  shows  that  the
decision  is  now  to  drill  with  an  EMV  of  $80,000.  This  analysis  can  be  continued  as  long  as
desired, and it is possible to plot sensitivities to any of the parameters.

Decision  trees  are  quite  useful  for  analyzing  sequential  decisions  because  all  the  possible
courses  of  action  can  be  laid  out  with  probabilities  and  payoffs  before  the  first  decision  is
made.  As  the  project  proceeds,  the  tree  can  be  modified  to  remove  the  decisions  that  have
already been made and update the remaining decisions, probabilities, and payoffs. They can be
as simple or as complex as desired and may even use Monte Carlo simulation to assign values

to the terminal points. Additional discussions can be found in Newendorp and Schulyer (Chap.
4), as well as many others.15,16

16.6.4 Monte Carlo Simulation.  Monte Carlo Simulation is a calculation technique that uses
distributions for uncertain input variables rather than single point estimates. It results in a distri-
bution of potential outcomes with associated probabilities and has a number of advantages:

• The possibility to describe uncertainty in the input variables using distribution of possible

values rather than a single average or most likely value.

• All of the parameters that are not known with certainty can be correctly modeled (limited

by our ability to understand the distribution of the input values).

• It  can  be  used  to  model  any  system  or  process  that  can  be  described  with  mathematical

relationships.

• The model can be very simple or extremely complex as necessary. With the current com-

puter power available, it is possible to run very complex models in minutes or hours.

• Any type of distribution can be used to describe a particular input variable.
• It allows for the blending of the expertise of the entire company. Geologists can describe
the uncertainty of geological parameters. Engineers can describe the uncertainty of engineering
parameters.

• The  cost  of  doing  a  simulation  model  is  typically  small,  especially  in  comparison  to  a

pilot project.

parameters and rerun the simulation.

• The  method  lends  itself  to  sensitivity  analysis.  It  is  easy  to  change  one  or  more  of  the

There are also a number of pitfalls in Monte Carlo Simulation:
• It requires an attempt at quantifying uncertainty. Depending upon the corporate culture, it

may be very difficult to accept that there is more than one possible answer.

• It  requires  expertise  to  build  the  computer  model  and  debug  it.  This  is  true  even  with

current available spreadsheet models.

• Like  any  computer  calculation,  it  is  subject  to  the  garbage  in/garbage  out  (GIGO)  prob-

lem. If the input data distributions are wrong, the answers are almost sure to be wrong.

• There is a tendency to believe the answers because of the sophistication of the calculation

technique.

• It is sometimes difficult to convey the results of the simulation to management in a man-
ner they can understand. Often, management is looking for the answer rather than a range of
answers with associated probabilities of occurrence.

A Monte Carlo simulation study consists of the following steps:
1. Determine the objectives of the study. This is often a simple step with an answer such as
“determine remaining reserves” or “determine whether or not to take this deal.” Occasionally,
however, this can lead to intense discussions about the goals of the corporation and “what we
are really about.” Normally, we try to use simulation to help make a decision. Keep the objec-
tive in mind as you design the study.

2. Determine  the  mathematical  relationships  between  variables.  Again,  sometimes  this  can

be very simple and sometimes the system being simulated can be extremely complex.

3. Separate variables that are known with certainty and variables that are subject to uncer-
tainty.  There  is  a  real  tendency  to  say,  “We  know  so  little  about  this  variable  that  we  can’t
come up with a distribution, so let us just assume it is known.” An example might be a price
forecast  where  there  is  so  much  uncertainty  that  we  just  use  the  current  oil  price  and  hold  it
constant.  Of  course,  this  is  totally  contrary  to  what  we  are  trying  to  do.  Important  uncertain
variables should always be simulated with a distribution. It is possible to simplify the problem
and still get a valid result. At this stage, it would be appropriate to perform an analysis to see
what  variables  have  the  greatest  effect  on  the  outcome.  If  a  variable  has  little  effect  on  the

Chapter 16—Petroleum Economics

I-789

outcome or decision, even if it is uncertain, then a cost-effective solution can be obtained by
fixing the value of that variable and treating it as known.

4. Determine whether variables are independent or if partial (or full) dependencies or corre-
lations exist. In some cases variables are independent of each other. For instance, in calculating
volumetrics,  the  area  of  the  trap  almost  never  depends  on  the  value  of  oil  formation  volume
factor. However, the average water saturation often depends on the average porosity, and that
relationship should probably be taken into account. A great deal of thought should be put into
this  stage  of  modeling.  An  example  of  dependencies  between  offshore  gas  fields  is  contained
in the paper by van Elk et al.17

5. Choose distribution types and parameters for the independent variables. The types of dis-
tribution, which can be used in currently available simulation programs, are virtually unlimited.
Examples  include  uniform  distributions  where  any  value  of  the  input  variable  has  the  same
chance of occurring as any other value, and triangular distributions where values close to the
mode, or the most likely value, are much more likely to occur. Although the choice of the type
of  distribution  may  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  outcome,  we  often  do  not  have  sufficient
data to discern a log-normal distribution from a triangular distribution with any degree of cer-
tainty. It is recommended that the distribution shape be chosen from theoretical considerations
and the data we have used to determine parameters for that type of distribution.

6. Model total or partial dependencies. Dependencies and correlations can be modeled in a
number  of  ways.  One  of  the  most  popular  methods  uses  the  bounding  envelope  method,  as
described  in  Murtha,18  and  Newendorp  and  Schuyler  (pages  436  through  457).  This  has  the
advantage of allowing the user to fully control the type of dependency at the expense of some
programming  effort.  The  other  method  uses  the  rank  correlation  coefficient  available  in  com-
mercially available software programs. (See Murtha, page 89.)

7. Perform the simulation. A number of software programs are available to perform the cal-
culations.  Some  are  add-ins  to  spreadsheet  programs,  and  some  are  stand-alone  programs.  A
simple example, shown later in this chapter, steps through the calculation method. Depending
on the complexity of the problem and the effect of low probability events, it might be neces-
sary to run as few as 1,000 passes or as many as 1,000,000 passes. Typically, 5,000 or 10,000
passes is sufficient.

8. Calculate the results and display the answers. The results are usually presented as tables
and graphs such as histograms and cumulative frequency curves. Values of interest, such as the
mean or expected value of the outcome, are reported. In economic evaluation, the user is also
usually interested in the probability that the project will lose money or exceed a certain mini-
mum rate-of-return, so these values are examined.

9. Perform a sensitivity analysis. Once the model has been set up and verified, it is relative-
ly easy to alter some of the critical assumptions and see what effect that has on the outcomes.
Assumptions  can  be  examined  in  greater  detail,  especially  assumptions  that  have  the  greatest
effect and might cause a different decision to be made.

A  simple  example  of  the  use  of  Monte  Carlo  simulation  would  be  to  use  the  hyperbolic

decline equation to calculate remaining reserves. The equation is

ERR =

qin

(1 − n) Di

(qi1 − n − qel 1 − n) f . ....................................... (16.10)

For the purposes of illustration, assume we have the deterministic or single-value estimates of
the parameters: qi = 100 B/D, qel = 5 B/D, Di = 0.6/year, and n = 0.3.

With these values the estimated remaining reserves (ERR) are calculated to be 76,231 bbl.
However, if we do not know all the values with certainty, we can use Monte Carlo simulation
to calculate the expected value for ERR, as well as a range of values and their associated prob-

I-790

abilities. Let us assume that the uncertainty in all the values can be represented by triangular
distributions and that the mean of the triangular distributions are the previously stated values.
(The mean of a triangular distribution is the sum of the minimum, mode, and maximum values
divided by three.) Let us also assume that the variables are independent; for instance, qel is not
a function of qi. An example set of distribution parameters is shown in Table 16.5. When this
set of distributions is run through a Monte Carlo Simulator 10,000 times, the results are shown
in Table 16.6.

There are several important results. Note first that the mean value of ERR from the Monte
Carlo  Simulation  (79,088  bbl)  is  not  the  same  as  the  deterministic  value  (76,231  bbl),  even
though the means for the inputs to the Monte Carlo simulation were the deterministic values.
Also note that the value of ERR, using the “most likely” values for each variable (68,847 bbl),
is also considerably different. These results occur because the nature of the equation for calcu-
lating  ERR  is  complex;  uncertain  variables  are  raised  to  powers  of  other  uncertain  variables;
and input distributions are not symmetrical.

The minimum and maximum values calculated for ERR are not particularly meaningful be-
cause  they  can  vary  considerably  with  the  number  of  simulation  passes.  However,  note  that
90%  of  the  values  lie  between  57,027  bbl  and  111,288  bbl.  This  is  a  very  wide  range  and
gives an indication of the magnitude of uncertainty. Table 16.7 contains the complete distribu-
tion of ERR as calculated in this simulation. If another set of calculations was run, the 0 and
100% numbers could change considerably, but the numbers near the center of the distribution
would not change significantly. A second simulation run was made, as shown in Table 16.7. In
the “Pass 2” column, the median (50%) values vary by less than 0.2% and, in this case, even
the 0 and 100% values do not change significantly from those in the “Pass 1” column.

If one were to decide to use the 10% value as the official value for remaining reserves, that
value would be 59,903 bbl, which is 21% less than the value calculated deterministically. (The
presentation of cumulative frequency shown here is a percentage less than presentation, which
is quite common. If a percent greater than presentation is used, the table will show that 90% of
the calculated values are greater than 59,903 bbl.) A graph of the data in the cumulative fre-
quency table is shown in Fig. 16.10.

Chapter 16—Petroleum Economics

Fig.  16.10  and  its  associated  table  are  very  common  outputs  from  a  Monte  Carlo  simula-
tion.  Another  common  output  is  a  histogram  in  which  the  relative  frequency  of  a  particular
range of outcomes is plotted, as shown in Fig. 16.11. The values plotted on the x-axis are the
midpoints  of  the  bars.  The  most  common  result  of  the  calculation  is  a  value  between  75,000
and 85,000 bbl, which occurs about 26% of the time.

The sensitivity of the results to the various input parameters is often presented in one form
of  a  “Tornado”  diagram,  such  as  Fig.  16.12.  In  these  diagrams,  the  input  parameter  with  the
largest regression correlation coefficient is plotted at the top of the figure, and the other input
parameters  are  plotted  at  the  bottom  in  descending  order;  thus,  resulting  in  a  tornado  shape.
This same information can also be presented in tabular form, as shown in Table 16.8.

The regression correlation coefficient, reported by the commonly available Monte Carlo sim-
ulation software, is simply the square root of the r2 value from a linear fit of ERR to each of
the input variables. In Table 16.8, n has a correlation coefficient of +0.73. The positive correla-
tion coefficient means as n increases, ERR increases. The square of the correlation coefficient
(0.53) means that 53 percent of the variability of ERR can be explained by the variation in n.
Fig.  16.13  is  a  crossplot  of  ERR  and  n.  The  linear  least  squares  fit  of  the  data  has  an  r2  of
0.53, which results in an r of 0.73, as shown in Fig. 16.12 and Table 16.8. Similarly, Di has a
large effect on  ERR,  as  shown  in  Table 16.8.  However,  because the  correlation coefficient is
negative, increases in Di result in decreases in ERR. The estimate of qel has little effect on the
remaining reserves for this example. Only 2% (–0.1462) of the variability in ERR is explained
by the variability in qel.

16.6.5 Interpretation of Results.  One of the more important numbers is the mean or expected
value  of  the  distribution.  We  can  make  a  decision  with  this  number  alone,  just  as  we  have
done with EMV and decision trees. However, much more information is available, such as the
probability of the project losing money (assuming EMV was calculated in the simulation) and
the chances of the project making a large amount of money. Ideally, the entire cumulative fre-

quency graph should be presented and compared with other projects, so the decision maker can
see the full spectrum of anticipated possibilities.

16.6.6 Further Reading.  There are a number of good references on Monte Carlo simulation,
including  a  paper  by  Murtha19  and  the  text  by  Newendorp  and  Schuyler  (Chap.  8).  Another
excellent reference is Chap. 10 on Risk Analysis and Decision Making in Vol. VI, Emerging
and Peripheral Technologies.

16.7 The Next Frontier
There are two methods of advanced decision analysis that are slowly making their way into the
petroleum project evaluation process. One of these is known as portfolio analysis, and the oth-
er  is  the  real  options  analysis.  The  portfolio  analysis  quantifies  the  effect  of  interactions
between  projects,  and  the  real  options  analysis  attempts  to  value  the  fact  that  a  company  has
several options in developing projects, such as the ability to abandon a project early or defer a
decision to make an investment until the financial climate is more beneficial.

16.7.1 Portfolio  Analysis.    Portfolio  analysis  is  based  on  the  Nobel  Prize-winning  work  of
Harry Markowitz in the early 1950s20,21 in which he showed that the variance in results from a
portfolio  of  stocks  could  be  reduced  by  choosing  stocks  with  a  negative  correlation.  If  two
stocks  are  correlated  negatively,  when  one  stock  is  down  the  other  stock  will  be  up,  and  the
portfolio  will  grow  with  very  few  wild  swings.  This  concept  has  been  introduced  into  the
petroleum literature by several authors22–30 with some modifications. The following paragraphs
from Brashear, Becker, and Faulder23 give an overview of the methodology. (Superscripts de-
noting the references have been added by the current author.)

Harry Markowitz (1957)21 demonstrated in the stock market that risk and return are usually correlated. Achiev-
ing higher yields generally necessitates taking greater risks. Further, he pointed out the risk-reducing effects

Chapter 16—Petroleum Economics

of  diversification  were  reduced  if  multiple  investments  are  positively  correlated  but  amplified  if  the  invest-
ments  are  negatively  correlated.  He  posited  that  a  rational  investor  would  seek  the  mix  of  investments
(portfolios) for which no other combination would have a higher return without increased risk or lower risk
without  loss  of  return.  He  coined  the  phrase  “efficient  frontier”  for  the  set  of  portfolios  that  meets  these
conditions. The choice of a single portfolio along this frontier depends on the decision-maker’s tolerance for
risk.
David  Hertz  (1968)25  extended  these  concepts  from  investments  in  financial  assets  to  investments  in  “real”
assets.  An  efficient  frontier  could  be  composed  of  capital  projects  that  reflected  both  economic  value  and
risk (measured by standard deviation). Newendorp26 recognized Hertz’s work and speculated about a 2D dis-
play (expected value and expected loss) to illuminate individual project selections but did not propose a full
portfolio  optimization  approach.  Ball  (1983)27  applied  Hertz’s  insights  specifically  to  the  upstream  oil  busi-
ness. This idea was later proposed also by Hightower and David (1991)28 and Edwards and Hewitt (1993)29
and updated by Howell et al. (1998),24 Ball and Savage (1999)30 and Brashear et al. (1999).31–33
While these conceptual advances were being made, increases in the speed of commonly available computers
and the efficiency of the required solution algorithms have made the approach practical at field, division, and
corporate levels.
The method is conceptually simple but computationally complex. The algorithm is a mathematical program-
ming solution that evaluates all combinations of investments that yield a specific “target” expected value to
define the one combination (portfolio) with the lowest risk at a given capital constraint. Other constraints can
be added. The process is repeated for all other specific target values, each time finding the specific portfolio
with the lowest risk. The locus of the minimum-risk points, the efficient frontier, is the set of all portfolios
that satisfies the criterion that no increase in value is possible (given the constraints) without greater risk and
no reduction in risk is possible without loss in value. Other algorithms find the maximum value at each risk
level; either way the result is the same.
Fig. 16.14 is an example of the results of a portfolio analysis presented as a graph of re-
ward vs. risk showing the efficient frontier. In some references, the axes are reversed. Reward
is often represented by expected monetary value (EMV), while risk has several possible defini-

tions.  Markowitz  used  variance  of  the  expected  portfolio  return  as  a  metric  for  risk  (or  its
square  root,  standard  deviation).  The  petroleum  industry  is  more  concerned  about  downside
risk, so oftentimes, semistandard deviation (the downside) or mean loss is used as a measure of
risk. Whatever the metrics, the objective is to select a portfolio of projects that maximizes re-
ward  for  an  acceptable  level  of  risk.  A  quantitative  example  is  used  to  demonstrate  the
methodology.

Table 16.9 contains the  parameters for  estimated distributions of  net  present  value (NPV)
for  nine  different  projects  (labeled  A  through  I),  along  with  the  present  value  cost  of  each
project  and  the  ratio  of  EMV  to  investment.  Net  present  value  is  the  result  of  one  possible
outcome, while EMV is the expected value or average of all of the possible outcomes. In this
example,  the  NPV  is  assumed  to  be  normally  distributed  for  each  project.  Using  the  ranking
criterion  from  Sec.  16.6.2,  the  projects  are  ranked  in  order  of  decreasing  EMV  to  investment
ratio and chosen until the budget is exhausted. For a budget of $2,500 (which applies through-
out the examples that follow), the project mix is I, D, G, and H, which results in an expected
value of $1,591. Correlation between the projects, such as those caused by oil price, rig rates,

geological concepts, or pipeline constraints, is ignored with this ranking method. Later in this
section,  correlations  are  included.  While  this  portfolio  has  the  highest  EMV,  it  also  has  the
highest risk, whether risk is defined as variance or as mean loss. For the purposes of illustra-
tion, the projects are assumed to be positively correlated, as shown in Table 16.10. If risk is
defined  as  variance  or  standard  deviation,  an  analytical  solution  can  be  used  to  calculate  the
variance of the correlated projects.29 When the efficient frontier is calculated with the methods

shown by Winston,34 the result is as shown in Fig. 16.15. The standard deviation of the expect-
ed  returns  can  be  reduced  from  $681  to  $300,  if  the  decision  maker  is  willing  to  accept  a
reduction  in  expected  results  from  $1,591  to  $1,200.  This  might  be  a  good  trade  because  the
company can still capture 75% (1,200/1,591) of the expected value while reducing its exposure
to variance by 56% (381/681). Deviations about the mean for net present value at various lev-
els of risk (defined as standard deviation about EMV) are shown in Fig. 16.16. There is about
a 16% chance (–1 standard deviation) that the NPV will be less than approximately $900 for
risk levels from $300 to $681. Notice that the less risky portfolios are very unlikely (<2.3%) to
return less than about $575 (–2 standard deviations), while the most aggressive portfolio could
return less than $228. Of course, there is a corresponding decrease in the potential upside if a
more conservative portfolio is chosen.

The optimal portfolio for each point on the efficient frontier can be calculated. Fig. 16.17
graphically illustrates the project mix for several points on the efficient frontier. At an expected
value of $1,200 (standard deviation of $300), the project mix is 7% of A, 100% of D, 77.7%
of  E,  100%  of  F,  15.3%  of  G,  and  100%  of  I.  Project H,  selected using  EMV/investment, is
not selected at all, while 100% of F was taken in which only two projects were ranked lower
using EMV/investment. This is because F is almost a sure thing with a standard deviation of
22 about a mean of 147, while the return on H is quite uncertain with a standard deviation that
exceeds its expected value.

This analysis assumes that a continuous range of interests from 0 to 100% is available in
each  project.  For  those  instances  in  which  the  available  interests  are  available  only  in  incre-
ments such as 15, 25, 35, 50, 75, or 100%, the same methodology can be applied. However,
the resulting efficient frontier will be jagged and discontinuous.

The effect of correlation between the projects is shown in Fig. 16.18. The highest EMV is
independent of the correlation between the projects, but the variance (or standard deviation) for
a given NPV is quite dependent on the correlation. If all projects are perfectly correlated (+1),
the standard deviation of the NPV at maximum EMV is $950. If the projects are totally inde-
pendent  of  each  other  (unlikely  in  the  oil  industry  because  of  price,  if  nothing  else),  the
standard deviation of NPV at maximum EMV is $519. If the projects are all negatively corre-
lated with correlation coefficients of –0.1, the standard deviation of NPV at maximum EMV is

reduced to $454. This illustrates the power of finding projects that are not correlated with each
other or that have a negative correlation.

If  the  metric  of  risk  is  mean  loss  rather  than  variance,  the  calculations  become  more  te-
dious.  Ball  and  Savage30  discuss  the  methodology  and  give  an  Internet  link  to  a  spreadsheet
with a sample calculation. When their methodology is applied to the example (with the exam-
ple  correlation  matrix),  the  results  are  as  shown  in  Fig.  16.19.  Again,  the  portfolio  with  the
maximum EMV of $1,591 has the highest risk. In this case, however, the decision maker can
reduce  the  risk  from  $277  to  $48  (83%  reduction)  with  only  a  25%  reduction  in  EMV.  The
project selection, using mean loss as a metric of risk, is somewhat different. Now, we would

select 100% of D, 85% of E, 100% of F, 15% of G, and 100% of I. Metrics other than EMV
can be managed as shown by Howell et al. They give an example of a “generic” E&P portfo-
lio in which the metrics include earnings, production, net cash flow, and reserves.

A  portfolio  analysis  has  considerable  value,  but  it  is  not  easy  to  implement.  Not  only  do
we  have  to  establish  parameters  describing  the  uncertainty  on  a  project-by-project  basis,  we
also have to determine the correlations between the various projects, which requires consider-
able skill. On a positive note, the computer capabilities currently available can certainly solve

the problems once they are formulated. As more decision makers become educated in the meth-
ods, it is expected that portfolio analysis will become more common.

16.7.2 Real Options.  In the last quarter-century, financial options such as “calls” and “puts”
on publicly traded stocks have become an integral part of managing stock portfolios. The semi-
nal  work  on  financial  options  was  done  by  Black  and  Scholes,35  published  in  1973,  and
Merton,36  also  published  in  1973.  Merton  and  Scholes  shared  the  1997  Nobel  Prize  in  eco-
nomics for their work. Black, Scholes, and Merton all worked on attempting to determine the
value of an option. In recent years, the concepts of valuing options have been expanded from
financial options to what are called “real” options in project evaluation.

Financial options include “calls” in which the owner of the option has the right, but not the
obligation  (thus,  an  option),  to  purchase  a  stock  at  a  specified  strike  price.  If  the  option  can
only be exercised at the end of a specified period of time, the option is referred to as a Euro-
pean option. If the owner of the option can exercise the option at any time up to the expiration
date,  the  option  is  referred  to  as  an  American  option.  A  financial  put  option  is  the  right,  but
not the obligation, to sell a stock at a specified strike price. Again, there can be European put
options that are exercisable only on a specific date or American put options that can be exer-
cised anytime prior to the expiration date.

The proponents of real options valuation (ROV) or real options analysis (ROA) argue, for
example,  that  “option  pricing  methods  are  superior  to  traditional  DCF  (discounted  cash  flow)
approaches because they explicitly capture the value of flexibility.”37 Copeland and Antikarov38
even go so far as to assert, “…the net present value technique systematically undervalues every-
thing because it fails to capture the value of flexibility.” There is a certain amount of irony in
comparing  the  assertions  of  ROV  proponents  in  which  traditional  methods  undervalue  every-
thing with the assertions of portfolio analysis proponents in which “conventional treatments of

uncertainty  contribute  to  overestimation  of  returns…”  (See  Brashear,  Becker,  and  Faulder,23
page 21.)

There are many types of real options that can be modeled as calls and/or puts or combina-
tions  thereof.  In  the  oil/gas  production  business,  the  option  to  develop  a  field  is  similar  to  a
call option. The producer has the option to invest the development costs and receive the value
of the reserves. An example of a put option is the case in which the producer has the ability to
abandon or sell the property. A property sale differs from a stock put in that the price of the
sale might be unknown, while the exercise price of a stock put is usually known with certainty.
There  are  a  number  of  other  types  of  real  options.  Trigeorgis39  lists  several  types  of  real  op-
tions including the option to defer investment; the option to default during staged construction;
the option to expand; the option to contract; the option to shut down and restart operations; the
option to abandon for salvage value; the option to switch use; and the corporate growth option.
Copeland, Koller, and Murrin (pages 400 through 402) list similar real options along with com-
pound  options,  which  are  options  on  options,  and  “rainbow”  options  in  which  there  are
multiple  sources  of  uncertainty.  As  they  state,  the  exploration  and  development  of  natural  re-
sources is an example of a compound rainbow option. All of these various types of options can
be valued if several parameters are known. The simplest place to begin is with a call option.

The most famous equation in option valuation is the Black-Scholes equation for a European
call  option.  The  following  equations  use  the  algebraic  symbols  of  Black  and  Scholes  rather
than the more modern symbols.

w(x, t) = xN(d1) − cer(t − t * )N(d2), ......................................... (16.11)

........................................ (16.13)

In Eq. 16.11, w(x,t) is the value (at any time, t) of the call option on a stock with a current
price of x. The strike or exercise price is c; the risk-free interest rate is r; the maturity date is
t*;  and  v2  is  the  variance  rate  of  the  return  on  the  stock.  The  variance  is  one  of  the  most
important and interesting parts of the equation. Black and Scholes assume, among other things,
that  “the  distribution  of  possible  stock  prices  at  the  end  of  any  finite  interval  is  log-normal”
and that the stock price on any day is independent of the price on the previous day. This as-
sumption of a “random-walk” in stock price is premised on the existence of an efficient market
in which the stock is fairly valued on any given day, and all the information available concern-
ing the stock has been taken into account by the market.

While  the  Black-Scholes  formula  revolutionized  the  financial  markets,  it  has  had  little  di-
rect application in the oil/gas business because the assumptions used in its development are not
particularly  appropriate  for  oil/gas  properties.  As  Davis*  explains,  “real  options  are  different
from  financial  options  because  the  exercise  price  (in  both  calls  and  puts)  is  not  known  with
certainty;  exercise  is  not  instantaneous;  and  the  stochastic  process  for  the  underlying  asset  is
not  the  same  as  it  is  for  financial  options.  All  of  these  aspects  make  the  calculation  of  real
option value considerably more complicated than calculating the value of a financial option.”

Lohrenz and Dickens40 present a real-world oil/gas example using the Black Scholes formu-
la in their comparison of option theory and discounted cash flow methods for an actual field in
the  offshore  Gulf  of  Mexico.  They  discuss  many  options  that  are  available  during  the  “life-
times of searchable, developable, and producible oil/gas assets.” In their analysis, they showed
that the value of the development option (like a call option on a stock) increased dramatically
(by  a  factor  of  greater  than  3)  as  the  variance  in  the  oil/gas  asset  value  increased  from  zero
(perfect knowledge) to 1.0/year. They end their paper with the warning “…we should always
temper results from uncertainty analyses [both option theory and decision trees] and their use
with the understanding that the real world and its real uncertainties have not been captured—
only  modeled by  necessarily flawed  and  incomplete practice and  practitioners.” Another  good
example  of  the  Black-Scholes  model  is  presented  by  Copeland  and  Antikarov38  (pages  106
through 110).

The  mathematics  and  application  of  real  options  can  quickly  become  very  complex.  The
value  of  the  asset  underlying  the  option  is  assumed  to  vary  in  time  in  a  stochastic  manner.
That means at least part of the price varies in a random and unpredictable fashion. Dixit and
Pindyck41 discuss several potential mathematical models for the price of the asset beginning on
page 59 of their book. The most common of these in financial options is the Wiener or Brown-
ian motion process. In this process, the change in value from one period to the next is assumed
to follow a normal or log-normal distribution. (The standard assumption for stock prices is that
the change in price over time is log-normally distributed.) This process is one of the underly-
ing assumptions in the Black-Scholes model. As Dixit and Pindyck point out, the process has

some interesting properties—one being that all future values depend only on the current value
and not on any historical value. In other words, there is no memory of past prices. One conse-
quence  of  the  assumptions  in  a  Wiener  process,  as  stated  in  Dixit  and  Pindyck  (page  65),  is
that “the variance of the change in a Wiener process grows linearly with the time horizon” and
that  “over  the  long  run  its  variance  will  go  to  infinity.”  This  is  problematical  when  applying
this process to the value of oil/gas properties. There is certainly an upper limit to the value of
an oil/gas property no matter what the time frame. Those who lived through the “boom” in the
late 1970s will remember the commonly accepted forecasts showing average annual oil prices
of $100/barrel or more before the end of the 21st century.

Dixit and Pindyck discuss a number of other potential mathematical models including “Brow-
nian  motion  with  drift”  (a  process  with  an  increasing  or  decreasing  trend  and  randomness
superimposed), “mean-reverting processes,” and jump processes (sometimes called Poisson pro-
cesses). When these processes are applied to value-an-option on an underlying asset of a second-
order  partial  differential  equation  results.  These  equations,  just  like  the  diffusivity  equation
common in fluid flow in porous media, only have analytical solutions for certain simple bound-
ary  conditions  (such  as  those  used  by  Black  and  Scholes).  The  equations  can  be  solved  by  a
number  of  techniques  including  finite  difference  techniques,  as  those  discussed  by  Trigeorgis
(pages  305  through  320)  or  by  a  “binomial  lattice”  technique,  as  discussed  by  Copeland  and
Antikarov  in  Chap.  7  of  their  book  where  they  present  a  spreadsheet  model  for  a  binomial
lattice. Winston42,43 presents a number of examples of valuing options using the Black-Scholes
method and simulation. Winston's book contains a CD with spreadsheets for all examples. Tri-
georgis (pages 320 through 329) presents a log-transformed binomial lattice approach and gives
references to other approaches from polynomial approximation to numerical integration. Pickles
and Smith44 also discuss the binomial lattice method and present a numerical example for pro-
ducing oil/gas properties.

Paddock,  Siegel,  and  Smith45  applied  real  option  valuation  techniques  to  21  tracts  in  the
federal lease sale number 62, held in 1980. This study is also used as an example for oil/gas in
the text by Dixit and Pindyck (pages 396 through 403) and is cited by Trigeorgis as “the first
empirical  evidence  that  option  values  are  better  than  DCF-based  bids  in  valuing  offshore  oil
leases.”

Valuing  a  developed  reserve,  even  at  a  particular  time,  is  quite  difficult.  Paddock,  Siegel,
and Smith used the work of Gruy, Garb, and Wood46 to estimate developed reserve prices as
one-third of crude oil prices. In practice, the value of developed reserves is highly dependent
on the perceptions of future prices, as well as the level of operating costs and the fiscal terms.
Johnston47 (pages 13 and 14) estimates that “proved, developed, producing reserves are worth
from  one-half  to  two-thirds  of  the  wellhead  price  times  the  contractor’s  take.”  The  United
States has a contractor’s take of about 50%, so producing reserves (in this case, working inter-
est  reserves)  would  be  worth  about  one-fourth  to  one-third  of  the  wellhead  price  using
Johnston’s  rule  of  thumb.  If  contractor’s  take  is  lower,  such  as  the  approximately  10%
contractor’s take in  Venezuela, then,  obviously,  the  working  interest reserves  would  be  worth
much less. Data on actual transactions, as reported by Cornerstone Ventures, L.P.48 for the peri-
od of 1991 through 1998, indicate that the median price of U.S. proved developed producing
reserves, in the ground and net of royalty, during that time period ranged from $4.08/bbl to $5.26/
bbl,  while  the  yearly  average  spot  price  of  oil  (WTI)  ranged  from  $14.37/bbl  to  $22.20/bbl.
Table 16.11, from the Cornerstone “Annual Reserves Report,” shows the annual averages for
WTI and the median price for oil-dominated transactions from 1991 to 1998. The ratio of the
median  price  to  the  WTI  price  ranges  from  19  to  28%  with  an  average  of  about  25%.  Pad-
dock, Siegel, and Smith calculate a standard deviation for the “real (CPI deflated) refiner cost
of  imported  crude  oil”  of  0.142/year.  They  then  assumed  that  this  standard  deviation  would
apply  to  the  change  in  value  of  the  underlying  asset  (reserves  in  the  ground).  An  analysis  of

Chapter 16—Petroleum Economics

I-803

the Cornerstone figures indicates that, for the period of 1991 through 1998, the standard devia-
tion  of  the  change in  median acquisition price is  0.15/year on  either a  nominal basis  or  on  a
CPI  adjusted  basis.  This  is  in  remarkable  agreement  with  that  calculated  by  Paddock,  Siegel,
and Smith covering the period of 1974 through 1980. Pickles and Smith calculated a standard
deviation of 0.22/year for the period of 1985 through 1989 based on quarterly median reserve
prices  as  reported  by  Strevig  and  Associates,  the  predecessor  to  Cornerstone  Ventures.  These
values for standard deviation would appear to be in good agreement, but one of the underlying
assumptions is that property prices follow a Wiener or Brownian motion process.

One of the more disconcerting aspects of this assumption is the discussion of the underly-
ing  process  for  oil  prices  as  discussed  by  Dixit  and  Pindyck  (pages  403  through  405).  They
discuss a “unit root test” to determine “whether a price series is mean reverting or is a random
walk.” In their words, “this is a weak test that for short time series (for example, 30 years or
less) will often fail to reject the hypothesis of a random walk, even if the series is in fact mean
reverting.” Considering the different processes underlying the price of oil/gas such as the Texas
Railroad  Commission  in  the  1950s  and  1960s,  the  rise  of  OPEC’s  power  in  the  1970s,  the
Federal  Power  Commission’s  regulation  of  natural  gas  prices—all  overlying  the  fundamental
supply  and  demand  relationship,  it  is  difficult  to  imagine  a  meaningful  process  lasting  much
longer  than  30  years.  Dixit  and  Pindyck  report  that  Wey*  used  a  100-year  series  for  the  real
price of crude oil and found that oil prices are mean reverting and not a random walk. They
report that Wey shows “ignoring mean reversion can lead one to undervalue the reserve by 40
percent or more” when the development cost in $/bbl is one-half the mean developed reserve
price, while  it  will  have  little effect when  the  development cost  is  close  to  the  developed re-
serve price.

Chorn  and  Carr49  discuss  option  pricing  principles  and  then  apply  those  principles  to  the
purchase of information. Their advice is to “purchase information that will impact the upcom-
ing  decisions,  if  the  value  increase  justifies  the  cost  of  the  information.  Secondly,  adhere
rigorously to the converse, i.e., invest now or abandon the project if there is no information to
be  gained  (or  it’s  [sic]  expense  is  too  great)  that  will  significantly  change  the  project’s  out-
come  or  impact  the  investment  decision  process.”  This  is  sound  advice  with  or  without  real
option analysis, but they show how real options can be used to value that information—a value
which is often difficult to quantify.

Davidson50  presented  an  excellent  paper  on  benefits  and  difficulties  with  real  options.  He
states  that  “the  primary  contribution  of  ROA  is  to  produce  a  frame  shift.  Instead  of  thinking

about a project from a do-it or don’t-do-it frame, ROA promotes thinking from a what-are-all-
the-possibilities  frame.  The  frame  shift  leads  to  a  richer  assessment  of  the  opportunity.”  He
criticizes the approach by stating that “the ROA valuation methodology is not only inaccurate
for E&P projects, it is needlessly complicated. The methodology leads to procedures and pre-
sentations  that  can  inhibit  insightful  discussions  for  key  assumptions  and  choices.”  He  then
presents a method of getting the benefits of both real options analysis and present value analy-
sis.  Hooper  and  Rutherford51  also  discuss  the  benefits  of  real  options  in  framing  the  problem
and the questions.

Real  options  analysis  is  slowly  working  its  way  into  the  E&P  business.  The  mathematics
are daunting; the terminology is foreign; the underlying assumptions are shaky; and communi-
cating  the  results  in  an  easily  understood  manner  is  difficult,  but  the  method  does  show
promise. The breach between the theoreticians and the practitioners in the E&P business needs
to  be  bridged.  This  breach  is  well  illustrated  by  the  following  quote  from  Copeland  and
Antikarov’s practitioner’s guide38 (page 164) in which they discuss compound options. “Explo-
ration  and  development  for  natural  resources  (oil,  natural  gas,  gold,  copper,  and  coal)  have
multiple  phases.  Oil,  for  example,  has  sonic  testing  [sic]  (2D  and  3D),  drilling,  and  develop-
ment  via  construction  of  refineries  [sic],  pipelines,  and  storage  facilities.”  On  the  other  hand,
the frame shift mentioned by Davidson and Hooper and Rutherford is a real benefit. It remains
to be seen how widely the process will be applied. In his book, Trigeorgis (page 375) lists ten
points of future research. The first two (listed next) are very relevant.

• Analyzing  more  actual  case  applications  and  tackling  real-life  implementation  issues  and

problems in more practical detail.

• Developing generic options-based user-friendly software packages with simulation capabil-

ities that can handle multiple real options as a practical aid to corporate planners.
If these points are done, along with educating the managers, real options could become a use-
ful tool.

17.1 Introduction
The  search  for  petroleum  drives  oil  and  gas  companies  from  the  familiar  confines  of  their
home countries out into the world. The worldwide scope of the exploration for the production
of oil and gas has led to the rise of international and multinational petroleum companies—com-
panies  that  are  nominally  based  in  a  home  country  but  operate  throughout  the  world.  Today,
almost all major oil companies have a presence in most oil-producing regions, and many mid-
size and smaller petroleum companies operate in more than one country.

Each host country has its own specific laws and regulations that apply to oil and gas devel-
opment in that country. Still, it is possible to describe some common approaches and concepts
that apply to international petroleum law. The United States has also passed certain laws that
apply  to  the  international  operations  of  U.S.  companies.  This  chapter  describes  some  of  the
legal issues affecting international oil and gas development, as well as the laws that will apply
to U.S. companies operating internationally.

17.2 History of International Oil and Gas Development
Petroleum has been an internationally traded commodity since the late 1800s. International oil
and gas development paralleled domestic development in the United States in the 1900s. In the
early 1900s, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey held a near-monopoly on domestic oil sup-
ply and price. Specific judicial and legislative action by the United States government caused
this  monopoly  to  break  up,  and  various  large,  integrated  oil  companies  were  formed,  which
participated in all petroleum industry segments from exploration to marketing. These major com-
panies  sought  mineral  development  opportunities  both  domestically  and  abroad.  At  the  same
time,  European  oil  companies  also  sought  to  capitalize  on  mineral  development  opportunities
beyond  their  borders.1  (For  a  highly  readable  account  on  the  history  of  the  international
petroleum industry, see Ref. 1.)

Initially,  these  major  companies,  from  the  United  States  and  Europe,  sought  rights  in  oil
from countries in the Middle East by means of concessions, which authorized the company to
explore,  develop,  and  market  the  oil  from  certain  lands  for  a  specified  period  of  time.  The
concession area might have covered the entire country, such as Abu Dhabi or Kuwait; the con-
cession  period  could  have  lasted decades,  such  as  75  years  for  Abu  Dhabi  and  Kuwait  or  66

I-810

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

years  for  Saudi  Arabia;  the  concession  might  not  have  contained  development  obligations,  as
the concession might have been viewed as a transfer of the mineral rights for a term of years;
and the developing company might have had unilateral control over all management and deci-
sions  associated  with  the  concession.2  These  concessions  were  granted  by  the  government  or
sovereign of the host country, who was often subject to strong internal or foreign political pres-
sures. In exchange for granting the concession, the host country typically received an initial or
bonus payment and a right to some fractional share of, or a royalty interest in the value of, the
oil produced. In these early development years, produced natural gas was generally considered
a waste byproduct and was vented or flared.

Although some host countries may have only granted limited or relatively short-lived con-
cession agreements, others granted broadly scoped rights, which left the host country with little
control  over  what  might  have  been  that  country’s  most  valuable  single  asset.  In  an  effort  to
regain  control  over  their  mineral  resources,  countries  such  as  Mexico,  Saudi  Arabia,  and  Iran
resorted to expropriation and nationalization of the petroleum rights by Pemex, Saudi Aramco,
and the national oil company of Iran, respectively. Other countries in the Middle East modified
their  concessions  through  renegotiated  agreements  to  significantly  change  the  balance  of  con-
trol over the mineral rights. In 1960, the formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), an entity that represents the interests of numerous similarly situated oil ex-
porting  countries,  helped  facilitate  further  changes  in  contract  rights  and  royalty  benefits
enjoyed by the member countries.

Today, the term “concession” has lost favor, as it implies that rights might have been con-
ceded  or  given  away,  and  some  host  country  citizens  might  have  considered  their  rights  and
interests  to  have  been  abused  by  the  developing  companies.  Most  host  countries  now  issue
licenses or leases similar in nature to those used in the United States, covering defined areas or
“blocks” and allowing the host country a significantly greater amount of direct participation in
the  decisions  affecting,  and  the  capital  costs  associated  with  development  of,  its  natural  re-
sources.  The  license  or  lease  might  be  a  nonexclusive  right  to  conduct  exploration  operations
or an exclusive right to conduct development and production operations. The developing com-
pany is commonly obligated to a yearly capital commitment, an established work program, and
the relinquishment of undeveloped lands after a specified primary term. There may be multiple
bonus payments at various development thresholds, the royalty percentage due the host country
might  vary  based  on  production  volumes  and  cost  recovery  factors,  and  the  foreign  company
could  be  subject  to  various  local  taxes.  Many  countries  have  formed  national  oil  companies
that may have the right to participate for up to a 51% ownership share under licenses, or those
countries may form a joint operating company with the developing company to be the licensee.
Alternatively,  host  countries  may  enter  into  “service  agreements,”  which  allow  a  foreign
company to develop the petroleum resources in a specified area for a specified consideration,
typically  in  the  form  of  a  share  of  the  production  stream  taken  in  kind  by  the  host  country.
Although the developing company bears all the financial risk, the host country generally does
not  transfer  any  mineral  or  property  rights  to  the  developing  company,  and  the  host  country
controls  the  development  of  its  lands  at  the  developing  company’s  expense.  These  types  of
service contracts are common in countries such as Mexico, where there is a constitutional pro-
hibition against the disposal of any of the national petroleum rights retained by the host country.
Today, produced natural gas has now evolved into a highly desirable commodity, particular-
ly in areas accessed by gas transportation pipelines or liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing
and transportation facilities. Today’s international petroleum development agreements, whether
in the form of licenses or service contracts, address the value attributable to natural gas and the
obligations for its development and marketing.

17.3 Interests in Petroleum Properties
Over  the  years,  host  countries  seeking  the  development  of  their  natural  resources  have  devel-
oped  a  variety  of  contractual  and  legal  mechanisms  to  promote  exploration  and  production.
These approaches to the creation of interests in mineral development can be divided into four
general categories: concessions and licenses, production sharing agreements, participation agree-
ments, and service contracts.2,3

17.3.1 Concessions and Licenses.  Some host countries grant mineral developers the exclusive
right to explore, develop, and produce from petroleum properties. Such rights were first grant-
ed  in  the  form  of  concessions.  In  their  earliest  form,  concessions  were  granted  by  host
countries to cover large areas and, sometimes, entire countries. The mineral developer had the
unfettered right to explore or develop as it saw fit, and the host country retained only a royalty
interest in the produced petroleum.

These  broad  concessions  were  seen  to  reserve  too  little  control  and  revenue  for  the  host
country and are no longer used. Despite the demise of the early concessions, many countries,
however,  still  grant  oil  producers  exclusive  rights  to  explore  or  develop  petroleum  properties,
either  through  a  more  limited  concession  or  a  licensing  process.  Under  either  approach,  the
mineral title remains with the host country or its national oil company, and the development of
the mineral resource is permissive. The title to oil and gas typically passes at the wellhead.

Unlike  the  broad  grants  of  the  first  concessions,  a  modern  concession  or  license  typically
covers a specific area or mineral property. If the area is not yet producing, the licensee will be
required  to  conduct  a  work  program,  typically  consisting  of  gathering  or  processing  seismic
data  and  drilling  exploratory  wells.  A  licensee  is  now  required  to  relinquish  areas  within  the
license  that  are  not  explored  or  developed.  Concessions  and  licenses  typically  run  for  a  set
number of years, subject to renewal if certain requirements are met.

Many of the original concessions were negotiated in the Middle East and North Africa, and
some  countries  in  these  areas  still  offer  concessions  to  petroleum  developers.  In  Tunisia,  for
example, a producer may begin exploration under a research permit, which defines the area to
be explored. This area can be granted as a concession, which requires a decree from the rele-
vant  ministry  and  the  passage  of  a  law  by  the  Tunisian  legislature.  The  concession  might  be
withdrawn should the concession holder interrupt production or fail to pay the required royalties.
Licensing arrangements were developed after the advent and collapse of the earliest conces-
sions.  Under  a  licensing  arrangement,  the  host  country  retains  ownership  and  control  of
petroleum  in  place  and  grants  the  licensee  the  right  to  explore  for  and  develop  that  resource.
Licenses  are  used,  for  example,  throughout  the  North  Sea,  and  have  been  used  in  the  United
Kingdom  since  the  1960s.  In  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry
(DTI)  selects  tracts  that  it  will  offer  in  a  licensing  round.  Any  license  awarded  in  that  round
will be governed by a standard form agreement, The Model License, which sets out the stan-
dard terms for the license. Prospective developers then submit proposed work programs for an
area  to  be  licensed.  DTI  then  chooses  the  work  program  and  licensee  it  wants  to  develop  a
specific area. The DTI may not award a license to the highest bidder, but rather looks to man-
age  the  development  of  resources  in  the  U.K.  continental  shelf  in  the  manner  most  advanta-
geous to the host country.

The  imposition  of  a  work  program  has  significant  benefits  for  the  host  country,  as  it  as-
sures  that  its  natural  resources  will  be  developed  promptly.  Even  if  an  exploratory  drilling
program  is  unsuccessful,  the  results  of  seismic  surveys,  seismic  analysis,  and  exploration
drilling conducted throughout a country and its offshore areas will help the host country better
define its mineral resources. In many circumstances, a petroleum producer will win a conces-
sion, license, or other mineral development right by bidding for the property with an extensive
work  commitment.  This  commitment  can,  however,  lead  to  uneconomic  results.  A  company
might, for example, commit to conduct seismic surveys and drill two exploratory wells as part

I-812

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

of a licensing bid. If, after analyzing the seismic data and drilling the first hole, the company
doubts  the  prospectivity  of  the  license  area,  it  is  nonetheless  committed  to  drill  an  additional
well. A company may be loath to spend its exploration budget on a second well in a license
area at that point. Mineral developers can negotiate alternatives to work program commitments
in some circumstances.

In summary, a host country that uses a concession or license to promote mineral develop-
ment  grants  the  licensee  or  concessionaire  an  exclusive  right  to  develop  a  specific  area.  That
right is gained through certain commitments—e.g., to conduct a work program or to pay royalty
—and can be lost if those commitments are not kept. As the area approaches production, the
licensee may be required to relinquish portions of the license area that are outside the produc-
ing structure.

17.3.2 Production Sharing Agreements.  The  production  sharing  agreement  was  first  devel-
oped  in  Indonesia  in  the  1960s.  Production  sharing  arrangements  are  common  throughout  the
world and are often favored by countries that lack the financial or technical capability to devel-
op mineral resources. In a production sharing arrangement, the oil producer gains the right to
conduct exploration and assumes the entire risk of exploration failure.

If, however, the developing company succeeds in finding petroleum and developing the re-
source, the host country takes a share of the oil produced. The developing company is allowed
to  retain  some  petroleum  as  reimbursement  for  its  development  costs  (the  “cost  share”)  and
then receives a portion of the produced oil as its profit (the “profit share”). The host country
typically retains the greater portion of produced petroleum, and many modern production-shar-
ing  agreements  use  a  sliding  scale,  with  the  host  country’s  pro  rata  share  increasing  as  more
oil  is  produced.  While  the  host  country  often  takes  the  largest  percentage  of  production,  the
terms can vary significantly, even within a country. Indonesia, for example, recognizes the cost
and risk of development in “frontier areas” and awards contractors a higher percentage of the
gross revenue from gas sales in those areas.

Because  the  host  country  is  a  beneficiary  of  the  production  from  a  property  subject  to  a
production sharing agreement, some agreements provide for tax relief. This relief may come in
the form of a straightforward tax amnesty (perhaps limited in its duration) or through an obliga-
tion  upon  the  host  country  to  pay  any  taxes.  The  host  country  may  also  take  a  role  in  the
management  of  the  project.  Many  production-sharing  arrangements  require  the  host  country’s
national oil company to operate the field.

17.3.3 Participation Agreements.  In participation agreements, petroleum properties are devel-
oped through a joint venture or similar arrangement between the host country and the develop-
ing  company.  In  some  instances,  the  host  country  and  the  developing  company  will  create  a
new entity to be jointly owned. Other times, the host country and the developing company will
create a contractual joint arrangement. The distinguishing characteristic of a participation agree-
ment, in any event, is the cooperative development of petroleum properties by the host country
and the developing company.

The  joint  entity  or  venture  will  be  managed  by  both  the  host  country  and  the  developing
company, but management control may be tilted toward one side or the other. Some participa-
tion agreements provide for the developing company to carry the host country financially, and
fund exploration costs, for example. The developing company is then allowed to recoup these
costs from future production.

17.3.4 Service Agreements.  In  some  countries,  the  right  to  develop  petroleum  resources  has
been granted exclusively to a national oil company. In these countries, mineral developers enter
into  service  agreements  with  the  national  oil  company.  The  developing  company  might,  for
example, simply conduct drilling programs or build facilities in return for a fee. The contractor

Chapter 17—International Oil and Gas Law

I-813

then has no legal interest in the mineral property. Some service agreements allow the contrac-
tor  to  purchase  and  export  produced  petroleum,  although  these  arrangements  are  often  tied  to
the assumption of some exploration risk by the contractor. Some service companies take equity
stakes in international petroleum projects, and, thus, the line between service arrangements and
other  mineral  development  arrangements  can  be  blurred.4  Some  large  developing  companies
disfavor service arrangements, as they wish to have an interest in the mineral property itself.

Mexico is an example of a host country that uses service contracts. Article 27 of the 1917
Constitution of Mexico, as amended 10 January 1934, grants the Mexican nation direct owner-
ship of all hydrocarbons. In early December 2001, Mexico’s “Multiple Services Contract” law
and regulations were released in an effort to attract foreign developing companies to participate
in exploration and production of Mexico’s petroleum resources. Service contractors are paid in
cash—not oil—and, therefore, will not be able to book reserves.

17.3.5 Common  Contractual  Provisions.    Because  the  various  mineral  development  agree-
ments  previously  discussed  are  drafted  by  the  host  country,  they  tend  to  have  provisions
designed to protect host country interests or promote host country policies. The scope and na-
ture of these provisions will vary from country to country and between the common types of
mineral  development  agreements.  Nonetheless,  many  mineral  development  contracts  will  in-
clude at least some of the following contractual requirements.

Training.  Many contracts require the developing company to provide training to local work-
ers  or  employees  of  the  national  oil  company.  The  training  obligation  may  be  described  with
some particularity, but it is common for the obligation to come in the form of a fixed annual
commitment for training expenses.

Local Labor and Services.  Petroleum development contracts often require the mineral devel-
oper to use local labor, unless special skills are required, and to contract for services with local
contractors. In some countries, there are companies owned by or affiliated with the host coun-
try or the national oil company that provide oilfield services. The mineral developer might be
required to contract with that particular company, as opposed to a more general obligation to
use local contractors. If the company uses expatriate personnel, the petroleum development ar-
rangements may place limits on the number of expatriates, their roles and duties, and even the
types of property that they can bring into the country.

Domestic Marketing Obligation.  Some  contracts  require  the  petroleum  producer  to  sell  a
specified percentage of its production in the domestic market. Under a production sharing con-
tract, this domestic marketing obligation (DMO) might apply to the share left to the developing
company after it has provided the host country with its share of production, thereby creating an
even greater financial burden on the production from the mineral property. A DMO can have
significant adverse effects on the economics of a mineral property, especially if the market for
natural gas or oil is weak in the host country or if the payment for the domestically delivered
petroleum is not in convertible currency. Also, a DMO might require the company to sell oil
or gas into the domestic market at a discount to international open market prices.

Data.    Some  mineral  development  agreements  require  developing  companies  to  provide
copies  of  data,  such  as  seismic  surveys  and  drilling  results,  to  the  host  country.  Other  agree-
ments vest ownership of the data in the host country and provide a license to the oil company
to use the data so long as the company maintains its concession, license, or contract in good
standing.

Local Office and Local Agent.  A contract or license may require the developing company
to maintain a local office and to hire local residents to staff that office. Some mineral develop-
ment arrangements require the developing company to be represented by a local agent.

Choice of Law.  Many international petroleum agreements between mineral developers and
host  countries  require  that  the  contract  be  governed  by  the  laws  of  the  host  country.  As  dis-

I-814

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

cussed in Sec. 17.8, the use of an arbitration provision can help manage some of the adverse
effects of the application of local law.

Assignment and Transfer Limitations.  Mineral development agreements commonly require
some sort of host country approval before all or part of a mineral interest can be transferred to
a third party. These limitations can be significant, as petroleum developers often like to bring
in partners to share the expense and risk of mineral development. In some cases, assignments
or transfers can be approved by a ministry or department of the government (or perhaps a few
such  ministries).  In  the  worst  case,  a  transfer  may  require  legislative  approval,  which  can  be
difficult to achieve and very time consuming. Such approvals also often require publication or
notice periods before they are official, which creates an additional element of risk in a commer-
cial assignment of a mineral interest in a host country.

Equipment.    Some  development  arrangements  require  the  operator  to  transfer  equipment
used in mineral development to the host country or to its national oil company. The arrange-
ments also typically place most of the burden of abandonment costs on the mineral developer,
although the extent of that cost shift can vary.

Insurance.  Many mineral development agreements require the operating company to carry
insurance,  and  these  clauses  typically  dictate  that  the  insurance  comply  with  host  country  re-
quirements.

Management.  Oil and gas development arrangements sometimes create a management role
for  the  host  country  or  its  representatives.  In  a  licensing  arrangement  like  that  in  the  United
Kingdom,  the  government  does  not  have  a  direct  management  role  in  field  operations,  but
rather governs that development through regulations and license requirements. In other circum-
stances,  such  as  the  Indonesian  production-sharing  contract,  the  national  oil  company  is  the
operator of the field and has significant management authority. Other arrangements adopt more
moderate approaches. In Romania, for example, the standard Exploration and Production Shar-
ing Agreement creates a Management Committee to govern field operations, and the seats are
held  equally  by  the  national  oil  company  and  the  producing  companies.  Committees  such  as
this  are  commonly  chaired  by  a  host  country  governmental  representative.  If  the  management
committee  is  responsible  for  approving  budgets  and  annual  work  programs,  the  host  country
can gain considerable influence over operations in this manner. Also, some petroleum develop-
ment  arrangements  require  government  approval  of  the  operator  of  a  field.  This  requirement
can also hinder the free transfer of mineral interests.

Foreign Exchange and Banking.  The  petroleum  development  agreement  may  require  the
foreign  developer  to  open  and  fund  a  local  bank  account.  The  agreement  or  local  law  may
limit the ability of the company to convert local currency to other currency and might require
that  a  local  bank  make  the  conversion.  As  noted,  the  foreign  mineral  developer  may  be  re-
quired to receive some payments in local currency.

17.4 Considerations in Conducting Operations in International Projects
There are many complex considerations that must be addressed in each relationship between a
host  country  and  a  foreign  oil  company.  (For  a  general  discussion  of  due  diligence  issues  in
international  projects,  see  Ref.  5.)  The  foreign  oil  company  must  recognize  and  adjust  to  the
existence of the sovereign power of the host country and assume the political risk that its inter-
ests and investments might be expropriated, with or without compensation; that the government
might  be  overthrown;  or  that  significant  security  might  be  necessary  to  protect  the  foreign
company’s employees and assets. The foreign company must recognize that there is an increas-
ing  awareness  by  host  countries  of  the  need  to  conserve  and  protect  the  environment  and  to
train  its  citizens  to  be  skilled  and  competent  in  the  industry.  The  foreign  oil  company  must
remain  aware  that  relationships  with  host  country  officials  should  not  involve  bribery,  favors,
preferences, or other illegal actions. Many of these considerations are discussed in greater detail.

Chapter 17—International Oil and Gas Law

I-815

17.4.1 Political Risk.  There are many risks associated with an international oil and gas devel-
opment project. The modern commercial reality is that almost every development project will
require capitalization and financing, with associated risks and obligations dictated by third par-
ties who are outside the control of the company proposing the international project. Other risks
include whether the project will be completed on time and within the anticipated budget. Fur-
ther, there is the risk that the project, once completed, fails to perform as projected, or that the
anticipated  product  markets  do  not  evolve  or  that  product  prices  do  not  reach  the  anticipated
levels. To some degree, each of these risks can be managed by contractual protections. Certain
risks cannot be controlled by such protections, however, and they include the political risks of
expropriation, inconvertibility of currency, and political unrest.

Expropriation  can  include  the  outright  nationalization  of  a  developing  company’s  projects,
such  as  occurred  in  Mexico  and  Iran.  Expropriation  can  occur  by  gradual  nationalization
through  host  country  taxation  or  project  participation.  Expropriation  can  also  occur  indirectly
by the refusal or mere failure, either through a lack of attention or by willful delay, on the part
of  the  host  country  government,  to  issue  required  approvals  or  consents  for  development
projects. This process is sometimes referred to as “creeping expropriation.”

Currency risks arise when a project is financed in one currency and the resulting petroleum
production is sold domestically in a different currency. If the currency standards between these
differing markets erode or shift owing to various political and economic factors, the profitabili-
ty  or  financial  stability  of  a  project  can  be  abruptly  undermined  even  though  the  accounting
figures show the project to be on budget.

Political unrest can exist in violent circumstances such as wars, insurrections, or riots. Po-
tentially  more  devastating,  however,  is  the  political  unrest  that  arises  when  well-conceived
projects and contracts cannot be enforced under applicable laws. Before investing in any host
country,  the  developing  company  must  evaluate  the  certainty,  predictability  and  enforceability
of any contract or relationship with a host country. Certainty can be evidenced by a long-stand-
ing  constitution,  well-established  laws,  and  a  reliable  governing  body.  Predictability  is  evi-
denced by the host country’s governmental application of its law in a manner that is consistent,
evenhanded, and objective. There is little point in investing large amounts of money and time
in  a  development  project  if  the  developing  company  has  no  means  of  ensuring  that  the  host
country government can either be required by a court to perform its obligations under the appli-
cable contracts or to pay adequate compensatory damages.

Developing  companies  can  mitigate  political  risks  by  obtaining  financing  through  export
credit agencies such as the U.S. Export/Import Bank and by obtaining political risk insurance
from private companies or from quasigovernmental entities such as the Overseas Private Invest-
ment Corporation of the United States or the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, which
is a member of the World Bank Group. Host countries that do not have established or predica-
ble  ownership  laws  or  procedures  for  enforcing  rights,  such  as  countries  emerging  from
military dictatorships to market economies, pose special problems for insurers and for lenders
seeking  to  protect  their  funds  through  mortgages  or  other  liens  on  the  producing  lands.  As  a
consequence, export credit agencies might impose strict limitations on the availability of financ-
ing and could impose stringent insurance coverage requirements. Political risk insurance can be
expensive,  and  its  coverage  can  be  limited  in  scope  to  only  certain  events  or  risks  such  as
expropriation, unavailability of foreign exchange, and war. On the other hand, these credit and
insurance agencies will likely be committed to work with the host country government to bring
political pressure to bear in order to protect their financial investments.

Other methods to mitigate political risk include joint venturing with host country nationals,
good corporate citizenship in the host country, and contractual assurances from the host coun-
try in the mineral development agreement. Typical contractual assurances address the stability
of  the  legal  regime,  waiver  of  sovereign  immunity,  effective  dispute  resolution  in  a  neutral

I-816

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

forum, and the selection of a governing law that is consistent with the expectations of the par-
ties.  The  developing  company  should  seek  for  stability  in  the  legal  regime,  including  assur-
ances  that  the  government  will  not  unilaterally  modify  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the
investment or change the tax or participation structure to the detriment of the developing com-
pany.  A  waiver  of  sovereign  immunity  will  not  only  allow  a  developing  company  to  force  a
host country to a legal forum, but it will also prevent the government of the host country from
changing its laws to the detriment of the developing company.

Host countries generally will want contracts involving their government to be governed by
the law of the host country and will want any dispute regarding those contracts to be resolved
in  courts  located  within  the  host  country.  Similarly,  the  developing  companies  tend  to  prefer
the laws and courts of their respective countries. A reasonable compromise is to choose a neu-
tral forum and governing law. Choice of law provisions are generally upheld so long as there
is a reasonable connection between the transaction involved and the jurisdiction whose law is
selected,  and  there  is  no  evidence  of  unfair  advantage  from  an  equal  bargaining  perspective.
Further discussion regarding choice of law and forums for dispute resolution can be found in
Sec. 17.8.

17.4.2 Security.  Another form of political risk includes physical risks to employees and assets
of the developing company by terrorism, kidnapping, or physical abuse. Developing companies
typically have substantial financial and manpower commitments for the security of employees
and assets. Fenced compounds, security cameras, and guards may be necessary to protect plant
sites, equipment sites, well sites, storage yards, offices, and company employees located there-
in. “Company towns” help manage the interaction of the developing company employees with
host company nationals in a controlled environment. Automobile drivers and bodyguards may
be necessary to ensure the physical protection of company employees and their families outside
these controlled environments. Also, some insurers offer kidnapping insurance to help mitigate
that risk.

17.4.3 Bribery  and  Corruption.    Bribery  has  many  different,  but  similar,  definitions.  Some
common definitions include: offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting something of value for the
purpose  of  influencing  the  action  of  an  official  in  the  discharge  of  his  or  her  official  duties;
money  or  favor  given  or  promised  to  a  person  in  a  position  of  trust  to  influence  his  or  her
judgment or conduct; something that serves to induce or influence; and an advantage that one
competitor secures over other competitors by secret and/or corrupt dealings.

There is generally little debate that bribery is unethical, but the determination of what con-
stitutes  bribery  can  be  hotly  contested.  What  might  be  business  courtesies  such  as  gifts  or
favors, consistent with local custom or practice, to some may be construed as a business induce-
ment,  bribery,  or  commercial  influence  that  might  or  might  not  be  considered  unethical  or
illegal depending on the country where the business is conducted.

In  1977,  the  United  States  enacted  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (FCPA)  to  impose
severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment, on companies and personnel who bribe or
otherwise  attempt  to  influence  officials  of  a  host  country.  Almost  all  countries  have  adopted
similar laws, but until recently, such laws might not have been strictly enforced, and in some
host  countries,  it  may  continue  to  be  an  accepted  practice  to  provide  favors  to  governmental
officials in return for special treatment.

The  FCPA  was  enacted  in  response  to  embarrassing  public  disclosures  of  payments  made
by  prominent  U.S.  companies  to  political  officials  in  several  countries  to  secure  large  orders
for military equipment, where foreign government officials might have requested or suggested
some special consideration in return for favorable purchase contracts. The breadth of the FCPA
covers other overseas business opportunities including the oil and gas industry. Competition for
exploration  and  production  rights  creates  many  potential  FCPA  problems  for  U.S.  companies

Chapter 17—International Oil and Gas Law

I-817

conducting business abroad. Commonly, foreign investment laws impose limits on foreign own-
ership,  which  then  requires  the  developing  company  to  establish  some  form  of  a  partnership
with a company located in the host country. Government officials who could delay or prevent
the  award  of  exploration  or  production  rights  might  feel  less  inclined  to  do  so  if  they  were
“comfortable” with the developing company and its local partner by the suggestion or expecta-
tion of some form of inducement or payment.

The FCPA attempts to prevent corrupt practices by two methods: by mandating accounting
standards for public companies, and by prohibiting payments from public companies to foreign
political officials with knowledge of a corrupt purpose. Compliance with the accounting stan-
dards under the FCPA is monitored by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Enforcement
of the FCPA falls under the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Justice.

A  public  company  is  one  that  has  registered  securities  or  that  files  reports  in  accordance
with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the FCPA, public companies are required to
maintain  books  and  records  in  such  a  way  that  corrupt  payments  cannot  be  hidden  within  a
company’s  accounting  system.  The  books  and  records  must  be  kept  in  reasonable  detail  and
must  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  disposition  of  assets  of  the  company.
The FCPA also precludes senior management of a public company from avoiding responsibility
if  corrupt  payments  are  made.  The  transactions  of  the  company  must  be  executed  in  accor-
dance with authorizations by the company’s management. Foreign subsidiaries of public compa-
nies must also comply with these requirements. Foreign affiliates that are owned 50 percent or
less  by  the  public  company  are  only  required  to  make  “a  good  faith  attempt”  to  cause  the
affiliate to follow the accounting standards.

The FCPA antibribery provisions make it unlawful for public companies or any sharehold-
er,  officer,  director,  employee,  or  agent  thereof  to:  make  use  of  the  mails  or  other  forms  of
interstate commerce corruptly in the furtherance of an offer, payment, promise or authorization
of payment; support any foreign official, political party, or candidate for political office; influ-
ence any act or decision of that official or inducing that official to use influence to affect or
influence any act of a foreign government or agency; assist a public company in directing busi-
ness  to  any  person  or  in  obtaining  or  retaining  business  with  any  person.  Each  of  these
elements must be satisfied in order for a violation of the FCPA to exist. The fundamental no-
tion  of  when  an  act  is  done  corruptly  can  be  difficult  to  determine.  It  is  apparent,  however,
that a payment is corrupt if it is tendered with the intent to influence the recipient to misuse
his or her official position to divert or obtain business wrongfully.6

Retaining a local influential person or agent to help secure a foreign contract is not a viola-
tion  of  the  FCPA  but  rather  might  be  a  necessary  reality  in  order  to  secure  the  contract.
Corporate legal advisers are available to examine the facts and the relevant law to determine if
an FCPA violation has or will occur. Some factors to be considered include determining if the
host country has a reputation for bribery; if the agent’s commission is excessive or if it will be
paid in cash; if the agent is related to a government official or if the government official has
any ownership relationship with the agent; if it is illegal under the local law for the agent to
act as an agent; if the agent has made statements suggesting that a particular amount of money
is needed to secure the business opportunity; if the agent has suggested that any kind of false
documentation be used; if the agent has refused to promise in writing to abide by the FCPA.7

Although  other  countries  generally  have  not  followed  the  United  States  by  enacting  laws
similar to the FCPA to penalize corrupt payments made to government officials to secure busi-
ness  opportunities,  the  developing  oil  company  should  also  keep  in  mind  that  many  host
countries have enacted laws to prevent such payments, and any of the actions previously dis-
cussed could result in a violation of the host country’s laws in addition to the FCPA.

17.4.4 Indigenous Rights.  In a standard oil and gas lease in the United States, a large corpo-
rate  or  sophisticated  landowner  might  sometimes  be  in  a  position  of  negotiating  strength  to

I-818

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

obtain lease provisions that limit or require certain activities occurring on the leased lands. It is
rare for this control, however, to include proactive involvement, such as requiring the lessee to
conduct  certain  operations.  The  large  corporation  or  landowner  rarely  has  any  power  greater
than a veto right. International contracts, however, have a completely different balance of power
—one that includes the obligation of integrating individuals in the management and labor force
necessary to complete the project.

Host  governments  typically  can  exercise  a  considerable  amount  of  control  over  all  opera-
tions within the contract area. This control is commonly exercised through a body known as a
joint management committee (JMC). A JMC is typically composed of representatives from the
host country government and from the developing company. These representatives meet regular-
ly in open sessions where minutes and approvals are recorded. JMC approvals range from the
mundane issues of work programs and budgets to far-reaching and substantial issues affecting
the  project  and  the  investment  by  the  developing  company.  If  the  host  country  governmental
representatives are not educated or experienced in the various subject matters addressed by the
JMC, experts are routinely retained to advise the host country representatives. These host coun-
try representative positions create a substantial amount of goodwill and are prestigious for the
local individual but can be a large financial expense for the developing company.

Another typical requirement of host countries dictates the use of local personnel and materi-
als to perform the operations associated with the project. These provisions are rigidly applied
and  seriously  monitored by  host  country  governments. The  requirement to  use  local materials
and  labor  is  commonly  applied  and  administered  through  the  procurement  provisions  of  the
mineral development agreement. JMC procurement personnel will play an active role in ensur-
ing  that  local  people  are  employed  and  service  and  supply  contracts  are  given  to  local
companies.  Procurement  requirements  can  raise  quality  concerns  for  the  developing  company,
as it may fear it will be forced to use local companies or materials that are not suited for the
intended job only because the local service or supply company owners are well connected with
the  host  country  government.  The  requirement  for  the  use  of  local  labor  and  supplies  is  so
important to the host country, however, that the developing company must accept the inevitable
and learn to work within the local system.

The  salvage  rights  of  a  host  country  also  can  be  burdensome  for  a  developing  company,
particularly after considering the large investment cost of any development project. Host coun-
tries  typically  mandate  that  once  a  project  reaches  its  economic  life,  all  equipment  and
materials  used  in  connection  with  the  project  will  become  the  property  of  the  host  country,
without any salvage value or consideration given to the developing company. This requirement
can  even  apply  to  indirect  materials  and  equipment  used  on  the  project  such  as  boats,  air-
planes, helicopters, automobiles, seismic equipment, electronic equipment, and computers.

In addition to the objective of increasing production of petroleum from within its country,
another  main  objective  of  host  country  governments  is  to  obtain  training  of  its  nationals  to
perform necessary duties and to potentially take over the operation of projects within the bor-
ders of the country.

17.4.5 Training Obligations.  Each work program of a mineral development agreement with a
host  country  will  include  a  training  budget.  These  training  obligations  can  be  substantial  and
range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars on an annual basis. Important positions
associated with the project that are staffed by the developing company are typically “seconded”
early in the program with local trainees. This involves putting employees from the host country
into operational positions for training under the developing company, while these “secondees”
remain as employees of the national oil company. The developing company will be responsible
for paying the secondees a salary and benefits comparable to that of the developing company’s
staff.

17.4.6 Necessary  Relationships  for  Efficient  and  Economic  Development.    The  cost  of  a
large  foreign  development  can  be  so  substantial  that  one  developing  company  alone  may  not
want  to  take  on  the  risks,  costs,  or  liabilities.  Consequently,  in  addition  to  the  relationships
established between a developing company and the host country, there will likely be relation-
ships between two or more developing companies that participate together in an operation in a
host country to obtain, maintain, and maximize economic production from a large project. Such
participation  requires  a  joint  operating  agreement  to  establish  and  govern  the  relationship  be-
tween  the  multiple  developing  companies.  One  company  is  designated  as  the  operator  and  is
given  necessary  authority  to  conduct  all  operations  required  under  the  host  country  mineral
development agreement. Operating committees are commonly established to address and advise
the  operator  on  various  technical  or  financial  matters.  The  authority  of  the  operator  also  may
be limited by the working interest parties, who have the right to approve certain actions taken
by the operator. Further, participation in certain operations may be optional, and provisions are
necessary to govern these elections. International joint operating agreements can be on standard-
ized  form  agreements  or  can  be  individually  negotiated  by  the  working  interest  parties  and
contain many of the same types of provisions found in joint operating agreements used in the
United States for domestic oil and gas developments, as discussed in greater detail next.

17.5 Joint Operating Agreement
The exploration and development of oil properties is an enterprise fraught with risk. Consequent-
ly, mineral developers look to share the risks, costs, and rewards of exploration and production
with  other  companies.  The  contractual  arrangements  between  these  coventurers  can  be  quite
complicated and result in all sorts of contracts. The foundation to these arrangements, however,
is the joint operating agreement (JOA). (For a thorough discussion on the nature of operating
agreements in the United Kingdom, see Ref. 8.)

In  international  petroleum  development,  a  JOA  sets  out  the  basic  commercial  relationship
between two or more petroleum developers. The JOA will name one of the parties as the oper-
ator.  The  operator  is  responsible  for  day-to-day  management  of  the  exploration  and  develop-
ment program. The other parties, the nonoperators, reimburse the operator for its costs on a pro
rata basis relative to their respective ownership interests in the project. Many of the issues relat-
ed to joint operating agreements arise in determining the respective rights of the operators and
nonoperators.

A joint operating agreement will set out the percentage ownership interests held by the var-
ious  parties,  and  each  is  responsible  for  its  proportionate  share  of  operating  costs.  The  party
with the highest participating interest is typically the operator, but this need not be the case.

The  operator  will  develop  proposed  work  programs  and  budgets,  including  Authorization
for  Expenditures  (AFE).  These  programs  are  subject  to  approval  by  the  parties  to  the  JOA.
Voting rights are established proportionately, and a proposed program or AFE can typically be
approved by a specified voting percentage. If a party’s interest in the property is high enough,
it might have a blocking vote.

The JOA will usually include a set of accounting principles to be used by the operator in
allocating  costs  and  revenues  among  the  parties  to  the  JOA.  The  accounting  principles  will
allow  an  objective  determination  of  costs  and  expenses.  The  accounting  principles  sometimes
allow the operator to pass through some overhead charges. These charges relate to the cost of
corporate headquarters support for the field operations, and reflect home office charges rather
than the charges directly arising from the field. Overhead might be determined on an allocation
of corporate costs, or might be negotiated. Overhead charges are sometimes tied to a published
index,  which  allows  easy  calculation  of  the  costs,  and  which  should  reflect  standard  industry
charges for services or the effect of inflation on such charges.

Many JOAs allow a party to “sole risk” a proposed project. One party may wish to drill an
exploratory well, and the other parties refuse to authorize payment of the cost. If the votes are

I-820

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

insufficient to authorize the well, a party might pay for all those costs by itself, therefore tak-
ing on the sole risk for that well’s success or failure. If the well leads to a discovery, the sole
risk party gains, in return, the sole right to production from that discovery. The sole risk party
will  have  the  right  to  use  field  facilities  for  any  resulting  production.  Some  JOAs  allow  the
nonparticipating parties to join in the new development, but only upon payment of a significant
premium. The payment of a premium reflects the fact that these parties did not take on the risk
of  the  initial  expenditure  and  so  should  not  be  able  to  simply  pay  their  pro  rata  share  of  the
costs and gain the benefits accruing from the bold decision of the sole risk party.

JOAs may also create preemptive or preferential rights, allowing the parties to the JOA the
right  to  purchase  another  participant’s  interest  before  it  is  sold  to  a  third  party.  Preemptive
rights can be quite restrictive—designed to assure that the existing participants can control fu-
ture ownership—or relatively relaxed—simply requiring that a first offer be made to the JOA
parties or that those parties have a right to negotiate for a purchase before a third party offer
can be accepted.

A  joint  operating  agreement  typically  includes  a  clause  indemnifying  the  operator  from
some  liabilities  that  would  otherwise  accrue  to  the  operator  in  that  role.  The  notion  is  that
certain risks should be shared pro rata among the parties to the JOA, rather than borne entirely
by the operator. Thus, the JOA will typically provide for a fairly broad indemnity of the opera-
tor,  subject  only  to  exceptions  for  affirmative  acts  or  omissions  of  the  operator,  such  as  the
operator’s willful misconduct, willful default, or perhaps gross negligence. A merely negligent
act  of  the  operator,  then,  might  create  a  liability  that  is  shared  pro  rata  by  the  parties  to  the
JOA.  Some  JOAs  define  concepts  like  willful  misconduct  and  attempt  to  limit  willful  acts  to
the acts of senior managers or other management employees of the operator. In doing so, the
JOA shifts the risk of willful misconduct of lower level employees of the operator to the par-
ties to the JOA, rather than the operator by itself. The indemnity provisions of a JOA and the
definitions of willfulness can inspire lively debate in the course of negotiations.

17.6 Marketing Arrangements
The  marketing  of  petroleum  products  is  influenced  by  the  nature  of  the  petroleum  produced
and  the  location  of  the  field.  The  market  for  oil  and  other  liquids  is  quite  different  from  the
market  for  natural  gas.  Also,  the  transportation  of  oil  and  natural  gas  to  the  marketplace  can
pose significant commercial and technical issues. As a result, oil producers and energy buyers
have developed sophisticated legal arrangements to address these issues.

17.6.1 Oil Marketing.  Crude oil can be sold anywhere in the world, and the market price for
oil  is  determined  at  any  one  of  a  number  of  hubs  (central  marketing  points)  throughout  the
world. Consequently, if an international oil producer can get the oil on a boat, the cargo can be
sold  into  the  world  market.  Local  economics,  therefore,  have  little  effect  on  the  market  price
for  oil  that  reaches  the  marketplace.  As  noted,  however,  the  producer  may  be  required  by  its
mineral development agreement to sell oil into the local market, or perhaps to sell a portion of
its oil to the local government at a discount against the market price at a particular hub.

As discussed, it is common for producing properties to be owned or controlled by a num-
ber of parties, including foreign oil companies and national entities. Once oil is produced, the
parties must determine who owns the oil and how it will be marketed. The parties operating a
field  typically  enter  into  a  lifting  agreement,  which  describes  the  process  for  taking  oil  from
the  wellhead  to  the  marketplace.  It  will  also  describe  the  process  for  determining  the  parties’
ownership  interest  in  that  oil.  Ownership  of  produced  oil  is  typically  proportional  to  the  par-
ties’  field  interests,  but  that  proportional  interest  may  vary  from  shipment  to  shipment.  There
are  occasions,  for  example,  in  which  one  party  will  overlift  (take  more  than  its  proportional
share) and the other parties will underlift. While this practice is more common with gas agree-
ments  than  with  oil  sales  arrangements,  the  parties  may  enter  into  a  balancing  agreement,

Chapter 17—International Oil and Gas Law

I-821

which is designed to assure that each party takes its pro rata share of oil by the end of the life
of the field.

Some  international  agreements  also  provide  for  the  foreign  oil  company  to  market  the  oil
on  behalf  of  the  local  companies.  The  marketing  of  oil  requires  a  knowledge  of  the  markets
and pricing mechanisms, and an oil company may be able to secure a fee or other considera-
tion  for  providing  this  service.  A  sophisticated  financial  market  has  evolved  around  the
petroleum  market,  and  companies  can  trade  in  futures  and  derivatives  if  they  choose.  These
financial instruments are typically used as market hedging devices and do not affect the direct
sale of oil into the marketplace.

Where  markets  are  well  developed  near  the  producing  property,  the  oil  company  may  be
able to transport its oil to market through a pipeline. In some instances, the oil company may
have  an  ownership  interest  in  the  pipeline,  and  indeed  may  have  been  required  to  contribute
capital to the construction of the pipeline. In other cases, the pipeline might be owned by the
government or a government controlled company, or perhaps another oil company or group of
oil  companies.  Whatever  the  circumstance,  the  producing  company  will  be  required  to  pay  a
tariff  to  the  pipeline  company  for  the  right  to  transport  oil  through  the  pipeline.  Because
pipelines often have a monopoly on transportation from a field or area, it is critical that the oil
producer negotiate a tariff rate that remains certain throughout the producing life of the field.
Tariffs may be indexed, which allows the tariff rate to vary over time, based on external and
objective economic factors. The oil producer may have problems, however, if it is required to
renegotiate the tariff rate after it has spent its capital in field development and must rely on the
pipeline to get its oil to market. The tariff rate will certainly affect the economic return from a
field.

17.6.2 Gas Markets.  Unlike the market for oil, the market for natural gas is local. Natural gas
can be marketed worldwide only by converting the gas to liquefied natural gas, which is dis-
cussed below. In all other circumstances, natural gas must be taken to market through pipelines
and put to domestic or commercial use within the pipeline system.

When a mineral property produces natural gas, the mineral developer must address the va-
garies  and  logistics  of  the  local  market.  In  some  parts  of  the  world,  markets  are  well  devel-
oped, and indeed have grown together. The United Kingdom market is an interesting example
of how markets can develop over time. When gas was first produced on the U.K. continental
shelf,  all  natural  gas  was  purchased  by  a  single  quasigovernmental  company.  Gas  was  pur-
chased  under  take  or  pay  contracts  designed  to  last  the  life  of  the  field.  Gas  sellers  were
committed to sell every molecule of gas produced from the field to that buyer, and the amount
of gas taken in any year would swing within a contractually specified range.

Over time, England opened its internal gas market and allowed other companies to buy and
sell gas and use the onshore gas transportation system, subject to a uniform tariff for transporta-
tion cost. A sophisticated gas trading process immediately sprang up, and gas buyers and gas
sellers would trade gas on the day, or buy or sell gas forward. The prior model for gas sales
agreements, the long term take or pay contract, diminished in usefulness, as gas producers want-
ed  the  flexibility  to  manage  and  hedge  the  market  risk  of  gas.  Gas  producers  and  trading
companies  would  enter  into  master  gas  sales  agreements,  which  provided  standard  terms  and
conditions  for  any  gas  sale.  Each  individual  sale  thereafter  could  be  consummated  over  the
telephone,  and  then  confirmed  by  a  fax,  all  pursuant  to  the  master  gas  sales  agreement.  Gas
producers moved from having every molecule of gas committed to a single buyer under a set
of  long  term  contracts  to  a  diversified  portfolio  of  gas  sales  arrangements  designed  to  meet
their commercial needs.

While England was opening its internal market, the European Union passed a gas directive
designed to open the entire European common market. Simultaneously with this legal action, a
group of companies built a gas pipeline interconnecting England and Europe. The interconnec-

I-822

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

tor  pipeline  created  a  new  market  for  English  gas  and  opened  the  U.K.  market  to  European
gas. While there are a number of logistical and political impediments to the complete opening
of  the  European  gas  market,  the  trend  is  toward  an  open  market,  and  the  same  trading  and
hedging markets that developed in England are now developing in Europe. Thus, gas sales ar-
rangements are becoming more and more transnational in Europe. To add to the complication,
existing  or  planned  pipelines  will  allow  the  marketing  of  Algerian  and  Russian  gas  into  Eu-
rope, which will further expand the borders of the gas marketplace.

For a mineral developer in Europe, the development of a natural gas field allows that pro-
ducer to tap into a market that is becoming more and more open, which allows the developer
to market its gas to a number of potential buyers and use futures and hedging to manage price
risk.

In  other  parts  of  the  world,  however,  the  marketplace  for  natural  gas  is  much  less  devel-
oped. The natural gas producer is likely to find itself in much the same position as the early
gas developers in England—forced to sell gas to a single buyer at a set price. In these circum-
stances,  a  long-term  contract  provides  some  benefit  to  the  gas  producer.  The  field  depletion
contract allows the gas producer to recognize a set return on its investment, although the pro-
ducer won’t have the opportunity to take advantage of the risks and rewards of a vigorous market.
Where  market  opportunities  exist,  as  in  Europe,  the  various  participants  in  a  gas  project
may have different views of when to participate in the market. As a result, gas producers enter
into complex gas allocation and gas-balancing arrangements, which are designed to allow maxi-
mum  flexibility  in  taking  gas  on  a  given  day,  while  assuring  that  each  party  has  received  its
fair  share  of  gas  by  the  end  of  field  life.  A  certain  amount  of  gas  must  be  used  to  operate
producing fields and pipelines, and the allocation agreement assures that each party receives its
proper share of the remainder. Balancing arrangements, as discussed, are put in place to allow
a party to take extra gas on a day and then come back into balance over time. If a party has
overproduced  in  the  past,  it  might  find  that  its  pro  rata  share  is  reduced  until  its  allocation
comes back into balance, or at least closer to balance, with the other field owners.

17.6.3 Liquefied Natural Gas.  Sometimes a natural gas find is too far from markets to allow
the sale of gas through a pipeline. In these circumstances, the mineral developer may choose to
convert the natural gas to liquefied natural gas (LNG).9 The producer must develop facilities to
cool and liquefy the LNG and then store the LNG in pressurized tanks. The LNG can then be
placed  on  a  ship  and  transported  anywhere  in  the  world.  The  problem,  of  course,  is  that  this
process is very expensive. Also, the end-buyer must have facilities designed to allow unloading
of  the  LNG,  which  limits  the  market  for  this  product.  Thus,  LNG  development  is  used  only
where  there  are  large  quantities  of  natural  gas  available  and  local  markets  are  insufficient  to
allow marketing of the gas. Algeria, for example, ships LNG to Turkey, even though there is a
pipeline  that  allows  some  Algerian  gas  to  enter  the  European  market.  Similarly,  Indonesian
LNG is sold to Japan, China, and India. Alaskan LNG projects are being developed for sales
into existing and developing Pacific Rim markets. At present, LNG tends to be marketed under
long-term single buyer contracts.

17.7 Abandonment
For many years, little attention was paid to the process or cost associated with the decommis-
sioning or abandonment of oil and gas facilities, either by governments or commercial opera-
tors.  The  issues  to  abandonment  and  decommissioning  are  especially  acute  for  offshore
installations. The cost of decommissioning is quite high. The United Kingdom Offshore Opera-
tors Association (UKOOA) estimates the cost of decommissioning a small southern North Sea
structure  to  be  £30  million,  with  the  cost  of  decommissioning  a  larger  structure  running  as
high  as  £200  million.10  Consequently,  oil  and  gas  operators  prefer  to  remove  as  little  of  an

Chapter 17—International Oil and Gas Law

I-823

offshore structure as possible, while environmental groups routinely advocate complete removal
of facilities.

These  issues  received  a  great  deal  of  attention  when  Shell  Oil  proposed  abandoning  the
Brent Spar, a large floating oil storage and loading platform. Shell proposed scuttling the plat-
form.  The  environmental  organization  Greenpeace  decided  that  this  approach  to  abandonment
was  inappropriate  and  focused  a  great  deal  of  attention  on  the  proposed  decommissioning  of
the Brent Spar. As a result, Shell changed its proposed approach to decommissioning that facil-
ity at a significantly greater cost.

There are several international conventions and guidelines addressing the decommissioning
of  offshore  oil  and  gas  facilities.  The  United  Nations,  for  example,  passed  the  1958  Geneva
Convention  on  the  continental  shelf.  Sec.  5(5)  of  that  Convention  calls  for  the  complete  re-
moval of all offshore oil and gas facilities. This Convention, however, has had little effect on
the regulation of offshore oil and gas facilities. Only approximately 38 countries are signatories
to the Convention, and few countries with abandonment regulations require complete removal
of offshore structures. In 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNC-
LOS)  was  passed,  effectively  superceding  the  1958  Convention.  UNCLOS  contemplates  the
partial removal of offshore facilities.11

In  addition  to  these  conventions,  the  International  Maritime  Organization  (IMO)  provides
standards  for  the  decommissioning  of  offshore  platforms  and  installations.  Under  IMO  guide-
lines,  for  example,  structures  in  less  than  100  meters  of  water  must  be  completely  removed.
Structures in deeper water can be partially removed but must allow for 55 meters of open wa-
ter above the abandoned portion of the facility.

The parties to most international oil and gas agreements have only recently been including
provisions addressing abandonment of offshore facilities. Some joint operating agreements, for
example,  simply  provide  for  an  abandonment  plan  to  be  drafted  five  years  before  the  end  of
field life, with some rules concerning the approval of that plan. Other JOA’s now include pro-
visions  requiring  the  parties  to  contribute  toward  abandonment  as  the  field  begins  to  decline,
with remedies specified if a party fails to meet the contribution standards in the agreement.

17.8 Dispute Resolution
The petroleum engineer should have a basic understanding of dispute resolution in international
petroleum  transactions  to  effectively  evaluate  particular  projects,  strategies,  and  agreements.12
(For  additional  information  on  international  dispute  resolution,  see  Ref.  12.)  Disputes  are  in-
evitable  during  the  course  of  long-term  transactions,  and  international  petroleum  transactions
are certainly no exception. Most contracts and operating agreements include dispute resolution
provisions,  which  provide  for  choice  of  law,  choice  of  forum,  and  the  method  for  resolving
disputes.13 While litigation and various other types of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) may
be  used,  including  mediation,  the  preferred  method,  in  international  petroleum  transactions,  is
arbitration. Of course, any discussion of dispute resolution, like dispute resolution itself, is of
little substance without a discussion of whether judgments and arbitral awards can be enforced.

17.8.1 Choice  of  Law,  Choice  of  Forum,  and  Contractual  Dispute  Resolution  Provisions.
The primary consideration in any dispute resolution provision is the agreement among the par-
ties about which jurisdiction’s law shall govern and where disputes will be resolved. Choice of
law and choice of forum provisions are generally recommended and indispensable because the
absence of such provisions may relegate the parties to the uncertainties of a foreign legal sys-
tem or to a body of law and panel of decision-makers ill prepared to resolve the complexities
of international petroleum transactions and oil and gas law.

Choice of Law.  An agreement about what substantive law applies to a given transaction is
essential to resolving disputes about contract interpretation, performance, and remedies. Choice
of  law  clauses  are  generally  upheld  during  dispute  resolution,  but  enforceability  depends  on

I-824

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

whether  the  parties  are  subject  to  arbitration  or  litigation.  In  arbitration,  the  choice  of  law
agreed to by the parties is almost always given effect to resolve disputes concerning the sub-
stance  of  the  transaction.  If  the  dispute  is  litigated  or  otherwise  submitted  to  a  court  in  a
particular  jurisdiction,  most  courts  have  a  distinct  body  of  law  governing  conflict  of  laws,
which provide varying results based upon the particular court’s evaluation of the choice of law
clause, the transaction, and the public policies of the particular jurisdiction.

Common law principles applied in United States courts generally provide that the law cho-
sen  by  the  parties  of  a  contract  shall  apply  unless  the  chosen  jurisdiction  has  no  substantial
relationship to the parties or transaction and there is no reasonable basis for the parties’ choice,
or unless application of the chosen law violates a fundamental policy or interest of a host coun-
try  that  has  a  materially  greater  interest.  Admittedly,  litigation  under  such  common  law
principles  may  not  provide  certainty  in  enforcing  choice  of  law  clauses.  Because  other  legal
systems might raise even more questions concerning enforceability, arbitration is often the pre-
ferred dispute resolution method.

Choice  of  Forum.    Forum  selection  clauses  allow  parties  to  select  a  particular  group  or
court to hear their dispute. In the context of arbitration or other forms of ADR, the choice of
forum clause is often included within a particular arbitration or ADR clause or is incorporated
by reference to the governing arbitration or ADR rules of a specific institution that prescribes
the place of hearing and related procedures. In litigation, as with choice of law clauses, there is
some uncertainty whether choice of forum clauses will be upheld in all jurisdictions.

The general rule in most western nations is that forum selection clauses are valid and the
party  resisting  enforcement  of  the  clause  must  show  fraud  or  establish  that  the  circumstances
make  enforcement  unreasonable  or  unjust  before  the  party  can  avoid  the  clause.  Of  course,
fundamental  public  policy  concerns  may  be  considered  by  a  particular  jurisdiction,  but  in  the
context of disputes between parties from different nations, most western courts generally limit
public policy exceptions to situations in which the contractual forum chosen either won’t hear
the dispute on a fair and impartial basis or physical danger is associated with the chosen forum.

17.8.2 Arbitration  and  Alternative  Dispute  Resolution  (ADR).    Arbitration  and  other  ADR
systems  are  particularly  suited  to  the  resolution  of  conflicts  in  international  petroleum
transactions.14  (For  a  concise  introduction  to  international  arbitration  and  ADR,  as  well  as  an
exhaustive  list  of  references  and  links,  see  Ref.  14.)  Litigation  is  considered  more  expensive
and arguably leads to more adversarial relationships rather than relationships that facilitate long-
term  development  and  cooperation  typically  associated  with  the  development  of  international
petroleum  projects.  Depending  upon  the  arbitration  clause  and  arbitration  forum  used,  arbitra-
tion can offer a quicker, confidential, and binding resolution. A variety of pre-arbitral methods,
including mediation, provide nonbinding alternatives to parties who wish to avoid litigation and
arbitration.

International Arbitration.  Parties  may  agree  to  ad hoc  or  institutional arbitration. Ad hoc
arbitration involves arbitration proceedings chosen by the parties themselves in accordance with
mutually agreed-upon rules and procedures. This type of arbitration requires the parties to as-
sume  the  responsibilities  of  administering  and  planning  the  entire  arbitration  without  the
supervision  of  an  established  institution.  The  parties  can  specifically  reference  and  adopt  the
arbitration rules of other associations. The United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law (UNCITRAL) established arbitration rules without an institution that oversees the proceed-
ings so that parties could either use the UNCITRAL rules in their own ad hoc proceedings or
require  the  institution  chosen  to  apply  such  rules.  In  ad  hoc  arbitration,  there  is  no  quality
control and oversight by a reputable institution. While ad hoc arbitral awards are also observed
by most parties and enforceable under the same laws discussed next, international courts may
be more likely to intervene than if the arbitration were before an established institution.

Chapter 17—International Oil and Gas Law

I-825

In  international  petroleum  transactions,  parties  more  often  choose  or  resort  to  institutional
arbitration before any one of the many public and private institutions. The most recognized and
respected institutions are the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the London Court of
International Arbitration (LCIA), the American Arbitration Association (AAA), and the Interna-
tional Centre for the Settlement of International Disputes (ICSID), although there are countless
other regional, local and industry-specialized arbitration forums.15–17 (For a thorough discussion
of these institutions and for helpful Internet links to other institutions and resources, see Refs.
15  through  17.)  These  institutions  provide  a  sophisticated  forum  allowing  parties  to  resolve
conflicts under established rules and procedures before arbitrators adept at applying internation-
al law and understanding different legal systems.

In  1985,  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  adopted  the  Model  Law  on  International
Commercial Arbitration drafted by UNCITRAL. The model law was created to provide a uni-
form and common law of arbitration throughout the world with the goal of resolving the many
inherent conflicts among various national arbitration laws. UNCITRAL’s model arbitration law
has served as the basis for many national arbitration statutes throughout the world and even for
some state statutes in the United States. Until the majority of nations fully adopt UNCITRAL’s
model law on arbitration, there will be differences among the nations in interpreting and apply-
ing the arbitration rules chosen by the parties or the rules of a particular institution.

The actual process of arbitration varies depending upon the arbitration clause included in a
particular contract and the rules and procedures promulgated by the arbitral institution chosen.
Whether engaged in ad hoc or institutional arbitration, parties must resolve numerous procedu-
ral  issues,  including  selection  of  arbitrators,  number  of  arbitrators,  the  language  used  in  the
arbitral proceedings, and the procedures used for discovery and fact gathering. Institutional arbi-
tration has been criticized because it has taken on more characteristics of litigation, becoming
costly  and  time-consuming,  and  certain  arbitration  associations  may  not  provide  the  expertise
and  industry  knowledge  sufficient  to  resolve  disputes  concerning  complex  international
petroleum  transactions.  Increasingly,  parties  have  looked  to  other  forms  of  ADR  to  resolve
their disputes in less formal environments that accommodate quicker resolution and foster con-
tinued business relationships.

International Mediation and Other ADR.  Before  litigating  or  arbitrating  a  dispute,  many
parties choose mediation, conciliation, minitrial and other pre-arbitral and prelitigation alterna-
tives. International mediation, a popular alternative among eastern cultures, is a formal process
in  which  parties  submit  their  dispute  to  a  mutually  agreed-upon  third  party  or  to  a  particular
mediation or ADR organization chosen by the parties. Various international organizations have
developed the general procedural rules for mediation, including the ICC, UNCITRAL, and the
Commercial Arbitration and Mediation Center for the Americas (CAMCA). Conciliation is con-
sidered  a  less  formal  alternative  to  mediation  and,  unlike  mediation,  is  used  less  for  the
purpose  of  obtaining  a  final  settlement  and  agreement  between  the  parties,  and  more  for  the
purpose of maintaining communication between the parties. Like mediation, general procedural
guidelines have been promulgated by various international organizations (e.g., the ICC Rules of
Optional Conciliation) which are designed to assist the conciliation process and assure impar-
tiality, equity and justice.

Other  nonbinding  ADR  alternatives  include  the  use  of  pre-arbitral  referees  and  minitrials,
which  allow  neutral  parties  to  narrow  the  issues  and  assess  the  facts  and  law  governing  their
dispute and provides the parties with an unbiased view of their respective strengths and weak-
nesses. There are many ADR centers throughout the world and offered by many international
organizations.  Alternatives  are  less  likely  to  be  drafted  into  international  petroleum  contracts
but are increasingly popular to avoid initiating the lengthy and binding methods of arbitration
and litigation.

17.8.3 Enforcement of Judgments and Arbitral Awards.  The enforcement of judgments and
arbitral awards is the final step in a dispute resolution process and can often be more problem-
atic than litigating or arbitrating the dispute itself. Enforcement efforts usually require bilateral
and multilateral agreements among countries. Obtaining satisfaction upon a judgment or award
often  involves  efforts  under  different  legal  systems  with  varying  public  policies  that  can  be
cited to avoid enforcement or limit the satisfaction sought.

There is no settled international law requiring enforcement of foreign judgments, although
many nations are either parties to various enforcement conventions and regional agreements or
base  enforcement  upon  principals  of  international  comity  and  reciprocity  embodied  in  their
own  national  laws.  The  first  of  two  significant  sessions  for  the  Hague  Conference  on  Private
International Law occurred from 6 June 2001 to 22 June 2001 in pursuit of a new Convention
on  Jurisdiction and  Foreign  Judgments  in  Civil and  Commercial Matters.  A  finalized conven-
tion on enforcement of judgments is not expected until after the second session of The Hague
Conference on Private International Law scheduled for the beginning of 2003.

Enforcement of judgments varies, depending upon the legal system of particular nations. As
discussed  in  Sec.  17.9,  there  are  many  differences  between  the  civil  code  and  common  law
legal  systems.  Whereas  civil  code  nations  have  specific  national  laws  governing  recognition
and  enforcement  of  foreign  judgments,  courts  in  common  law  countries,  such  as  the  United
States, will evaluate applicable statutes and analyze each situation based upon developed com-
mon  law  principles  affecting  jurisdictions,  notice  and  due  process,  and  fraud.  Most  nations,
including those that are parties to bilateral and multilateral conventions or enforcement of for-
eign judgments, have public policy exceptions that allow the jurisdiction to avoid enforcement.
The  lack of  certainty in  enforcement of  judgments and  the  lengthy process  often  required for
obtaining satisfaction are additional reasons for parties to choose arbitration or other forms of
ADR.

Like judgments, enforcement of arbitral awards is subject to bilateral and multilateral agree-
ments  among  nations,  but  owing  to  the  long  history  of  arbitration  as  a  successful  method  of
resolving  international  disputes,  arbitral  awards  are  generally  observed  around  the  world  by
private  parties  and  governments  or  state-owned  entities.  Arbitral  awards  are  automatically  en-
forceable in most countries under the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement  of  Foreign  Arbitral  Awards,  also  known  as  the  New  York  Convention.  Where
arbitral  awards  cannot  be  enforced  under  the  New  York  Convention,  the  particular  host
nation’s own domestic laws and other bilateral and regional agreements might provide a mech-
anism for enforcement. For example, many Latin American countries are not signatories to the
New York Convention; however, most of the nations in Latin America have established nation-
al arbitration laws or are bound by the Inter-American Convention on International Commercial
Arbitration (Panama Convention).

The international agreements and laws affecting enforcement have simple requirements, usu-
ally  that  the  arbitration  agreement  be  reduced  to  writing,  signed  by  all  parties,  and  that  the
parties had notice of the proceeding and a reasonable opportunity to participate. Conventions,
including the New York Convention, have been ratified by countries subject to various public
policy exceptions peculiar to each jurisdiction. For instance, many countries governed by Islam-
ic  Law  maintain  an  affirmative  defense  to  arbitral  awards  where  a  Muslim  was  not  the
arbitrator  or  included  among  the  panel  of  arbitrators.  Even  where  arbitral  awards  are  recog-
nized  in  a  given  jurisdiction,  satisfaction  of  the  award  by  means  of  seizure  of  property  can
prove impossible. This is especially true for assets and property related to exploration and de-
velopment  of  a  nation’s  natural  resources,  which  might  be  protected  under  international  law
and principles of sovereignty, discussed next.

Chapter 17—International Oil and Gas Law

17.9 International Law and Legal Systems
Disputes  in  international  petroleum  transactions  often  involve  a  host  country  or  national  oil
company. Because governments are often in conflict with other governments or private parties,
a variety of international law considerations must be addressed, including national sovereignty,
international treaties and conventions, the type of legal system used in a particular nation, and
whether certain domestic laws have extraterritorial application.18

17.9.1 Sovereignty.  Sovereignty refers to the right of a nation to control the people or things
within its boundaries. It is recognized among all nations of the world that sovereignty extends
to  the  nation’s  natural  resources.  Notwithstanding  trends  toward  privatization,  much  of  the
world’s natural resources remain publicly owned or controlled by governmental entities. Based
upon their sovereignty, nations are free to change their legal regimes and laws governing natu-
ral  resources  and  have  the  power  to  expropriate  the  property  of  foreign  nationals  doing
business in their country. Examination of such expropriations or takings by host nations of the
property and contractual rights of foreign nationals is precluded by various doctrines of interna-
tional  law.  The  act  of  state  doctrine,  a  doctrine  derived  from  the  principal  of  sovereignty,
requires courts to refrain from reviewing the official acts of other nations affecting matters and
resources within that nation’s borders.

International  law  also  recognizes  the  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity.  Sovereign  immunity
prohibits  a  nation  and  its  state-owned  entities  from  being  sued  in  the  courts  of  other  nations
absent express and implied waiver of such sovereign immunity. Sovereignty does not grant the
license  to  violate  international  law  and  may  not  protect  a  nation  or  its  governmental  entities
from  claims  related  to  international  commerce.  In  the  context  of  expropriation,  the  trend  in
international  law  is  toward  an  international  consensus  that  property  should  not  be  taken  for
public purposes without just compensation. While the world community may be far from adopt-
ing  the  takings  jurisprudence  applied  in  the  United  States,  where  governments  must  pay
compensation for acquiring private property for public uses, many treaties and trade organiza-
tions  recognize  the  basic  principle.  International  law  presently  requires  application  of  the
expropriating  nation’s  own  domestic  compensation  laws  before  other  nations  can  take  actions
in response to the expropriation of a foreign company’s property.

When  a  dispute  between  citizens  or  corporations  and  a  national  oil  company  concerns  a
breach of contract or similar claim other than expropriation, many nations recognize a restric-
tive theory of sovereign immunity. The restrictive theory holds that when a sovereign nation is
engaged  in  essentially  private  transactions,  such  as  commercial  contracts,  there  is  less  risk  of
interfering with the integrity of the nation. Several nations have statutes that adopt the restric-
tive theory of sovereign immunity. The United States applies the Foreign Sovereign Immunities
Act (FSIA), which allows courts to find an express or implied waiver of sovereign immunity.
Generally waiver is construed very narrowly under the FSIA, although the grounds for finding
waiver are broader where the national oil company or governmental entity is engaged in world-
wide  mineral  development  or  are  otherwise  parties  to  operating  agreements  and  private  con-
tracts  other  than  concessions.  Significant  petroleum  transactions  involving  governments  often
stipulate an express waiver of sovereign immunity, and such waivers are generally upheld. The
United Kingdom follows a law similar to the FSIA, the State Immunity Act of 1978, and the
European Union (EU) has adopted the European Convention on State Immunity and Additional
Protocol.

Even though modern laws and international agreements are changing to put all parties, in-
cluding  governments,  on  equal  footing  with  respect  to  commercial  transactions,  there  are  still
obstacles to litigating matters concerning a nation’s development of its own natural resources.
In  addition  to  the  act  of  state  doctrine  previously  discussed,  many  courts  deny  jurisdiction  or
refuse to adjudicate international petroleum disputes that raise a political question. In these in-

I-828

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

stances, courts may recognize that the dispute is already subject to trade agreements or national
policies, or that such disputes are more appropriately addressed through diplomacy.

17.9.2 Treaties and Conventions.  International law is the body of principles and customs that
nations  recognize  as  binding  on  their  mutual  relations  with  one  another.  International  agree-
ments,  customs,  and  general  principles  are  the  primary  sources  of  international  law.  Treaties,
conventions,  pacts,  accords,  and  protocols  are  all  international  agreements.19  (For  a  thorough
listing  of  international  agreements,  including  helpful  links  for  treaty  research,  see  Ref.  19.)
Treaties  may  be  either  bilateral,  an  agreement  between  two  nations,  or  multilateral,  an  agree-
ment among several nations. Once signed by the participating countries, the treaties serve as a
source of international law to resolve international disputes. Conventions are similar to treaties,
but the term refers to larger groups of participating nations, and ratification of a particular con-
vention represents the legal obligation of a participating nation to apply the convention.

The major treaties and conventions include the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,
governing  how  treaties  become  binding;  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  Contracts  for  the
International Sale of Goods (CISG), establishing rules governing the formation of contracts and
contractual remedies similar to the Uniform Commercial Code used in the United States; and
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which sets forth generally
accepted  doctrines  used  to  resolve  boundary  disputes.  Other  effective  and  generally  accepted
conventions include the New York Convention, as discussed, and other dispute resolution con-
ventions,  including  the  Convention  on  the  Settlement  on  Investment  Disputes  Between  States
and  Nationals  of  Other  States  drafted  by  the  International  Centre  for  Settlement  Investment
Disputes. Still other treaties and conventions exist to assist parties in gathering evidence during
disputes. The 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commer-
cial  Matters  includes  the  framework  for  service  of  judicial  documents,  and  the  1970  Hague
Evidence  Convention  provides  alternative  methods  of  discovery  and  evidence  gathering.  The
brevity of this introduction to international law precludes an exhaustive list of treaties and con-
ventions, particularly regional agreements that may affect operations and commerce in particu-
lar regions of the world.

17.9.3 Civil Law and Common Law Systems.  The resolution of disputes, enforcement of judg-
ments and arbitral awards, and the application of international law are significantly influenced
by the type of legal system used in a particular nation.20 The domestic law of a given nation or
of two or three nations may need to be considered in international petroleum development trans-
actions if the actual development occurs within the boundaries of a single nation but involves
various multinational foreign corporations. Except for the peculiarities of a few legal systems,
such as Islamic law, legal systems are either based upon the common law or civil law. These
systems have different origins and traditions, and their basic distinctions should be understood
to effectively resolve disputes.

The primary distinction between the common law system and civil law system is the scope
of  the  judiciary  and  origins  of  law.  In  common  law  jurisdictions,  the  common  law  is  created
by the judiciary to address specific facts and circumstances, and detailed opinions are written
to  build  accepted  rules  and  principles  that  become  precedent  to  assist  in  resolving  future  dis-
putes. Legislation is limited to address specific social and economic matters.

Civil  law  systems  limit  the  judiciary’s  role  to  interpretation  of  legislation  and  legislative
principles  evidenced  in  very  thorough  and  complete  civil  codes  created  to  address  all  issues
that may arise. Courts in civil law jurisdictions, unlike common law courts, are not bound by
their own prior decisions or by precedents set by other courts. The systems include other differ-
ences affecting how evidence is admitted and trials are conducted. For example, common law
courts allow extensive discovery prior to trial, including depositions and interrogatories or oth-
erwise  limit  out-of-court  statements  not  under  oath.  Civil  law  courts  do  not  have  such  strict

Chapter 17—International Oil and Gas Law

I-829

evidentiary  rules,  and  discovery  mechanisms  such  as  depositions  and  interrogatories  are  not
used to resolve disputes.

An understanding of these legal systems is imperative for the most beneficial selection of a
governing law and forum for any dispute under an international petroleum development transac-
tion.

17.9.4 Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  Extraterritorial  Application  of  Domestic  Laws.
The United States and a few other nations have domestic laws that expressly apply to the for-
eign conduct of its citizens. The most notable example of extraterritorial application of domes-
tic  law  is  the  United  States  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (FCPA)  discussed  in  Sec.  17.4.6,7
The  FCPA  was  passed  to  prevent  bribery  of  foreign  officials  and  to  protect  businesses  from
having  competitors  gain  an  advantage  by  offering  bribes,  although  the  FCPA  has  been  criti-
cized for putting U.S. companies at a significant disadvantage relative to other nations that do
not  have  a  similar  law  governing  the  foreign  conduct  of  its  companies.  By  its  express  terms,
the  FCPA  applies  to  all  types  of  business  entities  organized  under  the  laws  of  the  United
States, including U.S. citizen employees of foreign companies.

Other examples of domestic laws with extraterritorial application include the Sherman An-
titrust Act, which purports to govern conduct outside of the United States and even conduct of
foreign companies in an effort to prevent monopolies and cartels from affecting interstate com-
merce.  The  antitrust  laws  of  the  United  States  do  not  apply  to  foreign  conduct  where  the
alleged  anticompetitive  activities  do  not  have  a  direct,  substantial  and  reasonably  foreseeable
effect  on  commerce  in  the  United  States.  Also,  the  U.S.  Justice  Department  may  decline  to
pursue such foreign conduct for reasons of international comity. The EU adheres to a similar
antitrust law with extraterritorial application known as Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.
The United States also applies its antiboycott law to conduct abroad. The Export Adminis-
tration Act prohibits conduct that furthers a boycott of countries friendly to the United States
for  both  U.S.  citizens  and  corporations.  By  its  express  terms,  the  act  applies  to  foreign  sub-
sidiaries controlled in fact by a U.S. citizen or corporation, although practical application of the
act has been limited to Arab boycotts of Israel.

Many  nations  have  laws  authorizing  export  controls  and  other  economic  sanctions.  As  is
the case for many world leaders, the President of the United States has the authority to regu-
late international commerce and property transactions during any declared national emergency
under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. From time to time, this act has been
used  to  prohibit corporate citizens of  the  United  States  from  doing  business  in  specific coun-
tries. Similar economic sanctions have been used by other nations, although such foreign policy
controls are far less used than in decades past because much of the world community has rec-
ognized the benefits of eliminating restraints on free trade.

The 21st Century Energy Mix
John R. Fanchi, Colorado School of Mines

18.1 Introduction
Energy  demand  is  expected  to  grow  during  the  next  century  as  more  countries  seek  a  better
quality of life for their citizens. Increasing trends in population and consumption, price volatili-
ty,  supply  instability,  and  environmental  concerns  are  changing  the  energy  mix  and  energy
strategies  in  the  21st  century.  The  energy  mix  is  the  set  of  energy  sources  that  are  used  to
meet energy demand. Energy demand will be met by a global energy mix that is transitioning
from a mix dominated by fossil fuels to a more balanced energy portfolio.

The emerging energy mix will rely on clean energy. Clean energy refers to energy that has
little  or  no  detrimental  impact  on  the  environment.  The  goal  is  sustainable  development─the
integration of social and environmental concerns into development activities that optimize eco-
nomic profitability and value creation as the world undergoes the transition from nonrenewable
fossil fuels to renewable fuels and a sustainable, secure energy infrastructure.

This chapter presents an overview of energy sources available for use in the 21st century.
Following the overview, a prediction of the contribution of hydrocarbon oil and gas to the 21st
century  energy  mix  is  presented.  This  prediction  is  only  one  possible  scenario  selected  from
the  literature  for  analysis.  The  scenario  assumes  a  gradual  transition  from  the  dominance  of
fossil fuels in the current energy mix to a more balanced energy portfolio. The projected ener-
gy  portfolio  for  the  21st  century  is  presented,  and  the  implications  for  society  and  the  emer-
gence of an energy industry are discussed.

18.2 Energy Options
The literature contains several sources, such as Refs. 1 through 10, that present a description of
the  energy  sources  that  are  available  or  are  expected  to  be  available  during  the  21st  century.
Today’s energy options include fossil fuels, nuclear energy, solar energy, renewable fuels, and
alternative sources.

Fossil fuels are the dominant energy source in the modern global economy, but environmen-
tal concerns are prompting changes to an energy supply that is clean. Natural gas is a source
of  relatively  clean  energy.  Oil  and  gas  fields  are  considered  conventional  sources  of  natural
gas. Two unconventional sources of natural gas are coalbed methane and gas hydrates.

Coalbeds are an abundant source of methane. Miners historically have known the presence
of methane gas in coal as a safety hazard, but it is now being viewed as a source of natural

I-832

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

gas.  Coalbed  methane  exists  as  a  sorbed  monomolecular  layer  on  the  internal  surface  of  the
coal. Its composition is predominantly methane but can also include other constituents, such as
ethane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen. The gas, which is bound in the micropore struc-
ture  of  the  coalbed,  can  diffuse  into  the  natural  fracture  network  when  a  pressure  gradient
exists between the matrix and the fracture network. The fracture network in coalbeds consists
of  microfractures  called  cleats.  Gas  subsequently  flows  through  the  microfractures  to  the  pro-
duction  well.  (See  the  chapter  on  gas  properties  and  correlations  in  this  section  of  the  Hand-
book for more information about methane.)

Gas hydrates are chemical complexes that form when one type of molecule completely en-
closes  another  type  of  molecule  in  a  lattice.  In  the  case  of  gas  hydrates,  hydrogen-bonded
water molecules form a cage-like structure in which mobile molecules of gas are absorbed or
bound. Although gas hydrates occur throughout the world, difficulties in cost-effective produc-
tion  have  hampered  development  of  the  resource.  Gas  hydrates  generally  are  considered
troublesome for oil- and gasfield operations because they can reduce the flow capacity of wells
and pipelines, but their potential commercial value as a clean energy resource is changing the
industry perception. Gas hydrates have the potential to be a significant gas resource because of
the relatively large volume of gas contained in the gas-hydrate complex. (See the chapters on
phase behavior of water systems and water hydration in this section of the Handbook for more
information about gas hydrates.)

Currently, nuclear fission provides nuclear energy. Nuclear fission is the process in which a
large, unstable nucleus decays into two smaller fragments. Fission depends on a finite supply
of fissionable material. Nuclear fusion is the combination, or fusing, of two small nuclei into a
single larger nucleus. Many scientists expect nuclear energy to be provided by nuclear fusion
sometime during the 21st century. The sun supplies energy through fusion reactions. Attempts
to harness and commercialize fusion energy have been unsuccessful so far because of the tech-
nical  difficulties  involved  in  igniting,  containing,  and  controlling  a  fusion  reaction.  Fusion
energy is expected to contribute significantly to the energy mix by the end of the 21st century,
even though a prototype commercial-scale nuclear reactor is not expected to exist until 2015 at
the earliest.11 Both fission and fusion reactions release large amounts of energy, including sig-
nificant  volumes  of  waste  heat  that  must  be  dissipated  and  controlled.  The  decay  products  of
the fission process can be highly radioactive for a long period of time, while the byproducts of
fusion are relatively safe. One of the fission products, the plutonium isotope with atomic num-
ber  239,  is  of  special  concern  because  it  is  a  radioactive  material  with  a  half-life  of  24,000
years, and it can be used for creating nuclear weapons.6 Half-life is the time it takes half of the
nuclei  in  the  radioactive  sample  to  decay.  Fusion  byproducts,  in  contrast,  include  the  stable,
naturally occurring isotope of helium with atomic number 4 and short-lived neutrons.6

Solar  energy  is  available  in  three  forms:  passive,  active,  and  electric.  Active  and  passive
solar  energy  generally  are  used  for  space  conditioning,  such  as  heating  and  cooling.  Active
solar energy technologies are typically mechanical devices, such as solar hot-water heaters, that
collect and distribute solar energy. Passive solar heating integrates building design with environ-
mental factors enabling the capture of solar energy. A simple example is south-facing windows
in  a  house.  Solar  electric  devices,  such  as  photovoltaic  cells,  convert  sunlight  into  electricity.
Groups of photovoltaic cells can provide electricity in quantities ranging from a few milliwatts
to several megawatts and can power devices ranging from calculators to power plants. To get
an  idea  of  the  scale  of  these  values,  a  large  color  TV  requires  approximately  1  kilowatt  of
power, while a power plant for a modern city requires approximately 3 gigawatts.12

Renewable fuels range from hydroelectric and wind to synfuels and biomass.1,3 The kinetic
energy of wind and flowing water are indirect forms of solar energy and are considered renew-
able. Wind turbines harness wind energy, and hydroelectric energy is generated by the flow of

Chapter 18—The 21st Century Energy Mix

I-833

water through a turbine. Both convert the mechanical energy of a rotating blade into electrical
energy in a generator.

The oceans are another solar-powered source of energy.3,6 Waves and tides can be used to
drive electric generators. Temperature gradients in the ocean exist between warm surface water
and cooler water below the surface. If the temperature gradient is large enough, it can be used
to  generate  power  with  ocean  thermal-energy-conversion  power  plants.  Similarly,  temperature
gradients and steam generated by geothermal sources can drive electric generators as a source
of energy.

Biomass refers to wood and other plant or animal matter that can be burned directly or can
be converted into fuel.1,3,6 Historically, wood has been a source of fuel. Technologies now exist
to convert plants, garbage, and animal dung into natural gas. Methanol, or wood alcohol, is a
volatile  fuel  that  has  been  used  in  racecars  for  years.  Ethanol,  which  can  be  produced  from
sugarcane, can be blended with gasoline to form a blended fuel (gasohol) and used in conven-
tional automobile engines or used as the sole fuel source for modified engines. Synthetic fuels
(synfuels) are fossil fuel substitutes created by chemical reactions with such basic resources as
coal  or  biomass.  Synfuels  are  used  as  substitutes  for  conventional  fossil  fuels  such  as  natural
gas and oil.

There are several ways to convert biomass into synfuels. Oils produced by plants such as
rapeseed (canola), sunflowers, and soybeans can be extracted and refined into a synthetic diesel
fuel that can be burned in diesel engines. Thermal pyrolysis and a series of catalytic reactions
can convert the hydrocarbons in wood and municipal wastes into a synthetic gasoline.

One difficulty with the exploitation of biomass fuels is the potential impact on the fertility
of the region. For example, excessive use of dung and crop residues for fuel, instead of fertiliz-
er, can deprive the soil of nutrients needed for future crops.

Synthetic  liquid  hydrocarbon  fuels  can  be  produced  from  natural  gas  by  a  gas-to-liquids

(GTL) conversion process that consists of the following three major steps13:

• Natural gas is partially oxidized with air to produce synthetic gas (syngas).
• The synthetic gas is reacted in a Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) reactor to polymerize it into liquid

hydrocarbons of various carbon-chain lengths.

• The  heavy  fraction  of  the  F-T  products  is  separated  and  cracked  back  to  transportation

fuels in a hydrocracking reactor.

The F-T process produces a hydrocarbon mixture with a range of molecular weight compo-
nents  by  reacting  hydrogen  and  carbon  monoxide  in  the  presence  of  a  catalyst.  The  primary
product of the GTL process is a low-sulfur, low-aromatic, high-cetane diesel fuel.13

Alternative sources of energy include hydrogen fuel cells and cogeneration. Hydrogen can
be used as fuel for a modified internal combustion engine or in a fuel cell. Fuel cells are elec-
trochemical  devices  that  directly  convert  hydrogen  or  hydrogen-rich  fuels  into  electricity
through  a  chemical  process.  Fuel  cells  do  not  need  recharging  or  replacing  and  can  produce
electricity as long as they are supplied with fuel. Hydrogen and oxygen are fuel-cell fuels that
can be produced by the electrolysis of water. Ausubel14 has suggested that the potential of nu-
clear energy will be realized when nuclear energy can be used as a source of electricity and high-
temperature heat for splitting water into its constituent parts.

The  environmental  acceptability  of  hydrogen  fuel  cells  depends  on  how  the  hydrogen  is
produced. If a renewable energy source such as solar energy is used to generate electricity for
electrolysis, vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells would be relatively clean. Hydrogen com-
bustion  emits  water  vapor,  but  it  also  emits  NOx  compounds.  Nitrogen  dioxide  (x=2)  con-
tributes  to  photochemical  smog  and  can  increase  the  severity  of  respiratory  illnesses.  The
shipping  and  storage  of  hydrogen  are  important  unresolved  issues  that  hinder  the  widespread
acceptance and implementation of hydrogen fuel-cell technology.

Cogeneration  is  the  simultaneous  production  of  two  or  more  sources  of  energy.  The  most
common example of cogeneration is the simultaneous generation of electricity and useful heat.
In  this  case,  a  fuel  like  natural  gas  can  be  burned  in  a  boiler  to  produce  steam.  The  steam
drives  an  electric  generator  and  is  recaptured  for  heating  or  manufacturing.  Cogeneration  is
most effective when the cogeneration facility is near the site where the excess heat can be used.

18.3 Energy Forecast
Several energy forecasts have appeared in the recent literature.13,15–21 Although the assumptions,
methods,  and  results  presented  in  each  of  these  predictions  are  debatable,  they  all  show  an
energy infrastructure in transition. The trend in the 20th century has been a move away from
fuels with many carbon atoms to fuels with few or no carbon atoms. This decarbonization pro-
cess is discussed by Ford13 and Ausubel.14 Ausubel defines decarbonization as “the progressive
reduction  in  the  amount  of  carbon  used  to  produce  a  given  amount  of  energy.”  Two  energy
forecasts  are  discussed  here.  One  is  a  projection  of  world  energy  consumption  through  2100,
published  by  Schollnberger.15  Schollnberger’s  forecast  of  world  oil  production  is  compared
with a projection that uses a different method.

Energy forecasts rely on projections of historical trends. Figs. 18.1 and 18.2 are based on
data presented by Schollnberger15 and show the dominance of fossil fuels in the energy mix at
the end of the 20th century. Fig. 18.1 shows historical energy consumption in quads, a unit of
energy that is often used in global energy discussions because it is comparable in magnitude to
global  energy  values.  One  quad  equals  one  quadrillion  BTU,  or  1015  BTU.  In  SI  units,  one
quad is approximately 1018 J. Beginning at the bottom of Fig. 18.1, we see that firewood, coal,
oil, natural gas, water, and nuclear energy were the major contributors to energy in the latter
half of the 20th century.

Chapter 18—The 21st Century Energy Mix

Fig. 18.3—Forecast of a 21st century energy portfolio under Scenario C.

Fig. 18.2 illustrates the dominance of fossil fuels in the energy mix at the end of the 20th
century  as  a  percent  of  total  energy  consumed.  For  example,  oil  accounted  for  approximately
22% of world energy consumed in 1940 and approximately 45% of world energy consumed in
2000. Schollnberger’s estimate for 2000 was a projection15 from historical data that was com-
plete  through  the  end  of  1996.  According  to  the  U.S.  Energy  Information  Agency  (EIA),16
actual oil consumption was approximately 40% of world energy consumed in 2000. This shows
that Schollnberger’s forecast overestimated oil consumption over a relatively short forecast of 4
years;  however,  Schollnberger’s  focus  was  on  long-term  trends,  not  short-term  forecasting.  In
addition, Schollnberger was more interested in the combined forecast of oil and gas consump-
tion or demand because gas can be substituted for oil in many instances. If we combine oil and
gas, Schollnberger forecast oil and gas consumption to be approximately 53% of world energy
consumed  in  2000,  while  EIA  statistics  show  oil  and  gas  consumption  to  be  approximately
62%  of  world  energy  consumed.  From  this  perspective,  Schollnberger  underestimated  oil  and
gas consumption in 2000.

Schollnberger’s15  forecasts  were  designed  to  cover  the  entire  21st  century  and  predict  the
contribution of a variety of energy sources to the 21st century energy portfolio. Schollnberger15
considered three forecast scenarios:

A. “Another century of oil and gas” corresponding to continued high hydrocarbon demand.
B.  “The  end  of  the  internal  combustion  engine”  corresponding  to  a  low  hydrocarbon  de-

mand scenario.

C.  “Energy  mix”  corresponding  to  a  scenario  with  intermediate  demand  for  hydrocarbons

and an increasing demand for alternative energy sources.

Schollnberger  views  Scenario  C  as  the  most  likely  scenario.  It  is  consistent  with  Smil’s
observation22 that, historically, the transition from one energy source to another has taken sever-
al generations. Leaders of the international energy industry have expressed a similar view that
the energy mix is undergoing a shift from liquid fossil fuels to other fuel sources.23,24

There are circumstances in which Scenarios A and B could be more likely than Scenario C.
For example, Scenario B would be more likely if environmental issues led to political restric-
tions on the use of hydrocarbons and an increased reliance on conservation. Scenario B would
also  be  more  likely  if  the  development  of  a  commercially  competitive  fuel  cell  for  powering
vehicles reduced the demand for hydrocarbons as a transportation fuel source. Failure to devel-
op alternative technologies would make Scenario A, which assumes that enough hydrocarbons
will be supplied to meet demand, more likely.

Scenario  C  shows  that  natural  gas  will  gain  importance  as  the  economy  shifts  from  a  re-
liance  on  hydrocarbon  liquid  to  a  reliance  on  hydrocarbon  gas.  Eventually,  renewable  energy
sources such as biomass and solar will displace oil and gas (see Fig. 18.3).

Society’s demand for petroleum fuels should continue at or above current levels for a num-
ber of years, but the trend seems clear (see Fig. 18.4). The global energy portfolio is undergo-

ing a transition from an energy portfolio dominated by fossil fuels to an energy portfolio that
includes a range of fuel types. Schollnberger’s Scenario C presents one possible energy portfo-
lio, and Fig. 18.4 illustrates the historical and projected energy consumption trends.

Schollnberger’s  forecast  is  based  on  demand.  An  alternative  approach  is  to  base  the  fore-
cast  on  supply.  Beginning  with  Hubbert,25  several  authors  have  noted  that  annual  U.S.  and
world oil production approximately follows a bell-shaped (Gaussian) curve. Analyses of histori-
cal  data  typically  predict  that  world  oil  production  will  peak  in  the  first  decade  of  the  21st
century,17,20,21,26–30 and that cumulative world oil production will range from 1.8 to 2.1 trillion
barrels.21  Note  that  Laherrère17,29,30  used  proprietary  reserves  data  for  non-U.S.  fields  from  a
consulting firm’s database to prepare his forecasts.

Forecasts  based  on  Gaussian  fits  to  historical  data  can  be  checked  readily  with  publicly
available data. Fig. 18.5 shows a Gaussian curve fit of world oil production data from the U.S.
EIA database. The fit is designed to match the most recent part of the production curve most
accurately.  This  gives  a  match  that  is  similar  to  Deffeyes.21  The  peak  oil-production  rate  in
Fig. 18.5 occurs in 2010, and cumulative oil production by year 2100 is a little less than 2.1
trillion barrels.

If  a  Gaussian  fit  of  historical  data  is  accepted  as  a  reasonable  method  for  projecting  oil
production,  future  oil-production  rates  can  be  estimated  as  a  percentage  of  the  oil-production
rate  in  the  year  2000.  Fig.  18.6  shows  this  estimate.  According  to  this  approach,  world  oil

production will decline by the middle of the 21st century to 50% of the 2000 world oil-produc-
tion rate. This forecast can be compared with Schollnberger’s Scenario C.

According to Scenario C, fossil fuel consumption will increase relative to its use today un-
til about the middle of the 21st century, when it will begin to decline (see Fig. 18.7). By the
end of the 21st century, fossil fuel consumption will be approximately 70% of what it is today.
Gas consumption will be considerably larger, while oil consumption will decline to approximate-
ly  one-half.  This  illustrates  the  range  of  uncertainty  in  existing  forecasts.  A  more  immediate
test of forecast validity is the peak of world oil production.

Forecasts of the world oil-production peak tend to shift as more historical data is accumulat-
ed. Laherrère29 points out that curve fits of historical data should be applied to activity that is
“unaffected by political or significant economic interference, to areas having a large number of
fields, and to areas of unfettered activity.” Furthermore, curve-fit forecasts work best when the
inflection point (or peak) has passed.

18.4 Changing Industry Policy
One  of  the  most  pressing  environmental  concerns  facing  the  world  today  is  global  climate
change. A purported cause of adverse global climate change is the greenhouse effect. Increas-
ing  levels  of  carbon  dioxide  and  other  greenhouse  gases  such  as  methane  in  the  atmosphere
absorb infrared radiation rather than letting it escape into space. The resulting atmospheric heat-
ing  is  attributed  to  excessive  emissions  of  carbon  dioxide  into  the  atmosphere.  Although  the
evidence  for  global  climate  change  and  its  implications  for  society  are  in  dispute,31–35  the
petroleum industry is considering methods for mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases.

One  way  to  reduce  the  emission  of  carbon  dioxide  into  the  atmosphere  is  to  collect  and
store carbon dioxide in oil and gas reservoirs as part of a process known as CO2 sequestration.

I-838

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. I

The goal of CO2 sequestration, as stated by the U.S. Dept. of Energy, is to provide economical-
ly  competitive  and  environmentally  safe  options  to  offset  all  projected  growth  in  baseline
emissions of greenhouse gases.36 Carbon sequestration programs are designed to reduce the cli-
matic  greenhouse  effect  by  collecting  and  storing  carbon  dioxide  in  nonatmospheric  sites.
Sequestration  of  greenhouse  gases  is  part  of  the  more  general  problem  of  sustainable
development.37,38

The goal of sustainable development is to integrate social and environmental concerns into
a development plan that optimizes economic profitability and value creation. One industry re-
sponse to environmental and social concerns in the context of sustainable development38 is the
“triple bottom line.” The three components of sustainable development and the three goals of
the triple bottom line are economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental protection. The
focus  of  the  triple  bottom  line  is  the  creation  of  long-term  shareholder  value  by  recognizing
that corporations are dependent on licenses provided by society to do business. In this regard,
major  energy  companies39,40  are  undertaking  the  task  of  developing  methods  for  determining
the extent of greenhouse gas emissions that result from their activities. This positive step indi-
cates  the  recognition  by  energy  companies  that  environmental  issues  are  legitimate  resource
management concerns.

One of the key elements of the triple bottom-line policy is the development and implemen-
tation of strategies that will enable the energy industry to meet future global energy needs and
environmental objectives. Studies show that energy consumption correlates positively to quality
of  life,13,40  with  quality  of  life  measured  by  such  factors  as  infant  mortality,  literacy,  life  ex-
pectancy, and university attendance. Cassedy and Grossman1 provide a good discussion of two
diametrically  opposed  ethical  positions  that  apply  to  the  global  distribution  of  energy.7  Their
discussion is outlined in the following section to illustrate some of the issues that may affect
the business decisions of global energy industry organizations.

18.5 Ethical Issues in Energy Distribution
According to Cassedy and Grossman,1 future energy distribution will be affected by the distri-
bution  of  energy  between  nations  with  a  large  per-capita  energy  base  and  those  without.
Traditional ethics would favor a policy of helping those nations without energy resources, but
opinions differ on how to proceed. Two of the more important ethical positions being consid-
ered are “lifeboat ethics” and “spaceship ethics.”

Proponents  of  lifeboat  ethics  oppose  the  transfer  of  wealth  by  charitable  means.  In  this
view, the more developed industrial nations are considered rich boats and the less developed,
overcrowded nations are poor boats. The rich boats should not give the poor boats energy be-
cause  their  help  would  discourage  the  poor  boats  from  making  difficult  choices  about  issues
such  as  population  control  and  investment  in  infrastructure.  Lifeboat  ethics  is  a  “tough  love”
position.

Proponents  of  spaceship  ethics  argue  that  everyone  is  a  passenger  on  spaceship  Earth.  In
this view, some passengers travel in first class while others are in steerage. A more equitable
distribution of energy is needed because it is morally just and it will prevent revolts and social
turmoil.  Thus,  the  wealthy  should  transfer  part  of  their  resources  to  the  poor  for  both  moral
and  practical  reasons.  If  the  size  of  the  resource  is  increased,  the  need  for  sacrifice  will  be
lessened.

18.6 Implications for Engineers
In  an  attempt  to  respond  to  market  realities,  some  oil  and  gas  companies  and  electric  power
companies are beginning to transform themselves into energy companies. The trend is expected
to continue,13,15,41 and these companies will be pioneers in the emerging energy industry.

Improvements in technology and an increasing reliance on information require a high level
of technical expertise to acquire resources on behalf of society. To meet the technical demands,

Chapter 18—The 21st Century Energy Mix

I-839

Walesh42 predicts that engineers will need periods of dedicated learning or retraining between
periods of full-time employment throughout their careers. Engineers in energy companies will
need to understand and appreciate the role of alternative energy components in the energy mix.
They will need to be able to identify and solve problems in the acquisition and environmental-
ly acceptable use of several energy components. This will give engineers additional flexibility
and  help  them  thrive  in  an  energy  industry  that  is  evolving  from  an  industry  dominated  by
fossil fuels to an industry working with many energy sources.

18.7 Conclusions
Fossil  fuel  (e.g.,  coal,  oil,  and  gas)  was  the  fuel  of  choice  during  the  last  half  of  the  20th
century.  The  21st  century  will  see  a  gradual  transition  from  the  dominance  of  fossil  fuels  in
the  current  energy  mix  to  a  more  balanced  energy  portfolio.43  The  goal  is  to  integrate  social
and environmental concerns into a development plan that optimizes economic profitability and
value creation as the world undergoes the transition from the use of nonrenewable fossil fuels
to the use of renewable fuels and the creation of a sustainable, secure energy infrastructure.

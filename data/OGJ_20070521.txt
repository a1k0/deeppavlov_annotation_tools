Bodman to Europe: rethink Russia’s line proposal
US Sec. of Energy Samuel Bodman has criticized Russia’s plans
to construct a new pipeline from Turkmenistan to Europe, saying
that Europe needs diversity of suppliers.
Speaking at a press conference during a meeting of the International Energy Agency in Paris, Bodman said the pipeline, which
would pass through Kazakhstan and along the Caspian coast into
Russia towards Europe, would “fly in the face of what is needed,
which is diversity of supply.” He added, “The Europeans should
take due note of this and adjust their response accordingly.”
On May 12, the presidents of Russia, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan struck a preliminary deal to restore the existing Caspian shore
gas pipeline and build a new pipeline along the Caspian Coast which
would circumvent Uzbekistan (see related story, p. 10). The nations
met at a summit in the Turkmen Caspian port of Turkmenbashi.
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the upgraded
and new infrastructure is expected to boost capacity by 20 billion
cu m/year by 2012. However, the deal has prompted fears among
European, US, and Chinese circles of losing control over future
potential Central Asian gas supplies to Russia. The agreement also
increases Russia’s leverage with the European Union as the EU continues to seek out other suppliers and reduce its reliance on Russian
gas following strains in their relationship.
For Russia the deal signifies a major triumph over the rival 8 billion cu m/year Nabucco project, which would bring Central Asian
gas across the Caspian to Europe. However, Turkmenistan President
Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov has not ruled out supplying
Turkmen gas to Nabucco.
Russia, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan hope to sign final agreements by September for their projects and expect work to start in
first half 2008. One of the key outstanding commercial issues is
whether Turkmenistan can demand more money from Russia for
Turkmen gas which Russia imports to meet its European export
obligations and sells for a higher price.

Oman, Iran sign oil, gas cooperation agreement
Oman and Iran have signed a memorandum of understanding
to jointly develop oil and gas fields, for Iran to export gas to Oman,
and to establish joint petrochemical projects.
Iran and Oman also will establish a joint company to carry out
oil projects, according to the MOU. The nations hope to implement
their agreement within the next 4 months.
Oman’s Commerce and Industry Minister Maqbool bin Ali bin
Sultan and visiting Iranian Petroleum Minister Vaziri Hamaneh
signed the agreement May 15 in Oman.
Iran is expected to export 1 billion cu m/day of gas to Oman either
by pipeline or as LNG, according to local Omani and Iranian reports.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Mahmoud Zirakchian Zadeh, managing director of Iranian Offshore Oil Co., was quoted as saying, “Specifying the price of export
gas to Oman needs to be further scrutinized.” He said the two
countries have also agreed to develop Hengam gas field, which is
shared between the two Persian Gulf states.

Domestic Petroleum Council changes name
The Domestic Petroleum Council, a trade association representing large US independent producers, has been renamed American
Exploration & Production Council.
Duane Radtke, the group’s chairman and also president and
chief executive officer of Dominion Exploration & Production Inc.,
said the new name reflects activities of the 24 members. At its creation in 1975, the council represented midsized companies of any
type, including refiners. Radtke said it has included only E&P companies for many years.
In addition, he said, many members have operations outside
the US.
The group has adopted the abbreviation AXPC. William F. Whitsitt remains president.

IOGCC, EPA sign environmental agreement
The Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission and the US Environmental Protection Agency signed a memorandum of understanding to outline the two groups’ environmental regulatory oversight of oil and natural gas exploration and production activities.
The MOU was signed May 7 at the start of IOGCC’s midyear
issues summit in Point Clear, Ala. It replaces and renews the MOU
signed in December 2002 and renewed in March 2005. This agreement’s timeframe has been extended to 3 years from the previous
2-year expiration.
The MOU’s purpose is “to improve regulatory cooperation
among the states and EPA in a manner that promotes protection
of the environment in a cost-effective manner, minimizes duplication, increases efficiencies, enables the exchange of information
and expertise, and increases communication,” it said.
Some of the objectives outlined in the agreement include renewing a joint taskforce that will:
• Improve communication between EPA and the states.
• Foster environmental protection based on each group’s missions, responsibilities, and authorities.
• Form subgroups to address concurrent jurisdiction between
EPA and the states.
“In some instances the states and EPA have concurrent jurisdiction
relating to a host of oil and gas regulatory efforts,” the MOU said. “In
other instances, the states and EPA have independent authorities that
may be complementary when effectively coordinated.” ✦

Petrobras ﬁnds gas with Espirito Santo basin well
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has reached 130-m
thick gas-saturated sandstone reservoirs at 3,378 m with its
6-ESS-168 well in Camarupim offshore field in the Espirito
Santo basin.
The well, which was drilled in the Espirito Santo Sea in
the BM-ES-5 exploratory concession, is being drilled nearly
37 km off Espirito Santo in 763 m of water.
Petrobras, with a 65% stake, operates the block in partnership with El Paso Corp., which holds the remaining 35%.
These preliminary results confirm that Camarupim field
extends to the north; commercial viability of the field was
declared in late 2006 (OGJ Online, Dec. 29, 2006). The field
was discovered with the 4-ESS-164A well, which detected
112 m of gas-containing reservoirs.
Talisman unit hits pay with three wells in Alaska
Talisman Energy Inc. subsidiary FEX LP has completed a
three-well drilling program in the northwest planning area
of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.
The well sites, about 60 miles southeast of Barrow, were
drilled using Doyon-Akita Arctic Wolf and Nabors Industries
Ltd. 14E drilling rigs.
All three wells—Aklaqyaaq-1, Amaguq-2, and Aklaq6—encountered hydrocarbon-bearing sandstones in several
formations, based on log analysis and strong gas and oil
shows, including oil staining and free oil in the drilling mud
in one of the wells.
One well was plugged and abandoned and the other two
were suspended.
The abandoned well is believed to be “subcommercial
given current infrastructure,” Talisman said, adding that
recently acquired high-fold seismic will assist in analyzing
this well.
The two suspended wells encountered more than 225 ft
of net hydrocarbon-bearing sandstones. Plans are to evaluate
these wells during the next drilling season when longer-term
test equipment is mobilized to the field area.
The initial estimate of contingent resources present in
these formations is 300-400 million bbl net to Talisman.
Additionally, there is significant follow-up potential on many
similar structures on Talisman’s acreage if commercial productivity is proved, the company said.
FEX holds 60-80% working interest in all the wells and
Petro-Canada (Alaska) Inc. holds the remaining interests.

levels on the block.
The well, drilled to TD 4,860 m, is in 2,010 m of water
and is the deepest-water well on the block. Block interest
holders are Reliance 90% and Niko Resources Inc., Calgary,
10%.

Esso Australia farms into Bonaparte Gulf permit
Esso Australia has farmed into Bonaparte Gulf permit WA318-P off northern Australia. The permit is wholly owned by
Drillsearch Energy Ltd. of Sydney.
The permit contains the prospective ready-to-drill Marina
prospect, a four-way dip closed anticline about 40 km west
of Eni SPA’s Blacktip gas-condensate field, now under development.
Esso has agreed to pay 85% of the costs of drilling Marina-1 in exchange for a 65% working interest and operatorship of the permit. Drillsearch will pay 15% of the well costs
and retain 35% interest in the permit.
The Premium Wilcraft jack up rig has been contracted to
drill the well in September.
The permit contains a strong lead called Balzac to the
northeast of Marina that is a salt-related feature similar to
the nearby Santos Ltd.-held Tern and Petrel gas fields to the
east.
A 3D survey of 100 sq km will be run over the prospect
to firm up a drilling prospect.
The ExxonMobil farm-in marks the company’s first return
to northern Australian waters after pulling out of the Timor
Sea in the late 1980s.

Hydro, Anadarko to develop Peregrino oil ﬁeld
Hydro ASA and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. have received
permission from the Agencia Nacional do Petroleo for plans
to develop Peregrino oil field, which lies in 100 m of water
about 85 km off Brazil.
Under a $2.5 billion investment plan, the field will be
developed with a floating production, storage, and offloading
vessel, two drilling platforms, 30 production wells, and seven
water-injection wells. The partners are drilling a delineation
well in the southwest extension of the field and expect to
produce 100,000 b/d of oil by 2010 (OGJ Online, Apr. 2,
2007).
Maersk Contractors will lease and operate the FPSO, and
Kiewit Offshore Services Ltd. will supply the drilling platforms. An agreement also has been reached with Subsea 7 for
the engineering, procurement, construction, and installation

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Al-Naimi: Saudi Arabia to increase gas production Lanta development plan, which was approved by the Thai Energy
Saudi Arabia’s Oil Minister Ali bin Ibrahim Al-Naimi said his
country plans to increase its natural gas production in order to
meet demand growth from domestic industries.
“We are planning to add in the next 10 years 100 tcf to our
current reserves of gas,” Al-Naimi said in Riyadh at a conference
on Saudi economic development. He said the gas expansion would
be an integral part of the country’s National Project to Develop
Industrial Areas.
“Our future gas production and development plans will meet
current and future need for gas in the kingdom...now we are entering a new period of developing petrochemical industries and
gas exploitation which will have a big impact on the economy,”
Al-Naimi said.
Domestic gas sales are expected to rise by 40% through 2012
from the current level of around 7 bcfd, Al-Naimi said, adding
that demand growth would come from industries producing such
commodities as cars, construction materials, household appliances,
and metals.
To produce the additional gas, Al-Naimi said his country plans
to drill 186 gas exploration wells and 332 gas development wells
by 2012—the same year that production of gas will start at the
offshore Karan gas field which, he said, is expected to support domestic gas sales of 770 MMcfd.

Chevron to start production from Thai gulf block
A group of companies led by Chevron Offshore (Thailand)
Ltd. will start oil production from Block G4/43 in the northern
Gulf of Thailand by yearend. The block is 125 miles south of
Bangkok.
Production of an initial 6,000-8,000 b/d of oil will come from
Lanta field, one of the two oil and gas-bearing structures found in
the 9,686-sq-km tract, which lies in less than 250 ft of water off
Prachuab Khiri Khan province.
The Lanta No. 1 exploration well and the Lanta No. 2 appraisal
well were drilled 3 years ago (OGJ Online, July 22, 2004). Since
the concession was awarded in July 2003, six exploration wells
have been drilled in the Lanta and Similan structures.
The group is preparing to drill a development well as part of the

ExxonMobil to pay for California air violations
ExxonMobil Corp. agreed to pay $250,000 in penalties to the
South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) for excess
emissions on Mar. 22 from its 130,000 b/d Torrance, Calif., refinery, AQMD confirmed May 10.
AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Orange County,
Calif., and the urban portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San
Bernardino counties.
A failure in a sulfur-recovery unit prompted shutdowns of other
refining equipment and the release of nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, and other substances, ExxonMobil said.

Ministry, according to Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production
PLC, a partner.
PTTEP has exercised its right to raise its stake in Block G4/43 to
21.375% from 15% following the declaration of commerciality of
Lanta. As a result, Chevron’s share in the block was reduced to 51%
from 60%, Mitsui Oil Exploration Co.’s holding drops to 21.25%
from 25%, and Bangkok-based Palang Sophon Two Ltd. holds the
remaining 6.375%.

Talks continue for Cepu block output start date
ExxonMobil Corp. and Indonesia’s state-owned PT Pertamina
are involved in discussions with government authorities aimed at
resolving their differences and advancing the start of oil production from Indonesia’s Cepu block.
Peter J. Coleman, president and general manager of ExxonMobil
Oil Indonesia Inc., said the two firms are seeking a way to meet
the government’s request to begin oil production at the block by
yearend 2008, about 2 years ahead of schedule.
Coleman said the two sides are in discussions with BPMigas, the
country’s upstream oil and gas regulatory agency, as well as Lemigas, the government’s oil and gas research and development center,
in order to meet the government’s target.
Indonesia wants to increase the country’s oil production by
30% to 1.3 million b/d by 2009 from the current 1 million b/d.
To meet that goal, the government has urged the Cepu partners to
speed up operations.
Coleman, who said he understands the aim of boosting production, also suggested that the government should assess if earlier
production is economically viable given the technical and social
problems now facing the two companies.
In January, ExxonMobil officially advised Indonesia of its desire
for a 10-month delay for oil production from Cepu in Central Java
from its initial target of first quarter 2009 (OGJ Online, Jan. 30,
2007).
Indonesian officials had said earlier that month that Cepu block
in the border area of Central and East Java would start producing oil
in first-quarter 2009, one quarter later than originally scheduled
(OGJ Online, Jan 4, 2007). ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
Also related to the Mar. 22 incident, ExxonMobil agreed to
spend up to $2 million for a supplemental environmental project
to cut CO2 emissions, volatile organic compounds, and other pollutants from the Torrance refinery, AQMD said.
The major agreed to pay an additional $150,000 penalty for 23
notices of violations issued by AQMD that were unrelated to the
Mar. 22 incident.

130,000 b/d of light, sweet synthetic crude that could come on
stream as early as 2013-14, and Phase II would increase total bitumen processing capacity to over 200,000 b/d.
“Constructing the project in two separate phases will allow Total
to match upgrading capacity with upstream bitumen production,”
said Michel Borrell, president of Total E&P Canada. “Early in the
next decade the proposed Joslyn North mine project should be
up and running in the Athabasca oil sands area.” The Joslyn North
mine project, currently under review by regulators, is expected to
produce 100,000 b/d of bitumen. Future development could increase production to about 200,000 b/d.
Total E&P Canada Ltd. is operator of the Joslyn lease 65 km
northwest of Fort McMurray in the Athabasca oil sands region. Joslyn, in which Total has an 84% stake, is expected to produce 2 billion bbl of bitumen over 30 years. Steam-assisted gravity drainage

its 309,000 b/d Pulau Ayer Chawan off the southwestern coast of
Singapore.
ExxonMobil said the fire has been extinguished, and the Singapore Civil Defense Force was investigating the cause of the blaze.
Meanwhile, ExxonMobil said the 115,000 b/d unit would not resume production “until it is safe to do so.”
A company spokesperson couldn’t provide an estimate on how
long the unit would be out of action, but said the refinery’s second
185,000 b/d unit continues to operate.
Industry observers said the decision to restart the damaged unit
will likely be left to Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower, which undertakes its own investigation when there are fatalities involved.
They also said any extended closure, required by authorities investigating the deaths, would affect the gasoline market, as regional
supplies are tight.

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Kazakhstan, Russia join in oil pipeline projects
Kazakhstan’s president Nursultan Nazarbayev said his country
will join with Russia in two pipeline projects aimed at nearly doubling the amount of oil shipped westward from the Central Asian
nation to international markets.
“I discussed in detail with President [Vladimir] Putin the question of increasing the capacity of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium
from 23 million [tonnes/year] to 40 million tonnes/year,” said
Nazarbayev, referring to the existing 1,500-km pipeline that extends from Kazakhstan’s Tengiz oil field to Russia’s Black Sea port
of Novorossiysk.
“The extra 17 million tonnes[/year] may go to Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline,” Nazarbayez said, referring to a planned 280-km
route backed and shared by Russia (51%), Greece (24.5%), and Bulgaria (24.5%) that will carry crude from Bulgaria’s Black Sea port of
Burgas to the Greek port of Alexandroupolis on the Aegean.
An agreement on the Burgas-Alexandroupolis line was signed by
the three partner countries in Athens on Mar. 15, and the Russian
government approved a draft law on May 10 that would govern the
agreement to be sent to the Russian parliament for ratification. The
line will initially carry 35 million tonnes/year, rising eventually to
50 million tonnes/year.
Under the agreement signed in Athens, Russia’s 51% stake will
be owned by a consortium comprised of OAO Transneft 33.4%,
along with Rosneft 33.3%, and GazpromNeft 33.3%. Transneft also
will hold the operating rights of the line, which will receive oil
at Burgas carried by tankers from the Russian ports of Novorossiysk and Tuapse as well as from the Ukrainian ports of Odessa and
Pyvdenny, both outlets for Russian oil.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The Burgas-Alexandroupolis line has been touted as an alternative to ships traversing the busy Bosporus Straits, something that
Turkey has expressed concern over for years.
In April, however, Turkish authorities launched construction of
a rival 700-km oil pipeline linking its Black Sea port of Samsun to
its Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in the south. As with the BurgasAlexandropolis line, the new Turkish project is being touted as a
new energy route and one that bypasses the busy Bosporus.

Kinder Morgan to expand Texas pipeline
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP plans to build a $72 million
natural gas pipeline to bring supplies from East Texas to Houston
and Beaumont.
The proposed 58-mile, 24-in. pipeline will have multiple interconnections and will link the Kinder Morgan Tejas system in Houston County to the Kinder Morgan Texas system in Polk County near
Goodrich, Tex.
The line will have an initial capacity of 225 MMcfd using existing horsepower and will be expandable to 400 MMcfd with additional horsepower.
Firm transportation for most of the initial capacity has been secured via a long-term binding agreement with CenterPoint Energy
Services Inc.
Texas Intrastate Pipeline Group Pres.Tom Martin said the amount
of drilling occurring along KMP’s system in East Texas, including
initial testing of the deep Bossier play in Houston and surrounding counties, were primary factors in deciding to add the pipeline,
which will more than double capacity on Kinder Morgan’s Tejas
intrastate pipeline system. ✦

Arguing over cosmetics
US President George W. Bush doesn’t know how
much gasoline Americans should use. US senators and congressional representatives have no
supernatural insight that the president lacks on this
subject and thus don’t know how much gasoline
Americans should use, either. Yet Bush has advanced
his plan for cutting US gasoline use by 20% in 10
years, and lawmakers are debating tactics rather
than the merits of national consumption targets.
To be sure, the president’s goal, announced in
his state-of-the-union address in January, is vacuous. What makes 20% below some random baseline a reasonable objective?

Bingaman (D-NM) exposed the dark core of current energy policy-making when he responded to
Bush’s executive order by saying, “The absence of
any standards in today’s announcement is a reason
why Americans will be looking to Congress for
stronger leadership on energy policy.” The prevailing assumption in Washington, DC, must be that
Americans want their government to tell them how
much and what forms of energy to use.
Can this be so? Do Americans really want to surrender economic choice to arbitrary consumption
targets? Do Americans want to spend more than
they should on motor fuels whose lone supposed

Aging infrastructures in critical pipelines, producing and processing, have
created a need for information technology and products to extend the lifetime of
equipment. The number of onshore and oӽshore drilling rigs in the region has
increased dramatically over the last several years. At the processing end, reﬁneries
have greatly increased operating rates because of increasing demand, inducing
pressure on the infrastructure and creating an even greater need for inspection,

THE OIL MARKET’S
HARD CHARGERS—2

India is the world’s second most
populous country (after China). Its
population is projected to increase to
1.46 billion by 2030 from 1.09 billion
in 2006. This expansion means an increasing number of energy consumers.
India’s energy outlook is further
complicated by its robust economic
growth. After years of pursuing economic policies based on import substitution and state ownership
of key industries, India’s
government has embarked
on a series of economic reforms since the mid-1990s.
This economic liberalization includes a relaxation
of restrictions on foreign
ownership in some sectors and privatization of some industrial enterprises.
These reform policies are considered
the main drivers for the nation’s economic growth.
India is projected to maintain its
impressive economic growth in the
foreseeable future. During 2003-30,
the world economy is expected to grow
by 3.1%/year, while India’s economy’s
growth rate will be 5.8%. Without reliable and affordable energy, India will
not be able to sustain high economic
growth. Its fast-growing economy and
rapidly increasing population raise serious concern about the nation’s energy
security.
Indigenous production has failed
to keep pace with rising demand, and
the already large gap between energy
production and consumption is growing larger. Because this skyrocketing
energy demand has been increasingly
met by imports, India is growing more
dependent on and vulnerable to foreign
energy supplies.

India steers new course
toward energy reform

About this series
China and India have charged into the
oil market with consumption growth
well above global average rates and with
keen interest in securing supply.This
article examines India’s energy needs
and its approaches to meeting them.The
author profiled China in the first part
of this two-part series (OGJ, Apr. 23,
2007, p. 20).

Energy mix
India currently is the world’s fifth
largest energy consumer—after the US,
China, Japan, and Russia. Like other
major energy consumers, India seeks
to diversify its energy mix. The nation’s
energy sector is largely dominated by
coal, followed by oil, and to a lesser
extent natural gas. New Delhi plans to

reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by
expanding its reliance on nuclear power.
India holds the world’s fourth largest proved coal reserves (after the US,
Russia, and China) and is the world’s
third largest coal producer and consumer (after the US and China). Coal
satisfies more than half of India’s energy
demand, particularly in the electric
power generation sector. Coal production is controlled almost entirely by the
government.
Oil accounts for about one third of
India’s energy consumption. Most of
the oil and its products are consumed
in the transportation, commercial,
industrial, and domestic sectors. India
holds limited proved oil reserves, with
only 0.5% of the world’s total. The
country accounts for only about 0.9%
of total world production but about
3% of worldwide consumption. India
consequently imports 70% of its oil
supply. Given stagnant production and
a high depletion rate, India is expected
to continue importing an incrementally
large proportion of its oil supply.
The search for oil in India started in
the 1860s when the country was under
British occupation. Upon independence,
the government realized the importance
of oil in consolidating its political and
economic development. In the mid1950s the government set up the Oil
and Natural Gas Directorate to develop
natural resources. Later, the directorate
was elevated into a commission with
additional powers. These institutional
initiatives underscore the government’s
intention to maintain a dominant role
in the oil industry. The intentions became clearer in 1959, when Oil India
Ltd. (OIL) was created, with substantial
government ownership and control.
In the following decade, the government tried unsuccessfully to attract
private investment to oil exploration
and development. But private companies
hesitated to participate in India’s oil industry for two reasons: the low recovery
rates and uncertain political climate.
In line with the state-led economic
strategy, India in the mid-1970s nationalized the few private and foreign

Natural gas
Like oil, India holds limited proved
gas reserves—only about 0.6% of the
world’s total—but the balance between
gas production and consumption is a
little better than that of oil. India’s share
of world gas production is 1.1%, while
its share of world consumption is 1.3%.
India is a relative newcomer to the
use of gas. However, in the last few
years, gas has become the fastest growing source of energy in the country. Its
share of the nation’s energy consumption rose to about 7% in the mid-2000s
from 2.5% in the 1980s. By 2030, this
share is projected to rise to more than
10%. The surge in gas consumption is
due to its being a less polluting fuel
than coal or oil.
In order to meet growing demand
for gas, the government has invested
substantial resources in exploration and
development. Since the early 2000s
several important new discoveries have

been announced. These include a discovery in the Krishna-Godavari basin off
Andhra Pradesh along India’s southeast
coast, another one off Orissa, and a third
one off Gujarat. However, India will
grow more dependent on imported gas.
New Delhi has considered two options for importing gas: LNG and pipelines. The nation’s first major gas import
deal was effected in January 2004
with the start of deliveries to the Dahej
terminal from Qatar’s Rasgas LNG plant.
India’s Foreign Investment Promotion
Board actually approved 12 prospective
LNG import terminal projects in the
mid-1990s, but this plan was considered unrealistic because the combined
capacity would have exceeded the most
optimistic demand projections. Consequently, the government froze approvals of new LNG terminals in 2001. By
2009-10, Gas Authority of India Ltd.

Nuclear power
Nuclear energy is seen as critical to
fostering India’s economic growth because of the environmental, geological,
financial, and geostrategic limitations
on the development and importation of
fossil fuels. Nuclear-energy generation,
however, has fallen woefully short of
projections made in the 1970s, when
it was thought that 10% of the nation’s
electric power would be nuclear by
2000. In 2002, nuclear power constituted only about 2% of the electricity
generated in India, far less than in many
other nations.2
India’s nuclear power industry
received a boost from the US in the
mid-2000s, however. In July 2005
Washington and New Delhi reached an
agreement under which India agreed
to take several steps to demonstrate
its commitment to being a respon-

oil companies operating in the country.
In addition, the Administered Pricing
Mechanism (APM) was introduced to
set the price of petroleum products.
These steps ensured a dominant government role in the oil industry and
eliminated private and foreign competition. As a result, the oil sector suffered
from inefficiency, and production levels
became stagnant. In response, the New
Delhi government decided to change
course and adopted a new measure
known as the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) in order to again
attract foreign investment.
Most of India’s oil reserves are located in the Mumbai High, Upper Assam,
Cambay, Krishna-Godavari, and Cauvery
basins. The offshore Mumbai High field
is by far India’s largest producing field.
Production from these reservoirs has
proven insufficient to meet the country’s skyrocketing demand. The nation’s
oil consumption is projected to rise at a
rate of 2.4%/year by 2030 to 4.5 million b/d from 2.3 million b/d in 2003.
Meanwhile, production will rise to 1.4
million b/d from 800,000 b/d during
the same time.

Proximity to several major gas
producers adds financial and strategic incentives to the pipeline option.
All pipeline options rely on difficult
negotiations with neighboring countries. Four pipeline schemes have been
under consideration for several years

nity to promote dialogue between the
energy producing nations of Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and
Uzbekistan and energy consuming nations of China, India, Japan, and South
Korea. Given Russia’s massive hydrocarbon resources, India has expressed
strong interest in investing in and working with Russian companies. India’s
ONGC, for example, owns a 20% stake
in Russia’s Sakhalin-1 project.
Like other energy consuming nations, India tries to diversify the sources
of its oil and gas supplies. However, the
bulk of India’s imported oil comes from
the Persian Gulf. The top five oil exporters to India are Saudi Arabia, Nigeria,
Kuwait, Iran, and Iraq. This close cooperation between the two sides reflects
long-standing historical, cultural, and
strategic ties.
Two recent highly-publicized developments have demonstrated these close
ties between India and energy producers in the Persian Gulf. In January 2006
King Abdullah visited India on his first
trip outside the Middle East since becoming the Saudi ruler in August 2005.
This was also the first visit by a Saudi
king to India since 1955. The kingdom
does not want to be too dependent on
exporting its oil to a few Western markets and seeks to diversify its oil export
destinations. Accordingly, the bulk of
Saudi oil is shipped to China and India
under its so-called “Look-East Policy.”
The other important event was the
convening of a meeting in New Delhi
in January 2005 of major Asian energy
consumers (China, India, Japan, Malaysia, and South Korea) and major Persian
Gulf producers (Iran, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE) The
goal was to foster energy partnership
between the two sides and address
mutual concerns about security of supply and demand. A second meeting was
held in Riyadh on May 2, 2007.

The way ahead
For the next several years four projections can be made regarding India’s
energy sector. First, the fundamental
shift in India’s overall economy and
24

its energy industry away from central
planning to a more competitive and
market-based system is likely to continue. India’s membership in the World
Trade Organization since January 1995
reflects and reinforces this trend.
Second, booming economic growth
in India and other Asian economies has
turned Asia into the center of gravity for
energy consumption. The fact that India
and its Asian neighbors lack sufficient
indigenous energy resources means
that they will grow more dependent on
foreign supplies.
Third, the International Energy
Agency projects that non-OPEC production will be flat in the coming few
years. Most of the incremental demand
for oil will be met by OPEC members,
particularly those in the Persian Gulf.
Fourth, India and other Asian countries need long-term energy supply
security.
On the other hand, Persian Gulf
producers need to secure markets for
their oil and gas. This emerging “interdependence” between the two sides
would serve their mutual interests and
would contribute to the overall stability
of global energy markets. ✦

The staff member, senior analyst
Joanne Shore, told reporters following
the hearing that EIA also monitors refiners’ financial results and their statements
to financial analysts. “We saw some
projects pulled back or delayed due to
sharp increases in costs and uncertainties due to alternative fuels,” she said.
Shore said one of the biggest reductions in plans to add capacity came
from Valero Energy Corp., the nation’s
largest independent refiner and marketer. “It had very aggressive plans in
2006,” Shore said.
Via phone from Valero’s headquarters

the administration of President George
W. Bush should explore measures that
would require refiners to maintain a
minimum level of gasoline and other
product inventories.
“Such a system exists in Europe and
was able to provide critical gasoline to
the US during production shortfalls that
occurred following the 2005 hurricanes. Should similar or worse disasters
occur in the future, our ability to immediately move gasoline to areas that
need it will again be critical,” he said.
When Bingaman asked if refiners
could be required to report planned outages to the federal government, Caruso
said it would be difficult to manage.
“Even in planned outages, they may find

the problem is more extensive than they
anticipated. So even if they did report, I
don’t know if we’d have enough information to say whether they should proceed or wait,” the EIA administrator said.
Sankey also was skeptical of calls
by some federal lawmakers to give the
Federal Trade Commission authority to
investigate oil product price manipulation allegations. “We believe there have
been enough investigations by Republicans and Democrats to show that there’s
no price-gouging taking place nationwide. There may be some rogues doing
it regionally. But the fact is that refiners
are making so much money legitimately
that they don’t need to do it,” he said.
“There’s also great concern that all

these gasoline investigations which are
being proposed will lead to regulations
which would make new investments
uneconomic,” Sankey added.
When Wyden and some other committee members asked why more investments haven’t been made in refining
with profits so high the past few years,
the Deutsche Bank analyst said that the
past 3 years of strong earnings followed
about 3 decades of miserable results.
“If you look at how the stock market
values refiners, they are still among the
cheapest investments at about 5 times
earnings. It’s obvious that investors
believe economically attractive refining
conditions aren’t permanent,” Sankey
said. ✦

While rising gasoline prices are a
burden to consumers, they cannot be

alternatives; reduce demand and expand

‘No longer cheap’
Bruno Lescouer, senior executive
vice-president of Elétricité de France SA,
said that Europe’s demand for electricity is expected to increase 50%, and the
share of gas used in its generation is
forecast to more than double by 2030,
raising the continent’s dependence on
imported energy to 70%.
“Gas is no longer the cheap technology it was in the 1990s. Prices have
recently tripled, and supplies are limited and in faraway countries,” he said,
adding that the situation has generated renewed interest in nuclear power
across Europe.
“There is no easy way out. It will
take years to find other supplies,” observed Sead Vilogorac, senior economic
affairs officer in the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe’s
sustainable energy division, during a
luncheon conversation with reporters.
Lugar noted that in the past 2 years,
Ukraine and Belarus each confronted
gas supply threats from Russia that Russian officials said were simply market
matters.
“Some NATO members said the organization was not designed to handle
something like this when I raised the
point at a recent summit. But there are
no major new storage and transmission
facilities in Europe. There was talk of
Kazakhstan putting a pipeline beneath
the Caspian Sea, but when the announcement came this past weekend,
it went another direction and into Russia,” the US lawmaker said.
“So there’s a lot of whispering taking
place in many governments on an issue
that could fray the NATO alliance,” he
added.
Vilogorac said he was not particularly surprised that Russia and Kazakhstan
reached that gas pipeline agreement.
“There’s a long history—decades—of
cooperation between the two countries
so it was easier to develop,” he said.

Washington, DC.
This raises a question of whether
future processing investments will
be confined to areas where demand
is growing. “It’s possible that future
product suppliers will have to meet
more stringent emissions requirements in North America while
leaving a bigger carbon footprint
abroad,” Irving said.
He still has questions about nonpetroleum motor fuel alternatives,
however. “The biggest one is whether
all the new plant investments that are
being encouraged are moving ahead
before their life cycles have been
determined,” he said.

Series of ﬁrsts
Irving Oil has benefited from
moving quickly. When it built its
refinery in 1960, it was in a unique
line formation on 780 acres that allowed for expansions in 1971, 1974,
and 2000. The current crude capacity

is 250,000 b/cd. Irving was the first
Canadian refiner to produce highoctane gasoline without lead additives. It offered low-sulfur gasoline 5
years before requirements for the fuel
took effect. It was the first Canadian
refinery to produce ultralow-sulfur
gasoline and diesel fuel.
One result, said Irving, was that
Irving Oil supplied CARB-formula
gasoline to California as many refineries there were still reconfiguring
operations.
It also began seeking permits for
an LNG terminal in the late 1990s,
which its CEO said puts it ahead of
many competitors. And it has several
thousand acres of industrially zoned
land next to one of North America’s
few true deepwater ports so it can
build a second refinery.

No NIMBY here
The company emphasizes local public involvement as it grows,
Irving said. “There’s strong local concern about environmental impacts.
There’s also a surprising amount of
interest in where a project fits globally. People in New Brunswick seem
to think they’ll have more influence
if a project is close to where they live.
It’s the opposite of the ‘not-in-mybackyard’ attitude you hear about.”
He suggested that refiners adopt
new definitions of what constitutes
reliable supplies. “Petroleum still constitutes 50% of all energy consumed,
so our industry shouldn’t be let off
the hook in considering ways to better meet future demand,” he said.
As for dealing with greenhouse
gas emissions, said Irving, “Why wait
for regulations? If we can do it, why
not get on with it?” ✦

In the meantime, said Sultan, countries and governments are watching
with interest as Qatar follows an LNG
export model that could be replicated
elsewhere. Instead of awarding each of
its five projects to the highest bidder, it

large multinational firm for each, and

IEA members seek energy security, sustainability
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
Ministers of the International Energy
Agency’s member countries, having
confronted growing energy challenges since their last meeting in 2005,
gathered in Paris May 14-15 to identify
methods of achieving energy security
and sustainability, which are “absolutely
paramount,” said IEA Executive Director
Claude Mandil.
At a press conference that concluded
the meeting, Mandil said, “Both must
be taken care of simultaneously.”
Members also called upon the organization to deepen its global reach. “Actions within our own borders will never
be enough to achieve a truly sustainable energy future,” said the ministers,
who welcomed IEA’s reinforced work
with major non-IEA energy consumers and producers as “essential partners
in achieving a secure and sustainable
energy future and combating energy
poverty.”
The ministers want IEA to promote
across the globe what it advocates for
its own members—the development of
efficiency goals and action plans that
identify sustainable, least-costly policies
for combating energy-related climate
change.
That will require development and
deployment of new technologies,
among them carbon sequestration capture and storage to promote clean coal
and the encouragement of research
and development to reduce the costs of
advanced biofuels, solar power, hydrogen fuel cells, and electric vehicles.
Energy technology collaboration with

major emerging economies must be
enhanced, they said, both bilaterally
and through IEA’s technology network.
However, several leaders denounced
the environmentally unfriendly way
some biofuels were being produced in
a number of countries. Each particular
way of producing ethanol must be assessed to determine if it is good for the
environment, they said. Brazil’s method
using sugar cane was considered the
most environmentally friendly because
less fuel is used. An IEA delegation
will head to Brazil shortly to study its
technology.
IEA is anticipating that second-generation biofuels will be ready in a few
years, not decades, said Mandil.

Gas cartel?

Concerning the recurring topic of
the formation of a gas cartel much like
OPEC’s being formed, Norway’s Minister Odd Roger Enoksen, who chaired
the Ministerial meeting, and Australia’s
Deputy Secretary Resources, Energy, and
Industry, John Ryan, pointed out that
they were major gas exporters—Australia by next year would be the third
ranking LNG exporter worldwide—and
did not see a gas OPEC emerging. “But
open dialogue would be welcomed as
for oil markets,” they agreed.
In any case, unlike oil, gas can
more easily be replaced by other fuels,
pointed out Mandil, so a gas OPEC
would not be a threat for the world
energy market. He also revealed that at

China’s crude
production rising
slower than demand
China reached production of 3.6
million b/d of oil, 50 billion cu m of
natural gas, and 5.8 million b/d of
refining capacity by 2005, Facts Global
Energy Group (FGE) reported in a May
research paper. The group includes Fesharaki Associates Consulting & Technical
Services Inc. (FACTS) of Honolulu.
China’s 2000 crude oil output was
3.24 million b/d, and its natural gas
output that year was 27.7 billion cu m.
Refining capacity was 4.2 million b/d
for 2000.
The FGE paper reviewed China’s petroleum and gas production during the
nation’s 10th 5-year plan. During the
10th 5-year plan, China’s added proved
oil reserves increased to 34.8 billion
bbl compared with 26.7 billion bbl for
the 9th 5-year plan. The Asian giant’s
proved gas reserves increased to 2.5
trillion cu m by 2005 compared with
1.2 trillion cu m in 2000.
During 2000-05, China’s oil consumption grew much faster than its oil
production. Exports for oil decreased
because of domestic oil demand growth.
China’s crude oil imports increased
to 2.54 million b/d in 2005 compared with 1.4 million b/d in 2000.
Meanwhile, China’s crude oil exports
decreased to 161,300 b/d in 2005
compared with 205,600 in 2000.
The Middle East has been the largest
source for China’s import, with the
nation receiving more than 50% of its
total imports from that region. During
the last 5 years, China began to diversify its import sources for crude oil. The
share of imports from Africa increased
to 30.3% from 22.7%. China’s share
of imports from Europe increased to
11.5% from 5.6%.

Reﬁned products
China’s production of refined products also grew. Its output of gasoline

China’s Sudan
work criticized

C

ritics are eyeing Chinese oil and
gas exploration activity around
the world, not least in Sudan where,
it is claimed, Beijing is ruthlessly exploiting the government’s economic
vulnerabilities.
That’s what London-based AlSharq al-Awsat newspaper suggested
last week, explaining that Beijing is
“taking advantage of the large deficit
in the Sudanese government’s budget
and its need for weapons.”
The paper said Beijing now buys
oil from Khartoum “for peanuts” at a
mere $13/bbl, adding that this grade
of crude—all from Sudan’s southern
oil fields—fetches “many times” that
price on the international market.
It said China buys two thirds of
Sudan’s production of crude oil, but
“Khartoum has spent lavishly on the
police apparatus, and this has led to a
large deficit in its budget.”

Hard to credit
Given the price of oil on the
market these days, we find this story
hard to credit. After all, Khartoum is
in a seller’s market and unlikely to be
cash-strapped. If anything, Sudan is
doing well out of the oil market, and
that is the real cause for concern in
some circles.
Sudan’s success, in fact, is the reason why other knives are out for the
Chinese. The other knives are largely
in the hands of activists who are
targeting large investors in publicly
listed companies with interests in
Sudan—especially oil interests.
For months, an activist coalition,
formed to pressure Khartoum to end
alleged genocide in Darfur, has been
pushing investment funds managers
to divest from PetroChina in particu-

lar because of its parent company’s
oil business in Sudan.
China National Petroleum Corp.,
PetroChina’s state-owned parent
company and the country’s largest oil
and gas enterprise, owns 40%—the
largest single share—of the Greater
Nile Petroleum Operating Co. (GNPOC), which has a hand in much of
Sudan’s oil industry.

A little help...
With a little help from GNPOC,
Sudan’s oil industry is moving along
smartly, too. According to the US
Energy Information Administration,
Sudan’s oil production has risen
steadily since July 1999 when GNPOC completed construction of an
export pipeline that carries oil from
fields in central Sudan to the Port of
Sudan on the Red Sea.
In 2006, Sudan’s crude oil production averaged 414,000 b/d, up 14%
from the 363,000 b/d produced in
2005. Still more is expected, with
the government saying the country
will produce 1 million b/d of oil by
yearend 2008.
Given that outlook, one can
understand why the activists are
targeting PetroChina, apparently with
success.
Under pressure from activists,
Fidelity, the world’s largest mutual
funds company, recently announced
it had sold 91% of its American
Depository Receipts in PetroChina in
this year’s first quarter.
Fidelity did not say why it had sold
the shares, but its action will likely
embolden activist efforts to increase
the pressure on other large foreign
investors in the Sudanese oil industry—among them, the Chinese. ✦

50% of total consumption and was the
largest consumer of refined products.
The industrial sector was the second
largest consumer of refined products in
China. Both the industrial and powergeneration sectors were China’s main
consumers of fuel oil, FGE said. ✦

Bolivia decrees foreigners may not export products
Peter Howard Wertheim
OGJ Correspondent
Bolivia’s President Evo Morales has
issued a decree that forbids Brazil’s stateowned Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras)
and other foreign companies from
exporting certain oil products.
Henceforth only Bolivia’s stateowned Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales
Bolivianos (YPFB) will be able to export
oil products.
As a result of the Morales decree,
Petrobras offered to sell Bolivia 100% of
its two refineries that Bolivia nationalized last year along with hydrocarbons
resources (OGJ Online, May 2, 2006).
Before Morales’ decree Petrobras
was negotiating the sale of 70% of its
refineries to Bolivia and expected to
retain 30%.
Bolivia had 2 days to respond to the
May 7 sale offer, said Petrobras Pres. José
Gabrielli, warning that Petrobras would
seek international arbitration if an agreement couldn’t be reached. He said it was
“practically impossible” that Petrobras
would make new investments in Bolivia.
Brazil’s Foreign Ministry released
a statement saying the decree could
eventually have a “negative impact” on
cooperation between the two nations.
Petrobras wanted a fair price for
the refineries it owns and operates: the
Guillermo Elder Bell in Santos Cruz and
the Gualberto Villarroel in Cochabamba.
The two refineries together process
40,000 b/d of oil and handle 90% of
Bolivia’s oil and gas for domestic consumption (OGJ Online May 2, 2007).
32

Bolivia Vice-President Alvaro Garcia
Linera also skewered the drawn-out
price negotiations between Bolivia and
Brazil, saying in a radio broadcast that
Bolivia would pay only $60 million for
the refineries, while Petrobras wanted
$200 million. It received $112 million
(see story, p. 34).
Bolivian government sources have
threatened to confiscate the refineries,
which Petrobras bought in 1999 for
$102 million and in which it has since
invested another $100 million.
Brazil’s Energy Minister Silas Rondeau
confirmed that Petrobras could have
sought arbitration if it and Bolivia could
not reach a deal. He suggested that a company such as Venezuelan state-run oil firm
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), working
with narrower profit margins, could take
over operation of the refineries.
Petrobras, the biggest investor in
Bolivian gas, purchases 70% of Bolivia’s
natural gas output, importing some 25
million cu m of gas/day through the
3,150 km Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline.
YPFB will run Bolivia’s oil and
gas pipelines and domestic sales and
exports, said company Pres. Guillermo
Aruquipa. The 44 new contracts signed
recently by a dozen oil companies,
including Petrobras, Repsol YPF SA,
and British Gas, will yield $2 billion in
2007 said Arequipa.
Bolivia’s Hydrocarbon Chamber
said investment in Bolivia’s oil and gas
industry fell to $120 million last year
from $650 million in 2002. The chamber represents 100 companies operating
in Bolivia.

Bolivians not helped
One year after nationalizing its oil and
gas sector, Bolivia has not yet placed a single boliviano (Bolivia’s currency) into the
people’s pockets, say economic analysts.
“The resources from higher taxes
and royalties are not reaching the
majority of the population, which is
very poor, despite the fact that from the
macroeconomic point of view Bolivia
is in a good situation,” said economist
Gonzalo Chavez, head of the economics and development department of
Bolivia’s Catholic university.
Bolivia said that with the revision
of natural gas contracts, the country
received $1.6 billion last year. Revenues
from gas royalties and taxes before the
nationalization were $600 million.
After the 2006 nationalization, Bolivia renegotiated contracts, signed on
May 2, with foreign oil and natural gas
firms operating within the country. The
new contracts award the government an
average of 82% revenues for natural gas
and oil operations in Bolivia over the
next 20-30 years.
Bolivia classifies these firms as
“service providers” to YPFB. Petrobras
describes the contractual arrangements
differently, saying it is a “production
partner” with YPFB. This divergence in
the way the contracts are publicly portrayed has not become an open argument between the two, but it suggests
the possibility of conflicting interpretations in later disputes.
Government statistics show that in
2006 Bolivia went through an external
shock. For the first time in 5 years, exOil & Gas Journal / May 21, 2007

Bolivia to pay $112 million to buy back Petrobras reﬁneries
After days of tense negotiations
between Brazil’s state-owned Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) and the Bolivian government, Bolivia’s President Evo
Morales announced that his country
had reached a deal to purchase the
country’s two reﬁneries from Petrobras.
Bolivia will pay $112 million to buy
back the two reﬁneries, which together
provide 90% of Bolivia’s domestic products needs.
On May 6 Bolivia issued a decree
that forbade Petrobras and other foreign companies from exporting certain
oil products (see story, p. 32). Petrobras
reacted strongly giving Bolivia 48 hr to
buy all of the reﬁneries.
Brazil’s Mines and Energy Minister
said Petrobras might accept payment in
two installments or in natural gas.
Brazil currently buys about 25 million cu m/day of gas from the Andean

ports that previously had not surpassed

country, representing about half of
Brazil’s gas consumption, and more
than two thirds of Bolivia’s gas output.
Petrobras also has heavy exploration
and production investments in Bolivia’s
oil and gas sectors.
Bolivia had initially offered only
$60 million for the reﬁneries, while
Petrobras had started as high as $200
million as compensation for the original price as well as investments since
then to modernize the plants. Bolivian
government sources have threatened
to conﬁscate the reﬁneries, which
Petrobras bought in 1999 for $102 million and in which it has since invested
another $100 million.
When Petrobras gave its purchase
ultimatum, it said if an agreement was
not reached, Petrobras would seek
international arbitration.
“An agreement is always better than

[going] to court,” said Brazilian energy
specialist Marco Tavares of the consulting company Gas Energy. “And what is
the guarantee that Bolivia would abide
by a judicial decision? Bolivia has a
track record since the 2006 nationalization of the oil and gas sectors of
breaching contracts,” Tavares added.
Marco Aurelio Garcia, a top aide to
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da
Silva, told BBC there will be a period of
transition in handing over the reﬁneries
to Bolivia’s state-owned Yacimientos
Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB).
During the transition period Petrobras
will work with YPFB personnel, especially in implementing safety criteria.
“Brazil depends on gas from Bolivia,
but Bolivia is completely dependent on
the Brazilian market since Petrobras is
Bolivia’s largest company,” concluded
Garcia.

Canada to regulate greenhouse-gas, other air emissions
The Canadian government has issued
a proposed framework for regulation of
air emissions that it says contains “the
toughest action on greenhouse gases ever
proposed by a Canadian government.”
The framework envisions regulations that for the first time in Canada
set “mandatory and enforceable reduction targets” for emissions not only of
greenhouse gases but also of specified air
pollutants from major industrial sources.
The oil and gas industry is one of
seven categories to which the industrial
regulations apply. Others are electricity
generation via combustion; forest products; smelting and metals refining; iron
and steel; some mining; and cement,
lime, and chemicals.
For greenhouse gases, the framework
34

sets a 2010 implementation date for
reduction targets for emission intensity,
defined as greenhouse-gas emissions
per unit of production. For air pollutants—nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides,
volatile organic compounds, and
particulate matter—the framework sets
fixed emission caps taking effect as soon
as possible between 2012 and 2015.
All emission cuts are measured
against 2006 baselines.
In addition to regulating industrial
emissions, the framework calls for:
• A mandatory vehicle fuel-efficiency standard taking effect in the 2011
model year.
• A phaseout of incandescent light
bulbs in common uses after 2012.
• New energy-performance stan-

dards for consumer and commercial
products.
• Development of “a comprehensive
regulatory agenda to improve indoor air
quality.”

Greenhouse gases
For greenhouse gases from existing
facilities, the government seeks 6%/year
improvement during 2007-10 in emissions intensity and 2%/year improvement for 10 years after 2010. New
facilities—those beginning operations in
2004 or after—will have a 3-year grace
period for greenhouse-gas emission targets. After the grace period, targets will
be based on a “cleaner fuel standard,”
and the facilities will have to achieve
2%/year emissions improvements.

US states seize opportunities to maximize oil, gas production
Steven Poruban
Senior Editor

other 15% of natural gas comes from
“friendly” sources.

US oil and gas-producing states must
continue to work together to explore
for and develop oil and gas resources
and maximize production with a high
sense of environmental awareness if
they are to meet the nation’s ever-increasing energy requirements.
This was one of the main messages
voiced by members of the Interstate Oil
& Gas Compact Commission May 7 at
the start of its midyear issues summit in
Point Clear, Ala.
Speakers at IOGCC’s first general session agreed that maximizing US oil and
gas production in an environmentally
sound way should not, and don’t have
to be mutually exclusive goals.
North Dakota Gov. John Hoeven,
current IOGCC chairman, said the
US must seize opportunities now to
increase oil and gas production. “It’s
going to take all of these sources of
energy, and more” to fuel the US in the
future, he said.
Hoeven also stressed the need for
optimism in looking at the current state
of US oil and gas production—seeing
the glass as half-full, rather than halfempty. The US still produces about 40%
of its oil domestically, he said, and it
produces about 85% of its natural gas.
He said the largest exporter of crude
into the US remains Canada and the

Maximizing efﬁciency
Michael Ming, president of Research
Partnership to Secure Energy for America (RPSEA), said increasingly advanced
technologies will be required to raise
oil and gas production in the US. He
emphasized the importance of the role
that US states play in the nation’s energy
future. “The states hold a lot of cards
right now,” he said.
RPSEA is a nonprofit corporation
composed of members of industry, government, academia, and national laboratories. Its mission is to provide a role
in ensuring research, development, and
deployment of safe and environmentally
sensitive technology that can effectively
deliver hydrocarbons from US resources.
Ming said at the consumption end of
the oil supply chain, US states must continue to invest in research and development to find ways to maximize energy
efficiency. In most cases, Ming said,
energy use in the US is about 45% efficient. In the transportation sector alone,
he said, energy efficiency is about 17%.
“The potential is high to increase
the end-use efficiency of our supplies,”
Ming said, adding that efficiency leverages all forms of supply—renewable
resources as well as conventional ones.
Ming said the US uses about 20 million b/d of oil and 22 tcf/year of gas.

Of this, the US wastes up to two-thirds
with energy inefficiency. Also, the US
imports about two thirds of its oil.
Currently, the energy resource base
of the US is in a state of transition,
Ming explained. Resources that may be
easy to find are increasingly difficult to
produce, citing the Barnett shale play
and production from the ultradeep
water as examples.

Independents’ role
Speaking on the challenges of the
110th US Congress and its decisions’ effect on US independent producers was
Michael Linn, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America
and chairman, president, and chief
executive of Linn Energy LLC, Houston. Linn noted that while addressing
global climate change through mitigating emissions of carbon dioxide was
“admirable,” the solution would need
to come from a worldwide perspective.
Developing countries such as China and
India should have to be as involved in
the solution as the US.
Linn said development of alternative forms of energy is also vital and
suggests using natural gas as a primary
“buffer” source of energy while developing these other sources.
Linn also stressed that Congress
should not pass any more legislation that
would hurt US independent producers
and their search for oil and gas. ✦

disaster in the history of the US.
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed 136 structures, representing
1.7% of gulf oil production and 0.9%
of natural gas output. Another 53
platforms suffered significant damage.
Five rigs were destroyed, and 19 rigs
sustained significant damage.7 10 11
Out of a total of $15 billion of energy losses, about $2 billion is applicable to the downstream sector (Table 1).
Two-thirds of the loss estimates are due
to physical damage, followed by business interruption (18%) and operators
extra expense (14%).
Onshore losses as a whole were
significantly smaller than the offshore
sector. For Katrina, losses are estimated
at $2.53 billion onshore, $6.63 billion offshore. Rita losses are estimated
at $915 million onshore, $4.98 billion
offshore.

The third and final part of this series
examines the impact of weather on
offshore losses.
Weather plays a major role in human
activities offshore, and extreme weather
in particular is one of the significant
perils encountered. Storms and hurricanes regularly challenge and endanger
the offshore energy industry, exposing
their insurers, owners, and investors to
significant capital loss.
A statistical assessment of weather damage
and loss, broken out by
region, time, and loss
category is presented for
the time horizon 19702004 based on the Willis
Energy Loss database. We begin with a
summary review of the 2005 hurricane
season.

Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd., London, established a stabilized oil flow at
HEK-3, a 2004 Sonatrach oil and gas
discovery on Djebel Bottena Block 129
in the Southeast Constantine basin.
Sonatrach’s initial tests achieved a
flow after acid treatment of 184 bbl of
oil in 4 hr from a Coniacian limestone.
On re-entry by Gulf Keystone, the
same interval at 2,439-46 m after acidfrac stabilized at 1,040 b/d of 31° gravity oil on a 32⁄64-in. choke. The well then
made 3,500 bbl of oil in 4.5 days with
a gas-oil ratio of 93 scf/bbl.
Gulf Keystone will consider installing a pump and is analyzing early
development based on what appears to

be a commercial production rate. Gulf
Keystone has 75% interest and operates
Block 129. Sonatrach has 25%.
Djebel Onk oil field is on the block
but excluded. The block also contains
the Djebel Foua gas discovery.

energetic and kinetic deviations during the hydration of hardening cement
in contrast to hydration at normal
temperatures. Decreasing temperature
retards hydration of clinker minerals.
When passing below 0° C., hydration
is sharply retarded and cement lattice
structure cannot properly form due to
propping action of ice.
At the same time, for exothermic
reactions, characterized
by intensive heat release,
lowering the temperature
increases formation of a
number of compounds.
This mechanism was the
basis to design materials
hardening at temperatures below freezing, including those
based on hemihydrate gypsum1 and a
mixture of periclase, MgO, with monopotassic phosphate, KH2PO4 (OGJ, May
16, 2005, pp. 48-52; OGJ, May 9, 2005,
pp. 53-55).
The aim of this work was to produce
a water resistant, cement-gypsum mixture with no free water.

Arctic cement synthesis

Hydration of α-hemihydrate gypsum
is an exothermic process. A change
in temperature of gypsum test corresponds to a certain amount of hemihydrate gypsum reacting with water
(Equation 1 in the equation box).
The constant reaction rate of αhemihydrate dissolution (K1) and
process of double hydrate gypsum (K2)
crystallization was determined by the
Condo equation (Equation 2).
According to test results, K1 = 0.25
and K2 = 0.05. These data indicate that
crystallization is a limiting stage of the
hardening process. Correspondingly,
by adding different chemicals to the
cementing agent, one can regulate the
hydration and hardening processes.
For this purpose, sodium chloride (a
freezing point depressant) and softeners
(water-cement ratio depressants) are of
the most interest.
Equations 3 and 4 show the reactions
for hemihydrate sulfate interaction. The
reactions repeat until the initial hemi-

the samples were placed in a climate
cell at 0° C. and –7° C. for 1, 2, 7, and
28 days. After the hardening time,
the samples were tested for bending
strength and water resistance. The water
resistance coefficient was determined
using the ratio between compressive
strength of the samples hardening in
an aqueous medium and the compressive strength of the samples hardening
under air-dried conditions at 0° C. ±2°
C. After a set time, hydration stopped
and the samples were examined using
physical-chemical analysis.
Results of X-ray phase analysis of the
specimens’ normal hardening (at 20º
C.) showed that over time, the intensity of lines, characteristic of clinker
materials and hemihydrate, decreases
after only 1 day of hardening. The X-ray
pictures clearly show lines belonging
to ettringite (d = 9.8; 5.65; 3.92Å),
the intensity of which increases with
hydration time. SEM photomicrographs
show the needle prisms of ettringite in
a mass of hydrosilicates (Fig. 2).
By the third day, the intensity of
the ettringite lines stabilizes, with the
simultaneous appearance of diffraction
lines of double-hydrate gypsum (d =
7.56; 4.27; 3.06Å). The intensity of the
double-hydrate gypsum increases by
Day 7 and changes insignificantly after
that.
The X-ray picture shows distinct
lines of calcium hydroxide (d = 4.92;
2.11Å). Specimens hardening at temperatures below freezing have distinct
lines of the same formations. The
intensity of the diffraction maximums
of ettringite changes insignificantly in
comparison with their intensity specimens hardened at temperatures above
freezing. The maximum value of the
calcium hydroxide diffraction line (d =
4.90Å) decreases somewhat, compared
with its intensity under normal hardening conditions.
At lower temperatures, lime has
higher solubility; in the presence of
both lime and hemihydrate (the hydration of which gives significant amount
of heat), ettringite quickly forms.

pictures of the specimens.
When sodium chloride comprises
2-8 mass % of the mixture, it accelerates the hydration process. Derivatography shows the results of the specimens’
mass loss in the study. The amount of
bound water during the hydration
process is 25% at 20º C.; 25.7% at 0º
C., and 26% at –7º C. Water adsorption
by the multimolecular layer explains
the increased amount of bound water at
lower temperatures.3

composition characteristic of Portland
cement; calcium hydrochloraluminate
(C3A · 3CaCl2 · 30H) is observed with
d = 7.9Å and endoeffect in the temperature interval 350-400º C. The cement
bending strength increases during the
hardening time (Table 1). The amount
of free water in all cases is zero, and the
water resistance factor ranges from 0.97
to 1.0.

Field tests
Commercial batches of arctic cement (“Arctcement”) were used at the
Bovanenkovo gas-condensate field on
the Yamal peninsula in 1996-97 for
cementing 426-mm diameter conductors at a depth of 150 m, and 324-mm
diameter conductors at a depth of 450
m. Cementing was carried out by raising cement to the wellhead. According
to acoustic cement-bond logging, the
quality of cementing was good.

gypsum in the gypsum-cement mixture
by aluminate cement with a complex
additive (a plasticizing agent such as
sodium chloride) results in cement that
meets the requirements for cementing
arctic wells:
• The ability to set in the casing
string-borehole annulus at temperatures
below freezing without having to heat
liquid for mixing cement and displacing fluid.4
• No free water, which prevents
casing string collapse in case of fluid
backfreezing.
• Enhanced water resistance and, as
a result, enhanced durability of cement
insulation in a geologically complex
well section.

Future
After a 10-year drilling hiatus,
Gazprom is about to begin a 2-3-year
development drilling program on the
Yamal peninsula (Bovanenkovo gascondensate field). The company intends
to drill more than 150 wells and will
use arctic cements in the well construction, including 324-mm and 245-mm
diameter conductors. The field testing
described in this article helped delineate
cements most suitable for the extremely
difficult conditions on the peninsula. ✦

If you are a Ship owner,
offshore equipment
manager or Infrastructure
maintenance manager,
METALIZING will
eliminate corrosion on
the steel covered for
20-30 years and minimize
further maintenance.

Corrosion must be dealt with
by any owner of equipment
made of steel and particularly
those exposed in the marine
environment. In the past, various
paint systems have been used all
requiring follow up maintenance
with eventual complete recoating
for equipment in long term use
i.e.15-30 years. Views promoted
by paint manufacturers of the life
cycle of a coating vary, but no
existing paint system will protect
a steel structure exposed to a
harsh marine environment for
periods in excess of 10 years.
Metalizing has a proven track
record of protecting structures
and vessels for over 80 years of
exposure to the environment.

Metalizing is a process that has been available for
many years but the application equipment was not
well suited for covering large areas in a reasonable time
frame. Now new equipment can spray up to 1200
ft2/hr per hour under the right conditions. Metalizing
can now be applied at the same speed as paint, with up
to 400 microns thickness in an application, requires no
curing time and additionally provides tough abrasion
protection. Metalizing is essentially putting down a
protective, sacrificial layer of metal over a steel
substrate by spraying, typically aluminum or zinc.
Other metals such as copper, stainless steel,
Aluminum-Zinc alloys, inconel and any other metals
that can be drawn into wire form, can also be sprayed,
depending upon the particular requirement. This
process ELIMINATES CORROSION on the steel
covered and lasts 20-30 years. Constant labor and
time traditionally used maintaining painted surfaces
are eliminated.
FROM A FINANCIAL VIEWPOINT of an owner,
the long term financial benefits are that equipment life
is extended and maintenance costs including labor are
reduced with less downtime on the equipment. In the
short term viewpoint equipment that is not affected by
corrosion will command a higher secondhand value as
it will not require current or future paint application
and therefore the owner captures long term value in
the resale price. The question is CAN YOU AFFORD
NOT TO LOOK INTO THIS ALTERNATIVE ?
Current examples of recent projects include 2 dry
cargo vessel decks of approximately 62,000 ft/2, a
vehicle bridge of 400 ft length, Pipe spools for Chevron,
Exxon Mobil, refinery works for Texas Gas
and Kellog Brown & Root. Hatch covers and holds on
bulkers, decks on all types of ships, storage tanks,
hulls, flare booms, steam pipes, crane booms and other
offshore rig structures are suitable for this process.

Gas injection enhances recovery from polymer ﬂood pilot

Production

Because it has high mobility, natural gas
can enter low permeability zones into
which polymer cannot.
Other benefits seen from the test was
a decrease in water cut in some oil-producing wells and the need to inject less
polymer because natural gas replaced
some polymer.
Fig. 1 shows the injection scheme in
the pilot.

Polymer injection at Lamadian has
had good results, increasing oil recovery and helping to maintain production rates. But because of reservoir
heterogeneity, however, the field still
has some oil-bearing layers with low
oil recovery.
To improve the effect of polymer
injection in low and intermediate
permeability layers, a pilot test injected
natural gas, more than 95% methane,
along with polymer in the west area of
northern Lamadian oil field.

A field pilot showed
that gas polymer, two-phase flooding
could increase oil recovery from a low
and intermediate permeable reservoir.

ficiency compared with 68.15% for
Plan 2.
This result shows that with the
same amount of polymer, gas polymer
two-phase flooding improves recovery efficiency by 11.27% compared to
polymer flooding.

Optimizing injection
Three experiments optimized the injection. All the tests used the same 640
PV and mg/l. of polymer.
One test showed that a higher gasliquid ratio improves displacement. The
test noted a 12.88% enhanced recovery
for polymer flooding compared with
waterflooding. Gas polymer two-phase
flooding with a 0.4:1 gas-liquid ratio
enhances oil recovery a further 18.54%.

But with a 1:1 gas-liquid, gas polymer
two-phase flooding ratio improves oil
recovery by 22.21%.
Another test showed that increasing injection rate improves oil recovery
for gas polymer two-phase flooding.
With the same polymer amount and
gas-liquid ratio, gas-polymer flooding
with a normal injection rate increased
recovery 12.1%. Gas-polymer flooding
at a higher injection rate and constant
pressure increased recovery by 13.59%
compared with polymer flooding.
A third test showed that adding a
slug of high-concentration polymer solution just before gas-polymer alternating injection and using intermediateMW polymer for gas-polymer flooding
further improves recovery.
The conclusion for the tests was that
the best injection strategy was:
• Water to a 98% water cut.
• A 0.3 PV of 1,000 mg/l. high-MW
polymer solution.
• Five slugs of 0.03 PV of 3,000
mg/l. ultrahigh MW polymer solution.
• A 0.1 PV natural gas.
• A 0.05 PV of 1,000 mg/l. intermediate-MW polymer solution.
• 10 slugs of 0.03 PV of 5,000 mg/l
ultrahigh MW polymer solution.
• A 0.1 PV of natural gas.
• A 0.1 PV of 500 mg/l. intermediate-MW polymer solution.
• Water to again reach a 98% water
cut.
This plan can enhance oil recovery
by 13.36% compared with polymer
flooding.
These laboratory studies show that
gas polymer two-phase flooding with
parameters optimized enhanced oil
recovery by more than 10% compared
with polymer flooding.

Field application
The 90-acre pilot is near the No. 4-2
polymer injection station at Lamadian
oil field. The injection targets the PI1-2
oil-bearing zone that has an average
50-ft gross and 47-ft effective thickness.
The sand has an 8.22 million bbl pore
volume and originally contained 5.66
million bbl of oil in place.

The pilot has a line-drive well pattern and an injector-producer spacing
of 780 ft. It includes 13 wells of which
4 are injectors and 9 are producers.
The central well is on 22-acre spacing and the sand in the well is 39-ft
thick. The sand in this area has a 1.81
million bbl pore volume and originally
held 1.25 million bbl of oil.
The injection strategy included low
salinity (less than 500 ppm) water and
salt-resistant polymer with a MW of 25
million. Injection rate was 0.12 PV/year
and gas-liquid ratio was 1:1.
The injection sequence consisted of
10 days of gas followed by 10 days of
polymer solution in each of two stages.
Injected first was a 0.01 PV highconcentration preflushing slug of
polymer solution. Then a slug of gaspolymer was injected, alternating gas
injection and 1,000 mg/l. polymer
solution.
From February 2001, 1,000 mg/l.
polymer flooding was initiated in the
pilot area.
Gas polymer two-phase flooding
started on May 19, 2005. By the end
of September 2005, well 7-P1900 and
well 7-A1925 had completed four turns
of gas-polymer injection, well 7-P1905
and well 7-P1920 had completed five
turns of gas-polymer injection.
Total gas injected in these four wells
was 106.4 MMscf of natural gas (0.81
MMcf at reservoir conditions), which is
0.018 of the pore volume at formation
conditions.
Total polymer solution injected
in these four wells was 223,000 bbl,
which is 0.027 of pore volume at formation conditions.
Gas-liquid ratio for the completed
injection was 0.67:1.

Evaluation results
The current liquid production from
the nine producers is 6,409 b/d of
which 739 b/d is oil production. The
water cut is 89.9% and the polymer
concentration in the produced liquid is
438 mg/l. Bottomhole pressure is 980
psi.
Compared with production when

the wells had the highest water cut,
liquid production has increased by 75
b/d, oil production has increased by
66 b/d, and water cut has decreased by
0.8%.
Well 7-P191 had seen the best results
with Wells 7-P1928 and 7-P1988 also
having good results.
Liquid production from Well 7-P191
is now 1,150 b/d, oil production is
219 b/d, and the water cut is 83.0%.
Compared with the production before,
liquid production has stayed the same,
oil production has increased by 117
b/d, and the water cut has decreased by
9.1%.
Field tests show that injection pressure in all injectors is higher when gas
injection first started. After tubing pressure and annular pressure equalized, the
gas injection became stable and injection pressure decreased by 290-435 psi.
Tracers added to the injected gas in
Well 7-1900 were noted in the produced fluids 8 days after being added.
This throughput time is much faster
than for polymer solution and indicates
that gas has a faster displacing speed
and greater transport ability then polymer in the low permeability reservoirs.
One economic benefit of using gas
has been to reduce the amount of polymer needed. To date, the flood has uses
about 20.4 tonnes less polymer.

Many factors with varying degrees

This article examines these controllable and uncontrollable factors and

Although the turnaround organization does not have control over
many turnaround characteristics such
as qualified labor availability, material condition of the plant, equipment
congestion, etc., the examination and
understanding of these characteristics
enable the quantification of their effect
on turnaround outcomes. They therefore provide a gauge of the likelihood
of meeting turnaround targets.

chemical turnarounds. A subset (135
units) of the refining portion of the
dataset contains detailed turnaround
scope data.
Fig. 1 provides a breakdown of the
turnaround database.

Turnaround complexity
The data indicate that there are three
characteristics that have the most influence on turnaround predictability:
• The size of the turnaround measured in direct field labor hours.
• The amount of capital work required.
• The turnaround interval.
The first and the second factors measure the turnaround’s size and difficulty,
and the third factor is perhaps a proxy
for the degree to which the material
condition of the unit is known, as well
as the experience of the team with the
unit.
We developed a “turnaround complexity” factor that combines these
three factors together, and is a single
indicator of turnaround predictability.
Fig. 2 shows the significance of
turnaround complexity (high, medium,
and low).

which are well within the control of the
turnaround team.

Uncontrollable leading
indicators
There are more than 20 characteristics that influence turnaround safety,
schedule, cost, and operability outcomes. These are just a few examples:
• Turnaround complexity.
• Availability of skilled labor.

• Amount of piping work.
• Amount of instrumentation and
electric work.
• Changes to decontamination
method and procedures.
• Equipment congestion.
The level of control that the turnaround organization has over these
characteristics is very limited. For
example, the outcomes of turnarounds
with highly dense work areas are less

Although each turnaround is
characterized by a set of inherent, or
uncontrollable, factors that affect its
outcome, the turnaround team regularly deals with a myriad of factors that
are controllable; and actually have a
more profound impact on turnaround
predictability.
At a high level, these are: team alignment, scope definition and control,
comprehensive planning, schedule
integration, and level of preparedness;
collectively called “readiness.”

Turnaround organizations have no
control over the plot plan or the equipment layout within the various operating units and, therefore, unit congestion is a given. Nevertheless, it has an
impact on turnaround outcomes.

Although turnaround complexity
is a significant factor in the risk calculation, the reference here to “high,”
“average,” and “low” risks are different
than the complexity categorization. The
risk calculation accounts for more than
20 inherent factors, and complexity
only reflects the most dominant three.
For brevity, Fig. 4 shows only the cost

We developed a turnaround readiness pyramid tool to measure the level
of readiness of a turnaround of any
complexity at any point in time during the definition phase (i.e., the tool
adjusts for three levels of turnaround
complexities and for the time phases
before the turnaround). This tool involves each turnaround team member
independently evaluating the teams’
status in the 21 components of the
turnaround preparation process.
Results are collectively input into
statistical algorithms and the status of
each of the 21 elements is displayed as
red, yellow, or green. Additionally, it
calculates the level of alignment around
the status of each of the 21 elements.
Fig. 5 shows turnaround readiness
for an average industry turnaround
of medium complexity in 2005. This
shows the red, yellow and green status
for each of the 21 elements. A similar
tool details the team alignment for
each of the 21 elements. The status and
alignment tools are then used by the
turnaround team to identify the more
critical gaps, and ultimately prioritize
resources.
Team alignment is often a more influential factor of turnaround outcomes
than is status, especially for high-complexity turnarounds. The most significant misalignment is usually within the

More important than any chemical
treatment program is the flexibility
that must be built into the basic
process design. It must have the
necessary resilience to accommodate varying crude characteristics.
Proper metallurgy is critical but
selection must depend as much on
metal availability and cost as on
specifics of corrosion resistance.
Desalters have to handle not just
brine and sediment but surface
active molecules that tend to form
stable emulsions. Wash water
systems must be able to deal with
different salt chemistries. Fractionation sections must concentrate
refractory sulfur species without
downgrading valuable distillates.
Vacuum unit fired heaters must be
specially designed to minimize
coking.

When these fundamentals are complimented with the right benchmarks,
competitive targets can be set and ultimately achieved.
Scope comparisons should be done
on an “apples-to-apples” basis. In the
past 2 years, we have extended our database to include detailed planned and
actual scope data on six types of refinery units. Our scope database currently
numbers 135 units; and there is always
room for more data and benchmark
participants.

Turnaround competitiveness
Not all turnaround disasters can be
avoided. Through strong team integration, thorough scope definition, risk
identification and mitigation, robust
planning and scheduling practices, and
diagnostics and monitoring tools, risks
can be significantly minimized. As a
result, the best turnaround teams plan
and execute the right turnaround right
by following their phased and gated
turnaround work process.
This means starting with strategic
decisions that lead to well-defined tactical planning, which, ultimately, ends up
as a series of comprehensive integrated
execution plans. Identifying, defining

Effective response to system stress
requires constant monitoring of system parameters that reveal changing
conditions. When upsets are detected,
an appropriate, timely response is
required to prevent a problem. Finally,
information about the upset and the

This case study demonstrates how a
comprehensive chemical treatment,

more effectively manage microbial populations by reacting to actual changes in

Much of the existing automation
equipment was outdated and poorly
maintained. This plant used conventional methods of control. It used, for
example, an LMI pump for acid control
of pH and conductivity as a control for
blowdown. And it fed chemical continuously with another LMI pump.

pH in the recirculating water made it
corrosive to copper. Chemical dosage
control was almost nonexistent.
When corrosion caused a heat exchanger failure, hydrocarbon got into
the cooling water, which presented a
safety issue. The cause of the problem
at this plant was microbiologically

Without proper treatment, bacteria

Most microbial monitoring systems
commonly in use, such as dip slides or

which account for the remaining 1%.
Low planktonic counts often leave users
with a false sense of security because
they do not reveal the presence of the
sessile population.
The operator adopted a novel control
system to address the cause: introduction into the recirculating water of a

prehensive chemical treatment, monitoring, and control system can detect
an upset and correct it before system
integrity is compromised.
The plant’s cooling system was well
designed. A comprehensive treatment,
monitoring, and control system tracked
key system parameters and was designed to take appropriate corrective
action should an upset be detected.
Scale formation robs the cooling
system of efficiency and can cause
equipment failure. In this case, the calcium chloride brine leak increased the
conductivity and chloride concentration of the recirculating water. Both of
these effects increased the demand for
dispersant polymer as the potential for
calcium carbonate formation increased.
The chemical treatment, monitoring,
and control system in place detected
these chemical changes and applied
more dispersant polymer to prevent
deposition.
Dilution of the recirculating water
through increased blowdown was another appropriate—but time-consuming—response. When plant personnel
detected the upset, they increased the
blowdown to reduce the calcium chloride concentration.
The combination of automatic corrective action by the control system
and fast action by operators prevented a
serious operational problem. In addition to the increased potential for scale
formation, elevated chlorides increased
corrosion potential. In this case, copper corrosion rates increased (Fig. 2).
As blowdown reduced the chloride
concentration, copper corrosion rates
decreased.
The chemical treatment, monitoring,
and control system in place at this facility prevented an operational problem
by responding to upset conditions with
an appropriate, automatic, corrective
action (Fig. 3).
System operators minimized potential damage by diluting the recirculating water. The latter action could have

water. Eliminating one source of variability made both scale
and corrosion control more successful (Fig. 4).
The monitoring and control technology used in this system
combines fluorescence-based monitoring of an inert fluorescent material with an innovative chemical “tag” incorporated
into the dispersant polymer backbone. The chemical “tag”
responds to stress just as the polymer does. By continuously
comparing the inert signal and the “tag” and the rates at which
they change, the system can adjust blowdown and chemical
feed to prevent scale formation. During periods of high scaleforming stress, more dispersant polymer was applied.
As the stress abated, less was applied, preventing Ca3(PO4)2
scale formation and minimizing operational costs. Combining such innovative chemistries as PSO and “tagged” polymers
with advanced control techniques provided this facility good
return on investment.
Benzotriazole, a much more halogen-resistant azole,
replaced tolyltriazole as the copper corrosion inhibitor and
eliminated copper deposition through better copper corrosion
inhibition.
In addition to the changes to the chemical program and
control strategies, the cooling water pH was increased to 7.2.
Computer modeling predicted good results—low corrosion
rates and reduced potential for scale formation—at that pH
when coupled with PSO and better control. This reduced acid
feed and made the water chemistry less corrosive.

Results
The combination of a more reversion-resistant corrosion inhibitor and better control translated into lower corrosion rates
and better scale control at this facility. Fig. 5 shows the reduction in overall orthophosphate concentrations and variability.
Visual inspections of heat exchangers and corrosion coupons
verified the improvement (Fig. 6).
Since the DPD chlorine analyzer was already installed, its
signal output was combined with the other data collected by
the new control system. The trend of free chlorine measured
by the analyzer correlates well with the ORP measurement
taken by the controller.
Plant engineers estimate the annual total cost of operation
reduction at their facility to be $168,000, including $52,000
in heat exchanger cleaning, retubing, and repair costs.

ITP started developing and qualifying the technology in 1998. Development complied with the DNV technology qualification process as defined in
DNV RP-A203, Qualification Procedures
for New Technology.
Four major oil companies joined
ITP in a joint industry project in 2003
with the objective of qualifying ITP’s
pipe design for subsea transportation of
LNG. The JIP successfully obtained “Approval in Principle” from the American
Bureau of Shipping and “Statement of
Feasibility” from Det Norske Veritas for
the LNG pipe design for subsea service
in 2004.
ITP completed the frontend engineering design study necessary to gain
DNV’s certification of fitness in 2006.
The DNV certificate of fitness for service affirms that, at the time of assessment, the new technology is considered
fit for service. Certification means that
failure modes identified through the
process outlined in the DNV offshore

The new vessel’s design and speed
will allow it to undertake offshore construction in the Arctic. Heerema is locating the cranes, J-Lay tower, and other
installation equipment on the vessel in
a manner designed to minimize the effects of the Arctic environment. The hull
and thrusters are also being designed to
withstand arctic conditions, according
to Heerema.
Heerema has targeted both the
Barents Sea and Beaufort Sea as areas of
future growth. Heerema also expects
that the new vessel’s speed will increase
the company’s ability to pursue business in the Asia-Pacific region, by either
simply reaching the area more quickly
following completion of work elsewhere or allowing it to station one of
its current vessels in that region instead
of the Atlantic Basin.
Heerema intends to order key longlead components, such as the cranes
and J-Lay Tower this summer and is in
talks with potential suppliers. ✦

This picture shows a number of the corals relocated by CSA in their new environment (Fig. 1).

CSA tagged relocated corals relative to global
positioning system-referenced stakes to facilitate
monitoring activities (Fig. 2).

Qatar conducts reef restoration along three pipeline corridors
Qatar Gas contracted
CSA International, Inc.
to conduct a coral reef
restoration project, designed as mitigation for
three pipeline corridors
Pipelines
off Ras Laffan Industrial
City, Qatar.
The project consisted of collecting,
transporting, and relocating 4,500 living hard corals from the proposed pipeline corridors crossing living coral reefs
(Fig. 1). A team of CSA scientific divers,
operating under a dive plan approved
by RLIC and Qatar Petroleum, removed
the corals.
66

The species, coral colony size,
growth form, and health of the corals
guided selection for removal. CSA caged
the removed corals in metal baskets
and transported them 40 km to Fasht al
Hurabi, the relocation site approved by
Qatar’s supreme council for the environment and natural reserves.
A large vessel transported the removed corals in specially constructed
tanks with circulating seawater. CSA
attached, tagged, and mapped the
corals relative to global positioning
system-referenced stakes to facilitate

monitoring activities (Fig. 2).
The project was CSA’s 30th for 21
clients in Qatar since 1994.
CSA has completed a total of 36
artificial reef mitigation projects since
1985, including design, site planning
and selection, engineering, procurement, transportation, construction,
installation, and monitoring.
CSA recently opened new offices in
Doha, Qatar, and Port of Spain, Trinidad,
to provide environmental and socioeconomic management, impact assessment,
mitigation, and monitoring services to
oil and gas companies and other industries. ✦

Service searches web-based energy intelligence
MetaCarta GeoIntel for Petroleum, an
online geographic search service, provides
a way to geographically search and discover web-based energy-related intelligence.
Public information on the web is
manually searched daily by managers and
geoscientists to aid in retrieval of pertinent
information for new area reconnaissance,
competitive analysis, environmental concerns, and areas of political unrest.
The service is a vertical geographic
search engine that searches 3,500+ web
sites and 9,000,000 web pages containing
information that is specific to the energy
industry. The content is continually being reviewed by a “content curator” for
relevancy.
Two GeoIntel for Petroleum packages
are available: For current MetaCarta GTS
geOdrive users, the subscription-based
service easily integrates into GTS geOdrive
to extend their search beyond the firewall

to access these industry specific web sites.
Results from the GeoIntel for Petroleum
search are aggregated with the results
from their existing internal systems and
presented in the same context.

Protective wrap for downhole tubing
Ricewrap, a protective wrap of glass
reinforced epoxy (GRE) material externally
applied and bonded to steel pipe, is featured in new literature offered free upon
request.
The wrap is recommended for external
corrosion protection on downhole tubing
typically used between injection mandrels
and-or packers in multiple zones.
Nominal thickness of the externally
applied GRE is 0.100 in. with a working
envelope between –20° F. to +250° F.

Bolt designed for corrosion-resistant uses
The new TuffCor bolt is engineered to
provide lower maintenance and extended
life in severe environmental conditions
such as offshore and coastal onshore locations.
The company developed its new bolt
category using salt fog tests conducted by
independent laboratories. In these tests,
TuffCor bolts lasted 5,000 hr without corroding, but standard bolts corroded after
just 1,000 hr, the firm says. Although test
times cannot be converted directly to field
life, the tests showed a dramatic advance in
corrosion resistance, the firm noted.
Because it promises to resist corrosion significantly better than conventional
coated bolts, the TuffCor bolt looks better,
eliminates rust bleed, and reduces breakout torque, the firm points out. It is also
safer, since torch cutting isn’t necessary.

Cellulose will
strain ethanol’s
political unity
The US ethanol craze will become a political battle under current presuppositions.
The high-minded rationale for burning
food for energy is that the tactic inaugurates a grand transition. (The low-minded
and more accurate rationale is that burning
food for energy lets politicians keep grain
growers and distillers rich and happy.)
In the grand transition envisioned by the
high-minded rationale, ethanol made from

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s

pricey grain establishes a market position
into which ethanol made from cheap cellulose someday will move. For now, cellulose
costs too much to process.
While grain ethanol’s transitional market
position depends on generous tax credits
and market mandates, even greater favors
await ethanol from cellulose.
In these early years of the grand
ethanol transition, things are splendid for
corn growers and mostly so for distillers.
Disadvantageous combinations of corn and
ethanol prices occasionally make members
of the latter group sweat. Still, construction
of ethanol plants remains active, and the
federal mandate for ethanol in vehicle fuel
grows each year and almost surely will be
expanded by a bedazzled Congress.
Best yet for ethanol interests, nobody in
Washington, DC, seems concerned about
how much all this affects the Treasury and
the costs of food and fuel.
So what happens if, say 5 years from
now, researchers perfect the enzyme that
makes cellulosic ethanol economic?
At that point, the political unity that
turned ethanol into vehicle fuel fractures
under the strains of ethanol-on-ethanol
competition. Corn growers have to weigh
the value of stover as an ethanol feedstock against the costs of market loss and
replacement soil nutrients. Plant operators
must consider retroﬁtting, rebuilding, or
closing.
Here’s the big one: If the cellulose dream
comes true, corn will lose value.
By the time cellulose makes sense as a
feedstock for fuel ethanol, consumers who
don’t grow grain for a living will welcome
cheaper corn. Maybe politicians will have
come to their senses by then and be ready
to let it happen.
Also by then, however, corn growers
and distillers who see no proﬁt in the transition to cellulosic ethanol will have plenty
of money for a political ﬁght.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Sufﬁcient supply or possible shortage?
Energy prices ﬂuctuated sharply in early May because of differing assessments of
sufﬁcient supplies or possible shortages of crude and petroleum products.
On May 8, the June contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes popped up 79¢
to $62.26/bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange—ending a 6-day losing streak,
the longest so far this year—when three major pipelines in Nigeria were shut in after
rebel attacks. The next day, however, the June crude contract dropped 71¢, following an Energy Information Administration report that commercial US inventories of
crude had jumped 5.6 million bbl to 341.2 million bbl, near the upper end of the average range, in the week ended May 4. That jump was larger than expected by Wall
Street analysts and marked the ﬁrst increase in US crude inventories in 13 weeks.
Nonetheless, gasoline inventories remained at the lowest level for that time of year
in 16 years.
The June contact regained 26¢ to $61.81/bbl May 10 as market worries about
possible fuel shortages in the approaching driving season pushed up prices for
reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB) lifting other commodities
with it. The June RBOB contract continued to rally, escalating by 9.52¢ to $2.33/gal on
NYMEX.
June crude futures continued climbing to $62.37/bbl May 11 as the International
Energy Agency in Paris called for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
to increase crude production to prevent possible fuel shortages this summer. IEA
ofﬁcials are looking to OPEC to meet a 1.6 million b/d jump in world demand for
petroleum products this June, since crude production from non-OPEC producers has
been much lower than IEA’s earlier overly optimistic forecasts. Fears of supply shortages were fanned by thinning gasoline inventories in the face of growing demand in
the US and other major consumer countries.
IEA ofﬁcials recently reported the sharpest ﬁrst-quarter draw of petroleum products in 11 years, down to 2.6 billion bbl at the end of March among member states
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. However, many
OPEC ofﬁcials have said they see no need to boost their oil production when the real
problem is the lack of capacity to reﬁne the current supply of crude.
Imports of crude into the US increased by 727,000 b/d to 11 million bbl during the
week ended May 4, but the input of crude into US reﬁneries increased only 74,000
b/d to 15.3 million b/d, with units operating at 89% of capacity as a result of recent
accidents and the seasonal turnaround (OGJ Online, May 9, 2007).
Import data
OECD data for February started to show the effects of OPEC’s production cuts,
with imports of crude from the 12 affected producer countries down by 1.3 million
b/d from a year ago. “OPEC’s compliance to its production cuts has been better than
expected, but its impact has been somehow softened by a warm winter making for
a lesser Asian pull. The real test on the visibility of the OPEC crude cuts will start in
coming weeks as Asia moves out of its reﬁnery maintenance period while the Atlantic Basin reﬁnery runs should continue to increase,” said analysts at Petromatrix
GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. “While Saudi Arabia is almost exactly at its cut mark, Iran,
Venezuela, and Libya are still trailing,” they said.
OECD Europe did not suffer as much, since it received higher volumes of Iran and
Iraq crude, offsetting the reduced Saudi Arabian, Nigerian, and Algeria imports, the
analysts said. “For a globally unchanged level, Algeria continues the trend seen in
2006 of diverting its export away from Europe and into the US,” analysts said.
Petromatrix analysts said, “Compared to a year ago, European exports of gasoline have increased in January-February, mainly to Mexico as higher demand in
Latin America has reduced regional exports to Central America. European gasoline
exports have also increased to Africa (South Africa, Nigeria) and the Mediterranean
(Tunisia, Lebanon, the former Yugoslavia) making for less barrels available to the US
and Canada.” With European transportation fuel demand continuing to move away
from gasoline to diesel, combined with a rebound in naphtha demand, analysts said,
“The European reﬁnery yield on gasoline also is lower vs. previous years. The US
relies on Europe for the marginal supply of gasoline, but Europe is producing relatively less and shipping more of it to other destinations.”
In other news, Andrea, the ﬁrst named tropical storm of the 2007 hurricane
season, was downgraded May 10 to a subtropical depression about 100 miles eastsoutheast of Jacksonville, Fla., and dissipated without posing any real threat to oil
and gas facilities.

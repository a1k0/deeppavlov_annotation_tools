Foreword

This 2006 version of SPE’s Petroleum Engineering Handbook is the result of several years of effort by technical editors, copy edi-
 
tors, and authors. It is designed as a handbook rather than a basic text. As such, it will be of most beneﬁ t to those with some experience 
in the industry who require additional information and guidance in areas outside their areas of expertise. Authors for each of the more 
than 100 chapters were chosen carefully for their experience and expertise. The resulting product of their efforts represents the best 
current thinking on the various technical subjects covered in the Handbook.
  
The rate of growth in hydrocarbon extraction technology is continuing at the high level experienced in the last decades of the 20th 
century. As a result, any static compilation, such as this Handbook, will contain certain information that is out of date at the time of pub-
lication. However, many of the concepts and approaches presented will continue to be applicable in your studies, and, by documenting 
the technology in this way, it provides new professionals an insight into the many factors to be considered in assessing various aspects 
of a vibrant and dynamic industry.
The Handbook is a continuation of SPE’s primary mission of technology transfer. Its direct descendents are the “Frick” Handbook, 
 
published in 1952, and the “Bradley” Handbook, published in 1987. This version is different from the previous in the following ways:

 
 
 
 

• It has multiple volumes in six different technical areas with more than 100 chapters.
• There is expanded coverage in several areas such as health, safety, and environment.
• It contains entirely new coverage on Drilling Engineering and Emerging and Peripheral Technologies.
• Electronic versions are available in addition to the standard bound volumes.

This Handbook has been a monumental undertaking that is the result of many people’s efforts. I am pleased to single out the con-

 
tributions of the six volume editors:

General Engineering—John R. Fanchi, Colorado School of Mines
Drilling Engineering—Robert F. Mitchell, Landmark Graphics Corp.
Facilities and Construction Engineering—Kenneth E. Arnold, AMEC Paragon
Production Operations Engineering—Joe D. Clegg, Shell Oil Co., retired
Reservoir Engineering and Petrophysics—Ed Holstein, Exxon Production Co., retired
Emerging and Peripheral Technologies—Hal R. Warner, Arco Oil and Gas, retired

It is to these individuals, along with the authors, the copy editors, and the SPE staff, that accolades for this effort belong. It has been 

 
my pleasure to work with and learn from them.

Preface

Production Operations Engineering, Vol. IV of the new Petroleum Engineering Handbook, is designed to replace 
the production engineering chapters found in the 1987 edition of the Handbook. There have been significant changes in 
technology and operating practices in the past 20 years, and these new chapters will bring you up to date in the areas of 
design, equipment selection, and operation procedures for most oil and gas wells. 

The 16 chapters in this volume are divided into three groups: well completions, formation damage and stimulation, 
and artificial lift. Related subjects may be found in the other volumes of the Handbook, and specific data on equipment 
can be found in the American Petroleum Institute (API) Specifications and Recommended Practices or the International 
Organization for Standards (ISO) documents. Many of these chapters are interrelated, and references are made to other 
chapters. For example, tubing movement is not covered in the chapter on tubing but in the chapter on completion design. 
In general, the necessary tables and figures are included to make the design, but specific manufacturer data may have to 
be obtained from the vendors. Computer programs for design are not included, but in most cases, example problems in 
design are covered. 

The initial chapters are concerned primarily with well completions. Chapter 1 is “Inflow and Outflow Performance,” 
by M. Wiggins. The first step in design is predicting or measuring the production rate of the well. Thus, predicted flow 
rates from the reservoir (inflow) and flow to the surface storage tanks (outflow) are needed. The fundamentals of Darcy’s 
law and the correlations used for typical oil- and gas-well multiphase flow are covered. A system analysis is used that 
allows the petroleum engineer to both analyze production systems and design well completions. “Completion Systems,” 
by D. Ruddock, covers the common equipment used in most well completions and states that the packer forms the basis 
of  the  cased-hole  completion  design.  Use  of  standard  equipment  purchased  from  the  service  companies  is  common 
practice, and such equipment is often covered by API and ISO standards. Good selection of this completion equipment 
is essential to a successful well completion. The next chapter is “Tubing Selection, Design, and Installation,” by J. Clegg 
and E. Klementich. Most oil and gas wells are completed with tubing, and the proper selection is necessary for long-time, 
trouble-free service. Shallow wells present few problems, but deep, high-pressure, and/or corrosive wells may present 
significant difficulties. Chapter 4 is “Perforating,” by G. King, which covers one of the fundamentals of well completions. 
Openhole completions are an option, but most operators use the technique of perforating through the casing to establish 
flow. Understanding and selecting the best types of perforating equipment and methods is mandatory for an efficient 

S O C I E T Y   O F   P E T R O L E U M   E N G I N E E R S

completion. The goal of this chapter is to describe methods of creating the best flow path for a particular completion. 
“Sand Control,” by W. Penberthy, covers the various approaches and concentrates on gravel packs. One of the more dif-
ficult problems is completing a well that tends to produce sand without significant skin damage, initially and over time. 
The  next  four  chapters  discuss  formation  damage  problems.  Chapter  6,  by  M.  Sharma,  is  entitled  “Formation 
Damage” and covers problems in drilling, completing, and producing that result in skin damage and reduced production 
rates. “Matrix Acidizing,” by H. McLeod, discusses the various treatments that are commonly used to enhance the forma-
tion, mostly by removing plugging material and avoiding further damage. S.A. Holditch reviews “Hydraulic Fracturing,” 
which enhances the well’s ability to flow and may bypass any wellbore formation damage. Chapter 9, “Well Production 
Problems,” by R. Jasinski, concerns scale, asphaltenes, and paraffin that are common in many areas and result in reduced 
production and increased operating costs.

There are seven chapters that deal with artificial lift—a major concern for production engineers. Chapter 10 is 
“Artificial Lift Systems,” by J. Lea, and it presents the common methods used to produce wells when they will no longer 
flow. The proper selection of the artificial lift method is essential to producing the well economically over its life. The 
next chapter is “Sucker-Rod Lift,” by N. Hein, and it offers a practical approach to designing, selecting, installing, and 
operating the most commonly used method of artificial lift, rod pumping. In “Gas Lift,” J. Blann and H. Winkler discuss 
in detail both continuous and intermittent gas lift. “Electrical Submersible Pumps,” by J. Bearden, reviews the use of 
these pumps from inception to the present and provides the reader with a general understanding of the ESP artificial lift 
method. The next chapter, “Hydraulic Pumping in Oil Wells,” by J. Fretwell, is a discussion of where power fluid is used 
to operate downhole hydraulic or jet pumps. Chapter 15, “Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems,” by C. Matthews et al., 
addresses the equipment, design, application, and systems of screw pumps, a now widely used method of artificial lift. 
Chapter 16, “Plunger Lift,” by S. Listiak and D. Phillips, discusses how to use the well’s energy to produce oil and gas 
with a free piston to enhance flow.

I thank all the authors for their time and effort in producing this volume, which should provide excellent guidance 
to all involved in completing and producing wells. Additional thanks to the Editor-in-Chief, Larry Lake, and to the SPE 
personnel involved in this work.

Inflow and Outflow Performance
Michael L. Wiggins, U. of Oklahoma

1.1 The Production System
Understanding the principles of fluid flow through the production system is important in esti-
mating the performance of individual wells and optimizing well and reservoir productivity. In
the  most  general  sense,  the  production  system  is  the  system  that  transports  reservoir  fluids
from  the  subsurface  reservoir  to  the  surface,  processes  and  treats  the  fluids,  and  prepares  the
fluids for storage and transfer to a purchaser. Fig. 1.1 depicts the production system for a sin-
gle well system. The basic elements of the production system include the reservoir; wellbore;
tubular  goods  and  associated  equipment;  surface  wellhead,  flowlines,  and  processing  equip-
ment; and artificial lift equipment.

The reservoir is the source of fluids for the production system. It is the porous, permeable
media  in  which  the  reservoir  fluids  are  stored  and  through  which  the  fluids  will  flow  to  the
wellbore. It also furnishes the primary energy for the production system. The wellbore serves
as the conduit for access to the reservoir from the surface. It is composed of the drilled well-
bore, which normally has been cemented and cased. The cased wellbore houses the tubing and
associated subsurface production equipment, such as packers. The tubing serves as the primary
conduit for fluid flow from the reservoir to the surface, although fluids also may be transported
through the tubing-casing annulus.

The wellhead, flowlines, and processing equipment represent the surface mechanical equip-
ment  required  to  control  and  process  reservoir  fluids  at  the  surface  and  prepare  them  for
transfer  to  a  purchaser.  Surface  mechanical  equipment  includes  the  wellhead  equipment  and
associated valving, chokes, manifolds, flowlines, separators, treatment equipment, metering de-
vices, and storage vessels.

In many cases, the reservoir is unable to furnish sufficient energy to produce fluids to the
surface  at  economic  rates  throughout  the  life  of  the  reservoir.  When  this  occurs,  artificial  lift
equipment is used to enhance production rates by adding energy to the production system. This
component of the system is composed of both surface and subsurface elements. This additional
energy can be furnished directly to the fluid through subsurface pumps, by reducing the back-
pressure at the reservoir with surface compression equipment to lower wellhead pressure, or by
injecting gas into the production string to reduce the flowing gradient of the fluid.

Recognizing the various components of the production system and understanding their inter-
action generally leads to improved well productivity through analysis of the entire system. As

the fluid flows from the reservoir into and through the production system, it experiences a con-
tinuous pressure drop (as Fig. 1.1 shows). The pressure begins at the average reservoir pressure
and  ends  either  at  the  pressure  of  the  transfer  line  or  near  atmospheric  pressure  in  the  stock
tank. In either case, a large pressure drop is experienced as the reservoir fluids are produced to
the  surface.  It  is  the  petroleum  engineer’s  responsibility  to  use  this  pressure  reduction  in  an
optimal manner. The pressure reduction depends on the production rate and, at the same time,
the  production  rate  depends  on  the  pressure  change.  Understanding  the  relationship  between
pressure  and  production  rate  is  important  to  predicting  the  performance  of  individual  oil  and
gas wells.

To design a well completion or predict the production rate properly, a systematic approach
is required to integrate the production system components. Systems analysis, which allows the
petroleum  engineer  to  both  analyze  production  systems  and  design  well  completions,  accom-
plishes this. This chapter focuses on the flow of reservoir fluids through the production system,
particularly inflow performance, which is the reservoir pressure-rate behavior of the individual
well, and outflow performance, which is the flow of reservoir fluids through the piping system.

1.2 Reservoir Inflow Performance
Mathematical models describing the flow of fluids through porous and permeable media can be
developed  by  combining  physical  relationships  for  the  conservation  of  mass  with  an  equation
of motion and an equation of state. This leads to the diffusivity equations, which are used in
the petroleum industry to describe the flow of fluids through porous media.

The  diffusivity  equation  can  be  written  for  any  geometry,  but  radial  flow  geometry  is  the
one of most interest to the petroleum engineer dealing with single well issues. The radial diffu-
sivity  equation  for  a  slightly  compressible  liquid  with  a  constant  viscosity  (an  undersaturated
oil or water) is

The  solution  for  a  real  gas  is  often  presented  in  two  forms:  traditional  pressure-squared

where the real gas pseudopressure is defined by Al-Hussainy, Ramey, and Crawford2 as

pp(p) = 2∫ p

d p . .......................................................... (1.4)

The pseudopressure relationship is suitable for all pressure ranges, but the pressure-squared
relationship has a limited range of applicability because of the compressible nature of the fluid.
Strictly speaking, the only time the pressure-squared formulation is correct is when the μz prod-
uct is constant as a function of pressure. This usually occurs only at low pressures (less than
approximately  2,000  psia).  As  a  result,  it  generally  is  recommended  that  the  pseudopressure
solutions be used in the analysis of gas well performance.

1.2.1 Single-Phase Analytical Solutions.  Radial diffusivity equations can be solved for numer-
ous initial and boundary conditions to describe the rate-pressure behavior for single-phase flow.
Eqs. 1.1 through 1.3 have similar forms, which lends themselves to similar solutions in terms
of  pressure,  pressure-squared,  and  pseudopressure.  Of  primary  interest  to  the  petroleum  engi-
neer  is  the  constant  terminal-rate  solution  for  which  the  initial  condition  is  an  equilibrium
reservoir pressure at some fixed time while the well is produced at a constant rate. The steady-
state and semisteady-state flow conditions are the most common, though not exclusive, condi-
tions for which solutions are desired in describing well performance.

The steady-state condition is for a well in which the outer boundary pressure remains con-
stant. This implies an open outer boundary such that fluid entry will balance fluid withdrawals
exactly.  This  condition  may  be  appropriate  when  the  pressure  is  being  maintained  because  of
active natural water influx or under active injection of fluid into the reservoir. The steady-state
solution for single-phase liquid flow in terms of the average reservoir pressure can be written as

q =

The  semisteady-state  condition  is  for  a  well  that  has  produced  long  enough  that  the  outer
boundary has been felt. The well is considered to be producing with closed boundaries; there-

fore,  there  is  no  flow  across  the  outer  boundaries.  In  this  manner,  the  reservoir  pressure  will
decline with production and, at a constant production rate, pressure decline will be constant for
all radii and times. This solution for single-phase liquid flow in terms of the average reservoir
pressure is

Steady-state or semisteady-state conditions may never be achieved in actual operations. How-
ever, these stabilized conditions are often approximated in the reservoir and yield an acceptable
estimate  of  well  performance  for  single-phase  flow.  In  addition,  these  solutions  provide  a
means to compare production rates for various estimates of rock and fluid properties and well
completion  options.  These  relationships  are  useful  as  they  allow  the  petroleum  engineer  the
opportunity to estimate production rates before any well completion operations or testing.

Little difference is obtained in estimates of production rates or pressure drops when using
the steady-state or semisteady-state solutions and, in practice, many engineers use the semisteady-
state  solutions.  While  each  solution  represents  a  distinctly  different  physical  system,  the
numerical difference is  minor  when  compared with  the  quality of  the  estimates used  for  rock
and fluid properties, drainage area, and skin factor, as well as accounting for the heterogeneous
nature  of  a  reservoir.  Dake,3  Craft,  Hawkins,  and  Terry,4  and  Lee  and  Wattenbarger5  provide

complete details regarding the development of the diffusivity equations and the associated stabi-
lized-flow solutions.

1.2.2 Gas  Well  Performance.    Early  estimates  of  gas  well  performance  were  conducted  by
opening the well to the atmosphere and then measuring the flow rate. Such “open flow” prac-
tices  were  wasteful  of  gas,  sometimes  dangerous  to  personnel  and  equipment,  and  possibly
damaging to the reservoir. They also provided limited information to estimate productive capac-
ity under varying flow conditions. The idea, however, did leave the industry with the concept
of  absolute  open  flow  (AOF).  AOF  is  a  common  indicator  of  well  productivity  and  refers  to
the maximum rate at which a well could flow against a theoretical atmospheric backpressure at
the reservoir.

The productivity of a gas well is determined with deliverability testing. Deliverability tests
provide  information  that  is  used  to  develop  reservoir  rate-pressure  behavior  for  the  well  and
generate an inflow performance curve or gas-backpressure curve. There are two basic relations
currently in use to analyze deliverability test data. An empirical relationship was proposed by
Rawlins and Schellhardt6 in 1935 and is still frequently used today. Houpeurt7 presented a theo-
retical deliverability relationship derived from the generalized radial diffusivity equation account-
ing for non-Darcy flow effects.

Rawlins and Schellhardt6 developed the empirical backpressure method of testing gas wells
based  on  the  analysis  of  tests  on  more  than  500  wells.  They  noted  that  when  the  difference
between  the  squares  of  the  average  reservoir  pressure  and  flowing  bottomhole  pressures  were
plotted against the corresponding flow rates on logarithmic coordinates, they obtained a straight
line. This led them to propose the backpressure equation:

qg = C(pR

2 − pwf

2 )n, ........................................................ (1.11)

where  C  is  the  flow  coefficient  and  n  is  the  deliverability  exponent.  The  deliverability  expo-
nent  is  the  inverse  of  the  slope  of  the  curve.  Once  n  is  determined,  C  can  be  obtained  by
substituting  pressure  and  rate  data  read  directly  from  the  straight-line  plot  into  Eq.  1.11  and
solving the resulting relation.

As  discussed  previously,  solutions  for  gas  well  performance  in  terms  of  pressure-squared
are appropriate only at low reservoir pressures. As a result, Rawlins and Schellhardt’s deliver-
ability equation can be rewritten in terms of pseudopressure as

qg = C pp(pR) − pp(pwf ) n, ................................................. (1.12)
where C and n are determined in the same manner as for Eq. 1.11. The values of n range from
0.5 to 1.0, depending on flow characteristics. Flow characterized by Darcy’s equation will have
a  flow  exponent  of  1.0,  while  flow  that  exhibits  non-Darcy  flow  behavior  will  have  a  flow
exponent ranging from 0.5 to 1.0. While the Rawlins and Schellhardt deliverability equation is
not rigorous, it is still widely used in deliverability analysis and has provided reasonable results
for high-permeability gas wells over the years.

Eqs. 1.11 and 1.12 can be rewritten to facilitate the development of the inflow performance

curve. In terms of pressure-squared, the relationship is

qg

qg, max

= 1 −( pwf
pR)2 n

IV-6

and

qg

pp(pwf )

............................................... (1.14)

in  terms  of  pseudopressure.  Once  the  deliverability  exponent  is  determined  from  a  multirate
test and the AOF estimated, Eqs. 1.13 and 1.14 can be applied readily to estimate the rate for
a given flowing bottomhole pressure.

Houpeurt developed a theoretical deliverability relationship for stabilized flow with a Forch-
heimer8  velocity  term  to  account  for  non-Darcy  flow  effects  in  high-velocity  gas  production.
The resulting relationship can be written in terms of pressure-squared or pseudopressure as

Eqs. 1.15 and 1.16 are quadratic in terms of the flow rate, and the solutions can be written for
convenience as shown in Eqs. 1.17 and 1.18.

A plot of the difference in pressures squared divided by the flow rate or the difference in pseu-
dopressure  divided  by  the  flow  rate  vs.  the  flow  rate  yields  a  straight  line  on  a  coordinate
graph. The intercept of the plot is the laminar flow coefficient a, while turbulence coefficient b
is  obtained  from  the  slope  of  the  curve.  Once  these  two  coefficients  have  been  determined,
deliverability can be estimated from the following relationships in terms of pressure-squared or
pseudopressure.

After the coefficients of the deliverability equations have been determined, the relationships
can be used to estimate production rates for various bottomhole flowing pressures. This deter-
mination of rate vs. pressure is often referred to as the reservoir inflow performance, which is
a  measure  of  the  ability  of  the  reservoir  to  produce  gas  to  the  wellbore.  The  inflow  perfor-
mance  curve  is  a  plot  of  bottomhole  pressure  vs.  production  rate  for  a  particular  well  deter-
mined  from  the  gas  well  deliverability  equations.  Fig.  1.2  depicts  a  typical  gas  well  inflow
performance curve. This curve allows one to estimate the production rate for different flowing
bottomhole pressures readily.

Deliverability Test Methods.  Several different deliverability test methods have been devel-
oped  to  collect  the  data  for  use  with  the  basic  deliverability  models.  These  tests  can  be
grouped into three basic categories: tests that use all stabilized data, tests that use a combina-
tion of stabilized and transient data, and tests that use all transient data. The basic deliverabili-
ty  test  method  that  uses  all  stabilized  data  is  the  flow-after-flow  test.  Deliverability  test
methods  that  use  both  transient  and  stabilized  test  data  include  the  isochronal  and  modified
isochronal  tests.  The  multiple  modified  isochronal  test  consists  of  all  transient  test  data  and
eliminates the need for stabilized flow or pressure data.

Flow-After-Flow  Tests.    Rawlins  and  Schellhardt6  presented  the  basic  deliverability  test
method that uses all stabilized data. The test consists of a series of flow rates. The test is often
referred to as a four-point test because many tests are composed of four rates, as required by
various regulatory bodies. This test is performed by producing the well at a series of stabilized

IV-8

flow rates and obtaining the corresponding stabilized flowing bottomhole pressures. In addition,
a stabilized shut-in bottomhole pressure is required for the analysis. A major limitation of this
test  method  is  the  length  of  time  required  to  obtain  stabilized  data  for  low-permeability  gas
reservoirs.

Example 1.1 Table  1.1  provides  example  flow-after-flow  test  data,  which  are  analyzed
with the Rawlins and Schellhardt and Houpeurt deliverability equations. The traditional Rawl-
ins and Schellhardt analysis requires that the difference in the pressures squared be plotted vs.
the  flow  rate  on  logarithmic  graph  paper  and  a  best-fit  straight  line  constructed  through  the
data  points.  The  data  should  provide  a  straight-line  plot,  which  serves  as  the  deliverability
curve. From this plot, the deliverability exponent, n, is the inverse of the slope of the construct-
ed straight line. Once the deliverability exponent is determined, the flow coefficient, C, can be
determined from Eq. 1.11 with a point taken from the straight-line plot. The same approach is
used when pseudopressures are used to analyze the data, except that the differences in the pseu-
dopressures are plotted vs. the flow rate and Eq. 1.12 is used to determine C.

Table  1.2  shows  the  data  to  be  plotted  for  the  Rawlins  and  Schellhardt  analysis,  while
Figs. 1.3 and 1.4 show the logarithmic plots for the pressure-squared and the pseudopressure
analyses, respectively.

approach.

Solution.  Working  with  the  traditional  pressure-squared  data,  draw  a  straight  line  through
the four data points to yield a slope of 1.54. The deliverability exponent, n, is the inverse of
the  slope,  or  0.651.  The  flow  coefficient,  C,  can  be  determined  from  a  point  on  the  straight
line. Since the third test point lies on the line, it can be used to determine C using Eq. 1.23 to
yield 0.2874 Mscf/D/psia2n.

Once n and C are determined, the deliverability equation can be written and used to deter-
mine the AOF and the production rate for any given flowing bottomhole pressure. Eq. 1.24 is
the deliverability equation for this particular example well.

qg = 0.2874(pR

2 )0.651 . ................................................. (1.24)

The AOF is determined by allowing the flowing bottomhole pressure to be equal to the atmo-
spheric pressure for the current average reservoir pressure of 3,360 psia. In this example, when
the atmospheric pressure is assumed to be 14.65 psia, the AOF is 11,200 Mscf/D.

The same approach is used to analyze the data when pseudopressures are used in the analy-
sis. Using Fig. 1.4, the slope of the straight line through the data points is 1.57, yielding an n
of 0.637. The flow coefficient, C, is determined to be 0.0269 Mscf/D/(psia2/cp)n from Eq. 1.25
using the third test point.

qg = 0.0269 pp(pR) − pp(pwf ) 0.637, .......................................... (1.26)
and the AOF is calculated to be 12,200 Mscf/D using the appropriate pseudopressure values at
the current reservoir pressure of 3,360 psia and atmospheric pressure of 14.65 psia.

The difference in the calculated AOF using the pressure-squared approach and the pseudo-
pressure method is noticeable. This variation results from the inclusion of the pressure depen-
dence  of  the  gas  viscosity  and  gas  deviation  factor  in  the  pseudopressure  term.  As  noted
earlier, the pressure-squared approach is only suitable at low pressures, while the pseudopres-
sure method is good for all pressure ranges. Also, the Rawlins and Schellhardt method is not
theoretically rigorous, although it is widely used.

The  test  data  can  also  be  analyzed  with  the  Houpeurt  approach  using  both  the  pressure-
squared  and  pseudopressure  approaches.  Table  1.3  provides  the  data  to  be  plotted  in  the
Houpeurt analysis. Fig. 1.5 presents the Houpeurt plot of the pressure squared data, while Fig.
1.6 shows the pseuodpressure data. From Fig. 1.5, one can construct a best-fit line through the
data points and determine the slope and the intercept of the line. The slope, b, is 0.0936 psia2/
(Mscf/D)2,  while  the  intercept,  a,  is  determined  to  be  200  psia2/Mscf/D.  These  deliverability
coefficients can be use to develop a deliverability equation after the form of Eq. 1.21 as shown
in Eq. 1.27:

The AOF can be estimated for the reservoir pressure of 3,360 psia to be 9,970 Mscf/D.

A similar analysis can be undertaken for the pseudopressure data shown in Fig. 1.6. From
this plot, the intercept of the constructed best-fit line is determined to be 10,252 psia2/cp/Mscf/
D, while the slope is 5.69 psia2/cp/(Mscf/D)2. These coefficients are used to write the deliver-
ability equation as

squared method and the pseudopressure approach are different because of the pressure depen-
dence of the μz product.

Isochronal Test.  Cullendar10 proposed the isochronal test to overcome the need to obtain a
series of stabilized flow rates required for the flow-after-flow test for the slow-to-stabilize well.
This test consists of producing the well at several different flow rates with flowing periods of
equal duration. Each flow period is separated by a shut-in period in which the shut-in bottom-
hole pressure is allowed to stabilize at essentially the average reservoir pressure. The test also
requires  that  an  extended  stabilized  flow  point  be  obtained.  The  test  method  is  based  on  the
principle that the radius of investigation is a function of the flow period and not the flow rate.
Thus,  for  equal  flow  periods,  the  same  drainage  radius  is  investigated  in  spite  of  the  actual
flow rates.

To analyze the data from an isochronal test, the flow data from the equal flow periods is
plotted according to the Rawlins and Schellhardt6 or Houpeurt7 methods. These data points are
used to determine the slope of the deliverability curve. The stabilized flow point is then used
to estimate the flow coefficient, C, for the Rawlins and Schellhardt method or the intercept, a,
for the Houpert method by extending the slope of the multirate data to the stabilized flow point.

Example 1.2 Table 1.4 details isochronal test data for a particular well in which the flow
periods are one hour in duration. The Rawlins and Schellhardt approach with pressures and the
Houpeurt approach with pseudopressures are used to demonstrate the analysis of isochronal test
data. Table 1.5 presents the plotting data for both methods. Fig. 1.7 shows the logarithmic plot
of the pressure data for the Rawlins and Schellhardt analysis.

Solution.  A  straight  line  can  be  constructed  through  the  three  transient  points  to  yield  a
slope of 1.076. The inverse of the slope defines the deliverability exponent, n, which is 0.9294
for this example. The slope through the transient points is extended to the stabilized flow point

to depict the deliverability curve. The flow coefficient, C, is calculated from the stabilized flow
point,

to be 0.0242 Mscf/D/psia2n. The flow exponent and flow coefficient are used to define the Rawl-
ins and Schellhardt deliverability equation for this well,

qg = 0.0242(pR

2 − pwf

2 )0.9294, ................................................. (1.30)

which  is  used  to  determine  the  AOF.  For  an  atmospheric  pressure  of  14.65  psia,  the  AOF  is
estimated  to  be  27,100  Mscf/D.  A  similar  analysis  can  be  undertaken  with  pseudopressures
following the same method described for the pressures squared.

Applying the Houpeurt approach, the transient flow points are used to determine the slope
of the best-fit straight line constructed through the data points. This slope is used to determine
the intercept from the stabilized flow point. Fig. 1.8 shows the plot of the pseudopressure data
for  the  Houpeurt  analysis.  From  the  plot,  the  slope  is  determined  to  be  0.1184  psia2/cp/
(Mscf/D)2, which is used to calculate an intercept from the stabilized flow point of 8,814 psia2/
cp/Mscf/D as shown in Eq. 1.31.

This equation can be used to estimate the AOF of 25,600 Mscf/D for the well or estimate the
production  rate  at  any  other  flowing  bottomhole  pressure.  As  the  analysis  of  the  flow-after-
flow  test  data  showed,  the  Rawlins  and  Schellhardt  and  Houpeurt  methods  yield  different
estimates of deliverability.

Modified Isochronal Test.  For some low-permeability wells, the time required to obtain sta-
bilized  shut-in  pressures  may  be  impractical.  To  overcome  this  limitation,  Katz  et  al.11  pro-
posed  a  modification  to  the  isochronal  test  by  requiring  equal  shut-in  periods.  The  modified
isochronal test is essentially the same as the isochronal test, except the shut-in periods separat-
ing the flow periods are equal to or longer than the flow periods. The method also requires the
extended  stabilized  flow  point  and  a  stabilized  shut-in  bottomhole  pressure.  The  modified
isochronal test method is less accurate than the isochronal method because the shut-in pressure
is not allowed to return to the average reservoir pressure. In the analysis of the collected data,
the measured bottomhole pressure obtained just before the beginning of the flow period is used
in Eqs. 1.11 and 1.12 or Eqs. 1.19 and 1.20 instead of the average reservoir pressure.

Chapter 1—Inflow and Outflow Performance

Fig. 1.8—Houpeurt analysis of isochronal test data with the pseudopressure approach.

The analysis of the data is exactly the same as that used to analyze the isochronal test data.
With the Rawlins and Schellhardt data, the transient flow points are used to construct a best-fit
straight line through the data points. The inverse of the slope of this line yields the deliverabili-
ty  exponent,  n.  The  deliverability  exponent  is  then  used  with  the  data  of  the  stabilized  flow
point to estimate the flow coefficient, C, with Eqs. 1.11 or 1.12 depending on whether pressure
or pseudopressure data is used. In the Houpeurt analysis, a best-fit straight line is constructed
through the transient flow points to yield the slope, b. Once the slope is determined, it is used
with the stabilized flow point in the appropriate equation for pressure or pseudopressure (Eqs.
1.19 and 1.20) to determine the intercept, a. Once the flow coefficients are determined by ei-
ther analysis method, the deliverability equation can be written and used to estimate the AOF
and production rates for the well.

Transient Test Methods.  The multiple modified isochronal test consists of all transient test
data and eliminates the need for stabilized flow or pressure data. The analysis method requires
estimates  of  drainage  area  and  shape  along  with  additional  reservoir  and  fluid  property  data
that  are  not  required  with  the  previous  deliverability  test  methods.  As  a  result,  the  analysis
techniques  are  more  complex  than  for  flow-after-flow,  isochronal,  or  modified  isochronal  test
data.  However,  the  method  provides  a  means  to  estimate  deliverability  of  slow-in-stabilizing
wells and consists of running a minimum of three modified isochronal tests with each test com-
posed of a minimum of three flow rates. To analyze the test data, modifications to the Rawlins
and  Schellhardt  analysis  have  been  proposed  by  Hinchman,  Kazemi,  and  Poettmann12  while
modifications  to  the  Houpeurt  pressure-squared  technique  have  proposed  by  Brar  and  Aziz,13
Poettmann,14 and Brar and Mattar.15 These modifications have been extended to the pseudopres-
sure  analysis  technique  by  Poe.16  See  Refs.  12  through  16  for  complete  details  on  estimating
deliverability from transient test data.

Future  Performance  Methods.    The  petroleum  engineer  is  required  to  forecast  or  predict
gas well performance as the reservoir pressure depletes. There are several methods to assist in
making  these  future  performance  estimates,  including  the  direct  application  of  the  appropriate
analytical solution to provide estimates of rate vs. pressure for different average reservoir pres-

sures.  However,  the  use  of  Eqs.  1.7  through  1.10  requires  that  one  estimate  rock  and  fluid
properties for the well of interest.

Another  technique  also  requires  knowledge  of  rock  and  fluid  properties  by  estimating  the
flow coefficients, a and b, in Houpeurt’s relationships (Eqs. 1.17 and 1.18). When Houpeurt’s
method is used in terms of pressure-squared, a and b are

The variables D and β are estimated with Eqs. 1.35 and 1.36. Once the flow coefficients, a and
b, are determined at new average reservoir pressures, Eqs. 1.21 and 1.22 can be used to esti-
mate rates for different pressures to generate the inflow performance curve.

Russell et al.18 studied the depletion performance of gas wells and proposed a technique to
estimate gas well performance that was dependent on gas compressibility and viscosity. From
this study, Greene19 presented a relationship to describe the well performance.

q =

C1
μ(p)z(p)(pR

2 ) . ................................................... (1.39)

In  this  equation,  C1  is  a  constant  that  is  a  function  of  permeability,  reservoir  thickness,  and
drainage  area,  which  can  be  estimated  from  a  single-point  flow  test  with  knowledge  of  gas
compressibility and viscosity. This value is not the same as the flow coefficient C in Eqs. 1.11
and 1.12. C1 will remain constant during the life of the well, assuming no changes in permeabil-

ity.  Once  C1  is  determined,  one  can  estimate  future  performance  from  Eq.  1.39  with  the  gas
compressibility and viscosity estimated at the average bottomhole pressure defined as

(pR + pwf )

2

p =

. .......................................................... (1.40)

A  technique  that  does  not  require  the  use  of  rock  and  fluid  properties  assumes  that  the
deliverability exponent, n, remains essentially constant during the life of the well.20 While this
assumption may not be accurate, many gas wells have exhibited behavior such that the deliver-
ability  exponent  has  varied  slowly  over  the  life  of  the  well.  Under  this  assumption,  future
performance can be predicted with the following relationships in terms of pressure-squared and
pseudopressure, respectively.

Once the new AOF at the future reservoir pressure has been determined, the inflow perfor-
mance  curve  can  be  constructed  with  a  modified  version  of  the  deliverability  equation  as
shown in Eqs. 1.13 and 1.14.

1.2.3 Oilwell  Performance.    When  considering  the  performance  of  oil  wells,  it  is  often  as-
sumed that a well’s performance can be estimated by the productivity index. However, Evinger
and Muskat21 pointed out that, for multiphase flow, a curved relationship existed between flow
rate and pressure and that the straight-line productivity index did not apply to multiphase flow.
The constant productivity index concept is only appropriate for oil wells producing under single-
phase flow conditions, pressures above the reservoir fluid’s bubblepoint pressure. For reservoir
pressures less than the bubblepoint pressure, the reservoir fluid exists as two phases, vapor and
liquid, and techniques other than the productivity index must be applied to predict oilwell per-
formance.

Inflow Performance.  There have been numerous empirical relationships proposed to predict
oilwell performance under two-phase flow conditions. Vogel22 was the first to present an easy-
to-use  method  for  predicting  the  performance  of  oil  wells.  His  empirical  inflow  performance
relationship (IPR) is based on computer simulation results and is given by

qo

qo, max

= 1 − 0.2( pwf

pR) − 0.8( pwf
pR)2

. ......................................... (1.43)

To  use  this  relationship,  the  engineer  needs  to  determine  the  oil  production  rate  and  flowing
bottomhole pressure from a production test and obtain an estimate of the average reservoir pres-
sure  at  the  time  of  the  test.  With  this  information,  the  maximum  oil  production  rate  can  be
estimated and used to estimate the production rates for other flowing bottomhole pressures at
the current average reservoir pressure.

IV-18

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fetkovich23 proposed the isochronal testing of oil wells to estimate productivity. His deliver-
ability equation is based on the empirical gas-well deliverability equation proposed by Rawlins
and Schellhardt.6

qo = C(pR

and  requires  a  multiple  rate  test  to  obtain  values  of  C  and  n.  A  log-log  plot  of  the  pressure-
squared difference vs. flow rate is expected to plot as a straight line. The inverse of the slope
yields an estimate of n, the flow exponent. The flow coefficient can be estimated by selecting
a flow rate and pressure on the log-log plot and using the information in Eq. 1.44 to calculate
C.  An  IPR  can  be  developed  by  rearranging  Fetkovich’s  deliverability  equation  to  obtain  Eq.
1.45.

Jones, Blount, and Glaze9 also proposed a multirate test method in which they attempted to

incorporate non-Darcy flow effects. The basic equation to describe the flow of oil is

pR − pwf

qo

= a + bqo, ....................................................... (1.46)

where a represents the laminar flow coefficient and b is the turbulence coefficient. To use the
method,  one  must  obtain  multiple  rate  test  information  similar  to  Fetkovich’s  method.  A  plot
of  the  ratio  of  the  pressure  difference  to  flow  rate  vs.  the  flow  rate  on  coordinate  paper  is
expected  to  yield  a  straight  line.  The  laminar  flow  coefficient  a  is  the  intercept  of  the  plot,
while the slope of the curve yields the turbulence coefficient b. Once a and b have been deter-
mined, the flow rate at any other flowing wellbore pressure can be obtained by solving

−a + a2 + 4b(pR − pwf )

2b

qo =

. .............................................. (1.47)

The  maximum flow  rate can  be  estimated from  Eq.  1.47  by  allowing the  flowing  bottomhole
pressure to equal zero.

There are several other two-phase IPR methods available in the literature. Gallice and Wig-
gins24 provide details on the application of several of these methods and compare and discuss
their use in estimating oilwell performance with advantages and disadvantages.

In  certain  circumstances,  both  single-phase  and  two-phase  flow  may  be  occurring  in  the
reservoir. This results when the average reservoir pressure is above the bubblepoint pressure of
the  reservoir  oil  while  the  flowing  bottomhole  pressure  is  less  than  the  bubblepoint  pressure.
To  handle  this  situation,  Neely25  developed  a  composite  IPR  that  Brown26  demonstrates.  The
composite IPR couples Vogel’s IPR for two-phase flow with the single-phase productivity in-
dex. The relationship that yields the maximum oil production rate is

The appropriate J to use in Eqs. 1.48 and 1.49 depends on the flowing bottomhole pressure
of  the  test  point.  If  the  flowing  bottomhole  pressure  is  greater  than  the  bubblepoint  pressure,
then the well is experiencing single-phase flow conditions and J is determined by

Once J is determined for the test conditions, it is used to calculate the complete inflow perfor-
mance  curve  both  above  and  below  the  bubblepoint  pressure  with  Eqs.  1.49  and  1.50.  The
composite IPR is only applicable when the average reservoir pressure is greater than the bubble-
point pressure.

Wiggins27  presented  an  easy-to-use  IPR  for  three-phase  flow,  which  is  similar  in  form  to
Vogel’s  IPR.  It  was  based  on  a  series  of  simulation  studies.  It  yields  results  similar  to  two
other three-phase flow models26,28 and is easier to implement. Eqs. 1.53 and 1.54 give the gen-
eralized three-phase IPRs for oil and water, respectively.

Solution.  To  apply  the  IPR  methods,  obtain  test  information,  which  includes  production
rates, flowing bottomhole pressures, and an estimate of the average reservoir pressure. Vogel’s
IPR is a single-rate relationship, and the highest test rate is used to demonstrate this IPR. The
data  obtained  at  the  largest  pressure  drawdown  can  be  used  with  Eq.  1.43  to  solve  for  the
maximum oil-production rate.

The estimated maximum oil production is 2,065 STB/D. This value is then used to estimate the
production rate at other values of flowing bottomhole pressures to develop a complete inflow
performance curve. Once again, Eq. 1.43 will be rearranged to calculate the production rate for
a flowing bottomhole pressure of 800 psia.

Fetkovich’s  IPR  requires  multiple  test  points  to  determine  the  deliverability  exponent  n.
Table  1.7  shows  the  test  data  prepared  for  plotting.  The  data  are  plotted  on  a  logarithmic
graph,  which  is  used  to  estimate  the  slope  of  the  best-fit  straight  line  through  the  data.  The
deliverability  exponent  n  is  the  inverse  of  the  slope.  Once  n  is  determined,  Eq.  1.45  can  be
used to estimate the maximum oil production rate. Fig. 1.9 is the plot of the data that shows
the best-fit straight line has a slope of 1.347 yielding an n value of 0.743. The estimated maxi-
mum oil production rate is 1,497 STB/D, as Eq. 1.57 shows.

Once  the  maximum  rate  is  estimated,  it  is  used  with  Eq.  1.45  to  estimate  production  rates  at
other flowing bottomhole pressures to develop the inflow performance curve in a manner simi-
lar  to  that  demonstrated  with  Vogel’s  IPR.  For  Fetkovich’s  method,  the  production  rate  is
estimated to be 1,253 STB/D at a flowing bottomhole pressure of 800 psia.

To apply the method of Jones, Blount, and Glaze to this data set, Table 1.8 was prepared
and  the  data  plotted  on  a  coordinate  graph  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.10.  The  best-fit  straight  line
yielded a slope of 0.0004 psia/(STB/D)2, which is the turbulence coefficient b. The intercept is
the laminar flow coefficient and is determined to be 0.23 psia/STB/D. These values are used in
Eq. 1.47 to determine the maximum oil production rate of 1,814 STB/D when the flowing bot-
tomhole pressure is 0 psig.

This same relationship is used to estimate the production rate at other flowing bottomhole pres-
sures to generate the inflow performance curve. For a flowing bottomhole pressure of 800 psia,
the production rate is estimated to be 1,267 STB/D.

From this example, each of the three methods yielded different values for the maximum oil
production rate as well as the production rate at a flowing bottomhole pressure of 800 psia. As
a  result,  production  estimates  will  be  dependent  on  the  IPR  used  in  the  analysis,  and  the
petroleum engineer should be aware of this concern in any analysis undertaken.

The application of the composite IPR and Wiggins’ IPR is straight-forward and similar to
applying  Vogel’s  IPR.  In  applying  the  composite  IPR,  the  appropriate  relationship  must  be
used  to  estimate  J  because  it  depends  on  the  flowing  bottomhole  pressure  of  the  test  point.
With Wiggins’ IPR, estimates of both oil and water production rates are generated. The inflow
performance  curve  will  be  developed  by  adding  the  estimated  oil  rates  to  the  water  rates  to
create a total liquid rate.

Future Performance Methods.  Once the petroleum engineer has estimated the current pro-
ductive  capacity  of  a  well,  it  is  often  desired  to  predict  future  performance  for  planning
purposes. Standing29 was one of the first to address the prediction of future well performance

Chapter 1—Inflow and Outflow Performance

IV-23

from IPRs. He used Vogel’s IPR with a modified multiphase productivity index to relate cur-
rent  well  performance  to  future  performance.  Unfortunately,  his  relationship  requires  knowl-
edge  of  fluid  properties  and  relative  permeability  behavior.  This  makes  Standing’s  method
difficult to use because one must estimate saturations, relative permeabilities, and fluid proper-
ties at a future reservoir pressure.

Fetkovich23  suggested  that  Standing’s  modified  multiphase  productivity  index  ratios  could
be approximated by the ratio of the pressures. He proposed that the future maximum oil produc-
tion rate could be estimated from the current maximum production rate with

. ..................................... (1.59)

Fetkovich applied this idea to the use of his IPR. The exponent n in Eq. 1.59 is the deliverabil-
ity exponent from his IPR; however, Fetkovich’s future performance method has been applied
to  other  IPR  methods  by  allowing  the  exponent  to  be  one,  which  provides  good  results  in
many cases. This method requires no more information to apply than that obtained for applying
the  various  IPRs.  It  is  important  to  note  that  Fetkovich’s  method  assumes  the  deliverability
exponent  does  not  change  between  the  present  and  future  conditions.  Uhri  and  Blount30  and
Kelkar and Cox31 have also proposed future performance methods for two-phase flow that re-
quire rate and pressure data at two average reservoir pressures.

At the time Wiggins27 proposed his three-phase IPRs, he also presented future performance
relationships  for  the  oil  and  water  phases.  These  relationships  are  presented  in  Eqs.  1.60  and
1.61.

In  all  cases,  once  the  future  maximum  production  rate  is  estimated  from  the  current  data,  in-
flow performance curves at the future average reservoir pressure of interest can be developed
with the IPR of one’s choosing.

1.3 Wellbore Flow Performance
The pressure drop experienced in lifting reservoir fluids to the surface is one of the main fac-
tors affecting well deliverability. As much as 80% of the total pressure loss in a flowing well
may  occur  in  lifting  the  reservoir  fluid  to  the  surface.  Wellbore  flow  performance  relates  to
estimating the pressure-rate relationship in the wellbore as the reservoir fluids move to the sur-
face through the tubulars. This flow path may include flow through perforations, a screen and
liner,  and  packers  before  entering  the  tubing  for  flow  to  the  surface.  The  tubing  may  contain
completion equipment that acts as flow restrictions such as profile nipples, sliding sleeves, or
subsurface  flow-control  devices.  In  addition,  the  tubing  string  may  be  composed  of  multiple
tubing diameters or allow for tubing/annulus flow to the surface. At the surface, the fluid must
pass  through  wellhead  valves,  surface  chokes,  and  through  the  flowline  consisting  of  surface
piping, valves, and fittings to the surface-processing equipment. The pressure drop experienced
as the fluid moves from the reservoir sandface to the surface is a function of the mechanical
configuration of the wellbore, the properties of the fluids, and the producing rate.

IV-24

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Relationships  to  estimate  this  pressure  drop  in  the  wellbore  are  based  on  the  mechanical

energy equation for flow between two points in a system as written in Eq. 1.62.

In this relationship, α is the kinetic energy correction factor for the velocity distribution, W is
the work done by the flowing fluid, and El is the irreversible energy losses in the system includ-
ing the viscous or friction losses. For most practical applications, there is no work done by or
on the fluid and the kinetic energy correction factor is assumed to be one. Under these condi-
tions, Eq. 1.62 can be rewritten in terms of the pressure change as

Δp

This  relationship  states  that  the  total  pressure  drop  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  change  in
potential energy (elevation), the change in kinetic energy (acceleration), and the energy losses
in the system. This relationship can be written in the differential form for any fluid at any pipe
inclination as

Methods  to  estimate  the  pressure  drop  in  tubulars  for  single-phase  liquid,  single-phase  vapor,
and multiphase flow are based on this fundamental relationship.

With Eq. 1.64, the pressure drop for a particular flow rate can be estimated and plotted as
a function of rate. In the typical application, the wellhead pressure is fixed and the bottomhole
flowing pressure, pwf, is calculated by determining the pressure drop. This approach will yield a
wellbore flow performance curve when the pressure is plotted as a function of rate as shown in
Fig. 1.11. In this example, the wellhead pressure is held constant, and the flowing bottomhole
pressure  is  calculated  as  a  function  of  rate.  This  curve  is  often  called  a  tubing-performance
curve because it captures the required flowing bottomhole pressure needed for various rates.

The following paragraphs summarize the basic approaches for estimating the pressure loss
in the tubulars. Complete details of making these calculations are outside the scope of this section.

1.3.1 Single-Phase Liquid Flow.  Single-phase liquid flow is generally of minor interest to the
petroleum engineer, except for the cases of water supply or injection wells. In these cases, Eq.
1.64 is applicable where the friction factor, f, is a function of the Reynolds number and pipe
roughness. The friction factor is most commonly estimated from the Moody friction factor dia-
gram. The friction factor is an empirically determined value that is subject to error because of
its dependence on pipe roughness, which is affected by pipe erosion, corrosion, or deposition.

1.3.2 Single-Phase Vapor Flow.  There are several methods to estimate the pressure drop for
single-phase gas flow under static and flowing conditions. These methods include the average
temperature  and  compressibility  method32  and  the  original  and  modified  Cullendar  and  Smith
methods.33,34 They require a trial-and-error or iterative approach to calculate the pressure drop
for a given rate because of the compressible nature of the gas. These techniques are calculation

intensive  but  can  be  implemented  easily  in  a  computer  program.  Lee  and  Wattenbarger5  pro-
vide a detailed discussion of several methods used for estimating pressure drops in gas wells.

A  simplified  method  for  calculating  the  pressure  drop  in  gas  wells  assuming  an  average

temperature and average compressibility over the flow length was presented by Katz et al.11

where

and S =

0.0375γgL

Tz

. ....................................................... (1.67)

This  relationship  can  be  solved  directly  if  the  wellhead  and  bottomhole  pressures  are
known; however, in most applications, one pressure will be assumed and the other calculated.
Thus, this method will be an iterative method as the compressibility factor is determined at the
average  pressure.  Eq.  1.65  can  be  used  to  calculate  the  pressure  drop  for  either  flowing  or
static conditions.

1.3.3 Multiphase Flow.  Much has been written in the literature regarding the multiphase flow
of fluids in pipe. This problem is much more complex than the single-phase flow problem be-
cause  there  is  the  simultaneous  flow  of  both  liquid  (oil  or  condensate  and  water)  and  vapor
(gas). The mechanical energy equation (Eq. 1.64) is the basis for methods to estimate the pres-
sure  drop  under  multiphase  flow;  however,  the  problem  is  in  determining  the  appropriate

IV-26

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

velocity, friction factor, and density to be used for the multiphase mixture in the calculation. In
addition, the problem is further complicated as the velocities, fluid properties, and the fraction
of vapor to liquid change as the fluid flows to the surface due to pressure changes.

Many  researchers  have  proposed  methods  to  estimate  pressure  drops  in  multiphase  flow.
Each  method  is  based  on  a  combination  of  theoretical,  experimental,  and  field  observations,
which has led some researchers to relate the pressure-drop calculations to flow patterns. Flow
patterns  or  flow  regimes  relate  to  the  distribution  of  each  fluid  phase  inside  the  pipe.  This
implies  that  a  pressure  calculation  is  dependent  on  the  predicted  flow  pattern.  There  are  four
flow patterns in the simplest classification of flow regimes:35 bubble flow, slug flow, transition
flow,  and  mist  flow,  with  a  continually  increasing  fraction  of  vapor  to  liquid  from  bubble  to
mist flow. Bubble flow is experienced when the liquid phase is continuous with the gas phase
existing  as  small  bubbles  randomly  distributed  within  the  liquid.  In  slug  flow,  the  gas  phase
exists as large bubbles separating liquid slugs in the flow stream. As the flow enters transition
flow,  the  liquid  slugs  essentially  disappear  between  the  gas  bubbles,  and  the  gas  phase  be-
comes  the  continuous  fluid  phase.  The  liquid  phase  is  entrained  as  small  droplets  in  the  gas
phase in the mist-flow pattern.

Poettman  and  Carpenter36  were  some  of  the  earliest  researchers  to  address  developing  a
multiphase-flow  correlation  for  oil  wells,  while  Gray37  presented  an  early  multiphase  correla-
tion for gas wells. A large number of studies have been conducted related to multiphase flow
in pipes. Brill and Mukerjee38 and Brown and Beggs39 include a review of many of these corre-
lations.  Application  of  the  multiphase-flow  correlations  requires  an  iterative,  trial-and-error
solution to account for changes in flow parameters as a function of pressure. This is calculation
intensive and is best accomplished with computer programs. Pressure calculations are often pre-
sented  as  pressure-traverse  curves,  like  the  one  shown  in  Fig.  1.12,  for  a  particular  tubing
diameter, production rate, and fluid properties. Pressure-traverse curves are developed for a se-
ries of gas-liquid ratios and provide estimates of pressure as a function of depth. These curves
can be used for quick hand calculations.

1.4 Flow Through Chokes
A wellhead choke controls the surface pressure and production rate from a well. Chokes usual-
ly are selected so that fluctuations in the line pressure downstream of the choke have no effect
on the production rate. This requires that flow through the choke be at critical flow conditions.
Under  critical  flow  conditions,  the  flow  rate  is  a  function  of  the  upstream  or  tubing  pressure
only. For this condition to occur, the downstream pressure must be approximately 0.55 or less
of the tubing pressure.

For single-phase gas flow, Beggs40 presents Eq. 1.68, which relates the gas production rate

through a choke to the wellhead pressure.

The pressure ratio, y, is the ratio of the downstream pressure to the wellhead pressure. Under
critical flow conditions, the pressure ratio is replaced by the critical pressure ratio, yc. The criti-
cal  pressure  ratio  is  the  pressure  ratio  at  which  flow  becomes  critical.  This  ratio  depends  on
the ratio of the specific heats of the produced gas, as Eq. 1.69 shows.

Empirical  equations  have  been  developed  to  estimate  the  relationship  between  production
rate and wellhead pressure for two-phase critical flow. These correlations can be presented in a
form similar to Eq. 1.70.

pwh =

Gilbert41 was the first to present such a relationship based on field data collected from the Ten
Section field of California. Ros42 and Beggs40 have also presented relationships that are often
used. Table 1.9 summarizes the parameters for each equation.

IV-28

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Example 1.4  This example illustrates the use of the multiphase choke equation (Eq. 1.70)
to  estimate  the  flowing  wellhead  pressure  for  a  given  set  of  well  conditions.  However,  this
equation can be used to estimate flow rate or choke diameter. The example well is producing
400 STB/D of oil with a gas-liquid ratio of 800 Scf/STB. Estimate the flowing wellhead pres-
sure for a choke size of 12/64 in. with Gilbert’s choke equation.

Solution. Use Eq. 1.70 and the proper variable from Table 1.9 to calculate

pwh =

3.86 × 10−3(400)(800)0.546

(12 / 64)1.89

= 1,405 psia . ................................ (1.71)

For these conditions, the estimated flowing wellhead pressure is 1,405 psia. If the Ros choke
equation  is  used,  an  estimated  flowing  wellhead  pressure  of  1,371  psia  is  calculated.  Each  of
the relationships provides slightly different estimates of the calculated value.

1.5 Systems Analysis
Systems  analysis  has  been  used  for  many  years  to  analyze  the  performance  of  systems  com-
posed  of  multiple  interacting  components.  Gilbert41  was  perhaps  the  first  to  introduce  the
approach  to  oil  and  gas  wells  but  Mach,  Proano,  and  Brown1  and  Brown26  popularized  the
concept,  which  is  often  referred  to  as  Nodal  Analysis™  within  the  oil  and  gas  industry.  The
objective  of  systems  analysis  is  to  combine  the  various  components  of  the  production  system
for an individual well to estimate production rates and optimize the components of the produc-
tion system.

The  flow  of  reservoir  fluids  from  the  subsurface  reservoir  to  the  stock  tank  or  sales  line
requires an understanding of the principles of fluid flow through porous media and well tubu-
lars.  As  the  fluid  moves  through  the  production  system,  there  will  be  an  associated  pressure
drop  to  accompany  the  fluid  flow.  This  pressure  drop  will  be  the  sum  of  the  pressure  drops
through the various components in the production system. Because of the compressible nature
of the fluids produced in oil and gas operations, the pressure drop is dependent on the interac-
tion between the various components in the system. This occurs because the pressure drop in a
particular component is not only dependent on the flow rate through the component, but also
on the average pressure that exists in the component.

As a result, the final design of a production system requires an integrated approach, since
the system cannot be separated into a reservoir component or a piping component and handled
independently. The amount of oil and gas produced from the reservoir to the surface depends
on  the  total  pressure  drop  in  the  production  system,  and  the  pressure  drop  in  the  system  de-
pends on the amount of fluid flowing through the system. Consequently, the entire production
system must be analyzed as a unit or system.

Depending on the terminal end of the production system, there is a total pressure drop from
the reservoir pressure to the surface, as depicted in Fig. 1.1. If the separator represents the end
of  the  production  system,  the  total  pressure  drop  in  the  system  is  the  difference  between  the
average reservoir pressure and the separator pressure:

ΔpT = pR − ps . ........................................................... (1.72)

This  total  pressure  drop  is  then  composed  of  individual  pressure  drops  as  the  reservoir  fluid
flows  to  the  surface.  These  pressure  drops  occur  as  the  fluid  flows  through  the  reservoir  and
well  completion,  up  the  tubing,  through  the  wellhead  equipment  and  choke,  and  through  the

Chapter 1—Inflow and Outflow Performance

IV-29

surface flowlines to the separator. Thus, the total pressure drop of Eq. 1.72 can be represented
by Eq. 1.73.

ΔpT = Δp1 + Δp2 + Δp3 + Δp4 . ............................................... (1.73)

These  individual  pressure  drops  can  be  divided  into  yet  additional  pressure  drops  to  account
for restrictions, subsurface safety valves, tubing accessories, etc.

Systems analysis is based on the concept of continuity. At any given point in the produc-
tion system, there is a particular pressure and production rate associated with that point for a
set of conditions. If there is any change in the system, then there will be an associated change
in pressure and/or production rate at that same point. This concept allows the production sys-
tem to be divided at a point of interest for evaluation of the two portions of the system. This
evaluation determines the conditions of continuity of pressure and production rate at the divi-
sion point, which is the estimated producing condition for the system being evaluated.

The approach provides the flexibility to divide the production system at any point of inter-
est  within  the  system  to  evaluate  a  particular  component  of  the  system.  The  most  common
division  points  are  at  the  wellhead  or  at  the  perforations,  either  at  the  reservoir  sandface  or
inside the wellbore. The terminal ends of the system will be the reservoir on the upstream end
of the system and the separator at the downstream end of the system or the wellhead if a well-
head choke controls the well.

The components upstream of the division point or node comprise the inflow section of the
system, while the components downstream of the node represent the outflow section. Once the
system is divided into inflow and outflow sections, relationships are written to describe the rate-
pressure relationship within each section. The flow rate through the system is determined once
the  conditions  of  continuity  are  satisfied:  flow  into  the  division  point  equals  flow  out  of  the
division  point,  and  the  pressure  at  the  division  point  is  the  same  in  both  inflow  and  outflow
sections of the system.

After the division point is selected, pressure relationships are developed for the inflow and
outflow sections of the system to estimate the node pressure. The pressure in the inflow sec-
tion  of  the  system  is  determined  from  Eq.  1.74,  while  the  outflow  section  pressure  drop  is
determined from Eq. 1.75.

pR − Δpu = pn . ........................................................... (1.74)

ps + Δpd = pn . ........................................................... (1.75)

The pressure drop in any component, and thus in either the inflow or outflow section of the
system, varies as a function of flow rate. As a result, a series of flow rates is used to calculate
node pressures for each section of the system. Then, plots of node pressure vs. production rate
for  the  inflow  section  and  the  outflow  section  are  made.  The  curve  representing  the  inflow
section is called the inflow curve, while the curve representing the outflow section is the out-
flow curve. The intersection of the two curves provides the point of continuity required by the
systems  analysis  approach  and  indicates  the  anticipated  production  rate  and  pressure  for  the
system being analyzed.

Fig. 1.13 depicts a systems graph for a sensitivity study of three different combinations for
outflow  components  labeled  A,  B,  and  C.  For  outflow  curve  A,  there  is  no  intersection  with
the  inflow  performance  curve.  Because  there  is  no  intersection,  there  is  no  continuity  in  the
system and the well will not be expected to flow with System A. The inflow and outflow per-
formance curves do intersect for System B. Thus this system satisfies continuity, and the well
will be expected to produce at a rate and pressure indicated by the intersection of the inflow

IV-30

and outflow curves. System C also has an intersection and would be expected to produce at a
higher rate and lower pressure than System B, as indicated by the graph.

The outflow curve for System C has a rapidly decreasing pressure at low flow rates, reach-
es  a  minimum,  and  then  begins  to  slowly  increase  with  increasing  rate.  This  is  typical  for
many outflow curves, which, in some cases, will yield two intersection points with the inflow
curve;  however,  the  intersection  at  the  lower  rate  is  not  a  stable  solution  and  is  meaningless.
The proper intersection of the inflow and outflow curves should be the intersection to the right
of and several pressure units higher than the minimum pressure on the outflow curve.

The effect of changing any component of the system can be evaluated by recalculating the
node  pressure  for  the  new  characteristics  of  the  system.  If  a  change  is  made  in  an  upstream
component of the system, then the inflow curve will change and the outflow curve will remain
unchanged. On the other hand, if a change in a downstream component is made, then the in-
flow  curve  will  remain  the  same  and  the  outflow  curve  will  change.  Both  the  inflow  and
outflow curves will be shifted if either of the fixed pressures in the system is changed, which
can occur when evaluating the effects of reservoir depletion or considering different separator
conditions or wellhead pressures.

Systems analysis may be used for many purposes in analyzing and designing producing oil
and gas wells. The approach is suited for evaluating both flowing wells and artificial lift appli-
cations.  The  technique  provides  powerful  insight  in  the  design  of  an  initial  completion.  Even
with limited data, various completion scenarios can be evaluated to yield a qualitative estimate
of expected well behavior. This process is very useful in analyzing current producing wells by
identifying flow restrictions or opportunities to enhance performance.

Typical applications include estimation of flow rates, selection of tubing size, selection of
flowline  size,  selection  of  wellhead  pressures  and  surface  choke  sizing,  estimation  of  the  ef-
fects  of  reservoir  pressure  depletion,  and  identification  of  flow  restrictions.  Other  typical
applications are sizing subsurface safety valves, evaluating perforation density, gravel pack de-
sign, artificial lift design, optimizing injection gas-liquid ratio for gas lift, evaluating the effects
of lower wellhead pressures or installation of compression, and evaluating well stimulation treat-

ments.  In  addition,  systems  analysis  can  be  used  to  evaluate  multiwell  producing  systems.
Systems analysis is a very robust and flexible method that can be used to design a well comple-
tion or improve the performance of a producing well.

1.5.1 Systems  Analysis  Examples.    Examples  1.5  and  1.6  demonstrate  the  systems  analysis
approach. Example 1.5 considers the effects of tubing size on gas well performance. Example
1.6 demonstrates the effects of reservoir depletion on the performance of an oil well. Greene,19
Brown and Lea,43 and Chap. 4 of Lee and Wattenbarger5 and Brown26 provide a series of de-
tailed applications that further exemplify the use of systems analysis for gas and oil wells.

Example 1.5  Analyze a gas well to select an appropriate tubing size. The gas well under

consideration is at 9,000 ft with a reservoir pressure of 4,000 psia.

Solution. The first step in applying systems analysis is to select a node to divide the sys-
tem.  Initially,  the  node  is  selected  to  be  at  the  perforations  to  isolate  the  inflow  performance
(reservoir behavior) from the flow behavior in the tubing. For this particular case, the well is
flowing at critical flow conditions, and, consequently, the wellhead choke serves as a disconti-
nuity in the system, which allows the use of the wellhead pressure as the terminal point for the
outflow  curve.  Once  the  node  point  is  selected,  the  pressure  relations  for  the  inflow  and  out-
flow sections of the system are determined. For this example, Eqs. 1.76 and 1.77 represent the
inflow and outflow pressure relationships, respectively.

pR − Δp1 − Δp2 = pwf . ..................................................... (1.76)

pwh + Δp3 = pwf . ......................................................... (1.77)

With  these  basic  relationships,  the  flowing  bottomhole  pressure  is  calculated  for  different
production rates for both the inflow and outflow sections. Table 1.10 presents the inflow per-
formance  data  while  Table  1.11  presents  the  calculated  pressures  for  three  different  tubing
sizes  using  a  constant  wellhead  pressure  of  1,000  psia.  These  data  are  used  to  construct  the
inflow and outflow curves in Fig. 1.14 to estimate the production rates and pressures for each
tubing size. The intersection of the outflow curves with the inflow curve dictates the estimated
point of continuity and the anticipated producing conditions for the analyzed system. For this
example,  the  production  rate  increases  with  increasing  tubing  size,  yielding  4,400  Mscf/D  for
1.90-in. tubing, 4,850 Mscf/D for 2⅜-in. tubing, and 5,000 Mscf/D for 2⅞-in. tubing.

The  same  well  could  be  analyzed  with  the  wellhead  as  the  system  node.  This  allows  the
effect of changes in wellhead pressure on well performance to be determined. The new inflow
and outflow pressure relationships are

pR − Δp1 − Δp2 − Δp3 = pwh................................................. (1.78)

for the inflow curve, and

pwh = pwh................................................................ (1.79)

for the outflow curve. Table 1.12 shows the pressure-rate relationship for both the inflow and
outflow  curves.  Because  the  wellhead  is  the  node  in  this  analysis,  the  outflow  curve  will  be
constant and equal to the anticipated flowing wellhead pressure.

IV-34

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 1.16—Systems analysis graph with a bottomhole pressure node for Example 1.6.

The data are plotted in Fig. 1.15 and yield the same producing rates and flowing bottom-
hole  pressures  that  were  determined  when  the  flowing  bottomhole  pressure  was  used  as  the
node.  This  is  as  expected  because  the  choice  of  a  division  point  or  node  does  not  affect  the
results for a given system. If the wellhead pressure is decreased to 250 psia, the producing rate
will change also. This effect is readily determined by constructing a constant wellhead pressure
line of 250 psia on the graph and selecting the points of intersection for each tubing size. As
observed  from  the  graph,  the  anticipated  production  rates  increase  to  4,950  Mscf/D,  5,200
Mscf/D, and 5,300 Mscf/D for the three tubing sizes by lowering the wellhead pressure.

Example 1.6  Investigate the effects of reservoir depletion of an oil well to estimate pro-
ducing  conditions  and  consider  the  need  for  artificial  lift.  The  well  under  consideration  is
producing with a constant wellhead pressure of 250 psia and is controlled by the choke.

Solution. Isolate the reservoir performance to visualize the effect of changing reservoir pres-
sure.  The  flowing  bottomhole pressure  at  mid-perforations is  selected as  the  node  and,  as  the
well is producing under critical flow conditions, the wellhead will serve as the terminal end of
the system.

The inflow and outflow rate-pressure data is generated with Eqs. 1.76 and 1.77. Table 1.13
provides  the  inflow  performance  data  for  average  reservoir  pressures  of  2,500  psia  and  2,000
psia. Table 1.14 shows the tubing-intake data or outflow performance data for a flowing well-
head pressure of 250 psia with 2⅞-in. tubing. Fig. 1.16 plots this information, which is used to
determine the producing conditions at the two reservoir pressures. At an average reservoir pres-
sure of 2,500 psia, the curves intersect at an oil production rate of 380 STB/D and a flowing
bottomhole pressure of 1,650 psia. However, there is no intersection or point of continuity be-
tween the inflow and outflow performance curves when the reservoir pressure declines to 2,000
psia. This indicates that the well will not flow under these reservoir conditions. On the basis of
this  analysis,  the  effects  of  lowering  the  wellhead  pressure,  reducing  the  tubing  size,  or  in-

stalling  artificial  lift  early  in  the  life  of  the  well  to  enhance  its  deliverability  should  be
investigated.

1.6 Summary
This chapter describes the flow of reservoir fluids through the production system and provides
methods to estimate oil and gas well deliverability. Analytical and empirical methods that de-
scribe fluid flow through the reservoir to the wellbore are presented to assist in predicting the
inflow performance of an individual well. A brief overview of flow through circular conduits is
used  to  assist  in  describing  the  pressure  drop  in  the  production  system.  Finally,  an  integrated
approach called systems analysis is described to provide the tools needed to estimate well deliv-
erability  by  integrating  the  reservoir  performance  with  the  tubing  performance.  These  two
aspects of the production system must be integrated to determine actual producing conditions.

Systems  analysis  is  an  excellent engineering tool  for  optimizing the  design  of  a  new  well
completion  or  analyzing  the  behavior  of  a  current  production  system.  The  application  of  sys-
tems  analysis  requires  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  relationship  between  flow  of  reservoir
fluids  in  the  subsurface  reservoir  and  fluid  flow  through  the  well  completion  and  tubulars  to
the surface stock tank. Unfortunately, this understanding is often lacking in practice. Inefficient
operations may occur because the petroleum engineer does not have a complete understanding
of the fluid-flow process or fails to take a comprehensive look at the production system. The
proper  application  of  systems  analysis  provides  a  basis  for  determining  the  interaction  of  the
various components in the production system to optimize the desired production rates for both
oil and gas wells.

Completion Systems

2.1 Introduction
There  are  many  completion  options  available  to  oil  and  gas  producers  today.  Today’s  cased-
hole completion systems vary from relatively simple single-zone low-pressure/low-temperature
(LP/LT) designs to complex high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) applications that were un-
thinkable  with  the  technology  available  50  years  ago.  Many  of  the  basic  components  appear
similar  to  those  used  in  the  past,  yet  they  have  been  vastly  improved,  and  their  performance
has been optimized to suit numerous environments.

There  are  several  keys  to  designing  a  successful  completion  system  and  selecting  compo-
nents that are fit for purpose for both the downhole environment and application. Consideration
must be given to the various modes under which the completion must operate and the effects
any changes in temperature or differential pressure will have on the tubing string and packer.
Ultimately, the system must be both efficient and cost-effective to achieve production and finan-
cial goals. A key factor in the completion design is the production rate; see other chapters in
this section of the Handbook for additional information on this topic. The intention of this chap-
ter  is  to  familiarize  the  reader  with  the  common  components  that  make  up  the  completion
system and to understand their applications and constraints.

2.2 Packers
The packer forms the basis of the cased-hole completion design. The packer is a sealing device
that isolates and contains produced fluids and pressures within the wellbore to protect the cas-
ing  and  other  formations  above  or  below  the  producing  zone.  This  is  essential  to  the  basic
functioning of most wells.

In  addition  to  providing  a  seal  between  the  tubing  and  casing,  other  benefits  of  a  packer

are as follows:

• Prevent downhole movement of the tubing string.
• Support some of the weight of the tubing.
• Often improve well flow and production rate.
• Protect the annular casing from corrosion from produced fluids and high pressures.
• Provide a means of separation of multiple producing zones.
• Limit well control to the tubing at the surface for safety purposes.
• Hold well-servicing fluid (kill fluids, packer fluids) in the casing annulus.

IV-42

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Packers  have  four  key  features:  slip,  cone,  packing-element  system,  and  body  or  mandrel.
The slip is a wedge-shaped device with wickers (or teeth) on its face, which penetrate and grip
the casing wall when the packer is set. The cone is beveled to match the back of the slip and
forms  a  ramp  that  drives  the  slip  outward  and  into  the  casing  wall  when  setting  force  is  ap-
plied  to  the  packer.  Once  the  slips  have  anchored  into  the  casing  wall,  additional  applied
setting force energizes the packing-element system and creates a seal between the packer body
and the inside diameter of the casing.

Production packers can be classified into two groups: retrievable and permanent. Permanent
packers can be removed from the wellbore only by milling. The retrievable packer may or may
not be resettable; however, removal from the wellbore normally does not require milling. Re-
trieval  is  usually  accomplished  by  some  form  of  tubing  manipulation.  This  may  necessitate
rotation or require pulling tension on the tubing string.

The permanent packer is fairly simple and generally offers higher performance in both tem-
perature  and  pressure  ratings  than  does  the  retrievable  packer.  In  most  instances,  it  has  a
smaller outside diameter (OD), offering greater running clearance inside the casing string than
do retrievable packers. The smaller OD and the compact design of the permanent packer help
the  tool  negotiate  through  tight  spots  and  deviations  in  the  wellbore.  The  permanent  packer
also  offers  the  largest  inside  diameter  (ID)  to  make  it  compatible  with  larger-diameter  tubing
strings and monobore completions.

The retrievable packer can be very basic for LP/LT applications or very complex in HP/HT
applications. Because of this design complexity in high-end tools, a retrievable packer offering
performance levels similar to those of a permanent packer will invariably cost more. However,
the ease of removing the packer from the wellbore and features such as resettability and being
able to reuse the packer often may outweigh the added cost.

Before selecting either tool, it is important to consider the performance and features of each
design, as well as the application in which it will be used. Perhaps in some instances, the per-
manent packer is the only option, as may be the case in some HP/HT applications. However,
in  those  instances  in  which  either  will  suffice,  the  operator  must  decide  which  features  offer
the best return over the life of the well.

When selecting a packer for a cased-hole completion, the differential pressure and tempera-
ture  requirements  of  the  application  must  be  considered.  The  well  depth,  deployment  and
setting method desired, and final tubing landing conditions are also factors that come into play.
The various operational modes (flowing, shut-in, injection, and stimulation) that are anticipated
over the life of the well are critical and must be considered carefully in the design phase. The
changes  in  the  operational  modes  that  influence  changes  in  temperature,  differential  pressure,
and axial loads all have a direct impact on the packer. Understanding the uses and constraints
of the different types of packers will help clarify the factors to consider when making a selection.

2.2.1 Retrievable Tension Packer.  The tension packer (Fig. 2.1) is typically used in medium-
to shallow-depth (LP/LT) production or injection applications. The tension packer has a single
set of unidirectional slips that grip only the casing when the tubing is pulled in tension. Con-
stant  tubing  tension  must  be  maintained  to  keep  the  packer  set  and  the  packing  element
energized. Tension packers typically are set mechanically and are released by means of tubing
rotation. Most models also have an emergency shear-release feature should the primary release
method fail.

The tension packer does not have an equalizing (or bypass) valve to aid in pressure equal-
ization  between  the  tubing  and  annulus  to  facilitate  the  retrieval  of  the  packer.  This  seldom
presents  a  problem  with  the  tension  packer  because  the  packer  is  run  at  relatively  shallow
depths, and differential pressures across the packer during retrieval should be low. The use of
packers without bypass valves should be avoided in deeper applications for which hydrostatic
and differential pressures can be greater. High differential pressures can make packers difficult

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

or impossible to release because of the forces created by the pressure acting on the cross-sec-
tional area of the packer. In packers with no bypass feature, the pressures must be equalized at
the  surface  by  adding  fluid  or  pressure  to  the  tubing  or  annulus  and,  in  some  extreme  cases,
swabbing the tubing string.

The tension packer is suited for applications in which pressure below the packer is always
greater than the annulus pressure at the tool. Pressure from below the tool boosts the packing
element  into  the  slip  assembly,  which  is  designed  to  hold  in  tension  and  capture  this  force.
Conversely,  when  annular  pressure  is  higher  than  tubing  pressure  at  the  tool,  the  element  is
boosted downward away from the slips, and packoff force is lost. Therefore, care must be tak-
en  to  ensure  that  sufficient  tension  is  applied  to  keep  the  element  energized  to  contain
differentials in favor of the annulus.

Consideration should be given to the type of wellhead and Christmas tree that will be em-
ployed when using tension packers in extremely shallow operations. After the packer is set and
tubing is pulled in tension, it is difficult or impossible for the tubing to stretch enough to facil-
itate installation of some types of wellheads.

Fig. 2.2—Compression packer with fluid bypass.

2.2.2 Retrievable  Compression  Packer  With  Bypass.    The  retrievable  compression  packer
with  fluid-bypass  valve  (Fig.  2.2)  is  recommended  for  low-  to  medium-pressure/medium-tem-
perature  oil-  or  gas-production  applications.  The  retrievable  compression  packer  is  prevented
from  setting  by  means  of  a  mechanical  interlock  while  it  is  being  run  in  the  hole.  Once  the
packer has been run to the desired depth, the tubing string is rotated to initiate the setting se-
quence.  As  the  tubing  is  being  rotated,  the  drag  blocks  on  the  packer  are  used  to  hold  the
packer in place and provide the resistance to set it. Once the interlock system is released, the
tubing string is lowered to close the bypass seal and set the slips. The continued application of
slackoff force energizes the packing-element system and creates a seal. The packer is released
by simply picking up on the tubing string—a desirable feature.

The packing-element system is enhanced over that of the tension packer to make it suitable
for  moderately  higher  pressures  and  temperatures.  The  addition  of  the  integral  bypass  valve
assists equalization of pressures in the tubing and annulus and aids in releasing the packer. The
valve can be opened by picking up on the tubing string without releasing the packer. Constant
compression or tubing weight must be maintained to sustain the packoff and keep the bypass
valve closed. Because of this design constraint, compression packers generally are not suitable

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-45

Fig. 2.3—Compression packer with fluid bypass and hold-down anchor.

for injection wells or low-volume pressure-treating operations. The bypass valve could open or
the packer may fail if pressure limitations are exceeded from below, or a decrease in tempera-
ture  because  of  operational  changes  may  result  in  a  reduction  of  tubing  length  and  a  loss  of
packoff force on the packer.

More common models of the compression packer with bypass have an additional set of hold-
down slips, or an anchor system above the packing-element system (Fig 2.3). This packer sets
and releases in much the same manner as the compression packer discussed previously. In this
model, however, the addition of the hold-down slip helps to keep the packoff force and bypass
valve locked in place when pressure below the tool is greater than the pressure in the annulus.
This variation can be used in limited treating operations, in gas lift applications, or in produc-
tion applications in which tubing pressures are greater than annular pressures. However, there
are  limitations  to  the  ability  of  the  anchor  to  keep  the  bypass  closed,  and  any  operational
modes that will result in loss of set-down weight must be planned carefully.

2.2.3 Wireline Set—Tubing Retrievable.  There are several retrievable packers designed to be
installed  in  the  wellbore  on  electric  wireline  and  retrieved  on  the  tubing  string  (Fig  2.4).  On
the top of the packer is located a special nipple. The nipple has a polished seal surface on its
OD and has j-lugs that are used to anchor a seal housing or washover shoe in place. The pol-

IV-46

connected and plug retrieved (second view).

ished  nipple  also  has  a  landing  nipple  profile  in  its  ID.  This  allows  the  installation  of  a
slickline retrievable blanking plug if desired.

The  packer  is  first  run  and  set  on  electric  wireline.  The  electric  wireline  setting  tool  pro-
vides  the  force  necessary  to  anchor  the  slips  in  the  casing  wall  and  energize  the  packing
element. Once the packer is installed and the wireline is retrieved, a seal housing (similar to an
overshot) is run in the hole on the bottom of the production tubing. The housing has internal
seals that, when landed on the polished nipple, create a seal between the tubing and the annu-

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-47

lus. The housing also has an internal j-profile that engages the lugs of the nipple and anchors
the tubing string to the packer.

The tubing can be retrieved from the wellbore at any time without disturbing the packer by
unjaying the seal housing from the polished nipple, or (if desired) the packer can be released
and retrieved mechanically with the tubing.

The main advantage of this system is that it can be run and set under pressure on electric
wireline (with a blanking plug preinstalled in the nipple profile) in a live oil or gas well. Once
the packer is set, the electric line is removed, and the pressure above the packer can be bled
off.  With  the  plug  in  place,  the  packer  will  act  as  a  temporary  bridge  plug  for  well  control
while the tubing string and seal housing are run and landed. Because the plug is located near
the top of the packer assembly, it can be circulated free of any debris before landing the tub-
ing. Once the tree has been installed, the plug is removed with slickline, and the well is placed
on production.

Common applications are for completion of the well after a high-rate fracture is performed
down the casing or after underbalanced perforating with a casing gun. This underbalanced com-
pletion method is especially useful in applications in which formation damage may occur if kill-
weight fluid is introduced into the wellbore.

2.2.4 Retrievable  Tension/Compression  Set—Versatile  Landing.    Tension-  or  compression-
set packers that allow the tubing to be landed in tension, compression, or neutral are the most
common  types  of  mechanical-set  retrievable  packers  run  today.  This  group  of  mechanical-set
retrievable packers (Fig. 2.5) will vary greatly in design and performance and may require ten-
sion, compression, or a combination of both to set and pack off the element. The exact setting
method  depends  on  the  design  of  the  tool.  Various  packing-element  systems  and  differential
ratings are available, making this type of packer suitable for a large number of applications—
up to and including some HP/HT completions.

The one common feature found in this style of packer is that once the element is sealed off
and the packoff force is mechanically locked in place, the tubing string may be landed in com-
pression,  tension,  or  neutral.  Slips  located  above  and  below  the  packing  element  (or  a  single
set of bidirectional slips) are designed to hold axial tubing loads from either direction to keep
the packer anchored in place. An internal lock system mechanically traps the packoff force and
keeps the elements energized until the packer is released. A bypass valve is present to aid in
equalization and the release of the packer. It is locked from accidentally opening until the packer-
releasing sequence has been initiated.

Because the packer does not rely on constant tubing forces to maintain its packoff, this tool
is much more versatile in application. It can be used in production or injection applications, as
well as in completions for which well stimulation is planned, and it is almost universal in appli-
cation.  The  only  constraint  is  in  deep  deviated  wells,  where  tubing  manipulation  or  getting
packoff force to the tool may present a problem. Extreme shallow depth setting is achievable
in models that allow the elements to be energized with tension.

Care  must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  tubing  movement  during  production  or  injection  opera-
tions does not exceed the tensile or compression limitations of either the packer or the tubing
string.

2.2.5 Retrievable  Hydraulic-Set  Single-String  Packer.    The  hydraulic-set  packer  (Fig.  2.6)
has  a  bidirectional  slip  system  that  is  actuated  by  a  predetermined  amount  of  hydraulic  pres-
sure applied to the tubing string. To achieve a pressure differential at the packer and set it, a
temporary plugging device must be run in the tailpipe below the packer. The applied hydraulic
pressure acts against a piston chamber in the packer. The force created by this action sets the
slips and packs the element off. Some models have an atmospheric setting chamber and use the
hydrostatic  pressure  of  the  well  to  boost  the  packoff  force.  Regardless  of  design,  all  of  the

IV-48

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 2.5—Tension/compression-set versatile landing.

force  generated  during  the  setting  process  is  mechanically  locked  in  place  until  the  packer  is
later released. Once the packer is set, the tubing may be landed in tension (limited by the shear-
release value of the packer), compression, or neutral.

Because  no  tubing  manipulation  is  required  to  set  a  hydraulic  packer,  it  can  be  set  easily
after the wellhead has been flanged up and the tubing has been displaced. This promotes safety
and allows better control of the well while displacing tubing and annulus fluids. The hydraulic-
set  packer  can  be  run  in  a  single-packer  installation,  and  because  no  packer  body  movement
occurs during the setting process, it can be run in tandem as an isolation packer in single-string
multiple-zone production wells. The hydraulic-set single-string packer is ideal for highly deviat-
ed wells in which conditions are not suitable for mechanical-set packers.

Special considerations include the following:
• Well stimulation must be planned carefully to avoid premature shear release of the packer.

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-49

Fig. 2.6—Hydraulic-set single-string packer.

• Maximum  tensile  capabilities  of  the  tubing  string  when  selecting  the  shear-release  value

of the packer are required.

• A temporary plugging device must always be incorporated below the lowermost hydraulic-

set packer to facilitate hydraulic setting of the packer.

Retrieval  of  the  hydraulic-set  single-string  packer  is  accomplished  by  pulling  tension  with
the tubing string to shear a shear ring, or shear pins, located within the packer. Most models
also have a built-in bypass system that allows the pressures in the tubing and annulus to equal-
ize, or balance, as the packer is released. The tension load required to release the packer must
be  considered  carefully  in  the  initial  completion  design  and  in  the  selection  of  the  shear-ring
value. The shear-release value must not be set too high so that it will not be beyond the tensile

IV-50

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

capabilities of the tubing string, yet it must be high enough so that the packer will not release
prematurely during any of the planned operational modes over the life of the completion.

A variation of the hydraulic-set single-string retrievable packer, which can be furnished with-
out  the  shear-release  feature,  is  available  for  the  larger-size  casing  and  tubing  combinations
commonly used in big monobore completions. This design is better described as a “removable”
packer because it is not retrieved by conventional means. The running and the hydraulic setting
procedure remain the same, but to remove the packer from the wellbore, the inner mandrel of
the packer must be cut. This is done either with a chemical cutter on electric wireline or by a
mechanical  cutter  on  drillpipe  or  coiled  tubing.  Once  the  mandrel  is  cut,  retrieval  is  accom-
plished by picking up on the tubing string or the top of the packer. The packer is also designed
to be millable should the cut-to-release feature fail. The elimination of the shear ring enables
the packer to achieve higher tensile and differential-pressure ratings. This permits well-treating
and  well-injection  operations  to  occur  that  were  not  possible  with  the  conventional  shear-re-
lease hydraulic-set packer.

2.2.6 Dual-String Packers.  This  is  basically  a  “mid-string”  isolation  packer  that  is  designed
to seal off approximately two strings of tubing (Fig. 2.7). The dual packer allows the simulta-
neous  production  of  two  zones  while  keeping  them  isolated.  Most  multiple-string  packers  are
retrievable;  however,  some  permanent  models  exist  for  use  in  HP/HT  applications.  Standard
configurations have bidirectional slips to prevent movement and maintain packoff with the tub-
ing landed in the neutral condition.

For the most part, multiple-string retrievable packers are set hydraulically because the tub-
ing manipulation required to set a mechanical packer is not desirable or (often) not feasible in
a  dual-string  application.  However,  mechanical-set  models  do  exist,  and  in  applications  in
which the tubing strings are run independently, the mechanical-set dual packer can be set with
applied slackoff force by the upper tubing string.

The dual-string hydraulic-set packer is set much the same as the hydraulic-set single-string
packer.  The  setting  pressure  typically  is  applied  to  the  upper  tubing  (short  string);  however,
some models are designed to be set with pressure applied to the lower tubing (long string). A
temporary  plugging  device  is  required  to  be  run  below  the  dual  packer  on  the  appropriate
string to allow the actuating pressure to be applied.

The hydraulic-set dual packers are released by applying tubing tension to shear an internal
shear ring. The same considerations in shear-value selection that apply to the single-string hy-
draulic-set packer also apply to the dual packer. Too high of a value can overstress the tubing
during retrieval, and too low a value can lead to a premature packer release during one of the
various operational modes to which the packer will be exposed.

Other  uses  for  multiple-string  packers  include  electrical  submersible  pump  applications  in
which both the electrical cable and the production tubing must pass through the packer. Multiple-
string packers are also used in tandem to isolate damaged casing.

2.2.7 Permanent and Retrievable Sealbore Packers.  The permanent (Fig. 2.8) and retrievable
(Fig. 2.9)  sealbore  packers  are  designed  to  be  set  on  electric  wireline  or  hydraulically  on  the
tubing string. Wireline setting affords speed and accuracy; however, the one-trip hydraulic-set
versions offer the advantage of single-trip installations and allow the packer to be set with the
wellhead flanged up.

Sealbore packers have a honed and polished internal sealbore. A tubing seal assembly with
elastomeric  packing  forms  the  seal  between  the  production  tubing  and  the  packer  bore.  Well
isolation  is  accomplished  by  the  fit  of  the  elastomeric  seals  in  the  polished  packer  bore.  To
accommodate longer seal lengths, a sealbore extension may be added to the packer.

In the case of the one-trip hydraulic-set sealbore packer system, the production tubing, tub-
ing seal assembly, and packer are made up together and run as a unit. However, if the packer

IV-51

Fig. 2.7—Hydraulic-set dual-string packer.

is to be installed on electric wireline or set on a work string, the seal assembly is run on the
production tubing after the packer is installed and stabbed into the packer bore downhole.

The seal assembly may be a locator type (Fig. 2.10), which allows seal movement during
production and treating operations, or an anchor type (Fig. 2.11), which secures the seals in the
packer  bore  and  restricts  tubing  movement.  The  decision  about  the  best  seal  assembly  to  run
depends  on  tubing  movement  and  hydraulic  calculations  based  on  initial  landing,  flowing,  or
shut-in  conditions,  as  well  as  any  stimulation  or  treatment  that  may  be  planned  for  the  well.

IV-52

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 2.8—Permanent sealbore packer.

The  removable  seal  assembly  allows  tubing  to  be  retrieved  for  workover  without  the  need  of
pulling and replacing the packer.

Generally,  the  permanent  sealbore  packers,  both  wireline  and  hydraulic  set,  afford  much
higher performance in both temperature and pressure ratings than do any of the retrievable pack-
ers.  The  one  disadvantage  is  that  the  permanent  packer  must  be  milled  over  to  remove  the
packer from the wellbore. For the most part, milling is not prohibitive and, in many cases, may
never be required. However, removal may be necessary if subsequent workover operations re-
quire full-bore access to the casing below the packer or if a packer failure should occur.

Because of the complexity of their design, retrievable sealbore packers usually have a high-
er  cost  associated  with  them  (as  well  as  lower  pressure  and  temperature  ratings)  than  do  the
permanent versions. However, they are in most cases easily removable from the wellbore with-

out  milling.  Normally,  removal  is  accomplished  in  two  trips:  the  first  to  retrieve  the  seal
assembly, and the second with a releasing tool to retrieve the packer. Like the permanent seal-
bore  packer,  the  retrievable  models  are  available  in  both  wireline  and  one-trip  hydraulic-set
versions.

When making the determination of which type of packer to use, careful consideration must
be  given  to  the  completion  design,  wellbore  geometry,  and  packer-performance  requirements.
The contingency plans for packer removal must be developed and reviewed. While many tech-
nical  advances  in  milling  techniques  have  been  achieved,  it  ultimately  may  prove  more  cost-

IV-54

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

effective to use a retrievable sealbore packer in horizontal applications in which packer milling
is not desirable, or in low-fluid wells in which circulating cuttings to the surface is not possi-
ble. In applications in which it is known that the packer must be removed at some point in the
life of the well and packer milling may be prohibitive, the retrievable sealbore may be recom-
mended.

2.3 Methods of Conveyance
For the most part, both permanent and retrievable packers can be run and set on the production
tubing  string,  requiring  no  additional  trips  for  installation.  This  one-trip  system  is  both  cost-
effective and efficient. However, at times it may be necessary or desirable to install the packer
in the wellbore first and then run the production tubing. In these instances, a packer is selected
that can be run and set either on a workstring or on electric wireline. Once the packer is in-

stalled,  a  sealing  device  is  attached  to  the  end  of  the  production  tubing  and  connected  to  the
packer downhole to form a seal.

Electric wireline setting of the packer affords several benefits. First, it offers fast installa-
tion and accurate placement of the packer. This is important in instances in which the packer
must be set in a very short interval (perhaps because of damaged casing) or in cases in which
the zones are very close together. Electric wireline deployment also can allow the packer to be
installed  and  set  under  pressure  in  a  live  well  without  the  need  for  a  snubbing  unit.  In  this
case,  a  temporary  plugging  device  is  used  in  conjunction  with  the  packer  to  allow  the  well
pressure above the packer to be bled off once it is installed.

IV-56

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Running and setting the packer on a work string may be necessary in highly deviated wells
in  which  the  hole  angle  is  too  high  to  run  the  packer  in  on  electric  wireline.  Although  this
method requires the most time for packer installation, it does afford the benefit of being able
to hydraulically pressure test the packer and ensure that it is properly set before picking up and
running the production tubing.

Consideration should be given to the run-in speed of the packer, whether run on tubing or
electric line. Too fast of a run-in speed in fluid can cause the rubber element to begin to pack
off or swab. This will inflict damage to the element and lead to packer failure. Slower speeds
also afford the operator a chance to prevent damage to the packer should an obstruction in the
wellbore be encountered.

2.3.1 Landing Conditions.  The tubing string is attached to the packer by two methods:

• It is latched or fixed to the packer by means of an anchor seal assembly (in the case of a

sealbore packer) or tubing thread (most retrievable packers).

• The tubing is landed with a seal assembly and locator sub in the polished bore of a perma-
nent or retrievable sealbore packer. In this case, the upward tubing movement at the packer is
limited only by the length of the seal assembly. Any downward movement is restricted by the
locator sub.

There are basically three tubing landing conditions associated with completion packers. The
term “landing condition” refers to the amount of slackoff weight or tension that is left on the
packer when the tree is landed and the wellhead is flanged up. In these three cases, the tubing
can be landed in either tension or compression, or it can be left in neutral with no axial loads
on the packer.

Packer  design,  operational  modes,  and  hydraulics  dictate  the  optimum  landing  condition.
Many  types  of  retrievable  packers,  for  example,  often  require  either  constant  tension  or  com-
pression to maintain their seal because of design. Other models of retrievable packers mechani-
cally lock the packoff force in place and allow the tubing to be landed in tension, compression,
or neutral. The permanent or retrievable sealbore packer is extremely versatile and can accom-
modate any of the three landing conditions.

2.3.2 Through-Tubing  Operations.    Consideration  should  be  given  to  future  through-tubing
operations  such  as  coiled-tubing  operations,  swabbing,  slickline,  or  electric  wireline  work  to
ensure that the internal diameter of the completion equipment is adequate to allow passage of
the  tools.  Operational  modes  and  tubing  landing  conditions  can  cause  helical  buckling  of  the
tubing string, which also may interfere with running longer lengths of tools through the tubing
string.

Ideally,  the  inside  diameter  of  the  packer  should  be  equal  to  that  of  the  tubing  string  to
facilitate  through-tubing  operations.  This  is  especially  critical  in  monobore  well  designs,  in
which any restriction will limit access to the lower wellbore. In some high-pressure completion
designs,  obtaining  a  large  packer  ID  is  not  always  possible  because  of  packer-design  limita-
tions required to achieve the higher pressures.

Excessive  tubing  buckling  can  severely  limit  the  length  and  diameter  of  through-tubing
tools that can be run through the tubing string. Tubing buckling is caused by (1) tubing land-
ing  conditions  that  require  compression  on  the  packer;  (2)  an  overall  increase  in  tubing
temperature,  which  will  cause  the  tubing  to  elongate;  (3)  an  increase  in  internal  tubing  pres-
sure;  and  (4)  the  piston  effect  on  locator  type  seal  assemblies.  These  conditions  can  be
minimized  if  the  completion  is  designed  properly.  Care  should  be  taken  when  planning  the
completion  to  thoroughly  review  the  various  operating  conditions  to  which  the  well  will  be
subjected and to select a packer to fit the operation.1

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-57

Fig. 2.12—Casing scraper (left); wireline junk basket and gauge ring (right).

2.3.3 Casing Cleanup Operations.  Any  debris  or  obstruction  that  is  present  in  the  wellbore
can cause most packers to malfunction. Any cement that may have been left on the casing wall
from previous cementing operations, as well as scale buildup in the case of old wells, can also
lead  to  poor  packer  performance.  To  properly  grip  the  casing  and  form  a  leakproof  seal,  the
packer slip and element system must make 100% contact with the casing wall. It is advisable
to run a casing scraper or other suitable casing cleanout tool and circulate the well clean before
installing the production packer. A casing scraper should always be run in instances in which a
packer is to be conveyed through new perforations (Fig 2.12).

Before running any packer on electric wireline, it is advisable to run a wireline junk basket
and  gauge  ring  (Fig  2.12).  The  gauge  ring  has  a  slightly  larger  OD  than  the  packer  and
“gauges” the hole to ensure that there are no tight spots that might cause the packer to become
stuck,  or  accidentally  set  in  the  hole.  The  junk  basket  is  also  designed  to  collect  any  debris
that is suspended in the completion fluid that otherwise might interfere with running the packer.

IV-58

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

2.3.4 Other Casing Considerations.  Before  installing  the  packer,  a  cement  bond  log  should
be  considered  to  verify  the  integrity  of  the  primary  cementing  job  on  the  casing  string.  If  a
poor cement bond exists in the interval in which the packer is to be set, the packer’s ability to
serve as a barrier may be compromised should a leak in the casing string occur. Such a leak
could  allow  the  formation  below  to  communicate  to  the  annulus  above  the  packer.  If  such  a
channel is created, the annulus could be exposed to high formation pressures, or the formation
itself may be damaged. Either case could lead to a costly workover.

There  are  special  applications  in  which  the  packer  is  intentionally  set  in  unsupported  or
uncemented  casing.  Care  should  be  taken  in  these  instances  to  ensure  that  the  design  of  the
packer is such that radial loads and stresses created by setting the packer, and those anticipated
to  be  encountered  during  various  operating  conditions,  do  not  exceed  the  stress  limitations  of
the casing.

2.4 Metallurgy
Ideally, the packer should be built out of materials that will last the life of the well. Also, in
the case of retrievable packers that may be reconditioned and used elsewhere, the advantage of
being  able  to  reuse  the  packer  may  be  lost  if  the  well  environment  corrodes  or  damages  the
tool beyond repair. In potentially corrosive environments, material failure can lead to a packer
leak or difficulty in removing a retrievable packer from the wellbore. In these cases, corrosion-
resistant  alloy  materials  must  be  properly  selected  that  are  best  suited  to  the  downhole  well
environment. The Natl. Assn. of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) Standard MR-01-75 establishes
guidelines and acceptance criteria for material selection for sour service in H2S environments.2
Metallurgical requirements are dictated both by the downhole well environment and the de-
sign  and  performance  requirements  of  the  packer.  Consideration  must  be  given  to  both  when
selecting and specifying materials for corrosive environments. Many types of materials that are
applicable  for  tubing  and  casing  in  corrosive  environments  are  not  always  suitable  (or  practi-
cal) for packer manufacture.

Some commonly used materials for manufacture of downhole equipment are as follows:3
• Low-alloy steels with minimum yield strengths of 110 ksi are used for standard service in
noncorrosive environments. These materials are similar in property to P110 tubing and do not
meet NACE MR-01-75 requirements for sour service.4

• Low-alloy  steels  with  a  maximum  hardness  of  Rockwell  22C,  which  meet  NACE
MR-01-75 requirements, are intended for use in both standard service and service in sour H2S
environments. Materials that fall into this range would be similar in properties to J-55 to L-80
grades of tubing.

• Martensitic  steels  such  as  9%  chromium,  1%  molybdenum,  and  13%  chromium  alloy
steels  are  used  in  some  wet  CO2  environments.  Certain  grades  of  these  steels  meet  NACE
MR-01-75 requirements and can be used in limited H2S applications.5

• 22%  chromium  and  25%  chromium  duplex  stainless  steel  are  commonly  used  in  some

wet CO2 and mild H2S environments.

• Austenitic stainless steels, cold worked 3% Mo high-nickel alloy steels, and precipitation-
hardening  nickel-based  alloys  are  suitable  for  some  environments  containing  high  levels  of
H2S, CO2, and chlorides at moderately high temperatures.

The successful application of any of these materials depends strongly on the specific down-
hole well environment. Many factors such as temperature, pH, chlorides, water, H2S, and CO2
concentrations  can  have  adverse  effects  on  the  material  performance  and  can  lead  to  failures
associated with pitting, corrosion, chloride stress cracking, or hydrogen embrittlement. Because
of this and the vast number and variations of packer designs and tensile requirements of their
components, the consumer cannot know which materials are appropriate for each particular de-
sign. Ultimately, the user must rely on the packer manufacturer to help make the determination

as  to  which  materials  will  meet  the  downhole  requirements  without  sacrificing  packer  perfor-
mance and reliability.

2.5 Elastomers
There  are  many  suitable  elastomers  on  today’s  market  to  match  almost  any  downhole  condi-
tion. Care must be taken to ensure that the elastomer selected for the packer and seal assembly
meets  all  the  downhole  conditions  to  which  it  will  be  subjected.  Things  that  must  be  consid-
ered  are  the  downhole  operating  temperature;  exposure  to  produced  or  injected  fluids  and
gases; exposure to completion fluids such as oil-based mud, brine, bromides, high pH comple-
tion  fluids,  and  amine  base  inhibitors;  and  exposure  to  solvents  such  as  xylene,  toluene,  and
methanol.  There  is  no  single  best  elastomer  that  will  perform  under  all  conditions  combined,
and selection must be tailored to suit individual well requirements and application.

By far, the most common elastomer used in downhole completion packers is nitrile. Nitrile
is used in low- to medium-temperature applications for packers and packer-to-tubing seal assem-
blies  in  one  form  or  another.  It  shows  good  chemical  resistance  to  oils,  brines,  and  CO2
exposure. However, its use is limited in wells that contain even small amounts of H2S, amine
inhibitors, or high-pH completion fluids. Exposure to high concentrations of H2S and bromides
generally is not recommended.3,6

Hydrogenated nitrile or HNBR (chemical name: hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene) has a
somewhat  higher  temperature  rating  and  shows  slightly  better  chemical  resistance  to  H2S  and
corrosion  inhibitors  than  standard  nitrile.  HNBR  is  more  prone  to  extrusion  than  standard  ni-
trile  and,  as  a  result,  requires  a  more  sophisticated  mechanical  backup  system  similar  to  that
found on most permanent and higher-end retrievable packers.

Two  fluoroelastomers  that  are  commonly  used  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry  are  hexafluoro-
propylene (vinylidene fluoride, commonly known by the trade name Viton* and tetrafluoroethy-
lene  (propylene,  trade  name  Aflas**).  These  compounds  are  used  in  medium-  to  high-
temperature  applications.  Both  compounds  show  excellent  resistance  to  H2S  exposure  in
varying  limits,  CO2,  brines,  and  bromides.  However,  the  use  of  Viton  should  be  questioned
when amine inhibitors are present in packer fluids and in the case of high-pH completion fluids.
Aflas will swell when exposed to oil-based fluids and solvents. Swelling because of expo-
sure  of  Aflas  to  hydrocarbons  is  generally only  a  concern  when  running  the  tool  in  the  well.
Element swell may cause the packer to become stuck on the trip in the hole, and swelling of
the  seals  can  result  in  seal  damage  during  stab-in.  After  the  packer  is  set  and  seals  are  in
place, the swelling generally is no longer a concern.

The use of Kalrez† and Chemraz‡ in the packer industry is by and large limited to chevron-
type  “vee”  seals  and  o-rings.  On  the  cost  scale,  they  are  by  far  some  of  the  most  expensive
materials used in these designs. Kalrez and Chemraz show good resistance to most chemicals
found  in  oilwell  and  gas-well  environments.  Because  of  their  ability  to  maintain  stability  at
extreme  temperatures,  they  are  normally  recommended  for  use  in  HP/HT  applications  and  in
most environments in which high levels of H2S are encountered.

Ethylene propylene (EPDM) is an elastomer commonly used in steam-injection operations.
EPDM exhibits poor resistance to swelling when exposed to oil and solvents; however, EPDM
can operate in pure steam environments to temperatures of 550°F.

2.5.1 Packing Element.  The term “packing element” is used to describe the elastomeric seal-
ing system that creates the seal between the OD of the packer and the ID of the casing. The
ability of the packing element to hold differential pressure is a function of the elastomer pres-
sure, or stress across the seal. To form a seal, the elastomer pressure must be greater than the
differential  pressure  across  the  packer.  The  elastomer  pressure  is  generated  by  the  packoff  or
setting force applied to the packer.

The packing-element system consists of the seal or packing element and a packing-element
backup  system.  When  energized,  the  packing  element  expands  to  conform  to  the  ID  of  the
casing  wall.  The  packing-element  backup  system  contains  the  energized  packing  element  and
restricts the element from extruding or losing its elastomer pressure.

There  are  many  different  packing-element-system  designs.  Each  element-system  design  is
suited to a specific application and covers a myriad of well environments. The most basic packing-
element  system  consists  of  a  single  packing  element  with  fixed  metal  backup  rings  located
above and below the element. More sophisticated designs may consist of multidurometer elas-
tomers using a lower durometer element between two elements of a higher durometer. In this
design, the lower durometer, or softer-center element, creates the working seal while the higher
durometer,  or  harder-end,  elements  expand  to  the  casing  ID  to  restrict  extrusion.  Fixed  metal
backup rings also may be replaced with flexible or expandable backup rings to further restrict
the extrusion of the elastomer.

2.5.2 Packer-to-Tubing  Seal  Stacks.    Permanent  and  retrievable  sealbore  packers  contain  a
honed sealbore to accept packer-to-tubing seals or seal assembly to connect the tubing string to
the packer. This seal assembly, or stinger, consists of a seal sub with multiple packing units or
seal  stacks  fixed  on  its  OD.  The  packing  units  come  in  a  variety  of  configurations  and  elas-
tomeric compounds to suit a wide range of downhole conditions. There are two basic types of
packing units: bonded and chevron.

The bonded packing unit is composed of one or more metal rings, with a specific elastomer
compound bonded or molded to the ring. The bonded seal by design is slightly larger than the
ID of the sealbore, and a predetermined amount of stress on the elastomer is created when the
seals are inserted into the honed packer bore. The elastomer pressure generated by this stress in
turn creates a seal between the seal assembly and the honed packer bore.

Because the bonded seals are self-energized, they are particularly useful in LP/LT gas-injec-
tion  operations  such  as  CO2  flood  projects.  The  bonded  seals  are  also  less  susceptible  to
dynamic  unloading  damage  and  should  be  selected  any  time  that  the  seals  must  leave  the
honed bore under pressure.

Only  a  few  elastomer  compounds  are  suitable  for  use  in  bonded  seal  designs.  The  three
most common compounds found on bonded seal stacks are Nitrile, Viton, and Aflas. Also, be-
cause  the  bonding  tends  to  fail  at  higher  temperatures,  most  bonded  seals  are  generally  not
recommended for service above 300°F.

Chevron  seal  stacks  come  in  a  wide  variety  of  designs  and  elastomeric  compounds.  They
consist of a number of “vee”-shaped chevron seal rings supported by metal (or a combination
of metal and nonelastomeric) backup rings such as Ryton* or Teflon.** Each individual chevron
seal ring holds pressure in one direction only, so each seal stack must contain a number of seal
rings facing in either direction.

The  chevron  seal  stacks  are  the  most  versatile  and  widely  used.  They  are  available  with
various  elastomers  and  designs.  Common  materials  used  for  the  vee-type  seal  rings  include
nitrile (the most common), Viton, Aflas, and Kalrez. Some specialized premium seal stacks can

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-61

handle pressures up to 15,000 psi (and beyond) at temperatures approaching 550°F. Each has
its  own  environmental  application,  as  well  as  temperature  and  pressure  rating.  Matching  the
proper elastomer to the environment is a key to long-term sealing success.

The  chevron  seal  stacks  do  not  lend  themselves  well  to  differential  unloading  conditions
that  might  be  experienced  during  fracturing  or  treating  operations  in  which  locator-type  seal
assemblies are used in sealbore packers. The temperature and piston effects will cause the tub-
ing to shorten, and the seal assembly will move upward out of the packer bore. Any chevron
seal that is allowed to leave the polished sealbore will be subject to severe damage because of
the sudden change in differential pressure. Because of this, locator-type seal-assembly designs
should be such that the working seals are never allowed to leave the polished packer bore un-
der differential pressure.7

To reduce the possibility of seal failure and greatly extend the life of the seal assembly, it
is recommended that seal movement be restricted whenever possible. While both chevron and
bonded seals are designed to hold pressure under dynamic conditions, completion designs that
allow continuous seal movement over the life of the well can significantly shorten the life of
the seal. Seal movement should be eliminated altogether if possible by anchoring the seals in
the  packer  bore.  Locator  seal  assemblies  should  be  landed  so  that  the  locator  sub  will  be  in
constant  compression  when  the  well  is  producing,  thus  limiting  movement  to  those  cases  in
which the well is either treated or killed.

2.6 ISO and API Standards
The Intl. Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the American Petroleum Inst. (API) have
created  a  standard  [reference  ISO  14310:2001(E)  and  API  Specification  11D1]8,9  intended  to
establish guidelines for both manufacturers and end users in the selection, manufacture, design,
and laboratory testing of the many types of packers available on today’s market. Perhaps more
importantly, the standards also establish a minimum set of parameters with which the manufac-
turer  must  comply  to  claim  conformity.  The  International  Standard  is  structured  with  the
requirements for both quality control and design verification in tiered rankings. There are three
grades,  or  levels,  established  for  quality  control  and  six  grades  (plus  one  special  grade)  for
design verification.

The  quality  standards  range  from  grade  Q3  to  Q1,  with  grade  Q3  carrying  the  minimum
requirements  and  Q1  outlining  the  highest  level  of  inspection  and  manufacturing  verification
procedures. Provisions are also established to allow the end user to modify the quality plans to
meet his specific application by including additional needs as “supplement requirements.”

The  six  standard  design-validation  grades  range  from  V6  to  V1.  V6  is  the  lowest  grade,
and V1 represents the highest level of testing. A special V0 grade was included to meet special
acceptance criteria requirements. The following is a brief summary outlining the basic require-
ments of the various levels of test-acceptance criteria.

2.6.1 Grade V6 Supplier/Manufacturer Defined.  This  is  the  lowest  grade  established.  The
performance level in this instance is defined by the manufacturer for products that do not meet
the testing criteria found in grades V0 through V5.

2.6.2 Grade V5 Liquid Test.  In this grade, the packer must be set in the maximum ID casing
it  is  rated  for  at  the  maximum  recommended  operating  temperature.  The  testing  parameters
require that it be set with the minimum packoff force or pressure as specified by the manufac-
turer. The pressure test is performed with water or hydraulic oil to the maximum differential-
pressure  rating  of  the  packer.  Two  pressure  reversals  across  the  tool  are  required,  meaning  it
must be proved that the packer will hold pressure from both above and below. The hold peri-
ods  for  each  test  are  required  to  be  a  minimum  of  15  minutes  long.  At  the  end  of  the  test,

IV-62

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

retrievable packers must be able to be removed from the test fixture by using the procedures of
its intended design.

2.6.3 Grade V4 Liquid Test + Axial Loads.  In this grade, all parameters covered in Grade V5
apply; however, in addition to passing V5 criteria, it also must be proved that the packer will
hold  differential  pressure  in  combination  with  compression  and  tensile  loads,  as  advertised  in
the manufacturer’s performance envelope.

2.6.4 Grade V3 Liquid Test + Axial Loads + Temperature Cycling.  All test criteria mandat-
ed in Grade V4 apply to V3; however, to achieve V3 certification, the packer also must pass a
temperature cycle test. In the temperature cycle test, the packer must hold the maximum speci-
fied  pressure  at  the  upper  and  lower  temperature  limits  in  which  the  packer  is  designed  to
work.  The  test  is  started  at  maximum  temperature,  as  in  V4  and  V5;  however,  after  passing
this segment of the test, the temperature is allowed to cool to the minimum, and another pres-
sure  test  is  applied.  After  successfully  passing  the  low-temperature  test,  the  packer  also  must
pass a differential-pressure hold after the test-cell temperature is raised back to the maximum
temperature.

2.6.5 Grade V2 Gas Test + Axial Loads.  The same test parameters used in V4 apply to Grade
V2,  but  in  this  instance,  the  test  medium  is  replaced  with  air  or  nitrogen.  A  leak  rate  of  20
cm3 of gas over the hold period is acceptable; however, the rate may not increase during the
hold period.

2.6.6 Grade V1 Gas Test + Axial Loads + Temperature Cycling.  The  same  test  parameters
used in V3 apply to Grade V1, but again in this instance, the test medium is replaced with air
or nitrogen. Similar to the V2 test, a leak rate of 20 cm3 of gas over the hold period is accept-
able, and the rate may not increase during the hold period.

2.6.7 Special Grade V0 Gas Test + Axial Loads + Temperature Cycling + Bubble Tight Gas
Seal.  This is a special validation grade that is added to meet customer specifications in which
a tight-gas seal is required. The test parameters are the same as those for V1; however, a gas-
leak rate is not allowed during the hold period.

If a packer is qualified for use in a higher grade, it may be deemed suitable for use in any
of the lower validation grades. For example, if tested to grade V4, it is accepted that the pack-
er meets or exceeds the service requirements of V4, V5, and V6 applications.

2.7 Packer Rating Envelopes
Packers  are  not  only  designed  and  required  to  hold  differential  pressure  at  various  downhole
temperatures, but they also must be able to maintain pressure integrity when subjected to vari-
ous  tensile  and  compression  loads  created  by  hydraulic  and  temperature  effects  on  the  tubing
string. The rating envelope is a graphical representation of the safe operating limits of the pack-
er in combination with both differential pressure and axial loads.10,11

A packer may hold (for example) 10,000 psi differential from below with no axial loads, or
it may hold 100,000 lbf tension at 0 psi, but when the forces are combined, the stresses on the
components  and  the  element  system  may  become  too  great  and  cause  the  packer  to  fail.  The
combination of axial loading and differential pressure affects various packer models differently.
Obviously, it is important to know what the various safe operating parameters of the packer are
so that downhole failure can be avoided.

The  envelope  is  a  graph  consisting  of  two  axis  lines.  On  the  “X”  axis,  negative  values
represent  tension,  and  positive  values  equal  compression  (Fig.  2.13).  The  values  of  the  “Y”
axis  depict  differential  pressure  from  above  the  packer  as  negative  and  below  the  packer  as

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-63

Fig. 2.13—Typical packer-rating envelope.

positive. The maximum tested packer ratings under the all-combined load conditions are plot-
ted on the graph and connected by boundary lines that more or less take the shape of a box.
Any combinations of pressure and axial loads that fall within the box are considered safe and
within the tested limits of the packer.

To use the rating envelope effectively, tubing-movement calculations must be done to deter-
mine  the  packer  tubing  loads  and  differential  pressures  to  be  encountered  in  any  of  the
production,  shut-in,  injection,  or  treating  modes  to  which  the  completion  will  be  subjected.
These  points  are  then  plotted  on  the  rating  envelope  to  see  if  the  applications  fall  within  the
safe operating limits of the packer. If they do not, an alternate packer must be selected, or the
operation must be tailored to suit the limits of the packer.

2.8 Flow-Control Accessories
Flow-control accessories add to the flexibility of the cased-hole completion design and perform
a multitude of tasks, from temporarily plugging off the tubing string to establishing temporary
communication between the tubing and the annulus. Profile seating nipples and sliding sleeves
have a special locking groove and a honed sealbore to allow a flow-control device to lock in
the nipple and seal off when installed. By design, the sleeves and nipples will have a smaller
ID  than  that  of  the  tubing  string.  For  this  reason,  careful  consideration  must  be  given  to  the
overall application and completion design when selecting and sizing the various models of pro-
file  seating  nipples  and  sleeves.  This  is  especially  true  in  any  case  in  which  through-tubing
operations or perforating are planned.

IV-64

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 2.14—Wireline re-entry guide.

Correct application of flow-control accessories can greatly reduce the time and money spent
on diagnosing well problems (such as tubing or leaks) should they occur. Strategically placed
profile seating nipples above and below the packer aid in isolating the leak to the packer or the
tubing string. Once the source of the failure is known, a plan can be formulated to resolve the
problem. Not much can be done to fix a packer leak without well intervention; however, spe-
cial  flow-control  devices  are  available  to  straddle  across  sections  of  leaking  tubing  and  deter
workovers. In either case, the knowledge gained by being able to use flow-control accessories
and devices to perform downhole diagnostics is extremely valuable in planning corrective ac-
tion to be addressed in the subsequent workover.

2.8.1 Wireline Re-Entry Guides.  In some operations, it is necessary to run electric wireline,
slickline tools, or coiled-tubing assemblies past the end of the tubing string and into the casing
below (Fig. 2.14). Upon retrieving these tools, there may be problems pulling them back into
the tubing string if the tubing is run open-ended and unprotected. Sharp edges and square shoul-
ders  of  pin  threads,  couplings,  or  muleshoes  can  cause  the  tools  to  snag  or  hang  up  on  re-
entry. The wireline re-entry guide is run on the end of the tubing string (or the tailpipe below
the packer) and is designed to facilitate re-entry into the tubing string of those electric-line or
slickline  assemblies.  It  has  an  internally  beveled,  bell-shaped  ID  that  eliminates  any  sharp
edges or square shoulders and helps align the tools as they are pulled back up into the tubing
string.

2.8.2 Profile  Seating  Nipples.    Profile  seating  nipples  are  often  referred  to  as  “top  no-go,”
“bottom  no-go,”  and  “selective”  types.  As  the  names  indicate,  each  has  a  unique  machined

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-65

profile with a locking groove to accept a flow-control device that is run and installed on slick-
line  or  coiled  tubing.  The  profile  seating  nipple  also  has  a  honed  and  polished  sealbore  to
allow the slickline device to not only land and lock into the nipple, but also to seal off, assum-
ing the accessory item to be installed also has a packing stack.

Profile seating nipples are positioned at strategic locations within the tubing string to allow
the accurate placement of slickline plugs, check valves, bottomhole chokes, downhole flow reg-
ulators, and bottomhole pressure recorders. At least one profile seating nipple is recommended
near the bottom.

Top No-Go Profile Seating Nipple.  The “top no-go” nipple accepts a lock assembly with a
no-go  shoulder  located  on  the  lock  itself  (Fig.  2.15).  When  the  lock  assembly  is  run  in  the
hole, the no-go shoulder on the lock engages or locates on top of the nipple. Once located, the
locks are engaged into the locking groove, and the installation process is complete. Care must
be  taken  when  designing  the  completion  to  ensure  that  there  are  no  ID  restrictions  above  the
nipple to prevent passage of the lock assembly. The “top no-go” nipple is generally run when
a single nipple is required in the hole and the largest ID possible is required through the nipple
profile. However, more than one “top no-go” may be run if the IDs of the profiles are reduced
sufficiently as the nipples progress in the hole to allow passage of the appropriate locking as-
sembly through the nipple located immediately above the intended target nipple.

Bottom  No-Go  Profile  Seating  Nipple.    The  “bottom  no-go”  nipple  has  a  no-go  shoulder
located in the bottom of the nipple (Fig 2.16). The lock assembly or slickline device landed in
this type of nipple locates the nipple by landing on the bottom no-go. Once landed and located
in the nipple, the locks can be engaged and the installation completed. Because its ID will not
allow passage of any flow-control device through the nipple, the bottom no-go nipple is always
run as the lowermost nipple in the completion. Another benefit of having a no-go nipple in the
completion  is  that  any  other  slickline  tools  or  tubing  swabs  that  are  lost  in  the  tubing  string
should not fall to the bottom. The lost equipment usually can be fished out of the tubing string
or, in cases when it cannot, the tubing can be pulled to recover the tools.

Selective Profile Seating Nipple.  “Selective” type profile nipples are perhaps the most ver-
satile of the three (Fig 2.17). In such a design, an unlimited number of the same size and type
profile  seating  nipples  may  be  run  in  the  hole  because  the  locking  assembly  or  flow-control
device is able to find and selectively land in any of them. In most systems, either the packing
stack or a collett indicator is used to help the slickline operator locate the nipple, and alternate-
ly picking up and slacking off through the nipple actuates the locks and sets the flow-control
device. The benefit of this type system is a larger ID through the completion and fewer slick-
line accessory items that must be inventoried. Generally, it is still advised that a no-go nipple
be run on the bottom of the tubing string to prevent any lost tools from falling into the cased
hole below the completion.

2.8.3 Sliding Sleeves.  In oil- and gas-well completions, the sliding sleeve provides a means of
establishing communication between the tubing and annulus for fluid circulation, selective zone
production, or injection purposes (Fig 2.18). The sliding sleeve is ported from ID to OD and
has an internal closing sleeve that can be cycled multiple times using slickline or coiled-tubing
shifting tools. When in the open position, the sleeve allows communication from tubing to an-
nulus, and when closed, pressures are once again isolated.

The sliding sleeve also incorporates a nipple profile and polished sealbore above and below
the  ports  to  allow  the  landing  of  various  flow-control  devices  or  an  isolation  tool  should  the
sleeve fail to close. The isolation tool locks into the profile in the upper end of the sleeve, and
seal  stacks  on  the  tool  straddle  the  ports  to  achieve  isolation.  The  success  of  sliding  sleeves
depends on well conditions. High temperature, sour gas, scale, and sand may cause operational
problems in the opening and closing of sliding sleeves.

IV-66

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 2.15—Top no-go profile nipple and lock assembly.

2.8.4 Blast Joints.  The blast joint is used in multiple-zone wells in which the tubing extends
past a producing zone to deter the erosional velocity of the produced fluids and formation sand
from cutting through the tubing string. In most cases, the blast joint is simply a thick, heavy
wall  joint  of  steel  pipe;  however,  there  are  also  more  sophisticated  designs  that  use  materials
such as Carbide® for severe service applications. Care must be taken when running and spacing
out the tubing string to position the blast joint evenly across the open perforations. It is wise to
run  enough  length  of  blast  joint  to  provide  5  to  10  ft  of  overlap  across  the  perforations  to
allow for errors in tubing measurements.

2.8.5 Flow Couplings.  Flow couplings are usually the same OD as the tubing couplings and
have the same ID as the tubing string with which they are run. They are run above and below

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-67

Fig. 2.16—Bottom no-go profile nipple and lock assembly.

any profile seating nipple and sliding sleeve in which it is anticipated that the turbulence creat-
ed  by  the  flow  through  the  nipple  restriction  can  reach  erosional  velocity  and  damage  the
tubing string. The flow coupling does not stop the erosion; however, because of its thick cross
section, it can and will extend the life of the completion because more material must be lost to
erosion  before  failure  occurs  than  in  the  case  of  the  tubing  string  alone.  Flow  couplings  are
recommended  when  a  flow-control  device  is  to  be  installed  on  a  permanent  basis  (i.e.,  safety
valve or bottomhole choke).

2.8.6 Blanking  Plugs.    Blanking  plugs  may  be  landed  in  profile  seating  nipples  or  sliding
sleeves  to  temporarily  plug  the  tubing  string,  allowing  pressure  to  be  applied  to  the  tubing
string  to  test  tubing  or  set  a  hydraulic  packer,  or  to  isolate  and  shut  off  the  flow  from  the
formation. The basic blanking plug consists of a lock subassembly, a packing stack, and a plug
bottom. Each size and type of blanking plug is designed to fit a specific size and type of pro-
file  seating  nipple  or  sleeve.  Slickline  blanking  plugs  always  have  an  equalizing  device

IV-68

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

incorporated  into  the  design  to  allow  pressure  above  and  below  the  plug  to  equalize  before
releasing the lock from the nipple to prevent the toolstring from being blown up the hole.

2.8.7 Bottomhole Choke.  Bottomhole chokes are flow-control devices that are landed in pro-
file seating nipples. The bottomhole choke restricts flow in the tubing string and allows control
of production from different zones. It can be used to prevent freezing of surface controls. The
choke assembly consists of a set of locks, packing mandrel, packing assembly, and choke bean.
The choke bean is available with orifices of varying sizes. The orifice size must be predeter-
mined and sized specifically for the intended application.

2.9 Subsurface Safety Systems
If  a  catastrophic  failure  of  the  wellhead  should  occur,  the  subsurface  safety  valve  provides  a
means to automatically shut off the flow of the well to avoid disaster. There are basically two
types of downhole safety valves—subsurface-controlled safety valves and surface-controlled sub-
surface safety valves (SCSSV).12

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-69

Fig. 2.18—Sliding sleeve (shown in closed position).

2.9.1 Subsurface-Controlled  Safety  Valves.    The  subsurface-controlled  safety  valves  (often
called velocity valves or Storm® chokes) are wireline retrievable and are installed in standard
profile seating nipples in the tubing string below the surface tubing hanger (Fig 2.19). A sub-
surface  safety  valve  requires  a  change  in  the  operating  conditions  at  the  valve  to  activate  the
closure mechanism. There are two models of subsurface controlled safety valves. The velocity
valve contains an internal orifice; the orifice is specifically sized to the flow characteristics of
the well. The valve is normally open and is closed by an increase in flow rate across the ori-
fice.  This  creates  a  pressure  drop,  or  differential  pressure,  across  the  valve  that  causes  it  to
close. The velocity valve reopens when the pressure is equalized across the valve.

Another type of subsurface-controlled valve is the gas-charged or low-pressure valve. This
valve is normally closed, and the bottomhole pressure must be higher than the preset pressure

valve  for  the  valve  to  remain  open.  If  the  flow  rate  of  the  well  becomes  too  great  and  the
bottomhole  pressure  falls  below  the  preset  value  of  the  valve,  the  valve  will  automatically
close. It is reopened by applying pressure to the tubing string to raise the pressure above the
preset pressure value of the valve.

For either valve to work properly, the well must be capable of flowing at sufficient rates to
close the valve, and the catastrophe must be severe enough to create the conditions necessary
to actuate the closing system. The settings of the valves are critical to success, and they must
be checked periodically.

2.9.2 SCSSVs.  The  SCSSVs  are  also  installed  in  the  tubing  string  below  the  surface  tubing
hanger;  however,  they  are  controlled  by  hydraulic  pressure  through  a  capillary  (control)  line
that connects to a surface control panel (Fig 2.20). Most SCSSV designs today use a flapper to
form a seal. Both elastomeric and metal-to-metal seal designs are available.

The SCSSV is a normally closed (failsafe) valve and requires continuous hydraulic pressure
on  the  control  line  to  keep  it  open.  The  pressure  acts  upon  an  internal  piston  in  the  valve,
which  pushes  against  a  spring.  When  the  hydraulic  pressure  is  relieved,  the  internal  spring

IV-72

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

moves a flow tube upward and uncovers the flapper. The flapper then swings closed, shutting
the well in. Ball valves work similarly. The surface control panel, because of a change in flow-
ing  characteristics  that  exceed  predetermined  operating  limits,  generally  initiates  the  closing
sequence. However, any failure of the system that results in loss of control-line pressure should
result in the valve shutting in the well.

To open the SCSSV, the pressure above it must be equalized (usually by pressuring up on
the  tubing  string),  and  hydraulic pressure  must  be  reapplied to  the  control line. Some  models
have  a  self-equalizing  feature  and  can  be  reopened  without  the  aid  of  pressuring  up  on  the
tubing.  Whether  the  valve  is  working  or  not,  most  models  have  a  pump-through  kill  feature
that allow fluids to be pumped down the tubing to regain control of the well.

The SCSSV is available in a tubing-retrievable model and a wireline-retrievable type. The
wireline-retrievable  SCSSV  is  installed  in  a  special  ported  safety-valve  nipple.  The  capillary
line  is  connected  from  the  surface  control  panel  to  the  ported  nipple.  The  hydraulic  pressure
applied at the surface communicates to the valve through the ported nipple. The wireline-retriev-
able  SCSSV  can  be  pulled  and  serviced  without  pulling  the  tubing  string  out  of  the  hole.
However, because of the design and the use of elastomeric seals, they are somewhat less reli-
able  than  the  tubing-retrievable  version.  Because  of  its  smaller  ID,  the  wireline-retrievable
valve has a reduced flow area for production to pass through. The reduction in ID can create a
pressure  drop  across  the  valve  and  turbulence  in  the  tubing  above  it.  In  high-flow-rate  wells,
the  turbulence  can  lead  to  erosion  of  the  valve  or  tubing  string.  Access  to  the  tubing  string
below the valve is restricted when the wireline-retrievable SCSSV is installed. The valve must
be  removed  before  performing  any  through-tubing  workover  or  wireline  operations  below  the
valve.

The tubing-retrievable model is more robust and offers a larger internal flow diameter. This
helps eliminate turbulence and increases production capabilities. It also allows full-bore access
to the tubing string below the valve. One disadvantage, in some instances, is its large OD. This
may limit the size of tubing that can be run into certain sizes of casing. To service the tubing-
retrievable SCSSV, the tubing string must be retrieved. However, to avoid this and extend the
life  of  the  completion,  it  is  possible  to  disable  the  valve  permanently  by  locking  it  open.  A
new wireline-retrievable SCSSV can then be inserted into the sealbore of the retrievable valve,
enabling the well to continue production without interruption.

2.10 Cased-Hole Applications
Matching the correct equipment to the application is critical to the success of the completion.
The equipment must meet or exceed the temperature, pressure, and axial-load conditions creat-
ed by the various operating modes anticipated over the life of the well, and material selection
should match the well environment. Most of all, the completion design should be fit for pur-
pose and meet the production objectives in an efficient and cost-effective manner.13

2.10.1 Single-String LP/LT Wells.  Single-string low-pressure (less than 3,000 psi) flowing or
injection wells completed at relatively shallow depths (less than 3,000 ft) generally use a retriev-
able tension packer (Fig 2.21). This is largely out of necessity because the tubing weight is not
sufficient  to  energize  the  element  of  a  compression  set  packer,  but  it  is  also  driven  by  the
economics of the lower cost and simplistic design of the tension set packer. Another considera-
tion in injection applications is that the tubing will contract as cold fluid or gases are pumped
into  the  tubing.  This  contraction  can  remove  any  available  set-down  weight  on  a  packer  that
requires constant compressive loads to maintain its packoff and cause the packer to fail.

A wireline entry guide below the packer but above the perforations should be used to facil-
itate any through-tubing operations that are planned. It is advisable, but not mandatory, to run
a  profile  seating  nipple  either  above  or  below  the  packer.  The  addition  of  the  seating  nipple

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-73

Fig. 2.21—LP/LT completion.

allows  a  blanking  plug  to  be  run  to  test  tubing  if  a  leak  occurs,  and  the  nipple  will  act  as  a
stop should tools be lost in the hole.

2.10.2 Single-String Medium-Pressure/Medium-Temperature Wells.  In median pressure and
temperature applications, a retrievable compression/tension set versatile landing-condition pack-
er may be used. In these applications, pressures typically will range from 3,000 to 10,000 psi,
and  bottomhole  temperatures  (BHTs)  may  be  anywhere  between  100  and  300°F  (Fig  2.22).

IV-74

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 2.22—Single-string medium-pressure/medium-temperature completion.

These types of tools are generally suited for the higher pressures and temperatures that will be
encountered  because  of  the  more  sophisticated  packing-element  systems  they  have.  Also,  in
deeper installations, the addition of a bypass system aids in equalizing the tubing and annular
fluids  to  facilitate  retrieval  of  the  packer.  In  these  applications,  the  longer  tubing  length
presents a different challenge from that in the shallow applications, in which a tension packer
would have been used. In flowing wells, the tubing will heat up and elongate and add weight
to  the  packer  if  landed  with  compression  on  the  packer,  or  it  will  lose  tension  if  landed  in
tension. In injection wells, the opposite will be true. Careful consideration should be given to
these conditions and to future planned pumping or stimulation operations and their effects on
tubing movement when making a packer selection.

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-75

As for most wells equipped with packers, a wireline entry guide on the bottom of the pack-
er  will  aid  in  guiding  electric-line  and  coiled-tubing  tools  back  into  the  tubing  string  when
performing through-tubing operations. A profile seating nipple is run below the packer to facili-
tate  the  running  of  bottomhole-pressure  recorders  or  to  allow  a  blanking  plug  to  be  installed
for  temporary  well  control.  A  second  profile  seating  nipple  may  be  run  above  the  packer  to
test and verify tubing integrity or to land a bottomhole choke. The addition of a sliding sleeve
or gas-lift mandrel with a dummy to the tubing string allows the tubing to be displaced with
lighter fluid to bring the well in or circulate kill-weight fluid into the tubing string during sub-
sequent workover operations while the wellhead is flanged up.

2.10.3 Single-String  HP/HT  Wells.    In  HP/HT  applications,  where  the  pressure  can  exceed
10,000  psi  and  temperatures  are  above  300°F,  a  permanent  sealbore  packer  is  generally  used
(Fig.  2.23).  However,  there  are  some  specialized  retrievable  packers  that  can  work  in  these
applications under limited conditions.

The  permanent  sealbore  packers  are  very  versatile  and  are  designed  to  accommodate  the
extreme tubing movement and high axial packer-to-tubing forces encountered in HP/HT comple-
tions. Tubing-movement calculations should be performed to determine the length changes and
stresses on the tubing string in the production, shut-in and treating, or injection modes. Depend-
ing on the length changes and stress created on the tubing, a permanent packer with a located
(floating) or fixed (anchored) seal assembly may be required.

As before, a wireline-entry guide on the bottom of the packer will aid in guiding electric-
line and coiled-tubing tools back into the tubing string when performing through-tubing opera-
tions. One, and in some instances two, profile seating nipples are run in the tailpipe below the
sealbore  packer  for  landing  bottomhole-pressure  recorders  and  facilitating  well  control  during
completion and workover operations. The seal assembly may be anchored into the packer or a
locator  type  with  additional  seal  length  to  accommodate  tubing  movement.  A  profile  seating
nipple is run above the seal assembly for tubing-test purposes or for landing a bottomhole choke.

2.10.4 Multiple-Zone  Single-String  Selective  Completion.    Multizone  single-string  comple-
tions  with  median  temperatures  and  differential  pressures  will  likely  use  hydraulic-set  single-
string retrievable packers (Fig 2.24). This style of completion allows all the available zones in
the well to be completed at once and produced individually or commingled. Sliding sleeves are
positioned between each isolation packer. There is no limit to the number of packers and slid-
ing  sleeves  that  may  be  run;  however,  each  addition  should  be  justified.  When  one  zone
depletes, the workover is accomplished with slickline by landing a blanking plug in the lower-
most  profile  nipple  or  opening  and  closing  one  or  more  of  the  sliding  sleeves.  It  should  be
noted  that  complex  completion  designs  with  multiple  packers  and  accessories  cost  more  and
often increase major workover costs significantly. The designer should have a feasible plan for
pulling the well’s tubing string(s).

The  hydraulic-set  retrievable  packers  can  be  run  in  on  one  trip  and  set  simultaneously  by
applying  pressure  to  the  tubing  against  a  plug  set  below  the  lowermost  packer.  After  setting
the packers, the plug may be retrieved and the lowermost zone may be produced or, alternate-
ly, one of the sliding sleeves may be opened to produce one of the corresponding upper zones.
A  profile  seating  nipple  is  run  below  the  lowermost  packer  to  accept  a  blanking  plug  (or
check  valve)  to  set  the  hydraulic-set  packers  and  to  provide  well  control  for  the  lower  zone.
Sliding  sleeves  are  positioned  between  each  packer  for  zonal  isolation.  Blast  joints  should  be
positioned  across  the  perforations  between  the  isolation  packers  to  reduce  the  risk  of  erosion
damage  to  the  tubing  string  from  well  fluids  and  produced  sand.  A  sliding  sleeve  or  gas-lift
mandrel  with  dummy  may  be  positioned  above  the  uppermost  hydraulic-set  packer  to  aid  in
circulating  kill  fluid  in  the  hole  or  circulating  lighter  fluid  or  gas  in  the  tubing  to  bring  the
well on production.

2.10.5 Dual-Zone  Completion  Using  Parallel  Tubing  Strings.    The  dual-zone  completion
method generally is used in applications in which it is desirable to produce two zones simulta-
neously while keeping them isolated from each other (Fig 2.25). In this completion, two strings
of tubing are run from the surface to the dual packer. One string terminates at the dual packer,
and the other string of tubing extends from the dual packer to the lower single-string packer.
The  tubing  string  that  produces  the  upper  zone  is  referred  to  as  the  “short  string”  (or  upper
tubing), and the tubing string that produces the lower zone is called the “long string” (or lower
tubing).

In cases in which the zones are of equal pressure and crossflow is not an issue during the
completion  stage,  a  single-string  hydraulic-set  packer  may  be  used  as  the  lower  packer.  This

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-77

Fig. 2.24—Multiple-zone single-string selective completion.

allows  the  entire  completion  to  be  run  in  a  single  trip  and  both  packers  to  be  set  after  the
wellhead is flanged up.

In  parallel  string  completions  in  which  the  zones  are  subject  to  crossflow  because  of  un-
equal pressures, the lowermost single-string packer is generally a sealbore packer. The sealbore
packer is set with a temporary plug in place for well control before perforating and running the
upper  completion.  The  plug  keeps  the  two  zones  separated  until  the  upper  completion  is  in-
stalled and the wellhead is flanged up.

IV-78

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 2.25—Parallel-string dual-zone completion.

The upper packer in this example is a hydraulic-set dual-string retrievable packer. Models
exist  that  can  be  set  by  applying  pressure  to  the  long  string,  but  the  more  common  models
require  the  short  string  to  be  pressurized  to  accomplish  packer  setting.  The  decision  about
which type depends on the various operations that are planned.

A profile seating nipple is run below the lowermost packer and below the dual packer on
the  short  string  to  accept  a  blanking  plug  (or  check  valve)  to  set  the  packer  and  to  provide
well  control.  A  sliding  sleeve  is  positioned  between  the  packers  for  aid  in  circulating  kill-

weight fluid in the hole or circulating lighter fluid or gas in the tubing strings to bring the well
on production. A blast joint should be positioned across the perforations of the zone between
the packers to reduce the risk of erosion damage to the long string from well fluids and pro-
duced  sand.  Profile  seating  nipples  should  be  run  above  the  dual  packer  on  both  strings  for
well control or testing tubing for well-diagnostic purposes.

2.10.6 Big-Bore/Monobore Completions.  In  highly  prolific  reservoirs,  tubing  of  6⅝  in.  and
larger diameters is required to meet cost-effective production and injection objectives. The use
of  big  monobore-completion  techniques  can  increase  production  rates  significantly  while  de-
creasing both capital and operating expenses. The advantages of the big monobore completion
systems  include  the  elimination  of  gas-turbulence  areas  and  restrictions  on  production  while
providing access for well-intervention purposes. This can translate to fewer wells required for
optimized reservoir production, resulting in a faster return on initial investments and lower long-
term operating expense.14

Big monobore completions are basically liner-top completion systems. The key is the large
ID tubing that allows increased production rates and provides full-bore access to the production
liner. This full-bore access gives the operator the ability to run conventional tools through the
tubing  to  perform  remedial  work  in  the  production  liner  without  disturbing  the  completion  or
pulling the production tubing. There are many styles of monobore completions from which to
choose. The selection of the type system that is used depends largely on the pressure integrity,
and the pressure capability, of the liner top and intermediate casing string.

In  the  most  basic  monobore-completion  design  (Fig  2.26),  the  production  liner  is  run  and
cemented  in  the  hole.  At  the  top  of  the  liner  hanger  is  a  polished  bore  receptacle  (PBR)  to
accept  a  seal  assembly.  The  production  tubing  that  is  used  has  basically  the  same  ID  as  the
liner.  When  the  completion  is  run,  a  seal  assembly  is  run  on  the  bottom  of  the  production
tubing and landed in the PBR. The seal assembly and liner top provide the annular barrier for
the tubing string. The constraints of this system are that the ID of the polished bore receptacle
can become damaged during liner cleanout trips and fail to seal, and the ability of the liner top
to  hold  pressure  is  totally  dependent  on  the  quality  of  the  cement  job.  Remedial  work  to  the
liner may be required before running the completion.

A more reliable monobore system (Fig 2.27) will use a packer above the liner top. In this
system, the liner is run and cemented as before; however, when the completion is run, a large-
bore hydraulic-set permanent packer is installed. The packer will have a PBR located above it,
with  the  tubing  seals  run  in  place.  There  is  also  a  seal  assembly  on  the  tailpipe  below  the
packer, which is stabbed into the liner top. The packer provides a more positive annular barri-
er, and a new PBR has been installed.

2.11 Multilateral Completions
Multilateral  completion  systems  allow  the  drilling  and  completion  of  multiple  wells  within  a
single wellbore. In addition to the main wellbore, there are one or more lateral wells extending
from the main wellbore. This allows for alternative well-construction strategies for vertical, in-
clined, horizontal, and extended-reach wells. Multilaterals can be constructed in both new and
existing  oil  and  gas  wells.  A  typical  installation  includes  two  laterals;  the  number  of  laterals
would  be  determined  by  the  number  of  targets,  depths/pressures,  risk  analysis,  and  well-con-
struction parameters.

Multilateral systems combine the advantages of horizontal-drilling techniques with the abili-
ty  to  achieve  multiple  target  zones.  The  advantages  of  horizontal  drilling  include  higher
production indices, the possibility of draining relatively thin formation layers, decreased water
and  gas  coning,  increased  exposure  to  natural  fracture  systems  in  the  formation,  and  better
sweep efficiencies. Depending on the type of multilateral design used, the target zones can be

isolated and produced independently—or produced simultaneously, if commingled production is
allowed or if a parallel string completion is used.

The various degrees of multilateral systems have been categorized by the Technology Ad-
vancement  of  MultiLaterals  (TAML),  a  group  of  operators  and  suppliers  with  experience  in
developing  multilateral  technology.  The  TAML  system  for  multilateral-well  classification  is
based  on  the  amount  and  type  (or  absence)  of  support  provided  at  the  lateral  junction.  There
are six industry levels defined by TAML; this categorization system makes it easier for opera-

tors to recognize and compare the functionality and risk-to-reward evaluations of one multilater-
al  completion  design  to  another.  As  the  TAML  level  increases,  so  does  the  complexity  and
cost of the system.15

2.11.1 TAML  Level  1.    The  most  fundamental  multilateral  system  consists  of  an  openhole
main bore with multiple drainage legs (or laterals) exiting from it (Fig 2.28). The junction in

IV-82

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

in lateral or main bore.

this design is left with no mechanical support or hydraulic isolation. The integrity of the junc-
tion is dependent on natural borehole stability; however, it is possible to land a slotted liner in
the lateral or the main bore to help keep the hole open during production. The production from
a Level 1 system must be commingled, and zonal isolation or selective control of production is
not  possible.  Re-entry  into  either  the  main  bore  or  the  lateral  may  be  difficult  or  impossible
should well intervention be required in the future.

2.11.2 TAML Level 2.  This system is similar to Level 1, with the exception that the laterals
are drilled off of a cased and cemented main bore (Fig 2.29). The cased main bore minimizes
the  chances  of  borehole  collapse  and  provides  a  means  of  hydraulic  isolation  between  zones.
As  with  Level  1,  there  is  no  actual  mechanical  support  of  the  lateral  junction;  however,  it  is
possible to run a slotted liner into the lateral to maintain borehole stability.

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-83

Fig. 2.29—TAML Level 2: cased and cemented main bore with an openhole lateral; an unsupported slotted
liner or screen may be installed in the lateral.

2.11.3 TAML Level 3.  The Level 3 system again uses a cased and cemented main bore with
an openhole lateral (Fig 2.30). However, in this design, a slotted liner or screen is set in the
lateral  and  anchored  back  into  the  main  bore.  This  system  offers  mechanical  support  of  the
lateral junction, but the advantage of hydraulic isolation is lost, and the zones must be commin-
gled to be produced. The production from the zone below the junction must flow through the
whipstock  assembly  and  past  the  slotted  liner  to  reach  the  main  bore.  This  system  provides
easy access into the lateral for coiled-tubing assemblies, but re-entry into the main bore below
the junction is not possible.

2.11.4 TAML Level 4.  This system offers both a cased and a cemented main bore and lateral
(Fig 2.31). This gives the lateral excellent mechanical support, but the cement itself does not
offer pressure integrity at the junction. While the cement does protect the junction from sand

infiltration  and  potential  collapse,  it  is  not  capable  of  withstanding  more  than  a  few  hundred
psi of differential. There is a potential for failure if the junction is subjected to a pressure draw-
down,  as  might  be  experienced  in  an  electrical  submersible  pump  (ESP)  application.  Zonal
isolation  and  selectivity  is  possible  by  installing  packers  above  and  below  the  junction  in  the
main bore. Systems are available that also offer coiled-tubing intervention, both into the lateral
and into the main bore below the junction.

2.11.5 TAML Level 5.  The  Level  5  multilateral  is  similar  in  construction  to  the  Level  4  in
that it has both a cased and a cemented main bore and lateral, which offers the same level of
mechanical integrity (Fig 2.32). The difference is that pressure integrity has now been achieved
by using tubing strings and packers to isolate the junction. Single-string packers are placed in
both  the  main  bore  and  lateral  below  the  junction  and  connected  by  tubing  strings  to  a  dual-
string  isolation  packer  located  above  the  junction  in  the  main  bore.  This  system  offers  full
access  to  both  the  main  bore  and  the  lateral.  The  zones  can  be  produced  independent  of  one
another, or the completion can be designed to allow them to be commingled.

2.11.6 TAML Level 6.  In  the  Level  6  multilateral  system,  both  mechanical  and  pressure  in-
tegrity  are  achieved  by  using  the  casing  to  seal  the  junction  (Fig  2.33).  Cementing  the
junction,  as  was  done  in  the  Level  4  system,  is  not  acceptable.  The  Level  6  system  uses  a
premanufactured  junction.  In  one  type  of  system,  the  junction  is  reformed  downhole.  In  yet

ical support, but the cement does not provide pressure integrity for the junction.

another, two separate wells are drilled out of a single main bore, and the premanufactured junc-
tion is assembled downhole.

2.12 Operational Well Modes
There  are  four  modes  of  operation  that  any  given  well  might  experience:  shut-in;  producing
(liquid, gas, or a combination); injecting (hot or cold liquids, or gases); or treating (high, low,
or  intermediate  pressures  and  volumes).  It  is  important  that  all  planned  operations  be  consid-
ered when designing the completion and selecting a packer. While the primary application may
be  oil  or  gas  production,  any  subsequent  operations  (such  as  acidizing  or  fracturing  the  well)
and their associated pressure and temperature changes are extremely important to packer utiliza-
tion success.16,17

IV-86

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 2.32—TAML Level 5: cased and cemented main bore and lateral; pressure integrity across the junction
is achieved through use of tubing and isolation packers.

Typical temperature vs. depth profiles are illustrated in Figs 2.34 through 2.37. These pro-
files  are  similar  to  those  measures  in  wells  operating  in  the  shut-in,  producing,  injecting,  or
treating modes.

Fig. 2.34 depicts a typical geothermal gradient, with the temperature increasing with depth
to that of the BHT. Every time a well is shut in, the operating temperature will begin to move
toward the shape of the natural geothermal profile.

Producing-well-temperature profiles for both oil and gas wells are shown in Fig. 2.35. The
wellhead temperature of an oil well will be somewhat less than the BHT. The amount of cool-
ing  as  crude  flows  to  the  surface  will  depend  on  several  factors:  the  relative  amounts  of  oil
and water, the specific heats of oil and water, the flow rate, the gas/liquid ratio, the vertical-
flow  pressure  drop  that  controls  the  gas  liberated  and  the  attendant  cooling  effect,  and  the
thermal heat transfer rate from the wellbore.

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

IV-87

Fig. 2.33—TAML Level 6: mechanical and pressure integrity at the junction is achieved by using casing
to seal the junction.

The temperature profile of a gas well may have a wellhead temperature lower than ambi-
ent.  In  any  case,  the  wellhead  temperature  of  a  gas  well  will  depend  on  the  BHT,  the  flow
rate, the pressure drop in the tubing, the specific heat of the gas, and other factors.

Injection-temperature  profiles  can  be  quite  varied  (Fig  2.36).  The  profile  will  depend  on
such  factors  as  the  nature  of  the  injection  fluid  (liquid  or  gas),  the  rate  of  injection,  and  the
injected-fluid  temperature  (cold  or  hot  liquids  or  gas,  or  even  steam).  Initial  temperatures  of
injected  fluids  are  also  subject  to  seasonal  changes.  These  changes  can  become  more  severe
depending on the local geography and climate in which the operation is being performed. Inject-
ed liquids will tend to have little heat gain or loss as they are pumped down the tubing string,
while injected gases will tend to pick up or lose heat to approach the BHT.

While treating is simply a special case of the injection mode and is temporary in nature, it
is considered important enough to be discussed separately. As with the liquid-injection profile

IV-88

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 2.34—Shut-in.

[for rates above 1 barrel per minute (BPM)], the treating liquid will not pick up any apprecia-
ble  amount  of  heat  as  it  moves  down  the  tubing,  and  the  treating  temperature  is  essentially
vertical (Fig 2.37).

As illustrated in some examples later, the important thing about these profiles is not their
shape  but  how  much  the  shape  and  temperature  change  from  one  operation  mode  to  another,
and how those temperature changes affect the tubing and packer system. It is strongly recom-
mended  that  anticipated  temperature  profiles  for  each  operational  mode  be  drawn  accurately
when planning the various steps of any completion or major workover.

Figs.  2.38  through  2.41  show  the  pressure  profiles  of  the  four  modes  of  well  operation.
Fig. 2.38 illustrates a typical shut-in well with well-servicing fluid in the wellbore. The slope
of the profile and the height to which the fluid level rises on the depth scale (and in the well-
bore) will depend on the average reservoir pressure, pR, and the gradient of the well-servicing
fluid.  Fig.  2.39  shows  the  profiles  of  typical  producing  oil  and  gas  wells.  A  liquid-injection
profile  (Fig.  2.40)  is  similar  to  the  shut-in  profile,  the  difference  being  that  the  bottomhole

injection pressure, (pi)bh, is greater than the average reservoir pressure, pR. The wellhead pres-
sure, pwh, can have any value, from a vacuum to several thousand psi. The gas-injection profile
may  have  a  reverse  slope  on  it,  or  it  may  have  a  normal  but  steep  slope,  depending  on  the
rate, tubing size, and bottomhole injection pressure.

The  treating  pressure  (Fig.  2.41)  is  a  special  temporary  case  of  the  injection  profile.  The
bottomhole treating pressure, (pt)bh, often will be greater than the injection pressure, especially
in a fracturing job. The surface pressure will be constrained by the burst strength of the tubing
and casing and the safety considerations. The slope of the pressure profile will depend on the
tubing size, the treating rates, and the treating pressure downhole, (pt)bh.

It is recommended that pressure profiles for each operational mode be drawn for each step
of the completion or major workover. As the examples will point out, the importance of pres-
sure changes from one well mode to another and their effects on the tubing and packer system
cannot be overemphasized.

2.13 Impact of Length and Force Changes to the Tubing String
Changing the mode of a well (producer, injector, shut-in, or treating) causes changes in temper-
ature  and  pressure  inside  and  outside  the  tubing.  After  the  packer  is  installed  and  the  tubing
landed,  any  operational  mode  change  will  cause  a  change  in  length  or  force  in  the  tubing
string. The resultant impact on the packer and tubing string is dependent on (1) how the tubing
is  connected  to  the  packer,  (2)  the  type  of  packer,  (3)  how  the  packer  is  set,  and  (4)  tubing
compression or tension left on the packer.

The length and force changes can be considerable and can cause tremendous stresses on the
tubing string, as well as on the packer under certain conditions. The net result could reduce the
effectiveness  of  the  downhole  tools  and/or  damage  the  tubing,  casing,  or  even  the  formations
open to the well. Failure to consider length and force changes may result in costly failures of
such operations as squeeze cementing, acidizing, fracturing, and other remedial operations.

Potential tubing-length changes must be understood to determine the length of seal neces-
sary  to  remain  packed  off  in  a  polished  sealbore  packer,  or  to  prevent  tubing  and  packer

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

damage when seals are anchored in the packer bore. Potential induced forces need to be calcu-
lated to prevent tubing and packer damage, unseating packers, or opening equalizing valves.

There  are  four  factors  that  tend  to  cause  a  change  in  the  length  or  force  in  the  tubing
string1,18: the temperature effect, which is directly influenced by a change in the average tem-
perature  of  the  string;  the  piston  effect,  caused  by  a  change  in  the  pressure  in  the  tubing  or
annulus above the packer acting on a specific affected area; the ballooning effect, caused by a
change in average pressure inside or outside the tubing string; and the buckling effect, which
occurs when internal tubing pressure is higher than the annulus pressure.

Buckling will shorten the tubing string; however, the others may tend to lengthen or short-
en the string depending on the application of the factors. As long as the tubing is allowed to
move in the packer bore, the temperature and ballooning effects will only have an impact on
tubing-length  changes,  but  if  movement  is  prevented  (or  restrained)  at  the  packer,  these  two
factors would then create a force.

It  is  important  to  remember  that  a  string  of  tubing  landed  in  any  packer  is  initially  in  a
neutral condition, except for any subsequent mechanical strain or compression loads applied by

IV-92

the  rig  operator.  After  the  tubing  is  landed,  the  factors  that  cause  changes  in  length  or  force
are always the result of a change in temperature and pressure.

2.13.1 Piston Effect.  The  length  change  or  force  induced  by  the  piston  effect  is  caused  by
pressure  changes  inside  the  annulus  and  tubing  at  the  packer,  acting  on  different  areas  (Fig.
2.42). The length and force changes can be calculated as follows:

ΔL1 =

−L
E As

(A p − Ai)Δpi − (A p − Ao)Δpo ...................................... (2.1)

and F1 = (A p − Ai)Δpi − (A p − Ao)Δpo, ........................................ (2.2)
where  ΔL1  =  length  change  because  of  the  piston  effect,  F1  =  force  change  because  of  the
piston effect, L = tubing length, E = modulus of elasticity (30,000,000 for steel), As = cross-

sectional area of the tubing wall, Ap = area of the packer bore (values for common sizes can be
found in Table 2.1), Ai = area of the tubing ID, Ao = area of the tubing OD, Δpi = change in
tubing pressure at the packer, and Δpo = change in annulus pressure at the packer.

Note that the length change ΔL1 is a product of L/EAs and the piston force (F1). The piston
force  is  the  sum  of  two  pressures  acting  on  two  areas—one  for  the  tubing  and  one  for  the
annulus.  The  area  acted  upon  by  changes  in  pressure  in  the  tubing  is  the  cross-sectional  area
between  the  area  of  the  packer  bore  and  the  area  of  the  tubing  ID  in  square  inches  (Ap–Ai).
The area acted upon by changes in pressure in the annulus is the cross-sectional area between
the area of the packer bore and the area of the tubing OD in square inches (Ap–Ao).

Fig. 2.42a shows a large-bore packer with a tubing string that has both a smaller OD and
ID than the packer bore. In this instance, annulus pressure causes downward force, while tub-
ing  pressure  causes  an  upward  force.  For  a  small-bore  packer,  this  situation  is  reversed  (Fig.

IV-94

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 2.40—Injecting.

2.42b).  The  force  greatest  in  magnitude  will  determine  the  resulting  direction  of  action.  An
accurate  schematic  of  the  tubing  and  packer  bore  for  each  case  should  be  made  for  proper
determination of areas, forces, and the resulting direction of action.

It is possible to eliminate the forces generated on the tubing string by the piston effect by
anchoring the seals in the packer bore. In a string that is restrained at the packer from move-
ment in either direction, the piston effect on the tubing string is zero. All the forces are now
being absorbed or contained completely within the packer.

2.13.2 Buckling Effects.  Tubing strings tend to buckle only when the internal tubing pressure
(pi)  is  greater  than  the  annulus  pressure  (po).  The  result  is  always  a  shortening  of  the  tubing
string, but the actual force exerted is negligible. The decrease in length occurs because of the
tubing string being in a spiral shape rather than straight. The tubing-length change is calculated
with the following:

ΔL2 =

where ΔL2 = length change because of the buckling effect; r = radial clearance between tubing
OD and casing ID, [(IDC – ODt)/2]; Ap = area of the packer bore; Ai = area of the tubing ID;
Ao = area of the tubing OD; Δpi = change in tubing pressure at the packer; Δpo = change in
annulus pressure at the packer; E = modulus of elasticity (30,000,000 for steel); I = moment of
inertia of tubing about its diameter [I = π/64 (D4 –d4, where D is the tubing OD and d is the
tubing ID*]; Ws = weight of tubing per inch*; Wi = weight of fluid in tubing per inch*; and
Wo = weight of displaced fluid per inch.* (* = values for common tubing sizes can be found in
Tables 2.2 and 2.3).

IV-96

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

2.13.3 Ballooning and Reverse Ballooning.  The ballooning effect is caused by the change in
average pressure inside or outside the tubing string. Internal pressure swells or “balloons” the
tubing and causes it to shorten. Likewise, pressure in the annulus squeezes the tubing, causing
it to elongate. This effect is called “reverse ballooning.” The ballooning and reverse ballooning
length change and force are given by

ΔL3 =

−2Lγ

E

Δpia − R2Δpoa

(R2 − 1)

.................................................. (2.4)

and F3 = − 0.6(ΔpiaAi − ΔpoaAo), ............................................ (2.5)
where  ΔL3  =  length  change  because  of  ballooning/reverse  ballooning,  F3  =  force  change  be-
cause  of  ballooning/reverse  ballooning,  L  =  tubing  length,  γ  =  Poisson’s  ratio  (0.3  for  steel),
E = modulus of elasticity (30,000,000 for steel), Δpia = change in average tubing pressure, Δpoa
= change in average annulus pressure, Ai = area of the tubing ID, Ao = area of the tubing OD,
and R = ratio of tubing OD to ID (given in Table 2.2) for common tubing sizes and weights.

The ballooning effect will always result in tubing-length changes, but it does not become a

force unless the tubing movement is restrained at the packer.

2.13.4 Temperature Effect.  Thermal expansion or contraction causes the major length change
in  the  tubing.  Heated  metal  expands,  and  cooled  metal  contracts.  In  a  long  string  of  tubing
with a temperature change over its entire length, this contraction or elongation can be consider-
able.  The  three  operational  modes  that  influence  temperature  effect  are  producing,  injecting
(water, gas, or steam), and treating.

The change in tubing length because of temperature effect is calculated as follows:

ΔL4 = LβΔt, ............................................................... (2.6)

where ΔL4 = change in tubing length, L = tubing length, β = coefficient of thermal expansion
(0.0000069 for steel), and Δt = change in average temperature.

Length changes are calculated readily if the average temperature of the tubing can be deter-
mined  for  the  initial  condition  and  then  again  for  future  operations.  The  average  string

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

temperature  in  any  given  operating  mode  is  approximately  one-half  the  sum  of  the  tempera-
tures  at  the  top  and  the  bottom  of  the  tubing.  Thus,  in  the  initial  condition,  the  average
temperature would be based upon the mean yearly temperature and the BHT. The mean yearly
temperature is generally considered to be the temperature 30 ft below ground level; Δt  is the
difference between the average temperatures of any two subsequent operating modes.

If tubing movement is constrained, forces will be introduced as a result of the temperature

change. The temperature-induced force is

F4 = 207ASΔt, ............................................................. (2.7)

where F4 = pounds force (tensile or compression, depending on the direction of Δt), AS = cross-
sectional area of the tubing wall, and Δt = change in average tubing temperature.

2.13.5 Net  Results  of  Piston,  Buckling,  Ballooning,  and  Temperature  Effects.    The  net  or
overall  length  change  (or  force)  is  the  sum  of  the  length  changes  (or  forces)  caused  by  the
temperature, piston, and ballooning effects. The direction of the length change for each effect
(or action of the force) must be considered when summing them. It follows that for a change

IV-98

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

in  conditions,  the  motion  (or  force)  created  by  one  effect  can  be  offset,  or  enhanced,  by  the
motion (or force) developed by some other effect.

Mosely19 presented a method for graphically determining the length and force changes as a
result of buckling and ballooning (L2, L3, and F3). This method is particularly useful on a field-
wide basis, where wells have the same-size tubing, casing, and packers.

When planning the sequential steps of a completion or workover, care should be taken to
consider  the  temperatures  and  pressures  in  each  step  once  the  tubing  and  packer  systems  be-
come  involved.  By  careful  selection  of  the  packer  bore  and  use  of  annulus  pressures,  one
pressure effect (or a combination of pressure effects) could be used to offset the adverse length
or force change of another effect.

2.14 Combination Tubing/Packer Systems
Uniform  completions  have  been  discussed  previously  (i.e.,  a  single  tubing  and  casing  size).
Hammerlindl20 presented a method for solving problems with combination completions. A com-
bination  completion  consists  of  (1)  more  than  one  size  of  tubing,  (2)  more  than  one  size  of
casing, (3) two or more fluids in the tubing and/or annulus, or (4) one or more of these. His
paper in particular covered two items not previously addressed by Lubinski et al.18 He includes
a  direct  mathematical  method  for  calculating  forces  in  uniform  completions  in  which  tubing
movement  is  not  permitted  and  a  method  of  handling  hydraulic  packers  is  set  with  the  well-
head in place.

There  are  several  computer  programs  available  today,  modeled  after  Hammerlindl’s  meth-
ods, that can easily calculate the length changes and forces generated by changes in tempera-
ture  and  pressure  within  the  wellbore.  These  programs  not  only  determine  critical  length

Chapter 2—Completion Systems

changes but also the stresses generated on the tubing string and packer. The use of such pro-
grams is recommended.

2.14.1 Tubing/Packer Forces on Intermediate Packers.  Intermediate packers are an integral
part of the tubing string. Examples are dual packers and single-string selective-completion pack-

IV-100

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

ers.  The  packer-to-tubing  force  on  the  intermediate  packer  is  needed  so  that  wells  can  be
treated through the tubing string. Without proper design, it is possible to shear the release mech-
anism in the intermediate packer(s) or permanently corkscrew the tubing between the intermedi-
ate  packer  and  lower  packer,  either  of  which  would  result  in  an  expensive  failure  of  the
completion or workover.

Hammerlindl21 wrote an extension of his20 and Lubinski et al.’s18 earlier works that devel-
oped  a  theory  required  to  solve  for  the  intermediate  packer-to-tubing  forces.  The  calculation
procedure  regarding  pressure  effects  requires  working  the  problem  from  the  lowest  packer  to
the surface in sections. The first section is the tubing between the bottom and second packers.
The second section is the tubing between the second and third packers (or the surface if there
are only two packers). The procedures are the standard ones for uniform completions. The only
changes are those to determine the changes in length as a result of applied forces on the inter-
mediate packers; in addition, the actual and fictitious force-calculation procedures are modified.
After the results of each section have been resolved, the sections must be looked at as a whole
to determine the net results on the packer(s). Interested readers are referred to Hammerlindl’s
1980 paper22 for additional information on the nebulous fictitious force of Lubinski et al.18

3.1 Introduction
Tubing is the normal flow conduit used to transport produced fluids to the surface or fluids to
the  formation.  Its  use  in  wells  is  normally  considered  a  good  operating  practice.  The  use  of
tubing permits better well control because circulating fluids can kill the well; thus, workovers
are simplified and their results enhanced. Flow efficiency typically is improved with the use of
tubing. Furthermore, tubing is required for most artificial lift installations. Tubing with the use
of a packer allows isolation of the casing from well fluids and deters corrosion damage of the
casing.  Multicompletions  require  tubing  to  permit  individual  zone  production  and  operation.
Governmental rules and regulations often require tubing in every well. Permission may be ob-
tained for omission of tubing in special cases (tubingless completions). These special comple-
tions  typically  are  flowing  wells  with  relatively  small  casing.  Tubing  strings  are  generally  in
outside diameter (OD) sizes of 2⅜ to 4½ in. but may be as large as 20 in. or as small as 1.050
in.

The proper selection, design, and installation of tubing string are critical parts of any well
completion.  See  the  chapter  on  inflow  and  outflow  in  this  section  of  the  handbook  for  more
information. Tubing strings must be sized correctly to enable the fluids to flow efficiently or to
permit installation of effective artificial lift equipment. A tubing string that is too small causes
large  friction  losses  and  limits  production.  It  also  may  severely  restrict  the  type  and  size  of
artificial lift equipment. A tubing string that is too large may cause heading and unstable flow,
which  results  in  loading  up  of  the  well  and  can  complicate  workovers.  The  planned  tubing
must  easily  fit  inside  the  installed  casing.  When  selecting  the  material,  environmental  condi-
tions,  the  projected  corrosivity  of  the  well  fluids,  the  minimum  and  maximum  pressures  and
temperature, safety aspects, and cost-effectiveness must be considered.

The tubing must be designed to meet all stresses and conditions that occur during routine
operation of the well and should have an adequate margin for unusual load conditions. It must
withstand  the  stresses  caused  by  tension,  burst,  and  collapse,  and  it  must  resist  the  corrosive
action of well fluids throughout the well life. In addition, the tubing must be handled and in-
stalled so that the tubing produces the well without failure or without causing undue operating
problems.

3.2 Oilfield Tubing
The  American  Petroleum  Institute  (API)  developed  Specifications,  Recommended  Practices,
and  Bulletins  for  steel  tubing  that  meet  the  major  needs  of  the  oil  and  gas  industry.1–13  API
documents are  reviewed  and  updated every  5  years.  This  effort  continues, and  many  of  these
documents  (with  modifications)  have  become  International  Organization  for  Standardization
(ISO) documents. Currently, API and ISO are the international standards for products intended
for worldwide use in the petroleum and natural gas industry. The information in API and ISO
documents is covered here in some detail. API tubing sizes range from ODs of 1.050 to 4.500
in. For high-rate wells, tubing larger than 4½ in. may be beneficial. API and ISO specifications
contain provisions when casing is used as tubing.

In addition to API steel tubing, there are hostile well conditions that may be better served
by other materials. There are proprietary steel grades that do not conform to all aspects of the
API  specifications  but  are  used  in  the  petroleum-producing  industry  for  resistance  to  weight-
loss  corrosion,  higher  strengths,  less  susceptibility  to  sulfide  stress  corrosion  cracking  (SSC),
and  wear  resistance.  Corrosion-resistant  alloy  (CRA)  is  a  special  material  that  is  sometimes
used  in  hostile  environments.  These  special  materials  are  usually  expensive  but  may  prove
worthwhile over the life of the well; however, CRA tubing does not always eliminate corrosion
and  may  be  incompatible  with  some  completion  fluids.  See  ISO  13680  for  information  on
CRA seamless tubes.14

Thermoplastic (fiberglass) tubing has been used successfully in corrosive wells. Most ther-
moplastic  tubing  has  good  tension  properties  and  burst  resistance,  but  has  relatively  small
collapse-pressure resistance and poorer wear resistance properties than steel tubing. If tempera-
tures exceed 150°F, a derating service factor may be required. Other metals and materials have
been  used  as  tubing  but  rarely  are  used  in  current  oil  and  gas  completions  either  because  of
their cost or because of limited applicability.

3.3 API/ISO Tubing Requirements
API  has  numerous  manufacturing  requirements  for  tubing.  The  tubing  purchaser  and  designer
should  be  aware  of  these  requirements  and  of  API  testing  procedures  (see  API  Spec.  5CT).10
All tubing should meet API minimum requirements. In critical wells, the purchaser may want
to receive and review the manufacturer’s test results. For tubing used in sour wells (wells with
H2S  content  greater  than  0.05  psi  partial  pressure),  the  specific  sour  service  requirements
should be reviewed.

When placing orders for tubing to be manufactured in accordance with API Spec. 5CT, the
purchaser  should  consult  API  Spec.  5CT  Sec.  4.  At  a  minimum,  the  following  requirements
should be specified on the purchase order: the specification (API/ISO), quantity, size designa-
tion (OD, normally in inches), weight designation, grade and type, end finish (type of connec-
tion), range length, seamless or electric weld, delivery date, and shipping instructions.

API tubing specifications contain several provisions that are optional for the purchaser and
other stipulations that are by agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. Some of
these added provisions may be critical to a particular application; therefore, familiarity with API/
ISO tubing specifications is needed.

3.3.1 Tubing Connectors/Tubing Joints.  API developed specifications for three different con-
nectors  for  use  as  tubing  joints:  external-upset  tubing  and  coupling,  non-upset  tubing  and
couplings, and integral-joint tubing. Fig. 3.1 shows API tubing joint connections. All three con-
nections have tapered and round thread forms with either 8 or 10 threads/in., depending on the
size.  When  casing  is  used  as  tubing,  long-thread  coupling/short-thread  coupling  and  buttress-
thread coupling connections can be specified.

The  API  external-upset-end  (EUE)  tubing  connection  is  widely  used  because  it  is  a  good,
serviceable  connection  in  most  wells.  The  EUE  joint  has  a  designed  joint  strength  in  tension

from API Spec. 5CT.10)

and  pressure  strength  greater  than  that  of  the  pipe  body  and,  therefore,  is  considered  a  100%
joint  efficient  connection.  For  proper  lubrication  and  sealing,  the  joint  requires  a  good  thread

IV-108

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

compound as outlined in API RP 5A3.1 To improve the seal performance of API EUE tubing
in  high-pressure  service,  a  grooved  coupling,  which  accepts  nonmetallic  seal  rings,  is  some-
times used in the coupling (see API Spec. 5CT SR 13). To provide more clearance, API special
clearance EUE couplings are available. API EUE joints come in OD sizes of 1.050 to 4.500 in.
API nonupset (NUE) tubing is used much less than EUE tubing. The cost of NUE is only
slightly less than EUE, and the joint strength is substantially less. The coupling joint diameter
of  NUE  is  less  than  EUE,  which  offers  some  advantages  when  clearance  is  small.  API  NUE
joints are available in sizes of 1.050 to 4.500 in.

API  integral-joint  tubing  is  available  in  OD  sizes  of  1.315  to  2.063  in.  API  integral-joint
tubing  has  a  10-round  form  with  a  joint  strength  that  is  less  than  the  body  minimum  yield,
which restricts its use. The small OD of integral-joint tubing permits its use inside larger tub-
ing  strings  or  in  wells  as  unloading  or  vent  strings.  Table  3.1  lists  API  tubing  size,  designa-
tions, ODs, wall thickness, grade, and applicable end finish.

Tables 3.2 and 3.3 list the coupling dimensions, weights, and tolerances for NUE and EUE
tubing  couplings.  The  couplings  should  meet  all  the  minimum  requirements  outlined  in  API
Spec. 5CT.10 API Spec. 5B3 and API RP 5B14 cover threading, gauging, and thread inspection.
Table  3.4  shows  EUE  tubing  thread  gage,  NUE  tubing  thread  gage,  and  integral-joint-tubing
thread gage dimensions.

Several  proprietary  (non-API)  connections  are  available.  These  joints  are  useful  when
greater  leak  resistance  or  more  clearance  is  needed  than  that  provided  by  the  standard  API
joints. These specialty joints obtain their improved properties through unique thread profiles, a
torque shoulder, metal-to-metal seals, seal rings, internal upsets, external upsets, integral joints,
etc. Tubing reference tables, which summarize the available non-API tubing joints and tubing,
are  published  yearly  in  trade  magazines  such  as  World  Oil.  Many  operators  commonly  use
these  proprietary  connections  in  critical  wells.  Before  ordering  or  using  a  specific  proprietary
tubing connection in a critical well, the suitability of such a connection for a particular applica-
tion must be assessed by either a review of service history or a comprehensive connection test
program such as ISO 13679.15 Sec. 3.7 discusses the use of coiled tubing in some well comple-
tions.  See  API  RP  5C79  for  guidelines  on  its  use.  For  information  on  workovers  with  coiled
tubing, review the chapter on workover design and procedures in the Drilling Engineering sec-
tion of this Handbook.

3.3.2 Process of Manufacture.  Tubing made to API specifications uses seamless or electric-
weld  processes.  Seamless  pipe  is  defined  as  a  wrought  steel  tubular  product  made  without  a
welded  seam.  It  is  manufactured  by  hot-working  steel  or,  if  necessary,  by  subsequently  cold-
finishing  the  hot-worked  product  to  produce  the  desired  shape,  dimensions,  and  properties.
Because of the nature of the manufacturing, the cross section of the tubing wall area may be
slightly eccentric and the tubing slightly oval and not perfectly straight.

Electric-welded pipe has one longitudinal seam formed by electric-resistance or electric-in-
duction  welding  without  the  addition  of  filler  metal.  The  edges  to  be  welded  are  pressed
together mechanically, and the heat for welding is generated by the resistance to flow of elec-
tric current. The weld seam of electric welded pipe is heat-treated after welding to a minimum
temperature of 1,000°F or processed so that no untempered martensite remains. See API Spec.
5CT for exceptions.10

Both seamless and electric-weld processes are acceptable for most oil and gas services, but
some prefer seamless tubulars for sour service because the electric-weld process may result in
a slightly different grain structure near the weld. Such differences are usually eliminated if the
electric-weld tubing is heat-treated by the quenched-and-tempered process, which is mandatory
for API grades L80, C90, T95, and P110. Couplings usually are made of seamless tubular prod-
uct of the same grade and type as the pipe.

3.3.3 API Grades.  API standardized several grades of steel that have different chemical con-
tent, manufacture processes, and heat treatments and, therefore, different mechanical properties.
API organized these tubing grades into three groups. Group 1 is for all tubing in grades H40,
J55, and N80. Group 2 is for restricted-yield tubing grades L80, C90, and T95. Group 3 is for
high-strength  tubing  in  seamless  grade  P110.  The  API  grade  letter  designation  was  selected
arbitrarily to provide a unique name for various steels. Numbers in the grade designation indi-
cate the minimum yield strength of the steel in thousand psi. API defines the yield strength as
the  tensile  stress  required  to  produce  a  specific  total  elongation  per  unit  length  on  a  standard
test specimen. Table 3.5 lists the manufacture process and heat treatment of API tubing, Table

Chapter 3—Tubing Selection, Design, and Installation

IV-111

3.6  lists  the  chemical  requirements,  and  Table  3.7  lists  the  API  tubing  strength  and  hardness
requirements.

API Tubing Grade Guidelines.  The  following  guidelines  apply  to  the  use  of  API  tubing

grades.

• H40—Although an API grade, H40 is generally not used in tubing sizes because the yield
strength is relatively low and the cost saving over J55 is minimal. Suppliers do not commonly
stock this grade.

• J55—A  commonly  used  grade  for  most  wells  when  it  meets  the  design  criteria.  Some
operators  recommend  it  be  full-length  normalized  or  normalized  and  tempered  after  upsetting
when  used  in  carbon  dioxide  or  sour  service  (ring-worm  corrosion  problems);  however,  such

IV-112

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

heat treatments increase costs. J55 has been the “standard” grade for tubing in most relatively
shallow (< 9,000 ft) and low-pressure (< 4,000 psi) wells on land.

• C75—No longer an official API grade and generally not available. It was developed as a

higher-strength material for sour service but was replaced by L80 tubing.

• N80—A relatively old grade with essentially open chemical requirements. It is susceptible
to H2S-induced SSC. It is acceptable for sweet oil and gas wells when it meets design condi-
tions. The quenched-and-tempered heat treatment is preferred. The N80 grade is normally less
expensive than L80 grades.

Chapter 3—Tubing Selection, Design, and Installation

IV-113

• L80—A restricted yield-tubing grade that is available in Type 1, 9 Cr, or 13 Cr. Type 1
is less expensive than 9 Cr and 13 Cr but more subject to weight-loss corrosion. L80 Type 1 is
used commonly in many oil and gas fields because of higher strength than J55. L80 is satisfac-
tory for SSC resistance in all conditions but may incur weight-loss corrosion. Though popular
in the past for CO2- and mild H2S-contaminated wells, Type 9 Cr largely has been replaced by
Type 13 Cr. L80 13 Cr tubing has gained popularity because it has good CO2-induced weight-
loss corrosion resistance properties; however, it is more costly. Type 13 Cr may not be suitable
in sour service environments. Typically, the H2S partial pressure should be less than 1.5 psi for
safe  use  of  L80  Type  13  Cr.  The  user  should  consult  National  Assn.  of  Corrosion  Engineers
(NACE) MR-01-75.16

• C90—A relatively new API grade with two different chemical requirements: Type 1 and
Type  2.  Only  Type  1  is  recommended  for  use  in  sour  service.  Typically,  this  grade  must  be
special ordered; its use has been generally supplanted by T95.

• T95—A high-strength tubular grade that has different chemical requirements: Type 1 and
Type  2.  Only  Type  1  is  recommended  for  sour  service.  T95  is  SSC  resistant  but  not  weight-
loss resistant.

• P110—The old P105 tubing grade, which allowed a normalized and tempered heat treat-
ment, was discontinued, and the casing P110 grade, which is restricted to quench-and-tempered
heat treatment, was adopted. This high-strength tubing typically is used in deep sweet oil and
gas wells with high pressures. This grade is sensitive to SSC failures unless the temperatures
are relatively high (> 175°F). The P110 grade is slightly more expensive than L80 Type 1 but
usually less expensive than the C90 and T95 API restricted-yield grades.

• Q125—Although not a specific API tubing grade, users can order Q125 API tubing. Type

1 chemistry is preferred.

3.3.4 API Markings.  API products (tubing, pup joints, and couplings) should be stenciled or
a combination of stamping and stenciling as per API Spec. 5CT. The sequence of stencil mark-
ing  is  as  follows:  manufacturer’s  name,  monogram  marking,  end  finish,  size  designation,
weight  designation,  grade  and  type,  impact  test  temperature,  heat  treatment,  manufacture  pro-
cess, supplementary requirements, hydrostatic test pressure, type of thread, size of drift, serial-
ization  of  Grades  C-90  and  T-95,  and  plating  of  coupling.  Impact  test  temperature,  heat

IV-114

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

treatment, supplementary requirements, type of thread, and plating of coupling are included if
applicable. Table 3.8 shows tubing color coding.

3.3.5 Tubing  Range  (Length)  and  Size  Tolerances.    API  acknowledges  two  tubing  length
ranges:  Range  1  from  20  to  24  ft  and  Range  2  from  28  to  32  ft.  Range  2  is  normally  used.
Shorter tubing joints (pup joints) are available in 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-ft lengths with a
tolerance  of  ±  3  in.  A  complete  set  of  tubing  pups  with  the  same  connections  as  the  tubing
string typically is purchased for each well. Table 3.9 shows the tolerances on dimensions and
weight.

Chapter 3—Tubing Selection, Design, and Installation

IV-115

3.3.6 API Test Pressures.  API requires that plain-end pipe be tested only to 3,000 psi maxi-
mum, except by agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. Various tubing grades
and  sizes  can  be  tested  hydrostatically  to  higher  values  as  listed  in  API  Spec.  5CT.  The  API
hydrostatic test pressures specified are inspection test pressures. They do not necessarily have
any direct relationship to working pressures but should be considered when establishing design
factors. Care should be taken if test pressures are to be exceeded in well operations. The fol-
lowing equation is used to determine the maximum hydrostatic test pressure.

ph =

2 × (0.8 × σ y × t)

do

, ...................................................... (3.1)

where  ph  =  the  80%  hydrostatic  test  pressure  (rounded  to  the  nearest  100  psi);  σy  =  yield
strength for pipe body, psi; t = wall thickness, in.; and do = tubing OD, in.

A  maximum  test  pressure  during  manufacturing  of  10,000  psi  is  imposed  because  of  test
equipment  limitations.  Manufacturers  also  can  conduct  hydrostatic  tests  at  a  fiber  stress  not
exceeding 80% of the specified minimum yield strength. The hydrostatic test pressures are cal-
culated  from  Eq.  3.1,  except  when  a  lower  pressure  is  required  to  avoid  leakage  because  of
insufficient coupling strength or interface pressure between pipe and coupling threads. The low-
er  pressures  are  based  on  formulas  given  in  API  Bull.  5C3.7  The  production  hydrostatic  test
pressure for threaded pipe are standard pressures listed in the API tables or a higher test pres-
sure as agreed on by the purchaser and the entity performing the threading.

3.4 Tubing Design Factors
A  design  factor  is  the  specific  load  rating  divided  by  the  specific  anticipated  load.  A  design
factor less than 1.0 does not necessarily mean the product will fail, and neither does a design
factor in excess of 1.0 mean that the product will not fail. As a result, design factors are gener-
ally selected on the basis of experience. The designer has the responsibility to select the design
factors to suit particular needs and to reflect field experience. The condition of the tubing and
the  severity  of  a  failure  should  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  design  factors  used.  Design
factors greater than 1.0 are recommended. Table 3.10 contains design factor guidelines.

The internal-yield pressure rating for tubing is based on an API variation of Barlow’s for-
mula  and  incorporates  a  0.875  factor  that  compensates  for  the  12.5%  reduction  tolerance  in
wall thickness allowed in manufacturing.

pyi =

0.875 × 2 × σ y × t

do

. ................................................... (3.2)

IV-116

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

In  general,  these  values  should  not  be  exceeded  in  operation.  To  be  on  the  safe  side,  a
minimum design factor of 1.25 based on the internal-yield pressure rating is suggested; howev-
er, some operators use different values.

In medium to high pressure wells, especially in sour service when L80, C90, and T95 API
grades  are  used,  the  general  stress  level  in  the  tubing  should  not  exceed  the  minimum  yield
strength for L80 or the SSC threshold stress (generally 80% of the minimum yield strength) for
C90 and T95 grades.

The joint or body yield strength for the tension design factor varies widely in practice. A
simple approach is to assume a relatively high design factor of 1.6 based on the tubing weight
in air and ignore other loading conditions. The calculations for loads in tension are usually for
static  conditions  and  ignore  dynamic  loads  that  may  occur  in  running  and  pulling  the  tubing.
They  also  may  ignore  collapse  loads  that  reduce  tension  strengths.  The  pulling  or  drag  loads
are  not  commonly  known.  These  may  be  relatively  high  in  directional  wells.  Typically,  the
highest loads in tension occur in unsetting the packer during pulling operations. In some cases,
shear pins in packers result in substantial loads in unsetting that should be accounted for in design.
The  condition  of  the  tubing  after  several  years  of  service  in  the  well  is  another  unknown
that needs to be compensated for either in design or by use of a higher tension design factor.
When considering all these factors and making adjustments for drag, shear pins, and collapse
pressures, a minimum design factor of 1.25 in tension for pulling is suggested. However, field
experience has shown, in general, that tubing in new condition (meets API minimum require-
ments) can be loaded in tension to its minimum yield joint strength during pulling operations
without a tension failure. Tension failures during pulling operations should be avoided because
the results usually are costly. It is better to cut or back off the tubing rather than have a ten-
sion failure. Table 3.11 shows approximate setting depths for various API grades.

A collapse resistance design of 1.1 is suggested. Collapse resistance for tubing is covered
in API Bull. 5C3.7 This standard provides conservative values for design, assuming the tubing
cross section is not abnormally elliptical (oval). Any mechanical deformity in the tubing result-
ing  in  an  out-of-round  cross  section  may  cause  a  considerable  reduction  in  its  collapse
resistance. The collapse resistance value for a given tubing size, weight, and grade is based on
numerous experimental tests and strength of material equations. The minimum value is designat-
ed  as  the  API  collapse resistance rating. Collapse ratings  are  reduced  by  tension  loading. For
example, a 23% yield stress in tension reduces the collapse resistance by approximately 14%.
The biaxial effect should be used to design the tubing for critical tension and collapse condi-
tions. Fig. 3.2 shows an ellipse of biaxial yield stress.

Chapter 3—Tubing Selection, Design, and Installation

IV-117

Fig. 3.2—Ellipse of biaxial yield stress.

3.4.1 Tubing Design Considerations.  Tubing string design must consider all reasonably antic-
ipated  loads  imposed  during  running,  producing,  stimulation,  workovers,  and  pulling  opera-
tions. The design must ensure that failures will not occur under these operations; however, the
designer  typically  selects  the  most  economical  weight  and  grade  that  meets  the  performance
requirements.  Computer  software  is  available  for  tubing  design,  but  the  designer  must  ensure
that all design conditions are met adequately.

A  reasonable  approach  must  be  taken  to  prevent  overdesign.  The  design  need  not  prevent
worst-case scenario failures but rather for all cases that have a reasonable probability of occur-
ring.  For  instance,  assume  that  there  is  a  shallow  tubing  leak  in  which  the  shut-in  tubing
pressure is applied in the casing annulus on top of a column of heavy annulus fluid and, subse-
quently, that the tubing pressure at bottom is reduced quickly to a low value. This event would
require  tubing  with  a  very  high  collapse  pressure  rating.  If  such  a  condition  is  considered  to
have a reasonable probability of occurring, the tubing string should be designed accordingly or
adequate steps should be taken to prevent such a series of events.

IV-118

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

The highest tensile loads normally occur at or near the top (surface) of the well. Collapse
loads reduce the permitted tension loads, as shown by the biaxial graph in Fig. 3.2, and should
be considered when applicable. Fortunately, the casing annulus pressure is normally low at the
surface; thus, collapse pressure effects at the surface often can be ignored, but not in all cases.
Buoyancy,  which  reduces  the  tensile  loads,  is  sometimes  ignored  on  shallow  wells,  but  it
should be considered on deeper wells. A condition that frequently determines the required ten-
sion yield strength of the tubing occurs when unsetting a partially stuck packer or using a shear-
pin-release type packer in wells in which buoyancy is not applicable.

High-burst  tubing  loads  typically  occur  near  the  surface  with  little  or  no  annulus  pressure
under  shut-in  tubing  conditions  or  during  well  stimulation  treatments  down  the  tubing.  High-
burst conditions also may occur deep in the hole with high surface pressures imposed on top of
relatively high-density tubing fluid and when the annulus is empty or contains a light-density
annulus fluid. Both of these conditions must be evaluated during the design of a tubing string
for a specific well.

The  burst  resistance  of  the  tube  is  increased  because  of  tension  loading  up  to  a  certain
limit.  In  tubing-  and  casing-design  practice,  it  is  customary  to  apply  the  ellipse  of  plasticity
only  when  a  detrimental  effect  results.  For  a  conservative  design,  this  increase  in  burst  resis-
tance  normally  is  ignored.  Compression  loads  reduce  burst  resistance  and  must  be  considered
when  they  occur.  Such  a  condition  can  occur  near  the  bottom  of  the  well  with  a  set-down
packer and a relatively high internal tubing pressure and a relatively low annulus pressure. A
typical design case in burst is to assume that the tubing is full of produced fluid and that the
annulus is empty, which is a common situation for pumped wells.

Because  tension  loading  reduces  collapse  resistance,  the  biaxial  effect  should  be  used  to
design for problem regions. A common practice in tubing design is to assume that the tubing is
empty  and  that  the  annulus  is  full  of  fluid.  Such  conditions  are  common  in  low-pressure  gas
wells or oil wells that may be swabbed to bottom. Typically, the highest collapse pressures are
near  the  bottom  of  the  well.  For  combination  tubing-string  design,  the  collapse  and  tensile
loads should be evaluated at the bottom and top of any tubing size, weight, or grade change.

In directional wells, the effect of the wellbore curvature and vertical deviation angle on the
axial  stress  on  the  tubing  body  and  couplings/joints  must  be  considered  in  the  tubing  design.
Current  design  practice  considers  the  detrimental  effects  of  tubing  bending,  but  the  favorable
effect (friction while running) is neglected. Wall friction, which is unfavorable for upward pipe
movement, generally is compensated for by addition of an acceptable overpull to the free-hang-
ing axial tension. Overpull values are best obtained from field experience but can be calculated
with available commercial software computer programs.

3.4.2 Single and Combination/Tapered Tubing Design.  Many  operators  prefer  one  uniform
weight (constant ID) and API grade tubing from top to bottom. Thus, it is not possible to mix
different sections of the tubing during running or pulling operations throughout the life of the
well. Most relatively shallow (< 9,000 ft), low-pressure (< 4,000 psi) wells have noncombina-
tion strings. As the pressures and depths increase, there comes a point at which a higher grade
(stronger) or heavier weight (increased wall thickness) tubing must be used to meet load condi-
tions and achieve acceptable design factors. For the same size diameter tubing, a higher grade
normally is preferred over an increase in tubing weight. Such a choice is usually less expensive
and maintains a constant internal diameter, which simplifies wireline operation inside the tubing.
Unlike casing design, which often has numerous grades and weights in a combination de-
sign, tubing design seldom has more than two different grades or weights. Such restriction may
increase the cost of the tubing string but simplifies the running and pulling procedures. Deep
and high-pressure wells may require more than two weights, grades, or diameters. When more
than  one  grade  or  weight  are  used,  each  should  be  easily  identifiable.  To  separate  different
weights and grades, a pup joint or different collar types may be used. For example, one section

Chapter 3—Tubing Selection, Design, and Installation

IV-119

could  use  standard  couplings  and  another  could  use  beveled  couplings.  Painted  and  stenciled
markings  on  the  outside  of  the  tubing  are  inadequate  once  the  tubing  is  used  because  such
markings are often obliterated.

The  use  of  two  or  three  different  diameter  sizes  is  sometimes  advantageous.  The  larger
tubing size may have high-joint-yield strength and permit a higher flow rate. The largest diam-
eter is run on the top and a smaller tubing size on bottom. In such cases, the surface wellhead
valves often are sized to permit wireline work in the larger tubing to prevent operational prob-
lems.  A  smaller  tubing  OD  size  on  bottom  may  be  necessary  because  of  casing  diameter
restrictions.

3.4.3 Tubing Outside Diameter Limitations.  The  tubing  OD  must  have  adequate  clearance
with the casing ID. The tubing size selected should permit washover and fishing operations, in
case the tubing becomes stuck and requires recovery. A wash pipe must be available that has
an outside coupling dimension less than the casing drift diameter and an internal drift diameter
that  is  greater  than  the  tubing  coupling  OD  plus  provide  a  minimum  of  ⅛-in.  clearance  for
adequate circulation. Also, the tubing OD should permit use of an overshot inside the casing,
which limits the tubing OD size and/or the coupling OD. For example, 3½-in. OD tubing with
regular  API  EUE  couplings  (OD  =  4.500  in.)  inside  5½-in.,  17.00  casing  (drift  diameter  =
4.767 in.) could not be washed over with available wash pipe. Even 3½-in. specialty joint tub-
ing  with  a  joint  OD  of  3.875  in.  would  be  an  impractical,  risky  washover  operation  because
the  couplings  would  require  milling.  Nevertheless,  special  circumstances  may  require  special
proprietary tubing in close tolerance applications. Special wash-pipe sizes often can be rented
from  the  tool  service  companies.  The  tubing  designer  should  check  the  success  of  washover
and fishing operations for their particular planned condition and the area of operation.

Multicompletions with parallel tubing strings often result in limiting the tubing and/or cou-
pling size. If two tubing strings are to be run and pulled independently, the sum of the tubing
coupling ODs should be less than the casing drift diameter. For example, inside 7-29.00 casing
with  a  drift  diameter  of  6.059  in.,  parallel  2⅜-in.  tubing  strings  with  EUE  couplings  may  be
planned. In such a case, beveled and special-clearance couplings with an OD of 2.910 in. typi-
cally are used. The sum of the two ODs is 5.82 in. Experience shows that if the couplings are
beveled (top and bottom), these strings can be run and pulled independently. The auxiliary tub-
ing equipment such as gas lift mandrels and safety valves often cause more clearance problems
than the tubing couplings.

If  two  tubing  strings  are  to  be  run  clamped  together,  then  the  sum  of  the  smaller  tubing
body  OD  and  the  OD  of  the  coupling  of  the  second  or  larger  string  must  be  less  than  the
casing  drift  diameter.  In  these  cases,  a  full-size  drawing  of  the  cross  sections  of  the  tubulars
used may be helpful. The actual clearance may depend on the clamp design. The use of paral-
lel  strings  of  3½-in.  tubing  inside  9⅝-in.  casing  is  another  common  practice,  and  tubing  OD
limitations must be considered in such installations.

3.4.4 API Minimum Performance Properties of Tubing.  Tubing  performance  properties  are
found  in  API  Bull.  5C2,6  and  the  formulas  used  in  the  following  examples  are  found  in  API
Bull. 5C3.7 Table 3.12 shows minimum tubing performance properties.

Example 3.1  Design  a  tubing  string  for  a  9,000-ft  hydropressured  vertical  well  that  is
relatively  straight,  that  will  be  used  to  flow  500  BOPD,  and  that  will  be  completed  inside
4½-11.60-K55  casing.  The  well  is  to  be  completed  with  compression-set  type  packer  and  9.0
ppg inhibited salt water in annulus. An overpull to free the packer of 15,000 lbf is anticipated.
A maximum surface-treating pressure of 3,000 psi is expected.

Solution.  Select  2⅜-4.70-J55  EUE  tubing  (see  Table  3.12).  The  2⅜-in.  size  is  suitable  for
the flowing rates (see the chapter on inflow in this section of the handbook), and larger EUE
tubing  sizes  cannot  be  run  and  washed  over  inside  this  size  and  weight  casing.  Smaller  OD
sizes  of  tubing  will  save  no  significant  investment  and  will  complicate  wireline  work.  Select
the lightest standard weight available for the initial design and check to ensure that it meets all
design conditions. The J55 grade is the most cost-effective grade available. It typically is used
as a first selection for most relatively shallow, low-pressure, and low-rate design cases.

Calculate the fluid gradient, gf.

g f = (0.433 psi / ft / 8.32 lbm / gal) × w f

lbm / gal

= (0.052 psi / ft / lbm / gal) × 9.0 lbm / gal = 0.468 psi / ft . ......................... (3.3)

0.052  psi/ft/lbm/gal  is  obtained  from  0.433  psi/ft/8.32  lbm/gal,  which  is  the  conversion  factor
from lb/gal to psi/ft.

Check design conditions for tension. Calculate the resulting hook load for a 9,000-ft length

of tubing in air from

Fa = L p × wn

= 9,000 ft × 4.7 lbm / ft = 42,300 lbf . ......................................... (3.4)

The value of wn is obtained from Table 3.12. This calculation results in a superimposed tubing
tension axial (hook) load at the surface in air of 42,300 lbf.

The weight of the tubing string in a fluid is the tubing weight in air minus the axial buoy-

ancy load(s):

times the hydrostatic pressure at depth,

pbh = DtV × g f , ............................................................ (3.7)

are used to calculate the axial buoyancy load,

Fb = Am × pbh . ............................................................ (3.8)

In this example,

Am =

π(do

= 3.1416 × (2.3752 – 1.9952) / 4 = 1.304 in.2,

pbh = DtV × g f = 9,000 ft × 0.468 psi / ft = 4,212 psi,
and Fb = Am × pbh = 1.304 in.2 × 4,212 psi = 5,492 lbf .

Chapter 3—Tubing Selection, Design, and Installation

IV-125

Eq. 3.5 can now be used to calculate the hook load in fluid at surface before setting the packer.

F f = Fa − Fb = 42,300 lbf – 5,492 lbf = 36,808 lbf .

Compare these values to the tubing performance properties. With a joint-yield strength rat-

ing, Fj, of 71,700 lbf (see Table 3.12) the design factor in tension in air is

Dt = Fj / Fa

= 71,700 / 42,300

= 1.6, .................................................................... (3.9)

which is an acceptable design factor in tension in air, whereas the design factor in fluid is

Dt = Fj / F f

= 71,700 / 36,463
= 1.97, .................................................................. (3.10)

which is an acceptable design factor in tubing considering buoyancy.

Consider  pulling  conditions.  With  a  stuck  packer  requiring  15,000  lbf  of  overpull,  Fop,  at

packer to free, assume no buoyancy contribution because the packer is stuck.

Ft = Fa + Fop

= 42,300 + 15,000
= 57,300 lbf. ............................................................. (3.11)

The design factor when considering overpull is

Dt = Fj / Ft

= 71,700 / 57,300
= 1.25, .................................................................. (3.12)

which is an acceptable design factor in tension during pulling operations.

An overpull any greater than 15,000 lbf would not be acceptable because Dt would be less

than 1.25.

Check burst and collapse loads and compare to the tubing performance properties. The max-

imum allowed internal pressure differential is

pi = pyi / Db
= 7,700 / 1.25

= 6,160 psi. .............................................................. (3.13)

With  an  internal-yield  burst-pressure  rating,  pyi,  of  7,700  psi  (see  Table  3.12)  and  a  wellhead
surface pressure, pwh, of 3,000 psi, calculate the design factor in burst.

Db = pyi / pwh
= 7,700 / 3,000
= 2.57, .................................................................. (3.14)

IV-126

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

which is an acceptable design factor in burst and is much higher than the 1.25 suggested.

The minimum collapse pressure without axial stress, pcr, = 8,100 psi (See Table 3.12). As-
sume an annulus full of 9.0 ppg fluid and an empty tubing string. With Eq. 3.7, pbh = 9,000 ft
× (9.0 × 0.052) psi/ft = 4,212 psi.

Dc = pcr / pbh
= 8,100 / 4,212
= 1.92, .................................................................. (3.15)

which is an acceptable design factor in collapse and is much higher than the 1.1 suggested.

Check  burst  at  bottom  of  hole  under  pumping  conditions.  Assume  tubing  filled  with  9.0

ppg salt water with 100 psi surface tubing pressure and empty annulus.

pbh = DtV × gt + pwh

= 9,000 ft × (9.0 × 0.052) psi / ft + 100 psi

= 4,312 psi . ............................................................. (3.16)

Db = pyi / pbh
= 7,700 / 4,312
= 1.79, .................................................................. (3.17)

which is an acceptable design factor in burst.

Select and order tubing material. Order per API Spec. 5CT: 9,000 ft plus 300 ft of 2⅜-4.70-
J55  EUE-8R,  range  2,  seamless  or  electric  weld,  and  one  set  of  pups  with  standard  EUE
couplings. In addition, order one container of API-modified thread compound and specify deliv-
ery date and shipping instructions.

Example 3.2  Design tubing for relatively deep high-pressure gas well with CO2 and H2S.
Assume the following conditions: casing designation = 5½-23.00-L80; measured depth, Dm, =
14,000  ft;  true  vertical  depth,  DtV,  =  13,000  ft;  gas  rate  =  15  MMcf/D,  10  bbl  of  condensate
per MMcf, 40 ppm hydrogen sulfide resulting in a partial pressure of 0.40 psi for the H2S and
a 2% (20,000 ppm) carbon dioxide; pwh = 10,000 psi during stimulation; pbh = 9,000 psi; Tbh =
250°F; Tsf = 125°F; completion fluid weight = 14.0 ppg of inhibited solids free salt water; fluid
gradient = 0.728 psi/ft; anticipated drag on tubing when pulling = 5,000 lbf; and packer shear
pins setting = overpull = 25,000 lbf.

Solution. Because of the anticipated rate of 15 MMcf/D, 2⅞-in. tubing will permit flow at a
significantly  higher  rate  than  2⅜-in.  tubing.  The  use  of  3½-in.  tubing  is  not  normally  recom-
mended  within  5½-in.  casing  because  fishing  operations  would  be  difficult.  On  the  basis  of
experience, the use of 3½-in. tubing rather than 2⅞-in. tubing would not significantly improve
the production rate in this case.

Select the tubing weight and grade. Because surface pressures of 10,000 psi are anticipated,
the tubing must have a minimum internal-yield pressure greater than 10,000 psi. With a design
factor  of  1.25  in  burst,  the  required  minimum  internal-yield  pressure  is  12,500  psi  (1.25  ×
10,000). Because the partial pressure of H2S is 0.40 psi (greater than 0.05 psi), a sour service
tubing grade must be used. See NACE MR-01-75.16

The  obvious  choice  in  the  design  is  2⅞-7.90-L80  tubing  with  an  inside  diameter  (ID)  of
2.323 in. (For 2⅞-in. tubing, the lightest weight of 6.5 lbm/ft for J55 and L80 grades do not
have an adequate internal-yield pressure rating.) See Table 3.12. The 2⅞-7.90-L80 tubing has a

Chapter 3—Tubing Selection, Design, and Installation

IV-127

13,440 psi internal-yield pressure value, which is more than adequate. Because of the high gas
pressure, a proprietary connection joint with 100% joint strength and with metal-to-metal seals
should be considered.

Investigate tension load conditions. Use Eq. 3.4 to calculate Fa = Lp × wn= 14,000 ft × 7.9
lbm/ft = 110,600 lbf. Use Eq. 3.7 to find the hydrostatic pressure at depth, pbh = 13,000 × 14
× 0.052 = 9,464 psi. Use Eq. 3.8 to calculate the buoyancy effect in 14 ppg fluid, Fb = Am ×
pbh = 2.254 in.2 × 9,464 psi = 21,332 lbf. Use Eq. 3.5 to calculate Ff = Fa – Fb = 110,600 lbf
– 21,332 lbf = 89,269 lbf. With Fj=180,300 lbf, use Eqs. 3.9 and 3.10 to calculate Dt = Fj/Fa =
180,300/110,600 = 1.63, which is an acceptable design factor in tension in air, and Dt = Fj /Ff
= 180,300/89,269 = 2.02, which is an acceptable design factor in tension considering buoyancy.

Consider pulling conditions. Buoyancy is neglected because the packer is set.

Ft = Fa + Fo p + Fd

= 110,600 + 25,000 + 5,000

= 140,600 lbf . ........................................................... (3.18)

This  is  the  required  hook  load  to  unset  the  packer.  Use  Eq.  3.12  to  calculate  Df  =  Fj/Ps  =
180,300/140,600 = 1.28, which is an acceptable design factor in tension.

Check  collapse  conditions.  pcr  =  13,890  psi  for  2⅞-7.9-L80  tubing  (see  Table  3.12).  As-
sume  the  casing  annulus  is  filled  with  14  ppg  fluid  with  no  surface  pressure  and  the  tubing
pressure is bled off after a plug was set in the bottom of the tubing or a tubing safety valve at
bottom  is  closed,  which  is  a  reasonable  possibility  over  the  life  of  the  well.  Use  Eq.  3.7  to
calculate  pbh  =  DtV  ×  gf  =  13,000  ft  ×  (14.0  ×  0.052)  psi/ft  =  9,464  psi,  and  use  Eq.  3.15  to
calculate  Df  =  pcr  /  pbh  =  13,890/9,464  =  1.47,  which  is  an  acceptable  value.  Ensure  that  the
surface annulus pressure is kept less than 3,163 psi [(13,890/1.1) – 9,464] in the event that the
tubing pressure is bled off.

Select  and  order  the  tubing  material.  Request  that  the  tubing  meet  API  Spec.  5CT.  Order
14,500 ft of 2⅞-7.90-L80 Type 13 Cr, Range 2, seamless tubing with a proprietary connection
and  one  set  of  pup  joints  with  same  type  connections  as  tubing.  In  addition,  order  all  acces-
sories with the same connection and an appropriate thread lubricant. State the required delivery
and follow API RP 5C1 on tubing handling.

Example 3.3  Design tubing for a relatively deep sweet-oil well. Make a dual grade tubing-
string design (to reduce cost). Assume the following conditions: casing designation = 7-26.00-
N80; Dm = 11,000 ft; DtV = 11,000 ft; desired flow rate under gas lift conditions = 1,500 B/D
from  10,000  ft;  pww  =  5,000  psi;  pwh  =  5,000  psi;  pbh  =  6,200  psi;  Tbh  =  200°F;  Tsf  =  125°F;
completion fluid in annulus, wf, = 11.0 ppg of inhibited solids free salt water; fluid gradient, gf,
= 0.052× wf = 0.572 psi/ft; packer shear pins setting = overpull (Fop) = 50,000 lbf. The well is
relatively straight with small drag forces while pulling, and it is to be circulated with salt water
before pulling tubing. Assume Fd = 0.

Solution. Select tubing size. Because of the anticipated flow rate, 3½-in. tubing was select-
ed.  There  is  no  clearance  problem  with  3½-in.  tubing  inside  the  7-in.  casing.  Smaller  tubing
sizes would result in high friction losses and loss in production rate. Larger tubing sizes would
not increase production rates sufficiently and would result in clearance problems inside the 7-
in.  casing.  EUE  tubing  with  modified  couplings  (see  API  SR13  seal  ring)  are  selected  to
provide adequate leak resistance.

Select  tubing  weight  and  grade.  3½-9.30-J55  tubing  is  checked  to  determine  if  all  design

conditions are met.

IV-128

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Check collapse on bottom. pcr = 7,400 psi (see Table 3.12) for the selected tubing. Assume
worst/maximum  collapse  design  condition  occurs  at  bottom  where  annulus  is  full  of  11  ppg
fluid  and  tubing  pressure  is  zero  (possible  under  completion  conditions  if  well  is  swabbed
down.) Use Eq. 3.7 to calculate pbh = DtV × gf = 11,000 ft × 0.572 = 6,292, and use Eq. 3.15
to calculate Dc = pcr / pbh = 7,400/6,292 = 1.176, which is adequate because 1.1 is acceptable.
Check  burst  at  bottom.  Assume  casing  annulus  is  empty  and  tubing  is  full  of  produced
water.  This  is  possible  under  gas  lift  conditions  if  the  annulus  injection  pressure  is  bled  off
with tubing full of produced fluid plus surface wellhead pressure. Use Eq. 3.16 to calculate the
burst pressure on bottom, 11,000 × 0.465 + 100 = 5,115 + 100 = 5,215 psi. With an internal-
yield  pressure  for  3½-9.30-J55  of  6,980  psi,  use  Eq.  3.17  to  calculate  6,980/5,215  =  1.34,
which  is  adequate  because  1.25  is  acceptable.  With  a  maximum  stimulation  burst  pressure  at
surface of 5,000 psi, use Eq. 3.14 to calculate Db = 6,980/5,000 = 1.396, which is adequate for
burst.

Check  tension  loads  at  surface.  For  3½-9.30-J55  or  N80  tubing,  use  Eq.  3.4  to  calculate
11,000 ft × 9.3 lb/ft = 102,300 lbf. Use Eqs. 3.7 and 3.8 to calculate the axial buoyancy load,
Fb = 2.590 in.2 × (11,000 × 11.0 × 0.052) psi = 16,296 lbf. Use Eq. 3.5 to calculate the weight
in  11  ppg  fluid,  102,300  –  16,296  =  86,004  lbf.  For  3½-9.30-J55  EUE  tubing  (100%  joint
efficiency), Fj = 142,500 lbf. Use Eq. 3.9 to calculate the design factor in tension, Dt, for 3½-9.30-
J55 EUE tubing in air, 142,500/102,300 = 1.39, which does not account for necessary overpull.
The  recommended  design  factor  for  weight  in  air  is  1.6;  therefore,  the  design  factor  is  not
adequate. A higher grade at top must be used for adequate tension design conditions.

Check worst possible tension design case. Pull at surface to overcome drag and shear pins
in  packer  with  no  buoyancy  effect  on  tubing  above  packer.  Use  Eq.  3.4  to  calculate  Fa,  and
use Eq. 3.18 to calculate Ft = 11,000 × 9.3 + 50,000 + 0 = 102,300 + 50,000 = 152,300 lbf. Use

Fa × Dt = Fjr.............................................................. (3.19)

to calculate 152,300 × 1.25 = 190,375 lbf. Use Table 3.12 to find Fj = 207,200 lbf for 3½-9.30-
N80 tubing, which is acceptable. Suggest the use of as much J55 as feasible to reduce tubing
string  cost.  For  maximum  pull  load  on  3½-9.3-J55,  applying  the  acceptable  design  factor  =
142,500/1.25 = 114,000 lbf. Calculate the maximum feet of 3½-9.30-J55 from

L p = (Fa – Fo p) / wn

= (114,000 – 50,000) / 9.3 = 6,882 ft . ......................................... (3.20)

Assume  Lp  =  6,800  ft  for  3½-9.30-J55,  and  Lp  =  11,000  –  6,800  =  4,200  ft  for  3½-9.30-
N80  tubing.  Use  Eq.  3.12  to  calculate  the  design  factor  in  tension,  Dt,  for  3½-9.30-N80,
207,200/152,300 = 1.36, which is acceptable. For Fa = 152,300 lbf, the design factor for 3½-9.30-
J55 can be calculated as 142,500/(152,300 – 4,200 × 9.3) = 1.26. Do not exceed the 50,000-lbf
overpull load, because this would over load the top of the J55 tubing.

Select and order tubing material. Request that tubing meet API Spec. 5CT. Order 4,400 ft
of 3½-9.30-N80 with EUE modified API SR13 beveled couplings and S or EW, range 2; one
set  of  pup  joints  for  3½-9.30-N80  EUE  modified  API  SR  13  standard  couplings;  7,000  ft  of
3½-9.30-J55 with EUE modified API SR 13 standard couplings and S or EW, range 2; and one
container  of  API  modified  thread  compound  as  per  API  RP  5A3.  Specify  delivery  date  and
shipping instructions. Some operators might prefer to use L80 rather than N80 3½ tubing and
to  heat-treat  the  J55  after  upsetting.  Both  these  options  increase  the  cost  of  the  tubing  string
but may increase the operating life.

Fig. 3.3—Gas well inflow and outflow for Example 3.4.

Example 3.4  Design  tubing  for  a  deep  high-pressure  gas  well.  Complete  the  well  with
7-29.00-P110  casing  to  13,900  ft  and  a  5-in.  liner  (4.031  in.  ID)  from  13,800  to  16,650  ft.
Perforations  are  to  be  from  16,530  to  16,570  ft  with  a  permanent  packer  at  16,500  ft.  The
bottomhole pressure is estimated to be 14,850 psi with a bottomhole temperature of 340°F and
a surface-flowing temperature of 150°F. The well has a surface shut-in pressure of 12,445 psi
with  a  gas  gradient,  gg,  of  0.146  psi/ft.  The  well  initially  will  produce  approximately  10
MMcf/D  of  gas  with  a  10  BC/MMcf  and  10  BW/MMcf  into  a  1,000-psia  sales  system.  The
gas gravity is 0.7 and contains 1% of nitrogen and 1% carbon dioxide, but the H2S is only 1
ppm. The formation may require acid stimulation with a maximum surface-treating pressure of
10,000 psi. Before perforating, the 17.4 ppg mud will be circulated out and replaced with 10
ppg clean inhibited salt water. After perforating, the well will be killed, the packer and tubing
installed, and the annulus filled with 10 ppg clean inhibited salt water. If needed, batch inhibi-
tion is planned to protect the tubing from erosion/corrosion.

Solution. Select tubing sizes. The type of completion and the size of the tubing string must
be selected before making the tubing design. Fig 3.3 shows an inflow performance and outflow
performance  graph  comparing  the  production  with  2⅜-,  2⅞-,  and  3½-in.  tubing  strings.  This
graph shows that a full string of 2⅜-in. tubing would restrict production significantly; thus, the
amount of 2⅜-in. tubing should be limited. The 2⅞-in. tubing produces the well near its maxi-
mum rate, whereas the use of 3½-in. tubing results in only a small production rate increase and
will cost substantially more. The 5-in. liner (4.031 in. ID) will make washover and fishing 2⅞-
in. tubing difficult; therefore, 2⅜-in. tubing will be used in the liner section of the well. Thus,
the top portion of the tubing string will be 2⅞-in. tubing and the lower portion inside the liner
will be 2⅜-in. tubing.

Now that the approximate sizes of tubing have been determined, the tubing design can be
made for tension, collapse, and burst conditions. In general, select the lowest weight per foot
and grade that is acceptable. This will normally result in the most economical design.

Select  weights  and  grades.  The  most  common  approach  in  casing  and  tubing  design  is  to
start at the bottom and work your way back to the surface; however, in this high-pressure well,
burst is a major consideration. Draw a pressure-depth graph as shown in Fig. 3.4.

To  control  the  shut-in  surface  tubing  pressure  of  12,445  psi  with  a  design  factor  of  1.25,
calculate the suggested minimum internal-yield pressure rating required, pyi = 12,445 × 1.25 or
15,556  psi.  As  Table  3.12  shows,  2⅞-7.90-P110  is  suitable,  which  has  an  internal  yield  of

18,480  psi.  API  grades  C90  and  T95  could  also  be  used,  but  these  grades  are  usually  more
costly  than  P110.  Because  the  H2S  partial  pressure  is  less  than  0.05  psi,  the  nonsour  service
grade N80 and P110 can be used.

Because tension reduces the collapse rating and collapse reduces the tension rating, start at
the bottom where tension is small and collapse is normally high. Actually, at the bottom (be-
cause of buoyancy forces), the tubing is in compression when run in fluid. Draw a schematic
tubing depth chart as shown in Fig. 3.5.

Check collapse and tension stresses. Start at the bottom of the hole and work to the surface-
checking tension and collapse at any size, weight, or grade change. The tensile load increases
moving upward, but the collapse differential pressure decreases.

To calculate the collapse differential, use

Δpc = ga × DtV – gt × DtV . ................................................. (3.21)

With the annulus full of 10 ppg salt water and assuming that the tubing pressure bled to zero,
a 0.52 × 16,500 = 8,580 psi collapse differential would result on the bottom of the hole. The
2⅜-4.70-N80  tubing  has  a  collapse  of  11,780  psi,  resulting  in  a  design  factor  11,780/8,580  =
1.37, which is acceptable. Keep the annulus pressure at the surface to a maximum of 1,500 psi

in normal operations to avoid possible collapse if the tubing pressure at bottom is bled down to
zero.

From above the top of the liner at 13,800 ft to the permanent packer at 16,500 ft, 2,700 ft
of 2⅜-4.70-N80 tubing is tentatively selected. Use 2,800 ft of 2⅜-in. tubing to avoid interfer-
ence with the liner top. At 13,700 ft, the tubing size can be increased safely to 2⅞ in., which
will allow a higher flow rate. To simplify wireline operations, the tubing weight for all 2⅞-in.
tubing is the same.

For  burst  considerations,  the  design  requires  a  minimum  of  7.9  lbm/ft  tubing.  There  is  a
–11,188  buoyancy  force  because  of  the  fluid  acting  on  the  bottom  tubing  area.  At  13,700  ft,
the 2⅜-in. tubing will have a load of 4.7 lbm/ft × 2,800 ft = 13,160 lbf; however, the tensile
load on the tubing is altered slightly because of the tubing area change at 13,700 ft. This re-
sults in an axial load at 13,700 ft of 13,160 – 11,188 + 7,929 – 14,690 = –4,789 lbf; thus, the
effect of tension on collapse can be neglected because the tubing is in compression.

The maximum burst pressure on bottom may occur during stimulation. Calculate the burst

differential from

Δpb = pwh + gt × Dtv – ga × Dtv . ............................................ (3.22)

Assuming a surface-treating pressure of 10,000 psi, the tubing full of acid (gradient = 0.45 psi/
ft), and the annulus full of 10 ppg (gradient = 0.52 psi/ft) salt water, use Eq. 3.22 to calculate
a burst differential on bottom of 10,000 + 0.45 × 16,500 – 0.52 × 16,500 = 8,845 psi. The use
of  a  design  factor  of  1.25  in  burst  will  require  an  internal-yield  pressure  of  8,845  ×  1.25  =
11,056 psi. The 2⅜-4.70-N80 tubing has an API internal yield of 11,200 psi (see Table 3.12),
which is acceptable.

Burst  and  collapse  conditions  now  need  to  be  checked  at  all  depths  where  tubing  size,
weight,  or  grade  changes  are  planned.  Burst  is  of  primary  importance.  Check  burst  at  the
changed  over  from  2⅜  in.  to  2⅞  in.  at  13,700  ft.  Use  Eq.  3.22  to  calculate  the  tubing  burst
pressure  differential  during  stimulation:  10,000  psi  +  0.45  psi/ft  ×  13,700  ft  –  0.52  psi/ft  ×
13,700  ft  =  9,041  psi.  The  use  of  a  design  factor in  burst,  Db,  0f  1.25  would  require a  burst
resistance rating of 9,041 psi × 1.25 = 11,301 psi. Thus, at this depth, the 2⅜, 4.7, N80 tubing
is  acceptable  and  2⅞,  7.9,  N80  tubing  is  acceptable  because  it  has  an  API  internal  pressure

IV-132

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

rating of 13,440 psi (see Table 3.12.) and a collapse resistance of 13,890 psi. Using a design
factor in burst, Db, of 1.25, the maximum burst differential for 2⅞, 7.9, N80 should not exceed
13,440/1.25 = 10,752 psi.

At  the  surface  during  stimulation,  2⅞-in.,  7.9,  P110  is  required  as  shown  previously.  The
depth of the crossover from P110 to N80 needs to be calculated. This depth is where the burst
pressure differential is equal to 10,752 psi for 2⅞-in., 7.9, N80 tubing. The worst case condi-
tion is during shut-in when a surface pressure of 12,445 psi occurs and the tubing is full of 0.146-
psi/ft gas.

where ga is the annulus fluid gradient and gt is the tubing fluid gradient.

Using Eq. 3.23, Lp = (12,445 psi – 13,440/1.25 psi)/(0.52 psi/ft – 0.146 psi/ft) = 4,527 ft.
Thus, 2⅞-in., 7.9, P110 tubing is to be used from the surface to 4,527 ft and 2⅞-in., 7.9, N80
tubing  is  to  be  used  from  4,527  to  13,700  ft.  Table  3.13  summarizes  the  sizes,  weights  and
grades selected.

Calculate the hook load of the tubing string in air and in fluid for the various tubing sizes,

weights, and grades.

Hook load in air = 13,700 ft × 7.9 lbm/ft + 2,800 ft × 4.7 lbm/ft = 121,390 lbf.
Hook load in fluid = 121,390 + 7,929 – 14690 – 11,188 = 103,441 lbf.
Body/joint yield strength for 2⅞, 7.9, P110 = 247,900 lbf.
Body/joint yield strength for 2⅞, 7.9, N80 = 180,300 lbf.
Body/joint yield strength for 2⅜, 4.7, N80 = 104,300 lbf.
Maximum allowed hook load at surface for 2⅞, 7.9, P110 tubing = 247,900/1.25 = 198,320

lbf.

180,300/1.25=180,003 lbf.

104,300/1.25= 191,670 lbf.

Maximum  allowed  hook  load  at  surface  for  2⅞,  7.9,  N80  tubing  =  4,527  ×  7.9  +

Maximum  allowed  hook  load  at  surface  for  2⅜,  4.7,  N80  tubing  =  13,700  ×  7.9  +

Thus, the limiting condition is for pulling on the 2⅞, 7.9, N80 tubing, which allows a hook
load at the surface of 180,003 lbf. For this string design, an overpull over the weight in fluid
would be 180,003 lbf – 103,441 lbf = 76,562 lbf.

Select and order tubing material. Order the tubing to API 5CT specifications, adding a few
hundred  feet  of  each  type:  seamless,  range  2,  and  a  proprietary  connection  integral  joint  or
threaded and coupled with metal-to-metal seals. Also, order a set of grade P110 pup joints for
the  2⅞-in.  tubing  with  the  same  proprietary  connection  integral  joint.  Order  an  appropriate

thread  compound.  In  addition,  one  special  crossover  2⅞-7.90  to  2⅜-4.70  in  grade  N80  is  re-
quired. (If an MTC connection is used, the crossover can be a pin × pin with a 2⅞-N80 coupling.)
All  auxiliary  well  equipment  should  have  the  same  proprietary  connection.  Tubing  should
be  hydrostatically  tested  to  80%  of  yield  pressure.  Ensure  that  proper  running  procedures  are
used.

Check  with  the  manufacturer  on  ways  to  distinguish  between  the  two  grades  of  2.875-in.
OD tubing. Some operators would select 2⅞-7.90-P110 and no 2⅞-7.90-N80 tubing to ensure
that accidental mixing of the 2.875-in. OD different grade tubing could not occur and to allow
a slightly higher overpull value.

If pressures are greater than 7,000 psi and the depth is greater than 13,000 ft, a pipe-body
load analysis should be performed. In sour service for L80, C90, and T95, triaxial stress inten-
sity should be checked and a design factor greater than 1.25 maintained. See ISO 13679 Sec. B.

3.4.5 Stretch in Tubing.  When tubing is subject to an axial load, either in tension or compres-
sion,  that  does  not  exceed  the  elastic  limit  of  the  material,  the  stretch  or  contraction  may  be
determined from

ΔLt =

where  ΔLt=  total  axial  stretch  or  contraction,  in.;  F  =  superimposed  tension  or  compression
axial load, lbf; Lp = length of pipe, ft; E = Young’s modulus of elasticity for steel = 30 million
psi,  which  is  not  affected significantly by  tubing  grade; and  Am  =  cross-section  metal area  of
pipe, in.2 = 0.7854 × (do

For  multiple  sizes  or  weights,  calculate  stretch  for  each  section  and  sum  the  results.  This
formula also can be used to determine the length of free pipe by applying a load, F, and mea-

3.4.6 Tubing Buckling.  Tubing  buckling  must  be  considered  in  design.  See  the  chapter  on
completion design in this section of the Handbook.

3.4.7 Corrosion Considerations.  Tubing selection for corrosive environments is a critical de-
sign  responsibility.  Both  the  inside  and  outside  of  the  tubing  can  be  damaged  by  corrosion.
Weight-loss corrosion may be a serious problem with conventional tubing strings in wells pro-

IV-134

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

ducing salt water, especially when the water becomes the wetting phase. Acidity caused by the
presence of acid gases (CO2 and H2S) normally increases the corrosion rate. When corrosion is
minor,  the  common  practice  is  to  use  standard  API  grades  and  to  start  batch  inhibition  when
corrosion becomes a problem.

Corrosion/erosion, a major problem with steel tubing, occurs in most high-rate gas-conden-
sate wells in which the gas contains CO2. The CO2 attacks the steel tubing, which creates an
iron carbonate film (corrosion product); it is removed from the wall by erosion (impingement
of well fluids). Rapid deep pit failure may occur from corrosion/erosion. Increasing fluid veloc-
ities and CO2 partial pressure are highly detrimental, as are increasing temperature or increas-
ing  brine  production.  There  may  be  a  region  of  conditions  in  which  frequent  batch  or
continuous inhibition is necessary. Gas wells with CO2 contents higher than 30 psi partial pres-
sure  and  gas  velocities  greater  than  40  fps  normally  require  continuous  or  frequent  batch
inhibition  to  protect  the  steel  tubing.  CRA  material  is  often  the  most  cost-effective  means  of
combatting erosion/corrosion. Some CRA material is subject to failure in brine water environ-
ments.

A different type of tubing design problem is SSC. SSC and/or hydrogen embrittlement caus-
es  a  brittle-type  failure  in  susceptible  materials  at  stresses  less  than  the  tubing  yield  strength.
SSC  is  a  cracking  phenomenon  encountered  with  high-strength  steels  in  sour  (H2S)  aqueous
environment. Cracking also occurs in austenitic stainless steels in caustic or chloride solutions
and mild steel in caustic or nitrate solutions. Susceptibility to attack of most low-alloy steels is
roughly  proportional  to  its  strength.  In  terms  of  hardness,  most  steels  are  not  subject  to  SSC
failure  if  the  hardness  is  less  than  241  Brinell  Hardness  number  or  23  Hardness-Rockwell  C.
The potential harmful level of H2S for susceptible materials has been defined as 0.05 psi par-
tial  pressure  of  the  H2S  gas  phase.  Carbonate-induced  cracking  of  mild  steel  can  occur  in
freshwater environments.

Use of inhibition to prevent SSC is not completely reliable because 100% effective cover-
age of metal surface generally is not achieved. The best solution for tubulars subject to SSC is
to use materials that are not subject to SSC failures. In general, follow NACE guidelines.16

Dissimilar metals close to each other can influence corrosion. Because corrosion can result
from many causes and influences and can take different forms, no simple or universal remedy
exists for its control. Each tubing well problem must be treated individually, and the solution
must be attempted in light of known factors and operating conditions.

3.4.8 Internal Coatings.  Plastic internal coating of a tubing string is sometimes used to deter
corrosion  or  erosion/corrosion  in  oil  and  gas  wells  and  may  increase  tubing  life  significantly.
Such  cases  may  be  in  high-water-cut  oil  wells  or  gas  wells  with  high  CO2  partial  pressures.
These coatings are usually thin wall film applications (< 0.01 in. thick) that are baked (bonded)
onto the inside walls of the tubing string. The film thickness is small enough to allow normal
wireline operations. The key to plastic coatings is selecting the correct material and its proper
application.  Even  if  the  specifications  call  for  “100%  holiday  free,”  eventually  the  coating
comes off and holidays occur because of poor application or handling practices, wireline work,
caliper  surveys,  blisters  caused  by  the  environment,  or  other  reasons.  Coating  should  not  be
expected to stop all weight-loss corrosion over the life of the well. Typically, a few holes may
develop in time but the bulk of the tubing stays intact. In such cases, workover costs are usual-
ly lowered because the tubing often can be retrieved without major fishing operations. Because
such  coatings  increase  the  smoothness,  they  reduce  pressure  drop  slightly  in  high-rate  wells
and, in some cases, may be helpful in reducing paraffin and scale problems. Besides thin wall
film  coatings,  there  are  other  kinds  of  interior  coating  or  liners  for  tubing  that  have  special
application. Plastic liners and cement lining have been used successfully when the reduction in

ID is not a major problem, primarily for water and carbon dioxide injection tubing or for sour
service production.

3.5 Tubing Inspection
API tubing is inspected at the mill in accordance with API Spec. 5CT. Physical properties are
checked  and  each  length  hydrostatically  tested,  normally  to  only  3,000  psi  in  the  plain  end
(unthreaded) condition. Dimensions, weights, straightness, and lengths are also checked. Part of
this  inspection  is  to  drift  all  lengths.  Table  3.14  summarizes  API  Spec.  5CT,  which  specifies
pipe body inspection requirements.

Despite all the API specifications and testing, some tubing defects are still found after deliv-
ery;  thus,  some  operators  do  further  inspection  of  new  tubing  on  critical  wells.  Used  tubing
frequently requires inspection. See API RP 5C1.5

There are several types of tubing inspection methods that may be beneficial. The common
methods of inspecting the tubing currently in use in field operation are visual, calipers, hydro-
static, electromagnetic, magnetic particle, and ultrasonic. Typical defects are outside and inside
pits and longitudinal cuts, transverse laps, and mechanical wear and erosion. API recommends
that wall thickness measurements be made with pipe wall micrometers, sonic pulse-echo instru-
ments, or gamma ray devices so that the operator can demonstrate the wall thickness within a
2%  accuracy.  In  addition  to  the  body,  the  tubing  upset  and  threads  often  require  inspection,
typically by magnetic powder and use of thread gauges. The following guidelines are suggested
for inspection normally at the well location:

• Visual. The outside of each tubing joint should be inspected visually for mill defects such
as  seams,  slugs,  pits,  cuts,  gouges,  dents,  or  cracks.  Each  connection  should  be  checked  for
defective  threads  and  seals.  Wall  thickness  measurements  should  be  considered  on  critical
wells.  Internal  inspection  of  tubing  requires  the  use  of  an  optical  device  and  an  experienced
operator.  The  operating  crews,  a  manufacturer’s  representative,  the  user’s  personnel,  or  a  ser-
vice contractor typically does such visual inspections.

• Calipers. Tubing calipers, both multifingered feeler and electronic types, normally are run
while the tubing is installed in the well. Where significant wall loss is observed, the tubing can
be pulled and the damaged joints replaced.

• Hydrostatic.  A  commonly  used  inspection  method  is  to  test  hydrostatically  the  tubing
body and joint internally with water. Test pressures are usually based on 80% of internal yield.

IV-136

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Hydrostatic tests of the body are performed on the pipe rack on location and the joints checked
while running; however, both can be tested while running. A more stringent test of the joints is
obtained by the use of nitrogen with a helium tracer rather than water.

• Electromagnetic. To find pits, transverse and/or longitudinal defects in the pipe body, elec-
tromagnetic search coils, which find magnetic flux leakage, are typically used. This technique
works for a uniform body and will typically not find defects in the upset and/or threaded area
of the tube. The inspection equipment must be in good working order and an experienced and
qualified  operator  is  required.  Eddy-Current,  another  electromagnetic  inspection  method,  is
used for grade verification.

• Magnetic  Particle.  The  magnetic  particle  inspection  methods,  both  wet  and  dry,  induce
either a longitudinal or transverse magnetic field in the tubing and magnetic iron particles dust-
ed on the tubing align at defects. This method is normally used to check the outside surface of
upset and end area region for cracks. This method requires a qualified operator, excellent oper-
ating environmental conditions, and good operating procedures to be reliable.

• Ultrasonic.  Ultrasonic  (high  frequency  sound)  is  used  to  find  flaws  and  imperfections  in
the pipe body wall. The tool is usually stationary and the pipe is rotated and fed mechanically
to examine the entire tubing body. The ultrasonic testing equipment must be in good working
condition and an experienced and qualified operator is mandatory.

• Hardness Testing. The hardness of tubing is often checked when it is to be used in sour

service to ensure the tubing meets API Spec. 5CT or to sort mixed grades of tubing.

3.5.1 Inspecting Used Tubing.  Used tubing should be classified according to loss of nominal
wall  thickness.  Table  3.15  shows  the  API  color-coding  suggestions.  The  color  coding  should
consist of a paint band of the appropriate color approximately 2 in. wide around the body of
the  pipe  approximately  1  ft  from  the  box  end.  There  is  no  standard  method  for  calculating
performance  properties  of  used  tubing.  Tubing  reconditioning  should  be  done  only  in  accor-
dance with API specifications.

3.6 Tubing Handling
Tubing can be damaged during shipment, at the wellsite, and during running and pulling. API
RP 5C15 Secs. 2 and 3 should be followed closely. For transportation, slightly different proce-
dures  are  needed  to  prevent  damage  depending  on  whether  shipped  by  water,  rail,  or  truck.
Care must be taken in unloading and storage. Thread protectors must be installed properly and
rough handling avoided. Tubing should be stacked on racks following proper procedures, and
tubing in storage should be inspected periodically and protected from corrosion. In general, the
high-strength materials are more susceptible to handling damage.

Chapter 3—Tubing Selection, Design, and Installation

IV-137

Numerous factors must be considered when running and pulling tubing. The operating per-
sonnel  should  ensure  that  good  practices  are  followed.  Each  length  of  tubing  should  be
measured and drifted in compliance with API/ISO specifications. The tubing should be handled
with  thread  protectors,  which  are  not  removed,  until  the  tubing  is  ready  to  stab.  Adequate
thread cleaning is essential for proper connection makeup and pressure-tight strings. (See Ref.
16.) Apply a good thread compound but avoid excessive amounts. Collar-type tubing elevators
are  adequate  for  API  nonbeveled  couplings;  however,  slip-type  elevators  are  recommended
when running tubing with beveled couplings, special clearance couplings, and integral joint tub-
ing. Check spider slips to ensure they will not damage the tubing body.

Use of power tongs is necessary to obtain consistent makeup torque. Properly maintained,
installed,  and  calibrated  tongs  are  essential.  Follow  the  API  recommended  tubing  makeup
torque  in  Table  3.16  for  nonupset,  external-upset,  and  integral-joint  tubing.  Follow  the
manufacturer’s  recommendations  for  specialty  joints.  However,  the  makeup  torque  may  vary
depending on the thread coatings and lubricant type; thus, adjustments in makeup torque values
are sometimes required. Torque values listed in Table 3.16 apply to tubing with zinc-plated or
phosphate-coated  couplings.  For  tin-plated  couplings,  use  80%  of  the  listed  values  as  a  guide
for  proper  makeup.  To  establish  the  correct  torque  for  API  tubing  threads,  make  up  the  first
few joints to the recommended values and examine the connection. There should be no exces-
sive heat, approximately two turns beyond the hand-tight position with all threads buried. Back
out the connection (noting torque) and check threads for galling. If needed, adjust torque and
repeat. Use the established makeup torque for the remainder of the string. To obtain maximum
leak resistance with the API-tapered thread, the pin end of the connection is made up to slight-
ly  beyond  the  point  of  yielding.  Consequently,  API  EUE  connections  may  make  up  slightly
more on repeated operations. The problem of makeup is to use torque that is sufficient to pro-
vide the needed seal without permanently damaging the connection. Good experience has been
reported  with  the  torque-turn  method  with  API  EUE  tubing.  In  the  torque-turn  method,  the
power tongs are calibrated to record both the number of turns and the torque to make up the
API  tubing  coupling  to  the  point  of  yielding.  In  many  of  the  proprietary  connections,  there
must  be  ample  makeup  torque  so  that  the  metal-to-metal  seals  are  energized.  Check  with  the
manufacturer for makeup guidelines.

3.6.1 Thread Compound.  API-modified  thread  compound  generally  has  been  accepted  for  a
wide  range  of  service  conditions  over  many  years.  The  placement  of  thread  compound  at  the
root of the rounded API threads with the bearing pressure on the thread flanks (the interference
fit, power tight makeup) produces the sealing mechanism. The thread compound also provides
the  lubrication  to  deter  galling.  The  compound  is  a  mixture  of  metallic  and  graphite  powders
uniformly  dispersed  in  a  grease  base.  API  RP  5A31  and  ISO  1367817  provide  the  means  for
evaluating  the  suitability  of  thread  compounds  for  use  on  API  round  threads  in  high-pressure
service.  For  specialty  connections,  consult  with  the  manufacturer  on  the  proper  thread  com-
pound. Environmentally nondamaging thread compounds meeting API thread-compound perfor-
mance requirements are available.

3.6.2 Evaluation Procedures for Tubing Connections.  Evaluation procedures for casing and
tubing  connections  tests  to  be  performed  to  determine  the  galling  tendency,  sealing  perfor-
mance,  and  structural  integrity  of  tubular  connections,  especially  for  high-pressure  application
are  under  study.  See  ISO/DIS  13679.15  Table  3.17  shows  example  relationships  between  test
classes  and  service  applications.  Other  relationships  may  be  more  appropriate  for  individual
users. Class IV connections are intended for the most severe application, and Class I connec-
tions are intended for the least severe application.

3.7 Coiled Tubing
Coiled tubing is defined as an electric-welded pipe with one longitudinal seam formed by high-
frequency  induction  welding  without  the  addition  of  filler  material.  Coiled  tubing  is  used  in
special  workover  cases  and  as  the  completion  tubing.  A  common  use  of  coiled  tubing  is  as
vent  strings,  especially  in  low-rate  gas  wells.  In  general,  the  guidelines  for  jointed  tubing
should be followed for coiled tubing. The primary difference between coiled tubing and jointed
tubing  is  that  coiled  tubing  bends  because  it  has  no  jointed  connections  (there  may  be  a  few
butt welds). Coiled tubing is typically thin-wall tubing, which permits spooling and is slightly
oval in shape. Coiled tubing has a tendency to coil up during running operations, especially in
relatively large casing in deviated holes. As with all tubing operations, coiled tubing’s effective-
ness depends on good job planning and equipment design along with proper handling, mainte-
nance, and storage procedures. See API RP 5C7.9

Coiled  tubing  is  currently  available  in  ¾-  to  3½-in.  OD  sizes.  The  API  document  covers
materials that are high-strength, low-alloy steels with specified minimum yield strengths from

the  resistance  to  flow  of  electric  current,  and  the  edge  is  mechanically  pressed  together.  The
length of the flat strip material typically ranges from 1,000 to 3,000 ft, and a spool of coiled
tubing may be in excess of 25,000 ft, depending mostly on the tubing diameter.

Tapered strings of coiled tubing can be manufactured by changing the wall thickness of the
tubing  within  the  length  of  a  spool  while  maintaining  a  constant  OD.  These  tapered  designs
can be manufactured with different weights (same OD but different ID segments) welded togeth-
er  or  tapered  sections  that  have  a  linear  change  in  thickness  over  the  section.  Tapered  coiled
tubing  can  increase  the  operating  depths  and  pressures.  The  manufacturer  should  provide  me-
chanical properties of coiled tubing for each spool of coiled tubing.

The chemical requirements for API coiled tubing should conform to those listed in API RP
5C7 Table 3.9 Table 3.18 shows tensile and harness requirements for coiled tubing. Table 3.19
shows the sizes, grades, and ratings.

3.7.1 Coiled Tubing Design Considerations.   When  used  as  the  permanent  well  completion
tubing, coiled tubing should be designed for the tension, burst, or collapse stresses that typical-
ly occur during well operation. With small sizes (< 2⅜ in.) and relatively thin wall thickness,

the  overpull  allowed  will  be  low,  which  may  be  a  limiting  condition  if  the  tubing  becomes
stuck or when a packer is used. Collapse pressures will be lowered if the tubing is oval. Care
must be taken when tensile loads and collapse pressures are high. Burst rating may need to be
reduced for the tubing after several cycles of spooling. Consult with the manufacturers and API
RP 5C7.9 With tapered strings, the design is fixed during the manufacturing to meet the well
conditions and, once manufactured, the coiled-tubing design cannot be changed. All coiled tub-
ing is subject to weight-loss corrosion, and plans should be made for corrosion inhibition. If thin-
wall  coiled  tubing  is  used,  pitting  may  result  in  an  early  failure  of  the  tube.  Because  of
spooling, which results in exceeding the body-yield strength and changing the steel properties,
coiled tubing is not recommended in sour service.

Perforating
George E. King, BP plc

4.1 Flow Path
Perforating is a process used to establish a flow path between the near reservoir and the well-
bore.  It  normally  involves  initiating  a  hole  from  the  wellbore  through  the  casing  and  any
cement sheath into the producing zone. The effectiveness of this process depends on the care
and design of the perforating procedure. Because a high percentage of current wells use a cased-
hole completion, the importance of the design and application of the perforating process cannot
be overstated.

Perforations  are  an  elemental  piece  of  the  inflow  section  of  the  well  and  have  significant
impact  on  the  total  completion  efficiency.  This  chapter  describes  the  methods  of  creating  the
best flow path for a particular completion. It also contains information on completion diagnos-
tics and candidate selection for situations in which reperforating could improve production. The
intent of this chapter is to familiarize the engineer with methods and techniques to improve the
flow path, not all of which involve perforating equipment.

Establishing  an  optimum  flow  path  requires  the  execution  of  a  number  of  critical  steps.
These  critical  operations  are  identified  throughout  the  chapter  and  are  used  in  design,  quality
control inspection, and quality control.

A brief description is needed of the alternative completion methods to cased, cemented, and
perforated completions. Openhole completions offer several options that should not be ignored
in a quest for a high efficiency flow connection to the reservoir. Key to the completion process
is  the  minimization  of  pressure  drop  across  the  completion,  specifically  the  piece  of  the  flow
path from the near reservoir to the wellbore. In many cases, completion requirements extend to
the need to modify the flow connection to reduce gas or water coning, to access multiple lay-
ers,  and  to  assist  in  placing  fractures.  Completion  requirements  also  extend  to  other  aspects
that involve initial completion or recompletion of the producing interval. A careful assessment
of the benefits offered by both openhole completions and cased and perforated completion meth-
ods should be conducted.

4.2 Definitions
Because many of the perforating processes deal with explosive powders and gas expansion meth-
ods, a few definitions of the specialized nomenclature are needed.1

IV-150

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

High explosives are very powerful explosives such as RDX, HMX, PYX, HNS, and others
that find common use in the oil industry. High explosives are characterized by extreme energy
release in a very short time, some with detonation front movement on the order of 6100+ m/s
(20,000+ ft/sec). The detonation of an explosive is a chemical reaction and, like many chemi-
cal  reactions,  certain  variables  control  the  speed  of  the  reaction.  Peak  energy  generation  with
these materials is necessary to perform effectively and can be achieved only if they have high-
order initiation. The initiation process for any explosive is critical in oilfield applications.

Gas  generators  are  explosive  materials  designed  to  generate  energy  at  a  slower  rate  than
the high explosives, and their primary function is to provide quick fluid volume. These materi-
als are used for power fluids (gas drive), fracturing energy, and propulsion energy sources.

Order is a term associated with explosive firing. High order means that the high explosive
has  been  initiated  properly  and  reacts  at  the  maximum  speed.  Low-order  initiation  of  a  high
explosive fails to achieve maximum energy; the explosive may react, but the energy level pro-
duced  is  sharply  lower  than  the  maximum  potential.  In  perforating  charges,  a  low-order
detonation usually means a failure to produce effective perforations, although gas pressure may
rise sharply. Burning is one of the low-order reactions, usually producing gas, with no perfora-
tion  possible.  Low-order  detonations  may  expand  or  burst  guns,  causing  obstructions  and
fishing or recompletion decisions. Care in design and application of the perforating system can
reduce sharply the incidence of low-order firing. Low-order detonations are caused by several
factors, but temperature and poor condition of detonating cord are leading causes.

A primary explosive is an explosive that is used in initiators or other devices to initiate the
explosive  sequence.  Primary  explosives  usually  are  more  sensitive  to  firing  (can  be  initiated
more easily) than secondary explosives. Common locations for these explosives are in detona-
tors (also called blasting caps) and some booster devices.

Secondary  explosives  are  the  main  explosives  used  in  charges.  The  secondary  explosives
(usually  high  explosives)  are  harder  to  initiate  and  must  be  initiated  to  get  proper  response
(i.e., a high-order detonation).

Perforation flow efficiency is a measurement of how close flow capacity in the perforated
hole approaches the flow capacity of an ideal hole of the same diameter and length. There can
be enormous differences in flow rate between a perforated hole and a drilled hole of the same
diameter and length. The perforation flow efficiency is a part of the total well flow efficiency.
Achieving the highest flow efficiency, by perforation characteristic, by cleanup, or by a break-
down operation, is a critical step. Good perforation flow efficiency is greater than 80%.

Pressure differential toward the formation from the wellbore is overbalance. Pressure differ-
ential  from  the  formation  to  the  wellbore  is  underbalance.  Fluid  flows  from  high  pressure
toward  the  low  pressure  in  a  permeable  formation.  Special  cases  of  overbalance  manipulation
include extreme overbalance perforating (EOP).

Phasing is the angle between the charges. The most common phasings are 0°, 180°, 120°,
90°,  and  60°.  Several  specialty  guns,  offering  higher  density  charge  application  and  guns  for
sand control or casing protection, may offer phasings that increase the linear distance between
the charges in a direct line along the gun body.

Shot density is the measurement of the perforations made per unit length of the gun. Nor-
mally given in either shots/ft (SPF) or shots/m (SPM), the ranges of shot density extend from
1 to 27 SPF. The most common shot densities are 4 to 12 SPF (13 to 39 SPM). Shot density
requirements are a function of the completion design and the formation production requirements.
Pressure  drop  is  a  measurement  of  the  hindrances  in  the  flow  system.  Rate  of  fluid  flow
through  a  rock  is  determined  by  the  differential  pressure,  the  permeability  of  the  system,  the
fluid viscosity, and the length and area of the flow path. To maximize flow rate, the permeabil-
ity must be high. Crushed rock, debris, and other obstructions result in lower permeability and
lower flow rate. In a well system, maximum production is achieved by minimizing pressure drop.

4.3 Perforating History
Bullet  guns  were  the  first  commercial  perforating  devices.2  A  hardened  steel  bullet  was  fired
from a short-barrel gun powered by a gas-producing explosive. These guns first saw commer-
cial use in the early 1930s. The wall thickness and hardness of the casing and the hardness of
the formation limit bullet perforating. Bullet guns are still used in some applications, usually in
soft formations for deep penetration or brittle formations in which the shattering produced by
the bullet can help break down the formation around the perforation.

During the 1930s and 1940s, work in the area of shaped charges progressed in the military
arena. The bazooka, with its armor-piercing charges, was one of the first large-scale uses of the
technology pioneered by Henry Mohaupt and others. This technology was accepted by the oil
industry  in  the  late  1940s  and  early  1950s  and  became  the  most  used  perforating  method  by
the mid- to late 1950s.

Alternatives to explosives also were implemented, normally with an abrasive slurry of mate-
rial such as frac sand and a carrier liquid, either sand or water.3,4 Abrasive perforating methods
are slower, require a rig, and contain several wear points in the treating equipment.

Specialty perforators, including laser, hydraulic punches, mechanical punches, water jet, com-
bination  bullet/jet  guns,  and  electric  arc  perforating,  have  been  used.  Most  of  the  specialty
methods are used for special applications and do not find widespread use. Interesting perfora-
tion applications such as underbalanced perforating, tubing-conveyed perforating, and specialty
phasings have their roots in much earlier applications, often 15 to 30 years before they became
popular.

4.4 Perforating Methods

4.4.1 Bullet Gun Perforating.  Projectiles from these guns (bullets) must penetrate the casing,
cement, and formation. Bullet speed exiting the barrel is usually approximately 900 m/s (3000
ft/sec).  Penetration  is  easiest  in  low  alloy,  thinner  walled  pipe  (H-40,  to  K-55,  and  L-80  API
casing  series  pipe  grades).  Penetration  in  higher  strength  casing  alloy  pipe  and  harder  forma-
tions  is  more  difficult  in  most  cases  and  not  feasible  in  others.2  When  successful,  the  bullet
creates a very round entrance hole but may often create a hole with sharp internal burrs. Fig.
4.1 shows a bullet-perforated casing from a surface test.

Tunnel length creation with a bullet gun drops sharply with increasing formation strength.
Penetration  extremes  of  15  in.  –/+  in  soft  chalks  to  2  to  3  in.  in  dolomites  are  common.  In
contrast to shaped-charge perforating, however, bullets often shatter the rock rather than smooth-
ly  push  back  and  compact  the  rock  in  their  path.  The  shattering  can  be  a  definite  advantage
when the cracking improves the permeability next to the perforation.

Bullet  penetration  is  primarily  a  function  of  the  density  and  strength  of  the  target  in  its
path,  as  well  as  gun  performance  factors.  The  energy  from  the  bullet  is  proportional  to  its
mass,  the  amount  of  propellant,  and  the  performance  of  the  seal  between  the  bullet  and  the
barrel. Early performance-measuring tests with bullet guns showed a direct correlation between
the penetration in a target and the use of new gun barrels. Performance dropped sharply with
barrel enlargement and/or wear.

Entrance  hole  roundness  and  the  pronounced  shattering  around  the  perforation  tunnel  help
improve stimulation through bullet-perforated completions. Perforation ball sealers seal quickly
and efficiently on bullet perforations. This is partly because of the additional brittle cracking of
the  formation  (increasing  permeability),  the  ability  of  the  ball  sealer  to  create  a  seal  on  the
perforation, and the reduced number of bullet perforators normally used in a well. The reduced
number of bullet perforators used in a well is an indication that a large number of perforations
spreads out the flow entering the formation, resulting in a lower flow rate into a given perfora-
tion and less tendency to attract and seat a ball sealer.

IV-152

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 4.1—Bullet-perforated casing from a surface test.

Advantages  of  bullet  perforating  are  high  permeability  connection  to  the  immediate  reser-
voir and very controlled hole size and shape. Disadvantages are shallow penetration, ineffective-
ness  in  hard  formations  and  high  alloy  or  heavy  pipe,  leaving  a  solid  mass  of  steel  in  the
perforation tunnel, and low density perforating.

4.4.2 Abrasive Perforating Methods.  Abrasive perforating methods use high-volume flow of
abrasive-laden  fluid  to  erode  through  the  target  pipe  or  cut  it  off  when  the  nozzle  or  tubing
string  is  rotated.3,4  Abrasive  impingement  of  hard  particles  such  as  sand  on  steel  can  cut
through 0.25 to 0.3 in. of casing in a matter of minutes. Perforations in the casing or even 15
× 1.2 cm (6 in. × 0.5 in.) slots can be formed within 10 to 20 minutes per slot (hole). Abrasive
methods  often  use  a  shaped  nozzle  that  focuses  the  stream  on  the  steel  surface.  The  nozzle
helps preserve energy, shorten cutting time, and decrease the effect of clearance distance, but
the  nozzle  wears  with  use.  Clearance  distance  between  the  nozzle  and  the  target  is  important
but not as critical as in nonsolids jet cutting.

Perforation  depths  formed  by  abrasives  are  typically  short  because  the  returning  fluid  and
solids interfere with the ability of high-pressure fluids to access deeper targets. Depths of 2.54
to  23  cm  (1  to  more  than  8  in.)  have  been  measured  in  tests  performed  with  backpressure.
Abrasive  perforating  or  cutting  in  surface  targets  often  produces  quicker  cutting  and  may
achieve  deeper  perforation  depth,  but  these  tests  are  not  a  valid  representation  of  tool  perfor-
mance  in  a  well.  Adding  backpressure  on  any  type  of  a  jetting  tool  rapidly  diminishes  its
performance because of the reduction of pressure and flow velocity across the nozzle and col-
lapse  of  bubbles  and  cavitation  that  may  occur  exiting  the  nozzle  on  a  low-pressure  test.
Required equipment includes a rig with tubing large enough for the required rate with minimal
friction drop. A fixed nozzle for perforating or a rotating nozzle for abrasive cutoff is the main
bottomhole assembly.

Chapter 4—Perforating

IV-153

The type of abrasive varies with the job, but sand is the most common material for perforat-
ing and pipe cutoff. Other abrasives such as calcium carbonate, soda glass, and other mineral
and  synthetic  materials  can  be  used.  There  are  some  differences  in  the  cutting  efficiency  of
materials.  The  quickest  cutters  are  harder,  more  angular  materials.  Bauxite  is  the  single  most
erosive material in the abrasive process but is used rarely because of its density and cost.

Liquid  selection  is  less  important  and  usually  is  dictated  by  the  damage  potential  to  the
formation. Because some fluid is lost to the formation in any jetting job, the damage aspect of
the carrier fluid should be investigated. The ability of the fluid to lift solids usually is limited
to  lifting  the  sand  abrasive.  The  steel  removed  in  the  process  is  too  fine  to  cause  significant
plugging problems.

Advantages  of  abrasive-perforating  methods  include  the  ability  to  make  perforations  with
maximum flow area and with minimum damage to the formation or to the integrity of the steel
pipe. The perforations are shallow in most cases, limited by the backwash of returning fluids,
but are notably undamaged in most tests. The best applications have been in heavy oil comple-
tions  in  which  large  inflow  area  in  the  pipe  is  a  necessity  and  pipe  cutoff  is  advantageous.
Disadvantages of these methods are the time needed to create each perforation, the amount of
equipment  required  (coiled  tubing  or  small  tubing),  the  need  to  kill  or  control  the  well  while
creating the perforation, and solids cleanup.

4.4.3 Water Jets.  Although  water  jets  with  pressure  impact  on  the  order  of  20,000  psi  are
used as steel cutters in surface applications, they usually are not effective downhole when the
backpressure is more than approximately 1,500 psi. The use of these tools is limited sharply by
friction  pressure  drop  in  the  small  diameter,  long-tubing  strings  used  to  supply  fluid  to  the
point of cutting. Water jets have been used to create perforation tunnels in openhole comple-
tions.  A  special  adaptation  of  the  water  jet  used  a  hydraulic  punch  to  open  a  “door”  in  the
casing  through  which  a  flexible  water-jet  lance  was  fed  to  extend  a  long  perforation  into  the
rock. With few exceptions, water-jet perforating is a special application.

4.4.4 Shaped Charges.  The  shaped  charge  or  “jet”  perforator  uses  a  small  amount  of  high
explosive and a carefully shaped case and liner to create a focused pressure punch that is high-
ly effective in piercing steel, cement, and rock. The jet is formed through a highly critical, but
usually  reliable,  sequence  of  events.  The  sequence  begins  with  the  firing  of  the  initiator  or
detonator  cap,  which  ignites  the  detonation  cord  at  high  energy,  followed  by  the  initiation  of
the charges. The entire sequence of the explosive event must be carried out in high order. Fail-
ure to achieve or maintain high-order firing at any point in the explosive sequence will cause
all subsequent explosive to initiate low order and burn with very slow energy release.

Fig. 4.2 shows the components of a shaped-charge perforator. Fig. 4.3 contains an X-ray of
a  20-g,  steel-cased  charge  that  shows  the  detail  assembly  necessary  for  these  charges.  The
charge case holds the explosive powder and focuses the firing explosive event. The primer area
usually  holds  a  small  amount  of  slightly  destabilized,  secondary  high  explosive.  The  primer
initiates the main explosive in the charge. As the explosive front moves through the charge, it
strikes the apex of the liner deforming the liner and fluidizing part of its mass into a focused
jet that punches a hole through the material in its path. Fig. 4.4 shows a jet formation from a
shaped  charge.  As  the  jet  forms,  it  stretches  out  with  the  jet  tip  approaching  speeds  of  6100
m/s (21,000 ft/sec), and the tail of the jet traveling at approximately 3,000 m/s (11,000 ft/sec).
For  illustration,  several  unusual  targets  have  been  used  to  capture  jet  performance  with  high-
speed cameras.5 In one of the most unusual experiments, the path of a jet through both sides of
a  crystal  wine  goblet  was  captured  on  ultra-high-speed  film  and  shows  full  jet  development
before  the  goblet  shattered.  In  effect,  the  hole  is  placed  before  the  target  “knows”  that  it  has
been hit.

Penetration of a shaped-charge jet through a target proceeds with the jet pushing aside ev-
erything in its path. The effect is similar to driving a nail through a block of wood. The wood
around the nail hole is compacted tightly. Permeability in porous rock is reduced frequently in
the compacted zone. There is almost no heat transfer during the jet penetration, although some
target heating usually is seen from the post-explosion byproduct gases. Almost any target, in-
cluding  paper,  can  be  perforated  with  a  shaped  charge.  A  classic  example  of  penetration  and
compaction  is  the  penetration  of  a  jet  through  a  thick  telephone  book.  The  area  around  the
perforation tunnel in the paper is highly compacted to a radius of approximately 0.4 in. (1 cm).
Straightening out the uncharred paper in the crushed zone revealed that very little of the paper
was  lost  during  perforating.  Because  fluids  must  flow  through  this  crush  zone,  understanding
how and why it forms and how to remove or bypass it is of primary importance in completion
engineering.6,7

With shaped charges, the perforation penetration usually is thought to be proportional to the
weight of the charge. Although the charge size has an effect on the performance, the shape of
the liner, the internal standoff in the gun, and the overall design are also important. In a through-
tubing  application  in  which  the  carriers  are  small,  the  charge  size  will  vary  from  2  to

approximately 8 g. The smallest charges are used in 1  ∕16
∕16
11 -in. hollow carriers and the
larger sizes are used in expendable strips. In hollow-carrier casing guns with diameters of 3⅛
in.  or  larger,  charge  weights  of  more  than  12  g  are  common  (typically  22  to  37  g  for  5-in.-
diameter guns). Normally, the largest charges are used in the large expendable guns and casing
guns in which the charges are more than 50 g. Openhole perforating guns that are designed to
reach beyond mud damage in an openhole completion may use charges of 90 g or more.

4.5 Basic Perforating Design—Variables of Flow Through a Perforation
Shaped-charge  perforations  are  used  as  the  model  for  the  rest  of  this  discussion.  Perforations
are tapering tubes of usually less than 0.8 in. (2 cm) diameter at the entrance hole in the cas-
ing and depth of 1 in. (2.5 cm) to more than 30 in. (74 cm). Primary flow from the formation
is through the end and walls of the tube. Flow behavior typically is dominated by radial flow
with some pseudoradial character in longer perforations. Length, diameter, and permeability of
the rock around the perforation control flow through a perforation.8 Many early studies ignored
the  damage  around  the  perforation  tunnel  and  focused  on  the  importance  of  length  and  en-
trance  hole  diameter.  Putting  damage  effects  aside,  the  length  of  the  perforation  tunnel  is
theoretically the most critical factor in a natural completion in which no further stimulation or
sand control is planned. Entrance hole diameter becomes more important when some sand con-
trol  completion  designs  are  planned  or  fracturing  is  needed.  Because  of  the  early  studies  that
ignored the effects of formation damage, the primary selling points of perforating charges be-
came  perforated  length  and  entrance  hole  diameter.  These  two  elements  diminish  in  signifi-
cance when the effect of formation damage is studied.7,9,10

Perforating  charge  performance  in  producing  both  entrance  hole  and  perforation  length  is
related more closely to charge design than charge size. The charge variables include propellant
type,  size,  and  design.  The  formation  variables  include  formation  strength,  pressure,  porosity,
grain size, and fluids in the pores.11 Perforating charge power is provided by the explosive and
focused by the case and liner to produce a jet. The jet may be shaped to maximize either en-
trance hole or tunnel penetration. The completion type dictates the type of perforation needed

and thus the type of charge. No matter which charge is selected, however, the flow path must
have a higher flow capacity than the formation can supply. Otherwise, it becomes a restriction
in  the  reservoir-to-wellbore  connection.  Flow  connection  should  be  the  primary  consideration
when selecting a perforating charge. Charge penetration can be optimized for specific nonper-
meable  targets  such  as  cement  and  may  produce  a  phenomenally  long  perforated  length  and
very low flow capacity. Flow capacity should be the requirement in any producing environment.
As the jet penetrates the formation, the material in its path is thrust to the side, creating a
zone of lowered permeability. The amount of permeability loss depends on the structure, poros-
ity, and fluid of the formation and the size and design of the charge. Studies of permeability
loss in targets and back calculation of damage in relatively homogeneous formations show per-
meabilities  of  approximately  35  to  80%  of  the  initial  formation  permeability.  There  are  three
critical requirements to achieving a highly conductive flow path: select the optimum perforat-
ing equipment (including, but not limited to, charges) for the completion type, select the fluids
and  charge  for  the  best  formation  interaction  (minimize  damage),  and  use  the  application
method (underbalance, overbalance, surging, etc.) that provides the best cleanup and flow capac-
ity in the perforations.8,12–18

The best-known design considerations for perforating are perforation length, shot-phase an-
gle, perforation density, entrance hole size, and perforating flow efficiency. To design properly
for  optimum  perforating  requires  preplanning  and  consideration  of  parameters  such  as  filtered
perforating fluid, amount of underbalance or overbalance, through tubing vs. casing or expend-
able guns, the method for conveying guns, and gun clearance. Special considerations, such as
ultrahigh compressive strength rock (> 30,000 psi UCS), require special charges.19

4.6 Temperature Effect
The  higher  the  wellbore  temperatures,  the  shorter  the  time  that  the  perforating  jet  charge  is
stable. Fig. 4.5 illustrates stable time at temperature for charges made from common types of
explosives. Guidelines for high-temperature charge selection vary, but most wireline-conveyed
charges  should  be  stable  at  the  temperature  for  16  to  24  hours.  Tubing-conveyed  perforating
charges,  for  operations  involving  extended  time  at  the  bottomhole  temperature,  must  remain
stable for approximately 100 hours or more to allow for running the tubing and nippling up the
wellhead.  Higher  temperature  charges  for  operations  involving  extended  time  at  temperatures
greater than 300°F (149°C) are available, although they are more costly. When selecting a high-
temperature charge, all parts of the system, including detonator, detonation cord, charges, seals
and mechanical components, must be rated for the time at temperature and must work together.
When  perforating  charges  explode  low  order  or  burn,  large  fragments  of  the  charge  cases
will  remain.  These  fragments  are  primary  evidence  of  the  problem.  Fig.  4.6  shows  charged
cases removed from a low-order gun. Gun breaches during low-order detonation or burning are
common. Fig. 4.7 shows a burst gun fished from a well after low-order firing. Anytime whole

charge cases or large sections of charge cases are found in the gun debris, the perforating job
quality is highly suspect, and the perforating task should be evaluated or redone.

4.7 Basic Perforating Design—What Is Necessary for the Optimum Flow Path
Before selecting components for a perforating job, the first task is to understand how to get the
best  flow  path  possible  for  the  time  and  money  invested  and  the  risk  taken.  The  amount  of
flow  capacity  needed  must  be  determined  first.  Flow  capacity  needs  are  a  reflection  of  how
much  and  what  type  of  fluids  that  the  formation  can  deliver  to  the  wellbore.  Inflow  perfor-
mance  modeling  with  representative  values  of  formation  permeability  and  fluid  viscosity  is
necessary.  The  objective  of  perforating  is  to  place  open  perforations  at  the  correct  depth  that
extend through the casing and cement sheath into the formation. To be effective, the perfora-
tion  tunnel  must  be  in  contact  with  a  permeable  part  of  the  formation  and  must  not  be
damaged by any mechanism that would stop or impede the transfer of fluids between the for-
mation and the wellbore.6,7,20

Optimizing  petroleum  production  is  an  exercise  in  removing  pressure  drops  in  a  flowing
system that stretches from the outer boundaries of the reservoir to the sales line. The perforat-
ing  process  is  one  element  in  this  engineering  exercise.  To  optimize  the  whole  process,  the
most severe pressure drops must be examined and removed. As each pressure drop is reduced,
the increased flow may change the requirements in another section of the well. Increasing the

flow capacity of the reservoir by stimulation or flooding places a greater capacity requirement
on  the  perforations.  Other  well  completion  actions,  such  as  gravel  packing,  change  the  flow
requirement on the perforation by filling the perforation with gravel. Each action changes the
criteria for perforation design; therefore, initial perforating designs may not be optimal for later
well production. Well design should allow for flexibility in the completion type, which allows
for adding perforation density in a zone or perforating other zones after the well has been eval-
uated or produced.

Phasing  is  the  angle  between  the  charges,  and  Fig.  4.8  shows  a  common  perforator  phas-
ing. Although there are many possible angles, the five common values are 0°, 180°, 120°, 90°,
and  60°.  0°  phasing  aligns  all  the  shots  in  a  row.  The  gun  should  be  decentralized,  typically
against  the  low  side  of  the  casing,  so  that  performance  from  small  charges  is  maximized  by
minimizing  the  clearance  between  the  gun  and  the  casing  wall.  0°  phasing  normally  is  used
only  in  the  smaller  OD  guns  or  guns  in  very  large  casing.  0°  phasing  has  some  drawbacks
because putting all the shots in a row lowers tubular yield strength and makes the casing more
susceptible  to  splits  and  collapse  at  shot  densities  greater  than  6  SPF.  Fracture  stimulating  in
wells that were perforated with 0° phasing may result in a slightly higher incidence of fractur-
ing screenouts than with 60°, 90°, or 120° phasing. It is unknown whether the screenouts result
from the smaller entrance holes or from one wing of the fracture wrapping around the pipe.

Of  the  other  common  phasing  possibilities,  60°,  90°,  and  120°  are  usually  the  most  effi-
cient  choices  from  a  fracture  stimulation  standpoint  because  they  will  produce  a  perforation
just a few degrees from any possible fracture direction. These phased carriers may not need to
be centralized to give good perforations because, regardless of where they contact the casing,
at least two or three optimum perforations per foot should be formed. In small carrier guns in
large casing, only 0° phasing should be used because the perforations closest to the gun will be
fully developed, while the perforations with the largest gun clearance will be shorter and have
a very small diameter. Casing guns offer much better phasing but often cannot be used to add
perforations in an existing completion without major intervention.

Perforating phasing is known to affect production in both theoretical and practical applica-
tions. Locke, for example, showed that for a 12-in. penetration into the formation, a theoretical
productivity ratio of 1.2 is predicted from 90° phasing of 4 SPF, while the productivity ratio is
approximately  0.99  when  the  4  shots  are  in  0°  phasing.8  This  is  ideal  behavior  and  does  not
consider  damage.  When  damage  is  considered,  the  actual  formation  character  and  perforation
application details may create a much different outcome, although the effect of additional phas-
ing is usually beneficial.

Perforation length usually is thought to be the most important characteristic in a perforation
design. Surprisingly, there are several cases in which perforated length does not make a signifi-
cant  difference  in  well  productivity.  Only  in  natural  completions  does  the  perforation  tunnel

length dominate the other factors. Even in natural completions, the flow capacity of the perfo-
rated  connections  is  the  most  important  factor.  Factors  such  as  hydraulic  fracturing  or
prepacked  gravel-pack  operations  negate  the  advantages  of  a  few  extra  inches  of  perforated
length.  For  hydraulic  fracturing  or  gravel-pack  treatments,  a  large,  effective  entrance  hole
through the pipe and cement is more important than total perforation penetration.

Although  rarely  considered,  the  perforation  diameter  also  may  influence  the  productivity
ratio, especially in high productivity wells. Perforation diameter is dependent on charge design
and the clearance of the gun in the casing. In instances such as sand control operations, unsta-
ble formations (including some chalks), and wells that are to be hydraulically fracture stimulat-
ed, the perforation diameter is important enough to dominate perforator selection. Flow through
an open perforation should not be a restriction in the flowing system.

The choice between penetration length and entrance hole size is made available by the size
of the charges and an element of the charge design. A charge’s design affects the hole diame-
ter  and  penetration.  Fig.  4.9  shows  deep  penetrating  and  big-hole  charge  performances  from
34-g charges.

A  deep-penetrating  charge  has  a  different  shaped  liner  (and  sometimes  a  different  case)
from that of a big-hole charge. The deep-penetrating charge spends the bulk of its energy creat-
ing a long tunnel, while the big-hole charge focuses its energy on the casing wall and creating
hole diameter. Deep-penetrating charges normally are used in natural completions, and big-hole
charges are used more for gravel packing and fracturing, in which hole size offers less restric-
tion  to  wither  outflow  during  fracturing  or  inflow  during  production  when  the  perforation  is
filled with gravel. Big-hole charges may have some disadvantages in both pipe and formation
strength.  The  design  of  big-hole  charges  produces  maximum  force  impact  at  the  wall  of  the
casing and can cause damage (and weakening) to the formation adjacent to the entry hole. For
completions in weak formations in which sand production could be an issue and gravel pack-
ing or frac packing will not be used, deep penetrating charges at high density (12 to 16 SPF or
39 to 54 SPM) are recommended. If the zone collapses, however, reperforating with sufficient
density of phased shots is required before gravel-pack operations are instituted.

The number of perforations is always a factor in completion design. Shot densities from 1
to 27 SPF (3 to 88 SPM) are available. High shot densities usually are required for very high
flow  rate  formations,  for  single  point  application  of  fractures  in  deviated  wellbores,  and  for
laminated  formations  that  will  not  be  linked  by  fracturing.  Optimum  shot  density  for  a  well
can  best  be  determined  with  a  nodal  analysis  simulator;  however,  judgment  is  needed  when
dealing with highly laminated formations or when the formation flow path is suitably inhomo-
geneous to create limited entry effects in the inflow. Adding perforations is often an excellent
diagnostic tool.

IV-160

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Assuming  all  perforations  are  open  to  flow,  shot  densities  of  4  SPF  (13  SPM)  with  90°
phasing and with 13-mm (0.5-in.) holes usually are sufficient to ensure the equivalent of open-
hole  productivity.  However,  increased  shot  densities  (greater  than  4  per  foot)  may  improve
productivity  ratios  under  certain  conditions,  such  as  very  high  flowrate  wells  or  in  gravel-
packed  wells.  The  real  number  of  open  perforations,  those  producing  or  taking  fluid,  is
typically only approximately 50% of the total holes in the pipe. (The 50% value was reached
after examining hundreds of hours of downhole television recordings in dozens of wells.) The
cause of nonfunctioning perforations is usually traced to nonproductive layers in the formation
or  to  damaged  perforations.  Perforating  produces  a  damage  zone  around  the  perforation  in
which  permeability  may  be  reduced  substantially  below  that  of  the  native  state  formation.
Longer  perforations  are  less  influenced  by  the  crush  zone  than  are  short  perforations.  Phased
perforations, such as 90° phased perforations, are less affected than 0° phased perforations. The
damage in the near wellbore, plus the damage in the crushed zone, can cause severe pressure
drops. However, most damage from drilling mud is confined near the face of the formation. In
cases  of  nonwater-sensitive  sandstones,  the  damage  zone  should  not  be  of  significance.  The
crushed zones will be created regardless of damage but may be minimized by underbalance or
extreme overbalance perforating.

4.8 Improving Flow Capacity
Creating a perforation is relatively easy. Creating a low-pressure-drop flow path requires con-
siderably  more  effort.  As  previously  stated,  most  perforations  have  a  crushed  zone  and  other
damage mechanisms that hinder production. To improve flow capacity, underbalanced perforat-
ing, extreme overbalanced perforating, surging, or one of several breakdown actions is neces-
sary to clean the perforations and improve flow capacity.

In  most  cases,  overbalanced  perforating  drives  the  wellbore  fluid  into  the  perforation  and
has the capacity to create particulate damage in the perforations. Clean fluid becomes a perfo-
rating  requirement.  Studies  of  the  flow  rate  needed  to  remove  damage  report  that  serious
perforation plugging occurs when the pressure is higher in the wellbore than in the formation.
The  plugs  consist  of  crushed  formation,  liner  particles,  case  material  from  the  charges,  pipe
dope,  and  mud.  In  many  lab  and  field  cases,  a  plug  formed  when  overbalance  perforating  in
heavy mud is almost impossible to remove by reversing pressure.

Underbalance  perforating,  or  perforating  with  the  pressure  in  the  wellbore  lower  than  the
pressure in the formation, generally is acknowledged to be one of the best methods for creating
open,  undamaged  perforations  in  which  the  permeability  is  high  enough  to  create  sufficient
flow rate to break the crush zone loose and carry it out of the perforation tunnel. In a simpli-
fied  view,  the  initial  underbalance  surge  and  the  subsequent  flow  clean  up  the  perforations
across the interval. In the real world, the initial surge at the moment of perforating opens up
the  perforations  in  the  highest  permeability  streaks  in  the  formation.  As  the  pressure  quickly
equalizes, only a few more perforations may be opened and cleaned. For this reason, long per-
forated  intervals  may  not  be  as  effectively  cleaned  by  underbalanced  perforating  as  shorter
intervals with lower shot density.

The pressure differential required to remove damage from a perforation is affected by pres-
sure,  flow  rate,  and  formation  integrity.  Initially,  pressure  differentials  for  underbalanced
perforating  were  established  by  trial  and  error,  but  a  connection  finally  was  spotted  relating
underbalance pressure and flow to formation permeability.10,11

The results of underbalance studies of more than 100 wells that were underbalance perforat-
ed,  tested  acidized,  and  retested  are  shown  in  Fig.  4.10  for  oil  wells  and  Fig.  4.11  for  gas
wells.14 The response of an HCl acid job in the sandstone formation showed whether or not the
underbalance pressure applied adequately cleaned the perforations.

Although underbalance pressure is of critical importance in generating clean perforations, it
is  the  flow  rate  created  by  the  underbalance  that  is  responsible  for  cleaning  the  perforation.

Chapter 4—Perforating

IV-161

Fig. 4.11—Underbalance pressures used for oil wells.

The  importance  of  flow  after  underbalance  perforating  cannot  be  overemphasized.  The  flow
volume needed from a single perforation to clean debris is estimated at a minimum of 4 gal. In
more  recent  work  on  deepwater  wells  in  which  surge  volume  is  limited  by  operational  and
policy guidelines, a 20-bbl surge has shown to be very effective in cleaning the perforations. If
the permeability is too low to achieve significant flow rate (< 1 md), underbalance perforating
may not be effective. The most frequent causes of failure for underbalance perforating are low
formation permeability and lack of flow immediately after the perforating gun fires. Candidate
formations  with  permeabilities  of  more  than  1  md  are  best,  although  sandstones  are  usually
much better candidates than carbonates.

EOP is a microfracture-initiating process that is applied at the moment of initial perforating
or as a surge process to existing perforations.21,22 The technique uses stored gas energy in the
tubing  to  break  down  the  zone.  Bottomhole  pressure  equivalents  to  1.4  psi/ft  and  higher  are
applied instantaneously through the use of a nitrogen gas supercharge contained in the tubing.
The energy is isolated in the tubulars of an unperforated well and behind a shear disk or other
device in the tubing on a well that has already been perforated. The energy imparted is more
sudden than a traditional hydraulic fracturing process and more sustained than an explosive or
propellant treatment.

IV-162

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

The  fracture  created  by  the  EOP  surge  is  more  likely  to  fracture  more  perforations  in  an
exposed  zone  than  a  traditional  fracture  process  applied  as  an  all-liquid  hydraulic-fracturing
process.  Work  with  production  logs  and  radioactive-isotope-tagged  sand  after  EOP  jobs  indi-
cates  that  multiple  zones  tend  to  break  down  more  evenly  when  EOP  is  used.  Although  a
fracture  is  created  during  extreme  overbalance  perforating  or  surging,  its  initiation  does  not
appear to be controlled initially by formation stresses or traditional rock mechanics forces, prob-
ably because the 1.4 psi/ft gradient is considerably greater than most fracture gradients of 0.7
to  0.9  psi/ft.  Because  of  the  very  high  pressure  of  the  initial  surge,  the  pressure  behind  the
surge  is  probably  greater  than  the  fields  of  maximum  and  minimum  principal  stresses  in  the
formation. As a result, the initial direction of the fracture is in the plane of greatest mechanical
near-wellbore  weakness:  the  perforations.  After  the  estimated  6-second  life  of  the  pulse,  the
fracture direction probably is controlled by the traditional stress forces, and subsequent fracture
growth goes perpendicular to the plane of least principal stress.

Although  treatment  designs  are  still  being  refined,  the  initial  successes  have  focused  on
maximizing the kinetic energy in the job. This is accomplished by minimizing the liquid in the
tubing  to  eliminate  friction  pressure  of  liquid  movement  during  the  surge.  Most  job  designs
focus on filling the tubing with nitrogen and filling the casing below the packer with liquid.

A  modification  of  the  EOP  process  uses  explosive  propellant  to  deliver  a  pressure  pulse
that  achieves  the  same  type  of  breakdown  as  the  fluid,  but  with  minimum  equipment.23  The
propellant is molded into a sleeve that is mounted on the outside of the perforating gun when
adding perforations or as a stick when pulsing old perforations. Firing the perforating gun ig-
nites the slower burning propellant, creating a gas pulse that breaks down the perforations. The
pressure pulse lasts only a few seconds, but its location at the perforations helps break down
crush zone damage. Fractures created by either the EOP or propellant process are not propped
and will likely close after the event if not propped. The cleanout benefits of the process, how-
ever, have been well documented.

Surging  perforations  to  achieve  cleanup  is  an  effective  tool  provided  that  the  differential
pressure is high enough to create enough fluid movement to clean the perforations. Few guide-
lines  exist  on  surging  other  than  at  the  local  field  level.  Surges  from  500  to  2,000  psi  are
common  and  are  applied  as  suddenly  as  possible.  The  surges  are  most  effective  when  the
“valve”  for  the  process  is  close  to  the  formation.  Long,  small  inside  diameter  tubing  strings
dampen  the  surge  effectiveness  because  of  high  flowing  friction  resistance  during  the  surge
flow. Typically, not all perforations are opened by surging.

4.9 Cement and Casing Damage
Casing and cement damage during perforating has been debated for years.24–30 There is proba-
bly little shattering or cracking damage to a good cement sheath from perforating. Tests have
been  conducted  on  more  than  50  targets  with  unconfined  compressive  strength  from  1,500  to
more than 9,000 psi. When the perforation is more than approximately 4 in. from a free face
(top or bottom of the target), there is almost no instance of cement shattering noted after firing.
Splitting (longitudinal) along the perforated planes is seen in some targets but is an artifact of
the test. In surface tests, cement cracking following perforating is the result of the test method,
not the perforating process.

Either the casing or the carrier must absorb the explosive shock of charge detonation. Air-
filled  hollow-carrier  guns  absorb  most  of  the  detonation  pressure;  therefore,  there  is  less
possibility  of  casing  splits  caused  by  rupture.  This  becomes  very  important  when  shooting  a
large number of holes or whenever casing strength is important. The collapse resistance of the
casing (and resistance to splits) depends on the number of holes in the pipe, the hole size, and
their alignment (shot  phasing).  Casing  guns  with  staggered phasing  have  improved the  casing
collapse  resistance  loss.  These  guns,  which  use  deep-penetrating  charges,  often  result  in  less
than 10% casing strength crush resistance loss at shot densities of 16 or more SPF. Perforating

Chapter 4—Perforating

IV-163

with  hollow-carrier guns  causes  only  slight  reduction in  yield or  collapse strength  of  the  cas-
ing. Expendable and semiexpendable guns cause substantially more damage because the casing
must stand the shock of detonation. Casing of low or unknown strength (corroded, old, flawed,
or poorly supported casing) definitely should be shot with a hollow-carrier gun.

4.10 Perforating Multiple Strings and Thick Cement
Concentric casing strings reduce the penetration of any perforating charge.31,32 The thickness of
the extra string of casing, as well as the thickness of the two sheaths of cement that must be
penetrated,  reduces  the  perforation  penetration  length.  In  severe  cases  of  small  liners  set
through  larger  pipe,  such  as  5-in.  liner  cemented  in  9⅝-in.  casing,  perforating  both  strings  is
considerably more difficult. For the best chance of perforating multiple strings, the largest, best
designed deep-penetrating charge that can be run will generally have the best chance of pene-
trating through all the strings and into the formation.29 Through-tubing guns are not recommend-
ed  for  shooting  concentric  strings  because  hole  size  and  penetration  are  reduced  with  small
charges.

In deviated wells in which concentric strings are to be perforated, the perforating gun will
ride  the  low  side  of  the  pipe.  When  a  casing  gun  is  used  for  this  operation,  shot  phasing  of
60°,  90°,  or  120°  should  be  used  to  obtain  the  best  chances  of  making  perforations  by  the
charges with the least clearance. The use of centralization techniques (if possible) on the guns
run in deviated wells are recommended if hydraulic fracturing is to be used. This allows perfo-
rations to be placed near both fracture wings. Centralization also improves the roundness of the
holes because the gun clearance will be near ideal. If inadequate perforations are a problem in
wells with concentric strings, the innermost casing can be milled out (albeit at great expense)
and the completion made through the outer casing.

When  casing  is  run  and  cemented  through  washed-out  sections,  the  cement  sheath  can  be
sufficiently thick to deny access to the formation with any perforator. When drilling a well into
an easily washable pay zone, care must be taken to obtain a gauge or near-gauge hole so that
the perforations will reach into the pay.

4.11 Perforating for Different Stimulations
The type of stimulation or ultimate well completion should influence the perforation design. In
gravel-packing operations, a large number of phased, big holes usually are desired to enhance
gravel  placement  and  reduce  the  velocity  of  fluids  coming  into  the  wellbore.33  Although  en-
trance  hole  diameter  is  the  principal  concern,  the  perforation  efficiency  must  not  be
overlooked.34 Effective gravel placement requires leakoff, which is a feature of a high efficien-
cy  perforation.  Decreased  fluid  velocity  during  production  will  result  in  less  fines  movement
and  plugging  in  the  pack.  Because  the  perforations  may  be  filled  with  gravel,  more  perfora-
tions are required to generate the same productivity as open perforations.

Fracturing stimulations also require special perforating design.35 Considerations include suf-
ficient perforations to avoid detrimentally shearing the fluid (lowering the viscosity by degrad-
ing  the  polymer  or  crosslinked  system)  and  to  avoid  needless  high  pumping  costs.  The
viscosity of a fracturing fluid is a designed part of the stimulation treatment, and, if altered, the
treatment may not meet expectations of proppant-carrying capacity. If this carrying capacity is
destroyed by high shear, the sand may fall out of the fluid too soon, causing a blockage of the
wellbore, perforations, or fracture with injected sand (a screenout). For more information, see
the chapters on sand control and fracturing in this section of the Handbook.

4.12 Perforating in Highly Deviated Wells
The perforating design needed for a cased and cemented highly deviated (greater than approxi-
mately 60°) well may be different from the design needed for a vertical well, even in a similar
formation.  The  main  factors  are  placement  of  guns,  cost  of  perforating  in  very  long  sections,

IV-164

need to produce selectively from a certain section of the wellbore, coning control, and need for
focusing injected fluid into a single interval when fracturing or acidizing.

The number of perforations needed for well production, either deviated or vertical, depends
on the inflow potential. Perforating costs can increase as pay contact increases, leading to re-
duced  perforation  density.  A  better  method  of  perforating  cost  control  is  to  use  logging
methods to identify zones of best porosity, oil saturation, and pressure (or flow in which pro-
duction  logging  tool  data  are  usable),  and  concentrate  perforations  in  those  areas.  Leaving
unperforated  sections  in  a  highly  deviated  or  horizontal  well  also  gives  remedial  operations
such as plug setting a much better chance for success.

Fracturing in deviated wells requires a decision of whether to perforate the whole zone or
to concentrate the perforations to ensure a single fracture breakdown. There is disagreement on
the  importance  of  numerous  perforations  in  initiation  of  “starter  fractures”  formed  in  highly
perforated zones. Localizing perforations can control the point of fracture initiation. Field per-
formance has shown that perforating at 8 to 16 SPF over a 2- to 5-ft interval is sufficient to
initiate  a  fracture.  In  field  application  of  multiple  fractures  in  deviated  wells,  perforating  3  ft
(approximately  1  m)  of  the  wellbore  before  each  fracture  job  has  produced  good  results.  Al-
though this approach is effective in providing sufficient wellbore contact with the main fracture
to  prevent  early  screenout,  it  does  not  address  potential  inflow  from  the  unfractured  matrix
pays into the cased and cemented wellbore. Adding perforations along the length after all frac-
turing is one option, but obtaining any type of cleanup or breakdown of these added perfora-
tions can be accomplished only with a straddle packer.

4.13 Perforating Equipment

4.13.1 Guns/Carriers.  In  shaped-charge  perforators,  there  are  two  basic  carriers:  the  retriev-
able hollow carrier and the expendable or semiexpendable carrier. The most important consider-
ation in selecting a perforator is choosing a gun system that matches the requirements dictated
by the completion.

Hollow-carrier  guns  can  be  run  either  on  wireline  or  on  tubing.  They  may  carry  large
charges, which normally minimize casing damage. The carrier contains most of the debris from
the  charge  and  the  alignment  system.  Hollow-carrier  guns  are  tubes  that  contain  the  shaped
charges.  The  guns  may  be  of  a  small  size,  able  to  pass  through  tubing  and  restrictions  and
place  initial  perforations  or  add  perforations,  or  of  larger  sizes  that  are  run  through  casing,
conveyed  by  either  work  strings  or  the  production  tubing.  Both  reusable  and  single-use  guns
are  offered,  although  higher  pressure  and  more  expensive  wells  typically  use  the  single-use
guns to minimize leaks and problems. Single-use guns are designed as expendables because the
shaped charge perforates through the gun body. There is usually a “scallop” spot milled in the
outside  of  the  hollow-carrier  tube  at  the  charge  location.  The  scallop  contains  the  exit  burr
from  the  charge  firing,  which  prevents  scoring  of  polished  bores  if  the  gun  is  moved  after
firing  and  may  minimize  gun  swelling.  The  scallop  also  may  minimize  the  metal  thickness
penetrated, although this affects the perforation charge performance less than 10%. Keeping the
charge  exit  point  within  the  scallop  becomes  critical  when  through-tubing  guns  are  used  in
which polished bores must be traversed with the gun after firing or when tubing clearances are
critical.

There is some distortion (swelling) in the body of almost all hollow-carrier guns after fir-
ing. The amount of the distortion is a function of the size of the gun and the type and size of
the charge used. The gun diameter, gun wall thickness, charge size, shot density, shot phasing,
and  well  pressure  are  all  factors  in  the  gun  distortion.  On  the  larger  diameter,  thick-walled
guns, there is much less distortion than on the small, thin-walled through-tubing guns. In wells
in which clearances between the gun and tubulars are critical, the amount of distortion of the
gun should be determined from the service company before the gun is used. Gun body swell

∕16
11 -in. guns shot in low pressure
ranges from approximately 10% diameter growth in small, 1 
wells to less than 1% diameter growth in larger guns and those shot at high pressure. Fig. 4.12
shows a gun swell after firing in a low-pressure test. Gun bowing is often noted in small guns
of 2⅛ in. diameter or less, whereas larger guns, because of the increased resistance to bending
with increasing diameter, show no evidence of bowing.

Hollow-carrier guns, depending on their diameter and design, may be loaded with 1 to 27
shots/ft and have all the commonly used phase angles as well as specialty phasings. The small-
er through-tubing guns should be run through a lubricator and typically are limited to approxi-
mately 40 ft in length, less for larger, heavier guns. The advantages of through-tubing guns are
low cost, the ability to perforate underbalanced, and the ability to maintain positive well con-
trol.  The  disadvantages  of  through-tubing  guns  are  limited  penetration,  small  entry  hole,  and
the production limitation of 0° phasing.

Expendable guns have charges that are exposed to well fluids and pressures. The expend-
able guns are popular for through-tubing applications. They are more vulnerable to damage, but
without the bulk of the gun body, larger charges can be run through any given small or buck-
led  tubing  restriction.  The  expendable  and  semiexpendable  carriers  normally  can  use  a  larger
charge for a given tubing or casing size than the hollow-carrier guns because only the skin of
the  capsule  around  each  charge  separates  it  from  the  walls  of  the  casing.  With  expendable
guns,  there  is  also  more  flexibility  because  some  bending  can  be  achieved.  The  expendable
guns are popular for through-tubing applications. The charges are lined together by a common
strip,  wire/cable,  or  a  linked  body  design.  The  expendable  guns  force  the  casing  to  endure  a
much  higher  explosive  load  during  firing  because  the  recoil  is  not  contained  in  a  sacrificial
shell as in a hollow-carrier gun. Casing splits are sometimes seen with a downhole television
camera after perforating with expendable guns in cased holes with poor cement or low-strength
casing. Expendable guns are used because their perforating performance is significantly better
than hollow-carrier guns in the smaller diameters. When the gun is fired, some or all the link-

IV-166

ing materials, as well as the charge capsule remnants, are left in the hole. Problems with these
guns  have  centered  on  misfires  from  damage  to  the  detonating  cord,  tubing  and  surface  line
plugging from debris, and carrier strip disintegration or severe bending after firing.

Two  factors  that  affect  the  charge  performance  in  hollow-carrier  perforators  are  standoff
and  gun  clearance.  Standoff  is  the  distance  between  the  base  of  the  charge  and  the  inside  of
the port plug or scallop and is a fixed part of the gun/charge system design. Gun clearance is
the  distance  from  the  outside  of  the  port  plug  or  scallop  to  the  wall  of  the  casing.  The  gun
clearance  distance  for  a  4-in.  hollow  carrier,  90°  phased  gun  in  7-in.,  23  lbm/ft,  N-80  casing
can be anywhere from 0 to 2.3 in., depending on the gun position. Unless centralizers are used
on  the  gun,  one  edge  of  the  gun  will  contact  the  casing  wall,  and  maximum  clearance  will
occur  at  180°  to  the  wall  contact.  For  this  reason,  small  guns  are  decentralized  purposely  by
magnets, and the charges are all aligned to fire in the direction of the magnetic positioning (0°
phasing). Larger guns with smaller clearance distances use charges phased around the gun. Typ-
ically, the maximum gun diameter selected should permit washing over the gun with washpipe
in the given casing size.

4.13.2 Detonator Systems.  Once on depth, charges are fired by an initiator or detonator. Deto-
nator  systems  have  been  redesigned  in  recent  years  to  improve  safety  and  to  prevent  several
perforating  problems  that  occur  from  leaks,  pressure  problems,  and  temperature  effects.36,37
Any wireline-conveyed, hollow-carrier gun should have a detonator system that will not allow
the charges to fire if the gun is completely or partially filled with water. If a water-filled hollow-
carrier  gun  is  fired,  the  outer  body  shell  may  rupture  and  result  in  a  fishing  or  milling  job.
Specialized detonators have methods of preventing wet (fluid-filled) gun firing, as well as offer-
ing a number of other safety benefits ranging from resisting stray currents, such as static and
radio energy, to pressure switches that prevent accidental surface firing or resafe the gun when
a live gun is pulled from a well. The standard explosives detonator (also called a blasting cap)
is a mainstay of the construction industry but is not well suited to the petroleum industry. Sev-
eral  accidental  discharges  of  perforating  guns  have  been  linked  directly  to  stray  currents  or
poor  electrical  panel  operational  procedures.  The  resistor  detonator  incorporates  resistors  that
reduce the possibility of discharge from low-power electrical signals. More modern detonators,
including  flying  foil,  programmable  chips,  and  other  units  that  are  radio  safe  and  allow  for
extra safety, are available.

4.13.3 Conveyance Systems.  The  conveyance  system  for  a  perforating  gun  may  be  electric
line, tubing, coiled tubing, pumpdown, or even slickline. The choice of conveyance depends on
the length of the interval to be perforated, the size and weight of guns to be run, the geometry
and  inclination  of  the  wellbore,  and  the  desire  to  accomplish  other  actions  such  as  underbal-
anced  or  overbalanced  perforating,  gravel  packing,  fracturing,  etc.  Well  control  requirements
are  also  a  consideration  because  live-well  perforating  requires  a  lubricator  or  advanced  snub-
bing  techniques.  There  is  a  significant  difference  in  cost  between  the  conveyance  systems.
Wireline generally is the lower cost system in wells in which only a few gun runs are neces-
sary to complete the perforating design.

In  wells  with  deviations  of  less  than  50°  to  60°  and  short  pay  zones,  electric  line  con-
veyance is the primary conveyance process. Electric line is quickly rigged up with a minimum
of  equipment,  and  the  short  guns  fit  the  standard  lubricator  lengths.  Running  a  lubricator  al-
lows the wells to be perforated live, without the need for expensive and potentially damaging
completion fluids. Modifications to lubricator and pressure-control equipment also allow coiled
tubing and some snubbing operations to run and retrieve perforating guns. When a well is per-
forated with a wireline gun with the differential pressure into the well, the flowing fluid tries
to move the cable up the hole because of the lift effect produced by fluid drag and the effect

Chapter 4—Perforating

IV-167

of differential pressure on the area of the gun or cable. In normal operations, this drag is mini-
mal and probably will not be noticed unless the well produces several thousand barrels per day.
The  magnitude  of  the  drag  on  the  cable  depends  on  the  flow.  Following  perforating,  the
liquid column used to control the amount of underbalance pressure is lightened by gas produc-
tion  from  the  formation.  The  liquid  in  the  tubing  also  starts  to  flow  upward  because  of  fluid
influx  from  the  formation.  As  more  gas  enters  the  casing,  there  is  a  period  of  time  in  which
slugs of water are rapidly lifted by the gas. The velocity increases as the slugs rise because of
the expansion of the gas. After all the liquid has been produced from the tubing, the gas flow
can be described as quasisteady state. The maximum lift on the cable occurs during the flow of
water and gas slugs when the liquid slug velocities are high. After firing underbalanced perfora-
tions with a wireline gun, the gun, if possible, should be lowered beneath the perforated zone
to minimize the lift force on the gun body. If it is necessary to flow the well as the gun is run
or  pulled  through  the  tubing,  sinker  bars  will  be  needed  on  the  gun,  and  the  well  should  be
choked  back.  Very  close  clearances  between  the  gun  and  tubing  will  result  in  very  high  lift
forces if the well is flowing.

Because of the need for depth control during perforating, electrical responses from logging
tools to confirm depth are the best method. The logging cable may be standard electric line or
electric line inside coiled tubing. Alternate conveyance methods such as tubing conveyed, non-
electrical  coiled  tubing,  pumpdown,  or  slickline  also  may  be  used,  but  a  separate  method  of
confirming depth, usually relogging to the set gun or a mechanical option, is required.

Through-tubing, hollow-carrier guns are attractive because they can be run through the pro-
duction tubing and packer and require only a service truck-based unit. Generally, the phasing
for the smaller, through-tubing guns ranges from 0° to a staggered pattern of 15° to 45° either
side of the 0° plane (low side of the hole). Complete circumference phasing rarely is used in
small, through-tubing guns because increasing clearance from the gun to the casing wall sub-
stantially  reduces  performance  of  small  charges.  In  3½-in.  and  larger  outside  diameter  (OD)
tubing, through-tubing hollow-carrier guns with larger charges can be used with 180° phasing
to provide adequate penetration.

A major drawback to tubing-conveyed perforating is that there is no way of knowing, ex-
cept by pulling the guns, how many charges were fired. A signal charge device that either fires
a small explosive charge or trips a hammer device a few seconds after the primer cord detona-
tion reaches the bottom of the gun can be used in conjunction with a sensitive sound-recording
device  to  determine  that  the  detonation  cord  was  ignited  to  the  bottom  of  the  gun.  Although
the detonation of the signal charge will not tell how many charges were fired, it does signify
that the primer cord has burned past all the charges. Because the major mechanical problems
of  tubing-conveyed  perforating  systems  have  been  in  two  areas,  failure  to  initiate  the  guns  at
the  firing  head  and  failure  to  initiate  the  next  gun  at  the  gun  junctions,  the  use  of  a  bottom-
shot detector is very advantageous. The reports of early use of this system indicate it has been
very  successful  on  land-based  wells  but  has  problems  on  offshore  wells  because  of  the  high
noise levels associated with platforms.

New  perforating  methods  recently  have  centered  on  the  use  of  casing-conveyed
perforating.38  In  these  methods,  the  perforating  gun  is  attached  to  the  outside  of  the  casing
string, and the guns are deployed during the initial running of the casing string. After the string
is cemented in place, the guns may be fired by a signal, from either the surface or inside the
casing  itself,  opening  the  well  to  production  at  initial  time  or  at  a  later  time  when  a  zone  is
ready to be brought on. This type of perforating could be very beneficial when sequential stim-
ulations of stacked pay zones are planned.

4.13.4 Getting  On  Depth.    No  matter  how  good  the  perforating  system,  it  is  useless  if  the
perforations are not made in the best pay zone. Typical methods of depth control include gam-
ma  ray  tie-in  and  correlation  to  the  original  openhole  gamma  ray  system.  Until  the  develop-

IV-168

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

ment of sturdy gamma ray logs that could stand the shock of firing, the primary depth control
method was to match openhole gamma ray to cased-hole gamma ray strip log and then tie into
the collar locator log. When this method was executed properly, the depth control was accurate
to within half the length of the collar. Unfortunately, a miscount would result in shooting the
gun one joint off depth, which is a complete miss for many zones. With gamma ray logs that
run with the gun, the process is simplified and more reliable.

The second piece of the depth-control puzzle is the distance from the gamma ray detector
to the top shot of the perforating gun. A record of all the measurements of the gun should be
available before the run, and depths should be worked out in advance.

Wireline  measurements,  even  if  corrected  for  stretch,  may  still  be  in  error.  The  wheels  in
the depth-measurement device on logging trucks are calibrated for new cable. Cable wear, ca-
ble stretch, and wear of the measurement wheels can all cause inaccuracy. Magnetic marks or
depth  flags  on  the  cable  are  helpful  but  can  be  thrown  off  by  cable  stretch.  To  account  for
creep in the wireline and to accurately zero in on the depth, the collar locator should be raised
very  slowly  into  the  collar  above  the  pay  and  stopped  when  the  signal  for  the  peak  (collar
location) is only half formed, which indicates that the tool is exactly in the center of the collar.
To  find  the  spot  where  the  tool  is  centered  on  the  collar  and  remains  without  changing  may
take several very slow passes. Once located, the wireline depth of the collar above the pay can
be correlated to the openhole gamma ray log. If the casing (or the tubing in a tubing-conveyed
operation) is run with a short joint or pup joint near the pay, it will be much easier to correlate
tool depth on repeat runs.

Openhole and cased-hole gamma ray logs rarely agree exactly on depth because of differ-
ences in cable and chart paper. The depth correlation is to be made to the openhole log. If two
sections are to be perforated and a single shift will not align the cased-hole log to the openhole
log, each section should be aligned independently to the openhole log.

Improving depth control is relatively easy if a short pup joint of casing is run near the top
of the pay during the initial completion. Recognition of the short joint by the collar locator log
is easy and relatively foolproof. Other methods of depth-control assistance are radioactive tags
in the threads of one casing coupling joint near the pay. The most common depth-control prob-
lem  with  perforations  is  shooting  them  one  joint  off.  The  well’s  plug-back  depth  (or  float
collar) also may be “tagged up” with the bottom of the gun in some wells to check depth. If
the float collar has been drilled out, it also can be used as a short joint for identification.

4.13.5 Perforating Fluid.  The ideal fluid for perforating operations is a solids-free fluid that
will not cause byproducts when exposed to the formation. Acceptable fluids may include 5 to
10% HCl, 10% acetic acid, 2% (or more) KCl water, 2% NH4Cl water, clean brines, and fil-
tered  diesel.  If  a  dirty  fluid  is  used,  there  is  a  distinct  possibility  that  formation  damage  will
occur because of particle plugging at the surface of the perforation tunnels. Even when a high-
er pressure differential toward the wellbore is used, clean fluids are still recommended to avoid
flow of particles into the perforations in the event of a mechanical breakdown, when formation
pressure of productivity is less than expected, or when the well has to be shut in before all the
wellbore fluids have been produced.

Occasionally, high-solids-content fluids must be used during perforating, either for well con-
trol  or  because  of  other  restrictions.  High  particulate  fluids  such  as  drilling  mud  usually  are
designed to form a mud cake on the face of a permeable formation. If drilling mud is used as
a perforating fluid and the pressure differential (either by design or by accident) is toward the
formation  from  the  wellbore,  a  drilling  mud  cake  will  form  in  the  perforations  that  may  be
difficult to remove unless the formation can be produced at a high drawdown for a long period.
Lighter  fluid  columns  such  as  oil  or  diesel  may  be  used  as  perforating  fluids  if  the  full
column  is  diesel  or  oil,  but  6.8  lbm/gal  diesel  cannot  be  kept  spotted  below  9  to  l0  lbm/gal
brine water. Produced oil and diesel also should be filtered before use. Filtration requirements

may vary with the task, but typically a 2- to 5-μm filter with a beta rating of 1,000 is adequate
for most applications.

4.14 Limited Penetration Charges
Tubing puncher charges are used when a hole is needed in tubing for circulation or flow, but
damage  must  be  avoided  to  downhole  equipment  outside  the  target  pipe.  The  tubing  puncher
charge is designed to expend all its energy penetrating the wall without forming additional pen-
etration.

4.15 Pipe Cutoff Methods
Tubing cutoff is important during salvage operations, fishing operations, certain production op-
erations,  and  any  action  that  requires  severing  the  tubing.  The  most  common  pipe  cutoff
methods involve either explosive or chemical cutters. Explosive cutters use the same explosive
technology  used  in  perforating  charges.  Instead  of  a  cylindrical  cone,  however,  the  explosive
and the liner are arranged in a wedge so that the explosive front of the device will push out on
all sides and sever the pipe. Although the technique is effective in most cases, the external part
of the pipe is left with a flare that is often difficult to wash over during pipe recovery opera-
tions. Newer explosive cutters have largely reduced this flare to an acceptable level. Fig. 4.13
shows a flare produced after an explosive cutoff.

Chemical cutting has become one of the most common pipe cutoff methods, especially for
tubing.  The  cutting  fluid  reacts  extremely  quickly  and  generates  intense  heat.  It  is  sprayed
through  a  nozzle  assembly  at  the  walls  of  the  tubing  all  around  the  cutoff  tool.  As  the  fluid
contacts the steel wall, a vigorous reaction occurs and the pipe is separated smoothly without
leaving an external flare. Fig. 4.14 shows an example of a chemical cut pipe. Chemical cutters
can produce very smooth cuts but are very dependent on both orientation and even coverage or
contact  between  the  cutting  chemical  and  the  steel  pipe.  Heavy  walled  pipe,  higher  alloy,  in-
creased  depth,  imperfections  in  the  pipe,  scale,  paraffin,  plastic  liner,  or  incorrect  gun  sizing
can  either  slow  the  chemical  cut  on  that  side  of  the  pipe  or  defeat  it  entirely  so  that  pulling
operations  are  needed  to  finally  separate  the  pipe.  Fig.  4.15  shows  an  example  of  a  partial
chemical cut.

Radial  explosive  cutters,  either  continuous  or  segmented  cutters,  produce  a  pressure  wave
that  is  oriented  outward  and  usually  produce  a  flare  in  the  steel  at  the  cut  point.  Fig.  4.16
shows an example of a cut produced by a Thermite cutter. The severity of this flare can pro-

vide problems in recovering the pipe or in washing over the stuck section. A mill is often run
to dress off the upward-looking connection before running the wash pipe.

Mechanical  cutters  based  on  mill  design  have  been  used  successfully  on  both  jointed  and
coiled tubing applications to sever pipe. These cutters are considerably slower than the chemi-
cal or explosive cutters but can be run on conventional equipment. The mechanical cutters are
best  used  on  softer,  lower  alloy  pipes  with  a  thinner  wall.  High  alloy  pipes  and  very  thick
pipes are more difficult to cut with a mechanical cutter.

Abrasive  cutters  have  been  reintroduced  recently  to  the  market  and  have  the  potential  to
rapidly  sever  almost  any  type  of  pipe  at  any  depth.  These  cutters  use  a  particulate  such  as
sand,  glass  beads,  or  calcium  carbonate  pumped  through  a  rotating  nozzle,  and  the  abrasion
erodes the steel. Cuts through even heavy-walled drillpipe are possible if the cutter can be kept
in the same place during the entire cutting operation. Cuts at surface with abrasive cutters are
very fast; however, the cutting process is slowed because of backpressure when the cutters are
applied downhole. Nonetheless, these cutters are beginning to see extensive use as pipe cutoff
tools.

The cutting system necessary for a particular application depends on the well depth, temper-
ature,  and  size  of  the  tubing  and  alloy  grade  and  weight  of  the  tubing.  However,  the  most

important  factor  is  any  restriction  above  the  cut  point  and  the  ability  to  pull  tension  on  the
pipe. Requirements for cutting tubing include knowledge of the specific design of the well and
any  restrictions  above  the  point  to  be  cut.  Once  the  cut  point  is  selected,  the  cutting  method
should be studied carefully to determine if a clean cut can be made that will requiring a mini-
mum  of  overpull  to  separate  the  uncut  sections  of  the  pipe.  Additional  considerations  include
the conveyance system and the manner of depth control that will place the cutter at the correct
position.

Sand Control

contributions from Baker Oil Tools

5.1 Causes of Sand Production
Conventional well completions in soft formations (the compressive strength is less than 1,000
psi) commonly produce formation sand or fines with fluids. These formations are usually geo-
logically  young  (Tertiary  age)  and  shallow,  and  they  have  little  or  no  natural  cementation.
Sand production is unwanted because it can plug wells, erode equipment, and reduce well pro-
ductivity. It also has no economic value. Nonetheless, formation sand production from wells is
dealt  with  daily  on  a  global  basis.  In  certain  producing  regions,  sand  control  completions  are
the dominant type and result in considerable added expense to operations.

5.1.1 Fluid Flow.  Fluid  flow  from  wells  is  the  consequence  of  the  wellbore  pressure  being
smaller than that in the reservoir. The drag force caused by the flow from large to small pres-
sure  is  related  to  the  velocity-viscosity  product  at  any  point  around  the  well.  Hence,  when
fluids  flow  toward  the  wellbore,  the  tendency  is  for  some  of  the  formation  material  to  flow
concurrently with the fluids.1

5.1.2 Restraining Forces.  Opposing  the  fluid  forces  are  the  restraining  forces  that  hold  the
formation  sand  in  place.  These  consist  of  natural  cementation  (compressive  strength),  friction
between sand grains, fluid pressure in the pores of the rock, and capillary forces. The compres-
sive strength of the rock, the primary restraint, is controlled by intergranular cementation that
is  a  secondary  geologic  process.  As  a  general  rule,  old  sediments  are  more  consolidated  than
are  younger  sediments.  Young  formations  commonly  have  little  cementing  material  and  are
referred  to  as  being  poorly  consolidated.  Stated  another  way,  they  have  low  compressive
strength. Their compressive strengths are usually less than 1,000 psi and may even be so small
that  their  strengths  can  not  be  measured.  The  frictional  forces  are  related  to  the  confining  or
overburden stresses. The stress that causes the rock to fail includes the mechanical stress that
results from the overburden and the drag forces associated from viscous flow of fluids through
the  rock  matrix.  The  overburden  stress  is  partially  supported  by  the  pore  pressure,  so  the  net
stress (the cause of rock failure, the effective stress) is the difference between the overburden
stress and the pore pressure. Capillary forces also can contribute to sand production; there are
numerous examples where sand production occurred when water production began. Sand arches

form,  on  occasion,  around  the  perforations.  The  questions  of  when  and  how  arches  form  are
related to the flow rate, the compressive strength of the formation, and the size of the sand and
the  perforations.  Fig.  5.1  portrays  an  arch  and  the  balance  between  viscous  and  restraining
forces. Unfortunately, sand arches are not stable, and their transient behavior cannot be relied
upon for controlling sand production.

The previous discussion is an oversimplification of the problem, and there are other related
factors.  Think  in  terms  of  sand  production  being  related  to  the  production  rate,  the  pressure
reduction around the well, and the compressive strength of the formation. If the forces caused
by fluid flow exceed the restraining forces, formation sand is produced.

5.2 Consequences of Sand Production
The consequences of sand production are always detrimental to the short-long-term productivi-
ty  of  the  well.  Although  some  wells  routinely  experience  manageable  sand  production,  these
are  the  exception  rather  than  the  rule.  In  most  cases,  attempting  to  manage  sand  production
over the life of the well is not an attractive or prudent operating alternative.

5.2.1 Accumulation Downhole.  If  the  production  velocity  in  well  tubulars  is  insufficient  to
transport sand to the surface, it will begin to fill the inside of the casing. Eventually, the pro-
ducing  interval  may  be  completely  covered  with  sand.  In  this  case,  the  production  rate  will
decline until the well becomes “sanded up” and production ceases. In situations like this, reme-
dial  operations  are  required  to  clean  out  the  well  and  restore  productivity.  One  cleanout
technique is to run a “bailer” on a wireline to remove the sand from the production tubing or
casing.  Because  the  bailer  removes  only  a  small  volume  of  sand  at  a  time,  multiple  wireline
runs are necessary to clean out the well. Another cleanout operation involves running a smaller
diameter tubing string or coiled tubing down into the production tubing to agitate the sand and
lift it out of the well by circulating fluid. The inner string is progressively lowered while circu-

lating  the  sand  out  of  the  well.  This  operation  must  be  performed  cautiously  to  avoid  the
possibility of sticking the inner string inside the production tubing. If the production of sand is
continuous, the cleanout operations may be required periodically, as often as monthly or even
weekly, resulting in lost production and increased well maintenance costs.

5.2.2 Accumulation in Surface Equipment.  If  the  production  velocity  is  sufficient  to  trans-
port sand to the surface, the sand may still become trapped in the separator, heater treater, or
production  flowline.  If  enough  sand  becomes  trapped  in  one  of  these  areas,  cleaning  will  be
required to allow for efficient production of the well. To restore production, the well must be
shut  in,  the  surface  equipment  opened,  and  the  sand  manually  removed.  In  addition  to  the
cleanout cost, the cost of the deferred production must be considered.

5.2.3 Erosion of Downhole and Surface Equipment.  If fluids are in turbulent flow, such sand-
laden  fluids  are  highly  erosive.  Fig.  5.2  is  a  photograph  of  a  section  of  eroded  well  screen
exposed  to  a  perforation  that  was  producing  sand.  Fig.  5.3  shows  a  surface  choke  that  failed
because of erosion. If the erosion is severe or occurs long enough, complete failure of surface
and/or downhole equipment may occur, resulting in critical safety and environmental problems
as well as deferred production.

5.2.4 Collapse  of  the  Formation.    Collapse  of  the  formation  around  the  well  occurs  when
large  volumes  of  sand  are  produced.  Apparently,  when  a  void  is  formed  and  becomes  large
enough to inadequately support overlying formations, collapse occurs because of a lack of ma-
terial  to  provide  support.  When  the  collapse  occurs,  the  sand  grains  rearrange  themselves  to
create  a  lower  permeability  than  originally  existed.  This  is  especially  true  for  formation  sand
that has a high clay content or wide range of grain sizes. For a formation with a narrow grain-
size  distribution  (well  sorted)  and/or  very  little  clay,  the  rearrangement  of  formation  sand
causes a decrease in permeability that is not as severe. In the case of the overlying shale col-
lapsing, complete loss of productivity is probable. In most cases, continued long-term produc-
tion of formation sand usually decreases the well’s productivity and ultimate recovery.

The collapse of the formation particularly becomes critical to well productivity if the forma-
tion material fills the perforation tunnels. Even a small amount of formation material filling the
perforation tunnels will lead to a significant increase in pressure drop across the formation near

the  wellbore  for  a  given  flow  rate.  Considering  these  consequences  of  sand  production,  the
desired solution to sand production is to control it downhole.

Compaction of the reservoir rock may occur as a result of reduced pore pressure leading to
surface subsidence. Examples of subsidence, caused by withdrawals of fluids and reduced pore
pressure, are found in Venezuela; Long Beach, California; the Gulf Coast of Texas; and in the
Ekofisk Field in the central North Sea, where the platforms sank about 10 ft.

5.3 Predicting Sand Production
Predicting  whether  a  well  will  produce  fluids  without  producing  sand  has  been  the  goal  of
many completion engineers and research projects. There are a number of analytical techniques
and  guidelines  to  assist  in  determining  if  sand  control  is  necessary,  but  no  technique  has
proven to be universally acceptable or completely accurate. In some geographic regions, guide-
lines  and  rules  of  thumb  apply  that  have  little  validity  in  other  areas  of  the  world.  At  the
current time, predicting whether a formation will or will not produce sand is not an exact sci-
ence, and more refinement is needed. Until better prediction techniques are available, the best
way  of  determining  the  need  for  sand  control  in  a  particular  well  is  to  perform  an  extended
production  test  with  a  conventional  completion  and  observe  whether  sand  production  occurs.
Normally, it is not necessary to predict sand production on a well-by-well basis because wells
in  the  same  reservoir  tend  to  behave  similarly.  The  prediction  required  is  on  a  reservoir-by-
reservoir  basis.  However,  initial  good  results  may  prove  misleading,  as  reservoir  and  flow
conditions change.

5.3.1 Operational and Economic Influences.  The difficulty of determining whether sand con-
trol is required in a given well is compounded when the well is drilled in a remote area where
there is no producing experience and where the various reservoir factors are slightly different
from  previously  exploited  regions.  Even  if  the  reservoir  and  formation  properties  are  almost
identical to other developments, the operating conditions and risks may be such that different
strategies  apply.  One  example  might  be  a  subsea  project,  as  opposed  to  a  land  development
project. Here, the consequences and risks associated with sand production are significantly dif-
ferent because of differing costs and risks associated with remedial well operations; hence, the
decision  to  use  a  sand-control  technique  is  both  an  economic  and  operational  decision  that
must be made with limited data. The decision is complicated by the fact that sand-control tech-

Chapter 5—Sand Control

IV-179

niques,  such  as  gravel  packing,  are  expensive  and  can  restrict  well  productivity  if  not  per-
formed  properly.  Therefore,  gravel  packing  cannot  be  applied  indiscriminately  when  the
possibility for sand production from a well is unknown. Making the decision whether to gravel
pack is fairly easy if the formation material is either hard (no sand production) or weak (sand
production).  The  difficulty  arises  when  the  strength  of  the  formation  material  is  marginal.  At
that point, the decision normally ceases to be primarily a technical issue but more of an eco-
nomic  and  risk  management  exercise.  If  there  is  uncertainty,  the  conservative  approach  is  to
always apply sand-control completions. This obviously will solve the sand production problem
but will also increase costs and may reduce well productivity. If sand control was actually un-
necessary, the implementation of sand-control completions was a bad economic decision.

5.3.2 Formation Strength.  The procedure followed by most, to consider whether sand control
is  required,  is  to  determine  the  hardness  of  the  formation  rock  (i.e.,  the  rock’s  compressive
strength).  Because  the  rock’s  compressive  strength  has  the  same  units  as  the  pressure  differ-
ence  between  the  reservoir  and  the  well  (the  drawdown),  the  two  parameters  can  be  directly
compared,  and  drawdown  limits  for  specific  wells  can  be  determined.  Research  performed  in
the early 1970s1 showed that rock failed and began to produce sand when the drawdown pres-
sure was more than about 1.7 times the compressive strength. As an example, formation sand
with  a  compressive  strength  of  1,000  psi  would  not  fail  or  begin  to  produce  sand  until  the
drawdown exceeded 1,700 psi. Others use Brinnell hardness as an indicator of whether to ap-
ply sand control. The Brinnell hardness of the rock is related to the compressive strength but is
not as convenient to use because the units of hardness are dimensionless and cannot be related
to drawdown as easily as compressive strength.

5.3.3 Sonic Log.  The sonic log can be used as a way of addressing the sand production poten-
tial  of  wells.  The  sonic  log  records  the  time  required  for  sound  waves  to  travel  through  the
formation, usually in microseconds. The porosity is related to formation strength and the sonic
travel  time.  Short  travel  times,  less  than  50  microseconds,  indicate  low  porosity  and  hard,
dense rock; long travel times, 95 microseconds or greater, are associated with soft, low-density,
high-porosity rock. A common technique used for determining whether sand control is required
in a given geologic area is to correlate incidences of sand production with the sonic log read-
ings  above  and  below  the  sand  production  that  has  been  observed.  This  establishes  a  quick
screening  method  for  the  need  for  sand  control.  The  use  of  this  method  requires  calibration
against particular geologic formations to be reliable.

5.3.4 Formation  Properties  Log.    Certain  well  logs,  such  as  the  sonic  log  (previously  dis-
cussed) and density and neutron devices are indicators of porosity and formation hardness. For
a particular formation, a low-density reading indicates high porosity. The neutron logs are pri-
marily an indicator of porosity. Several logging companies offer a formation properties log that
uses the results of the sonic, density, and neutron logs to determine if a formation will produce
formation  material  at  certain  levels  of  drawdown.  This  calculation  identifies  weak  and  strong
intervals; the weaker ones are more prone to produce sand. While the formation properties log
has  been  used  for  over  20  years,  experience  has  shown  that  this  log  usually  overpredicts  the
need for sand control.

5.3.5 Porosity.  The  porosity  of  a  formation  can  be  used  as  a  guideline  as  to  whether  sand
control is needed. If the formation porosity is greater than 30%, the probability of the need for
sand control is high because of the lack of cementation. Conversely, if the porosity is less than
20%, the need for sand control will probably be minimal because the sand has some consolida-
tion.  The  porosity  range  between  20  to  30%  is  where  uncertainty  usually  exists.  In  natural
media, porosity is related to the degree of cementation present in a formation; thus, the basis

IV-180

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

for  this  technique  is  understandable.  Porosity  information  can  be  derived  from  well  logs  or
laboratory core analysis.

5.3.6 Drawdown.  The pressure drawdown associated with production may be an indicator of
potential formation sand production. No sand production may occur with small pressure draw-
down  around  the  well,  whereas  excessive  drawdown  can  cause  the  formation  to  fail  and
produce sand at unacceptable levels. The amount of pressure drawdown is normally associated
with the formation permeability and the viscosity of the produced fluids. Low viscosity fluids,
such as gas, experience smaller drawdowns, as opposed to the drawdown that would be associ-
ated with a 1,000-cp fluid produced from the same interval. Hence, higher sand production is
usually associated with viscous fluids.

5.3.7 Finite Element Analysis.  The most sophisticated approach to predicting sand production
is the use of geomechanical numerical models developed to analyze fluid flow through the reser-
voir in relation to the formation strength. The effect of formation stress, associated with fluid
flow in the immediate region around the wellbore, is simultaneously computed with finite ele-
ment  analysis.  While  this  approach  is  by  far  the  most  rigorous,  it  requires  an  accurate
knowledge  of  the  formation’s  strength  around  the  well  in  both  the  elastic  and  plastic  regions
where  the  formation  begins  to  fail.  Input  data  on  both  regions  are  difficult  to  acquire  with  a
high  degree  of  accuracy  under  actual  downhole  conditions.  This  is  the  major  difficulty  with
this  approach.  The  finite  element  analysis  method  is  good  from  the  viewpoint  of  comparing
one  interval  with  another;  however,  the  absolute  values  calculated  may  not  represent  actual
formation behavior.

5.3.8 Time Dependence.  The effect of time on the production of formation sand is sometimes
considered to be an issue; however, there are no data that suggest that time alone is a factor.
There  have  been  undocumented  claims  that  produced  fluids  could  possibly  dissolve  the
formation’s natural cementing materials, but the data are not substantiated.

5.3.9 Multiphase Flow.  Predicting when multiphase fluid flow will begin can also be an aid.
Many  cases  can  be  cited  where  wells  produced  sand  free  until  water  production  began,  but
produced  unacceptable  amounts  afterwards.  The  reason  for  the  increased  sand  production  is
caused by two primary phenomena: the movement of water-wet fines and relative permeability
effects. Most formation fines are water wet and, as a consequence, immobile when a hydrocar-
bon  phase  is  the  sole  produced  fluid  because  hydrocarbons  occupy  the  majority  of  the  pore
space. However, when the water saturation is increased to the point that water becomes mobile,
the  formation  fines  begin  the  move  with  the  wetting  phase  (water),  which  creates  localized
plugging  in  the  pore  throats  of  the  porous  media.  Additionally,  when  two-phase  flow  occurs,
increased drawdown is experienced because two phases flowing together have more resistance
to flow than either fluid alone. These relative permeability effects can increase the drawdown
around the well by as much as a factor of 5 per unit of production. See the chapter that discuss-
es  relative  permeability  in  the  General  Engineering  section  of  this  Handbook.  The  result  of
fines migration, plugging, and reduced relative permeability around the well increases the draw-
down to the point that it may exceed the strength of the formation. The consequences can be
excessive sand production. The severity of fines migration varies from formation to formation
and whether gas or liquid is being produced.

5.4 Sand-Control Techniques
There  are  several  techniques  available  for  minimizing  sand  production  from  wells.  The  ques-
tion of which one to use arises. The choices range from simple changes in operating practices
to  expensive  completions,  such  as  sand  consolidation  or  gravel  packing.  The  sand-control

Chapter 5—Sand Control

IV-181

method selected depends on site-specific conditions, operating practices and economic consider-
ations.  Some  of  the  sand-control  techniques  available  are  maintenance  and  workover;  rate
exclusion;  selective  completion  practices;  plastic  consolidation;  high  energy  resin  placement;
resin coated gravel; stand-alone slotted liners or screens; and gravel packing.

5.4.1 Maintenance and Workover.  Maintenance and workover is a passive approach to sand
control. This method basically involves tolerating the sand production and dealing with its ef-
fects,  if  and  when  necessary.  Such  an  approach  requires  bailing,  washing,  and  cleaning  of
surface facilities routinely to maintain well productivity. It can be successful in specific forma-
tions  and  operating  environments.  The  maintenance  and  workover  method  is  primarily  used
where there is minimal sand production, low production rates, and an economically viable well
service.

5.4.2 Rate Restriction.  Restricting the well’s flow rate to a level that reduces sand production
is a method used occasionally. The point of the procedure is to sequentially reduce or increase
the flow rate until an acceptable value of sand production is achieved. The object of this tech-
nique is to attempt to establish the maximum sand-free flow rate. It is a trial-and-error method
that  may  have  to  be  repeated  as  the  reservoir  pressure,  flow  rate,  and  water  cut  change.  The
problem with rate restriction is that the maximum flow rate required to establish and maintain
sand  free  production  is  generally  less  than  the  flow  potential  of  the  well.  Compared  to  the
maximum rate, this may represent a significant loss in productivity and revenue.

5.4.3 Selective Completion Practices.  The goal of this technique is to produce only from sec-
tions  of  the  reservoir  that  are  capable  of  withstanding  the  anticipated  drawdown.  Perforating
only  the  higher  compressive  strength  sections  of  the  formation  allows  higher  drawdown.  The
high  compressive  strength  sections  will  likely  have  the  most  cementation  and,  unfortunately,
the lowest permeability. While this approach might eliminate the sand production, it is flawed
because the most valuable reserves will not be in communication with the well.

5.4.4 Plastic Consolidation.  Plastic  consolidation  involves  the  injection  of  plastic  resins  that
are attached to the formation sand grains. The resin subsequently hardens and forms a consoli-
dated mass, binding the sand grains together at their contact points. If successful, the increase
in formation compressive strength will be sufficient to withstand the drag forces while produc-
ing  at  the  desired  rates.  The  goal  of  these  treatments  is  to  consolidate  about  a  3-ft  radius
around the well without appreciably decreasing the permeability of the rock.

Three types of resins are commercially available: epoxies, furans (including furan/phenolic
blends),  and  phenolics.  The  resins  are  in  a  liquid  form  when  they  enter  the  formation,  and  a
catalyst  or  curing  agent  is  required  for  hardening.  Some  catalysts  are  “internal”  because  they
are mixed into the resin solution at the surface and require time and/or temperature to harden
the resin. Other catalysts are “external” and are injected after the resin is in place. The internal
catalysts have the advantage of positive placement because all resin will be in contact with the
catalyst  required  for  efficient  curing.  A  disadvantage  associated  with  internal  catalysts  is  the
possibility of premature hardening in the work string. The amounts of both resin and catalyst
must be carefully chosen and controlled for the specific well conditions. Epoxy and phenolics
can be placed with either internal or external catalysts; however, the rapid curing times of the
furans (and furan/phenolic blends) require that external catalysts be used.

There  are  two  types  of  plastic  consolidation  systems.  These  are  called  “phase  separation”
systems and “overflush” systems. Phase separation systems contain only 15 to 25% active resin
in  an  otherwise  inert  solution.  The  resin  is  preferentially  attracted  to  the  sand  grains,  leaving
the inert portion that will not otherwise affect the pore spaces. These systems use an internal

IV-182

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

catalyst. Accurate control of the plastic placement is critical because overdisplacement will re-
sult in unconsolidated sand in the critical near-wellbore area.

Phase  separation  consolidation  may  be  ineffective  in  formations  that  contain  more  than
10% clays. Clays, which also attract the resin, have extremely high surface area in comparison
to sands. The clays will attract more resin and because phase separation systems contain only a
small percentage of resin, there may not be enough resin to consolidate the sand grains.

Overflush systems contain a high percentage of active resin. When first injected, the pore
spaces  are  completely  filled  with  resin,  and  an  overflush  is  required  to  push  the  excess  resin
away from the wellbore area to re-establish permeability. Only a residual amount of resin satu-
ration,  which  should  be  concentrated  at  the  sand  contact  points,  should  remain  following  the
overflush.  Most  overflush  systems  use  an  external  catalyst,  although  some  include  an  internal
catalyst.

All plastic consolidations require a good primary cement job to prevent the resin from chan-
neling  behind  the  casing.  Perforation  density  should  be  a  minimum  of  four  shots  per  foot  to
reduce  drawdown  and  improve  the  distribution  of  plastic;  however,  each  perforation  must  be
treated. Shaley zones should not be perforated because fluids are difficult to place in these low-
permeability  strata.  Clean  fluids  are  essential  for  plastic  consolidation  treatments  because  all
solids that are in the system at the time of treatment will be “glued” in place. The perforations
should be washed or surged, workover rig tanks should be scrubbed, and fluids should be fil-
tered to 2 microns. Work strings should be cleaned with a dilute HCl acid containing sequester-
ing agents, and pipe dope should be used sparingly on the pin only. A matrix acid treatment,
which includes HF and HCl, is recommended for dirty sandstones to increase injectivity.

Both phase separation and overflush systems require a multistage preflush to remove reser-
voir  fluids  and  make  the  sand  grain  oil  wet.  The  first  stage,  generally  diesel  oil,  serves  to
displace the reservoir oil. Epoxy resins are incompatible with water; therefore, isopropyl alco-
hol  follows  the  diesel  to  remove  formation  water.  The  final  stage  is  a  spacer  (brine)  that
prevents the isopropyl alcohol from contacting the resin.

Plastic  consolidation  leaves  the  wellbore  fully  open.  This  becomes  important  where  large
OD  downhole  completion  equipment  is  required.  Also,  plastic  consolidation  can  be  done
through tubing or in wells with small-diameter casing. For most applications, the problems as-
sociated  with  plastic  consolidation  outweigh  the  possible  advantages.  The  permeability  of  a
formation is always decreased by plastic consolidation. Even in successful treatments, the per-
meability to oil is reduced because the resin occupies a portion of the original pore space and
is oil wet. The amount of resin used is based on uniform coverage of all perforations. Howev-
er, perforation plugging or permeability variations often cause some perforations to take more
plastic  than  others.  In  systems  that  use  an  external  catalyst,  there  is  no  sand  control  in  areas
that are not contacted by both resin and catalyst.

The primary difficulty in using resin systems is attaining complete and even placement of
the chemicals in the formation. In lenticular formations, plastic placement may be uneven be-
cause  of  widely  varying  permeabilities,  and  some  zones  are  likely  to  be  untreated.  These
untreated intervals may break down during subsequent production, and the well will sand up.
For  this  reason,  plastic  consolidation  is  suitable  for  interval  lengths  less  than  10  to  15  ft.
Longer intervals can be treated using packers to isolate and treat small sections of the zone at
a  time,  but  such  operations  are  difficult  and  time  consuming.  Plastic  consolidation  treatments
also do not perform well in formations with permeabilities less than about 50 md. Low perme-
abilities preclude injecting resins under matrix conditions and cause permeability reductions by
the  plastic  that  substantially  reduce  residual  permeability  (i.e.,  well  productivity).  The  resins
soften at a temperature greater than 255°F and may not provide sufficient strength at elevated
temperature.

Plastic  consolidation  was  used  extensively  in  the  late  1950s  through  the  mid-1970s  in  the
Gulf of Mexico; however, this technique currently represents far less than 1% of all sand-con-
trol  completions  worldwide.  The  reasons  for  decreased  usage  include  lack  of  suitable  candi-
dates, the placement difficulties already described, as well as tight regulations on the handling
of the chemicals, which are generally quite toxic (with the furans being the least toxic of the
three). These treatments tend to be costly. The main disadvantage of plastic systems in current
operations is its high cost and limited completion interval length for an effective treatment, 15
ft or less. The latter excludes most wells. Because of its current limited use, service companies
have difficulty maintaining trained crews.

5.4.5 High-Energy Resin Placement.  As  previously  discussed,  one  of  the  main  reasons  for
the lack of acceptance of chemical consolidation techniques has been difficulties in placing the
resin  uniformly  across  the  entire  target  interval  and  restricted  length.  The  uneven  coverage  is
more severe in intervals greater than about 15 ft long. Causes for this are typically attributed to
differences in injectivity caused by incomplete perforation clean-up during underbalanced perfo-
rating  jobs  or  permeability  variations  in  the  formation  interval  length.  See  the  chapter  that
discusses  under-  and  overbalanced  drilling  in  the  Drilling  Engineering  section  of  this  Hand-
book.  Also  see  the  chapter  in  the  Production  Operations  Engineering  section  that  discusses
underbalanced perforating.

High-energy resin placement addresses some of these problems.2,3 The technique injects the
resin  rapidly  under  highly  overbalanced  conditions.  The  resin  is  surged  into  the  formation  at
rates that will place the resin before the formation has a chance to fail. Another benefit to the
rapid resin placement is that the technique appears to be less affected by permeability contrasts
than  the  matrix  treatments.  This  characteristic  leads  to  more  uniform  placement  over  a  long
perforated interval. This method is still experimental.

Three methods are available for creating the high overbalance pressures that can assist resin
placement—propellant gas fracturing, overbalanced perforating, and overbalanced surging. The
overbalanced perforating method is currently the preferred method.

Propellant Gas Fracturing.  The use of propellant gas fracturing tools involves the conver-
sion of solid propellant by chemical reaction into a gas in the target zone of a wellbore. The
chemical  propellant  is  changed  into  combustion  gases  by  one  of  two  different  mechanisms:
detonation or flame propagation. Detonation involves a reaction characterized by a shock wave
that moves rapidly through the interval to be treated. This shock wave, traveling at velocities
between  15,000  and  25,000  ft/sec,  induces  pressures  ranging  from  400  to  4,000,000  psi,  with
pressurization rates up to 100,000 psi. The high-pressure surge places the resin more evenly in
long formation intervals where conventional plastic consolidation, pumped at matrix, is imprac-
tical.

The  reaction  products  are  contained  in  place  by  the  liquid  column  in  the  wellbore  above
the tool. The rapid generation of gas forces the resin placed in the annular space surrounding
the tool out of the perforations and into the formation. For this process, the casing must be in
good condition and properly cemented to be successful. Perforations must be clean and clear of
debris, and all debris should be removed from the wellbore. Only clean sands should be perfo-
rated.  Finally,  if  sand  has  been  produced,  the  perforations  should  be  prepacked  with  gravel
prior to the treatment, which may be difficult.

The process involved in this type of a treatment is to first inject a preflush of mutual sol-
vent  to  remove  water  from  the  target  interval.  Furan  resin  is  then  placed  across  the  perfora-
tions,  and  the  gas-generating  propellant  tool  is  placed  across  the  entire  perforated  interval.
Nitrogen overbalance is applied to the work string, and the propellant device is fired to inject
resin above fracture pressure. The resin is then followed with an acid post-flush to harden the
resin.

IV-184

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

An  advantage  to  this  system  is  that  resin  will  be  placed  in  all  perforations  immediately
across from the location of the gas generator tool. However, if multiple tool runs are required
to treat an interval longer than about 36 ft, movement of the tool will make it difficult to hold
the resin in position. The two other methods, overbalanced perforating and overbalanced surg-
ing, are designed to alleviate the problem of maintaining the resin in position.

Overbalanced Perforating or Surging.  High-overbalanced perforating resin placement may
be used if the well has not been previously perforated. If a well has existing perforations, the
interval can be prepacked, and then the resin can be placed with a high-pressure surge.

The composition of the resin solution is furfuryl alcohol resin solvent, a coupling and wet-
ting  agent.  The  resin  catalyzes  with  an  acid  to  form  a  furan  plastic.  The  resin  solution  is
positioned across an interval of planned perforations. A more dense fluid may proceed below
the resin to fill a portion of the wellbore below the zone of interest. A lower density fluid may
follow  above  the  resin  in  the  wellbore  to  keep  the  resin  from  floating  up  above  the  zone  of
interest. This technique can ensure more accurate placement of resin across the soon to be per-
forated interval. Operationally, the pressure in the wellbore fluid, at the depth to be perforated,
is increased to a substantially greater level than the pore pressure in the formation. The applied
pressure  before  perforating  may  be  higher  than  the  formation  fracturing  pressure.  Wireline
through tubing or casing guns, or tubing conveyed perforating, can all be used for perforating.
Resin  is  forced  into  the  new  perforations  upon  perforating  with  the  overbalanced  pressure.
Acid is injected into the perforations to convert the liquid resin into a strong plastic that will
consolidate the sand.

While the high-energy resin placement techniques offer an advantage over conventional ma-
trix  plastic  consolidation  methods,  they  are  not  widely  used,  and  this  system  is  plagued  by
many of the disadvantages of plastic consolidation—high cost, low success, and lack of longevi-
ty. The results of high-energy plastic treatments generally have tended to be disappointing.

5.4.6 Resin-Coated Gravel.  Resin-coated  gravel  treatments  can  be  pumped  in  two  different
ways. The first is a dry, partially catalyzed phenolic resin-coated gravel. Thin resin coating is
about 5% of the total weight of the sand. When exposed to heat, the resin cures, resulting in a
consolidated  sand  mass.  The  use  of  resin-coated  gravel  as  a  sand-control  technique  involves
pumping the gravel into the well to completely fill the perforations and casing. The bottomhole
temperature  of  the  well,  or  injection  of  steam,  causes  the  resin  to  complete  the  cure  into  a
consolidated  pack.  After  curing,  the  consolidated  gravel-pack  sand  can  be  drilled  out  of  the
casing, leaving the resin-coated gravel in the perforations. The remaining consolidated gravel in
the  perforations  acts  as  a  permeable  filter  to  prevent  the  production  of  formation  sand.  The
main use of resin-coated gravel is in prepacked screens, which is discussed later.

Wet resins (epoxies or furans) can also be used. To pump these systems, the well is usually
prepacked  with  gravel;  then,  the  resin  is  pumped  and  catalyzed  to  harden  the  plastic.  After
curing, the consolidated plastic-sand mixture is drilled out of the well, leaving the resin-coated
sand in the perforations.

Although simple in concept, using resin-coated gravel can be complex. First, and most im-
portant, a successful job requires that all perforations be completely filled with the resin-coated
gravel,  and  the  gravel  must  cure.  Complete  filling  of  the  perforations  becomes  increasingly
difficult,  as  zone  length  and  deviation  from  vertical  increase.  Second,  the  resin-coated  gravel
must cure with sufficient compressive strength. While resin-coated systems were used extensive-
ly  after  their  development,  their  use  today  is  limited.  Experience  with  them  has  shown  good
initial success but poor longevity, as most wells do not produce sand-free for extended periods
of time.

5.4.7 Stand-Alone Slotted Liners or Screens.  Slotted liners or screens have been used as the
sole means of controlling formation sand production. In this service, they function as a filter.

Chapter 5—Sand Control

IV-185

Unless the formation is a well-sorted, clean sand with a large grain size, this type of comple-
tion  may  have  an  unacceptably  short  producing  life  before  the  slotted  liner  or  screen  plugs
with  formation  material.  When  used  alone  as  sand  exclusion  devices,  the  slotted  liners  or
screens are placed across the productive interval, and the formation sand mechanically bridges
on the slots or openings in the wire-wrapped screen. Bridging theory and laboratory tests show
that  particles  will  bridge  on  a  slot,  provided  the  width  of  the  slot  is  less  than  two  particle
diameters.  Likewise,  particles  will  bridge  against  a  hole  if  the  perforation  diameter  does  not
exceed about three particle diameters.

The slot width, or the screen gauge, is sometimes sized to be equal to the formation sand
grain size at the 10-percentile point of the sieve analysis. The theory is that because the larger
10% of the sand grains will be stopped by the openings of the screen, the larger sand will stop
the  remaining  90%  of  the  formation.  The  bridges  formed  will  not  be  stable  and  may  break
down from time to time when the producing rate is changed or the well is shut in. Because the
bridges  can  fail  or  break  down,  resorting  of  the  formation  sand  can  occur,  which,  over  time,
tends to result in plugging of the slotted liner or screen. This design fails for fine-grained sand
formations because the slot width is smaller than those available for commercial slotted liners.
Wire-wrapped screens can meet the design, but their width is so small that plugging and pro-
duction  reduction  is  virtually  assured.  When  this  technique  is  used  to  control  formation  sand,
the slotted liner or screen diameter should be as large as possible to maximize inflow area and
minimize the amount of resorting that can occur. Another potential disadvantage of both slotted
liners and screens in high-rate wells is the possibility of erosional failure of the slotted liner or
screen before a bridge can form.

Using a slotted liner or screen without gravel packing is generally not a good sand-control
technique because, in most cases, the screen will eventually restrict well rates because of plug-
ging. There are isolated situations where this use has been successful in openhole completions
in  high-permeability,  well-sorted  formations.  Selected  North  Sea  wells  have  performed  well.
Screens or slotted liners should be avoided in cased-hole completions as the sole sand-control
technique because, when the annulus and perforations become filled with formation sand, pro-
duction rates decrease drastically.

5.4.8 Gravel Packing.  Gravel  packing  consists  of  placing  a  screen  or  slotted  liner  in  a  well
opposite the completion interval and placing gravel concentrically around it. The gravel is actu-
ally  large-grained  sand  that  prevents  sand  production  from  the  formation  but  allows  fluids  to
flow  into  the  well.  The  slotted  liner  or  screen  retains  the  gravel.  The  gravel  is  sized  to  be
about 5 to 6 times larger than the median formation sand size. Gravel packing creates a perme-
able  downhole  filter  that  allows  the  production  of  the  formation  fluids  but  restricts  the  entry
and  production  of  formation  sand.  Schematics  of  an  openhole  and  cased-hole  gravel  pack  are
shown  in  Fig.  5.4.  If  the  gravel  is  tightly  packed  between  the  formation  and  the  screen,  the
bridges formed are stable, which prevents shifting and resorting of the formation sand. If prop-
erly designed and executed, a gravel pack will maintain its permeability under a broad range of
producing conditions.

Gravel  packing  is  currently  the  most  widely  used  sand-control  technique  for  completing
wells. More than 90% of all sand-control completions are gravel packs. Because of its flexibili-
ty,  almost  any  well  at  any  deviation  can  be  gravel  packed.  The  exception  is  tubingless
completions  where  clearances  do  not  permit  the  use  of  conventional  tools.  Some  tubingless
completion gravel packs have been performed, but their success was poor.

5.4.9 Guidelines for Selecting Sand Control.  There  are  many  alternatives  for  sand  control.
Each  alternative  has  its  advantages  and  disadvantages.  Even  techniques  that  are  not  widely
used  may  have  a  potential  application  in  which  its  use  might  be  superior  to  others.  As  men-
tioned before,  gravel packing is  currently the  most  widely  used  technique. The  cost  to  gravel

IV-186

pack is directly related to rig costs. Gravel-packed completions from floating drilling rigs may
cost in excess of U.S. $2 million. However, should remedial operations be required on a gravel
pack,  the  screen  and  completion  assembly  must  be  removed  from  the  well,  which  could  in-
volve a lengthy fishing job and related problems. Sand consolidation and resin-coated sand are
attractive for tubingless completions because no mechanical equipment is left in the hole; how-
ever,  low  permeability,  small-interval  length,  high  temperatures,  and  completion  longevity
(wells sanded up or low productivity) all present problems with the plastic systems. The right
technique  must  be  selected  for  the  well  completion  at  hand.  As  a  first  approach,  assume  that
the well will be gravel packed. If it is not appropriate, for whatever reason, review other alter-
natives.

5.5 Gravel-Pack Design
A gravel pack is simply a downhole filter designed to prevent the production of unwanted for-
mation  sand.  The  formation  sand  is  held  in  place  by  properly  sized  gravel  pack  sand  that,  in
turn, is held in place with a properly-sized screen. To determine what size gravel-pack sand is
required, samples of the formation sand must be evaluated to determine the median grain size
diameter and grain size distribution.4 The quality of the sand used is as important as the proper
sizing. The American Petroleum Institute (API) has set forth the minimum specifications desir-
able for gravel-pack sand in API RP58, Testing Sand Used in Gravel-Packing Operations.5

5.5.1 Formation Sand Sampling.  The first step in gravel-pack design is to obtain a represen-
tative  sample  of  the  formation.  Failure  to  analyze  a  representative  sample  can  lead  to  gravel
packs that fail because of plugging or the production of sand. Because the formation sand size
is so important, the technique used to obtain a formation sample requires attention. With knowl-
edge of the different sampling techniques, compensation can be made in the gravel-pack sand
size selection, if necessary.

Chapter 5—Sand Control

IV-187

Produced Samples.  A produced sample of the formation sand is easily contaminated before
it  reaches  the  surface.  Although  such  a  sample  can  be  analyzed  and  used  for  the  gravel-pack
sand size determination, produced samples will probably have a smaller median grain size than
the median of actual formation sand. The well’s flow rate, produced fluid characteristics, and
completion tubular design influence whether a particular size is produced to surface or settles
to  the  bottom  of  the  well.  In  many  cases,  the  larger  sand  grains  settle,  so  a  sample  that  is
produced  to  the  surface  has  a  higher  proportion  of  the  smaller-size  sand  grains.  This  is  the
reason  that  the  surface  sample  is  not  a  good  representation  of  the  various  sizes  of  formation
sand. Also, the transport of sand grains, through the production tubing and surface flow lines,
may result in broken sand grains, causing the presence of more fine and smaller grains.

Bailed Samples.  Samples  collected  from  the  bottom  of  a  well  using  wireline  bailers  are
also  relatively  easy  to  obtain,  but  these  too  are  probably  unrepresentative  of  the  size  of  the
actual formation sand. Bailed samples are generally biased to the larger-size sand grains, assum-
ing  that  more  of  the  smaller  grains  are  produced  to  surface.  Bailed  samples  also  may  be
misleading in terms of grain size distribution. When closing the well in to obtain a sample, the
larger sand grains settle to the bottom of the well first, and the smaller sand grains fall on top
of the larger ones. This results in a sorting of the formation sand grains into a sample that is
not  representative  the  formation  sand.  The  use  of  bailed  samples  may  result  in  the  design  of
larger than required gravel-pack sand that can result in sand production (small formation parti-
cles passing through the gravel pack) or plugging of the gravel pack (small formation particles
filling the spaces between the gravel-pack sand grains).

Sidewall Core Samples.  Sidewall core samples are obtained by shooting hollow projectiles
from  a  gun  lowered  into  the  well  on  an  electric  line  to  the  desired  depth.  The  projectiles  re-
main attached to the gun with steel cables, so that when the gun is pulled from the well, the
projectiles are retrieved with a small formation sample inside. Taking sidewall core samples is
generally included in the evaluation stages of wells in unconsolidated formations; these are the
most widely used sample types for gravel-pack sand design. Although more representative than
produced or bailed samples, sidewall core samples can also give imprecise results because the
volume in each sidewall sample is small. When the projectiles strike the face of the formation,
localized  crushing  of  the  sand  grains  occurs,  producing  broken  sand  grains  and  generating
more fine particles. The core sample also contains drilling mud solids that can be mistaken for
formation  material.  Experienced  lab  analysts  can  separate  the  effects  of  crushing  and  mud
solids prior to evaluating the sample, thus improving the quality of the results.

Conventional Core Samples.   The  most  representative  formation  sample  is  obtained  from
conventional cores. In the case of unconsolidated formations, rubber sleeve conventional cores
may be required to assure sample recovery. Although conventional cores are the most desirable
formation  sample,  they  are  not  readily  available  in  many  wells  because  of  the  cost  of  coring
operations.  Coring  in  sand-producing  formations  is  also  plagued  with  poor  recovery.  If  avail-
able,  small  plugs  can  be  taken  under  controlled  circumstances  at  various  sections  of  the  core
for a complete and accurate median formation grain size and grain-size distribution determination.
Other Samples.  From time to time, operators have no formation sample. In this event, rely
on any of the samples from offset wells. If the formation of interest has gravel-pack comple-
tions  in  nearby  fields,  rely  on  these.  If  there  is  still  no  information,  select  a  relatively  small
gravel that will control most formation sand, or consult an expert.

5.5.2 Sieve Analysis.  A sieve analysis is a laboratory routine performed on a formation sand
sample for the selection of the proper-sized gravel-pack sand. A sieve analysis consists of plac-
ing a formation sample at the top of a series of screens that have progressively smaller mesh
sizes  downwards  in  the  sieve  stack.  After  placing  the  sieve  stack  in  a  vibrating  machine,  the
sand  grains  in  the  sample  will  fall  through  the  screens  until  encountering  a  screen  through
which  certain  grain  sizes  cannot  pass  because  the  openings  in  the  screen  are  too  small.  By

IV-188

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 5.5—Sand size distribution plot from sieve analysis.1

weighing  the  screens  before  and  after  sieving,  the  weight  of  formation  sample,  retained  by
each  size  screen,  can  be  determined.  The  cumulative  weight  percent  of  each  sample  retained
can be plotted as a comparison of screen mesh size on semilog coordinates to obtain a sand size-
distribution plot, as shown in Fig. 5.5. Reading the graph at the 50% cumulative weight gives
the median formation grain size diameter. This grain size, often referred to as d50, is the basis
of gravel-pack sand size-selection procedures. Table 5.1 provides a reference for mesh size vs.
sieve opening.

Chapter 5—Sand Control

IV-189

If  possible,  a  sample  should  be  taken  every  2  to  3  ft  within  the  formation,  or  at  least  at
every lithology change. The minimum size of the formation sample required for sieve analysis
is 15 cm3. Sieving can be performed either wet or dry. In dry sieving (the most common tech-
nique), the sample is prepared by removing the fines (i.e., clays) and drying the sample in an
oven.  If  necessary,  the  sample  is  ground  with  a  mortar  and  pestle  to  ensure  individual  grains
are sieved rather than conglomerated grains. The sample is then placed in the sieving apparatus
that uses mechanical vibration to assist the particles in moving through and on to the various
mesh screens. Wet sieving is used when the formation sample has extremely small grain sizes.
In  wet  sieving,  water  is  poured  over  the  sample  while  sieving  to  ensure  that  the  particles  do
not cling together.

5.5.3 Gravel-Pack Sand Sizing.  There have been several published techniques for selecting a
gravel-pack sand size to control the production of formation sand. The most widely used sizing
criterion4 provides sand control when the median grain size of the gravel-pack sand, D50, is no
more  than  six  times  larger  than  the  median  grain  size  of  the  formation  sand,  d50.  The  upper
case  D  refers  to  the  gravel,  while  the  lower  case  refers  to  the  formation  sand.  The  basis  for
this relationship was a series of core flow experiments in which half the core consisted of gravel-
pack sand and the other half was formation sand. The ratio of median grain size of the gravel-
pack sand and median grain size of the formation sand was changed over a range from 2 to 10
to determine when optimum sand control was achieved.

The experimental procedure consisted of measuring the pack permeability with each change
in  gravel  size  and  comparing  it  to  the  initial  permeability.  If  the  final  permeability  was  the
same as the initial permeability, it was concluded that effective sand control was achieved with
no adverse productivity effects. If the final permeability was less than the initial permeability,
the formation sand was invading and plugging the gravel-pack sand. In this situation, sand con-
trol may be achieved, but at the expense of well productivity. Fig. 5.6 illustrates the results of
core flow experiments for a particular gravel/sand combination. As shown in the plot, the per-
meability of the pack increases up to a median gravel/sand size ratio of 6 but decreases as the
ratio  increases  further.  The  permeability  decreases  to  a  minimum  as  a  10:12  ratio  is  reached;
then, it increases. The explanation for this behavior is that the permeability increases as the gravel/
sand size ratio increases up to a ratio of about 6, which reflects the increasing permeability of
the larger gravel (i.e., at a gravel/sand ratio of one, the gravel is the same size as the formation
sand). At a gravel/sand size ratio of 6, the formation sand grains bridge on, rather than into the
pore structure of the gravel, which is the correct gravel size that provides the highest permeabil-
ity. However, as the gravel size becomes larger and the ratio increases, the formation begins to
bridge  within  the  pore  structure of  the  gravel, thereby decreasing the  pack  permeability. At  a
ratio of 10:12, the formation sand has moved well into the pores, decreasing the permeability
substantially. As the gravel becomes larger, a reversal occurs because now the formation sand
can move both into and through the pore structure of the gravel. At ratios in excess of 15, the
formation  sand  can  flow  through  the  gravel  with  ease.  As  Fig.  5.6  indicates,  at  gravel/sand
ratios less than 10:12, there is sand control, whereas at ratios larger than 12, there is no sand
control.

In practice, the proper gravel-pack sand size is selected by multiplying the median size of
the formation sand by 4 to 8 to achieve a gravel-pack sand size range, in which the average is
six  times  larger  than  the  median  grain  size  of  the  formation  sand.  Hence,  the  gravel  pack  is
designed  to  control  the  load-bearing  material;  no  attempt  is  made  to  control  formation  fines
that  make  up  less  2  to  3%  of  the  formation.  This  calculated  gravel-pack  sand  size  range  is
compared to the available commercial grades of gravel-pack sand. Select the available gravel-
pack  sand  that  matches  the  calculated  gravel-pack  size  range.  In  the  event  that  the  calculated
gravel-pack  sand  size  range  falls  between  the  size  ranges  of  commercially  available  gravel-

pack sand, select the smaller gravel-pack sand. Table 5.2 contains information on commercial-
ly available gravel-pack sand sizes.

Note that this technique is based solely on the median grain size of the formation sand with
no consideration given to the range of sand grain diameters or degree of sorting present in the
formation. The sieve analysis plot, discussed earlier, can be used to obtain the degree of sort-
ing in a particular formation sample. A near vertical sieve analysis plot represents good sorting
(most  of  the  formation  sand  is  in  a  very  narrow  size  range)  vs.  a  highly  sloping  plot,  which
indicates poorer sorting as illustrated by curves “A” and “D,” respectively, in Fig. 5.5. A sort-
ing factor, or uniformity coefficient, can be calculated as

Cμ =

d40
d90

where

Cμ = sorting factor or uniformity coefficient,
d40 = grain size at the 40% cumulative level from sieve analysis plot,

and

d90 = grain size at the 90% cumulative level from sieve analysis plot.
If Cμ is less than 3, the sand is considered well sorted (uniform); from 3 to 5, it is nonuni-

form, and if greater than 5, it is highly nonuniform.

5.5.4 Gravel-Pack Sand.  The productivity of a gravel-packed well depends on the permeabili-
ty  of  the  gravel-pack  sand  and  how  it  is  placed.  To  ensure  maximum  well  productivity,  one
should  use  high  quality  gravel-pack  sand.  API  RP58,  Testing  Sand  Used  in  Gravel  Packing
Operations,  establishes  rigid  specifications  for  acceptable  properties  of  sands  used  for  gravel
packing.  These  specifications  focus  on  ensuring  the  maximum  permeability  and  longevity  of
the sand under typical well production and treatment conditions. The specifications define mini-
mum  acceptable  standards  for  the  size  and  shape  of  the  grains,  the  amount  of  fines  and
impurities, acid solubility, and crush resistance. Only a few naturally occurring sands are capa-
ble of meeting the API specifications without excessive processing. These sands are character-
ized  by  their  high  quartz  content  and  consistency  in  grain  size.  Table  5.3  gives  the
permeability of  common gravel-pack sand  sizes  conforming to  API  RP58, Testing Sand Used
in Gravel Packing Operations, specifications (data from Refs. 6, 7, and 8).

Once the sieve analysis has been performed and plotted, the remainder of the gravel-pack
sizing  can  be  performed  graphically.  The  gravel-pack  sand  size  is  determined  by  multiplying
the  median  formation  grain  size  by  6.  This  value  is  the  median  gravel  grain  size.  With  a
straight edge, construct the gravel curve so that its uniformity coefficient, Cμ, is 1.5. The actual
gravel  size  can  be  determined  by  the  intercept  of  gravel  curve  with  the  0  and  100  percentile
values.  Select  to  the  nearest  standard  gravel  size.  The  screen  slot  width  is  typically  half  the
smallest gravel size selected but should not exceed 70% of the smallest grain diameter. While
it  may  appear  that  this  design  is  conservative,  it  will  not  restrict  productivity  and  allows  for
variances  in  screen  tolerances.  The  diameter  of  the  screen  should  allow  for  at  least  0.75-in.
clearance from the casing inside diameter (ID). Fig. 5.7 is an example gravel-pack design.

5.5.5 Gravel-Pack  Sand  Substitutes.    Although  naturally  occurring  quartz  sand  is  the  most
common gravel-pack material, many alternatives exist. These include: resin-coated sand, garnet,
glass  beads,  and  aluminum  oxides.  Each  of  these  materials  offers  specific  properties  that  are
beneficial for given applications and well conditions. The cost of the materials ranges from 2
to 3 times the price of common quartz sand.

5.6 Slotted Liners and Wire-Wrapped Screens
The  slotted  liner  or  screen  is  the  mechanical  device  that  contains  the  gravel-pack  sand  in  an
annular  ring  between  it  and  the  casing  wall  or  open  hole.  Fig.  5.8  shows  a  schematic  of  its
function in an openhole gravel pack.

5.6.1 Slotted Liners.  Slotted liners are made from tubulars by saw-cutting slot configurations,
as shown in Fig. 5.9. Slot widths are often referred to in terms of gauge. Slot or screen gauge
is  simply  the  width  of  the  opening  in  inches  multiplied  by  1,000.  For  instance,  a  12-gauge
screen has openings of 0.012 in.

The machining consists of cutting rectangular openings with small rotary saws. Routine slot
widths are 0.030 in. or larger. The minimum slot width that can be achieved is about 0.012 in.
Slots  that  cut  less  than  0.020  in.  in  width  involve  high  costs  because  of  excessive  machine
downtime to replace broken saw blades that overheat, warp, and break.

The single-slot staggered, longitudinal pattern is generally preferred because the strength of
the unslotted pipe is preserved. The staggered pattern also gives a more uniform distribution of
slots over the surface area of the pipe. The single-slot staggered pattern is slotted with an even
number of rows around the pipe with a typical 6-in. longitudinal spacing of slot rows.

Fig. 5.10—Straight and keystone-shaped slots (courtesy of Baker Oil Tools).

The slots can be straight or keystone shaped, as illustrated in Fig. 5.10. The keystone slot
is narrower on the outside surface of the pipe than on the inside. Slots formed in this way have
an inverted “V” cross-sectional area and are less prone to plugging because any particle pass-
ing  through  the  slot  at  the  outside  diameter  (OD)  of  the  pipe  will  continue  to  flow  through,
rather  than  lodging  within  the  slot.  While  the  slotted  liners  are  usually  less  costly  than  wire-
wrapped  screens,  they  have  smaller  inflow  areas  and  experience  higher  pressure  drops  during
production. Slotted liners also plug more readily than screens; they are used where well produc-
tivity is small and economics cannot support the use of screens.

IV-194

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 5.11—Comparison of effective inlet areas (20-gauge screen).1

The length of the individual slots is measured on the ID of the pipe. Usual practice dictates
1½-in.  long  slots  for  slot  widths  of  0.030  in.  and  under,  2-in.  long  slots  for  slot  widths  be-
tween  0.030  to  0.060  in.,  and  2½-in.  long  slots  for  slot  widths  of  0.060  in.  and  larger.  Slot
width tolerance is generally ± 0.003 in. for widths of 0.040 in. and wider and ± 0.002 in. for
widths less than 0.040 in.

The primary advantage of a slotted liner over wire-wrapped screens is usually cost; howev-
er,  small  gauge,  high-density  slot  patterns  may  cost  as  much  as  wire-wrapped  screens.  The
disadvantages  of  the  slotted  liner  are  limited  flow  area  (2  to  3%,  creating  a  low  tolerance  to
plugging) and minimum available slot size (approximately 0.012 in.). Slot widths that are less
than  0.020  in.  and  cut  in  standard  carbon  steel-pipe  grades  can  rust  and  will  either  close  or
reconfigure the slot opening so that they do not function properly unless they are coated, pro-
tected, or stored indoors before use.

5.6.2 Wire-Wrapped  Screens.    Wire-wrapped  screens  offer  another  alternative  for  retaining
the gravel in an annular ring between the screen and the formation. Wire-wrapped screens have
substantially more inflow area than a slotted liner, as Fig. 5.11 illustrates. The screen consists
of  an  outer  jacket  that  is  fabricated  on  special  wrapping  machines  that  resemble  a  lathe.  The
shaped wire is simultaneously wrapped and welded to longitudinal rods to form a single helical
slot with any desired width. The jacket is subsequently placed over and welded at each end to
a supporting pipe base (containing drilled holes) to provide structural support. This is a standard-
commodity design manufactured by several companies. A schematic of the screen construction
is shown in Fig. 5.12. Screen tolerances are typically plus 0.001 and minus 0.002 in.; hence, a
specified 0.006-in. slot could vary in slot width from 0.004 to 0.007 in.

Because these designs have been used for more than 40 years in worldwide oilfield opera-
tions, a great deal is known about the performance of wire-wrapped screens. The typical pipe-
base screen fabrication consists of a grade 316L stainless steel jacket placed over a N-80 pipe
base; however, other metals can be specified as required for site-specific applications. The in-
flow  area  of  screens  varies  from  about  6  to  12%  (or  higher),  depending  on  the  slot  opening.
Screens with the smallest slot openings are typically 6 gauge (0.006 in.). For large gravel, 10
to 20 mesh, screen slot openings are about 18 gauge (0.018 in.).

A  version  of  the  wire-wrapped  screen  is  the  rod-based  screen  that  consists  of  the  jacket
only;  however,  rod-based  screens  may  have  additional  heavier  rods  and  a  heavier  wire  wrap
than  the  jackets  used  on  pipe-base  screens  to  provide  additional  strength.  Rod-based  screens
are commonly used in shallow water-well completions that typically range from a few hundred
to  maybe  a  1,000  ft  in  depth.  Hence,  they  do  not  require  the  strength  that  is  gained  by  in-
stalling  the  screen  jacket  over  a  pipe  base.  Screen  diameters  range  from  1.5  to  7  in.  in

Chapter 5—Sand Control

diameter (or larger). This is the diameter of the pipe base. The actual screen diameter is slight-
ly larger (i.e., the actual OD of a 3.5-in. screen is about 4 in.).

5.6.3 Prepacked Screens.  Prepacked screens are a modification of wire-wrapped screens; they
actually  represent  a  modular  gravel  pack.  They  consist  of  a  standard  screen  assembly  with  a
layer of resin-coated gravel (consolidated) placed around it that is contained in an annular ring
supported  by  a  second  screen  (dual-screen  prepack)  or  outer  shroud  (single-screen  prepack).
The resin coating is a partially cured phenolic plastic. Being dry, the resin-coated gravel can be
handled like ordinary gravel. After prepacking the screen, the complete unit is heated to cure
and  harden  the  resin.  The  thickness  of  the  gravel  layer  can  be  varied  to  meet  special  needs.
The screens with the lowest profiles are those that contain an annular pack between the jacket
and  the  pipe  base.  This  screen  has  a  thin  lattice  screen  wrapped  around  it  to  prevent  gravel
from  flowing  through  the  drill  holes  in  the  pipe  base  before  consolidation.  Examples  of
prepacked  screens  are  in  Fig.  5.13.  Prepacked  screens  have  been  used  with  gravel  packs  in-
stead  of  standard  wire-wrapped  screens  and  in  stand-alone  applications  in  horizontal  wells.
While the prepacked screens have been used in stand-alone service, experience has shown that
they  are  highly  prone  to  plugging,  consequently  restricting  productivity.  The  inflow  area  of
these screens is about 4 to 6% of the surface area. The exact amount depends on the slot open-
ing and the size of the gravel.

5.6.4 Flow Capacities of Screens and Slotted Liners.  Fig. 5.14 shows the pressure drop asso-
ciated  with  commercial  wire-wrapped  screens.  Because  all  have  similar  designs,  there  is  little
difference  in  performance  from  one  manufacturer  to  another.  These  flow  capacity  tests  were
performed using water containing no plugging material. The data indicate that all screens have
exceptionally high flow capacities. Flow testing with slotted liners revealed that their flow ca-
pacity was related to the slot density rather than the screen diameter. Their flow capacities are
typically  less  than  half  that  of  wire-wrapped  screens  with  the  same  diameter.  Note  that  the
flow rates were measured in increments of B/D/ft of screen. For flow rates that are typical of
most  wells,  the  pressure  loss  through  the  screen  is  negligible,  provided  that  they  are  not
plugged. Slotted liners are more easily plugged than wire-wrapped screens because the slots are
usually cut parallel to each other. On the other hand, wire-wrapped screens are fabricated with
keystone-shaped  wire  that  allows  a  particle  to  pass  through  the  screen  if  it  can  traverse  the

minimum  restriction  at  the  OD  of  the  screen.  The  keystone  design  can  be  observed  in  Fig.
5.10.

5.6.5 Tensile/Collapse Strengths of Wire-Wrapped and Prepacked Screens.  Tensile strength
test results performed on screens and slotted liners in standard testing equipment showed that
standard pipe-base screens have higher tensile ratings than rod-base screens. Testing demonstrat-
ed  that  yielding  occurred  in  the  pipe  body  as  well  as  the  coupling.  As  a  consequence,  when
yielding  in  the  connection  caused  a  thread  to  separate,  the  test  was  terminated.  The  tensile
strength of standard pipe-base screens was about twice that of the rod-base screens.1 For conser-
vative  designs,  the  tensile  strength  should  be  the  lesser  of  65%  of  the  pipe  body  or  the
published joint pull-out strength.

Individual tests demonstrated collapse failures as high as 6,000 to 9,000 psi; however, this
represented  the  simultaneous  failure  of  the  screen  and  the  pipe  base;  screens  have  a  collapse
rating of about 3,500 psi, which is the rating for the jacket.

5.6.6 Proprietary  Screen  Designs.    Proprietary  designs  were  originally  developed  for  stand-
alone installations in horizontal wells rather than a gravel-packed completion; however, gravel-
pack  screen  applications  should  not  be  ruled  out.  They  are  also  applicable  in  this  service.
Proprietary designs are premium designs that surpass the performance of either a standard wire-
wrapped  screen  or  a  prepacked  screen  in  their  ability  to  resist  plugging  and  erosion  and  are
equipped  with  torque-shouldered  connections  to  permit  rotation.  Because  horizontal  comple-
tions typically consist of a thousand to several thousand feet of completion interval, the main
issue is the susceptibility of a particular design to plug with time rather than the flow capacity.
These new designs have increased inflow areas to as much as 30% of the surface area of the
screens.  The  materials  used  and  the  designs  differ  from  conventional  wire-wrapped  screens.
They consist of designs with lattice, Dutch weave, porous membrane, sintered metal, and corru-
gated weave filtration sections. The logic used in these designs was that because these screens
have  inflow  areas  of  30%  compared  to  about  5%  with  prepacked  screens,  their  longevity
should be extended by about a factor of six when operating under similar downhole conditions.
Other  issues  involve  the  ability  to  run  the  screen  without  creating  damage  that  would  either
prevent  sand  control  or  restrict  productivity.  To  address  this  concern,  most  of  the  proprietary
designs have an outer shroud to protect the screen during installation. Proprietary connections
are typically used for horizontal service because of their high strength and the ability to rotate
if necessary.

Sintered Metal Screens.  The sintered metal screen design was initiated in gravel-pack use
in  about  1990.  The  design  consists  of  placing  a  sintered  metal  sleeve  that  is  0.15  to  0.25  in.
thick  over  a  drilled  pipe  base.  The  sintered  metal  sleeve  contains  approximately  30%  flow
area. The sleeve acts as the filtration medium, while the pipe base provides tensile strength and
collapse resistance. Fig. 5.15 is a schematic of the screen design.

Tensile strength and collapse resistance of this design should be about the same as that for
wire-wrapped screens. For conservative designs, the tensile strength capabilities should be the
about 65% or the lesser of either the published pipe strength or the joint pull-out of the cou-
pling.  The  collapse  rating  should  be  similar  to  published  values  for  wire-wrapped  screens  of
about 3,500 psi.

Porous Metal Membrane Screens.  This screen design consists of multiple layers (3 or 4) of
porous  metal  membrane  (PMM),  which  contains  about  30%  open  area  through  variable-sized
pore  openings.  These  are  between  an  underlying  drainage  and  overlying  protecting  mesh
screen.  They  are  placed  concentrically  between  a  drilled  pipe  base  and  a  perforated  outer
shroud.  The  filter  medium  for  the  screen  is  sintered  metal  powder  that  is  pressed  against  a
stainless steel lattice screen to provide structural support for the filtration medium. A schematic
of  the  screen’s  construction  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  5.16.  Test  data  from  the  manufacturer  show

IV-198

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 5.16—Porous metal membrane screen schematic (courtesy of Baker Oil Tools).

tensile strength testing performed to 110k lbf and a collapse test to about 7,000 psi performed
on 2⅞-in. screens, both of which reflect the strength of the pipe base. These data are similar to
values  for  commodity  wire-wrapped  screens.  The  tensile  strength  rating  should  be  less  than
65% of the pipe body or connection because physical properties of the screen jacket and perfo-
rated shroud should not contribute to these properties significantly.

Shrouded  Multilayer  Screens.    This  screen  design  consists  of  three  layers  of  media  that
form the jacket, which are placed concentrically around a drilled pipe base. The base wrap for
the  jacket  consists  of  a  round  stainless  steel  wire-wrapped  support  that  serves  as  a  drainage
layer for the overlying filtration medium. The shroud is placed concentrically over the filtration
medium. See Fig. 5.17 for a schematic of the design.

The purpose of the base wrap or inner jacket is for support for the overlying filtration medi-
um against high differential pressure. The wrap also promotes using the entire surface area of
the  filtration  medium  that  optimizes  plugging  resistance.  The  openings  in  the  base  wrap  are
typically about 25 microns or larger than the filtration medium to provide secondary sand con-
trol. The filtration medium provides pore throat openings that assist in maximizing the inflow
area that develops a more permeable filter cake. The design of the filtration medium, a Dutch
weave,  redirects  the  flow  through  it  to  minimize  erosion  and  extend  screen  life.  The  design
being  offered  is  rated  at  a  uniform  pore-throat  opening  sizes  from  110  to  230  microns.  The
inflow  area  for  this  design  is  also  about  30%  of  the  surface  area  of  the  screen.  The  outer
shroud protects the inner filtration section during installation in the well and assists in redirect-
ing  the  flow  stream  during  production  so  that  erosion  of  the  filtration  section  is  minimized.
The strength rating for this screen is a tensile rating of 65% of the pipe body or the published
joint pull-out strength and a jacket collapse rating of 3,500 psi.

5.6.7 Plugging and Erosion Tests on Proprietary and Commodity Screens.  Prepacked screen
designs are more susceptible to plugging than other designs. This stems from their depth filter
design. Standard wire-wrapped screens are a surface filter, which are not as susceptible to plug-
ging but are more prone to erosion. Certain proprietary designs are better at resisting plugging
and erosion than others. The best designs have large inflow areas and redirected flow through
the screen to minimize erosion.

5.7 Gravel-Pack Completion Equipment and Service Tools
There  is  a  myriad  of  gravel-pack  systems  available  to  handle  virtually  any  conceivable  well
condition. Fig. 5.18 illustrates typical gravel packs for cased and openhole completions. These
employ crossover gravel packing equipment that is state-of-the-art in the industry today. Wash-

down and reverse circulation methods are other alternatives that are less expensive and are to
be used when costs will not support crossover equipment.

Gravel-pack completion equipment is the equipment that remains in the well after the grav-
el placement operations are complete. The equipment discussed next does not represent all the
types  of  available  equipment,  but  it  does  represent  a  typical  gravel-pack  completion.  Certain
well conditions may require compromises in the type and design of gravel-pack equipment that
can  be  used.  Another  important  concept  is  that  there  may  be  several,  yet  equally  effective,
ways to complete a well.

5.7.1 Gravel-Pack Base.  The first step in installing a gravel-pack completion is to establish a
base on which the screen will rest. In cased-hole completions, the most common type base is a
sump  packer.  The  sump  packer  is  normally  run  into  the  well  on  an  electric  wireline  before
perforating  and  is  set  a  specified  distance  (5  to  10  ft)  below  the  lowest  planned  perforation.
The  distance  below  the  perforations  must  accommodate  the  length  of  the  seal  assembly  and
production screen overlap.

Although sump packers are the preferred gravel-pack base, other options such as a bridge
plug  or  cement  plug  can  be  used.  In  openhole  completions,  provisions  for  a  debris  sump  or
logging  access  can  be  achieved,  but  these  are  not  routine  and  may  not  be  feasible  in  some
situations. Therefore, the gravel-pack base is normally a bull plug on the bottom of the screen.
The types of common gravel-pack bases are illustrated in Fig. 5.19.

5.7.2 Seal Assembly.  The seal assembly is required to establish a seal in the bore of the sump
packer to prevent gravel-pack sand from filling the bottom of the well during gravel packing.

IV-200

Fig. 5.18—Typical gravel-pack completion equipment in cased- and openholes (courtesy of Baker Oil
Tools).

In the case of multiple gravel packs, the seal also provides for zonal isolation. The seal assem-
bly used to engage the sump packer is normally a snap latch type or other type holddown.

Chapter 5—Sand Control

IV-201

Fig. 5.19—Types of gravel-pack bases (courtesy of Baker Oil Tools).

5.7.3 Gravel-Pack Screen.  The purpose of the gravel-pack screen is to create an annulus be-
tween the screen and the casing/open hole and to hold the gravel in place during production.
As discussed earlier, there are several different types of screens.

Screen Centralization.  Filling  the  annulus  between  the  screen/casing  (or  open  hole)  with
gravel-pack  sand  is  essential  to  the  control  of  formation  sand  production.  To  ensure  that  the
annulus is filled completely around the screen, centralization of the screen is required. In cased-
hole  completions, weld-on,  blade-type centralizers are  normally used.  The  blades  are  approxi-
mately  6  in.  long  and  are  cut  from  a  0.25-  to  0.50-in.-thick  plate  or  steel.  The  edges  of  the
centralizers are beveled to ensure easy run-in. The centralizers consist of four blades welded to
the screen base pipe 90° apart to result in an OD approximately 0.25 in. under the ID of the
well’s  casing.  The  centralizers  are  spaced  15  to  20  ft  apart  and  can  be  positioned  at  the  top,
bottom, and/or middle of a screen joint as required.

In  openhole  gravel  packs,  centralization  is  accomplished  with  bow-spring  centralizers.
These centralizers consist of a top and bottom collar connected with 4 to 6 steel spring bows.
The  bows  can  be  compressed  (i.e.,  the  centralizer  is  elongated)  for  running  through  restricted
IDs. When the centralizer enters a larger ID, the bows attempt to expand to their original posi-
tion,  resulting  in  a  restoring  force  or  centralization.  Sufficient  centralizers  are  required  such
that  the  combined  restoring  force  is  capable  of  lifting  the  weight  of  the  screen  in  the  given
hole conditions. Computer programs are available for determining optimum centralizer spacing
for  a  specific  bow-spring  centralizer,  hole  size,  and  deviation.  See  API  Spec.  10D,  Specifica-
tion for Bow-Spring Casing Centralizers.

5.7.4 Blank Pipe.   The  purpose  of  blank  pipe  is  to  provide  a  reservoir  of  gravel-pack  sand
above  the  screen  to  ensure  that  the  screen  remains  completely  packed  in  the  event  of  pack
settling.  During  gravel-pack  operations,  it  is  possible  for  minor  voids  in  the  annulus  pack  to
occur. In fact, gravel packing with viscous gel transport fluids commonly produces voids, par-
ticularly  opposite  the  short  lengths  of  blank  pipe  between  screen  joints.  Depending  on  devia-
tion  angle,  pack  settling  shortly  after  gravel  placement  may  fill  the  voids.  It  is  important  to
have a sufficient reserve of gravel-pack sand available for this process to occur without uncov-
ering the top of the screen.

Blank Pipe Centralization.  As with the screen, the blank pipe must be centralized to ensure
even  gravel  distribution  in  the  blank  and  casing  annulus.  Weld-on  centralizers  are  normally
used  in  both  cased-hole  and  openhole  completions  because  the  blank  pipe  is  almost  always
positioned inside the casing. Bow-spring centralizers can be used if desired or required.

IV-202

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Blank Pipe Length.  Several rules of thumb exist for determining the length of blank pipe.
Perhaps  the  most  scientific  method  would  be  to  recognize  that  voids  will  occur  within  the
length of screen wherever nonscreen regions exist (i.e., at screen joint connections and above
the gravel pack). A long-standing guideline for gravel reserve has been to maintain a minimum
of  30  ft  of  packed  gravel  in  the  blank  pipe  above  the  top  of  the  screen  when  packing  with
brine. When viscous fluids are used, blank lengths may be as much as twice the screen length
for short completion intervals. This allows for additional settling with these fluids when the gel
breaks.

Tell-Tale Screens.  Tell-tale  screens  are  short  screen  sections  that  are  sometimes  used  to
assist with gravel placement and determine when the gravel pack is complete. Their benefit is
questionable. There are two types of tell-tale screens: the upper and lower versions.

Upper tell-tale screens are used primarily with brine-pack systems. They are typically locat-
ed about 30 ft above the main gravel-pack screen. Their function is to indicate, by an increase
in  pressure,  when  the  dehydrated  gravel  has  reached  the  tell-tale  location.  This  assures  that
there is the desired amount of gravel reserve.

Lower tell-tale screens are used when gravel packing with viscous fluids. Their purpose is
to  assist  in  ensuring  that  the  gravel  slurry  reaches  the  bottom  of  the  gravel  pack  before  the
slurry dehydrates. The gravel-pack tools are usually in the lower circulating position when the
tell-tale is used in these installations.

5.7.5 Shear-Out Safety Joint.  A shear-out safety joint is located just above the blank pipe. It
consists  of  a  top  and  bottom  sub  connected  by  shear  screws.  This  device  is  incorporated  in
most  gravel  pack  completion  assemblies  to  allow  retrieval  of  the  gravel-pack  packer  and  the
gravel-pack  extension  independently  of  the  blank  pipe  and  screen.  The  joint  is  parted  with
straight tension to shear the screws while pulling the packer with a packer-retrieving tool.

5.7.6 Knock-Out  Isolation  Valve.    The  knock-out  isolation  valve  is  a  mechanical  fluid-loss
device that prevents completion fluid losses and subsequent damage to the formation after per-
forming the gravel pack. The downward closing flapper in the valve is held open by the gravel-
pack service tools (normally the washpipe) during the gravel pack. When the service tools are
removed from the valve, the flapper closes, preventing fluid loss to the formation. The gravel-
pack  service  tools  can  be  removed  from  the  well  and  the  completion  tubing  run.  When  the
well is producing, the flapper will open. Alternatively, the flapper is made of a breakable mate-
rial and can be broken hydraulically or mechanically before producing the well.

5.7.7 Gravel-Pack Extension.   Gravel-pack  extensions  are  used  with  the  gravel-pack  packer
and service tools to provide a flow path from the tubing above the packer and to the screen/
casing  annulus  below  the  packer.  The  gravel-pack  extension  consists  of  the  upper  extension
(which contains flow ports for the gravel pack fluids), sealbore (sized to match the bore of the
gravel-pack  packer),  and  lower  extension  (to  house  the  gravel-pack  crossover  tool  throughout
its range of motion). The length of the gravel-pack extension is designed to work with a partic-
ular gravel-pack packer and crossover tool. Gravel-pack extensions are available in two types:
perforated or sliding sleeve versions.

5.7.8 Gravel-Pack Packer.  At  the  top  of  the  gravel-pack  assembly  is  a  gravel-pack  packer.
The packer may be permanent or retrievable. However, retrievable type packers are recommend-
ed for gravel packing. A retrievable packer expedites workover activities without the potential
cost  and  risk  of  milling  a  permanent  packer.  The  retrievable  packers  used  for  gravel  packing
are  usually  sealbore  type  packers  that  can  also  be  used  for  production;  therefore,  the  packer
must be designed for the temperature, pressure, and environmental conditions present in the well.

5.7.9 Gravel-Pack Service Tools.  Gravel-pack  service  tools  are  the  equipment  necessary  to
perform the gravel pack; they are removed from the well after gravel packing. In most cases,
the  type  of  gravel-pack  equipment  used  dictates  the  service  tools  required  for  a  gravel  pack.
Further discussion of the service tools is discussed next.

Hydraulic Setting Tool.  The hydraulic setting tool is a hydraulic piston that generates the
force required to set the gravel-pack packer. It is attached to the top of the crossover tool and
has  a  sleeve  shouldered  against  the  setting  sleeve  of  the  packer.  A  setting  ball  is  dropped  to
the ball seat in the crossover tool to plug off the ID of the work string. Applied pressure to the
work string acts on a piston in the hydraulic setting tool to force the sleeve down to compress
the slips and packing element of the packer. Special versions of the setting tool are available,
which allow for rotation and high-circulating rates while running the gravel-pack assembly.

Gravel-Pack Crossover Tool.  The gravel-pack crossover tool creates the various circulating
paths  for  fluid  flow  during  gravel  packing.  The  crossover  tool  consists  of  a  series  of  molded
seals surrounding a gravel-pack port midway down the tool and a return port near the top of
the tool. A concentric tube (washpipe) design in the crossover tool along with the gravel-pack
packer and gravel-pack extension allow fluid pumped down the work string above the packer
to “cross over” to the screen/casing annulus below the packer. Similarly, return fluids flowing
up  the  washpipe  and  below  the  packer  can  “cross  over”  to  the  work  string/casing  annulus
above the packer.

Gravel-pack crossover tools typically have three positions: squeeze, circulating, and reverse
circulating, as illustrated in Fig. 5.20. The squeeze position is located by positioning to seal the
return ports. The squeeze position allows all fluids pumped down the work string to be forced
into the formation. It is used to perform squeeze gravel-pack treatments and/or inject acid treat-
ments into the formation. The circulating position is located by picking the crossover tool up
approximately 18 in. above the squeeze position. The circulating position works with a proper-
ly  sized  washpipe  to  provide  a  flow  path  to  circulate  gravel-pack  sand  to  completely  fill  the
screen/casing  annulus.  The  fluids  flow  down  the  work  string  into  the  crossover  tool,  out  the
gravel-pack  extension,  down  the  screen/casing  annulus  into  the  screen,  up  the  washpipe  into
the crossover tool again, and up the work string/casing annulus. Special, high-rate, erosion-re-
sistant crossover tools are available for high-rate brine or frac-pack completions.

Washpipe.  Washpipe is run below the gravel-pack crossover tool inside the blank pipe and
screen to ensure that the return circulation point for the gravel-pack carrier fluid is at the bot-
tom of the screen. The washpipe assists in placing gravel-pack sand at the bottom of the screen
and packing from the bottom up. The end of the washpipe should be as close to the bottom of
the screen as possible.

Maximizing the washpipe OD increases the resistance to flow, preferentially into the wash-
pipe/screen  annulus.  The  greater  resistance  to  flow  forces  the  gravel-pack  transport  fluid  to
flow  in  the  screen/casing  annulus  and  carry  the  gravel-pack  sand  to  the  bottom  of  the  well.
That  causes  the  gravel  packing  of  the  screen/casing  annulus  to  be  more  complete.  The  opti-
mum ratio of washpipe OD to screen base pipe ID should be approximately 0.8. Achieving this
ratio in some screen sizes will require the use of special flush-joint washpipe connections.

5.8 Well Preparation for Gravel Packing
Well preparation includes many activities to ensure that the well is completed properly. Some
of these items and activities include: appropriate drilling practices, cleanliness, completion flu-
ids, perforating, perforation cleaning, acidizing, and specifications for rig and service company
personnel.

5.8.1 Drilling Practices.  The productivity of a cased- or openhole gravel-packed completion is
determined  in  part  by  the  condition  of  the  reservoir  behind  the  filter  cake,  the  quality  of  the
filter  cake,  and  the  stability  of  the  wellbore.  Given  this,  it  can  be  said  that  the  completion

IV-204

begins  when  the  bit  enters  the  pay.  Thus,  it  follows  that  the  goal  of  drilling  is  to  maintain
wellbore stability while minimizing formation damage.

5.8.2 Maintaining Wellbore Stability.  Wellbore  stability  in  the  form  of  washouts,  hole  col-
lapse,  and  fracturing  is  an  effect  of  large  drilling  fluid  loss,  inadequate  overbalance,  and/or
reaction  between  filtrate  and  the  formation.  But,  for  whatever  reason,  instability  affects  both
cased-  and  openhole  completions  because  it  can  cause  loss  of  the  wellbore.  Thick  cement
sheaths in washed-out sections result in poor to no perforation penetration and the lack of ce-
ment  can  make  sand  placement  difficult.  Hole  collapse  can  prevent  running  screens  to  the
bottom  of  the  hole,  and  failure,  in  the  form  of  fracturing  or  collapse,  can  stop  an  openhole
gravel pack, should failure occur while the pack is in process.

Because  stability  is  an  effect  of  the  reaction  between  the  drill-in  fluid  and  the  formation,
filtrate,  filter  cake,  weight,  and  rheology  become  key  parameters  in  building  a  drill-in  fluid.

Chapter 5—Sand Control

IV-205

These  variables  usually  can  be  addressed  by  using  polymers  and  fluid-loss  agents  in  a  brine-
based fluid containing a properly-sized bridging agent like that contained in special drill-in fluids.

5.8.3 Formation  Damage.    Formation  damage,  expressed  quantitatively  in  the  form  of  skin,
depends on the filtrate used, particle damage, and, for openhole gravel packs, filter cake quali-
ty.  Skin,  in  turn,  is  a  reflection  of  poor  productivity;  it  is  expensive  to  remove  or  bypass.
Preservation  of  reservoir  pore  throats  requires  keeping  particles  out  of  pores,  minimizing  fil-
trate loss, and employing a filtrate that is compatible with rock and reservoir fluids.

With openhole completions, filtrate must be nondamaging, but it is generally overlooked in
cased-hole  completions.  Frequently,  it  is  assumed  that  any  damage  caused  by  filtrate  will  be
bypassed with perforating. Looking at the occasions when reservoirs are exposed to moderate
to high fluid losses, often expressed as a “thirsty mud,” it is possible to have filtrate invade 1
to 3 ft from the wellbore. If the filtrate is incompatible with reservoir rock and fluid, there will
be a damaged ring beyond which it may be impossible for perforations to penetrate. For open-
hole completions, the quality of the filter cake is also as important as the other requirements.
Because  the  cake  must  be  gravel  packed  into  place,  it  is  necessary  that  the  cake  be  thin  and
friable and have a low breakout pressure.

Again, as with the wellbore stability issue, filtrate and filter cake become key parameters.
Proper selection of a filtrate brine base, along with polymers and fluid loss agents containing a
properly-sized bridging agent, usually meets these needs.

5.8.4 Cleaning the Casing, Openhole, and Work String.  Cleanliness may be one of the most
important  considerations  for  gravel  packing.  Because  a  gravel  pack  represents  the  installation
of a downhole filter, any action that promotes plugging the gravel pack is detrimental to well
productivity. Many advances have been made in improving the cleanliness of gravel-pack oper-
ations,  particularly  in  completion  fluids.  However,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  clean  completion
fluids are used, the lack of cleanliness in the casing, work string, lines, pits, and other equip-
ment is a source of potential formation damage. While cleaning the well and rig equipment can
be expensive, it is not as expensive as lost productivity or having to rework the entire comple-
tion because proper cleaning was neglected in the beginning.

Casing.  Reverse circulation is the preferred method of circulation for cleaning the casing.
The recommended annular velocity is a minimum of 130 ft/min for casing shoe deviations less
than 60° and 300 ft/min for wellbore deviations greater than 60°. Reverse circulation is more
effective than conventional circulating, as material is moved downhole with the gravity where
it  is  more  efficiently  circulated  to  the  surface  because  of  higher  velocities  in  the  work  string
than in the annulus. For an openhole completion, reverse circulation permits cleaning the cas-
ing  to  specifications  before  addressing  the  open  hole.  Planning  for  a  work  string  that  will
permit reverse circulation at reasonable bottomhole pressures is required.

Mechanical, hydraulic, and chemical cleaning agents should be employed to clean the cas-
ing.  Mechanical  agents  are  usually  in  the  form  of  casing  scrapers;  most  hydraulic  agents  are
push pills and filtered brine. Casing sweeps provide a chemical wash to address polymers, oil,
and/or solids adhering to the casing wall.

As a mechanical agent, scrapers remove cement and scale, which will not hinder a bit but
will impede a packer. It is prudent to run casing scrapers to the bottom or at least through the
interval to be perforated. For openhole completions, the scraper should be run to within 100 ft
of the shoe or at least past the proposed packer seat. In displacing the drilling/drill-in fluid, a
push pill is pumped first, followed by a casing sweep that is followed by filtered brine. (See
Fig.  5.21.)  Push  pills  serve  as  a  hydraulic  piston  by  creating  a  sharp  interface  between  mud
and casing sweep. The casing sweep removes polymers and solids adhering to the casing wall.
The filtered brine provides turbulence to help remove and wash material from the casing.

IV-206

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 5.21—Cleaning the casing (courtesy of Baker Oil Tools).

Push  pill  volumes  should  at  least  be  equal  to  a  volume  of  300  ft  of  work  string-casing
annulus and have the same density as the drill-in fluid and a yield point that is 1.5 to 2.0 times
that of the drill-in fluid. Thus, they are easily made from a portion of the drill-in mud by the
addition  of  a  viscosifier  to  raise  the  yield  point.  Casing  sweeps  depend  on  the  chemical  em-
ployed  to  remove  solids  and  polymer  and,  to  be  effective,  will  require  some  contact  time  at
turbulent  rates.  Calcium  hypochlorite  (65%  active)  at  1.5  lbm/bbl  and  a  5-min  contact  time
effectively removes polymers and fluid-loss agents.

Open Hole.  As  with  the  casing,  reverse  circulation  is  the  preferred  method  of  circulation
for an open hole. With the casing cleaned and displaced as previously discussed, all attention
can be focused on cleaning the open hole. Wellbore losses and instability can easily be detect-
ed and repaired if necessary, and any unrecovered material will be pushed to the bottom out of
the way. Recommended annular velocity is 300 ft/min at any deviation to scour the filter cake
in preparation for gravel packing and to clean the hole.

Push pills should be used to displace the drill-in fluid from the open hole. The pill should
be  spotted  in  the  casing  and  work  string  annulus  above  the  open  hole  using  forward  circula-
tion;  then,  the  work  string  is  run  to  the  bottom  and  the  push  pill  and  drill-in  fluid  displaced
from the open hole with filtered brine using reverse circulation. (See Fig. 5.22.) Push pills are
sized, as previously discussed in the section on casing cleaning.

Work String.  The  work  string  should  be  sized  to  permit  reverse  circulation.  It  should  al-
ways be run open ended to minimize backpressure on the formation. The work string contains
the same types of debris associated with the casing; however, unlike casing, both the inner and
outer  surfaces  of  the  work  string  must  be  clean  because  completion  fluid  is  circulated  along
both surfaces. The work string is usually not a major problem if it has been in use before the
completion.  Work  strings  just  delivered  from  storage  should  be  carefully  inspected  for  scale,
rust, mill varnish, and other debris. Scraping the work string is usually not as good an option
as for the casing, but visual inspections, before it is run into the well, are encouraged to ensure
that  the  string  is  in  good  mechanical  condition  and  clean.  As  a  minimum,  a  “rabbit  or  drift”
with  a  diameter  slightly  less  than  the  drift  diameter  of  the  work  string  helps  to  loosen  scale

Chapter 5—Sand Control

IV-207

and  other  debris,  as  well  as  providing  assurance  of  the  internal  diameter  of  the  work  string.
Once the work string is clean, every effort must be made to keep it clean.

A common source of contamination of the gravel pack is thread dope lubricant. One should
use thread dope lubricant sparingly and only on the pin ends during the completion phase. Elim-
inate the use of thread dope completely on the final run in the hole just before gravel packing
the  well.  Pickling  the  work  string  with  a  pipe  dope  solvent  and  a  10%  HCl  solution  before
starting a gravel pack is a must. As with any solvent, there is a required contact time and wash
rate to dissolve lubricant and carry material out of the work string. Consider the use of a dedi-
cated clean work string strictly for gravel packing, if a number of wells are to be completed.

5.8.5 Surface Facilities.  Although they are sometimes ignored, tanks and lines are a common
cause of damaging materials, particularly when the rig that drilled the well is used for complet-
ing  the  well.  Tanks  must  be  thoroughly  scraped  and  jetted  to  ensure  that  any  residual  solids
from the drilling fluids are removed. When possible, tanks should be dedicated to completion
fluids when a drilling program involves drilling numerous wells requiring gravel packs. Casing
sweep chemicals and seawater are recommended for removing debris from rig lines.

5.8.6 Quality Assurance.  If properly filtered brine is used as per the following discussion on
filtration, the hole is displaced as recommended, and surface facilities are cleaned, it is easy to
obtain returned brine that has less than 20 NTU (nephelometric turbidity units) throughout the
entire gravel-pack operation. Again, this is only possible if all of the steps are followed. NTU
are measured with turbidity meters that should be carefully calibrated.

5.8.7 Filtration.  As stated earlier, gravel-pack completion fluids must be sufficiently clean in
order that suspended particles do not plug or reduce the permeability of the formation, perfora-
tions,  or  gravel-pack  sand.  To  achieve  a  clean  fluid  requires  filtration.  Completion  fluids  are
typically filtered to 2 or 10 microns, but in some cases, they are filtered to 1 micron. The fluid
can be filtered by either a diatomaceous earth (DE) filter upstream in combination with a car-

IV-208

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 5.23—DE filtration system for completion or workover (courtesy of Baker Oil Tools).

tridge filter unit downstream or with a cartridge filter unit alone. A schematic of the filtration
system  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.23.  The  DE  filter  unit  does  a  majority  of  the  filtering  before  the
fluid arrives at the cartridge filter unit. Because DE is less expensive than cartridge filters, the
use of a DE filter with a cartridge filter downstream is more economical than a cartridge filter
unit alone. This is especially true if the completion fluid is dirty, which is usually true at some
point during the completion or if large volumes of fluid are required, as in the case of gravel
packing.

DE filters are not absolute filters, so a wide variety of particle sizes are capable of “bleed-
ing  through”  the  filter.  The  DE  filter  packing  itself  also  will  bleed  through  the  filter.  DE  is
capable of plugging the formation and is not acid soluble; therefore, a DE filter should always
be used with a downstream cartridge filter to stop the DE and provide additional fluid filtration.
Cartridge filter units can use either nominal or absolute filter cartridges. The nominal filters
are  typically  wound  elements  designed  for  bulk  solids  removal  using  deep  bed  filtration.  The
absolute filters have pleated elements that rely on surface filtration to retain specific size parti-
cles.  Absolute  filters  are  rated  on  their  efficiencies  by  their  beta  rating.  The  beta  rating  is
defined as the ratio of the concentration of a given particle size entering the filter to the concen-
tration of the same size particle exiting the filter. Commonly used filters have beta ratings from
100 to 5,000. The beta rating depends on flow rate. As an example, a filter that will stop a 2-
micron particle at 1 gal/min (gpm) might not stop the same particle at 10 gpm. Also, beta ratio
depends on the particle size considered. A cartridge will have a high beta ratio (removal effi-
ciency)  for  large  particles,  but  a  lower  beta  ratio  for  smaller  particles.  For  most  oilfield
operations,  filters  with  beta  ratings  of  1,000  are  all  that  are  required  because  these  remove
99.9% of the particulate material from the fluid passed through it. The equation for calculating
removal efficiency from the beta ratio is written as

Rex = 100( βx − 1

βx

), .......................................................... (5.2)

where

and

Rex = removal efficiency for particle size “x” (percent),

Chapter 5—Sand Control

IV-209

β = beta ratio for particle size “x.”
Most  completion  fluids  used  for  gravel  packing  are  filtered  to  2  microns  with  a  removal
efficiency of 99.9% or better. Care should be taken while filtering to ensure that the pressure
differential  through  the  cartridges  does  not  exceed  the  cartridge  manufacturer’s  recommenda-
tion  (typically  30  psi);  otherwise,  collapse  of  the  cartridge  and  fluid  bypass  may  occur,
destroying  the  filter’s  efficiency.  Filtration  of  naturally  viscous  fluids  is  difficult  because  of
increased pressure drop required to flow a viscous fluid through the cartridge. If polymers are
used,  they  must  be  thoroughly  sheared  to  remove  unhydrated  clusters  or  “fish  eyes.”  These
fluids  should  be  filtered  after  shearing.  Occasionally,  you  may  have  to  deal  with  extremely
dirty  fluids.  If  time  permits,  it  is  advisable  to  allow  the  dirty  fluid  to  stand  undisturbed
overnight to allow solids to settle to the bottom of the holding tank. The clean fluid can then
be decanted from the top of the tank and filtered without having to deal with the large volume
of settled particles. Oil entrained in the completion fluid also can present filtration problems.

5.8.8 Completion and Gravel-Pack Fluids.  The normal sources of completion fluids are pro-
duced  brine,  seawater,  or  commercially  mixed  clear  brines.  In  addition  to  being  clean,  the
fluids used in the well completion must be compatible with the formation and formation fluids.
Of particular concern is clay swelling. Additionally, the fluid should be compatible (that is, not
cause  precipitation  on  mixing)  with  formation  water.  The  candidate  completion  fluids  should
be tested in the laboratory to ensure their compatibility with the formation and formation fluids
because an incompatible completion fluid can cause permanent formation damage.

The overriding design criterion for a good completion fluid is the hydrostatic requirements
to maintain well control. Fluid density can be controlled by adding several water-soluble salts
such  as  sodium  chloride,  sodium  bromide,  potassium  chloride,  ammonium  chloride,  calcium
chloride,  calcium  bromide,  zinc  bromide  and  lithium  bromide.  The  densities  of  these  fluids
range from 8.33 to as high as about 20 lbm/gal, values that are comparable with the densities
of drilling muds. All fluids have their advantages and disadvantages, which depend on the den-
sity of the fluid required. High density fluids are expensive.

The  fluids  used  for  gravel  packing  can  be  water  or  oil  based.  The  water-based  fluids  are
usually  the  most  desirable,  have  a  higher  density,  and  are  more  flexible  to  use  than  the  oil-
based systems. Because of this, the water-based fluids are more commonly used. The simplest
water-based  fluid  used  for  gravel  packing  is  the  completion  brine  itself.  Crude  oil  has  been
used in the past in preference to water because it was cheaper; however, with the increase in
the cost of oil, its use has been largely discontinued in preference to the water-based systems.
Crude  oil  is  still  a  valid  alternative  in  extremely  water  sensitive  formations  and  when  small
densities are needed; however, oil is inflammable, and extra precautions are needed to prevent
spills.

5.8.9 Perforating for Gravel Packing.  Perforating consideration for gravel packing is primari-
ly  an  exercise  in  selecting  the  perforating  gun  and  charge  configuration  that  will  provide
adequate inflow from the reservoir. Remember that the gravel must be placed in the perforation
tunnels. If the gravel porosity is about 35%, this equates to filling 65% of the cross-sectional
area of the perforations with gravel. Large-diameter perforations, greater than 0.75 in., fired in
high-shot  density  guns,  12  shots/ft  or  higher,  are  the  desired  configuration  to  provide  a  high
inflow area. The gravel-pack charges have typical penetrations of 8 to 10 in., which is all that
is required for these completions. Deep penetration charge designs are ineffective because they
produce  an  insufficient  perforation  area  for  gravel  packs.  They  should  be  avoided  except  in
special situations, such as having to penetrate two strings of casing, etc. Whether the perforat-
ing  is  performed  with  wireline  or  tubing-conveyed  guns  depends  on  interval  length  and  other
factors.  Short,  one-gun  run  completions  favor  the  wireline  guns.  Intervals  with  completion
lengths greater than 30 ft favor tubing conveyed guns because the entire interval can be perfo-

IV-210

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

ration  underbalanced  with  a  single  run  of  the  perforating  assembly.  Other  than  these  broad
guidelines, one should use standard perforating procedures.

5.8.10 Perforation Cleaning.  With an impingement pressure approaching 15,000,000 psi, the
perforation jet pushes through the casing and cement and into the formation, where it compacts
the  materials  immediately  surrounding  the  perforation.  Because  the  cement  and  the  formation
are crystalline, they are compacted. This creates a zone of reduced permeability at the bound-
ary of the perforation that is caused by the high impingement pressure. It is often referred to as
the compacted zone. The compacted zone can be up to ½ in. thick and can have a permeability
that  is  substantially  less  than  that  of  the  bulk  formation,  which  can  significantly  restrict  well
productivity.

Additionally, the shaped charge creates debris that is deposited in the perforation. The met-
al from the housing is typically steel and not readily soluble in acid. The liner is usually made
of  compressed  copper  that  may  form  a  copper  slug  called  a  “carrot”  after  the  perforation  is
created. The carrot may remain inside the hollow carrier and be retrieved, or it could remain in
the perforation tunnel or become lodged in the perforation entrance hole in the casing, which is
the worst case.

The perforating debris and the compacted zone must be removed to maximize well produc-
tivity.  Failure  to  remove  the  debris  and  compacted  zone  can  reduce  the  potential  production
rate.  The  methods  available  for  perforation  cleaning  include  acidizing,  washing,  backsurging,
underbalanced  perforating,  and  fracturing.  Some  recently  developed  techniques  are  also  avail-
able to assist in the operation of cleaning the perforations such as “debris-free” charges. Such
charges are not actually debris-free but result in fine-grained material that is acid soluble and
easily flowed from the well.

Acidizing.  Acidizing  perforations  involves  injecting  a  predetermined  type  and  volume  of
acid into the perforations after they have been created to dissolve any acid-soluble material. In
most cases, perforating debris is not highly soluble in acid; therefore, acidizing is more effec-
tive and better applied when used with other cleaning techniques. Some considerations critical
to  acidizing  are  the  compatibility  of  the  acid  with  the  formation,  the  volume  of  acid  being
pumped, and the need for uniform placement of the acid into the perforations.

Acid  solubility tests  should  be  performed  on  a  formation sample to  select the  most  effec-
tive  acid.  This  is  important  because  the  acid  may  actually  damage  the  formation  instead
stimulating it. The volume of acid to pump is typically determined by the number of perfora-
tions and the length of the perforated interval.

Poor placement of acid produces variable and inconsistent results, possibly leading to a de-
crease  in  productivity.  Ideally,  each  perforation  would  receive  an  equal  volume  of  acid.  In
reality, the acid tends to flow into the perforations that are unrestricted and do not especially
need cleaning. Meanwhile, other perforations that do need cleaning take in little or no acid. To
achieve  uniform  placement  of  acid  into  the  perforations,  use  an  acid  “diverter”  to  attempt  to
divert  acid  from  the  permeable  perforations  to  the  damaged  perforations.  The  usual  technique
involves pumping several stages of acid separated by diverter slurries consisting of viscous gel
and gravel-pack sand. The diverter will flow into the most permeable perforations and fill them
with gravel-pack sand. The combination of gravel-pack sand and the high viscosity of the gel
reduce the ability of the perforation to accept fluid. The next acid stage should then flow into
the other, more resistive perforations, allowing for a more uniform treatment. This technique is
referred to as a “staged acid treatment” or an “acid prepack.” It can be performed immediately
after underbalanced tubing-conveyed perforating (for best results) or just before performing the
gravel pack. This will be reviewed further in the discussion on prepacking perforations.

5.8.11 Washing.  The goal of washing is to establish communication between several sets of
perforations  to  effectively  remove  the  perforation  debris  and  compacted  zone  from  the  well.

Chapter 5—Sand Control

IV-211

Fig. 5.24—Washing perforations with wash tool.1

Unfortunately, perforation washing is commonly performed incorrectly because rig crews may
not take time to follow correct procedures. Washing perforations involves running an opposing
cup-type  tool  or  pinpoint  packers  into  the  well  after  perforating.  The  cup  tool  seals  on  the
inside  of  the  casing  and  allows  a  circulation  path  through  the  tool  and  out  ports  located  be-
tween  the  opposing  cups.  The  tool’s  cup  spacing  is  usually  about  1  ft  to  focus  the  washing
operation over a short interval. The washing consists of pumping filtered, unviscosified comple-
tion  fluid  at  the  largest  rate  possible  without  breaking  down  the  perforations,  as  Fig.  5.24
illustrates. Washing should be conducted at the smallest acceptable fluid overbalance.

5.8.12 Backsurging.  Backsurging is the running of a surge tool in the well after perforating.
The tool has a chamber that contains air at atmospheric pressure. A packer is set, and the low-
er  valve  to  the  chamber  is  opened  to  expose  the  formation  to  atmospheric  pressure,  thereby
surging  the  perforation  to  expel  damage.  Unfortunately,  the  technique  does  not  open  all

IV-212

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

plugged perforations and may require several runs in the well to achieve results. Each run is a
special trip.

5.8.13 Underbalanced Tubing Conveyed Perforating.  Underbalanced-tubing-conveyed perfo-
rating  is  popular  for  cleaning  perforations.  It  is  similar  to  backsurging  but  only  requires  a
single  trip  in  that  the  desired  underbalance  is  set  by  the  amount  of  fluid  in  the  work  string.
Upon gun detonation, the formation is immediately surged in proportion to the amount of un-
derbalance.  General  guidelines  for  underbalance  in  unconsolidated  sandstone  reservoirs  are  to
use  500  psi  for  oil  wells  and  1,000  psi  for  gas  wells.  In  a  given  field,  trial-and-error  testing
can establish the best underbalance for site-specific conditions.

5.8.14 Fracturing.  A relatively new technique is to bypass perforating damage instead of us-
ing a cleaning or removal technique. Extreme overbalance perforating is used to perforate and
then  fracture  the  formation.  The  process  has  been  used  primarily  on  consolidated  formations
with relatively large compressive strengths.

Frac packing and water fracs also have been successfully used in unconsolidated formations

to bypass perforating, drilling, and cementing damage. This procedure is discussed later.

5.8.15 Fluid  Loss  Control.    Fluid  loss  control  is  a  common  consideration  when  completing
unconsolidated  formations  with  a  gravel  pack,  especially  in  high-permeability  formations.  In
addition  to  the  potential  formation  damage  caused  by  fluid  loss,  there  is  particular  anxiety
when expensive fluids are involved or when completion fluid reserves are low. The amount of
fluid loss that can be tolerated tends to be site-specific, but when losses exceed about 30 bbl/
hr, there is concern. Loss rates of 20 to 40 bbl/hr on an offshore rig that has only 100 bbl of
reserve  fluid  is  serious.  In  the  latter  situation,  the  rig  has  about  3  to  4  hours  before  it  either
runs  out  of  fluid  or  has  to  replenish  its  supply.  Another  problematic  situation  is  when  fluid
losses are high and the completion brine is costly. Hence, managing and minimizing fluid loss-
es can be a major problem.

The normal methods for controlling fluid loss include: reduced hydrostatic pressure, viscous
polymer gels, graded solid particles, and mechanical means. The type of fluid-loss control that
is  recommended  often  depends  on  what  phase  of  the  completion  process  is  being  executed.
Because completion begins as soon as the bit enters the pay and continues through the running
of  production  tubing,  excessive  fluid  loss  may  become  an  issue  while  drilling  the  reservoir,
during openhole gravel packing (especially for a highly deviated hole), immediately after perfo-
rating, after prepacking, and after gravel packing.

When selecting a fluid-loss control technique, the current condition of the well, operations
still  needing  completion,  and  available  remedial  techniques  for  elimination  of  the  deleterious
effects of fluid loss control must all be considered. These considerations may lead to different
fluid-loss control techniques being used throughout the completion and must not be taken lightly.

5.9 Gravel Placement Techniques
Gravel packing consists of installing a downhole filter in the well to control the entry of forma-
tion  material  but  allow  the  production  of  reservoir  fluids.  The  gravel-packed  completion  is
perhaps  the  most  difficult  and  complex  routine  completion  operation  because  it  consists  of
many interrelated completion practices. There are two primary objectives for gravel packing a
well. First, the annulus between the screen and casing must be packed with gravel. Filling the
annulus with properly-sized gravel ensures that the formation sand is not produced to surface.
The second objective is to pack each perforation with gravel. Filling the perforations with grav-
el  is  the  key  to  obtaining  high  productivity.  In  an  unconsolidated  formation,  any  perforation
that is unfilled with gravel will fill with formation sand and severely restrict productivity from

Chapter 5—Sand Control

such perforations. The following discussion deals with filling the annulus. Perforation packing
is discussed later.

The  crossover  circulating  technique  is  the  most  common  method  used  to  place  the  gravel
around  the  screen.  The  gravel-pack  equipment  and  service  tools  allow  circulating  the  gravel
down  the  work  string  above  the  packer  and  into  the  screen/casing  annulus  below  the  packer.
The returns flow up the washpipe and cross over into the work string/casing annulus. The fluid
used to transport the gravel can either leak off to the formation or be circulated or reversed out
of the hole through the washpipe (as illustrated in Fig. 5.25), depending on the position of the
service tools.

A  variety  of  fluids  has  been  used  as  gravel  transport  fluids  such  as  brine,  oil,  diesel,
crosslinked gels, clarified xanthum gum (XC) gel, hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) gel, and foam.
The most commonly used fluids have been brine and HEC gel. Gravel packs performed with
brine are referred to as water/brine packs or conventional packs. Gravel packs performed with
HEC gel transport fluids are referred to as slurry packs, gel, or viscous packs. Table 5.4 is a
comparison of HEC gel and brine characteristics that are important to their use as gravel trans-
port fluids. When using HEC, the gravel is suspended by the gel and settles slowly because of
the  high  fluid  viscosity.  When  using  brine  as  a  transport  fluid,  the  gravel  settles  quickly  be-
cause  of  the  low  viscosity.  Hence,  higher  pump  rates  may  be  required  to  cope  with  particle
settling when brines are used.

5.9.1 Historical Background.  The  earliest  gravel  packs  were  performed  in  shallow,  vertical
wells, typically by simply pouring gravel into the tubing/casing annulus and allowing the grav-
el  to  settle  around  a  screen.  Some  screens  were  even  washed  into  place  after  the  gravel  was
placed. The technique is still employed in water wells but now is seldom used in oil/gas wells.
As equipment and technology improved, gravel packing of oil/gas wells was accomplished by
mixing sand in brine and pumping the mixture into the hole. Brine represents the simplest of
the  transport  fluids.  Before  the  early  1960s,  brine  was  the  most  commonly  used  gravel-pack
fluid because other fluid systems had not been developed at that time.

The early equipment used to mix brine and gravel was inefficient and resulted in the “slug-
ging”  of  gravel  into  the  hole,  as  opposed  to  a  consistent  brine-to-gravel  mix  ratio.  The  brine
was  seldom  filtered,  and  no  specifications  were  in  place  to  ensure  the  quality  of  gravel-pack
sand. Overall rig housekeeping was poor, and the perforating techniques available were limited
to  low-shot  density,  small-diameter  guns  that  produced  entrance-hole  diameters  that  were  less
than 0.5 in. in diameter. The combination of all these factors resulted in unsatisfactory gravel-
pack completions that were commonly damaged.

In  the  late  1960s,  research  efforts9–11  by  several  companies  focused  on  improving  gravel
packing. The research efforts culminated in the introduction of viscosified gravel transport flu-
ids, HEC being the fluid of choice. One of the most attractive features of viscous fluids is that
it permits the transport of high gravel concentrations (up to 15 lbm/gal). HEC gel provided a
reasonably  clean  medium  for  transporting  the  gravel-pack  sand,  the  gel  allowed  consistent
batch  mixing,  and  it  protected  the  gravel  from  crushing  and  contamination  during  pumping.
Because  of  its  apparent  advantages,  HEC  fluids  rapidly  replaced  brine  as  the  gravel  packing
fluid of choice. HEC gels remained the “state-of-the-art” gravel transport fluid for many compa-
nies until the early 1990s.

Despite the advances in gravel quality, wellbore cleanliness, fluid filtration, and perforation
quality, gravel-packed wells were not, in general, producing as efficiently as theoretically possi-
ble.  Gravel-pack  skins  from  20  to  100  were  common  when  gels  were  used.  Also,  it  became
common knowledge that gravel packs performed with gelled fluids commonly produced voids
in  the  packs.  HEC  was  evidently  not  as  nondamaging  as  originally  assumed,  and  as  a  conse-
quence, improved shear mixing procedures were developed.5,12,13 Despite better mixing, damage
because of residual gel remained likely. Research also indicated that HEC did not pack perfora-

tions efficiently in deviated wells with a large interval zone length.6 Alternatives to HEC, such
as  crosslinked  (XC)  polymers  and  other  special  gels,  were  proposed  as  the  ideal  gravel-pack
fluid but were never completely accepted.

Research14 and operating data presented in the early 1990s showed that water was a general-
purpose gravel transport fluid that produced low-porosity packs that did not contain voids and
was capable of efficiently prepacking perforations, provided that fluid loss was acceptable. Im-
proved  mixing  equipment  was  developed  for  handling  brine-sand  mixtures  in  water-pack
systems.  The  equipment  allowed  consistent  mixing  of  gravel  in  brine  and  redirected  attention

Chapter 5—Sand Control

IV-215

to brine as the gravel transport fluid of choice. Coupled with research data and positive field
results, these developments initiated the trend for most of the industry to accept brine as a gravel-
pack carrier fluid.14,15 Although gel represented an improvement in technology at the time and
is still applicable for certain well situations, brine is the most widely used gravel-pack fluid in
the industry today. However, gelled fluids are used extensively for frac packing.

Continued  evolution  of  procedures  saw  the  introduction  of  DE  filtration  systems  (circa
1980)  that  were  able  to  filter  large  quantities  of  brine  quickly  at  a  reasonable  cost.  Coupled
with  the  increasing  use  of  clear  brine,  DE  filtration  systems  resulted  in  substantially  cleaner
wellbores than previously had been possible.

In  1986,  the  API  introduced  specifications  for  gravel-pack  sand  (API  RP58,  Testing  Sand
Used in Gravel-Packing Techniques) that established rigorous requirements.5 The API specifica-
tions called for gravel, sieved to strict tolerances with low crush resistance and acid solubility,
that was capable of passing through pumping equipment with little or no degradation. Finally,
in the early 1980s, underbalanced-tubing-conveyed perforating became a common and well-es-
tablished technique for achieving the high-shot density, large-hole diameter, clean perforations
required  for  maximum  gravel-packed  well  productivity.  All  of  these  improvements,  develop-
ments, and changes significantly improved the gravel-packing systems that are now offered on
a routine service.

5.9.2 Physical Model Observations.  Field-scale model studies14 with water and gelled trans-
port  fluids  in  a  22-ft-long  clear  plastic  gravel-pack  model  revealed  many  significant  facts
concerning gravel placement. The model simulated a 7-in. casing with a 2⅜-in. screen that had
a perforation shot density from 0 to 12 shots/ft. The model could be rotated to simulate well
deviations from 0 to 110° from vertical. The following discussion deals primarily with cased-
hole  completions.  It  also  applies  to  openhole  completions  for  gravel  packing  the  annulus
between the screen and the open hole.

Brine Transport Fluids.  Simulations  with  brine  transport  fluids  were  performed  at  devia-
tions  from  0  to  110°.  The  gravel-packing  sequence  at  well  deviations  from  0  to  45°  were
highly  controlled  by  gravity  and  packed  from  the  bottom  of  the  well  upwards,  as  Fig.  5.26
portrays.  As  long  as  finite  leakoff  occurred  through  the  perforations,  they  were  packed  with
gravel. The gravel did not begin filling the perforation tunnels until the level of the gravel in
the  annulus  reached  the  perforation  entrance.  At  this  point,  the  gravel  would  divert  into  the
perforations  (if  the  perforation  was  experiencing  leakoff)  and  completely  pack  the  perforation
as the annular pack level rose. The result was a tight annular pack that completely prepacked
the perforations experiencing leakoff. Well deviations of 45 to 60° from vertical were also com-
pletely packed, but the packing began on the low side of the hole and filled the annulus with a
series of dunes propagated up and down the length of the model. At about 60° well deviation,
the gravel is in transition between falling to the bottom of the interval or remaining at the top
of the interval on the low side of the hole. As a consequence, the packing is random, as shown
in Fig. 5.27. The reason for this behavior is that at about 60°, it represents the complement of
the angle of repose for gravel that is about 28°, as illustrated in Fig. 5.28.

IV-216

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 5.26—Packing sequence with brine carrier fluids in wells less than 45°.14

Fig. 5.27—Packing sequence with brine carrier fluids in wells at 60° deviation.14

As the well deviation exceeds 60°, a gravel dune forms initially at the top of the comple-
tion  interval  and  is  propagated  sequentially  downwards  from  the  top  to  the  bottom  of  the
completion  interval.  This  occurs  because  the  angle  of  repose  has  been  exceeded,  and  gravity
becomes a more dominant force that causes a gravel dune to form in the completion interval.
To  ensure  propagation  of  the  dune,  the  ratio  of  the  washpipe  OD  to  the  screen  ID  must  be
larger than 0.70. The purpose of the large-diameter washpipe is to divert flow from the annulus
between the washpipe and the screen to the annulus outside the screen. Testing and field expe-
rience has confirmed that the ideal ratio is probably in the range of 0.70 to 0.80. Additionally,
the return flow rate to the cross-sectional area ratio (between the screen and the casing) should

and small-diameter washpipe.14

be at least 1 ft/sec to supply sufficient transport velocity. This is referred to as the superficial
velocity. If the ratio of washpipe OD to screen ID is too small, excess fluid will divert into in
the  annulus  between  the  screen  and  the  washpipe  and  the  gravel  dune  will  stall  high  in  the
completion  interval,  resulting  in  a  “premature  sandout”  (see  Fig.  5.29).  Fig.  5.30  shows  the
effect of washpipe to screen diameter ratios on gravel placement efficiency. If the ratio of wash-
pipe  OD  to  screen  ID  is  too  large,  sticking  the  washpipe  is  a  concern,  as  well  as  potentially
high  pump  pressures  during  the  final  stages  of  gravel  placement.  A  schematic  of  the  gravel
packing process, in wells greater than 60° when a large diameter washpipe is used, is illustrat-
ed in Fig. 5.31. This figure shows the dune deposited and propagated along the low side of the
hole  (sequences  1  to  10)  until  it  reaches  the  end  of  the  completion  interval  (alpha  wave).  At
this point a secondary deposition (beta wave) backfills and packs the volume above the alpha
wave to complete the gravel pack.

Gel  Transport  Fluids.    Simulations  with  gel  transport  fluids  were  also  performed  at  the
same well deviations previously discussed. The packing mechanisms with gel were more com-
plex  than  with  brine  because  viscous  forces  were  stronger.  At  0  to  45°,  the  high  viscosity  of
the  gel  allows  radial  packing  around  the  gravel-pack  screen  and  node  buildup  at  the  perfora-
tions.  At  screen  connections,  voids  were  commonly  observed.  But  the  voids  where  typically

diameter washpipe.14

filled by gravel settling after a few hours, provided that the well deviation was less than about
60°. As with brine, perforation packing was complete but occurred only if the perforation expe-
rienced fluid leakoff. At deviations greater than 60°, voids persisted in areas where incomplete
slurry  dehydration  occurred  (opposite  screen  joint  connections  or  unperforated  sections  of  the
interval). Unlike the lower deviation simulations, gravel pack, settling at deviations greater than
60°,  resulted  in  voids  along  the  top  of  the  gravel  pack,  as  Fig.  5.32  shows.  When  the  voids
occurred opposite the perforations, gravel-pack sand placed in the perforations would be unload-
ed  into  the  voids  when  production  occurred.  Under  actual  conditions,  these  phenomena  result
in either sand production or localized filling of the perforation tunnels with formation sand that
will severely restrict productivity. Observations were that gravel packing with brine produces a
pack with a porosity of about 37%. The porosity of gel packs is about 42% and can be higher
if there are voids.

Transport Fluid Summary.  Based on the results of laboratory testing and field experience,
brine exhibits more complete packing of the perforations and annulus under a wide variety of
well conditions and is considered by most to be a general-purpose gravel-pack fluid. Gel trans-
port  fluids  should  be  limited  to  use  in  wells  with  deviations  less  than  45°  and  gross  zone
lengths less than 50 ft in length.

5.9.3 Field Results.  The main objective of annular gravel placement is to effectively pack the
annulus  between  the  screen  and  the  casing  or  the  open  hole.  For  cased-hole  completions,  an
added objective is to pack the perforations with gravel because the latter significantly improves
well  productivity and  longevity. In  addition to  perforation packing, the  quality of  the  pack  in
the  screen/casing  annulus  is  important,  regardless  of  whether  the  well  is  completed  cased  or
openhole. Gravel-pack evaluation logs have demonstrated the superiority of brines over gels in
that lower pack porosities are achieved. Brine packs are also more uniform and do not contain
voids common with gels that have been verified by post-gravel-pack evaluation logs.

5.9.4 Gravel Packing With Shunts.  Because viscous fluids are still used for gravel packing,
particularly in frac-pack applications, there is concern about void formation in the annular grav-
el pack. A shunt system has been developed that may help solve the problems associated with
these  high-viscosity  fluids  (voids).16  The  shunts  are  actually  channels  or  conduits  that  are  de-
signed to transport gravel through the shunt when bridges are formed in the annulus. Fig. 5.33
is  an  example  of  a  shunt  activating  when  a  bridge  forms  in  the  annulus.  Note  that  the  shunt
(there can be a single or multiple shunt tubes) is attached to the outside of the screen.

The  shunt  can  be  run  either  in  cased-  or  openhole  configurations.  For  cased-hole  applica-
tions,  the  shunt  screens  are  usually  run  unprotected,  but  in  openhole  horizontals,  an  outer
shroud is added to protect the shunts when running in the hole. The shroud may also provide
centralization for openhole completions. The horizontal shunt-screen gravel packs are common-
ly  performed  in  the  squeeze  mode  (no  returns),  and  fracturing  is  believed  to  be  occurring
during  the  packing  process.  Reports  are  that  when  gravel  packing  with  shunt  screens  up  to

IV-220

35%,  excess  gravel  is  pumped  over  the  hole  volume.  Whether  this  means  that  the  excess
packed washouts occurred because of fracturing is not clear.

The burden of the additional hardware is increased weight, drag, and dimensional concerns;
this limits the diameter of the hole in which it can be run. For example, for a 4-in. pipe-base
screen, a 7-in. shroud encases the screen and the shunts. Hence, the minimum hole diameter in
which the screen assembly can be run is 8.5 in. For smaller diameters such as 6.125 in., which
is  probably  the  most  common  horizontal  openhole  diameter,  a  4.5-  to  5-in.  shroud  would  be
required.  For  this  shroud  diameter,  the  screen  diameter  (pipe  base)  would  probably  have  no
more than 2 in.—meaning the washpipe and shunt dimensions are also reduced. Hence, wash-
pipe and shunt friction pressure limit the length of the lateral that can be gravel packed for the
small hole sizes.

5.10 Prepacking the Perforations

5.10.1 Cased-Hole Gravel Packs.  Gravel packing cased-hole completions in vertical and devi-
ated  wells  are  more  common  than  openhole  completions,  particularly  in  shaley  reservoirs.
Reasons for this are several-fold: cased-hole completions are the norm in almost any develop-
ment because the reservoir is usually easier to manage, so remedial operations are simplified;
wellbore stability issues are minimal; and if multiple intervals are involved, openhole comple-
tions will not provide the necessary isolation.

However, cased-hole gravel packs have an important requirement that is easily overlooked.
The  perforations  must  be  prepacked  with  gravel  if  productivity  and  completion  longevity  is
desired.1 Not until the late 1980s was the importance of prepacking fully appreciated. The illus-
tration  shown  in  Fig.  5.34  is  an  example  of  prepacked  perforations.  Note  that  the  gravel  is
packed through each perforation and into the perforation tunnel beyond the cement sheath. Fig.
5.35  shows  the  benefit  of  prepacking.  This  information  was  taken  from  large-scale  laboratory
testing  studies  that  illustrated  the  pressure  drop  across  perforations  filled  with  1-darcy  forma-
tion  sand,  20:40  gravel and  20:40,  gravel that was  prepacked in  the  perforations.1 Tables 5.5
and 5.6 provide additional information. The lowest pressure drop through the perforations oc-

IV-222

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

curs  when  they  are  prepacked.  Lower  pressure  losses  across  the  perforation  not  only  affect
flow from the reservoir, but the larger wellbore pressure provides additional inflow pressure to
lift  fluids  to  the  surface.  Cased-hole  gravel  packs  that  have  not  been  prepacked  are  usually
damaged. There is no remedial treatment that can remove the damage (a frac pack can bypass
the  damage),  leading  to  a  well  that  will  be  permanently  restricted  unless  a  workover  is  per-
formed  to  prepack  the  completions  and  complete  the  well  properly.  Table  5.7  verifies  this
scenario with field data and shows the superiority of wells that were prepacked.

Prepacking can be defined as any method that intentionally places gravel into the perfora-
tion tunnels. Filling of perforation tunnels can be accomplished either with a dedicated opera-
tion  before  performing  the  gravel  pack  or  simultaneously  with  it.  The  technique  used  is
normally  dictated  by  well  parameters,  such  as  excessive  fluid  loss,  an  extended  rathole  area,
reservoir acid sensitivity, zone length, etc. An additional concern that must be addressed is the
question  of  what  transport  fluid  to  use  for  the  prepacking  operation.  Regardless  of  the  tech-
nique  selected,  to  effectively  pack  the  perforations,  one  critical  condition  must  be  met:  there
must  be  fluid  loss  through  the  perforation.  Fig.  5.36  shows  the  effects  of  the  leakoff  rate  on
the amount of gravel prepacked. Data also show that the well deviation is not a factor on the
amount of gravel placed.

5.10.2 Choice of Fluids.  Provided  that  there  is  leakoff,  any  fluid  can  be  used.  The  packing
sequences, 1 to 7, when brine and viscous fluids are used, are shown in Figs. 5.37 and 5.38.
The two are slightly different because of the viscosity of the fluid. Viscous fluids suspend and
transport the gravel completely to the end of the perforation tunnel and then pack back toward
the  entrance  of  the  perforation.  Note  the  node  at  the  entrance  of  the  perforation  caused  by
viscous forces in Fig. 5.37. With brine, the gravel is initially deposited at the entrance of the
perforation,  and  subsequent  packing  takes  place  over  the  top  of  the  dune  until  it  reaches  the

Fig. 5.37—Perforation filling with viscous transport fluid.14

end  of  the  perforation.  The  last  volume  to  be  prepacked  is  that  over  the  dune.  The  obvious
question  at  this  point  is  which  fluid  should  be  used,  or  which  is  the  best?  The  question  has
many operating implications. However, field data from prepacking operations, conducted at ma-
trix rates, show that brines are superior because they pack more gravel.

5.10.3 Prepacking Below Fracture Pressure.  To prepack below fracture pressure, the perfora-
tions  must  be  clean  and  contain  no  debris.  There  must  be  leakoff  into  the  formation.  A  void
outside the perforation is desirable.

IV-224

Viscous Fluid Gravel Packs.  These completions consist of gravel packing with viscous gels
—slurry  packs  in  which  there  is  no  dedicated  procedure  to  prepack  the  perforations.  Any
prepacking  that  occurs  is  simultaneous  with  the  gravel  pack.  Example  field  results  using  this
approach (Fig. 5.39a17) for a project in southeast Asia reflect the performance in terms of the
skin  factors  measured  after  completion.18  Some  wells  performed  exceptionally  well  (i.e.,  the
skin factor was small), while others were disappointing. Completion success was inconsistent.
The average of the data indicated a skin factor of about 24 or a flow efficiency of 25%, which
is common for gel packs. Whether the problem with well performance was a lack of prepack-
ing or damage caused by other factors is not known. Acidizing is probably the only alternative
for restoring production for this example, but it will never restore reservoir capacity if the per-
forations are not prepacked.

Acid Prepacking.  Acid prepacking has been used to improve productivity. A critical aspect
of  a  successful  damage  removal  procedure  is  that  the  acid  must  come  into  contact  with  the
entire interval. In addition, it has been commonly thought that contact time must be sufficient
to allow all of the damage to be dissolved. With these assumptions, during the mid-1980s, acid
prepacking quickly evolved into a process in which a diverted acid treatment was pumped at a
low rate. Several studies indicated that one of the most effective diverters for acid prepacking
is to carry relatively small quantities of sand in an HEC gel. While this combination did pro-
vide good diversion, the well test results, shown in Fig. 5.39b, tended to be inconsistent. Poor
perforation filling from injecting a sand/gel slurry into the perforations at a low rate, coupled
with formation damage, resulting from the use of HEC, are the most likely causes for the ele-
vated  skins.  The  detrimental  effects  of  questionable  perforation  filling  can  easily  overpower
any benefit obtained from using the acid.

Dedicated Prepack Operations.  High matrix injection rates and the use of nonviscous trans-
port fluids are two techniques that have been demonstrated to improve perforation filling. The
traditional acid prepacking techniques violate both of these conditions. If the perforation filling
is indeed critical for cased-hole gravel packs, completion methods that focus on filling perfora-
tions should prove superior to those that sacrifice perforation filling for damage removal. Fig.
5.40 illustrates this point. Here the skin factors from 55 Gulf of Mexico wells19 are shown, 42
of which were prepacked at matrix rates with a 20 lbm/1,000 gal HEC (slickwater) fluid. Typi-
cal prepack volumes were about 40 lbm/ft. An annular brine gravel pack followed prepacking.
The  remaining  wells  were  completed  with  a  water  prepack  and  an  annular  brine  pack.  The
wells  completed  with  the  gel  prepack  required  post-gravel-pack  acid  to  achieve  the  perfor-

mance  reported  in  Fig.  5.40.  However,  the  transport  fluid  was  able  to  easily  leak  off  to  the
formation, and high injection rates were used to enhance placement of gravel in the perforation
tunnels.  The  data  presented  indicate  that  not  only  are  the  average  skin  factors  reduced  com-
pared to slurry packing and acid prepacking (Figs. 5.39b and 5.40), but the overall consistency
was also improved (especially for high-permeability thick formations). These data demonstrate
that when prepacking below fracture pressure, it is more important to ensure that as many per-
forations  as  possible  are  completely  filled  with  gravel-pack  sand  than  for  the  damage  to  be

removed. However, it must be remembered that improved well performance will result if dam-
age can be effectively removed without jeopardizing the filling of the perforations.

5.10.4 Prepacking Above Fracture Pressure.  One  of  the  main  detriments  to  prepacking  be-
low fracture pressure is that gravel can only be placed into voids created during underbalanced
perforating  or  perforation  cleanup.  If  the  amount  of  penetration  into  the  formation  does  not
extend completely through the near-wellbore damaged zone, restricted well productivity results.
To overcome this difficulty, it becomes necessary to remove the damage with acid. This is not
always  easily  accomplished  if  sufficient  gravel  has  not  been  prepacked.  Another  technique  to
eliminate the effects of the damaged zone is to bypass it rather than to attempt to remove it.
This is accomplished by hydraulically inducing a fracture in which the orientation is normal to
the least principal stress in the formation.

Techniques  available  to  create  these  fractures  include  brine  fracturing  or  a  frac  pack.  To
allow  frac  packing  and  water  fracs  to  be  distinguished,  a  description  of  these  techniques  is
discussed next.

Frac Pack.  A fracture with a length of about 100 ft can be created with a viscous transport
fluid, but typical lengths are usually shorter. High pump rates are typically used (15 to 20 bbl/
min), with proppant concentration increasing from 12 to 15 lbm/gal. The total amount of grav-
el pumped is typically in excess of 1,000 lbm/ft. Horsepower requirements may exceed 5,000
hydraulic horsepower (hhp) but are commonly lower.

Water Frac.  A fracture with a length between 5 and 15 ft can be created with a low-viscos-
ity  (brine)  transport  fluid.  Pump  rates  are  higher  than  for  conventional  gravel  packing  but
usually lower than a frac pack. Typical pump rates are in the range of 8 to 12 bbl/min. Prop-
pant loading is held constant between 1 and 2 lbm/gal, and total job size is typically from 100
to 150 lbm/ft. These treatments can be multistaged to further enhance the ability to effectively
treat  several  sand  subintervals  with  a  single  treatment.  Horsepower  requirements  are  typically
about 1,000 hhp.

Treatment  Comparison.    From  the  description  of  these  prepacking  treatments,  frac  packs
are significantly larger than water fracs. The frac packs appear to reach much farther out in the
reservoir  as  a  consequence  of  the  longer  fracture  lengths,  while  the  water  fracs  focus  is  near
the  wellbore.  The  amount  of  fracture  length  required  is  a  question  that  arises.  Many  propose
that bigger is better.20

When  water  is  used  as  the  fracturing  fluid,  short,  narrow  fractures  are  created  because  of
the  fluid’s  low  viscosity  that  results  in  a  hydraulic  fluid  efficiency  less  than  5%.  With  frac
packs,  the  fluid  efficiency  is  in  the  range  of  about  25%  because  viscosified  fluids  reduce
leakoff. Also, frac packs are designed for a tip screenout that ceases fracture length extension
before the end of the treatment. Continued pumping with high gravel concentrations is intended
to increase the width of the fracture to increase fracture conductivity.

The gravel placement geometry in a water-frac treatment forms an equilibrium gravel bank
similar to that shown in Fig. 5.41. Frac packs pumped in viscous fluids at high gravel concen-
trations  also  probably  have  a  small  equilibrium  gravel  bank,  but  substantially  more  of  the
gravel  tends  to  be  suspended  in  the  fracture  at  higher  concentrations,  which  provides  for  the
wide fractures after closure.

Both treatments can be pumped in either a single step or two steps. In the single-step ap-
proach, the formation is fractured and subsequently gravel packed in one pumping sequence. In
the  two-step  method,  the  fracturing  and  the  annular  gravel  are  performed  separately.  Of  the
two alternatives, the single-step method is preferred because it is less expensive and time con-
suming.

There are proponents of both fracture prepacking methods. Some prefer the frac packs be-
cause they believe that the longer, wider fractures provide less risk of a low-productivity well.
Proponents of water fracs cite lower costs and operations conducted with platform-based equip-
ment as advantages. From the standpoint of productivity improvement (stimulation) in the high-
permeability wells, long fractures are not required, and fracture conductivity is more significant
than length, provided the fracture extends past the damage.

Probably the best way to compare the benefits of the various prepack treatments is to com-
pare their relative performance based on experience in the field. Figs. 5.42 and 5.43 compare
frac  packs  and  water  fracs.  Because  there  is  a  wide  discrepancy  in  their  designs  and  fracture

geometry, one might think that the frac packs with long, wide fractures would provide a superi-
or result. While there are similarities between the techniques, comparing the results of the frac
packs to the water fracs reveals that the skin distributions are almost identical. These data strong-
ly  suggest  that  the  main  benefit  of  either  treatment  is  perforation  prepacking  and  damage
bypass,  regardless  of  which  prepack  technique  is  implemented.  Credence  to  this  viewpoint  is
that neither of the fracture prepack methods produces completions with large negative skin fac-
tors  that  have  been  achieved  with  conventional  fracturing  in  consolidated  formations.  Skin
factors below –1 are rare for any cased-hole gravel pack.

5.11 Openhole Gravel Packing
Openhole  completions  provide  another  opportunity  for  sand  control.  Many  engineers  do  not
routinely think of performing an openhole completion when confronted with selecting a comple-
tion. This is true probably because cased-hole completions are so widely accepted and because
they  are  not  familiar  with  selection  criteria  and  procedures.  However,  openhole  completions
provide excellent, high-productivity completions, but they must be applied under the right reser-
voir conditions. They avoid the difficulties and concerns of perforation packing and reduce the
gravel-placement operations to the relatively simple task of packing the screen/openhole annu-
lus. Because openhole gravel packs have no perforation tunnels, formation fluids can converge
toward  and  through  the  gravel  pack  radically  from  360°,  eliminating  the  high  pressure  drop
associated with linear flow through perforation tunnels. The reduced pressure drop through an
openhole  gravel  pack  virtually  guarantees  that  it  will  be  more  productive  than  a  cased-hole
gravel  pack  in  the  same  formation,  provided  they  are  executed  properly.  Fig.  5.44  illustrates
the theoretical pressure drops experienced in openhole and cased-hole gravel packs. It reveals
that openhole gravel packs result in virtually no additional pressure drop as the formation flu-
ids converge at the wellbore.

5.11.1 Guidelines  for  Selecting  Openhole  Gravel-Pack  Candidates.    Despite  their  potential
for  creating  high-productivity  wells,  openhole  gravel  packs  are  not  suitable  for  all  reservoirs
and  formations.  One  disadvantage  of  the  openhole  completion  (including  openhole  gravel
packs)  is  the  inability  to  always  isolate  unwanted  water  and/or  gas  production.  Unlike  cased-
hole  completions  that  can  be  precisely  and  selectively  perforated  in  the  zones  of  interest,
openhole completions sometimes offer less control over fluids (water, oil, and gas) exposed to
the wellbore. Furthermore, remedial operations (such as squeeze cementing, plugbacks, or strad-
dle  packoffs)  to  isolate  unwanted  fluid  production  can  be  carried  out  with  a  reasonably  good
chance of success with little to no planning in a cased-hole well. Such remedial operations in
an openhole well (with the exception of a plugback) require additional planning to isolate unde-
sirable fluids. With this in mind, openhole completions are best suited for thick reservoir sands
rather than multiple sand reservoirs where there is water and/or gas to contend with.

Maintaining borehole stability during drilling and completion is an essential requirement for
openhole  gravel  packs.  Concern  over  the  lack  of  borehole  stability  is  a  primary  reason  that
openhole gravel packs are not used more often in unconsolidated, dilatant formations. Unstable
boreholes  make  running  of  the  gravel-pack  assembly  difficult  and  may  prevent  proper  gravel
placement if the formation flows in around the screen. Fortunately, state-of-the-art drill-in flu-

ids are usually effective in maintaining borehole stability while performing a horizontal comple-
tion in dilatant-type formations.

Openhole gravel packs should be avoided in formations with several sand and shale lamina-
tions  if  the  shales  are  prone  to  uncontrollable  eroding  and/or  sloughing.  During  gravel  place-
ment,  the  shale  can  intermix  with  the  gravel-pack  sand,  resulting  in  reduced  gravel
permeability and impaired well performance. Again, proper drill-in fluid selection can alleviate
some of the problems associated with laminated sand and shale formations. The guidelines for
selecting openhole gravel-pack candidates are listed next.

• Formations where cased-hole gravel packing has unacceptable productivity.
• Wells where increased productivity is required.
• Reservoirs where long, sustained single-phase hydrocarbon flow is anticipated.
• Situations where workovers for isolating gas or water cannot be accomplished.
• Wells where high water/oil or gas/oil ratios can be tolerated.
• Reservoirs with single uniform sands (avoid multiple sands interspersed with troublesome

shale layers or water sands).

• Formations that can be drilled and completed maintaining borehole stability in the comple-

tion interval.

wells).

• Wells where cased-hole completions are significantly more expensive (i.e., long horizontal

5.11.2 Top-Set  Openhole  Gravel  Pack.    The  most  common  type  of  openhole  completion  is
referred  to  as  “top  set,”  which  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  5.45.  While  this  figure  shows  a  vertical
completion,  this  discussion  is  also  pertinent  to  openhole  horizontal  wells.  In  this  completion,
the  production  casing  is  set  at  the  top  of  the  completion  interval  to  isolate  overlying  strata.
Once  the  casing  is  cemented,  the  productive  formation  is  drilled  to  total  depth;  the  hole  is
cleaned and displaced; and the gravel pack is installed. Critical issues in top-set openhole grav-
el  packs  include:  selecting  the  casing  seat,  drilling  the  open  hole,  underreaming  if  necessary,
and cleaning the hole and gravel packing. See the chapter on completion design in this section
of the Handbook.

5.11.3 Selecting the Casing Seat.   Selecting  the  casing  seat  at  the  proper  depth  can  have  a
significant  impact  on  the  success  and  cost  of  an  openhole  completion.  Normally,  the  casing
should be set at the top of the reservoir, just barely into the productive interval. If the overly-
ing  formation  is  an  unstable  or  sloughing  (heaving)  shale,  failure  to  isolate  the  shale  behind
casing may cause problems and delays throughout the remainder of the completion. Well logs

Chapter 5—Sand Control

IV-231

should be run to ensure that all offending strata have been penetrated and will be cased before
running  the  casing.  In  some  instances,  several  logging  runs  may  be  required  as  the  well  is
deepened  to  determine  exactly  when  the  casing  should  be  run.  In  the  case  of  logging  while
drilling, the casing point can be easily picked without multiple logging runs. Alternatively, the
well can be drilled to total depth and logged to determine the appropriate casing depth. Then a
sand plug can be placed across the productive interval before cementing the casing.

5.11.4 Drilling the Open Hole.  Several options are available for drilling the openhole comple-
tion  interval.  How  this  is  performed  and  the  type  of  fluids  used  depend  on  the  mineral  and
fluid  content  of  the  formation  (i.e.,  whether  it  is  sensitive  to  the  drilling  and/or  completion
fluid).  Another  factor  is  whether  to  enlarge  the  hole  by  underreaming.  The  fluid  used  for
drilling the open hole is critical to the success of the completion. The general requirements of
an ideal drill-in (or underreaming) fluid, which apply to any openhole completion and are not
specific  to  gravel  packs,  are  compatibility  with  the  reservoir  rock  and  fluids  (nondamaging);
good  suspension  properties;  low  friction  loss;  low  fluid  loss;  easily  controlled  density;  ready
availability;  low  cost;  ease  of  mixing  and  handling;  nontoxicity;  and  thin  friable  filter  cakes
with low breakout pressure.

While  most  fluids  do  not  have  all  of  these  properties,  some,  such  as  calcium  carbonate
brine fluids, have performed well as drill-in and underreaming fluids. The critical issue is that
the drill-in fluid should do minimal irreversible damage to the face of the formation. The solid-
laden fluids should quickly form a filter cake to minimize filtrate losses. The filter cake should
be easily removable before or after gravel packing. The ease with which it is removed is reflect-
ed in a low breakout pressure. Breakout pressure is reached when drawdown pressure, required
to  initiate  production  after  the  formation,  has  been  mudded  off  with  the  drill-in  fluid.  In  rare
cases, clear brines have been acceptable as nondamaging drill-in fluids. If the open hole is to
be underreamed, standard drilling mud may be used as a drill-in fluid, provided that the under-
reaming  operation,  using  calcium  carbonate  brine-based  systems,  removes  the  mud-invaded,
damaged portion of the formation.

5.11.5 Underreaming.    Underreaming  is  the  operation  of  enlarging  the  hole  size  below  the
casing  shoe.  One  reason  for  underreaming  an  open  hole  is  to  remove  damage  present  in  the
pilot  hole.  Underreaming  may  be  unnecessary  if  the  pilot  hole  is  drilled  with  a  nondamaging
fluid. The larger-diameter hole also enhances the well productivity slightly, but in most cases,
this  is  insignificant.  Underreaming  may  be  performed  simply  to  provide  greater  clearance  be-
tween  the  screen  and  the  open  hole.  In  any  event,  underreaming  should  be  performed  with  a
nondamaging fluid that keeps the hole stable. Traditional drilling muds should be used only as
a last alternative, and damage-removal treatments should be planned before placing the well on
production if these muds are used.

Underreaming is usually more of an annoyance than an incremental time, cost, or productiv-
ity  issue  because  a  cased-hole  completion  also  requires  changing  over  to  a  clean  fluid  before
perforating. Perforating, of course, is unnecessary. Underreaming and perforating usually offset
each other in incremental costs.

In the event that running a liner across the completion interval at a later date is an option
to isolate unwanted fluids, underreaming probably should be avoided. The cement sheath in an
underreamed hole will be much thicker than normal and will interfere with effective perforat-
ing  or  make  perforating  operations  more  difficult.  The  difficulties  are  that  perforating,  or
ineffective  perforations,  will  adversely  affect  gravel  packing  and,  subsequently,  will  restrict
well productivity.

5.11.6 Hole  Cleaning.    Solids  can  be  drill-in  fluids,  drill  solids,  and  gravel-pack  sand.  The
importance  of  cleaning  the  hole  and  the  filter  cake  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.46.  This  bar  graph  is

IV-232

based  on  field  data  collected  from  10  wells  and  shows  the  relationship  between  completion
skin and hole cleaning. This relationship is not too surprising, but what is often overlooked is
that once a well is damaged, subsequent acid treatments increase productivity but will not yield
an undamaged well. Before running the screen in the hole and gravel packing, it is necessary
to remove the drill-in fluid, drill solids from the hole, clean the hole, and scour the filter cake
to its dynamic thinness.

5.11.7 Set-Through Openhole Gravel Pack.  When accurately setting the casing depth is diffi-
cult  or  secondary  pay  zones  exist  above  the  primary  target,  set-though  openhole  completions
can  be  applied.  In  this  type  of  completion,  the  casing  is  run  through  all  formation  pay  zones
and cemented in place. Cased- and openhole well logs are used to determine the exact location
of the pay zones behind the casing, and windows are milled (with a nondamaging fluid) oppo-
site the completion interval to create an “openhole” environment. The well can then be gravel
packed. Schematics of example set-through-type completions are shown in Fig. 5.47. Because
of  the  amount  of  debris  created  by  milling  casing  windows,  it  is  recommended  that  all  set-
through openhole completions be underreamed to expose a clean, nondamaged formation face.
A requirement in applying set-through-type completions is a good cement job. The casing must
be securely cemented to facilitate milling operations and maintain alignment between the upper
casing and the lower casing sections. Because a sump packer can be used, a set-through gravel
pack assembly is basically the same as a cased-hole type. The only exception would be the use
of bow-spring-type centralizers in long openhole sections. Set-through-type completions are es-
pecially well suited for recompletions in existing wells.

5.11.8 Gravel Packing Openhole Completions.  To gravel pack an openhole completion, fol-
low the well preparation and gravel placement guidelines previously discussed.

5.12 Sand Control in Horizontal and Long-Throw Highly-Deviated Wells
Horizontal well completions have been attempted in a myriad of reservoir situations to increase
well  productivity,  improve  reservoir  management,  and  access  incremental  reserves  that  could
not be developed economically with vertical wells. While the first horizontal wells were drilled
in competent formations, eventually soft formations were completed horizontally. Practically all
horizontal wells drilled in soft formations have been completed openhole. Most of these bore-

holes did not collapse; however, because many of these completions were in formations, where
conventional  sand-control  applications  were  practiced,  slotted  liners  and  wire-wrapped  or
prepacked  screens  were  run  to  prevent  hole  collapse  and  sand  production  because  horizontal
gravel-pack technology was not yet available.

5.12.1 Stand-Alone Slotted Liner and Screen Completions.  The  typical  procedure  for  com-
pleting horizontal wells with slotted liners and screens is to drill the well to the casing seat, set
casing, drill the horizontal section, displace the hole, run the screen, and then produce the well.
It is not always this simple, but the intent should be to follow these guidelines.

Sand-control horizontal wells were originally dealt with by using stand-alone slotted liners,
screens,  and,  more  recently,  proprietary  screens.  The  initial  productivity  of  these  completions
was usually acceptable, and some were outstanding; however, in most applications, the stand-
alone  devices  either  plugged  or  cut  out  (eroded)  with  time.  The  consequences  are  either
unacceptably  low  well  rates  or  excessive  sand  production.  The  acknowledged  stand-alone
screen failure rate in the Gulf of Mexico was estimated to be about 25% in 1996. Since that
time, numerous additional failures have occurred, and the failure rate has increased substantial-
ly.  Hence,  in  most  applications,  the  use  of  stand-alone  screens  as  retention  devices  has  been
disappointing  because  the  stand-alone  screen  approach  forces  them  to  perform  as  filters  (see
Fig. 5.48). Their use in horizontals confirmed previous stand-alone experience in vertical wells
—they  plugged.  Many  screen  designs  were  progressively  used  to  determine  if  particular  de-
signs would improve performance: slotted liners, wire-wrapped screens, prepacked screens, and
the high inflow-area proprietary screens. As might be expected, these completions experienced
a wide range of reservoir situations. Some stand-alone applications have performed exceptional-
ly  well.  The  exceptional  wells  (mainly  in  the  North  Sea)  had  formation  permeabilities  in  the

range of 10 to 12 darcy and were well sorted. Experience in the Gulf of Mexico with stand-
alone  screen  completions  has  been  disappointing;  the  failure  rate  from  these  completions  has
been well over 70% as of 2000.

In many horizontal wells where stand-alone screens have been used, there are implications
that  the  formation  does  not  collapse  around  the  screen.  When  this  happens,  there  is  an  open
annulus that serves as a conduit for fluid and particulate transport along the entire length of the
screen. There are many examples in which a stand-alone screen completion produced extreme-
ly  well  for  a  period  of  time  and,  then,  abruptly  lost  productivity.  The  screens  appear  to  be
progressively plugging; however, because of the high flow capacity per foot of screen, a short
section of unplugged screen can handle enormous flow rates. When the last few increments of
screen plug, either production ceases or the screen erodes. Fig. 5.49 displays an example.

To combat these problems, technology has been developed to gravel pack horizontal wells
because gravel packing can sustain productivity. Gravel packing has always been the state-of-the-
art technology for vertical wells. Gravel-pack technology was not available for horizontal wells
until 1995, but its acceptance has been steadily increasing and is now the preferred technique.
In this service, the screen functions as a gravel-retention device, and the gravel placed around
the  screen  fills  and  stabilizes  the  borehole.  The  streamlines  into  the  screen  are  now  normal
because  the  annulus  between  the  screen  and  the  open  hole  is  filled  with  gravel,  as  Fig.  5.50
suggests. The result is sustained productivity.

5.12.2 Horizontal Gravel Packing.  Gravel packing offers another option for completing a hor-
izontal  well  when  sand  production  represents  a  problem.  The  original  perception  was  that
technology was not available for gravel packing long, horizontal completions, and other alterna-
tives,  such  as  stand-alone  screens,  had  to  suffice.  This  is  contrary  to  the  fact  that  the  perfor-
mance  of  stand-alone  screens  had  been  unacceptable  in  conventional  wells.  One  of  the  most
disturbing examples, portrayed in Table 5.8, shows failure statistics and average pressure drops
across 43 stand-alone screen completions in horizontal wells in the Gulf of Mexico. Of these,
15 (35%) were classified as failures, but the remaining active wells are producing at an aver-
age pressure drop of 545 psi. Taken from the perspective of the flow capacities of screens that
were previously discussed, the remaining wells, while still producing and not reported as fail-
ures, are also plugged.

Horizontal  gravel-pack  technology  was  developed21  in  the  mid-1990s.  Studies  were  per-
formed  in  a  field-scale  model  that  was  1,500  ft  long  and  instrumented  with  data  acquisition;
they  also  contained  visual  observations  of  the  packing  process  through  high-strength  plastic
sections in the model. A typical plot of the location of the alpha and beta waves (see the sec-
tion  on  gravel  placement  techniques),  as  a  function  of  time  for  a  horizontal  gravel  pack,  is
illustrated in Fig. 5.51. The figure demonstrates that the entire 1,500-ft model was packed with

IV-236

Fig. 5.52—Dune height in a wellbore.20

gravel. Testing clearly revealed that the height of the alpha wave was not constant with pack
length, as had been implied from studies conducted in short models. Instead, the height of the
alpha wave was inclined upward from the heel to the toe of the model as Fig. 5.52 illustrates.
The  reason  for  the  inclination  is  a  result  of  fluid  loss  that  reduces  the  annular  flow  velocity
and  increases  the  gravel  concentration,  thereby  reducing  the  gravel  transport  efficiency.  The
consequence was an increase in the alpha-wave dune height with length. Having this data pro-
vided  valuable  information  for  designing  horizontal  gravel  packs.  If  the  top  of  the  borehole
interferes with deposition over the top of the alpha wave, deposition stalls, and beta-wave depo-
sition begins at the stall location (Fig. 5.53). To avoid a premature stall, the superficial annular
velocity  must  be  maintained  above  1  ft/sec,  based  on  return  flow  through  the  washpipe.  The
superficial velocity is defined as the ratio of the return flow rate through the washpipe to the
annular  area  between  the  washpipe  and  the  wellbore.  Provided  that  the  design  of  the  gravel
pack is correct and a superficial velocity of 1 ft/sec is maintained, gravel packing a long hori-
zontal  gravel  pack  can  be  performed  with  routine  procedures.  Gravel  deposition  (alpha-beta
wave) will proceed to the toe of the well, as Fig. 5.54 shows.

Horizontal  gravel  designs  are  available  that  utilize  the  concept  illustrated  in  Fig.  5.55,
which  shows  pressure  plotted  as  a  function  of  pump  rate.  The  fracture  pressure  is  identified,
and a treating pressure is shown. Note that at low rates, there is insufficient transport to initiate
alpha-wave transport, but at slightly higher pump rates, the alpha wave will prematurely stall.
However, at an acceptable pump rate, the entire alpha-beta wave deposition can be performed

to complete the gravel pack without fracturing the formation. Fracturing is manifest by a reduc-
tion in return through the wash pump and will stall the transport process.

5.12.3 Field Results.  As  of  the  year  2001,  over  400  horizontal  gravel  packs  have  been  per-
formed.  Most  of  these  completions  had  horizontal  lengths  of  1,500  to  2,000  ft.  The  longest
horizontal gravel pack performed as of mid-2001 has been 7,000 ft. The volume of gravel pack
in these completions is typically 20 to 30% greater than the theoretical volume, indicating that
the annulus is completely filled with gravel. The pack volume being greater than 100% is ac-
counted for by hole irregularities that are larger than the bit diameter. Similar experience has
been noted in vertical openhole gravel packs. In several applications of this technology, gravel
packs  were  run  behind  failed  stand-alone  screen  completions  that  lost  productivity.  After  the

IV-238

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

screen  was  removed  and  the  hole  was  displaced,  new  equipment  was  run,  and  the  well  was
gravel packed. The performance of the horizontal gravel packs has demonstrated that they main-
tain productivity compared to the stand-alone screen experience.

Formation Damage

6.1 Introduction
Any  unintended  impedance  to  the  flow  of  fluids  into  or  out  of  a  wellbore  is  referred  to  as
formation damage. This broad definition of formation damage includes flow restrictions caused
by a reduction in permeability in the near-wellbore region, changes in relative permeability to
the hydrocarbon phase, and unintended flow restrictions in the completion itself. Flow restric-
tions  in  the  tubing  or  those  imposed  by  the  well  partially  penetrating  a  reservoir  or  other
aspects  of  the  completion  geometry  are  not  included  in  this  definition  because,  although  they
may impede flow, they either have been put in place by design to serve a specific purpose or
do not show up in typical measures of formation damage such as skin.

Over  the  last  five  decades,  a  great  deal  of  attention  has  been  paid  to  formation  damage
issues  for  two  primary  reasons:  (1)  the  ability  to  recover  fluids  from  the  reservoir  is  affected
very strongly by the hydrocarbon permeability in the near-wellbore region, and (2) although we
do not have the ability to control reservoir rock properties and fluid properties, we have some
degree of control over drilling, completion, and production operations. Thus, we can make op-
erational  changes,  minimize  the  extent  of  formation  damage  induced  in  and  around  the  well-
bore, and have a substantial impact on hydrocarbon production. Being aware of the formation
damage implications of various drilling, completion, and production operations can help in sub-
stantially reducing formation damage and enhancing the ability of the well to produce fluids.

In  this  chapter,  we  discuss  methods  to  measure  and  to  quantify  the  extent  of  formation
damage  and  provide  criteria  that  can  be  used  to  identify  various  types  of  formation  damage.
The goal is to define the mechanisms involved better so that an operator can recommend and
design the correct remedial action and/or make changes to drilling, completion, and production
operations to minimize damage in the future. It is generally true that, whenever possible, pre-
venting  formation  damage  is  more  effective  than  remedial  treatments  such  as  acidizing  and
fracturing. We do not discuss such treatments in this chapter. However, for each type of dam-
age mechanism, potential remedial treatments are suggested.

6.2 Quantifying Formation Damage
A  commonly  used  measure  of  well  productivity  is  the  productivity  index,  J,  in  barrels  per
pounds per square inch:

IV-242

damage.7

J =

. ............................................................ (6.1)

The most commonly used measure of formation damage in a well is the skin factor, S. The
skin  factor is  a  dimensionless pressure  drop  caused  by  a  flow  restriction in  the  near-wellbore
region. It is defined as follows (in field units):

S =(

k h

141.2 qμB)Δpskin . ..................................................... (6.2)

Fig. 6.1 shows how flow restrictions in the near-wellbore region can increase the pressure
gradient, resulting in an additional pressure drop caused by formation damage (Δpskin). In 1970,
Standing1 introduced the important concept of well flow efficiency, F, which he defined as

F =

pR – pwf – Δpskin

PR – pwf

ideal drawdown
actual drawdown

. ...................................... (6.3)

Clearly, a flow efficiency of 1 indicates an undamaged well with Δpskin = 0, a flow efficien-
cy  >  1  indicates  a  stimulated  well  (perhaps  because  of  a  hydraulic  fracture),  and  a  flow
efficiency  <  1  indicates  a  damaged  well.  Note  that,  to  determine  flow  efficiency,  we  must
know the average reservoir pressure, pR, and skin factor, S. Methods to measure these quanti-
ties are discussed in Sec. 6.3.

The impact of skin on well productivity can be estimated by the use of inflow performance
relationships (IPRs) for the well such as those proposed by Vogel,2 Fetkovich,4 and Standing.1
These IPRs can be summarized as follows5:

pR

. .............................................................. (6.5)

When x = 0, a linear IPR model is recovered; when x = 0.8, we obtain Vogel’s IPR; and
when  x  =  1,  Fetkovich’s  IPR  model  is  obtained.  An  example  of  a  plot  for  the  dimensionless
hydrocarbon production as a function of the dimensionless bottomhole pressure (IPR) is shown
in Fig. 6.2 for different flow efficiencies. It is evident that, as flow efficiency decreases, small-
er and smaller hydrocarbon rates are obtained for the same drawdown (pR – pwf).

The choice of the IPR used depends on the fluid properties and reservoir drive mechanism.
Standing’s  IPR  is  most  appropriate  for  solution-gas-drive  reservoirs,  whereas  a  linear  IPR  is
more  appropriate  for  waterdrive  reservoirs  producing  at  pressures  above  the  bubblepoint  and
for hydrocarbons without substantial dissolved gas. A more detailed discussion of this is provid-
ed in Ref. 3.

6.3 Determination of Flow Efficiency and Skin
It is evident that, to quantify formation damage and to study its impact on hydrocarbon produc-
tion, one must have reasonable estimates of the flow efficiency or skin factor. Several methods

IV-244

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

have been proposed to evaluate these quantities for oil and gas wells. The most common meth-
ods  are  multirate  tests,  isochronal  gas-well  tests,  and  transient  well  tests  (pressure-buildup
analysis).

6.3.1 Multirate Tests.  Multirate  tests  can  be  conducted  on  both  oil  and  gas  wells.  In  these
tests, several stabilized flow rates, qi, are achieved at corresponding stabilized flowing bottom-
hole pressures, pwf. The simplest analysis considers two different stabilized rates and pressures.
The IPR can be written as

Simplifying and solving for the flow efficiency, F, we obtain

where x ≠ 0.

The above equation clearly shows that it is possible to obtain flow efficiency rather simply
with two stabilized bottomhole pressures and two stabilized flow rates. A similar analysis can
be performed to obtain an expression for a linear IPR (x = 0).

6.3.2 Multirate Tests in Gas Wells: Inertial Effects.  For many gas wells and some oil wells,
flow  rates  are  sufficiently  high  that  turbulent  or  inertial  pressure  drops  near  the  wellbore  can
be  significant.  In  such  cases,  the  additional  pressure  drop  measured  by  the  skin  can  be  con-
fused  with  the  pressure  drop  because  of  non-Darcy  or  inertial  flow.  It  is  very  important  to
separate out the pressure drop caused by turbulent flow from that caused by physical skin be-
cause  it  has  a  significant  impact  on  the  stimulation  recommendations  made  on  the  well.  To
analyze high-rate gas or oil wells, the following equation is needed.6

Darcy’s law for high-rate gas wells can be written as

qsc =

703 × 10−6 k h m(pR) − m(pwf )

2  represents an inertial or non-Darcy pres-
Here, Aqsc represents a laminar pressure drop and Bqsc
sure  drop  (sometimes  referred  to  as  a  turbulent  pressure  drop).  Note  that  A  contains  the
physical  skin,  S,  and  B  is  directly  proportional  to  the  non-Darcy  coefficient,  D.  By  plotting

multirate test data as a plot of 

 vs. qsc , we obtain A and B as an intercept and

slope, respectively. It is then possible to compare the magnitude of the pressure drop caused by
S with that caused by inertial effects, Dqsc.

If  S>Dqsc,  a  stimulation  treatment  would  be  recommended.  However,  if  Dqsc>S,  the  well
may need to be reperforated or fractured to increase the inflow area and to reduce inertial effects.

6.3.3 Isochronal Test in Gas Wells.  In  gas  wells  in  which  it  takes  a  long  time  to  achieve
stabilized rates, wells are shut in and produced for a fixed time interval (Δt) at several different
rates. These isochronal tests are then interpreted by the following “deliverability” relation,

qsc = c(pR

2 − pwf

2 )n, ........................................................ (6.11)

where  the  exponent  n  lies  between  0.5  and  1.  An  exponent  closer  to  0.5  indicates  that  non-
Darcy effects are important; an exponent close to 1 indicates that they are not.7

It should be noted that the “deliverability” equation is a variation of the equation derived in

the previous section.

6.3.4 Pressure-Buildup Analysis.  The most common method for determining skin is a pressure-
buildup test.7,8 In this test, a well that has been producing for a time, tp, is shut in for time Δt .
The  pressure  buildup  is  recorded  as  a  function  of  time.  By  constructing  a  Horner  plot7,8  like
the one shown in Fig. 6.3, we can compute the skin and the product of the permeability and
formation thickness, kh, of the reservoir (in field units).

Here, m is the slope of the straight-line portion of the Horner plot, and pws,1hr is the extrapolat-
ed shut-in pressure at a shut-in time of 1 hour.

It  is  also  possible  to  obtain  the  average  reservoir  pressure  with  the  Matthew,  Brons,  and
Hazelbrook method from the pressure-buildup data.9 Knowing both the average reservoir pres-
sure and skin, we can calculate the flow efficiency of the well. This method provides a direct
and quantitative measure of the extent of formation damage in a well.

Methods  following  the  same  principle  have  been  developed  for  deviated  and  horizontal
wells. Equations for analysis are more complex and are not discussed in this chapter. The same
methods can also be used to analyze data from gas wells and from wells on artificial lift.

The  short  discussion  presented  above  shows  how  near-wellbore  formation  damage  can  be
quantified  by  measurements  made  on  oil  and  gas  wells.  Such  measurements  are  essential  for
determining the extent and magnitude of the formation damage and its impact on hydrocarbon

production. However, these measures do not provide us with any clues on the reasons for the
formation damage. In subsequent sections in this chapter, reasons and mechanisms for forma-
tion  damage  and  strategies  to  minimize  the  impact  of  drilling  and  completion  operations  on
well productivity are discussed.

6.4 Formation Damage vs. Pseudodamage
Formation damage mechanisms can be broken down into two broad classes: near-wellbore per-
meability reduction and near-wellbore relative permeability changes. These changes can occur
under a variety of different circumstances. The following sections deal with different ways in
which permeability and relative permeability in the near-wellbore region are altered by drilling,
completion, and production operations.

Before we discuss formation damage mechanisms, it is important to clearly distinguish for-
mation damage from well completion and reservoir effects that are a consequence of how the
wellbore penetrates the reservoir and where the perforations are placed (sometimes referred to
as pseudoskin effects)10–13 and permeability loss as a result of depletion.14 Reservoir engineer-
ing models for limited-entry flow in partially penetrating wells are presented in several reser-
voir engineering texts such as Dake.10

The second major cause of pseudoskin is high-velocity flows near the wellbore, which in-
duces turbulence or inertial effects. As discussed in the previous section, turbulence or inertial
effects can lead to an additional turbulent pressure drop that needs to be clearly distinguished
from the pressure drop induced by a reduction in permeability. Finally, flow restrictions in the
wellbore  itself  such  as  chokes,  scale  buildup,  wax,  or  asphaltene  deposits  can  often  result  in
tubing pressure drops that are substantially larger than anticipated. This reduction in well pro-

Chapter 6—Formation Damage

ductivity is not commonly referred to as formation damage. Other types of production impair-
ment caused within the tubing are collapsed tubing or flow restrictions caused by mechanical
restrictions  such  as  corrosion  products;  poor  cement  jobs,  resulting  in  commingling  of  pro-
duced fluids from different zones; and insufficient tubing diameter or improper design of artificial-
lift  systems.  This  partial  list  provides  some  examples  of  flow  restrictions  caused  primarily  in
the tubing and should not typically be categorized as formation damage. They do not show up
in measures of formation damage such as skin, which are primarily measures of flow restric-
tions in the near-wellbore region.

In this chapter, flow restrictions in the completion itself such as the compacted zone around
perforation tunnels and plugged gravel packs are included in the discussion of formation dam-
age because they typically are measured as a well skin (Section 6.3).

6.5 Drilling-Induced Formation Damage
Drilling fluids serve to balance formation pressures while drilling to ensure wellbore stability.
They also carry cuttings to the surface and cool the bit. The drilling engineer traditionally de-
signs drilling fluids with two primary goals in mind: to ensure safe, stable boreholes, which is
accomplished by operating within an acceptable mud-weight window, and to achieve high rates
of penetration so that rig time and well cost can be minimized. Note that these primary consid-
erations do not include well productivity concerns. Over the past decade, a growing recognition
of  the  importance  of  drilling-induced  formation  damage  has  led  operators  to  mesh  the  objec-
tives of the drilling engineer with those of the production and reservoir engineers. This can be
achieved only if the design of the drilling program is a coordinated effort between drilling and
production engineers. The use of drill-in fluids (fluids used to drill through the pay zone) that
minimize formation damage has become widespread.

Drilling  and  well  productivity  concerns  are  addressed  in  the  design  of  drill-in  fluids.  To
meet well productivity objectives (i.e., to minimize formation damage), the drill-in fluid must
meet the following additional objectives: minimize the extent of solids invasion into the forma-
tion  by  bridging  across  the  pores  and  forming  a  thin,  low-permeability,  filter  cake;  minimize
the extent of filtrate and polymer invasion into the formation through the formation of an exter-
nal  filter  cake;  and  ensure  ease  of  removal  of  the  external  filter  cake  during  flowback  to
maximize  the  inflow  area  during  production  and  to  avoid  plugging  gravel  packs.  To  achieve
these goals, various strategies have been adopted. In this section, we address these strategies in
terms of the basic mud formulations being used. Traditional water-based muds, oil-based muds,
and  some  special  formulations  of  drill-in  fluids  for  fractured  formations  and  unconsolidated
sands are discussed. This is followed by a discussion of formation damage caused by drilling
in deviated and horizontal wells and the use of drill-in fluids for such applications.

6.5.1 Formation Damage Caused by Water-Based Muds.  The vast majority of drilling fluids
consist  of  bentonite  mixed  with  polymers  to  enhance  the  rheology  (or,  more  specifically,  the
cuttings-carrying  capacity  of  the  fluid),  starches  to  control  fluid  loss,  dissolved  salts  such  as
potassium chloride or sodium chloride, and perhaps a pH buffer to maintain the pH of the mud
to the desired level. A great deal of work has been done in the last three decades on evaluating
the  formation  damage  potential  of  water-based  drilling  fluids.15–19  The  following  factors  have
been observed to have an impact on the depth of invasion of solids and filtrate and therefore
on the extent and depth of formation damage or permeability impairment: the state of disper-
sion  of  solids  in  the  mud,  the  size  and  concentration  of  solids  and  polymers  in  the  mud,  the
pore  throat  size  or  permeability  of  the  formation,  the  pH  and  salinity  of  the  filtrate,  and  the
water sensitivity of the formation.

In most instances, the invasion of solids into the formation is limited to 2 or 3 in. from the
wellbore  wall,  which  implies  that  the  productivity  of  perforated  wells  with  relatively  shallow
depth of damage will not be significantly affected. Fig. 6.4 shows the productivity index (PI)

IV-248

damage by mud while drilling on well productivity when perforated with a nondamaging fluid is perme-

of a well for different depths of damage assuming an 8-in.-long perforation. It is evident that
as long as the depth of damage is smaller than the perforation length, the well PI is not signifi-
cantly affected. Wells that are completed openhole without stimulation are particularly suscepti-
ble to this kind of damage.

In  some  instances,  deep  penetration  of  drill  solids  can  occur.  Fig. 6.5  shows  the  depth  of
invasion  of  formation  damage  when  a  300-md  Berea  sandstone  core  is  subjected  to  dynamic
circulation of different water-based drilling fluids across its face.20 It is evident that, in overtreat-
ed  muds  (containing  too  much  thinner  or  dispersant),  dispersed  bentonite  particles  can  pene-
trate  through  >  8  in.  of  rock  and  cause  severe  and  irreversible  damage.  The  other  extreme,
flocculated muds (too little thinner or too much salt), will limit solids invasion but will result
in thick, high-permeability filter cakes. Filter cakes can result in such problems as stuck pipe

Chapter 6—Formation Damage

IV-249

Fig. 6.5—Depth of permeability damage caused by mud invasion for muds with different degrees of ben-
tonite dispersion. All muds contain 4% bentonite by weight.20

and large filtrate loss. The use of salts and thinners is, therefore, a critical part of the design of
drilling fluids for a given application. Appropriately conditioned muds must be used to elimi-
nate  the  possibility  of  solids  invasion  and  to  minimize  filtrate  invasion.  As  discussed  later,
using sized bridging solids is a powerful tool for reducing solids and polymer invasion.

Although  solids  invasion  clearly  is  detrimental  to  well  productivity,  filtrate  invasion  can
also lead to substantial formation damage and to greater depths in some instances. It has been
shown, for example,20,21 that the use of freshwater muds can result in filtrates that can be dam-
aging  to  water-sensitive  sandstones.  In  such  instances,  the  simple  process  of  increasing  the
salinity of the filtrate can prevent fines migration induced by filtrate leakoff. The loss of aque-
ous filtrates also results in a reduction in the relative permeability to the hydrocarbon phases.21
Such relative permeability effects are referred to as water-blocks and are discussed in the sec-
tion on formation damage resulting from emulsion and sludge formation.

Similarly, the use of polymers is widespread but can, in some instances, lead to formation
damage. Its been shown that the use of improper mixing producers in dissolving polymers into
brines can result in the formation of “fish eyes,” or unhydrated aggregates of polymer that can
be several microns in diameter. These particulate gels are very effective as plugging agents and
can lead to irreversible damage if not broken up and completely hydrated in the mud. Proper
conditioning and dispersal of polymers is of critical importance in the field.22–25

There is a limited database on the formation damage caused by starches and other polymers
such as xanthan or carboxymethylcellulose. These data indicate that the flow of such polymers
can  induce  a  substantial  reduction  in  permeability  as  a  result  of  constriction  of  pore  throats,
particularly in low-permeability formations.

6.5.2 Formation  Damage  Caused  by  Oil-Based  Muds.    Oil-based  muds  consist  of  water
droplets  dispersed  in  a  continuous  oil  phase.  The  water  droplets  are  stabilized  by  emulsifiers
and  organophilic  clays.  Standard  API  fluid  loss  tests  show  that  the  fluid  leakoff  rate  in  oil-
based muds is substantially lower than for water-based muds. However, as shown elsewhere,26
when  tests  are  conducted  on  oil-saturated  cores  (not  filter  paper),  leak-off  rates  for  oil-based
muds  can  be  comparable  to  those  for  water-based  muds.  One  important  conclusion  of  this
study is that API fluid leakoff tests should not be used to determine filtration rates in oil-based

IV-250

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

muds. Instead, dynamic filtration tests conducted on oil-saturated cores are much more represen-
tative.  The  relative  permeability  to  oil  in  oil-saturated  zones  is  high,  leading  to  large  leakoff
rates in the productive zone.26

The invasion of solids and oil droplets into the formation is determined largely by the effec-
tiveness  of  the  external  filter  cake  formed  by  organophilic  bentonite  and  water  droplets.  The
structure of the filter cake formed is substantially different from that of water-based muds. Wa-
ter droplets bridge across the pore throats to form the external filter cake. Because the droplets
are deformable, they can form very impermeable filter cakes, leading to good leakoff control.
However, if the overbalance pressure exceeds the capillary pressure needed to squeeze the wa-
ter  droplets  into  the  pores,  a  significant  loss  in  productivity  can  result.  To  prevent  this  from
happening, large overbalance pressures should be avoided.

Experimental studies have shown that the accumulation of drill solids in the mud results in
the introduction of fines that can be much more damaging than clean mud. Drill-solids control,
therefore, is an important issue in oil-based muds. In general, however, oil-based muds prove
to be excellent (albeit expensive) candidates for drilling gauge hole and providing high-produc-
tivity wells.26,27

It is important to recognize and identify damage caused by oil-based muds because the rec-
ommended treatment procedures for stimulating wells damaged by oil-based muds can be quite
different from those for wells damaged with water-based muds. Acidizing wells with conven-
tional acid formulations may not be successful and in fact may result in additional damage as a
result of the presence of emulsifiers in the filtrate. Solvent preflushes may need to be designed
on the basis of compatibility tests between the mud, crude oil, and acid formulation.

6.5.3 The Concept of Minimum Underbalance Pressure.  It is clear from the preceding discus-
sion that the formation of an external mud cake is important in protecting the formation from
solids  and  filtrate  invasion.  Are  there  conditions  under  which  an  external  mud  cake  will  not
form across the face of the formation? Yes, there are at least two situations in which an exter-
nal  filter  cake  does  not  form  across  of  the  face  of  the  formation:  (1)  lost  circulation  and  (2)
drilling overbalanced below the minimum overbalance pressure.

When  drilling  through  very-high-permeability  rocks  or  fractured  formations,  solids  present
in the drilling fluid may not be able to bridge across the face of the pores or fractures, result-
ing  in  leakoff  of  whole  mud  into  the  formation.13  This  leakoff  can  result  in  very  severe,
irreversible  damage  to  the  fracture  or  matrix.  In  general,  bridging  solids  are  added  to  the
drilling fluid to bridge across the pores or fractures. Sizing of these solids is discussed in more
detail in Ref. 18.

The  second  case  in  which  filter  cakes  do  not  form  is  less  intuitively  obvious.  To  form  a
mud cake, solids in the mud are pushed against the formation by a hydrodynamic force that is
proportional to the leakoff velocity. In addition, because of mud circulation, particles are con-
stantly  being  sheared  away  from  the  face  of  the  external  cake.  This  balance  between  the
hydrodynamic shearing action resulting from mud circulation and the fluid leakoff into the for-
mation results in an equilibrium cake thickness.28,29 Because the leakoff is proportional to the
overbalance pressure, smaller overbalance pressures will lead to smaller leakoff rates and thin-
ner external filter cakes, resulting in a minimum overbalance pressure below which no external
filter  cake  is  formed  at  all.  Alternatively  stated,  there  is  a  minimum  permeability  for  a  fixed
overbalance pressure below which no external filter cake will form. This suggests that we must
always drill either underbalanced or above the minimum overbalance pressure to ensure that an
external cake is formed and available to protect the formation when drilling through the produc-
tive zone. Additional details for calculating the minimum overbalance pressure are provided in
Ref. 29.

6.5.4 Mud-Induced Damage in Fractured Reservoirs.  When drilling through fractured forma-
tions,  large  quantities  of  whole  mud  can  be  lost  to  the  fracture  network,  resulting  in  fracture
plugging. Because fractures contribute almost all the productivity of such wells, it is important
to keep these fractures open as much as possible. In such cases, underbalanced drilling is rec-
ommended and frequently used. Underbalanced drilling allows fluids from the fracture to flow
into  the  wellbore,  keeping  the  fractures  relatively  undamaged.  If,  however,  because  of  safety
and regulatory constraints, underbalanced drilling is not possible, bridging additives need to be
added  to  the  mud  system  to  ensure  that  large-enough  particles  are  available  to  bridge  across
the  fracture  face.  The  bridging  additives  most  commonly  used  to  ensure  the  formation  of  a
bridge  across  the  fracture  face  are  calcium  carbonate  and  fibrous  additives  such  as  cellulosic
fibers  and  acid-soluble  fibers.30,31  Sizing  of  these  granular  or  fibrous  additives  has  been  dis-
cussed in detail in Refs. 30 and 31.

6.5.5 Formation Damage in Horizontal Wells.  Horizontal wells are more susceptible to forma-
tion damage than vertical wells for the following reasons.32,33

1. The  pay  zone  in  a  horizontal  wellbore  comes  into  contract  with  a  drilling  fluid  for  a

much longer period than a vertical pay zone (days compared with hours).

2. Most horizontal wells are openhole completions, which means that even shallow damage
that in a cased perforated completion would be bypassed by the perforations becomes significant.
3. Because  the  fluid  velocity  and  pressure  gradient  during  flowback  are  usually  small,
cleanup of internal and external cakes is not as effective as in vertical wellbores. Thus, only a
fraction of the wellbore contributes to flow when the well is returned to production.

4. Removing mud-induced formation damage by acidizing horizontal wells is often very dif-
ficult and expensive because of the large volumes of acid required and the difficulty in placing
the acid in the appropriate wellbore locations.

Studies conducted on a simulated horizontal wellbore indicated that the heel is more dam-
aged than the toe and that the upper part of the well is less damaged than the bottom of the
wellbore where the drillpipe rests.32 The damage zone around the horizontal wellbore can there-
fore be modeled as an eccentric cone around the wellbore with a significantly larger depth of
penetration at the heel and a shallower depth of penetration at the toe.33

Because the drilling fluid is in contact with the producing zone for an extended period of
time, drill-in fluids have been devised to minimize the potential formation damage. Sized calci-
um carbonate and sized salt fluids are the drill-in fluids used most often in such applications.
Oil-based muds have also been evaluated for this purpose. A more detailed discussion of their
formation damage potential is provided in Refs. 34 through 41.

6.6 Formation Damage Caused by Completion and Workover Fluids
When completion or workover operations are conducted on a well (perforating, gravel packing,
etc.), the fluid present in the wellbore must minimize the impact on the near-wellbore perme-
ability.  Several  decades  ago,  engineers  realized  that  the  use  of  drilling  fluids  during  comple-
tions  was  inappropriate  because  fluids  caused  severe  damage  to  the  productive  zone.  A  wide
variety of fluids are now available as completion or workover fluids. A list of these fluids is
provided  in  Table  6.1.  Our  discussion  here  focuses  on  formation  damage  issues  related  to
these different types of completion and workover fluids.

Water-based  fluids  usually  consist  primarily  of  clear  brines.  The  only  problem  with  clear
brines  is  that  they  are  not  ever  really  clear.42–44  They  always  contain  some  solids,  including
corrosion products, bacteria, and debris from the wellbore and surface tanks. The density of the
brine is maintained large enough so that the bottomhole pressure exceeds the reservoir pressure
by a safe margin (typically 300 to 600 psi). Substantial amounts of solids can be pushed into
the  formation,  resulting  in  a  loss  of  permeability  in  the  near-wellbore  region.  Fig.  6.6  shows
the  loss  in  permeability  observed  when  brines  with  differing  quantities  of  solids  are  injected

IV-252

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

into  a  core.  Rapid  reductions  in  permeability  are  observed  even  with  relatively  clean  fluids.
Surface filtration facilities are often used to clarify and filter completion brines, which can help
to  reduce  the  permeability impairment substantially. Most  of  the  high-density brines  used  can
be quite expensive. Large volumes of fluid loss can add substantially to the cost of a comple-
tion operation. An important fact to keep in mind with completion and workover fluids is that,
unlike  drilling  fluids,  they  do  not  contain  drill  solids.  This  means  that  there  is  no  effective
bridging material available to reduce fluid leakoff.

When fluid-leakoff rates are very high, fluid-leakoff-control additives may be used to mini-
mize  leakoff  and  formation  damage.  Use  of  acid-soluble  granular  additives  such  as  calcium
carbonate is the most common strategy.45–51 If this method proves to be ineffective, viscosify-
ing  polymers  are  used  to  reduce  the  amount  of  fluid  loss.  Hydroxyethylcellulose  (HEC)  is
commonly used because it is soluble in hydrochloric acid. HEC is a poor viscosifier at higher
(>  250°F)  temperatures,  and  unbroken  and  unhydrated  HEC  in  the  form  of  fisheyes  can  be
damaging.

Polymer fluids suffer from similar drawbacks. Severe formation damage can occur if large
amounts of polymer are lost to the formation. This problem is particularly acute if the polymer
is not completely hydrolyzed in the brine.

If the density requirements of the completion fluid are relatively modest, emulsions can be
used as completion fluids. In these instances, the droplets that form the dispersed phase act as
a filtration-control agent. Both water and oil-external emulsions have been used when reservoir
pressures are low.

Oil-based  fluids  such  as  crude  oil  and  invert-emulsion  muds  can  be  used  as  completion
fluids. It is important to ensure that the crude oil does not contain asphaltenes or paraffins that
might precipitate under changes in pressure and temperature as the fluid is circulated into the
well. Refs. 45 through 52 provide a more detailed discussion of some of the issues summarized
in this section. In addition, crude oil is flammable and messy to handle.

6.7 Damage During Perforating and Cementing
When cement is bullheaded into the annulus to displace mud, the differential pressure between
the  cement  and  the  formation  fluid  can  lead  to  a  significant  loss  of  cement  filtrate  into  the
formation. If, however, large volumes of cement filtrate invade the rock, the possibility of for-
mation damage exists.

Chapter 6—Formation Damage

IV-253

bay water from offshore Louisiana.48

The major constituents in the aqueous phase in contact with hydrating cement are calcium
silicates,  calcium  aluminates,  calcium  sulfates,  calcium  carbonates  or  bicarbonates,  and  alkali
sulfates. Depending on the specific composition of the cement and its pH, the filtrate may be
supersaturated  with  calcium  carbonate  and  calcium  sulfate.  As  the  cement  filtrate  invades  the
formation  and  reacts  with  the  formation  minerals,  its  pH  is  reduced  from  >  12  to  a  pH
buffered  by  the  formation  minerals.  This  rapid  change  in  pH  can  result  in  the  formation  of
inorganic precipitates such calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate.

Evidence of formation damage induced by cement filtrates has been clearly demonstrated in
experimental  studies  presented  in  Refs.  53  and  55.  Cunningham  and  Smith53  investigated  the
influence of cement filtrates on formation permeability and concluded that there was little evi-
dence of fines migration or clay swelling induced by the cement filtrate. They observed severe
permeability reductions of 60% to 90% in cores invaded by cement filtrate. Yang and Sharma54
investigated  the  impact  of  cement  additives  such  as  lignin  derivatives,  cellulose  derivatives,
organic acids, and synthetic polymers on the extent of permeability reduction in cores exposed
to cement filtrate. In that study, cement filtrate was injected immediately after filtration into a
sandstone core. Reductions in permeability of 40% to 80% were observed up to 6 in. into the
core.  Most  of  the  damage  observed  was  attributed  to  the  precipitation  of  insoluble  material
such as calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate in the core. The quantity of precipitate and rate
of  precipitation  relative  to  fluid  convection  were  important  factors  that  controlled  the  extent
and depth of permeability damage. Cement filtrates that showed fast rates of precipitation tend-
ed  to  damage  the  upstream  end  of  the  core,  whereas  filtrates  with  slow  precipitation  rates
tended to plug the downstream end of the core or not plug the core at all. The composition of

IV-254

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

the cement played an important role in determining both the quantity and the rates of precipita-
tion.  For  example,  the  addition  of  lignin  derivatives  or  polymer  reduced  the  quantity  of
precipitate and resulted in less damage to the rock. The addition of cellulose derivatives, on the
other hand, increased the rate and quantity of precipitation by an order of magnitude and result-
ed in more damage.54

If the depth of invasion of the cement filtrate can be restricted to ≈ 4 in., cement-filtrate-
induced damage should not be a major concern because the perforation tunnels will bypass the
damage.  However,  in  some  situations  in  which  large  volumes  of  cement  filtrate  may  be  lost,
this form of damage should be seriously considered. In such cases, the use of fluid-loss-control
additives and polymers in the cement slurry needs to be evaluated carefully so that the cement
is properly designed to minimize both the leakoff rate and the amount of insoluble precipitates
formed in the formation.

The process of perforating is critical to well productivity because the perforation is the only
channel of communication between the wellbore and the formation. During underbalanced per-
forating,  the  surge  flow  of  fluid  into  the  wellbore  should  clean  the  perforation  tunnel  of  all
disaggregated  rock  and  liner  debris.  Any  remaining  debris  in  the  tunnel  could  plug  gravel
packs during production. Even clean perforation tunnels show a narrow region of reduced per-
meability  around  them.  The  nature  of  this  crushed  or  compacted  zone  around  perforation
tunnels created during perforating has been widely studied.56–79 It is now well recognized that it
consists of shattered grains and fines generated by the perforation charge and perhaps fines that
flow in from the formation during underbalanced surge flow. The reduction in permeability in
the compacted region is typically of the order of 20 to 50% but can be larger in some cases.79
Using an optimal underbalance pressure results in better perforation performance.58 The reasons
for this are not completely understood. It is likely that too low an underbalance results in insuf-
ficient perforation cleaning and too large an underbalance results in the generation and migra-
tion  of  additional  fines.  This  explanation  is  consistent  with  the  observation  that  the  optimum
underbalance pressure is higher for lower-permeability formations.

6.8 Formation Damage Caused by Fines Migration
Fines migration is a recognized source of formation damage in some production wells, particu-
larly in sandstones.80,81 Direct evidence of fines-induced formation damage in production wells
is  often  difficult  to  come  by.  Although  most  other  forms  of  formation  damage  have  obvious
indicators of the problem, the field symptoms of fines migration are much more subtle. Indirect
evidence such as declining productivity over a period of several weeks or months is the most
common  symptom.  This  reduction  in  productivity  can  usually  be  reversed  by  mud-acid  treat-
ments.  A  large  number  of  wells  around  the  world  follow  these  patterns  of  reduction  of
productivity  followed  by  significant  improvements  when  subjected  to  a  mud-acid  treatment.
This behavior most often suggests a buildup of fines in the near-wellbore region over a period
of time. Field studies and laboratory experiments have indicated that the fines causing the per-
meability  reduction  include  clays,  feldspars,  micas,  and  plagioclase.  Because  the  mobile  fines
are made up of a wide variety of minerals, the clay content of the reservoir may not always be
a good indicator of the water sensitivity of the formation.

Core flow tests conducted in the laboratory clearly show that if low-salinity (< 2%) brines
are injected into water-sensitive rocks, large reductions in permeability (up to a factor 500) are
obtained (Fig. 6.7).82–85 It is now well established that this dramatic reduction in permeability
is almost entirely a result of fines migration. Evidence is shown clearly in Fig. 6.7. Reversal of
flow results in a temporary increase in permeability as the fines plug pores in the reverse flow
direction.

Fine-grained  minerals  are  present  in  most  sandstones  and  some  carbonates.  They  are  not
held  in  place  by  the  confining  pressure  and  are  free  to  move  with  the  fluid  phase  that  wets
them (usually water). They remain attached to pore surfaces by electrostatic and van der Waals

Chapter 6—Formation Damage

forces. At “high” (> 2%) salt concentrations, the van der Waals forces are sufficiently large to
keep the fines attached to the pore surfaces. As the salinity is decreased, the repulsive electro-
static forces increase because the negative charge on the surfaces of the pores and fines is no
longer  shielded  by  the  ions.  When  the  repulsive  electrostatic  forces  exceed  the  attractive  van
der Waals forces, the fines are released from pore surfaces.86 There is a critical salt concentra-
tion below which fines are released.82,86 The typical magnitude of the critical salt concentration
is in the range of 5,000 to 15,000 ppm (1.5%) sodium chloride. For divalent ions, this concen-
tration is significantly lower. If a water-sensitive sandstone is exposed to brine with a salinity
below the critical salt concentration, fines are released, and significant reductions in permeabili-
ty are observed (Fig. 6.7).

Fines migration can also be induced by mechanical entrainment of fines, which can occur
when  the  fluid  velocity  is  increased  above  a  critical  velocity.85–90  Gruesbeck  and  Collins,85
among  others,  have  measured  the  critical  velocity  for  sandstones.  Typical  reported  values  of
critical velocities are in the range of 0.02 m/s. This translates into modest well flow rates for
most oil and gas wells.

It has been experimentally observed that critical flow velocities for fines migration are low-
er  when  the  brine  phase  is  mobile.  Critical  velocities  are  an  order  of  magnitude  higher  when
the  brine  is  at  a  residual  saturation.  This  implies  that  fines  migration  will  be  more  important
with the onset of water production in a well, which is indeed the case. It is often observed that
well productivities decline much more rapidly after the onset of water production. In such in-
stances,  more  frequent  acid  treatments  are  needed  to  maintain  production  after  water  break-
through.

The  extent  of  permeability  reduction  observed  is  also  a  function  of  the  wettability  of  the
rock. More oil-wet rocks tend to show less water sensitivity, maybe because the fines are par-
tially  coated  with  oil  and  are  not  as  readily  accessible  to  the  brine.  Significantly  smaller
reductions in permeability are observed when the rock is made less water-wet.84,90

The  above  observations  imply  that  fines  migration  can  be  induced  by  any  operation  that
introduces “low” (< 2%) -salinity or “high” (> 9%) -pH fluids into a water-sensitive formation.
Fines migration can also be induced by “high” flow rates in the near-wellbore region, particu-

IV-256

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

larly  in  wells  producing  water.  Examples  of  such  operations  include  loss  of  freshwater-mud
filtrate  or  completion  fluid  to  the  formation,  steam  injection  in  a  huff  ‘n’  puff  operation  for
recovering heavy oil, water injection from a freshwater source, high well production rates (flow
velocities above the critical velocity), and water breakthrough in production wells.

6.9 Formation Damage Caused by Swelling Clays
Swelling clays, although relatively abundant in shales, do not occur as commonly in producing
intervals.  Thus,  problems  with  swelling  clays  are  not  nearly  as  common  as  those  associated
with  fines  migration.  The  most  common  swelling  clays  found  in  reservoir  rock  are  smectites
and  mixed-layer  illites.  It  was  earlier  thought  that  much  of  the  water  and  rate  sensitivity  ob-
served in sandstones was caused by swelling clays. However, it is now well accepted that the
water-sensitive and rate-sensitive behavior in sandstones is more commonly the result of fines
migration  and  only  rarely  of  swelling  clays.91,92  Swelling  clays  reduce  formation  permeability
by  peeling  off  the  pore  surfaces  and  plugging  pore  throats,  not  by  reducing  porosity  alone.
Should this happen to any extent, large reductions in permeability are observed.

The presence of swelling clays is generally associated with drilling problems (i.e., hole qual-
ity  and  stuck  pipe).  This  can  result  in  poor  cement  jobs  and  sensitivity  to  completion  fluids.
Poor hole quality in the producing interval can result in significant migration of fluids behind
pipe,  resulting  in  reduced  fluids  control  in  the  wellbore.  These  problems  are  encountered  if
either  the  producing  formation  or  the  intervening  shales  contain  substantial  quantities  of
swelling  clays.  When  swelling  clays  are  present  in  the  producing  interval,  formation  damage
problems can occur because of rate sensitivity or water sensitivity. Care must be exercised to
ensure  that  production  rates  and  drawdowns  in  such  wells  are  maintained  so  that  the  critical
velocity is not exceeded in the near-wellbore region.

Clay  minerals,  such  as  smectites  and  mixed-layer  illites,  can  expand  in  volume  up  to  20
times their original volume through adsorption of layers of water between their unit cells. Such
2:1 clay minerals are particularly prone to swelling because there is no hydrogen bonding be-
tween the octahedral layers of the unit cells.

Swelling  is  known  to  occur  in  three  steps.  In  the  first  step,  referred  to  as  crystalline
swelling, layers of water enter the interlayer space in the clay mineral, resulting in an increase
in the C spacing of the clay mineral in steps. The size of these steps is observed to be approxi-
mately equal to the diameter of the water molecule. Extremely large swelling pressures can be
generated through such an expansion of the clay lattice. The next stage in swelling is referred
to  as  hydration  swelling.  This  is  thought  to  occur  through  the  hydration  and  dehydration  of
ions entering the interlayer region. Several theories have been proposed to explain the observed
repulsive hydration force observed in the presence of different cations.93 Finally, when the inter-
layer  spacing  is  ≈  50  Å  or  so,  free  swelling  occurs.  This  is  driven  primarily  by  the  balance
between  electrostatic  and  van  der  Waals  forces  between  the  layers  of  clay.  In  this  stage  of
swelling, the clay layers are sufficiently far apart that very little mechanical integrity exists in
the  clay.  Such  clay  minerals  are  liable  to  be  dispersed  in  the  flowing  fluid  and  to  plug  pore
throats.

To  prevent  fines  migration  and  clay  swelling,  various  chemical  treatments  have  been  de-
signed.  These  include  polymers  containing  quaternary  ammonium  salts,94  hydrolyzable  metal
ions such as zirconium oxychloride,95 hydroxy-aluminum,96 and polymerizable ultrathin films.97
Each  of  these  methods  relies  on  coating  the  fines  (which  are  usually  negatively  charged)
with large polyvalent cations that can attach irreversibly to the mineral surfaces. When the elec-
trostatic  charges  on  the  fines  are  neutralized,  the  likelihood  of  fines  migration  is  reduced
significantly. Fines-stabilizing chemicals have been used in treatments such as acidizing, gravel
packing,  and  fracturing.  The  effectiveness  of  such  treatments  is  discussed  extensively  in  Ref.
98.

6.10 Formation Damage in Injection Wells
Water  is  commonly  injected  into  formations  for  three  primary  reasons:  pressure  maintenance,
water disposal, or waterflooding. In such projects, the cost of piping and pumping the water is
determined primarily by reservoir depth and the source of the water. However, water treatment
costs  can  vary  substantially,  depending  on  the  water  quality  required.  In  most  cases,  the  well
injectivity is a crucial factor in determining the cost of water injection. Maintaining high injec-
tivities over long periods of time is extremely important for all water injection projects.

Historically,  a  great  deal  of  expense  and  effort  have  been  expended  in  treating  water  to
ensure that very-high-quality water is being injected so that the injectivity of the well can be
maintained over a long period of time.

There  are  two  main  properties  of  injection  water  that  determine  the  formation  damage  or
the injectivity of water injection wells: the total dissolved solids in the injection water and the
total suspended solids (solids and oil droplets) in the injection water.99–104

The salinity and ion content in the injection water control two types of formation damage
in an injection well: freshwater sensitivity of the formation and precipitation of inorganic scale.
In water-sensitive formations, if fresh water is being injected from a nearby lake or river,
caution  must  be  exercised  to  ensure  that  fines  migration  is  not  a  major  factor.  This  can  be
achieved by ensuring that the salinity is above the critical salt concentration for the rock. Injec-
tion  wells  are  usually  less  susceptible  to  fines-migration  problems  than  production  wells
because  the  fines  being  generated  are  pushed  away  from  the  wellbore,  leading  to  less  severe
impairment  in  the  near-wellbore  region  and  therefore  relatively  small  losses  in  injectivity.  In
some instances in which the reservoir contains large proportions of clays and fines, severe in-
jectivity losses may be experienced when injecting below the critical salt concentration.

The  precipitation  of  inorganic  scale  is  a  major  concern  when  injecting  brines  with  a  high
concentration  of  divalent  ions.  The  hardness  of  the  injection  water  is  a  good  indicator  of  its
scaling  tendency.  Should  the  water  analysis  indicate  large  concentrations  of  calcium,  magne-
sium, iron, or barium, a water treatment facility that softens the water may be required. This is
also an issue when injecting seawater into formations that contain brines with high salinity.

Large persistent drops in injectivity are expected when inorganic scales are formed in injec-
tion  wells.  Most  field experience, however,  indicates that the  injection fluid  quickly displaces
the  native  brines  away  from  the  near-wellbore  region  with  very  little  mixing.  Inorganic  scale
precipitation  resulting  from  incompatibility  between  the  injection  and  reservoir  brine  is  there-
fore  not  usually  an  issue  for  most  injection  wells.  Geochemical  interactions  between  injected
fluids  and  the  reservoir  minerals  can  sometimes  result  in  the  formation  of  insoluble  precipi-
tates.  Scale  precipitation  can  also  be  induced  by  changes  in  pH,  temperature,  and  state  of
oxidation of the brine. The formation of insoluble iron precipitates as a result of corrosion is a
common source of damage in injection wells. These precipitates, mixed with other organic ma-
terial,  can  result  in  severe  and  irreversible  reductions  in  well  injectivity.  Careful  analysis  of
both the formation brines and injected fluids and a check of the reservoir mineralogy are neces-
sary. Checking for compatibility and ensuring that inorganic scale precipitation does not occur
at  reservoir  temperature  and  pressure  conditions  are  important  when  any  water  injection  pro-
gram is planned.

The presence of solids and oil droplets in the injection fluid can result in severe and rapid
declines in injectivity.99–104 If the injection pressure is below the fracture gradient and if fractur-
ing is undesirable from a reservoir engineering or environmental point of view, small concentra-
tions  of  solids  can  result  in  rapid  reductions  in  well  injectivity.  As  an  example,  5  ppm  of
solids  being  injected  into  a  well  at  10,000  B/D  computes  to  45  kg  of  solids  being  injected
every day. This large volume of solids can result in severe and rapid plugging of the injection
well  in  a  relatively  short  duration.  Field  experience  in  many  parts  of  the  world  suggests  that
matrix injection of clean brines containing 3 to 5 ppm of suspended solids results in injection

IV-258

well half-lives (time it takes for injectivity to decline to half its value) of 3 to 6 months. Fig.
6.8 shows the injectivity of a well in the offshore Gulf of Mexico. Seawater was being injected
into this well at the rates indicated.101 As the figure shows, despite the relativity good quality
of the water, a rapid reduction in injectivity was observed in this and other wells in this field.
This reduction led to costly stimulation and workover operations in these subsea wells.

In other field experiences, water has been injected into injection wells with minimal impact
on injectivity. A good example of this type of injection well behavior is the injection of pro-
duced water in Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska, where 2,000 ppm oil plus solids in the injection
water has been routinely injected with relatively little impact on well injectivity. The apparent
lack  of  formation  damage  is  a  consequence  of  thermally  induced  injection  well  fractures  that
propagate hundreds of meters into the formation.105–111 A great deal of work has been done to
study  the  impact  of  water  quality  on  the  growth  of  fractures  in  water  injection  wells  and  the
impact of injection well fractures on reservoir sweep and oil recovery.112,113 This discussion is
outside the scope of this chapter.

When fracturing injection wells is undesirable or unacceptable, the quality of the injection
water plays an important role in determining well injectivity or formation damage in injection
wells.  Various  water  clarification  devices  such  as  sedimentation  tanks,  sand  filters,  cartridge
filters, flotation devices, and hydrocyclones are available. These facilities significantly prolong
the  life  of  water  injection  wells  and  significantly  reduce  the  formation  damage.  An  economic
analysis is thus necessary to ensure that the benefits are greater than the costs.

6.11 Formation Damage Resulting From Paraffins and Asphaltenes
Perhaps the most common formation damage problem reported in the mature oil-producing re-
gions of the world is organic deposits forming both in and around the wellbore. These organic
deposits fall into two broad categories, paraffins and asphaltenes.

Crude  oils  contain  three  main  groups  of  compounds:  saturated  hydrocarbons  or  paraffins,
aromatic hydrocarbons, and resins and asphaltenes. Table 6.2 shows the gross composition of
crude oils, tars, and bitumens obtained from various sources. It is evident that crude oils con-
tain substantial proportions of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons with relatively small percent-
ages  of  resins  and  asphaltenes.  More  degraded  crudes,  including  tars  and  bitumens,  contain
substantially larger proportions of resins and asphaltenes.

6.11.1 Paraffin Deposition.  Paraffins are high-molecular-weight alkanes (C20+) that can build
up  as  deposits  in  the  wellbore,  in  feed  lines,  etc.  These  organic  deposits  can  act  as  chokes
within  the  wellbore,  resulting  in  a  gradual  decrease  in  production  with  time  as  the  deposits
increase  in  thickness.  This  can  result  in  producing  problems  unless  some  remedial  action  is
taken on a systematic and periodic basis. Deposits vary in consistency from soft accumulations
to hard, brittle deposits. Usually the deposits are firmer and harder as the molecular weight of
the paraffin deposits increases. Sometimes paraffins and asphaltenes occur together in organic
deposits.

The primary cause of wax or paraffin deposition is simply a loss in solubility in the crude
oil.114,115 This loss of solubility is usually a result of changes in temperature, pressure, or com-
position of the crude oil as a result of loss of dissolved gases. Paraffins that have the highest
melting point and molecular weight are usually the first to separate from solution, with lower-
molecular-weight paraffins separating as the temperature decreases further. For example, a C60
alkane with a melting point of about 215°F will deposit at a much higher temperature than a
C20 alkane with a melting point of 98°F.

The ability of the crude oil to hold the paraffin in solution is generally quantified with two
indicators:  a  pour  point  and  a  cloud  point.  The  procedure  for  measuring  the  pour  point  and
cloud point may be found in ASTM manuals (D2500-66 for cloud points and D97-66 for pour
points). The cloud point is defined as the temperature at which paraffins begin to come out of
solution and a clear solution of hydrocarbons turns cloudy. Obviously, it is difficult to measure
the cloud point for dark crude oil because cloudiness is not visible. In such cases, the presence
of paraffin crystals may have to be detected with a polarizing light microscope. The pour point
is defined as the temperature at which the crude oil no longer flows from its container. As the
temperature is lowered, wax crystals form an interlocking network that supports the hydrocar-
bon liquid within it. This network of paraffin crystals is quite shear sensitive and loose when

first formed but can harden and become extremely rigid as fluid is lost from it. Pour points are
relatively easy to measure in the field and provide a good indication of conditions under which
large quantities of paraffin will fall out of solution in crude oils.

The most common cause of loss of solubility of the paraffin in the crude oil is a decrease
in temperature, which may occur for a variety of reasons116: cooling produced by the crude oil
and associated gas expanding through the perforations, gas expansion while lifting fluids to the
surface, radiation of heat from the tubing to the surrounding formation induced by intrusion of
water into or around the wellbore, and loss of lighter constituents in the crude oil because of
vaporization. Several other possible reasons for a decrease in temperature can be envisioned. In
offshore  installations,  for  example,  paraffin  problems  are  usually  associated  with  the  rapid
change in temperature as the crude oil from the wellbore enters subsea pipelines that are im-
mersed in seawater at 4°C. Large volumes of paraffins can be deposited on the surfaces of the
pipelines, which requires periodic pigging.

Pressure itself has little or no influence on the solubility of paraffin in crude oil. However,
it  does  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  composition  of  the  crude  oil.  Reductions  in  pressure
usually lead to loss of volatiles from the crude oil and can induce the precipitation of paraffins.
This  is  the  primary  reason  why  paraffin  problems  are  more  common  in  the  more  mature  re-
gions  of  the  world.  As  the  reservoir  pressure  is  depleted  and  the  lighter  components  of  the
crude oil are produced in preference to the heavier fractions, the likelihood of paraffin precipi-
tation is significantly increased.

For  paraffin  deposition  to  be  a  significant  problem,  the  paraffin  must  deposit  on  the  pore
walls or the tubing surface. If the paraffin remains entrained in the crude oil, it usually offers
few production problems. Several factors influence the ability of paraffin to deposit on the pipe
walls:

1. The  presence  of  water  wetting  the  surfaces  of  the  pipe  tends  to  inhibit  paraffin  deposi-
tion. In addition, water has a higher specific heat than oil, which increases flowing temperatures.
2. Pipe quality plays an important role. Rusty pipes with large surface area and numerous
sites for paraffin crystal formation offer an ideal location for paraffin deposition. Paraffin ad-
heres to rough surfaces better than smooth surfaces.

3. The temperature profile in the near-wellbore region or within the pipe plays an important
role  in  determining  whether  the  paraffin  will  deposit  on  the  walls  or  will  continue  to  be  en-
trained with the fluid.

The  injection  of  fluids  such  as  stimulation  fluids  or  injection  water  into  the  wellbore  can
often induce paraffin deposition problems. This is particularly true if the surface temperature is
significantly colder than the reservoir temperature. Field cases documenting paraffin precipita-
tion during fracture stimulation are provided in Ref. 114.

6.11.2 Removal  of  Paraffin  Deposits.    Paraffin  accumulations  are  removed  by  methods  that
can  be  broadly  placed  into  three  categories:  (1)  mechanical  removal  of  paraffin  deposits,  (2)
the use of solvents to remove paraffin deposits, and (3) the use of heat to melt and remove the
wax. Mechanical methods such as scrapers, knives, and other tools are most commonly used to
remove paraffin deposits in the wellbore. They can be very effective and are relatively inexpen-
sive.

The  most  common  solvent  used  to  remove  paraffin  from  tubulars  and  the  near-wellbore
region is crude oil. Hot oiling is the least expensive method, commonly used on stripper wells
to remove paraffin deposits. Lease crude taken from stock-tank bottoms is heated to tempera-
tures  of  300°F  or  more.  This  heated  oil  is  then  injected  or  gravity  fed  into  the  tubing  or
annulus  (more  common).  The  high  temperature  induces  solubilization  of  the  paraffin  deposits
in  the  injected  crude,  which  is  then  produced  back  to  the  surface.  Hot  oiling  has  been  used
successfully to remove paraffin deposition but can result in formation damage. The use of hot
salt water to melt the paraffin may be a safer approach.

Chapter 6—Formation Damage

IV-261

Solvents, both organic and inorganic, have been used in the past. These include crude oil,
kerosene,  diesel,  and  surfactant  formulations  that  can  solubilize  the  paraffin.  Organic  solvents
that consist of a blend of aromatics are usually used to remove mixtures of paraffin and asphal-
tene deposits. However, the cost of such treatments can be significantly higher than that of hot
oil or water treatments.

Steam has been used in a number of cases in which severe paraffin problems have resulted
in plugged tubulars. The lack of solubility of paraffin in hot water necessitates the use of sur-
factants with steam or hot water so that the melted paraffin can be removed.

6.11.3 Methods for Preventing Paraffin Deposition.  Several  mechanical  adjustments  can  be
made in the production string that can minimize the likelihood of paraffin deposition. In gener-
al,  these  steps  are  designed  to  minimize  the  cooling  of  the  crude  oil  as  it  is  produced  to  the
surface.  This  can  be  accomplished  by  designing  pumping  wells  or  tubing  sizes  and  gas  lift
systems that maximize the flow of oil to the surface and minimize the heat lost to the surround-
ing  formations.  Use  of  more  expensive  methods  such  as  plastic  coatings  on  tubulars  and
electrical heaters is severely limited by economics.

Paraffin  inhibitors  are  a  class  of  compounds  that  consist  of  crystal  modifiers  that  prevent
the deposition of paraffin onto pipe surfaces. These surface-active materials retard paraffin de-
position by inhibiting the adhesion of paraffin to sites on the tubing walls. Surfactants used in
these applications include wetting agents, dispersants, and crystal modifiers.116,117 Each of these
chemicals needs to be tested for a specific crude oil to evaluate its effectiveness.

6.11.4 Asphaltene Precipitation.  High-molecular-weight  constituents  of  crude  oil  containing
nitrogen,  sulfur,  and  oxygen  (N,  S,  and  O)  compounds  are  referred  to  as  asphaltenes.  This
broad class of compounds is clearly not hydrocarbon because these compounds contain a large
portion of heteroatoms in their structure. Lower-molecular-weight NSO compounds are referred
to  as  resins.  The  separation  of  crude  oil  into  resins  and  asphaltenes  and  other  constituents  is
based primarily on solubility. Asphaltenes and resins are generally defined as the pentane-insol-
uble fraction of the crude oil.118

The  average  molecular  structure  of  an  example  asphaltene  fraction  from  a  crude  oil  from
Venezuela is shown in Fig. 6.9.118 It consists primarily of condensed aromatic rings associated
with  aliphatic  tails.  The  polynuclear  aromatic  rings  associate  with  each  other  through  their  π
electron systems to form clusters of stacked rings, as shown in the figure. In crude oils, these
asphaltene structures are dispersed and maintained in suspension by the action of resins. If suf-
ficient  quantities  of  resin  molecules  are  present  in  the  crude  oil,  the  asphaltenes  remain
dispersed  and  in  solution.  However,  the  addition  of  large  quantities  of  alkanes  or  removal  of
the  resin  fraction can  result  in  a  loss  of  solubility because  the  asphaltene molecules associate
with  each  other,  forming  large  aggregates  or  micelles,  and  precipitate  out.  These  micelles  or
aggregates are visible under optical microscopes as dark, solid aggregates. Precipitation of as-
phaltenes  occurs  through  the  formation  of  such  aggregates.  The  solubility  of  asphaltenes  is
therefore a function of temperature, pressure, and the composition of the crude oil. Any action
that affects the compositional balance of the crude oil can affect the ability of the oil to main-
tain the asphaltenes in solution.

A very common example of the change in composition of a crude oil is what occurs during
pressure depletion in a reservoir. As shown in Fig. 6.10, the solubility of asphaltene is a mini-
mum  at  the  bubblepoint  pressure.119  This  has  important  consequences  for  predicting  where
asphaltene precipitation will occur in a reservoir. As the reservoir is depleted and the bubble-
point pressure is achieved lower in the tubing or even in the formation itself, the possibility of
asphaltene  deposition  occurs  at  these  locations.  Indeed,  in  studies  published  in  the  literature,
the  location  of  asphaltene  deposition  is  observed  to  move  from  the  top  of  the  tubing  to  the

IV-262

bottom  and  into  the  reservoir  over  a  period  of  time  as  the  reservoir  pressure  is  depleted  and
the location where the bubblepoint pressure is reached moves further out toward the reservoir.
Asphaltene  deposition  can  also  be  induced  by  changes  in  composition  of  the  crude  oil
through injection of fluids such as CO2 or lean gas.120,121 Several studies have documented the
possibility  of  asphaltene  precipitation  during  lean  gas  and  CO2  injection  (Refs.  38  and  39).
Large  changes  in  temperature  can  also  induce  asphaltene  deposition.122,123  In  such  cases,  de-
posits  of  paraffin  and  asphaltene  are  commonly  observed  together.  The  asphaltene  particles
frequently act as nucleation sites for paraffin crystals.

6.11.5 Removal of Asphaltene Deposits.  Removal of asphaltene deposits also requires the use
of solvents or mechanical devices. However, the solvents used for asphaltene removal are quite
different  from  those  used  for  paraffins.  Because  asphaltenes  are  soluble  in  aromatic  solvents,
mixtures of aromatic solvents such as xylene have been used to remove asphaltene deposits.124
It  should  be  noted  that  solvents  such  as  diesel  and  kerosene  that  are  primarily  straight-chain
alkanes should not be used because they may induce asphaltene precipitation.

6.12 Formation Damage Resulting From Emulsion and Sludge Formation
The presence of emulsions at the surface does not imply the formation of emulsions in the near-
wellbore region. Most often, surface emulsions are a result of mixing and shearing that occur
in chokes and valves in the flow stream after the fluids have entered the well. It is uncommon
to  have  emulsions  and  sludges  form  in  the  near-wellbore  region  without  the  introduction  of
external chemicals.125 The mixing of two immiscible fluids at a high shear rate in the forma-
tion can sometimes result in the formation of a homogeneous mixture of one phase dispersed
into another. Such emulsions usually have a higher viscosity than either of the constituent flu-
ids and can result in significant decreases in the ability of the hydrocarbon phase to flow.

Crude-oil/brine  emulsions  are  stabilized  by  the  presence  of  surfactants  and  colloidal  parti-
cles such as clays, paraffins, and asphaltenes. In general, organophilic particles such as paraf-
fins  and  asphaltenes  favor  the  formation  of  oil-external  emulsions  and  sludges.  Water-wet
solids  such  as  clays  favor  the  formation  of  water-external  emulsions.  It  is  important  to  mini-

Chapter 6—Formation Damage

asphalt deposition in the well tubing.119

mize the loss of surface-active materials into the near-wellbore region to ensure that emulsions
do  not  form.  For  example,  large  volumes  of  surfactants  are  used  as  corrosion  inhibitors  and
dispersants in acid treatments. A significant cause of failure of acid treatments is the formation
of sludges and emulsions during an acid treatment as a result of the presence of these surfac-
tants.  The  compatibility of  crude  oil  with  the  acid package needs  to  be  evaluated before  it  is
pumped into the well. It has also been observed that the presence of iron enhances the forma-
tion  of  these  sludges.  It  is  therefore  recommended  that  iron  be  removed  from  the  tubing  by
circulating  a  slug  of  acid  to  the  surface  to  ensure  that  the  iron-rich  acid  is  not  squeezed  into
the formation during an acid treatment.

In general, it is difficult to remove emulsions and sludges once they are formed. Thus, it is
imperative to prevent the formation of such emulsions. Use of mutual solvents such as alcohols
and surfactants (demulsifiers) is the most common way to remove these deposits from the near-
wellbore  region.  However,  because  of  the  unfavorable  mobility  ratio  of  the  injected  fluid,
placing the treatment fluids in the plugged zones can be difficult. Again, laboratory tests with
the crudes should be conducted to ensure compatibility.

6.13 Formation Damage Resulting From Condensate Banking
As shown in Fig. 6.11, gas/condensate reservoirs are defined as reservoirs that contain hydro-
carbon mixtures that on pressure depletion cross the dewpoint line. In such instances as when
the  bottomhole  pressure  is  reduced  during  production,  the  dewpoint  pressure  of  the  gas  is
reached in the near-wellbore region. This results in the formation of liquid hydrocarbons near
the  wellbore  and  in  the  reservoir.  As  the  liquid  hydrocarbon  saturation  in  the  near-wellbore
region increases, the gas relative permeability is decreased, resulting in significant declines in
well productivity.126,127 An example of this is shown by the data in Fig. 6.12. Here, a substan-

Fig. 6.11—Illustration of condensate dropout in near-wellbore region. Buildup of liquid hydrocarbons in
this region can cause large reductions in gas relative permeability.133

Fig. 6.12—Reduction in well productivity caused by condensate buildup, Arun field, Indonesia.133

tial reduction in well productivity is obtained as the average reservoir pressure declines below
the dewpoint for a well in the Arun gas field. This mechanism of formation damage is related
primarily  to  changes  in  fluid  saturation  in  the  near-wellbore  region,  resulting  in  decreases  in
gas relative permeability.

The  buildup  of  the  condensate  bank  and  its  consequences  on  well  productivity  have  been
well  studied  in  the  literature  (Refs.  128  through  138).  Early  predictions  of  productivity  loss
because of condensate dropout indicated that a loss in PI by a factor of 5 to 8 would be expect-
ed because of liquid buildup.130–132 However, the decline in PI observed in many of the fields
is  much  smaller  (a  factor  of  2  to  4).  Further  investigation  of  this  problem  indicated  that  the
high gas flow rates in the near-wellbore region can result in stripping out of the liquid hydro-
carbon  phase  in  regions  around  the  wellbore.  This  stripping-out  effect  has  been  quantified
through  capillary-number-dependent  models  for  relative  permeability  of  the  gas  phase.129,138

Chapter 6—Formation Damage

IV-265

With  this  phenomenon  properly  accounted  for,  good  agreement  with  field  observations  is  ob-
tained (Fig. 6.12).

In addition to liquid dropout, several other important phenomena can play an important role
in determining well productivity and need to be carefully evaluated. Because of the high flow
rates of gas in the near-wellbore region, non-Darcy effects may be significant and may need to
be  accounted  for.133–136  The  combination  of  non-Darcy  flow,  capillary-number-dependent  rela-
tive  permeability,  and  phase  behavior  makes  the  problem  rather  complex,  and  numerical
simulations  are  needed  to  fully  capture  all  the  physics  of  the  problem.  Clearly  distinguishing
the effects of liquid dropout from non-Darcy effects from production performance and pressure-
transient  tests  can  be  challenging  and  may  require  compositional  numerical  models.  Such
models are widely available and have been used in estimating gas-well productivity, including
condensate dropout.

The most direct method of reducing condensate buildup is to reduce the drawdown so that
the  bottomhole  pressure  remains  above  the  dewpoint.  In  cases  when  this  is  not  desirable,  the
impact  of  condensate  formation  can  be  reduced  by  increasing  the  inflow  area  and  achieving
linear flow rather than radial flow into the wellbore. This minimizes the impact of the reduced
gas  permeability  in  the  near-wellbore  region.  Both  of  these  benefits  can  be  achieved  by  hy-
draulic fracturing.

Hydraulic  fracture  stimulation  is  the  most  common  method  used  to  remedy  condensate
buildup problems. The creation of a fracture results in a significant decrease in the drawdown
needed to produce the well. In addition, buildup of a liquid hydrocarbon phase on the faces of
the fracture does not affect well productivity as significantly as in radial flow around the well-
bore. Additional details of this are available elsewhere.137

Recently, the use of solvents and surfactants such as methanol has been suggested as a way
to stimulate gas/condensate wells in which hydraulic fracturing is not the preferred option.139,140
The use of methanol results in removal of the condensate and water banks around a wellbore.
This  allows  gas  flow  to  be  unimpeded  through  the  near-wellbore  region,  resulting  in  smaller
drawdown  and  slower  accumulation  of  condensate.  Within  certain  ranges  of  temperature  and
pressure, the presence of a residual methanol phase in the near-wellbore region can also result
in the inhibition of condensate formation for a period of time.

6.14 Formation Damage Resulting From Gas Breakout
In solution-gas-drive reservoirs, as the reservoir fluid pressure drops below the bubblepoint, a
gas phase is formed. If this event occurs in the wellbore, the gas bubbles formed help to lift
the liquid hydrocarbons to the surface. However, if the bubblepoint is reached in the near-well-
bore region, a significant gas saturation builds up around the wellbore resulting in a decrease
in  the  oil  relative  permeability.  As  might  be  expected,  this  form  of  damage  is  more  likely  to
occur later in the life of the reservoir as the average reservoir pressure is depleted below the
bubblepoint.

This type of damage can be diagnosed if the production engineer has a good understanding
of and access to phase behavior data. In many cases, however, lack of access to these data can
result in an incorrect diagnosis of the reduction in well productivity. Such a misdiagnosis can
lead to inaccurate recommendations for stimulation treatments.

In typical relative permeability curves, the change in the relative permeability to oil can be
rather drastic as the gas saturation increases. This decrease in oil permeability can have a dra-
matic  effect  on  well  productivity.  Oil  flow  rates  can  decrease  while  gas  flow  rates  may
increase rapidly over a relatively short duration.

The most common method to address gas breakout problems is to hydraulically fracture the
well in an attempt to reduce the drawdown needed to produce at a given rate. Repressurizing
the reservoir is also an excellent alternative. The economics of reservoir repressurization need
to  be  carefully  evaluated  in  such  applications.  It  should  be  noted  that  in  cases  in  which  the

IV-266

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

average reservoir pressure drops below the bubblepoint throughout most of the reservoir, a gas
cap may begin forming in the reservoir. This can, over a long time period, result in increased
gas production into the wellbore from the gas cap.

6.15 Formation Damage Resulting From Water Blocks
If  large  volumes  of  water-based  drilling  or  completion  fluids  are  lost  to  a  well,  a  region  of
high water saturation around the wellbore forms. In this region, the relative permeability to the
hydrocarbon phases is decreased, resulting in a net loss in well productivity.141,142

Regions of high water saturation, or water blocks around the wellbore, are expected to dis-
sipate  with  time  as  the  hydrocarbon  fluids  are  produced.  In  general,  when  the  viscous  forces
are significantly larger than the capillary forces, the water block will clear up rather rapidly. If,
however, the capillary forces holding the water in place are larger than the viscous forces, for
example,  in  tight  gas  reservoirs,  water  blocks  may  persist  for  a  very  long  period  of  time.  A
capillary  number,  defined  as  the  ratio  of  capillary  to  viscous  forces,  can  be  used  to  quantify
this effect. When capillary forces are larger than or comparable to viscous forces, water blocks
are hard to remove. On the other hand, when viscous forces dominate, water blocks will clear
up in a matter of a few hours or days.143 Water blocks will generally be more troublesome for
low-permeability,  depleted  gas  wells  in  which  the  capillary  number  is  significantly  less  than
1.144,145

There are three primary methods used to remove water blocks: (1) surging or swabbing the
wells  to  increase  the  capillary  number  temporarily;  (2)  reducing  surface  tension  through  the
addition  of  surfactants  or  solvents,  which  also  has  the  net  effect  of  increasing  the  capillary
number by reducing the interfacial tension between the hydrocarbon and water phases so that
the  water  block  may  be  cleaned  up  during  flowback,  and  (3)  the  use  of  solvents  or  mutual
solvents  such  as  alcohols  to  solubilize  the  water  and  remove  it  through  a  change  in  phase
behavior.146,147 All of these three methods have been successfully applied in the field. The ben-
efit  of  one  method  over  another  depends  on  the  specific  conditions  of  reservoir  permeability,
temperature, and pressure.

6.16 Formation Damage Resulting From Wettability Alteration
Converting  a  rock  from  water-wet  to  oil-wet  results  in  a  substantial  reduction  in  the  relative
permeability  to  the  hydrocarbon  phase  and  an  increase  in  relative  permeability  to  the  water
(Fig. 6.12). Wettability alteration to less water-wet conditions is therefore clearly undesirable.

The loss of surfactants in drilling and completion fluids,148–150 corrosion inhibitors and dis-
persants  in  stimulation  fluids,  and  the  use  of  resins  for  sand  control  can  cause  changes  in
wettability in the near-wellbore region. Care must be exercised when oil-wetting surfactants are
used in the wellbore to ensure that these fluids are not lost to the productive zone. Alteration
of wettability in a region around the wellbore can result in an additional pressure drop because
of the reduction in oil permeability. This additional pressure drop or skin is hard to distinguish
from mechanical skin caused by physical plugging of pore throats. In effect, wettability alter-
ation has the same net result as changing the effective permeability to the hydrocarbon phase
in a region around the wellbore.

The use of solvents and water-wetting surfactants may be recommended in cases in which
large volumes of oil-wetting surfactants such as oil-based muds have been lost to the formation.

6.17 Bacterial Plugging
Anaerobic  bacteria  are  ubiquitously  present  in  and  around  oil  and  gas  wells.151  Under  most
producing conditions, their growth is not stimulated because of the high temperature and pres-
sure  conditions.  However,  in  some  instances,  injection  of  water-based  fluids  can  induce  the
growth  of  microbial  populations  and  can  result  in  significant  declines  in  productivity  or

Chapter 6—Formation Damage

injectivity.152 The growth of sulfur-reducing bacteria can also result in the generation of hydro-
gen sulfide gas and the fouling of flowlines and facilities.

The use of a bactericide (such as sodium hypochlorite or mixtures of other strong oxidizing
agents and antibacterial agents) is sometimes an effective, albeit expensive, method of reducing
this problem.

6.18 Conclusions
This chapter has presented methods to measure and quantify formation damage in oil and gas
wells. Several different mechanisms responsible for causing formation damage were discussed.
A  better understanding of  these  mechanisms allows  us  to  make recommendations for  drilling,
completion, and production operations that will reduce the extent of formation damage and max-
imize well productivity.

Matrix Acidizing
Harry O. McLeod, SPE

7.1 Introduction
This  chapter  is  organized  to  help  perform  acidizing  on  a  well  candidate  in  a  logical  step-by-
step process and then select and execute an appropriate chemical treatment for the oil/gas well.
The guidelines are practical in intent and avoid the more complicated acid reaction chemistries,
although  such  investigations  and  the  use  of  geochemical  models  are  recommended  for  more
complicated formations or reservoir conditions. Effective acidizing is guided by practical limits
in volumes and types of acid and procedures so as to achieve an optimum removal of the for-
mation damage around the wellbore.

Most  of  this  chapter  is  an  outgrowth  of  field  case  studies  and  of  concepts  derived  from
experimental testing and research. Justification for the practices and recommendations proposed
herein are contained in the referenced documents. The reader is referred to the author’s previ-
ous papers on matrix acidizing for references published before 1990. Concepts and techniques
presented have been examined during repeated presentation of the Society of Petroleum Engi-
neering  (SPE)  Short  Course  titled  “Matrix  Acidizing  to  Improve  Well  Performance.”1  Recent
research has fine-tuned many of the concepts and acid types that are incorporated into propri-
etary  software  of  various  service  companies.  These  programs  are  available  through  service
company  stimulation  specialists  who  can  assist  with  particular  formation  characteristics  and
reservoir  conditions.  The  reader  should  use  this  chapter  as  an  introduction  to  significant  and
necessary  concepts  and  practices.  Improved  procedures  and  products  can  be  selected  by  the
company engineer in partnership with the stimulation specialist using proprietary software. The
objective in the following discussion is to provide reasonable procedures and guidelines and to
offer cautions suggested by particular formation compositions and reservoir conditions.

7.2 Two Basic Acidizing Treatments
Acidizing  is  used  to  either  stimulate  a  well  to  greater  than  ideal  matrix  reservoir  flow  or  to
remove damage. These are two distinct and different purposes, the field applications and results
of which are often merged or confused. Basically, there are two types of acid treatments that
are related to injection rates and pressures. Injection rates resulting in pressures below fracture
pressure  are  termed  “matrix  acidizing,”  while  those  above  fracture  pressure  are  termed  “frac-
ture acidizing.”

Fig. 7.1 shows the increase in pressure linearly with rate until parting pressure is attained,
at  which  time  rate  can  continue  to  increase  with  little  change  in  pressure  above  parting  pres-
sure. Matrix acidizing is used primarily for damage removal, while fracture acidizing is used to
enlarge  the  effective  wellbore  by  creating  an  acid-etched  fracture  deep  into  the  wellbore  for
relatively  low-permeability  formations  to  improve  well  productivity  several-fold.  This  chapter
focuses on matrix acidizing.

7.3 Purposes/Applications
A matrix treatment restores permeability by removing damage around the wellbore, thus improv-
ing  productivity  in  both  sandstone  and  carbonate  wells.  Although  the  acid  systems  used  in
sandstone and carbonate differ, the same practices apply to both. In the absence of damage, the
large volume of acid that is required to improve the formation permeability in the vicinity of
the  wellbore  may  not  justify  the  small  incremental  increase  in  production,  especially  in  sand-
stone. In carbonate rock, hydrochloric acid enlarges the wellbore or tends to bypass damage by
forming  wormholes.  The  permeability  increase  is  much  larger  in  carbonate  than  in  sandstone.
The effect of damage on well productivity and flow is illustrated in Figs. 7.2 and 7.3.1

Severe damage (kD/k less than 0.2) is usually close to the wellbore, within 12 in., as in Fig.
7.2. More moderate damage (kD/k greater than 0.2) may occur much deeper (3 ft from the well-
bore  or  more),  as  described  in  Fig.  7.3.  Oilwell  flow  behavior  is  greatly  affected  by  the
geometry of radial flow into the wellbore; 25% of the pressure drop takes place within 3 ft of
the  wellbore  if  no  damage  is  present,  as  shown  in  Fig. 7.4.2  Because  of  the  small  flow  area,
any  damage  to  the  formation  at  that  point  may  account  for  most  of  the  total  pressure  drop
(drawdown) during production and, thereby, dominate well performance.

7.4 Effects of Acidizing: Undamaged Well
Matrix  acidizing  is  applied  primarily  to  remove  damage  caused  by  drilling,  completion,  and
workover fluids and solids precipitated from produced water or oil (i.e., scale or paraffin). Re-

moval of severe plugging in carbonate or sandstone can result in very large increases in well
productivity.  On  the  other  hand,  if  there  is  no  damage,  a  matrix  treatment  seldom  increases
natural production more than 50%, depending on the size of the treatment and the penetration
depth of live acid, as demonstrated in Fig. 7.5.1

Wormholes are small, continuous channels formed by acid preferentially enlarging pores in
carbonate, usually around 2 to 5 mm in diameter. In radial flow, wormholes form a dendritic
pattern, like the roots of a tree. Gdanski3 developed a practical model for wormholing during
matrix  acidizing  in  carbonates,  which  shows  that  practical  limits  for  effective  penetration  of
hydrochloric (HCl) acid varies from about 1 to 5 ft. Penetration is limited by injection rate and
volume. The maximum rate allowed is a function of the carbonate permeability. Radial penetra-
tion is so limited in low-permeability carbonate that it is a better candidate for fracture acidizing.

When there is no damage present, improper or poorly executed acid treatments can reduce
the natural formation permeability and reduce well productivity, as in new wells with low reser-
voir  permeability.  Gidley4  presented  the  results  of  an  extensive  statistical  review  of  one
company’s  acidizing  success  in  sandstone  reservoirs  in  the  U.S.  He  found  that  only  54%  of
507 wells increased in production following hydrofluoric (HF) acid stimulation. More recently,
Nitters et al.5 stated that past programs resulted in only 25% success. Where better evaluation
and  quality  control  have  been  implemented,  the  percentage  of  successful  treatments  has  im-
proved  to  75  to  90%.  Such  a  program  was  developed  by  Brannon  et  al.,6  who  successfully
acidized 35 of 37 wells (95% success) for an average production increase of 343 BOPD. Other
areas  and  formations  still  suffer  from  poor  acidizing  responses,  which  implies  that  opportuni-
ties for technology development still exist.

7.5 Selecting Successful Acidizing Candidates
Wells may perform poorly or less well than expected because of three different factors: (1) an
inefficient mechanical system (wrong size tubing in a flowing well or inefficient artificial lift
equipment for pumping or gas lift wells), (2) low reservoir permeability, or (3) wellbore restric-
tion  because  of  formation  damage  or  incomplete  perforating.  A  good  matrix  acidizing  candi-
date  is  any  well  producing  from  a  formation  with  permeability  greater  than  10  md  and  the
permeability of which in the near-wellbore or near-perforation region has been reduced by sol-
id plugging. This plugging is either mechanical or chemical. Mechanical plugging is caused by
either the introduction of suspended solids in a completion or workover fluid or the dispersion
of  in-situ  fines  by  incompatible  fluids  and/or  high  interstitial  velocities.  Chemical  plugging  is
caused by mixing incompatible fluids that precipitate solids. If formation damage is the cause
for poor production, the well is a good candidate for acidizing. Several methods can be used to
evaluate  the  presence  of  damage:  production  history  plots  that  show  sudden  change,  slope
change,  and  gradual  change;  offset  well  comparison;  pressure  buildup  tests;  and  well  perfor-
mance analysis.

7.6 Production History Plots
Production  rate/time  plots  are  normally  available  for  oil/gas  wells  that  show  change  of  rate
with time and that note significant events such as workovers and stimulation treatments. Dam-
age  is  revealed  by  at  least  three  different  characteristics  as  previously  listed.  The  first  is  a
sudden change in productivity following an event like a workover, as shown in Fig. 7.6.7 An
unfiltered produced brine was used to kill the well during a workover to repair a tubing leak.
In this example, formation damage is obvious in the reduced productivity immediately after the
workover.  This  lowered  productivity  persisted  until  an  acid  treatment  removed  the  damage.
Many times the analysis of a damaged condition is not so obvious.

A  depletion-type  history  curve  may  decline  at  a  certain  rate,  as  shown  in  Fig.  7.7.8  This
well followed a certain decline rate and then began to decline faster as shown by the change in
slope.  This  is  often  characteristic  of  scale  buildup  around  the  wellbore  from  produced  water.

IV-280

Fig. 7.7—Production history graph—change in slope: scale buildup (after Farina8).

This  well  was  diagnosed  and  treated  with  HCl  acid  to  dissolve  calcium  carbonate  scale,  and
production rate was restored.

Some changes occur so slowly over time that productivity change is difficult to detect. Over-
laying history curves of different wells will reveal this change in productivity. Fig. 7.8 shows
this overlay for two California wells. Increasing water production called attention to one well,
and testing revealed a casing leak in this well.7

7.7 Offset Well Comparison
Often acidizing candidates are selected on the basis of offset well comparisons. The productivi-
ties  of  offset  wells  are  compared,  and  the  poorer-performing  wells  are  selected  for  acidizing.
Many times, this selection is made without sufficient well testing. Pressure buildup testing may
be  too  expensive  in  terms  of  lost  production  during  long  shut-ins,  or  well  interference  may
circumvent reliable long-time pressure data. Table 7.1 shows such an offset comparison.9

On the basis of production only, three wells are acidizing candidates. However, when one
compares the formation potential through log analysis, as expressed by net porosity feet, only
one well is a reliable acidizing candidate: Well B-1. Acidizing all three wells on the basis of
production rate alone may provide only a 33% success. In waterfloods, it is also important to
compare effective reservoir pressures around each well or to compare the injection rates from
adjacent water injection wells. If a well’s water injectivity is low, production will be less in the
offset producing well.

7.8 Pressure Buildup Tests
Where  wells  flow  naturally,  as  in  natural  gas  wells  or  new  oil  wells,  pressure  buildup  tests
provide  a  reliable  measure  of  reservoir  permeability  and  wellbore  condition  (skin  factor,  S).
The skin factor, S, when positive, indicates restricted flow; however, the restriction is not nec-
essarily  formation  damage.  A  skin  factor  of  5  to  20  or  more  can  result  from  inadequate
perforation  size  and/or  low  shot  density  when  combined  with  either  non-Darcy  or  two-phase

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

fluid flow. Two-phase flow effects and non-Darcy flow cause high skin factors by themselves
and can amplify the restriction caused by limited perforating. Such an example is shown in the
buildup test in Fig. 7.9.9 See the chapter on fluid flow in the reservoir engineering section of
this handbook for more details on this type of plot.

This gas well was perforated with sufficient underbalance to achieve clean undamaged per-
forations, yet the skin factor from the pressure buildup test was 11. Well flow analysis showed
that  this  skin  was  caused  mainly  by  high-velocity  flow  of  gas  into  small  perforations  created
by the small through-tubing perforating gun used in this well.

Other wells have been identified with high skin factors that were the result of limited perfo-
rating and two-phase-flow effects. One gas condensate well had a skin factor of 29, which was

IV-282

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 7.9—Pressure buildup of a south Texas gas well.9

the result of liquid saturation buildup and non-Darcy flow around the wellbore after a compres-
sor  was  installed  to  pull  the  well  harder.  Another  well  in  a  deep,  overpressured  oil  reservoir
had a positive skin factor even after fracturing because of a solution gas/oil ratio (GOR) over
1,200  scf/bbl  and  a  high  pressure  drawdown.  Acidizing  such  wells  have  caused  productivity
decreases because acidizing sometimes produces damage where no damage existed before acidiz-
ing;  therefore,  use  the  checklist  shown  in  Table  7.2  before  selecting  acidizing  candidates  on
the basis of high skin factors alone.9

7.9 Well Flow Analysis
A skin factor can be analyzed by well flow analysis to show when it is caused by the previous-
ly  described  effects  or  when  it  is  the  result  of  permeability  damage.  An  example  of  such  a
damaged  well  is  shown  in  Fig.  7.10.9  This  figure  shows  predicted  gravel-pack  pressure  drop

vs. flow rate for different effective shots per foot (perforations). This well was perforated ade-
quately  and  should  have  produced  much  better  after  completion.  Review  of  the  completion
procedure showed that formation damage probably occurred during completion, and a standard
acidizing  treatment  was  used  to  dissolve  the  damage.  Performance  significantly  improved,  as
shown by the reduction of completion pressure drop and increase of flow rate in this gas well.

7.10 Formation Damage Diagnosis
Well testing and well test analysis generate a skin factor and well completion efficiency. This
is insufficient alone for formation damage diagnosis. Well performance analysis has provided a
beneficial tool to identify the location and thickness of damage at flow points in the near well-
bore area. Models of flow into perforations and gravel-packed tunnels provide a way to relate
the location and severity of damage to the completion procedure that preceded it.

Well diagnosis is not just an evaluation of whether a well is damaged. Picking a potentially
successful acidizing candidate involves not only the fact that a well is damaged but what kind
of damage and where it is located around the wellbore. Damage is often most severe and local-
ized at the point of flow entry into the wellbore. The improvement in damage analysis through
well  performance  is  rather  recent,  as  evidenced  by  the  work  of  several  authors.10–20  Most  of
this occurred through emphasis on improving gravel-packed completions in high-rate oil wells
by means of multirate testing and improved wellbore models. Some of this work has focused
on identifying specific damage mechanisms.17–19

7.11 Identify Extent/Type of Damage
To select the appropriate acid, one must diagnose the probable type of damage and the extent
of  penetration  into  the  formation.  Drilling  solid  infiltration  is  shallow  (less  than  one  in.);
drilling fluid filtrate can invade the formation 3 ft or more. Perforation damage is shallow and
varies in severity according to the perforating procedure. Water injection well damage can be
quite deep when moderately clean fluids are injected over long periods of time with small unfil-
tered solids in the fluid. Likewise, incompatible fluids may precipitate deeper in the formation.
Repeated acid treatments also may leave damage deeper in the formation. Shallow damage can
be quite severe in that thin filter cakes or internal bridging under high differential pressure can
have very low permeability. Deep damage is usually more moderate but can be quite difficult

IV-284

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

to  reach  with  reactive  fluids  like  acid  and,  thus,  may  require  deep  treatments  like  hydraulic
fracturing or acid fracturing.

Familiarity  with  all  sources  of  damage  and  damaging  operations  is  a  requisite  tool  for  an
engineer  selecting  the  best  remedial  acid  treatment  and  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  chapter.
Sparlin and Hagen21 provide good information on damage mechanisms and damage analysis in
their SPE Short Course on formation damage. Ref. 1 provides a damage check list. More infor-
mation on damaging mechanisms and analysis is provided in the chapter on formation damage
in  this  handbook.  Recent  examples  of  damage  analysis  and  removal  are  provided  by  Fam-
brough et al.,22 Zhu et al.,23 and Guoynes et al.24 A recent article concerning well completion
post-audits  provides  a  means  of  pinpointing  the  time  of  occurrence  and  the  operation  that
caused damage in a particular completion by analysis of fluid loss and injection data.25

7.12 Damage Removal by Chemical Solvents
Selection of a chemical for any particular application depends on which contaminants are plug-
ging  the  formation.  HCl  acid  and  other  acids  do  not  dissolve  pipe  dope,  paraffin,  or  as-
phaltenes.  Treatment  of  these  solids  or  plugging  agents  requires  an  effective  organic  solvent
(usually an aromatic solvent like toluene, xylene, or orthonitrotoluene). Acetic acid effectively
dissolves calcium carbonate scale; however, it does not dissolve ferric oxide (iron oxide) scale.
HCl acid dissolves calcium carbonate scale quite easily but has little affect on calcium sulfate
scales.  Calcium  sulfate  can  be  converted  to  calcium  carbonate  or  calcium  hydroxide  by  treat-
ment with potassium hydroxide or sodium carbonate. HCl acid then can be used to dissolve the
converted  scale.  Several  cycles  of  such  treatment  may  be  necessary  to  remove  all  the  scale.
Calcium  sulfate  also  can  be  dissolved  in  one  step  with  the  sodium  salt  of  ethylene  diamine
tetra acetic acid (EDTA), but at a higher cost. HF acid must be used to dissolve formation clay
minerals or drilling-mud solids when they plug pore throats in the formation.

Because  different  plugging  solids  require  different  solvents  for  their  removal,  there  is  no
universal solvent for wellbore damage. Treatment based on such a premise often yields disap-
pointing results. Never pump solvent or acid into a well until the probable causes of damage
and the best chemical to remove the damage have been defined. A summary solvent selection
table is given in Table 7.3 for the type of damage.1

7.13 Formation Response to Acid
Even  though  damage  has  been  identified  and  an  appropriate  acid  or  other  cleaning  agent  is
available to remove the damage, one must evaluate the probable response of the formation (its
fluids and minerals) to either the acid or spent acid. There are many incompatibilities possible
in  acidizing  various  formations.  These  incompatibilities  result  in  solid  precipitates,  which  can
plug  pore  throats  so  as  to  offset  the  improvement  by  acid  dissolving  pre-existing,  damaging
solids.  Results  can  range  from  no  bad  effects  and  complete  cleanup  of  damage  to  less  than
optimum improvement to plugging of the formation with acid-generated precipitates. As an ex-
ample,  a  gas  well  producing  4  MMft3/D  from  a  sandstone  reservoir  was  acidized  to  improve
production.  The  well  flowed  only  2  MMft3/D  after  acidizing.  Post-treatment  analysis  showed
that production was restricted by the small perforations (small inflow area) created with a through-
tubing gun in underbalanced perforating; however, no permeability damage was present. Subse-
quent  detailed  petrographic  core  analysis  indicated  that  a  combination  of  acid-released  fines
and spent-acid precipitates damaged the formation during the acid treatment. Such incompatibil-
ities are discussed next.

7.14 Formation Properties
One  can  prevent  acid-induced  damage  by  predicting  and  dealing  with  formation  response  be-
fore acidizing. While it is sometimes easy to dissolve plugging solids, the real test of success
is  dissolving  the  solids  without  injecting  or  creating  other  damaging  solids  in  the  process.  If

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-285

IV-286

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

potential incompatibilities between acid and formation solids or fluids are identified, precipita-
tion of reaction products in the formation can be prevented or controlled.

Three  properties  of  the  formation  are  important:  (1)  Formation  fluid  analysis  helps  select
appropriate displacement fluids to isolate formation fluids that are incompatible with either the
acid or the spent acid products. (2) Formation matrix characterization identifies potential prob-
lems  with  acid  treatments.  (3)  Formation  mineralogy  helps  select  the  type  of  acid  and  its
concentration.

7.14.1 Formation  Fluid  Compatibility.    Formation  fluid  compatibility  with  both  acid  and
spent acid must be considered in the treatment with acid. Formation water analysis is a stan-
dard test in laboratories, and chromatography is standard to identify gas compositions. Crude-
oil analysis is much more complicated, so emulsion tests and sludge tests have been developed
to identify incompatible crude oils.

7.14.2 Sulfate Ion Content.  High sulfate-ion content exists in some formation waters. Spend-
ing  HCl  acid  on  carbonate  generates  a  high  concentration  of  calcium  ions,  which  precipitates
calcium sulfate when spent acid mixes with formation water containing more than 1,000 ppm
sulfate ion. This can be prevented by preflushing the formation water away from the wellbore.
In  limestone  acidizing,  KCl  or  NaCl  brines  will  work.  In  sandstone  acidizing,  NH4Cl  brine
must be used (KCl and NaCl are incompatible with spent HF acid). Such a preflush, combined
with  quick  return  of  spent  acid  from  the  formation  by  swabbing,  has  improved  response  to
acidizing in the San Andres dolomite formation in eastern New Mexico.

7.14.3 Bicarbonate Ion Content.  High bicarbonate-ion content in formation waters causes pre-
cipitation of acid-dissolved scale. Treatment with an acid form of EDTA both removes calcium
carbonate scale and prevents the recurrence of the scale for several months.

7.14.4 Crude-Oil Incompatibility (Sludge and Asphaltenes).  Some oils, particularly black as-
phaltic  oils  (less  than  30°API),  react  with  acid  to  form  either  damaging  sludge  (precipitated
asphaltenes)  or  stable  emulsions.  Sometimes  sludge  preventers  and  emulsion  breakers  cannot
prevent the formation of stable emulsions. Dissolved iron also creates more stable sludge and
emulsions  with  these  crude  oils.  Some  difficult  crudes  need  a  preflush  buffer  of  hydrocarbon
solvent between crude oil and acid that is mutually compatible with both the crude oil and the
acid. The buffer reduces contact between acid and the oil and prevents or reduces the problems
with sludge and emulsions. Using this technique in one Wyoming oil field increased treatment
success from 25 to 75%. Asphaltene particles can precipitate during production, and aromatic
solvents  can  loosen  and  partially  or  completely  dissolve  them  and  also  help  acid  dissolve
solids. Presoaks with an aromatic solvent and producing back before acidizing have been help-
ful in treating wells drilled with oil-based mud. Organic skin damage in oil-producing wells is
a major factor in the loss of productivity and revenue. Paraffin and asphaltene deposition in the
formation around the wellbore creates a barrier to oil flow. Better methods of problem identifi-
cation  and  programs  to  remediate  these  problems  have  been  developed  in  recent  years.  The
potential sources of organic damage, problem identification test techniques, chemical selection,
and application methods are discussed.26,27

7.14.5 Hydrogen Sulfide.  Hydrogen sulfide can be present in the oil, gas, and/or water in any
producing or injection well. Sulfide scavengers are effective in preventing incompatibilities and
precipitation of iron sulfide.28

7.15 Formation Matrix Properties
Formation matrix analysis is more involved and can be critical to acidizing success. The most
significant properties are the grain size distribution, cementation, and clay content, which con-
trol permeability. Formation permeability is needed to estimate the matrix injection rate and the
risk  of  acid  fracturing.  Clay  distribution  is  also  important,  as  illustrated  in  Figs.  7.11  and
7.12.29,30

Fig. 7.11 depicts clean sand, dispersed shale or clay, laminated shale, and structural shale.
The  preferred  formation  is  a  clean,  uniform  size,  pure  quartz  sand  that  is  the  simplest  to
acidize because no incompatibilities exist, and acid mostly dissolves damage like drilling mud
or other solids. Dispersed clay exists as grain coatings, bridging clays, or pore-filling clays, as
illustrated  in  Figs.  7.12  and  7.13.31  These  clays  are  highly  reactive  with  HF  acid  and  some-
times  HCl  acid  (chlorite  clay).  All  clays  are  much  more  reactive  above  250°F.  Clays  control
the HF acid spending rate and the undesired secondary and tertiary reaction products that are
characteristic of HF acidizing in clay-rich sandstone. Laminated shale or clay is more isolated
from HF reaction because it is impermeable. It prevents vertical flow of acid from perforations
and  also  restricts  near-perforation  flow.  Structural  shale  is  rare  but  is  present  in  some  Pleis-
tocene  or  recent  sands  and  can  cause  matrix  collapse  and  reduced  permeability  when  acid
softens the shale grains.

The distribution and type of clay are characterized by petrographic analysis: thin sections,
scanning  electron  microscopy,  and  x-ray  diffraction  analysis.32  These  tests  are  standard  with
most core-analysis companies and stimulation-service companies. When no cores are available,

IV-288

analyses are possible using drill cuttings. Permeability may also be analyzed with mercury in-
jection  testing  of  drill  cuttings,  and  estimates  of  permeability  can  be  made  by  statistical
analysis  of  thin  sections  and  scanning  electron  microscope  (SEM)  photographs.  Permeability
may  also  be  estimated  by  certain  log  analysis  programs  and  are  based  on  porosity  and  clay
content and water saturation (as an indicator of grain size).

7.16 Formation Mineralogy
Carbonates usually have no formation-compatibility problem because HCl acid dissolves carbon-
ate  easily  and  leaves  a  formation  compatible  brine  as  a  reaction  product.  However,  where

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-289

In sandstone acidizing, formation mineral content is important to the design of the HCl acid
preflush,  HF  acid  treatment,  and  overflush.  Where  high  HCl-acid  solubility  exists  (20%  or
more), HF acid should not be used. Formation damage often can be loosened by dissolving HCl-
acid  soluble  compounds  producing  the  released  insoluble  compounds.  The  use  of  HF  acid  in
sandstone  with  a  high-carbonate  content  produces  voluminous  solid  precipitates.  Gdanski  and
Schuchart33 questions HF acid use in formations with more than 10% carbonate.

Compounds  of  calcium  carbonate,  magnesium  carbonate,  and  iron  compounds  are  soluble
in  hydrochloric  acid.  Sufficient  volumes  of  hydrochloric  acid  must  be  injected  ahead  of  HF
acid  to  dissolve  all  these  acid-soluble  materials  before  the  HF  acid  or  spent  HF  acid  reaches
them. The HF acid concentration is selected to prevent or reduce damaging precipitates as guid-
ed by recommendations in Table 7.4.34

anhydrite  (a  lower  water  content  than  gypsum)  occurs  in  certain  dolomitic  carbonates,  anhy-
drite  dissolves  in  proportion  to  HCl-acid  concentration  and  precipitates  as  acid  spends.  Even
though  a  weaker  HCl-acid  concentration  to  reduce  dissolution  of  anhydrite  or  calcium  sulfate
inhibitors are used, fluid recovery after treatment still must be rapid. Sandstone is more compli-
cated because many minerals may exist with different precipitating products.

Some  minerals  such  as  sodium  feldspar  will  automatically  precipitate  fluoride  compounds
when  more  than  3%  HF  acid  is  used.  Potassium  fluosilicate  will  precipitate  when  more  than
1.5% HF acid reacts with potassium feldspar. When HF acid is used in clay containing sand-
stone,  hydrous  silica  precipitates.  An  overflush  (displacement  by  compatible  brine)  displaces
precipitated hydrous silica 3 to 5 ft away from the wellbore, where it will do the least amount
of damage. As long as the precipitates move, the likelihood of permanent damage is reduced.
Shutting in a well after HF-acid injection can result in the formation of more silica gel. When
the well is returned to flow soon after the acid treatment, some of the precipitate near the well-
bore may be produced and help clean up the formation. If too little hydrochloric acid preflush
is used in formations with 5 to 15% carbonate, residual carbonate near the wellbore will react
with  spent  HF  acid  (fluosilicic  acid  or  aluminum  fluoride)  and  cause  excessive  precipitation.

IV-290

These  hydrated  precipitates  occupy  more  volume  than  that  of  the  original  clay  and  carbonate
dissolved.

Dissolved iron minerals can precipitate in the formation. Ferric iron precipitates before acid
spends  to  its  normal  pH  of  about  4.  The  precipitation  of  up  to  10,000  ppm  iron  in  solution
may be prevented by adequate treatment with a complexing agent such as NTA, EDTA, citric
acid, or combinations of acetic and citric acid. Damage from precipitated iron minerals is com-
pounded  by  the  high  iron  concentration  that  comes  off  the  surface  of  the  tubing  during  acid
injection. New manufactured tubing has a crust of mill scale or magnetite, which is a form of
ferric/ferrous oxide.  This  mill scale is  loosened  by  the  acid during  acid injection. Particles of
mill  scale  can  then  be  injected  into  the  perforations  and  may  be  trapped  there.  Injected  acid
continues to dissolve the mill, scale creating ferric chloride that enters the formation. This iron
combines with iron from iron-oxide minerals, iron-rich chlorite clay, or other iron compounds
in the formation to create more iron-hydroxide precipitates. This damage is lessened by pick-
ling  new  tubing  to  remove  mill  scale  and  then  circulating  the  pickling  acid  back  out  of  the
well before acidizing the formation. Older steel tubing stored outdoors (especially in coastal or
marine  environments)  develop  a  coating  of  iron  oxide  (rust),  which  dissolves  much  faster  in
hot acid than does mill scale (iron magnetite).

7.17 Methods of Controlling Precipitates
Methods to control the precipitates caused by acidizing are acid staging, lower acid concentra-
tions, and overflushing.

7.17.1 Preflush.  Preflush  with  either  5  to  15%  HCl  or  5  to  10%  acetic  acid.  In  formations
with  over  1%  carbonate,  an  HC1  or  acetic  acid  preflush  dissolves  the  carbonate  to  prevent
waste of HF acid and formation of the insoluble precipitate calcium fluoride. Calcium and sodi-
um  chloride  workover  brine  also  must  be  flushed  away  from  the  wellbore  with  HCl  acid  or
ammonium  chloride  brine.  Preflushes  also  displace  and  isolate  incompatible  formation  fluids
(either brine or crude oil). Higher concentrations of ammonium chloride (> 3%) are recommend-
ed where swellable smectite and mixed layer clays are present.33,35

7.17.2 Treatment.  Treat with an adequate volume of proper concentration HF acid. For suc-
cessful  HF  acidizing,  more  than  120  gal/ft  of  HF/HCl  acid  is  usually  required.  Less  may  be
used where only shallow, moderate damage exists (e.g., 25 to 75 gal/ft is sometimes used on
new perforations to remove damage or as a spearhead treatment in perforation breakdown prior
to hydraulic fracturing in tight sandstone). The concentration, 3% HF to 12% HCl acid (often
referred to as regular mud acid), is the usual concentration for damage removal in clean, quart-
zose  sands.  Concentrations  of  0.5  to  1.5%  HF  are  more  effective  in  other  clay  containing
sands. When the combined percentage of clay and feldspar is more than 30%, use 1.5% HF or
less.  In  some  low-permeability  sandstone,  HF  concentrations  as  low  as  0.5%  HF  have  been
used  (e.g.,  the  Morrow  formation  in  Texas  and  New  Mexico).  If  in  doubt,  consider  an  acid
response test on a typical core or a geochemical acidizing simulator. See Table 7.4 for suggest-
ed  acid  concentrations  that  may  be  modified  according  to  the  information  presented  in  the
following sections.

7.17.3 Postflush or Overflush.  An overflush displaces unreacted HF acid into the formation,
displaces HF-acid reaction products away from the wellbore, cleans corrosion inhibitors to re-
store  a  water-wet  condition  and  good  oil/gas  effective  permeability,  and  re-establishes  oil/gas
saturation near the wellbore.

Typical overflushes for HF acid treatments are 3% ammonium chloride brine, weak acid (3
to 7.5% HCl acid) and filtered diesel oil or aromatic solvent (oil wells only) or nitrogen (gas
wells  only).  The  volume  of  overflush  should  be  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  HF  acid  stage

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-291

volume. For most wells, an overflush of at least 200 gal/ft displaces spent acid past the critical
flow radius of 3 to 5 ft. This large overflush reduces near wellbore precipitation of amorphous
silica. At formation temperatures of 200°F or more, this precipitation occurs while the HF acid
is being pumped into the formation. This precipitate is somewhat mobile at first but may setup
as a gel after flow stops. Overflushing with 3% ammonium chloride or weak acid dilutes and
disperses  precipitate  away  from  the  wellbore.  Often,  the  overflush  is  3%  ammonium  chloride
with 10% ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGMBE) and a polyquarternary amine clay stabiliz-
er.  However,  high-cation  capacity  clays  may  swell  as  a  result  of  injecting  preflushes  or
overflushes  of  brines  or  acid  with  concentrations  lower  than  4%.  Where  significant  quantities
of  smectite  and  mixed  layer  clays  are  found,  Gdanski  and  Schuchart33  recommend  the  use  of
5%  ammonium  chloride  brine.  This  is  supported  by  the  work  of  Al-Anazi  et  al.35  Gidley
et al.36 state that carbon dioxide preflushes and overflushes also have proven effective in some
wells.  Other  chemicals  can  be  added  to  acid  to  prevent  or  reduce  the  precipitation  of  some
compounds  (e.g.,  iron  complexing  agents,  sulfate  scale  inhibitors,  and  sludge  preventers).
Table  7.5  summarizes  the  steps  to  prevent  or  control  incompatibilities  in  acidizing  different
formations and formation fluids.37

Recent work has provided additional field cases of new types of acid damage from miner-
als  in  the  formation  such  as  zeolite,38  chlorite,39,40  and  carbonate  minerals  precipitating  alu-
minum  fluoride  complexes  created  by  HF  acid.36  The  experimental  works  of  Shuchart  and
others41–43  provide  a  better  understanding  of  HF  acid  chemistry  and  precipitation  of  HF  acid
reaction  products.  Shuchart42  summarized  HF  acid  reactions  into  primary,  secondary,  and  ter-
tiary  reactions.  The  primary  reaction  for  HF  acid  dissolves  damage  and  whole  clay  with  no
precipitation.

In  the  secondary  reaction,  fluosilicic  acid  (a  product  of  the  primary  dissolution  of  clay  or
silica by HF acid) dissolves clay in formation and precipitates hydrous silica. This reaction can

IV-292

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

reduce clay damage deeper in the formation. Stronger acid (12% HCl and 3% HF acid) creates
higher silica concentrations from the primary dissolution of clays and silica, which precipitate
in  subsequent  reactions  deeper  in  the  formation.  In  higher-temperature  formations,  this  silica
precipitates closer to the wellbore and reduces permeability.

In the tertiary reaction, HCl acid and aluminum fluoride complexes react slowly to dissolve
clays and precipitate hydrous silica but proceed faster at temperatures in excess of 00°F. This
reaction  exacerbates  post-acid  scale  precipitation.  The  slower  tertiary  reactions  occur  in  most
acid treatments in the 8- to 24-hour time period that the acid system typically remains in the
formation.

7.18 Acid Treatment Design
Once  you  determine  that  a  well  is  a  good  candidate  for  matrix  acidizing  and  have  selected
appropriate  acids,  you  are  ready  to  design  the  treatment.  Essentially,  the  design  process  is  a
systematic approach to estimating and calculating injection pressure and rate, volumes, and con-
centrations.  Live  HF  acid  usually  penetrates  only  about  6  to  12  in.  into  the  sandstone  before
spending. If acid can easily reach nearby plugging solids, small volumes of 25 to 50 gal/ft of
HF-type  acid  can  dissolve  this  damage;  however,  with  more  severe  damage,  more  time  and
volume are needed to reach the plugging solids. Effective acid diversion reduces acid volumes
needed.

7.19 Matrix Acidizing Design Guidelines
The recommended steps in treatment design are given next.

• Estimate safe injection pressures: determine present fracturing gradient, determine present
bottomhole fracturing pressure, and determine allowable safe injection pressure at both the well-
bore  (at  least  200  psi  below  fracturing  pressure)  and  at  the  surface  (tubing  and  wellhead
pressure limitations).

• Estimate safe injection rate into the damage-free formation.
• Estimate safe injection rate into damaged formation.
• Select stages required for fluid compatibility.
• Calculate volume of each stage required: crude oil displacement, formation brine displace-
ment,  acetic  acid  stage,  hydrochloric  acid  stage,  hydrofluoric  acid  (HF  and  HCl  acid)  stage,
and overflush stage.

• Select  acid  concentrations  according  to  formation  mineralogy.  More  detailed  procedures
with a calculated example are available in Ref. 1. Table 7.6 provides a one-page summary and
guide to selecting fluid stages and volume.

7.20 Acid Type and Concentration
Permeability  and  mineralogy  determine  the  compatible  concentration  of  HCl  or  acetic  acid  in
the preflush stage and HF and HCl acid in the HF-/HCl-acid stage. Guidelines for proper con-
centrations are provided in Table 7.4. The background for the acid-use guidelines in Table 7.4
is given in Ref. 9. These guidelines are not absolutes and probably should be modified accord-
ing to more recent research. These guidelines were provided as a fairly conservative approach
to avoid problems that could occur with 12% HCl and 3% HF that were regularly used prior to
1985.  These  guidelines  helped  when  no  previous  experience  existed  in  acidizing  a  particular
formation.  Evaluated  experience  provides  the  most  reliable  information.  Acid  flow  tests  with
cores are reliable when long cores are used.44 These tests are expensive and, therefore, seldom
performed.

Gdanski43  recommends  13.5%  HCl  to  1.5%  HF  acid  for  high-feldspar  sandstone  and  9%
HCl  to  1%  HF  acid  for  clay-rich  formations  to  prevent  unwanted  precipitation  of  fluoride
scales. With more reactive clays and a higher carbonate content, acetic acid must be added to
the acid mixtures to maintain a lower pH and reduce the amount of post-acid precipitation. For

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-293

chlorite-rich sandstone, Simon and Anderson39 show the benefit of preflushing with 10% acetic
acid  and  dissolving  chlorite  with  10%  acetic  and  1%  HF  acid.  At  temperatures  higher  than
200°F,  Wehunt  et  al.40  recommend  decreasing  HF-acid  concentration  to  0.1%  HF  in  10%
acetic  acid  at  380°F.  However,  at  low  temperature  (less  than  125°F),  stronger  acids  are  re-
quired to remove damage, and secondary and tertiary reaction precipitates are minor.

The  guidelines  in  Table  7.4  do  not  specifically  address  permeability  between  10  and  100
md,  a  range  where  field  results  have  been  erratic.  Some  treatments  are  very  successful,  and
some result in little or no change. Proper selection is assisted by detailed petrographic studies,

IV-294

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

realistic core flow studies and/or reliable geochemical modeling. Pore throat sizes in these mod-
erate-permeability  formations  are  small  enough  to  screen  dispersed,  undissolved  clay-sized
fines or spent acid precipitates and cause internal pore plugging. Recent research has helped to
better define formation response to acids; however, as a practical matter, small hydraulic frac-
turing  treatments  are  simpler  and  more  cost-effective  than  matrix  acidizing  in  some  of  these
formations with permeability less than 50 md.

The guidelines for low permeability (less than 10 md) were based on treatments in which
breakdown  with  acid  probably  occurred  to  open  damaged  perforations.  The  lower  concentra-
tions prevented massive precipitation in the formation and damage to the isolating cement yet
were  sufficient  to  clean  up  some  perforation  damage.  Such  treatments  are  probably  obviated
now by the advent of tubing-conveyed perforating.

7.21 Retarded HF Acids
Retarded  HF  (RHF)  acids  offer  alternatives  to  the  acids  in  Table  7.4,  are  less  reactive  with
sandstone,  and  normally  result  in  deep  acid  penetration  into  the  formation.  Three  RHF  acids
that are based on boric acid, aluminum chloride, and a phosphoric acid were examined recently
with guidance for their use.45,46 A newer retarded sandstone acid is based on fluosilicic acid for
deeper  clay  dissolution.47  Fluosilicic  acid  can  be  injected  by  itself  into  a  sandstone  reservoir
without causing any damage as long as it is blended into HCl acid or an organic acid. These
acid  mixtures  improved  the  performance  of  two  Brazilian  water-injection  wells  by  removing
deep clay damage. A preflush of HCl or acetic acid must be used to dissolve carbonates ahead
of the fluosilicic acid to prevent tertiary precipitation of calcium/aluminum fluoride complexes.
In sandstone formations with more than 1% carbonate, the cost of sufficient acid preflush may
prohibit treatment of damage beyond 2 ft in depth.

7.22 Geochemical Models
Several geochemical models exist today that provide guidance on acid type and concentration.
The acidizing model of Thomas and Fannin48 predicts dissolution of rock to increase porosity
and permeability and incorporates the resistance of a diverting agent to ensure good acid cover-
age in a layered sandstone formation. The model does not consider precipitation and relies on
an expert system to choose appropriate acid types and concentrations. The model of Davies et
al.49 is based on equilibrium chemistry and predicts the improvement in porosity and permeabil-
ity by rock dissolution. It also predicts the porosity decrease by precipitation of species and the
final permeability of the rock around the wellbore as a result of net dissolution. It helps select
the volumes of acid required and the optimum acid types and concentrations to maximize well
performance.

Gdanski  and  Schuchart33  developed  a  geochemical  model  for  sandstone  acidizing  that  is
helpful to engineers dealing with acidizing of sandstone containing sensitive minerals like zeo-
lite  and  chlorite  clay  and  for  formation  temperatures  above  200°F.  Above  200°F,  various
organic acids are recommended for certain minerals.

Quinn et al.50 report on the application of a complex kinetic geochemical model to explore
the importance of the formation minerals, mineral precipitation, and the effect of acid and injec-
tion rate. A new permeability prediction model relates the permeability of a permeable medium
to  the  porosity,  grain-size  distribution,  and  the  amounts  and  identities  of  all  detrital  minerals
present and predicts productivity improvement. The optimal matrix stimulation is a compromise
between maximizing the dissolution of the damaging minerals and minimizing secondary pre-
cipitation.

An integrated matrix stimulation model by Bartko et al.51 for sandstone and carbonate for-
mations assists in determining formation damage, selection, and optimization of fluid volumes;
provides a pressure skin response of the acid treatment; and forecasts well productivity.

7.23 Acid Placement and Coverage
A  leading  cause  of  unsuccessful  acid  treatment  is  failure  to  contact  all  the  damage  with  the
acid.  Fluids  pumped  into  a  formation  take  the  path  of  least  resistance.  In  a  typical  treatment,
most acid enters the formation through the least damaged perforation tunnels, as the schematic
in Fig. 7.14 shows.9

When  this  happens,  it  is  easy  to  conclude  that  acidizing  is  very  expensive  and  does  not
work  well.  Acidizing  works  well  to  remove  damage  when  the  type  of  damage  is  known,  the
treatment is designed properly, and it is properly executed. Extreme damage may require more
than what is discussed. Actions required may include a chemical soak and swabbing the soak
back before acidizing or reperforating, and/or fracturing to bypass damage.

Numerous  methods  help  control  acid  placement.  Selection  is  based  on  wellbore  hardware,
formation  characteristics,  and  field  experience.  Additional  guidelines  are  provided  in  Ref.  1.
The four main types of zone coverage techniques in matrix acidizing are mechanical, particu-
late, viscosity, and density segregation. These methods also can be combined in treatments.

7.24 Mechanical Techniques

7.24.1 Opposed Cup Packer or Perforation Wash Tool.  This  perforation  wash  tool  allows
selective  injection  of  acid  into  closely  spaced  perforations  in  high-permeability  formations.
High rate and/or pressure should be avoided when using either this tool or closely spaced strad-
dle packers. High pressures can cause the cups to leak or turn over or the tool to separate at
the  port  (the  weakest  part).  High  pressure  can  also  establish  communication  behind  the  pipe
between  the  point  of  injection  and  nearby  perforations  without  removing  damage  from  the
plugged  perforation.  This  type  of  isolation  is  best  used  for  removing  damage  from  severely
plugged  perforations  in  high-permeability  formations.  A  field  example  of  this  technique  in  a
Gulf Coast sandstone is given by McLeod and Crawford.13

IV-296

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

7.24.2 Squeeze Packer and Retrievable Bridge Plug.  A good method of isolating perforated
intervals  is  to  use  a  retrievable  bridge  plug  and  a  squeeze  packer.  The  bridge  plug  is  set  in
blank  sections  of  casing  between  perforated  sections.  The  treatment  usually  begins  with  the
lower  set  of  perforations  and  finishes  with  the  upper  set.  Straddle  packers  may  be  used  in  a
similar  way  and  have  been  used  successfully  in  the  Permian  Basin  to  better  clean  damaged
perforations.

7.24.3 Ball Sealers.  Ball  sealers  can  be  divided  into  two  categories:  those  heavier  (sinkers)
and  those  lighter  (floaters)  than  the  fluid.  Successful  use  requires  a  good  cement  job  on  the
installed casing and round good quality perforation holes. Sinkers have been used the longest
and  usually  require  200%  excess  ball  sealers  and  a  high  pump  rate  (greater  than  5  bbl/min).
The high pump rate usually prohibits their use in sandstone matrix acidizing, but they may be
used  in  fracture  acidizing  or  perforation  breakdown.  Floaters,  or  neutral-density  ball  sealers,
provide  excellent  mechanical  isolation  for  matrix  acidizing  at  injection  rates  of  1  bbl/min  or
higher.  The  density  or  specific  gravity  of  these  ball  sealers  is  matched  to  the  fluid  being
pumped so better ball action will take place. Surface flowback equipment must be modified to
catch the floating ball sealers during flowback.

Ball sealers are limited in their use. They are not used in long intervals with high-perfora-
tion density, wells perforated with more than 4 shots/ft, low-rate treatments (¼ to ½ bbl/min),
and  gravel-packed  wells.  Regardless  of  the  type  of  treatment  or  ball  used,  treatment  will  be
more  effective  when  density  of  the  ball  is  very  close  to  the  density  of  the  fluid  used  in  the
treatment.

7.25 Particulates

7.25.1 Pregravel-Pack Acid Treatments.  One effective way to divert acid in a treatment be-
fore  gravel  packing  is  to  use  slugs  of  hydroxyethylcellulose  (HEC)  gel  and  gravel-pack  sand.
Ammonium  chloride  brine  mixed  with  HEC  at  a  concentration  of  90  lbm/1,000  gal  can  be
mixed in 5-bbl batches with 100 lbm of correctly sized gravel-pack sand. The combination of
viscosity  and  sand  packing  helps  divert  acid  to  other  perforations.  The  unique  feature  of  this
method,  as  opposed  to  other  “particulate  diverters,”  is  that  the  perforation  tunnel  is  packed
with  gravel-pack  sand  instead  of  some  other  material  that  would  prevent  gravel-pack  slurry
from entering the perforations during later slurry placement.

7.25.2 Soluble Particulate Diverters.  Selection of the optimal particulate diverter is based on
the kind of fluid injected and/or produced. The diverter must be temporary and easily removed;
otherwise,  there  will  be  a  new  kind  of  damage  to  be  treated  and  removed.  Oil-soluble  resin
(OSR)  is  one  of  today’s  more  common  diverting  agents.  OSR  is  slowly  soluble  in  toluene,
xylene,  condensate,  crude  oil,  and  EGMBE  (mutual  solvent).  OSR  should  be  mixed  on  site
with  a  blender  and  immediately  pumped  or  added  to  the  acid  “on  the  fly”  with  a  chemical
injection pump. If OSR diverters are mixed off location or are allowed to stand for an hour or
more, they will clump and may cause pump failure or plug perforations. OSR diverters should
not be used with solvent-acid mixtures, which dissolve the resin enough to reduce its effective-
ness.  The  chart  in  Fig.  7.15  shows  the  application  of  high  concentrations  of  OSR  to  achieve
significant  pressure  increases  by  more  effective  diverter  action.  The  annular  pressure  (static
column of fluid between the well tubing and coil tubing) shows pressure increases when divert-
er concentration increases.4 Please refer to Ref. 6 for a full explanation. Shown in Fig. 7.16 are
gamma  ray  logs  before  and  after  using  radioactive  tracers  with  OSR  diverters  in  a  California
well.9 Such tracers are excellent diagnostic tools to find where the acid is going. In this case,
radioactive intensity shows that most of the acid bypassed the preferred interval and went be-
hind the casing and entered a thief zone behind the pipe.

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-297

Fig. 7.15—Pressure response to acidizing using OSR diverter.6

Benzoic acid flakes or powder are soluble in toluene, xylene, alcohol, and some condensate
fluids. They dissolve very slowly in water/gas. Benzoic acid is often used because it is soluble
in the fluids normally encountered in oil/water wells; however, if not well dispersed or mixed,
it will plug perforations. Benzoic acid plugs do not dissolve fast because not enough fluid can
flow by it to dissolve the plug. One well took 6 months to return to normal productivity after
being treated with caked benzoic acid powder delivered to the location.

7.26 Viscous Acid
Thickening the acid through use of soluble polymers, nitrogen and foaming agents, or dispers-
ing  oil  (either  as  loose  two-phase  mixtures  or  with  emulsifiers)  is  useful  in  high-permeability
formations  with  deep  damage.  Design  is  difficult;  therefore,  experience  and  on-site  flexibility
are important for success. Excellent results have been obtained with staged foam slugs between

IV-298

acid  stages  in  high-permeability  Gulf  Coast  gas  wells  to  remove  near-wellbore  damage.  This
technique is so promising because the diverter (gas and fluid) disappears when the foam breaks
with little chance of damage as with slowly dissolving particulates. See Gdanski and Behanna52
for useful guidelines.

Fadele et al.53 show that diverters often need not be used in gas wells because of the natu-
ral viscous diversion. Water and acid are 100 times more viscous than gas, and this provides a
natural  diversion  for  acid  entering  a  gas  formation.  This  may  be  one  reason  acidizing  works
better in gas wells than in oil wells. Other recent papers offer further improvements with vis-
cous acids and diverters.54–56

Other  significant  factors  are  the  rathole  below  the  lowest  perforation  and  the  space  just
above the top perforation and below the packer. Rathole fluid should be heavier than the acid,
and fluid above the top perforation should be lighter than the acid. If not, acid can end up in
the  rathole  rather  than  the  formation.  Acid  left  in  the  borehole  can  cause  casing  leaks  below

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-299

the  treated  interval.  Spotting  acid  over  the  perforations  before  injecting  is  very  important  in
low  to  moderate  permeability  (10  to  50  md),  and  density  segregation  must  be  planned  to
achieve the best contact of acid with damaged perforations in these formations. Concentric tub-
ing  helps  to  achieve  accurate  placement  of  the  acid  in  the  wellbore  to  take  advantage  of
density segregation.

7.26.1 Concentric Tubing.  Concentric tubing is preferred for matrix acid treatments because
it  allows  the  rathole  to  be  circulated  clean,  permits  better  placement  for  acid  contact  with  all
perforations,  bypasses  production  or  injection  tubing  debris,  can  be  acid  cleaned  on  surface
before running into the hole, and limits pump rate to 0.5 to 1 bbl/min because of fluid friction
pressure in small tubing (1 to 1.5 in.).

7.27 Advances in Acid Diversion
The design and implementation of diverting systems has been advanced by recent design tech-
niques  but  still  relies  on  guidelines  and  field  experience.  Hill  and  Rossen57  have  provided  a
better means to compare diverting methods and design diverting treatments. Gdanski and Behen-
na52 have provided some appropriate guidelines for foamed acids or foamed-diverter stages.

Hill and Rossen compared the techniques of injection rate diversion, coined MAPDIR (max-
imum  pressure  differential  and  injection  rates);  particulate  diverting  agents;  viscosified  fluids;
and foamed acid. MAPDIR results in effective treatment of lower-permeability layers but at the
expense  of  much  larger  volumes  of  acid.  It  may  also  be  limited  in  use  by  pump  and  tubing
capacities. Wells can clean up faster because no particulates are used. Also, treatment time is
less to achieve the same reduction in skin factor as other techniques. The particulate diverting
is most efficient in terms of volumes of acid and, thereby, is generally more economic if treat-
ing time is not a large economic factor. Oil soluble resins are not completely oil soluble, and
sometimes plugging by these resins may not be temporary. Better quality assurance/quality con-
trol  (QA/QC)  is  required  for  successful  implementation.  Quality  assurance  is  the  pretreatment
planning  to  ensure  that  proper  materials  and  procedures  are  used.  Quality  control  is  on-site
supervision and testing to ensure that quality treatment is performed. Foam diversion is nondam-
aging  in  that  surfactants  are  soluble  and  removable  in  produced  water  and  nitrogen  is  recov-
ered.  Foams  are  most  difficult  to  design  and  are  not  completely  understood  in  terms  of  their
behavior in different formations; however, guidelines for designing and implementing foam treat-
ments are provided by Gdanski and Behenna.52 Foams tend to be more stable in high-permeabil-
ity  layers  and,  therefore,  reduce  the  acid  losses  in  these  layers.  They  also  tend  to  be  more
stable in water zones and less stable in oil layers, providing some selectivity in treating wells
with high water cuts or nearby bottom water. Viscosified fluids are similar to foam but provide
a  more  consistent  fluid  hydrostatic  pressure  when  well  pressure  limitations  are  present.  The
viscous behavior of these fluids in different formations is not well defined. These systems may
be combined with MAPDIR when rate is limited by equipment.

7.28 Horizontal Wells
Horizontal wells are special cases, which have been covered by Frick and Economides.58 They
emphasize how damage control and removal is just as important in horizontal wells as in verti-
cal  completions.  Moderate  damage  can  reduce  horizontal  well  productivity  to  that  below  the
productivity  of  an  undamaged  vertical  well.  The  authors  provide  a  stimulation  technique  em-
ploying  coiled  tubing.  They  also  provide  a  design  strategy  for  calculating  volumes  of  acid
required and the rate of coiled-tubing withdrawal during acid placement. A method of optimiza-
tion  for  completion  and  stimulation  of  horizontal  wells  is  also  presented.  Other  papers  have
further advanced the planning, design, diversion, execution, and evaluation of acidizing horizon-
tal wells employing similar methods to those used in vertical wells.59,60

7.29 Acid Additives
An acid additive is any material blended with acid to modify its behavior. Because acid is so
naturally corrosive, the development of an additive to reduce acid attack on steel pipe was the
first requirement for successful acidizing. Development of a suitable corrosion inhibitor started
the acidizing service industry in 1932. Comprehensive testing and application of corrosion in-
hibitors is still necessary in successful acidizing. Many acid additives are available, but those
that  are  usually  necessary  are  corrosion  inhibitors,  surfactants,  and  iron  control  agents.  Any
other additives are optional and should not be used unless specific well conditions dictate their
use and have been thoroughly tested for compatibility with the formation fluids and the neces-
sary additives. A mutual solvent in the overflush may be beneficial.

7.29.1 Corrosion Inhibitor.  By  nature  of  its  adsorption  on  solid  surfaces,  the  corrosion  in-
hibitor is a surface-active agent with a unique purpose—to protect pipe rather than to change
acid behavior in the formation. Corrosion inhibitors do not stop corrosion; they greatly reduce
the reaction rate of acid with steel. Proper selection and application of corrosion inhibitors also
reduce pitting (the tendency of acid to corrode or dissolve metal deeply in specific sites). Cor-
rosion  inhibitors  are  cationic  and  oil  wetters.  This  is  the  mechanism  by  which  they  adsorb
(plate  out)  on  a  metal  surface  and  form  an  oil-wet  film  to  protect  the  iron  from  exposure  to
acid.  Plating  out  and  oil  wetting  also  occur  in  the  formation,  especially  on  clay  minerals.  To
compensate  for  this,  other  additives,  such  as  surfactants  and  mutual  solvents,  are  used  to  re-
store water-wetness and maximize permeability to oil.

Pitting  corrosion  is  very  detrimental  to  the  integrity  of  pipe.  Reasons  for  pitting  are  in-
hibitor breakdown with time and temperature, insufficient inhibitor for wellbore conditions, and
metal impurities in pipe. Factors that affect corrosion are pipe metallurgy, type acid, acid con-
centration,  temperature,  inhibitor  solubility  in  the  acid,  inhibitor  concentration,  contact  time
with steel, inhibitor aids, and compatibility with other acids and additives such as organic acid,
surfactants, alcohol, and solvent in the acid.

Service  companies  perform  extensive  lab  testing  in  combination  with  additives  to  provide
data to estimate the time of protection of pipe during the course of acid exposure to tubing in
an acid treatment. The type of inhibitors and conditions in which they are used are many and
complex. The engineer works closely with the stimulation specialist to ensure the proper selec-
tion  and  use  of  corrosion  inhibitors  in  oil/gas  wells.  Usually,  less  than  5  mils  of  tubing
corrosion should be allowed by the inhibitor in an acid treatment (equivalent to 0.025 lbm/ft2
of tubing surface area) at temperatures less than 200°F.

7.29.2 Surface Active Agents.  Surface active agents are molecules composed of an oil-soluble
group  and  a  water-soluble  group.  These  chemicals  lower  the  interfacial  tension  between  the
immiscible  fluids.  They  also  adsorb  on  rock  surfaces  and  can  alter  the  natural  wettability  of
rock.  Surfactants  are  classified  into  four  major  groups  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  water-
soluble  part  of  the  molecule.  These  divisions  are  anionic  (water-soluble  end  is  anionic),
cationic (water-soluble end is cationic), nonionic (do not ionize—one end of molecule is water-
soluble,  the  other  is  oil-soluble),  and  amphoteric  (water-soluble  end  may  be  anionic,  cationic,
or uncharged depending on the pH of the system).

The primary use of surfactants is in emulsion prevention in acid/oil interactions. Other uses
are  as  wetting  agents,  penetrating  agents,  sludge  preventers  and  foaming  agents,  acid  solvent
dispersant,  mud  dispersants,  emulsion  breakers,  retarders,  and  suspending  agents.  Surfactants
should be tested for performance as emulsion breakers for crude/oil acid systems in both live
acid and spent acid.

7.29.3 Iron-Control Agents.  Iron control uses several different products to keep iron in solu-
tion: iron complexing agents, iron reducing agents, and hydrogen sulfide scavengers.

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-301

7.29.4 Iron-Complexing  Agents.    Iron  in  solution  has  two  forms:  ferric  and  ferrous.  Ferric
iron is often called iron (III), and ferrous iron is often called iron (II). The oxidized form, iron
(III), precipitates in spent acid around a pH of 1 to 2. Iron (II) does not precipitate as ferrous
hydroxide  until  a  pH  of  7  is  reached,  well  beyond  the  final  equilibrium  of  spent  HCl  acid,
which  is  around  a  pH  of  5.  Normally,  the  ferrous  iron  is  not  a  problem  in  acid  treatments;
however,  there  are  three  exceptions.  If  acid  is  pumped  into  a  new  well  that  has  been  drilled
with caustic water-based mud, the mud filtrate in the formation may still have a pH of 11 or
higher. Mixing of spent acid with this mud filtrate precipitates ferrous hydroxide. Ferrous iron
also precipitates in a sour environment where hydrogen sulfide is dissolved in the brine, oil, or
natural  gas.  The  only  effective  remedy  to  keep  iron  (II)  in  solution  where  hydrogen  sulfide
exists is to use a hydrogen sulfide scavenger to make the sulfide unavailable for precipitating
ferrous  sulfide  at  a  pH  of  2.  Complexing  agents  do  not  prevent  the  precipitation  of  iron
sulfide.28 A third problem long term is the presence of iron (II) in the presence of undissolved
calcium carbonate. Iron (II) can precipitate slowly as ferrous carbonate—a slowly forming car-
bonate scale. This usually does not impede flow in carbonate rocks but may in sandstone with
excess  carbonate  because  the  sand  grain  matrix  can  screen  the  precipitate.  Addition  of  acetic
acid to the preflush maintains a low-pH environment to prevent the iron carbonate precipitation.
Ferric  oxide  and  ferrous  sulfide  are  frequently  found  in  water-injection  wells  in  surface
pipe, tubing and borehole, and in the formation. The iron oxide is present from air contamina-
tion in the injected water. Iron sulfide is present from bacterial action in the injected water or
formation. Ferric oxide is common in all acid treatments. The main source is a coating of mill
scale  or  rust  on  the  surface  of  the  tubing  or  piping  used  in  stimulation.  This  is  usually  the
source of the most damaging iron concentrations in acid. Iron-complexing agents can only com-
plex iron concentrations of up to 10,000 ppm. Acid can dissolve iron from tubing walls as high
as  100,000  ppm.  No  complexing  agent  can  complex  this  much  iron.  Two  important  steps  in
controlling iron in acidizing are pickling treating strings prior to acidizing and using iron reduc-
ing agents. Acid pickling treatments are covered later in the section on job execution; however,
the purpose of pickling tubing is to clean the tubing of easily dissolved iron and bring it back
to the surface for disposal. This procedure reduces the amount of ferric iron in solution during
the subsequent injection of acid into the formation.

7.29.5 Iron-Reducing Agents.   The  most  common  iron-reducing  agent  is  erythorbic  acid—a
cousin  to  vitamin  C.  Erythorbic  acid  is  added  to  the  acid  to  reduce  any  ferric  ion  to  ferrous
iron before it enters the formation. The use of a reducing agent does not take the place of acid
pickling the treating string. Even though pickling removes most of the easily dissolvable iron
oxide from the tubing, enough iron oxide remains after pickling so that a reducing agent is still
necessary  during  the  acid  treatment.  Some  formations  contain  iron  oxide  in  the  formation  so
that iron complexing agents are still needed along with the reducing agent as a safeguard. The
complexing  agents  most  commonly  used  are  shown  in  Table  7.7.61  One  of  the  favorite  iron-
control agents is the combination of citric and acetic acid. Citric acid by itself is limited to 15
lbm/1,000 gal of acid because of limited solubility in the acid. Acetic acid permits mixing high-
er loadings of citric acid (up to 100 lbm/1,000 gal) and also maintains a low pH in spent acid
to  keep  iron  (III)  in  solution.  Improved  techniques  and  procedures  have  advanced  the  control
of dissolved iron in acid treatments.62,63,28

7.29.6 Hydrogen Sulfide Control.  Common chelating agents are ineffective for iron control in
sour  environments.  Systems  containing  hydrogen  sulfide  contain  only  ferrous  iron  [iron  (II)]
species. The only effective method of preventing precipitation of iron sulfide during sour-well
acid treatments is to remove hydrogen sulfide from the fluid with sulfide scavenger products. If
there is any possibility of ferric iron [iron (III)] being injected from surface containers or pipe,
a reducing agent should be added in the acid to reduce the dissolved iron (III) to iron (II).

IV-302

7.29.7 Other Additives.  The “other” category of additives consists of those that are optional
for special conditions and are not commonly needed in all treatments. They should not be used
unless they have been thoroughly tested for compatibility with all formation fluids. These addi-
tives are mutual solvents, clay stabilizers, acid diverting agents, calcium sulfate scale inhibitors,
and gelling agents.

7.29.8 Mutual Solvents.  A mutual solvent is soluble in either oil or water. For this reason, it
is very effective in sandstone acidizing, in which it is important to keep all solids water-wet.
Mutual solvents are either EGMBE or other modified glycol ethers. They improve the solubili-
ty of corrosion inhibitors in the spent acid in the formation and compatibility of inhibitors with
emulsion preventers and other additives. The most important property is to reduce the adsorp-
tion of corrosion inhibitors on residual clay particles in the formation and to help maintain water-
wetting for maximum oil/gas flow after acidizing. A mutual solvent also reduces residual water
saturation (spent acid) following a treatment. Gas wells clean up better by keeping surfactants
in solution rather than adsorbing on sand and clay too near the wellbore.

Alcohol.  Methyl  alcohol  and  isopropyl  alcohol  have  been  used  for  many  years  to  aid  in
cleaning up water-blocked gas wells. On occasion, 10 to 20% alcohol is used in acid to stimu-
late  moderately  low-permeability  (5  to  50  md)  gas  sands  to  speed  the  cleanup  of  spent  acid.
The normal concentrations of mutual solvents and alcohol are listed in the Table 7.8.1

7.29.9 Clay Stabilizers.  Clay minerals or other fines may move in the formation, particularly
during water production. Also, some clays can be dispersed or swell when contacted with fresh
water or low-salinity brines.

Cationic  polymers  are  sometimes  used  in  brine  or  acid  to  stabilize  clays.  These  cationic
polymers  do  not  oil-wet  sands  because  the  end  of  the  molecule  projecting  from  the  adsorbed
end  is  water  soluble.  Clay  stabilizers  used  include  polyquaternary  amines,  polyamines,  and
cationic surfactants. Polyquaternary amines have been the most effective, with polyamines sec-
ond.  The  use  of  cationic  surfactants  for  clay  control  is  not  recommended  except  in  water-

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-303

injection  wells  in  water-sensitive  formations.  A  wide  variance  in  opinion  exists  as  to  how  to
best apply these products. Clay stabilizers are most often used in the overflush following an HF-
acid  treatment  in  sandstone  formations.  Most  of  the  clay  stabilizers  are  not  affected  by  HCl
acid but are dislodged by HF acid. It is not recommended to use more than 20 gal/1,000 gal.

Acid Diverters.  Diverting agents (discussed earlier) are best used in acidizing damaged per-
forations so that acid is distributed more evenly to all perforations regardless of the degree of
plugging or variations in permeability. The diverting agents should ideally be either degradable
or partially soluble in produced oil and/or water. Uses in gas wells are limited and difficult to
clean up; foamed acid is a better means of diversion in gas wells. Some guidelines for diverter
use are listed in Tables 7.964 and 7.10.

IV-304

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

7.29.10 Calcium Sulfate Inhibitors.  When  acidizing  formations  with  a  high-sulfate-ion  con-
tent in the formation water (usually greater than 1,000 ppm) or rock containing anhydrite, it is
advisable to include a calcium sulfate inhibitor in the acid. The inhibitor is usually phosphonic
acid, polyacrylate, or other material.

7.29.11 Gelling Agents.  Acids  may  be  thickened  for  diversion  during  acidizing  with  soluble
polymers  such  as  xanthan  (a  biopolymer)  or  acrylamide  polymers.  Higher  viscosity  may  be
obtained  with  crosslinking  metal  ions  or  ligands.  Certain  surfactants  may  be  used  to  thicken
acid through the formation of surfactant micelles.

7.29.12 Summary Remarks.  In 1999, Coulter and Jennings65 updated industry experience in
the use of acids and additives. Many chemical additives are proprietary compositions, but the
service company has detailed instructions for mixing and use. It also has facilities and person-
nel to carry out acid and additive testing for well treatment. The operating engineer’s knowl-
edge of the well and the reservoir and the service company engineer’s knowledge of chemical
products and treatment processes are required to recommend appropriate treatment fluids. This
partnering improves the quality of acid treatments.

7.30 Job Supervision
The  key  to  successful  job  execution  is  thorough  and  effective  job  supervision.  The  operating
company responsible for supervising the job must prepare the well before the service company
administers the acid treatment; monitor the progress of the project before, during, and after the
treatment; and properly evaluate the results. The most important tasks associated with job super-
vision are those related to safety, well preparation, and quality control.

7.31 Safety and Environment Protection

7.31.1 Safety.  The main safety precautions for those on site during an acid treatment concern
detection of leaks and proper handling of acid. Pressure tests are performed with water or brine
to ensure the absence of leaks in pressure piping, tubing, and packer. Leaks on the surface can
endanger service personnel, and subsurface leaks can cause subsequent corrosion of tubing and
casing  in  the  annulus.  Anyone  around  acid  tanks  or  pressure  connections  should  wear  safety
goggles for eye protection. Those handling chemicals and valves should wear protective gauntlet-
type, acid-resistant gloves. Fresh water and spray washing equipment should be available at the
job  site.  In  case  of  acid  contact  with  the  eyes,  immediately  flush  eyes  with  clean  water  and
consult a physician. If acid contacts the skin, wash the area of contact with water for 15 min-
utes. Consult a physician immediately after flushing if hydrofluoric acid comes in contact with
skin  or  eyes.  Wear  self-contained,  full-face,  fresh-air  masks  when  potential  hydrogen  sulfide
gas hazards exist. Also, testing equipment and appropriate safety equipment should be on hand
to  monitor  the  working  area  and  protect  personnel  in  the  area.  Special  scrubbing  equipment
may  be  required  for  removal  of  toxic  gases.  Further  information  on  safety  with  acid  can  be
found  in  API  Bull.  D15,  Recommendations  for  Proper  Usage  and  Handling  of  Inhibited  Oil-
field  Acids66  and  in  Data  Sheet  634,  Safe  Well  Stimulation  by  Acidizing  from  the  National
Safety Council.67

7.31.2 Environment Protection.  Proper handling and disposal of acid and spent acid products
should  be  observed.  Often,  environmental  hazards  can  be  reduced  or  prevented  by  the  proper
choice of chemical additives at optimum concentrations. The acid flowbacks are normally pro-
cessed in a test separator. Oil goes to the water/oil separation system, and the aqueous phase is
filtered and treated with activated carbon for overboard disposal in accordance with regulatory
guidelines of oil and grease measurements. This process, used in many offshore operations, is

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-305

described  in  an  article  by  Ali.68  Regulatory  guidelines69  are  available  to  control  and  monitor
discharges  of  well  workover  fluids  containing  oil  or  grease.  Overboard  discharges  must  meet
42  mg/L  daily  maximum  and  29  mg/L  monthly  average  oil  and  grease  limits.  There  are  no
acute and chronic toxicity measurement requirements at present.

7.32 Well Preparation
Treating  fluids  must  leave  surface  tanks,  travel  through  surface  pipe  and  well  tubing,  enter  a
wellbore,  and  pass  through  the  perforations  into  the  formation  so  that  the  solvent  can  react
with  the  damaging  solids.  Each  of  these  components  through  which  the  fluid  travels  must  be
properly cleaned before pumping acid into the formation. Surface tanks must be cleaned before
being filled with acid. The best tanks are rubber lined and cleaned of any formerly contained
materials before the new acid and additives are added to the tank. Surface lines through which
the acid is pumped should be cleaned with acid before the treatment. A small amount of acid
can be flushed through the lines and into waste containment before final hookup for the well
treatment. This also can be accomplished in the step for acid cleaning well tubing.

7.32.1 Borehole Cleanout.  The well should be adequately prepared before the service compa-
ny arrives on site to perform the acid treatment. If possible, wellbore fill should be circulated
out  to  remove  any  solids  and  sludge  that  have  accumulated  in  the  rathole  and/or  isolated  by
placing  a  heavy  brine  in  the  rathole  prior  to  acidizing.  If  the  formation  pressure  is  very  low,
care must be taken to prevent the loss of accumulated sludge and other materials to the forma-
tion. Any fluid-loss additives selected should dissolve in the produced well fluids, such as oil-
soluble resins or benzoic acid particulates.

Fluids used to load the well prior to injecting acid should be filtered to a “superclean” state
to prevent any damage during injection testing before acidizing—typically to less than 50 ppm
for  solids  and  less  than  2  microns  for  size.  No  produced  lease  water  should  be  used  because
these produced waters usually are contaminated with emulsion breakers or corrosion inhibitors
often  found  in  water/oil  separation  facilities  and  may  also  contain  suspended  solid  hydrocar-
bons and clay particles. Emulsion breakers and corrosion inhibitors in produced water can oil-
wet the formation and reduce productivity, and suspended solids are very damaging.

7.32.2 Acid Cleaning Tubing.  In addition to borehole cleanout, acid clean the tubing and sur-
face piping before injecting acid into the formation to prevent plugging of the perforations by
solids released from the tubing. Fig. 7.17 shows the characteristics of acid being pumped down
tubing in a well.7

Pumping  acid  through  tubing  releases  solids  deposited  on  the  pipe  surface.  Acid-insoluble
solids like pipe dope, paraffin, asphalt, and gypsum or barite scales may plug the perforations
and even fill the wellbore. Acid-soluble solids like calcium carbonate may just spend the acid,
whereas dissolved iron oxide or iron sulfide may precipitate as the acid spends on other miner-
als  in  the  formation.  Either  acid  cleaning  the  tubing  and  reversing  to  surface  containment  or
bypassing the production tubing with an acid-cleaned concentric tubing string prevents perfora-
tion plugging from tubing deposits.

The  dissolution  of  mill scale and/or  rust  in  the  tubing  can  theoretically lead to  concentra-
tions  as  high  as  75,000  ppm  in  acid,  and  field  acid  cleaning  tests  confirmed  this.  Iron
complexing agents can prevent ferric hydroxide precipitation from acid with up to 10,000 ppm
iron.

For high-pressure reservoirs, acid may be pumped down the tubing close to the bottom and
then  flowed  back  to  the  surface  containment.  If  the  reservoir  pressure  will  not  hold  the  acid
hydrostatic column, foamed acid may be used to clean the tubing, or a work string can be run
with a packer, isolation valve, and circulating tool to isolate the formation while acid cleaning

IV-306

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

the tubing. If a work string is not used and if the production tubing cannot be cleaned proper-
ly, it should be bypassed using a concentric tubing string to pump the acid.

A concentric tubing string can be used to circulate accumulated sludge below the perforated
interval with clean brine before acid injection. Injection wells may have accumulated corrosion
deposits  and/or  bacterial  slimes.  Producing  wells  may  have  loose  scale  deposits,  hydrocarbon
solids,  or  produced  formation  fines.  Recent  papers70–73  have  provided  additional  guidance  on
tubing cleaning and pickling.

7.33 Quality Control
Quality control checks before, during, and after pumping increase the probability of acidizing
success. Onsite supervisors are encouraged to check the equipment.

• Inspect all tanks that will be used to hold acid or water. The tanks must be clean. Small

amounts of dirt, mud, or other debris can destroy any acid job.

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-307

• Make sure the service company has the equipment to circulate the acid tank prior to pump-
ing. This must be done to avoid emulsion problems and to protect the tubing. Acid corrosion
inhibitors and other additives can separate to the top of the tank in as little as 2 hours.

• The line to the pit or tank should be laid and ready to connect to the wellhead so the acid

can be backflowed immediately after the end of the overflush.

Field  supervisors  are  focusing  more  on  acid  quality  control.  Guidelines  are  provided  by

King and Holman64 and elsewhere.34

7.33.1 Injection Testing.  When in doubt that the formation will take acid, inject a compatible
“superclean”  filtered  brine  to  test  the  ability  of  the  formation  to  take  fluid.  If  the  test  shows
severe damage, the operation may be changed to include an acid minisqueeze prior to the main
acid job to make sure that the formation is open to fluid. Zhu and Hill74 showed that a pretreat-
ment  test  could  be  used  to  evaluate  permeability  and  skin  factor  prior  to  treatment.  The
monitoring  program  followed  evolution  of  skin  even  with  diversion  effects.  The  program  is
reliable and flexible for acquiring and processing data, calculating skin, and diagnosing matrix
acidizing treatments.

7.33.2 Sampling  and  Titration.    Sampling  of  all  pumped  fluids  for  solids  content  and  acid
titration for  HCl-  and  HF-acid  concentration should  be  performed  on  site  as  a  quality control
measure. Samples of spent acid should be analyzed for pH immediately and then kept in air-
tight containers for chemical analysis. Large variations in acid concentrations delivered to the
well site have been found. Delivered acid concentrations are usually more accurate and consis-
tent when a known on-site titration program is to be used. Premixed acid should be rolled and
circulated to make sure that all additives are properly dispersed and that none, especially corro-
sion inhibitors, have separated and floated to the top of acid tanks or have sunk to the bottom.
Titration of acid is an excellent test to see whether acid is well mixed. In one case, 15% HCl
acid was sampled and titrated to show 6% HCl acid. The acid tank was “rolled” to mix well
and titrated again. This time, it titrated as 15% HCl acid. Poorly-mixed acid can result in high-
ly  varied  acid  concentrations  (5  to  25%  in  an  average  15%  HCl-acid  mix)  with  similar
variations in corrosion inhibitors and other additives. Such a variable mix will exacerbate corro-
sion,  emulsion  problems,  and  acid/formation  interactions.  Also,  high  acid  strength  can  harm
tubing and certain formations. Surfactants should be checked to ensure that they leave the rock
minerals in a water-wet condition for optimum oil flow.

7.34 Injection-Rate Control and Monitoring
The  main  acid  job  should  be  circulated  in  place  with  HCl  acid  placed  across  the  formation
before  the  packer  is  set  or  before  the  bypass  valve is  closed.  All  perforations should  be  cov-
ered by acid before injection starts. Injection should start at a predetermined injection rate and
the pressure observed to determine the condition of the wellbore. If the pressure rises close to
the  pressure  limit, the  rate should  be  cut  in  half  until the  pressure  stabilizes at  a  level below
the  formation  fracturing  pressure.  When  the  HF  acid  stage  reaches  the  formation,  a  pressure
drop  is  normally  observed.  The  rate  should  not  be  changed  as  long  as  a  positive  pressure  is
observed at the wellhead. If the well goes on vacuum, the rate should be instantly raised until
a positive pressure is observed at the wellhead. Hold the new rate steady as the acid is inject-
ed. Nevertheless, the constant injection rate of HF acid into the wellbore should not exceed an
optimum ½ bbl/min unless the perforated interval is greater than 25 ft. If the formation is very
thick, the rate can be 0.02 bbl/min per foot of net pay. Other authors have different opinions
on allowable injection rates, as discussed later.

IV-308

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 7.18—Acid treatment with poor rate control.7

7.35 Pressure Behavior During Acid Injection
Two  pressure  responses  are  often  observed  during  acid  treatment.  Fig.  7.18  shows  one
response.7 In this well, when acid hit the formation, pressure dropped immediately. As the pres-
sure  dropped,  the  rate  was  increased;  then  the  pressure  began  to  rise.  The  rate  was  reduced,
and  then  the  well  was  shut  in  while  another  batch  of  acid  was  mixed  on  site.  Injection  was
restarted at a rate of 2 bbl/min, then cut back to 1.5 bbl/min and stabilized at 2 bbl/min for the
final injection of overflush. Rate should be held constant for a period of time at least until the
pressure stabilizes. Haphazard changes in rate make it impossible to determine on site what the
quantitative  response  of  the  well  is  to  the  acid  treatment,  unless  newer  computer  models  and
monitoring  equipment  are  available,  as  discussed  later.  A  better-controlled  acid  treatment  is
shown in Fig. 7.19.7 Here, the rate is stabilized at 0.55 bbl/min. When the HF acid stage en-
tered  the  formation,  the  pressure  slowly  declined  but  stayed  above  0  psi.  This  rate  was
continued  as  long  as  the  pressure  was  observed  and  is  the  type  of  response  that  one  should
observe when a well is treated to remove wellbore damage.

When the overflush reaches the formation, the rate may be increased as fast as allowed, as
long as the pressure stays below the fracturing pressure. The faster overflush rate will push the
spent  acid  deeper  into  the  formation  and  overdisplace  the  spent  acid  reaction  products  more
efficiently away from the wellbore. This safely finishes the treatment and allows the spent acid
to be produced back sooner. The well should be flowed immediately, unloaded with nitrogen,
swabbed back, or put on artificial lift.

7.36 On-Site Evaluation of Acid Treatment Effectiveness
The pressure and rate chart of the acid treatment show the effect of acid volume on the forma-
tion  as  the  acid  treatment  proceeds.  The  papers  of  McLeod  and  Coulter,75  Paccaloni  et  al.,76
and Prouvost and Economides77 are significant to the on-site evaluation of acidizing treatments.
On-site  data  monitoring  follows  and  evaluates  the  progress  of  damage  removal  by  acid.  Fig.
7.2076  shows  injection  rate  and  pressure  plotted  on  a  precalculated  chart  of  pressure  vs.  rate
and crossplotted with a family of skin-factor curves based on steady-state injection. The succes-
sive points clearly show the reduction in skin factor. These plots may be somewhat misleading

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-309

Fig. 7.19—Acid treatment with good rate control.7

because pressure transients are ignored after rate changes; however, no on-site computer is re-
quired.

Fig.  7.2177  shows  rates,  pressures  (both  measured  and  simulated),  and  skin-factor  change
during  acidizing,  as  presented  by  Prouvost  and  Economides.77  This  method  requires  an  onsite
computer but considers pressure transient effects when rate is changed. Such plots are a tremen-
dous  help  in  analyzing  on-site  acidizing  performance  and  in  follow-up  well  analysis.  More
information  is  also  available  in  the  excellent  text  on  stimulation  by  Economides  and  Nolte.78
McLeod and Coulter75 presented the first example of injection pressure buildup analysis before
and after acidizing cleanup in Figs. 7.22 and 7.23. Calculation to obtain formation permeabili-
ty before and after acidizing are shown with data in Tables 7.11 through 7.14.

Hill and Zhu79 advanced the monitoring of acidizing treatments, building on the earlier con-
tributions  of  McLeod  and  Coulter,75  Paccaloni  et  al.,76  and  Prouvost  and  Economides.77  The
use of the inverse injectivity diagnostic plot permits the real-time evaluation of treatments and
further  assists  in  post-treatment  evaluations.  Montgomery  et  al.80  proposed  more  active  treat-
ment monitoring into standard acidizing practice.

Refs. 81 and 82 provide good field examples of monitoring acid treatments with concurrent
skin evolution for both diverted and nondiverted treatments. Monitored on-site evaluation was
later  confirmed  with  well-flow  analysis  of  post-treatment  well  performance.  However,  more
work is needed on evaluating causes of treatment failures or skin increases.

7.37 Spent Acid Production Control
The well should be produced first at the same rate before acidizing. As soon as the well has
cleaned up and all spent acid has been recovered or reduced to zero water cut, the producing
rate  may  be  increased.  In  formations  with  moveable  fines,  the  rate  should  be  increased  once
each week to finally reach the optimum producing rate for that well. Increasing the rate gradu-
ally helps the return of any dispersed solids and prolongs the improvement for the acid treatment.
Ali  et  al.83  discussed  a  method  to  minimize  production  facility  upsets  offshore  by  special
handling of the returned acids at the surface. The cost of fluid handling is further reduced by

7.38 Produced Fluid Sampling
Spent acid samples should be collected at the surface to properly analyze the response of the
well  to  the  acid  treatment.  These  samples  should  be  analyzed  for  pH  immediately  and  then
kept  in  airtight  containers  for  chemical  analysis.  Chemical  analysis  of  these  samples  can  pro-
vide  information  for  use  in  evaluating  why  a  well  did  not  respond  to  acid  treatment.  If
precipitates  or  emulsions  are  a  problem,  the  return  samples  will  show  the  reason.  Whatever

solids  are  precipitating  to  cause  possible  damage  to  the  rock  around  the  wellbore  may  be
present  in  these  collected  samples.  Steps  can  be  taken  to  reduce  precipitation  by  changes  in
acid concentration, preflush fluids, and/or additives in the next scheduled treatment.

Analysis  of  well  flowback  may  indicate  problems  and  concerns  not  readily  evident  other-
wise. Such problems may arise from acid or spent acid mixing with lost completion brines and/
or  formation  water,  significant  dissolution  of  carbonates,  and  total  consumption  of  acid.  The
insight obtained helps to design optimum formulations for future treatments.63

A  comprehensive  HF  acidizing  radial  flow  model  was  modified  by  Gdanski  and
Schuchart33 to account for deep-matrix mixing and back production of sandstone-acidizing treat-
ing fluids. Deep matrix mixing may require back production of at least two treatment volumes
of aqueous fluid to recover the spent injected acids. Matching the ionic return profiles can pro-
vide information about formation mineralogy and excess precipitation.

To  summarize,  on-site  supervision  of  acid  treatments  is  critical  to  successful  acidizing.
Long  treatments  can  best  be  controlled  by  two  persons—one  to  coordinate  the  acid  schedule
and  rate  and  pressure  control,  and  the  other  to  check  materials;  titrate  acid;  and  monitor  vol-
umes,  rates,  and  pressures.  The  engineer  who  recommended  and  designed  the  job  and  the
supervisor  who  prepared  the  well  for  acidizing  make  a  good  combination.  Good  data  and
record keeping greatly help the job of evaluating acidizing results.

7.39 Evaluation of Acid Treatments
The  evaluation  process  encompasses  six  major  areas  on  which  to  focus  when  assessing  job
performance and acid treatment success:

• Injection rate and pressure.
• Final fall-off pressure record.
• Well production analysis (nodal analysis).
• Produced fluid samples.
• Post-treatment investigation concerning damage incurred during injection, acid removal of

damage, post-treatment damage (precipitates), and verbal communications.

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-313

Fig. 7.23—Injection pressure buildup with damage removed.34

• Recommendations for continuous improvement.
The most important measure of the treatment is the productivity of the well after treatment.
When  the  productivity  stabilizes  at  the  same  production  rate  as  before  treatment,  the  flowing
bottomhole pressure should be estimated from fluid levels or from measured flowing pressures.
Static bottomhole pressure should be measured following any long shut-in periods. A well flow
analysis should show whether the designed productivity was obtained. The pressure charts from
the  treatment,  including  both  accurate  injection  rates  and  recorded  injection  pressures,  can  be
analyzed  using  transient  pressure  analysis  to  determine  when  or  if  the  wellbore  damage  was
removed by the treatment. An injectivity index can be calculated for the well both before and
after  the  HF-acid  stage.  The  final  overflush  injection  pressures  and  rates  should  give  a  fairly
accurate  measure  of  the  well  productivity  before  the  well  is  ever  returned  to  production.  A
useful source of information is the final pressure falloff after the treatment. If the pressure ex-

IV-314

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

ists  at  the  wellhead,  the  falloff  pressures  should  be  recorded  on  site  until  the  well  goes  on
vacuum. If the well goes on vacuum too soon, fluid levels can be shot with a sonolog device
until the level falls to near the static bottomhole pressure. These final falloff pressures can be
used to estimate the wellbore condition after the acid treatment. If this analysis shows that the
acid treatment removed all wellbore damage, the treatment is potentially successful if later well
production  analysis  shows  that  no  post-acid  precipitation  occurred.  An  example  of  this  type
analysis is shown in the example provided by McLeod.34

If  the  well  injectivity  or  productivity  (after  the  well  returns  to  injection  or  production)  is
not close to that predicted by the falloff analysis, some damage probably occurred to the forma-
tion after the acid treatment ended. Subsequent damage after the treatment may be caused by

Chapter 7—Matrix Acidizing

IV-315

precipitation  of  acid  reaction  products  in  the  formation  or  by  return  of  fines  to  the  wellbore
with internal pore plugging at or near perforations. This is especially true in gravel-packed wells.
First, it is important to know that the treatment removed the damage in the wellbore during
treatment  as  intended.  If  damage  occurred  after  the  treatment,  steps  can  be  taken  to  prevent
that damage in a later treatment of that well or others in the reservoir by such steps as utilizing
different additives to keep reaction products in solution, overflushing the reaction products deep-
er  into  the  formation,  using  different  acids  or  acid  concentrations  to  prevent  the  excess
precipitation  of  acid  reaction  products,  or  using  stabilizers  to  prevent  fines  from  returning  to
the wellbore and reducing productivity.

If the anticipated productivity was achieved, the acid treatment worked as designed. If not,
the  entire  treatment  should  be  reviewed  to  analyze  the  causes.  Often,  unsatisfactory  perfor-
mance  results  from  imperfect  coverage  during  the  treatment.  A  change  in  the  acid  placement
technique  may  be  necessary  for  the  next  acid  treatment  in  the  field.  If  solid  diverting  agents
were employed, changes in concentrations may be necessary, or perhaps another diversion tech-
nique would work better. Feasibility and economic analysis from the expected well production
increase determine whether these changes are worthwhile.

The  engineer  evaluating  the  treatment  should  individually  discuss  the  treatment  with  the
service  company  supervising  engineer  and  the  operating  company  supervisor.  Their  observa-
tions lead to future treatment improvements.

The acid treatment report and the pressure/rate treatment charts are the best sources of infor-
mation.  The  engineer  can  observe  and  follow  the  injectivity  during  the  entire  process  to  see
whether  the  injectivity  decreased  during  the  treatment.  Plugging  or  reduced  injectivity  during
the first injection into the wellbore can be traced to solids suspended in injected fluids at the
beginning of the treatment. The condition of the well, well preparation, and QC sampling can
reveal the source of these plugging solids.

Usually, the damage during an acid treatment occurs at the time the first acid hits the for-
mation. This first acid damage is usually caused by solids removed from the tubing walls prior
to the acid reaching the formation. Also, acid may react adversely with some of the minerals in
the formation, and perhaps a different acid or solvent (such as acetic acid or an aromatic sol-
vent)  should  be  used  to  first  contact  the  formation.  Many  acid  failures  are  caused  by  the
elimination of needed wellbore preparations prior to the acid treatment.

7.40 Continuous Improvement
Nitters  et  al.5  present  a  systematic  approach  for  candidate  selection,  damage  evaluation,  and
treatment  selection  and  design  using  a  recently  developed  integrated  software  package.  They
recognize the importance of evaluating skin factors from well tests to determine what could be

IV-316

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

improved. After identifying damage mechanisms, they used an expert system and geochemical
simulator  to  select  appropriate  treatment  fluids.  They  also  developed  software  for  the  evalua-
tion and design of acid placement.

Hashem  et al.86  produced  an  excellent example of  a  complete strategy  for  acidizing. Well
analysis and sampling identified the damage mechanisms that were removed by the appropriate
acid systems and additives that were selected using formation mineralogy, extensive laboratory
testing with core flood studies, and acid and additive testing. Well preparation, job supervision,
and on-site monitoring played key roles in the success of the acid treatments. Treatment evalu-
ations were performed to identify problems with some acid treatments, which led to improved
additive  formulations  and  improved  spent-acid  cleanup  procedures.  These  steps  resulted  in  an
86% success rate in treatment of water-injection wells and significantly improved water injec-
tivity.

To summarize, successful acidizing is assured by proper treatment design, well preparation,
and execution, which includes significant practices: acid cleaning of tubing; acid type and con-
centration designed for the mineralogy and the permeability of the formation; acids, additives,
and solvent flush designed for proper acid/reservoir fluid compatibility; properly prepared well-
bore  and  effective  acid  coverage;  sufficient  time  provided  for  acid  contact  and  penetration  of
all perforations; and precipitation prevented or flushed away from the wellbore.

Treatment  evaluation  leads  to  problem  identification  and  to  continuously  improved  treat-
ments. The prime source of information on which to build an evaluation are the acid treatment
report and the pressure and rate data during injection and falloff.

The  tasks  of  execution and  evaluation go  hand  in  hand.  Proper  execution, quality  control,
and record keeping are prerequisites to the task of accurate evaluation. Evaluation of unsatisfac-
tory  treatments  is  essential  to  recommending  changes  in  chemicals  and/or  treating  techniques
and procedures that will provide the best treatment for acidizing wells in the future. This im-
plies a program for continuous improvement.

Summary
One may feel overwhelmed by the details in executing successful acid treatments. This is true
of any complex oilfield operation such as cementing, perforating, gravel packing, or hydraulic
fracturing. Acidizing has often been treated with a cavalier attitude because the treatments can
be  relatively  inexpensive  in  some  areas.  Past  acid  treatments  have  been  successful  without
much care. That was true because completions were so bad in the early days of acidizing that
some  production  improvement  was  fairly  easy.  Today,  completions  are  much  better  planned
and executed, and there is less tolerance for poor stimulation processes. Experience with acid
in  a  field  is  a  starting  point.  If  a  particular formation or  reservoir  has  a  history  of  successful
acidizing with a particular system and products, many of the recommendations herein may not
be necessary. Modern completion analysis programs can evaluate the success of past jobs and
can  establish  whether  improvements  are  needed.  If  acidizing  has  been  unsuccessful  in  certain
areas,  the  systematic  process  presented  in  this  chapter  may  provide  solutions  to  that  lack  of
success.

Hydraulic Fracturing
Stephen A. Holditch, Texas A&M U.

8.1 Introduction
The  first  hydraulic  fracturing  treatment  was  pumped  in  1947  on  a  gas  well  operated  by  Pan
American Petroleum Corp. in the Hugoton field.1 Kelpper Well No. 1, located in Grant Coun-
ty,  Kansas,  was  a  low-productivity  well,  even  though  it  had  been  acidized.  The  well  was
chosen  for  the  first  hydraulic  fracture  stimulation  treatment  so  that  hydraulic  fracturing  could
be compared directly with acidizing. Since that first treatment in 1947, hydraulic fracturing has
become a common treatment for stimulating the productivity of oil and gas wells.

Hydraulic fracturing is the process of pumping a fluid into a wellbore at an injection rate
that is too great for the formation to accept in a radial flow pattern. As the resistance to flow
in  the  formation  increases,  the  pressure  in  the  wellbore  increases  to  a  value  that  exceeds  the
breakdown pressure of the formation open to the wellbore. Once the formation “breaks down,”
a  fracture  is  formed,  and  the  injected  fluid  begins  moving  down  the  fracture.  In  most  forma-
tions, a single, vertical fracture is created that propagates in two directions from the wellbore.
These fracture “wings” are 180° apart and normally are assumed to be identical in shape and
size  at  any  point  in  time;  however,  in  actual  cases,  the  fracture  wing  dimensions  may  not  be
identical. In naturally fractured or cleated formations, it is possible that multiple fractures can
be created and propagated during a hydraulic fracture treatment.

Fluid  that  does  not  contain  any  propping  agent  (called  the  “pad”)  is  injected  to  create  a
fracture that grows up, out, and down, and creates a fracture that is wide enough to accept a
propping agent. The purpose of the propping agent is to prop open the fracture once the pump-
ing  operation  ceases,  the  pressure  in  the  fracture  decreases,  and  the  fracture  closes.  In  deep
reservoirs,  man-made  ceramic  beads  are  used  to  hold  open  or  “prop”  the  fracture.  In  shallow
reservoirs, sand is normally used as the propping agent.

This chapter discusses the processes used to design and pump a hydraulic fracture treatment
and  provides  an  overview  of  the  theories,  design  methods,  and  materials  used  in  a  hydraulic
fracture treatment.

8.1.1 Objectives of Hydraulic Fracturing.  In  general,  hydraulic  fracture  treatments  are  used
to  increase  the  productivity  index  of  a  producing  well  or  the  injectivity  index  of  an  injection
well.  The  productivity  index  defines  the  rate  at  which  oil  or  gas  can  be  produced  at  a  given

IV-324

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

pressure differential between the reservoir and the wellbore. The injectivity index refers to the
rate at which fluid can be injected into a well at a given pressure differential.

There are many applications for hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing can increase the
flow rate of oil and/or gas from low-permeability reservoirs, increase the flow rate of oil and/
or  gas  from  wells  that  have  been  damaged,  connect  the  natural  fractures  and/or  cleats  in  a
formation to the wellbore, decrease the pressure drop around the well to minimize sand produc-
tion,  enhance  gravel-packing  sand  placement,  decrease  the  pressure  drop  around  the  well  to
minimize problems with asphaltine and/or paraffin deposition, increase the area of drainage or
the amount of formation in contact with the wellbore, and connect the full vertical extent of a
reservoir to a slanted or horizontal well. There could be other uses, but most of the treatments
are pumped for these reasons.

A low-permeability reservoir is one that has a high resistance to fluid flow. In many forma-
tions,  chemical  and/or  physical  processes  alter  the  reservoir  rock  over  geologic  time.  Some-
times,  these  diagenetic  processes  restrict  the  openings  in  the  rock  and  reduce  the  ability  of
fluids to flow through the rock. Low-permeability rocks are normally excellent candidates for
stimulation by hydraulic fracturing.

Regardless  of  the  permeability,  a  reservoir  rock  can  be  damaged  when  a  well  is  drilled
through  the  reservoir  and  when  casing  is  set  and  cemented  in  place.  Damage  occurs  because
drilling  and/or  completion  fluids  leak  into  the  reservoir  and  alter  the  pores  and  pore  throats.
When  the  pores  are  plugged,  the  permeability  is  reduced,  and  the  fluid  flow  in  this  damaged
portion of the reservoir may be substantially reduced. Damage can be especially severe in natu-
rally  fractured  reservoirs.  To  stimulate  damaged  reservoirs,  a  short,  conductive  hydraulic
fracture is often the desired solution.

In many cases, especially for low-permeability formations, damaged reservoirs, or horizon-
tal wells in a layered reservoir, the well would be uneconomical unless a successful hydraulic
fracture treatment is designed and pumped. The engineer in charge of the economic success of
such  a  well  must  design  the  optimal  fracture  treatment  and  then  go  to  the  field  to  be  certain
the optimal treatment is pumped successfully.

8.1.2 Candidate Selection.  The success or failure of a hydraulic fracture treatment often de-
pends  on  the  quality  of  the  candidate  well  selected  for  the  treatment.  Choosing  an  excellent
candidate for stimulation often ensures success, while choosing a poor candidate normally re-
sults in economic failure. To select the best candidate for stimulation, the design engineer must
consider  many  variables.  The  most  critical  parameters  for  hydraulic  fracturing  are  formation
permeability, the in-situ stress distribution, reservoir fluid viscosity, skin factor, reservoir pres-
sure, reservoir depth, and the condition of the wellbore. The skin factor refers to whether the
reservoir  is  already  stimulated  or  is  damaged.  If  the  skin  factor  is  positive,  the  reservoir  is
damaged, and the well could be an excellent candidate for stimulation.

The  best  candidate  wells  for  hydraulic  fracturing  treatments  have  a  substantial  volume  of
oil and gas in place and need to increase the productivity index. Such reservoirs have a thick
pay  zone,  medium  to  high  pressure,  in-situ  stress  barriers  to  minimize  vertical  height  growth,
and either a low-permeability zone or a zone that has been damaged (high skin factor).

Reservoirs that are poor candidates for hydraulic fracturing are those with little oil or gas
in  place  because  of  thin  reservoirs,  low  reservoir  pressure,  or  small  areal  extent.  Reservoirs
with extremely low permeability may not produce enough hydrocarbons to pay all the drilling
and completion costs, even if successfully stimulated; thus, such reservoirs would not be good
candidates for stimulation.

8.1.3 Developing Data Sets.  For most petroleum engineers, developing a complete and accu-
rate  data  set  is  often  the  most  time-consuming  part  of  fracture  treatment  design.  The  data
required to run both the fracture design model and the reservoir simulation model can be divid-

Chapter 8—Hydraulic Fracturing

IV-325

ed  into  two  groups:  data  that  can  be  “controlled”  by  the  engineer  and  data  that  must  be
measured or estimated, but cannot be controlled.

The  primary  data  that  can  be  controlled  by  the  engineer  are  the  well  completion  details,
treatment volume, pad volume, injection rate, fracture fluid viscosity, fracture fluid density, fluid-
loss  additives,  propping  agent  type,  and  propping  agent  volume.  The  data  that  must  be
measured or estimated are formation depth, formation permeability, in-situ stresses in the pay
zone,  in-situ  stresses  in  the  surrounding  layers,  formation  modulus,  reservoir  pressure,  forma-
tion  porosity,  formation  compressibility,  and  reservoir  thickness.  There  are  three  thicknesses
that are important to the design engineer: the gross thickness of the reservoir, the net thickness
of  the  oil-  or  gas-producing  interval,  and  the  permeable  thickness  that  will  accept  fluid  loss
during the hydraulic fracture treatment.

The  most  critical  data  for  the  design  of  a  fracture  treatment  (roughly  in  order  of  impor-
tance) are the in-situ stress profile, formation permeability, fluid-loss characteristics, total fluid
volume pumped, propping agent type and amount, pad volume, fracture fluid viscosity, injec-
tion rate, and formation modulus. In hydraulic fracture treatment design, the two most impor-
tant  parameters  are  the  in-situ  stress  profile  and  the  permeability  profile  of  the  zone  to  be
stimulated,  plus  the  layers  of  rock  above  and  below  the  target  zone  that  will  affect  fracture
height growth.

In new fields or reservoirs, most operating companies are normally willing to run logs, cut
cores, and run well tests to determine important factors such as the in-situ stress and the perme-
ability  of  the  reservoir  layers.  With  such  data,  along  with  fracture-treatment  and  production
records, accurate data sets for a given reservoir normally can be compiled. These data sets can
be used on subsequent wells to optimize the fracture treatment designs. It is normally not prac-
tical to cut cores and run well tests on every well. Thus, the data obtained from cores and well
tests  from  a  few  wells  must  be  correlated to  log  parameters, so  the  logs  on  subsequent  wells
can be used to compile accurate data sets.

To design a fracture treatment, most use pseudo-three-dimensional (P3D) models. To use a
P3D model, the data must be entered by reservoir layer. Fig. 8.1 illustrates the important data
profiles required by a P3D model. For the example in Fig. 8.1, the fracture treatment would be
started in the sandstone reservoir. The fracture would typically grow up and down until a barri-
er is reached to prevent vertical fracture growth. In many cases, thick marine shale is a barrier
to vertical fracture growth. In some cases, coal seams prevent fractures from growing vertical-
ly. Many coal seams are highly cleated, which means that they contain an abundance of small
natural fractures. When the fracture fluid enters a highly cleated coal seam, there will be very
high fluid leakoff into the coal cleats. In thick, highly cleated coal seams, the fracture is likely
to be contained within the coal seam.

The data used to design a fracture treatment can be obtained from several sources, such as
drilling records, completion records, well files, openhole geophysical logs, cores and core anal-
yses,  well  tests,  production  data,  geologic  records,  and  other  public  records,  such  as  publica-
tions.  In  addition,  service  companies  provide  data  on  their  fluids,  additives,  and  propping
agents.  Table  8.1  illustrates  typical  data  needed  to  design  a  fracture  treatment  and  possible
sources for the data.

8.1.4 Fracture Treatment Optimization.  The goal of every fracture treatment design should
be to attain the optimum fracture treatment for each and every well. In 1978, Holditch et al.2
discussed the optimization of both the propped fracture length and the drainage area (well spac-
ing)  for  low-permeability  gas  reservoirs.  Fig.  8.2  illustrates  the  method  used  to  optimize  the
size of a fracture treatment3,4 and clearly shows the following:

• As  the  propped  length  of  a  fracture  increases,  the  cumulative  production  will  increase,

and the revenue from hydrocarbon sales will increase.

IV-326

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 8.1—Typical input data for a P3D model.

• As the fracture length increases, the incremental benefit (amount of revenue generated per

foot of additional propped fracture length) decreases.

• As the treatment volume increases, the propped fracture length increases.
• As  the  fracture  length  increases,  the  incremental  cost  of  each  foot  of  fracture  (cost/ft  of

additional propped fracture length) increases.

• When  the  incremental  cost  of  the  treatment  is  compared  with  the  incremental  benefit  of
increasing  the  treatment  volume,  an  optimum  propped  fracture  length  can  be  found  for  every
situation.

Additional economic calculations can be made to determine the optimum fracture treatment
design. However, in all cases, the design must consider the effect of the fracture on flow rates
and  recovery,  the  cost  of  the  treatment,  and  the  investment  guidelines  of  the  company  that
owns and operates the well.

8.1.5 Field Considerations.  After the optimum fracture treatment has been designed, it must
be pumped into the well successfully. A successful field operation requires planning, coordina-
tion,  and  cooperation  of  all  parties.  Treatment  supervision  and  the  use  of  quality  control
measures  will  improve the  successful  application of  hydraulic fracturing. Safety  is  always  the
primary concern in the field, and it begins with a thorough understanding by all parties of their
duties. A safety meeting is always held to review the treatment procedure, establish a chain of
command, ensure everyone knows his/her job responsibilities for the day, and establish a plan
for emergencies.

The safety meeting also should be used to discuss the well completion details and the max-
imum allowable injection rate and pressures, as well as the maximum pressures to be held as
backup  in  the  annulus.  All  casing,  tubing,  wellheads,  valves,  and  weak  links,  such  as  liner

Chapter 8—Hydraulic Fracturing

IV-327

tops,  should  be  tested  thoroughly  before  starting  the  fracturing  treatment.  Mechanical  failures
during a treatment can be costly and dangerous. All mechanical problems should be discovered
during testing and repaired before pumping the fracture treatment.

Before  pumping  the  treatment, the  engineer in  charge  should  conduct a  detailed inventory
of  all  the  equipment  and  materials  on  location.  The  inventory  should  be  compared  with  the
design and the prognosis. After the treatment has concluded, another inventory of all the mate-
rials left on location should be conducted. In most cases, the difference in the two inventories
can be used to verify what was mixed and pumped into the wellbore and the hydrocarbon-bear-
ing formation.

In addition to an inventory, samples of the base fracturing fluid (usually water) should be
taken and analyzed. Typically, a water analysis is done on the base fluid to determine the min-
erals and type of bacteria present. The data from the water analysis can be used to select the
additives  needed  to  mix  the  viscous  fracture  fluid  required  to  create  a  wide  fracture  and  to
transport the propping agent into the fracture. In addition, samples of the additives used during
a treatment and the fracture fluid after all additives have been added should be taken and saved
in case future analyses are required.

8.2 Fracture Mechanics
Fracture mechanics has been part of mining engineering and mechanical engineering for hun-
dreds of years. In petroleum engineering, fracture mechanics theories have been used for only
approximately  50  years.  Much  of  what  is  used  in  hydraulic  fracturing  theory  and  design  was
developed by other engineering disciplines many years ago. However, certain aspects, such as
poroelastic  theory,  are  unique  to  porous,  permeable  underground  formations.  Three  important
parameters of fracture mechanics are in-situ stress, Poisson’s ration, and Young’s modulus.

8.2.1 In-Situ Stresses.  Underground formations are confined and under stress. Fig. 8.3 illus-
trates  the  local  stress  state  at  depth  for  an  element  of  formation.  The  stresses  can  be  divided

IV-328

into three principal stresses. In Fig. 8.3, σ1 is the vertical stress, σ2 is the minimum horizontal
stress,  and  σ3  is  the  maximum  horizontal  stress.  These  stresses  are  normally  compressive,
anisotropic, and nonhomogeneous,5 which means that the compressive stresses on the rock are
not equal and vary in magnitude on the basis of direction. The magnitude and direction of the
principal stresses are important because they control the pressure required to create and propa-
gate a fracture, the shape and vertical extent of the fracture, the direction of the fracture, and
the stresses trying to crush and/or embed the propping agent during production.

Chapter 8—Hydraulic Fracturing

IV-329

A  hydraulic  fracture  will  propagate  perpendicular  to  the  minimum  principal  stress.6  For  a

vertical fracture, the minimum horizontal stress can be estimated with

σmin =~

ν

1 – ν

(σ1 – αpp) + αpp + σext, ........................................... (8.1)

where

σmin = the minimum horizontal stress,
ν = Poisson’s ratio,
σ1 = overburden stress,
α = Biot’s constant,
pp = reservoir fluid pressure or pore pressure, and
σext = tectonic stress.
Poisson’s ratio can be estimated from acoustic log data or from correlations based on lithol-
ogy.  Table  8.2  presents  typical  ranges  for  Poisson’s  ratio.  The  overburden  stress  can  be
computed with density log data. Normally, the value for overburden stress is approximately 1
psi/ft of depth. The reservoir pressure must be measured or estimated. Biot’s constant is usual-
ly 1.0, but can be less than 1.0 on occasion.

Poroelastic theory is often used to estimate the minimum horizontal stress.7–9 Eq. 8.1 com-
bines poroelastic theory with a term that accounts for any tectonic forces that are acting on a
formation. The first term on the right side of Eq. 8.1 is a linear elastic term that converts the
effective vertical stress on the rock grains into an effective horizontal stress on the rock grains.
The  second  term  in  Eq.  8.1  represents  the  stress  generated  by  the  fluid  pressure  in  the  pore
space. The third term is the tectonic stress, which could be zero in tectonically relaxed areas,
but can be important in tectonically active areas.

In tectonically active areas, the effects of tectonic activity must be included in the analyses
of the total stresses. To measure the tectonic stresses, injection tests are conducted to measure
the minimum horizontal stress. The measured stress is then compared with the stress calculated
by the poroelastic equation to determine the value of the tectonic stress.

8.2.2 Basic Rock Mechanics.  In  addition  to  the  in-situ  or  minimum  horizontal  stress,  other
rock  mechanical  properties  are  important  when  designing  a  hydraulic  fracture.  Poisson’s  ratio
is defined as “the ratio of lateral expansion to longitudinal contraction for a rock under a uniax-
ial  stress  condition.”5  The  value  of  Poisson’s  ratio  is  used  in  Eq.  8.1  to  convert  the  effective
vertical stress component into an effective horizontal stress component. The effective stress is
defined as the total stress minus the pore pressure.

IV-330

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

The theory used to compute fracture dimensions is based on linear elasticity. When apply-
ing  this  theory,  the  modulus  of  the  formation  is  an  important  parameter.  Young’s  modulus  is
defined  as  “the  ratio  of  stress  to  strain  for  uniaxial  stress.”5  The  modulus  of  a  material  is  a
measure  of  the  stiffness  of  the  material.  If  the  modulus  is  large,  the  material  is  stiff.  In  hy-
draulic  fracturing,  a  stiff  rock  results  in  more  narrow  fractures.  If  the  modulus  is  low,  the
fractures are wider. The modulus of a rock is a function of the lithology, porosity, fluid type,
and other variables. Table 8.2 illustrates typical ranges for modulus as a function of lithology.

8.2.3 Fracture Orientation.  A hydraulic fracture will propagate perpendicular to the least prin-
ciple stress (see Fig. 8.3). In some shallow formations, the least principal stress is the overbur-
den  stress;  thus,  the  hydraulic  fracture  will  be  horizontal.  Horizontal  fractures  have  been
documented.10  In  reservoirs  deeper  than  approximately  1,000  ft,  the  least  principal  stress  will
likely be horizontal; thus, the hydraulic fracture will be vertical. The azimuth orientation of the
vertical fracture will depend on the azimuth of the minimum and maximum horizontal stresses.
Lacy and Smith provided a detailed discussion of fracture azimuth in Ref. 11.

Injection Tests.  The only reliable technique for measuring in-situ stress is by pumping flu-
id into a reservoir, creating a fracture, and measuring the pressure at which the fracture closes.5
The well tests used to measure the minimum principal stress are in-situ stress tests, step-rate/
flowback tests, minifracture tests, and step-down tests. For most fracture treatments, minifrac-
ture  tests  and  step-down  tests  are  pumped  ahead  of  the  main  fracture  treatment.  As  such,
accurate data are normally available to calibrate and interpret the pressures measured during a
fracture  treatment.  In-situ  stress  tests  and  step-rate/flowback  tests  are  not  run  on  every  well;
however,  it  is  common  to  run  such  tests  in  new  fields  or  new  reservoirs  to  help  develop  the
correlations required to optimize fracture treatments for subsequent wells.

In-Situ Stress Tests.  An in-situ stress test can be either an injection-falloff test or an injection-
flowback test. The in-situ stress test is conducted with small volumes of fluid (a few barrels)
and injected at a low injection rate (tens of gal/min), normally with straddle packers to mini-
mize wellbore storage effects, into a small number of perforations (1 to 2 ft). The objective is
to pump a thin fluid (water or nitrogen) at a rate just sufficient to create a small fracture. Once
the  fracture  is  open,  the  pumps  are  shut  down,  and  the  pressure  is  recorded  and  analyzed  to
determine  when  the  fracture  closes.  Thus,  the  term  “fracture-closure  pressure”  is  synonymous
with minimum in-situ stress and minimum horizontal stress. When the pressure in the fracture
is greater than the fracture-closure pressure, the fracture is open. When the pressure in the frac-
ture is less than the fracture-closure pressure, the fracture is closed. Fig. 8.4 illustrates a typical
wellbore configuration for conducting an in-situ stress test. Fig. 8.5 shows typical data that are
measured.  Multiple  tests  are  conducted  to  ensure  repeatability.  The  data  from  any  one  of  the
injection-falloff tests can be analyzed to determine when the fracture closes. Fig. 8.6 illustrates
how one such test can be analyzed to determine in-situ stress.

Minifracture Tests.  Minifracture tests are run to reconfirm the value of in-situ stress in the
pay  zone  and  to  estimate  the  fluid-loss  properties  of  the  fracture  fluid.  A  minifracture  test  is
run  with  fluid  similar  to  the  fracture  fluid  that  will  be  used  in  the  main  treatment.  Several
hundred barrels of fracturing fluid are pumped at fracturing rates. The purpose of the injection
is to create a fracture that will be of similar height to the one created during the main fracture
treatment. After the minifracture has been created, the pumps are shut down, and the pressure
decline is monitored. The pressure decline can be used to estimate the fracture-closure pressure
and  the  total  fluid  leakoff  coefficient.  Data  from  minifracture  treatments  can  be  used  to  alter
the design of the main fracture treatment, if required.

Step-Down Tests.  For any injection-falloff test to be conducted successfully, a clean connec-
tion between the wellbore and the created fracture is needed. The main objective of an in-situ
stress test and the minifracture test is to determine the pressure in the fracture when the frac-

ture is open and the pressure when the fracture is closed. If there is excess pressure drop near
the wellbore because of poor connectivity between the wellbore and the fracture, the interpreta-
tion  of  in-situ  stress  test  data  can  be  difficult.  In  naturally  fractured  or  highly  cleated  forma-
tions,  multiple  fractures  that  follow  tortuous  paths  are  often  created  during  injection  tests.
When these tortuous paths are created, the pressure drop in the “near-wellbore” region can be
very high, which complicates the analyses of the pressure falloff data. To determine the cause
of near-wellbore pressure drop, step-down tests are run.12

A  step-down  test  is  pumped  just  before  the  minifracture  treatment.  A  step-down  test  is
pumped  at  fracturing  rates  with  linear  fluids,  the  friction  pressures  of  which  are  well  known.
The pressure at the bottom of the hole during the injection is a function of the net pressure in
the fracture and the near-wellbore pressure drop. To measure the near-wellbore pressure drop,
the net pressure in the fracture needs to be relatively constant during the step-down portion of
the test. To do this, the step-down test is started by injecting into the well for 10 to 15 min-
utes.  Experience  has  shown  that,  in  most  cases,  the  net  pressure  is  relatively  stable  after
approximately 10 to 15 minutes of injection. The injection rate is then “reduced in steps” to a
rate of zero. The injection rate at each step should be held constant for approximately 1 minute
so the stabilized injection pressure can be measured. The injection rate should be stepped from
the maximum value to zero, in three to five steps, in less than 5 minutes. The objective of the
step-down test is to measure the near-wellbore pressure drop as a function of injection rate. If
the  net  pressure  in  the  fracture  is  relatively  stable,  then  the  change  in  bottomhole  injection
pressure as the injection rate is reduced will be a function of the near-wellbore pressure drop.

The  key  to  analyzing  a  step-down  test  is  that  the  two  main  causes  of  near-wellbore  pres-
sure drop can be distinguished easily as the data are analyzed. When the pressure drop near the
wellbore is caused by perforation friction, the near-wellbore pressure drop will be a function of
the injection rate squared, as Eq. 8.2 shows.

. ........................................................ (8.2)

If  the  near-wellbore  pressure  drop  is  caused  by  tortuosity,  then  the  near-wellbore  pressure
drop will be a function of the injection rate raised to a power of one-half (0.5), as Eq. 8.3 shows.

Δpτ = a × Q0.5 . ............................................................ (8.3)

A graph of the value of near-wellbore pressure drop vs. injection rate will provide a clear
indication of what is causing the near-wellbore pressure drop. Fig. 8.7 illustrates that the graph
of pressure drop vs. injection rate will be concave upward when the pressure drop is dominated
by tortuosity and will be concave downward when the pressure drop is dominated by perfora-
tion friction.

8.2.4 Net Pressure.  The  reason  for  computing  values  of  in-situ  stress  and  conducting  stress
tests, minifracture tests, and step-down tests is to compute the net pressure in the fracture. The
net pressure is the difference between the actual pressure in the fracture and the minimum in-
situ stress, σmin.

pn = p f – σmin . ............................................................ (8.4)

The  net  pressure  is  generated  by  both  tip  effects  and  the  pressure  drop  down  the  fracture
caused by viscous fluid flow. Fig. 8.8 illustrates the net pressure profile down a typical frac-
ture.  In  many  formations,  the  pressure  drop  down  the  fracture  is  dominated  by  the  pressure

increases  near  the  tip  of  the  fracture  as  propagation  occurs.  The  net  pressure  profile  controls
both the fracture height and fracture width distribution along the fracture length.

The value of net pressure is important because the engineer needs to know for which value
to  design  the  main  fracture  treatment,  to  perform  onsite  analyses  of  the  fracturing  pressures,
and  to  perform  postfracture  analyses  of  the  fracturing  pressures.  One  of  the  best  methods  to
analyze a fracture treatment is to use a fracture propagation model to analyze the net pressures
measured during a fracture treatment.

8.3 Fracture Propagation Models
The first fracture treatments were pumped just to see if a fracture could be created and if sand
could be pumped into the fracture. In 1955, Howard and Fast13 published the first mathematical
model that an engineer could use to design a fracture treatment. The Howard and Fast model
assumed the fracture width was constant everywhere, allowing the engineer to compute fracture
area on the basis of fracture fluid leakoff characteristics of the formation and the fracturing fluid.

8.3.1 Two-Dimensional Fracture Propagation Models.  The  Howard  and  Fast  model  was  a
2D model. In the following years, other 2D models were published.14–17 With a 2D model, the
engineer  fixes  one  of  the  dimensions,  normally  the  fracture  height,  then  calculates  the  width
and length of the fracture. With experience and accurate data sets, 2D models can be used in
certain formations with confidence, assuming the design engineer can estimate the created frac-
ture height accurately.

Figs. 8.9 and 8.10 illustrate two of the most common 2D models used in fracture treatment
design.18  The  Perkins-Kern-Nordgren  (PKN)  geometry  (Fig.  8.9)  is  normally  used  when  the
fracture  length  is  much  greater  than  the  fracture  height,  while  the  Kristonovich-Geertsma-
Daneshy  (KGD)  geometry  (Fig.  8.10)  is  used  if  fracture  height  is  more  than  the  fracture
length.19  In  certain  formations,  either  of  these  two  models  can  be  used  successfully  to  design
hydraulic fractures. The key is to use models (any model) to make decisions, rather than trying

IV-334

Fig. 8.7—Effects of perforations and tortuosity on the near-wellbore pressure drop.

to  calculate  precise  values  for  fracture  dimensions.  The  design  must  always  compare  actual
results with the predictions from model calculations. By “calibrating” the 2D model with field
results, the 2D models can be used to make design changes and improve the success of stimu-
lation  treatments.  If  the  correct  fracture  height  value  is  used  in  a  2D  model,  the  model  will
give reasonable estimates of created fracture length and width if other parameters, such as in-
situ  stress,  Young’s  modulus,  formation  permeability,  and  total  leakoff  coefficient,  are  also
reasonably known and used.

To illustrate how certain variables affect fracture propagation, Eqs. 8.5 through 8.7 conform

to the PKN fracture geometry assumptions. For fluid flow down an elliptical tube,

Eq. 8.5 is the relationship used to compute the pressure distribution down the fracture for
any  given  combination  of  injection  rate,  fracture  fluid  viscosity,  fracture  height,  and  fracture
width. This equation, given certain physical dimensions and constraints, provides the pressure
distribution in the fracture.

Eq. 8.6 provides the relationship between a given pressure distribution and what the dimen-
sions  of  the  fracture  will  be  on  the  basis  of  rock  mechanics  theory.  This  equation,  given  a
certain  pressure  distribution,  provides  the  fracture  width  distribution.  Eq.  8.5  and  Eq.  8.6  are
solved simultaneously to generate Eq. 8.7. By reviewing Eq. 8.7, one can observe that the frac-
ture width will increase when the injection rate increases, the fracture fluid viscosity increases,
the fracture length increases, or the formation modulus decreases. Similar equations have been
derived by a number of authors. A complete discussion concerning the equations that describe
the various 2D fracture models can be found in Refs. 18 and 19.

Three-Dimensional Fracture Propagation Models.  2D models have been used for decades
with  reasonable  success.  Today,  with  high-powered  computers  available  to  most  engineers,
P3D models are used by most fracture design engineers. P3D models are better than 2D mod-
els for most situations because the P3D model computes the fracture height, width, and length
distribution with the data for the pay zone and all the rock layers above and below the perforat-
ed interval.

Clifton20 provides a detailed explanation of how 3D fracture propagation theory is used to
derive equations for programming 3D models, including P3D models. Figs. 8.11 and 8.12 illus-
trate  typical  results  from  a  P3D  model.  P3D  models  give  more  realistic  estimates  of  fracture

geometry and  dimensions,  which  can  lead to  better designs  and  better wells.  P3D  models  are
used to compute the shape of the hydraulic fracture as well as the dimensions. The key to any
model, including 3D or P3D models, is to have a complete and accurate data set that describes
the layers of the formation to be fracture treated, plus the layers of rock above and below the
zone  of  interest.  In  most  cases,  the  data  set  should  contain  information  on  5  to  25  layers  of
rock  that  will  or  possibly  could  affect  fracture  growth.  It  is  best  to  enter  data  on  as  many
layers  as  feasible  and  let  the  model  determine  the  fracture  height  growth  as  a  function  of
where the fracture is started in the model. If the user only enters data on three to five layers, it
is likely that the user is deciding the fracture shape rather than the model.

8.4 Fracturing Fluids and Additives
To create the fracture, a fluid is pumped into the wellbore at a high rate to increase the pres-
sure in the wellbore at the perforations to a value greater than the breakdown pressure of the
formation. The breakdown pressure is generally believed to be the sum of the in-situ stress and
the  tensile  strength  of  the  rock.  Once  the  formation  is  broken  down  and  the  fracture  created,
the fracture can be extended at a pressure called the fracture-propagation pressure. The fracture-
propagation pressure is equal to the sum of the in-situ stress, plus the net pressure drop, plus
the near-wellbore pressure drop. The net pressure drop is equal to the pressure drop down the
fracture as the result of viscous fluid flow in the fracture, plus any pressure increase caused by
tip effects. The near-wellbore pressure drop can be a combination of the pressure drop of the

Chapter 8—Hydraulic Fracturing

IV-337

Fig. 8.10—KGD geometry for a 2D fracture.18

viscous fluid flowing through the perforations and/or the pressure drop resulting from tortuosity
between  the  wellbore  and  the  propagating  fracture.  Thus,  the  fracturing-fluid  properties  are
very important in the creation and propagation of the fracture.

8.4.1 Properties of a Fracturing Fluid.  The ideal fracturing fluid should be compatible with
the formation rock and fluid, generate enough pressure drop down the fracture to create a wide
fracture, be able to transport the propping agent in the fracture, break back to a low-viscosity
fluid for cleanup after the treatment, and be cost-effective. The family of fracture fluids avail-
able  consist  of  water-based  fluids,  oil-based  fluids,  acid-based  fluids,  and  foam  fluids.  Table
8.3  lists  the  types  of  fracturing  fluids  that  are  available  and  the  general  use  of  each  type  of
fluid. For most reservoirs, water-based fluids with appropriate additives will be best. In some
cases,  foam  generated  with  N2  or  CO2  can  be  used  to  stimulate  shallow,  low-pressure  zones
successfully. When water is used as the base fluid, the water should be tested for quality. Ta-
ble 8.4 presents generally accepted levels of water quality for use in hydraulic fracturing.

The viscosity of the fracture fluid is important. The fluid should be viscous enough (normal-
ly 50 to 1000 cp) to create a wide fracture (normally 0.2 to 1.0 in.) and transport the propping
agent  into  the  fracture  (normally  hundreds  to  thousands  of  feet).  The  density  of  the  fluid  is
also important. Water-based fluids have densities near 8.4 ppg. Oil-base fluid densities will be
70 to 80% of the densities of water-based fluids. Foam-fluid densities can be substantially less
than those of water-based fluids. The fluid density affects the surface injection pressure and the

IV-338

ability  of  the  fluid  to  flow  back  after  the  treatment.  In  low-pressure  reservoirs,  low-density
fluids, like foam, can be used to assist in the fluid cleanup.

A fundamental principle used in all fracture models is that “the fracture volume is equal to
the total volume of fluid injected minus the volume of fluid that leaks off into the reservoir.”13
The fluid efficiency is the percentage of fluid that is still in the fracture at any point in time,
when compared with the total volume injected at the same point in time. The concept of fluid
loss was used by Howard and Fast to determine fracture area.13 If too much fluid leaks off, the
fluid  has  a  low  efficiency  (10  to  20%),  and  the  created  fracture  volume  will  be  only  a  small
fraction of the total volume injected. However, if the fluid efficiency is too high (80 to 90%),
the fracture will not close rapidly after the treatment. Ideally, a fluid efficiency of 40 to 60%
will  provide  an  optimum  balance  between  creating  the  fracture  and  having  the  fracture  close
down after the treatment.

In most low-permeability reservoirs, fracture-fluid loss and efficiency are controlled by the
formation permeability. In high-permeability formations, a fluid-loss additive is often added to
the fracture fluid to reduce leakoff and improve fluid efficiency. In naturally fractured or high-
ly cleated formations, the leakoff can be extremely high, with efficiencies down in the range of
10 to 20%, or less. To fracture treat naturally fractured formations, the treatment often must be
pumped at high injection rates with fluid-loss additives.

8.4.2 Fracture-Fluid Additives.  Typical additives for a fracture fluid have been described in
detail  by  Ely.21  Typical  additives  for  a  water-based  polymer  fluid  are  briefly  described  next.
Table 8.5 presents additional information on additives.

Polymers are used to viscosify the fluid. Crosslinkers are used to change the viscous fluid
to a pseudoplastic fluid. Biocides are used to kill bacteria in the mix water. Buffers are used to
control  the  pH  of  the  fracture  fluid.  Surfactants  are  used  to  lower  the  surface  tension.  Fluid-
loss  additives  are  used  to  minimize  fluid  leakoff  into  the  formation.  Stabilizers  are  used  to

keep  the  fluid  viscous  at  high  temperature.  Breakers  are  used  to  break  the  polymers  and
crosslink sites at low temperature.

The  operator  of  an  oil  or  gas  well  normally  does  not  own  the  equipment,  fluids,  or  addi-
tives required to pump a fracture treatment. The operator hires a service company to mix and
pump the fracture treatment. Each service company has its own research department for devel-
oping  fracture  fluids  and  additives.  Each  service  company  obtains  its  additives  from  various
suppliers. As such, there are no “rules” one can use to select the specific additives for a frac-
ture fluid without first consulting with the service company that will mix and pump the fluid
into the well. Many times, pilot tests of the fracture fluids must be conducted to be certain all
the additives will work properly at the temperature in the reservoir and for the duration of the
treatment.

8.5 Propping Agents and Fracture Conductivity
Propping  agents  are  required  to  “prop  open”  the  fracture  once  the  pumps  are  shut  down  and
the fracture begins to close. The ideal propping agent is strong, resistant to crushing, resistant
to  corrosion,  has  a  low  density,  and  is  readily  available  at  low  cost.22  The  products  that  best
meet these desired traits are silica sand, resin-coated sand (RCS), and ceramic proppants.

8.5.1 Types of Propping Agents.  Silica sand is obtained from sand mining. There are several
sources in the United States and a few outside the United States. The sand must be tested to be
sure it has the necessary compressive strength to be used in any specific situation. Generally,
sand  is  used  to  prop  open  fractures  in  shallow  formations.  Sand  is  much  less  expensive  per
pound than RCS or ceramic proppants.

RCS is stronger than sand and is used where more compressive strength is required to min-
imize proppant crushing. Some resins can be used to form a consolidated pack in the fracture,

IV-340

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

which  will  help  to  eliminate  proppant  flow  back  into  the  wellbore.  RCS  is  more  expensive
than sand, but it has an effective density that is less than sand.

Ceramic  proppants  consist  of  sintered  bauxite,  intermediate-strength  proppant  (ISP),  and
lightweight proppant (LWP). The strength of a ceramic proppant is proportional to its density.
Also, the higher-strength proppants, like sintered bauxite, cost more than ISP and LWP. Ceram-
ic proppants are used to stimulate deep (> 8,000 ft) wells where large values of in-situ stresses
will apply large forces on the propping agent.

8.5.2 Factors Affecting Fracture Conductivity.   The  fracture  conductivity  is  the  product  of
propped fracture width and the permeability of the propping agent, as Fig. 8.13 illustrates. The
permeability of all the commonly used propping agents (sand, RCS, and the ceramic proppants)
will be 100 to 200+ darcies when no stress has been applied to the propping agent. However,
the conductivity of the fracture will be reduced during the life of the well because of increas-
ing  stress  on  the  propping  agents,  stress  corrosion  affecting  the  proppant  strength,  proppant
crushing, proppant embedment into the formation, and damage resulting from gel residue or fluid-
loss additives.

The  effective  stress  on  the  propping  agent  is  the  difference  between  the  in-situ  stress  and
the flowing pressure in the fracture, as Fig. 8.14 illustrates. As the well is produced, the effec-
tive  stress  on  the  propping  agent  will  normally  increase  because  the  value  of  the  flowing

Chapter 8—Hydraulic Fracturing

IV-341

bottomhole pressure will be decreasing. However, as Eq. 8.1 shows, the in-situ stress will de-
crease  with  time  as  the  reservoir  pressure  declines.  This  phenomenon  of  decreasing  in-situ
stress as the reservoir pressure declines was proven conclusively by Salz.9 Fig. 8.15 illustrates
the differences in fracture conductivity as effective stress increases on the propping agent for a
variety of commonly used propping agents. The data in Fig. 8.15 clearly show that for shallow
wells, where the effective stress is less than 6,000 psi, sand can be used to create high-conduc-
tivity  fractures.  As  the  effective  stress  increases  to  larger  and  larger  values,  then  the  higher-
strength, more-expensive propping agents must be used to create a high conductivity fracture.

When  choosing  a  propping  agent,  a  proppant  that  will  maintain  enough  conductivity  after
all crushing and embedment occurs must be chosen. The effects of non-Darcy flow, multiphase
flow, and gel residue damage should also be considered.

8.5.3 Proppant Transport.  To  create  a  hydraulic  fracture,  fluid  is  injected  at  high  rate  and
pressure into a wellbore and into a formation that is open to the wellbore. Viscous fluid flow
within the fracture and tip effects create the net pressure required to generate the created width
profile  and  the  created  fracture  height.  The  volume  of  fluid  pumped  will  affect  the  created
fracture length. However, without pumping a propping agent into the fracture, the created frac-
ture will close once the pumping operation ceases. The flow of oil and gas from the formation

Fig. 8.14—Effective stress on the propping agent.

into the fracture is dependent on the propped fracture dimensions. The really important charac-
teristics  of  a  fracture  are  the  propped  width,  height,  and  length  distributions;  therefore,  prop-
pant  transport  considerations  are  very  important  in  designing  a  hydraulic  fracture  treatment.
Fig.  8.16  illustrates  the  difference  between  the  created  fracture  dimensions  and  the  propped
fracture dimensions.

The first fluid pumped into a well during a fracture treatment is called the “prepad.” The
prepad is used to fill the casing and tubing, test the system for pressure, and break down the
formation. Next, the pad fluid, which is the viscous fracturing fluid used during the treatment,
is pumped. No propping agent has been added to the pad. The purpose of the pad is to create a
tall, wide fracture that will accept the propping agent. Following the pad, the fluid containing
propping agent, which is called the slurry, is pumped. The slurry moves into the fracture, trans-
porting the propping agent. The particles move up, out, and down the fracture with the slurry.
The particles also can settle in the fracture as a result of gravitational forces.

Daneshy23 provided a thorough summary of proppant transport issues. The effects of gravi-
ty on proppant settling can be computed by beginning with Stokes’ law. Eq. 8.8 is Stokes’ law
for a single spherical particle of diameter dp and density ρp settling in a Newtonian fluid with a
density of ρf and a viscosity of μ.

Eq. 8.8 shows that the settling velocity will increase as the diameter and density of the prop-
ping  agent  increase  and  as  the  density  and  viscosity  of  the  fracturing  fluid  decrease.  To

minimize proppant settling, propping agents that are smaller in diameter and/or less dense, as
well as a more viscous fluid, can be used.

However,  Stokes’  law  must  be  modified  with  the  use  of  non-Newtonian  fluids  and  to  ac-
count for the other particles in suspension in the slurry during the pumping operation. Ref. 23
provides  a  complete  discussion  on  the  factors  that  affect  proppant  transport  and  how  Stokes’
law  has  been  modified  to  account  for  many  important  factors.  For  example,  at  low  proppant
concentrations (1 to 3 ppg), the viscosity of the slurry is relatively unchanged. At high prop-
pant  concentrations  (8  to  14  ppg),  the  slurry  viscosity  can  be  3  to  10  times  more  than  the
viscosity of the clean fluid. Such factors must be recognized and included in any fracture-prop-
agation design model.

There are other factors that must be included when trying to compute the propped fracture
dimensions. The type of fracture fluid will affect proppant transport. Linear fracture fluid will
not transport proppants as well as fluids with structure, such as crosslinked fluids or viscoelas-
tic  surfactant  fluids.  Geologic  realities  also  must  be  considered.  For  example,  no  fracture  is
exactly  vertical,  and  the  walls  of  a  fracture  are  rarely  smooth.  If  there  are  turns  and  ledges
along  the  fracture  walls,  these  geologic  features  tend  to  reduce  proppant  settling  when  com-
pared with the theoretical equations for transport in smooth-wall, parallel-plate systems. Smith
et  al.24  discussed  other  issues  and  presented  several  case  histories  in  which  fracture-treatment
data  were  analyzed  to  determine  the  propped  fracture  dimensions.  Smith  stated  that  fracture
height growth during and after pumping operations, fluid loss in layered formations, and slurry
viscosity all affect the propped fracture dimensions.

8.6 Fracture Treatment Design

8.6.1 Data Requirements.  The most important data for designing a fracture treatment are the
in-situ  stress  profile,  formation  permeability,  fluid-loss  characteristics,  total  fluid  volume
pumped,  propping  agent  type  and  amount,  pad  volume,  fracture-fluid  viscosity,  injection  rate,
and formation modulus. It is very important to quantify the in-situ stress profile and the perme-
ability profile of the zone to be stimulated, plus the layers of rock above and below the target
zone that will influence fracture height growth.

There is a structured method that should be followed to design, optimize, execute, evaluate,
and reoptimize the fracture treatments in any reservoir. The first step is always the construction
of  a  complete  and  accurate  data  set.  Table  8.1  lists  the  sources  for  the  data  required  to  run
fracture  propagation  and  reservoir  models.  The  design  engineer  must  be  capable  of  analyzing
logs, cores, production data, and well-test data and be capable of digging through well files to
obtain  all  the  information  needed  to  design  and  evaluate  the  well  that  is  to  be  hydraulically
fracture treated.

Chapter 8—Hydraulic Fracturing

IV-345

Fig. 8.17—Process for selecting a fracture fluid.

Design  Procedures.    To  design  the  optimum  treatment,  the  effect  of  fracture  length  and
fracture conductivity on the productivity and the ultimate recovery from the well must be deter-
mined. As in all engineering problems, sensitivity runs need to be made to evaluate uncertain-
ties,  such  as  estimates  of  formation  permeability  and  drainage  area.  The  production  data
obtained  from  the  reservoir  model  should  be  used  in  an  economics  model  to  determine  the
optimum  fracture  length  and  conductivity.  Then  a  fracture  treatment  must  be  designed  with  a
fracture  propagation  model  to  achieve  the  desired  length  and  conductivity  at  minimum  cost.
The most important concept is to design a fracture with the appropriate data and models that
will result in the optimum economic benefit to the well operator, as Fig. 8.2 shows.

A hydraulic fracture propagation model should be run to determine what needs to be mixed
and pumped into the well to achieve the optimum values of propped fracture length and frac-
ture conductivity. The base data set should be used to make a base case run. The engineer then
determines which variables are the most uncertain. The values of in-situ stress, Young’s modu-
lus,  permeability,  and  fluid-loss  coefficient  often  are  not  known  with  certainty  and  must  be
estimated.  The  design  should  acknowledge  these  uncertainties  and  make  sensitivity  runs  with
the fracture-propagation model to determine the effect of these uncertainties on the design pro-
cess. As databases are developed, the number and magnitude of the uncertainties will diminish.
In effect, the design engineer should fracture treat the well many times on his or her com-
puter. Sensitivity runs lead to a better design and educate the design engineer on how certain
variables affect the values of both the created and propped fracture dimensions.

Fracturing Fluid Selection.  The selection of the fracture fluid for the treatment is a critical
decision. Economides et al.25 developed a flow chart that can be used to select the category of
fracture fluid on the basis of factors such as reservoir temperature, reservoir pressure, the ex-
pected value of fracture half-length, and water sensitivity. Fig. 8.17 presents the fluid-selection
flow chart for a gas well. The information in Fig. 8.17 is compatible with the information in
Table 8.3.

IV-346

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 8.18—Proppant selection based on closure pressure (after Economides and Nolte).25

To use Fig. 8.17, one must follow a path that depends on formation temperature, reservoir
pressure, and an intangible variable called water sensitivity. For a low-temperature, high-pres-
sure reservoir, the desired fracture conductivity and the desired fracture length must be consid-
ered.  Economides  et  al.  suggest  that  Fig.  8.17  can  also  be  used  to  select  a  fluid  to  fracture
treat an oil reservoir that is not water sensitive.

The definition of what comprises a water-sensitive reservoir and what causes the damage is
not  always  clear.  Most  reservoirs  contain  water,  and  most  oil  reservoirs  can  be  waterflooded
successfully.  Thus,  most  fracture  treatments  should  be  pumped  with  suitable  water-base  frac-
ture  fluids.  Acid-base  fluids  can  be  used  in  carbonates;  however,  many  deep  carbonate  reser-
voirs have been stimulated successfully with water-base fluids containing propping agents. Oil-
base  fluids  should  be  used  only  in  oil  reservoirs  when  water-base  fluids  have  proved
conclusively to not work. Pumping oil-base fluids is more dangerous than pumping water-base
fluids, and special care should be taken in the field.

Propping-Agent  Selection.    Fig.  8.18  presents  a  flow  chart  created  by  Economides  and
Nolte25  for  selecting  propping  agents.  To  use  Fig.  8.18,  the  maximum  effective  stress  on  the
propping agent must be determined. The effective stress is defined in Fig. 8.14. The maximum
effective stress depends on the minimum value of flowing bottomhole pressure expected during
the life of the well. If the maximum effective stress is less than 6,000 psi, then Fig. 8.18 rec-
ommends that sand be used as the propping agent. If the maximum effective stress is between
6,000 and 12,000 psi, then either RCS or intermediate-strength proppant should be used, depend-
ing on the temperature. For cases in which the maximum effective stress is greater than 12,000
psi, high-strength bauxite should be used as the propping agent.

Fig.  8.18  should  be  used  only  as  a  guide,  because  there  will  be  exceptions.  For  example,
even  if  the  maximum  effective  stress  is  less  than  6,000  psi,  the  designer  may  choose  to  use
RCS  or  other  additives  to  “lock”  the  proppant  in  place  when  proppant  flowback  becomes  an
issue.  In  high-flow-rate  gas  wells,  non-Darcy  pressure  drops  can  lead  to  the  use  of  ceramic
proppants to maximize fracture conductivity.

Chapter 8—Hydraulic Fracturing

For fracture treatments in countries that do not mine sand for fracturing, the largest cost of
the proppant is often the shipping charges. If the propping agent must be imported, intermediate-
strength proppants may be selected, even for relatively shallow wells, because the cost differen-
tial between the intermediate strength proppants and sand is not much of a factor.

To confirm exactly which type of propping agent should be used during a specific fracture
treatment, the designer should factor in the estimated values of formation permeability and opti-
mum fracture half-length. Cinco-Ley26 published an equation that can be used to determine the
optimum fracture conductivity. The dimensionless fracture conductivity is defined as

C f D =

πk L f
C f

. ............................................................. (8.9)

To minimize the pressure drop down the fracture, the value of Cf D should be approximate-

ly 10 or greater. The required fracture conductivity can be computed as

C f D = 31.4159k Lf , ........................................................ (8.10)

where k = the formation permeability (md) and Lf = the fracture half-length (ft). For example,
if the formation permeability is 25 md and the optimum fracture half-length is 50 ft, then the
optimum fracture conductivity would be 3,927 md-ft. The treatment must be designed to create
a fracture wide enough, and pump proppants at concentrations high enough, to achieve the con-
ductivity required to optimize the treatment. However, in many low-permeability reservoirs, the
dimensionless fracture conductivity, Cf D, must be 50 to 100 for the fracture fluid to clean up
after the treatment. As such, the “optimum” value of Cf D = 10 is considered a minimum value,
and Cf D should be even larger than 10 when fracture fluid cleanup issues are a problem. In high-
permeability formations, Cf D values of 10 or greater are often not feasible.

Some tend to compromise fracture length and conductivity in an often unsuccessful attempt
to prevent damage to the formation around the fracture. Holditch27 showed that substantial dam-
age  to  the  formation  around  the  fracture  can  be  tolerated  as  long  as  the  optimum  fracture
length and conductivity are achieved. However, damage to the fracture or the propping agents
can be very detrimental to the productivity of the fractured well. Ideally, the optimum fracture
length and conductivity can be created while minimizing damage to the formation. If the oppo-
site  occurs—that  is,  the  formation  is  not  damaged,  but  the  fracture  is  not  long  enough  or
conductive enough—then the well performance usually will be disappointing.

8.6.2 Evaluating Risks in the Design.  The well operator always should evaluate risks such as
mechanical risks, product price risks, and geologic risks. Uncertainties in the data can be evalu-
ated  by  making  sensitivity  runs  with  both  reservoir  models  and  fracture  propagation  models.
One of the main risks in hydraulic fracturing is that the entire treatment will be pumped and/or
paid for (i.e., the money is spent), but, for whatever reason, the well does not produce at the
desired  flow  rates  nor  achieve  the  expected  cumulative  recovery.  In  some  cases,  mechanical
problems  with  the  well  or  the  surface  equipment  cause  the  treatment  to  fail.  Other  times,  the
reservoir does not respond as expected.

To  evaluate  the  risk  of  mechanical  or  reservoir  problems,  100%  of  the  costs  and  only  a
fraction of the revenue can be used in the economic analyses. For example, one in every five
fracture treatments in a certain formation is not successful; therefore, 80% of the expected rev-
enue  and  100%  of  the  expected  costs  can  be  used  to  determine  the  optimum  fracture  length.
Fig. 8.19 illustrates how such an analysis can alter the desired fracture length.

Finally, after the optimum, risk-adjusted fracture treatment has been designed, it is extreme-
ly  important  to  be  certain  the  optimum  design  is  pumped  correctly  into  the  well.  For  this  to
occur,  the  operator  and  the  service  company  should  work  together  to  provide  quality  control
before, during, and after the treatment is pumped. The best engineers spend sufficient time in
the office designing the treatment correctly, and then go to the field to help supervise the field
operations or provide on-site advice to the supervisor.

8.7 Acid Fracturing
Designing an acid-fracturing treatment is similar to designing a fracturing treatment with a prop-
ping  agent.  Ref.  28  presents  a  thorough  explanation  of  the  fundamentals  concerning  acid
fracturing. The main difference between acid fracturing and proppant fracturing is the way frac-
ture conductivity is created. In proppant fracturing, a propping agent is used to prop open the
fracture after the treatment is completed. In acid fracturing, acid is used to “etch” channels in
the  rock  that  comprise  the  walls  of  the  fracture.  Thus,  the  rock  has  to  be  partially  soluble  in
acid so that channels can be etched in the fracture walls. As such, the application of acid frac-
turing  is  confined  to  carbonate  reservoirs  and  should  never  be  used  to  stimulate  sandstone,
shale,  or  coal-seam  reservoirs.  Long  etched  fractures  are  difficult  to  obtain  because  of  high
leakoff and rapid acid reaction with the formation.

8.7.1 Acid-Fracturing Candidate Selection.  In general, acid fracturing is best applied in shal-
low,  low-temperature  carbonate  reservoirs.  The  best  candidates  are  shallow,  in  which  the
reservoir temperature is less than 200°F and the maximum effective stress on the fracture will

Chapter 8—Hydraulic Fracturing

IV-349

be  less  than  5,000  psi.  Low  temperature  reduces  the  reaction  rate  between  the  acid  and  the
formation, which allows the acid to penetrate deeper into the fracture before becoming spent.
Because  limestone  reservoirs  are  ductile,  a  low  effective  stress  on  the  fracture  is  required  to
maintain adequate fracture conductivity over the life of the well. In deep limestone reservoirs,
in which problems exist with high bottomhole temperature and high effective stress on the frac-
ture,  water-based  fluids  with  propping  agents  can  be  used  successfully  to  stimulate  the
formation.29  In  deep  dolomite  reservoirs  that  are  less  ductile  than  limestones,  acid  fracturing
may work satisfactorily; however, proppant fracturing with water-based fluids may work also.

Acid-fracture fluids with propping agents are not recommended. When the acid reacts with
the  carbonate  formation,  fines  are  always  released.  If  a  propping  agent  is  used  with  acid,  the
fines plug up the propping agent, resulting in very low fracture conductivity. When deciding to
stimulate many carbonate reservoirs, the costs and benefits of an acid-fracture treatment should
be compared with a treatment that uses water-based fluids carrying a propping agent. It should
not be assumed that acid fracturing works best because the formation is a carbonate.

There could be a few applications in which acid fracturing could be the preferred treatment
in a deep, high-temperature carbonate reservoir. For example, if a high-permeability carbonate
reservoir is damaged as a result of drilling operations or non-Darcy flow effects, then a stimu-
lation treatment can be applied to improve the productivity index. In such cases, injecting acid
at fracturing rates can improve the permeability near the wellbore, which will reduce the pres-
sure drop caused by skin and/or non-Darcy flow.30

In other cases, especially in deep dolomites that contain an abundance of natural fractures,
acid fracturing may work better than proppant fracturing. In such reservoirs, it is common that
multiple fractures are opened when pumping begins. With multiple fractures, no single fracture
ever gains enough width to accept large concentrations of propping agent. Near-wellbore scree-
nouts often occur as the proppant concentration is increased to more than 2 to 3 ppg. In such
cases, acid fracturing may work better than proppant fracturing.

Other considerations when selecting acid-fracturing candidates are cost and safety. In deep,
hot reservoirs, the cost of an acid-fracturing treatment can exceed the costs of a proppant-frac-
ture  treatment.  In  hot  reservoirs,  expensive  chemicals  are  required  to  inhibit  the  acid-reaction
rate with the steel tubular goods and to retard the reaction rate with the formation. Acid must
be handled with extreme care in the field. When pumping large volumes of high-strength acid,
at high injection rates and at high pressures, safety should be the top concern of everyone in
the field.

8.7.2 Acid Fluids Used in Fracturing.  The  most  commonly  used  fluid  in  acid  fracturing  is
15% hydrochloric acid (HCl). To obtain more acid penetration and more etching, 28% HCl is
sometimes  used  as  the  primary  acid  fluid.  On  occasion,  formic  acid  (HCOOH)  or  acetic  acid
(CH3COOH)  is  used  because  these  acids  are  easier  to  inhibit  under  high-temperature  condi-
tions.  However,  acetic  and  formic  acid  cost  more  than  HCl.  Hydrofluoric  acid  (HF)  should
never be used during an acid fracturing treatment in a carbonate reservoir.

Typically, a gelled water or crosslinked gel fluid is used as the pad fluid to fill the well-
bore and break down the formation. The water-based pad is then pumped to create the desired
fracture height, width, and length for the hydraulic fracture. Once the desired values of created
fracture dimensions are achieved, the acid is pumped and fingers down the fracture to etch the
walls of the fracture to create fracture conductivity. The acid is normally gelled, crosslinked, or
emulsified to maintain fracture width and minimize fluid leakoff. Because the acid is reactive
with the formation, fluid loss is a primary consideration in the fluid design. Large amounts of
fluid-loss  additives  are  generally  added  to  the  acid  fluid  to  minimize  fluid  leakoff.  Fluid-loss
control is most important in high permeability and/or naturally fractured carbonate formations;
thus, long etched fractures are difficult to obtain.

8.7.3 Acid-Fracture Design Considerations.  In  addition  to  Ref.  28,  two  papers31,32  provide
the  technology  commonly  used  today  to  design  acid  fracture  treatments.  There  are  several
unique  considerations  to  be  understood  when  designing  acid  fracture  treatments.  Of  primary
concern is acid-penetration distance down the fracture. The pad fluid is used to create the de-
sired  fracture  dimensions.  Then  the  acid  is  pumped  down  the  fracture  to  etch  the  fracture
walls, which creates fracture conductivity. When the acid contacts the walls of the fracture, the
reaction between the acid and the carbonate is almost instantaneous, especially if the tempera-
ture of the acid is 200°F or greater. As such, the treatment must be designed to create a wide
fracture, with minimal leakoff, with viscous fluids. Fig. 8.2028 illustrates why the design engi-
neer  should  be  striving  to  create  a  wide  fracture.  If  a  wide  fracture  is  created  with  a  viscous
acid and minimal fluid loss, then a boundary layer of spent acid products will reduce the rate
at which the live acid contacts the formation at the walls of the fracture. However, as the flow
in the fracture becomes more turbulent and less laminar, the live acid will contact the walls of
the fracture more easily, and the acid will not penetrate very far into the fracture before becom-
ing spent.

Chapter 8—Hydraulic Fracturing

IV-351

Fig. 8.21—Effect of fracture width on acid-penetration distance.28

Factors  such  as  fracture  width,  injection  rate,  acid  viscosity,  and  reservoir  temperature  all
affect acid penetration. Figs. 8.21 and 8.2228 illustrate how fracture width and formation tem-
perature affect acid penetration in the fracture, respectively. In Fig. 8.21, as the fracture width
increases, the distance that unspent acid will reach in the fracture also increases. The distance
increases because, in a wide fracture, there is less turbulence. This results in less mixing as the
live acid moves down the fracture; therefore, the viscous and leakoff properties of the fracture
fluid should be controlled to maximize fracture width. Fig 8.22 contains information concern-
ing the effects of reservoir temperature, acid strength, and formation lithology. It is clear that
the use of higher-strength acid increases the penetration distance in the fracture before the acid
spending. Also, as temperature increases, the acid penetration distance decreases. As the temper-
ature increases, the reaction rates between the acid and the formation increase substantially. In
fact,  the  reaction  rate  doubles  every  time  the  temperature  increases  18°F.28  Fig.  8.22  also
shows  that  dolomite  is  less  reactive  with  HCl  than  limestone;  therefore,  acid  fracturing  may
work slightly better in reservoirs that are more highly dolomitized.

The problem with acid fracturing that prevents its successful application in many reservoirs
involves sustaining fracture conductivity over time. When the acid etches the fracture walls, the
resulting fracture conductivity can be several orders of magnitude more conductive than similar
treatments that use water-based fluids and propping agents. Fig. 8.23 presents data concerning
fracture  conductivity  as  a  function  of  effective  stress  on  the  fracture  and  rock  embedment
strength.28 The embedment strength is easily measured and can be correlated with the compres-
sive strength of the rock. As the compressive strength increases, the rock embedment strength
increases. The data in Fig. 8.23 show that, when the embedment strength is less than 100,000
psi, large fracture conductivities, on the order of 10 to 50,000 md-ft, can be created during an
acid-fracture treatment, as long as the effective stress on the fracture is 1,000 psi or less. How-
ever,  once  the  effective  stress  on  the  fracture  exceeds  5,000  psi,  the  fracture  conductivity
decreases substantially. As such, in deep limestone reservoirs in which the maximum effective

IV-352

stress on the fracture is much greater than 5,000 psi, an acid fracture will not stay open as the
well is produced. In such cases, water-based fluids carrying propping agents should be consid-
ered as an alternative to acid fracturing.

8.8 Fracturing High-Permeability Formations
Smith and Hannah33 documented the evolution of hydraulic fracturing in high-permeability reser-
voirs since the 1950s. The first fracture treatments in the 1950s were pumped in moderate- to
high-permeability  formations.  Those  treatments  were  designed  to  remove  formation  damage
that  usually  occurred  during  the  drilling  and  completion  operations.  Low-permeability  reser-
voirs  were  fracture  treated  in  the  1950s  and  1960s,  but,  at  low  oil  and  gas  prices,  low-
permeability reservoirs were generally not economic, even after a successful fracture treatment.
The values of high, moderate, and low permeability need to be defined on the basis of both
the  formation  permeability  and  the  reservoir  fluid  viscosity,  or  the  k/μ  ratio,  where  k  is  the
formation permeability in md, and μ is the formation fluid viscosity in cp. For a gas well, the
average viscosity of the gas is assumed to be approximately 0.02 cp. For a typical gas well, a
low-permeability formation might be where k < 0.1 md, a medium-permeability reservoir might
be  10  >  k  >  1  md,  and  a  high-permeability  reservoir  might  be  25  md  >  k.  If  the  formation
contains oil with a fluid viscosity of 2 cp, then all the permeability values must be multiplied
by  a  factor  of  100  to  determine  what  is  a  low-,  moderate-,  and  high-permeability  formation.
This example illustrates that the definition of “high permeability” also depends on the value of
the reservoir-fluid viscosity. In heavy-oil plays, in which the reservoir fluid viscosity is several
thousand centipoises, then formations with several Darcies permeability would be considered a
low-permeability reservoir. From this point forward, we assume that the formation fluid is ei-
ther  gas  or  light  oil;  thus,  a  formation  with  a  permeability  of  several  hundred  millidarcies  or
more will be considered high permeability.

and embedment strength.28

8.8.1 Candidate Selection Criteria for High-Permeability Formations.  The main reasons for
fracture  treating  high-permeability  formations  are  to  improve  both  the  reservoir  and  wellbore
communication, to bypass formation damage, to reduce the drawdown around the wellbore, to
increase the back stress on the formation, to control sand production, to reduce fines migration,
to reduce asphaltene deposition, and to reduce water coning.34 As mentioned, the early fracture
treatments were pumped to break through damage near the wellbore and increase the productiv-
ity index of the formation. Today, fracture treatments in high-permeability wells are pumped to
bypass  damage,  but  other  reasons  have  become  just  as  important.  For  example,  many  treat-
ments  are  pumped  for  sand-control  purposes.  By  creating  a  short,  highly  conductive  fracture
connecting the reservoir to the wellbore, the productivity index is increased; thus, more oil and
gas can be produced with a lower drawdown. As the drawdown is reduced, the tendency of a
poorly consolidated reservoir to produce sand is also reduced. The reduction in drawdown also
helps to deter fines migration, asphaltene deposition, and water coning in certain formations.

IV-354

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

8.8.2 Design Considerations for High-Permeability Formations.  Most fracture treatments in
high-permeability formations are designed to achieve a tip screenout.35 A tip screenout design
is one in which the pad volume is designed carefully so that the pad leaks off during the treat-
ment, causing the propping agent to bridge at the tip of the fracture near the end of the job. At
this point, the fracture quits growing in length, but pumping continues. As pumping continues,
the pressure in the fracture increases, which leads to increasing width and, sometimes, increas-
ing  height.  The  fracture  continues  to  inflate  and  is  packed  with  the  propping  agent.  The
purpose of a tip-screenout design is to create a short, extremely wide fracture that is complete-
ly packed with the propping agent.

Smith  and  Hannah33  documented  that  Amoco  successfully  combined  hydraulic  fracturing
and gravel packing in the Hackberry field south of Lake Charles, Louisiana, in 1984. Hannah
et al.36 described a combination fracture treatment and gravel pack in an offshore field in 1994.
Since the early 1990s, “frac-pack” treatments have become standard for many producing areas
worldwide. Frac-pack treatments tend to reduce the skin factors from very high numbers (10 to
50) to essentially a skin of zero. In other words, the damage to the formation surrounding the
wellbore during the drilling and completion of the well is negated by the frac-pack operations.
In  many  cases,  the  productivity  index  is  increased  by  a  factor  of  three  or  more  by  the  frac-
pack treatments.36

Park37 provided information concerning the design criteria for tip screenout treatments that
are part of a frac-pack operation. In general, the designed fracture lengths for a frac-pack treat-
ment are from 10 to 50 ft. The treatments are designed to create as wide a propped fracture as
possible; thus, treatments are designed for proppant concentrations as high as 17 to 20 lbm/ft2.
Many unconsolidated or poorly consolidated sands have values of Young’s modulus that range
from  90,000  to  200,000  psi,  which  theoretically  can  result  in  created  fracture  widths  of  3  in.
and  propped  fracture  widths  of  2  in.  As  the  value  of  modulus  increases,  the  rock  becomes
stiffer,  the  created  fractures  become  narrower,  and  the  amount  of  propping  agent  that  can  be
placed  in  the  fracture  decreases.  Tip  screenout  treatments  can  be  designed  with  almost  any
fracture-treatment-design model. Just like any design, the engineer must have data that describe
the reservoir and the treatment conditions accurately. Some fracture design models have special
features  to  optimize  the  size  of  the  pad  volume,  the  leakoff  characteristics  of  the  fluid,  and
other variables that affect tip screenout designs.

Early frac-pack treatments were pumped with the equipment, fluids, and gravel commonly
used  in  gravel-packing  operations.  For  example,  the  fluid  most  commonly  used  was  hydrox-
yethyl cellulose gel because it is clean and should not significantly damage the reservoir. Also,
40-  to  60-mesh  gravel  was  used  as  the  propping  agent.  As  the  technology  has  evolved,  other
fluids  such  as  hydroxypropyl  guar  crosslinked  with  borates  and  viscoelastic  surfactant  fluids
have been used successfully to pump a frac-pack treatment. Because fracture conductivity is so
important, the use of 20- to 40-mesh proppants is now common.

In  summary,  fracture  treatment  technology  was  first  developed  in  the  1950s  to  break
through  damage  in  high-permeability  reservoirs.  In  the  1960s,  gelled  water  fluids  were  used
successfully to fracture treat both low- and high-permeability oil and gas wells. The technology
evolved  in  the  1970  and  1980s;  the  industry  was  pumping  massive  hydraulic  fracture  treat-
ments  in  microdarcy  reservoirs.  Massive  treatments  in  tight  reservoirs  are  still  being  pumped
today and will become even more important in the future. However, in the 1990s, because of
the tip screenout design process and frac-pack operations, stimulation of high-permeability reser-
voirs  is  once  again  an  important  aspect  of  hydraulic  fracturing  to  reduce  the  effects  of
formation damage and to enhance gravel packing.

8.9 Fracture Diagnostics
Fracture  diagnostics  involves  analyzing  the  data  before,  during,  and  after  a  hydraulic  fracture
treatment to determine the shape and dimensions of both the created and propped fracture. Frac-
ture diagnostic techniques are divided into several groups.38

8.9.1 Direct Far-Field Techniques.  Direct far-field methods consists of tiltmeter-fracture-map-
ping  and  microseismic-fracture-mapping  techniques.  These  techniques  require  sophisticated
instrumentation  embedded  in  boreholes  surrounding  the  well  to  be  fracture  treated.  When  a
hydraulic fracture is created, the expansion of the fracture causes the earth around the fracture
to deform. Tiltmeters can be used to measure the deformation and to compute the approximate
direction  and  size  of  the  created  fracture.  Surface  tiltmeters  are  placed  in  shallow  holes  sur-
rounding the well. Downhole tiltmeters are placed in vertical wells at depths near the zone to
be  fracture  treated.  As  with  surface  tiltmeters,  downhole  tiltmeter  data  are  analyzed  to  deter-
mine the orientation and dimensions of the created fracture.

Microseismic  fracture  mapping  relies  on  a  downhole  receiver  array  of  accelerometers  or
geophones  to  locate  microseisms  or  microearthquakes  that  are  triggered  by  shear  slippage  in
natural fractures surrounding the hydraulic fracture. Fig. 8.24 illustrates the principle of micro-
seismic  fracture  mapping.38  In  essence,  noise  is  created  in  a  zone  surrounding  the  hydraulic
fracture. With sensitive arrays of instruments, the noise can be monitored, recorded, analyzed,
and mapped.

Although direct far-field techniques can be used to map hydraulic fractures, the technology
is  still  under  development.  When  the  technology  is  used  in  a  field,  the  data  and  knowledge
gained are often used on subsequent wells to spread out the costs. Knowing the fracture orien-
tation is useful in planning field development and in optimizing future fracture treatments.

8.9.2 Direct Near-Wellbore Techniques.  Direct near-wellbore techniques are run in the well
that is being fracture treated to locate or image the portion of fracture that is very near (within
inches of) the wellbore. Direct near-wellbore techniques consist of tracer, temperature, produc-
tion,  borehole  image,  downhole  video,  and  caliper  logs.  If  a  hydraulic  fracture  intersects  the
wellbore, these direct near-wellbore techniques can be of some benefit in locating the hydraulic
fracture.

However, these near-wellbore techniques are not unique and cannot supply information on
the  size  or  shape  of  the  fracture  once  the  fracture  is  two  to  three  wellbore  diameters  in  dis-
tance from the wellbore. In naturally fractured reservoirs, in which multiple fractures are likely

IV-356

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

to exist, the reliability of direct near-wellbore techniques are even more speculative. As such,
direct  near-wellbore  techniques  are  used  only  to  find  where  the  hydraulic  fracture  exited  the
wellbore and to map the fracture that is essentially connected directly to the wellbore.

8.9.3 Indirect Fracture Techniques.  Indirect fracture techniques consist of hydraulic fracture
modeling  of  net  pressures,  pressure-transient-test  analyses,  and  production-data  analyses.  Be-
cause  the  fracture-treatment  data  and  the  post-fracture  production  data  are  normally  available
on every well, the indirect fracture diagnostic techniques are the most widely used methods to
determine the shape and dimensions of both the created and the propped hydraulic fracture.

The fracture-treatment data can be analyzed with a P3D fracture propagation model to deter-
mine  the  shape  and  dimensions  of  the  created  fracture.  The  P3D  model  is  used  to  history
match the fracturing data, such as injection rates and injection pressures. Data, such as the in-
situ  stress  and  permeability  in  key  layers  of  rock,  can  be  varied  (within  reason)  to  achieve  a
history match of the field data.

Post-fracture production and pressure data can be analyzed with a 3D reservoir simulator to
estimate  the  shape  and  dimensions  of  the  propped  fracture.  Values  of  formation  permeability,
fracture  length,  and  fracture  conductivity  can  be  varied  in  the  reservoir  model  to  achieve  a
history match of the field data.

The main limitations of these indirect techniques are that the solutions may not be unique
and may require as much fixed data as possible. For example, if the engineer has determined
the formation permeability from a well test or production test before the fracture treatment, so
that the value of formation permeability is known and can be fixed in the models, the solution
concerning values of fracture length become more unique. Most of the information in the litera-
ture  concerning  post-fracture  analyses  of  hydraulic  fractures  has  been  derived  with  these
indirect fracture diagnostic techniques.

Limitations of Fracture Diagnostic Techniques.  Warpinski  discussed  many  of  these  same
fracture  diagnostic  techniques.39  Table  8.6  lists  certain  diagnostic  techniques  and  their
limitations.39 Fracture diagnostic techniques do work and can provide important data when en-
tering  a  new  area  or  a  new  formation.  In  most  cases,  however,  fracture  diagnostics  is  expen-
sive,  which  limits  its  widespread  use  in  industry.  In  the  future,  if  costs  are  reduced,  fracture
diagnostics may become more widely applied.

8.9.4 Net-Pressure Analysis.  Net pressure is defined as the pressure in the fracture minus the
in-situ stress. Nolte and Smith40 published a classic paper that can be used to interpret net-pres-
sure  behavior  in  the  field  or  after  the  treatment  to  determine  estimates  of  fracture  growth
patterns. Their analysis method uses the PKN theory, which assumes that as long as the frac-
ture height is contained, the net pressure will increase with time according to

pn µ Δte, ................................................................. (8.11)

where  ∕8

1 < e < ∕5

1 , and slope e = ∕5

1  for low leakoff and  ∕8

1  for high leakoff.

When Nolte and Smith began analyzing bottomhole pressure data collected during fracture
treatments, they found that the PKN theory held for certain situations, but other fracture propa-
gation  modes  were  observed.  Fig.  8.25  summarizes  their  findings.  In  Fig.  8.25,  Mode  I
conforms to Eq. 8.11; however, three other modes were identified by analyzing field data.

Mode II conforms to either stable height growth or increased fluid loss. Mode II fracturing
is not unusual, nor is it cause for concern. Lateral fracture growth during Mode II is less than
Mode I, but the fracture is still being propagated and can be filled with proppant.

When  the  slope  of  the  graph  of  log(pn)  vs.  log(Δt)  increases  to  a  unit  slope  (Mode  III),
then the fracture has stopped propagating in length, and the fracture is being inflated as the net

Chapter 8—Hydraulic Fracturing

IV-357

pressure increases. This is the desired behavior if a tip screenout treatment has been designed.
During Mode III, it is still possible to pack the fracture with proppant; however, the pressure
has to be monitored closely to be certain the maximum allowable surface injection pressure is
not exceeded. Mode IV occurs when the fracture height is increasing rapidly. Normally, rapid
height growth is not desirable, and the fracture treatment should be flushed and terminated if
Mode IV is reached during the treatment.

The  pressures  analyzed in  a  “net pressure  graph,”  such  as  Fig.  8.25,  are  bottomhole pres-
sures  and  should  be  corrected  for  near-wellbore  pressure  drops.  Fig  8.26  shows  the  pressures
in the entire system. During every fracture treatment, the surface pressure can be measured. On
certain wells, the bottomhole treating pressure (BHTP), which is the pressure inside the well-
bore  at  the  perforations,  can  be  measured.  If  the  BHTP  is  not  measured  directly,  then  that
value must be computed with the surface pressure and the estimates of pipe friction and hydro-
static head. The hydrostatic head can be estimated accurately, even when propping agents are
being  added,  because  a  densitometer  is  used  to  measure  the  density  of  the  slurry  as  it  is
pumped.  Problems  may  occur  in  trying  to  estimate  the  pipe  friction  when  using  crosslinked
polymer fluids containing propping agents. Significant errors can occur in the pipe friction esti-
mates when high proppant concentrations (> 4 ppg) are being pumped.

If  the  BHTP  is  computed  or  measured  successfully,  the  near-wellbore  pressure  drop  must
be subtracted to determine the pressure in the fracture near the wellbore, pf. The pressure in the

fracture  near  the  wellbore  is  the  value  that  must  be  known  and  analyzed  to  determine  the
width, height, and length of the fracture with either net pressure theory or P3D fracture propa-
gation  models.  The  near-wellbore  pressure  drop  is  composed  of  two  parts:  the  perforation
friction and tortuosity. By running a step-down test before the main fracture treatment, the near-
wellbore pressure drop often can be estimated accurately. One problem is that the perforation
friction and the tortuosity pressure drop can change during the treatment as the propping agent
is introduced. The propping agent can erode perforations or plug some of the pathways that are
causing the tortuosity pressure drops. At the end of the treatment, the pressure data need to be
analyzed  as  the  pumps  are  shut  down  to  determine  if  the  near-wellbore  pressure  drop  has
changed during the treatment.

8.10 Post-Fracture Well Behavior
There are many factors that the engineer must consider when analyzing the behavior of a well
after  it  has  been  fracture  treated.  The  engineer  should  analyze  the  productivity  index  of  the
well both before and after the fracture treatment. Other factors of importance are ultimate oil
and gas recovery and calculations to determine the propped fracture length, the fracture conduc-
tivity,  and  the  drainage  area  of  the  well.  Post-fracture  treatment  analyses  of  the  fracture
treatment  data,  the  production  data,  and  the  pressure  data  can  be  very  complicated  and  time
consuming. However, without adequate post-fracture evaluation, it will be impossible to contin-
ue the fracture treatment optimization process on subsequent wells.

8.10.1 Productivity Index Increase.  Many of the early treatments in the 1950s were designed
to increase the productivity index of damaged wells. These treatments were normally pumped

to break through damage in moderate- to high-permeability wells. The productivity index of an
oil well is

J is the productivity index in terms of barrels per psi per day or mcf-cp per psi squared per
day. Viscosity and compressibility are included in the equation describing the productivity in-
dex  of  a  gas  well,  because  they  are  pressure  dependent.  McGuire  and  Sikora41  published  a
procedure  (Fig. 8.27)  that was  the  first  tool  a  fracture-treatment design  engineer could  use  to
determine  the  fracture  length  and  fracture  conductivity  required  to  achieve  a  certain  fold  of
increase  in  the  productivity  index.  The  McGuire  and  Sikora  graph  can  be  used  to  draw  the
following conclusions:

IV-360

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 8.27—McGuire and Sikora graph.41

• For  high-permeability  reservoirs,  fracture  conductivity  is  more  important  than  fracture

• For low-permeability reservoirs, fracture length is more important than fracture conductivity.
• For a given fracture length, there is an optimum value of conductivity ratio.
• Most fracture treatments in undamaged formations should result in stimulation ratios of 2

length.

to 14.

These conclusions have allowed engineers to design successful fracture treatments for more

than 40 years.

At  approximately  the  same  time  as  the  classic  McGuire  and  Sikora  paper  was  published,
Prats42  published  another  classic  paper.  Assuming  J  is  the  productivity  index  for  a  fractured
well  at  steady-state flow,  and  Jo  is  the  productivity index  of  the  same  well  under  radial flow
conditions, Prats found that

for  a  well  containing  an  infinite  conductivity  fracture  whose  fracture  half-length  is  Lf.  Prats
explained that a well with a fracture half-length of 100 ft will produce as if the well had been
drilled  with  a  100-ft  diameter  drill  bit.  In  other  words,  the  hydraulic  fracture,  if  conductive
enough, acts to extend the wellbore and stimulate flow rate from the well. If the dimensionless
fracture conductivity, Cf D (Eq. 8.9), is equal to 10 or greater, the hydraulic fracture will essen-
tially act as if it is an infinitely conductive fracture.

8.10.2 Ultimate Recovery for Fractured Wells.  Hydraulic  fracturing  should  always  increase
the  productivity  index  of  a  well;  and,  under  certain  circumstances,  the  hydraulic  fracture  can
increase  the  ultimate  recovery.  Figs.  8.28  and  8.29  illustrate  the  differences  that  sometimes
occur  between  low-permeability  and  high-permeability  reservoirs.  In  Fig.  8.28,  when  a  high-
permeability  well  is  fracture  treated,  the  drainage  volume  and  the  recovery  efficiency  in  the
reservoir are not significantly altered. The fracture treatment increases the flow rate, increases
the  decline  rate,  and  decreases  the  producing  life  of  the  well.  The  ultimate  recovery  is  not
changed.  The  same  reserves  are  recovered  in  a  shorter  period  of  time,  which  reduces  overall
operating costs. Accelerating the recovery of a fixed volume of reserves is often beneficial. If

IV-362

the well is located in the Arctic or offshore in deep water, where operating costs are very high,
then recovering the reserves sooner is very advantageous.

Fig. 8.29 illustrates the normal situation in low-permeability reservoirs. Without a fracture
treatment, most low-permeability wells will flow at low rates and recover only modest volumes
of oil and gas before reaching their economic limit. By definition, a low-permeability well will
not  be  economic  unless  a  successful  fracture  treatment  is  both  designed  and  pumped  into  the
formation.  When  the  stimulation  treatment  is  successful,  the  flow  rate  will  increase,  the  ulti-
mate  recovery  will  increase,  and  the  producing  life  will  be  extended.  In  fact,  many  low-
permeability  wells  will  produce  for  40  or  more  years,  given  adequate  product  prices  and
minimal operating costs. It is usually very easy to justify fracture treatments in low-permeabili-
ty wells when the fracture treatment substantially increases the ultimate recovery.

8.10.3 Post-Fracture  Well-Test  Analyses.    Post-fracture  well-test  analyses  are  used  to  com-
pute  estimates  of  the  propped  fracture  length,  fracture  conductivity,  and  drainage  area  of  the
formation. It is important to keep good records of the flow rates of oil, gas, and water, as well

as the flowing pressures after the fracture treatment. If possible, a pressure-buildup test should
be run after the well cleanup following the fracture treatment. Lee43 presented a complete dis-
cussion on how to analyze production and pressure data after a fracture treatment to estimate

Well Production Problems
Raymond Jasinski, SPE, Schlumberger Ltd. (retired)

9.1 Introduction
Oil, gas, water, steel, and rock are not always chemically inert under oil/gas production condi-
tions.  Their  mutual  interactions,  induced  in  part  by  changes  in  pressure  and  temperature,  can
lead to the accumulation of solids, both organic and inorganic (scaling) within the production
system, as well as deterioration of the metals that the fluids contact (corrosion).

This chapter discusses these effects in terms of root causes, the operational difficulties re-
sulting, and the principles/methods that have been used to cope. Case histories are not present-
ed  in  any  detail,  but  references  are  given  to  specific  papers  dealing  with  cause/effect/cure
examples.  It  is  assumed  that  the  reader  is  not  an  expert  in  things  chemical  but  does  have  a
passing acquaintance with the jargon of chemistry and with some of the general principles un-
derlying chemical processes.

“Well  production  problems”  are  taken  as  starting  when  fluids  enter  the  wellbore  and  end
when fluids reach the storage/treatment facilities. Problems arising from adverse chemistry, oc-
curring  in  the  formation,  are  discussed  elsewhere  in  the  literature.  The  disposal  of  toxic
coproduction  [e.g.,  H2S,  Hg,  and  naturally  occurring  radioactive  materials  (NORM)]  is  men-
tioned briefly in this chapter and is discussed in the chapter on facilities in the Facilities and
Construction  Engineering  section  of  this  Handbook.  This  chapter  also  does  not  treat  the  flow
engineering problems, multiple-phase production problems, and the in-situ measurement/control
problems attendant to producing hydrocarbons.

9.1.1 Hydrocarbon-Related  Problems.    Asphaltenes.    Certain  crude  oils  deposit  solid  as-
phaltenes during production. These deposits may plug the wellbore tubing and valves, as well
as  coat  surface  safety  and  process  control  equipment.1  Asphaltenes  can  accumulate  in  separa-
tors  and  in  pipelines,  a  problem  discussed  elsewhere.  The  tendencies  of  crudes  to  deposit
asphaltenes do not correlate with the quantity of dissolved asphaltenes present in the reservoir
fluid.  Some  oils  with  1%  asphaltene  or  less  will  form  deposits  in  tubulars,  while  others  with
10%  or  more  asphaltenes  will  form  no  deposits.  Asphaltenes  chemistry  varies  with  field.  As-
phaltenes  contained  in  oil  from  a  well  in  the  North  Sea  are  chemically  different  from  as-
phaltenes found in the Venezuela fields, or another North Sea well. The chemistry controlling
these  depositions  is  not  well  defined.  Nevertheless,  some  generalities  are  possible,  which  can
aid in the design of prevention and remediation technology for a given well.

(data from Ref. 2).

Fig. 9.2—A pressure/temperature phase diagram for the stability of asphaltenes in a crude oil.3

Asphaltene  precipitation  as  changing  pressure  and  temperature  is  illustrated  in  Figs.  9.1
and  9.2.  The  first  figure  is  a  plot  of  weight  percent  asphaltene  precipitated  as  a  function  of
pressure  at  reservoir  temperature.  A  plot  of  saturation  level,  rather  than  percent  asphaltene,
gives the same form (data obtained from Ref. 2). The observed general scenario is as follows.
There  is  no  asphaltene  precipitation  on  pressure  reduction  until  a  critical  “onset  pressure”  is
reached—here, nominally 4,500 psi; for the well described in Fig. 9.1, the reservoir pressure is
in excess of 5,000 psi. The total amount deposited increases with decreasing pressure, reaching
a  maximum  at  nominally  the  saturation  pressure.  Asphaltene  deposits  can  then  redissolve  as
pressure falls, at least partially, possibly reaching zero deposition at low pressure (“dissolution
pressure”). Not all crudes will show a dissolution pressure at accessible temperatures.

Fig.  9.2  shows  an  asphaltene  deposition  envelope  (ADE),  a  plot  of  such  onset  pressures
(upper boundary) and dissolution pressures (lower boundary) as a function of temperature, over-
laid  with  a  saturation  pressure/temperature  (PT)  curve.3  The  sense  of  the  ADE  region  is  that
asphaltenes precipitate for PT values between the boundaries. The precipitation problem will be

greater the closer the PT values are to the saturation line (as indicated in Fig. 9.1). A possible
PT route to avoid asphaltene deposition during production is also shown in the figure.

Pressure and temperature changes are not the only drivers for asphaltene deposition. Com-
bining  certain  crudes  can  deposit  asphaltenes  at  the  point  of  mixing  (e.g.,  in  the  wellbore,
flowlines,  headers,  pipelines,  and  oil  treatment  facilities.)  Gas  lift  would  favor  deposition  of
asphaltenes from the heavy oil. ADE diagrams can be drawn for such compositional variations
as well.3,4 Shear effects5 and electrokinetic effects during flow have been claimed as additional
mechanisms for asphaltene precipitation.6 [It is claimed that asphaltenes are electrically charged
and the electrical potential generated by flow of these ions through small orifices (similar chem-
istry  to  electro-osmosis)  can  overcome  charge  stabilization,  causing  flocculation.]  Increases  in
asphaltene problems with water-production onset are generally observed, as is the decrease in
problems  with  larger  water  cuts;  the  definition  of  “large”  varies  with  field.  The  presence  of
other  solids  with  water  in  the  produced  fluid  can  exacerbate  the  consequences  of  asphaltene
precipitation,  generating  a  greater  mass  of  solids  and/or  stable  emulsions.  A  rationale  for  this
exacerbation is shown schematically in Fig. 9.3.7 The surface-active resin/asphaltene aggregates
adsorb with wax and other solids onto water droplets, stabilizing an emulsion that can be suffi-
ciently strong to plug production.

Definition of Asphaltenes.  Asphaltenes are a compound class, not a single compound, con-
centrated  in  the  high-temperature  distillation  residue  of  petroleum  (>  530°C).  Other  compo-
nents are heavy oils, resins, and high-molecular-weight waxes.8 The asphaltene class is defined
in accord with the solubility sequence illustrated in Fig. 9.4.

The  quantity,  and  possibly  chemistry,  of  the  asphaltene  mixture  depends  on,  at  least,  the
final  solvent  used  after  the  initial  separation  (e.g.,  n-pentane  vs.  n-heptane).  (Data  are  from
Ref. 9.) An asphaltene mixture using n-C5 as a precipitant will contain more material than an

very small in quantity, compared with those precipitated by n-pentane.

Asphaltene phase separation and deposition in the field generally involve only a portion of
the  asphaltene  fraction  generated  from  the  crude  oil  in  the  laboratory  by  n-C5  fractionation
(nominally  30  to  50%  of  the  asphaltenes  present  are  precipitated).10  An  example  is  shown  in
Fig. 9.5—a plot of the quantity of asphaltene dissolved (as per n-C5 precipitation) vs. pressure
at constant temperature.11

The asphaltene mixtures precipitated by either the n-C5 or n-C7 addition are dark brown to
black, amorphous solids. The resins tend to be lighter in color and less viscous.12 Resins have
H/C ratios ranging from 1.3 to 1.6; asphaltenes range from 1.0 to 1.3. An asphaltene molecule
consists of clusters of condensed aromatic and naphthenic rings. Each cluster contains not more
than  5  to  6  rings,  connected  by  paraffin  linkages,  which  may  also  contain  oxygen  and  sulfur
atoms (as sulfides and disulfides). The resins and asphaltenes contain about half the total nitro-
gen  and  sulfur  in  the  crude  oil.  Nitrogen  atoms  are  present  predominantly  as  primary  amines
and pyridines (bases). It is these nitrogen atoms that can react with stimulation acid, potentially
forming sludges. Oxygen is present predominantly in the form of acidic functional groups (car-

boxylic acids and phenols). These oxygen atoms can form chelants (salts) with iron, potentially
forming sludges. Additional compositional details are given in Ref. 13. An example of an as-
phaltene molecule is given in Fig. 9.6.12

Asphaltene molecules form aggregates with themselves, nominally 35 to 40Å in size, while
remaining  dissolved  in  oil.13  The  specific  nature  of  the  chemical  bonding  between  the
monomer asphaltene molecules within the aggregates has not been well defined, which compli-
cates  anticipation  (computer  simulation)  of  their  deposition  tendencies.  Various  polar  interac-
tions  are  possible  in  principle,  as  well  as  acid-based  interactions  between  the  basic  nitrogen
and acidic carboxyl functions.

The  asphaltene  molecules  and  aggregates  in  a  given  crude  cover  a  range  of  molecular
weights;14  the  smaller-molecular-weight  asphaltenes  are  the  most  polar.12  The  difficulties  in
quantifying asphaltene molecular weight result from the aggregation problem.8,13 For example,
molecular weight ranges of 935 to 16,840 were found for one crude, depending on the instru-
mental techniques used; others have reported ranges of 1,000 to 2,000,000.14

There is ample evidence that resin molecules play a major role in solvating the asphaltenes
in  oil.  Petroleum  resins  are  nominally  C30  compounds  and  are  different  from  nonpetroleum
resins,  which  tend  to  be  a  3-  to  5-membered  condensed  aliphatic  ring  structure.  Fig.  9.7  is  a
depiction of the structure of two resins derived from a crude oil; the aliphatic side chains are
the nonpolar groups; the condensed aromatic rings are the polar groups.15

IV-372

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

“Common wisdom” is that resins attach themselves to the asphaltene aggregates by polar-
group interactions. The nonpolar “tails” of the resin molecules provide compatibility (solvation)
with  the  nonpolar  components  in  crude  oil.  The  concept  that  resins  are  the  sole  solvating  oil
constituents  for  the  asphaltenes  is  an  oversimplification.  Naphthenes  precipitate  less  as-
phaltenes9  than  the  low-carbon-number  paraffins  (solvate  asphaltenes  better  than  paraffins);
xylene  is  used  as  a  solvent  for  asphaltene  removal,  which  is  discussed  later.  Both  classes  of
compounds (naphthenes and aromatics) are present in oil. The amounts vary depending on the
source of the crude.

When  this  bonding  chemistry  between  asphaltene  aggregates  and  the  solvating  entities  in
the  crude  oil  is  disrupted,  the  aggregates  come  out  of  solution  and  flocculate  to  form  larger
particles. These flocs are the source of the operational problems. Only after flocculation occurs
does deposition occur.6 The sequence of forms for the asphaltene during oil production is solu-
ble → colloidal particles → flocculated → deposit.

Modeling Asphaltene Deposition.  Preventing and/or mitigating asphaltene deposition is fa-
cilitated by the availability of the ADE for the particular well. The direct measurement of this
stability  envelope  is  difficult,  tedious,  expensive,  and  not  always  possible,  particularly  with
crudes from old exploratory wells. Computer simulations of asphaltene precipitation tendencies
are an option, whereby the computer takes “key information” about oil composition and asphal-
tene properties in order to generate the stability diagram. A problem in establishing a workable
model is defining the relevant key information in terms of readily measurable oil and asphal-
tene parameters. The model is to specify the operating envelope of pressure; temperature under
which asphaltenes will and will not deposit; how much asphaltene will deposit; how these pa-
rameters vary with liquid composition, particularly in the context of mixing oils from different
reservoirs  and/or  using  gas  lift  to  assist  production;  and  how  to  best  remove  the  asphaltene
deposit (e.g., which solvents will be most effective for a particular asphaltene deposit). Not all
models available specify all of these items.

There are two broad classes of models for asphaltene dissolution and flocculation, variously
labeled as the molecular-thermodynamic approach and thermodynamic-colloidal approach. The
scope, limitations, and details of the concepts underlying these model classes are reviewed in
Refs. 6 and 12.

The thermodynamic-colloidal approach holds that the asphaltene micelles are composed of
an insoluble aromatic core, onto the surface of which resin molecules adsorb, thereby providing
a steric stabilization against their flocculation and precipitation.6,12 Here, the major focus of the
computation is on the resin. The additional solvation, because of other chemical components of
the oil, is nevertheless taken into account in the present versions of such simulators.16

The molecular-thermodynamic approach2,12,17,18 envisions that the asphaltenes are monodis-
persed polymeric entities soluble in the host oil. Conventional polymer theory (e.g., the Flory-
Huggins model) has been used to describe the situation.17,18 The dissolution/deposition process
is taken as reversible. The oil is assigned a solvating power (i.e., the resins are not treated as
unique  entities  but  as  members  of  the  bulk  solvent,  in  which  naphthenes  and  aromatics,  for
example, are also members).

All models require establishing at least four input parameters (two characteristic of the oil
and  two  characteristic  of  the  asphaltene).  One  version  of  the  molecular–thermodynamic  ap-
proach17,18  uses  the  molar  volume  and  solubility  parameter  of  the  solvent  crude  oil  as  a
function of pressure, as well as the molecular weight and solubility parameter of the precipitat-
ing  asphaltene.  Correlations  with  component  class  analysis  (paraffins,  aromatics,  resins,  and
asphaltenes), as well as other measured oil parameters, are often used to generate the four in-
put parameters.16 Model accuracy is improved by calibration to one experimental onset pressure.
Given the uncertainties in asphaltene precipitation chemistry discussed, these computer mod-
els  should  be  validated  by  the  operator  with  comparisons  of  predicted  onset  pressures  with

Chapter 9—Well Production Problems

experimental values for the fields of interest. These models are then best applied to new wells
within the field by applying this correlation.

Coping With Asphaltene Deposition.  The most effective procedure is configuring the pro-
duction  conditions  to  stay  out  of  the  precipitation  envelope  established  for  the  well.  This
involves minimizing pressure drops within the production system—possibly fracturing the for-
mation to minimize drawdown.19 The use of pressure maintenance by water injection might be
appropriate if the field is of sufficient size.10 If prevention cannot be achieved, it may be possi-
ble to move the deposition to a location more easily treated (e.g., at the choke rather than at
the perforations).

Chemical inhibitors can be used to prevent asphaltene precipitation. The inhibitors must be
placed in the oil before asphaltene precipitation has taken place. In completion systems where
capillary (“macaroni”) tubing already exists, a continuous injection of an inhibitor can be used.
Continuous injection of an inhibitor into pipelined crude is straightforward, as well as the injec-
tion of inhibitors immediately before the mixing of asphaltene in incompatible oils. Asphaltene
inhibitors  can  be  squeezed  into  the  formation,  similar  to  inorganic-scale  inhibitors.  However,
because of necessity, these inhibitors are oil soluble, resulting in a short functional lifetime for
the inhibitor.

Asphaltene inhibitors are generally resinous organic polymers.20 Their functional groups in-
teract with the asphaltenes in much the same way natural resins keep the asphaltenes dissolved.
It is claimed that the strength of the interaction is stronger than with natural resins, keeping the
asphaltene dissolved over a broader range of pressure and temperature. Given the variability in
the asphaltene structure, it is important that the polymer inhibitor be evaluated on the specific
crude  in  which  it  will  be  placed.  In  principle,  it  is  possible  that  these  polymers  could  also
cause formation damage by altering the wetting properties of the rock. It is obviously prudent
to evaluate this possibility on core samples before treatment.

Asphaltene deposits are generally removed manually if present in readily accessible equip-
ment,  such  as  separators  and  other  surface  equipment.  For  tubular  and  flowline  deposits,
removal  techniques  involve  chemical  methods  such  as  solvent  soaks  with  or  without  disper-
sants. Combining solvents and heating may also be effective (see the section on wax removal).
Physical methods can be used depending on the hardness of the deposit (e.g., pigging, hydrob-
lasting,  and  drilling).  Pigging  (cutting)  is  appropriate  for  removing  pipeline  deposits—often,
mixtures of waxes and asphaltenes.

The traditional solvent of choice has been xylene. Refs. 12 and 21 describe the use of cer-
tain refinery cuts as solvents for asphaltene deposits—mixtures cheaper and more effective than
xylene.  It  is  to  be  expected,  given  the  variability  of  asphaltene  chemistry  described,  that  the
refinery-solvent mixture will have to be tailored to the specific well—one mixture will not nec-
essarily cure all. A logic for deriving such mixtures is discussed in Ref. 22.

Terpenes (more-expensive natural products) have been used effectively as solvents, replac-
ing xylene because of health, safety, and environment (HSE) considerations. Certain alkylben-
zene  compounds  will  stabilize  (dissolve  or  disperse)  asphaltenes  in  simple  aliphatic  solvents
(e.g., heptane). Also, the highly polar and readily available p- (n-dodecyl) benzenesulfonic acid
is a highly effective compound.23

The prevention-by-well-design scenario, albeit initially potentially expensive, may be more
cost  effective  throughout  the  life  of  the  well  vs.  cleaning/dissolving.  As  with  the  removal  of
inorganic scale, which is discussed later, the costs of the treatments involve not only the chem-
ical itself but the deferred and/or lost oil production attendant to the well’s downtime for the
treatment.  A  methodology  for  asphaltene  control  in  the  field,  including  all  aspects  previously
described, is illustrated in Ref. 19.

Fig. 9.8—Structures of hydrocarbon classes involved in wax deposition.

9.1.2 Waxes.  Many crudes contain dissolved waxes that can precipitate and deposit under the
appropriate environmental conditions. Paraffin wax produced from crude oil consists primarily
of long chain, saturated hydrocarbons (linear alkanes/n-paraffins) with carbon chain lengths of
C18 to C75+, having individual melting points from 40 to 70°C. This wax material is referred to
as  “macrocrystalline  wax.”  Naphthenic  hydrocarbons  (C18  to  C36)  also  deposit  wax,  which  is
referred to as “microcrystalline wax.” Macrocrystalline waxes lead to paraffin problems in pro-
duction  and  transport  operations;  microcrystalline  waxes  contribute  the  most  to  tank-bottom
sludges.24 Fig. 9.8 shows the generic molecular structures of n-paraffins, iso-paraffins, and naph-
thenes.  The  n-heptane  structure  is  an  example  of  a  “normal”  paraffin;  2-methyloctane  is  an
“iso”  paraffin  and  n-butylcyclopentane  is  a  naphthene.  These  specific  n-paraffins  and  naph-
thenes  are  too  small  to  crystallize  as  wax  deposits  (i.e.,  outside  the  carbon-number  range
specified above). The drawings illustrate the type of structures involved.

Waxes  isolated  from  crudes  can  contain  various  amounts  of  all  classes:  n-paraffins,  naph-
thenes,  and  iso-paraffins.  For  example,  waxes  derived  from  several  Venezuelan  crudes24
showed n-paraffin/(cyclo + iso paraffin) ratios ranging from 1.28 to 0.23. The iso-paraffins of
the  2-methyloctane  type  (Fig.  9.8)  are  more  likely  to  be  included  in  a  wax  deposit  than  the
more highly branched alkanes.

A “clean waxy crude” is defined as a crude oil that consists of only hydrocarbons and wax
as the heavy organic constituents. “Regular waxy crudes” contain other heavy organics in addi-
tion  to  the  waxes  (e.g.,  asphaltenes  and  resins).  These  heavy  organics  have  interactions  with
the crude, which can either prevent wax-crystal formation or enhance it.

Phenomenology.  As the temperature of the crude drops below a critical level and/or as the
low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons vaporize, the dissolved waxes begin to form insoluble crys-
tals. The deposition process involves two distinct stages: nucleation and growth. Nucleation is
the forming of paraffin clusters of a critical size (“nuclei”) that are stable in the hydrocarbon
fluid. This insoluble wax itself tends to disperse in the crude.

Wax  deposition  onto  the  production  system  (“growth”)  generally  requires  a  “nucleating
agent,” such as asphaltenes and inorganic solids. The wax deposits vary in consistency from a
soft mush to a hard, brittle material. Paraffin deposits will be harder if longer-chain n-paraffins

Chapter 9—Well Production Problems

IV-375

are present. Paraffin deposits can also contain asphaltenes, resins, gums, fine sand, silt, clays,
salt,  and  water.25  High-molecular-weight  waxes  tend  to  deposit  in  the  higher-temperature  sec-
tions  of  a  well,  while  lower-molecular-weight  fractions  tend  to  deposit  in  lower-temperature
regions. Prior to solidification, the solid wax crystals in the liquid oil change the flow proper-
ties from a Newtonian low viscosity fluid to a very-complex-flow behavior gel with a yield stress.
Coping With Waxes.  The  primary  chemical  parameter  to  establish  is  the  critical  tempera-
ture  at  which  these  wax  nuclei  form—the  “wax  appearance  temperature”  (WAT).  The  WAT
(or “cloud point”) is highly specific to each crude. The WAT value is a function of oil compo-
sition;  cooling  rate  during  measurement;  pressure;  paraffin  concentration;  molecular  mass  of
paraffin molecules; occurrence of nucleating materials such as asphaltenes, formation fines, and
corrosion products; water/oil ratio; and shear environment.26 A variety of experimental methods
have  been  used  to  obtain  this  number.  Among  these  are  differential  scanning  calorimetry
(DSC),  cross  polarization  microscopy  (CPM),  filter  plugging  (FP),  and  Fourier  transform  in-
frared energy scattering (FTIR).

DSC measures the heat released by wax crystallization. CPM exploits the fact that insolu-
ble  wax  crystals  rotate  polarized  light,  but  liquid  hydrocarbons  do  not.  FP  measures  the
increase  in  differential  pressure  across  a  filter,  which  can  be  attributed  to  wax-crystal  forma-
tion.  FTIR  detects  the  cloud  point  by  measuring  the  increase  in  energy  scattering  associated
with wax solidification. Each of these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages. A com-
parison/review of these methods is found in Ref. 27. In testing, cloud points, measured by each
of the four methods, agreed with the average value of all methods within 3 to 5°F.

The second, and more important, question is how well do laboratory-measured cloud points
anticipate WATs found in the field. Measured cloud-point data should only match field results
for wells producing at low shear (high shear rates tend to delay the deposition of waxes). An-
other  inherent  problem  is  that  the  cloud-point  measurement  sees  the  precipitation  of  the  most
insoluble  paraffin,  not  the  mass  of  lower-molecular-weight  paraffins  that  might  contribute  the
major amount of wax deposit. Nevertheless, CPM measurements have been found to correlate
well  with  the  temperature  at  field  deposition,  more  so  than  optical  techniques  that  required  a
greater mass of wax to register a signal.26 A major problem in correlating these measurements
and  simulations  (discussed  later)  with  field  experience  is  the  acquisition  of  good  field  data.27
Illustrative of the state of the art in interpreting these measurements is that closer agreement is
found between stock-tank oil measurements and field experience, even though it is live oil that
is being produced.

An alternative to the measurement of cloud point is its prediction from compositional data
by thermodynamic models. These models can predict cloud point as the temperature at which
the first infinitesimal amount of wax appears, as well as predicting that mass of wax precipitat-
ing  out  of  solution  that,  from  experience,  corresponds  to  field  deposition.28  Models  that  use
detailed n-paraffin composition input data, as obtained from high-pressure gas chromatography,
generally  outperform  models  based  on  less  specific  information  like  compositions  to  C7+  [the
numbers are more generally available in the routine pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) reports].
Simulation of Deposition During Production.  Given the cloud point, what is the propensity
for wax precipitation during the production and, in particular, the pipelining and processing of
the crude? This is the regime of “paraffin deposition models.” These are engineering simulators
used  to  predict  wax  buildup  in  flowing  systems,  taking  into  account  such  parameters  as  heat
transfer, phase behavior of the crude, flow regime, wax deposition kinetics, shear rate, diffusiv-
ity, wall conditions (roughness, coatings, scale), and produced-water/oil ratio. One such model
currently in use is “ParaSim™” (AEA Technology, U.K.). More extensive programs are under
development.29

Prevention/Inhibition.    As  with  other  solids-depositing  problems,  prevention  can  be  more
cost effective than removal. One key to wax-deposition prevention is heat. Electric heaters can

IV-376

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

be employed to raise the crude-oil temperature as it enters the wellbore. The limitations are the
maintenance costs of the heating system and the availability of electrical power. And, as with
the hydrate problem, which is discussed below, maintaining a sufficiently high production level
may  also  keep  the  upper-wellbore  temperature  above  the  WAT.  In  addition,  high  flow  rates
tend to minimize wax adherence to metal surfaces because of the shearing action of the flow-
ing fluid. Insulated pipelines are also an alternative to minimize, if not eliminate, the problem;
costs can be prohibitive for long pipelines.

Wax deposition can be prevented, delayed, or minimized by the use of dispersants or crys-
tal  modifiers.  As  with  asphaltenes,  the  paraffin-wax  characteristics  vary  from  well  to  well.
Thus, chemicals that are effective in one system are not always successful in others, even for
wells within the same reservoir. “For this reason it is of fundamental importance to establish a
good correlation between oil composition and paraffin inhibitors efficiency, leading to an ade-
quate  product  selection  for  each  particular  case,  avoiding  extremely  expensive  and  inefficient
‘trial-and-error’ procedures.”24

Paraffin-crystal  modifiers  are  chemicals  that  interact  with  the  growing  crude-oil  waxes  by
cocrystallizing with the native paraffin waxes in the crude oil that is being treated. These inter-
actions  result  in  the  deformation  of  the  crystal  morphology  of  the  crude-oil  wax.  Once
deformed, these crystals cannot undergo the normal series of aggregation steps. Types of paraffin-
crystal  modifiers  include  maleic  acid  esters,  polymeric  acrylate  and  methacrylate  esters,  and
ethylene vinyl acetate polymers and copolymers.

Dispersants act to keep the wax nuclei from agglomerating. Dispersants are generally surfac-
tants  and  may  also  keep  the  pipe  surface  water  wet,  minimizing  the  tendency  of  the  wax  to
adhere. Some water production is required, of course. High levels of water alone may maintain
the system in a water-wet state. As with scale prevention, a smooth surface tends to decrease
wax adherence. However, the operational problem is to maintain such a surface for an extend-
ed period of time. Various forms of erosion are highly detrimental.

Obviously,  these  inhibitors  must  be  delivered  into  the  crude  oil  at  temperatures  above  the
WAT. This need not cause a problem for surface equipment; it could cause a problem for well-
bore treatment, if the bottomhole temperatures are low.

Removal.  Removal of wax deposits within a wellbore is accomplished by cutting, drilling,
chemical dissolution, or melting—the use of hot oil, hot water, or steam. Of these, the use of
hot oil has been the most popular, normally pumped down the casing and up the tubular. It is
intended that the high temperature of the liquid phase heat and melt the wax, which then dis-
solves  in  the  oil  phase.  Using  the  bottom-up  delivery  approach,  hot  oil  first  reaches  those
waxes most difficult to melt. The higher in the tubular the hot oil proceeds, the lower its tem-
perature becomes, thereby reducing its wax-carrying capacity. Hot oiling can cause permeabili-
ty damage if the fluid containing the melted wax enters the formation.25

Hot water, hot-water/surfactant combinations, and steam are alternatives to hot oiling. Plain
hot-water treatments do not provide the solvency required to remove the wax, hence the use of
surfactants to disperse the wax. The advantage of water is its greater heat capacity.

Chemical generation of heat has also been proposed as a method of melting wax deposits.
One field-tested scheme uses the thermochemical process of reacting two specific nitrogen salt
solutions,  acidic  ammonium  chloride  and  sodium  nitrite;30  an  orgainc  solvent  is  included  to
keep the wax in solution after the system has cooled.

Various aromatic solvents can be used to dissolve the wax. These are generally not heated,
relying solely on the solvency properties of the fluid. As with asphaltene dissolution, o-xylene
has  been  one  of  the  more  effective  solvents  for  waxes;  kerosene  and  diesel  tend  to  be  poor
solvents. However, as with asphaltenes dissolution, one solvent does not necessarily work equal-
ly well on all wax deposits; an example of solvent screening procedures is given in Ref. 31.

Chapter 9—Well Production Problems

Pigging is the primary mechanical method of removing wax buildup from the internal walls
of  pipelines.  The  pig  cuts  the  wax  from  the  pipe  walls;  a  bypass  can  be  set  with  a  variable-
flow pass, allowing the pig to prevent wax buildup in front. Pig sizing can vary, and multiple
pig  runs  with  pigs  of  increasing  size  can  be  used.  For  subsea  pigging,  a  looped  flowline  is
required or a subsea pig launcher for a single flowline. The major uncertainty in this operation
is the wax hardness as it is formed in the pipeline.

Coiled tubing with the appropriate cutters at the end also can be used for wax removal—
the  drawback  for  pipeline  cleaning  being  the  limited  reach  of  the  coiled  tubing.  For  wellbore
cleaning this is obviously less of a problem.

9.1.3 Toxic-Materials Production.  Various toxic materials are coproduced with the hydrocar-
bons. Their removal and disposal will be discussed elsewhere in more detail. A brief overview
is given here.

Hydrogen  sulfide  is  highly  toxic.  If  the  oil  or  gas  is  sour,  there  is  no  alternative  but  to
produce the H2S and, because it generally has minimal economic value, dispose of the gas in a
safe and cost-effective manner. The treatment procedure and treatment location depend on the
concentration of H2S. Caustic scrubbing can be used for the removal of high concentrations.32
Treatment of the low-concentration H2S (nominally < 150 ppm) is made using nonregenerative
chemical  technology  that  is  more  efficient  at  low  H2S  concentrations.  Chlorine  dioxide  and
nitrite ion33,34 are two such low-cost treatment chemicals.

Mercury  is  also  is  a  naturally  occurring  contaminant  found  primarily  in  natural  gas.  As
with hydrogen sulfide, there is little alternative but to produce it and then remove it—generally
at a central treating plant rather than on site. The occurrence of mercury in quantity and loca-
tion is discussed in Ref. 35. Regulations exist restricting the amount present in natural gas for
sale.

NORM, such as radium and radon, are generally not considered a serious well-production
problem. The sources of NORM in oil and gas production are sedimentary rocks.36 Radon gas
and  radium  are  to  be  expected  in  many  formation  waters.  Radium  is  similar  in  chemistry  to
calcium and, particularly, barium. Radium sulfate coprecipitates with barium sulfate and is con-
centrated  in  barite  scale.  The  radioactive  daughter  product,  radon,  is  also  trapped  within  the
barite  deposit.  Coprecipitated  radium  sulfate  can  require  radioactivity  decontamination  proce-
dures  during  scale  removal.  About  30%  of  the  producing  wells  in  the  U.S.  are  contaminated
with  radioactive  salts.  Radioactive  scales  also  are  found  in  oil/gas  fields  in  the  North  Sea,  in
practically all main producing areas of the former Soviet Union, as well as other regions of the
world.37  Radioactive  lead  (Pb210)  has  been  found  in  southern  U.K.  gas  fields  as  metallic  lead
and  lead  sulfide.38  Prevention  of  barite  precipitation  is  preferred  for  minimizing  the  conse-
quences of NORM.36,39

9.2 Water-Related Production Problems
All oil fields under waterdrive, either from waterflood or a natural aquifer, eventually produce
water  along  with  oil.  Even  gas-cap  and  depletion  reservoirs  may  produce  some  water.  This
coproduction of water causes an additional set of problems: corrosion, scale/salts deposition, gas-
hydrate formation, and disposal of the water itself. Water coproduction also tends to exacerbate
hydrocarbon-solids  deposition.  Discussed  first  in  this  section  is  the  gas-hydrate  problem:  the
possibility  of  solids  formation  because  of  the  coproduction  of  water  and  light  ends.  This  is
followed by a discussion of water control: avoiding lifting unnecessary water and disposing of
the water. The final portions of this section deal with inorganic-scale deposition and metal cor-
rosion.

9.2.1 Hydrates.  Natural-gas hydrates are ice-like solids that form when free water and natural
gas combine at high pressure and “low” temperature. This can occur in gas and gas/condensate

Schlumberger, Gas Hydrates Production (January 1998)].

wells, as well as in oil wells. Location and intensity of hydrate accumulations in a well vary
and depend on the operation regime, design, geothermal gradient in the well, fluid composition,
and other factors. Detailed reviews of gas-hydrate chemistry, physics, and oilfield engineering
are found in Refs. 40 and 41.

At the appropriate combinations of temperature, pressure, and low-molecular-weight gases,
water molecules arrange themselves into coplanar 5- or 6-membered rings, which then form three-
dimensional (3D) polyhedra around the gases (tetradecahedrons, dodecahedrons, and hexadeca-
hedrons). These individual polyhedra then combine to form specific crystalline lattices. In these
solids, one volume of water in the hydrate state may “enclathrate” 70 to 300 volumes of gas.
Such  solids  can  be  formed  with  N2,  H2S,  CO2,  C1,  C2,  C3,  and  iso-butane.  Larger  molecules
like  n-butane  and  cyclopentane  require  the  presence  of  some  smaller  molecules.  Natural-gas
hydrates are to be distinguished from the common inorganic-salt hydrates such as CuSO4·5H2O.
A  general  phase  diagram  for  water,  hydrocarbon,  and  solid  hydrate  is  shown  in  Fig.  9.9.
There are essentially five regions: 1) hydrate + gaseous hydrocarbon (+ excess liquid water); 2)
hydrate + liquid hydrocarbon (+ excess liquid water); 3) ice + gaseous hydrocarbon; 4) liquid
water + gaseous hydrocarbon; and 5) liquid water + liquid hydrocarbon.

The temperatures at which gas hydrates form are significantly higher than the temperatures
at which water ice will form. The exact PT values for this equilibrium vary with hydrocarbon-
gas  composition  and  with  the  dissolved  salt  content  in  the  liquid  water  phase.  (This  salt  will
not enter the gas-hydrate crystal structure, but it will control the chemical activity of the water
from  which  the  hydrate  forms.)  Hydrates  can  form  more  readily  (i.e.,  at  higher  temperatures)
from oil than in pure methane.41

Shut-in  gas  wells  are  particularly  prone  to  serious  hydrate  problems  if  the  well  has  been
producing some water. Subsequent equilibration of the tubular and its contents with cold zones
of  the  rock  can  lower  the  temperature  into  the  hydrate-formation  region.  Hydrate  nuclei  form
from the films of water on the tubular walls. The subsequent crystallization can result in large
plugs of hydrate tens or hundreds of meters long.

Hydrate formation also can take place within a shut-in oil well, generating a slurry of solid
that  is  capable  of  accumulating  and  plugging  the  pipe.40  The  logic  is  that  oil  will  dissolve
some  water—generally  small  amounts.  Under  high-temperature/high-pressure  (HT/HP)  condi-
tions,  the  amounts  can  be  5  to  10  mol%  (at  300°F).  The  oil  is  produced  up  the  wellbore,
temperature  falls,  and  liquid  water  comes  out  of  solution,  remaining  in  suspension  as  micro-

droplets. In a static condition, the microdroplets gradually coalesce and precipitate. This liquid
water is saturated with gas so that hydrates can form at the appropriate PT values.

Coping With Hydrate Formation.  The first step in controlling hydrate formation is to under-
stand which pressure and temperature conditions/locations in the specific system are conducive
to gas-hydrate formation. A number of computer simulators are available for this purpose,42–45
usually as adjuncts to more general phase PVT simulators. The models vary in how well they
compute the chemical activity of the water phase, the effect of higher-molecular-weight hydro-
carbons,  and  the  effect  of  hydrate  inhibitors  (see  the  discussion  that  follows).  A  comparative
assessment of models is given in Ref. 46. Fig. 9.10 shows the results of simulations with one
of the models—the line is computed, the dots are experimental points.44 Besides the dissocia-
tion PT points for the hydrate, the information required and derivable from such models is the
amount  of  hydrate  formed,  the  composition  of  all  phases,  and  the  distribution  of  inhibitors
throughout all phases.

The second control step is the comparison of this information with the measured or expect-
ed PT profile within the production system. A method of coping with hydrate formation is then
selected  (e.g.,  producing  the  hydrocarbons  under  conditions  that  avoid  the  hydrate  PT  forma-
tion  zone  or  using  a  suitable  inhibition  method.  The  simulator  should  also  be  capable  of
evaluating the consequences of the inhibitor strategy. An example of adjusting production con-
ditions to avoid hydrate formation is PT curves for producing wet gas at various rates.47

The alternative to production control is the use of inhibitors. These are classified as environ-
mental  inhibitors,  thermodynamic  inhibitors,  and  kinetic  inhibitors.  The  conceptually  simplest
“environmental inhibition” method is to dry the gas before it is cooled—remove the water and
hydrates so they cannot form. This involves adsorption onto, for example, silica gel, or cooling
and condensation, absorption of water into alcohols, or adsorption onto hydroscopic salts.

“Thermodynamic  inhibition”  has  been  the  most  common  method  for  controlling  gas  hy-
drates. There are a number of alternatives: heating the gas, decreasing pressure in the system,
injecting salt solutions, and injecting alcohol or glycol.

One  method  of  providing  heat  to  the  hydrate-formation  zone  is  the  use  of  electrical-resis-
tance  heating  via  cables  connected  to  a  transformer.41  Another  is  placing  the  choke  in  a
sufficiently hot zone of the production system. The injection of salts (primarily CaCl2) reduces
hydrate formation by lowering the chemical activity of water, and by lowering the solubility of
gas in water.

Alternative  four  is  used  more  frequently  now  with  a  transition  from  methanol  to  ethylene
glycols  for  HSE  reasons.  The  general  effect  of  such  inhibitors  is  shown  in  Fig.  9.11  (not  a
total removal of the problem but a shift of the hydrate-formation curve to lower temperatures,
ostensibly outside the PT production regime). It is possible to compute this phase diagram for
gas/water/methanol or the glycols with reasonable accuracy. The major drawback to this inhibi-
tion technique is the large quantity of methanol or glycol required. This impacts both operating
costs and logistics, particularly important for offshore wells and pipelines.48

Such problems have resulted in the search for kinetic hydrate inhibitors49—low-dosage chem-
icals  that,  as  with  asphaltenes,  waxes,  and  inorganic  scales,  prevent  the  growth  of  hydrate
nuclei or prevent the agglomeration of nuclei into large crystals (also called “threshold hydrate
inhibitors”). Ref. 50 describes the field testing of such inhibitors. The compounds were primar-
ily quaternary ammonium salts; polymeric n-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone was particularly effective. The
application of kinetic hydrate inhibitors to black-oil flowlines is described in Ref. 51. The addi-
tive  here  was  a  methanol-based  solution  of  the  polymer  n-vinyl,  n-methyl  acetamide-covinyl
caprolactam  (“VIMA-VCap”).  In  the  example  given,  the  dose  rate  was  low  (0.5  gal/D  in  16
B/D of produced water). Nonpolymeric gas-hydrate inhibitors have been successfully field test-
ed  on  an  offshore  platform  containing  gas  lift  injection  wells,52  and  they  have  been  used  in
long  wet-gas  subsea  pipelines.52  A  novel  gas-hydrate  inhibitor  controlling  hydrate  formation
during startup uses a borate-crosslinked gel system;53 this inhibited gel system ostensibly also
exhibits fracturing-fluid performance equal to that of more conventional borate-gel systems.

Removal of Solid Hydrates.  Solid hydrates are removed with many of the same chemicals
and technology used to inhibit hydrate formation. The simplest method is, if possible, to reduce
pressure above the hydrate plug sufficiently enough to reverse the equilibrium reaction. Addi-
tion of solvents, such as alcohols and glycols, is the most common technique (well completions
will often provide for a methanol-injection line). An example of hydrate-plug removal with coiled-
tubing  jetting  from  a  deepwater  test  well  is  given  in  Ref.  54.  Chemical  heating,  such  as
described for wax removal, has been used.40

9.2.2 Water Control.  The material presented in this section that deals with water control tech-
nology has been abstracted from a recent review of water problems and control technology.55
This review contains the references to the original literature. Water disposal is discussed else-
where.

The Problem.  The  present  worldwide  daily  water  production  from  oil  wells  is  roughly  3
BWPD per barrel of oil. It costs money to lift water and then dispose of it. In a well produc-
ing  oil  with  80%  water  cut,  the  cost  of  handling  water  can  double  normal  lifting  costs.  Yet,
wells with water cuts in excess of 90% may still produce sufficient hydrocarbons to be econom-
ical (e.g., certain wells in the North Sea Shell Expro Brent fields and in the BP-Amoco Forties
fields). “Water control technology” is intended to reduce the costs of producing water.

It  is  not  necessary,  nor  desirable,  to  completely  shut  off  the  coproduced  water.  The  logic
here is the distinction between “good” (necessary) and “bad” (excess) water.55 “Good” water is
that water produced at a rate below the water/oil economic limit (i.e., the oil produced can pay
for the water produced). “Good” water, then, is that water that cannot be shut off without reduc-
ing  oil  production.  The  fractional  water  flow  is  dictated  by  the  natural  mixing  behavior  that
gradually  increases  water/oil  ratio  (WOR).  “Good”  water  is  also  caused  by  converging  flow-
lines  from  the  injector  to  the  producer  wellbore.  Water  breakthrough  on  injection  occurs
initially along the shortest (least resistant) flow path between injector and producer, while oil is
still being swept along other flow paths.

“Bad” water is water produced into the wellbore that produces no oil or insufficient oil to
pay for the cost of handling the water. The remainder of this discussion deals with “bad” water.
Phenomenology.  There is no one mechanism for “bad” water intrusion, and there is no one
technology that will shut off water intrusion. There are 10 basic types of water problems.55 The
first  four  problems,  which  are  listed  next,  are  relatively  easily  controlled;  the  next  two  are
more  difficult  but  control  is  still  feasible.  The  last  four  problems  do  not  lend  themselves  to
simple  and  inexpensive  near-wellbore  solutions  and  require  completion  or  production  changes
as part of the reservoir management strategy (e.g., multilateral wells, sidetracks, coiled-tubing
isolation, and dual completions). Mechanisms for water intrusion are as follows:

• Casing, tubing, or packer leaks.
• Channel flow behind the casing from primary cementing that does not isolate water-bear-

ing zones from the pay zone.

• Moving oil/water contact (OWC).
• Watered-out layer without crossflow—this is a common problem with a multilayer produc-
tion and high-permeability zone isolated with flow barriers (e.g., a shale bed) above and below
the zone. It is shown schematically in Fig. 9.12.55

• Fractures or faults between injector and producer.
• Fractures or faults from a water layer. Water can be produced from fractures that intersect

a deeper water zone.

• Coning or cusping. Coning occurs in a vertical well when there is an OWC near the per-

forations with a relatively high vertical permeability driving high flow rates.

• Edge water from poor areal sweep. Areal permeability anisotropy causes this problem.
• Gravity-segregated layer. In a thick reservoir layer with high-vertical permeability, water,
either  from  an  aquifer  or  injector,  slumps  downward  in  the  permeable  formation  and  sweeps
only the lower part of the reservoir (Fig. 9.13).55

• Watered-out layer with crossflow. This is difficult, if not impossible, to treat.
Effective  water  control  is  generally  predicated  on  knowing  the  position  and  mechanism
(source) of the intruding water. These parameters may be established from direct measurement,
the well’s production logs, and production history.

“Accurate production logs...can show water entry into the wellbore. The tool can determine
flow and holdup for each fluid phase in vertical, deviated and horizontal wells. The addition of

new  optical  and  electrical  sensors  incorporating  local  probe  measurements  and  phase  velocity
measurements have resulted in major improvements in the diagnosis in both complex and sim-
ple  wells  with  three-phase  flow.  Such  advances  in  reliable  and  accurate  production  logging,
particularly in deviated wells with high water cuts represent a major step forward in identifying
and understanding water problem types. A production log can be turned into a multilayer pro-
duction  log  or  a  ‘multilayer  test’  by  measuring  the  production  rate  of  each  layer  at  several
different producing pressures with station measurements positioned between each layer. In this
way, crossflow potential can be measured. Wireline formation pressure measurements such as
those  with  the  MDT  [modular  formation  dynamics  tester]  tool  or  the  repeat  formation  tester
(RFT) tool can show if the layers are in communication. A vertical interference test performed
with  the  MDT  tool  will  show  vertical  permeability  near  the  wellbore.  Log  correlations  can
demonstrate whether extensive shale permeability exists across a field. A production log (spin-
ner) may detect wellbore crossflow during well shut-in.”55

Production history can be used in a number of ways. First, there is the “recovery plot”: a
semilog plot of WOR vs. cumulative production, allowing extrapolation to the WOR economic
limit (where producing water equals the value of the oil produced). If extrapolated production
is approximately equal to the expected reserves, the well is producing acceptable (“good”) wa-
ter  and  no  water  control  is  necessary.  Next,  there  is  the  production  history  itself—a  log/log
plot  of  oil/water  rates  vs.  time.  Good  candidates  for  water  control  show  an  increase  in  water
production and a decrease in oil production at about the same time. Also, there is the decline-

Chapter 9—Well Production Problems

curve  analysis:  a  semilog  plot  of  oil  production  vs.  cumulative  oil.  A  sudden  increase  in
decline may indicate a water problem or severe pressure depletion caused by damage buildup.
And finally, there are diagnostic plots: log/log plots of WOR vs. time. Three basic signatures
(patterns) distinguish between different water-breakthrough mechanisms (Fig. 9.14).55

Shut-in and choke-back analysis of the fluctuating WOR data can, sometimes, provide clues
to  the  problem  type.  Water-entry  problems  such  as  coning  or  a  single  fracture  intersecting  a
deeper water layer will lead to a lower WOR during choke-back or shut-in. Fractures or a fault
intersecting an overlying water layer have the opposite effect.

Injector Problems.  There can be additional problems associated with the injector well—pri-
marily  because  of  unplanned  and  uncontrolled  fracturing  of  the  receiving  reservoir.  One
mechanism  arises  from  the  buildup  of  solids  because  of,  for  example,  filtration,  bacterial  ac-
tion,  scale  buildup,  or  changes  in  reservoir  wettability.  Pressure  is  increased  to  maintain
injectivity and fracturing may occur. Thermal fracturing is often encountered offshore because
of the stress reduction in the injection zone from cool-down. The zone with the highest injectiv-
ity  cools  down  first  and  fractures,  taking  even  more  injection  fluid—hence,  poor  sweep
efficiency. One strategy to control this problem is to deliberately fracture all receiving zones,
increasing sweep efficiency.

Coping With Water Production.  Mechanical  or  inflatable  plugs  are  often  the  solution  of
choice  for  the  near-wellbore  problems:  casing  leaks,  flow  behind  casing,  rising  bottom  water,
and  watered-out  layers  without  crossflow.  These  plugs  can  be  deployed  on  coiled  tubing  or
wireline  to  ensure  shutoff  in  cased  and  openhole  environments.  When  the  wellbore  must  be
kept open to levels deeper than the water entry, a through-tubing patch may be deployed inside
the casing. One technology involves placing a flexible, inflatable composite cylinder made of,
for  example,  carbon  fiber,  thermosetting  plastics,  and  a  rubber  skin  opposite  the  area  to  be
treated. A pump then inflates the sleeve and injects well fluid, which heats the resins, turning
on the polymerization process. After the resins have set, the sleeve is deflated and extracted.

Rigid  gels  are  highly  effective  for  near-wellbore  shutoff  of  excess  water.  Unlike  cement,
gels can be squeezed into the target formation to give complete shutoff of that zone or to reach
shale  barriers.  They  have  operational  advantages  over  cement  treatments  because  they  can  be
jetted rather than drilled out of the wellbore. Commercial gels can be bullheaded into the for-
mation to treat problems such as flow behind casing and watered-out layers without crossflow,
or they can be selectively placed in the water zones using coiled tubing and a packer.

Certain  crosslinked  polymers  can  also  have  long  working  times  before  becoming  rigid.
They are injected into small faults or fractures but only penetrate formations with permeabili-
ties greater than 5 darcy. Large volumes (1,000 to 10,000 bbl) of these inexpensive fluids often
successfully  shut  off  extensive  fracture  systems  surrounding  waterflood  injector  or  producing
wells.

Gel treatments are not generally successful for combating coning/cusping problems for pro-
longed times because they require very large volumes to be effective. An alternative is to drill
one  or  more  lateral  drainholes  near  the  top  of  the  formation  to  take  advantage  of  the  greater
distance  from  the  OWC  and  decreased  drawdown.  Another  approach  is  a  dual  drain
(Fig. 9.15).55

Gel treatments are also not likely to work on the “gravity-segregated-layer” problem. Later-
al  drainholes  may  be  effective  in  accessing  the  unswept  oil.  Infill  drilling  is  often  the  best
approach to improving the areal sweep efficiency edgewater problem. A large, likely uneconom-
ic  treatment  of  gel  would  be  required  to  divert  the  injected  water  away  from  the  pore  space
that has already been swept by water.

Treatments  for  water  problems  in  horizontal  wells  are  most  effective  when  the  treatment
zone is isolated from the remainder of the wellbore. In cased holes, this is achieved mechanical-
ly  with  packers.  However,  when  a  screen  or  liner  has  been  run  but  left  uncemented,  such

very rapid breakthrough [e.g., through a fault, fracture, channel behind casing (top)]. Edgewater flow
(middle) generally shows a rapid increase at breakthrough, followed by a straight-line curve. A gradual
increase in water (bottom) indicates the buildup of a water cone early in the well’s life (The WOR′ curves
are the time derivatives of the WOR plots.) (after Bailey55).

mechanical devices are not effective in isolating the open annular space behind the pipe. One
product developed for such situations is the annular chemical packer (Fig. 9.16).

Chapter 9—Well Production Problems

IV-385

Fig. 9.15—The coning problem is on the left; perforating the water leg eliminates the coning (middle).
Alternatively, the water can be coproduced separately through tubing and annulus (after Bailey55).

Fig. 9.16—This technology involves placement of a cement-based fluid into the annular space between
an uncemented liner and the formation. The fluid is conveyed into the treatment zone using coiled tubing
and injected between an inflatable packer assembly to fill the annulus over a selected interval. It is de-
signed to sit in this position forming a permanent, impermeable, high-strength plug, fully isolating the
volume of the annulus (after Schlumberger Oilfield Review).

Proactive  water  control  includes  choking  back  zones  with  high  permeability  to  create  a
more uniform sweep. This means sacrificing early cash flow for an uncertain return because of
incomplete knowledge of heterogeneity. The production (and injection) profile can be improved
through selective stimulation of zones with lower permeability. Coiled tubing is used to precise-
ly place these small hydraulic fractures.

Disposal.  Whether water production is minimized or not, some water (e.g., “good” water)
will  be  produced  and  must  be  disposed.  To  minimize  costs,  the  water  should  be  removed  as
early as possible (e.g., with a downhole separator if possible); see Fig. 9.17.55 The method for
disposal at the surface will be discussed elsewhere.

9.2.3 Inorganic-Scale  Formation.    Wells  producing  water  are  likely  to  develop  deposits  of
inorganic  scales.  Scales  can  and  do  coat  perforations,  casing,  production  tubulars,  valves,
pumps and downhole completion equipment, such as safety equipment and gas lift mandrels. If

IV-386

water to be separated and injected into another formation (after Bailey55).

allowed to proceed, this scaling will limit production, eventually requiring abandonment of the
well.  Technology  is  available  for  removing  scale  from  tubing,  flowline,  valving,  and  surface
equipment, restoring at least some of the lost production level. Technology also exists for pre-
venting the occurrence or reoccurrence of the scale, at least on a temporary basis. “Temporary”
is  generally  3  to  12  months  per  treatment  with  conventional  inhibitor  “squeeze”  technology,
increasing to 24 or 48 months with combined fracture/inhibition methods. (See the discussion
that follows.)

Phenomenology.  As brine, oil, and/or gas proceed from the formation to the surface, pres-
sure  and  temperature  change  and  certain  dissolved  salts  can  precipitate.  This  is  called  “self-
scaling.” If a brine is injected into the formation to maintain pressure and sweep the oil to the
producing wells, there will eventually be a commingling with the formation water. Additional
salts  may  precipitate  in  the  formation  or  in  the  wellbore  (scale  from  “incompatible  waters”).
The chemical formulae and mineral names for most oilfield scales are shown in Table 9.1.

The most common oilfield scales are calcite, barite, celestite, anhydrite, gypsum, iron sul-
fide,  and  halite.  “Exotic”  scales  such  as  calcium  fluorite,  zinc  sulfide,  and  lead  sulfide  are
sometimes found with HT/HP wells. Many of these scaling processes can and do occur simulta-
neously.  Scales  tend  to  be  mixtures.56  For  example,  strontium  sulfate  is  frequently  found
precipitated together with barium sulfate.

Calcite  deposition  is  generally  a  self-scaling  process.  The  main  driver  for  its  formation  is
the  loss  of  CO2  from  the  water  to  the  hydrocarbon  phase(s)  as  pressure  falls.  This  removes
carbonic acid from the water phase, which had kept the basic calcite dissolved. Calcite solubili-
ty also decreases with decreasing temperature (at constant CO2 partial pressure).

Halite scaling is also a self-scaling process. The drivers are falling temperature and evapora-
tion.  Halite  solubility  in  water  decreases  with  decreasing  temperature,  favoring  halite  dropout

Chapter 9—Well Production Problems

IV-387

during the production of high-total-dissolved solids brines to the surface. (Falling pressure has
a much smaller effect on decreasing halite solubility.) Evaporative loss of liquid water is gener-
ally  the  result  of  gas  breakout  from  undersaturated  condensate  and  oil  wells,  as  well  as  the
expansion of gas in gas wells. This increase in water vapor can leave behind insufficient liquid
water  to  maintain  halite  solubility  in  the  coproduced  brine  phase.  Halite  self-scaling  is  found
with  both  high-temperature  and  low-temperature  wells  [e.g.,  with  125  and  350°F  bottomhole
temperature (BHT) gas/gas condensate wells].

Barite scales are generally the result of mixing incompatible waters. For example, seawater
is often injected into offshore reservoirs for pressure maintenance. Seawater has a high-sulfate
content;  formation  waters  often  have  high-barium  contents.  Mixing  these  waters  results  in
barite  deposition.  If  this  mixing/precipitation  occurs  within  the  reservoir  far  removed  from  a
vertical wellbore, there will generally be little impact on the production of hydrocarbons. Mixing/
precipitation near or within the wellbore will have a significant impact on production. Mixing
of incompatible waters within the sandpack of a hydraulically fractured well can also be detri-
mental  to  production.  Furthermore,  after  the  initial,  large  deposition  of  scale,  this  water
continues to be saturated in barite and additional barite scale will continue to form in the well-
bore as pressure and temperature fall.

Waterfloods combining ground waters with high calcium and high sulfate contents can de-
posit anhydrite or gypsum by much the same “incompatible waters” mechanism discussed for
barite. However, calcium sulfate scale solubility, unlike that of barite scale, actually increases
with decreasing temperature (until about 40°C). This can decrease the likelihood of scale after
the  initial  mixing  deposition.  The  reversal  in  solubility  falloff  below  40°C  accounts  for  the
gypsum  scaling  observed  in  surface  equipment.  This  inverse  temperature  effect  can  result  in
the generation of anhydrite scale when injecting seawater. Anhydrite solubility falls as pressure
falls; data could not be found for gypsum solubility vs. pressure.

Iron  sulfide  scales  are  almost  ubiquitous  when  hydrogen  sulfide  is  produced—frequently
the result of tubular corrosion in the presence of H2S. A review of the iron sulfide chemistry
and  phases  occurring  in  production  equipment  is  contained  in  Refs.  57  and  58.  Suffice  it  to
say, the chemistry is complicated; more than one iron sulfide phase can be present. The physi-
cal properties of the phases vary (sometimes dense, sometimes not), and the phase composition
can change with time.

These  multistep  scale/water  chemistries  can  be  simulated  with  present  day  computer  soft-
ware.  Some  of  the  programs  are  commercial;  some  operators  have  their  own  in-house  pro-
grams. In effect, the code sets up a series of equilibrium equations for each possible scale and

IV-388

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

solution ion/ion reaction, as well as solution-gas reaction, then solves them simultaneously as a
function  of  input  pressure,  temperature,  gas  composition,  and  water-phase  composition.  These
are  referred  to  as  “thermodynamic  models.”  As  of  2001,  the  software  had  not  yet  reached  a
level of sophistication sufficient to say, reliably, how fast these solids can form during produc-
tion. This has resulted in a series of “rules-of-thumb,” correlating an operator’s field experience
with  the  thermodynamic  simulator’s  output.  Such  rules  of  thumb  are  much  less  necessary  for
formation scaling, particularly if the mineral is naturally present in the formation (e.g., calcite).
Computer simulation of scaling tendencies for produced oilfield brines has found considerable
acceptance and application. Examples of this technology, applied to halite and calcite scaling in
HT/HP wells, are in Refs. 59 and 60.

Scaling Economics.  Scale remediation and prevention come at a cost, and a major theme
in  the  oil  patch  has  always  been  to  “cut  costs.”  It  is  becoming  more  appropriate  to  think  of
scale control in terms of “value added”—obviating the consequences of not remediating or pre-
venting  scale  formation,  and  so  increasing  the  total  revenue  from  a  well,  as  well  as  possibly
extending  its  lifetime.61  The  effects  of  scale  can  be  quite  expensive  and  rapid.  In  one  North
Sea  well  (Miller  field),  production  fell  from  30,000  B/D  to  zero  in  just  24  hours  because  of
scaling. The cost for cleaning out the single well and putting it back on production was approx-
imately  the  same  as  the  chemical  costs  to  treat  the  entire  field.62  While  not  all  wells  are
susceptible  to  such  momentous  penalties  for  allowing  scaling  to  initiate,  there  is  no  question
that  scale  formation,  remediation,  and  prevention  have  associated  costs.  The  cost  savings  be-
cause of less deferred/lost oil can result in substantially increased revenue over the life of the
well, as well as more oil.61

It  is  anticipated  that  oilfield  scaling  problems  will  continue  to  worsen  and  become  more
expensive.63  The  new  drivers  are  the  tendencies  to  longer  tiebacks;  the  use  of  smart  wells
(integrity  more  critical);  more  gas  production  (gas-well  formations  tend  to  be  more  delicate);
the need to use greener chemicals; and the increasing large amounts of produced water.

Coping With Scale Production.  Scale control has tended to be reactive rather than proac-
tive. There are a variety of methods of removing the effects of scale on production. The first
step is to determine which scales are forming and where they are forming. Some of this infor-
mation can be reliably inferred from the computer simulation procedures discussed, particularly
for self-scaling processes. The simplest method of physically detecting scale in the wellbore is
to run calipers down the wellbore and measure decreases in the tubing inner diameter. Gamma
ray log interpretation has been used to indicate barium sulfate scale because naturally radioac-
tive  radium  (Ra226)  precipitates  as  an  insoluble  sulfate  with  this  scale.  An  example  of  this
technology  is  shown  in  Fig.  9.18.  Visual  observation  with  the  appropriate  wireline  tools  has
also been used to show the presence of calcite and halite solids within the wellbore.

The onset of water production coinciding with simultaneous reduction in oil production is a
sign  of  potential  scale  problems.  It  is  quite  possible,  particularly  with  gas  wells,  to  produce
water  below  the  limit  of  detection  of  surface  analysis  (nominally  1  or  2%).  This  water  will
evaporate  and  leave  its  dissolved  solids  behind,  as  scale.  Because  the  amounts  of  water  are
small, the amounts of solids per unit volume of water will be small, but the solids will accumu-
late with time. The same idea applies to the appearance at the surface of liquid “fresh” water
when  the  reservoir  brine  is  known  to  be  brackish.  This  can  be  condensed  water  because  of
falling temperature. When a few percent of liquid water is produced, it is prudent to track the
dissolved ion content with time. Injection-water breakthrough is generally signaled by dramatic
changes  in  the  concentrations  of  scaling  ions,  such  as  barium  or  sulfate,  which  coincide  with
reduced oil production.

Early  warning  of  scaling  conditions  downhole  would  be  valuable.  Wells  with  intelligent
completions  and  permanent  monitoring  systems  are  being  designed  to  contain  scale  sensors.
The function of the scale sensor is double duty—not only to provide early warning about the

initiation  of  production  impairment  by  scale  generation  but  also  to  provide  information  about
possible impairment of the smart-well sensors and valves by films of scale.

Scale remediation techniques must be quick and nondamaging to the wellbore, tubing, and
the reservoir. If the scale is in the wellbore, it can be removed mechanically or dissolved chem-
ically. Selecting the best scale-removal technique for a particular well depends on knowing the
type  and  quantity  of  scale,  its  physical  composition,  and  its  texture.  Mechanical  methods  are
among the most successful methods of scale removal in tubulars. When pulling costs are low
(e.g., readily accessible and shallow land locations), often the least expensive approach to scal-
ing is to pull the tubing and drillout the scale deposit.

Scales  are  generally  brittle.  One  of  the  earliest  methods  used  to  break  off  the  thin  brittle
scale from pipes was explosives: a strand or two of detonation cord (“string shot”) placed with
an electronic detonation cap at the appropriate location in the wellbore, most effectively at the
perforations. Thicker scales require more stringent means. Impact bits and milling technologies
have  been  developed  to  run  on  coiled  tubing  inside  tubulars  using  a  variety  of  chipping  bits
and milling configurations. Such scale-removal rates are generally in the range of 5 to 30 lin-
ear ft/hr of milling.64

An alternative to milling and drilling is jetting.64 Fluid jetting systems have been available
for many years to remove scales in production tubing and perforations. These tools can be used
with chemical washes to attack soluble deposits where placement is critical. Water jetting can
be  effective  on  soft  scale,  such  as  halite,  but  is  less  effective  on  some  forms  of  medium  to
hard scales such as calcite and barite. The use of abrasive slurries greatly improves the ability
of jets to cut through scale but can damage the steel tubulars and valves.

“Sterling beads” is an alternative abrasive material for scale removal by jetting.64 This mate-
rial matches the erosive performance of sand on hard, brittle scales, while being 20 times less
erosive of steel. Sterling beads do not damage the well if prolonged jetting occurs in one spot.
The beads are soluble in acid and have no known toxicity, simplifying use and cleanup. Hard
scales, such as barite, are removed at rates > 100 ft/hr. This tool is capable of descaling config-

urations  other  than  wellbore  tubing  (e.g.,  removing  hard  barite  scale  deposits  on  two  gas  lift
valves in a multiple-mandrel gas lift completion).

Dissolution.  Chemical dissolution of certain wellbore scales is generally relatively inexpen-
sive  and  is  used  when  mechanical  removal  methods  are  ineffective  or  costly.  Carbonate
minerals are highly soluble in hydrochloric acid; therefore, they can easily be dissolved. Bull-
headed “acid washes” are commonly used to remove calcite accumulations within the wellbore.
Sulfate  scale  is  more  difficult  to  remove  from  the  wellbore  because  the  scale  has  a  low
solubility in acid. Chelants (scale dissolvers) have a high thermodynamic driving force for dis-
solving  sulfate  scales  such  as  barite,  isolating  and  locking  up  the  scale  metallic  ions  within
their closed cage-like structures (Fig. 9.19). These chemicals are successful at removing films
of  sulfate  scale  from  the  wellbore.  However,  they  are  slow  in  dissolving  the  larger  particle-
sized wellbore scales and plugs—the reaction rates are surface-area limited; treatments are time-
consuming, thus expensive.

Iron sulfides are soluble in hydrochloric acid. Many HCl corrosion inhibitors are also effec-
tive in inhibiting the iron sulfide from dissolution, as well as the tubular steel. There are now
exceptions: inhibitors that protect the steel and not the scale, as well as being compatible with
scavengers for the toxic hydrogen sulfide that is generated.65

For  halite,  dilution  with  low-salinity  water  is  sufficient  to  prevent  its  accumulation  in  the
wellbore  and  to  dissolve  halite  that  may  have  accumulated  in  the  wellbore.  This  requires  a
source  of  fresh  or  brine-treated  water  to  help  prevent  other  scaling  problems,  which  can  be
expensive.  A  case  in  point  is  the  use  of  a  desulfation  plant  to  remove  sulfate  ion  from  the
halite wash water for the Heron field production.66

Some  scales  and  scaling  situations  are  “chemically  difficult.”  Fluorite  scale,  found  with
some HT/HP brines, has no known solvent (as of the date of this writing). Access of the scale-
dissolver chemical to the inorganic scale can be blocked by organic deposits (e.g., asphaltenes).
Inhibition.  Inhibitors are typically used after remediation to prevent further scaling. Obvi-
ously, this same technology can be used to do pre-emptive scale control. The effectiveness of
inhibition is related to the degree of scale supersaturation—the higher this value, the more diffi-

acid (HEDP) and diethylenetriaminepenta (methylenephosphonic) acid (DTPMP)].

cult it is to inhibit. For example, barite solutions with saturation indices > 350 are particularly
difficult to inhibit.

Scale  precipitation  can  be  avoided  by  chelating  the  scaling  cation.  This  is  costly  because
the  reactions  are  “stoichiometric,”  (e.g.,  one  chelant  molecule  per  one  scaling  cation).  More
effective are chemicals that poison the growth of scale. These are “threshold” inhibitors, effec-
tively  inhibiting  mineral  scale  growth  at  concentrations  of  1,000  times  less  than  a  balanced
stoichiometric ratio. Most inhibitors for inorganic scales are phosphorous compounds: inorganic
polyphosphates, organic phosphate esters, organic phosphonates, organic aminophosphates, and
organic  polymers.  A  variety  of  such  chemicals  is  well-known,  and  they  are  available  from
many companies. Two chemical structures are shown in Fig. 9.20. These are used for the vari-
ous carbonate and sulfate scales. Recently, the successful use of a nonphosphorus compound to
inhibit halite precipitation has been described and field tested at moderate temperatures;67 more
classical amine-based halite salt inhibitors are also available for halite inhibition.68

Delivering  the  inhibiting  solution  to  the  scaling  brine  in  the  tubular  has  been  done  by  a
number  of  means:  continuous  injection  into  the  wellbore  via  a  “macaroni  string”  (a  narrow-
diameter  tubing  reaching  to  the  perforations);  injection  into  a  gas  lift  system;69  and  slow
dissolution  of  an  insoluble  inhibitor  placed  in  the  rat  hole.70,71  These  delivery  methods  are
straightforward to implement but not necessarily without problems. For example, gas injection
requires the inhibitor solution to be atomized properly and not to deposit subsequently on the
tubular walls immediately adjacent to the injection point;72 narrow tubing can plug.

The most frequently used method of delivering the inhibiting solution to the scaling brine
has been the “inhibitor squeeze.” Here an inhibitor-containing solution is forced into the forma-
tion,  whereby  the  inhibitor  then  resides  on  the  rock  surface,  slowly  leaching  back  into  the
produced-water phase at or above the critical concentration needed to prevent scaling [the mini-
mum  inhibitor  concentration  (MIC)].  It  is  intended  that  the  released  inhibitor  protect  the
tubulars, as well as the near wellbore. It is required, obviously, that the inhibitor adsorb on the
formation  rock  with  sufficient  capacity  to  provide  “long-term”  protection.  It  is  also  required
that the inhibitor be relatively stable to thermal degradation under downhole conditions and be
compatible  in  the  particular  brine  system.  And  it  is  also  required  that  the  inhibitor  treatment
not cause a significant permeability reduction and reduced production (see discussion that fol-
lows). These requirements are generally achievable, but again, one chemical does not necessari-
ly fit all field situations.73

IV-392

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Two  types  of  inhibitor  squeeze  treatments  are  routinely  carried  out  where  the  intention  is
either  to  adsorb  the  inhibitor  onto  the  rock  by  a  physico-chemical  process  —an  “adsorption
squeeze”—or  to  precipitate  (or  phase  separate)  the  inhibitor  within  the  formation  pore  space
onto the rock surfaces—a “precipitation squeeze.”

Adsorption of inhibitors is thought to occur through electrostatic and van der Waals interac-
tions  between  the  inhibitor  and  formation  minerals.  The  interaction  may  be  described  by  an
adsorption  isotherm,  which  is  a  function  of  pH,  temperature,  and  mineral  substrate  and  in-
volves cations such as Ca+2. The adsorption process for retaining inhibitor in the formation is
most effective in sandstone formations. Treatment lifetimes are generally on the order of 3 to 6
months.

The “precipitation squeeze” process is based on the formation of an insoluble inhibitor/cal-
cium salt. This is carried out by adjusting the calcium ion concentration, pH, and temperature
of  polymeric  and  phosphonate  inhibitor  solutions.  Also  used  are  calcium  salts  of  phosphino-
polycarboxylic  acid  or  a  polyacrylic  acid  scale  inhibitor.  The  intent  is  to  place  more  of  the
inhibitor per squeeze, extending the treatment lifetime. Normally, the precipitation squeeze treat-
ment lifetime exceeds one year, even when high water production rates are encountered.

The  engineering  design  of  such  adsorption  and  precipitation  squeeze  treatments  into  real-
world  multilayer  formations  is  generally  done  with  an  appropriate  piece  of  software.  This
simulator  takes  core  flood  data  and  computes  the  proper  pre-flushes,  inhibitor  volumes,  post
flushes, and potential squeeze lifetime. Computer simulation of such chemistry is described in
Refs. 74 and 75.

The sequence of pumping steps involved in squeezing inhibitors is listed next.

• A brine overflush pushes the main treatment to the desired depth in the formation away

• A  shut-in  or  soak  period  (usually  approximately 6  to  24  hours)—the  pumping  stops  and
the inhibitor adsorbs (phosphonate/polymers) or precipitates (polymers) onto the rock substrate.

• The well is brought back to production.
Fig. 9.21  illustrates a  typical inhibitor return  curve  that shows  the  concentration of  an  in-

hibitor dissolved in the water phase as the well is brought back on production.

A  large  amount  of  inhibitor  returns  immediately  after  turning  on  the  well.  This  is  nonad-
sorbed inhibitor or weakly adsorbed inhibitor. It is “wasted” in the sense that it is not available
for use late in the life of the squeeze. This wasted inhibitor does not otherwise impose a seri-
ous financial burden on the treatment—the inhibitors can be the cheapest part of the inhibition
treatment. The plateau (or slowly declining) portion of the return curve is the critical data that
describe the effectiveness of the treatment. As long as the curve is above the MIC, scale depo-
sition  is  not  taking  place  in  the  formation  or  wellbore.  Immediately  below  the  MIC,  scale
formation may start to occur.

amount of inhibitor will maintain the MIC for a shorter period of time than a low rate of water
passing over the same amount of inhibitor.

Scale-inhibitor squeeze treatments can sometimes bring undesirable side effects. These side
effects include: process upsets, poor process and discharged water quality on initial flowback,
extended cleanup period, deferred oil, and the potential for a permanent decrease in oil produc-
tion  combined  with  an  increase  in  water  production.  The  first  three  side  effects  listed  are
functions  primarily  of  the  oil,  brine,  and  squeeze  chemicals.  Most  of  these  problems  can  by
avoided or at least minimized by prior laboratory testing. Deferred oil is an intrinsic problem
in well intervention. The improved production must pay for the deferred oil.

Permanent decreases in production after inhibitor squeeze treatments are usually associated
with pumping large amounts of water-based chemicals into water-sensitive zones, assuming an
otherwise proper treatment design and the use of clean fluids. Clay swelling and in-situ emul-
sions  are  damage  mechanisms;  low  pH-inhibitor  solutions  are  often  detrimental  to  clays,  in
particular  to  chlorites.76  Handling  the  scale  inhibition  of  water-sensitive  reservoirs  is  not  a
solved  problem.  Several  routes  are  being  investigated.  One  solution  is  the  use  of  oil-soluble
inhibitors.77 Another is the use of water-in-oil emulsion (“invert emulsions”), similar to the in-
vert  emulsions  used  for  time-delayed  acidization.  A  third  solution  is  the  use  of  a  mutual
solvent  preflush.78  Here,  the  mutual  solvent  is  the  first  chemical  seen  by  the  sensitive  forma-
tion,  and  it  is  the  last  seen  as  the  well  is  put  back  on  production.  Also  used  are  “clay
stabilizers” in the preflush.79 As of this writing, no single approach solves all problems.

New inhibitor chemistry is also being developed to handle the harsher scaling environments
such as particularly high supersaturated barium sulfate solutions (saturation indices > 350).80 A
case in point is the barite scaling problem in the North Sea Miller field.81 “Harsh” conditions
also include HT/HP reservoirs with severe thermal stability requirements.82,83

Combined Treatments.  Well  intervention  to  place  the  scale  inhibitor  is  particularly  costly
with high-volume wells because of large amounts of deferred oil; intervention at remote loca-
tions (e.g., offshore platforms and subsea completions) adds to the cost. It is often possible to
place  a  scale  inhibitor  as  part  of  the  scale-removal  step,  providing  both  treatments  with  one
setup  and  intervention.  One  of  these  techniques  is  the  inclusion  of  a  scale  inhibitor  with  the

acid stimulation process for dissolving calcite scale.84 The advantages are in cost and in putting
the inhibitor into exactly the same zone opened up by the acid treatment.

A  second  dual-treatment  technique  consists  of  placing  a  scale  inhibitor  along  with  a  hy-
draulic  fracture  stimulation.  Inhibitors  can  be  injected  into  the  pumped  gel/sand  mixture  with
calcium  ion  to  form  a  sufficiently  insoluble  and  immobile  scale-inhibitor  material  within  the
proppant  pack.  DTPMP  acid  (Fig.  9.20)  has  been  used,  as  well  as  polyphosphates.85,86  Other
inhibitor  formulations  can  generate  a  “glaze”  on  the  proppant  pack.64  The  concept  has  been
effective  with  calcite  and  barite  scales.  This  technology  has  been  practiced  since  the  early
1990s  on  the  Alaskan  North  Slope  and,  more  recently,  in  west  Texas;  lifetimes  of  nominally
two years are now claimed.85,64 Shown in Fig. 9.22 are return curves for such a treatment to-
gether with a return curve for a conventional squeeze. Here, lifetime is expressed in terms of
quantity of water protected from scaling. There are also a few important ancillary advantages
to  the  method  greater  than  extended  lifetime—the  well  returns  to  production  faster  because
adsorption time shut-in is not required, and there is little opportunity for changes in the forma-
tion wettability and its attendant problems. The concept is illustrated schematically in Fig. 9.23.
A  newer  dual-treatment  technique  consists  of  deploying  an  inhibitor  impregnated  into
porous  ceramic  proppant  along  with  conventional  proppant  in  hydraulic  fracture  stimulation.87
Upon  production,  any  water  flowing  over  the  surface  of  the  impregnated  proppant  will  cause
dissolution  of  the  scale  inhibitor.  Dry  oil  will  not  release  the  inhibitor  from  the  beads  or  the
insoluble inhibitor. Field examples of this technology are given in Refs. 88 and 89. The advan-
tages  are  similar  to  those  of  the  nonencapsulated  inhibitor/frac  concept  already  discussed  but
with a potentially longer lifetime (e.g., 4 years). This comes at an additional cost that must be
offset  by  savings  in  deferred  oil  and  setup/intervention  costs.88  The  targets  are  high-volume
wells in remote locations, such as the North Sea and deep Gulf of Mexico. Both inhibitor/prop-
pant  techniques  also  protect  the  fracture  itself  from  plugging  with  scale.  This  scaling  occurs
primarily when incompatible waters mix near the wellbore.

9.2.4 Corrosion.    Corrosion  control  in  oil/gas  production  is  reviewed  in  depth  in  Refs.  90
through 92, from which some of the following material is abstracted.

Corrosion Chemistry of Steels.  Iron is inherently (thermodynamically) sufficiently active to
react spontaneously with water (corrosion), generating soluble iron ions and hydrogen gas. The
utility of iron alloys depends on minimizing the corrosion rate. Corrosion of steel is an “electro-
chemical process,” involving the transfer of electrons from iron atoms in the metal to hydrogen
ions or oxygen in water. The corrosion reaction of iron with acid is described by the equation

Fe + 2 H+ = Fe ++ + H2 . ..................................................... (9.1)

This reaction is made up of two individual processes, which are

Fe = Fe ++ + 2 e−........................................................... (9.2)

[the generation of soluble iron and electrons (this is the “anodic” process—the oxidation of the
metal)] and

2 H+ + 2 e− = H2........................................................... (9.3)

[the consumption of the electrons by acid to generate hydrogen gas (this is a “cathodic” process
—the reduction of protons)].

This separation of the overall corrosion process into two reactions is not an electrochemical
nuance; these processes generally do take place at separate locations on the same piece of met-
al. This separation requires the presence of a medium to complete the electrical circuit between
anode  (site  of  iron  dissolution)  and  cathode  (site  for  corrodant  reduction).  Electrons  travel  in
the  metal  phase,  but  the  ions  involved  in  the  corrosion  process  cannot.  Ions  require  the  pres-
ence of water; hence, corrosion requires the presence of water. This overall process is shown
schematically in Fig. 9.24.92 The space between the anode and cathode may be small or large
depending on a number of factors.

Acid is not the only corrodant possible. Another common cathodic process is the reduction

of oxygen, which is written as

IV-396

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 9.24—A representation of the separation in position of anodic and cathodic corrosion sites (after
Schlumberger Oilfield Review).

O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e− = 2 H2O . .................................................. (9.4)

This reaction can also take place at a location different from that of iron dissolution.

The  other  chemical  constituents  in  the  vicinity  of  the  anodic  sites  determine  the  ultimate
chemical fate of the Fe++ ion, such as the precipitation of iron-containing solids on or near the
corroding surface.

The net rate of corrosion is determined by how fast the corrodant arrives at the iron-atom/
water  interface,  how  much  corrodant  is  present,  the  electrical  potential  (energy)  of  the  corro-
dant  (oxygen  has  a  higher  potential  than  do  protons),  and  the  intrinsic  rate  of  the  cathodic
reactions—electron transfer processes involving protons and oxygen are not instantaneous and
depend on the nature of the solid surface on which they occur.

“How fast the corrodants arrive” has two aspects: mass transport in the corroding fluid and
permeating  surface  barriers  between  the  iron  metal  and  the  water  phase.  Surface  barriers  are
placed barriers, such as paint or plastic coatings, passivating oxide films inherent to the metal
(discussed later), and low-permeability corrosion products (e.g., siderite, as formed in the pres-
ence of certain oils and/or inhibitors).

The Nature of Steels.  Alloying iron with carbon (usually 0.2 to 1%) forms steel (low-alloy
steel)—a far stronger metal than iron, hence, suitable for oilfield use. Other components can be
added to iron to enhance corrosion-resistance properties.

Some of the carbon added is insoluble, forming iron carbide (Fe3C), which accelerates the
cathodic processes necessary for corrosion to take place, accelerating the corrosion rate. One of
the major, ubiquitous impurities in steel is sulfur, and it is a major source of corrosion instabil-
ity.  This  element  is  highly  insoluble  in  iron  and  precipitates  in  the  form  of  insoluble  sulfide
inclusions, in particular MnS and (Mn, Fe)S. These inclusions are generally the sites of pitting
(discussed later).93

Grain  boundaries  are  also  areas  that  are  chemically  active.92  When  iron  solidifies  during
casting, the atoms, which are randomly distributed in the liquid state, arrange themselves in a
crystalline array. This ordering usually begins simultaneously at many points in the liquid, and

Chapter 9—Well Production Problems

IV-397

as  these  blocks  of  crystals  and  grains  meet,  there  is  a  mismatch  in  the  boundaries.  There  are
areas of higher energy. Chemical impurities in the melt tend to accumulate at these grain bound-
aries and are more susceptible to chemical attack than the iron surface itself.

Plain  carbon  steels  are  processed  by  one  of  four  heat  treatments:  annealing,  normalizing,
spherodizing, and quench and tempering. These treatments determine, in part, the physical and
corrosion  properties  of  the  metal.  Annealing  or  normalizing  results  in  greater  corrosion  resis-
tance than spherodizing or quench and tempering. The logic is that these treatments determine,
in large, part of the physical dimensions and distribution of the impurities and inclusions in the
metal.

The corrosion products formed in oxygen-containing water on mild steel are FeOOH, likely
amorphous, and magnetite.94 Below 200°C, these oxides, in the absence of reactive inclusions,
are  protective.  In  the  presence  of  dissolved  CO2,  FeCO3  films  form,  which  can  sometimes  be
protecting (discussed later).

The compositions of corrosion-resistant alloys (CRAs) are chosen to spontaneously generate
surface oxide films that will be stable and impermeable in the presence of the more aggressive
corrodants. In oilfield use, it is also required that these films spontaneously reform if ruptured,
as, for example, during and after erosion by sand or scratching by wireline/caliper tools. CRAs
include the ferrous stainless steels and nonferrous nickel and cobalt alloys. Stainless steels con-
tain  at  least  12%  chromium.  These  alloys  passivate  in  oxidizing  environments  through  the
formation of a thin layer of chromium oxide—containing film on the surface of the alloy. The
crystallinity of this film decreases with increasing Cr content in the steel, becoming more glass-
like  and  more  protective.94  Again,  various  inclusions  can  be  weak  points  in  the  passivating
film. The surfaces of nickel-based CRAs, such as Incoloy 800™, are a passivating nickel fer-
rite (Ni0.8Fe2.2O4).

There are four classes of stainless steels that are based on chemical content, metallurgical
structure, and mechanical properties. These classes are martensitic, ferritic, austenitic, and du-
plex. The manufacturing processes for CRAs are more complex than those producing low-alloy
steels. Stainless steels are less costly than the nickel and cobalt alloys, though they are 1.5 to
20 times more expensive than low-alloy steels.

Oilfield Corrosion.  Oilfield corrosion can be divided into categories.
Corrosion because of oxygen is found with surface equipment and can be found downhole
with the oxygen introduced by waterflooding, pressure maintenance, gas lifting, or completion
and/or workover fluids. It is the major corrodant of offshore platforms, at and below the tide
line. The chemistry of this process follows the equations previously given.

“Sweet”  corrosion  is  generally  characterized  first  by  simple  metal  dissolution  followed  by
pitting. The corrodant is H+, derived from carbonic acid (H2CO3) and the dissolution of CO2 in
the produced brine. The pitting leaves distinctive patterns (e.g., “mesa” corrosion), attributable
to  the  metallurgical  processing  used  in  manufacturing  the  tubing.  “Ringworm”  corrosion  is
caused when welding is not followed by full-length normalizing of the tubular after processing.
Corrosion  inhibitors  and  CRAs  are  effective  in  mitigating  sweet  corrosion.  Naphthenic  acids
and simple organic acids indigenous to crude oil also contribute to corrosion.

“Sour”  corrosion  (H2S)  results  in  the  formation  of  various  insoluble  iron  sulfides  on  the
metal surface. Not only is H2S an acidic corrodant, it also acts as a catalyst for both the anodic
and  cathodic  halves  of  the  corrosion  reaction.  Galvanic  corrosion  (bimetallic  corrosion)  is
caused by the coupling of a corrosive and noncorrosive metal in the presence of a corrodant.
Erosion is yet another category of corrosion. Erosion corrosion is the acceleration of corrosion
because of the abrasion of metal surfaces by particulates (e.g., sand). Finally, there is corrosion
caused by acids—those used to stimulate wells (HCl and HF).

Oilfield  corrosion  can  take  specific  forms:  metal  wastage,  pitting,  crevice  corrosion,  inter-
granular  corrosion,  stress  corrosion  cracking  (SCC),  blistering,  embrittlement,  sulfide  stress

cracking (SSC), and corrosion fatigue. The first five forms involve primarily carbonic acid and/
or dissolved oxygen as corrodants. Items 6 through 8 are induced primarily by H2S.

Corrosive failure by uniform loss of metal is only infrequently seen during the production
of oil and gas. It is, however, the first step in corrosive failure of steels by means of localized
corrosion. A circumstance for severe metal wastage is the pumping of poorly inhibited matrix
stimulation acids.

Pitting is the common failure mode of sweet corrosion and corrosion because of dissolved
oxygen. All passivating/protecting films on steel contain weak spots that will preferentially dis-
solve  and  form  pits.  As  mentioned,  these  areas  are  generally  the  sulfide  inclusions.  Chloride
ion  weakens  the  repassivating  film,  allowing  continued  dissolution.  The  decreasing  pH  within
the pit also enhances continued corrosion. The driver for theses processes is the large cathodic
area  of  the  metal  oxide  surface  vs.  the  small  anodic  pit.  Pitting  is  particularly  dangerous  be-
cause penetration through a tubular can occur relatively fast. Other corrosion mechanisms, such
as SCC, frequently start at pits. Oxygen scavengers are typically used to remove this gas in an
attempt to minimize the pitting problem. However, small amounts may remain (e.g., 20 ppb),
and these can be sufficient to induce corrosion.

Carbonic  acid,  the  driver  for  sweet  corrosion,  is  a  weak  acid.  The  pH  of  the  formation
water  depends  on  the  CO2  partial  pressure,  temperature,  and  alkalinity  (controlled  primarily,
but not exclusively, by the presence or absence of carbonate minerals in the formation). Shown
in  Fig.  9.25,  as  a  function  of  CO2  partial  pressure,  are  computed  pH  values  for  a  seawater
brine (containing 140 ppm alkalinity) and a seawater brine saturated in calcite at 50 and 150°C
(substantially higher alkalinities). For the common case of carbonate-containing reservoirs and
moderate  temperatures,  produced  waters  should  have  pH  values  of  6  or  greater.  Waters  ex-
posed to greater amounts of CO2 in noncarbonate-containing reservoirs can have pH values of
4 or less.

Such corrosion induced by CO2 is a function not only of CO2 partial pressure and tempera-
ture  but  also  of  the  crude  oil.  Crude  oil  contains  surface-active  chemicals—some  oils  contain
more than others. These chemicals (e.g., resins and asphaltenes) can impact the corrosion pro-
cess,  at  least  for  low-alloy  steels.  For  a  fixed  brine  composition,  WOR,  temperature,  and
pressure, corrosion in the presence of some crudes can be negligible, while in the presence of
others, it can be extreme under identical environmental conditions.95,96 Sweet corrosion general-
ly  results  in  the  deposition  of  insoluble  FeCO3  (siderite)  on  the  steel  surface.  It  has  been
suggested  that  this  selectivity  to  oil  composition  relates  to  the  physical  morphology  of  the
FeCO3 corrosion product—a compact, tight film can protect the steel; a loose, poorly adherent
film  does  not.96  An  example  is  shown  in  Fig.  9.26.  The  average  uniform  corrosion  rate  for
steel in Crude B was 0.6 mil/yr; the corrosion rate in Crude E was 26 mil/yr. Many corrosion
inhibitors apparently act by the same mechanism (i.e., the generation of siderite films similar,
and/or more compact than those formed from Crude B).96

Alternatively,  it  has  been  suggested  that  wettability  plays  the  dominant  role,  whereby  the
surface-active  components  in  the  crude  oil  provide  for  a  water-wet  surface  (high  corrosion
rates) or an oil-wet surface (low corrosion rates).97 Regardless of the mechanism, crude oil can
modify the corrosion rate. The penalty for ignoring the effect of crude-oil chemistry is the cost
of overtreating or using more expensive alloys than are required.

A  crevice,  such  as  the  junction  space  under  a  bolt  or  the  physical  junction  of  two  metal
parts, is in effect a pit. Uniform corrosion can initiate (in the presence of a corrodant) within
the crevice and continue, driven by the large cathodic area outside the pit or crevice.

Stress corrosion cracking is intergranular corrosion, but it takes place only when the metal
is under stress and in the presence of a corrodant. The corrodant can be specific—not all corro-
dants  induce  SCC  on  all  alloys.  Metal  wastage  is  generally  small;  SCC  is  often  preceded  by
pitting. High-strength steels are more susceptible to SCC than low-strength alloys. The severity
of intergranular corrosion generally depends on the metallurgical history of the steel. Austenitic
steels (common stainless steels) are particularly susceptible to intergranular attack.

Blistering, as well as embrittlement and sulfide stress cracking, a subclass of SCC, all stem
from the same cause: the presence of H2S in the system and at the metal surface. The roots of

phase to make gas, diffusion into the metal to make gas or embrittle steel, penetration through the metal,
recombining to make gas (a phenomenon also used to measure corrosion) (after Schlumberger Oilfield
Review).

the problem are in the mechanism for the cathodic discharge of hydrogen. The mechanism al-
ready  discussed  for  the  cathodic  portion  of  the  acid-induced  corrosion  process  itself,  involves
two steps.

H+ + e− = H·, ............................................................... (9.5)

and

2 H· = H2 ................................................................ (9.6)

(i.e., the proton is first reduced to a hydrogen atom on the metal surface (H·), followed by the
combination of two hydrogen atoms to yield hydrogen gas). Hydrogen sulfide inhibits the com-
bination of hydrogen atoms (as does arsenic and some other corrosion inhibitors). Accordingly,
the hydrogen atoms can penetrate into the metal where they cause the corrosion problems that
were already listed. This is shown schematically in Fig. 9.27.91

This  hydrogen  entry  into  low-strength  steels  can  result  in  hydrogen  blisters,  if  there  is  a
macroscopic defect in the steel such as an inclusion. Such a void can provide a space for the
hydrogen  atoms  to  form  hydrogen  gas.  Pressure  builds  and  blisters  form  resulting  in  rupture
and leakage.

Embrittlement (hydrogen-induced cracking and hydrogen embrittlement cracking) causes fail-
ure at stresses well below the yield strength. This phenomenon usually occurs only with high-
strength, hard steels, generally those having yield strengths of 90,000 psi or higher. Tubing and
line pipe (electric welded and seamless) are susceptible to this effect. The dominating factor is
the metallurgical structure of the steel relating to its method of manufacture.

SSC cracking failure requires only low concentrations of H2S. The time to failure decreases
as stress increases. Cracking tendency increases as pH decreases. SSC can be thought of in the
same language as that used in describing hydraulic fracturing. There is a critical “stress intensi-
ty  factor”  below  that  at  which  a  fracture  (crack)  will  not  propagate.  This  factor  is  related
linearly  to  tensile  strength.  Some  of  this  problem  has  been  attributed  to  the  effects  of  cold
working on the alloys. Alloys that were stress relieved were found to increase in resistance to
SSC.98

Chapter 9—Well Production Problems

IV-401

Wells  producing  hydrocarbon  liquids,  with  the  hydrogen  sulfide,  are  less  susceptible  to
SSC, pitting, and weight loss. For example, certain Canadian condensate wells have produced
fluids with 40 mol% H2S and 10% CO2 for 30 years without serious corrosion problems. Stabil-
ity is associated with a protective iron sulfide film, wetted by the oil/liquid hydrocarbon. These
wells  also  had  a  BHT  of  90°C;  iron  sulfide  films  are  less  effective  in  preventing  corrosion
above 110°C.

Steels,  repeatedly  stressed  in  a  cyclical  manner,  may  fail  in  time  (corrosion  fatigue).  It  is
required for failure that the stress be above a critical value called the “endurance limit” (nomi-
nally  40  to  60%  less  than  the  tensile  strength).  The  presence  of  a  corrodant  substantially
reduces the fatigue life of a metal. Cyclic stress can be looked upon as a method of accelerat-
ing failure because of the other mechanisms previously described.

Bimetallic corrosion/galvanic corrosion can occur when two metals are coupled (in electri-
cal contact) and a corrodant is present. The more reactive metal corrodes faster, while the less-
reactive  metal  shows  little  or  no  corrosion.  The  more-reactive  metal  cathodically  protects  the
less-reactive  metal  (exploiting  cathodic  protection  to  prevent  corrosion  is  discussed  later).  In
general,  the  total  corrosion  of  the  anodic  material  is  proportional  to  the  exposed  area  of  the
cathodic material. Thus, steel rivets in monel corrode very rapidly, while monel rivets in steel
cause little damage.

Weld-related corrosion is a variant of galvanic corrosion. When a metal is welded, the weld-
ing process can generate a microstructure different from that of the parent metal. As a result,
the  weld  may  be  anodic  vs.  the  parent  metal  and  may  corrode  more  rapidly.  This  corrosion
may take the form of localized metal wastage; if H2S is present, there is SSC cracking of hard
zones in the metal or in the heat-affected zone. Similar problems can arise with electric-resistance-
welded pipe.

Metal wastage in sweet systems is avoided by using weld consumable with a higher alloy
content  than  that  of  the  base  metal;  recourse  is  made  to  laboratory  measurements  to  achieve
the  proper  weld-metal/base-metal  combination.  Welding  procedure  standards  are  available  to
avoid hard zone SSC. Chemical inhibition is also effective in protecting welded pipe.

Coping With Corrosion.  The paths to obviating corrosion problems are conceptually straight-
forward: isolate the metal from the corrodant; employ a metal alloy that is inherently resistant
to corrosion in the corrosive medium; chemically inhibit the corrosion process; move the elec-
trical  potential  of  the  metal  into  a  region  where  the  corrosion  rate  is  infinitesimally  small
(“cathodic  protection”);  or  live  with  the  corrosion  and  replace  the  corroded  component  after
failure.

Isolation is the regime of paints, coatings, and liners. An introduction to the subject is giv-
en in Ref. 92, from which some of the following discussion is abstracted; a detailed discussion
of these subjects is in Ref. 99. For any coating to be effective, it must be sufficiently thick to
completely  isolate  the  item  being  protected  from  the  environment.  Small  holes  in  the  coating
(“holidays”)  result  in  the  rapid  formation  of  pits.  Considerable  care  and  quality  control  is  re-
quired to guarantee the generation of holidays during service.

Organic  coatings,  such  as  asphalt  enamel  and  coal  tar  enamel,  are  used  to  protect  equip-
ment concerned with the handling of oil and gas. Baked thin-film coatings, such as thermoset-
ting  phenolics  and  epoxies  (applied  in  multiple  coats),  can  be  used  to  protect  tubular  goods.
External protection of pipelines frequently involves use of adhesive tapes made of polyethylene
or similar materials. Fusion bonded epoxy has been used successfully to protect a 150-km sea-
water-injection  line  (oxygen  was  the  corrodant,  much  of  which,  but  not  all,  was  removed  by
scavenging chemicals).100

Inorganic  coatings  include  both  sacrificial  coatings,  which  furnish  cathodic  protection  (see
below for mechanism) at small breaks in the coating, and nonsacrificial coatings, which protect
only the substrates actually coated. Sacrificial coatings include galvanizing or coating with oth-

IV-402

er metals anodic to the substrate and heavy suspensions of anodic metals (e.g., zinc particles,
in silicates or organic vehicles). Zinc-silicate coatings (paints) are often used to coat the splash
zone  of  drilling  and  production  platforms.  The  zinc  metal  provides  for  cathodic  protection  of
the steel substrate. Below the water line, the most economical approach to corrosion control is
cathodic  protection  (see  below).  The  pH  of  the  environment  is  important—  highly  basic  or
acidic environments can remove coatings.

Nonsacrificial inorganic coatings include metal platings such as nickel and nonmetallic coat-
ings such as ceramics. Nickel can be applied by electroplating or electroless plating. Ceramic
coatings,  when  properly  applied,  are  highly  effective;  they  are  also  costly  and  fragile.  Other
systems, while not truly coatings, perform the same function (e.g., Portland cement and plastic
liners).  Plastic  liners  have  been  used  for  internal  protection  of  tubing  and  lined  pipe.  Some
liners are sealed into individual joints of pipe and tubing; some are fused into one continuous
close-fitting liner through the entire pipe. Both cement and plastic liners are suitable for water
lines.

The proper application of coatings is, in large part, an art form. Accordingly, it is also not
possible  to  overemphasize  the  need  for  close  inspection  of  the  coating  process,  good  quality
control, and testing that the coating has been complete.

From  a  cost  point  of  view,  low-alloy  steels  are  preferred.  In  certain  cases,  “minor”  alter-
ations in alloy composition can minimize corrosion. For example, L-80 steel with a tempered
martensitic  structure  and  a  chromium  content  >  0.5%  has  been  used  without  problems  in  20-
ppb oxygen-containing environments, while a similar steel with < 0.1% Cr has shown serious
corrosion.101

The choice of using CRAs or chemical means to solve the more severe corrosion problem
comes down to economics (available capital vs. long-term operating costs). Remoteness of op-
eration  becomes  an  important  consideration  in  determining  operating  costs,  as  does  downtime
and deferred/lost oil because of repeated intervention for inhibitor application. Availability and
cost of platform space is a consideration for offshore facilities.

The corrosion-control effectiveness of CRAs depends on the chemical severity of the envi-
ronment.  Crevice  corrosion,  pitting  attack,  and  SCC  are  the  primary  concerns.  The  corrosion
resistance of annealed austenitic stainless steels, such as 304 and 316, is affected by the pres-
ence  of  chlorides  and  temperature;  type  304  is  less  corrosion  resistant  than  type  316.  Both
materials are susceptible to SCC when the temperature is above 150°F. Both alloys are also low-
strength steels. Alloys 654 SMo and AL6XN can be manufactured to higher strengths and are
more resistant to SCC. Austenitic stainless steels are probably the most susceptible of all fer-
rous alloys to pitting.

Martensitic stainless steels have had the widest range of use of any of the available CRAs.
Such steels may be manufactured through heat treatment into tubular products with acceptable
yield  strengths  for  downhole  tubing.  Many  millions  of  feet  of  tubing  type  (grade  L-80)  13Cr
are in corrosive well service; it is considered the material of choice for deep sweet-gas wells
with temperatures less than 150°C. About 35% of the L-80 13Cr usage was for oil wells. The
passivity of 13Cr is destroyed by high chloride levels, particularly at high temperature, which
can lead to pitting and crevice corrosion.

Duplex  stainless  steels  are  high-strength  alloys  achieved  by  means  of  cold  working.  Such
steels are more corrosion resistant than martensitic steels but are similar in resistance to SSC.
Cold-worked  duplex  has  been  used  to  0.3  psi  H2S.  Annealed  duplex  is  more  resistant  to  H2S
and SSC than the cold-worked versions. Annealed duplex line pipe has been used in wet CO2
service (99%) without problems. 22Cr duplex steel has been used where pH2S was between 0.5
and  1  psi.  Such  steels  have  been  used  successfully  in  HT/HP  wells  (e.g.,  350°F  and  14,000
psi), producing no H2S. However the copresence of chloride, stress, and dissolved oxygen can
induce SSC. Wells not exposed to even small amounts of oxygen have operated successfully.102

Chapter 9—Well Production Problems

IV-403

The  material  most  commonly  used  for  sour  service  is  AISI  Type  4130  steel,  modified  by
microalloy additions with a quenched and tempered microstructure (martensite).103 C-110 steel
has been used as casing in North Sea wells (30 to 60 bar CO2 and 30 to 50 millibar H2S).104
An overview of CRAs and their use in sour service is given in Ref. 90.

Nickel and cobalt alloys are used in the most severely corrosive conditions (high pressure,
high  temperature,  and  high  H2S  contents).  C-276,  a  nickel-based  alloy,  can  be  used  to  8,000
psi H2S and 400°F. Nickel alloys have found extensive use in the Mobile Bay fields. They are
less expensive than the cobalt alloy MP35N previously used for such extreme conditions. Nick-
el alloys are also used as weld cladding for wellhead and valve equipment.

As  with  scale  problems,  the  appropriate  addition  of  chemicals  can  often  inhibit  corrosion
problems, including some effects of H2S. The delivery techniques are often the same, but the
inhibition mechanisms and types of chemicals are different.

Neutralizing  inhibitors  reduce  the  hydrogen  ion  in  the  environment.  Typically,  they  are
amines, ammonia, and morpholine. They are effective in weak acid systems but are stoichiomet-
ric  reactants:  one  molecule  equivalent  of  inhibitor  per  molecule  of  acid.  They  have  found
minimal use in the oil field.

Scavenging  inhibitors  are  compounds  that  also  remove  the  corrodant.  Oxygen  scavengers

are commonly used in the oil field (e.g., in removing oxygen during water injection).

The majority of the corrosion inhibitors employed during production form thin barrier lay-
ers between the steel surface and the corroding fluid. The concept is that the organic inhibitor
will strongly adsorb on the metal wall to form a barrier, possibly only a few molecules thick,
which will prevent access to the corrodant and possibly leave the surface oil-wet (further retard-
ing access of the corrodant). The generic name given to these compounds is “filming amines.”
This  name  is  qualitatively  correct  in  that  most  inhibitors  are  indeed  nitrogen-containing,  and
the inhibitor does finally reside on the surface. The specific mechanism can be more complicat-
ed. For example, the inhibitor can interact with the corrosion product to increase its adherence
and to lower its permeability. Such layers are likely to be far thicker than a few molecules.96

Regardless  of  the  specific mechanisms involved, the  inhibitor must  contact the  metal sub-
strate. The general procedures are tubing displacement; displacement from the annulus; continu-
ous  injection;  squeeze  into  the  reservoir  as  liquid  or  gas;  weighed  liquids/capsules/sticks;  and
vapor-phase inhibitors.

The first two batch treatments are operated by pushing the inhibitor-containing fluid across
the face of the production tubulars top-down (Item 1) or bottom-up (Item 2). The inhibitor film
then persists on the metal surface for some period of time ranging from days to months, depend-
ing on the specific environment and materials.

Continuous injection is done if the well completion allows for a “macaroni string” reaching
to the perforations. This technique often includes a simple-to-complicated valving system; it is
to be remembered that valves can plug. Injection through the annulus has also been used.

Inhibitor  squeezing  into  the  formation  is  an  alternative.  Here,  the  mechanism  is  different
than that of scale inhibitor squeezes. The large amount of inhibitor that returns initially is not
wasted but is intended to coat the tubular and production equipment with an adsorbed, persis-
tent  film  of  inhibitor.  The  small  amounts  of  inhibitor  that  subsequently  desorb  from  the
formation are intended to repair holes that are generated in the initial film.

Weighed  liquids/capsules/sticks  are  all  variations  on  the  theme  of  placing  inhibitor  in  the
rathole where it is slowly released into the wellbore fluid, continuously depositing and/or repair-
ing the protective film.

Vapor-phase  corrosion  inhibitors  are  organic  compounds  that  have  a  high  vapor  pressure,
generating volatile corrosion inhibitors (such as some amines) that allow this inhibitor material
to  migrate  to  distant,  and  often  otherwise  inaccessible,  metal  surfaces  within  the  container.
Such  inhibitors  have  been  used  on  the  Trans-Alaska  pipeline  to  protect  low-flow  areas,  dead

IV-404

legs, and the annular space in road casings and contingency equipment. The concept has also
been applied to storage tank protection.105

Filming-amine  inhibitors  are  intended  to  protect  steels  from  the  action  of  “natural”  corro-
dants  in  the  produced  hydrocarbon  and  water  phases.  They  are  generally  not  effective  in
protecting  the  steels  from  the  acids  used  to  stimulate  wells  or  from  the  partially  spent  acids
returning from such treatments. These tasks are accomplished by the inclusion of large dosages
of different inhibiting chemicals with the stimulation acids. Such inhibitor systems are also avail-
able  to  handle  low-alloy  steels  and  CRAs  in  HT/HP  conditions.106  Concern  for  stability  of
CRAs during matrix stimulation of deep hot wells has resulted in the use of organic acids such
as acetic acid and formic acid rather than HCl. Inhibitor systems have been developed for these
chemicals as well.

Cathodic Protection.  This  technology  is  used  to  protect  pipelines,  offshore  platforms,  and
surface  equipment  and  is  discussed  more  fully  in  the  Facilities  and  Construction  Engineering
section  of  this  Handbook.  As  previously  discussed,  corrosion  is  an  electrochemical  process:
iron atoms give up electrons; the electrons flow through the metal to the corrodant; ion move-
ment in the water film contacting both corrodant and iron metal completes the electrical circuit.
In certain important cases, it is possible to reverse this current flow out of the steel surface by
the  application  of  an  external  power  supply  (i.e.,  make  the  surface  to  be  protected  cathodic
rather than anodic). The technology involved in employing cathodic protection must take into
account  the  quantity  of  current  required;  composition  and  configuration  of  the  impressed  cur-
rent anode; resistivity of the corroding medium; size of the item being protected; accessibility
of the surface being protected; and length of the item being protected.

Artificial Lift Selection
James F. Lea, U. of Oklahoma

10.1 Introduction
Artificial lift is a method used to lower the producing bottomhole pressure (BHP) on the forma-
tion  to  obtain  a  higher  production  rate  from  the  well.  This  can  be  done  with  a  positive-
displacement  downhole  pump,  such  as  a  beam  pump  or  a  progressive  cavity  pump  (PCP),  to
lower the flowing pressure at the pump intake. It also can be done with a downhole centrifugal
pump, which could be a part of an electrical submersible pump (ESP) system. A lower bottom-
hole flowing pressure and higher flow rate can be achieved with gas lift in which the density
of  the  fluid  in  the  tubing  is  lowered  and  expanding  gas  helps  to  lift  the  fluids.  Artificial  lift
can be used to generate flow from a well in which no flow is occurring or used to increase the
flow from a well to produce at a higher rate. Most oil wells require artificial lift at some point
in  the  life  of  the  field,  and  many  gas  wells  benefit  from  artificial  lift  to  take  liquids  off  the
formation so gas can flow at a higher rate.

To realize the maximum potential from developing any oil or gas field, the most economi-
cal  artificial  lift  method  must  be  selected.  The  methods  historically  used  to  select  the  lift
method  for  a  particular  field  vary  broadly  across  the  industry.  The  methods  include  operator
experience; what methods are available for installations in certain areas of the world; what is
working in adjoining or similar fields; determining what methods will lift at the desired rates
and  from  the  required  depths;  evaluating  lists  of  advantages  and  disadvantages;  “expert”  sys-
tems  to  both  eliminate  and  select  systems;  and  evaluation  of  initial  costs,  operating  costs,
production capabilities, etc. with the use of economics as a tool of selection, usually on a present-
value basis.

These methods consider geographic location, capital cost, operating cost, production flexibil-
ity,  reliability,  and  “mean  time  between  failures.”  This  chapter  discusses  some  of  the  most
commonly used methods. In most cases, what has worked best or which lift method performs
best  in  similar  fields  serve  as  selection  criteria.  Also,  the  equipment  and  services  available
from vendors can easily determine which lift method will be applied. However, when signifi-
cant  costs  for  well  servicing  and  high  production  rates  are  a  part  of  the  scenario,  it  becomes
prudent  for  the  operator  to  consider  most,  if  not  all,  of  the  available  evaluation  and  selection
methods.  If  the  “best”  lift  method  is  not  selected,  such  factors  as  long-term  servicing  costs,
deferred production during workovers, and excessive energy costs (poor efficiency) can reduce
drastically the net present value (NPV) of the project. Typically, the reserves need to be pro-

IV-412

duced in a timely manner with reasonably low operating costs. Conventional wisdom considers
the  best  artificial  lift  method  to  be  the  system  that  provides  the  highest  present  value  for  the
life of the project. Good data are required for a complete present-value analysis, and these data
are not always broadly available.

In some situations, the type of lift already has been determined and the task is to best ap-
ply that system to the particular well. The more basic question, however, is how to determine
the  proper  type  of  artificial  lift  to  apply  in  a  given  field  for  maximum  present  value  profit
(PVP). This chapter briefly reviews each of the major types of artificial lift before examining
some of the selection techniques. Some less familiar methods of lift also are mentioned. Prelim-
inary factors related to the reservoir and well conditions that should be considered are introduced.
Environmental and geographical considerations may be overriding issues. For example, suck-
er-rod pumping is, by far, the most widely used artificial lift method in onshore United States
operations. However, in a densely populated city or on an offshore platform with 40 wells in a
very small deck area, sucker-rod pumping might be a poor choice. Also, deep wells producing
several  thousands  of  barrels  per  day  cannot  be  lifted  by  beam  lift;  therefore,  other  methods
must  be  considered.  Such  geographic,  environmental,  and  production  considerations  can  limit
the  choices  to  only  one  method  of  lift;  however,  determining  the  best  overall  choice  is  more
difficult when it is possible to apply several of the available lift methods.

10.2 Reservoir Pressure and Well Productivity
Among the most important factors to consider when selecting an artificial lift system are cur-
rent  and  future  reservoir  pressure  and  well  productivity.  If  producing  oil  or  liquid  rate  is
plotted (X axis) against producing BHP (Y axis), one of two inflow performance relationships
(IPR) usually is seen. Above the bubblepoint pressure, the liquid rate vs. pressure drop below
the reservoir pressure (drawdown) is linear. Below the bubblepoint pressure, a relationship sim-
ilar to that described by Ref. 1 occurs. Fig. 10.1 illustrates production vs. drawdown relation-
ships  as  a  single  IPR  with  a  bubblepoint  of  750  psig  and  an  average  reservoir  pressure  of
2,000 psig. If the necessary data are available, a single-phase IPR expression for either gas or
liquid flow is available from radial-flow equations. Gas-deliverability curves show a nonlinear
dependence  of  gas  rate  similar  to  the  liquid  rate  vs.  pressure  on  a  Vogel  curve.1  Liquid-rate
IPR curves can have a gas-to-liquid ratio associated with the liquid rate, and gas-deliverability
curves  can  have  a  liquid  production  (e.g.,  bbl/MMscf/D)  associated  with  the  gas  rates.  This
chapter focuses on IPRs with liquid production as a function of the flowing BHP.

Some  types  of  artificial  lift  can  reduce  the  producing  sandface  pressure  to  a  lower  level
than  other  artificial  lift  methods.  For  pumping  wells,  achieving  a  rate  that  occurs  below  the
bubblepoint  pressure  requires  measures  to  combat  possible  gas  interference  because  gas  bub-
bles  (free  gas)  will  be  present  at  the  intake  of  the  downhole  artificial  lift  installation.  In
addition to setting the pump below the perforations, such measures include the use of a variety
of other possible gas-separation schemes and the use of special pumps to compress gas or re-
duce effects of “fluid pound” in beam systems. However, the artificial lift method of gas lift is
assisted by the production of gas (with liquids) from the reservoir.

The reward for achieving a lower producing pressure will depend on the IPR. With the IPR
data  available,  a  production  goal  may  be  set.  For  low-rate  wells,  the  operator  would  want  to
produce the maximum rate from the well. For high-rate wells, the production goal can be set
by the capacity or horsepower limit of a particular artificial lift method.

In addition to radial flow and IPR expressions for vertical wells, there are several IPR mod-
els2 for horizontal wells. Horizontal wells typically produce several multiples of what a vertical
well would produce in the same formation. Artificial lift usually is installed in the near vertical
portion  of  a  horizontal  well,  rarely  into  the  horizontal  portion,  to  reduce  slugging  and  to
achieve maximum drawdown.

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

IV-413

Fig. 10.1—IPR with bubblepoint pressure of 750 psi.

IPRs can be generated to represent the expected well conditions as the shut-in pressure de-
pletes. When correlated to a reservoir model or a tank material balance, time can be associated
with future IPRs. Fig. 10.2 shows future IPR curves as the reservoir pressure drops as a result
of depletion. This particular model shows the productivity index (PI) remaining constant above
the  bubblepoint  as  the  reservoir  depletes.  The  bubblepoint  would  not  necessarily  remain  con-
stant  with  time  as  modeled  here.  Reservoir  models  may  be  used  to  predict  expected  inflow
conditions of the wells for the life of the project. Usually this is done only for larger projects.
IPR expressions can be modified to show damage or stimulation effects. A test rate or absolute
open flow for an IPR increase due to skin removal can be found by multiplying by approximate-
ly  (7+s)/7  in  which  s  is  the  nonrate  dependent  initial  “skin”  of  the  well  and  the  final  skin  is
zero. This approximate ratio is determined by dividing a radial-flow rate equation with no skin
by  a  radial-flow  equation  with  skin.  The  “7”  is  approximately  the  log  of  0.472  times  the
drainage radius over the wellbore radius. More complex relationships show the effects of rate-
dependent skin or turbulence. For more discussion, see the chapter on formation damage in this
volume of the Handbook.

10.3 Reservoir Fluids
The  characteristics  of  the  reservoir  fluid  also  must  be  considered.  Paraffin  buildup  can  be  at-
tacked mechanically when sucker-rod pumping is used but may require a thermal or chemical
method when other artificial lift methods are used. Sand- or solids-laden production, which can
rule out the use of plunger lift, also can cause wear with sucker-rod pumps, reciprocating hy-
draulic  pumps,  and  jet  pumps.  Gas  lift  and  PCPs  produce  moderate  volumes  of  solids  with
only  minor  problems.  The  producing  gas/liquid  ratio  is  very  important  to  the  lift  designer.  If
the percentage of free gas at intake conditions is high, gas interference is a potential detriment
to  all  methods  of  lift,  but  it  is  a  benefit  to  gas  lift.  High-fluid  viscosity  hinders  most  major
forms  of  lift,  but  the  PCP  may  produce  low  temperature,  shallow,  viscous  fluids  with  little
difficulty.

10.4 Long-Term Reservoir Performance and Facility Constraints
Two approaches frequently are taken to account for long-term reservoir performance: design on
the basis of anticipated performance and design on the basis of current conditions.

If  future  reservoir  performance  can  be  predicted,  artificial  lift  equipment  can  be  installed
that  can  produce  up  to  the  largest  rate  anticipated  over  the  life  of  the  well.  This  philosophy
leads to the installation of oversized equipment, perhaps in anticipation of ultimately producing
large quantities of water. Because most artificial lift methods operate at poor efficiency when
underloaded,  oversized  equipment  installed  because  of  anticipated  high  short-term  production
rates can lead to high energy or operational costs over a significant fraction of the life of the
field.

Another extreme is to design only for current conditions without anticipating future produc-
tion  profiles.  This  can  lead  to  multiple  required  changes  in  the  size  or  type  of  installed  lift
equipment.  Operating  efficiently  during  the  short  term  may  be  possible,  but  large  amounts  of
capital for changing equipment may be required later. For example, changing reservoir condi-
tions  with  time,  as  shown  in  Fig.  10.2,  would  have  to  be  considered  carefully  in  sizing
artificial lift equipment for current conditions and for some future date. Ref. 3 addresses some
of the concerns of timing related to artificial lift methods.

The operator should consider both long-term and short-term aspects of an artificial lift plan.
The goal is to maximize the PVP of the operation over the life of the field. Frequently, the lift
method  that  produces  the  most  oil  is  the  method  that  provides  maximum  PVP.  However,  if
operational costs are significantly high for a particular method, a method that can only produce
a  lower  rate  but  produces  more  reliably  may  be  more  economical.  Changes  in  a  lift  method
usually are not considered worthwhile, but if conditions change drastically, other lift methods
may need to be implemented.

10.5 Types of Artificial Lift
The major forms of artificial lift are sucker-rod (beam) pumping, ESP, gas lift, and reciprocat-
ing  and  jet  hydraulic  pumping  systems.  Also,  plunger  lift  and  PCP  are  becoming  more
common. There are other methods, which are mentioned as appropriate, such as the electrical
submersible progressive cavity pump (ESPCP) for pumping solids and viscous oils, in deviated
wells. This system has a PCP with the motor and some other components similar to an ESP.

Other methods include modifications of beam pump systems, various intermittent gas-lift meth-
ods, and various combination systems.

Artificial lift method selection should be a part of the overall well design. Once the method
is selected, the wellbore size required to obtain the desired production rate must be considered.
Many times, a casing program has been designed to minimize well-completion costs, but it is
later found that the desired production could not be obtained because of the size limitation on
the artificial lift equipment. This can lead to an ultimate loss of total reserves. Even if target
production rates can be achieved, smaller casing sizes can lead to higher long-term well-servic-
ing  problems.  If  oil  prices  are  low,  it  is  tempting  to  select  a  small  casing  size  to  help  with
current  economics.  Obviously,  wells  should  be  drilled  and  completed  with  future  production
and lift methods in mind, but this is often not the case.

Secs.  10.5.1  through  10.5.6  introduce  the  major  methods  of  artificial  lift.  The  advantages
and disadvantages of each method of lift are presented. This information is a tool for any artifi-
cial lift selection process.

10.5.1 Sucker-Rod  Pumping.    Sucker-rod  pumping  systems  are  the  oldest  and  most  widely
used type of artificial lift for oil wells. Fig. 10.3 shows a schematic of a rod pumping system.
System  details  are  found  in  the  chapter  on  sucker-rod  pumping  in  this  section  of  the  Hand-
book.

There  are  approximately  2  million  oil  wells  in  operation  worldwide.  More  than  1  million
wells  use  some  type  of  artificial  lift.  More  than  750,000  of  the  lifted  wells  use  sucker-rod
pumps. In the U.S., sucker-rod pumps lift approximately 350,000 wells. Approximately 80% of
all  U.S.  oil  wells  are  stripper  wells  making  less  than  10  B/D  with  some  water  cut.  The  vast
majority of these stripper wells are lifted with sucker-rod pumps. Of the nonstripper “higher”
volume  wells,  27%  are  rod  pumped,  52%  are  gas  lifted,  and  the  remainder  are  lifted  with
ESPs,  hydraulic  pumps,  and  other  methods  of  lift.  These  statistics4  indicate  the  dominance  of

IV-416

rod pumping for onshore operations. For offshore and higher-rate wells around the world, the
use of ESPs and gas lift is much higher.

Major  Considerations  for  Sucker-Rod  Pumping  Systems.    Sucker-rod  pumping  systems
should be considered for new, lower volume stripper wells because they have proved to be cost
effective over time. In addition, operating personnel usually are familiar with these mechanical-
ly  simple  systems  and  can  operate  them  efficiently.  Inexperienced  personnel  also  can  operate
rod pumps more effectively than other types of artificial lift. Sucker-rod pumping systems can
operate  efficiently  over  a  wide  range  of  production  rates  and  depths.  Most  of  these  systems
have a high salvage value.

Sucker-rod systems should be considered for lifting moderate volumes from shallow depths
and small volumes from intermediate depths. It is possible to lift up to 1,000 B/D from approx-
imately 7,000 ft and 200 bbl from approximately 14,000 ft. Special rods may be required, and
lower rates may result depending on conditions.

Most of the sucker-rod pumping system parts are manufactured to meet existing standards,
which have been established by the American Petroleum Institute (API). Numerous manufactur-
ers  can  supply  each  part,  and  all  interconnecting  parts  are  compatible.  Many  components  are
manufactured and used that are not API certified, such as large-diameter downhole pumps ex-
tending to more than 6 in. in diameter.

The sucker-rod string is the length of the rods from the surface to the downhole pump, and
it continuously is subjected to cyclic load fatigue typical of sucker-rod pump systems. The sys-
tem  must  be  protected  against  corrosion,  as  much  as  any  other  artificial  lift  system,  because
corrosion introduces stress concentrations that can lead to early failures. Frequent rod failures
must be avoided for an economical system operation.

Sucker-rod pumping systems often are most incompatible with deviated (doglegged) wells,
even  with  the  use  of  rod  protectors  and  rod  and/or  tubing  rotators.  However,  deviated  wells
with smooth profiles and low dogleg severity may allow satisfactory sucker-rod pumping, even
if the angle at the bottom of the well is large (approximately 30 to 40°, up to 80°). Some high-
angle  hole  systems  use  advanced  methods  of  protecting  the  tubing  and  rod  string  with  rod
protectors and “roller-rod protectors,” while other installations with high oil cuts, smooth pro-
files,  and  lower  angles  of  deviation  use  only  a  few  of  these  devices.  Plastic-lined  tubing  has
proven to be effective in reducing rod/tubing wear.

The ability of sucker-rod pumping systems to produce sand-laden fluids is limited, although
there are several special filters and sand-exclusion devices available. Some pumps are designed
either to exclude the sand or continue to operate as the sand travels through the barrel-plunger
clearance. Special metallurgies are used for sand wear.

Paraffin and scale can interfere with the efficient operation of sucker-rod pumping systems.
Special  wiper  systems  on  the  rods  and  hot  water/oil  treatments  are  used  to  combat  paraffin.
Hard scales can cause early failures.

Free  gas  entering  the  downhole  pump  reduces  hydrocarbon  production  and  causes  other
problems. This problem and various recommended solutions are detailed in the chapter on sucker-
rod pumping in this section of the Handbook.

One of the disadvantages of a beam-pumping system is that the polished-rod stuffing box,
in  which  a  polished  rod  with  the  rods  hung  below  enters  the  well  at  the  surface  through  a
rubber  packing  element,  can  leak.  This  can  be  minimized  with  special  pollution-free  stuffing
boxes  that  collect  any  leakage.  Good  operations,  with  such  practices  as  “don’t  over  tighten”
and “ensure unit alignment with standard boxes,” with standard boxes are also important.

Continuous production with the system attempting to produce more than the reservoir will
produce  leads  to  incomplete  pump  filling  of  the  pump,  fluid  pound,  mechanical  damage,  and
low energy efficiency. Many systems are designed to produce 120 to 150% more than the reser-

voir will produce, but when the well is pumped down, a pumpoff controller will stop pumping
temporarily to allow fluid entry into the casing-tubing annulus over the pump.

In  general,  sucker-rod  pumping  is  the  method  of  artificial  lift  that  should  be  used  if  the
system can be designed without overloading the prime mover, gearbox, unit structure, and the
calculated  fatigue  loading  limits  of  the  rods.  This  system  should  be  considered  very  carefully
in the selection process and, in many cases, should be the artificial lift system of choice.

10.5.2 Electrical Submersible Pumping.  As an example area in which ESPs are applied exten-
sively, THUMS Long Beach Co. was formed in April 1965 to drill, develop, and produce the
6,479-acre Long Beach unit in Wilmington field, Long Beach, California. It was necessary to
choose  the  best  method  to  lift  fluids  from  the  approximately  1,100  deviated  wells  over  a  35-
year  contract  period  from  four  man-made  offshore  islands  and  one  onshore  site.  ESPs  have
been the primary system in this environment for the contract period.

Fig. 10.4 shows a schematic of a typical ESP system. The chapter on ESP in this section
of the handbook contains more complete details of this mechanical-electrical-hydraulic system.

Major ESP Advantages.  ESPs provide a number of advantages.
• Adaptable to highly deviated wells; up to horizontal, but must be set in straight section.
• Adaptable to required subsurface wellheads 6 ft apart for maximum surface-location density.
• Permit use of minimum space for subsurface controls and associated production facilities.

10.5.3 The PCP and the Electrical Submersible Progressive Cavity Pump.  Fig. 10.5 shows a
schematic of a PCP with a rotating metal rotor and a flexible rubber-molded stator. The stator
forms  a  cavity  that  moves  up  as  the  rotor  turns.  The  pump  is  well  suited  for  handling  solids
and viscous fluids because the solids that move through the pump may deflect the rubber stator
but do not abrade, wear, or chemically deteriorate the stator or rotor to any appreciable degree.
Most  PCPs  are  powered  by  rotating  rods  driven  from  the  surface  with  a  hydraulic  or  electric
motor. The system shown in Fig. 10.5 has a pump small enough that the entire pump can be
inserted with rods.

Introduced in 1936, the PCP is of simple design and rugged construction. Its low (300 to
600 rev/min) operating speeds enable the pump to maintain long periods of downhole operation
if not subjected to chemical attack or excessive wear or it is not installed at depths greater than
approximately 4,000 to 6,000 ft. The pump has only one moving part downhole with no valves
to stick, clog, or wear out. The pump will not gas lock, can easily handle sandy and abrasive
formation fluids, and is not normally plugged by paraffin, gypsum, or scale.

With  this  system,  the  rotating  rods  wear  and  also  wear  the  tubulars.  The  rotating  rods
“wind” up on start and “unwind” on the shutdown. Rotating rods must be sealed at the surface,
and many installations have oil leaks at the surface. These problems must be addressed during
system design.

To alleviate problems inherent with the conventional rotating-rod PCP systems, the ESPCP
system is available. While the number installed is still small, this is not a new system. It has
been run in Russia for a number of years and also was available from an ESP vendor a num-
ber of years ago. The newer ESPCP system (Fig. 10.6) has some advantages over the rotating
sucker-rod systems.

There is a problem of rotating the eccentric rotor with the motor shaft because of possible
vibration; therefore, a flexible connection is used. There is a seal section, as in an ESP assem-
bly,  to  protect  the  underlying  motor  from  wellbore  fluids  and  to  accommodate  an  internal
thrust bearing. Because the PCP usually rotates at approximately 300 to 600 rev/min, and the
ESP motor rotates at approximately 3,500 rev/min under load, there must be a way of reducing
speed before the shaft connects to the PCP. Methods available from various manufacturers in-
clude the use of a gearbox to reduce the motor to acceptable speeds (less than approximately
500 rev/min). Another method is to use higher pole motors with lower synchronous speeds to

allow  the  PCP  to  turn  at  operational  speeds  in  combination  with  a  gearbox,  but  this  system
produces less output-starting torque.

Major PCP Advantages.  PCPs have the following major advantages.
• The pumping system can be run into deviated and horizontal wells.
• The pump handles solids well, but the coating of the rotor will erode over time.
• The pump handles highly viscous fluids in a production well with a looser rotor/stator fit.
• Several of the components are off-the-shelf ESP components for the ESPCP.
• The  production  rates  can  be  varied  with  the  use  of  a  variable-speed  controller  with  an

• For appropriate conditions, the PCP can operate with a power efficiency exceeding other

artificial lift methods.

• The PCP can be set in a straight section of a deviated well.
• Use of an ESPCP eliminates the rotating rods and eliminates problems with rods rotating

in a deviated well.

Major PCP Disadvantages.  PCPs have the following disadvantages.
• The stator material will have an upper temperature limit and may be subject to H2S and

other chemical deterioration.

• Frequent stops and starts of the PCP pumps often can cause several operating problems.
• Although it will not gas lock, best efficiency occurs when gas is separated.
• If  the  unit  pumps  off  the  well  or  gas  flows  continuously  though  the  pump  for  a  short
period, the stator will likely be permanently damaged from overheating caused by gas compres-
sion.

• The  gearbox  in  an  ESPCP  is  another  source  of  failure  if  wellbore  fluids  or  solids  leak

inside it or if excessive wear occurs.

Progressive Cavity Pump Summary.  For a low-pressure well with solids and/or heavy oil at
a  depth  of  less  than  approximately  6,000  ft  and  if  the  well  temperature  is  not  high  (75  to
150°F typical, approximately 250°F or higher maximum), a PCP should be evaluated. Even if
problems  do  not  exist,  a  PCP  might  be  a  good  choice  to  take  advantage  of  its  good  power
efficiency. If the application is offshore, or if pulling the well is very expensive and the well is
most  likely  deviated,  ESPCP  should  be  considered  so  that  rod/tubing  wear  is  not  excessive.

Fig. 10.7—Schematic of a hydraulic jet pump. (Courtesy of Weatherford.)

There is an ESPCP option that allows wire lining out a failed pump from the well while leav-
ing the seal section, gearbox, motor, and cable installed for continued use.

10.5.4 Hydraulic Pumping.  There are two primary kinds of hydraulic pumps: jet pumps and
reciprocating  positive-displacement  pumps.  Fig.  10.7  shows  a  jet  pump  arrangement.  For  jet
pumps, high-pressure power fluid is directed down the tubing to the nozzle where the pressure
energy  is  converted  to  velocity  head  (kinetic  energy).  The  high-velocity,  low-pressure  power
fluid entrains the production fluid in the throat of the pump. A diffuser then reduces the veloci-
ty and increases the pressure to allow the commingled fluids to flow to the surface.

The  positive-displacement  pump  consists  of  a  reciprocating  hydraulic  engine  directly  cou-
pled to a pump piston or pump plunger. Fig. 10.8 shows a reciprocating hydraulically powered
pump. Power fluid (oil or water) is directed down the tubing string to operate the engine. The
pump  piston  or  plunger  draws  fluid  from  the  wellbore  through  a  standing  valve.  Exhausted
power fluid and production can be returned up a separate tubing string or up the casing.

IV-422

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 10.8—Schematic of a reciprocating hydraulic pump. (Courtesy of Weatherford.)

When the power fluid and the production are combined, the system is an open power-fluid
system.  For  a  vented  open  power-fluid  system,  the  production  and  power  fluid  typically  are
returned separately in a parallel tubing string with gas normally vented through the casing an-
nulus  to  the  surface.  A  nonvented  casing  installation  requires  a  pump  to  handle  the  gas  and
production. The power fluid plus all reservoir fluids are produced up the annulus. Both comple-
tion  types  are  used  with  positive-displacement  pumps  and  with  jet  pumps.  In  fact,  many
bottomhole  assemblies  (BHAs)  can  accommodate  jet  or  positive-displacement  pumps  inter-
changeably.

In  a  closed  power-fluid  arrangement,  the  power  fluid  is  returned  to  the  surface  separately
from produced fluids, requiring a separate tubing string. The use of a closed power fluid sys-
tem  is  limited  as  a  result  of  the  added  initial  costs  and  clearance  problems  in  small  casing.
Because the jet pump must commingle the power fluid and production, it cannot operate as a
closed power-fluid pump.

The  most  outstanding  feature  of  hydraulic  pumps  is  the  “free  pump”  system.  Fig.  10.9
shows a schematic of a free hydraulic pump. Fig. 10.9a shows a standing valve at the bottom

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

IV-423

Weatherford.)

of the tubing, and the tubing is filled with fluid. In Fig. 10.9b, a pump has been inserted in the
tubing and power fluid is being circulated to the bottom. In Fig. 10.9c, the pump is on bottom
and pumping. When the pump is in need of repair, fluid is circulated to the surface as shown
in Fig. 10.9d. The positive-displacement pump, the jet pump, and the closed power-fluid sys-
tem previously shown are all free pumps.

Surface facilities require a power-fluid storage and cleaning system and a pump. The most
common cleaning systems are settling tanks located at the tank battery. Cyclone desanders some-
times are used in addition to settling tanks. In the last 40 years, wellsite power plants, which

IV-424

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

are separators located at the well with cyclone desanders to remove solids from the power flu-
id, have become popular.

Surface  pumps  are  most  commonly  triplex  plunger  pumps.  Other  types  are  quintiplex
plunger  pumps,  multistage  centrifugal  pumps,  and  “canned”  ESPs.  The  surface  pressure  re-
quired  is  usually  in  the  1,500  to  4,000  psi  range.  It  is  important  to  specify  100%  continuous
duty for the power-fluid pump at the required rate and pressure. Low volume (< 10,000 B/D),
high-pressure installations (> 2,500 psi) typically use plunger-type pumps.

Table 10.1 shows approximate maximum capacities and lift capabilities for positive-displace-
ment pumps. In some cases, two pumps have been installed in one tubing string. Seal collars
in  the  BHA  hydraulically  connect  the  pumps  in  parallel;  thus,  maximum  displacement  values
are doubled.

A relationship between capacity and lift is not practical for jet pumps because of the many
variables and the complex relationships among them. To keep fluid velocities below 50 ft/sec
in  suction  and  discharge  passages,  the  maximum  production  rates  vs.  tubing  size  for  jet-free
pumps are approximated in Table 10.2.

Fixed-type jet pumps (those too large to fit inside the tubing) have been made with capaci-
ties of 17,000 B/D, and even larger pumps are possible. Maximum lifting depth for jet pumps
is  approximately  8,000  to  9,000  ft  if  surface  power-fluid  pressure  is  limited  to  approximately
3,500 psi for water power fluid and approximately 4,000 psi with oil power fluid, considering
the operating life of a triplex pump. The maximum capacities can be obtained only to approxi-
mately 5,000 to 6,000 ft. These jet pump figures are only guidelines. The maximum capacities
listed  are  for  high-volume  jet  pumps  that  require  BHAs  that  are  incapable  of  accommodating
piston pumps.

Hydraulic Pumping Advantages.  Hydraulic pumping has the following advantages.
• Being able to circulate the pump in and out of the well is the most obvious and signifi-
cant  feature  of  hydraulic  pumps.  It  is  especially  attractive  on  offshore  platforms,  remote
locations, and populated and agricultural areas.

• Positive-displacement pumps are capable of pumping depths to 17,000 ft and deeper. Work-

ing fluid levels for jet pumps are limited to approximately 9,000 ft.

• By  changing  the  power-fluid  rate  to  the  pumps,  production  can  be  varied  from  10  to
100% of pump capacity. The optimum speed range is 20 to 85% of rated speed. Operating life
will be significantly reduced if the pump is operated above the maximum-rated speed.

• Deviated  wells  typically  present  few  problems  to  hydraulic  free  pumps.  Jet  pumps  can

even be used in through flowline installations.

• Jet pumps, with hardened nozzle throats, can produce sand and other solids.
• There  are  methods  in  which  positive-displacement  pumps  can  handle  viscous  oils  very
well. The power fluid can be heated, or it can have diluents added to further aid lifting the oil
to the surface.

• Corrosion  inhibitors  can  be  injected  into  the  power  fluid  for  corrosion  control.  Added

fresh water can solve salt-buildup problems.

Hydraulic Pumping Disadvantages.  Hydraulic pumping has the following disadvantages.
• Removing solids from the power fluid is very important for positive-displacement pumps.
Solids in the power fluid also affect surface-plunger pumps. Jet pumps, on the other hand, are
very tolerant of poor power-fluid quality.

• Positive-displacement  pumps,  on  average,  have  a  shorter  time  between  repairs  than  jet,
sucker rod, and ESPs. Mostly, this is a function of the quality of power fluid but, on average,
the  positive-displacement  pumps  are  operating  from  greater  depths  and  at  higher  strokes  per
minute than  for  a  beam pump  system.  Jet  pumps,  on  the  other  hand,  have  a  very  long  pump
life  between  repairs  without  solids  or  if  not  subjected  to  cavitation.  Jet  pumps  typically  have
lower efficiency and higher energy costs.

• Positive-displacement  pumps  can  pump  from  a  low  BHP  (<  100  psi)  in  the  absence  of
gas interference and other problems. Jet pumps cannot pump from such low intake pressures,
especially  when  less  than  the  cavitation  pressure.  Jet  pumps  require  approximately  1,000  psi
BHP when set at 10,000 ft and approximately 500 psi when set at 5,000 ft.

• Positive-displacement pumps generally require more maintenance than jet pumps and oth-
er  types  of  artificial  lift  because  pump  speed  must  be  monitored  daily  and  not  allowed  to

IV-426

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

become excessive. Power-fluid-cleaning systems require frequent checking to keep them operat-
ing at their optimum effectiveness. Also, well testing is more difficult.

When  should  a  jet  be  used,  and  when  should  a  positive-displacement  hydraulic  pump  be
used? One possible answer is to use jet pumps if the flowing (pumping) BHP is large enough
because the pressure drawdown capability for the jet system is inferior to that of the reciprocat-
ing  pump.  Other  factors  enter  in  as  well  as  those  mentioned  previously.  Jet  pumps  typically
have low pump-repair costs but have high energy-consumption expenses because of low pump
efficiencies, usually less than 35%. However, for both systems, a higher pump-failure rate can
be  very  acceptable  if  a  free  system  is  present  and  the  pumps  can  be  retrieved  quickly  (less
than 30 minutes typically) without pulling the tubing.

10.5.5 Gas Lift.  Gas lift is used extensively around the world and dominates production in the
U.S.  Gulf  Coast.  Most  of  these  wells  are  on  continuous-flow  gas  lift.  This  section  addresses
the following issues: Why choose gas lift?; Where should continuous flow be used?; and When
should intermittent lift be selected?

The principle of gas lift is that gas injected into the tubing reduces the density of the fluids
in  the  tubing,  and  the  bubbles  have  a  “scrubbing”  action  on  the  liquids.  Both  factors  act  to
lower the flowing BHP at the bottom of the tubing. Care must be exercised not to inject excess
gas, or friction will begin to negate the desirable effects of injecting gas into the tubing.

Continuous-Flow Gas Lift.  Fig. 10.10 shows a schematic of a gas-lift system. Continuous-
flow  gas  lift  is  recommended  for  high-volume  and  high-static  BHP  wells  in  which  major
pumping problems could occur with other artificial lift methods. It is an excellent application
for offshore formations that have a strong waterdrive, or in waterflood reservoirs with good PIs
and  high  gas/oil  ratios  (GORs).  When  high-pressure  gas  is  available  without  compression  or
when gas cost is low, gas lift is especially attractive. Continuous-flow gas lift supplements the
produced gas with additional gas injection to lower the intake pressure to the tubing, resulting
in lower formation pressure as well.

A reliable, adequate supply of good quality high-pressure lift gas is mandatory. This supply
is necessary throughout the producing life of the well if gas lift is to be maintained effectively.
In many fields, the produced gas declines as water cut increases, requiring some outside source
of  gas.  The  gas-lift  pressure  typically  is  fixed  during  the  initial  phase  of  the  facility  design.
Ideally, the system should be designed to lift from just above the producing zone. Wells may
produce erratically or not at all when the lift supply stops or pressure fluctuates radically. Poor
gas  quality  will  impair  or  even  stop  production  if  it  contains  corrosives  or  excessive  liquids
that can  cut  valves  or  fill low  spots  in  delivery lines.  The  basic  requirement for  gas  must  be
met, or gas lift is not a viable lift method.

IV-428

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 10.13—Approximate depth-rate capabilities of lower rate artificial lift systems (after Weatherford8).

Continuous-flow gas lift imposes a relatively high backpressure on the reservoir compared
with  pumping  methods;  therefore,  production  rates  are  reduced.  Also,  power  efficiency  is  not
good compared with some artificial lift methods, and the poor efficiency significantly increases
both initial capital cost for compression and operating energy costs.

Gas Lift Advantages.  Gas lift has the following advantages.
• Gas lift is the best artificial lift method for handling sand or solid materials. Many wells
produce some sand even if sand control is installed. The produced sand causes few mechanical
problem  in  the  gas-lift  system;  whereas,  only  a  little  sand  plays  havoc  with  other  pumping
methods, except the PCP type of pump.

• Deviated or crooked holes can be lifted easily with gas lift. This is especially important

for offshore platform wells that are usually drilled directionally.

• Gas lift permits the concurrent use of wireline equipment, and such downhole equipment
is easily and economically serviced. This feature allows for routine repairs through the tubing.
• The normal gas-lift design leaves the tubing fully open. This permits the use of BHP sur-

veys, sand sounding and bailing, production logging, cutting, paraffin, etc.

• High-formation  GORs  are  very  helpful  for  gas-lift  systems  but  hinder  other  artificial  lift
systems. Produced gas means less injection gas is required; whereas, in all other pumping meth-
ods, pumped gas reduces volumetric pumping efficiency drastically.

• Gas lift is flexible. A wide range of volumes and lift depths can be achieved with essen-
tially  the  same  well  equipment.  In  some  cases,  switching  to  annular  flow  also  can  be  easily
accomplished to handle exceedingly high volumes.

• A  central  gas-lift  system  easily  can  be  used  to  service  many  wells  or  operate  an  entire
field. Centralization usually lowers total capital cost and permits easier well control and testing.
• A gas-lift system is not obtrusive; it has a low profile. The surface well equipment is the
same as for flowing wells except for injection-gas metering. The low profile is usually an ad-
vantage in urban environments.

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

IV-429

• Well subsurface equipment is relatively inexpensive. Repair and maintenance expenses of
subsurface  equipment  normally  are  low.  The  equipment  is  easily  pulled  and  repaired  or  re-
placed. Also, major well workovers occur infrequently.

• Installation of gas lift is compatible with subsurface safety valves and other surface equip-
ment. The use of a surface-controlled subsurface safety valve with a ¼-in. control line allows
easy shut in of the well.

• Gas  lift  can  still  perform  fairly  well  even  when  only  poor  data  are  available  when  the
design is made. This is fortunate because the spacing design usually must be made before the
well is completed and tested.

IV-430

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Gas Lift Disadvantages.  Gas lift has the following disadvantages.
• Relatively high backpressure may seriously restrict production in continuous gas lift. This
problem  becomes  more  significant  with  increasing  depths  and  declining  static  BHPs.  Thus,  a
10,000-ft well with a static BHP of 1,000 psi and a PI of 1.0 bpd/psi would be difficult to lift
with the standard continuous-flow gas-lift system. However, there are special schemes available
for such wells.

• Gas lift is relatively inefficient, often resulting in large capital investments and high energy-
operating  costs.  Compressors  are  relatively  expensive  and  often  require  long  delivery  times.
The compressor takes up space and weight when used on offshore platforms. Also, the cost of
the  distribution  systems  onshore  may  be  significant.  Increased  gas  use  also  may  increase  the
size of necessary flowline and separators.

• Adequate gas supply is needed throughout life of project. If the field runs out of gas, or if
gas becomes too expensive, it may be necessary to switch to another artificial lift method. In
addition, there must be enough gas for easy startups.

• Operation and maintenance of compressors can be expensive. Skilled operators and good
compressor mechanics are required for reliable operation. Compressor downtime should be min-
imal (< 3%).

• There is increased difficulty when lifting low gravity (less than 15°API) crude because of
greater  friction,  gas  fingering,  and  liquid  fallback.  The  cooling  effect  of  gas  expansion  may
further aggravate this problem. Also, the cooling effect will compound any paraffin problem.

• Good data are required to make a good design. If not available, operations may have to

continue with an inefficient design that does not produce the well to capacity.

Potential  gas-lift  operational  problems  that  must  be  resolved  include  freezing  and  hydrate
problems  in  injection  gas  lines,  corrosive  injection  gas,  severe  paraffin  problems,  fluctuating
suction and discharge pressures, and wireline problems. Other problems that must be resolved
are  changing  well  conditions,  especially  declines  in  BHP  and  PI;  deep  high-volume  lift;  and
valve interference (multipointing). Additionally, dual gas lift is difficult to operate and frequent-
ly  results  in  poor  lift  efficiency.  Finally,  emulsions  forming  in  the  tubing,  which  may  be
accelerated when gas enters opposing the tubing flow, also must be resolved.

10.5.6 Intermittent Gas Lift.  The intermittent gas-lift method typically is used on wells that
produce low volumes of fluid (approximately < 150 to 200 B/D), although some systems pro-
duce  up  to  500  B/D.  Wells  in  which  intermittent  lift  is  recommended  normally  have  the
characteristics of high PI and low BHP or low PI with high BHP. Intermittent gas lift can be
used to replace continuous gas lift on wells that have depleted to low rates or used when gas
wells have depleted to low rates and are hindered by liquid loading.

If an adequate, good quality, low-cost gas supply is available for lifting fluids from a rela-
tively  shallow,  high  GOR,  low  PI,  or  low  BHP  well  with  a  bad  dogleg  that  produces  some

IV-432

sand, then intermittent gas lift would be an excellent choice. Intermittent gas lift has many of
the same advantages/disadvantages as continuous-flow gas lift, and the major factors to be con-
sidered are similar. Only the differences are highlighted in the following discussion. If plunger
lift can be used instead of only intermittent lift, the efficiency will be higher. This difference
could determine the success or failure of the system.

Intermittent Gas Lift Advantages.  Intermittent gas lift has the following advantages.
• Intermittent gas lift typically has a significantly lower producing BHP than continuous gas-

lift methods.

• It has the ability to handle low volumes of fluid with relatively low production BHPs.
Intermittent Gas Lift Disadvantages.  Intermittent gas lift has the following disadvantages.
• Intermittent gas lift is limited to low volume wells. For example, an 8,000-ft well with 2-
in.  nominal  tubing  can  seldom  be  produced  at  rates  of  more  than  200  B/D  with  an  average
producing pressure much below 250 psig.

• The average producing pressure of a conventional intermittent lift system is still relatively
high when compared with rod pumping; however, the producing BHP can be reduced by use
of chambers. Chambers are particularly suited to high PI, low BHP wells.

• The  power  efficiency  is  low.  Typically,  more  gas  is  used  per  barrel  of  produced  fluid
than with constant flow gas lift. Also, the fallback of a fraction of liquid slugs being lifted by
gas flow increases with depth and water cut, making the lift system even more inefficient. How-
ever, liquid fallback can be reduced by the use of plungers, where applicable.

• Fluctuations in rate and BHP can be detrimental to wells with sand control. The produced
sand  may  plug  the  tubing  or  standing  valve.  Also,  pressure  fluctuations  in  surface  facilities
cause gas- and fluid-handling problems.

• Intermittent gas lift typically requires frequent adjustments. The lease operator must alter
the  injection  rate  and  time  period  routinely  to  increase  the  production  and  keep  the  lift  gas
requirement relatively low.

Gas lift has numerous strengths that can make it the best choice of artificial lift; however,
there are limitations and potential problems. One has a choice of the use of either continuous
flow  for  high  volume  wells  or  intermittent  for  low  volume  wells;  there  is  little  difficulty  in

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

IV-433

switching  from  one  to  the  other.  In  addition,  gas  lift  can  be  used  to  kick  off  wells,  unload
water from gas wells, or backflow injection wells. Gas lift deserves serious consideration as a

IV-434

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

means  of  artificial  lift;  however,  it  is  not  energy  efficient  and  continuous  gas  lift  does  not
achieve a low BHP at the formation, compared with well operating pumping systems.

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

10.5.7 Other Lift Methods.  Plunger lift commonly is used to remove liquids from gas wells
or  produce  relatively  low  volume,  high  GOR  oil  wells.  Plunger  lift  is  important  and,  in  its
most  efficient  form,  will  operate  with  only  the  energy  from  the  well.  Fig.  10.11  shows  a
schematic  of  a  plunger  lift  installation.  A  free-traveling  plunger  and  produced-liquid  slug  is
cyclically brought to the surface of the well from stored gas pressure in the casing-tubing annu-
lus and from the formation. In the off cycle, the plunger falls and pressure builds again in the
well. A new two-piece plunger (cylinder with ball underneath) can lift fluids when the compo-
nents are together, but both components are designed to fall when separate. Use of this plunger
allows a shut-in portion of the operational cycle that is only a few seconds long, resulting in
more production for many wells.

There is a chamber pump that relies on gas pressure to periodically empty the chamber and
force the fluids to the surface, which is essentially a gas-powered pump. There are variations

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

IV-437

of gas lift and intermittent lift, such as chamber lift. Not all possible variations of artificial lift
can be discussed; however, the principles presented apply to the selection of all methods that
might be considered.

IV-438

10.6 Selection Methods

10.6.1 Selection by Consideration of Depth/Rate System Capabilities.  This section discusses
various  selection  techniques.  Some  of  the  following  discussion  is  after  material  from  Refs.  5
and 6.

One  simple  selection  or  elimination  method  is  the  use  of  charts  that  show  the  range  of
depth and rate in which particular lift types can function. One example is a chart from Ref. 7.
Figs. 10.12 and 10.13 are slightly altered versions of information from Ref. 8 and are probably
more accurate because they are more recent. Minimums for method applications are not shown
in the charts from Ref. 8. The charts are approximate for initial selection possibilities, as any
simplified charts such as these would be. Particular well conditions, such as high viscosity or
sand production, may lead to the selection of a lift method that is not initially indicated by the
charts. Specific designs are recommended for specific well conditions to more accurately deter-
mine the rates possible from given depths.

The depth-rate charts show how hydraulic systems can pump from the greatest depths be-
cause  of  the  U-tube  balancing  of  produced  fluid  pressures  with  the  hydraulic  fluid  pressure.
Gas  lift  is  somewhat  depth  limited,  primarily  from  compressor  pressures  required,  but  has  a
wide range of production capacity. Beam pump produces more from shallower depths and less

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

IV-440

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

IV-441

from deeper depths because of increasing rod weight and stretch as depth increases. ESPs are
depth limited because of burst limitations on housings and energy considerations for long ca-
bles but can produce large production rates. Plunger lift is for low liquid rates, although some
wells can produce more than 300 B/D. Plunger lift is not particularly depth limited because of
the  increased  energy  storage  in  the  casing  annulus  as  depth  increases.  Along  with  advantage/
disadvantage lists introducing the artificial lift methods, the depth-rate charts are tools for artifi-
cial lift selection or quick elimination of possibilities.

IV-442

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

10.6.2 Selection by Advantages and Disadvantages.  Although  previous  sections  detailed  the
major  artificial  lift  systems,  more  detailed  listings  of  advantages  and  disadvantages  are  avail-
able from various sources. Ref. 9 contains a brief summary of advantages, disadvantages, and
selection criteria for various artificial lift systems presented by experts in a forum discussion.

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

IV-443

IV-444

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Tables 10.3 and 10.410 provide a useful summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the
various artificial lift systems. Some were discussed previously when introducing each system.

Ref. 11 provides the most extensive and useful listing of the various advantages and disad-
vantages of lift systems under a broad range of categories. Some of the information is open to
interpretation,  but,  in  general,  it  is  the  best  list  of  artificial  lift  advantages  and  disadvantages
available  at  this  time.  The  information  in  the  tables  from  Ref.  11  is  a  very  useful  tool  for
artificial lift selection.

Tables  10.5  through  10.7  present  the  information  in  the  selection  tables  from  Ref.  11.
Some of the details in the tables have been updated, but the majority of the work is from the
original  authors.  These  tables  are  used  for  a  preliminary  look  at  some  operation  details  and
capabilities  for  artificial  lift.  Much  of  the  selection  process  can  be  accomplished  with  depth-
rate charts7,8 and this extensive set of tables of artificial lift capabilities.11 Very severe condi-
tions and special conditions can require further study. Also, a quantitative economic assessment
is not possible with the charts and tables.

10.6.3 Selection by Expert Programs.  “Expert” programs, or computerized artificial lift selec-
tion programs, are more advanced than a simple list of advantages and disadvantages and depth-

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

IV-445

Ref.  12  describes  an  expert  system  with  selection  criteria  on  sucker  rod,  hydraulic  pump,
ESP,  progressive  pump,  continuous  gas  lift,  intermittent  gas  lift,  intermittent  gas  lift  with
plunger,  constant  slug  injection  gas  lift,  chamber  gas  lift,  and  conventional  plunger  lift.  The
program contains three modules. Module 1 is an expert module that includes a knowledge base
structured from human expertise, theoretical written knowledge, and rule-of-thumb calculations.
It ranks the methods and also issues warnings, some of which may rule out high-ranked meth-
ods.  Module  2  incorporates  simulation  design  and  facility-component  specification  programs
for  all  artificial  lift  methods  considered.  It  contains  a  suite  of  design  methods  with  advice  to
follow  from  Module  1.  Module  3  is  an  economics  evaluation  module  that  includes  a  cost
database and cost-analysis programs to calculate lift profitability. It uses the designs and expect-
ed production rate to calculate profitability with evaluation parameters such as NPV and rate of
return. Module 3 also includes investment costs and repair and maintenance costs.

The  rules  in  Ref.  12  take  the  form  of  “if  (condition),  then  (type  of  process).”  For  each
artificial lift method, a suitability coefficient (SC) from –1 to +1 is defined for the given condi-
tion, where SC = –1 eliminates the process from further consideration, and SC = +1 indicates a
process well suited to the given condition. For example, “if (Pump Temperature > 275°F), then
(ESP)  –1”  defines  a  rule  that  eliminates  ESPs  if  the  pump  temperature  exceeds  275°F.  Rules
such as this require constant updating because equipment capabilities change with time.

rate charts. These programs include rules and logic that branch to select the best artificial lift
system as a function of user input of well and operating conditions. Refs. 12 through 14 deal
with expert systems for the selection of artificial lift systems.

Intermediate values can be used to refine the system, and methods are presented for combin-
ing  the  coefficients  into  a  single  coefficient.  The  program  can  combine  the  suitability  coeffi-
cients  into  one  value  for  overall  evaluation.  Ref.  12  also  gives  other  details  for  knowledge
representation and technical and economic evaluation.

Ref. 13 describes an artificial lift program that decides, from the user’s input, which system
among gas lift, hydraulic, sucker rod, or ESP pumping systems is best for the particular condi-

IV-446

tions. Problems—such as sand, paraffin, crooked hole, corrosion, small casing, flexibility, and
scale—are  used  with  the  stored  knowledge  base  and  user  input  to  allow  the  program  to  rank
the most appropriate artificial lift method for the particular conditions.

Ref. 14 describes another encompassing expert system. It describes the optimum pumping-
unit  search  program,  which  consists  of  a  knowledge  base  containing  the  complete  set  of
specific information on the domain of expertise, an inference engine with the data and heuris-
tics of the knowledge base to solve the problem, and interactive modules enabling very simple
use  of  the  expert  system.  Another  interesting  feature14  is  the  presentation  of  economical  data
for annual costs to be incurred by various artificial lift systems. The costs are presented in bar
graphs that show how the component costs would occur above the wellhead or subsurface. For
instance, much of the possible recurring costs for ESPs can be from the subsurface; whereas,
for gas lift, other than wireline work, larger repair and servicing costs associated with compres-
sors would be taken care of on the surface.

10.6.4 Selection by Net-Present-Value Comparison.  A more thorough selection technique de-
pends on the lifetime economics of the available artificial lift methods. The economics, in turn,
depend on the failure rates of the system components, fuel costs, maintenance costs, inflation
rates,  anticipated  revenue  from  produced  oil  and  gas,  and  other  factors  that  may  vary  from
system  to  system.  Refs.  15  through  17  are  example  studies  that  follow  economically  guided
selection techniques. Refs. 18 through 26 discuss artificial lift in general, the efficiency of lift
methods, selection techniques, and limitations on various artificial lift systems.

Economic Analysis of Artificial Lift Selection.  The  methods  considered  are  ESP,  gas  lift,
hydraulic pump, and rod pump. An enhanced method of analysis similar to the NPV compari-
son method is available from Ref. 17.

To  use  the  NPV  comparison  method,  the  user  must  have  a  good  idea  of  the  associated
costs for each system. This requires that the user evaluate each system carefully for the particu-
lar well and be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of each method and any additional
equipment  (i.e.,  additional  costs)  that  may  be  required.  Because  energy  costs  are  part  of  the

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

IV-447

for a group of 532 wells.

NPV analysis, a design for each feasible method must be determined before running the eco-
nomic analysis to better determine the efficiency of a particular installation. These factors force
the consideration of all the applicable artificial lift methods to generate the necessary informa-
tion for the NPV analysis.

Example 10.1  Consider  a  vertical  well  with  the  characteristics  given  in  Table  10.8.  To
calculate the expected life of the well, reasonable reservoir production estimates must be sup-
plied. For this example, assume that all artificial lift methods (ESP, gas lift, beam pump, and
hydraulics)  will  be  considered  and  initially  will  produce  at  the  rate  of  1,000  B/D  with  50%
water cut and 400 GOR. After a 1-year constant rate period, oil production is assumed to de-
cline  by  20%  per  year.  The  overall  rate  (oil+water+gas)  will  remain  constant.  The  water  cut
will increase after the first year. The rate of 10 BOPD is selected as the end of the evaluation
period, but the economic limit will be reached long before this rate occurs.

Table  10.9  contains  the  values  needed  for  the  NPV  analysis  that  are  specific  to  each  lift
method. The sources of all these values are typical of each of the methods. The direct operat-
ing  expenses  could  be  manpower  to  visit  and  monitor  wells,  site  maintenance,  overhead
charged to field, etc. The direct operating expenses per barrel could be water disposal charges,
injection of corrosion inhibitor or scale treatments, etc. The average pulling and repair charges
are average charges for pulling because of failed or worn equipment. An analog field, if avail-
able, can be a source of such data.

IV-448

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 10.16—A typical distribution of failures among the beam-pump system components.

The  actual  initial  production  rate  may  differ  for  each  method,  but  for  comparison  and  to
illustrate concepts, an initial total rate of 1,000 B/D for each method is assumed. In this case,
it is possible to accomplish this rate with all the methods considered. Different rates possibly
would  require  different  production  facilities  and  different  initial  costs.  Thus,  each  method
should be optimized and the associated required costs included in the economic analysis.

Solution.  Fig.  10.14  plots  the  summary  of  the  cumulative  PVP  income.  The  maximum  in
each  curve  occurs  at  the  time  the  project  should  be  ended,  because  beyond  that,  the  project
would be operating at a loss. The maximum PVP for each lift method examined is indicated in
Fig. 10.14, and the results are tabulated in Table 10.10.

Again, the results depend on the particular cost-related data for each method. For this case,
however, the rod pump or ESP would be the most economical method. Because rod pump and
ESP are approximately the same economically, the decision then would fall on vendor availabil-
ity, service expected, where equipment can be warehoused, and other factors. Gas lift and jet
hydraulic  pump  would  not  be  recommended  for  this  case  according  to  the  results  obtained.
Different field conditions could easily change the lift system selected.

10.7 Sample Run-Life Information
As Example 10.1 shows, one of the factors to consider in artificial lift selection is the failure
rates  for  the  various  artificial  lift  systems  or  the  individual  components  of  the  systems.  Fig.
10.15  shows  failure  rates  from  a  group  of  532  beam-pumped  wells  over  several  years.  The
costs for downhole lift replacement and servicing are shown.

Fig. 10.16 shows a breakdown of the major causes for failure of the beam pump systems
that went into the accumulation of the failure-rate data in Fig. 10.15. If a lift selection study is
needed, field data from a field of similar conditions would be very helpful in evaluating beam
pumping as a candidate and in comparing beam pump with other artificial lift methods. A break-
down of failing components for any lift method is a good evaluation tool.

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

IV-449

Fig. 10.17—Failure data from a number of field locations and target values.26

Fig. 10.17 shows ESP run lives for various fields. These data were collected and presented
in  Ref.  17  for  a  study  of  artificial  lift  feasibility  and  methods  to  use  in  a  Siberian  location.
Targets and downside potentials were established for this study as shown in Fig. 10.17.

Refs. 5 and 6 include various run-life information and selection criteria. Swan Hills (Alber-
ta),  Milne  Point  (Alaska),  the  Amoco  Congo  field,  the  THUMS  East  Wilmington  field,  the
Amoco  North  Sea  field,  and  the  Montrose  field  were  used  to  help  predict  run  lives  for  the
Priobskoye field in Siberia. Ref. 17 contains additional information on the conditions in these
fields.  Fig.  10.17  shows  the  “learning  curve”  aspect  of  these  field  developments.  The  initial
learning  curve  is  very  costly,  showing  the  time  required  to  come  from  low  run  lives  before
failures up to reasonable operational lives for the ESP installations. This learning curve can be
eliminated  with  careful  planning,  reference  to  previous  projects,  and  implementation  of  early
good practices in the development.

From Ref. 6, Table 10.11 shows downhole hydraulic pump lives for a collection of fields.
Ref. 6 presents the conditions for these fields. The average life of the pumps is approximately
114  days.  Target,  downside,  and  industry  data  is  summarized  for  the  downhole  hydraulic
pumps. No data are presented for gas-lift-system costs and failures expected. Initial compressor
costs are high, but after installation, most of the expense is wireline work unless a major com-
pressor fix or addition is needed. Cost examples for other systems are not shown here.

The data shown are for particular fields and may or may not be indicative of what might
be undertaken in the future. Again, the run lives to failure data cases for the various artificial
lift systems presented are example cases and are not intended for general use.

10.8 Conclusions
This chapter presents information on the various methods available for the selection of the best
artificial lift system for given field conditions. The discussion presents selection methods cover-
ing depth-rate feasibility maps; tables of advantages and disadvantages; expert system programs

IV-450

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

containing feasibility, technical, and economic programs; and economic analysis methods such
as present-value analysis.

Chapter 10—Artificial Lift Selection

IV-451

Because  the  present-value  method  requires  designs  to  meet  target  rates,  the  user  is  some-
what forced to evaluate harsh conditions, etc., during the course of the design. The user must
then add gas separators, sand control, or whatever is necessary to meet target rates before the
NPV analysis is performed. By necessity, various feasibility criteria must be considered; there-
fore,  even  if  all  data  required  for  a  complete  economic  analysis  are  not  available,  going
through the analysis forces the user to consider or make best estimates of critical parameters,
pointing to a better selection process.

Although  some  fairly  complete  expert  systems  for  selection  exist,  their  use  is  not
widespread  at  this  time.  This  may  be  a  result  of  the  constant  updating  required  or  because
other types of selection processes that use experienced personnel may work as well or better.
The lack of use also may be a result of the general lack of experience with these tools and a
lack of understanding about the results that may be obtained from their use.

Sucker-Rod Lift
Norman W. Hein, Jr., ConocoPhillips*

11.1 Introduction
This chapter discusses the specific artificial-lift technique known as beam pumping, or the sucker-
rod-lift method. Many books, technical articles, and industry standards have been published on
the  sucker-rod  lift  method  and  related  technology.1–7  This  chapter  is  a  complete  revision  of
previous editions of the Petroleum Engineering Handbook,6 but it combines the prior three rele-
vant chapters that covered downhole rod pumps and sucker rods, along with pumping units and
prime movers. Additionally, the other components of a sucker-rod pumping installation are dis-
cussed,  including  applicable  engineering  and  operating  information.  The  complete  operating
system should be understood and addressed to properly design, install, and operate this or any
other type of artificial-lift system. Thus, this chapter uses the Gipson and Swaim “Beam Pump
Design  Chain”  as  a  foundation  and  builds  on  this  design  philosophy  by  using  relevant,  pub-
lished technology and the latest industry practices.5–7

11.1.1 Beam-Pumping Systems.  Beam  pumping,  or  the  sucker-rod  lift  method,  is  the  oldest
and  most  widely  used  type  of  artificial  lift  for  most  wells.  A  sucker-rod  pumping  system  is
made up of several components, some of which operate aboveground and other parts of which
operate  underground,  down  in  the  well.  The  surface-pumping  unit,  which  drives  the  under-
ground  pump,  consists  of  a  prime  mover  (usually  an  electric  motor)  and,  normally,  a  beam
fixed to a pivotal post. The post is called a Sampson post, and the beam is normally called a
walking beam. Fig. 11.1 presents a detailed schematic of a typical beam-pump installation.

This system allows the beam to rock back and forth, moving the downhole components up
and  down  in  the  process.  The  entire  surface  system  is  run  by  a  prime  mover,  V-belt  drives,
and a gearbox with a crank mechanism on it. When this type of system is used, it is usually
called  a  beam-pump  installation.  However,  other  types  of  surface-pumping  units  can  be  used,
including  hydraulically  actuated  units  (with  and  without  some  type  of  counterbalancing  sys-
tem),  or  even  tall-tower  systems  that  use  a  chain  or  belt  to  allow  long  strokes  and  slow
pumping speeds. The more-generic name of sucker-rod lift, or sucker-rod pumping, should be
used to refer to all types of reciprocating rod-lift methods.

Linked rods attached to an underground pump are connected to the surface unit. The linked
rods are normally called sucker rods and are usually long steel rods, from ⅝ to more than 1 or
1¼ in. in diameter. The steel rods are normally screwed together in 25- or 30-ft lengths; how-
ever,  rods  could  be  welded  into  one  piece  that  would  become  a  continuous  length  from  the
surface  to  the  downhole  pump.  The  steel  sucker  rods  typically  fit  inside  the  tubing  and  are
stroked  up  and  down  by  the  surface-pumping  unit.  This  activates  the  downhole,  positive-dis-
placement  pump  at  the  bottom  of  the  well.  Each  time  the  rods  and  pumps  are  stroked,  a
volume of produced fluid is lifted through the sucker-rod tubing annulus and discharged at the
surface.

11.1.2 Selecting The Sucker-Rod Pumping Method.  Many factors must be considered when
determining the most appropriate lift system for a particular well. The chapter on Artificial Lift
Selection in this volume of this Handbook presents a discussion of the normally available artifi-
cial-lift  techniques,  their  advantages  and  disadvantages,  and  the  selection  of  a  method  for  a
well installation.

Because of its long history of successfully lifting well fluids, the sucker-rod lift method is
normally considered the first choice for most onshore, and even some offshore, installations all
over the world. This method is limited by the size of the casing, tubing, and downhole pump;
the strength and size of the various rods; and the speed with which they can be reciprocated.
Under favorable conditions, approximately 150 BFPD can be lifted from greater than 14,000 ft,
while more than 3,000 BFPD can be lifted from less than 2,000 ft.8,9 Some of the major advan-
tages and disadvantages of this lift technique are shown in Table 11.1.

11.2 The Producing Reservoir
Understanding the makeup of the producing reservoir, its pressure, and the changes that occur
in it are important to attain maximum production. Because reservoir conditions change as flu-
ids  are  produced,  ongoing  measurement  of  the  reservoir  conditions  is  necessary.  The  main
considerations in measuring and understanding the reservoir are the types and volumes of reser-
voir  fluids  being  produced,  their  pressures  in  both  the  reservoir  and  at  the  wellbore  or  pump
intake, and the effects these fluids have as they pass through the producing system.

The  relationship  between  the  reservoir-fluid  inflow  and  the  produced-fluid  outflow  is  ex-
tremely  important  for  any  artificial-lift  method.  This  should  be  monitored  and  controlled  so

IV-460

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

that any excessive damage to the lift equipment is avoided while profitably obtaining the maxi-
mum amount of fluids. Undesirable effects result when the producing equipment’s capacity is
not properly balanced with reservoir-fluid inflow. These effects include the following:

• Loss or deferment of production.
• Excessive producing costs.
• Premature equipment failure.
• Ineffective use of energy.
• Increased operating expenses.
A  variety  of  well  tests  and  measurements  may  be  used  to  determine  production  rates  for
oil-, gas-, and water-supply wells and to observe the status of the reservoir. Each test reveals
certain information about the well and the reservoir being tested. The main reservoir considera-
tions  are  determining  bottomhole  pressure  and  the  inflow  relationship  of  the  fluids  with
changing reservoir and pump-intake pressure.

11.2.1 Bottomhole-Pressure Determination.  Bottomhole-pressure-measuring equipment (pres-
sure  bombs)  makes  it  possible  to  determine  reservoir  and  tubing  intake  pressures  within  the
desired range of accuracy. When this test is conducted at scheduled intervals, valuable informa-
tion  about  the  decline  or  depletion  of  the  reservoir  from  which  the  well  is  producing  can  be
obtained.  However,  it  is  difficult  to  obtain  either  bottomhole  reservoir  or  operating  pressures
while the rod-pump system is installed and operating.

Calculations  of  the  bottomhole  pressures  can  be  obtained  by  using  instruments  that  detect
the  fluid  level  in  the  casing/tubing  annulus.  The  simplest  instrument  is  a  fluid-level  sounder
with  a  strip  chart.  Bottomhole  pressures  can  be  estimated  from  the  gravity  of  the  fluids  (i.e.,
oil, water, and gas), the volumes produced, and the fluid level. If producing and shut-in condi-
tions are known, then approximate producing and shut-in reservoir pressures can be determined.
The  key  to  accurate  bottomhole-pressure  determination  in  any  pumping  well  is  the  ability
to predict the gradient of the fluid in the casing/tubing annulus. In 1955, W.E. Gilbert* devel-
oped an iterative calculation procedure on the effect of gas bubbling up a static fluid column.
This  can  be  used  in  a  trial-and-error  method  to  determine  a  gradient  correction  factor  (F)  to
determine  the  pressure  at  the  desired  depth  in  the  presence  of  gas  production.  If  the  term
Q/(aP)0.4 is greater than 0.25, this method should be used with caution because this is an indi-
cation that liquid flow up the annulus may occur. Also, the crude pressure/volume/temperature
(PVT) characteristics alter the results. The Gilbert curve and a calculation example are present-
ed in “The Beam Pump Design Chain.”7

Currently,  the  same  fluid-level  sounder  equipment  can  be  interfaced  with  a  computer  to
determine the downhole pressures more easily.10,11 However, there still needs to be verification
of the fluid-level indication to ensure that “false” or incorrect annulus fluid levels are not record-
ed. Additionally, the fluid gravities and produced volumes must be accurate and reflect actual
conditions.

Knowing  the  reservoir  and  pump-intake  pressures  during  static  and  operating  conditions
will  allow  a  determination  of  the  well’s  production  capacity.  This  is  required  to  optimize  the
artificial-lift equipment and properly size the equipment that is installed. The well productivity
under varying production conditions must then be known.

11.2.2 Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR).  One of the most critical decisions in an artifi-
cial-lift system is the selection and design of equipment appropriate for the volume of fluid the
reservoir  produces.  Other  chapters  of  this  Handbook  detail  the  productivity  index  and  IPR  of
fluids  with  changes  in  reservoir  pressure.  Because  most  fluid  produced  by  an  artificial-lift

IV-461

method is not single phase, it is not in a steady-state condition. Also, because most pumping
operations  occur  after  the  fluid  is  below  the  bubblepoint  pressure,  the  IPR  method  is  usually
considered. This technique takes into account various fluid phases and flow rates. It was origi-
nally devised by Vogel12 and described by Eickmeier.13 Each revision increased the accuracy of
estimating flow rates from a well.

In the design of an artificial-lift system, it is necessary not only to predict production of the
various fluids during existing conditions and reservoir pressure, but also to make a second type
of prediction: future pressure performance. This can be accomplished with the IPR method and
multiple, or a family of, IPR curves. Furthermore, the family of curves can be used to predict
estimates  of  fluid  production  increases  if  the  reservoir  is  repressurized  from  waterflooding  or
other secondary or tertiary methods.

Producing rates can be estimated within the desired range of accuracy using the IPR tech-
nique  with  two  stabilized  producing  rates  and  corresponding  stabilized  producing  pressures.
This makes it possible to use the IPR without needing to shut in the well and lose production
to  obtain  shut-in  information.  Obtaining  a  bottomhole  pressure  equal  to  10%  of  the  shut-in
reservoir  pressure  is  recommended  for  determining  maximum  production  rates  for  sucker-rod
lifted wells. At this pressure, the maximum well productivity will be 97% of the well’s theoret-
ical  maximum  production  rate.  However,  the  maximum  lift-design  rate  should,  in  most  cases,
be slightly higher to permit some downtime and decreased pump efficiency.

11.2.3 Gas Production.  In  any  artificial-lift  system,  the  volume  of  gas  produced  should  be
considered  in  designing  the  system  and  in  analyzing  the  operation  after  the  system  has  been
installed. A complete analysis requires knowing the volume of gas in solution, the volume of
free  gas,  the  formation  volume  factors,  and  whether  gas  is  produced  through  the  pump  or  is
vented. If PVT analyses of reservoir fluids are available, they are the most accurate and easiest
to use as a source of solution gas/oil ratio (GOR), formation volume factors, etc. The next best
source is an analysis from a nearby similar reservoir.

A  means  of  estimating  PVT  data  is  contained  in  Volumetric  and  Phase  Behavior  of  Oil
Field Hydrocarbon Systems.14 With the produced GOR, gas gravity, oil gravity, and reservoir
temperature, the following can be estimated using the instructions included on each chart:

• Chart 1: The formation volume factor for the gas plus the liquid phases.
• Chart 2: The bubblepoint pressure.
• Chart 3: The formation volume factor of the bubblepoint liquid.

11.2.4 Gas Venting.  When  pumping  through  tubing  in  the  absence  of  a  production  packer,
free  gas,  which  breaks  out  of  the  oil,  should  be  vented  up  from  the  casing/tubing  annulus.
However, when it is necessary to produce from beneath a production packer, a vent string can
be installed. The possibility of needing a vent string should be considered when planning cas-
ing sizes for a new well.

Both the size of the vent string and the location of its bottom, with respect to the location
of  the  pump  intake  and  producing  perforations,  will  influence  the  string’s  effectiveness  in  re-
moving  free  gas.  The  string’s  diameter  should  be  designed  to  allow  the  production  of  the
anticipated free-gas volume with a pressure drop no greater than the desired producing bottom-
hole pressure minus the surface backpressure. If the required pressure drop is greater than this,
a portion of the free gas will have to go through the pump. Fig. 11.2 is an indication of the
effect of vent-string size on the pressure drop through it. Care should be taken if small-diame-
ter tubing is used, because it may not allow all the gas to flow up the vent or may simply load
up and prevent most gas flow.

11.2.5 Effect  of  Gas  on  Pump  Performance.    Gas  that  remains  in  solution  when  the  liquid
enters the pump increases the volume of total fluid through the pump compared to the liquid

IV-462

(ft).

measured  at  the  surface  by  the  formation  volume  factor  at  pump-intake  conditions.  The  gas
also decreases the density of the fluid and, thus, the head or pressure to be pumped against in
the tubing. Free gas that enters the pump must be compressed to a pressure equivalent to the
head required to lift the fluid. This free gas will reduce the volume of both the produced liquid
that enters the pump and the liquid measured at the surface. Any time the pump does not com-
press the free gas to a pressure greater than that exerted on the pump by the fluid column in
the producing string, production ceases and the pump is said to be “gas locked.” This condition
can exist in both plunger and centrifugal pumps.

11.2.6 Intake Pressure.  Intake  pressure  is  the  pressure  in  the  annulus  opposite  the  point  at
which  the  fluid  enters  the  pump.  If  the  pump-intake  pressure  is  increased  by  increasing  the
pump submergence, the free-gas volume decreases because the fluid retains more gas in solu-
tion.  Reducing  the  pressure  drop  in  the  pump-suction  piping  also  reduces  the  free  gas  to  be
produced. The pump intake should not be deeper than is necessary to maintain the desired in-
take pressure. A pump intake that is too deep results in unnecessary investment and increased
operating costs.

Fig. 11.3 is a graph of the liquid produced as a percent of the displacement of a plunger
pump  plotted  against  the  pump-intake  pressure  for  a  typical  reservoir.15  If  the  pressure  is
greater than the bubblepoint (Point A to B), the volumetric efficiency remains nearly constant.
If all the gas can be vented rather than passed through the pump, the volumetric efficiency will
increase  as  the  formation  volume  factor  decreases  (Point  B  to  C).  If  all  the  gas  must  be
pumped, the volumetric efficiency decreases as the intake pressure drops to less than the bub-
blepoint  (Point  B  to  F).  The  lines  B–D  and  B–E  indicate  the  volumetric  efficiency  with  a
partial venting of gas as its presence declines. Note that the efficiency declines to a minimum
at  less  than  the  bubblepoint  and  with  further  pressure  reduction,  starts  to  increase.  A  general
conclusion is that to obtain better efficiencies, the pump-intake pressure should be maintained

intake pressures and the effect of gas on efficiency.

at or greater than the bubblepoint, or decreased to as low as possible to take advantage of the
increased  separation  efficiencies  at  the  low-pressure  end.  However,  this  considers  only  pump
efficiency and not maximum production rate.

Gas bubbles entrained in the produced liquid(s) tend to rise because of the difference in the
liquid  and  gas  densities.  The  rate  of  bubble  rise  depends  on  the  size  of  the  bubbles  and  the
physical properties of the fluid. The size of the bubbles increases as the pressure decreases. At
low pump-intake pressures, the rate of gas-bubble rise in low-viscosity fluids will approximate
0.5 ft/sec, assuming a 400-μm bubble rise in water. The increase in bubble size and rate of rise
as the pressure decreases causes the reversal in curves B–D and B–E in Fig. 11.3.

11.2.7 Downhole Gas Separators and Anchors.  Downhole  gas  separators  are  used  in  gassy
wells to increase the volume of free gas removed from the liquids before reaching the pump.
However, they are not 100% effective in separating the gas. In sucker-rod-pumped wells, these
separators are normally called “gas anchors.” Gas anchors are usually designed and built in the
field;  Fig. 11.4  contains  schematic  drawings  of  six  common  types.  The  most  commonly  used
are the “natural” gas anchor (A) and the “poor boy” gas anchor (C). Typically, there are two
major  components  for  these  gas-anchor  assemblies,  the  mud  anchor  run  on  the  bottom  of  the
tubing string and the dip tube or strainer nipple run on the bottom of the pump.

The largest downhole gravity separator is normally the casing/tubing annulus. This area pro-
vides a maximum down passage for liquid and up-flow area for gas. This allows the oil (and
water) to move relatively slowly, typically, downward from the perforations to the pump, and
permits the gas to separate and flow upward. For this reason, a natural gas anchor should be
used whenever practical because it takes advantage of the entire casing internal cross-sectional

area.  This  type  of  separator  typically  should  be  placed  approximately  15  ft  below  the  lowest
most-active well perforations. However, if there is insufficient distance in the well to place the
pump intake below the perforations, then the pump intake should be placed approximately 15

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-465

ft  above  the  top-most  perforation  and  a  poor  boy  separator  should  be  properly  designed  and
installed.

There are limitations on how much gas can be handled by the downhole separator. If more
gas is produced than can be handled by the separator, the gas will not separate completely. The
downhole  pump  must  then  handle  the  excess  gas.  If  the  wells  exceed  these  theoretical  gas
rates, then pump volumetric efficiency decreases, liquid production decreases, energy is wasted,
and  operating  costs  rise.  The  situation  worsens  if  excessive  gas  enters  the  pump  and  there  is
insufficient compression ratio to pump all the fluids, resulting in a gas-locked pump. When this
occurs, operating costs for this well increase dramatically because when there is no production,
there is no revenue. However, a properly designed and spaced pump should not gas lock if the
well is not pumped off.

Example calculations of the gas capacity of various casing/tubing annuli vs. different intake
pressures  have  been  presented  in  Ref.  9.  This  reference  also  discusses  the  types  of  downhole
separators  and  emphasizes  the  need  to  run  a  natural  gas-anchor  assembly  whenever  possible.9
Detailed discussions on design of the different types of separators, the arrangement of compo-
nents,  and  example  calculations  for  sizing  components  are  presented  by  Gipson  and  Swaim.7
Improved gas separators with decentralized intakes have been introduced.16,17 This design aids
in separation efficiency because it increases the local distance from the casing’s inner diameter
(ID)  to  the  mud  anchor,  which  results  in  an  increased  separation  area.  However,  as  with  all
specialty devices, the need to run this new design should be demonstrated by ensuring that the
appropriate, standard systems have been properly installed and operated.

11.2.8 Fishing.  It  is  often  recommended  that  the  outside  diameter  (OD)  of  the  gas  anchors’
steel mud anchor be less than the ID of the largest overshot or wash pipe that can be run in
the  well  casing.  This  limits  the  gas-anchor  separation  capacity  that  can  be  secured  in  wells
with small casings. Reinforced plastic mud anchors that can be drilled up, or steel designs that
can be recovered with spears, should be considered when mud anchor OD must approach casing-
drift  diameter.  This  design  would  then  be  considered  the  “modified  poor  boy.”  Agreement
should be obtained from the field before installation to ensure acceptance of the possible prob-
lems when trying to pull this type of installation.

11.3 Downhole Sucker-Rod Pumps

11.3.1 Major Components.  There are seven major components for downhole rod pumps: stand-
ing  and  traveling  valves,  plunger,  barrel,  seating  assembly,  pull  tube  or  valve  rod  (for  insert
pump),  and  the  fittings  that  hold  the  assembled  pump  together.  The  most  common  of  these
components and the final types of assembled pumps are covered by American Petroleum Inst.
(API) Specification 11AX.18

11.3.2 Types  of  Pumps.    API  recognizes  two  main  types  of  pumps:  rod  and  tubing.  Rod
pumps  also  are  called  insert  pumps  because  they  are  run  (inserted)  in  the  production  tubing.
Tubing pumps are so named because the working barrel of this pump is coupled with the pro-
duction-tubing string.

There  is  a  wide  range  of  plunger  (or  pump-bore)  sizes  standardized  by  the  industry.  The
API  pump-bore  sizes  that  are  currently  available  range  from  1 ∕16
 to  3¾  in.  in  diameter.  This
1
1 ∕16
1 -in. size has been added back in the latest edition of the standard. Additionally, a new bar-
rel type has been accepted in the latest API Spec. 11AX. This is the “X-type” barrel. It has a
thin-walled barrel configuration for threads on either end of the heavy-walled barrel and is avail-
able  for  metal  plungers  only.  This  type  of  pump  does  not  require  the  extension  couplings
normally needed for heavy-walled barrel pumps. Thus, this pump reduces the burst or collapse

IV-466

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

concerns of the thin-walled extension couplings and allows deeper producing depths to be at-
tained.

11.3.3 API Pumps and Nomenclature.  While there are only two main types of pumps stan-
dardized by API, there are four different types of rod pumps. These are classified by the type
of barrel (standing or traveling) and where the pump is anchored (top or bottom). Table 11.2
shows the letter designations for the various types of rod and tubing pumps that are available
for different barrel thicknesses and either metal or soft-packed plungers.

The complete pump designation of an API pump adds dimensional diameters and lengths to
the letter designations. This has been modified in the latest revision to incorporate all approved
sizes and barrel types along with separating the extensions into the top and bottom lengths, if
required. The complete API designation includes the following:

• Nominal tubing size (from 1.9- to 4.5-in. OD).
• Basic bore diameter (from 1.0625 to 3.75 in.).
• Type of pump (rod or tubing).
• Type of barrel (heavy, thin, or X type).
• Seating-assembly location (top or bottom).
• Type of seating assembly (cup or mechanical).
• Barrel length (ft).
• Nominal plunger length (in.).
• Length (in.) of upper extension (if required).
• Length (in.) of lower extension (if required).
Fig. 11.5 shows the API nomenclature for pumps covered by API Spec. 11AX. For exam-
ple, a 1¼-in. bore-rod-type pump with a 10-ft heavy-walled barrel, a 2-ft upper extension, a 2-
ft lower extension, a 4-ft plunger, and a bottom-cup-type seating assembly that will be used in
2⅜-in. tubing would be designated as 20-125-RHBC-10-4-2-2.

It is important to know that the users of API pumps need to provide, along with the pump
nomenclature,  the  following  ordering  information:  barrel  and  plunger  material,  plunger  clear-
ance (or  fit  tolerance), and  valve (ball and  seat)  and  fittings material. The  materials normally
available for each of these components also are now included in the latest edition of API Spec.
11AX.

for the various components.

11.3.4 Non-API and Specialty Pumps.  The  types  of  pumps,  sizes,  and  component  materials
that  are  included  in  the  API  standards  are  based  on  the  best  industry  practices  that  meet  the
widespread industry needs. While API standardizes the majority of pumps and components that
are used in sucker-rod lift, there are special parts and pumps that have been developed by man-
ufacturers  to  try  to  solve  specific  pumping  problems.  This  specialty  equipment  should  be
considered  when  best  industry  practices  and  standardized  components  have  proved  unaccept-
able.  However,  the  manufacturer  of  these  components  should  create  all  parts  to  the  same
quality level required in API Spec. 11AX.

Useful specialty pumps include the following:
• Casing pump for production without tubing.

IV-468

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

• Pumps with two plungers that act in series to increase displacement.
• High-compression plunger assembly or pump for handling gas-interference problems.
• Three-tube pump for handling fines or solids.
• Pumps with a shorter barrel than normally recommended, so that the plunger completely

wipes solids free of the barrel and prevents sticking.

Additionally,  there  are  special  pump  components,  such  as  valve  rods,  valves,  and  tubing
drains,  that  are  sometimes  beneficial  in  situations  in  which  the  capabilities  of  normal  API
pumps and components have been exceeded. The manufacturer of special, non-API pumps and
components should be contacted to determine the working capabilities and limitations of any of
these specialty components. However, these items should be selected with care and used only
after the best production effort has been thoroughly tested with standard components.

11.3.5 Materials Selection.  The  most  recent  API  Spec.  11AX  was  modified  to  add  not  only
new  sizes  and  types  of  pumps  with  new  quality,  inspection,  and  tolerance  requirements,  but
also standardized, widely used pump-component materials. Table 11.3 presents the various ma-
terial descriptions, their API identification symbol, surface condition, base core hardness, base
material, and base-material minimum yield strength for plated barrels, as shown in API Table
A  of  Spec.  11AX.  Similar  tables  in  Spec.  11AX  (B  through  I)  are  incorporated  for  case-hard-
ened barrels, nonhardened barrels, balls and seats, cages, pull tubes, valve rods, fittings, seating
cups, spray-metal plungers, and plated plungers. These changes have incorporated the prior in-
formation in API RP 11AR19 and the Natl. Assn. of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) MR 01-7620
for materials to be used in most production environments.

11.3.6 Allowable Setting Depth.  In the early 1990s, an industry task group analyzed the stress-
es that react on a downhole rod pump. This was required to determine if there were recommend-
ed  allowable  loads  that  could  be  subjected  to  rod  pumps  of  different  types,  sizes,  and
metallurgy. This group developed the burst, collapse, and axial-loading equations to determine
these  limits  and  the  associated  maximum  recommended  setting  depth  for  sucker-rod  lift
pumps,21  published  in  API  RP  11AR19;  an  example  of  the  recommended  setting  depth  of  this
standard is presented in Table 11.4. The depth limitation and stresses on the downhole pump
barrel and components should be considered when selecting the size, type, and metallurgy for a
downhole pump.

11.3.7 Slippage Past Plungers.  The slippage or leakage past a plunger on a closely fitted sucker-
rod  pump  is  an  important  factor  in  properly  designing  and  operating  a  well.  The  previous
edition of the Petroleum Engineering Handbook discusses the main factors that affect leakage.
Eq. 1 in Chap. 8 on sucker-rod pumps6 can be rewritten, combining constants, as the following
equation:

Q = (1,540,000 × D × p × L p × C3) / (μ * ), ..................................... (11.1)

in  which  Q  =  slippage  or  leakage  loss,  in.3/min;  D  =  plunger  diameter,  in.;  P  =  differential
pressure  across  plunger,  psi;  C  =  diametrical  clearance  between  plunger  and  barrel,  in.;  μ  =
absolute viscosity of fluid, cp; and Lp = plunger length, in.

The importance of plunger leakage is demonstrated in the example in the previous edition
of  the  Handbook  that shows  for  a  0.003-in.  clearance, a  2¼-in.-diameter pump  with  a  48-in.-
long plunger operating with a pressure differential of 2,000 psi at 15 strokes per minute (spm)
and  a  48-in.  stroke  length.  Tight  clearances  (less  than  0.003  in.)  may  cause  producing  prob-
lems, whereas loose clearances (greater than 0.008 in.) may result in excessive leakage by the
pump. Good field-pump records are essential to make good pump recommendations.

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-469

11.3.8 Compression Ratio.  Increasing the “compression ratio” of a plunger pump may reduce
the  effects  of  free  gas  and  help  prevent  gas  locking.  The  compression  ratio  is  the  volume  of
the  pump  chamber  at  the  start  of  the  downstroke  divided  by  the  volume  at  the  end  of  the
stroke.  This  ratio  is  fixed  by  the  manufacturer  on  the  basis  of  the  design  of  the  rod  pump’s
components and the fit of the plunger to the pump barrel. Varying the sucker-rod pump compo-

IV-470

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

nents  and  close  spacing  will  alter  the  compression  ratio;  however,  some  of  these  components
are not standardized by the API Spec. 11AX. This can increase waste space in the pump, result-
ing in a decreased compression ratio. The importance of the compression ratio and associated
waste space may prevent a new pump from being able to pump down a well.22 This work by
McCafferty  is  further  discussed  in  Ref.  9,  which  also  presents  different  pump  manufacturers’
normal compression ratios for similar pump types.

11.3.9 Selection of Subsurface Rod Pumps.  Pumps for sucker-rod lifted wells should be se-
lected  on  the  basis  of  numerous  variables  that  are  provided  by  the  well,  the  operating  condi-
tions, and the life of the pump. The main variables to consider are as follows:

• Well depth.
• Bottomhole temperature.
• Fluid viscosity.
• Amount and size of particulates in the produced fluids.
• Produced-fluids corrosivity.
• Required production rate vs. pump capacity.
• Fluid-specific gravity.
• Casing/tubing size.
• Well-completion type.
• Gas/liquid ratio (GLR).
• Pump-intake pressure vs. fluid bubblepoint.

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-471

• Spare/surplus pumps and components.
• New purchase and repair costs.
These variables influence the stresses on the pump, type of pump used, component metallur-
gy, pump size, internal-fit tolerance, and ability to handle solids/gas. Discussing these parame-
ters with the pump manufacturer and local pump shop should help determine the proper pump
to ensure acceptable pump life.

11.3.10 Pump Sizing.  There are two aspects to consider when sizing the downhole pump for
an installation. The first is that the pump capacity should be related to the well capacity. The
pump  displacement  is  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  pumping  speed,  unit  stroke  length,  and
plunger diameter. This general equation is

PD = 0.1166 × S × N × D2, .................................................. (11.2)

in  which  PD  =  pump  displacement,  BFPD;  0.1166  =  a  volumetric  conversion;  S  =  stroke
length, in.; N = pumping speed, spm; and D = diameter of the pump plunger, in.

The  stroke  length  should  be  the  expected  downhole  stroke  or  plunger  stroke  (Sp)  that  is
calculated from a sucker-rod string calculation or sizing computer program. However, the sur-
face stroke length may be considered an approximation of the maximum capacity for a given
pumping situation.

The recommended relationship of pump displacement to well capacity (WC), as discussed in

Ref. 9, is as follows:

(WC / 0.85) ≤ PD ≤ (WC / 0.65) . ............................................... (11.3)

Thus, for a well that produces 100 BFPD, the various pumping parameters should be selected
to provide a pump displacement of between 118 and 154 BFPD. Because the pump displace-
ment  is  greater  than  the  well  capacity,  the  system  will  require  some  type  of  well  control  to
prevent constant operation and overpumping of the well. This increased capacity accommodates
pump wear and loss of efficiency with time. As this occurs, system control should be adjusted
to  continue  producing  as  required,  without  overpumping  by  running  the  pump  more  often.  It
should be considered that as the pump diameter increases, the efficiency of the system increas-
es. However, this also increases the load on the rod string and the peak torque for the pumping
unit. Thus, reasonable selection of these pumping parameters should be considered that results
in extended run time.

The second aspect of pump sizing, once the pump diameter is selected, is ensuring that the
downhole  pump  is  properly  built.  The  main  component  that  needs  to  be  sized  is  the  barrel
length, which should be long enough to accommodate the plunger length, the downhole stroke
length, all fittings, and a rounding factor.

The  minimum  plunger  length  recommended  is  normally  3  ft.  It  is  recommended  that  the
length  of  the  plunger  is  increased  1  ft/1,000  ft  of  well  depth,  up  to  a  6-ft  maximum  length.
Plunger lengths longer than 6 ft have not shown to be an advantageous, while specialty pumps
may have a plunger shorter than 3 ft.

When determining the barrel length, normally the maximum pumping-unit stroke length is
considered to allow pump displacement to be increased with the existing downhole pump with-
out  pulling  the  downhole  pumping  equipment  to  change  the  capacity.  However,  this  extra
length and the pump-displacement option increase the price of the pump. Thus, the downhole
Sp length should be considered the stroke measurement to use in the barrel-length calculation.

The types of fittings and their respective lengths depend on the type of pump being used.

Normally, 12 to 18 in. covers the length range for various pump types.

IV-472

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

The  final  factor  in  determining  the  barrel  length  is  a  rounding  factor.  Once  the  previous
factors  are  added  together,  the  length-of-barrel  calculation  is  normally  increased  to  the  next
available  whole-foot  standard  length  for  a  pump  according  to  API  Spec.  11AX.18  Using  the
surface  stroke  length  vs.  the  downhole  Sp  length,  and  designating  this  length  as  the  rounding
factor, may provide sufficient barrel length to accommodate the spacing length some operators
or pump shops suggest.

This  spacing  factor  is  normally  a  minimum  of  24  in.  for  wells  up  to  4,000  ft  deep,  then
increases 6 in. in length per 1,000 ft of increased well depth. These rules are recommended for
all  steel  sucker-rod  strings.  When  fiber-reinforced  plastic  (FRP)  rods  are  used,  additional  in-
creased  spacing  may  be  required  because  of  the  increased  “stretch”  or  elongation  of  the  rod
string under the load. The FRP-rod manufacturer should have, or have access to, a sucker-rod-
string  design  program  that  will  estimate  the  increased  plunger  travel.  This  length  then  should
be used in the barrel-length determination. Thus, for a 5,000-ft-deep well, with a required 74-
in. surface stroke, a 48-in.-long plunger with a steel rod string and a designated 2⅞ × 1½-in.
RHB pump, the displacement length must be greater than 152 in. to permit adequate spacing.
A standard 12-ft barrel with 1-ft top and bottom extension couplings should be considered.

11.3.11 Pump Operating Problems and Solutions.  There are four common ways subsurface
rod pumps are abused. These problems may also be applicable to other downhole pumps, and
thus, these related solutions probably are applicable to other artificial-lift techniques. The four
common abuses follow:

• Overpumping the well.
• Gas interference.
• Pump hitting up or down.
• Trash entering the pump.
Because the recommended pump-displacement design is for the pump to have greater capac-
ity than the well, an overpumping condition may occur if the well is not properly controlled.
An  overpumping condition is  indicated when  there is  a  fluid  pound  more  than  one-quarter of
the way down on the downstroke because of insufficient fluid in the well to charge or fill the
downhole  pump.  This  condition  may  be  seen  on  the  surface  if  the  pound  is  very  severe,  but
the best way to detect this is with the use of a dynamometer. Other indications of overpumping
are  if  the  pump  volumetric  efficiency  is  less  than  70%  or  if  a  downhole  fluid-level  survey
shows that the normal operating fluid level is at or very near the pump intake. Overpumping
may cause mechanical damage to the pump or cause damage uphole to the rod/tubing because
of increased buckling and wear. Properly setting a well controller will help reduce severe over-
pumping.

Indications of gas interference include low volumetric efficiency, while the fluid-level sur-
vey  shows  apparent,  adequate  pump  submergence  and  a  polish  rod  that  is  excessively  hot  to
the  touch.  A  dynamometer  survey,  when  combined  with  the  precalculated  well  loads  for  the
applicable  design  conditions,  may  indicate  gas  pound,  gas  lock,  or  inconsistency  with  the  as-
sumed  conditions.  The  gas-interference  condition  may  be  remedied  by  increasing  the  pump
compression ratio, if possible. This may be as simple as respacing the pump as the fluid level
decreases  in  the  well  annuli or  changing the  stroke  length for  the  pump  downhole,  or  it  may
require  pulling  the  pump  and  altering  its  design.  The  compression  ratio  of  the  replacement
pump  should  be  determined  to  ensure  adequate  lift  capabilities.  Additionally,  a  pump  with
tighter fit tolerance/waste space, smaller pump diameter, increased stroke length, adequate down-
hole  separation,  and  properly  designed  pump  gas  anchor  should  be  considered  along  with
properly placing the pump intake above or below the perforations, as previously discussed. Fi-
nally,  if  these  normal  solutions  do  not  resolve  the  problem,  then  special  pumps  or  specialty
components may be considered.

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-473

A pump component hitting on the up- or downstroke is indicated by an instantaneous load
change  and  can  be  shown  with  a  load-capable  dynamometer.  This  condition  normally  occurs
because of inadequate pump spacing as the fluid level pumps down or because the pump has
inadequate compression ratio/excessive waste space for the seating depth for the designed pump-
ing parameters. While severely “tapping,” or “tagging,” the pump may be heard, felt, or seen,
the  smashed  pump  components  obtained  during  a  pump  teardown  will  show  the  damage  this
condition  causes.  This  condition  may  also  be  magnified  for  tubing  that  does  not  have  an  an-
chor, or if the anchor is not properly set. Other conditions that may cause this problem include
if the pump-intake piping is plugged or not properly designed, if the pump has inadequate com-
pression ratio, if the polished-rod clamp is not sufficiently tightened, and/or if the pump barrel
is not properly sized.

The last normal operating problem is caused by solids entering the pump. There are many
reasons for these particulates. The particulates may be caused by well conditions such as pro-
ducing  the  fracturing  sand  back  into  the  wellbore,  very  fine  powder  from  the  formation,  iron
sulfide  scale  from  the  downhole  equipment  because  of  inadequate  corrosion  inhibition,  iron
sulfide or other scales from the formation because of incompatible fluids, or from overpumping
the well. Solutions include using different types of pumps designed to handle fines and solids,
such  as  three-tube  pumps  or  soft-packed  plungers,  and  using  harder  materials  or  coatings  for
the pump components. Filters or downhole, wire-wrapped screens have been used with limited
success  until  they  plug.  In  the  past,  tighter  fit  tolerances  (<  0.003  in.)  for  the  plunger-barrel
annuli have been considered; however, recent work done in both the laboratory and the field,
has shown the benefit of increasing these tolerances to greater than 0.005 in. when solids are a
problem.23 This work has resulted in the variable-slippage pump that would be useful for condi-
tions in which solids are present in the produced fluids and gas interference is also a problem.24

11.3.12 Pump Shop, Repair, and Audit.  The  pump  manufacturer  typically  machines  or  ob-
tains  subcontract  pump  components  for  future  assembly  of  the  pump  by  a  pump  shop.  The
shop, the knowledge of the design, selection of pump types, and associated component metallur-
gies  become  critical  to  long  well  life  and  a  decreased  failure  frequency.  API  RP  11AR19
provides useful information on pump types, component and metallurgy selection, pump-setting-
depth calculation, and pump assembly/teardown.

While the pump manufacturers usually produce their pump components with an acceptable
quality  program  (such  as  ISO  900125  or  API  Spec.  Q126),  most  pump  shops  are  not  covered
under these rigorous plans. Thus, it becomes critical to have the pump shop and its employees
audited by qualified personnel to ensure that training, workmanship, safety, and environmental
considerations are adequate. On the basis of many shop audits, assembly and teardown observa-
tions,  requirements  and  recommendations  in  API  standards,  and  performance  quality  require-
ments, a checklist that should be used as a first step in obtaining an acceptable pump shop has
been developed and published.27 Once the audit is performed and the checklist completed, the
findings should be discussed with the appropriate pump-shop personnel and a time line devel-
oped detailing when changes to resolve any problem areas will be made.

11.4 Sucker Rods

11.4.1 Steel Sucker Rods.  API Spec. 11B28 provides the industry requirements for sucker rods
and some related sucker-rod lift equipment. The three main grades of steel rods follow:

• Grade C rods that have minimum and maximum tensile strengths of 90,000 and 115,000

psi, respectively.

• Grade  K  rods  that  have  a  minimum  tensile  strength  of  90,000  psi  and  a  maximum
strength  of  115,000  psi.  These  rods  are  made  with  1.65  to  2.00%  nickel  and  are,  therefore,
more expensive than Grade C rods, but may have improved corrosion-related properties.

IV-474

• Grade  D  rods  that  have  a  minimum  tensile  strength  of  115,000  psi  and  a  maximum
strength of 140,000 psi. Three types of this grade are covered by Spec. 11B: plain-carbon, al-
loy, and special-alloy steels.

Spec. 11B allows for rod lengths of 25 or 30 ft and pony rods in six lengths (i.e., 20, 44,
68,  92,  116,  and  140  in.  measured  from  contact  face  of  pin  shoulder  to  contact  face  of  pin
shoulder). The acceptable rod diameter goes from ⅝ to 1⅛ in. in ⅛-in. increments. The most
common  rods  in  use  will  meet  API  specifications  and  will  probably  be  in  25-ft  lengths.  The
most important selection requirement is that the pulling rig can accommodate single-, double-,
or triple-length rod segments.

The  API  does  not  specify  the  minimum  yield  strength  for  sucker  rods.  Where  the  yield
strength of a rod string is necessary in calculations, it is recommended that if the manufacturer
is not known, a minimum yield of 60,000 psi for Grade C and K and of 100,000 psi for Grade
D should be used. If the manufacturer and rod type are known, the actual yield-strength values
may be used. For good operating practices, the minimum yield strength should not be exceeded.
API RP 11BR29 provides industry recommendations on the selection and use of API-grade

rods.

11.4.2 Pony Rods.  Pony rods are sucker rods shorter than 25 ft, and they vary in length. They
are most commonly placed adjacent to the polished rod at the top of the rod string, on top of
the  downhole  pump  for  handling  purposes,  and  on  top  of  the  polished  rod  with  appropriate
couplings to prevent the string from falling downhole if the polished-rod clamp slips. Old pony
rods  normally  should  not  be  used  in  the  load-carrying  part  of  a  new  rod  strings.  Thus,  when
placing the rod string with new suckers, new pony rods should be used.

11.4.3 FRP Sucker Rods.  FRP sucker rods may be used instead of metal under certain condi-
tions. These rods are normally made from protruded fiberglass. They also are standardized in
size and performance by API Spec. 11B. Reviewing this standard shows that temperature, load
reversals, and fatigue life have a bigger effect on FRP rods than on steel rods. It is important
to keep the following in mind when screening a well for FRP-rod use:

• FRP-rod bodies will not corrode, but the rest of the steel components, including the fiber-
glass pin connectors and couplings, the steel rods making up the rest of the string, the pump,
tubing,  casing,  flowlines,  etc.,  still  have  to  be  protected  if  producing  a  corrosive  fluid.  Thus,
fiberglass rods should not be used alone to prevent rod-string corrosion or system failures or to
eliminate the need for an effective corrosion-inhibition program.

• FRP  rods  should  be  considered  when  the  pumping-unit  gear-reducer  torque  or  structure
rating exceed design limitation and need to be decreased. Reducing the weight of the sucker-
rod string reduces the torque measured at the polished rod. However, if the well is expected to
produce long term, it may be more cost effective to upsize the pumping unit.

• It should be determined if it will be possible to stroke the subsurface pump plunger be-

cause of the increased elasticity and effect on Sp.

• If the well deviation is very large at any point, the increased friction may cause buckling
and compressive stresses on the sucker rods. Increased buckling is very damaging to FRP rods;
thus, these probably should not be run in deviated wells.

• Allowing  fluid  or  gas  pounding  may  produce  damaging  compressive  forces  in  the  FRP

rods; thus, maximum drawdown is not possible.

Currently, there is no recognized formula for calculating overtravel when a mixed FRP and
steel rod string is used. An attempt was made by an API task group to try modifying API RP
11L30 to include a FRP-rod-string analysis, but this was not accepted by the industry. A study
of several FRP string-design analyses indicate that rod-string overtravel may be approximately
equal to the following:

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-475

3.1(S × N 2) / 70,500(LPSD / 1,000)2, ........................................... (11.4)

where S = stroke length, in.; N = pumping speed, spm; and LPSD = seating nipple/pump depth,
ft. This overtravel approximately equals twice the expected value when using steel sucker-rod
strings.

11.4.4 Non-API Sucker Rods.  Non-API sucker rods generally fall into two groups: one con-
tains rods with a higher strength than API Grade D, and the other contains rods made of alloys
that are less susceptible to corrosion or that have received a special heat treatment.

The high-strength group is generally harder and higher strength than Grade D and may be

more susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement and notch effects that may then decrease run life.

Those  rods  that  have  a  special  heat  treatment  or  are  made  of  special  alloys  are  normally
premium-priced items. Thus, a full economic analysis should be conducted and good operating
records obtained to determine if use of these rods is cost effective.

Flexible Strand.  Approximately 40 years ago, a top steel manufacturer experimented with
the use of plastic-coated wire cable instead of sucker rods. This cable was a continuous strand
that required special pulling equipment. Sufficient sinker bars or a special pull-down pump had
to  be  used  to  keep  any  compressive  force  from  acting  on  the  strand.  The  connectors  used  at
the pump or at the top of the sinker bars were the weakest portion of the flexible strand. If any
of  the  strands  furnished  the  weight  that  was  required  to  help  open  the  traveling  valve,  the
strands  immediately  above  the  sinker  bars  failed  in  short  order  because  of  the  compressive
forces.  This  type  of  rod  string  was  less  expensive  than  a  normal  API  steel  string  and  was
found useful for unloading gas wells. The biggest disadvantages that restricted the use of this
type of string were lack of service-company support and the inability to make field repairs.

Continuous Solid Rod (COROD*).  The advantage of this rod is its ability to pull the entire
rod string in one piece with a special pulling unit. These rods are available in either round or
elliptical  configurations  and  vary  in  size  from  
∕16
18 -in.  diameter.  The  disadvantages  in-
clude  the  need  for  a  special  wheeled  pulling  rig,  and  the  two  different  pulling  units  are
required  to  service  the  well  if  the  tubing  has  to  be  pulled.  There  is  some  concern  that  the
COROD’s heat treatment is not consistent throughout its length. This is especially problematic
if field welds are made and the rods are used in an inadequately protected corrosive environment.
A continuous strand of composite materials, called “ribbon rods,” was developed and field
tested.31  This  type  of  special  rod  contained  carbon  composite  with  a  polymer  wrap.  Despite
having high strength and a small cross-sectional area, it was expensive and ran into field sup-
port problems similar to those of flexible strands and CORODs.

“Electra”  Sucker  Rods.    Another  type  of  non-API  sucker  rod  is  the  Electra  (EL)**  rod.
These currently are available only in ¾-, ⅞-, and 1-in. diameters. They should be selected for
wells  in  which  operating  stresses  do  not  exceed  50,000  psi.  These  rods  have  a  special  heat
treatment that should put the surface in a compressive set. Thus, they could be used in a hydro-
gen sulfide (H2S) environment in which the strength of Grade C rods is exceeded. These rods
have been effectively used to produce approximately 150 BFPD from a depth of approximately
14,500 ft.

High-Strength,  Low-Alloy  Rods.    A  number  of  manufacturers  have  developed  higher-
strength  steel  rods  to  compete  with  other  specialty  rods.  These  rods  take  advantage  of  the
newer alloys and heat-treating procedures currently available and are based on American Iron
and Steel Inst. (AISI) 8630- or 4130-type steels, which have high tensile strengths. The tensile
strength is generally greater than 140,000 psi, while the yield strength is generally greater than

IV-476

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

100,000 psi; therefore, these rods could not be classified as API Grade D. The fine-grain heat
treatment done on these alloys theoretically should provide increased fatigue life. However, this
rod type may be more notch-sensitive and may require better handling and corrosion protection
than normal API-type rods.

As with any specialty equipment, good field testing and records for several years in which
good handling and operating practices were followed are required to prove the benefit for any
of these non-API rods.

11.4.5 Criteria for Rod-String Design.  Rod Stress.  In  a  noncorrosive  environment,  the  en-
durance  limit  of  steel  is  primarily  determined  by  the  maximum  stress,  the  range  of  stresses,
and the number of stress reversals. This is often illustrated by the use of a Goodman diagram,
as discussed in API RP 11BR.29 Derating, or service, factors also are discussed to allow poten-
tial  decreasing  of  the  load  range  for  different  service/corrosive  environments.  If  the  environ-
ment  is  corrosive  and  not  properly  treated,  the  sucker  rods  and  their  associated  downhole
equipment life is minimal. In such cases, corrosion-fatigue failures occur frequently in the rod
string.

Effectively  inhibited  systems  may  be  considered  noncorrosive,  which  would  limit  the  sur-
face pitting of the steel rods or components. However, in the presence of H2S and a corrosive
environment,  steel  may  become  susceptible  to  hydrogen  embrittlement/sulfide-stress  cracking.
Steels  that  have  a  Rockwell  C  hardness  greater  than  ≈  23  (Brinell  hardness  number  237)  are
susceptible  to  embrittlement.  The  harder  the  steel  is,  the  more  susceptible  it  becomes.  API
Grade C sucker rods normally have a Rockwell C hardness < 23, while API Grade D sucker
rods normally have a Rockwell C hardness > 23. Thus, API Grade D rods should be used with
caution  in  the  presence  of  hydrogen  sulfide.  Chemical  inhibition  may  not  prevent  embrittle-
ment. This results in a significantly decreased run life.

Stress  raisers  cause  areas  of  concentrated  stresses  and  may  be  caused  by  a  number  of
things.  Corrosion  pits  are  one  type  of  stress  raiser.  Stress  raisers  may  be  notches  caused  by
improper handling, tool cuts, bending, and subsequent cold straightening, for example, and may
also result from the manner in which the threads are formed on the rod pin (i.e., cutting vs. the
now-required  cold  rolling).  Corrosion  pits  may  have  rounded  or  notched  shape;  notch-shaped
pits are more serious and are more likely to occur in Grade D rods than in Grade C rods.

API RP 11BR recommends using the modified Goodman diagram for determining the allow-
able stress on API steel-grade sucker rods, while API Spec. 11B28 covers FRP rods. Manufac-
turers  of  non-API  rods  should  specify  the  rod’s  allowable  stress.  An  allowable  load  or  stress
curve should be developed to discern during the design of a rod string if it is overloaded, and
adjustments  should  be  made  to  prevent  this.  Recent  discussions  have  promoted  a  hyperbolic
relationship  for  allowable  load  using  the  Gerber  parabola,
 rather  than  a  straightline
relationship.32  This  loading  criterion,  coupled  with  cleaner  steels  and  better-quality  sucker-rod
manufacturing, should enable higher allowable loads to be applied to the rod strings, provided
that good sucker-rod handling practices are followed. Rod strings that are considered “overload-
ed” by more than 20%, according to the straightline method, have been successfully run in the
Permian Basin fields in the U.S.A. and provided adequate run time. Additionally, Ref. 30 dis-
cusses  the  need  to  reduce  the  allowable  load  or  stress  on  used  rods.  Recommendations  are
presented for derating based on the class of the inspected rod, according to the inspection-crite-
ria classes in API RP 11BR.

Rod-String Selection.  The primary factors affecting the selection and sizing of rods and the

rod system are as follows:

• Size of pump and tubing.
• Liquid viscosity and pourpoint.
• Kind of corrosion [e.g., H2S, carbon dioxide (CO2), or saltwater].

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-477

• Conditions for unseating the downhole pump.
• Pump setting depth.
• Production rate.
• Sand, paraffin, salt crystals, scale, foam, and GLR.
These factors should be considered when manual (according to API RP 11L30) or computer
design  calculations  are  performed  to  size  the  rod  string  and  the  related  production  equipment
for a specific well.

11.4.6 Size Designation.  Sucker-rod strings may be composed of a single size or may be ta-
pered, typically to include rods of two and three sizes. Using four or more sizes of rods in a
taper is not normally recommended. The primary factor determining the proportion of each size
of rod in the rod string is the size of the pump. However, typically only one grade of rod is
used in the string to avoid mixing during running and pulling operations.

API RP 11L contains recommended rod-string design data. The first column of Table I in
this reference contains the rod-string size designation. The first number in the column refers to
the largest rod size in the string, while the second number refers to the smallest rod size in the
string, both representing the size in eighths of an inch. An example rod number of 76 is a two-
way taper of ⅞- and  ∕8
6 -in. rods.

6 -in. rods. Rod number 86 is a three-way taper of  ∕8

8 -, ⅞-, and  ∕8

11.4.7 Pump Unseating.  Rod strings should be designed to enable the operator to unseat the
pump without yielding any rod in the rod string. The diameter of the pump plunger determines
the  fluid  load  lifted  during  the  pumping  cycle.  However,  the  ID  of  the  seating  nipple  deter-
mines  the  fluid  load  that  must  be  lifted  to  unseat  the  pump.  Friction  in  the  pump  holddown
plus sediments in the pump-tubing annulus increases the required pump-unseating force. How-
ever,  a  high  tubing-casing-annulus  fluid  level  decreases  the  load  on  the  rod  string  when
attempting  to  unseat  a  pump.  Normally,  the  pulling-rig  weight  indicators  are  not  accurate
enough to use as the only tool to prohibit yielding the sucker rods. The rod string’s stretch in
Table 4.1, Column 4, of API RP 11L, gives elastic constants (Er) for sucker rods that can be
used to indicate rod load.

The  top  rod  in  the  bottom  section  normally  has  the  highest  stress  in  the  string  because  it
has the smallest cross-sectional area. This is because it has to support the weight of the rest of
the small-diameter rod load, the pump and the very large fluid load on the gross seating nipple
area. The weak point in the string is this rod. A free-body diagram can be used to determine
the loads acting on this rod; an allowable unseating load or stretch can then be determined so
that the rods are not yielded or damaged when trying to unseat the pump.

11.4.8 To Taper or Not To Taper a Rod String.  Tapered  rod  strings  that  use  different  seg-
ments of different-sized rods are commonly used to save unnecessary weight and to distribute
the  loading  on  long  strings  of  rods  used  in  deep  wells.  The  proper  design  will  decrease  the
stress on the rods above the bottom section. This allows pumps to be run deeper than would be
possible if just one size of rod was run. Tapered rod strings can be operated at a higher pump-
ing  speed  (N)  than  straight  rod  strings.  This  may  reduce  the  required  pumping-unit  gearbox
size  and  increase  rod  stretch  because  stretch  is  proportional  to  rod-string  weight.  Thus,  more
production may be possible from the well with a tapered string than a straight string using the
same-diameter pump.

Ideally, a rod string should be a continuous taper from top to bottom. This is impractical,
not  only  because  of  the  manufacturing  difficulties  involved,  but  also  because  the  lower  rods
must have sufficient stiffness to support the entire string in the tubing if failures occur high up
in  the string. For  this reason, 75  to  85  strings are not normally recommended because, if  the
rod string parts high in the well, close to the surface, the ⅝-in. rods may be permanently dam-
aged when the upper rods fall on them. Coupled sucker rods come in diameter variations of ⅛

IV-478

in. With the introduction of the continuous sucker rod, the opportunity for a greater number of
tapers is possible because these rods may be manufactured in size variations of  ∕16
 in. or even
1
smaller.

The primary factor in determining the proportion of each size of rod in the rod string is the
size of the pump. Columns 6 through 11 in Table D.1 of API RP 11L contain the percentages
of the various sizes to be placed in a tapered rod string with various pump sizes. Before 1977,
percentages  were  calculated  so  that  the  unit  stress  on  the  top  rod  of  each  section  from  the
weight  of  the  rods  in  air  plus  the  weight  of  the  produced  fluids  on  the  gross  plunger  area  is
equal. This is calculated as a static load. Work done by API and Shell in 1977 resulted in the
percentages shown in API RP 11L. This work used the dynamic effects on the rod’s upstroke
and  downstroke,  along  with  assumed  pumping  speeds  for  varying  stroke  lengths.  Currently,
most operators and rod manufacturers have proprietary rod-string design programs that include
these data.

One  of  the  earliest  means  used  for  designing  tapered  sucker-rod  strings  is  in  the  Sucker
Rod Handbook.33 This design is based upon equal stress in the top of each size of rod, assum-
ing  a  static  condition  and  pumping  water  (specific  gravity  =  1.0)  with  the  well  pumped  off.
Buoyancy of the rod string is not taken into account. The recommendations in API RP 11L334
are based on the same assumptions. However, continued work suggested adopting a “modified-
stress” approach in which the stress from the dynamic loads at the top of each size of rod is
equalized.35,36  Computer  programs  are  available  to  perform  the  calculations  on  this  complex
process of assessing stress for various rod-string designs.

11.4.9 Rod Couplings.  API Spec. 11B28 contains requirements for the rod couplings, as well
as the rods, and recommends minimum tubing sizes. The current edition provides for two class-
es  of  couplings:  Class  T  (through  hardened  coupling)  has  a  Rockwell  C  hardness  range  of
minimum 16 and maximum 23, and Class SM (surface hardened) has a minimum Rockwell C
surface  hardness  of  50.  This  hardness  is  normally  accomplished  by  the  spray-metal  process.
Care  should  be  taken  when  recommending  the  SM  couplings,  even  though  they  have  longer
wear life than T couplings. Because of the increased hardness and lower coefficient of friction,
if  properly  surface  treated,  coupling-on-tubing  wear  is  transferred  from  the  rods—which  are
easy  and  less  expensive to  replace—to the  softer  tubing,  which  is  more  expensive to  replace.
Thus, while the SM couplings help to increase rod-string life, the tubing life may be decreased.
API Spec. 11B also standardizes “full-sized” coupling in both grades and a “slimhole” coupling
in Class T. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 from API Spec. 11B shows recommendations for the minimum
tubing sizes for the various couplings.

Slimhole  couplings  for  ⅝-  to  1-in.  rods  can  be  run  and  fished  in  one-size-smaller  tubing
than  the  respective  full-sized  coupling.  This  enables  operators  to  run  1-in.  rods  in  2⅞-in.-OD
tubing  and  ⅞-in.  rods  in  2⅜-in.-OD  tubing.  This  coupling  type,  however,  decreases  the  cou-
pling  area  available  for  supporting  the  pumping  loads.  Thus,  slimhole  couplings  are  not  as
strong as the full size. Original work by Gipson and Swaim5 recommended derating these cou-
plings  on  the  basis  of  the  assumption  that  the  1-in.  slimhole  coupling  has  an  acceptable
minimum decreased area. Further work by Hermanson37 using the area relationships and allow-
able strength of the different grades of steel rods resulted in different derating factors, shown
in Table 11.5. Additionally, these have been accepted by the industry and included in API RP
11BR.29 Note that the use of ⅞-in. slimhole couplings results in the highest derating factor for
all rod strengths and sizes.

11.4.10 Sucker-Rod Maintenance.  Well  equipment,  including  sucker  rods,  must  be  in  good
working  condition.  The  sucker-rod  string  is  often  highly  stressed  and  usually  fails  because  of
the repeated load reversals. Corrosion, scale, and paraffin deposits may accelerate such failures.
Tubing and rods will wear because of the reciprocating movement in the well caused by pound-

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-479

ing  fluid,  buckling  because  of  unanchored  tubing,  and/or  bad  wellbore  deviation  that  allows
contact.

Sucker-rod strings are lifting a great deal of weight every cycle. They are under stress on
both the downstroke and the upstroke. Combining this with the normally corrosive environmen-
tal  conditions  of  water,  H2S,  CO2,  etc.  may  mean  that  one  of  the  greatest  expenses  of  a
producing beam-pump system is replacing the sucker rods. Carrying out the various procedures
described in this section can greatly reduce operating costs and make production more efficient
and economical.

Care  and  Handling  of  Sucker  Rods.    Proper  running,  handling,  and  makeup  procedures
should be followed to secure maximum service from a rod string. API RP 11BR contains the
practices recommended by the industry.

Torque  measurement  has  been  discredited  as  a  sucker-rod-connection  makeup  method.
When  the  threads  are  properly  lubricated,  an  estimated  10%  of  the  applied  torque  turns  the
coupling relative to the pin, and 90% of the torque is consumed by friction. Any variation in
lubricants  or  in  the  surface  finish  of  the  threads  or  mating  surfaces  drastically  changes  these
percentages, indicating that torque could never be a precision makeup method for sucker rods.
API  RP  11BR  recommends  circumferential  displacement  (CD)  for  making  up  sucker-rod
joints, and it should also be used for calibrating power tongs. To make up a sucker-rod joint
using CD, the pin and coupling threads should be cleaned and lubricated with a lubricant that
has  passed  the  NACE  MR-01-74  screening  test.38  This  test  states  that  an  acceptable  lubricant
will allow the lubricated pin to be made up hand tight, then fully made up and broken out 10
times without galling the threads. A hand-tight position is attained when full shoulder abutment
is made and a 0.002-in.-thick feeler gauge cannot enter into this interface between the rod and
coupling face. The coupling should then be turned by the amount specified in API RP11BR or
by  the  rod  manufacturer,  relative  to  the  pin.  The  manufacturer  of  specialty  or  non-API  rods
should be consulted for their recommended CD values and makeup procedures.

Rod-String Equipment Failure.  The downhole production strings may fail for a variety of
reasons, some of which have been discussed previously. Steward39 and Moore40 discuss reasons
for common sucker-rod string failures and provide discussion and pictures of the failures. Addi-
tionally, Hermanson37 provides discussion and photographs of different rod failures. The follow-
ing is a summary of the normal rod-string equipment and typical reasons for failure:

• Polished rods.
  - Not in center of tee throughout pumping cycle.
  - Smaller than recommended by API.
  - Top of carrier bar not horizontal.
  - Crooked—not vertical—wellhead.
  - Crooked hole near surface, with pony rods below the polished rod.

11.4.11 String Replacement.  Replacing a rod string one rod at a time is not normally a good
operating practice; thus, the economic life of a rod string needs to be considered if rods start to
fail. Typically, the rod-string section will be replaced after two or three failures, while the en-
tire  rod  string  may  be  replaced  after  three  or  four  failures.  However,  the  reasons  for  failures
need to be investigated and the root cause for this failure must be determined to extend the rod
life in the future.

An SPE paper by Powers41 considers the factors that enter into the decision about when to
replace the entire rod string after sustaining the calculated number of failures. Usually, wells of
the same type in a field can be grouped together and the necessary calculations do not have to
be  performed  for  each  well.  Sufficient  calculations  need  to  be  done  to  assess  the  economic
impact for all wells in a field.

11.5 Miscellaneous Subsurface Equipment

11.5.1 Tubing.  The chapter on tubing selection, design, and installation from this Handbook
provides detailed information on the design, selection, and use of tubing for production wells.
As related to most sucker-rod-lifted wells, the standard weight of external-upset-end, API tub-
ing42  should  be  used  because  of  the  increased  wall  thickness  in  the  threaded  ends.  Thus,  if
there  is  rod  coupling-on-tubing  wear,  more  life  and  fewer  leaks  will  be  realized  than  if
nonupset API tubing is used. Using API Grade J55 tubing, consider full-body normalizing after
upsetting to prevent “ringworm corrosion” in the heat-affected upset region when the tubing is
placed  in  corrosive  (H2S  or  CO2)  service.  If  the  production  application  is  noncorrosive,  then
this extra heat treatment may not be required.

Tables 4.1 and 4.2 from API Spec. 11B28 include minimum tubing size for each size of full-
sized and slimhole rod couplings. There should be sufficient clearance between the tubing and
the rod box for fishing tools.

The  yield  strength  of  the  tubing  must  be  sufficient  to  support  the  weight  of  the  tubing  in
air, the weight of the rods and of the fluid in the tubing, plus an overpull allowance that will
allow  the  tubing  to  be  pulled.  Normally,  API  Grade  J55  is  acceptable  for  most  rod-pumped
wells to a depth of approximately 9,500 ft. However, with greater well depths and higher pro-
duction rates, API Grade N80 or L80 (if H2S is present) and, in some cases, P110 should be
considered.

It  is  recommended  that  API  tubulars  be  drifted  to  ensure  equipment  can  be  run  without

problems.

Thread  dope  must  be  used  on  API  tubing  threads  to  keep  the  joints  from  leaking,  but  it
does  not  have  an  infinite  life.  If  collar-  or  tubing-connection  leaks  begin  to  appear  in  tubing
strings, it may be necessary to remove all collars (if applicable), clean the threads on the tub-
ing  and  the  collar  or  upset  connection,  and  apply  new  thread  dope.  Additionally,  tubing  that
has  been  in  storage  should  at  least  be  visually  inspected,  and  the  threads  cleaned  and  freshly
doped, following API recommendations, before running.

Most wells will be able to use normal torque makeup requirements for tubing. A guideline
for appropriate makeup of oil-country tubular goods is found in API RP 5 C1.43 This RP also
includes care and handling along with running casing and tubing information.

Hydraulic  testing  of  tubulars  in  the  well  will  determine  only  whether,  under  that  circum-
stance,  the  tubing  and  couplings  are  leak  free.  Once  the  well  is  put  back  on  pump,  rod-on-
tubing  wear  may  reduce  the  wall  thickness,  causing  a  split.  Additionally,  hydrotesting  itself

contact.

may  provide  sufficient  pressure  to  fail  a  worn  tubular  that  may  have  had  acceptable  pressure
retention to handle the pumping pressures. Thus, if tubing wear is a problem, downhole tubing-
caliper  surveys  or  surface  tubular  inspection  should  be  done  to  separate  unacceptably  worn
tubing before it leaks. Fig. 11.6 presents an example of a downhole tubing-caliper survey.44 It
should be noted that the major wear is approximately midway between rod couplings because
of rod buckling from pounding fluid. The chart also shows that there was wear caused by the
couplings themselves contacting and wearing the tubing.

New  developments  have  been  made  in  using  internally  plastic-lined  tubing  in  rod-pumped
wells. Such tubing has been beneficial in preventing erosion at the pump discharge and/or wear
along the inside of the tubing.45 One west Texas operator dramatically reduced the field failure
frequency  from  0.42  to  less  than  0.25  in  the  Howard  Glasscock  field46,47  by  running  full  and
partial strings and, in many cases, just a few joints of this poly-lined tubing on the bottom of
the  tubing  string.  Monitoring  of  these  lined  tubing  joints  should  continue  to  ensure  that  the
liner does not wear or degrade with time.

The failure frequency is a dimensionless number found by dividing the total downhole well
failures by the total number of producing wells in a field. This failure frequency can be further
described by dividing the number of sucker-rod, tubing, or pump failures in a year by the total
number of sucker-rod-lifted wells to determine which equipment is causing the most failures in
the field. Similar calculations can be done for other lift methods that are used in the field.

11.5.2 Tubing-Anchor Catchers (TACs).  Tubing  anchors  are  used  to  prevent  movement  of
the tubing during the pumping cycle. Fig. 11.7 shows an example of the recommended mechan-
ical-type  TAC  for  rod-pumped  wells.  During  pump  operation,  part  of  the  fluid  load  is  trans-
ferred from the tubing to the sucker rods, alternately. This causes the tubing to elongate on the
downstroke when it supports the fluid load and to shorten when the rods carry the fluid load
on the upstroke. This action shortens the effective plunger stroke and decreases the pump dis-
placement. This load transfer also causes helical buckling in the bottom portion of the tubing
string, which, in turn, causes additional rod-on-tubing wear. The recommended TAC has two-
way slips; these prevent parted tubing from falling in addition to preventing movement during
the pumping cycle.

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-483

IV-484

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Tubing anchors are normally placed within 30 to 100 ft above the pump’s seating nipple.
The tubing is set in the surface hanger with tension equal to the sum of the tensions required
to overcome the stretch because of load transfer, helical buckling, the anticipated temperature
change between producing the shut-in conditions, and the change in fluid level. A calculation
procedure  from  the  manufacturer  should  be  followed  to  properly  set  the  TAC  “total  stretch,”
rather  than  pounds  of  pull  from  the  rig.  Further  consideration  should  be  given  for  adequate
settings,  if  the  downhole  pump  diameter  exceeds  the  tubing  diameter,  as  in  the  case  of  over-
sized  tubing  pumps  (sometimes  called  casing  pumps).  When  this  occurs,  the  normal  applied
stretch  or  load  for  the  tubing  has  shown  to  be  inadequate,  requiring  increased  stretch-setting
inches.

This equipment can be difficult to remove; thus, care should be taken using a TAC in wells
having  scale,  heavy  paraffin,  sand  production,  and/or  bad  casing.  The  TAC  release  method
should be considered before this equipment is installed.

Several  of  the  tubing  anchors  available  have  shear  pins  to  release  the  slips  if  the  normal
releasing  mechanism  fails.  Varying  the  material  type  and  number  of  shear  pins  can  vary  the
amount of necessary pull; this is called the “shear-out value.” The tubing must have sufficient
yield strength to support the weight of the tubing in air, the weight of the rods, and the weight
of the fluid in the tubing as well as to shear the pins left in the tubing anchor. These factors
will limit the pumping depth to which a TAC can be used. However, the running depth can be
increased  with  stronger  tubing  and/or  tapered  tubing  strings  and  with  the  required  minimum
strength and number of shear pins. Care should be used to ensure that the design shear out or
production  loads  do  not  exceed  the  tubing-grade  yield  strength.  If  this  possibility  exists,  the
tubing should be cut rather than pulled apart.

11.5.3 Tubing Rotators.  Tubing rotators may be used to spread tubing wear because of rods
and/or  rod  couplings  around  the  entire  diameter  instead  of  being  concentrated  in  one  spot.
They  may  be  used  in  conjunction  with  rod  rotators  to  even  out  the  wear  on  both  the  tubing
and rod coupling.

Tubing  rotators  come  in  more  than  one  size.  The  manufacturer  should  be  consulted  when
selecting these items to ensure the rotators purchased are sufficiently strong for the particular
job. In most cases, the use of a TAC, coupled with rod centralizer and possibly a rod rotator,
will prevent sufficient wear such that a tubing rotator is not required.

11.5.4 Sinker Bars.  A  sinker  (or  heavy-weight)  bar  is  normally  a  special  steel  bar  or  large-
diameter  sucker  rod  placed  directly  above  the  downhole  pump.  Such  bars  may  be  used
polished rods or a rod specifically standardized by API Spec. 11B.

During the pumping cycle, these bars help to open the traveling valve because a portion of
the pressure required to open the valve on the downstroke must be obtained from the weight of
the sucker-rod string pushing down on the top of the plunger. This places the lower portion of
the rod string in reduced tension. Rod buckling will result unless properly sized and centralized
sinker bars are used immediately above the pump to provide the additional needed weight. Sucker-
rod  buckling  will  cause  excessive  rod-  and/or  coupling-on-tubing  wear  above  the  pump.  The
buckling at the bottom of the rod string also may cause premature valve-rod or pull-tube fail-
ures.  Overall,  there  are  a  number  of  advantages  for  using  sinker  bars  in  a  sucker-rod  string,
which may include the following:

• Keeps tension on the sucker-rod string.
• Increases the minimum polished-rod load.
• Decreases polished-rod horsepower (HP).
• Decreases low tubing leaks.
• Decreases valve-rod or pull-tube pump failures if caused by buckling or bending.
• Increased production.

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-485

• Overall decrease in operating costs.
There also are disadvantages from using sinker bars, including the following:
• Creates added mechanical problems when the production equipment is allowed to pound

fluid more than one-quarter of the way down on the downstroke.

• Increases operating expense if purpose-manufactured rods are purchased.
• Inadequate coupling makeup and pounding fluid can cause the connection to unscrew, if

polished rods are used.

The theoretical sinker-bar weight required in a rod string depends on the specific gravity of
the  produced  fluids,  the  size  and  type  of  downhole  pump,  the  associated  valve-seat  contact
area, and the depth of the well. There are differing thoughts on the minimum amount of sinker
bars  required.  Some  operating  companies  and  sinker-bar  manufacturers  use  a  weight  equal  to
the  buoyant  weight  of  the  rod  string  in  the  produced  fluid.  Others  use  only  20%  of  the  well
depth  or  no  sinker  bars—only  a  few  sucker-rod  centralizers  or  guides  near  the  bottom.  Some
operating companies use a sinker-bar factor (SBF) for the various types of pumps. Gipson and
Swaim developed the SBF for stationary barrel pumps in the “Beam Pumping Fundamentals”
(April 1969) and published them in Ref. 7. Traveling-barrel pumps normally have a traveling
valve one size larger than stationary barrel pumps; thus, these SBFs need to be increased.

The SBF process is to determine the theoretical weight of sinker bars in the produced flu-
ids.  Then,  20%  of  this  theoretical  weight  is  the  recommended  starting  point  for  the  actual
weight or length of sinker bars used to replace the lowest rods in a rod string. This was recom-
mended because sinker bars act dynamically to help valve action and to help keep the rods in
tension. Once sinker bars are run, an optimization to increase the number of bars or weight can
be conducted. However, there is a minimum point of benefit at which adding more sinker bars
will not provide the useful dynamic effects. When this occurs, the extra bars or weight will be
detrimental to rod-string loading.

An SBF summary for the theoretical weight for the various-diameter stationary and travel-
ing barrel pumps is presented in Table 11.6. With these values, the recommended starting sinker-
bar weight is as follows:

SBW(20 % ) = SBF × 0.433 × L × G × 0.20. ...................................... (11.5)

The resulting sinker-bar weight to install is as follows:

IV-486

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

SBW(in fluid) = SBW(20 % ) / (1 – 0.128 × G), ..................................... (11.6)

where  LPSD  =  seating  nipple  depth,  ft,  and  G  =  specific  gravity  of  the  combined  fluid  in  the
tubing.7

11.5.5 Rod Centralizers.  Sucker-rod centralizers also may be called paraffin scrapers or rod
guides.  They  keep  the  rods  and  couplings  away  from  the  tubing  to  decrease  wear.  However,
special  mechanical  paraffin  scrapers  have  been  developed  to  also  aid  in  keeping  paraffin  off
the tubing and most of the sucker-rod length.

Rod centralizers with full-bore-fluted centralizers should be placed on or between the pump-
handling pony rod, the sinker bars used above the pump, and the first two sucker rods above
the sinker bars. Rod centralizers in these locations help stabilize the pump and valve rod and
prevent valve-rod bending or breakage. When a tubing anchor is not used, rod centralizers will
reduce  tubing  wear  because  of  tubing  helical  buckling  on  the  upstroke.  Rod  centralizers  also
may be used in crooked holes in which there are areas of concentrated tubing wear.

11.5.6 Sucker-Rod-Guide Placement.  When  setting  rod  guides,  it  is  necessary  to  determine
the correct spacing when the tubing anchor is set several hundred feet above the seating nipple
or when a TAC is not run. It is recommended as a starting point to use the Lubinski curve to
determine guide spacing; Fig. 11.8 provides the minimum guide-spacing curves for 2- and 2½-
in. tubing.

The  formulas  for  determining  the  distance  that  unanchored  tubing  will  buckle  above  the

seating nipple are as follows:

•

•

•

For 2 ∕8

3 -in.-OD API tubing, buckling distance = Fo / 4.1 ft, .................. (11.7)

For 2 ∕8

7 -in.-OD API tubing, buckling distance = Fo / 5.7 ft, .................. (11.8)

For 3 ∕2

1 -in.-OD API tubing, buckling distance = Fo / 8.1 ft, .................. (11.9)

where Fo = 0.34 × G × D2 × H, which is the fluid load on the gross plunger area, G = specific
gravity  of  the  mixed  fluid  in  the  tubing  string,  D  =  pump-plunger  diameter,  and  H  =  pump-
seating depth in ft.

Example. As an example problem, solve the following:
Given: tubing = 2⅞-in. OD API, D = 1.50 in. (pump plunger diameter), L = H = 8,000 ft
(pump-seating-nipple depth and assumed pumped-off fluid level), and G = 1.03 (specific gravi-
ty  of  the  liquid  in  the  tubing).  A  TAC  is  to  be  set  at  7,450  ft,  which  is  15  ft  above  the  top
casing perforation.

Find: (a) the buckling distance and (b) the recommended spacing for sucker-rod guides.
Solution.
1. buckling distance = Fo / 5.7 = [0.34 × 1.03 × (1.5) × 8,000] / 5.7 = 6,304 / 5.7 = 1,106

ft.

2. Fig.  11.8  indicates  that  when  the  neutral  point  is  1,106  ft  above  the  seating  nipple,  the
first guides should be approximately 15 ft apart, or approximately two guides are recommend-
ed per 25-ft-long sucker rod in 2⅞-in. OD.

In  summary,  there  will  be  8,000  –  7,450  =  550  ft  from  the  seating  nipple  to  the  anchor.
The  anchor  will  be  1,106  –  550  =  556  ft  below  the  neutral  point.  Fig.  11.8  indicates  that
guides should not be less than 25 ft apart until approximately 380 ft below the neutral point;

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-487

Fig. 11.8—Minimum recommended number of rod guides per rod that may buckle for normal sucker-rod-
lift production tubing.

therefore, it is recommended that two guides be placed on each 25-ft-long sucker rod, between
the seating nipple at 8,000 ft and the TAC at 7,450 ft. This is the minimum number of guides
per rod.

If continued rod and/or coupling-on-tubing wear is a problem, more centralizers should be
considered. Wellbore deviation is one of the biggest problems for sucker-rod-lifted wells. If the
deviation is 0 to 3°/100 ft, there should be no pumping problem. A deviation of 3 to 5°/100 ft
is  a  bearable  problem,  and  it  usually  can  be  handled  by  properly  locating  the  rod  guides.  A
deviation greater than 5°/100 ft is a definite problem. An increased number of guides per rod,

IV-488

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

tubing  anchors,  and/or  special  roller  rod  guides  may  be  necessary  within  the  local  deviation
region.

11.5.7 Rod-Centralizer Types and Materials.  There are two main types of sucker-rod central-
izers: field installable or molded on. The field-installable guides can be hammered on, twisted
on, or (with two pieces) slid together on the rod. Usually, these field-installable guides do not
grip  the  rod  area  very  well;  thus,  they  do  not  stay  where  they  are  required.  However,  guide
manufacturers continue to develop these field installable guides to increase their holding pow-
er. A word of caution is necessary, especially with the field-installable guides, to make sure the
rods are slowly run in or out of the well to decide if a wellhead running guide is necessary.

Molded-on rod guides are the recommended type, especially for new sucker rods, if contin-
ued rod coupling/tubing wear is a problem. This type of guide is also recommended if the well
is allowed to pound fluid or if the well-servicing contractor is not properly trained to run rods
with field-installable guides.

There are varieties of materials that can be used for rod centralizers, including steel paraf-
fin  scrapers.  However,  most  guides  and  scrapers  are  elastomers,  including  rubber,  nylon,
isobutyl, Ryton PPS (polyphenylene sulfide),* a nylon composite, and a high-density polyethy-
lene.  Guide  manufacturers  continue  to  develop  new  guide  materials  that  will  provide  the
needed centralizing capabilities, rod-gripping strength, long wear life, and ability to function in
increasingly  hostile  downhole  environments.  All  these  materials  have  chemical  compatibility,
temperature, and applied-stress limitations. The manufacturer should be consulted for their rec-
ommended service limitations.

11.5.8 Paraffin Scrapers.  Mechanical scrapers fastened to the rod string through the zone of
paraffin deposition (normally near the surface) have been used to keep the tubing and most of
the rod bodies free of paraffin. Paraffin-scraper systems have proved to be effective in reduc-
ing,  if  not  eliminating,  hot-oiling  or  watering  treatments  in  both  Canada  and  in  the  U.S.
Additionally,  a  Canadian  operator  has  shown  that,  along  with  the  mechanical  scraper  system,
internal plastic tubing coating has been beneficial in preventing paraffin buildup.48 However, it
is recommended that paraffin scrapers be used only when necessary.

11.6 Sucker-Rod Pumping Units
Many  devices  are  connected  to  the  downhole  sucker-rod  equipment  through  the  polished  rod
on the surface that imparts the reciprocating motion to the rod string and pump. In the history
of sucker-rod pumping, a standalone, surface-pumping unit has become the proven technology.
Many pumping-unit types are commercially available. Those most widely used have a walking
beam  as  the  horizontal  load-bearing  element  and  a  sampson  post  that  vertically  supports  the
beam.  These  terminologies  and  configurations  were  adapted  from  the  cable-tool  drilling  rigs
used to drill early oil wells and developed into the conventional pumping unit.

API  has  standardized  the  design,  terminology,  and  many  components  used  for  pumping
units  in  API  Spec.  11E.49  ISO  accepted  the  use  of  this  standard  as  a  base  to  fast  track  the
publication of ISO Standard 10431.50 Currently, these are comparable standards and cover the
two main components making up a pumping unit: the gear reducer and the structure. They are
standardized separately because the gear-reducer manufacturer may be separate from the struc-
tural manufacturer, who would be responsible for the assembly.

11.6.1 Unit Designation.  A pumping unit results when the gear reducer and the structure are
combined together. These units have a size rating that describes the unit’s capacities with the

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-489

reducer rating, maximum structural capacity, and the maximum stroke length. The reducer num-
ber  is  the  maximum  torque  rating  in  lbf-in.  divided  by  1,000.  The  structure  number  is  the
maximum load normally on the beam in lbf divided by 100, while the maximum stroke length
is in inches. This results in a three-number hyphenated description that ranges from 6.4-21-24
to 3,648-470-300 for the 77 possible standardized units. These describe the smallest unit with a
6,400-lbf-in. reducer, a 2,100-lbf structure capacity, and 24-in. stroke to the largest unit with a
3,648,000-lbf-in.  reducer,  47,000-lbf  structure,  and  300-in.  stroke.  However,  not  all  of  these
unit sizes are available from all manufacturers in all the possible structural geometries.

The commercially available units are further described by adding the structural type or ge-

ometry and possibly the type of gear reducer [single (no letter) or double (D)]. Normally,

• B is for a beam-balanced conventional unit.
• C is for a conventional crank-balanced unit.
• A is for an air-balanced unit.
• M is for a Mark II* unit.
• RM is for Reverse Mark* unit.
An example designation for a conventional, crank-balanced pumping unit with a 456,000-lbf-
in. double-reduction-gear reducer, a 30,500-lbf structure, and a maximum stroke length of 168
in. would be C456D-305-168.

Manufacturers should be contacted for their normal availability, special designs, sizes, and
types of units they sell. However, Table 11.7 shows the minimum and maximum size ranges
commercially available from a large U.S. manufacturer.51

11.6.2 Gear Reducer.  There are 18 gear-reducer sizes currently included in API Spec. 11E.49
The  size  range  is  from  6.4-  to  3,648-  or  6,400-  to  3,648,000-lbf-in.  capacity.  Table  11.8
presents the various sizes and capacities of available API gear reducers. When these gear reduc-
ers  are  put  in  their  operating  enclosure  and  attached  to  a  pumping-unit  structure,  then  this
equipment  is  normally  called  a  gearbox.  Pumping  units  typically  use  single-  or  double-reduc-
tion gearing, with an approximate 30:1 speed reduction from the prime-mover to the pumping
speed.

The standards also include chain reducers that use sprockets and chains for transmitting the
prime-mover speed through the structure to the rod string. These are available as single-, dou-
ble-, and triple-reduction drives. While this is still a possible reducer design, they are limited
in capacity and are not normally used.

11.6.3 Gear Ratings for Speed and Life.  Sucker-rod  pumping  units  can  be  operated  over  a
range  of  pumping  speeds.  It  has  been  recognized that there is  a  need  for  a  nominal pumping

IV-490

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

speed to rate the various gear reducers. Originally, the industry adopted a nominal speed of 20
spm. This assumed that the up and down stroke of a unit forms one complete stroke cycle.

In 1981, API Spec. 11E was revised and reduced the rating speed for the 456- and larger-
sized  reducers,  as  shown  in  Table  11.9.  The  reduced  speed  setting  was  done  because  it  was
not  practical  to  expect  larger  gearboxes  to  operate  at  20  spm  with  longer  stroke  lengths  and
larger-sized structures. In actuality, industrial applications with these similar-sized reducers can
be operated from 580 to 1,750 rpm. American Gear Manufacturer’s Association (AGMA) Stan-
dard 422.03,52 which is the basis for API Spec. 11E, limits the speed of the reducer to either
the pitch-line velocity of any stage to 5,000 ft/min and/or the speed of any shaft to less than
3,600 rpm.

It should be noted that none of the industry standards from API, ISO, or AGMA53 address
a required reducer life; however, the operating rule of thumb is an expected 20 to 25 years of
life.  This  assumes  the  gearbox  is  not  overloaded  or  abused  and  is  properly  maintained.  One
pumping unit manufacturer has developed a graph (shown in Fig. 11.9) depicting the effect on

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-491

Fig. 11.9—Effect of overloading pumping-unit gear reducers on expected life.

gearbox  life  from  overloading  the  gearbox  capacity.*  This  shows  that,  while  current  API  de-
signed  and  manufactured  reducers  may  be  overloaded  without  catastrophic  failure,  depending
on the amount of overload, the expected life should be reduced.

AGMA  Standard  2001-C9553  provides  a  way  to  calculate  tooth  stress  that  should  provide
satisfactory  operation  for  a  reasonable  time.  If  the  existing  calculations  are  used  and  worked
backwards  to  calculate  the  life  of  an  acceptable  design,  then  a  reducer  life  of  more  than  4  ×
108 cycles should be expected at the rated torque load. This would result in a life—assuming a
constant 10-spm pumping-unit speed for every day of the year—of more than 76 years. Howev-
er, this still assumes proper gear-reducer installation, operation, and maintenance.

11.6.4 Standard Structures.  The industry standards for pumping units have developed mini-
mum  requirements  for  the  design  and  manufacture  of  the  various  structured  components—the
beams, shafting, hanger, brakes, horsehead, cranks, and bearings. The four main standard pump-
ing-unit structural geometries covered by API Spec. 11E are as follows:

• Rear-mounted geometry, Class I lever systems with crank counterbalance.
• Front-mounted geometry, Class III lever systems with crank counterbalance.
• Front-mounted geometry, Class III lever systems with air counterbalance.
• Rear-mounted geometry, Class I lever systems with phased-crank counterbalance.
These standardized structures are more widely known by the respective designations: con-
ventional, Mark II, air balanced, and Reverse Mark. There are variations of these geometries,
such  as  for  slant  wells  or  as  low  profile  for  overhead  irrigated  fields.  Additionally,  there  are
special  geometries  or  structures  that  are  based  on  hydraulics,  pneumatics,  or  belts.  Because
these  structures  are  not  covered  by  industry  standards,  it  is  recommended  that  these  special
units are designed properly, manufactured to industry quality standards, and installed and oper-
ated according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

11.6.5 Unit  Selection.    There  have  been  many  publications  about  the  advantages,  disadvan-
tages,  and  selection  of  the  various  standard  geometries  and  the  specialty  pumping  units,
including the following:

• Theoretical development of torque factors and pumping unit “kinematics.”2,4,30,49,54

• Description of geometries, applications, and efficiencies for standard units.1–11,55–71
• Specialty hydraulic, strand, pneumatic, and long-stroke pumping units.1–5,11,72–89
The  following  paragraph  provides  a  brief  summary  and  comparison  of  the  four  standard

pumping units.

The conventional unit is probably the unit used most often. It is simple to install, has the
widest  range  of  sizes  available,  usually  has  lower  operating  costs  than  other  units,  needs  no
hoisting equipment or rigid supports for changing stroke length, and can run faster in wells in
which free fall limits pumping speed. The maximum pumping speed for the conventional unit
in an average well is estimated at 70% of the maximum free fall of rods in air. This compares
with 63% for air-balanced units and 56% for Mark II units. The free-fall speed is defined for
the conventional unit by the following formula:

spm = 0.7(60,000 / S in in.)0.5............................................... (11.10)

The free-fall speed is reduced by 10 and 20% for the air-balanced and Mark II units, respec-
tively.  This  means  that  in  a  well  with  average  friction  and  a  100-in.  polished-rod  stroke,  the
rods  will  fall  a  maximum  of  17.15  spm  with  a  conventional  unit,  15.43  spm  with  an  air-bal-
anced  unit,  and  13.72  spm  for  the  Mark  II.  However,  there  should  be  no  separation  between
the  carrier  bar  of  the  unit  and  the  polished-rod  clamp  during  the  downstroke.  These  speeds
would  be  further  reduced  in  wells  with  increased  friction  from  composite-ring-type  plungers,
deviated  holes,  particulates  sticking  the  downhole  pump,  and/or  very  viscous  crude.  Further-
more,  the  conventional  unit’s  geometry  allows  either  clockwise  or  counterclockwise  rotation.
This may be beneficial for gear teeth that are damaged in one direction from poor operation or
maintenance  and  may  enable  rotating  in  the  opposite  direction.  This  would  extend  the  life  of
the gearbox.

Air-balanced units use a leverage system different from conventional units. The use of com-
pressed air instead of heavy, cast-iron counterweights allows more-accurate fingertip control of
the counterbalance, which can be adjusted without stopping the unit. With no counterweights,
the unit weighs much less than a comparably sized conventional unit. It also has a lighter sub-
structure and a slightly lighter beam. Thus, there are several advantages to its compact size and
light  weight,  especially  for  portable  test  units  and  for  use  on  offshore  platforms.  It  also  uses
more  degrees  of  crank  travel  to  complete  the  first  one-half  of  the  upstroke,  which  tends  to
decrease the peak load. This is a slight advantage if rod fatigue is a problem. However, there
are increased maintenance problems or concerns, especially with leakage past the piston, which
may  make  it  difficult  to  maintain  the  proper  air  pressure.  Additionally,  the  leakage  also  may
cause  an  oil  spray  and  resulting  environmental  consideration.  Further,  water  condensation  in
the air system may cause damage if it is allowed to freeze, unless proper antifreeze is used.

The Mark II unit has an equalizer bearing between the Samson post and the well load. The
equalizer bearing is located ahead or to the well side of the centerline of the slow-speed shaft.
This is different from the air-balanced unit in which the equalizer bearing is directly over the
slow-speed shaft. The equalizer bearing location results in an upstroke of approximately 195°
and  a  downstroke  of  165°.  This  makes  a  slower  upstroke  with  20%  less  acceleration,  which
results in reduced peak polished-rod load. The slower upstroke also allows more time for vis-
cous fluids to fill the pump barrel and can increase the pump’s volumetric efficiency, but this
requires the unit to operate only in the counterclockwise rotation.

While  comparably  sized  Mark  II  units  are  heavier  and  more  expensive  than  conventional
units, the claimed torque reductions may make it possible to use a Mark II unit one size small-
er  than  required  for  a  conventional  unit.  However,  these  units  should  not  be  used  when  high
pumping  speeds  or  undertravel-type  dynamometer  cards  are  anticipated  and/or  there  are
crooked or deviated wells. When an undertravel card or a card that showed neither undertravel

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-493

nor overtravel is developed, the conventional or Reverse Mark unit has a better-suited permissible-
load diagram.

The Reverse Mark unit is classified as a rear-mounted geometry, Class I lever system with
phased-crank counterbalance. The phased cranks improve load-lifting capabilities; thus, like the
Mark II, this unit may enable a one-size-smaller gear reducer than a conventional unit. Howev-
er,  this  rule  of  thumb  needs  to  be  tempered  by  the  actual  pumping  parameters  and  resulting
dynamometer-card shape. Furthermore, the phase crank also makes this a unidirectional unit.

The other specialty units have their own advantages and disadvantages that may be consid-
ered if the standard units are not capable of meeting production-design requirements. Regard-
less  of  which  unit  is  selected,  a  full-cycle  economic  consideration  should  be  conducted  to
compare the costs for purchase, installation, maintenance, operation, repairs, failure frequency,
and resale value. These parameters should all be considered, along with the capability of pro-
ducing the required fluid volume from the required well depth, to decide which unit would be
best for a particular well.

11.6.6 Sizing.  There have been a variety of methods for determining the required reducer size
for  a  pumping  unit,  including  the  “approximate  method,”  “engineering  analysis,”  and
kinematics.2,4–7,30,49,64 Today, most engineers/operators who select the pumping unit will rely on
the output from a rod-string-design program that calculates the peak torque at the polished rod.
These are based on the API RP 11L30 method and the extension to wave equations that allow
geometries  other  than  the  conventional  unit  to  be  considered.  Because  these  calculations  pro-
vide  peak  torques  at  the  polished  rod,  the  torque  has  to  be  transmitted  through  the  structure
and its bearings to the gearbox. However, because these bearings are not 100% efficient, Gip-
son and Swaim7 developed curves for selecting the gearbox to account for these inefficiencies;
Fig.  11.10  shows  the  loss  of  efficiency  curves  for  both  new  and  used  units.  Typically,  this
requires a gearbox approximately 10 or 20% larger in capacity than the peak torque calculated
at the polished rod for new or used units, respectively. Once the design’s peak-torque capacity
is  determined,  then  the  closest  available,  but  higher-rated,  reducer  should  be  selected.  The
beam should be selected on the basis of the calculated peak polished-rod load from the rod-string-
design program. Finally, the unit stroke length should be selected on the basis of the required
pump capacity with a 10 to 20% production cushion.

Specialty pumping units and the required reducer, structural capacity, and the desired stroke

length should be discussed with the manufacturer to guarantee unit performance.

11.6.7 Installation,  Operation,  and  Maintenance  of  Pump  Units.    Many  publications  have
been  issued  on  the  installation,
 and  lubrication  of  pumping
units.5,6,90–101 These papers have been incorporated into API RP 11G1102 to reflect the minimum
recommended  practices  considered  for  installation,  operation,  and  lubrication  of  the  pumping
unit. Additionally, manufacturers of the units may have their own documents and recommend-
ed procedures for installation, operation, and maintenance that should be followed.

11.6.8 Guards.  Properly guarding a pumping unit is of critical importance. The industry stan-
dard, American National Standard Institute (ANSI)/API RP 11ER,103 should be followed when
guarding  the  pumping  unit,  V-belts,  sheaves,  flywheels,  cranks,  counterweights,  and  moving
parts on pumping units. Major pumping-unit manufacturers are also excellent sources of guid-
ance on guarding and can usually supply guards that will meet specific regulatory requirements.

11.7 Prime Movers

11.7.1 Introduction.  The  prime  mover  (PM)  rotates  the  gear-reducer  gears  through  a  V-belt
drive.  The  two  most  common  PMs  are  electric  motors  and  internal-combustion  (IC)  engines.

IV-494

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 11.10—Derating recommendations for standardized pumping-unit gear reducers based on sucker-
rod-string predictions and available or selected gearbox.

The decision concerning which to use depends on a variety of considerations, which includes
the following:

• Availability of the power source (electricity or combustible fluid).
• HP required to pump the well.
• Efficiency of the system.
• Ability to control the PM to match the on/off potential operation of the pumping unit.
• Availability  of  field  and/or  service  personnel  capable  of  maintaining  and  repairing  the

equipment.

• Condition  of  the  gas  (sweet  or  sour)  or  availability  now  and  in  the  future  of  the  gas  or

liquids (i.e., propane or diesel) if an IC engine is used.

• Current and future expected cost for the power source.
• Anticipated  full-cycle  total  cost  (including  initial  capital,  operating,  maintenance,  down-

time, and repairs) for the duration of the well.

These  considerations,

 as  well  as  other  factors,

 have  been  discussed  in  numerous

publications.1–6,104–107

11.7.2 Engines.  There are three common types of gas engines used for beam pumping units:
two-cycle,  slow-speed  engine;  four-cycle,  slow-speed  engine;  and  four-cycle,  high-speed  en-
gine.  The  characteristics  of  these  engines  are  summarized  here,  and  the  detailed  comparisons
and field experiences have been published elsewhere.108,109

Two-cycle, slow-speed engine (less than 750 rpm):
• A minimum number of moving parts.

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-495

• Rugged, heavy-duty construction.
• A  heavy  flywheel  that  provides  comparatively  uniform  crankshaft  rotation  on  the  cyclic

loading of a pumping unit.

• Requires a minimum amount of maintenance.
• Can be overhauled on location.
• Requires a heavy foundation.
• Higher cost per HP than for high-speed engines.
• Weight per HP is higher than for high-speed engines.
• Can usually run only on natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
• May have either one or two cylinders.
• Fuel-injection system should be used when HP is greater than 40.
Four-cycle, slow-speed engine:
• Widely used.
• Relatively few moving parts.
• Uniform crankshaft speed because of a large flywheel.
• Can operate on governor control to compensate for load changes.
• Will operate on either natural gas or LPG.
• Repairs can usually be made without removing the engine from the pumping unit.
• Cost and weight per HP is greater than for high-speed engines.
• Limited engine sizes.
• Usually has a single horizontal cylinder.
Four-cycle, high-speed engines (greater than 750 rpm):
• Best suited for portable test installations vs. permanent installations.
• Lower initial cost.
• Lower weight per HP.
• Wide speed and power range.
• Operates on a variety of fuels.
• Large speed variations occur during pumping cycle because of a small flywheel effect.
• Operates  on  a  fixed  throttle  with  the  governor  mechanism  acting  only  as  an  overspeed

device.

• Has relatively short life because of the fast moving parts and the close tolerances required.
• Requires frequent oil changes.
• Requires frequent maintenance.
• Major repairs require that the engine be removed from the pumping unit.
API Spec. 7B-11C110 contains standard test and operating procedures that are used by manu-
facturers  to  determine  the  ratings  of  engines  for  oilfield  service.  These  test  data  should  be
requested  and  furnished  to  the  purchaser  from  the  manufacturer.  The  data  should  include  the
manufacturer’s  curves  showing  the  torque,  maximum  brake  HP,  and  the  rated-brake  HP  vs.
engine speed. These are important to know the speed range in which the engine would be able
to operate.

A  general  guide  for  installation  and  maintenance  of  gas  engines  is  API  RP  7C-11F,111
which  covers  all  three  types  of  engines  and  includes  a  troubleshooting  section.  This  practice
should be used as a starting point for engines unless the specific manufacturer’s operating man-
ual details otherwise. Additionally, there are a number of published papers on installation, care,
operation, and lubrication of engines as prime movers for pumping units.112–118

Gas-engine  performance  needs  to  be  derated  for  altitude  and  temperature.  The  API  Spec.

7B-11C for IC engines recommends the following:

• Deduct 3% of the standard brake HP for each 1,000-ft rise in altitude above sea level.
• Deduct 1% of the standard brake HP for each 10° rise in temperature greater than 60°F or

add 1% for each drop in degree, if temperature is less than 60°F.

IV-496

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

• Deduct 20% if the engine is continuously operated.
One  of  the  biggest  drawbacks  of  using  IC  engines  is  being  able  to  automatically  control
their operation. There have been a few publications on automatic controllers, but these typical-
ly have had limited field use with no long-term production performance recorded.119,120

11.7.3 Electric Motors.  Once  it  has  been  determined  that  an  electric  motor  is  needed  vs.  a
gas engine, there are several things to consider, including design standard, unit efficiency, cyclic-
load factor, and motor enclosure. These factors are discussed later in this chapter. Additionally,
there have been a number of papers written on the use of electric motors for sucker-rod-lifted
wells.1,2,4–6,104,121,122  Detailed  discussions  with  example  problems  for  sizing  motors,  along  with
discussion of electrical-power distribution systems for multiple-well installations, are presented
in  previous  editions  of  the  Petroleum  Production  Handbook  and  the  Petroleum  Engineering
Handbook.5,6

11.7.4 Common Motors.  The electric motor most commonly used for beam-pumping installa-
tions  is  an  alternating-current  (AC),  three-phase,  squirrel-cage  induction  motor.  These  motors
are used for the following reasons:

• Suitability for the load requirements.
• Low initial cost.
• Availability.
• Service dependability in the field.
If  three-phase  power  is  not  available,  single-phase  motors  up  to  5  HP  can  be  used.  This
motor is larger and more expensive than the three-phase motor of the same HP. The amount of
motor voltage (V) needed depends on V on the distribution system, distance to the transform-
ers, and motor size.

A  general  guide  of  motor  size  vs.  V  is  115  or  230  V  for  single-phase  motors;  115,  230,
460, or 575 V for polyphase motors up to 50 HP; and 460, 575, or 796 V for polyphase mo-
tors 50 to 200 HP. Motors for pumping units come in a variety of common sizes: 1, 1.5, 2, 3,
5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 100, and 125 HP.

11.7.5 Natl. Electrical Manufacturers Assn. (NEMA) Design Standards.  Motors can be pur-
chased in six standard synchronous speeds, with the 1,200-rpm motor being the most common-
ly  used  in  oilwell  pumping.  Multiple-HP-rated  motors  that  may  be  either  dual-  or  triple-rated
are  sometimes  used  for  oilwell  pumping;  the  triple-rated  is  more  common.  Changing  one  of
these  motors  from  one  HP  rating  to  another  requires  changing  leads  in  the  motor  housing,
which  in  turn  changes  the  motor’s  internal  wiring  system.  Any  capacitors,  fuses,  or  overload
relays in the circuit will also require evaluation and possible revision at the same time to make
sure it agrees with the new voltage/current requirements.

NEMA presents five general design standards that provide for varying combinations of start-
ing  current,  starting  torque,  and  slip.  The  most  commonly  recommended  electric  motor  for
pumping units is a 1,200-rpm NEMA Design D. It has a normal starting current, a high start-
ing torque (272% or more of full-load torque), and a high slip (5 to 8%). Because Design D
specifications are not drawn as closely as they are for other designs, manufacturers have devel-
oped several designs with variations in slip that still fall within Design D specifications.

The  other  NEMA  designs  (A,  B,  C,  and  F)  are  not  used  as  often.  However,  there  have
been publications concerning when NEMA C and/or B designs could be considered, especially
with variable-speed drives.123

11.7.6 Power Factors.  A  power  factor  determines  the  amount  of  line  current  drawn  by  the
motor.  A  high  power  factor  is  desirable  because  it  is  important  in  reducing  line  losses  and
minimizing power costs. A lower power factor means that the unit is not operating as efficient-

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-497

ly as it should. Oversized motors tend to have low power factors. Typically, a NEMA D has a
power factor of 0.87 when fully loaded, but decreases to 0.76 at half load. Usually, units must
operate  at  a  power  factor  of  greater  than  0.80  to  avoid  penalties  from  the  power  companies;
thus,  optimization  of  the  pumping  unit’s  size  and  motor  needs  to  be  considered  as  the  well-
fluid volume changes.

Using capacitors can increase power factors. To determine if and how much capacitance is
needed, determine the power factor of an installation upon initial startup and then decide if a
correction  is  justified.  If  a  pumping-unit  motor  has  a  low  power  factor,  a  capacitor  can  be
placed  between  the  motor  and  disconnect.  Because  of  the  possibility  of  electrical  shock,  only
qualified  personnel  should  make  this  connection.  Remember  that  changing  producing  condi-
tions  might  require  that  the  power  factor  be  checked  and  that  the  motor-overload  relays  be
resized if the capacitor is on the load side of the overload relays.

11.7.7 Cyclic-Load Factor.  When a motor is used for a cyclic load, such as oilwell pumping,
it  will  be  thermally  loaded  more  than  the  same  average  load  applied  on  a  steady-state  basis.
HP  ratings  of  electrical  motors  depend  on  how  much  the  temperature  increases  in  the  motor
under load. A motor functioning cyclically must be derated from its full-load nameplate rating.
A  motor’s  true  performance  and  rating  on  a  cyclic-load  application  cannot  be  determined
by the use of normal indicating- or recording-type instruments. Motor heating is a function of
the thermal current or root-mean-square (RMS) current, which is the square root of the mean
of the squares of currents of definite time intervals. This may be more easily determined with
an  RMS  or  the  thermal-type  ammeter,  which  records  RMS  current  corresponding  to  the  true
heating or “thermal” HP load on the motor. This current will always be higher than the aver-
age input current. The ratio of the average HP output to the “thermal HP output” correspond-
ing to the RMS line current is called the motor derating factor and is always less than one. Its
inverse is the cyclic-load factor, which is always greater than one. An average motor derating
factor  for  NEMA  Design  C  motors  is  0.65;  an  average  motor  derating  factor  for  NEMA  De-
sign D motors is 0.75.

11.7.8 Motor Enclosures.  There are four basic types of motor enclosures: drip-proof guarded,
splashproof  guarded,  totally  enclosed  fan  cooled  (TEFC),  and  explosion  proof.  “Guarded”
refers to screens used over air intakes to prevent the entrance of rodents or other foreign items.
The TEFC enclosure provides the maximum protection for the interior of the motor. The drip-
proof  motor  should  prove  adequate  for  most  pumping-unit  installations  in  which  the  motor  is
elevated. This type of construction is built with a closed front-end bell to eliminate the entry of
horizontal  rain,  sleet,  or  snow  into  the  motor.  The  splashproof  motor  affords  somewhat  more
protection against splashing liquids than does the drip-proof one. The preferred enclosure sets
the motor on or close to the base; the explosion-proof enclosure will seldom be required. Motor-
high mounts on pumping units have also been useful in protecting the motor from sand or snow.

11.7.9 Motor Insulation.  NEMA has established the insulation classes and the maximum total
temperatures applicable to these classes for insulations used in motor winding. For normal ser-
vice  life,  the  temperature  of  the  motor  windings  should  not  exceed  the  maximum  allowable
temperature for that particular insulation type. Class A insulation has a maximum total temper-
ature of 105°C, Class B = 130°C, Class F = 155°C, and Class H = 185°C. Generally, the more
the  motor  enclosure  restricts  the  flow  of  outside  cooling  air,  the  higher  the  temperature  rise
will  be,  and  in  all  probability,  the  higher  the  winding  temperature.  This  temperature  increase
has to be incorporated into the decision regarding which insulation class is required.

The service life of an AC induction motor is determined by the bearing life, the insulation
life,  and  routine  maintenance/inspection.  Temperature  rise  is  important  because  studies  have

IV-498

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

indicated that for every 8°C rise above the temperature values stated, the insulation life is cut
approximately in half.

11.7.10 Motor Slip.  Slip is the difference between motor synchronous speed and speed under
load, usually expressed in percent of synchronous speed. Synchronous speed is the theoretical,
no-load speed of the motor. Slip characteristics are very important because they will determine
how much HP can be converted to torque to start the gearbox gears turning. A high-slip motor
permits the kinetic energy of the system to assist in carrying the peak-torque demands. A low-
slip motor will respond to the instantaneous demand; in other words, the high-slip motor slows
down more under peak torque demands than the low-slip motor. The result is that the high-slip
motor  will  require  lower  peak  currents  than  the  low-slip  motor.  How  high  the  motor  slip
should  be  for  pumping  installations  is  debatable;  however,  Howell  and  Hogwood  stated,  “A
slip greater than 7 to 8% offers no additional advantages from the overall pumping efficiency
standpoint.”104  On  the  basis  of  this  information  and  the  slip  characteristics  of  the  various  de-
signs, the Design D motor with a 5 to 8% slip is recommended for most sucker-rod installations.

11.7.11 Ultrahigh-Slip (UHS) Motors.  Higher-slip motors are available from some manufac-
turers; one has claimed to have slip characteristics up to 35 to 40%, also claiming that using
their  UHS  motor  would  result  in  lower  loading  on  the  sucker  rods,  lower  electric-current
peaks, and reduced power use.123–126 However, to obtain the mechanical advantage, these sys-
tems have to be set up in the high-slip mode. When this is done, the increased slip normally
decreases the operating speed and may result in a decrease in production when compared to a
NEMA D installation.

11.7.12 Motor Controls.  Motor controls are housed in a weatherproof, NEMA Type 3 enclo-
sure  with  special  explosion-proof  enclosures  available.  All  control  units  should  contain  the
following:

• Fused manual disconnect.
• Hand on/off/automatic selection switch.
• Lightning arrester system.
Circuit breakers are sometimes used instead of fuses. The fused manual disconnect acts as
a line-disconnect switch at the entrance to the control box. A fused disconnect may be located
on a pole upstream of the motor starter; the lightning arrester is connected to the incoming line
terminals, just ahead of the fused-manual disconnect and must be properly grounded. Depend-
ing  on  the  inherent  protection  built  into  the  motor,  the  control  box  may  contain  an  overload
relay, an undervoltage relay, and/or a sequence-restart timer.

11.7.13 Grounding  Systems.    The  electrical  equipment  must  be  properly  grounded.  Good
grounding procedures are essential to personnel safety and good equipment operation. It is rec-
ommended that reference be made to the Natl. Electrical Code and the Natl. Electrical Safety
Code to ensure safe grounding is met. Particular attention should be given to the connection of
the  ground  wire  to  the  well  casing.  The  connection  should  be  located  where  it  will  not  be
disturbed during well-servicing operations and should be mechanically secure. Periodic (yearly
is recommended as a minimum) continuity measurements should be made with a volt-/ohmme-
ter between “a new clean spot” (not where the ground wire is terminated) on the well casing
and  new  spot  on  each  piece  of  grounded  equipment.  The  resistance  measured  between  any
piece of equipment and the casing should not exceed 1 ohm. The resistance measured between
the pumping-unit ground system and another nearby moisture ground should not exceed 5 Ω.
However, these measurements should to be checked with current circulating through the system
to determine if the ground is good.

11.7.14 Beam-Pump HP.  There are seven HP values that should be considered in the proper
design and operation of sucker-rod-pumped wells; these are hydraulic, friction, polished-rod, gear-
reducer, V-belt drive, brake, and indicated.

Hydraulic HP (HHP) is the theoretical amount of work or power required to lift a quantity
of fluid from a specified depth. This is a theoretical power requirement because it is assumed
that there is no pump slippage and no gas breakout. The HHP, thus, is the minimum work ex-
pected to lift the fluid to the surface and can be found with the following equations:

HHP = Q(BFPD) × 350(lbf / bbl) × G × H(ft)

/ {33,000 (lbf-ft) / (HP-min) × 440(min / D)}................................... (11.11)

or

HHP = (Fo(lbf) × Sp(in.) × N(spm) /{12(in. / ft) × 33,000 (lbf-ft) / (HP-min) }........ (11.12)
Friction  HP  (FHP)  is  the  amount  of  work  required  to  overcome  the  rubbing-contact  forces
developed when trying to lift the fluid to the surface. This friction can be caused by a number
of  sources  including  plunger-on-barrel  friction;  rod-  and/or  coupling-on-tubing  wear;  sand,
scale,  and/or  corrosion  products  hindering  pump  action,  rods,  and  couplings  moving  through
the  fluid;  fluid  moving  up  the  tubing;  normal  and  excessive  stuffing-box  friction;  and  liquid
and gas flowing through the flowline and battery facilities. FHP, thus, is dependent on factors
such as how straight and deep the well is, the fluid viscosity, the pumping speed, and the tubing/
rod  buckling.  In  most  situations,  unless  we  know  all  of  these  factors,  we  do  not  know  what
FHP  is.  However,  for  design  purposes,  API  RP11L  calculations  assume  the  friction  effects,
which show up in the peak and minimum polished-rod loads and in the calculation of polished-
rod HP (PHP).

PHP is the amount of work required to artificially lift the fluid to the stock tank. It is the
sum  of  HHP  plus  FHP.  For  design  purposes,  API  RP11L  assumes  these  values  are  related  to
Fo/SKr and N/No, where Kr is the load necessary to stretch the rod string 1 in., and No is the
natural frequency of a straight rod string. If a surface dynamometer card is available, the PHP
can be measured because the area of the card is the work done at the polished rod to lift the
fluid to the surface. The formula for calculating PHP follows:

PHP = card area × dynamometer constant × S(in.) × N(spm)

/ (card length × 12 × 33,000) . .............................................. (11.13)

Gear-reducer  HP  (GHP)  is  a  value  used  to  find  the  efficiency  of  the  unit  (i.e.,  how  much  the
gear reducer is loaded, compared to required peak torque). GHP can be calculated by the following:

GHP = (gearbox-torque rating) / 4,960. ........................................ (11.14)

V-belt-drive HP (VHP) is the maximum power required by the V-belts to be transmitted to

the gear reducer. API Spec. 1B127 states that the VHP for a beam-pumping unit is as follows:

VHP = peak crankshaft torque (lbf-in.) × N(spm) / 70,000. ....................... (11.15)

Brake  HP  (BHP)  is  the  power  required  by  the  prime  mover  to  turn  the  sheave  that  makes
the reducer’s gears turn and starts the cranks going around. This power must accommodate the
inefficiencies of all components involved in getting the cranks to turn to transmit the power to

IV-500

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

the polished rod. BHP can be found with Gipson and Swaim7 recommendations by the follow-
ing equation:

BHP = PHP / (efficiency factor) . ............................................. (11.16)

The efficiency factor is found from a graph by taking GHP divided by API gearbox-torque
rating and then intersecting either a worn- or new-unit efficiency curve. This efficiency factor
is applied to the PHP to convert it to BHP at the prime mover and is required to offset power
losses caused by friction in the surface equipment. Fig. 11.10 is a recommended curve to find
the HP efficiency factor.

Additionally, a minimum estimate for this HP by NEMA for Design D and C motors is as

follows:

BHP = Q(BFPD) × L(ft) / (derating factor) . .................................. (11.17)

This derating factor is 56,000 or 45,000 for D or C motors, respectively.

Indicated HP (IHP) is the power required by the prime mover to meet the BHP requirements
and  determines  the  size  of  motor  that  needs  to  be  ordered.  It  is  found  through  the  following
equation:

IHP = (BHP / derating factor) . ............................................... (11.18)

This  derating  factor  accommodates  continuous  operation  and  thermal  effects.  The  derating
factors  for  electric  motors  are  0.75  and  0.65  for  NEMA  D  and  C,  respectively.  The  derating
factor for a gas engine is dependent on the type of engine and service, rotational speed, eleva-
tion,  and  ambient  temperature.  The  effects  of  these  parameters  are  discussed  in  API  Spec.
7B-11C,110 paragraphs 2.11 and 2.13. A rule-of-thumb estimate for an engine’s derating factor
is as follows:

Derating factor = 0.80 + { elevation (ft) × 0.03 / 1,000 ft}

+{ temperature (°F) – 85°F × 0.01 / 10°F . .................................. (11.19)

11.7.15 HP  Problem-Solving  Example.    Given  the  previous  HP  definitions,  along  with  the
information and calculations in API RP11L (p.7), find all seven HPs:

• HHP = [175 (BFPD) × 350 (lbf/bbl) × 0.9 × 4,500 (ft)] / (33,000 × 1,440) = 5.2 HP.
• PHP = line 26 = 8.5 HP.
• FHP = PHP – HHP = 8.5–5.2 = 3.3 HP.
• GHP = line 25/4,960 = 133,793/4,960 = 26.9 HP.
• Assuming  a  160,000-lbf-in.  unit  is  ordered  to  accommodate  a  calculated  133,793-lbf-in.
peak  torque,  and  using  Fig.  11.10,  find  the  efficiency  factor  of  0.86:  VHP  =  (133,793  ×  16)  /
70,000 = 35.6 HP.

• BHP  =  (PHP  /  efficiency  factor),  where  the  efficiency  factor  is  found  by  GHP  /  reducer
rating = (8.5 × 4,960) / 160,000 = 0.2635. With Fig. 11.10, the efficiency factor is 0.64. Thus,
BHP = (8.5 / 0.64) = 13.28 HP.

• Assuming a NEMA D motor, IHP = (BHP / derating factor) = 13.28/0.75 = 17.7 HP.
Therefore,  a  20-HP  motor  should  be  purchased.  However,  a  15-HP  motor  may  work,  but
certain aspects are not known, including actual counterbalance divided by optimum counterbal-
ance, flowline pressure, and actual friction effects. Thermal current (amps) can be measured to

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

determine  how  much  motor  capacity  is  actually  being  used  once  the  unit  and  motor  are  in-
stalled. The actual motor size could then be refined for other units in the area.

11.7.16 Sheaves and V-Belt Drives.  Prime movers—whether with a gas engine or an electric
motor—run at a speed of 300 to 1,200 rpm. This speed must be reduced to the required pumping-
unit speed of 2 to 25 spm. This is accomplished with sheaves, V-belt drives, and gear reducers.
A  sheave  is  a  grooved  pulley,  and  its  primary  purpose  is  to  change  the  speed  between  the
prime mover and the gearbox. The belt—usually a V-belt —is a flexible band connecting and
passing around each of the two sheaves. Its purpose is to transmit power from the sheave on
the prime mover to the sheave on the pumping unit. It is important to understand the basics of
sheaves and V-belt to know how to select a sheave for a certain pumping speed and to deter-
mine the number of V-belt needed.

11.7.17 Sheave  Basics.    Sheaves  come  in  different  widths  and  have  from  1  to  12  grooves.
They are selected on the basis of the pitch diameter (PD) relative to how many spm the unit
will pump. New beam-pumping units can be purchased with different-sized sheaves on the re-
ducer. Sheaves can also be purchased to accept different V-belt cross sections. A pumping-unit
sheave  should  be  selected  that  will  allow  as  much  speed  variation  (up  and  down)  from  the
design  speed  as  is  practical  without  violating  API  Spec.  1B127  rules.  Most  unit  sheaves  will
have grooves for more belts than are actually needed because most units seldom, if ever, oper-
ate at maximum HP. The maximum VHP is shown in Eq. 11.15. Only the grooves closest to the
prime mover and the gear reducer should be filled, and only enough belts to transmit the VHP
should be installed because of the following considerations:

• The  tension  in  the  excessive  belts,  which  will  be  further  from  the  equipment  than  the

required belts, will place unnecessary loads on the bearings.

• Wider sheaves than necessary and extra belts increase investment costs.
• It takes more energy to flex the extra belts around the sheaves, which increases operating

costs.

Pumping-unit  manufacturers  usually  list  all  unit-sheave  sizes  in  their  catalogs.  Motor
sheaves are available with various PDs and numbers of belt grooves. Table A.1 in API Spec.
1B contains commonly available sheaves. Because of availability, motor sheaves should be se-
lected from those listed in the top portion of the table.

11.7.18 V-Belt Basics.  A V-belt has a trapezoidal cross section that is made to run in sheaves
with  grooves  that  have  a  corresponding  shape.  It  is  the  workhorse  of  the  industry,  available
from virtually every V-belt distributor, and it is adaptable to practically any drive. It was de-
signed to wedge in the pulley, thereby multiplying the frictional force produced by the tension;
this, in turn, reduces the belt tension required for an equivalent torque. Remember, the purpose
of  the  belt  is  to  transmit  power  from  the  sheave  on  the  prime  mover  to  the  sheave  on  the
pumping  unit.  Therefore,  the  number  and  size  of  the  belts  needed  depend  on  the  amount  of
power to be transmitted.

Reinforcing  cords  normally  made  of  rayon,  nylon,  or  other  polymer  materials  provide  the
load-carrying  capability  of  a  V-belt.  The  cords  are  usually  embedded  in  a  soft  rubber  matrix
called a cushion section. The balance of the belt is made of harder rubber, and the entire sec-
tion is usually enclosed (i.e., wrapped) in an abrasion-resistant jacket or cover.

As  the  belt  bends  around  a  sheave,  the  bending-neutral  axis  is  the  only  portion  that  does
not  change  the  circumferential  length.  This  line  (which  does  not  change  length)  is  called  the
pitch  line  and  determines  the  “effective”  radius  of  the  pulley,  which  in  turn,  determines  the
torque and speed ratios. The position of this line as it curves around the pulley forms a pitch
circle with a pitch diameter.

IV-502

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Classical V-belts are made in five standard cross sections designated by the letters A (the
smallest cross section), B, C, D, and E (the largest cross section). The HP that a belt is able to
transmit  falls  off  rapidly  as  the  sheave  size  diminishes.  Table  11.10  lists  the  minimum  PDs
recommended by API for the various belt sections. Smaller-PD sheaves are not recommended
because  of  decreased  HP,  reduced  transfer  efficiency,  shorter  belt  life,  and  less  economical
drive. Fig. 11.11 shows the HP capacity a single belt can transmit for a selected small-diameter
sheave for the various belt cross sections.

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-503

Fig. 11.11—Recommended transmitted HP per single belt for selected-OD sheave size and V-belt cross-
section type.

11.7.19 Other  Types  of  Belts.    There  are  other  types  of  belts  (i.e.,  flat,  narrow,  and  syn-
chronous  belts,  as  well  as  other  variations  of  the  V-belt).  For  example,  narrow  multi-V-belts
(power  bands)  were  developed  because  the  maximum  load  capacity  for  a  given  width  of  belt
required the use of a narrow section. This provided the maximum support of the tensile cords
by joining the belts together. V-ribbed belts provide complete support with only a modest com-
promise in terms of additional tension.

11.7.20 Selecting a Sheave.  The  first  step  in  designing  the  V-belt  drive  for  a  pumping  unit
consists of selecting a sheave for the unit and the prime mover. To do this, the desired pump-
ing  speed  (N),  along  with  the  speed  (in  rpm)  of  the  prime  mover  and  gear  ratio,  must  be
known.  If  the  other  parameters  are  known,  this  equation  can  be  rearranged  to  determine  any
required factor:

(N × unit gear ratio × pumping-unit sheave size)

= (prime-mover speed × motor sheave size) . ................................. (11.20)

The largest motor sheave in this group will provide for the greatest reduction in pumping

speed for future operations merely by changing motor sheaves.

11.7.21 Double Reduction With Electric Motor.  A  double-reduction  unit  run  by  an  electric
motor will require a speed reduction through the V-belt drive of approximately 2:1 at fast pump-
ing  speeds.  At  slow  speeds,  the  ratio  will  be  6:1.  When  two  belt  sections  are  offered  for  the
unit sheave, the smaller belt section will allow the use of a smaller motor sheave and a lower
pumping  speed.  In  most  cases,  the  smaller  belt  section,  with  one  of  the  two  largest-unit
sheaves, will offer the greatest flexibility.

11.7.22 Double Reduction With Gas Engine.  A  double-reduction  unit  run  by  a  slow-speed
gas engine will require a speed reduction of 1:1 at a fast pumping speed; at a slow pumping
speed, the ratio will be 3:1. In these cases, speed reductions (which may be anticipated through
the  drive)  should  be  checked  with  the  proposed  unit  and  prime  mover.  If  little  or  no  speed
reduction  will  ever  be  required  through  the  V-belt  drive,  one  of  the  two  smaller-unit  sheaves

IV-504

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

will enable the use of a smaller (and less-expensive) prime-mover sheave. The larger belt sec-
tion could also be used and may require fewer belts.

11.7.23 Determining the Required Number of Belts.  The first step in determining the number
of belts required is to calculate the VHP. When the peak torque is known, this is the preferred
method of calculating the design HP. When the peak torque is not known, a service correction
of 1.6 is recommended.

The remainder of the calculation can be performed by following the procedure in Section 4
of  API  Spec.  1B,  starting  with  Paragraph  4.5  (page  11).  A  complete  design  requires  that  the
distance  between  the  centers  of  the  driver  and  driven  sheaves  be  known.  The  basic  steps  are
given in API Spec. 1B. An example calculation is presented here.

Example. As  an  example  problem,  select  the  optimum  gear-reducer  sheave  for  a

C-160D-173-86 pumping unit that will be operated with the reducer fully loaded.

Given:  gear-reducer  sheaves  available  from  the  pumping-unit  manufacturer’s  catalog:  20-,
24-,  30-,  36-,  and  38-in.  PD-3C.  Assume  that  the  prime  mover’s  average  rpm  =  1,120.  The
smallest C-section motor sheave that should be considered = 9 in. PD (i.e., 9.4-in. OD in Table
3.1  of  API  Spec.  1B).  The  largest  sheave  that  should  be  considered  to  keep  the  design  PD
velocity at less than 5,000 ft/min = 16-in. PD (calculations indicate a 17-in. PD, but page 32
of  API  Spec.  1B  indicates  that  17-in.  PD  C-section  sheaves  are  not  generally  available;  eco-
nomics  should  discourage  engineers  and  others  from  recommending  sheaves  not  listed).  The
liquid  to  be  pumped  has  a  viscosity  of  approximately  1  cp.  The  pumping-unit  gear  ratio  is
28.67. The maximum speed with an 86-in. stroke should result in an acceleration factor of 0.3,
in which the maximum spm ≤ (0.3 × 70,500/86)0.5 ≤ 15.7. The minimum speed with an 86-in.
stroke should result in an acceleration factor ≤ 0.225, in which the minimum spm ≤ (0.225 ×
70,500/86)0.5 ≤ 13.6.

Find: the optimum gear-reducer sheave and the number of C-section belts required, assum-
ing  the  reducer  is  fully  loaded  and  is  operated  at  the  maximum  and  minimum  speed  dictated
by the sheave selected.

Solution 1: solving for pumping speeds from Eq. 11.20 = [prime-mover speed (rpm) × prime-
mover-sheave  PD]/[(gear-reducer  sheave  PD)  ×  (1/pumping-unit  gear  ratio)].  For  example,
1,120 × 9/20 × 1/28.67 = 17.1. The rest of the speeds can be calculated similarly for the differ-
ent  available  gear-reducer  sheaves,  and  the  smallest  or  largest  prime-mover  sheaves.  The
summary of these calculations is shown in Table 11.11.

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-505

The  table  shows  that  the  38-in.  PD-4C  gear-reducer  sheave  should  be  selected;  however,

the 36-in. gearbox sheave is acceptable.

Solution 2:
1. VHP at 9 spm = 160,000 × 9/70,000 = 20.6.
2. HP  that  can  be  transmitted  with  one  C-section  belt  and  with  a  9-in.-PD  prime-mover

sheave (as shown in Fig. 11.11) = 11.

3. Number of belts required = 20.6/11 = 2 belts.
4. VHP at 16 spm = 160,000 × 16/70,000 = 36.6
5. HP  that  can  be  transmitted  with  one  C-section  belt  and  with  a  16-in.-PD  prime-mover

sheave (as shown in Fig. 11.11) = 25.

6. Number of belts required = 36.6/25 = 2 belts.
Note that neither calculation justifies filling all the grooves in the gear-reducer sheave. No

justification is known for using more belts than is indicated by API Spec. 1B.

11.8 Miscellaneous Surface Equipment

11.8.1 Polished Rods.  A polished rod is the top-most rod in a rod string. These rods come in
various lengths and sizes. Polished rods are made of various materials, including carbon steel,
stainless steel, and monel. It is usually more economical to use corrosion-resistant polished-rod
liners on carbon-steel polished rods than to use corrosion-resistant polished rods. Polished rods
must  be  properly  aligned  in  relation  to  the  pumping  tee.  Poor  alignment  will  result  in  de-
creased life of the stuffing-box packing and possible failure of the polished rod. Furthermore,
if the polished rod does not travel straight up and down during the pumping cycle, liners may
not be practical. For situations in which the pumping unit is not properly set and/or the well-
head is crooked, a full-length sucker rod should be installed between the polished rod and the
top  of  the  string’s  pony  rods.  This  will  decrease  crooked  wellhead-induced  polished-rod  fail-
ures and increase packing life. The polished rod must have a coupling and a sub on top. This
is  required  in  case  the  rod  slips  because  the  polished-rod  clamp  is  not  sufficiently  tight.  The
coupling keeps it from falling through the stuffing box. The subrod helps retrieve the polished
rod and helps prevent moisture from getting into the coupling.

Section 12 of API Spec. 11B discusses polished rods and polished-rod liners. Table 12.1 in
API Spec. 11B recommends polished-rod size vs. the size of the top rod in the rod string. API
polished-rod lengths are 8, 11, 16, and 22 ft. Upset ends can be furnished on 1⅛-, 1¼-, and 1½-
in.  polished  rods  and  are  recommended  for  heavy  loads.  Upset  ends  have  sucker-rod  connec-
tions that are superior to the pipe-thread connections on nonupset polished rods. This type of
connection decreases stress concentration and results in improved fatigue life. The surface fin-
ish on polished rods is specified in Section 12 API Spec. 11B. Although the range of surface
finish is 10 to 20 micro-inches, roughness average scale (RA), it is recommended that a 16-micro-
inch-RA  finish  be  specified  because,  if  the  finish  is  too  smooth,  it  may  be  difficult  for  the
clamps to work properly and a too-rough finish reduces polished-rod packing life.

11.8.2 Polished-Rod Clamps.  Polished-rod clamps are fitted on the polished rod and come in
several designs. Clamps for the light loads may have only one bolt, whereas clamps for heavier
loads will have two bolts. The clamp manufacturer specifies the torque required to tighten the
clamps, which is also discussed in both API Spec. 11B and API RP 11BR.29 They also specify
the forces that will cause clamps to slip on polished rods in API Spec. 11B. This is based on
the  assumption  that  the  OD  of  the  polished  rod  will  be  approximately  equal  to  the  OD  the
manufacturers assumed when they designed and built the clamp. The clamp must be the right
size for the polished rod (no homemade bushings) and be strong enough to support the maxi-
mum well load. Open-end, box-end, or socket wrenches should be used on the clamp nuts and

IV-506

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

bolts. Pipe wrenches cut the nuts and make it hazardous for those who must loosen the clamp
in the future. Be careful of foreign material in the clamp or on the polished rod. If the polished
rod and clamp are not properly cleaned, the clamp may slip. Clamps that do not have a load-
bearing surface perpendicular to the polished rod can also bend the polished rod. The following
are some maintenance tips to keep in mind when working with the clamps:

• Use the clamp manufacturer’s recommended torque for tightening the bolts. Do not over-
tighten  polished-rod  clamps—it  may  be  the  start  of  polished-rod  failure.  API  Spec.  11B
requires that a properly attached clamp may not cause an indentation of more than 0.010 in.

• The polished rod’s clamp area and the inside area of the clamp should be cleaned before

• Do not allow the use of pipe wrenches on polished-rod bolt nuts. Replace all pipe-wrench-

installation.

cut nuts.

• Do not put clamps on polished-rod liners.
• Do not clamp on the sprayed-metal part of polished rods.

11.8.3 Stuffing Boxes.  A stuffing box is a device attached to the pumping tee that seals fluids
in  the  tubing  by  forming  a  tight  seal  with  the  polished  rod  and  diverting  the  produced  fluids
out of the pumping tee into the flowline. Packing for stuffing boxes is made from a variety of
different materials. Local experience is the best guide in selecting the appropriate packing mate-
rial to use.

Stuffing boxes may have one or two sets of packing elements. In a stuffing box with two
sets of packing, the lower set is left relaxed and inoperative during normal operations. When it
becomes necessary to replace the upper set of packing, the unit is shut down, and the lower set
of packing is tightened against the rod, which enables the upper-packing element to be safely
replaced with pressure on the tubing. After replacing the upper element, the lower-packing ele-
ment  must  be  backed  off  before  starting  the  unit.  This  method  not  only  retains  the  tubing
pressure and decreases pollution, but also keeps low-pressure gas out of the face of the person
doing the work.

There are stuffing boxes made with attached oil containers to keep the polished rod lubricat-
ed  on  wells  that  pump  off,  have  high  water  cuts,  or  are  in  a  semiflowing  gas-heading
condition. The proper method for handling the pumpoff condition is adjusting the pump capaci-
ty with time clocks, stroke lengths, stroke, speed, or pumpoff controllers. Maintaining a surface
backpressure  on  the  tubing  may  be  beneficial  on  wells  that  are  in  a  semiflowing  gas-heading
condition. Both conditions should be corrected to decrease polished-rod and stuffing-box wear
and to increase overall pumping efficiency.

11.8.4 Rod  Rotators.    Rod  rotators  must  be  used  with  certain  types  of  mechanical  paraffin
scrapers. Rod rotators may also be used when rod-coupling wear is a problem. The rotation of
the rods spreads the wear around the entire surface of the coupling instead of allowing it to be
concentrated  on  one  small  area.  Rotation  does  not  solve  the  problem,  but  it  does  make  the
coupling or centralizer last longer. Rotators need to be selected properly and are dependent on
the well load.

11.8.5 Pumping Tees.  API  Spec.  11B  covers  design  and  rating  of  pumping  tees.  The  major
requirement  for  tees  and  stuffing  boxes  are  that  they  be  properly  installed.  In  addition,  the
threads need to be clean and in line with the tubing when it is screwed on.

11.8.6 Check Valves.  A check valve is a valve that permits flow in only one direction. If the
gas or liquid flow starts to reverse, the valve automatically closes and prevents reverse flow. A
check valve should be placed between the casing head and flowline to prevent backflow from

Chapter 11—Sucker-Rod Lift

IV-507

the flowline into the casing annulus. An oversized check valve will chatter and destroy the seat
seal prematurely; an undersized check valve will hold too much backpressure on the casing.

11.8.7 Surface Valves.  The casing/tubing annulus should be equipped with a wing valve that
will allow the casing pressure and the fluid level to be monitored. This valve also can be used
to  introduce  to  the  well  corrosion  inhibitors,  hot  oil,  water,  etc.  It  should  be  bull-plugged
closed when not in use. Introducing liquids into the annulus at a higher rate than the annulus
self-venting rate drives the producing-liquid level to less than the pump intake, which starves
the pump and causes premature pump failure. Self-venting can occur if the equivalent annulus
diameter ≥ 0.92 × Q0.4, where Q is the pumping rate in gal/min. Wing valves allow the installa-
tion  of  a  pressure  gauge  so  that casing  pressure  can  be  measured. This  is  important to  check
because, if the casing pressure is greater than ½ the pump-intake pressure, the flowline is prob-
ably too small or partially blocked.

Another  type  of  surface  valve  that  could  be  used  is  a  backpressure  valve.  This  valve  is
normally  installed  in  the  flowline,  upstream  from  the  casing-annulus  gas-piping  tie  in  and  is
typically used to keep the tubing from unloading when the well still has high bottomhole pres-
sure  (when  the  well  alternates  between  flowing  and  pumping,  this  situation  is  called  “flump-
ing”).  The  optimum  backpressure  to  prevent  flumping  would  be  equal  to  or  just  greater  than
the pump-intake pressure. It should be noted that backpressure on the tubing can cause paraffin
deposits in the tubing to come loose, flow up the tubing, and block the backpressure valve, or
may cause the stuffing-box packing to blow out; thus, the tubing and rods should be cleaned
before applying backpressure.

11.9 Design Calculations
There  has  been  a  long  history  of  work  trying  to  model  or  design  sucker-rod  strings.  This  in-
cludes  the  original  work  from  Slonneger128  and  Mills129  on  vibration  effects  of  rod  strings.
Fatigue  of  rods  also  was  considered  in  1940.130  These  effects  helped  develop  the  Slonneger,
Mills,131 and Langer132 formulas for rod loads. A detailed discussion and development of these
formulas is provided by Zaba.1

Zaba2 detailed the next refinement of sucker-rod loading, which was the organization of the
Sucker Rod Pumping Research Inc. in 1954, and the development of an analog computer mod-
el to simulate the elastic behavior of rod strings. This method was provided to the industry in
the  1960s,  and  the  design  results  were  developed  into  the  hand-calculation  and  graphical
method in API RP 11L.30

Companies  used  this  graphical  chart  and  calculation  method  for  many  years,  with  some
refinements and changes to the practice, to account for tapered-rod strings and rod percentages,
that provide equal loading in each section of a string. The development of the wave equation
for sucker-rod lift by S.G. Gibbs133 in 1961 was a major step forward because its use permitted
design or analysis for all types of units and rod strings. The advent of the personal computer
and its continued developments of power and speed allowed more developments of rod-string
simulators, including extending the API simulator using a next-order wave equation, pumping
units  different  than  conventional  ones,  mixed-steel  and  fiberglass-rod  strings,  frictional  effects
of the fluid and wellbore deviation, and current models that address very viscous fluids and 3D
horizontal wells.61,133–151 Regardless of what method or program is used to predict loads, once
the equipment is installed and the well has stable production and fluid levels, it is recommend-
ed  that  a  dynamometer  survey  be  run  with  a  load-capable  dynamometer  attached  to  the
polished  rod.  The  predicted  loads  should  be  compared  to  the  actual  loads  and  the  associated
fluid production. Adjustments to the predictions should be made for future troubleshooting and
any further design changes.

While these models have improved, they still address only the loads on the selected grade
of rods and the string design, the size of downhole pump, and the type and size of the pump-

IV-508

ing  unit.  However,  for  a  complete  design  of  a  beam-pump  installation,  all  the  equipment
discussed in the preceding sections needs to be addressed, as well as the data provided from a
rod-string design program, which at minimum, include the following:

• Where the pump is set and the associated downhole separator design.
• Type of pump, along with its design and metallurgy.
• Sinker-bar use and design, if required.
• Tubing size and grade.
• TAC use, position, and setting.
• Polished-rod size.
• Polished-rod clamp size.
• Type and size of prime mover.
• Sheave and V-belt design.
Gipson and Swaim did an excellent job of summarizing a sucker-rod lift-system design in
The  Beam  Pump  Design  Chain7  with  the  API  RP  11L  approach.  This  recommended  practice
should be consulted for continued discussion of this equipment, along with a review of a sam-
ple problem and a recommended solution. In summary, use the design procedure presented in
API  RP  11L  or  a  suitable  wave  equation.  Several  commercial  wave-equation  computer  pro-
grams are available that many operators have successfully used.

11.10 Automation and Pumping Control
“Automation” means different things to different people and becomes a problem when the term
triggers concern from the field about personnel reduction. Thus, sucker-rod-lift automation may
not always be considered good if not properly applied. However, there needs to be monitoring
and control equipment on an installation to enhance proper operation, monitoring, failure reduc-
tion or prevention, and troubleshooting/problem solving.

At  minimum,  a  sucker-rod-lift  installation  should  have  vibration  switches  on  the  unit  to
shut it down if there is a high part in the rod string that will cause overloading of the gearbox
or  damage  to  the  unit  foundation.  There  should  be  a  pressure  gauge  (or  a  connection  for  a
pressure gauge to allow temporary installation) on the flowline-pumping T, downstream of the
check valve that monitors the flowline pressure. There should also be some type of pump-cycle
controller. This may be from a simple time clock to a more sophisticated pumpoff or rod-pump
controller.

A number of papers have been published that address automation of sucker-rod-lift or beam-
pump  automation  and  control.152–165  There  is  also  a  reference  on  practical  automation  for
mature fields.166 If a high degree of automation is considered, then a very important side con-
sideration  is  keeping  this  electrical  equipment  working,  especially  during  electrical  storms;
thus, proper lightning protection and grounding should be considered.104,167,168,169

A study made several years ago indicated that at least one-half of the pumping wells sur-
veyed  had  a  subsurface  pump  installed  that  was  too  large.*  The  results  of  such  installations
were  devastating fluid  pounds  when  wells  were  overpumped, resulting  in  short  run  times  and
increased  failure  frequency.  Because  of  the  cost  to  pull  and  replace  a  pump,  typically  other
parts  of  the  sucker-rod-lift  system  were  changed  to  compensate  for  the  oversized  pump.  Too
many times, the too-large pump is a result of habit or of not optimizing when the well capacity
has changed.

It  is  still  possible  to  live  with  the  too-large  pump  until  the  correct  size  can  be  installed.
Some  interim  measures  are  to  reduce  the  pump  displacement  by  reducing  the  strokes  per
minute, shortening the stroke, and decreasing backpressure on the tubing/casing annulus, there-

by  decreasing  formation  backpressure,  allowing  more  fluid  inflow,  and  reducing  the  pumping
time.

Probably the most common type of well control or automation is time clocking, which con-
sists of pumping a portion of a 15-minute period. Percentage timers and pumpoff controls are
used in modern time-clocking work. The purpose of time clocking is to adjust the pump capac-
ity to the well capacity.

Pumpoff controllers have been developed over the years to be standalone monitors, to pro-
vide  rod-string  load  and  polished-rod  position  and  related  dynamometer  cards,  and  to  be
installed with communication links to allow remote monitoring and control of the installation.
Current advancements in computers along with electrical end devices allow sophisticated con-
trol of individual installations and/or a whole field. If new pumping installations are planned,
these types of controllers/automation should be considered. It becomes more difficult to justify
a retrofit to a long-time producing field, but this may be considered depending on access to the
field, variable well inflow, and/or reduction in operating costs by reducing well failures. Many
papers  on  pumpoff  or  rod-pump  controllers,  different  theories  concerning  their  operation,  and
controller  installation  and  operation  have  been  published.170–181  These  should  be  reviewed  to
determine if or when a controller may be advantageous to install.

11.11 Troubleshooting Sucker-Rod-Lift Installations
Once a sucker-rod-lift system is installed on a well, the continued monitoring and optimization
of pumping parameters begins. Obtaining monthly well tests on the fluid production from the
well  and  a  fluid/pump  submergence  level  is  recommended  to  ensure  that  the  well  capacity  is
within the recommended pump-capacity range, the well does not have excess capacity or equip-
ment needs to be changed because of excessively high fluid levels, and that excessive pumping
of the well is not occurring.

Although  current  rod-string-design  models,  simulators,  and  programs  are  fairly  accurate,
they still need individual-well calibration to ensure that the design assumptions are correct for
the actual well conditions. Additionally, to know what is different and why, the six main well
loads need to be recorded from the predictive design. These loads need to be compared to the
actual  well  loads  with  known  fluid-level,  well-test,  and  pumping  parameters.  Gipson  and
Swaim7  have  described  these  six  basic  loads  and  their  relationship  to  a  surface  dynamometer
card.

Many  papers  have  been  published  on  dynamometers  and  their  use  on  sucker-rod-lifted
wells.182–191 Some of these provide discussion of surface loads and surface dynamometer cards,
while the latest trend is to discuss downhole dynamometer cards (or pump cards). While obtain-
ing  actual  downhole  loads  that  these  dynagraphs  recorded,  there  has  been  recent  work  on
developing and field-testing a downhole dynamometer.192–194

While these measurements investigate the sucker-rod-string loads, the other components of
the lift system also should be investigated, including the pumping unit and gearbox. As previ-
ously  discussed,  there  are  only  two  techniques  to  check  if  a  pumping  unit  is  overloaded9:
conducting a torque analysis or comparing the permissible-load diagram (PLD) for the pump-
ing  unit  to  the  loads  from  the  surface  dynamometer  card.  The  torque-analysis  technique  has
been  demonstrated  by  Gipson  and  Swaim,195  and  Takacs,196  Gault,197  and  Teel198  have  dis-
cussed PLDs or envelopes. Chastain discussed examples of PLD use for properly counterbalanc-
ing a pumping unit.199

Failures of sucker-rod-lift components have been discussed in countless papers. The use of
current  data  processing  and  root-cause  analysis  of  these  failures  has  been  the  recent  industry
trend  to  assist  in  reducing  failures.200,201  Additionally,  the  Artificial  Lift  Energy  Optimization
Consortium  (ALEOC)  program  in  west  Texas  has  been  useful  for  operators  to  compare  the
failure frequency of their sucker-rod-lift components, wells, and fields with other operators to
find areas of improvement.202 One final new trend developing for this lift method is a total well-

management  concept  that  integrates  the  well  capacity/pump  submergence  and  rod-string  and
pumping-unit loads with power demands. This may prove the best practice for optimizing, trou-
bleshooting, and reducing failures along with reducing associated lifting costs.

Gas Lift

12.1 Introduction

12.1.1 Description  of  Gas  Lift.    Gas  lift  is  a  method  of  artificial  lift  that  uses  an  external
source  of  high-pressure  gas  for  supplementing  formation  gas  to  lift  the  well  fluids.  There  are
two basic types of gas lift in use today—continuous and intermittent flow.

Continuous-Flow Gas Lift.  The vast majority of gas lift wells are produced by continuous
flow,  which  is  very  similar  to  natural  flow.  In  continuous-flow  gas  lift,  the  formation  gas  is
supplemented with additional high-pressure gas from an outside source. Gas is injected continu-
ously  into  the  production  conduit  at  a  maximum  depth  that  depends  upon  the  injection-gas
pressure  and  well  depth.  The  injection  gas  mixes  with  the  produced  well  fluid  and  decreases
the  density  and,  subsequently,  the  flowing  pressure  gradient  of  the  mixture  from  the  point  of
gas injection to the surface. The decreased flowing pressure gradient reduces the flowing bot-
tomhole  pressure  below  the  static  bottomhole  pressure  thereby  creating  a  pressure  differential
that allows the fluid to flow into the wellbore. Fig. 12.1 illustrates this principal.

Intermittent-Flow Gas Lift.  As the name implies, intermittent flow is the periodic displace-
ment of  liquid from  the  tubing  by  the  injection of  high-pressure  gas.  The  action is  similar to
that observed when a bullet is fired from a gun. (See Fig. 12.2.) The liquid slug that has accu-
mulated in the tubing represents the bullet. When the trigger is pulled (gas lift valve opens), high-
pressure injection gas enters the chamber (tubing) and rapidly expands. This action forces the
liquid  slug  (shaded  in  Fig.  12.2)  from  the  tubing  in  the  same  way  that  expanding  gas  forces
the bullet from the gun. The disadvantage of intermittent-flow gas lift is the “on/off” need for
high-pressure gas, which presents a gas-handling problem at the surface and causes surging in
the  flowing  bottomhole  pressure  that  cannot  be  tolerated  in  many  wells  producing  sand.  Be-
cause  of  the  intermittent  production  of  the  well,  intermittent-flow  gas  lift  is  not  capable  of
producing at as high a rate as continuous-flow gas lift. Intermittent flow should not be consid-
ered unless the flowing bottomhole pressure is low, and the well is gas lifting from the bottom
valve.

Applications.  Gas lift is particularly applicable for lifting fluids in wells that have a signifi-
cant  amount  of  gas  produced  with  the  crude.  Gas  compressors  are  nearly  always  installed  to
gather  the  produced  gas  and,  with  only  minor  changes,  can  be  designed  to  supply  the  high

IV-522

flow gas lift well.

injection-gas pressure for the gas lift system. The injected gas only supplements the formation
gas and may amount to only a small percentage of the total produced-gas volume. Most contin-
uous-flow  wells  can  be  depleted  by  gas  lift  because  reservoir-pressure  maintenance  programs
are implemented in most major oil fields and many reservoirs have waterdrives.

Advantages of Gas Lift.  The flexibility of gas lift, in terms of production rates and depth of
lift, can seldom be matched by other methods of artificial lift if adequate injection-gas pressure
and volume are available. Gas lift is one of the most forgiving forms of artificial lift because a
poorly designed installation will normally gas lift some fluid. The mandrel depths for many gas
lift installations with retrievable-valve mandrels are calculated with minimal well information.

Highly deviated wells that produce sand and have high formation-gas/liquid ratios are excel-
lent candidates for gas lift when artificial lift is needed. Many gas lift installations are designed
to  increase  the  daily  production  from  flowing  wells.  No  other  method  is  as  ideally  suited  for
through-flowline  ocean-floor  completions  as  a  gas  lift  system.  Wireline-retrievable  gas  lift
valves can be replaced without killing a well or pulling the tubing.

The gas lift valve is a simple device with few moving parts, and sand-laden well fluids do
not  have  to  pass  through  the  valve  to  be  lifted.  The  individual-well  downhole  equipment  is
relatively  inexpensive.  The  surface  equipment  for  injection-gas  control  is  simple  and  requires
little maintenance and practically no space for installation. Typically, the reported high overall
reliability and lower operating costs for a gas lift system are superior to other methods of lift.

Limitations of Gas Lift.  The primary limitation for gas lift operations is the lack of forma-
tion  gas  or  an  injection-gas  source.  Wide  well  spacing  and  lack  of  space  for  compressors  on
offshore platforms may also limit the application of gas lift. Poor compressor maintenance can
increase  compressor  downtime  and  add  to  the  cost  of  gas  lift  gas,  especially  with  small  field
units. Compressors are expensive and must be properly maintained. Generally, gas lift is not as

suitable as some other systems for single-well installations and widely spaced wells. The use of
wet gas without dehydration reduces the reliability of gas lift operations.

12.2 Designing a Gas Lift System

12.2.1 Timing.  Ideally, an artificial-lift system should be chosen and designed during the ini-
tial planning phase of an oil field. However, in the haste to get a field on production, artificial
lift may not be considered until after other production facilities are designed and installed. It is
difficult  to  choose  and  install  the  optimum  artificial-lift  system  after  the  surface  production
facilities have been installed. This is especially true in the case of gas lift.

12.2.2 Factors Having an Effect on the Design of a Gas Lift System.  Most production equip-
ment  affects  the  design  of  a  gas  lift  system,  so  it  is  best  to  design  the  gas  lift  system
concurrently with the design of surface facilities. The entire purpose of a gas lift system is to
reduce  the  bottomhole  flowing  pressure  of  the  well.  Anything  that  restricts  or  prevents  this
from occurring will have an impact on the system and must be considered in the design.

Field Layout and Well Design.  Consideration of gas lift operations should be a prime fac-
tor in sizing the hole for the desired oilwell tubulars. This is particularly true in offshore wells
where all of the downhole gas lift equipment, except the valves, is installed during the initial
completion. In on-shore fields, gas lift affects the size and location of gathering lines and pro-
duction  stations.  Artificial  lift  should  be  considered  before  a  casing  program  is  designed.
Casing  programs  should  allow  the  maximum  production  rate  expected  from  the  well  without
restrictions.  Skimping  on  casing  size  can  ultimately  cost  lost  production  that  is  many  times
greater than any savings from smaller pipe and hole size. The same is true in flowline size and
length. Production stations should be relatively near the producing wells. In most cases, increas-
ing the size of the flowline does not compensate for the backpressure generated by the added

IV-524

Fig. 12.3—Effect of wellhead backpressure on daily production rates and injection-gas requirements.2

pipe  length.  Any  item  of  production  equipment  that  increases  backpressure  at  the  wellhead,
whether it be wellhead chokes, small flowlines, undersized gathering manifolds and separators,
or high compressor suction pressure, seriously impacts the operation of a gas lift system. Fig.
12.3 illustrates the effect of backpressure on injection-gas requirement and fluid production in
a 6,900-ft gas lift well.1

Injection-Gas  Pressure.    Choosing  a  proper  injection-gas  pressure  is  critical  in  a  gas  lift
system  design.2  Several  factors  may  affect  the  choice  of  an  injection-gas  pressure.  However,
one primary factor stands out above all others. To obtain the maximum benefit from the inject-
ed  gas,  it  must  be  injected  as  near  the  producing  interval  as  possible.  The  injection-gas
pressure at depth must be greater than the flowing producing pressure at the same depth. Any
compromise with this principle will result in less pressure drawdown and a less efficient opera-
tion. High volumes of gas injected in the upper part of the fluid column will not have the same

effect  as  a  much  smaller  volume  of  gas  injected  near  the  producing  formation  depth  because
the fluid density is reduced only above the point of gas injection.

The equilibrium curve1 illustrates the effect of injection-gas depth on a particular well. The
equilibrium curve is established by determining the intersection of the formation-fluid pressure
gradient below the depth of gas injection with the produced gas lift gradient above the depth of
gas injection for various producing liquid rates (See Fig. 12.4). In Fig. 12.4, the intersections
of  the  flowing  formation-fluid  pressure-gradient  traverses  for  a  400-B/D  rate  and  a  600-B/D
rate with the flowing total (formation plus injection gas) -pressure-gradient traverses above the
point  of  gas  injection  to  the  surface  for  both  rates  are  shown.  If  intersections  are  established
for  a  large  number  of  rates,  as  are  shown  in  Fig.  12.5,  the  points  can  be  connected  and  will
form  what  is  referred  to  as  an  equilibrium  curve.  When  injection-gas  pressure  traverses  are
drawn from the surface, it is possible to determine the maximum gas lift rate from the well for
various surface injection-gas pressures. Referring again to Fig. 12.5, a 1,200-psig surface injec-
tion-gas pressure would gas lift this well at a rate slightly above 600 B/D.

Less  downhole  equipment  may  be  required  when  higher  injection-gas  pressures  are  used
(see  Fig.  12.6).  The  higher  injection-gas  pressure  provides  a  greater  pressure  differential  be-
tween  the  injected-gas  pressure  and  the  flowing  tubing  pressure;  thereby,  allowing  a  greater
spacing between valves. Thus, fewer mandrels and valves are required to reach the maximum
injection-gas depth. Note that in Fig. 12.6, the 800-psig design reaches only the depth of 4,817
ft and requires seven gas lift valves. In comparison, the 1,400-psig design uses only four gas
lift valves to reach the full depth of the well at 8,000 ft. The maximum pressure drawdown at
the  formation  with  the  800-psig  injection  gas  is  only  210  psi  (2,200  to  1,990)  compared  to
1,010 psi (2,200 to 1,190) when 1,400-psig injection gas is used.

to maintain operating pressure for a given well have been discussed. A variety of other factors
can affect the selection of the most efficient surface injection-gas pressure. These may include
such things as the pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) properties of the crude, water cut of the
producing  stream,  density  of  the  injected  gas,  wellhead  backpressure,  pressure  rating  of  the
equipment, and design of the well facility.

Calculating  the  Effect  of  Injection-Gas  Pressures  on  Surface  Production  Facilities.    The
selection and design of compression equipment and related facilities must be closely considered
in gas lift systems because of the high initial cost of compressor horsepower and the fact that
this  cost  usually  represents  a  major  portion  of  the  entire  project  cost.  In  most  instances,  the
injection-gas  pressure  required  at  the  wellhead  determines  the  discharge  pressure  of  the  com-
pressor.  Higher  injection-gas  pressures  increase  the  discharge  pressure  requirement  of  the
compressor, which is translated into a related increase in the compressor horsepower required
for  a  given  volume  of  gas.  However,  if  the  gas  lift  system  is  designed  properly,  the  related
decrease in gas volume requirements will result in an improvement in overall operating efficiency.
Gas Volume.  The  total  injection  gas  required  for  a  continuous-flow  gas  lift  well  may  be
determined  by  well-performance  prediction  techniques.  Well-performance  calculations  are  dis-
cussed later in this chapter, but they are typically obtained by simultaneously solving the well
inflow and well outflow equations. Well inflow, or fluid flow from the reservoir, can be simu-
lated by either the straight line pressure drawdown (PI) or the inflow performance relationship
(IPR) methods.3 Likewise, well outflow, or fluid flow from the reservoir to the surface, is typi-
cally predicted by empirical correlations such as those presented by Poettmann and Carpenter,4
Orkiszewski,5 Duns and Ros,6 Hagedorn and Brown,7 Beggs and Brill,8 and others. Once typi-
cal gas volume requirements for individual wells are determined, totals for the entire field can
be calculated.

12.3 Compressor Horsepower

12.3.1 Gas Lift Systems.  Figs. 12.7 and 12.8 show the amount of injection gas and compres-
sion brake horsepower per well, respectively, required to obtain identical producing rates using
several different surface injection-gas pressures. As expected, compression horsepower decreas-
es  as  injection-gas  pressure  increases  for  a  given  daily  liquid  rate,  until  the  injection-gas
pressure reaches maximum injection depth. An injection-gas pressure greater than that required
to inject at maximum depth requires additional compression without additional production.

In the example shown in Figs. 12.7 and 12.8, a significant decrease in horsepower require-
ments is possible by employing an injection-gas pressure of 2,000 psig (ANSI Class 900 pipe)

IV-528

rather than one of 1,440 psig (ANSI Class 600 pipe) or lower. For these conditions, the com-
pression  horsepower  requirements  represent  the  minimum  for  each  producing  rate  when  an
injection-gas pressure of approximately 2,000 psig is used. Unlike an injection-gas pressure of
2,500 psig, 2,000-psig pressure allows the use of ANSI Class 900 piping (2,160-psig working
pressure) in the distribution system.

Most  high-pressure  gas  lift  systems  are  designed  to  recirculate  the  lift  gas.  The  low-pres-
sure  gas  from  the  production  separator  is  compressed  and  reinjected  into  the  well  to  lift  the
fluids  from  the  well.  This  closed  loop,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  12.9  is  referred  to  as  a  closed
rotative  gas  lift  system.  Continuous-flow  gas  lift  operations  are  preferable  with  a  closed  rota-
tive  system.  Intermittent  gas  lift  operations  are  particularly  difficult  to  regulate  and  operate
efficiently in small closed systems having limited gas-storage capacities.

12.3.2 Gas Distribution and Control.  The  control  and  distribution  of  injection  gas  to  a  gas
lift well is as important as the control and distribution of electric power is to a pumping well.
The  distribution  system  must  be  large  enough  so  that  very  little  pressure  is  lost  between  the
compressor  and  the  wellhead.  This  is  usually  best  accomplished  with  a  main  distribution  line
that circles a producing area and is connected to distribution manifolds located at each produc-
tion  station.  Manifolds  of  this  type  were  first  used  in  the  vast  gas  lift  systems  of  Lake

Maracaibo. They proved so successful for centralizing the control of injection gas that their use
spread  to  many  areas  of  the  world.  The  distribution  manifold  consists  of  a  control  valve,  gas
meter, and distribution line to each well. Such a system is illustrated in Fig. 12.10.9

Gas Compression and Dehydration.  In the early days of gas lift, most injection gas for the
gas lift wells came from large gas-processing facilities. This ensured a good constant source of
dry  gas  to  lift  the  wells.  However,  as  more  gas  was  gathered  and  processed,  the  processing
plants  became  larger  and  were  located  further  from  the  oil-production  facilities.  This  resulted
in the widespread use of field compressors to compress gas gathered in the field before it was
sent  to  the  processing  facilities.  The  field  compressors  tended  to  be  smaller,  high-speed,  skid
mounted, reciprocal units that could be moved and quickly installed wherever required.

The  use  of  the  field  compressors  made  gas  lift  easily  accessible  in  any  field  where  suffi-
cient  gas  was  available  from  a  local  source.  This  brought  about  many  closed-cycle  gas  lift
systems where gas was separated from the produced crude, gathered and sent to compressors,
and then after compression, returned to the wells for reinjection as gas lift gas or sold.

Both the centrifugal and reciprocating compressors are used in production facilities. Howev-
er,  because  of  their  flexibility  under  changing  conditions  and  applicability  to  small  volumes,
reciprocating compressors are used far more often than centrifugal compressors in gas lift oper-
ations.

Gas Dehydration.  Because most injection gas for gas lift is now compressed in the field,
dehydration of the gas has become an important part of a successful gas lift operation. Natural
gas may contain substantial amounts of water vapor because of the presence of connate water
in the reservoir. The ability of a gas to hold water in the vapor phase is dependent upon the
pressure and temperature of the gas. As a gas is cooled, its ability to hold water in the vapor
phase  is  reduced.  The  water  dewpoint  of  a  gas  is  defined  as  the  temperature  under  a  given
pressure  at  which  water  initially  begins  to  condense  from  an  all-vapor  system.  Water  vapor

should be removed from lift gas to prevent the formation of liquids in the distribution system.
Liquids can cause the formation of hydrates, which are solid compounds resembling dirty ice
that is caused by the reaction of natural gas with water. Hydrates consist of approximately 10%
hydrocarbons and 90% water. These hydrates may pack solidly in gas distribution systems caus-
ing  blocked  valves,  lines,  and  orifices.  In  distribution  systems  that  contain  acid  gas  fractions
(CO2 and H2S), liquids can also greatly accelerate the corrosion of the gas-handling facilities,
as well as the well casing and tubing.

Gas dehydration removes the source of the problem and is preferred over methanol injec-
tion  or  line  heaters.  Dehydration  can  be  accomplished  by  either  absorption  or  adsorption
processes. The absorption process involves the passing of the gas stream through a liquid desic-
cant that has a strong affinity for water. In the adsorption process, gas flows through a bed of
granular  solids  called  solid  desiccants.  The  most  widely  used  dehydration  system  in  oilfield
and  gas  lift  operations  is  the  absorption-type  process.  The  desiccant  used  in  these  systems  is
usually a solution of one of the glycols; generally, diethylene glycol (DEG) or triethylene gly-
col (TEG) is used. The method of operation is the same for both systems.

12.3.3 Surface Production Facilities.  The location of surface production facilities can greatly
impact  the  efficiency  of  a  gas  lift  operation.  Production  stations  that  provide  liquid  and  gas
separation along with other gathering facilities should be located as near the wells as practical.
Every  effort  should  be  made  to  minimize  the  length  of  multiphase  flowlines.  In  some  cases,
substations  with  a  minimum  of  facilities  can  be  employed  to  shorten  the  length  of  the  multi-
phase flowlines.

12.3.4 Gas  Lift  Equipment.    Downhole  gas  lift  equipment  consists  mainly  of  the  gas  lift
valves and the mandrels in which the valves are placed. The American Petroleum Inst. (API)
Spec. 11V1 covers the manufacture of gas lift valves and mandrels.10

Tubing- and Wireline-Retrievable Equipment.  The early gas lift valves were the convention-
al tubing-retrievable type, in which the tubing mandrel that held the gas lift valve and reverse
check valve was part of the tubing string. It was necessary to pull the tubing to replace a con-
ventional  gas  lift  valve.  The  first  selectively  wireline-retrievable  gas  lift  valve  and  mandrel
were introduced around 1950. The wireline-retrievable-valve mandrel was designed with a pock-

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

IV-531

Fig. 12.10—Injection-gas manifold for controlling and measuring gas to individual wells.4

et  receiver  within  the  mandrel.  A  gas  lift  valve  could  be  removed  or  installed  by  wireline
operations  without  pulling  the  tubing.  The  primary  wireline  device  for  locating  the  mandrel
pocket and selectively removing or installing a gas lift valve is a kickover tool. The mandrel is
called  a  sidepocket  mandrel  because  the  pocket  is  offset  from  the  centerline  of  the  tubing.
Most sidepocket-type retrievable-valve mandrels have a full-bore inside diameter (ID) equal to
the  tubing  ID.  These  mandrels  permit  normal  wireline  operations,  such  as  pressure  surveys.
This wireline-retrievable system for gas lift valves revolutionized the application of gas lift for
inaccessible  wells.  The  newer  generation  of  retrievable-valve  mandrels  uses  orienting  devices
to ensure successful wireline operation in highly deviated wells. A description of such equip-
ment can be found in API Spec. 11V1.10

The  operating  principles  for  a  given  type  of  tubing-retrievable  or  wireline-retrievable  gas
lift  valve  are  the  same.  Although  the  performance  characteristics  may  vary  between  the  same
type  of  tubing-  and  wireline-retrievable  valve,  the  installation  design  calculations  outlined  in
this chapter do not change. The choice between tubing- and wireline-retrievable equipment de-
pends primarily on the costs associated with pulling the tubing and whether a workover fluid
may damage the deliverability of a well.

With  the  increased  cost  of  pulling  the  tubing  in  today’s  field  operations,  wireline-retriev-
able  equipment  is  now  used  in  most  new  wells  and  particularly  in  offshore  and  inaccessible
wells.  A  wireline-retrievable  gas  lift  valve  and  mandrel  are  illustrated  in  Fig.  12.11,  while  a
tubing-retrievable valve and mandrel are shown in Fig. 12.12.10

Open and Closed Installations.  Most tubing flow gas lift installations include a packer to
stabilize  the  fluid  level  in  the  casing  annulus  and  prevent  injection  gas  from  blowing  around
the lower end of the tubing in wells with a low flowing bottomhole pressure. A closed gas lift
installation implies that the installation includes a packer and a standing valve. An installation
without a standing valve may be referred to as semiclosed, and this is widely used for continuous-

flow operations. An installation without a packer or standing valve is called an open installa-
tion. An open installation is seldom recommended.

A  packer  is  required  for  gas  lifting  low-bottomhole-pressure  wells  to  isolate  the  injection
gas  in  the  casing  annulus  and  to  control  the  gas  volume  per  cycle  for  intermittent-lift  opera-
tions. Intermittent gas lift operations require a packer and possibly a standing valve. Although
most  illustrations  of  an  intermittent  gas  lift  installation  show  a  standing  valve,  many  actual
installations do not include this valve. If the permeability of the well is very low, the need for
a standing valve is optional. The advantages of a packer are particularly important for gas lift
installations in an area where the injection-gas-line pressure varies or the injection-gas supply
is interrupted periodically. If the installation does not include a packer, the well must be unload-
ed after each shutdown. More damage to gas lift valves can occur during unloading operations
than during any other time in the life of a gas lift installation. If the injection-gas-line pressure
varies, the working fluid level changes. The result is a liquid washing action through all valves

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

IV-533

below  the  working  fluid  level,  and  this  continuing  fluid  transfer  can  eventually  fluid-cut  the
seat assemblies of some gas lift valves. A packer stabilizes the working fluid level and elimi-
nates the need for unloading fluids in the annulus after a shutdown.

Considerations for Selecting the Proper Installation and Equipment.  If a well can be gas
lifted by continuous flow, this form of gas lift should be used to ensure a constant injection-
gas circulation rate within the closed rotative gas lift system. Continuous flow reduces pressure
surges  in  the  bottomhole  flowing  pressure,  flowline,  and  the  low-  and  high-pressure  surface
facilities that are associated with intermittent gas lift operations. Overdesign rather than under-
design of a gas lift installation is recommended when the well data are questionable. The gas
lift  equipment  in  the  wells  is  the  least  expensive  portion  of  a  closed  rotative  gas  lift  system.
The larger-outside-diameter (OD) gas lift valve should be selected for lifting most wells if cas-
ing size permits. The superior injection-gas volumetric throughput performance for the l.5-in.-
OD gas lift valve, as compared to the l-in.-OD valve, is an important consideration for gas lift
installations with a high injection-gas requirement. The smaller diameter 1-in.-OD valve is de-
signed  to  be  used  in  small-casing-diameter  wells.  Structurally,  the  1-in.-OD  valve  is  not  as
strong as the 1.5-in.-OD valve. Its bellows size is much smaller, which results in an increase in
the  ratio  of  port  area  to  bellows  area.  This  increase  in  port-to-bellows  area  ratio  and  higher
bellows-assembly  load  rate  can  increase  the  number  of  gas  lift  valves  and  the  injection-gas
pressure required to lift deep wells.

The gas lift design techniques presented in this chapter include several factors to compen-
sate for errors in well information and provide for an injection-gas pressure increase to stroke
the gas lift valves. If an installation is properly designed, all gas lift valves above an operating
valve should be closed, and all valves below should be open. The installation methods present-
ed here are based on this premise. Gas lift valve operation is discussed in detail because it is
difficult to design or analyze a gas lift installation properly without understanding the mechani-
cal operation of a gas lift valve.

A large-bore seating nipple, which is designed to receive a lock, is recommended for most
gas lift installations. This seating nipple should be installed at the lower end of the tubing and,
if feasible, below the packer. Applications for a seating nipple include installation of a standing
valve for testing the tubing or for intermittent gas lift operation and a means to secure and to
pack  off  a  bottomhole-pressure  gauge  for  conducting  pressure-transient  tests.  The  lock  should
have an equalizing valve if the tubing is to be blanked off. The pressure across the lock can be
equalized before the lock is disengaged from the nipple to prevent the wireline tool string from
being blown up the hole.

12.4 Gas Fundamentals
Only the gas fundamentals essential to the design and analysis of gas lift installations and oper-
ations  are  discussed  in  this  section.  The  more  important  gas  calculations  related  to  gas  lift
wells and systems can be divided into these topics: (1) gas pressure at depth, (2) temperature
effect  on  the  confined  nitrogen-charged  bellows  pressure,  (3)  volumetric  gas  throughput  of  a
choke or gas lift valve port, and (4) gas volume stored within a conduit.

The  fundamental  gas  equations  are  based  on  pressure  in  pounds  per  square  inch  absolute
(psia),  temperature  in  degrees  Rankine  (°R),  and  volume  or  capacity  in  cubic  feet  (ft3).  An
exception is pressure difference in pounds per square inch (psi), which may be a difference in
gauge or absolute units because the calculated pressure difference is the same. Generally, field
measurements of pressure are in gauge readings; therefore, the volumetric gas throughput and
gas-pressure-at-depth  charts  are  in  units  of  psig.  The  gas  lift  valve  equations  and  calculations
for bellows-charge and operating pressures in this chapter use gauge pressure.

12.4.1 Gas Pressure at Depth.   Prediction  of  injection-gas  pressure  at  depth  is  essential  for
proper gas lift installation design and for analyzing or troubleshooting gas lift operations. Most

IV-534

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

gas-pressure-at-depth  calculations  are  based  on  a  static  gas  column.  Pressure  loss,  because  of
friction  from  the  flow  of  injection  gas  through  a  typical  casing/tubing  annulus,  is  negligible.
The gas velocity in the annulus is considered negligible because the cross-sectional area of the
annulus is so much larger than the port area of a gas lift valve. The maximum gas flow rate is
limited  by  the  valve  port  size.  Only  in  annular  flow,  where  the  flow  areas  are  reversed  and
large volumes of gas may be injected down a small tubing string, does pressure loss because
of velocity become a concern. Eq. 12.1 is used for predicting the static bottomhole injection-
gas pressures.

The  depth  used  in  the  equation  is  the  true  vertical  depth  of  the  gas  column.  Because  the
gas compressibility factor is a function of the average pressure and temperature, the solution to
this  equation  requires  several  iterations.  Generally,  the  average  pressure  and  temperature  are
assumed to be the arithmetic mean of the wellhead and bottomhole values. This assumption is
reasonable  because  the  increase  in  well  temperature  with  depth  tends  to  result  in  a  relatively
constant gas density with depth. A straight-line traverse will approximate an actual static injection-
gas pressure-at-depth traverse and is used for the design of most gas lift installations.

12.4.2 Temperature Effect on the Confined Nitrogen-Charged Bellows Pressure.  There are
many more bellows-charged than spring-loaded gas lift valves in service. Most of the bellows-
charged  valves  have  nitrogen  gas  in  the  dome  and  bellows.  Because  it  is  impractical  to  set
each gas lift valve at its operating well temperature, the test-rack opening or closing pressure is
set at a standard base temperature. Most manufacturers set their bellows-charged gas lift valves
with  the  nitrogen-gas  charge  in  the  bellows  at  60°F.  Nitrogen  was  selected  as  the  charge  gas
because: (1) the compressibility factors for nitrogen at various pressures and temperatures are
known, (2) nitrogen is noncorrosive and safe to handle, (3) nitrogen is readily available through-
out the world, and (4) nitrogen is inexpensive. The temperature correction factors for nitrogen
can be obtained from tables such as the one shown in Table 12.1.2 Table 12.1 is calculated for
a  specific  condition  of  temperature  and  pressure  (nitrogen-charged  bellows  pressure  of  1,000
psig at 60°F) and is based on the work of Winkler and Eads.11 An equation for calculating the
temperature correction factor, CT, at other conditions of temperature and pressure is shown at
the bottom of the table. However, for most gas lift designs, unless pressures are considerably
higher than 1,000 psig, Table 12.1 gives sufficient accuracy. CT is used to calculate the nitrogen-
charged bellows pressure at 60°F for a given valve operating or unloading temperature at valve
depth in a well.

If a more accurate calculation of CT is required, the alternative solution shown in Example

An Alternative Solution for Calculating Nitrogen-Charged Bellows Pressure at 60°F.  If the
CT from Table 12.1 is used to calculate the nitrogen-charged bellows pressure at the test-rack
valve setting temperature for gas lift valves in a high-injection-gas-pressure system, the possi-
ble  error  in  the  test-rack  opening  pressures  may  prevent  successful  gas  lift  operations.  If  the
operating injection-gas-line pressure exceeds a range of 1,200 to 1,500 psig, the following cor-
relation, based on the work of Winkler and Eads11, is recommended for calculating the gas lift
valve nitrogen-charged bellows pressure in psig at the setting test-rack opening temperature of
60°F.

operator had difficulty unloading and gas lifting these wells because the set test-rack opening
pressures of the gas lift valves were too high.

12.4.3 Volumetric Gas Throughput of an Orifice or Choke.  The  volumetric  gas  throughput
of an orifice or choke is calculated on the basis of an equation for flow through a converging
nozzle. This equation is complex and lengthy for noncritical flow. For this reason, gas passage
charts are widely used for estimating the volumetric gas flow rate. A widely used equation for
calculating the  gas  flow  rate through  an  orifice, choke,  or  full-open valve port  was  published
by Thornhill-Craver.12

The  gas-compressibility  factor  is  not  included  in  Eq.  12.5;  therefore,  most  published  gas
passage charts do not include a gas-compressibility factor correction. Since the compressibility
factor would enter the equation as a square root term in the denominator, the chart values will
be lower than actual values for most injection-gas gravities and pressures. One type of choke
capacity  chart  is  illustrated  in  Figs.  12.13  and  12.14.  The  advantages  of  this  type  of  display
are the number of orifice sizes on a single chart for a full range of upstream and downstream
pressures  and  that  an  orifice  size  can  be  determined  for  a  given  gas  rate  throughput  and  the
given upstream and downstream pressures. The gas throughput capacity of the different orifice
sizes  is  based  standard  conditions  of  14.65  psia  and  60°F  for  a  gas  gravity  of  0.65  and  an
orifice discharge coefficient of 0.865.

Because  gas  flow  in  a  gas  lift  installation  occurs  at  the  gas  temperature  at  valve  depth,  a
correction  for  temperature  improves  the  prediction  for  the  volumetric  gas  rate.  If  the  actual
gravity differs from 0.65, a second correction should be applied. An approximate correction for
gas passage can be calculated using Eq.12.6.

There  have  been  misleading  references  in  the  literature  to  the  validity  of  the  Thornhill-
Craver equation related to gas lift installation design and operation. It is not the equation that
is  in  error.  The  assumption  that  a  gas  lift  valve  is  fully  open  for  all  injection-gas  throughput
calculations is incorrect in most instances. An unloading or operating gas lift valve is seldom
fully open. The Thornhill-Craver equation would yield a reasonably accurate injection-gas rate
through an operating valve if the actual equivalent port area open to injection-gas flow and the
correct discharge coefficient were used in the equation.

12.4.4 Gas Volume Stored Within a Conduit.  Typical  applications  for  gas  volume  calcula-
tions are given next.

1. The  volume  of  injection  gas  required  to  fill  the  production  conduit  and  to  displace  a

liquid slug to the surface for intermittent gas lift operations.

2. The volume of injection gas available, or removed, from a casing annulus on the basis of
a  change  in  the  casing  pressure  during  an  intermittent  injection-gas  cycle  (particularly  impor-
tant for design calculations using choke control of the injection gas).

3. The  capacity  calculations  for  storage,  or  retention,  of  the  injection  gas  in  the  low-  and

high-pressure systems in a closed, rotative gas lift system.

The gas capacity and volume calculations are based on an equation of state for real gases.

Also, the volume of gas can be calculated by solving for the number of pound-moles in Eq.

which states that 1 lbm-mole of any gas occupies approximately 379 scf at 14.7 psia and 60°F.
Average values for pressure and temperature based on surface and bottomhole values and the
corresponding compressibility factor must be used in the equation for inclined conduits.

conduit  is  horizontal,  average  pressures  and  temperature  are  the  surface  values  in  Eqs.  12.10
and 12.11. The average temperature of a gas column in the casing is assumed to be the same
at the instant a gas lift valve opens or closes. Eq. 12.11 may be simplified by using one com-
pressibility  factor  for  an  average  of  the  average  pressures.  This  assumption  is  particularly
applicable for very little change at high pressure.

Approximate  estimations  and  questionable  field  data  do  not  warrant  detailed  calculations.

Vgx is the approximate gas volume at standard conditions, scf.
The ratio of the standard to the average temperature, which is less than unity in most cases,
tends to offset the reciprocal of the compressibility factor that is greater than unity. This com-
pensation decreases the error from not including several variables in the approximate equation.

12.5 Gas Lift Equipment

12.5.1 Introduction.  The  advent  of  the  unbalanced,  single-element,  bellows-charged  gas  lift
valve  (as  illustrated  in  Fig.  12.15)  revolutionized  gas  lift  application  and  installation  design
methods.  Before  the  bellows-charged  gas  lift  valve,  there  were  differential  valves  and  numer-
ous types of unique devices used for gas lifting wells. These devices, or valves, were operated
by rotating or vertically moving the tubing and by means of a sinker bar on a wireline.

Single-element  implies  that  the  gas  lift  valve  consists  of  a  bellows  and  dome  assembly,  a
stem with a tip that generally is a carbide ball, and a metal seat housed in a valve body that is
attached to a mandrel in the tubing string. This is illustrated in Fig. 12.15. The original patent
for this type of gas lift valve was filed in 1940 by W.R. King. Currently, the unbalanced, single-
element  nitrogen-charged,  bellows  valve  remains  the  most  widely  used  type  of  gas  lift  valve
for gas lifting wells. The original King valve had most of the protective design features of the
present  gas  lift  valves.  The  bellows  was  protected  from  high  hydrostatic  fluid  pressure  by  a
gasket that sealed the bellows chamber from well fluids after full stem travel. A small orifice

was drilled in a bellows guide tube. The orifice was designed to be an anti-chatter mechanism,
and the bellows guide provided bellows support.

12.5.2 Purposes of Gas Lift Valves and Reverse Checks.  The  gas  lift  valve  is  the  heart  of
most gas lift installations and the predictable performance of this valve is essential for success-
ful gas lift design and operations. The gas lift valve performs several functions in a typical gas
lift installation.

The  primary  function  of  a  string  of  gas  lift  valves  is  to  unload  a  well  with  the  available
injection-gas pressure to a maximum depth of lift that fully uses the energy of expansion of the
injection gas for the available injection-gas pressure. Gas lift valves provide the flexibility for a
varying depth of gas injection as a result of a changing flowing bottomhole pressure, water cut,
daily production rate, and well deliverability.

Gas lift valves provide the means to control the injection-gas volume per cycle in an inter-
mittent  gas  lift  operation.  The  operating  gas  lift  valve  in  an  intermittent  gas  lift  installation
prevents an excessive injection-gas pressure bleed down following an injection-gas cycle.

When wet gas must be used for gas lifting with an orifice-check operating valve, freezing
may occur across the surface control valve because of a low flowing bottomhole pressure. This
condition can sometimes be eliminated by replacing the orifice-check valve with an injection-
pressure-operated gas lift valve. This allows the pressure drop to be taken across the operating
gas lift valve at depth where freezing will not occur.

The reverse check in a gas lift valve is especially important if any valves are located below
the working fluid level. The check prevents backflow from the tubing into the casing, which is
particularly important if the well produces sand and has a packer.

pressure and downstream-pressure regulators.

12.6 Gas Lift Valve Mechanics

12.6.1 Unbalanced, Single-Element Gas Lift Valves.  The unbalanced, single-element gas lift
valve is essentially an unbalanced pressure regulator. The analogy between these two devices is
apparent  in  Fig.  12.16,  where  (a)  injection-pressure-operated  gas  lift  valve  and  backpressure
regulator responds to injection-gas pressure and upstream pressure, respectively, and (b) produc-
tion-pressure-(fluid)-operated gas lift valve and downstream-pressure regulator respond to flow-
ing production pressure and downstream pressure, respectively. The closing force for a gas lift
valve can be a gas pressure charge in the bellows exerted over the effective bellows area or a
spring force, or a combination of both. The closing force for the regulator or gas lift valve can
be  adjusted  to  maintain  a  desired  backpressure  for  injection-pressure  operation.  The  regulator
or valve remains closed until this set closing force is exceeded.

Generally,  the  major  initial  opening  force  for  a  gas  lift  valve  is  the  pressure  exerted  over
the  effective  bellows  area  minus  the  port  area,  and  the  lesser  opening  force  is  the  pressure
acting over the port area. In like manner, the major opening pressure for a pressure regulator is
applied over an area equal to the diaphragm area minus the port area. The effect of the unbal-
anced opening force is far less for most unbalanced backpressure and pressure-reducing regula-
tors than for gas lift valves. The reason is that the ratio of the port area to the total effective
bellows  area  of  a  gas  lift  valve  is  much  greater  than  the  ratio  of  the  port  area  to  the  total
diaphragm  area  for  most  regulators.  The  operating  principle  remains  identical  for  the  gas  lift
valve and regulator, but the pressure applied over the port area has greater effect on the initial
opening pressure of most gas lift valves.

12.6.2 Pilot-Operated Gas Lift Valves.  There are numerous special application gas lift valves
available. The operation of many of these unique valves can be analyzed using the static force-
balance equations for the unbalanced, single-element, gas lift valve. The many different types
of gas lift valves and the variation in calculations are not discussed in this section because of
their limited application. However, one special-purpose valve of particular importance is the pilot-
operated gas lift valve.

The pilot-operated gas lift valve in Fig. 12.17 has operating characteristics that are ideally
suited for chamber installations and deep intermittent gas lift operations with low injection-gas
operating  pressure  and  small  tubing  in  large  casing.  The  pilot  valve  offers  a  very  large  main
port with controlled spread and a predictable constant closing pressure. Spread is defined as the
difference between the initial valve opening and closing pressures. This type of valve functions
properly on time cycle or choke control of the injection gas. The pilot section operates in the
same manner as a single-element gas lift valve with a small choke located downstream of the
valve seat. The production pressure at valve depth is exerted over the ball/seat contact area of
the pilot section as an initial opening force. When the pilot section begins to open, an increase
in  pressure  occurs  between  the  pilot  valve  seat  and  the  main  valve  piston.  This  increase  in
pressure above the piston results in compression of the spring under the piston, and the main
valve  snaps  open.  An  exceedingly  high,  instantaneous,  injection-gas  rate  enters  the  tubing
through  the  large  main  valve  port.  As  the  injection-gas  pressure  in  the  casing  decreases  from
gas passage through the large main port, the pilot section begins to close. The pressure down-
stream of the pilot port remains approximately equal to the injection-gas pressure until the pilot
port  area  open  to  injection-gas  flow  becomes  less  than  the  bleed-hole  area  in  the  main  valve
piston.  When  the  pressure  across  the  piston  approaches  equalization,  the  spring  returns  the
main valve to its seat.

The closing pressure of a pilot valve is considered predictable because it is approximately
equal  to  the  theoretical  closing  pressure  of  an  unbalanced,  single-element  gas  lift  valve.  The
pressure  upstream  and  downstream  of  the  pilot  port  is  approximately  equal  at  the  instant  the
pilot  section  closes.  Selecting  the  proper  pilot  port  size  controls  the  spread  of  a  pilot  valve.
The  high  injection-gas  throughput  capacity  of  the  large  main  valve  port  is  unaffected  by  the
pilot port size.

12.6.3 Valve Specifications Including Full-Open Stem Travel.  Manufacturers publish gas lift
valve specifications for their valves. Some manufacturers assume a sharp-edged seat for the ball/
seat contact, and others arbitrarily add a small increase to the port ID to account for a slight
bevel for the ball-seat contact. Because most manufacturers use the same sources for their sup-
ply of bellows, the effective bellows areas are considered the same. The generic gas lift valve
specifications in  Table 12.2  are  representative of  many  actual unbalanced, single-element, gas
lift  valves.  The  theoretical  fully  open  stem  travel  is  not  included  in  the  valve  specifications
published by most manufacturers.

The stem travel required to fully open an unbalanced, single-element gas lift valve increas-
es  with  port  size,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  12.18.  The  curves  were  calculated  for  gas  lift  valves
with a square, sharp-edged seat and a ball on the stem that is  ∕16
1 -in. larger in OD than the bore
diameter of the port. The calculated equivalent port area, before a valve is fully open, is based
on the lateral surface area of the frustum of a right circular cone. The major area of the frus-
tum  is  the  ball/seat  contact  area,  which  remains  constant.  The  minor  area  decreases  with  an
increase in stem travel as the ball moves away from its seat.

Actual gas lift valve injection-gas rate throughput performance is seldom mentioned in pub-
lished  gas  lift  installation  design  literature.  Gas  lift  valves  with  the  larger  ports  may,  or  may
not,  fully  open  and  have  the  predicted  injection-gas  capacity  for  gas  lifting  high-rate  wells
through large tubing or the casing annulus.

IV-546

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 12.17—Pilot-operated gas lift valve.

12.6.4 Gas Lift Valve Port Configurations.  The port geometry and the maximum valve-stem
travel  affect  the  volumetric  injection-gas  throughput  rate  of  a  gas  lift  valve.  Most  gas  lift
valves have a polished carbide ball that is silver soldered to the valve stem. The valve seat can
have a sharp-edged port or a taper. The chamfer may be very slight for breaking the seat line
or may be of sufficient depth to assure that the ball remains in the taper for full-stem travel. A
sharp-edged and a tapered seat with a 45° chamfer are illustrated in Fig. 12.19. Note that in (a)
the sharp-edged seat has an effective Ap equal to the bore area through the seat and in (b) the
tapered seat has a 45° chamber measured from the horizontal (90° included angle). The effec-
tive  Ap  in  the  Ap/Ab  ratio  is  the  ball/seat  contact  area  and  not  the  bore  area  through  the  seat.
The example calculations in this section are based on the sharp-edged seat because the majori-
ty of gas lift valves in service have a sharp-edged seat or a very shallow chamfer for breaking

IV-547

the seat line. The calculations are basically the same for a sharp-edged seat and a seat with a
shallow taper. The calculations for an equivalent area open to the injection-gas flow differ for
a seat with a deep chamfer. There has been no standard angle adopted for the taper of a gas
lift  valve  seat.  Certain  manufacturers  use  the  same  tapered  seat  for  different  stem-ball  sizes,
and the bore area through the seat may be the same. The area of the port used in the port-to-
bellows area ratio must be redefined for a tapered seat when the ball/seat contact area is larger
than  the  bore  area  through  the  seat,  as  shown  in  Fig.  12.19b.  The  Ap/Ab  ratio  is  the  ball/seat
contact  area,  not  necessarily  the  bore  area  through  the  seat,  divided  by  the  effective  bellows
area.

The  specifications  for  the  gas  lift  valve  depend  upon  the  ball  size  and  the  angle  of  the
chamfer  for  valves  with  a  port  configuration  similar  to  Fig.12.19b.  The  selection  of  an  angle
for the taper, ball size, and the bore area through the seat can result in a ball/seat contact at the
base of the taper. For this geometry, the bore area of the port would be used in the Ap/Ab term.
The maximum stem travel in many gas lift valves with a deep taper is restricted to prevent the
ball  from  pulling  out  of  the  taper,  and  the  valve  always  remains  in  the  throttling  mode.  A
throttling mode implies that the generated area open to flow for the injection gas is less than
the bore area through the valve seat. Certain types of gas lift valves with a deep tapered seat
are designed to operate only in the throttling mode for continuous-flow application.

Fig. 12.20—Schematic of crossover seats with and without a choke upstream of the valve port.

12.6.5 Crossover Seats.  Several types of gas lift valves have a crossover seat for a particular
application.  The  crossover  seat  is  designed  to  direct  the  downstream  pressure  into  the  valve
body  where  the  pressure  is  exerted  over  the  effective  bellows  area  less  the  ball/seat  contact
area. The upstream pressure is applied to the ball/seat contact area. The crossover seat in Fig.
12.20 is a schematic illustrating the principle of a crossover seat. A choke upstream of the port
controls the maximum injection-gas rate and aids in keeping downstream pressure applied over
the bellows area after the valve opens. An actual crossover seat has a group of bypass open-
ings or a milled area around the main port. The total bypass area must significantly exceed the
port area to ensure that a valve with a crossover seat will close.

An example of the need for a crossover seat is a production-pressure-operated gas lift valve
installed in an injection-pressure-operated gas lift valve mandrel. Another application is a cas-
ing (annulus) -flow gas lift valve in a tubing-flow mandrel. In both examples, the gas lift valve
is modified, rather than the mandrel. An example is a wireline-retrievable gas lift valve man-

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

IV-549

drel with pockets designed for injection-pressure-operated gas lift valves and tubing flow that
has been installed in a well. The operator desires production-pressure operation. The solution is
production-pressure-operated gas lift valves with a crossover seat.

Gas  lift  valves  with  a  crossover  seat  are  not  recommended  if  the  proper  mandrels  can  be
installed  to  eliminate  the  need  for  a  crossover  seat.  The  maximum  port  size  is  limited  for
valves with a crossover seat. This limitation can be very serious in wells requiring high injection-
gas  rates.  Another  problem  with  a  crossover  seat  is  the  possibility  of  partial  plugging  of  the
crossover bypass area. The physical bypass area should be at least 100% greater than the valve
port area because the bypass openings usually are smaller and more likely to plug than a valve
port  that  can  be  opened  and  closed.  The  production-pressure-operated  gas  lift  valve  does  not
close  at  the  design  closing  pressure  when  the  crossover  area  results  in  a  significant  pressure
loss. The pressure exerted over the bellows area is between the flowing-production and injection-
gas pressures rather than at the lower flowing-production pressure.

Many  production-pressure-operated  gas  lift  valves  with  crossover  seats  can  be  choked  up-
stream  of  the  ball/seat  contact  area.  The  same  port  size  may  be  used  in  all  valves,  and  the
volumetric  injection-gas  throughput,  for  the  upper  unloading  gas  lift  valves,  is  limited  by  a
choke size that is smaller than the port area. The small inlet chokes tend to reduce the valve
closing-pressure problem associated with production-pressure operation.

12.6.6 Bellows Protection.  All  reputable  manufacturers  of  gas  lift  valves  have  provided  bel-
lows  protection  in  the  design  of  their  valves.  A  bellows  should  be  protected  from  a  high
pressure differential between the bellows-charge and the wellbore pressures and from the possi-
bility of a resonance condition that can result in high-frequency valve stem chatter. The bellows-
charge pressure is atmospheric pressure for most spring-loaded valves. The maximum pressure
differential across the valve bellows occurs in most installations during initial unloading opera-
tions  when  the  lower  gas  lift  valves  are  subjected  to  exceedingly  high  hydrostatic-load-fluid
pressures in deep wells.

Gas lift valve bellows are protected from high hydrostatic pressures by several methods: (1)
hydraulically preformed bellows by a high pressure differential, with or without, support rings
within the bellows convolutions, (2) a confined liquid seal in the bellows with full stem travel,
and (3) isolation of bellows from outside pressure with full stem travel. The primary purpose
of  these  methods  for  protecting  the  bellows  is  to  prevent  a  permanent  change  in  the  radii  of
the convolutions after installation in a well, which in turn, can change the operating pressure of
a gas lift valve.

The possibility of a valve-stem chatter condition is not predictable. The evidence of valve-
stem  chatter  is  a  bellows  failure  and  a  dished-out  seat  if  the  valve  seat  is  not  manufactured
from an extremely hard material. Many gas lift valves have some form of dampening mecha-
nism,  and  the  majority  of  these  devices  operate  hydraulically.  The  bellows  are  partially  filled
with a liquid, generally a high-viscosity silicone fluid. A restricted liquid-flow rate within the
bellows or a fluid-shear dampening mechanism prevents valve-stem chatter.

12.6.7 Stabilization of Test-Rack Opening Pressures.  One of the most important procedures
for preparing gas lift valves for installation in a gas lift well is the stabilization of the operat-
ing  pressure.  The  test-rack  set  opening  or  closing  pressure  of  an  unbalanced,  single-element,
nitrogen-charged or spring-loaded bellows gas lift valve should be stabilized before installation
in a well. Many operators and manufacturers call the process “aging.” The purpose of this pro-
cedure  is  to  prevent  the  set  operating  pressure  of  a  valve  from  changing  after  being  run  in  a
well.  Another  term  for  valve  operating  pressure  changes  is  valve  set  pressure  “scrambling,”
which may prevent a gas lift well from unloading, cause inefficient multipoint gas injection, or
may cause an unpredictable variation in operating valve depth.

After setting the test-rack opening or closing pressure, the gas lift valve is placed in a high-
pressure  vessel  filled  with  water.  The  valve  is  fully  stroked  several  times  by  alternately
increasing and decreasing the pressure of the water confined in the vessel. The exact procedure
varies among manufacturers. Typically, the maximum pressure ranges between 3,000 and 5,000
psig, and the minimum number of cycles is between 5 and 10. The valve is removed from the
high-pressure vessel, and the test-rack opening pressure is rechecked at the base setting temper-
ature. If the opening pressure varies more than a specified few psi, the valve must be reset and
the procedure repeated until the test-rack opening or closing pressure stabilizes. Also, the pro-
cess identifies valve bellows and bellows weld failures.

12.6.8 Bellows-Assembly  Load  Rate.    Bellows-assembly  load  rate  is  defined  as:  the  psi  in-
crease  exerted  over  the  bellows  area  per  linear  unit  travel  of  the  valve  stem.  The  controlled
pressure is applied over the entire effective bellows area, and the valve-stem travel is measured
by means of a depth micrometer. A typical gas lift valve probe tester is shown in Fig. 12.21.10
The bellows-assembly load rate is the slope of the pressure vs. stem travel best-fit straight line
in the linear portion of the curve in Fig. 12.22.10

The best-fit straight line represents an average between the stem travel measured for increas-
ing and decreasing probe-tester pressures. The increase in nitrogen-charged dome pressure with
stem travel is negligible, as compared with the load rate of a bellows-assembly in most bellows-
charged  gas  lift  valves.  The  load  rate  of  a  bellows  assembly,  which  is  analogous  to  the  load
rate of a helical spring, is far greater than the effect of the increase in dome pressure resulting
from the decrease in dome capacity for the stem travel required to open a typical gas lift valve.
The  measured  bellows-assembly  load  rate  is  not  identical  for  all  gas  lift  valves  with  the
same size bellows. The typical three-ply, seamless Monel bellows that is used in many 1.5-in.-
OD  gas  lift  valves  has  a  reported  effective  bellows  area  of  0.77  in.2.  The  typical  bellows-
assembly load rate for a valve with a nitrogen-charged bellows ranges from 400 to 600 psi/in.
in  the  linear  portion  of  the  curve  for  a  valve  with  a  test-rack  opening  pressure  between  600

and  1,200  psig.  The  three-ply,  seamless  Monel  bellows  in  the  1-in.-OD  valve  has  a  reported
effective area of 0.31 in.2 and a bellows-assembly load-rate range of 1,200 to 2,200 psi/in. for
a  valve  with  a  nitrogen-charged  bellows  and  a  test-rack  opening  pressure  between  600  and
1,200 psig. The bellows-assembly load rate for a spring-loaded 1-in.-OD valve can range from
near 2,000 to more than 3,500 psi/in. It is similar to the load rate of a spring. The load rate of
a  spring  depends  on  the  wire  size,  material,  and  number  of  free  coils.  The  purpose  in  noting
the magnitude of the bellows-assembly load rate for typical gas lift valves is to emphasize the
fact  that  an  unbalanced,  single-element,  gas  lift  valve  will  not  “snap”  open.  An  increase  in
injection-gas  pressure,  or  in  flowing-production  pressure,  or  a  combination  of  an  increase  in
both pressures, is necessary to stroke the valve stem. The larger-OD gas lift valves should be
selected  for  installations  requiring  high  injection-gas  rates  because  the  smaller  valves  do  not
have the same gas throughput rate performance as the larger-OD valve with the same port size.
Valves with the smaller bellows assembly are not recommended for low-pressure injection-gas
systems that may be used to gas lift shallow wells. The low closing force and bellows stiffness
can result in leaking valve seats because of poor ball/seat seating characteristics at low injection-
gas valve opening pressures.

12.6.9 Static Force-Balance Equations for Unbalanced, Single-Element, Bellows-Charged Gas
Lift Valves.  Most  gas  lift  equipment  manufacturers  test-rack  set  valve  opening  pressures  are
based  on  60°F  for  nitrogen-charged  gas  lift  valves.  The  valve  is  submerged  in  a  60°F  water
bath to ensure a constant nitrogen temperature in the bellows of each valve during the test-rack
setting  procedure.  The  initial  test-rack  opening  pressure  is  measured  with  the  tester  pressure
applied  over  the  effective  bellows  area  less  the  ball/seat  contact  area  while  atmospheric  pres-
sure (0 psig) is exerted over the ball/seat contact area. The valve actually is closed and begins

IV-552

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

to open from an opening force that is slightly greater than the closing force. The tester gas rate
through the valve seat is very low. Although most gas lift valves are set with an initial opening
pressure, certain types of valves with high production-pressure factors and valves with unique
construction may be set at test-rack closing pressures.

The test-rack closing pressure is obtained by bleeding the tester gas from the downstream
side of a gas lift valve. This theoretical closing pressure is noted when the downstream pres-
sure  continues  to  decrease  and  the  upstream  pressures  remain  constant.  The  upstream  and
downstream pressures are equal momentarily at the instant a gas lift valve closes. An accurate
closing pressure is more difficult to observe than an initial opening pressure and can be affect-
ed  by  the  rate  of  decrease  in  the  tester  pressure  during  bleedoff  of  the  tester  gas.  An
encapsulating tester with gas capacity rather than a ring-type tester is recommended so that any
small  leaks  in  the  tester  piping  will  not  prevent  observation  of  the  true  gas  lift  valve  closing
pressure. The pressure should be bled off of the downstream side of the valve through a very
small orifice.

The equations for initial valve opening pressure in a tester and in a well, and a tester clos-
ing pressure, are based on static force-balance equations. These equations also apply to spring-
loaded gas lift valves. The spring-load effect replaces the bellows-charge pressure of the valve
as the closing force. Several manufacturers with spring-loaded gas lift valves report a test-rack
closing  pressure.  The  spring  is  adjusted  until  the  force  exerted  by  the  spring  is  equal  to  the
desired test-rack closing pressure. A base-temperature correction does not apply to the opening-
or closing-pressure calculations of spring-loaded gas lift valves. If the total closing force for a
gas lift valve is a combination of a bellows-charge pressure and a spring load, the spring-load
effect  must  be  subtracted  from  the  total  closing  force  to  obtain  the  bellows-charged-pressure
portion of this closing force before calculating the bellows charge pressure from well to tester
base temperature.

The following equations for the initial gas lift valve opening pressures in a tester and in a
well are derived for a bellows-charged injection-pressure-operated gas lift valve because most
gas lift installations are gas lifted with this type of valve In Fig. 12.23, (a) shows the determi-
nation  of  the  test-rack  opening  pressure,  Pvo,  by  flowing  supply  gas  at  a  low  rate  into  a  ring
type  tester  with  atmospheric  pressure  applied  to  the  port  area  and  in  (b)  the  test-rack  closing
pressure,  Pvct,  is  obtained  by  opening  the  gas  lift  valve,  closing  the  supply  valve,  and  slowly
bleeding off  the  encapsulating tester pressure  downstream  of  the  port.  In  (c),  the  initial valve
opening pressure in a well, PoD, is based on the injection-gas and flowing-production pressures
at valve depth. The injection-gas and flowing-production pressures are interchanged for produc-
tion-pressure-operated (fluid-operated) gas lift valves.

12.6.10 Initial Opening and Closing Pressures of an Unbalanced, Single-Element Gas Lift
Valve.  An understanding of the relationship between the initial opening and closing pressures
of an unbalanced, single-element gas lift valve is important for calculating gas lift installation
designs  and  analyzing  gas  lift  operations.  An  unbalanced,  single-element,  gas  lift  valve  does
not  have  a  constant  closing  pressure  as  noted  in  many  publications,  and  the  valve  does  not
“snap” fully open at the initial injection-gas opening pressure. This type of gas lift valve initial-
ly  opens  and  closes  at  the  same  injection-gas  pressure  if  the  flowing-production  pressure  and
valve temperature remain constant. In like manner, an unbalanced backpressure regulator opens
and closes at the same upstream pressure if the downstream pressure remains constant.

Fig. 12.24 shows a plot of the initial injection-gas opening pressure vs. the flowing-produc-
tion  pressure  curves  for  both  a  ¼-in.-  and  ½-in.-ID  sharp-edged  port  in  a  1.5-in.-OD  gas  lift
valve having an effective bellows area of 0.77 in.2. Most manufacturers use this bellows size in
the 1.5-in.-OD gas lift valve.

The  closing  force  for  an  unbalanced,  single-element  gas  lift  valve  is  assumed  to  remain
constant  for  this  analysis.  The  gas  lift  valve  is  actually  closed  on  the  line  that  represents  a
balance between the opening and closing forces in Fig. 12.24. The valve begins to open above
the line and is closed below the line. The valve can be opened by increasing the injection-gas
pressure with a constant flowing-production pressure, increasing both the injection-gas and flow-
ing-production pressures simultaneously, and increasing the flowing-production pressure with a
constant injection-gas pressure.

gle-element, gas lift valves with a 0.77-in.2 effective bellows area and a ¼-in.-ID and a ½-in.-ID sharp-edged
seats.

12.7 Production-Pressure Factor and Valve Spread
The production-pressure factor, Fp, is a relationship based on the effective bellows and ball/seat-
contact areas for an unbalanced gas lift valve. Unbalanced implies that the flowing-production
pressure is exerted over the entire ball/seat contact area as a portion of the initial opening force
for a valve. In terms of gas lift valve operation, the production-pressure factor is the ratio of
the  incremental  difference  in  the  initial  injection-gas  opening  pressures  to  a  difference  in  the
corresponding  flowing-production  pressures.  If  the  flowing-production  pressure  increases,  the
initial injection-gas opening pressure decreases, and vice versa. The production-pressure factor
can  be  obtained  from  the  slope  of  the  force-balance  lines  in  Fig.  12.24  or  can  be  calculated
from the specifications for the valve.

Valve spread is defined as the difference between the initial injection-gas opening and the
injection-gas closing pressures of a gas lift valve. The valve spread is zero for a constant flowing-
production  pressure  because  a  valve  initially  opens  and  closes  at  the  same  injection-gas
pressure. The valve spread observed in intermittent gas lift operations results from a large port

IV-556

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

and the change in the flowing-production pressure at the depth of the operating gas lift valve
during an injection-gas cycle. The production pressure at valve depth approaches the injection-
gas  pressure  beneath  a  liquid  slug  during  gas  injection,  thus  decreasing  the  valve  closing
pressure,  which  results  in  a  spread  between  the  initial  opening  and  closing  pressures  of  the
operating  valve.  This  can  be  a  very  important  consideration  for  a  chamber-lift  installation
where the initial opening pressure of the operating gas lift valve is high because of low tubing
pressure. The operating gas lift valve is located above the chamber, and the tubing pressure, at
valve depth exerted over the ball/seat contact area when the valve initially opens, is very low.
The tubing pressure may approach the injection-gas pressure at the time the valve closes, thus
resulting in a low closing pressure.

12.7.1 Injection-Gas Volumetric Throughput Rates for a Fixed Choke Compared to Unbal-
anced,  Single-Element  Gas  Lift  Valves.    The  difference  in  the  injection-gas  rate  throughput
performance of unbalanced, single-element, injection-pressure-operated gas lift valves and a fixed-
size choke is illustrated in Fig. 12.25. The flowing-production pressure is a constant 500 psig.
The gas lift valves have an injection-gas initial opening pressure of 1,000 psig. As soon as the
injection-gas pressure exceeds 500 psig, injection gas enters the production conduit through the
¼-in.-ID choke. The injection-pressure-operated gas lift valves are backpressure regulators and
metering devices because of the bellows-assembly load rate. These valves prevent injection-gas
entry  into  production  conduit  until  the  injection-gas  pressure  exceeds  the  1,000-psig  set  pres-
sure.  The  difference  in  the  injection-gas  throughput  performance  of  these  two  gas  lift  valves
with  the  same  ¼-in.-ID  sharp-edged  port  is  from  the  bellow-assembly  load  rates.  A  greater
injection-gas pressure increase is required to stroke the valve stem of the valve with the higher
load rate.

The effective area of the bellows, the bellows-assembly load rate, the stem/seat configura-
tion, and the linear valve-stem travel control the injection-gas throughput performance of a gas
lift valve. The 1-in.-OD valve with a 0.31-in.2 bellows area has the higher load rate of 1,800 psi/
in., and the 1.5-in.-OD valve with a 0.77-in.2 bellows area has the lower load rate of 400 psi/in.

12.8 Dynamic Gas Lift Valve Performance
The importance of gas lift valve performance in the design of a gas lift installation is primarily
dependent upon the maximum required injection-gas rates through the gas lift valves to unload
and gas lift a well. Dynamic testing of gas lift valves indicated a noticeable difference in the
performance  of  the  1-in.-  and  1.5-in.-OD  gas  lift  valves.  Although  both  OD  of  these  gas  lift
valves had the same port size, the 1.5-in.-OD valve with the larger bellows had a much higher
injection-gas throughput rate for the same increase in the injection-gas pressure above the ini-
tial  valve  opening  pressure.  For  this  reason,  the  larger-OD  gas  lift  valve  with  a  0.77-in.2
bellows area is recommended for gas lifting high-rate wells with large tubing.

In  recent  years,  there  has  been  considerable  interest  in  the  actual  injection-gas  throughput
rates of gas lift valves. API RP 11V213 presents the recommended methods for testing gas lift
valves. A single-element unbalanced gas lift valve has two fundamental characteristics that are
determined  from  a  probe  test.  The  procedure  for  performing  the  probe  test  is  outlined  in  RP
11V2. These characteristics are the bellows-assembly load rate or spring rate and the approxi-
mate effective linear travel of the valve stem. The required valve-stem travel to ensure a fully
open  port  increases  with  the  valve  port  size,  as  shown  in  Fig.  12.18,  for  gas  lift  valves  with
square,  sharp-edged  seats.  If  the  maximum  linear  stem  travel  is  less  than  required  for  a  fully
open  port  area,  the  injection-gas  throughput  will  be  less  than  the  gas  rate  through  an  orifice
with an area equal to the port area.

Gas lift design and operation can be divided into two categories on the basis of the primary
opening force. If a valve is opened primarily by an increase in the injection-gas pressure in the
casing, the valve is called an injection-pressure-operated gas lift valve. A production-pressure-

operated  valve  is  opened  primarily  by  an  increase  in  the  flowing-production  pressure  in  the
tubing at valve depth.

The  typical  standardized  bellows  sizes  are  0.31  in.2  for  1-in.-OD  gas  lift  valves  and  0.77
in.2 for the 1.5-in.-OD valve. There are other sizes of bellows and smaller-OD gas lift valves
for special clearance applications that will not be included in this section. The OD of a gas lift
valve does not ensure the bellows size. The 1.5-in.-OD gas lift valve may have a smaller bel-
lows. The published specifications for a valve indicate the bellows size.

pressure  being  applied  over  a  major  portion  of  the  effective  bellows  area.  It  is  impractical  to
attempt to open these valves by increasing the flowing-production pressure that acts on a much
smaller  area.  Theoretically,  a  several  hundred  or  thousand  psi  increase  is  required  to  fully
stroke these valves by only increasing the flowing-production pressure.

Operators should recognize the possibility of limited injection-gas passage of gas lift valves
for gas lifting high-rate wells through large tubing or casing annulus. An injection-gas through-
put  rate  based  on  a  fully  open  port  size  should  not  be  assumed  for  the  larger  port  sizes  in
many unbalanced, single-element gas lift valves. For the maximum actual range in the injection-
gas pressure during typical gas lift unloading operations, the equivalent port area open for the
injection-gas flow is less than an area based on the reported port size for gas lift valves with a
large port area relative to the effective bellows area. Assuming that a 1-in. OD gas lift valve
with a large port has the valve stem travel to fully open, the necessary increases in the injection-
gas pressure to stroke the valve stem for this required travel may approach, or exceed, 200 psi
for a constant flowing-production pressure. Maximum valve-stem travel may also be limited by
manufacturing  tolerances  running  in  the  same  direction,  a  mechanical  stop,  or  by  the  bellows
stacking before a fully open port is achieved.

12.9 Design of Gas Lift Installations

12.9.1 Continuous Flow.  Continuous-flow gas lift is analogous to natural flow, but there are
generally two distinct flowing-pressure traverses. The traverse below the point of gas injection
includes  only  formation  gas;  whereas,  the  traverse  above  the  point  of  gas  injection  includes
both the formation and injection gases. These two distinct flowing-pressure traverses and their
corresponding gas/liquid ratios (GLR) are illustrated in Fig. 12.1.

There  are  numerous  gas  lift  installation  design  methods  offered  in  the  literature.  Several
installation designs require unique valve construction or gas lift-valve injection-gas throughput
performance. Only two design techniques are illustrated in this section: (1) a design based on a
constant decrease in the operating injection-gas pressure for each succeeding lower valve (this
design is essentially the same as the API gas lift design technique in RP 11V614), and (2) an
alternative design for wells requiring high injection-gas rates. The API design can be used on
the majority of wells in the United States. However, when high-volume lift and high injection-
gas rates are required, gas lift valve performance should be considered in the design. Both of
these techniques use the simple single-element-type, unbalanced, gas lift valve with a nitrogen-
charged  bellows.  This  type  of  valve  is  the  most  widely  used  in  the  industry  and  is  available
from all major gas lift equipment manufacturers.

Gas lift installation design calculations are divided into two parts. The first part is the deter-
mination  of  the  gas  lift  valve  depths,  and  the  second  part  is  the  calculation  of  the  test-rack
opening  pressures  of  the  gas  lift  valves.  The  opening  pressures  are  calculated  after  the  valve
depths  because  the  operating  injection-gas  and  flowing-production  pressures  and  temperatures
during unloading are based on these valve depths.

The primary objective of this section is to outline in detail installation design methods for
calculating the valve depths and the test-rack opening pressures of the gas lift valves that will
unload a well to a maximum depth of lift for the available injection-gas volume and pressure.
The  unloading  operations,  as  illustrated  by  the  two-pen  pressure  recorder  chart  in  Fig.  12.26,
should be automatic. The static-load-fluid level was near the surface in the casing and tubing
before initial unloading began. The wellhead pressure remains relatively constant during U-tub-
ing operations before injection gas enters the tubing for the first time through the top gas lift
valve. A surge in wellhead tubing pressure and a decrease in the injection-gas casing pressure
occur as the depth of gas injection transfers to each lower gas lift valve. As each lower gas lift
valve is uncovered, the valve immediately above closes, and the point of gas injection transfers
from  the  upper  to  the  lower  valve.  All  gas  lift  valves  above  an  operating  valve  should  be
closed and the valves below should be open in a properly designed gas lift installation.

12.9.2 Description of Unloading Operations for Continuous-Flow Gas Lift.  The  depths  of
the unloading gas lift valves are calculated to unload the kill (load) fluid to the design depth of

the operating valve with the injection-gas pressure and gas volume available at the wellsite. As
the  injection  gas  is  initially  injected  into  the  casing  annulus,  the  injection-gas  pressure  down-
stream  of  the  control  device  on  the  injection-gas  line  increases  as  the  load-fluid  level  in  the
casing annulus is lowered during U-tubing of the load fluid. The load fluid is transferred into
the tubing through the open gas lift valves in a well with a packer, or through the open gas lift
valves and lower end of the tubing in a well without a packer. Initial gas lift operations begin
after  the  first  gas  lift  valve  is  uncovered  and  injection  gas  enters  the  tubing  at  this  top-valve
depth.

The pressures in the casing and tubing are essentially equal at the instant a gas lift valve is
uncovered.  Immediately  after  injection  gas  begins  to  enter  the  tubing  through  the  next  lower
gas  lift  valve,  the  injection-gas  pressure  in  the  casing  begins  to  decrease  because  the  newly
uncovered gas lift valve is set to remain open at a lower injection-gas pressure than the unload-
ing  valve  above.  Less  and  less  injection  gas  enters  the  tubing  through  the  upper  unloading
valve.  The  injection-gas  rate  through  the  newly  uncovered  valve  increases  until  the  injection-
gas pressure in the casing decreases to the closing pressure of the upper unloading valve. The
depth of gas-injection transfer is complete when all injection gas is entering the tubing through
the lower valve and all upper gas lift valves are closed. The principles of continuous-flow oper-
ation are illustrated by a pressure/depth diagram shown in Fig. 12.27.

As injection gas enters the tubing through a newly uncovered valve, the flowing-production
pressure decreases. The injection-gas pressure in the casing begins to increase from a decreas-
ing  opening  force  from  a  lower  flowing-production  pressure  at  the  valve  depth  and  the  need
for stroking the valve stem to increase the injection-gas rate into the tubing for uncovering the
next  lower  valve.  The  increase  in  the  injection-gas  pressure  above  the  initial  valve  opening
pressure  at  valve  depth  for  passing  the  injection-gas  rate  to  establish  the  flowing-production
transfer pressure must be determined. This maximum injection-gas pressure required to stroke
the valve stem sufficiently to pass the injection-gas rate necessary to transfer the depth of gas
injection to the next lower valve depends on the gas lift valve performance. The valve port ID,
bellow-assembly  load  rate,  and  linear  stem  travel  control  the  gas  lift  valve  performance.  The
design  maximum  injection-gas  pressure  for  establishing  the  flowing-production  transfer  pres-
sure from a lower valve during unloading should not result in reopening any of the upper gas

lift valves. In Fig. 12.27, the injection gas is entering the production conduit through the fourth
gas lift valve and the three upper unloading gas lift valves are closed. Although the bottom gas
lift valve is open, no injection gas can enter this valve at depth D5 because the flowing-produc-
tion  pressure  exceeds  the  injection-gas  pressure  at  this  depth.  The  flowing-pressure-at-depth
traverse gradient, gpfa, above the operating gas lift valve depth, Dov, includes the injection- plus
the  formation-gas  production,  and  the  flowing-pressure-at-depth  traverse  gradient,  gpfb,  below
Dov contains only formation-gas production.

12.9.3 Initial  Installation  Design  Considerations.    Continuous-flow  installation  designs  vary
depending on whether complete and precise well data are known. Reliable inflow well perfor-
mance  and  an  accurate  multiphase-flow  correlation  are  required  to  establish  the  approximate
point of gas injection in deep wells. When the well data are limited or questionable, the exact
point  of  gas  injection  cannot  be  calculated  accurately  in  many  wells.  If  there  is  insufficient
injection-gas pressure to reach the bottom of the well, a desired depth of gas injection may not
be possible. If there is no change in injection-gas pressure or well conditions, the point of gas
injection should remain at the maximum depth for the life of the gas lift installation.

Retrievable  gas  lift  valve  mandrels  are  installed  (usually  with  dummy  valves  in  place)  in
many  wells  before  little,  if  any,  well-production  information  is  available.  The  engineer  must
locate these mandrels in wells before gas lift is required. The design considerations are similar
for wells with a changing point of gas injection. In general, many gas lift installations are in
this category, in which accurate well data are unknown or limited and the point of gas injec-
tion is unknown and/or changing as the reservoir is depleted.

12.10 Installation Design Methods
The two installation design methods given in this chapter can be classified as: (1) the decreas-
ing  injection-gas  pressure  design  in  API14,  and  (2)  a  variation  of  the  decreasing  injection-gas
pressure design that considers valve performance at each station.15 Valves with small production-
pressure  factors,  Fp,  are  recommended  for  the  decreasing  injection-gas  pressure  installation
design  method.  Valves  with  a  small  Fp  (under  0.2)  are  sensitive  primarily  to  a  change  in  the
injection-gas pressure. A decrease in the surface operating injection-gas pressure for each lower

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

gas lift valve is essential to ensure the closure of upper unloading valves after gas injection has
been  established  through  a  lower  operating  valve.  This  design  is  particularly  applicable  when
the available injection-gas pressure is high relative to the required depth of lift and an addition-
al incremental decrease in injection-gas pressure can be added between valves.

If gas lift valves with large ports are required to pass sufficient gas rates for unloading and
lifting a well, the design that incorporates valve performance should be used. Generally, if the
operating valve is not near the packer, the calculated point of gas injection will be bracketed
by installing at least one valve below the calculated operating valve depth in the event there is
a slight error in the well information or a change in well conditions.

12.10.1 Assumptions and Safety Factors in the Simplified Continuous-Flow Installation De-
sign Methods Without Consideration of Gas Lift Valve Performance.  Safety factors are used
for continuous-flow gas lift installation design with unbalanced, single-element, gas lift valves
when the load rate and the gas throughput performance of the valve are not considered in the
calculations.  The  initial  gas  lift  valve  opening  pressures  are  based  on  the  static  force-balance
equations.  Safety  factors  allow  the  injection-gas  and/or  the  flowing-production  pressure  to  in-
crease  at  valve  depth,  which  is  needed  to  properly  stroke  the  valve  stem  and  provide  the
equivalent  port  area  required  to  pass  the  injection-gas  rate  necessary  for  unloading  and  gas
lifting most wells. The following safety factors compensate for the fact that most operators set
the gas lift valves to the nearest tubing joint. The actual depth of the gas lift valve is usually
within 15 ft of the calculated depth.

1. The  operating  injection-gas  pressure  used  for  the  installation  design  calculations  should
be  the  average and  not  the  maximum injection-gas pressure  available at  the  wellsite for  most
wells. In special cases, a kick-off pressure can be used.

2. The unloading daily production rate is assumed equal to the design daily production rate.
Generally,  the  actual  unloading  daily  production  rate  may  be  less  than  the  design  production
rate and can be controlled at the surface by the injection-gas rate.

3. No formation gas is produced during the unloading operations. The total gas/liquid ratio

is based on the daily injection-gas rate available for unloading the well.

4. The flowing-pressure-at-depth traverses above the unloading gas lift valves are assumed

to be straight lines for the design calculations.

5. The  unloading  flowing-temperature-at-depth  traverse  is  assumed  to  be  a  straight  rather
than a curved line between an assigned unloading flowing wellhead temperature, Twhu, and the
bottomhole temperature, Twsd.

The  design  surface  unloading  flowing  temperature  generally  is  assumed  to  be  lower  than
the  final,  operating  temperature.  A  final  flowing  temperature  that  is  slightly  higher  than  the
design  temperature  increases  the  initial  opening  pressure  of  a  bellows-charged  gas  lift  valve
and aids in keeping the upper valves closed while lifting from a lower gas lift valve.

1. An assigned valve-spacing pressure differential, ΔPsD, of 20 to 60 psi across a valve for
unloading is used by many gas lift design engineers. As a result, the actual minimum flowing-
production  pressure  required  to  uncover  the  next  lower  unloading  gas  lift  valve  is  greater  by
the assigned ΔPsD.

2. The  flowing-pressure  traverse  below  the  point  of  gas  injection  for  locating  the  valve
depths is normally assumed to be the static-load-fluid gradient. Once formation production oc-
curs, the actual flowing pressure gradient decreases in most wells.

12.10.2 An Orifice-Check Valve for the Operating Gas Lift Valve in Continuous-Flow Instal-
lations.  An orifice being used for gas lifting a well should include a reverse-flow check valve.
The check disk, or dart, should be closed by gravity or spring loaded. In a well with a packer,
the check portion should remain closed to prevent debris from accumulating on top of the pack-
er  when  this  valve  is  below  the  working  fluid  level  and  is  not  the  operating  valve.  An  inlet

IV-562

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

screen  is  recommended  for  orifice-check  valves  with  a  small  choke  to  prevent  possible  plug-
ging. The individual openings in the inlet screen should be smaller than the choke in the orifice-
check valve.

A  properly  designed  continuous-flow  gas  lift  installation  with  an  orifice-check  valve  does
not have a higher injection-gas requirement than the same well with an injection-pressure-oper-
ated gas lift valve. The injection-gas rate for lifting a well is controlled by the metering device
on  the  injection-gas  line  at  the  surface.  An  orifice-check  valve  rather  than  a  more  expensive
and complicated pressure-operated gas lift valve should be considered for the bottom valve in
most continuous-flow installations.

Advantages of an Orifice-Check Valve.  The orifice-check valve is the simplest of all types
of  operating  valves  and  has  a  very  low  possibility  of  malfunction.  It  can  be  used  as  a  “flag”
because  of  the  change  in  the  surface  injection-gas  pressure  downstream  of  the  control  valve
when the orifice-check valve is uncovered and becomes the point of gas injection. Fig. 12.28
illustrates an unloading operation using an orifice-check valve on bottom. The heading flowing
wellhead  tubing  pressure  is  the  result  of  the  opening  and  closing  of  the  unloading  gas  lift
valves because of a 
∕64
24 -in. choke in the flowline and a frictional drag mechanism in the valve
to prevent stem shatter. After the orifice-check valve is uncovered at approximately 3:00 a.m.,
there is no heading. The operating injection-gas pressure decrease is the result of low reservoir
deliverability and not the gas lift system. A properly sized orifice-check valve can prevent se-
vere heading or surging in a continuous-flow gas lift installation by ensuring a constant orifice
size.  No  injection-gas  pressure  increase  is  required  to  stroke  an  orifice-check  valve,  and  the
orifice  size  is  always  known  because  it  is  equal  to  the  choke  size  in  the  valve.  The  orifice-
check  valve  is  always  open  and  passes  gas  as  long  as  injection-gas  pressure  at  valve  depth
exceeds the flowing-production pressure at the same depth. A properly sized orifice is required
to  control  the  injection-gas  volume  for  gas  lifting  some  wells.  One  application  is  gas  lifting
one zone of a dual gas lift installation with a common injection-gas source in the casing annu-
lus. A design pressure differential of at least 100 to 200 psi across the orifice is necessary to
ensure a reasonably accurate gas-passage prediction.

Disadvantages of the Orifice-Check Valve.  If the injection-gas-line pressure is high, relative
to  the  flowing-production  pressure  at  the  orifice-check  valve  depth,  freezing  can  occur  at  the
surface if wet gas is used. The weak wells with an orifice-check operating valve will continue
to  consume  injection  gas  at  lower  injection-gas-line  pressure  than  stronger  wells  with  higher
flowing-production pressures at the depth of the operating orifice-check valve.

A  hole  in  the  tubing  or  a  leaking  packer  is  indistinguishable  from  an  orifice-check  valve
during a normal, uninterrupted, continuous-flow gas lift operation. An orifice-check valve gen-
erally is not recommended for a small closed rotative gas lift system when costly makeup gas
is  required  to  charge  the  system  after  a  shutdown.  A  properly  set  injection-pressure-operated
gas lift valve closes after a slight decrease in the injection-gas pressure and prevents the unnec-
essary loss of injection gas from the casing annulus and the small high-pressure system.

12.10.3 Depth  of  the  Top  Gas  Lift  Valve.    The  top  gas  lift  valve  should  be  located  at  the
maximum depth that permits U-tubing the load fluid from this depth with the available injection-
gas  pressure.  If  the  well  is  loaded to  the  surface  with  a  kill fluid,  the  depth  of  the  top  valve
can be calculated with one of the following equations.

Dv1 =

Pk o − Pwhu

and

Dv1 = depth of top valve, ft,

Pwhu = surface wellhead U-tubing (unloading) pressure, psig,
ΔPsD = assigned spacing pressure differential at valve depth, psi,
gls = static load (kill)-fluid pressure gradient, psi/ft,

ggio = injection-gas pressure-at-depth gradient, psi/ft.
Eq.  12.29  does  not  include  the  increase  in  the  injection-gas  pressure  to  the  valve  depth,
Dv1.  This  equation  is  widely  used  because  of  a  safety  factor  from  neglecting  this  increase  in
gas pressure with depth. Eq. 12.30 yields the same depth as a graphical solution without any
pressure  drop  across  the  top  gas  lift  valve  at  the  instant  this  valve  is  uncovered.  In  other
words, the top valve is not uncovered if the actual kick-off injection-gas pressure is less than
the  design  value  or  if  the  U-tubing  wellhead  pressure  is  higher  than  assumed.  Eq.  12.31  in-
cludes injection-gas column weight and an assigned pressure differential at the instant the top
valve is uncovered.

IV-564

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

The surface U-tubing wellhead pressure is less than the flowing wellhead pressure for most
installations. The difference between these two pressures increases for longer flowlines and high-
er production rates. The wellhead U-tubing pressure is approximately equal to the separator or
production-header pressure because the rate of load fluid transfer is very low during the U-tub-
ing  operation  and  no  injection  gas  can  enter  the  flowline  until  the  top  gas  lift  valve  is
uncovered.  Gas  lift  operations  do  not  begin  until  injection  gas  enters  the  production  conduit
through  the  top  valve.  Flowing  wellhead  pressure  should  be  used  to  locate  the  depths  of  the
remaining gas lift valves.

A load-fluid traverse based on gls can be drawn from the wellhead U-tubing pressure to the
intersection of  the  kick-off  injection-gas pressure-at-depth curve  (PkoD  traverse)  on  a  pressure/
depth plot. The top valve may be located at this intersection, which is the same depth as calcu-
lated with Eq. 12.30. An arbitrary pressure drop across the top gas lift valve can be assumed in
conjunction with the graphical method, and this technique is the same as Eq. 12.31. If no gas
pressure increase with depth is assumed, this method becomes similar to the calculation of Dv1
with Eq. 12.29. For simplicity, Eq. 12.28 is often used for top-valve spacing calculations.

12.10.4 Multiphase-Flow Correlations and Flowing-Pressure-at-Depth Gradient Curves.  Ac-
curate  flowing-pressure-at-depth  predictions  are  essential  for  good  continuous-flow  gas  lift
installation  design  and  analysis.  When  computer  programs  for  gas  lift  installation  design  and
analysis are unavailable for daily routine calculations, the gas lift designers must rely on pub-
lished gradient curves to determine flowing pressures at depth. Many oil-producing companies
have  their  own  multiphase-flow  correlations  and  publish  in-house  gradient  curves.  Gradient
curves  are  available  from  the  gas  lift  manufacturers  and  are  published  in  books  that  can  be
purchased. Where possible, use field data to verify the accuracy of the computer program calcu-
lations and gradient curves. It is not the purpose of this chapter to compare the various multiphase-
flow correlations or published gradient curves.

The widely accepted multiphase-flow correlations and mechanistic models are based on pseu-
do-steady  state  flow  without  serious  heading  through  a  clean  production  conduit  with  an
unrestricted  cross-sectional  area.  Accurate  pressures  cannot  be  obtained  from  gradient  curves
based on these correlations if the conduit is partially plugged with paraffin or scale. Emulsions
also can prevent the application of these correlations and gradient curves. The applicability of a
particular correlation or set of gradient curves for a given well can be established only by com-
paring a measured flowing pressure to a pressure at depth determined from the correlation or
gradient curves. The measured production data must be accurate and repeatable before discount-
ing the multiphase-flow correlations or gradient curves.

A  set  of  typical gradient curves  is  given  in  Fig. 12.29.  These  gradient curves  are  used  in
the example installation design calculations in Example Problem 4. GLR and not gas/oil ratio
(GOR) is used for these installation design calculations.

Most  gradient  curves  display  GLR  rather  than  GOR.  For  this  reason,  the  first  step  in  the
application of gradient curves is to convert GOR to GLR, if only GOR is reported and the well
produces water. The GLR can be calculated for a given GOR and water cut with Eq. 12.32.

Rglf = fo(Rgo), ........................................................... (12.32)

where

and

Rglf = formation gas/liquid ratio, scf/STB,
fo = oil cut (l – fw), fraction,

Rgo = gas/oil ratio, scf/STB.

• Water cut fw = 0.60 (60%)
Calculate the formation GLR:
Rglf = (1 – 0.6) 500 = 200 scf/STB.
When gradient curves are used, the depth is a relative depth and may be shifted, whereas
pressure  is  never  shifted.  If  a  flowing-pressure-at-depth  traverse  is  being  traced,  the  pressures

IV-566

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

on the pressure/depth plot must always overlie the same pressures on the gradient curves. For
deviated wells where friction is small, use true vertical depths rather than measured depths in a
graphical design.

12.10.5 Flowing  Temperature  at  Depth.    The  accurate  prediction  of  the  flowing-production
fluid temperature at valve depth is important in the design and analysis of many gas lift instal-
lations with nitrogen-charged gas lift valves. The temperature of a wireline-retrievable valve is
assumed to be the same as the temperature of the flowing fluids at the valve depth. A retriev-
able gas lift valve is located in a mandrel pocket inside the tubing and is in contact with the
production from the well. The temperature of a conventional valve is between the flowing fluid
temperature and the geothermal temperature for the well but is normally closer to the flowing
fluid temperature because steel has higher thermal conductivity than gas.

Kirkpatrick16  published  one  of  the  most  widely  used  flowing-temperature-gradient  correla-
tions in 1959. The family of flowing-temperature-gradient curves in Fig. 12.30 is based on data
from  high-water-cut  wells  being  produced  by  gas  lift  through  2⅞-in.-OD  tubing  over  a  wide
range of production rates. Although the correlation does not include several important parame-
ters, such as GLR and fluid properties, the estimated surface temperature and temperatures at
depth  have  proved  to  be  reasonably  accurate  for  many  gas  lift  operations.  Sagar  et  al.17  pub-
lished another flowing-temperature correlation. This empirical method for calculating flowing-
temperature  profiles  is  far  more  rigorous  and  is  based  on  well  data  from  several  areas.  The
calculation procedure can be programmed easily for predicting surface flowing temperatures in
vertical and inclined wells. However, the best approach, when possible, is to measure the tem-
perature-at-depth traverse in the actual gas lift well.

12.10.6 Continuous-Flow Installation Design Based on a Constant Decrease in the Operating
Injection-Gas Pressure for Each Succeeding Lower Gas Lift Valve (API Design Technique).
This installation design method is based on all gas lift valves having the same port size and a
constant  decrease  in  the  operating  injection-gas  pressure  for  each  succeeding  lower  gas  lift
valve.  The  gas  lift  valve  selection  must  be  based  on  a  port  size  that  allows  the  injection-gas
throughput  required  for  unloading  and  gas  lifting  the  well.  This  installation  design  method  is
recommended for gas lift valves with a small production-pressure factor. When the ratio of the
port area to the bellows area is low, the decrease in the injection-gas pressure between gas lift
valves,  based  on  the  additional  tubing-effect  pressure  for  the  top  valve,  is  not  excessive.  The
effect of bellows-assembly load rate on the performance of the gas lift valves is not considered
in  the  installation  design  calculations.  Safety  factors  included  in  these  design  calculations
should  allow  sufficient  increase  in  the  operating  injection-gas  pressure,  which  is  necessary  to
provide the valve-stem travel for adequate injection-gas passage through each successively low-
er unloading gas lift valve without excessive interference from upper valves.

Selection  of  a  constant  injection-gas  pressure  decrease,  or  drop,  in  the  surface  operating-
injection-gas  pressure  for  each  succeeding  lower  gas  lift  valve  should  not  be  arbitrary,  as
proposed in some design methods. The pressure decrease should be based on the gas lift valve
specifications to minimize the possibility of upper valves remaining open while lifting from a
lower valve. The additional tubing-effect pressure for the top gas lift valve is a logical choice
for  this decrease in  the operating injection-gas pressure between valves. Closing or  reopening
of an injection-pressure-operated gas lift valve is partially controlled by the production-pressure
effect, which is equal to the production-pressure factor for the valve multiplied by the differ-
ence flowing-production pressure at the top valve depth.

The flowing-production pressure at an unloading-valve depth changes from the transfer pres-
sure, (PpfD)min, to a higher flowing-production pressure after the next lower valve becomes the
operating  valve.  The  additional  tubing-effect  pressure  is  the  difference  between  (PpfD)min  and

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

IV-567

geothermal gradients.

the  maximum  flowing-production  pressure,  at  the  unloading  valve  depth,  (PpfD)max,  after  the
point of gas injection has transferred to this next lower valve. As the unloading gas lift valve
depths increase, the distance between valves and the difference between (PpfD)min and (PpfD)max
decrease. Although the additional tubing-effect pressure decreases for lower valves, the injection-
gas  requirement  for  unloading  increases  with  depth.  An  increased  stem  travel,  or  stroke,  is
usually  needed  for  the  lower  valves  to  generate  the  larger  equivalent  port  area  necessary  for
the  higher  injection-gas  requirements  with  the  lower  pressure  differentials  that  occur  across
these  deeper  valves.  A  constant  decrease  in  the  operating  injection-gas  pressure  equal  to  the
additional tubing-effect pressure for the top valve allows a greater increase in the injection gas
above initial opening pressure for lower gas lift valves.

Another application for this simplified design method depends on the relationship between
the available injection-gas pressure and the flowing-production pressure at the maximum depth
of lift. When the injection-gas pressure significantly exceeds this flowing-production pressure,
an arbitrary decrease in the injection-gas pressure, ΔPio, can be added to the additional production-
pressure effect for the top valve for calculating the spacing and the initial opening pressures of
the unloading gas lift valves. The total decrease in the injection-gas pressure is distributed equal-
ly between each successively lower unloading gas lift valve rather than having a sizable injection-
pressure  drop  across  the  operating  gas  lift  or  orifice-check  valve.  This  procedure  reduces  the
possibility of multipoint gas injection through upper unloading gas lift valves by ensuring that
these valves remain closed after the point of gas injection has transferred to the next lower gas
lift valve.

Determination of Valve Depths.  Because this final injection-gas pressure is unknown until
the installation is designed, a pressure difference of at least 100 to 200 psi between the unload-
ing PioD and PpfD traverses is assumed for locating the deepest-valve depth. This assumption of

IV-568

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

(PioD – PpfD = 100 to 200 psi) should ensure calculation of the operating valve depth. The static
bottomhole  pressure,  Pwsd,  and  temperature,  Twsd,  generally  are  referenced  to  the  same  depth,
which  is  the  lower  end  of  the  production  conduit,  Dd.  The  steps  for  establishing  the  gas  lift
valve depths follow.

1. Calculate the maximum unloading GLR based on the maximum injection-gas rate avail-

able for unloading and the maximum daily design total fluid rate.

Rgl u =

qgiu
ql t

, ............................................................. (12.33)

where

and

qgiu = maximum unloading injection-gas rate, Mscf/D,
qlt = total liquid (oil + water) daily production rate, B/D,
Rgl = maximum unloading GLR, scf/STB,

Rglu = maximum unloading GLR, scf/STB.
2.  Calculate  with  a  multiphase-flow  computer  program  or  determine  from  an  appropriate
gradient  curve  the  unloading  flowing-production  pressure  at  the  lower  end  of  the  production
conduit, Ppfd at Dd, based on the installation design Rgl and qlt.

3. Calculate the unloading flowing-pressure-at-depth gradient above the point of gas injec-
tion,  gpf,  by  subtracting  the  wellhead  U-tubing  (unloading)  wellhead  pressure,  Pwhu,  from  the
flowing-production pressure, Ppfd at Dd, and dividing by the reference datum depth, Dd.

gpfa =

(P pfD − Pwhu)

Dd

. .................................................... (12.34)

The traverse above the point of gas injection will actually be a curved line representing a
fluid density that typically becomes increasingly less dense as it travels toward the surface. An
exception  to  this  is  the  case  of  high  GLRs  at  low  pressures  where  the  pressure  traverse  may
reverse  slope  near  the  surface.  However,  a  straight  line  is  used  because  it  will  be  easier  to
calculate the flowing-production pressure at valve depth, PpfD, than with an actual curved flowing-
pressure-at-depth  traverse.  This  assumption  normally  will  give  a  slightly  more  conservative
design.

4. Calculate the static injection-gas pressure at the lower end of the production conduit, Piod
at Dd, using Eq. 12.1 and the static injection-gas pressure-at-depth gradient, ggio, by subtracting
the  surface  injection-gas  pressure,  Pio,  from  Piod  at  Dd  and  dividing  by  the  reference  datum
depth, Dd.

ggio =

(Piod − Pio)

5. Calculate the unloading gas lift valve temperature-at-depth gradient, gTvu, by assuming a
straight line and subtracting the surface unloading flowing wellhead temperature, Twhu, from the
bottomhole temperature, Twsd at Dd, and dividing by the reference datum depth, Dd.

gTvu =

(Twsd −Twhu)

6. Calculate the depth of the top gas lift valve, Dv1, on the basis of the surface kick-off or
average field injection-gas pressure, Pko, static-load fluid gradient, gls, and the wellhead U-tub-
ing unloading pressure, Pwhu, with either Eqs. 12.29, 12.30, or 12.31. Eq. 12.31 is used in this
example.  The  flowing  wellhead  pressure,  Pwhf,  and  the  wellhead  unloading  U-tubing  pressure,
Pwhu, are considered equal in the API Design.

7. Calculate the minimum flowing-production pressure, (PpfD1)min, the injection-gas pressure,
PioD1, and the unloading gas lift valve temperature, TvuD1, at the top valve depth by multiplying
the appropriate gradient by the valve depth, Dv1, and adding to the appropriate surface values
(where n = 1 for top valve):

P pfD(n) min = Pwhu + gpfa Dv(n)

. .......................................... (12.37)

PioD(n) = Pio + ggio Dv(n)

. ................................................ (12.38)

TvuD(n) = Twhu + gTvu Dv(n)

. ............................................... (12.39)

8.  Calculate  the  depth  of  the  second  gas  lift  valve,  Dv2,  where  n  =  2,  on  the  basis  of  the
assigned  minimum  decrease  in  surface  injection-gas  pressure,  Δpio,  for  spacing  the  gas  lift
valves  and  the  PioD  traverse.  A  valve-spacing  differential  of  approximately  20  to  30  psi  will
usually be sufficient for most 1.5-in.-OD gas lift valves. However, 1-in.-OD valves with large
ports may require a higher Δpio. This can be checked by calculating the additional production-
pressure  effect,  ΔPpe1,  using  Eq.  12.49  after  the  valve  depths  are  calculated  for  the  assigned
Δpio. The distance between valves and valve depth are calculated as follows:

P pfD(n − 1) min + gl s(Dbv) = PioD(n − 1) − (n − 1)ΔPio − ΔPsD + ggio(Dbv) . ........ (12.40)
Solve for Dbv.

Dbv =

PioD(n − 1) − (n − 1)ΔPio − P pfD(n − 1) min − ΔPsD

(gl s − ggio)

, ...................... (12.41)

and

Dv(n) = Dv(n − 1) + Dbv . .................................................... (12.42)

The  decrease  in  surface  injection-gas  pressure  for  calculating  Dv2  is  ΔPio,  and  for  Dv3  is  2

Repeat  calculations  in  Step  7  at  second  valve  depth  by  calculating  (PpfD2)min,  PioD2,  and

TvuD2 with Eqs. 12.37, 12.38, and 12.39.

Repeat calculations in Step 8 for Dbv and Dv3 with Eqs. 12.41 and 12.42.
Repeat Steps 7 and 8 until the maximum desired valve depth, Dv(max), is attained. When the
calculated  distance  between  gas  lift  valves,  Dbv,  is  less  than  an  assigned  minimum  distance
between valves, Dbv(min), use Dbv(min).

sure for spacing the deepest valve. The port size and the test-rack setting pressures of the gas
lift valves are calculated as follows:

1. Determine the port size for the type of gas lift valves to be installed in the installation
on  the  basis  of  the  unloading  and  operating  injection-gas  requirements.  Correct  the  injection-
gas  rate  for  the  actual  gas  gravity  and  temperature  at  each  valve  depth  with  Eq.  12.6.
Determine from Fig. 12.13 the port ID needed to pass the required injection-gas rate with the
pressure  differential  available  at  the  operating  valve.  When  an  orifice-check  valve  is  selected
for  the  bottom  valve,  the  upstream  injection-gas  pressure,  P1,  should  be  equal  to  or  less  than
the  injection-gas  initial  valve  opening  pressure  of  the  last  unloading  valve,  corrected  to  the
depth of the orifice-check valve. The pressure differential across the orifice-check valve is the
difference between P1 and the downstream flowing-production pressure, P2, at the valve depth.
2.  Record  the  gas  lift  valve  specifications,  which  include  the  effective  bellows  area,  Ab,

port area, Ap, (Ap /Ab), (1 – Ap /Ab), and the production-pressure factor, Fp.

3. Calculate the injection-gas initial opening pressure at depth of the top gas lift valve, PoD1.

PioD1 = injection-gas pressure at valve depth, psig, and

7.  Determine  if  the  assumed  decrease  in  surface  injection-gas  pressure,  ΔPio,  is  sufficient
for the required gas lift valve port size by calculating the additional production-pressure effect,
ΔPpe1, at the top valve:

ΔP pe1 = Fp (P pfD1)max − (P pfD1)min . ....................................... (12.49)
If  ΔPpe1  is  less  than  or  equal  to  the  assumed  ΔPio,  proceed  with  the  design.  If  ΔPpe1  is
greater than the assumed ΔPio, then set ΔPio = ΔPpe1 and recalculate the spacing design. This is
a  conservative  approach,  and  many  operators  use  actual  operating  experience  to  determine
which ΔPio to use.

Repeat Steps 3 and 4 calculations for the second gas lift valve.
Repeat Steps 3, 4, and 5 calculations for remaining gas lift valves. If the operating valve is
an orifice-check valve, determine the orifice ID for lifting the well on the basis of the calculat-
ed upstream and downstream pressures, P1 and P2.

Because the difference between Ppfd and Piod, (Piod – Ppfd = 1,154 – 900 = 254 psi), exceeds

200 psi, the maximum valve depth of 5,970 ft can be attained.

(PpfD1)min = 100 + 0.1333 (1,957) = 361 psig.
PioD1 = 1,000 + 0.0257 (1,957) = 1,050 psig.
TvuD1 = 100 + 0.0117 (1,957) = 123°F.
8.  Calculate  Dbv  for  depth  of  second  valve,  Dv2,  where  ΔPioD2  =  20  psi,  using  Eqs.  12.41

and 12.42:

Dbv =

(0.46 − 0.0257)

= 1,472 ft and Dv2 = 1,957 + 1,472 = 3,429 ft .

Repeat Step 7: Calculate (PpfD2)min, PioD2, and TvuD2 at valve depth Dv2 = 3,429 ft.
(PpfD2)min = 557 psig, PioD2 = 1,088 psig, and TvuD2 = 140°F.
Repeat Step 8: Calculate depth of third valve, Dv3, where ΔPioD3 = 40 psi.
Dbv = 1,061 ft and Dv3 = 4,490 ft.

Repeat Step 8: Calculate depth of fourth valve, Dv4, where ΔPioD4 = 60 psi.

Repeat Step 8: Calculate depth of fifth valve, Dv5, where ΔPioD3 = 80 psi.
Dbv = 520 ft and Dv5 = 5,762 ft.
Repeat Step 7: Calculate (PpfD5)min, PioD5, and TvuD5 at valve depth Dv5 = 5,762 ft.
(PpfD5)min = 868 psig, PioD5 = 1,148 psig, and TvuD5 = 167°F.
The  calculated  valve  spacing  for  the  sixth  valve,  Dv6,  would  exceed  the  maximum  valve
depth, Dv(max), of 5,970 ft. Because an orifice-check valve will be placed in the bottom wireline-
retrievable valve mandrel, no test-rack valve setting information is required. This completes the
valve spacing calculations. A graphical representation of the valve installation design is shown
in Fig. 12.32.

Pressures. The gas lift valves port ID and test-rack opening pressure calculations are given next.

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

1. Determine the port size required for the gas lift unloading valves and the operating orifice-
check  valve  orifice  ID.  The  upstream  injection-gas  pressure,  P1,  is  based  on  PoD5  of  the  last
unloading valve using Eq. 12.47 corrected to the orifice-check valve depth of 5,970 ft.

P1 = 1,068 + 0.0257 (5,970 – 5,762) = 1,073 psig at 5,970 ft.
The downstream flowing-production pressure, P2, is equal to the minimum flowing-produc-

tion pressure at 5,970 ft with Eq. 12.37.

P2 = 100 + 0.1333 (5,970) = 896 psig at 5,970 ft.
ΔPov = 1,073 – 896 = 177 psi across the orifice-check valve.
From  Fig.  12.13,  the  required  equivalent  orifice  size  is  near  

 in.;  therefore,  the  next
largest  gas  lift  valve  port  ID  is  ¼  in.  This  size  is  sufficient  for  all  of  the  upper  unloading
valves  because  they  have  a  higher  injection-gas  operating  pressure  and  a  greater  differential
pressure between PioD and (PpfD)min. An equivalent orifice size of 
 in. is required to
pass the operating injection-gas rate of 500 Mscf/D.

(Ap/Ab) = 0.064, (1 – Ap/ Ab) = 0.936, and Fp = 0.068.
3. Calculate PoD1 with Eq. 12.43: PoD1 = 1,050 psig at 1,957 ft.
4.  Calculate  PbvD1  with  Eq.  12.44  for  CT1  =  0.876  (Calculated  with  Eq.  12.3  for  TvuD1  =

PbvD1 = 1,050(0.936) + 361(0.064) = 1,006 psig at 123°F .

8. Calculate ΔPpe1 with Eq. 12.49: ΔPpe1 = 0.068 (652 – 361) = 20 psi.
Because the ΔPpe1 of 20 psi is the same as the assumed ΔPio of 20 psi for spacing, a pres-
sure differential of 20 psi can be used for setting the valves. Note that if 1-in.-OD valves had
been used in this design, Fp = 0.188 for a ¼-in.-ID port and ΔPpe1 would be 55 psi.

Repeat Steps 6, 4, and 5 for remaining gas lift valves:
PoD2 = 1,035 psig at 3,429 ft, PbvD2 = 1,035 psig, CT 2 = 0.847 for TvuD2 = 140°F, and Pvo2

PoD3 = 1,075 psig at 4,490 ft, PbvD3 = 1,051 psig, CT 3 = 0.828 for TvuD3 = 152°F, and Pvo3

PoD4 = 1,075 psig at 5,242 ft, PbvD4 = 1,057 psig, CT 4 = 0.815 for TvuD4 = 161°F, and Pvo4

PoD5 = 1,068 psig at 5,762 ft, PbvD5 = 1,055 psig, CT 5 = 0.805 for TvuD5 = 167°F, and Pvo5

An  orifice-check  valve  is  recommended  for  the  sixth  valve  at  5,962  ft.  The  orifice  ID
should be ¼ in. to pass sufficient gas to gas lift the well. A tabulation form for these calcula-
tions is given in Table 12.3.

12.10.8 Continuous-Flow Installation Design When Injection-Gas Pressure is High, Relative
to Depth of Lift.  An additional incremental decrease in the injection-gas pressure can be added

IV-576

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

to the calculated decrease to ensure unloading a gas lift installation when the injection-gas pres-
sure is high, relative to the required depth of lift. The flowing-production pressure at the depth
of lift limits the maximum injection-gas pressure that can be used in terms of contributing to
the  lift  process.  The  higher  available  injection-gas  pressure  cannot  be  utilized  in  this  installa-
tion.  An  excessive  injection-gas  pressure  drop  across  the  operating  valve  represents  an  ineffi-
cient  energy  loss.  Distributing  the  decrease  in  the  injection-gas  pressure  between  each
successively lower unloading gas lift valve prevents multipoint gas injection through upper gas
lift valves after the point of gas injection transfers to a lower valve. In other words, the gas lift
installation can be unloaded without valve interference, and the unloading process is apparent
from  the  injection-gas  pressure  recording  at  the  surface.  A  high  available  injection-gas  pres-
sure,  relative  to  the  depth  of  lift,  may  exist  in  areas  where  both  shallow  and  deep  wells  are
being  gas  lifted  with  injection  gas  from  the  same  system.  The  flowing-production  pressure  in
the shallow wells limits the injection-gas pressure that can be used to gas lift these wells.

12.10.9 High Rate Continuous-Flow Installation Design.15  The  application  of  the  injection-
gas rate throughput performance for injection-pressure-operated gas lift valves is illustrated in
the high daily liquid rate continuous-flow installation design. The importance of valve perfor-
mance data for high daily injection-gas rates is shown, and their unimportance for low-injection-
gas-rate installation designs is illustrated. Valve performance data is of no value in selection of
the  top  two  unloading  gas  lift  valves  in  this  installation.  For  these  two  upper  valves,  an  as-
sumed  reasonable  decrease  in  the  surface  injection-gas  pressure  of  20  psi  for  each  valve
ensures unloading the well and these upper valves remaining closed while lifting from a lower
valve. When the required daily injection-gas rate increases for lifting from the third and fourth
gas  lift  valves,  valve  performance  information  becomes  very  important.  A  pressure-vs.-depth
plot for this continuous-flow installation is shown in Fig. 12.33.

Although  the  flowing-production  transfer-pressure-traverse  method  for  locating  the  depths
of  the  valves  may  require  an  additional  valve,  or  valves,  in  some  installations,  this  design
method has several advantages in wells requiring a high daily injection-gas rate for unloading.
Because  the  injection-gas  requirement  to  uncover  the  next  lower  valve  is  reduced,  smaller
valve ports can be used and the increase in the injection-gas pressure to stroke the valve stem
is  less.  The  unloading  operations  are  faster  because  of  the  lesser  difference  in  injection-gas
requirement  between  unloading  valves.  This  fact  is  of  more  importance  after  an  injection-gas
supply  interruption  when  several  wells  must  be  unloaded  and  the  total-system  available  daily
injection-gas volume is limited. The chance of heading and surging with a smaller port is re-
duced  because  a  change  in  flowing-production  pressure  has  a  lesser  affect  on  the  valve-stem
position. Bubble-tight seats are easier to achieve with small ports.

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

IV-577

Fig.  12.33—Pressure/depth  graphical  design  for  a  continuous-flow  gas  lift  installation  requiring  high
injection-gas rates for unloading and final gas lift operation.

The surface origin and final downhole termination pressures for the flowing-production trans-
fer-pressure  traverse  are  arbitrary.  The  20%  in  this  example  for  locating  the  surface  transfer-
pressure traverse is widely used. The unloading injection-gas requirements for uncovering each
lower  valve  increase  as  that  percentage  decreases  and  decrease  as  that  percentages  increases.
The flowing-production transfer pressure at datum depth should be at least 100 to 200 psi less
than the available design operating injection-gas pressure at the same depth. This flowing-pro-
duction  transfer  pressure  at  datum  depth  should  also  be  less  than  the  flowing-production
pressure at the same depth based on the design daily production rate and maximum total GLR.
The multiphase-fluid-flow correlation selected for these calculations can significantly affect
the  results.  Several  assumptions  for  calculating  the  depths  of  the  unloading  valves  are  very
conservative in this example (e.g., assuming a load-fluid pressure gradient below an unloading
valve after significant bottomhole-pressure drawdown and the assigned valve spacing pressure
differential of 50 psi at the next lower valve depth). These design calculations provide a com-
prehensive understanding of the overall well unloading process and operations. The installation
designer  can  modify  the  assumptions  on  the  basis  of  the  availability  and  accuracy  of  the
known well information.

IV-578

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

A  lower-than-the-design  daily  liquid-production  rate  is  assigned  for  spacing  the  unloading
valves until the flowing-bottomhole-pressure drawdown results in a calculated daily production
rate that exceeds the assigned rate. Typical assigned unloading daily liquid rates would be 200
to 400 B/D for 2⅜-in.-OD tubing and 400 to 600 B/D for 2⅞-in.-OD tubing. When the calcu-
lated  flowing-bottomhole-pressure  drawdown  results  in  a  higher  than  the  assigned  unloading
daily liquid production rate for the flowing-production transfer pressure at the depth of the op-
erating unloading valve, this higher rate is used for spacing the next lower unloading valve. A
1,000-B/D  unloading  rate  is  assigned  for  unloading  valves  before  a  higher  liquid  rate  occurs
from a flowing-bottomhole-pressure drawdown in this high-productivity well with large tubing.
The  assigned  design  flowing-wellhead  temperature  of  120°F  is  between  the  ambient  surface
temperature  and  the  flowing-well  fluids  temperature  at  the  design  daily  production  rate  from
the well.

Simplified Mathematical Gas Lift Valve Performance Model.  Because  performance  equa-
tions for specific gas lift valves are not available from gas lift valve manufacturers, a simpli-
fied  gas  lift  valve  performance  computer  model  was  used  to  illustrate  the  calculations  in  this
paper.  The  model  is  based  on  static  force-balance  equations  and  several  simplifying  assump-
tions.  This  computer  model  describes  qualitatively  the  injection-gas  rate  throughput  of  unbal-
anced, single-element gas lift valves using the Thornhill-Craver12 equation (Eq. 12.5).

For this computer model, the gas lift valve has a square sharp-edged seat and the stem tip
is a carbide ball with a  ∕16
1 -in. larger OD than the bore ID of the valve seat. The equivalent port
area for a partially open valve is defined by the lateral surface area of the frustum of a right
circular cone. The frustum area is generated between the surface of the ball and the valve seat-
line as the valve stem moves away from its seat. The bellows-assembly load rate is assumed to
be  linear  for  the  stem  travel  required  to  attain  a  given  equivalent  port  area,  and  there  is  no
increase in nitrogen-charged bellows pressure during this stem travel. The flow restriction and
the pressure loss, resulting from a check-valve assembly, are not included in the gas lift valve
model calculations. The same gas gravity, ratio of specific heats, and discharge coefficient are
used for all calculations.

There are many unknown dynamic quantities in terms of actual areas and pressures acting
on  these  areas  as  the  gas-flow  rate  through  a  valve  changes  with  valve-stem  travel.  For  the
valve performance calculations with a partially open port, the injection-gas pressure is assumed
to  act  over  the  effective  bellows  area  minus  the  port  ball/seat  contact  area.  Regardless  of  the
valve-stem  position,  the  flowing-production  pressure  is  applied  over  the  entire  port  ball/seat
contact  area.  These  assumptions  should  result  in  the  calculated  injection-gas  rate  being  less
than the actual rate. As the ball on the valve stem moves away from its seat during an increase
in  injection-gas  pressure,  the  two  areas  over  which  the  opening  pressures  are  applied  will
change. The bellows area exposed to the injection-gas pressure increases and the flowing-pro-
duction pressure approaches the injection-gas pressure downstream of the port as the equivalent
port  area  increases  in  the  variable-orifice  throttling  mode.  This  pressure  is  difficult  to  define
accurately because of the varying pressure loss as the equivalent port area changes with valve-
stem travel.

Although  several  of  the  assumptions  for  the  mathematical  valve  model  are  known  to  be
approximate,  the  predicted  performance  illustrates,  with  reasonable  accuracy,  the  manner  in
which  an  unbalanced,  injection-pressure-operated,  single-element  gas  lift  valve  operates  in  a
well. The valve performance curves, in the continuous-flow installation design, were calculated
using the computer model in Appendix A. The coefficient for Eq. A-9 in Appendix A is based
on  the  Thornhill-Craver  coefficient  of  155.5,  a  gas  gravity  of  0.65,  ratio  of  specific  heats  of
1.26, discharge coefficient of 0.865, and acceleration caused by gravity of 32.174.

gradient, ggio, with Eq. 12.35. The same operating injection-gas pressure at depth gradient, ggio,
is used for all calculations regardless of the surface injection-gas pressure. This is not a recom-
mended  procedure;  particularly,  for  high  injection-gas  pressures  in  deep  wells.  The  injection-
gas  pressures  at  depth  should  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  actual  surface  pressures,  gas
properties, and temperature. The constant ggio was used in the following installation design to
simplify the calculations.

2. Calculate the gas lift valve unloading temperature-at-depth gradient, gTvu, with Eq. 12.36
on the basis of the assigned unloading flowing-wellhead temperature, Twhu, and the static bot-
tomhole  temperature,  Twsd,  in  the  well.  The  assigned  unloading  flowing-wellhead  temperature
should be between the ambient surface temperature and the flowing-well fluids temperature at
the design maximum daily production rate from the well.

3.  Calculate  the  surface  flowing-production  transfer  pressure,  Ppt,  on  the  basis  of  the  as-
signed  flowing-production  transfer-pressure  valve-spacing  factor  at  the  surface,  fpt.  The  as-
signed fpt will generally range between 0.15 and 0.25 (15 to 25%).

P pt = Pwhf + f pt(Pio − Pwhf ) . .............................................. (12.50)
4.  Calculate  the  flowing-production  transfer  pressure  at  the  lower  end  of  the  production
conduit,  Pptd,  and  the  flowing-production  transfer  pressure  at  depth  gradient,  gpt.  The  recom-
mended minimum pressure difference, ΔPptd, between the flowing-production transfer pressure
at the lower end of the production conduit, Pptd, and the operating injection-gas pressure at the
same  depth,  Piod,  should  be  at  least  100  to  200  psi  or  greater  and  can  be  based  on  operating
experience in the area.

5. Determine from the appropriate set of gradient curves, or calculate using a reliable multi-
phase-flow computer program, the flowing-production pressure at the lower end of the produc-
tion conduit, Ppfd at Dd, on the basis of the maximum operating total GLR, Rglt (operating daily
injection-gas  plus  formation-produced  gas  rates),  and  the  installation  design  total  daily  liquid
rate (oil + water), qlt.

The  Ppfd  calculation  (or  determination  from  gradient  curves)  determines  if  the  tubing  size
restricts the maximum design daily production rate and whether a higher injection-gas pressure
is recommended. If Ppfd is less than Pptd, the tubing size does not appear to restrict the design
production rate, and the available injection-gas-line pressure appears to be adequate. The final

IV-580

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

maximum  daily  production  rate  will  be  controlled  by  the  productivity  of  the  well.  If  Ppfd  is
greater than Pptd, a higher operating injection-gas pressure is necessary to achieve the assigned
maximum depth of lift for this design method.

6.  Determine  the  depth  of  the  top  gas  lift  valve,  Dv1.  The  top  unloading  valve  depth  is
calculated using Eqs. 12.29, 12.30, or 12.31 on the basis of the terms defined for the equation
or can be located graphically.

7. Calculate the flowing-production transfer pressure, PptD(n), the operating injection-gas pres-

sure, PioD(n), and the unloading valve temperature, TvuD(n), at the gas lift valve depth, Dv(n).

P ptD(n) = P pt + gpt Dv(n)

. ................................................ (12.55)

8. Calculate the flowing bottomhole pressure, Pwfd(n), while lifting from the gas lift valve at
depth, Dv(n), based on the flowing-production transfer pressure, PptD(n), and the static load (kill)
fluid pressure gradient, gls, to determine whether the calculated daily liquid rate, qlc(n), based on
Productivity Index, PI, exceeds the assigned unloading daily liquid rate, qlu(n).

Pwfd(n) = P ptD(n) + gl s Dd − Dv(n)

. ......................................... (12.56)

If Pwfd(n) < Pwsd, calculate qlc(n).

ql c(n) = PI Pwsd − Pwfd(n)

. ................................................ (12.57)

The  static  load  (kill)-fluid  pressure  at  depth  gradient  is  recommended  for  calculating  the
valve  depths  after  flowing-bottomhole-pressure  drawdown.  The  time  required  to  recover  all
load (kill) fluid that entered the reservoir during workover is unknown. It may require days, or
weeks,  before  normal  formation-fluids  production  returns.  When  reservoir  fluids  begin  to  re-
enter  the  wellbore,  the  flowing-pressure-at-depth  gradient  below  an  operating  unloading  valve
will normally decrease and formation free-gas production will reduce the injection-gas require-
ment.

9.  Calculate  the  daily  injection-gas  rates,  qgi(n),  on  the  basis  of  the  assigned  unloading  or
calculated daily producing liquid rate in Step 8 if qlc(n) > qlu(n). Assume injection-gas/liquid ra-
tios,  Rgli(n),  that  result  in  flowing-production  pressures,  PpfD(n),  at  the  valve  depth,  Dv(n),  that
bracket the flowing-production transfer pressure, PptD(n). Values of PpfD(n) for varying Rdlt can be
calculated or determined from gradient curves. Then calculate the qgi(n) for the PptD(n) after the
assumed Rdlt equals the calculated Rdlt.

10.  Calculate  the  increase  in  the  injection-gas  pressure,  ΔPioc(n),  above  injection-gas  initial
valve opening pressure, PoD(n), for the valve to pass the required daily injection-gas rate, qgi(n),
to  establish  the  PptD(n)  in  Step  9  on  the  basis  of  the  valve  port  ID,  bellows-assembly  spring
rate,  Bsr  =  Blr  (Ab)  in  Appendix  A,  the  PoD(n)  and  the  PptD(n).  The  injection-gas  rate  through  a
gas lift valve for an assumed PioD(n) greater than PoD(n) is calculated with the equations in Ap-
pendix  A.  Similar to  Step  9,  the  increase in  the  injection-gas pressure,  PioD(n),  above  PoD(n)  to
attain the qgi(n) in Step 7 can be determined graphically or calculated using a curve-fitting rou-
tine.  The  calculated  increase  in  the  injection-gas  pressure,  ΔPioc(n),  is  equal  to  the  difference
between the PioD(n) that results in the required qgi(n) and the PoD(n) of the valve.

11. Compare the assigned minimum surface injection-gas pressure decrease between valves,
ΔPioa,  (represents  the  assigned  minimum  surface  design  injection-gas  pressure  increase  above
PoD(n)  for  stroking  a  valve)  to  the  calculated  injection-gas  pressure  increase  in  Step  10.  If  the
calculated surface injection-gas pressure increase in Step 10, ΔPioc(n), is less than ΔPioa, use this
assigned injection-gas pressure decrease, ΔPioa (ΔPio(n) = ΔPioa). Then calculate the sum of the

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

ΔPio(n) values, ΣΔPio(n), required for calculation of the injection-gas initial gas lift valve opening
pressure  at  depth  of  the  next  lower  valve, PoD(n).  The  ΣΔPio(n)  equals  zero  for  the  top  gas  lift
valve in Eq. 12.58.

12.  Calculate  the  depth  of  the  next  lower  valve,  Dv(n+1),  below  the  operating  unloading
valve with a load (kill)-fluid gls traverse (no formation production fluids) below the valve. The
top and the second valve depths, Dv1 and Dv2, respectively, are based on the assigned surface
operating injection-gas pressure, Pio. The following equation is used for calculating the depths
of the second and lower valves until the assigned maximum valve depth or minimum distance
between valves is reached.

Orifice-Check Valve Calculations.  The deepest (bottom) operating valve of choice in many
continuous-flow  installations  is  an  orifice-check  valve.  Because  an  orifice-check  valve  is  al-
ways fully open, there are no dynamic valve performance calculations required. The published
orifice or choke equations or charts are used to select the proper orifice or gas lift valve seat
ID and determine the injection-gas rate throughput. Orifice-check valve calculations for the bot-
tom  valve  are  outlined  in  detail  in  the  following  high-rate  continuous-flow  installation  design

An  orifice-check  valve  with  a   ∕16

5 -in.-ID  port  is  installed  in  the  bottom  wireline-retrievable
gas lift valve mandrel at 5,900 ft. An orifice-check valve is fully open at all times. The three-
parameter graphical solution in Fig. 12.38 includes two curves that are a function of PpfD5.

The daily liquid production rates curve is based on the well PI, Pwfd, and Pwsd (Pwfd = PpfD5
+ 34 psi for the approximate increase in pressure between 5,900 and 6,000 ft). An increase in
the  qgi  (higher  Rglt)  decreases  the  PpfD5  and  increases  the  calculated  qlc  for  the  given  PI  and
Pwsd. For a constant assigned qgia, different values of ql are assumed and the Rglt and correspond-
ing PpfD5 are calculated (or PpfD5 is determined from gradient curves) for each ql. The assumed
ql is compared to the calculated qlc based on the PI and Pwsd. This procedure is repeated until
the calculated qlc is equal to the assumed ql for the total assigned qgia. Refer to Table 12.8.

In the above calculations, a PpfD5 is calculated for each assumed qgia that is less than and a
qgia equal to the assigned maximum of 2,000 Mscf/D. The injection-gas requirements curve is a
plot of the assumed qgia vs. the calculated PpfD5.

The maximum assigned qgia of 2,000 Mscf/D intersects the injection-gas requirements curve
at PpfD5 = 1,190 psig. The calculated PioD5 is 1,393 psig at 5,900 ft (upstream pressure) for the
maximum assigned qgia of 2,000 Mscf/D through a  ∕16
5 -in.-ID orifice with a PpfD5 of 1,190 psig
downstream pressure and an upstream TgD5 of 169°F. The Pio5 at the surface is 1,180 psig for a
PioD5 of 1,393 psig at 5,900 ft. The upstream surface injection-gas pressure for 2,000 Mscf/D
should not exceed a surface injection-gas pressure that would reopen any of the upper unload-
ing valves. The calculated minimum Pio to reopen the deepest unloading valve is 1,310 psig at
the surface (injection-gas available line pressure, Pio – ΣΔPio = 1,400 – 90) and is 1,523 psig
at 5,900 ft. Because the calculated upstream choke pressure of 1,393 psig is considerably less
than  1,523  psig,  there  will  be  no  unloading  valve  interference  when  the  orifice-check  valve
becomes  the  operating  valve,  and  the  change  in  surface  injection-gas  pressure  will  be  readily
apparent after the depth of gas injection has transferred to the orifice-check valve.

A summary of the installation design calculations is shown in Table 12.9. The significant

12.10.10 Casing-Annulus-Flow Installation Design.  The  design  calculations  for  an  annular-
flow  installation  are  similar  to  those  for  a  continuous-flow  installation  through  the  tubing.
Intermittent gas lift is not recommended for annular flow. Because the gross liquid production
is  generally  thousands  of  barrels  per  day,  selecting  valve  port  ID  sizes  for  adequate  gas  pas-
sage is very important for annular-flow installations. Actual gas lift valve performance, based
on port ID, maximum linear stem travel, and bellows-assembly load rate, is an important factor

in the design calculations for annular-flow installations because of the high injection-gas require-
ments.  The  increase  in  the  injection-gas  pressure  to  overcome  the  bellows-assembly  load  rate
and to attain the needed equivalent port area for a required injection-gas throughput should be
considered.

Selection of the proper size of gas-injection tubing string that will deliver the required daily
injection-gas requirement for unloading and operating is absolutely essential. An initial assump-
tion  can  be  an  injection-gas  tubing  size  that  will  deliver  the  maximum  daily  injection-gas
requirement with no pressure loss (i.e., the increase in the injection-gas pressure with depth, as
a result of gas-column density, is offset by the flowing frictional pressure loss). This should be
the smallest nominal tubing size considered for the injection-gas string. Charts for static injection-
gas pressure at depth cannot be used for the valve spacing calculations.

The Cullender and Smith18 correlation is recommended for calculating the pressure loss in
the injection-gas tubing string. This method for calculating the flowing injection-gas pressure at
depth  was  derived  for  a  producing  gas  well  and  not  for  gas  injection.  The  only  difference  in
the calculations is the friction term for gas being injected rather than being produced. The sign
for  the  friction  term  changes  (i.e.,  the  friction  term  becomes  negative  in  the  Cullender  and
Smith equation for gas injection).

Wireline-retrievable  gas  lift  valve  mandrels  that  accommodate  standard  injection-pressure-
operated valves for annular flow are available (Fig. 12.39). When these mandrels are used, the
valves are run and set in the pocket in exactly the same manner as for tubular flow. However,
the mandrel configuration is such that the injection gas enters the side of the pocket from in-
side the tubing. This allows injection gas to pass through the valve and exit the pocket into the
casing annulus rather than into the tubing. Annular-flow mandrels should be used for annular
flow wherever possible because they allow full gas passage through the valve without the re-
striction imposed by cross-over seats. Also, gas is injected from the bottom rather than the side
of  the  mandrel.  This  provides  a  much  safer  installation  from  an  erosion  standpoint  than  the
installation using valves with crossover seats in which gas is injected from the side of the pock-
et into the wall of the casing.

Where mandrels for tubing flow are already installed and are not feasible to replace, valves
with crossover seats must be installed. In such installations, the check disk in the reverse-flow
checks valve seats in the opposite direction for casing flow as compared to a tubing flow instal-
lation and allows gas passage from the injection-gas tubing to the casing annulus. In the wireline-
retrievable valve tubing flow series mandrel, the valve for casing flow is similar to a production-
pressure-operated valve, except the integral check valve is reversed for injection-gas flow from
tubing to casing.

Because  nitrogen-charged  bellows  gas  lift  valves  have  a  lower  bellows-assembly  load  rate
than a spring-loaded valve, bellows-charged valves are recommended for high injection-gas vol-
umetric  throughput,  as  required  for  most  annular-flow  installations.  Fortunately,  the  valve

temperature  at  depth  is  not  difficult  to  predict  accurately  in  high-volume  wells.  The  flowing
surface temperature is near the bottomhole flowing temperature; therefore, the operating temper-
ature  of  all  valves  in  a  high-volume,  annular-flow  gas  lift  installation  is  approximately  the
same.  An  important  caution  is  to  never  use  the  surface  injection-gas  temperature  to  estimate
the valve temperature at depth. The injection gas will begin to approach the flowing-fluid tem-
perature  within  a  few  hundred  feet  of  the  surface.  The  flowing  wellhead  temperature  of  the
fluid  production  should  be  used  to  establish  the  unloading  valve  temperatures  at  depth.  This
same consideration is applicable to the Cullender and Smith injection-gas pressure-at-depth cal-
culations.

12.11 Intermittent-Flow Gas Lift

12.11.1 Introduction.  Intermittent-flow gas lift is applicable to low-productivity wells and to
low-  and  high-productivity  wells  with  low  reservoir  pressure.  Chamber  installations  may  be
beneficial to gas lift the low-flowing-bottomhole-pressure wells, particularly those wells with a
high productivity index.

As  the  name  implies,  the  reservoir  fluid  is  produced  intermittently  by  displacing  liquid
slugs with high-pressure injection gas, as illustrated in Fig. 12.40. Either an electronic or clock-
driven time-cycle controller, or an adjustable or fixed choke, controls the flow of injection gas.
Not all gas lift valves operate on choke control. The number of intermittent-flow gas lift instal-
lations on time-cycle control far exceeds the number of choke-controlled installations.

12.11.2 Disadvantages of Intermittent-Flow Gas Lift.  Intermittent-flow  gas  lift  has  several
disadvantages  compared  to  continuous-flow  operations.  If  the  desired  production  can  be  gas
lifted by continuous flow, this method is preferable. It is difficult to handle the high instanta-
neous  gas  volumes  properly  in  the  low-  and  high-pressure  sides  of  a  closed  rotative  gas  lift
system. Choke control of the injection gas into a well eliminates the removal of injection-gas
volume at high instantaneous rates from the high-pressure system. However, it does not solve
the problem of the large gas volume beneath the slug that enters the low-pressure system fol-
lowing  displacement  of  the  liquid  slug  to  the  surface.  Gas  volume  storage  requires  pressure
difference  and  physical  capacity.  The  difference  between  the  compressor  discharge  pressure
and  the  operating  injection-gas  casing  pressures  normally  exceeds  the  difference  between  the
separator and compressor suction pressures. For this reason, retaining the needed injection-gas

IV-594

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

volume in the low-pressure side of a small, closed rotative gas lift system can be difficult un-
less  the  injection-gas  cycles  are  staggered  properly.  Staggering  of  the  injection-gas  cycles  is
less precise on choke control than with a time-cycle controller. The electronic timers have im-
proved the accuracy of controlled gas injection, whereby the injection cycles can be scheduled
to prevent more than one well receiving injection gas at the same time. Therefore, total injec-
tion plus formation gas can be scheduled to enter the low-pressure system at a more constant
rate with accurate time cycle than with choke control of the injection gas.

Severe  surging  in  the  flowing  bottomhole  pressure  can  present  a  serious  production  prob-
lem  in  unconsolidated-sand  wells  where  sand  production  cannot  be  controlled.  Sand  bridging
can plug off production and result in sand cleanout costs. Pressure surges in a chamber installa-
tion may be far more severe than in a regular intermittent-flow installation. A wireline release
type of lock with an equalizing valve is recommended for the standing valve in a chamber to
prevent the standing valve from being blown out of its seating nipple following blowdown af-
ter an injection-gas cycle. Some companies have resorted to increasing the operating injection-
gas pressures to lift near total depth by continuous flow rather than intermittent flow wells that
produce sand.

The total energy in the formation and injection gas is not fully used with intermittent-flow
gas lift. The high-pressure gas under the slug is spent in the flowline and does not contribute
to  the  lift  process.  This  is  one  reason  for  using  continuous-flow  operations  for  a  high-GLR
well if possible. Plunger lift may be the best method for lifting certain high-GLR wells.

The injection-gas requirements are usually higher for intermittent-flow than for continuous-
flow gas lift operations. The tubing capacity beneath the slug must be filled with injection gas
to displace the liquid slug to the surface. The tubing under the liquid slug cannot be one-half
or two-thirds filled with high-pressure gas. For this reason, the gas requirements for intermit-
tent  lift  of  low-GLR  wells  that  do  not  partially  flow  can  be  estimated  with  reasonable
accuracy. Unfortunately, articles have been published that imply that a well, or group of wells,
is being intermittent lifted with a certain type of gas lift valve that results in an injection-gas
requirement  of  only  a  fraction  of  the  gas  volume  needed  to  fill  the  tubing  beneath  the  liquid
slug.  Although  gas  orifice  meter  charts  are  published  to  illustrate  these  claims,  the  truth  is,
these wells are partially flowing. Only minimal agitation and displacement of the liquid slug is
required to lift these wells. Most of the energy needed to lift the well is being furnished by the
formation  and  not  the  gas  lift  system.  Intermittent-flow  gas  lift  is  much  more  labor  intensive
than  continuous  flow.  In  intermittent-flow  gas  lift,  the  operator  should  frequently  adjust  the
injection time and cycle frequency to maintain an efficient operation.

The injection-gas requirements for intermittent-flow and continuous-flow gas lift should be
compared  before  eliminating  continuous-flow  operations.  With  the  advent  of  several  reliable
multiphase-flow  correlations,  the  predictable  range  of  continuous  flow  has  been  extended  to
much  lower  daily  production  rates.  A  careful  investigation  of  the  proper  production  conduit
size for lifting a well by continuous flow may permit this type of gas lift in place of intermittent-
flow gas lift.

12.11.3 Types of Intermittent-Flow Gas Lift Installations.  Intermittent-flow  gas  lift  should
be  used  only  for  tubing  flow.  Most  installations  have  a  packer  and  may  include  a  standing
valve  in  the  tubing.  If  a  well  produces  sand,  a  standing  valve  is  recommended  only  if  it  is
essential. A seating nipple should be installed at the lower end of the tubing string in intermittent-
flow installations where a standing valve may be needed.

The working fluid level in a well should result in a minimum starting slug length that pro-
vides a production pressure at the depth of the operating gas lift valve equal to 50 to 60% of
the  operating  injection-gas  pressure  at  the  same  depth.  If  this  is  not  possible,  a  chamber  or
plunger installation should be considered. In a chamber installation, the calculated depths of the
unloading gas lift valves are the same as for a regular intermittent-lift installation. The chamber

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

IV-595

design converts a few feet of fluid, standing above the formation, into many feet of fluid in the
tubing  above  the  chamber.  This  entire  liquid  column  is  transferred  into  the  tubing  above  the
standing  valve  before  injection  gas  enters  the  production  conduit.  The  standing  valve  is  re-
quired  for  efficient chamber operation to  ensure  U-tubing  all fluid  from  the  chamber into  the
tubing rather than allowing fluid to be pushed into the formation.

If a chamber installation is not installed in a low-bottomhole-pressure well, a plunger down-
hole  stop  and  bumper  spring  can  be  set  by  wireline  immediately  above  the  operating  gas  lift
valve. The plunger reduces the injection-gas slippage through the small liquid slug and decreas-
es the liquid fallback. Smaller starting liquid slugs can be gas lifted more efficiently with the
plunger acting as a sealing interface between the liquid slug and injection gas.

12.11.4 Prediction of Daily Production Rates.  Two basic factors control the maximum produc-
tion  from  a  high-rate  intermittent-flow  gas  lift  installation:  (1)  the  total  liquid  production
reaching  the  surface  per  cycle  and  (2)  the  maximum  number  of  injection-gas  cycles  per  day.
An  intermittent  gas  lift  installation  should  be  designed  to  maximize  the  liquid  recovery  per
cycle on low- and high-capacity wells. All restrictions in and near the wellhead should be elim-
inated.  For  this  reason,  streamlined  wellheads  are  recommended.  If  the  wellhead  cannot  be
streamlined,  all  unnecessary  ells  and  tees  should  be  removed  to  reduce  the  number  of  bends
between the tubing and flowline. If the velocity of the liquid slug is reduced before the entire
column of  liquid can  be  displaced into  the  horizontal flowline, additional injection-gas break-
through, or gas slippage, will occur and decrease the liquid recovery per cycle. Performance of
the operating gas lift valve, or valves, is important for efficient liquid-slug displacement. The
operating gas lift valve should have a large port that opens quickly to ensure ample injection-
gas volumetric throughput for efficiently displacing the liquid slug. Even though a large port is
used,  the  valve  spread  (the  difference  between  initial  valve  opening  and  closing  pressure)
should  be  kept  relatively  low  to  prevent  excessive  gas  usage.  This  is  especially  true  where
large volumes of gas are stored in wells with small tubing and large casing.

The  gas  lift  valve  should  not  open  slowly  and  meter  a  small  injection-gas  rate  into  the
production conduit, which tends to aerate and percolate through the liquid slug rather than dis-
place the slug. Rapid increase in the injection-gas casing pressure, after a time-cycle controller
opens, improves the gas lift valve performance and ensures a more efficient displacement of a
liquid  slug  in  a  time-cycle-operated  intermittent-lift  installation.  Ample  injection-gas  volume
must be available at the wellsite from the high-pressure injection-gas system. If the line pres-
sure  in  the  high-pressure  system  decreases  to  the  casing  pressure  immediately  after  the  time-
cycle  controller  opens,  poor  valve  action  is  the  fault  of  the  high-pressure  system  and  not  the
gas lift installation in the well.

The size and length of the flowline can significantly affect the maximum cycle frequency.
A  flowline should  always  be  at  least equal to,  or  one  size  larger than,  the  tubing.  The  maxi-
mum  number  of  injection-gas  cycles  per  day  is  controlled  by  the  time  required  for  the
wellhead pressure to return to the separator or production-header pressure after a slug surfaces.
Reducing the separator pressure increases the starting slug length for the same flowing bottom-
hole  pressure  but  does  not  solve  the  problem  of  decrease  in  wellhead  pressure  after  the  slug
surfaces. When comparing or predicting the maximum production from two relatively high-ca-
pacity wells on intermittent gas lift, the size and length of the flowlines must be considered. If
one  installation  requires  45  minutes  and  another  10  minutes  for  the  wellhead  pressure  to  ap-
proach the production-header pressure after a slug surfaces, the difference in maximum produc-
tion  (assuming  that  both  wells  have  the  same  deliverability)  is  not  the  result  of  the  gas  lift
installation in the well but of the surface facilities.

One definition of liquid fallback is the difference between the starting-liquid-slug volume,
or length, and the produced slug volume, or length. The purpose of a properly designed inter-
mittent  gas  lift  installation  is  to  recover  a  large  portion  of  the  starting  slug.  An  important

IV-596

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

parameter that can be observed is the average slug velocity. The operating gas lift valve normal-
ly opens in less than 30 seconds after the time-cycle controller opens in most intermittent-lift
installations.  An  approximate  slug  velocity  can  be  estimated  by  assuming  the  valve  opens  15
seconds  after  the  controller  opens  and  recording  the  time  elapsed  from  this  instance  until  the
slug surfaces. In most installations, the depth of the operating gas lift valve is known or can be
estimated from an acoustical fluid-level survey. If the average liquid-slug velocity is not near
or exceeding 1,000 ft/min, the liquid fallback may be excessive. A slug velocity less than 800
ft/min can result in excessive fallback.

The maximum number of injection-gas cycles per day can be estimated for many wells by
assuming 2 to 3 min/1,000 ft of lift for typical wells. The actual time can be less for installa-
tions on a production platform without flowlines and much longer for intermittent installations
with small-ID and/or long flowlines, such as a well with 2⅞-in.-OD tubing and a 2-in. flowline
that  is  2  miles  in  length.  Also,  emulsions  and  other  unique  well  problems  can  decrease  the
maximum number of injection cycles per day and the recoverable liquid production per cycle.

12.11.5 Injection-Gas  Requirement  for  Intermittent  Lift.    Multiphase-flow  correlations  are
not  applicable  for  the  prediction  of  the  gas  requirement  to  lift  a  well  by  intermittent  gas  lift.
Intermittent  lift  is  the  displacement  of  a  liquid  slug  by  high-pressure  gas.  The  injection-gas
requirement is not based on reducing the density of the fluid column. It is based instead upon
the volume of gas needed to fill the tubing between the bottom of the slug when it reaches the
surface and the depth of the deepest gas lift valve that opens during an injection-gas cycle. The
injection-gas pressure and volume following the liquid slug at the instant this slug surfaces are
spent in the flowline.

In intermittent lift, the energy in the formation gas does little to assist in lifting most wells.
One method for calculating the injection-gas requirement is to assume the produced slug to be
a  continuous  liquid  column  without  any  after-flow  production  in  the  tail  gas.  The  theoretical
pressure  under  this  liquid  slug  at  the  instant  the  slug  surfaced  is  approximately  the  wellhead
production pressure plus the length of the produced slug multiplied by the liquid gradient. The
actual  average  pressure  in  the  tubing  under  a  liquid  slug  is  more  than  this  pressure  based  on
the solid slug length and a dry-gas gradient. This results from the injection-gas penetration of
the  slug  during  the  lift  process  and  the  frictional  losses  that  occur.  An  average  injection-gas
pressure in the tubing equal to the theoretical pressure under the produced liquid slug plus the
surface closing pressure of the operating gas lift valve divided by two is a realistic assumption
on the basis of numerous bottomhole-pressure measurements in intermittent-flow gas lift instal-
lations.

The total volume of injection gas per cycle depends on the average pressure in the tubing
under the slug and the physical capacity of the tubing. When the depth of lift is several thou-
sand  feet,  compared  to  an  equivalent  produced  slug  length  of  only  a  few  hundred  feet,  the
length of the slug may be subtracted from the tubing length above the operating valve for cal-
culating  the  capacity  of  tubing  filled  with  injection  gas  each  cycle.  This  assumption  implies
that  the  rate  of  decrease  in  the  pressure  of  the  expanding  injection-gas  volume  beneath  the
liquid slug is less than the rate of decrease in the pressure exerted by the slug length remaining
in the tubing as the upper portion of the slug enters the flowline.

12.11.6 Comparison of Time-Cycle to Choke Control of the Injection Gas.  The advantage of
choke-controlled  injection-gas  volume  for  an  intermittent-flow  gas  lift  installation  is  the  fact
that a low volumetric injection-gas rate is required from the high-pressure system into the well.
Several conditions must be met before choke control of the injection gas can be used success-
fully.  The  gas  lift  valve  must  be  suited  for  choke-control  operation,  and  the  casing  annulus
must  provide  adequate  storage  capacity  for  the  injection-gas  volume  needed  to  displace  the
slug. Clean, dry gas is extremely important in choke control, and low-capacity wells are more

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

choke control of the injection gas.

difficult to choke control because of the small surface injection-gas choke size required for the
low daily injection-gas rate needed to lift the well. A pressure-reducing regulator to maintain a
constant maximum valve opening casing pressure between valve operating cycles may be nec-
essary to permit the use of a larger-sized choke in the injection-gas line. Other limitations of
choke control of the injection gas include a reduction in the maximum liquid slug size that can
be lifted each cycle and the maximum number of injection-gas cycles per day. Time-cycle con-
trol of the injection gas should be considered for high-rate intermittent-lift operations. Two-pen
pressure  recorder  charts,  shown  in  Fig.  12.41,  illustrate  time-cycle  and  choke-control  opera-
tions.  Fig.  12.41a  is  time-cycle  control  where:  (1)  time-cycle  controller  opens,  (2)  time-cycle
controller closes, and (3) gas lift valve closes. Fig. 12.41b is choke control of the injection gas
where  (1)  gas  lift  valve  opens  and  (2)  gas  lift  valve  closes.  The  difference  in  the  maximum
recorder tubing pressure for the time-cycle and choke-controlled installations results from differ-
ent bourdon-tube ranges in the two pressure recorders. The pressure range for tubing pressure
for time-cycle control is 0 to 1,000 psig, and it is 0 to 500 psig for the choke-control chart.

Most intermittent-flow gas lift installations use time-cycle-operated controllers on the injec-
tion-gas line because of the many advantages of time-cycle over choke control of the injection
gas.  Rugged  unbalanced,  single-element,  nitrogen-charged  bellows  gas  lift  valves  with  large
ports can be used. Much larger liquid slugs can be lifted with time-cycle control because injec-
tion  gas  in  the  annulus  can  be  supplemented  with  gas  from  the  high-pressure  injection-gas
system during each injection-gas cycle.

12.11.7 Intermittent-Flow Gas Lift Installation Design Methods.  There are many published
methods  and  variations  in  these  methods  for  designing  intermittent-flow  gas  lift  installations.
These methods can be divided into one type of design that is based on a production rate and
another design that can be described as a percentage-load technique. Intermittent pressure gradi-
ent spacing factors are used for installation designs based on an assumed daily production rate.
Production  rate  is  not  a  consideration  for  a  percent-load  design  method.  The  procedures  for
calculating a percent-load installation vary between gas lift manufacturers and between opera-
tors  who  have  introduced  slight  variations  in  these  calculations.  The  gas  lift  valve  depths  in
most designs can be calculated or determined graphically. Regardless of the method used, the
design should ensure unloading and operation from the deepest gas lift valve.

12.11.8 Gas Lift Valves for Intermittent Lift.  Most operating valves used for intermittent lift
are  the  unbalanced,  single-element,  bellows-charged  valve  with  a  large  port.  The  majority  of
intermittent-lift designs require an operating gas lift valve with a large production-pressure fac-
tor.  Single-element,  spring-loaded  gas  lift  valves  are  not  recommended  for  intermittent  lift
because  of  the  higher  bellows-assembly  load  rate  from  the  additional  load  rate  of  the  spring.
The operating gas lift valve should tend to “snap” open and provide a large port size for injection-
gas  throughput  so  that  the  liquid  slug  can  be  displaced  efficiently  with  minimal  injection-gas
slippage and liquid fallback. Time-cycle control of the injection gas is recommended for inter-
mittent-lift  installations  using  unbalanced,  single-element  gas  lift  valves.  These  valves  may  or
may not operate on choke control of the injection gas.

There are gas lift valves that have been designed for choke-controlled intermittent gas lift
operation. These valves have a large port for gas passage and may be designed to operate on
either time-cycle or choke control of the injection gas. Several types of gas lift valves are de-
signed for only choke-control operation. A properly selected pilot-operated gas lift valve as the
operating valve, functions in most wells on time cycle or choke control. It is extremely impor-
tant  to  select  the  proper  pilot  port  size  based  on  the  relationship  between  the  capacity  of  the
casing annulus and tubing if choke control of the injection gas is required. Choke control may
be mandatory because of limited gas storage capacity in the high-pressure surface facilities.

12.11.9 Intermittent  Pressure-Gradient  Spacing  Factor.    The  intermittent  pressure-gradient
spacing  factor  is  similar  to  a  flowing-pressure  gradient  above  the  point  of  gas  injection  in  a
continuous-flow installation. This factor increases with daily production rate for a given size of
tubing. These intermittent spacing factors account for the following conditions: (1) liquid fall-
back from injection-gas penetration of the displaced liquid slug while the slug is in the tubing,
(2) fluid transfer from the casing annulus to the tubing during unloading operations, (3) fluid
production after flowing-bottomhole-pressure drawdown occurs, and (4) increase in tubing pres-
sure with depth in deep wells with a high surface wellhead tubing pressure.

The fluid level in the tubing immediately after an injection-gas cycle is not at the operating
valve  depth.  There  is  always  an  accumulation  of  liquid  fallback  because  of  gas  slippage
through  the  liquid  slug  during  displacement.  Consequently,  the  minimum  flowing-production
pressure  between  injection-gas  cycles  is  greater  than  a  gas  pressure  at  operating  valve  depth
based on the surface wellhead tubing pressure.

The  intermittent  pressure-gradient  spacing  factors,  Fs,  given  in  Fig.  12.42,  were  published
many years before flowing-pressure-gradient curves were available for continuous-flow installa-
tion designs. The same unloading pressure gradients were used for intermittent-lift and continu-
ous-flow  installation  design.  These  data  were  compiled  from  a  limited  number  of  flowing-
pressure  surveys  from  low  GLR,  high-water-cut  wells  with  2⅜-in.-  and  2⅞-in.-OD  tubing.
Other tubing sizes were added to Fig. 12.42 at a later date. One of several important parame-
ters missing from this correlation is depth. The only two correlating parameters in Fig. 12.42
are the production rate and conduit size. The rate of injection-gas penetration velocity into the

slug is reported to be relatively constant for a given fluid. Therefore, the liquid fallback increas-
es  with  the  depth  of  lift  because  the  liquid  slug  requires  more  time  to  reach  the  surface  in
deeper wells. These published intermittent spacing factors may be too low for deep intermittent
lift and too high for shallow lift.

12.11.10 Selection of Surface Closing Pressure of Gas Lift Valves.  The surface closing pres-
sure of an operating gas lift valve is the minimum surface injection-gas pressure between gas
injections  if  there  are  no  leaks  in  the  producing  string,  which  includes  wellhead,  tubing,  and
gas lift valves. The maximum surface injection-gas pressure occurs at the instant the time-cycle
controller  closes  in  time-cycle  control,  or  when  the  operating  gas  lift  valve  opens  on  choke
control. The available operating injection-gas-line pressure at the wellsite must exceed the max-
imum  surface  casing  pressure  during  an  injection-gas  cycle.  For  this  reason,  an  assumed  gas
lift valve surface closing pressure of 15% less than the available injection-gas-line pressure at
the wellsite is recommended for line pressures between 700 and 1,000 psig. This is the same
as  assuming  a  surface  closing  pressure  equal  to  85%  of  the  available  injection-gas-line  pres-
sure.  A  minimum  100-psi  difference  between  the  injection-gas  line  and  the  gas  lift  valve
surface closing pressure is suggested for lower injection-gas pressures and a maximum of 200
psi  for  higher  pressures.  The  maximum  surface  casing  pressure  during  an  injection-gas  cycle
for intermittent-lift operations is usually 8 to 10% higher than the surface closing pressure of
the operating gas lift valve. This assumption can be used for approximate injection-gas require-
ment  calculations  in  typical  tubing/casing  combinations  such  as  2⅜-in.-OD  tubing  in  5½-in.-
OD casing and 2⅞-in.-OD tubing in 7-in.-OD casing.

When a time-cycle controller on the injection-gas line opens, pressure upstream of the con-
troller  decreases.  To  have  an  injection-gas  volume  stored  in  the  high-pressure  injection-gas
lines, there must be a pressure difference in addition to the capacity of the high-pressure sys-
tem.  If  the  difference  between  the  injection-gas-line  pressure  and  the  surface  closing  pressure

IV-600

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

of  the  operating  gas  lift  valve  is  insufficient,  the  casing  pressure  will  not  increase  at  a  rate
necessary  to  ensure  rapid  opening  of  an  unbalanced,  single-element,  gas  lift  valve  after  the
controller opens. A near instant increase in casing pressure after the controller opens improves
the gas throughput performance of a single-element valve and decreases the liquid fallback. To
ensure fast opening of the operating gas lift valve, it is better to design an intermittent installa-
tion with a pressure difference between the injection-gas line and valve closing pressure that is
slightly excessive rather than insufficient.

12.11.11 Selection  of  Valve  Port  Size.    Many  gas  lift  designers  disagree  on  port  sizing  for
intermittent-flow unloading valves. One school of thought maintains that because most intermit-
tent-flow  installations  are  a  natural  progression  from  continuous  flow,  the  same  mandrel
spacing  for  continuous  flow  can  be  used  for  intermittent  flow.  In  such  instances,  small  ports
can be used in the unloading valves and a large-ported valve placed on bottom for the operat-
ing  valve.  This  would  also  hold  true  for  the  spacing  factor  method  of  locating  the  unloading
valves. On the other hand, another school of thought maintains that the constant surface clos-
ing and percent-load intermittent gas lift installation designs require unbalanced, single-element,
gas  lift  valves  with  large  ports  relative  to  the  effective  bellows  area.  The  design  principle  is
based on the production-pressure effect. This is the tubing-production pressure from the liquid
column above the valve at depth immediately before valve opening multiplied by the production-
pressure factor for the valve. The valve with the highest tubing-production pressure that is less
than the injection-gas pressure at valve depth is the deepest operating gas lift valve in the instal-
lation. There is no reason to decrease the surface closing pressure for each successively lower
unloading gas lift valve for valves with high-production-pressure factors. The point of gas injec-
tion transfers automatically from an upper to the next lower valve after the production pressure
at the lower-valve depth becomes less than the injection-gas pressure at the same depth. This
same  design  technique  can  be  used  for  pilot-operated  gas  lift  valves  used  on  bottom  for  the
operating valve. The calculations for pilot valves apply to the pilot section of the valve.

When the design technique employing large ported valves for unloading is used, there may
be  variations  in  the  port  size  or  surface  closing  pressure  of  the  bottom  gas  lift  valve.  If  the
casing size is large relative to the tubing size, such as with 2⅜-in.-OD tubing in 7-in.-OD cas-
ing, a smaller-ported gas lift valve may be used for the bottom valve. The l.5-in.-OD unloading
gas lift valves may have a  ∕16
7 - or ½-in.-ID port and the bottom valve a ⅜-in.-ID port to reduce
the  valve  spread  (i.e.,  the  difference  between  the  initial  opening  and  closing  pressures  of  the
operating  valve).  This  consideration  is  important  for  installations  in  wells  with  an  anticipated
low flowing bottomhole pressure. The design surface closing pressure can be the same as the
assumed closing pressure for the unloading gas lift valves with larger ports. Another variation
in  the  installation  design  is  to  decrease  the  surface  closing  pressure  of  the  bottom  gas  lift
valve. The purpose of decreasing the closing pressure of the bottom valve is to provide a visi-
ble  change  in  operating  injection-gas  pressure  when  the  well  is  unloaded  to  this  valve  depth.
This procedure is referred to as “flagging” the bottom valve, and a typical decrease in surface
closing pressure is 20 to 30 psi.

12.11.12 Intermittent Gas Lift Installation Design Based on Valves With a Large Port, Con-
stant Surface Closing Pressure, and an Intermittent-Spacing-Factor Pressure Gradient With
Depth.  There are two advantages to a properly designed constant-surface-closing-pressure in-
stallation  design:  (1)  no  decrease  in  operating  injection-gas  pressure  with  depth  of  lift  is
required (particularly important in deep wells with low available injection-gas pressure) and (2)
the depth of lift is always the deepest valve depth where the maximum production pressure in
the tubing is less than the injection-gas pressure at the same depth.

Because intermittent-flow gas lift is normally used only when lifting from near total depth
of a well, it is important to know which valve is the operating valve at any given time. One

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

IV-601

disadvantage  of  the  constant-surface-closing-pressure  design  method  is  the  difficulty  of  estab-
lishing  the  depth  of  the  operating  valve  from  the  surface  operating  injection-gas  pressure
because the operating pressure does not decrease with each successively lower valve. Determin-
ing  the  fluid  level  acoustically  or  recording  the  time  for  a  liquid  slug  to  surface  are  two
methods for establishing the approximate depth of lift. A liquid-slug velocity of approximately
1,000 ft/min can be assumed for most installations. Decreasing the surface closing pressure of
the bottom valve is another method used by some operators to indicate that a well has unload-
ed to and is operating from the deepest valve. A decrease in the surface-closing pressure of the
operating gas lift valve should be considered if a plunger is being installed in an intermittent-
lift  installation.  Intermittent  installations  with  a  low  PI  should  operate  from  the  maximum
possible depth of lift. This design technique uses an intermittent-spacing-factor pressure gradi-
ent  based  on  the  tubing  size  and  design  gas  lift  production  rate  from  the  well.  This  pressure
gradient is used for locating all unloading valves in the well.

12.11.13 Determination of the Gas Lift Valve Depths.   The  bottomhole  pressures,  Pwsd  and
Pwfd, and bottomhole temperature, Twsd, are generally referenced to the same datum depth, Dd,
which is usually the lower end of the production conduit. The steps for establishing the gas lift
valve depths on a pressure/depth plot are the same as used in a continuous-flow design, except
that the intermittent spacing factor represents the unloading flowing-pressure gradient above the
depth of gas injection. The steps for establishing the gas lift valve depths are discussed next.

1.  Determine  the  intermittent  spacing  factor,  Fs,  for  the  design  daily  production  rate  and
tubing  size  from  Fig.  12.42.  Using  the  intermittent  spacing  factor  as  the  unloading  pressure
gradient above the depth of gas injection, gpfa, calculate the unloading flowing-production pres-
sure at the lower end of the production conduit, Ppfd.

2.  Plot  the  minimum  wellhead  pressure  between  gas  injections,  Pwh,  and  the  Ppfd  on  the
pressure/depth  graph  in  Fig.  12.43  and  connect  these  two  pressures  with  a  straight  line.  This
represents the minimum unloading flowing-tubing-pressure-at-depth (PpfD)min traverse above the
depth of gas injection.

3. Add a temperature scale to the pressure/depth graph and plot the surface unloading-well-
head  temperature,  Twhu,  and  the  bottomhole  temperature,  Twsd,  at  Dd.  Draw  the  unloading  gas
lift valve temperature at depth (TvuD) traverse by assuming a straight-line traverse between Twhu
and  Twsd.  Calculate  the  unloading  gas  lift  valve  temperature  at  depth  gradient,  gTvu,  using  Eq.
12.36.

4. Calculate a surface closing pressure for the gas lift valves, Pvc, with Eq. 12.66, and calcu-
late the valve closing pressure, Pvcd, at Dd, with Eq. 12.1. Draw a straight line between Pvc at
the surface and, Pvcd, at Dd, which represents the valve closing pressure at depth, PvcD-traverse,
and calculate the valve closing gas pressure at depth gradient, ggvc, with Eq. 12.67.

Pvc = 0.85 Pio . .......................................................... (12.66)

ggvc =

5. Calculate the depth of the top gas lift valve, Dv1, on the basis of the available injection-
gas-line  pressure,  Pio,  load-fluid  pressure  gradient,  gls,  and  the  wellhead  U-tubing  pressure,
Pwhu, with either Eq. 12.29, 12.30, or 12.31.

6. Draw a horizontal line on the pressure/depth plot at depth Dv1 between the (PpfD)min and
TvuD  traverses,  which  includes  PvcD1,  and  record  (PpfD1)min,  PvcD1,  and  TvD1,  or  calculate  these
pressures and temperature using the appropriate gradients and depth Dv1.

verse,  gls,  below  the  depth  of  the  top  gas  lift  valve  with  the  traverse  originating  at  the
minimum  unloading  flowing  tubing  pressure,  (PpfD1)min,  and  extend  this  traverse  to  the  valve
closing pressure at depth (PvcD) traverse The spacing between valves may be solved mathemati-
cally.

8. Repeat Step 6 at depth Dv2.
9.  Locate  the  depth  of  the  third  gas  lift  valve,  Dv3,  graphically  or  mathematically,  and
record the pressures and valve temperature at Dv3 as outlined in Steps 7 and 8. Repeat Steps 7
and  8  until  the  maximum  desired  gas  lift  valve  depth  is  attained  or  the  calculated  distance

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

between valves is less than the assigned minimum distance between valves. The minimum dis-
tance is used for calculating the remaining valve depths until the maximum valve depth is reached.

12.11.14 Calculation of the Test-Rack Set Opening Pressures of the Gas Lift Valves.  A tabu-
lation form for these calculations is illustrated in Table 12.10. The bellows-charged pressure at
the valve unloading temperature, PbvD, is calculated.

PbvD(n) = PvcD(n) . ........................................................ (12.70)

For Eq. 12.70 to be valid, the flowing-production pressure at valve depth is assumed equal
to the injection-gas pressure at the same depth when the valve closes. This assumption is rea-
sonable for the deeper gas lift valves with large ports. The pressure in the tubing approaches
the  injection-gas  pressure  at  valve  depth  immediately  before  the  valve  closes.  Eq.  12.70  does
not accurately describe the closing pressure for the upper one or two valves as the point of gas
injection transfers to the next lower valve. The pressure downstream of the valve port can be
significantly  less  than  the  injection-gas  pressure  at  the  instant  the  upper  one  or  two  valves
close. These upper valves will have a higher closing pressure.

The  unloading  valve  temperature  at  the  depth  of  the  valve  can  be  estimated  from  a  TvuD
traverse on the pressure/depth plot or calculated with Eq. 12.39. The test-rack opening pressure
is calculated with Eq. 12.45 for a tester setting temperature of 60°F using CT(n) from Table 1 or
calculated with Eq. 3.

The design given in Example Problem 6 is based on valves with a constant surface closing
pressure and uses large-ported unloading valves. The design uses a single intermittent spacing-
factor  gradient  for  the  spacing  calculations.  Unloading  valves  are  spaced  from  the  surface
because of the possibility that the fluid level may be high after a workover. As discussed earli-
er, this is only one of many design techniques. Many designers prefer to use small-port valves
for an unloading design similar to continuous flow.

Repeat  Steps  7  and  8  until  the  maximum  desired  gas  lift  valve  depth  is  attained  or  the
calculated distance between gas lift valves is less than an assigned minimum distance between
valves.  If  the  desired  maximum valve depth  had  not  been  reached, assume  the  minimum dis-
tance  between  valves  until  the  maximum  valve  depth  is  reached.  The  minimum  distance
between valves of 350 ft was not used in the design of this installation because the maximum

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

calculated  valve  depth  of  5,928  ft  was  reached  before  the  calculated  distance  between  valves
was less than 350 ft.

12.11.15 Calculation of the Test-Rack Set Opening Pressures of the Gas Lift Valves.  A tabu-
lation form for these calculations is given in Table 12.10. The bellows-charged pressure at the
valve unloading temperature, PbvD at TvuD, is calculated with Eq. 12.60. The temperature correc-
tion factor, CT, is calculated with Eq. 12.3 rather than read from Table 12.1.

1. For the first valve at Dv1 using Eq. 12.70: PbvD1 = PvcD1 = 707 psig at 103°F.
2. Calculated CT(1) = 0.914 with Eq. 12.3.
3. With Eq. 12.45, calculate the test-rack opening pressure, Pvo1, of the valve at Dv1:

Pvo1 =

0.914(707)

0.745

= 868 psig .

Repeat Steps 1 to 3 for the remaining valves. An additional pressure drop of 20 psi in PvcD
may be taken at the last (bottom) valve to flag it and ensure that the upper valves do not reopen.
The calculated test-rack opening pressure of Valve 6 in Table 12.10 is based on a ½-in. ID
port.  A  valve  with  the  same  surface  closing  pressure  and  a  ⅜-in  ID  port  can  be  run  as  the
bottom valve to reduce the spread for a lower than predicted flowing bottomhole pressure. The
test-rack opening pressure for a valve with a ⅜-in. ID port (1 – Ap /Ab = 0.857) would be 754
psig.

12.11.16 Gas  Lift  Chambers.19,20    Chamber  lift  is  a  form  of  intermittent-flow  gas  lift.  The
chamber installation design determines the success of this type of gas lift operation. There are
three primary reasons for selecting a chamber lift to gas lift a well:

1. To  lower  the  depth  of  gas  injection  in  a  low-flowing-bottomhole-pressure  well  with  a

long perforated interval or open hole.

2. To  fully  use  an  available  injection-gas  pressure  that  significantly  exceeds  the  flowing

bottomhole pressure in terms of the pressure resulting from the starting slug length.

3. To attain the lowest possible average flowing bottomhole pressure by reducing the fluid-

head backpressure against the formation for a given liquid feed-in volume.

Although there are numerous variations in the physical design of a chamber, the two funda-
mental types are the two-packer and the insert bottle type for collecting the well fluids. Both
types are shown in Fig. 12.44. The two-packer chamber utilizes the casing annulus for accumu-
lation of the well fluids. The insert type of chamber is usually fabricated from the largest pipe
that can be safely run inside of the casing or open hole. Chamber location and size relative to
the working fluid level, the injection- and formation-gas venting, the injection-gas rate through
the  chamber-operating  gas  lift  valve  for  lifting  the  slug,  and  properly  using  the  chamber-lift
principle can be the difference between efficient and inefficient chamber-lift operations.

Chamber-Lift Principle.  The  chamber-lift  principle  implies  that  the  injection  gas  initially
contacts the top of the liquid column in the chamber and displaces this liquid into the tubing
above the chamber before injection gas enters the lower end of the dip tube. The dip tube is
assumed to be filled with liquid at the beginning of an injection-gas cycle; that is, the top of
the chamber is located at the working fluid level. The accumulated liquid in the chamber annu-
lus is U-tubed into the tubing above the chamber before injection gas entry into the lower end
of the dip tube. Chamber-lift operation prevents water accumulation in the production conduit
because the water is U-tubed first from the chamber, followed by the oil, and then by the injec-
tion gas.

IV-606

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 12.44—Two basic types of gas lift chambers.

Design Considerations and Chamber Length.  The chamber length should be calculated on
the basis of an injection-gas pressure that is 60 to 75% of the initial opening pressure of the
chamber-operating gas lift valve to ensure adequate pressure differential across the liquid col-
umn  at  the  instant  the  injection  gas  enters  the  lower  end  of  the  dip  tube.  Actual  operations
have shown higher chamber-lift efficiency when the chamber length is based on an injection-
gas pressure that is at least 60 to75% of the opening pressure of the chamber-operating gas lift
valve. An adequate pressure differential across the liquid slug is necessary to ensure maximum
liquid recovery with a minimum of injection-gas breakthrough during displacement to the surface.

The actual chamber length is the distance from the top of the chamber to the lower end of
the  dip  tube.  The  chamber-length  equation  is  based  on  three  assumptions:  (1)  the  top  of  the
chamber is located at the working fluid level between injection-gas cycles, (2) the dip tube is
full when the chamber-operating gas lift valve opens, and (3) the physical size of the chamber
and dip tube do not change over the entire chamber length. The chamber-length equation must
be modified for other geometries and assumptions.

Example Problem  7:  Two-Packer  Chamber-Length  Calculations.  The  following

data are given for a two-packer chamber at 6,000 ft (top packer):

• Casing size = 7-in. OD, 26 lbm/ft.
• Tubing and dip tube size = 2⅞-in. OD.

Unloading Valve Depths.  The unloading valve spacing calculations for a chamber installa-
tion  are  the  same  as  the  valve  depth  calculations  for  an  intermittent  installation  with  the
exception of the bottom unloading valve. The bottom unloading gas lift valve should be within
a few joints of the chamber-operating valve because the depth of gas-injection for the chamber-
operating valve is the lower end of the dip tube rather than the actual valve depth, and the fluid-
slug length above the valve is based on the chamber annular capacity plus the dip-tube length.
The  initial  opening  pressure  of  a  chamber-operating  gas  lift  valve  should  be  at  least  50  psi
lower  than  the  initial  opening  pressure  of  the  bottom  unloading  valve  in  most  installations  to
ensure  lifting  from  the  chamber-operating  valve.  The  tubing  pressure  at  the  top  of  a  properly

IV-608

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

designed chamber that is located at the working fluid level will be near wellhead tubing pres-
sure. The operating-chamber valve must have proper spread characteristics (difference between
the operating valve initial opening and closing pressures in the well) to prevent excessive injec-
tion-gas usage per cycle. Pilot-operated gas lift valves are widely used as the chamber-operat-
ing valve because a large port is available with controlled spread characteristics.

There can be a significant pressure differential across the standing valve immediately after
the  liquid  slug  surfaces  and  blowdown  occurs.  A  mechanical-locking-type  standing  valve  is
recommended  to  prevent  the  standing  valve  from  being  blown  out  of  its  seating  nipple  from
this pressure differential.

Importance of Chamber-Bleed Valve.  An important consideration is the design and opera-
tion of the chamber-bleed valve for venting free gas in the upper section of the chamber after
an injection-gas cycle. Most of the free gas is injection gas trapped above the increasing fluid
level in the chamber during fill-up. A liquid seal at the lower end of the dip tube occurs soon
after a liquid slug surfaces and the injection-gas velocity in the tubing begins to decrease. The
liquid seal results from liquid fallback accumulating in the lower end of the dip tube and cham-
ber. Injection-gas from the previous chamber U-tubing cycle is trapped in the chamber annulus
above the lower end of the dip tube. The trapped injection gas from the previous injection-gas
cycle must be vented from the chamber annulus before the chamber can fill with liquid. If the
injection gas is not vented, the trapped injection gas will reduce the liquid production entering
the  chamber.  Without  venting  the  trapped  injection  gas,  a  portion  of  the  production  entering
the chamber increases the length of the liquid column in the tubing. If a significant volume of
the reservoir-liquid production fills the tubing above the chamber, the major benefit of an accu-
mulation chamber is nullified in terms of lowering the liquid-column backpressure against the
formation.  Differential  valves  have  been  used  as  chamber-bleed  valves.  The  differential  valve
must be properly set with choke sizes that ensure closure immediately after the chamber-operat-
ing gas lift valve opens.

Description of Chamber-Lift Injection-Gas Cycle.  A complete injection-gas cycle of opera-
tion for chamber lift is described for stabilized operation after unloading. Stabilized production
infers  that  the  well  has  unloaded  the  kill  fluid,  all  production  is  from  the  reservoir,  and  the
production per injection-gas cycle remains approximately the same.

When the chamber-operating valve opens, the standing valve closes. The liquid column in
the  chamber  annulus  is  U-tubed  into  the  dip  tube  and  tubing  above  the  chamber  to  form  the
starting-liquid-slug  length.  A  portion  of  the  starting  liquid  slug  is  displaced  to  the  surface  by
the injection gas. Not all of a starting liquid slug reaches the surface because of injection-gas
breakthrough and resulting liquid fallback during displacement.

While the standing valve is closed and the liquid slug is surfacing, the reservoir fluid feed-
in continues to enter the wellbore. Formation production enters the casing annulus between the
chamber OD and casing ID of an insert chamber or below the bottom packer of a two-packer
chamber installation. Reservoir production cannot enter the chamber while the standing valve is
closed. All free gas, including the formation and trapped injection gas, is vented into the tub-
ing  through  the  chamber  bleed  valve  in  a  properly  designed  two-packer  installation.  The
formation-gas  production  in  the  annular  area  between  the  insert  chamber  OD  and  casing  ID
beneath the packer should be vented into the tubing above the chamber to prevent a significant
decrease in the maximum daily production from a high-PI, low-flowing-bottomhole-pressure well.
Free-Gas Problems With Insert Chambers.21  Gas  separation  occurs  beneath  the  packer  in
the annulus between the insert chamber OD and casing ID. The formation free gas accumulates
above  the  liquid  level  in  this  annulus.  This  trapped  formation  free  gas  is  compressed  by  the
new production entering the wellbore. The additional formation free-gas production is added to
the  trapped  free  gas  beneath  the  packer  as  the  formation  free  gas  separates  from  the  liquid

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

IV-609

production. This trapped free gas under the packer restricts the total volume of produced-liquid
accumulation in the casing-ID/insert-chamber-OD annulus below the packer.

After a liquid slug surfaces, the injection gas in the tubing exhausts into the flowline, and
the flowing bottomhole pressure in the chamber decreases. The standing valve opens when the
pressure in the chamber is less than the reservoir pressure beneath the standing valve. The liq-
uid  in  the  casing/chamber  annulus  below  the  gas/liquid  level  flows  into  the  chamber  first.
Liquid is followed by the trapped formation free gas from the casing/chamber annulus until the
annulus and chamber pressures are equal at the depth of the standing valve. The casing/cham-
ber  annulus  between  the  packer  and  standing  valve  depth  is  totally  filled  with  formation  free
gas and no liquid at the equalized minimum flowing bottomhole pressure between injection-gas
cycles.

The injection-gas cycle frequency depends on the well deliverability. When maximum cycle
frequency is required, the next injection-gas cycle begins as soon as the tubing wellhead pres-
sure approaches the production-header (separator) pressure. Time-cycle control of the injection-
gas  cycle  is  required  to  ensure  maximum  cycle  frequency.  A  very  short  time  after  beginning
the surface injection-gas cycle, the chamber-operating valve opens and the standing valve clos-
es.  Because  of  the  high  injection-gas  cycle  frequency,  most  of  the  well  production  enters  the
wellbore while the standing valve is closed and the liquid slug is surfacing. As a result, nearly
all of the liquid entering the chamber is the liquid accumulation in the casing/chamber annulus
before  the  standing  valve  opens.  Very  little  production  enters  the  chamber  directly  from  the
reservoir because the standing valve is open for a much shorter length of time than it is closed
at maximum injection-gas cycle frequency. The solution to this problem is to vent the free gas
in the casing/chamber annulus beneath the packer into the tubing above the chamber. The sepa-
rated formation gas would not be trapped in this annular space. The casing opposite the insert
chamber  annulus  could  fill  with  liquid  if  the  free  gas  was  vented  into  the  tubing  above  the
chamber. When the standing valve opens after a slug surfaces and the pressure in the chamber
decreases, mostly liquid rather than free gas enters the chamber when free gas is vented from
below the packer.

If a well is producing less than 10 to 20 B/D and is requiring less than 6 or 12 injection-
gas cycles per 24 hours, the free gas in the casing annulus is not a serious a problem. Most of
the  reservoir-fluid  production  enters  the  wellbore  while  the  standing  valve  is  open  during  the
long time interval between injection-gas cycles. The free-gas volume above the liquid level in
the  chamber  annulus  has  sufficient  time  to  flow  into  the  dip  tube  through  a  small  orifice  or
bleed valve. One reason that inefficient insert chamber operations in a high-injection-gas-cycle
frequency,  gassy  well  is  not  addressed  in  the  literature  is  the  fact  that  most  low-cost  insert-
chamber  installations  use  a  hookwall  packer  and  hanger  nipple,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  12.44a.
This is the type of insert chamber that is run in low-rate, “stripper-type” wells.

There may be little benefit from an insert-chamber installation in a gassy well with a high-
frequency injection-gas cycle if the design does not provide a means to vent the trapped free
gas below the packer as shown in Fig. 12.45. Improved chamber-lift operations can be expect-
ed by installing a gravity-closed or spring-loaded gas lift valve check below the packer. A tubing-
retrievable  conventional  gas  lift  mandrel  and  check  valve  is  run  upside  down  between  the
packer and top of the insert chamber in Fig. 12.46. Wireline- instead of tubing-retrievable equip-
ment can be used. Adding a screen to the check-valve inlet is recommended to prevent trash in
the well fluids from entering and preventing the check dart from closing. The check valve adds
very little cost to this type of chamber installation. Because liquid, rather than trapped forma-
tion gas, is in contact with the formation in the casing annulus, better reservoir-liquid feed-in
between injection-gas cycles should occur. Only the trapped formation free and injection gas in
the chamber must vent through the chamber-bleed valve.

12.11.17 Plunger Application for Intermittent Gas Lift.  An  important  consideration  related
to  intermittent  gas  lift  operations  is  the  injection-gas  breakthrough  and  resulting  loss  of  the
liquid  production  per  cycle  from  the  injection  gas  penetrating  the  liquid  slug  during  the  time
required to displace this slug to the surface. The produced-liquid slug can be a small fraction
of the starting slug size because of injection-gas breakthrough. The losses are greater when the
injection-gas pressure is low and the required depth of lift is near total depth in a deep well.
For example, a 12,000-ft well with a bottomhole flowing pressure of 300 psig and an available

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

IV-611

Fig. 12.47—Plunger in an intermittent gas lift installation.

injection-gas pressure of only 450 psig can be gas lifted intermittently with the proper plunger.
The well could not be gas lifted successfully from this depth without a plunger.

A  typical  plunger  installation  for  intermittent  gas  lift  operation  is  shown  in  Fig.  12.47.  A
plunger  can  be  expected  to  decrease  the  injection-gas  requirement  for  an  intermittent  gas  lift
installation from 30 to 70% depending on plunger construction, the depth of lift, injection-gas
pressure, and adjustment of the injection-gas volume to the well before the plunger is installed.
There is little if any liquid-slug recovery by intermittent gas lift from very deep wells with
low injection-gas pressure unless a plunger is installed. The plunger provides a solid interface
between the starting liquid slug and the displacing injection gas. The plunger practically elimi-
nates  liquid  fallback  as  a  result  of  gas  penetrating  the  liquid  slug.  The  increase  in  liquid
recovery and the decrease in the injection-gas requirement per cycle from installing a plunger
are  minimal  in  an  intermittent  gas  lift  installation  with  small  liquid  slugs  being  lifted  at  an
exceedingly high slug velocity in shallow wells. Another advantage of a plunger is that it re-
duces paraffin in a well with a paraffin problem. Plungers are installed in some wells for the
sole purpose of keeping the tubing free of paraffin deposition.

A plunger can be installed in an existing tubing-retrievable conventional gas lift valve instal-
lation  by  wireline  without  pulling  the  tubing  if  there  are  no  tight  spots  in  the  tubing.  A

IV-612

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

standing  valve  and  a  bottomhole  collar  lock  or  a  stop  with  a  bumper  spring  can  be  installed
with wireline tools. A standing valve normally is recommended but not required in wells with
a low permeability. The bottomhole bumper spring is located immediately above the operating
gas lift valve, and a standing valve is stationed below the valve. The remaining equipment is
on  the  surface  and  includes  a  lubricator  with  a  bumper  spring  and  a  plunger  catcher  mecha-
nism. A plunger-arrival detector to shut in the tubing is not needed for an intermittent gas lift
installation because the tubing is not shut in between injection-gas cycles.

A plunger ascent velocity of 800 to 1,000 ft/min is recommended for the most efficient lift.
A plunger may stall or tend to stop and start at plunger velocities less than 350 to 400 ft/min.
Plunger velocities in excess of 1,200 to 1,500 ft/min are not recommended because of possible
damage to the plunger on arrival at the surface and an apparent tendency to bypass a thicker
than normal liquid boundary on the tubing wall. Noting the times when a time-cycle controller
opens and when the plunger arrives at the surface can approximate an average plunger velocity.
The addition of a plunger to an intermittent gas lift installation should be considered when
(1)  the  available  injection-gas  pressure  is  low  relative  to  the  required  depth  of  lift  in  a  low-
flowing-bottomhole-pressure  well;  (2)  there  is  an  excessive  increase  in  wellhead  tubing  pres-
sure  as  the  liquid  slug  enters  the  flowline  because  of  such  factors  as  a  small-ID  flowline,
excessive number of bends at the wellhead, and flowline choke; and (3) a paraffin-deposition
problem exists. A plunger should increase the efficiency required of most intermittent gas lift
installations.  Because  a  plunger  adds  several  moving  parts,  it  can  also  increase  the  operating
problems.

Well conditions that prohibit the use of a plunger are a bore opening through surface well-
head and tree valves that differs from the tubing ID; excessive well deviation, which prevents a
plunger from descending to its bottomhole bumper spring; tight spots in the tubing; appreciable
sand  production;  and  high-rate  intermittent  gas  lift  operations.  The  fall  time  required  for  a
plunger to descend to the bottom bumper spring could reduce the maximum production from a
high-cycle-frequency intermittent gas lift installation.

Specially  designed  plungers  are  available  for  wells  with  side-pocket  mandrels.  Plungers
have  worked  in  wells  with  a  deviation  near  50°,  but  the  maximum  deviation  for  a  plunger
operation depends on the construction of the plunger. The manufacturers should be able to pro-
vide the information related to their plunger operation in a deviated well.

There are numerous types of plunger sealing elements, bypass valves, plunger weights and
lengths,  and  other  features  that  may  have  been  developed  for  unique  applications.  Some
plungers  are  particularly  applicable  for  gas  lift  and  other  types  are  not.  Select  the  proper
plunger to match the well conditions and application for trouble-free service and efficient oper-
ation. Please refer to the chapter on Plunger Lift in this volume of the Handbook.

12.12 Operation of Gas Lift Installations
A  recommended  practice  for  operation,  maintenance,  and  troubleshooting  gas  lift  installations
is given in API RP 11V5.22

12.12.1 Unloading Procedures and Proper Adjustment of Injection-Gas Rate.  The  impor-
tance  of  properly  unloading  a  gas  lift  installation  cannot  be  overemphasized  in  terms  of
possible damage to gas lift valves and for attaining the optimum depth of lift. If a permanent
meter tube is not installed in the injection-gas line to the well, provisions should be made for
the  installation  of  a  portable  meter  tube  before  unloading  and  adjustment  of  the  injection-gas
rate to the well. Preferably, the meter tube and the orifice meter or flow computer should be
located near the well’s injection-gas control device so that the effect of changes in the adjust-
ment of the injection-gas volume can be observed.

A  two-pen  pressure  recorder  should  be  installed  before  unloading  all  gas  lift  installations.
The ranges of the pressure elements in the recorder should be checked before hookup. A typi-

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

IV-613

cal recorder will have a 0- to 500- or 0- to 1,000-psig range element for the flowing wellhead
production pressure and a 0- to 1,000- or 0- to 2,000-psig range element for the injection-gas
pressure, depending on the kick-off and available operating injection-gas pressure at the well-
site.  These  pressure  elements  should  be  calibrated  periodically  with  a  dead  eight  tester  to
ensure accurate recordings.

Recommended Practices Before Unloading.  If  the  injection-gas  line  is  new,  it  should  be
blown clean of scale, welding slag, and the like, before being connected to a well. This precau-
tion prevents damage and plugging of the surface control equipment and entry of debris with
the injection gas into the casing annulus. Debris may cause serious operational problems to gas
lift valves.

The surface facilities for a gas lift installation should be checked before the well is unload-
ed.  This  includes  all  valves  between  the  wellhead  and  the  battery,  the  separator  gas  capacity,
and the stock-tank room. It is important to check the pop-off safety release valve for the gas
gathering facilities if this is the first gas lift installation in the system.

Recommended Procedure for Unloading Gas Lift Installations.  Preventing excessive pres-
sure  differentials  across  the  gas  lift  valves  during  initial  U-tubing  operations  minimizes  the
chance for equipment failure because of fluid and sand cutting. The following procedure avoids
excessive pressure differential across the valves during the unloading operation. The permissi-
ble  rate  of  increase  in  the  injection-gas  pressure  downstream  of  the  control  device  can  be
greater for an open installation without a packer than for an installation with a packer. Most of
the load fluid from the casing annulus will be U-tubed through the lower end of the tubing in
an open installation; whereas all the load fluid in the annulus must pass through the small ports
of the gas lift valves in an installation with a packer. The initial U-tubing is the most critical
operation during the unloading procedure. There is no reason to hurry the U-tubing of the load
fluid to uncover the top gas lift valve. Because the tubing remains full of load fluid during the
U-tubing operation, there is no drawdown in flowing bottomhole pressure. Gas lifting does not
begin until the initial U-tubing is completed and injection gas enters the tubing through the top
valve.  The  load-fluid  production  rate  is  controlled  by  the  rate  of  increase  in  the  injection-gas
pressure,  which  in  turn,  depends  on  the  injection-gas  rate.  Because  most  gas  lift  installations
include a packer, the load fluid enters the tubing through the gas lift valves. If the load fluid
contains sand and debris and full line injection-gas pressure is applied to the casing by opening
a large valve on the injection-gas line, the gas lift valves may leak after the well is unloaded.
An instantaneous pressure differential that is approximately equal to the full line injection-gas
pressure occurs across every gas lift valve because the casing and tubing are full of load fluid.
If sand or debris is in the load fluid, the resulting high fluid velocity through the small valve
ports  might  fluid  cut  the  seats.  The  following  procedure  is  recommended  for  monitoring  and
controlling  the  unloading  operations  for  all  gas  lift  installations  to  prevent  damage  to  the  gas
lift valves and surface facilities.

1. Install a two-pen pressure recorder that is accurate and in good working condition. The
injection-gas  pressure  downstream  of  the  gas-control  device  and  the  wellhead  tubing  pressure
should always be recorded during the entire unloading operation.

2. If the well has been shut in and the tubing pressure exceeds the separator pressure, bleed
down  the  tubing  through  a  small  flowline  choke.  Do  not  inject  lift  gas  before  or  while  the
tubing is being bled down.

3. Remove  all  wellhead  and  flowline  restrictions  including  a  fixed  or  adjustable  choke  if
the well does not flow after all load fluid has been produced. If the gas lift installation is in a
∕64
32 -in. flowline choke is recommended
new well, or a recompletion that could flow, a 
until  the  well  has  cleaned  up  and  does  not  flow  naturally.  The  selected  range  of  the  element
for  the  flowing-wellhead-pressure  pen  in  the  two-pen  recorder  should  be  able  to  handle  the
maximum flowing wellhead pressure with a choke in the flowline.

4. Inject lift gas into the casing at a rate that does not allow more than a 50-psi increase in
casing pressure per 10-minute interval. Continue until the casing pressure has reached at least
300 psig. Most companies use a standard choke size in the injection-gas line for U-tubing and
initial unloading operations. A typical injection-gas choke size ranges from  ∕64
 in. for the
6
U-tubing operation.

5. After the casing pressure has reached 300 to 500 psig, the injection-gas rate can be ad-
justed to allow a 100-psi increase per 10-minute interval until gas begins to circulate through
the top gas lift valve (top valve is uncovered). After the top gas lift valve is uncovered and gas
has been injected through this valve, a high pressure differential cannot occur across the lower
gas lift valves. Any time the casing injection-gas pressure is increased above the opening pres-
sure  of  the  top  valve,  the  valve  will  open  and  prevent  a  further  increase  in  the  injection-gas
pressure. Gas lifting begins with injection gas entering the top valve.

6. If the gas lift installation does not unload to the bottom valve or the design operating gas
lift  valve  depth,  adjustment  of  the  injection-gas  rate  to  the  well  is  required.  An  excessive  or
inadequate  injection-gas  rate  can  prevent  unloading.  This  is  particularly  true  for  intermittent
gas lift on time-cycle control where the maximum number of injection-gas cycles per day de-
creases with depth of lift. It may be necessary to decrease the number of injection-gas cycles
per day and to increase the duration of gas injection as the point of gas injection transfers from
an upper to a lower valve. Proper adjustment of the injection-gas volume to a well is not per-
manent  for  most  installations.  The  injection-gas  requirements  change  with  well  conditions;
therefore,  continuous  monitoring  of  the  injection-gas  rate  and  the  wellhead  and  injection-gas
pressure is recommended to maintain efficient gas lift operations.

12.12.2 Depressing the Fluid Level (“Rocking” a Well).  If  the  top  gas  lift  valve  cannot  be
uncovered with the available injection-gas pressure, the fluid level can be depressed when there
is no standing valve in the tubing. The injection-gas pressure is applied simultaneously to the
tubing  and  casing.  Several  hours  may  be  required  to  depress  the  fluid  level  sufficiently  in  a
“tight”  low-permeability  well.  The  tubing  pressure  is  released  rapidly,  and  the  source  of  the
major  portion  of  the  fluid  entering  the  tubing  is  load  fluid  from  the  annulus.  This  procedure
may be required several times to lower the fluid level in the casing annulus below the depth of
the top gas lift valve.

High-production-pressure-factor valves in an intermittent gas lift installation or an installa-
tion with production-pressure-operated valves may cease to unload after the top valve has been
uncovered. Gas lift valves with a high degree of tubing-pressure sensitivity may require a mini-
mum  production  pressure  at  valve  depth  to  open  the  valve  with  the  available  injection-gas
pressure. This problem occurs more frequently with the top one or two gas lift valves and may
be referred to as a “stymie” condition. The stymie condition can be corrected by applying an
artificial increase in production pressure at valve depth by “rocking” the well. The valve can-
not  detect  the  difference  between  a  liquid  column  and  a  pressure  increase  from  partially
equalizing the tubing and casing pressure with injection gas. If a well should stymie, the prop-
er procedure for “rocking” the well follows.

First,  with  the  wing  valve  on  the  flowline  closed,  inject  lift  gas  into  the  tubing  until  the
casing and tubing pressures indicate that the gas lift valve has opened. A small copper tubing
or  flexible  high-pressure  line  can  be  used  for  this  purpose.  When  a  valve  opens,  the  casing
pressure begins to decrease and to equalize with the tubing pressure. The tubing pressure also
should begin to increase at a faster rate with injection gas entering the tubing through the valve
and surface connection.

Next,  stop  gas  injection  into  the  tubing  and  immediately  open  the  wing  valve  to  lift  the
liquid slug above the gas lift valve into the flowline as rapidly as possible. A flowline choke
may be required to prevent venting injection gas through the separator relief valve. Some sur-
face facilities are overloaded easily, and bleeding off the tubing must be controlled carefully.

Chapter 12—Gas Lift

IV-615

Last,  the  rocking  process  may  be  required  several  times  until  a  lower  gas  lift  valve  has
been uncovered. As the depth of lift increases, the possibility of stymie decreases because of a
higher minimum production pressure at the greater depth and the decrease in the distance be-
tween valves.

12.12.3 Controlling  the  Daily  Production  Rate  From  Continuous-Flow  Installations.    The
daily  production  rate  from  a  continuous-flow  gas  lift  installation  should  be  controlled  by  the
injection-gas  volumetric  flow  rate  to  the  well.  A  flowline  choke  should  not  be  used  for  this
purpose.  Excessive surface  flowline backpressure  increases  the  injection-gas requirement. Pro-
duction-pressure-operated  gas  lift  valves  and  injection-pressure-operated  valves  with  a  large
production-pressure  factor  are  particularly  sensitive  to  high  wellhead  flowing  pressure.  Ineffi-
cient multipoint gas injection can result and prevent unloading an installation to the maximum
depth of lift for the available operating injection-gas pressure when the flowing wellhead back-
pressure is excessive.

12.12.4 Adjustment of a Time-Cycle-Operated Controller for Intermittent-Flow Operations.
When  initially  unloading  an  intermittent-flow  gas  lift  installation,  an  excessive  injection-gas-
cycle  frequency  may  prevent  “working  down”  (unloading  the  gas  lift  installation  beyond  a
certain  depth).  As  the  depth  of  lift  increases,  the  maximum  possible  number  of  injection-gas
cycles  per  day  decreases  and  the  volume  of  injection  gas  required  per  cycle  increases.  If  the
number  of  injection  cycles  per  day  becomes  excessive  and  there  is  insufficient  time  between
gas injections for the casing pressure to decrease to the closing pressure of an upper unloading
gas lift valve, the unloading process will discontinue until the number of injection-gas cycles is
reduced. Many installations require several adjustments of the time-cycle controller before the
operating valve depth is reached.

The following procedure is recommended for final adjustment of a time-cycle-operated con-
troller to minimize the injection-gas requirement when lifting from the operating gas lift valve:
1. Adjust the controller for a duration of gas injection that ensures an excessive volume of
injection gas used per cycle (approximately 500 ft3/bbl/1,000 ft of lift). For most systems 30 sec/
1,000 ft of lift results in more gas being injected into the casing annulus than is actually needed.
2. Reduce  the  number  of  injection-gas  cycles  per  day  until  the  well  will  not  lift  from  the
final operating valve depth and/or the producing rate declines below the desired or maximum
daily production rate.

3. Reset  the  controller  for  the  number  of  injection-gas  cycles  per  day  immediately  before

the previous setting in Step 2. This establishes the proper injection-gas-cycle frequency.

4. Reduce  the  duration  of  gas  injection  per  cycle  until  the  producing  rate  decreases  and
then return to the previous setting and increase the duration of gas injection by 5 to 10 seconds
for fluctuations in injection-gas-line pressure.

A time-cycle-operated controller on the injection-gas line can be adjusted as previously out-
lined, provided the line pressure remains relatively constant. If the line pressure varies signifi-
cantly,  the  controller  is  adjusted  to  inject  ample  gas  volume  with  minimum  line  pressure.
When  the  line  pressure  is  above  the  minimum  pressure,  excessive  injection  gas  is  used  each
cycle. One solution to this problem is a controller that opens on time and closes on a set in-
crease in casing pressure. Several electronic timers are designed to operate in conjunction with
pressure control.

12.13 Gas Lift for Unusual Environments
Gas  lift  is  especially  suited  for  application  in  unusual  environments.  This  section  discusses  a
few of these environments and how gas lift is used in the particular application.

IV-616

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

12.13.1 Offshore Platforms.  Gas lift is a widely used artificial-lift system in offshore installa-
tions and has performed exceptionally well. Most downhole gas lift equipment has few if any
moving parts and requires little maintenance. What little maintenance that is required can nor-
mally be done with wireline equipment. For this reason, downhole gas lift equipment is much
less  costly  to  replace  than  other  forms  of  downhole  artificial-lift  equipment.  The  required
space,  or  “footprint,”  and  weight  of  gas  lift  surface  controls  are  minimal.  Because  produced
gas from the offshore wells generally must be conserved, it can be compressed and provide a
ready source of high-pressure gas for gas lift.

The process of gas lift from offshore platforms is slightly different from gas lift onshore. In
many  cases,  the  surface  installations  on  offshore  platforms  are  better  designed  than  onshore
installations. If designed properly, there will be very little pressure loss caused by restrictions
or flowlines. The compressors for gas lift are located nearby, so the distribution of gas should
be no problem. Because of the importance to the overall installation, gas compression and de-
hydration equipment is normally operated and maintained by people who are provided for this
specific purpose.

Safety Devices.  There are many more safety devices on offshore platforms than on onshore
installations. High-/low-pressure shutoff devices are installed at the wellhead on both the injec-
tion-gas line and the flowline to automatically close in the well at the surface, should there be
a radical change in either line’s operating pressure.

Surface  or  downhole  safety  devices  are  a  necessary  part  of  any  offshore  well.  With  so
much property and human life at stake on the platforms, it is an absolute necessity to prevent
downhole or surface catastrophic failure. Safety valves are included on the production string of
a gas lift well and may cause some restriction to flow. In the North Sea, governmental agen-
cies  also  require  a  safety  valve  on  the  gas-injection  side  of  gas  lift  wells.  The  reason  is  the
possibility  of  the  check  valve  on  the  gas  lift  valve  failing,  which  would  allow  well  fluids  to
flow into the casing. Restrictions from subsurface safety equipment may enter into the design
of a gas lift installation.

12.13.2 Gas Lift Installations Drilled From Offshore Platforms.  Wells drilled from offshore
platforms  have  varying  degrees  of  deviation  that  must  be  accounted  for  in  predicting  vertical
multiphase  flow.  Most  gas  lift  design  programs  can  take  this  varying  deviation  into  account.
Wireline operators report little problems in setting valves in mandrels at deviations up to 60°.
Motors have been developed to move tools downhole at high deviations and have been used in
some instances. The gas lift retrievable-valve mandrels with orientation sleeves are designed to
insure that the valve enters the pocket regardless of pocket orientation relative to the vertical.

12.13.3 Subsea Gas Lift Installations.  Subsea  installations  increased  dramatically  in  the  last
few years with the addition of producing areas in greater and greater water depths. Today, it is
not unusual to find production from water depths over 6,000 ft with gas lift being the preferred
production  method  in  most  of  these  completions.  With  extreme  water  depths,  some  form  of
artificial  lift  is  usually  required  just  to  kick  off  the  well  and  move  the  production  from  the
seafloor to the surface.

Devices and equipment for carrying gas lift equipment into subsea wells were perfected at
the onset of subsea technology. These include devices for carrying the valves and engines for
driving the valve downhole through flowlines and other systems.23 Although such tools are avail-
able, these operational techniques are not widely used. Most subsea gas lift today is done with
high-pressure gas and a single orifice placed as deep as the pressure will permit. By using this
approach, there is no gas lift equipment in the well that could fail or need replacing. In many
deepwater installations, where the water depth itself adds considerable head that must be over-
come to produce the well, gas injection is often through a single point at the wellhead or near
the mudline.24,25

12.13.4 Heavy-Oil Production.  Gas lift has been used to produce high-viscosity oil in many
parts of the world. Heavy oil is being produced by gas lift in Venezuela. Diluent injection has
been  found  to  be  very  beneficial  in  producing  all  types  of  artificial-lift  wells  in  eastern
Venezuela. Diesel fuel is usually used as the diluent, and the injection of approximately 10%
by volume lowers the specific gravity and increases the API gravity of the oil.26

Water  can  be  used  as  a  diluent  as  well  as  diesel  fuel  and  has  been  proven  effective  to
reduce  backpressure  in  large  pipelines.  In  most  cases,  water  acts  to  reduce  backpressure  by
adding a water ring around the viscous crude that reduces friction between the crude and the
pipe wall. When this occurs, water becomes the wetting phase and the resulting friction is sim-
ilar  to  that  of  water.  However,  unlike  the  diesel  fluid  which  increases  the  value  of  the
produced oil by lowering its viscosity, water adds another phase that must eventually be removed.

12.13.5 Gas  Lift  With  Air,  Nitrogen,  and  Carbon  Dioxide.    Typically,  gas  lift  designs  are
based on natural gas as the injection gas. However, gas lift with natural gas did not begin in a
big way until the 1920s. Early gas lift operations were conducted using air as the injection gas.
Many of the early great oil fields such as Spindletop and Goose Creek were produced with air
lift. Air has its disadvantages when used for gas lift because oxygen in the air causes serious
corrosion,  scale,  and  the  possibility  of  combustion  when  it  is  mixed  with  well  fluids.  Air  is
still used in gas lift installations today but on a very limited scale.

Nitrogen and carbon dioxide offer good alternatives to natural gas for gas lift. Nitrogen can
be  used  for  gas  lift  because  it  is  inert,  relatively  inexpensive,  and  noncorrosive.  Quite  often,
nitrogen  is  available  at  high  pressure  near  the  producing  facilities,  where  it  is  being  used  for
various enhanced-oil-recovery and pressure-maintenance projects.27

Carbon  dioxide  is  also  readily  available  from  miscible  displacement  projects  and  can  be
used for gas lift purposes. Natural gas containing 75% carbon dioxide was used for gas lift in
two large fields in Argentina without noticeable problems.28 In heavy-oil reservoirs, carbon diox-
ide is also very useful in decreasing the viscosity of the oil. Both nitrogen and carbon dioxide
can be purchased at a price competitive with natural gas in many locations. The use of small
nitrogen plants for gas lift of remote offshore and onshore locations has proved feasible under
certain conditions.

Electrical Submersible Pumps

13.1 Introduction

13.1.1 What Is an Electrical Submersible Pump?  The electrical submersible pump, typically
called an ESP, is an efficient and reliable artificial-lift method for lifting moderate to high vol-
umes  of  fluids  from  wellbores.  These  volumes  range  from  a  low  of  150  B/D  to  as  much  as
150,000 B/D (24 to 24,600 m3/d). Variable-speed controllers can extend this range significant-
ly,  both  on  the  high  and  low  side.  The  ESP’s  main  components  include:  a  multistaged
centrifugal  pump,  a  three-phase  induction  motor,  a  seal-chamber  section,  a  power  cable,  and
surface controls. The components are normally tubing hung from the wellhead with the pump
on top and the motor attached below. There are special applications in which this configuration
is inverted. This chapter provides a general understanding of the ESP artificial-lift method. The
topics  covered  include:  the  ESP  system  components  and  accessories,  principles  of  operation,
ESP system selection and performance calculations, installation and handling, and maintenance
and troubleshooting. In addition, references are given to lead the reader to more-detailed opera-
tion and performance information.

13.2 History1,2
In 1911, 18-year-old Armais Arutunoff organized the Russian Electrical Dynamo of Arutunoff
Co. in Ekaterinoslav, Russia, and invented the first electric motor that would operate in water.
During  World  War  I,  Arutunoff  combined  his  motor  with  a  drill.  It  had  limited  use  to  drill
horizontal holes between trenches so that explosives could be pushed through. In 1916, he re-
designed  a  centrifugal  pump  to  be  coupled  to  his  motor  for  dewatering  mines  and  ships.  In
1919,  he  immigrated to  Berlin and  changed the  name of  his  company to  REDA.  In  1923,  he
immigrated to the United States and began looking for backers for his equipment. Initially, he
approached  Westinghouse  but  was  turned  down  because  their  engineers  thought  it  would  not
work because it was impossible under the laws of electronics.

In 1926, at the American Petroleum Institute (API) conference in Los Angeles, two parties
joined  together  to  start  the  ESP  industry.  Just  before  this  conference,  Arutunoff  had  joined
forces with Samual VanWert, a sucker-rod salesman who saw the potential of the new device.
Together, they initiated a prototype test in a Baldwin Hills oil well. The second party involved
Clyde  Alexander,  a  vice  president  of  a  9-year-old  Bartlesville,  Oklahoma,  oil  company—

IV-626

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Phillips Oil Co. He was at the conference to look for ways of lifting oil from wells that also
required  producing  large  amounts  of  water.  Arutunoff  and  Phillips  signed  a  contract  to  field
test the concept in the El Dorado field near Burns, Kansas. After a successful test, Bart Mfg.
was organized. On 15 March 1930, Phillips sold his rights to Charley Brown, a Bart stockhold-
er and executive in Marland Oil Co., and Arutunoff. This was the birth of REDA Pump Co. In
1969, REDA merged with TRW Inc., and in 1987, it was sold to Camco Intl., which merged
with Schlumberger in 1998.

In 1957, a second company was established. This product line started at the Byron Jackson
Pump  facility  in  Vernon,  California.  Byron  Jackson  was  a  division  of  Borg  Warner  Corp.  In
1959,  the  oilfield  product  line  of  Byron  Jackson  Pump  was  moved  to  Tulsa  and  quickly  be-
came known as a “BJ” pump. In 1979, it became Centrilift Inc., a subsidiary of Borg Warner
Corp.,  and  was  moved  to  Claremore,  Oklahoma,  in  1980.  Just  after  the  relocation  in  1980,
Centrilift was sold to Hughes Tool Co. Then, in 1987, Hughes Tool and Baker Intl. merged to
become Baker Hughes Inc.

In 1962, Goulds Pump Oil Field Submergible Division approached Franklin Electric to find
a better motor for their oilfield-pump product. By 1967, they had designed a new product and
had formed a joint venture company, Oil Dynamics Inc. (ODI). In 1997, ODI was sold to Bak-
er Hughes Inc., and its product line was merged into Centrilift’s.

The story behind the third company becomes a little more convoluted. In 1965, Hydrody-
namics  was  formed  as  a  part  of  Peerless  Pump  to  develop  an  oilfield  submersible  product.
After limited financial success, it was sold to FMC Corp. and renamed Oiline. In 1976, it was
sold again, this time to Kobe, and became Kobe Oiline. Kobe was sold to Trico in 1983, but
the  Kobe  Oiline  product  was  spun  off  to  Baker  Intl.,  and  it  became  Bakerlift  Systems.  Trico
had also just purchased the Standard Pump water-well line from REDA. A side branch to this
tree starts with the emergence of Western Technologies in 1978. It was sold to Dresser Indus-
tries  and  renamed  WesTech  in  1982.  Then,  in  1985,  it  was  sold  to  Bakerlift  Systems.  When
Baker Intl. and Hughes merged in 1987, the U.S. operation of Bakerlift was divested and sold
to Trico, but Baker Hughes retained the international segment of the Bakerlift business. Trico’s
product line was made up of equipment from Kobe Oiline, Standard Pump, WesTech, and Bak-
erlift  Systems.  It  was  renamed  Trico  Sub  Services.  On  another  side  branch,  ESP  Inc.  was
formed  in  1983.  Wood  Group  purchased  it  in  1990.  Then,  in  1992,  Trico  Sub  Services  was
purchased by Wood Group and was merged into ESP Inc.

13.3 ESP System
The normal ESP system configuration is shown in Fig. 13.1. It shows a tubing-hung unit with
the downhole components comprising of a multistage centrifugal pump with either an integral
intake  or  separate,  bolt-on  intake;  a  seal-chamber  section;  and  a  three-phase  induction  motor,
with  or  without  a  sensor  package.  The  rest  of  the  system  includes  a  surface  control  package
and  a  three-phase  power  cable  running  downhole  to  the  motor.  Because  of  the  ESP’s  unique
application requirement in deep, relatively small-bore casings, the equipment designer and man-
ufacturer are required to maximize the lift of the pump and the power output of the motor as a
function of the diameter and length of the unit. Therefore, the equipment is typically long and
slender.  The  components  are  manufactured  in  varying  lengths  up  to  approximately  30  ft,  and
for certain applications, either the pump, seal, or motor can be multiple components connected
in series.

Throughout their history, ESP systems have been used to pump a variety of fluids. Normal-
ly,  the  production  fluids  are  crude  oil  and  brine,  but  they  may  be  called  on  to  handle  liquid
petroleum products; disposal or injection fluids; and fluids containing free gas, some solids or
contaminates,  and  CO2  and  H2S  gases  or  treatment  chemicals.  ESP  systems  are  also  environ-
mentally esthetic because only the surface power control equipment and power cable run from
the  controller  to  the  wellhead  are  visible.  The  controller  can  be  provided  in  a  weatherproof,

outdoor version or an indoor version for placement in a building or container. The control equip-
ment  can  be  located  within  the  minimum  recommended  distance  from  the  wellhead  or,  if
necessary, up to several miles away. API RP11S3 provides the guidelines for the proper instal-
lation and handling of an ESP system.3 All the API recommended practices for ESPs are listed
in Table 13.1, some of which are discussed later in this chapter.

13.3.1 Centrifugal Pump.  The ESP is a multistage centrifugal type. A cross section of a typi-
cal design is shown in Fig. 13.2. The pumps function is to add lift or transfer pressure to the
fluid so that it will flow from the wellbore at the desired rate. It accomplishes this by impart-
ing  kinetic  energy  to  the  fluid  by  centrifugal  force  and  then  converting  that  to  a  potential
energy in the form of pressure.

In  order  to  optimize  the  lift  and  head  that  can  be  produced  from  various  casing  sizes,
pumps  are  produced  in  several  diameters  for  application  in  the  most  common  casing  sizes.
Table 13.2 lists some common unit diameters, flow ranges, and typical casing sizes in which
they fit.

Functional Features.  Shaft.  The shaft is connected to the seal-chamber section and motor
by  a  spline  coupling.  It  transmits  the  rotary  motion  from  the  motor  to  the  impellers  of  the
pump  stage.  The  shaft  and  impellers  are  keyed,  and  the  key  transmits  the  torque  load  to  the
impeller. As was mentioned earlier, the diameter of the shaft is minimized as much as possible
because  of  the  restrictions  placed  on  the  pump  outside  diameter.  Therefore,  there  are  usually
several shaft material options available, depending on the maximum horsepower (HP) load and
corrosion protection required.

Housing.  The housing is the pressure-containing skin for the pump. It holds and aligns all
the components of the pump. There are several material options available for different applica-
tion  environments.  For  additional  corrosion  protection,  there  are  several  coatings  that  can  be
applied.

Discharge Head/Tubing Connection.  The discharge head provides a female threaded connec-

tion to the production tubing. There are usually several thread forms and sizes to select from.

Pump Base.  Several different styles of intakes can be selected. They allow for entrance of
the fluid into the bottom of the pump and direct it into the first stage. Integral intakes can be
threaded  directly  into  the  bottom  of  the  housing  during  the  manufacturing  assembly  process,
while others are separate components, which are bolted on to the bottom pump flange.

A standard intake has intake ports that allow fluid to enter the pump. It is used when the
fluid is all liquid or has a very low free-gas content. The intake shown in Fig 13.2 would be a
standard intake if the reverse-flow screen were omitted.

A  reverse-flow  intake  is  used  when  the  free-gas  content  in  the  fluid  is  high  enough  to
cause  pump-performance  problems.  The  pump  in  Fig.  13.2  is  shown  with  a  reverse-flow  de-
sign. The produced fluid with free gas flows up the outside of the reverse-flow intake screen,
makes  a  180°  turn  to  enter  through  the  perforations  or  holes  at  the  top  of  the  screen,  flows
back  down  to  the  intake  ports  and  then  back  up  to  the  first  pump  stage.  These  reversals  in
direction allow for a natural separation of the lighter gases from the liquid. The separated gas
travels up the casing annulus and is vented at the wellhead. Another style is shown in the right-
hand graphic of Fig. 13.3, which has a longer reversing path than does the intake with the screen.
The next step in handling free gas with an ESP involves downhole mechanical separation
devices such as separator intakes. These devices take the fluid that enters its intake ports, im-
part a centrifugal force to it, vent the lighter-density fluid back to the annulus, and transfer the
heavier-density fluid to the first pump stage. The heavier-density fluid, which is routed to the
pump, has been either fully or partially degassed. Two of these devices are shown in the left-
hand  and  center  graphics  of  Fig.  13.3.  The  first  device  is  the  vortex-type  separator.  The
produced fluid, which has already undergone some natural annular separation, is drawn into the
unit  through  the  intake  ports.  These  can  be  straight  intake  ports,  as  already  mentioned,  or  a
reverse-flow-intake style. The fluid is then boosted to the vortex generator by the positive-dis-
placement inducer. The vortex generator is generally an axial-type impeller. It imparts a high-
velocity  rotation  to  the  fluid.  This  causes  the  heavier  fluids  (liquids)  to  be  slung  to  the  outer
area of the flow passageway and the lighter fluids (free-gas laden) to mingle around the inner
area  and  the  shaft.  The  fluid  then  enters  a  stationary flow-crossover  piece. The  crossover  has

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-631

an outer annular passageway that takes the heavier-density fluids that enter it and directs them
to the entrance of the pump. The lighter-density fluid that enters the inner annular passageway
of  the  crossover  is  directed  to  the  separator  vents,  where  it  exits  to  the  casing  annulus  and
flows up the wellbore.

The  second  device  is  a  rotary  centrifuge-type  separator  and  is  shown  on  the  left  in  Fig.
13.3.  It  is  similar  in  design  to  the  vortex  style,  but  it  has  a  rotating  chamber  instead  of  the
vortex generator. The chamber has several radial blades that are enclosed by an outer shroud or
shell. The fluid that enters the chamber is centrifuged at very high g forces over the length of
the  chamber.  Upon  exiting  the  chamber,  the  fluid  enters  the  flow  crossover  and  follows  the
same processing as already described in the vortex style.

Flanged Connection to Seal-Chamber Section.  The bottom flange of the pump bolts to the
flange of the seal-chamber-section head. It maintains axial alignment of the shafts of the two
units. It also allows the floating pump shaft to engage the end of the seal-chamber-section shaft
so  that  the  axial  thrust  produced  by  the  pump  is  transferred  to  the  thrust  bearing  in  the  seal-
chamber section.

Stages.  The stages of the pump are the components that impart a pressure rise to the fluid.
The stage is made up of a rotating impeller and stationary diffuser. The stages are stacked in
series to incrementally increase the pressure to that calculated for the desired flow rate. A graph-
ic of the fluid flow path is illustrated in Fig. 13.4. The fluid flows into the impeller eye area
and energy, in the form of velocity, is imparted to it as it is centrifuged radially outward in the
impeller passageway. Once it exits the impeller, the fluid makes a turn and enters the diffuser
passageway. As it passes through this passageway, the fluid is diffused, or the velocity is con-
verted  to  a  pressure.  It  then  repeats  the  process  upon  entering  the  next  impeller  and  diffuser
set.  This  process  continues  until  the  fluid  passes  through  all  stages,  and  the  design  discharge
pressure is reached. This pressure rise is often referred to as the total developed head (TDH) of
the pump.

There are two styles of stages for the range of flow rates in which ESPs operate. The first
is a radial stage. The impeller is shown in Fig. 13.5 and the diffuser in Fig 13.6. Its geometry
has the flow entering the impeller or diffuser parallel to the axis of the shaft and exiting perpen-
dicular to the shaft, or in a “radial” direction. They are sometimes referred to as “pancake” or
“mushroom” stages, respectively, because of the impellers’ flat shape and the diffusers’ mush-
room-shaped  downthrust  pedestal.  A  cross-sectional  schematic  of  a  radial  stage  is  shown  in
Fig. 13.7.

IV-632

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 13.3—Separator intakes for pumps (after RP11S132).

The second is a mixed-flow stage; a typical impeller is shown in Fig. 13.8, and the diffuser
is shown in Fig. 13.9. Its geometry has the flow exiting the impeller at an angle less than 90°
to the shaft. A graphic of this flow path is shown in Fig. 13.10. Generally, this angle changes
from near perpendicular to near axial, as the design flow rate of the stage increases for a partic-
ular-diameter unit. This relationship is shown in Fig. 13.11.

A  key  feature  for  both  styles  of  stages  is  the  method  by  which  they  carry  their  produced
axial thrust. Usually, the pumps that are under a 6-in. diameter are built as “floater” stages. On
these, the impellers are allowed to move axially on the pump shaft between the diffusers. Con-
trary to the name given to this configuration, the impellers never truly float. They typically run
in  a  downthrust  position,  and  at  high  flow  rates,  they  may  move  into  upthrust.  To  carry  this
thrust,  each  impeller  has  synthetic  pads  or  washers  that  are  mounted  to  the  lower  and  upper

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-633

Fig. 13.4—Centrifugal-pump stage flow path [after Centrilift Graphics, Claremore, Oklahoma (1995)]

surfaces,  as  shown  in  the  previous  figures.  These  washers  transfer  the  thrust  load  from  the
impeller through a liquid film to the smooth thrust pad of the stationary diffuser.

Three  forces  are  involved  in  determining  whether  the  impeller  runs  in  downthrust  or  up-
thrust. The first is the downward force, and it is a result of a portion of the impeller discharge
pressure acting on the area of the top impeller shroud. Two forces act in the upward direction.
One is a result of a portion of the impeller discharge pressure acting against the bottom shroud
of  the  impeller.  The  second  is  the  force  produced  by  the  momentum  of  the  fluid  making  its
turn  in  the  impeller  passageway.  A  graphic  description  of  the  thrust  forces  on  an  impeller  is
shown in Fig. 13.12. Because the shaft is allowed to move axially and positions itself by con-
tact  with  the  seal-chamber  section  shaft,  the  fluid  pressure  causes  a  thrust  load  through  the
shaft to the seal thrust bearing. The thrust is the result of the force on the top end of the shaft
(discharge pressure multiplied by the end area of the shaft) minus the force on the bottom end
of the shaft (intake pressure multiplied by the end area of the shaft).

On 6-in. and larger pumps and on specially built smaller pumps, the impellers are usually
fixed or locked to the shaft. These pumps are referred to as “fixed impeller” or “compression”
pumps.  In  this  configuration,  all  the  thrust  is  transferred  to  the  shaft  and  not  to  the  diffuser.
Therefore, the seal thrust bearing carries the load of all the impellers plus the shaft thrust. Par-
ticular  care  should  be  exercised  in  selecting  the  proper  seal  thrust  bearing  to  match  the  fixed
impeller pump conditions because these loads can be very high.

To  maintain  the  optimum  flow-path  alignment  between  the  impeller  and  its  diffuser,  the
impeller is designed to maintain a downthrust position through its operating range. Usually, the
impeller does not transfer into upthrust until its operating point is to the right of its maximum
recommended point. Stage-specific thrust characteristics should be available from the manufac-
turers.

Performance  Characteristics.    The  manufacturers  state  the  performance  of  their  pump
stages on the basis one stage, 1.0 specific gravity (SG) water at 60- or 50-Hz power. A typical
performance curve for a 4-in.-diameter radial-style pump, with a nominal best-efficiency perfor-

mance flow of 650 B/D, is shown in Fig. 13.13. A mixed-flow style with a nominal flow rate
of 6,000 B/D is shown in Fig. 13.14. In these graphs, the head, brake horsepower (BHP), and
efficiency  of  the  stage  are  plotted  against  flow  rate  on  the  x-axis.  Head,  flow  rate,  and  BHP
are based on test data, and efficiency is calculated on the basis of

efficiency = η p = Q × TDH × SG / (C × BHP), ................................. (13.1)

where Q is given in gal/min, TDH is given in ft, and C = 3,960; or Q is given in m3/d, TDH =
m, and C = 6,750.

The head/flow curve shows the head or lift, measured in feet or meters, which can be pro-
duced by one stage. Because head is independent of the fluid SG, the pump produces the same
head on all fluids, except those that are viscous or have free gas entrained. If the lift is present-
ed in terms of pressure, there will be a specific curve for each fluid, dependent upon its SG.

The  dark  (highlighted)  area  on  the  curve  is  the  manufacturers  recommended  “operating
range.”  It  shows  the  range  in  which  the  pump  can  be  reliably  operated.  The  left  edge  of  the
area is the minimum operating point, and the right edge is the maximum operating point. The
best  efficiency  point  (BEP)  is  between  these  two  points,  and  it  is  where  the  efficiency  curve
peaks.  The  shape  of  the  head/flow  curve  and  the  thrust  characteristic  curve  of  that  particular
stage  determines  the  minimum  and  maximum  points.  The  minimum  point  is  usually  located
where the head curve is still rising, prior to its flattening or dropping off and at an acceptable
downthrust value for the thrust washer load-carrying capabilities. The location of the maximum
point is based on maintaining the impeller at a performance balance based on consideration of
the thrust value, head produced, and acceptable efficiency.

API RP11S2 covers the acceptance testing of ESP pumps.4 It also recommends the perfor-
mance tolerance limits and describes the test procedure. One should pay particular attention to

the  method  of  calculating  the  acceptable  limits  of  the  head/flow  curve.  A  good  layman’s  de-
scription of the method is given in Ref. 5. The limit is calculated by a combination of ± 5%
head and ± 5% flow.

Several  parameters  are  used  to  relate  the  characteristics  of  stages  of  different  size,  under
dynamically similar conditions. They show that head (H) is a function of diameter (D) to the
second  power  and  also  of  rotating  speed  (N)  to  the  second  power.  Flow  (Q)  is  a  function  of
diameter to the third power and also a direct function of rotating speed.

and

Q1 / Q2 = (D1 / D2)3 = (N1 / N2) . .............................................. (13.3)

The BHP curve shows the power required to drive the stage. The power is lowest at shutoff or
zero  flow  and  increases  with  flow.  The  HP  also  follows  the  relationship  that  is  given  in  Eq.
13.4 for different-sized pumps under dynamically similar conditions.

HP1 / HP2 = (D1 / D2)5 = (N1 / N2)3 . ........................................... (13.4)

Another  performance-altering  technique  is  to  reduce  the  diameter  of  an  impeller  by  trim-
ming  or  cutting  back  its  outside  diameter.  When  this  is  done,  the  head,  flow,  and  power  are
changed by the relationships shown in Eqs. 13.5 through 13.7.

For any particular-diameter-pump series, there is generally an overlap region between the radial
and mixed-flow styles. A typical relationship of a family of similar-diameter stages is shown in
Fig.  13.15.  Notice  that  each  style  increases  in  efficiency  as  the  flow  rate  increases,  until  the
efficiency peaks and begins dropping off.

13.3.2 Seal-Chamber Section.6  The  component  located  below  the  lowest  pump  section  and
directly  above  the  motor,  in  a  standard  ESP  configuration,  is  the  seal-chamber  section  (Fig.
13.16). API RP11S7 gives a detailed description of the design and functioning of typical seal-

chamber  sections.7  The  following  discussion  repeats  some  of  this  information,  but  it  is  also
intended to supplement the information contained in API RP11S7. The seal-chamber section is
basically a set of protection chambers connected in series or, in some special cases, in parallel.
This component has several functions that are critical to the operation and run-life of the ESP
system, and the motor in particular.

• It  protects  the  motor  oil  from  contamination  by  the  wellbore  fluid.  The  motor  is  filled
with  a  high-dielectric  mineral  or  synthetic  oil  for  electrical  protection  and  lubrication.  Well
fluid migrating into the motor can potentially cause a premature electrical or mechanical failure
through the reduction of the motor dielectric or lubricating properties.

• It allows for pressure equalization between the interior of the motor and the wellbore. Its
design  allows  for  a  breathing  or  equalization  method  that  compensates  for  pressure  variances
caused by the submergence pressure encountered during the installation from surface pressure
to downhole static pressure and the thermal expansion and contraction of the motor oil because
of motor heat rise during operation.

• It  also  absorbs  the  axial  thrust  produced  by  the  pump  and  dissipates  the  heat  that  the

thrust bearing generates.

Functional  Features.    Shaft.    Usually,  there  are  several  shaft  options  available,  and  their
selection is based on the fluid environment and the HP to be transmitted. Even though a major-
ity of the shaft is exposed only to the clean, dielectric motor oil, the top end is exposed to the
wellbore fluid. Therefore, the material must be an alloy that protects the integrity and function
of  the  shaft.  This  could  be  the  entire  shaft  or,  at  a  minimum,  the  top  section  that  is  directly
exposed to the wellbore fluid.

Labyrinth Protection Chambers.  This  chamber  design  features  a  direct  fluid  interface  be-
tween the wellbore fluid and the motor oil. A typical design layout is shown in Fig. 13.17. It
is commonly referred to as a “labyrinth”- or “U-tube”-style chamber. It is configured to have
several concentric annular volumes that form a U-tube-type communication path for fluids com-
ing  in  the  top  of  the  chamber  to  travel  through  to  get  to  the  exit  point  at  the  base  of  the
chamber. This flow path is shown schematically in Fig. 13.18. In many mild applications, it is
a  very  effective  protection  design.  There  are  several  application  weaknesses  that  need  to  be
considered. First, there is a direct fluid interface between the motor oil and the wellbore fluid
in the top chamber. This allows the motor oil to be slowly wetted through a wicking action of
the wellbore fluid, thereby, slowly degrading the dielectric strength of the motor oil. In some
applications, high-density blocking fluids are used to retard or eliminate this motor oil. Second,
gasses  can  permeate  into  the  motor  oil  causing  potential  corrosion  problems  or  burping  and
excessive loss of motor oil if there is a sudden decompression. Third, the labyrinth’s effective
volume decreases as the chamber is inclined. Therefore, they are not generally recommended at
deviations greater than 30° from vertical.

Positive-Barrier Protection Chambers.  This chamber incorporates a positive barrier between
the wellbore fluid and the motor oil. The barrier is usually an elastomeric or rubber bag, which
is  also  called  a  bladder.  A  typical  design  layout  is  shown  in  Fig.  13.19.  The  bag  or  bladder
forms a seal between the motor oil inside the bag and the wellbore fluid between the bag and

seal-chamber section’s housing. It also allows for pressure compensation by expanding and con-
tracting in this annular area. The motor oil flow path is shown in Fig. 13.20. The barrier-style
chamber is recommended for deviated-well applications. The bladder material should be resis-
tant to the well fluids and any injected chemicals.

Mechanical Face Seals.  A  rotating mechanical face  seal  is  generally located at  the  top  of
each protection chamber. A typical design is shown in Fig. 13.21. The rotating part of the face
seal is sealed to the shaft by elastomeric bellows. The stationary part is sealed into the station-
ary component of the seal-chamber section. A spring preload force then keeps the rotating and
stationary seal faces in contact. Once the unit starts rotating, a hydrodynamic fluid film is de-

veloped on the face. This film then carries the load, prevents wellbore fluid from crossing the
face by the pressure-differential setup, and cools the loaded face.

Axial Thrust Bearing.  This bearing carries all of the axial thrust produced by the pump and
seal-chamber section. Generally, sliding-shoe hydrodynamic types are used for this application
because  of  their  robustness  and  ability  to  function  totally  immersed  in  lubricating  fluid.  It  is
composed  of  two  main  components:  a  stationary  pad  and  a  rotating  flat  disk.  The  stationary
part has pads finished to a very close flatness tolerance, connected to a base by a thin pedestal
or  flexible  joint.  The  rotating  disk  is  also  finished  to  a  very  close  flatness  tolerance.  Several

different bearing designs are shown in Fig. 13.22. They represent standard-style cast bearings
for normal applications and machined bearings for intermediate- and high-load applications.

Performance Characteristics.  When selecting the style and options of a seal-chamber sec-
tion for an application, the user must consider the shaft torque, thrust-bearing load, volumetric
motor oil expansion required, and the wellbore-fluid environment to which it will be subjected.
The  shaft  has  to  transmit,  from  the  motor  to  the  pump,  the  entire  torque  required  by  the
equipment for its application. This not only includes the stabilized running torque but also the
short-term torque spikes caused by unit startup and intermittent pump loads. Because the diam-
eter  of  the  shaft  is  constrained  because  of  the  maximum  diameter  of  the  unit,  materials  of
differing mechanical properties must be used to provide different load capabilities. These mate-
rials must also provide protection from corrosive wellbore fluids.

The  thrust-bearing  performance  is  a  function  of  the  load  that  is  transferred  to  it  and  the
viscosity  of  its  lubricating  oil.  The  load  transmitted  from  the  pump  can  be  calculated  on  the
basis  of  the  pump  geometry  and  the  TDH  produced  for  the  application.  For  “floater”  pumps,
the  shaft  load  is  always  down  and  is  equal  to  the  cross-sectional  area  of  the  top  of  the  shaft
multiplied by the discharge pressure of the pump (Pdischarge ) minus the cross-sectional area of
the  bottom  of  the  shaft  multiplied  by  the  pump  intake  pressure  (PIP).  For  “fixed”  impeller
pumps,  the  load  is  equal  to  the  shaft  force,  as  just  calculated,  plus  the  summation  of  all  the
impeller thrust forces. The impeller thrust forces can be roughly calculated, as previously de-
scribed in the pump-stage section, or obtained from the pump manufacturer.

The  hydrodynamic  thrust  bearing  depends  on  developing  and  maintaining  a  fluid  film  be-
tween the stationary pads and the rotating disk. This fluid film actually carries the load, not the
running of the disk against the pads. In fact, if contact is made between the two components,
heat is generated and rubbing can become severe enough to start bearing failure, even seizure.

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-643

Fig. 13.18—Labyrinth-protection-chamber flow path.6

To maintain the proper film thickness, both the viscosity of the lubricating oil and the operat-
ing  temperature  of  the  thrust  bearing  are  critical.  Most  manufacturers  provide  a  range  of
lubricating oils, so the proper viscosity range can be provided at the estimated operating down-
hole temperature.

The  seal-chamber  section  also  adds  HP  load  to  the  motor.  It  is  usually  a  low  value  and
significant  only  on  lower-HP  applications.  Because  each  style  of  seal-chamber  section  has  its
own characteristics, the manufacturer should be consulted for these values.

The  seal-chamber  section  also  has  to  handle  the  volumetric  expansion  and  contraction  of
the motor oil. This volume includes everything from the top of the seal-chamber section to the
bottom  of  the  motor.  This  expansion  and  contraction  is  a  result  of  the  changing  temperatures
and pressures the unit undergoes during operation. During installation, the unit goes from sur-
face  ambient  conditions  to  wellbore  setting-depth  conditions.  The  impact  of  the  increase  in
pressure does not have a significant impact on the volume occupied by the motor oil, as long
as the unit is vented of air properly during filling. The temperature, on the other hand, causes
the  volume  to  change  significantly.  As  the  motor  oil  heats  up  during  installation,  it  expands,
and the volume that cannot be contained in the seal-chamber section, whether labyrinth or bag
style,  is  vented  from  the  top  chamber  into  the  wellbore  annulus.  When  the  ESP  is  started,  it
undergoes  further  temperature  rise  until  it  reaches  its  stabilized  operating  point.  During  this
stabilization, it continues to vent any expanding volume of motor oil. Once it reaches a stabi-
lized operation, the venting stops and the seal-chamber section and motor run at almost equal
pressure  with  the  wellbore.  The  next  significant  event  is  when  the  ESP  shuts  down.  At  this
point, the motor oil temperature starts dropping from the operating temperature back down to

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

the wellbore ambient. The pressure also increases from wellbore flowing to static. Once again,
the temperature change has the largest impact and, in this case, on fluid contraction.

On a labyrinth style, well fluid is pulled back into the first chamber as the motor oil con-
tracts back along its communication paths (Fig. 13.18). As long as the contraction volume does
not exceed the volume of the first chamber, well fluid is contained in the first chamber. If the
fluid  contraction  exceeds  the  chamber  volume,  well  fluid  is  drawn  into  the  second  or  lower
chamber.  With  multiple  thermal  cycles,  the  well  fluid  can  slowly  be  drawn  towards  the  seal-
chamber section thrust bearing and motor where it can be fatal or, at least, reduce the total run-
life  of  the  equipment.  Because  of  the  method  of  breathing,  the  labyrinth  style  is  not
recommended  for  well  deviations  greater  than  30°.  When  the  labyrinth  chamber  is  tilted  or

IV-646

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

inclined, the effective length of the labyrinth or U-tube communication path is shortened, effec-
tively reducing the volume of the chamber.

The bag style, with its positive barrier, maintains a physical separation of the motor oil and
wellbore fluid during expansion and contraction. Upon contraction, the cylindrical bag collaps-
es around the center of the chamber, absorbing the contraction. Then, on a recycle or tempera-
ture increase, the bag expands to its original position before any motor oil venting is allowed.
A more detailed explanation of these processes is found in the API RP11S7 document.7

In recent years, many operators have begun to run multiple seal-chamber sections in series.
This  gains  additional  chambers  or  more  protection  between  the  well-fluid  entry  point  and  the
motor. While this is true, it must be balanced with the fact that more motor oil fluid volume is
also being added. More motor oil volume means more expansion and contraction. Because the
first  chamber  volume  is  fixed,  there  is  a  better  chance  of  operating  over  the  capacity  of  this
chamber. Therefore, the selection of which style seal-chamber section to use and how many to
run is dependent upon the application. The proper selection is to choose the one in which the
operational expansion cycle uses only a portion of the first chamber. In some very severe appli-
cations,  seal-chamber  sections  with  the  first  two  bag  chambers  communicated  in  parallel
instead of series have been used in an effort to handle the wellbore-fluid contraction volume.

13.3.3 Motor.  The ESP motor is a two-pole, three-phase, squirrel cage, induction design.8,9 A
two-pole design means that it runs at 3,600-rpm synchronous speed at 60-Hz power or roughly
3,500-rpm actual operating speed. It operates on three-phase power at voltages as low as 230
and as high as 5,000, with amperages between 12 and 200. Generally, the length and diameter

determines  the  motors  HP  rating.  Because  the  motor  does  not  have  the  power  cable  running
along its length, it can be manufactured in diameters slightly larger than the pumps and seal-
chamber sections and still fit in the same casing bores. Typical diameters and rated HP ranges
are shown in Table 13.3. A cross section of a motor is shown in Fig. 13.23.

Functional Features.  Wound Stator.  A wound stator comprises an unwound stator, electri-
cal windings, and insulation and encapsulation systems. The unwound stator has thousands of
electrical-grade  steel  laminations  stacked  in  the  housing  and  is  compressed  to  hold  them
aligned and stationary. The laminations are die-punched with a center bore for the rotating com-
ponents to fit into and 18 winding slots for the winding wire. Each slot is insulated with a very-
high-dielectric-strength polyamide insulation material. This slot insulation provides winding-to-
stator (turn-to-ground) electrical protection.

Insulated copper wire called “magnet” wire or “mag” wire is then wound into each slot to
form  three  separate  phase  coils  displaced  at  120°  intervals.  The  insulation  on  the  mag  wire
provides  wire-to-wire  (turn-to-turn)  electrical  protection.  Also,  at  the  end  of  the  lamination
stack,  where  the  coil  has  to  make  a  180°  winding  turn  (“end  turn”),  insulation  is  placed  be-
tween  the  first  winding  phase  and  the  motor  housing  and  then  between  each  phase.  This
protects for phase-to-phase faults.

After the mag-wire winding and insulation is complete, the wound stator is then encapsulat-
ed  with  either  a  solid-fill  epoxy  or  varnish  coating.  The  encapsulation  process  fills  the  voids
left in the slots and around the end-turn coils. This provides several important functions. First,
it  mechanically  holds  the  windings  to  resist  movement  that  causes  wire-to-wire  rubbing  and
possible damage to the wire’s insulation. Second, it adds dielectric strength to the slot winding
and end turns. Third, it significantly improves the overall thermal conductivity for better heat
dissipation from the motor core through the slots to the motor housing skin. And last, it pro-
tects the winding from an attack by contaminates such as wellbore fluid. The last two are less
significant for the varnish coating method. As its name implies, it is just a thin coating, mainly
on the surfaces of the lamination slots and the mag wire, and has voids where motor lubricat-
ing oil accumulates, reducing both the thermal conductivity and the dielectric strength.

The length of the wound stator determines the number of rotors, which also determines the
nameplate HP for a given-diameter motor. Within each given length or HP, there are numerous
voltage/amperage combinations. Typically, there are various selections running from low voltage/
high amperage to high voltage/low amperage. Voltages range from 440 to 4,000+, and amper-
ages typically range from 15 to 150+ amps. The relationship of the HP, voltage, and amperage
is

Shaft.  The shaft transmits the torque produced by the rotors, keeps all the rotating compo-
nents  aligned  axially,  and  provides  a  path  for  the  cooling  and  lubricating  oil  to  the  radial
bearings and rotors. The shaft is generally tubular material, and the hollow core allows for the
motor oil to communicate from the motor head and base areas to the hotter radial bearing and
rotor  areas.  Because  the  shaft  is  completely  immersed  in  clean  oil,  exotic  corrosion-resistant

IV-650

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

materials are not required. Typically, the shaft material is alloyed carbon steel. Its straightness
is also critical because of its close rotating clearances and high speed.

Rotor.  Ideally,  the  rotor  should  be  one  continuous  component  that  runs  the  length  of  the
stator  lamination  bore.  This  would  cause  tremendous  dynamic-instability  problems  because  of
the very large rotor length-to-diameter ratio. Therefore, the rotors are constructed in short seg-
ments  with  radial  support  bearings  placed  between  them  for  dynamic  stability.  Rotors  are
constructed  by  stacking  hundreds  of  thin,  electrical-grade  laminations  between  two  metal  end
rings. Copper rotor bars are inserted into the lamination slots, the whole stack is compressed,
and the rotor bar’s ends are mechanically bonded to the end rings. This results in the “squirrel
cage”  rotor.  The  center  bore  of  the  rotor  has  an  axial-keyway  groove  for  engaging  the  axial
key stock mounted on the motor shaft. This locks the rotor to the shaft for torque transmission
but allows axial movement for thermal growth.

Radial Bearings.  A  sleeve-type-bearing  system  provides  the  alignment  and  radial  support
for the long shaft and rotor assembly. The sleeve part of the journal is keyed to the shaft and
rotates with the shaft. The stationary part of the bearing has a bore in which the sleeve runs. It
has an outside diameter (OD) that has a small clearance with the stator-lamination inside diam-
eter. Also, the stator laminations at the bearing locations are made of nonmagnetic material to
reduce the rotating magnetic field and the rotational forces tending to rotate the radial bearing.
In some designs, an elastomer ring or locking key is located between the bearing OD and the
stator inside diameter (ID) to prevent or retard any relative rotation. If rotation does occur, the
bearing  may  start  wearing  into  the  stator  until  contact  with  the  phase  mag  wires  causes  an
electrical short.

Motor Head.  The motor head contains the electrical termination for the connection of the
three-phase  windings  to  the  electrical  power  cable.  This  connection  is  made  in  an  insulated
cavity either by a male/female plug-in design or a motor-wire to power-cable-wire splice. Also,
a small thrust bearing is located in the head. It is designed to carry the weight of the shaft and
rotor  stack  during  startup  and  maintains  the  axial  position  of  the  rotors  and  radial  bearings
relative to the stator.

Performance Characteristics.  The performance of a submersible motor is usually character-
ized by the manufacturer’s performance curve. An example is shown in Fig. 13.24. The curve
represents typical motor performance for a given motor diameter, based on the average of sev-
eral  tests.  To  get  the  curve  data,  a  motor  is  loaded  across  a  broad  HP  load  range  with  a
dynamometer. A detailed description of these tests is given in Ref. 10. Data collected include:
three-phase voltage, amperage, kilowatts, speed or rpm, motor torque, motor temperature rise,
and  fluid  velocity  past  the  motor.  The  motor  amperage,  rpm,  efficiency,  and  temperature  rise
are especially important for the proper application of any motor. Even though the motor temper-
ature  rise  is  measured  during  the  dynamometer  test,  it  is  not  generally  plotted  on  the  motor
characteristic  curve.  This  is  because  it  is  a  critical  parameter  in  the  proper  application  of  the
motor, and its value is affected by several application conditions.

Amperage.  The  motor  current  is  nearly  linear  with  HP  loading  and  is  one  of  the  easiest
parameters to measure. Because of this, it is the most useful for determining the actual loading
of the motor. On the basis of nameplate current rating of the motor and the amperage curve of
the motor characteristics, an output HP can be determined. Calculate the percentage of name-
plate amps in which the motor runs, and determine the percent of nameplate HP the motor is
developing.

Revolutions per Minute (RPM).  The rotational speed or RPM of the motor at its application
load point is very important in determining the operating point or output of the pump. The pump-
performance curve used in determining the head and flow output of the pump for its applica-
tion is based on a pump-motor speed of 3,500 RPM. If the RPM varies from 3,500, the pump
flow  will  vary  with  the  ratio  of  the  speed,  and  the  flow  rate  will  vary  with  the  ratio  of  the

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

(1995)].

speed  squared.  (See  Eqs.  13.1  and  13.2.)  Once  again,  by  knowing  the  percent  of  nameplate
amps, the motor speed can be read from the motor characteristic curve. Even though this RPM
change  is  usually  small,  it  can  still  impact  the  final  motor  and  pump  operating  point  for  a
particular  application.  When  the  pump-performance  point  is  modified,  because  of  the  motor
RPM, the pump head and flow rate change; therefore, the load on the motor is changed. Deter-
mining the final pump operating point and motor loading point becomes an iterative process.

Efficiency.  Because  power  costs  are  a  major  part  of  the  overall  expense  of  operating  an
ESP, the efficiency of the motor is an important factor. The efficiency curve for a submersible
motor has a fairly flat peak through its normal operating range but starts dropping off signifi-
cantly  at  less  than  50%  loading.  Note  that  this  efficiency  curve  is  based  on  the  nameplate
voltage being maintained at the motor. If the surface power is not optimized, the voltage deliv-
ered to the motor can vary, and the efficiency drops off. Fig. 13.25 shows the constant motor
HP  plotted  as  a  function  of  current  and  voltage.  It  indicates  that  as  the  motor  voltage  is  in-
creased  or  decreased  away  from  its  nameplate  rating,  the  current  increases,  resulting  in  a
decrease in efficiency. Therefore, the ESP-motor operating efficiency can be optimized by ad-
justing the surface voltage and monitoring the motor amperage until the bottom of the current
or amps curve is found.

Motor Temperature Rise.  The  temperature-rise  data  of  the  motor,  where  provided,  are  an
indication  of  the  average  winding  temperature  rise  above  the  ambient  motor  temperature.  At
test  conditions,  with  water  circulating  by  the  motor  at  1  ft/sec,  submersible  motors  typically
have rises of 50 to 100°F (10 to 38°C). Under wellbore-application conditions, the temperature
rise is affected by various parameters, including: the velocity and thermal-conductivity charac-
teristics  of  the  production  fluid  flowing  past  the  motor  skin,  API  gravity  of  the  crude,  water
cut, the percentage of free gas, fluid emulsions, fluid scaling tendencies, voltage imbalance at
the motor terminals, and the use of a variable-speed drive. Typically, the industry guideline has

(1985)].

been a 1-ft/sec flow by the motor, but there are many applications with velocities below this.
The manufacturers have a method for calculating or estimating the impact of these parameters
on the heat rise of their motors.

The  rating  of  a  motor  or  its  nameplate  HP  is  determined  by  its  designer,  on  the  basis  of
these same performance-test values.11 Specifically, the designer is interested in the voltage, am-
perage,  and  HP  ratings  that  provide  the  best  motor  performance  for  general  operating  condi-
tions.  Additionally,  there  are  only  three  absolute  limits  that  also  influence  the  nameplate  HP
rating. These limits include mechanical, torque, and temperature.

Mechanical Limit.  The  mechanical  constraints  applied  to  the  motor  rating  are  determined
by  the  maximum  torsional-load  capability  of  the  design  and  materials.  This  limit  is  based  on
the mechanical strength properties and the geometry of the shaft.

Torque Limit.  Here, the designer is looking at the maximum torque of the motor at rated
voltage. For a particular motor design, a motor can produce only a given amount of torque for
the volume of available active material. The active material is the material that contributes to
producing magnetic flux. The maximum amount of torque a motor can produce is called break-
down or pullout torque. The breakdown torque of the motor is usually greater than 2.5 times
the existing running torque, which poses no practical limit to the HP rating.

Changing the frequency of the electrical power can also vary the torque or HP rating of the
motor.  Generally,  the  motor’s  HP  rating  is  based  on  either  50-  or  60-Hz  power.  A  fixed  fre-
quency  motor  has  a  specified  full-load  nameplate  HP  at  the  specified  nameplate  voltage,  as
stated earlier. This same torque can be achieved at other speeds by varying the voltage in pro-
portion to the frequency. This maintains a constant magnetizing current and flux density, which
provides  a  constant  available  torque.  Therefore,  the  HP  output  rating  of  the  motor  is  directly
proportional to the frequency or speed (Eq. 13.9) because power rating is a function of torque
(ft-lbf) multiplied by speed (Eq. 13.10).

and

HPm = (T × N) / 5,250. ..................................................... (13.10)

Temperature  Limit.  For  this  limit,  the  designer  is  interested  in  the  maximum  temperature
rating of the insulation system and the motor bearing lubrication system. The high-tech insula-

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-653

tion  used  in  today’s  ESP  motors  allows  an  insulation  temperature  rating  in  excess  of  500°F
(260°C).  The  limiting  factor  is  the  motor  bearing  system.  Even  though  significant  advances
have  been  made  in  bearing  design  and  motor  oil  formulations,  the  maximum  recommended
operating temperature of an ESP motor is around 400°F (205°C). There have been application
incursions above this, but they have generally been made with experimental designs or in appli-
cations where a reduced ESP run-life has been accepted.

An  important  application  point  is  that  the  proper  motor  oil  lubricating  viscosity  must  be
maintained at the motor operating temperature. Therefore, the manufacturers provide and speci-
fy  several  grades  of  dielectric  motor  oils  to  cover  the  range  of  motor  operating  temperatures.
Each type of oil has a minimum and maximum recommended motor operating temperature.

13.3.4 Power Cable.  The  ESP  power  cable  transmits  the  required  surface  power  to  the  ESP
motor. Typically, it is banded or clamped to the production tubing from below the wellhead to
the ESP unit because it is not designed to support its own weight. It is a specially constructed
three-phase power  cable designed  specifically for  downhole  well  environments. The  cable de-
sign must be small in diameter, protected from mechanical abuse, and impervious to physical
and  electrical  deterioration  because  of  aggressive  well  environments.  They  are  available  in  a
wide  range  of  conductor  sizes  or  gauges.  They  can  be  manufactured  in  either  round  or  flat
configurations, using several different insulation and metal armor materials for different hostile
well  environments.  Cross-sectional  views  of  flat  and  round  cable  construction  are  shown  in
Figs. 13.26 and 13.27. There are two very good documents that fully describe the design, ap-
plication,  and  testing  of  ESP  submersible  power  cables—API  RP11S5  and  RP11S6.12,13  This
section will repeat some of the basic information and add supplemental information.

Functional Features.14  Conductor.  Conductors are copper wires that can be either a single
solid  configuration  or  multiple  smaller  strands.  Solid  conductors  offer  more  advantages  than
their  stranded  counterpart.  They  are  smaller,  easier  to  clean  and  splice,  do  not  adsorb  gases,
have  a  smoother  surface  to  the  insulation,  which  reduces  electrical  stress,  and  they  are  less
expensive.  Stranded  cable  offers  more  mechanical  flexibility,  but  this  is  usually  not  an  over-
riding benefit. Also, unless the voids in the strand are filled, gases can migrate up or down the
cable more easily.

The copper conductor is generally tinned or coated with a tin/lead alloy when it is insulated
with polypropylene. In certain well environments, direct contact between copper and polypropy-
lene  can  cause  “copper  poisoning”  of  the  insulation,  which  reduces  its  electrical  strength  and
degrades its physical properties. Synthetic-rubber insulation does not react with copper, so the
vast majority of all rubber-insulated ESP cables are made with bare copper conductors.

Insulation.  There are  two  basic  types  of  insulation used  in  ESP  cable: polypropylene and
ethylene  propylene  diene  monomer  (EPDM)  synthetic  rubber.  Polypropylene  or  “poly”  is  the
lower-temperature-rated insulation, a tougher material than rubber, and generally more cost ef-
fective. The insulation temperature rating for poly is 205°F (96°C), but it can be increased to
225°F (107°C) with the addition of an extruded protective layer of lead.15 Above these temper-
atures, a rubber insulation is always required. The EPDM is the insulation of choice for synthetic-
rubber-insulation  cables.  The  compounding  of  the  rubber,  with  more  than  twenty  other
ingredients,  allows  for  it  to  be  designed  to  have  low  oil  swell,  fairly  low  elongation,  and  a
high  modulus.  By  contrast,  the  EPDM  formulated  for  surface  power  cable  is  not  suitable  for
downhole oilwell service because of its excessive swell characteristic. Most high-quality EPDM-
based insulation is rated for conductor temperatures up to 450°F (232°C).16

Insulation Protective Layers.  The EPDM-insulated conductors need protection from the oil-
well  environment  because  of  swelling  in  the  oil.  To  provide  protection  from  the  oil  and  to
control  swelling,  different  types  of  protective  layers  are  applied  over  the  insulation.  Starting
from the lowest level of protection to the highest, these layers are discussed next.

IV-654

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 13.26—ESP flat power cable (after RP11S512).

Tapes and Braids.  Thin  tapes  of  polyvinyl  fluoride  are  wrapped  over  the  EPDM-insulated
single  conductors.  The  limitation  of  the  tape  is  that  it  has  an  overlap  that  allows  oil  to  seep
through. To make the tapes more effective, a 50% overlap can be used. To add some addition-
al  containment,  braids  can  be  put  over  the  tape.  Common  braid  materials  are  nylon  and
polyester,  which  have  temperature  limits  in  water  of  about  250°F  (121°C).  More  expensive
engineered  filaments  can  be  used  to  extend  this  temperature  rating  to  300  to  400°F  (149  to
205°C).

Extruded Barrier.  The next level of protection is a continuous extrusion of a high-tempera-
ture plastic layer over the insulation. The extruded barrier has no overlaps to let the oil contact
the  insulation.  In  addition,  it  increases  the  electrical  strength  of  the  insulation  system.  It  also
increases the chemical resistance of the cable, and in gassy wells, it regulates the rate of decom-
pression  of  wellbore  gases  that  have  saturated  into  the  insulation.  Extruded  barriers  are  made
from  fluoropolymers,  such  as  polyvinylidene  fluoride  (PVDF)  rated  up  to  320°F  (160°C)  and
fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) (Teflon®) rated up to 400°F.

Lead Barrier.  In  wells  that  have  a  damaging  amount  of  hydrogen  sulfide  gas,  the  copper
conductors can be attacked and destroyed. To protect against this, a thin layer of lead is extrud-
ed over the insulation. For poly insulation, the lead increases the maximum operating tempera-
ture  of  the  cable.  For  EPDM  insulation,  fabric  tape  or  a  braid  is  placed  over  the  lead  as  a
manufacturing aid to minimize distortion of the lead during armoring. This step is not required

for poly, because it is harder and more difficult to distort during the armoring process. General-
ly, lead cables are manufactured in flat configurations but can be made in round configurations
for added containment and protection.

Jacket.    The  jacket  is  designed  to  protect  the  insulation  from  physical  damage.  Also,  in
round cables, the jacket fills the space between the insulated conductors and the inside of the
armor  so  that  the  armor  can  effectively  contain  the  whole  cable  from  oil  and  decompression
swelling. Typical jacket materials include nitrile and EPDM rubber. Nitrile rubber has an oper-
ating  temperature  of  280°F  (138°C)  and  is  very  resistant  to  oil  swelling.  As  discussed  in  the
insulation section, the EPDM rubber’s properties can be varied by its compounding but is rated
up to 400°F (205°C), and it swells in oil.

Armor.  The metal armor that is wound around the three insulated conductors (flat cable) or
the jacketed conductors (round cable) has a primary function of providing mechanical protec-
tion  to  the  insulated  conductors.  On  round  cable,  it  has  the  added  function  of  providing
additional containment protection for oil swelling and gas decompression. The armor is usually
made of mild galvanized steel, which is applicable to non- to mildly-corrosive wells. The galva-
nized  armor  is  usually  offered  in  several  thicknesses,  which  increases  the  mechanical  and
corrosion protection. In more-corrosive applications, specialty metals are available, such as stain-
less steel and other alloys.

Flat Construction.  The  typical  construction  and  geometry  of  the  ESP  flat  power  cable  is
shown in Fig. 13.26. It has the three insulated conductors laying parallel with armor wrapped
around them, providing a lower profile when the clearance between the casing ID and production-
tubing  outside  diameter  (OD)  is  limited.  Flat  cable  is  not  suitable  for  containing  oil  swell  or
gas decompression forces because of the interstices between the single conductors. If the insula-
tion or jacket expands on a flat cable, it will deform the armor, bending it apart over its long
axis and allowing the conductors to slide over one another. Insulation and jacket expansion can
cause  insulation  splitting,  leading  to  potential  electrical  failure.  Flat  cables,  by  virtue  of  their

IV-656

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

parallel conductor configuration, have an inherently induced imbalance. Flat-cable induced volt-
age  and  current  imbalance  is  usually  not  a  practical  consideration  in  lengths  less  than  10,000
ft, unless the well is very hot and is pushing the thermal limits of the motor.

Round Construction.  Round cable is superior to flat cable because it provides more protec-
tion  to  the  conductors.  Its  typical  construction  and  geometry  are  shown  in  Fig.  13.27.  Round
cable provides superior containment to the cable core, enabling it to better withstand decompres-
sion  and  oil  swell  forces  without  damage.  Because  pressure  is  naturally  contained  in  a  round
shape  and  the  space  between  the  insulation  and  the  inside  of  the  cable  armor  is  filled  with
jacket material, the cable armor acts to restrain and prevent any insulation expansion because
of oil swell or gas-decompression expansion. Round cable is also naturally impedance balanced
because of the equidistant spacing between the conductors. Therefore, there are no voltage or
current imbalance issues affecting the motor.

Motor Lead Extension (MLE).  The motor lead extension cable, also referred to as the motor
flat,  is  a  specially  constructed,  low-profile,  flat  cable.  It  is  spliced  to  the  lower  end  of  the
round or flat main power cable, banded to the side of the ESP pump and seal-chamber section,
and has the male termination for plugging or splicing into the motor electrical connection. Be-
cause of its need for low profile, it requires compact construction. It generally has a thin layer
of high-dielectric-strength polyamide material wrapped or bonded directly to the copper conduc-
tors.  This  allows  for  a  thinner  layer  of  insulation  material,  allowing  for  a  lower  profile.  The
MLE is generally selected on the basis of equipment: casing clearance and the voltage capacity
requirement.

Performance Characteristics.  The  cable  materials  for  the  wellbore  application  should  be
selected from the guidelines already provided and by the cable manufacturer. These guidelines
include:

• Insulation up to 205°F (96°C) uses polypropylene insulated cables. Over 205°F and up to

450°F (232°C), it utilizes synthetic rubber insulated cables.

• Gassy wellbores use a cable that provides protection from decompression damage. This is
a construction that adds hoop strength to the insulation to contain the insulation from expand-
ing and rupturing. Generally, tapes and braids, as well as extruded barriers, provide this protection.
• Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)—generally lead barrier cables are used to protect the copper con-

ductor from damage.

Once  the  proper  cable  materials  have  been  determined  for  the  wellbore  environment,  the
only remaining variable is the conductor size. The conductor size can be optimized on the ba-
sis of motor voltage/amperage rating and the casing clearance. Because there are several motor
voltage/amperage combinations available for the HP required for the application, the selection
of the cable to match the motor can be based on either the surface switchgear and transformer
available or the most favorable economic evaluation. The testing methods and acceptance crite-
ria are discussed and provided in Ref. 17.

Cable Voltage Drop.  Because of conductor resistance, there will be a voltage drop from the
surface  supply  to  the  motor  terminals.  The  voltage  drop  of  a  particular  gauge  cable  can  be
determined from the cable voltage drop vs. the amperage graph shown in Fig. 13.28. This val-
ue  is  for  a  conductor  temperature  of  77°F  (25°C)  and  a  length  of  1,000  ft.  To  determine  the
conductor temperature in its application, a power cable ampacity chart must be used. There is a
separate curve for each conductor gauge and round or flat configuration. An ampacity plot for
No. 2 American Wire Gauge (AWG) solid, round cable is shown in Fig. 13.29. In it, the vari-
ous  conductor  temperatures  are  plotted  against  the  current  carried  and  the  maximum  well
temperature. The temperature correction factor for the cable voltage drop can then be calculat-
ed with Eq. 13.11.

where TCF is the temperature correction factor for cable, and Tconductor is the wellbore tempera-
ture at the ESP setting depth. This calculation provides a worst-case cable-voltage loss because
it  assumes  that  the  entire  cable  conductor  is  at  the  same  temperature.  Computer  sizing  pro-
grams actually provide a closer estimation of the voltage drop because they consider the wellbore-
temperature  gradient  from  the  wellhead  to  the  ESP-setting  depth  and  additional  wellbore
heating caused by the ESP-efficiency losses.

Once the voltage drop of the cable has been determined, the voltage available at the motor
terminals  can  be  calculated  (surface  supply  voltage  minus  cable  voltage  drop).  If  the  voltage
delivered  to  the  motor  terminals  is  low  compared  to  the  motor  nameplate  voltage  (typically
< 50 to 60%), there could be motor starting issues. One should contact the motor manufacturer
for  application  assistance  in  this  case.  If  the  motor  HP  and  the  cable  length  are  known,  the
graphs, shown in Fig. 13.30, can be used for a quick approximation in the selection of motor
voltage and cable size.

13.3.5 Motor Controllers.  The surface controller provides power to the ESP motor and pro-
tects  the  downhole  ESP  components.  There  are  three  types  of  motor  controllers  used  on  ESP
applications and all are generally specifically designed for application with ESPs. They include
the switchboard, soft starter, and the variable speed controller. All units vary in design, physi-
cal  size,  and  power  ratings.  They  are  offered  in  two  versions:  indoor,  NEMA  1  and  outdoor,
NEMA 3. Normally, all utilize solid state circuitry to provide protection, as well as a means of
control for the ESP system.

Motor  controller  designs  vary  in  complexity  from  the  very  simple  and  basic  to  the  very
sophisticated, which offer numerous options to enhance the methods of control, protection, and

monitoring of the ESP operation. The selection of the type of controller and optional features
depends on the application, supporting economics, and the preferred method of control.

Fixed-Frequency Switchboard.  The  switchboard,  fixed-speed  controller,  or  across-the-line
starter  consists  of  a  manual  fused  disconnect  switch  or  circuit  breaker,  a  motor  starter,  and  a
control  power  transformer.  Because  this  controller  is  only  a  switch  and  does  not  modify  the
input voltage or current, it provides full-rated, instantaneous voltage to the downhole ESP sys-
tem.  The  low  inertia  characteristics  of  the  ESP  allow  for  it  to  be  at  full  rated  speed  within
0.200 seconds. During this starting process, the ESP motor can draw between 4 to 8 times its
nameplate,  or  rated  current,  allowing  it  to  produce  several  times  its  rated  torque.  This  can
cause  excessive  electrical  and  mechanical  stresses  on  the  ESP  equipment  in  some  situations.
Normally, on deep-set systems with long lengths of power cable, the voltage drop, because of
the cable, allows for a reduction in these stresses.

Functional Features.  Disconnect Switch. The manual disconnect switch allows for the pri-
mary  power  to  be  shut  off  from  the  outside  of  the  unit.  It  is  also  fused  to  provide  circuit
protection in case of power surges.

Control Power Transformer (CPT).  The CPT generally has multiple taps for selection of a
range of output voltages. This allows a switchboard to be used within its rated range for differ-
ent voltage- and amperage-rated motors.

Recording Ammeter.  The recording ammeter historically has been a pen-type chart recorder
that  plots  one  leg  of  the  three-phase  current.  Currently,  there  are  digital  monitoring  systems
available that monitor all three-phase currents. They also have capability to store the monitored
data in memory and display these data in graphical format.

IV-660

Control Module.  These are solid-state devices that offer basic functions necessary to moni-
tor and operate the ESP in a reliable manner. The unit examines the inputs from the CPT and
other input signals and compares them with preprogrammed parameters entered by the opera-
tor. Some of the functions include overload and time-delayed underload protection, restart time
delay, and protection for voltage or current imbalance. Additional external devices can be con-
nected, which provide for downhole pump intake pressure protection, downhole motor tempera-
ture protection, surface tank high/low level controls, line pressure switches, and others.

Soft-Start Controllers.  The soft starter is designed to reduce the high electrical and mechan-
ical stresses that are associated with starting ESP systems. Typically, these are systems that are
either  on  very  short  cables  or  are  very  high  HP  relative  to  their  mechanical  rating.  The  soft
starter is similar to a standard switchboard, except that it is designed to drop the voltage to the
motor  during  the  initial  startup  phase.  The  drop-in  voltage  reduces  the  inrush  current,  thus
“softening”  the  starting  characteristic.  These  devices  use  either  primary  reactors  or  solid-state
devices to control the amount of power delivered to the motor as it is coming up to speed. A
soft starter typically extends the time for the motor to reach full speed from 0.200 seconds of
the across the line switchboard to 0.500 seconds. After this startup period, the soft-start system
switches off and the controller becomes a normal switchboard.

Most  ESP  design  and  application  software  programs  evaluate  the  downhole  system  for
these electrical and mechanical stresses and will advise as to whether a soft start is recommend-
ed. If a system is too soft, a motor could be damaged because of cogging or failure to reach
starting speed.

Variable Speed Controllers.18  A variable speed controller (VSC), also referred to as a vari-
able  speed  drive,  designed  for  use  with  ESP  systems,  was  first  used  in  the  late  1970s.  Since
that  time,  the  industry  has  seen  a  significant  increase  in  their  use.  This  increase  has  been  a
result of the benefits that variable speed ESP operations can bring to the artificial-lift applica-
tion.  With  the  benefits  comes  an  increase  in  the  complexity  and  cost  of  the  total  system.
Therefore, to properly apply and receive the maximum benefit, the end user should understand
both the potential benefits and cautions in using VSCs. Benefits include: a broadened applica-
tion  range  of  the  ESP  pump,  optimal  efficiency  of  the  downhole  system,  maximum  well
production,  electrical  isolation  of  the  downhole  equipment  from  surface  power  disturbances,
reduced starting stresses, production matched with surface processes, and maintenance improve-
ments for operations in high free-gas applications. Cautions include: higher initial-capital cost,
increased design complexity, interface with the electrical utility, additional motor heating, poten-
tial increase in voltage stresses, and possibly higher electrical cost.

One  should  appreciate  and  understand  the  potential  for  problems  or  damage  to  the  down-
hole  equipment  if  certain  types  of  VSCs  are  not  applied  and  operated  correctly.  Since  the
introduction of the first VSC, the design has been simplified and reliability increased. Also, the
user understanding of the system and user friendliness of the VSC have been greatly increased.
Both the benefits and cautions are discussed in more detail in Sec. 13.3.6.

VSCs  used  with  ESPs  should  be  designed  for  the  specific  requirements  of  the  downhole
ESP motor and pump. This is because of the unique design and characteristics of the downhole
centrifugal pump and submersible motor as compared to their surface counterparts. Generally,
the VSC is designed to provide a constant volts/hertz output through a broad range of frequen-
cy  variations.  The  magnetic  flux  that  is  generated  in  the  stator  of  the  submersible  motor  and
passes  through  the  rotors  is  directly  proportional  to  the  voltage  and  inversely  proportional  to
the frequency of the applied power. The result is a constant magnetic flux density in the motor.
Because the output torque of the motor is proportional to the magnetic flux density, the motor
is  a  constant-torque  variable-speed  device.  Also,  because  of  its  low  inertia  characteristics  and
unique  rotor  design,  it  does  not  have  the  same  high-operating-speed  restrictions  as  a  typical
surface  induction  motor.  Therefore,  a  VSC  is  typically  applied  to  frequencies  from  30  to  90

Hz, with its minimum and maximum frequencies restricted only by the mechanical limitations
of the downhole ESP equipment.

Functional Features.  The fundamental building blocks of variable speed technology are an
input rectifier or converter, a DC bus, and an output inverter, as shown in Fig. 13.31. In gener-
al, a converter is a piece of electrical equipment that changes electrical energy from one form
to another. It may change the voltage and current magnitudes, change AC to DC or DC to AC,
and  change  the  frequency.  VSCs  applied  to  ESP  equipment  are  AC  to  AC  converters.  They
convert the input 460 volts, 60-Hz power (380 to 460 volts, 50 Hz) to output 40 to 480 volts,
10- to 120-Hz power.

Input Rectifier (Converter).  This unit converts the input AC voltage and current to DC cur-
rent  and  power.  Current  input  rectifiers  contain  either  diode  bridges  or  silicon  controlled
rectifiers (SCRs). There are several types of input rectifiers, which are discussed next.

First, there is the three-phase full bridge rectifier. This most common rectifier in high-pow-
er electronics uses six devices, which are usually diodes or SCRs, to form the bridge. Two of
the devices are connected to each of the incoming power phases. One device connects to the
positive DC bus and the other to the negative bus. Each of these devices conducts during ei-
ther  the  positive  or  negative  half  cycle  of  its  respective  phase.  This  means  that  we  get  two
pulses on each incoming phase; thus, in total, it is a six-pulse converter. These converters are
somewhat invariant and can cause input current total harmonic distortion (THD) levels of 25 to
35%.

Multipulse converter rectifiers are also used. They reduce input current harmonics in high-
power electronic equipment. Most systems used today are multiple three-phase bridge rectifiers
connected in parallel via phase or time-shifted power supplies. In multipulse systems, two puls-
es per phase are still achieved. Thus, the pulse number is always twice its input phase number.
A phase-shifted power supply is accomplished by using a phase-shifting transformer. The trans-
former  is  connected  to  three-phase  power  and,  through  a  vector  combination  of  these  three
phases, develops the required number output phases. The most common multiphase system is a
twelve-pulse bridge. It uses two six-pulse converters that are phase-shifted by 30 degrees. Nor-
mally,  this  converter  can  reduce  the  THD  to  a  level  of  about  8%.  Higher-pulse  number
converters further reduce the input current distortion levels. For example, an eighteen-pulse con-
verter will produce less than 3% THD.

DC Bus.  The DC bus of the VSC is composed of passive, noncontrolled devices. Typical
elements  include  inductors,  capacitors,  and  resistors.  These  devices  form  a  damped  low-pass
filter to smooth the DC voltage and current that is provided from the input rectifier. Depending
on the design of the VSC, the DC bus provides a smooth DC voltage or current source to the
output inverter. Typically, in medium-horsepower VSC units, the DC bus is composed of multi-

IV-662

ple  inductors,  capacitors,  and/or  resistors  to  achieve  the  design  voltage  and  current  ratings.
Some  designs  include  only  inductors;  others  have  only  capacitors  and  resistors,  while  some
have all three. The selection of the design and size of the components determines the effect of
the VSC’s input current distortion and its overall performance.

Output Inverter.  The output inverter converts the DC power provided by the DC bus to a
variable-frequency, AC power. This inverter can be either a voltage or current source inverter.
In  a  voltage  source  inverter,  the  output  voltage  waveform  is  controlled,  and  the  load  applied
determines the output current waveform. The current source inverter is just the opposite. In it,
the output current waveform is controlled, and the load applied determines the output voltage
waveform. Most VSCs for ESP applications use the voltage source inverter.

Current Source Inverters.  In a current source inverter, large inductors are used to supply a
current  source  to  the  inverter.  The  current  is  normally  controlled  by  an  SCR.  The  current
source inverter controls only the output frequency of the drive, while the input converter con-
trols  the  current  and  voltage.  The  inverter  may  operate  in  six  steps  or  with  pulse-width-
modulated (PWM) inverters.

Voltage Source Inverters.  In a voltage source inverter, large banks of capacitors act as low
impedance DC voltage sources for the inverter. The inverter changes the DC voltage by one of
several switching methods. These methods generally fall into two categories: a variable voltage
inverter (VVI) or constant voltage inverter (CVI). A VVI usually employs a controlled rectifier
to  control  the  DC  bus  voltage  and,  thereby,  the  output  voltage  of  the  inverter.  In  a  CVI,  the
output is controlled by the method of switching.

Variable Voltage Inverters.  VVI drives are most generally six step inverters. The unit con-
sists  of  six  switches,  each  turning  on  and  off  one  time  during  every  output  cycle.  The  name
comes from the fact that each cycle is divided into six 60° periods. During each period, there
is  a  unique  combination  of  power  devices  activated.  This  results  in  a  phase-to-phase  voltage
waveform that has six identifiable “steps” to approximate a sine wave (Fig. 13.32). This is also
referred to as a “quasisine wave” inverter. The inverter controls only the output frequency, and
the electrical stresses on the power devices are significantly reduced over other output topolo-
gies.

Pulse-Width-Modulated  Inverters.    PWM  inverters  also  consist  of  six  switches,  but  they
switch many times per output cycle to control both the output voltage and frequency. The volt-
age  waveform  is  divided  into  many  small  time  periods  that  range  from  several  hundred  to
several thousand (Fig. 13.33). During each period, the instantaneous output voltage is approxi-
mated by a square wave at some duty cycle. A 100% duty cycle would represent full voltage,
while 0% would represent zero voltage.

To generate a sine wave, these pulses start at zero width and build, sinusoidally, to 100%
duty cycle at the 90° point on the waveform. Then, they would decrease in width sinusoidal to
zero at the 180° point of the waveform. The output voltage level is the integral of these pulse
widths  of  DC  bus  voltage  height  over  any  given  cycle.  This  integration  is  performed  by  the
inductance  of  the  motor,  and  the  resultant  current  waveform  becomes  more  and  more  sinu-
soidal as more pulses are used. To vary the average voltage, each pulse width is multiplied by
a scale factor (to get half the output voltage, each pulse must be one-half its original width).

The  electrical  stresses  on  the  power  devices  of  a  PWM  inverter  are  significantly  higher
than a six-step inverter. Each switching transition causes high losses in the power devices, oc-
curring hundreds or thousands of times per cycle. Therefore, extra care must be taken to ensure
that these electrical stresses are managed properly.

Control  Module.    This  unit  functions  the  same  as  explained  in  the  switchboard  section.
When used with a VSC, the controller can be programmed to provide some speed adjustment
depending on certain input conditions. If the input indicates the unit is approaching or is in a
shut-down parameter range, the controller could send a signal to the VSC to change its frequen-

(1998)].

cy,  within  its  preprogrammed,  allowable  frequency  range.  If  this  specific  parameter  moved
back into its preprogrammed operating range, the controller would maintain this VSC frequen-
cy until the next input parameter occurrence. In most cases, there is a preset time function for
this adjustment to take effect; otherwise the unit would shut down.

13.3.6 Application Considerations.  Because of the relationship of the performance of a cen-
trifugal  pump  to  its  rotational  speed  (Eqs.  13.2  through  13.4),  the  VSC  allows  for  wider
flexibility of the downhole ESP system. The effect on pump operation is shown in Fig. 13.34.
This is the same pump that is represented in the 60-Hz fixed-speed performance curve of Fig.

IV-664

Oklahoma (2003)].

13.14.  This  allows  the  designer  to  select  the  flow  rate  and  speed  of  the  system  on  the  initial
design. For this pump stage, it can be operated between 1,800 B/D at 30 Hz (minimum recom-
mended operating point) and 10,200 B/D at 90 Hz (maximum recommended operating point).
The benefits of VSC usage are discussed next.

Broadened Application Range.  On fixed-speed operation, a pump stage has a recommend-
ed  minimum  and  maximum  flow  rate.  Beyond  these  points,  the  pump  can  operate  in  a
detrimental run-life or reliability area. By operating at reduced frequency, the minimum recom-
mended operating point is reduced, and, at higher frequencies, the maximum operating point is
increased. This allows the application of ESPs in low-productivity-index (PI) wells and higher
flow rates to be obtained from small bore casings. It also allows a limited inventory of pumps
to be applied over a broader flow range.

ESP Efficiency Optimization.  Either when an ESP system is initially designed or after it is
deployed, adjusting the frequency of the unit can maximize the total system efficiency. In light
of wellbore PI uncertainties, this allows the operator some flexibility between the requirements
of the initial design and the actual operating conditions of the equipment in the wellbore.

Maximize Well Production.  If the well PI is greater than that for the original design, either
through data error or changing wellbore parameters, the ESP operating point can be increased
with a VSC. The HP rating of the motor limits the frequency increase. Remember, the HP load
from  the  pump  increases  with  the  cube  of  the  frequency  ratio,  and  the  HP  capability  of  the
motor increases directly to the speed ratio. Therefore, the designer must consider using an over-
sized motor if there is a potential need of higher flow rates.

Minimum Well Production.  If  the  well  PI  is  lower  than  that  for  the  original  design,  the
ESP  operating  point  can  be  decreased  with  the  VSC.  The  TDH  of  the  pump  is  the  limiting
factor  on  the  minimum  VSC  frequency.  The  produced  head  of  the  pump  decreases  with  the
square  of  the  frequency  ratio.  Therefore,  the  designer  must  consider  initially  oversizing  the
pump lift, if there is a potential for reduced-frequency operation.

There may also be cases where the ESP is operated at reduced frequency to reduce stresses
on  the  reservoir.  This  could  prevent  reservoir  damage  or  control  the  influx  of  unconsolidated
sand or frac materials because of sudden pressure differentials across the wellbore face.

ESP Electrical Isolation.  In a fixed-speed ESP application, the downhole motor is connect-
ed  directly  to  the  power  source  via  the  switchboard  contactor,  with  isolation  only  from  the
transformer and cable impedances. When a VSC is connected, automatic isolation occurs. The
input converter and output inverter are decoupled or isolated by the DC bus. Also, high-energy

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-665

transients open fuses or destroy solid-state semiconductor devices in the VSC instead of poten-
tially damaging the electrical components (motor, cable, electrical penetrators downhole).

Matching Surface Processes.  If  the  well  has  any  surface  processing  constraints, the  well-
head  flow  and/or  pressure  can  be  controlled  by  the  operating  frequency.  This  would  include
items such as tank level control and flowline pressure. Also, where multiple wells are manifold-
ed together and a constant flow rate is desired, any drop off in the rate of one or more wells
can be made up by an increase in speed to one or more wells.

Reduced Starting Stresses.  With a VSC, maximum current starting levels can be controlled.
At  startup,  the  frequency  to  produce  minimum  starting  torque  can  be  used  with  a  controlled
ramp up to operational speeds and power settings. This produces the optimum soft start. With
any added benefits and capabilities, there are also some cautions.

Increased Design Complexity.  The  ESP  application  design  becomes  much  more  complex
with the use of a VSC and, in all practicality, requires the use of a design software program to
do it properly.

Utility Interface.  When using a VSC, it is desirable not to feedback problems to the utility-
power system that could interact with other users on the system. The problems could include a
poor input power factor or high-input current distortion (harmonics). A poor power factor leads
to unnecessarily high-input current levels, thereby reducing the overall capacity to serve other
loads. Input current distortion, which is injected into the power system, can reduce the life of
other  equipment  connected  to  the  system  or  cause  electronic  devices  to  malfunction.  Ref.  18
gives  a  detailed  description  of  the  impact  of  VSCs  on  these  two  utility  concerns—how  each
VSC topology measures up and the method to control or diminish the impact. The guidelines
for the harmonic control of electrical power systems is provided in the Inst. of Electrical and
Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Stand. 519-1992.19

ESP Interface.  To fully achieve the benefits that a VSC can bring to an ESP application,
care must be taken to understand its impact on the downhole system and minimize any poten-
tial damaging influences. Several concerns include: excessive motor heating, increased voltage
stress, and maximization of motor torque performance.

Motor Heating.  Excessive motor heat can impact the motors performance and, in the long
term,  its  overall  life.  Operation  of  an  ESP  motor  with  a  VSC  causes  additional  heating  from
two  main  sources:  increased  winding  losses  because  of  higher  current  values  and  increased
core losses because of high-frequency components. Because all drives provide a modified sine
wave to the motor, it is distorted and contains other frequency components. Therefore, the total
current values of VSC operation over across-the-line values are higher. This increased current
level produces higher resistive losses in the motor windings, causing increased heat. Increased
core  losses,  because  of  the  changes  in  applied  terminal  voltage,  also  result  in  higher  motor
temperatures.  When  the  motor  core  experiences  changes  in  the  applied  terminal  voltage,  the
magnetic dipoles must realign to the new magnetic field present. Every time this happens, the
friction  of  the  motion  of  the  dipoles  releases  heat.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  minimize  the
subcycle voltage fluctuations at the motor terminals, although testing has shown heat rise to be
very small.

Increased Voltage Stress.  Even though the VSC is a buffer to input power surges or spikes,
their power inverters have the potential to generate higher peak voltages than those from a true
sinusoidal voltage source. This is because inverters are inherently digital in nature rather than
analog. Basically, the output can only change in discrete voltage steps and the transition from
step to step happens very rapidly. When this power is applied to the complex impedance of a
downhole ESP system, the natural response is a damped sine wave and the resultant ringing is
a normal response. On a VVI drive, the ringing has time to decay to zero between each verti-
cal  edge  of  the  waveform.  On  a  PWM  waveform,  the  vertical  edge  of  the  VSC  output
waveform can occur on top of the ringing of a previous vertical edge. Under the worst condi-

IV-666

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

tions,  this  effect  can  produce  peak  voltages  in  multiples  of  the  original  applied  voltage,  and
they can occur many times per cycle. This impact can be reduced by the application of filters
on the output side of the VSC and step-up transformer. Each PWM application should be re-
viewed  for  this  potential  condition,  but,  generally,  the  user  should  be  concerned  about  high-
voltage and -horsepower equipment and long lengths of cable.

Motor Torque.  The  ESP  motor  has  the  capability  to  deliver  a  large  percentage  of  its  full
torque capability over a wide speed range. It is important to examine the VSC’s capability to
deliver the necessary current to achieve required torque levels. Any of the VSC types can be
matched to the ESP motor when properly set up.

13.3.7 Accessories.  There are components provided by the ESP manufacturers and other sup-
pliers that provide additional mechanical and electrical protection, monitoring, or performance
enhancements. Installation of such components on all wells may not be justified, but their use
on key wells should be carefully considered. Several of these components are listed next.

Downhole Sensors.  Because the ESP operates in a hostile and confined environment, moni-
toring  how  it  operates  is  very  difficult.  Additionally,  it  is  also  difficult  to  find  sensors  and
electronics  that  operate  reliably  and  long  term  under  the  range  of  downhole  conditions  re-
quired.  The  ESP’s  reliability  or  run-life  is  directly  related  to  the  continual  monitoring  of  its
operating parameters and the wellbore conditions. Not only is this information critical to the run-
life, but it is also important for the evaluation of the application design of the ESP system in
the  hole.  This  evaluation  can  provide  guidance  on  possible  operational  changes  that  can  be
made to optimize the current system or the ESP design changes needed to optimize the applica-
tion.  If  ESP  systems  were  fully  instrumented  and  continuous  monitoring  systems  employed,
improvements in run-life and operational performance would be improved significantly. But, to
do this, the wellbore economics has to support it.

Sensors  are  available  for  mounting  internally  in  the  ESP  components  or  externally  as  an
attachment to the system. The signals from these sensors are communicated to the surface read-
out module by a separate instrument wire, “I”-wire, or by a signal imposed on one leg of the
ESP power cable.

Typically,  the  standard  ESP  application  only  provides  the  opportunity  to  monitor  surface
parameters,  such  as  three-phase  amps  and  volts,  wellhead  pressure,  and,  to  a  limited  extent,
flow  rate.  Therefore,  the  protection  and  evaluation  possibilities  are  reduced.  Today,  there  are
sensor packages available that provide measurement and monitoring of the following parameters.
Pump Intake or Casing Annulus Pressure.  This information provides wellbore static pressure
and the well flowing pressure at the production rate. If the measurement is sensitive enough, it
can also provide excellent well drawdown information.

Internal Motor Temperature.  This measurement is critical not only to the protection of the
motor but also in selecting the correct motor HP rating and lubricating oil for the application.
If a loaded motor is running close to its maximum temperature rating, some operational steps
could be implemented to reduce its load and temperature. Also, the next unit in the hole could
be derated or sized with a larger motor to run underloaded. Likewise, if the motor is running
cool, there are future opportunities to install a smaller motor. Additionally, sudden temperature
spikes  or  long-term  gradual  changes  are  an  indication  of  changing  equipment  performance  or
wellbore conditions, which may need evaluation.

Pump Discharge Pressure.  This parameter provides a reading on the discharge pressure of
the  pump.  This  reading  and  the  pump  intake  pressure  provide  a  measurement  of  the  TDH  of
the pump. Comparing this value to the design TDH, hydraulic performance of the pump can be
monitored and continually evaluated. Additionally, for gassy and/or viscous fluids, pump-perfor-
mance correction factors can be established or verified for that particular wellbore condition.

Pump Discharge Temperature.  This measurement provides the temperature of the discharge
fluid  from  the  pump.  The  production  fluid  is  heated  as  a  result  of  the  heat  rejected  by  the

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

motor and pump inefficiencies. The fluid heat rise through the pump can be used to calculate
the fluid volumetric increase and the viscosity change of the fluid. Once again, sudden spikes
or longer-term changes can provide warnings of potential problems.

Downhole Flow Rate.  Downhole  flowmeters  are  available  that  provide  flow-rate  measure-
ments from the pump discharge. This is an excellent tool, when compared to the surface flow
rate, for evaluating ESP performance and warning of potential problems. Because surface flow
rate  is  not  generally  continuously  monitored,  this  can  be  a  piece  of  information  for  enhanced
ESP  protection.  In  multiphase-fluid  (gassy)  applications,  the  selection  and  calibration  of  the
flowmeter is important because of the difficulty in accurately measuring this fluid.

Equipment Vibration.  There have been several applications that have used downhole vibra-
tion  sensors.  Unless  there  is  a  sudden  step  change  in  the  measurement,  this  parameter  is
difficult  to  evaluate.  There  is  a  possibility  that,  with  more  case  histories,  this  can  become  a
good evaluation tool.

ESP Packers.  Typically, ESP packers are used when there is a requirement or a need for it
to be set above the ESP system (Fig. 13.35). Their use normally prevents venting free gas up
the annulus, unless a vented packer is used. Packers can be shallow set or deep set, depending
on  design  requirements  or  regulations.  ESP  packers  have  an  electrical  power  cable  feed-
through feature added to the normal wellbore packer functions. A bore for an electrical feed-
through mandrel is provided. Mating connectors are attached to the cable from the surface and
another to the cable below the packer for connecting to the mandrel. This design allows for the
maintenance  of  a  pressure  barrier,  while  still  allowing  for  electrical  power  communication  to
the motor.

Packers are used with ESP systems when there is a need to isolate the annular area above
the ESP and/or provide a positive barrier between the pressurized wellbore fluid and the area
above the packer. Isolating the area above the packer is done to segregate two separate zones
or prevent or reduce the rate of wellbore fluid corrosion damage to the casing. With a deep-set
packer, operational precautions must be observed to prevent damage to the ESP system. With a
deep-set  packer,  the  volume  contained  between  the  packer  and  pump  intake  is  usually  small.
Upon startup, the ESP can evacuate this volume quickly, causing a sudden drop from wellbore
static to flowing pressure. This causes sudden decompression to the cable and internal volumes
of the seal-chamber section and motor, especially if they have been saturated with solution gas.
This  decompression  can  cause  expansion  and  insulation  damage  to  the  cable.  If  it  is  severe
enough,  it  can  result  in  extensive  expulsion  of  motor  oil  from  the  seal-chamber  section  and
motor, possibly rupturing elastomer seals and bags.

ESP Wellheads.  The wellhead is designed to support the weight of the subsurface equip-
ment  and  to  maintain  the  surface  annular  control  of  the  well.  It  is  selected  on  the  basis  of
casing and tubing size, maximum recommended load, surface pressure, and the power cable pass-
through requirements. There are two cable pass-through designs. The first uses the compression
of elastomer grommets around the power cable jacket to provide a low-pressure seal. It is used
in many areas where the well has a zero to low gas/oil ratio (GOR). In areas where the annular
pressure  can  be  high  or  where  safety  requires  a  positive  pressure  barrier,  the  electrical  feed-
through  mandrel  design  is  used.  A  feed-through  mandrel  mounts  in  a  cavity  of  the  wellhead,
sealing  the  annular  pressure  and  providing  electrical  connection  points  above  and  below  the
wellhead. Mating electrical connectors (pigtails) are spliced to the upper end of the downhole
power cable and to the surface power cable.

Centralizers/Protectorilizers.  Centralizers are sometimes used when the ESP is installed in
a deviated wellbore or into a tapered-string casing. Its function, when used in a deviated well-
bore,  is  to  be  a  contact  point  with  the  casing  and  allow  the  ESP  unit  to  have  some  standoff
clearance.  They  are  typically  located  at  the  bottom  of  the  ESP  unit  and,  in  some  cases,  at
points  along  its  length  or  at  the  discharge  tubing.  They  have  to  be  constructed  so  as  not  to

IV-668

restrict  the  flow  by  the  motor  and  to  the  pump  intake.  Generally,  they  are  designed  with  at
least three radial fins attached to either tubing, for the top and bottom unit or to metal straps,
which  can  be  attached  around  the  ESP  body.  Centralizers  are  also  used  when  an  ESP  is  de-
ployed into a tapered-string casing. Its function is to help guide the unit into and through the
casing step to reduce the chance of mechanical damage. It is normally a finned configuration
with the bottom end tapered or bull nosed.

Protectorilizers are used to protect the power cable, MLE, and any small hydraulic or elec-
trical  communication  line  from  mechanical  damage  in  deviated  or  restricted-clearance  casing.
Along  the  ESP  unit,  they  are  normally  attached  at  the  unit’s  flanged  connection  points  and
either cradle or cover the MLE and communication lines, so they become the rub points. Pro-

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-669

tectorilizers are clamped or strapped onto the production tubing for the same purpose. They are
usually at the coupling points and midjoint. They also provide axial support to the power cable
and replace the cable bands.

Check/Drain Tubing Valves.  A check valve is used in the production tubing string, general-
ly two to three joints above the pump discharge, to maintain a full column of fluid above the
pump. This may be desired to eliminate the time it takes to raise the fluid from its static fluid
level to the surface (“pump-up time”) or the protective shutdown time for fluid fallback. Nor-
mally,  each  time  an  ESP  cycles  off,  the  fluid  falls  back  from  the  surface  to  its  static  fluid
level. On restart, it again has to lift the fluid from its static point to the surface. Holding the
fluid  in  the  tubing  can  eliminate  this.  Also,  when  the  fluid  is  falling  back,  it  causes  the  de-
energized pump to spin backwards. If power is applied during this period, damage to the ESP
could  result.  Generally,  a  backspin  sensor  or  restart  timer  is  used  on  the  motor  controller  for
premature restart protection.

The  use  of  a  check  valve  should  be  reviewed  in  gassy  or  high-GOR  wells  and  wells  that
produce significant solids. In a gassy well, when the unit shuts down, a gas cap can form un-
der  the  check  valve  and  be  held  there  by  the  fluid  column  above  the  check.  If  the  gas  cap
volume is large enough to extend down to or below the pump intake, the pump will be imme-
diately  gas  locked  and  unable  to  pick  up  a  prime.  When  there  are  solids  (especially  sand)
entrained in the production fluid and the ESP is shut down, the solids fall back in the produc-
tion tubing and settle either on the check valve or into the pump discharge. This could either
plug  the  tubing  above  the  check  valve  or  the  pump.  Therefore,  the  use  of  a  check  valve  in
fluids with solids should be reviewed.

Motor Shroud/Recirculation Systems.  Shrouds, as shown in Fig. 13.36, are used to redirect
the  flow  of  production  fluid  around  the  ESP  system.  The  shroud  assembly  is  made  up  of  a
jacket  (a  length  of  casing  or  pipe),  a  hanging  clamp  and  sealing  retainer  for  the  top,  and  a
centralizer for the bottom. The jacket dimensions are selected on the basis of shroud location
relative to the production source and the function of the shroud. But, at a minimum, the shroud
should extend to below the bottom of the motor. The shroud ID has to allow for the insertion
of the ESP with flow clearance to allow for proper cooling velocities without choking or exces-
sive pressure drop to the flow. The shroud OD must have sufficient clearance with the casing
ID  to  assure  reliable  deployment  and  proper  flow  from  the  well  perforations  to  the  pump  in-
take. Fluid pressure drop in this annular area, similar to the shroud-to-ESP annular area, can be
significant enough to impact the pump intake conditions.

The  most  commonly  used  shroud  configuration  is  shown  in  the  left  graphic  of  the  same
figure. In this configuration, the ESP is set below perforations and the shroud directs the pro-
duction flow down and back up by the motor for cooling. Otherwise, the fluid would be pulled
down to the pump intake, leaving the motor in stagnate fluid with heat rise concerns. The pur-
pose of setting below perforations is to increase the production rate for the same pump intake
pressure or to serve as a simple reverse-flow gas-separation system. In the gas-separation appli-
cation, the configuration depends on the free gas flowing from the perforations taking the path
of least resistance—up the open casing annulus, instead of down to the bottom of the shroud.
One caution, in this configuration, is not to use a gas-separation intake on the pump. The vent-
ed  free  gas  from  the  separation  intake  would  recycle  to  the  bottom  of  the  shroud,  increasing
the free-gas ratio to the pump and decreasing the cooling of the motor.

This configuration is not recommended for setting above perforations in an application with
free gas. But where the ESP and casing annular area is large, creating too low a cooling flow,
a shroud can be used to increase the production-fluid cooling velocity. For those special cases
of setting above perforations and the problem of free gas, an inverted shroud (right graphic in
the  figure)  has  proved  successful  in  separating  free  gas  from  the  fluid  that  is  directed  back
down to the pump intake.

IV-670

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 13.36—ESP-motor shroud systems (after Centrilift9).

In  wells  that  have  a  diameter  restriction  because  of  tapered  casing,  liners,  or  screens,  a
stinger  can  be  attached  to  the  bottom  of  the  shroud  to  position  the  intake  below  perforations
and down into the restriction. A stinger is a section of tubing, usually smaller in diameter than
the  shroud,  which  is  attached  to  the  bottom  of  the  shroud  and  provides  fluid  communication
from the wellbore to the interior of the shroud. This configuration is shown in the center graph-
ic of the figure. The pressure drop through the stinger must be calculated to check for possible
choking of the pump and also for an increase in the free gas liberated, causing gas interference
issues with the pump and cooling issues with the motor.

Screens and Filters.  Screens and filters are used with ESP systems to prohibit the flow of
large  solids  into  the  pump  intake.  In  one  configuration  (shown  on  the  intake  of  Fig.  13.2),  a
mesh screen or perforated metal sheet is wrapped or mounted over the pump intake ports. The
mesh or perforation size has to be small enough not to allow the passage of large particles, but
large  enough  not  to  cause  a  flow  restriction.  The  size  of  particle  that  must  be  screened  is  a
function of the flow-passageway clearances through the pump. If a shroud is used, a screen can
be used to cover the open intake area at the bottom of the shroud.

Filters  have  also  been  used  on  ESP  applications.  The  simplest  method  is  to  use  a  motor
shroud with a stinger, shown in the center graphic of Fig. 13.36. The stinger is sealed at the
end,  perorated  along  its  length,  and  a  filter  element  or  gravel  pack  is  inserted  into  or  around

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-671

the stinger. The production fluid then has to pass through the stinger filter prior to entering the
pump intake.

Several  cautions  must  be  mentioned  if  screens  or  filters  are  used.  The  open  area  of  the
screen must be several times larger than that of the open area of the pump intake ports. This
allows for proper flow without choking when, not if, the screen starts building up debris and
plugging. This is also the case with the filters. Also, remember that the separated debris has to
go  somewhere  and  that  is  generally  in  the  rathole  below  the  ESP.  The  rathole  must  be  large
enough to hold the amount of debris expected over a period of time. This is because if it starts
building up on the ESP, it can cause motor heat problems, eventual complete plugging of the
intake  ports,  and  difficulty  in  pulling  the  unit.  Plugged  screens  and  filters  may  cause  severe
pump and motor problems, if not designed and applied correctly.

Y-Tool  or  Bypass.    The  Y-tool  allows  for  treating  or  working  below  the  ESP  through  a
bypass. A configuration of the system is shown in Fig. 13.37. The “Y” is somewhat of a mis-
nomer  because  it  is  just  an  offset  layout.  The  bypass  tube  is  on  axial  centerline  with  the
production  tubing  string.  This  allows  the  work  string  to  have  a  straight  shot  through  and  out
the  bypass  tube  from  the  production  tube.  Typical  sizes  for  these  bypass  tubes  are  1.995  to
2.441  in.  (50.67  to  62.00  mm)  ID.  The  ESP  is  connected  to  the  offset  path  of  the  crossover
head and hangs parallel to the bypass tube. Clamps secure the ESP and bypass tube together.
During normal operation of the ESP, the bypass is sealed off with a blanking plug seated in a
landing nipple, set just below the Y-tool head or by a flapper valve in the cross-over head. The
blanking plug can be set and retrieved with wireline or coiled tubing. Y-tool systems are pro-
vided and best suited for 7-in. and larger casing applications.

13.3.8 Optional ESP Configurations.  What  has  been  described  up  to  this  point  is  the  stan-
dard  ESP  configuration.  It  has  the  pump,  seal-chamber  section,  and  motor  attached  to  the
production tubing, in this order from top down. In some wellbore completions and unique ESP
applications, the arrangement and configuration of the system is modified. Some of these appli-
cations are listed next.

Inverted Bottom-Intake ESP.  An inverted-unit configuration has the motor on top, attached
to the tubing string; seal-chamber section underneath the motor; and the pump on bottom (Fig.
13.38). For a bottom-intake design, the production fluid is drawn in the intake ports located at
the very bottom of the ESP system and discharged out of ports located just below the connec-
tion to the seal-chamber section. Because the discharged production fluid cannot flow through
the seal-chamber section and motor, it has to exit into the casing or liner annulus and flow past
these  units.  Once  above  the  motor,  it  can  continue  flowing  up  the  annulus  or  be  ported  back
into  the  production  tubing  string.  Additionally,  the  casing  annulus  communication  flow  path,
between the intake and discharge ports, has to be sealed to prevent recirculation. Generally, the
intake is stung into the casing packer to seal this path. This configuration is typically used for
applications in which the intake needs to be located as low as possible, cavern or mine applica-
tions,  annular  flow  designs,  coiled  tubing  with  internal  power  cable,  or  cable-deployed  ESP
systems.

The ESP design has to be modified from the standard unit design. In this application, the
seal-chamber  section  and  motor  have  to  equalize  with  the  high-pressure  discharge  conditions.
This  requires  that  all  the  sealing  and  breathing  paths  be  able  to  handle  the  sudden  high-pres-
sure, high-velocity startup and shutdown surges.

Inverted Bottom-Discharge ESP.  This design is configured the same as the inverted bottom-
intake  ESP  system  with  the  exception  that  the  pump  stages  are  inverted  to  pump  down  (Fig.
13.39).  Once  again,  the  intake  and  discharge  fluid  communication  path  in  the  casing  annulus
has to be closed. Generally, the pump discharge, on the bottom of the ESP assembly, is stung
into an isolation packer. The wellbore production fluid is transferred from above this packer to

IV-672

below under high enough pressure to inject into the lower formation. This configuration is typi-
cally used for injection of water into a disposal zone.

Special designs that incorporate downhole hydrocyclone separators have been used to sepa-
rate  some  of  the  water  from  the  wellbore  fluid  (Fig.  13.40).  In  this  case,  the  reduced-water-
content oil is pumped to the surface, and a significant portion of the deoiled water is injected
into a disposal zone.

Dual ESP.  A  dual-ESP  configuration  is  one  in  which  two  or  more  ESP  systems  are  in-
stalled concurrently in the same wellbore. One configuration uses a Y-tool with the first ESP
attached, as described in the previous Y-tool section, and a second ESP system attached to the
bottom of the bypass tube or to another Y-tool bypass head (Fig. 13.41). For a triple system,
another Y-tool is attached to the bottom of the first bypass tube, allowing for a third unit to be
incorporated. Each ESP system requires its own cable and control system.

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-673

Fig. 13.38—Inverted ESP [after Centrilift Graphics, Claremore, Oklahoma (1994)].

A second configuration has the first ESP system connected to the production tubing with a
sealed  shroud  or  can  around  the  entire  unit  (Fig.  13.42).  The  next  ESP  system  is  attached  to
the bottom of the first unit’s shroud. In this configuration, the lower unit’s discharge feeds the
upper unit’s intake so as to set up stepped fluid pressurization.

Parallel Production.  A Y-tool, dual ESP system can be used for high-flow-rate applications
in which the required HP is too great for one unit or it is desirable to split the total HP require-
ment into two or more segments. In this case, all the units are operating and discharging into
the production tubing at a common pressure, with the total flow rate being a summation of the
flow of each individual unit.

Series Production.  A  dual-ESP  system  can  also  be  used  for  high  total-developed-head  re-
quirements. This is where the lift requirement or pressure increase across the pump is beyond
the equipment design limitations. By connecting the ESP systems in series, large pressure in-
creases  can  be  achieved  for  the  desired  flow  rate  while  staying  within  each  individual  unit’s
HP and burst-pressure limitations (Fig. 13.42).

IV-674

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 13.39—Bottom-discharge ESP [after Centrilift Graphics, Claremore, Oklahoma (1994)].

Backup Unit.  This concept also utilizes the Y-tool configuration, but only one ESP system
operates at a time. The other units are held in backup until the operating unit either fails or is
shutdown voluntarily. To prevent recirculation flow through the nonoperating unit, a plug has
to  be  set  in  the  Y-tool  flow  path.  These  systems  are  used  in  high-cost  workover  areas  to  re-
duce the total number of interventions and operating costs.

Booster ESP.  The  ESP  can  also  be  used  as  a  pressure  boost  system  for  surface  applica-
tions.  They  can  handle  a  wide  variety  of  fluid  conditions  and  do  not  have  the  pressure
pulsation attribute associated with positive-displacement-type pumps.

Canned System.  This  configuration  is  basically  an  ESP  installed  in  a  shallow  well  or  can
(Fig. 13.43). The low-pressure fluid is fed into the can annulus, and the ESP boosts the pres-
sure.  It  is  used  primarily  for  flowline  or  pipeline  pressure  boost  and  for  fluid  disposal  or
injection purposes.

Surface Horizontal System.  This configuration utilizes an ESP centrifugal pump driven by a
surface electric motor, engine drive, or other primary mover. It is generally mounted on a skid

for  stability  and  alignment  (Fig.  13.44).  It  can  provide  a  nonpulsating  flow  and  a  wide  flow
range with the use of a variable-speed drive.

Pipeline-Insert System.  In this configuration, the ESP is inserted into a parallel section of
piping.  Fluid  can  then  either  flow  directly  through  the  pipeline  or  can  be  valved  to  bypass
through the pump leg section for pressure boosting.

Through-Tubing-Conveyed ESP.  In  applications  where  pump  wear  and  intervention  costs
are a major concern, a through-tubing-deployed pump is an option. The configuration is shown
in  Fig.  13.45.  The  motor  and  seal-chamber  section  are  deployed  on  the  bottom  of  a  tubing
string. The power cable is connected to the motor and deployed with the tubing, locating and
protecting it in the casing/tubing annulus. The pump section is then deployed by a work string,

typically  wireline  or  coiled  tubing,  and  latched  onto  the  seal-chamber  section.  Thereafter,
workovers,  because  of  pump  issues,  can  be  done  at  a  lower  expense  with  wireline  or  coiled-
tubing rigs, instead of regular jointed-tubing workover rigs.

13.3.9 Harsh-Environment Options.  ESPs  are  typically  thrust  into  more  difficult  and  harsh
wellbore environments as production conditions change. Harsh or severe conditions include mul-
tiphase fluids  or  high  GOR  wells,  fluids  with  abrasive particles, viscous  fluids,  high-tempera-
ture  wellbores,  corrosive  fluids,  and  scale  and  asphaltenes.  With  this  movement,  the  demands
on  the  equipment  design  functions,  materials,  and  operational  processes  increase.  The  run-life
of the entire system can be affected if proper designs for these applications are not used.

Multiphase Flow.20–25  The presence of free gas in the produced fluid does affect the perfor-
mance  of  the  ESP  pump.  Generally,  a  pump  is  designed  to  handle  incompressible  fluids
(liquids), and a compressor is designed to handle compressible fluids (gases). The performance
or  efficiency  of  both  will  suffer  if  they  are  required  to  handle  a  multiphase  fluid  (liquid  and
free gas). Typically, as the amount of free gas to total volume of the pumped fluid increases,
the pump-stage head and flow both deteriorate.20

Performance Variables.  The amount of free gas that an ESP pump can handle is a function
of the following variables: pump-stage geometry, operating point of the pump stage, control by
a fixed-speed or variable-speed drive, pump-intake flowing pressure, and wellbore geometry.

Pump-Stage Geometry.  The  gas  handling  capability  of  a  centrifugal  pump  stage  increases
with flow rate or stage specific speed—a nondimensional design parameter. In other words, as
the  stage  style  moves  from  radial  to  mixed  flow  (Fig.  13.11),  the  gas-handling  capability  in-
creases.

IV-680

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 13.46—Modified Turpin correlation (data from Ref. 24) [after Centrilift Graphics, Claremore, Oklahoma
(1995)].

Pump Operating Point.  The most stable operating region for a pump stage on gassy fluid is
from the maximum recommended flow rate back to its BEP. As the flow rate moves from the
BEP toward the minimum recommended operating point, the potential for gas interference af-
fecting pump performance is increased.

VSC Operation.  The VSC allows for some additional flexibility and reduction in unit shut-
downs  that  are  related  to  pump  gas  locking.  Tests  have  shown  that  the  pump  gas-handling
capability  increases  slightly  with  increasing  speed.  If  the  pump  load  decreases  and  the  motor
amps drop, indicating an initiation of gas lock, the VSC can be programmed to speed up for a
short period to attempt to clear the gas-lock situation. If it clears and the load picks back up,
the VSC would then return to its set operating frequency. If it does not clear, the unit would
then shut down on an underload situation and restart on the time out delay.

Pump-Intake Pressure.  The gas handling capability of the pump is very sensitive to pump-
intake  pressure.  An  empirical  correlation24  for  the  relationship  of  the  amount  of  free  gas  a
pump  can  handle  and  the  fluids  flowing  pressure  was  established  from  numerous  tests  on  a
variety  of  pump  stages.  A  graphical  representation  of  this  correlation  is  shown  in  Fig.  13.46.
The area under the curve represents stable operation, and the area above indicates potential gas-
interference and -locking regions.

Wellbore Geometry.  The  natural  and  mechanical  separation  of  free  gas  from  the  flowing
fluid is a function of the wellbore geometry. The annular area between the casing and the ESP
unit and the fluid flow rate determines the flowing fluid velocity. The natural annular gas sepa-
ration  decreases  as  the  velocity  increases.  Also,  whether  the  casing  is  horizontal,  inclined,  or
vertical determines the flow regime of the multiphase fluid and influences its natural separation
characteristics.  The  efficiency  of  annular  separation  is  still  unknown,  and  additional  research
must be done in this area.

Optimal ESP Configurations for Gas Handling.  Optimal ESP configurations for gassy appli-
cations are listed next. Depending on the severity of the application, they can be used individu-
ally or in multiple combinations.

Tapered Pumps.  Tapered  pumps  utilize  several  different  sets  of  pump  stages  in  the  same
pump housing or pump string. Generally, the first section of stages is mixed-flow style because
they can handle a higher percentage of free gas. As the gassy fluid is pressurized through each
of  these  first  stages,  the  total  fluid  volume  decreases  because  of  the  compression  of  the  free
gas.  When  the  flow  rate  nears  the  BEP  flow  rate  of  these  stages,  a  second  set  of  stages  is
selected. Generally, a good design can be accomplished with two or three sets of stages in the
taper.

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-681

Mechanical Separation.  The  vortex  and  rotary  separation  intake  components,  which  were
discussed  in  the  pump  section,  are  used  here  to  add  centrifugal  separation  to  the  gassy  fluid
that  enters  the  intake  section.  Because  there  are  so  many  variables  that  affect  their  effective-
ness  or  efficiency,  the  manufacturers  should  be  contacted  for  separation  efficiency  values  or
guidelines. These units can also be used in tandem to accomplish series separation.

Motor Shrouds.  Not only can motor shrouds be used to raise the velocity of the production
fluid by the motor for increased cooling, they can also be used to assist with annular separa-
tion of the free gas in the produced fluid. The different styles and their uses were discussed in
the section on motor shrouds and recirculation systems.

Recirculation Pump.  In a completion scheme where there is insufficient clearance to run a
shrouded  unit  below  perforations,  a  recirculation  pump  can  be  used.  A  recirculation  pump
bleeds a small portion of the pumped fluid off and circulates it down below the motor by a small-
diameter hydraulic tube. This establishes a small flow in the rathole where the motor is set. By
properly  designing  the  bleed  flow,  cooling  flow  by  the  motor  can  be  maintained.  Since  the
perforations are above the unit and pump intake, natural annular gas separation can be maximized.
Although there are guidelines from the manufacturers for ESP configurations for gassy ap-
plications,  the  area  still  remains  somewhat  of  a  black  art.  Since  there  are  so  many  variables
that affect an ESP’s ability to perform in a gassy application, the best method is for the opera-
tor  to  select  what  they  feel  is  the  best  solution,  based  on  prior  field  experience  or  the
manufacturer’s guidelines. Once the equipment is operational, field tests on each wellbore can
be conducted to test that specific ESP configuration under those specific wellbore conditions.

Abrasive Slurries.26,27  The  standard  ESP  pump  does  not  tolerate  abrasive  particles  in  the
pump  fluid.  The  amount  of  tolerance  is  directly  related  to  the  aggressiveness  of  the  solids  or
sand.  The  aggressiveness  is  a  function  of  the  percentage  of  the  solid  substance  that  is  harder
than the material of the pump components, the size and shape of the particles, and the concen-
tration of solids in the fluid. The most aggressive solids are those with a high solids concentra-
tion ( > 1% by weight ), a large percentage of the solids sample being quartz (harder than the
base stage and bearing material), a majority of the sample under a 100-mesh sieve size (able to
get into the bearing and sealing areas easier and faster), or quartz grain shapes that are angular
or  barbed.  On  the  other  extreme,  there  are  cases  where  very  round,  smooth,  soft  sands  are
relatively benign to the operation of the pump.

Performance Impact of Abrasives.  There are three types of wear that impact the pump stage

and its performance. They are listed next and prioritized in order of importance or impact.

Radial Wear.  As the slurry wears the radial-support bushing system of the pump, it loses
its  lateral  stability.  This  allows  the  rotating  parts  to  start  interfering  with  the  stationary  parts.
Vibration increases, and it starts impacting the top of the seal section where the first mechani-
cal  shaft  face  seal  is  located.  Once  vibration  and  radial  movement  start  to  influence  the  face
seal, leakage starts across the sealing face. This initiates a path for the well fluid to progress
toward the motor.

Downthrust Wear.  On the floating-style stages, the abrasive slurry migrates into the down-
thrust bearing pad area of the pump stage. The stationary diffuser thrust pad starts boring into
the  impeller  thrust  washer  area.  Once  it  breaks  through  the  lower  shroud  of  the  impeller,  the
impeller loses part of its work to recirculation flow. As the diffuser pad bores further into the
impeller  passageway,  it  also  blocks  a  portion  of  the  impeller  flow  path,  thus  restricting  the
remaining flow.

Erosion Wear.  As with any abrasive-slurry flow along a twisting path, erosion wear takes
place. Although it is not usually associated with the failure of the pump, it is a potential failure
mode  and  a  concern,  especially  when  modifications  have  been  made  to  the  pump  to  address
the radial and downthrust wear modes. Erosion wear not only damages the stage pieces, it also

IV-682

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

wears  any  surface  with  which  it  comes  into  contact.  Severe  cases  have  resulted  in  the  wear
perforating the pump or production-tubing walls and dropping units in the well.

Optional ESP Configurations for Abrasives.  Depending  on  the  severity  of  the  application,

the following design options can be used individually or in combination.

Compression Pumps.  For  many  years,  this  was  the  answer  for  abrasive  applications.  In  a
compression  or  “fixed-impeller”  pump,  the  impellers  are  fixed  to  the  shaft  or  stacked  hub  to
hub so there is no axial movement. With all the impellers fixed relative to the shaft, the whole
impeller stack can be raised slightly so that it does not run into contact with the downthrust or
upthrust pads on the diffuser. This pump design eliminates the downthrust wear mode. When it
is used in conjunction with hardened journal bearings, it also addresses radial wear problems.
There  are  several  issues  with  compression  pumps.  First,  they  are  very  difficult  to  assemble
properly.  Because  an  ESP  pump  is  a  very  long,  multistaged  assembly,  it  is  very  difficult  to
locate  all  of  the  impellers  and  still  have  the  needed  minimum  shaft  axial  movement.  Also,
now,  the  thrust  of  each  impeller  is  transferred  to  the  shaft  and  is  added  to  the  normal  shaft
thrust produced by the discharge pressure on the top area of the shaft. The thrust bearing in the
seal-chamber section is required to carry this additional thrust. Additionally, as the sealing ar-
eas  of  the  pump  stage  wear,  the  downthrust  also  increases.  Therefore,  the  selection  of  the
proper  thrust  bearing  is  critical,  and  the  anticipated  thrust  must  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of
the maximum thrust seen from worn stages.

Thrust and Radial Protection.  In this modification, the base material in the radial and down-
thrust  areas  of  the  stage  is  replaced  with  inserts  of  hardened  materials.  The  materials  are
usually tungsten or silicon carbides, or ceramics. This results in a pump with both radial and
downthrust protection but is built in a floater style.

Erosion Protection.  Currently, this area is under development, but some coatings, heat treat-

ments, surface hardening, and hard-material liners have had limited-to-moderate success.

Generally,  the  abrasive  production  fluid  does  not  impact  the  motor  and  seal-chamber  sec-
tion.  There  could  be  minor  erosion  worries  because  of  the  flow  velocities  of  the  production
fluid by the outside surfaces of both units. Also, if the top shaft’s mechanical face seal in the
seal-chamber section is  exposed  and  operates in  the  production fluid,  hardened  stationary and
rotating seal faces are recommended.

Viscous Crude and Emulsions.  ESPs are also used to lift viscous fluids, commonly referred
to as heavy and extra-heavy crudes. Viscosity is defined as the resistance of a fluid to move-
ment as a result of internal friction. Resistance causes additional internal losses in a centrifugal
pump. The increases in internal losses of a centrifugal pump affect each performance parameter.
Performance Impact of Fluid Viscosity.  Effect on Flow Capacity. Flow capacity of a given
pump stage diminishes rapidly with a relatively small increase in viscosity. The rate of correc-
tion  tends  to  moderate  as  viscosity  continues  to  increase.  The  amount  of  correction  is  also
dependent on stage geometry, and the decrease in capacity is more exaggerated for radial flow
stages.

Effect on Head.  The  total  dynamic  head  at  the  BEP  diminishes  on  a  moderate  curve  as
viscosity increases. It is affected to a lesser extent than flow capacity. The head at zero flow
remains  relatively  constant.  Fig.  13.47  shows  various  head  vs.  flow-rate  curves  for  an  ESP
pump stage rated for about 2,100 B/D on water.

Effect on Horsepower.  BHP  increases  rapidly  with  increasing  viscosity  but  tends  to  level

off because of diminishing flow rate and total dynamic head (Fig. 13.48).

Effect on Efficiency.  Efficiency  decreases  in  proportion  to  the  changes  in  flow  capacity,

TDH, and HP, in terms of Eq. 13.1 (Fig. 13.49).

There are several published methods for estimating the effect of viscosity on the head, flow
rate, and BHP of a centrifugal pump. These “standard” correction factors are usually not accu-
rate for the specific small-diameter, multistage design of ESP pumps. Therefore, most manufac-

turers  have  established  corrections  through  testing  for  each  pump  stage  type  in  their  product
line.  These  correction  factors  are  based  on  dead-oil  viscosity  values  for  the  fluid  at  pump-in-
take  conditions.  When  applying  these  corrections  to  the  pump,  the  following  should  also  be
considered.

Effects  of  Gas.    When  gas  saturates  into  the  crude,  it  reduces  the  viscosity  of  the  fluid.
Some amount of gas is helpful in reducing fluid viscosity, but an excessive amount of free gas
is disruptive to well fluid production. Gas tends to migrate out of highly-viscous fluid slowly.
Therefore, a higher percentage of gas tends to pass through the pump with the produced well
fluid. In an application with gas, the designer must be aware of two viscosity values. The first
is the dead-oil viscosity. This is the viscosity of the crude at dead or completely degassed con-
ditions. The other is the live-oil viscosity. It is the apparent viscosity of the gas-saturated crude
and the viscosity that affects the pump performance in a well with gas. There are several dead-

homa (2003)].

oil  and  saturated-oil  viscosity  correlations  that  can  be  used  during  the  design  process.  The
correlation selection should be based on modeling of the actual wellbore performance.

Effects of Temperature.  Temperature has a dramatic effect on the viscosity of the crude oil.
Therefore, it is critical to the ESP design process that the fluid temperature in the wellbore at
the  pump  setting  depth  is  known.  This  determines  the  fluid  viscosity  and  pump-performance
correction factors at the first pump stage. Additionally, the inefficiency of the pump results in
additional heat loss to the fluid and surrounding wellbore. This incremental elevation in temper-
ature from stage to stage through the pump moderates the impact of the fluid viscosity on the
total pump performance. Therefore, the designer should, at a minimum, use an average viscosi-
ty  for  the  fluid  through  the  pump  for  sizing  applications.  A  more  accurate  method  is  to
calculate  the  performance  on  a  stage-by-stage  basis,  using  the  fluid  input  conditions  to  each
stage. Most design software programs use this method.

Effects of Water.  With  the  incursion  of  water  or  brine  into  the  wellbore,  the  viscosity  of
the  oil/water  mixture  can  increase,  sometimes  dramatically  when  emulsions  occur.  The  shear
forces  on  the  fluid  mixture,  as  it  flows  through  the  formation,  perforations,  or  centrifugal
pump, can cause an emulsion. Because thousands of molecular structures with different chemi-
cal  and  physical  properties  exist  in  crude  oils,  it  is  virtually  impossible  to  predict  viscosity
characteristics on the basis of oil and water cuts. A default viscosity correction factor for emul-
sions,  referenced  in  many  petroleum  engineering  textbooks  and  references,  has  been  used  for
many  years  with  questionable  results.28  The  correction  factor  is  shown  graphically  in  Fig.
13.50.  The  curve  provides  for  a  progressive  increase  in  the  viscosity  multiplier,  up  to  15,  as
the water cut increases. It then drops to 1, indicating the emulsion has inverted or become water-
wetted. Use of this correction factor in viscous applications has indicated that it is too severe.
Recent work has shown that because of the complexity of emulsion characteristics, it is best to
run carefully controlled baseline laboratory tests on reservoir crude and brine samples to devel-
op an emulsion correction curve.29

ESP  Options  for  Fluid  Viscosity.    Several  options  are  available  for  improving  the  perfor-

mance of the ESP pump when applied to viscous crudes.

Dilution.  Some success has been achieved with diluent injection. In this process, a lighter
crude  or  refined  product,  such  as  diesel,  is  injected  from  the  surface  via  a  separate  hydraulic
line to a point below the ESP or directly into the pump intake. This effectively cuts the viscos-

ity of the wellbore fluids. The amount of injected diluent depends on the desired final mixture
viscosity.  This  type  of  viscosity  reduction  also  reduces  the  surface  flowline  losses,  which  re-
duces the required wellhead pressure or the need for diluent injection at the wellhead. Using a
diluent fluid is an effective, but expensive, approach.

Temperature Increase.  The temperature of the reservoir or near-wellbore area can be artifi-
cially raised to make the viscous crude more mobile. The most successful method for adding
heat  has  been  through  steam  injection  or  soaking,  although  trials  have  been  made  with  resis-
tive, induction, and microwave technologies. This reduces the viscosity of the crude, but it also
raises concerns in high-temperature operations.

Chemical  Injection.    Viscosity-reduction  and  emulsion-breaking  chemicals  can  be  injected
from  the  surface  by  hydraulic  injection  lines.  This  impacts  the  fluids  in  the  annulus  and
through the pump but not very far back into the reservoir.

Water Injection.  When emulsions are encountered through a certain water-cut range, addi-
tional water can be injected to increase the water cut of the produced fluid, moving it out of
the high-viscosity correction area. Field trials on this concept were conducted in the mid-1980s
and were successful in reducing the fluid viscosity and increasing the ESP performance.

High Temperature.  Another trend has been the application of ESPs into higher-temperature
reservoirs. Typically, these are reservoirs that are either deeper or artificially heated. Standard
ESP systems are commonly applied to well ambient temperatures of 250°F (121°C). Even with
a  velocity  greater  than  1  ft/sec,  the  temperature  rise  above  ambient  conditions  will  be  about
50°F (10°C) for water and 90°F (32°C) for oil—higher if fluids contain gas.

Systems that have minor modifications or optional features are applied in ambient tempera-
tures up to 350°F (177°C). Additional research and field testing is being done on systems that
operate in ambient temperatures above 350°F. For these units, the motor and seal-chamber sec-
tion  have  the  most  significant  design  changes.  The  design  areas  of  concern  in  the  motor
include the insulation system, mechanical bearing system, and the internal lubrication and cool-
ing  system.  The  seal-chamber  section  modifications  include  the  mechanical  journal  and  thrust
bearing systems, internal lubricating system, and, in positive-barrier styles, the elastomeric bag.
Also, the selection of a power cable rated for elevated temperature service is critical.

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Since the early 1990s, the focus on the application of submersible motors in high-tempera-
ture  wells  has  not  been  entirely  on  the  ambient  wellbore  temperature,  but  rather  the  internal
operating temperature of the motor. This is because, even in what would be considered a rela-
tively cool well, a misapplied design can possibly operate at dangerously high internal operat-
ing temperatures. Most of the ESP application software programs calculate the expected motor
operating temperatures, or the manufacturer can be contacted to provide this information. The
calculation of the motor operating temperature involves many variables, which were mentioned
in the previous motor-heat-rise section. Historically, this calculation has been made at the stabi-
lized design operating point of the motor. Recently, new computerized programs have allowed
the ESP system operating conditions to be dynamically modeled from the static startup condi-
tion to the stabilized-flow operating point. This has allowed the designer to identify potentially
dangerous transient operating conditions and to provide for options to eliminate or reduce their
impact.

If the operator is operating an ESP at elevated motor operating conditions, it is suggested
that  a  downhole  motor-temperature  monitoring  system  be  run.  This  monitor  provides  warning
of  any  high-temperature  excursions  of  the  downhole  system  so  that  remedial  action  is  taken
before potential catastrophic damage occurs.

Corrosion.  The application expansion of ESPs into more corrosive wells has required the
industry to provide enhanced corrosion-protection options. In the early years, the normal protec-
tion  scheme  for  mild-corrosion  applications  was  the  use  of  protective  coatings.  These  were
either epoxy paint, babbit spray, or stainless-steel/high-alloy metal flame spray. Each of these
has  the  disadvantage  of  the  potential  for  mechanical  damage  during  the  installation  handling
process and deployment through the casing. The need for a higher-level corrosion-resistant ESP
was first recognized with the application of units into carbon dioxide (CO2) enhanced-recovery
reservoirs  in  the  late  1970s.  From  this  need,  the  first-generation  corrosion-resistant  ESP  unit
was developed. Current units use high-chromium alloys in the components exposed to the well-
bore fluids.

Another source of corrosion is hydrogen sulfide, H2S. The H2S mainly attacks copper-based
alloys of the pump, seal-chamber section, and cable. This type of corrosion can be controlled
by  replacing  the  copper-based  alloy  components  with  suitable  materials  or  by  isolating  them
from exposure to the well fluid and gases. When CO2, H2S, and hot brine are combined, unpre-
dictable corrosion results may appear. With small changes in the concentration of CO2 and/or
H2S  and  temperature,  corrosion  could  even  vary  significantly  from  well  to  well  within  the
same reservoir.

Another  corrosion  mechanism  that  has  been  around  the  oil  field  for  years,  but  has  been
misunderstood  or  misdiagnosed,  is  microbiologically  influenced  or  induced  corrosion.30  It  is
caused  by  sulfate-reducing  bacteria,  as  well  as  other  forms  of  anaerobic  and  aerobic  bacteria.
The  four  common  types  found  in  oil  wells  and  affecting  ESPs  are  anaerobic  sulfate-reducing
bacteria  (SRB),  anaerobic  acid-producing  bacteria,  aerobic  acid-producing  bacteria,  and  slime-
forming bacteria. The SRB and anaerobic/aerobic acid-producing bacteria species attach them-
selves to the surface of the ESP components and cause direct and indirect corrosion and severe
pitting. The slime-forming species can cause some minor corrosion but is noted more for down-
hole formation and equipment plugging.

Scale and Asphaltenes.  If the well has scaling or asphaltene-forming tendencies, these can
be detrimental to the performance and run-life of the total ESP system. Because of the charac-
teristics  of  the  ESP  system,  there  are  pressure  and  temperature  changes,  which  provide  a
mechanism for scales to form or precipitate out of solution. Typically, scales cause two prob-
lems.  They  plug  the  flow  passageways  of  the  pump  stages,  reducing  or  stopping  the  flow
entirely. They also adhere to the outside surfaces of the motor and seal-chamber section, reduc-
ing  the  heat-transfer  rate,  causing  both  units  to  run  hotter.  Asphaltenes  generally  only  cause

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

plugging  of  the  pump  stages.  Both  problems  can  be  reduced,  but  not  totally  eliminated,  by
applying synthetic coatings to the surfaces affected or by using a downhole inhibitor-chemical
treatment.

13.3.10 Installation and Handling.  Although there can be many factors that influence or di-
rectly  affect  the  run-life  of  an  ESP  system,  proper  installation  and  handling  procedures  are
critical.  The  recommended  installation  and  handling  procedures  are  detailed  in  API  RP11S3.3
In addition to these, manufacturers should be contacted for specific recommendations on their
equipment.

13.3.11 Maintenance and Troubleshooting.  Operating, maintenance, and troubleshooting rec-
ommendations  are  covered  in  API  RP11S.31  Additionally,  much  can  be  learned  from  the
disassembly of the ESP components after they are pulled from the well. This is true whether
they are in reusable condition or have been through a catastrophic failure. The equipment and
the  wellbore  always  indicate  items  that  can  be  changed  or  improved.  API  RP11S1  provides
guidelines  on  the  disassembly  of  ESP  components  and  the  evaluation  of  the  findings.32  Also,
each ESP manufacturer has recommendations and guidelines on this topic.

Ref. 33 provides a practical checklist for optimizing the life of an ESP system. It covers all
the  critical  or  sensitive  steps,  from  the  design  and  manufacture  to  the  operational  procedures.
There  have  been  several  papers  written  that  deal  with  literature  on  ESP  application  problems
and solutions.34–37 These papers summarize and categorize ESP reference literature by a num-
ber  of  different  application  or  problem  topics.  They  are  an  excellent  bibliography  set  for
troubleshooting application-related problems or issues.

13.4 ESP System Selection and Performance Calculations
The  sizing  and  selection  procedure  is  from  a  published  nine-step  design  procedure.38  The
overview  provides  a  step-by-step  process  for  evaluating  and  selecting  the  proper  ESP  equip-
ment for a particular application. This is a manual procedure used to illustrate the ESP design
steps.  While  it  is  accurate  for  simple  water  and  light-crude  designs,  there  are  commercially
available ESP design software programs that give accurate designs for wells with high GORs,
viscous crudes, high temperature, and/or operation on VSCs.

This nine-step procedure helps one design the appropriate submersible pumping system for
a particular well. Each of the nine steps is explained in the sections that follow, including gas
calculations and variable-speed operations. The nine steps are listed next.

• Step One: Basic Data—Collect and analyze all the well data that will be used in the design.
• Step Two: Production Capacity—Determine the well productivity at the desired pump set-

ting depth, or determine the pump setting depth at the desired production rate.

• Step Three: Gas Calculations—Calculate the fluid volumes, including gas at the pump-in-

seal section, and check equipment limitations.

• Step Seven: Electric Cable—Select the correct type and size of cable.
• Step Eight: Accessory and Optional Equipment—Select the motor controller, transformer,

tubing head, and optional equipment.

• Step  Nine:  The  Variable-Speed  Pumping  System—For  additional  operational  flexibility,

select the variable-speed submersible pumping system.

take conditions.

• Step Four: TDH—Determine the pump discharge requirement.
• Step  Five:  Pump  Type—For  a  given  capacity  and  TDH,  select  the  pump  type  that  will

have the highest efficiency for the desired flow rate.

• Step  Six:  Optimum  Size  of  Components—Select  the  optimum  size  of  pump,  motor,  and

13.4.1 Step 1: Basic Data.  The design of a submersible pumping unit, under most conditions,
is  not  a  difficult  task,  especially  if  reliable  data  are  available.  Although,  if  the  information,
especially  that  pertaining  to  the  well’s  capacity,  is  poor,  the  design  will  usually  be  marginal.
Bad data often result in a misapplied pump and costly operation. A misapplied pump may oper-
ate outside the recommended range, overload or underload the motor, or draw down the well at
a rapid rate that may result in formation damage. On the other extreme, the pump may not be
large enough to provide the desired production rate.

Too often, data from other wells in the same field or in a nearby area are used, assuming
that wells from the same producing horizon have similar characteristics. Unfortunately, for the
engineer sizing the submersible installations, oil wells are much like fingerprints (i.e., no two
are quite alike).

The actual selection procedure can vary significantly depending on the well-fluid properties.
The three major types of ESP applications are wells with single-phase flow of oil and/or water,
wells with multiphase flow of liquids and gas (especially high free-gas rates), and wells produc-
ing highly-viscous fluids typically much greater than 10 cp. A list of required data is outlined
next.

• Well Data: Casing or liner size, weight, grade; tubing size, weight, grade type and thread,
plus  condition;  pump  setting  depth  (measured  and  vertical);  perforated  or  openhole  interval;
well plugback total depth (measured and vertical).

• Production  Data:  Wellhead  tubing  pressure;  wellhead  casing  pressure;  present  production
rate; producing fluid level and/or pump-intake pressure at datum point; static fluid level and/or
static bottomhole pressure at datum point; datum point; bottomhole temperature; desired produc-
tion rate (target); GOR; and water cut.

• Well-Fluid Conditions: Specific gravity of water; oil °API or specific gravity; specific grav-
ity  of  gas;  bubblepoint  pressure  of  gas;  viscosity  of  oil  (dead);  and  other  available  pressure/
volume/temperature (PVT) data.

• Power Sources: Available primary voltage, frequency, and power source capabilities.
• Possible Production Problems: Sand, scale deposition, corrosion, paraffin/asphaltenes, emul-

sion, gas, high reservoir temperature.

13.4.2 Step Two: Production Capacity.  The  following  is  a  simplification  of  procedures  for
predicting well performance. This discussion assumes little or no well skin. A damaged well-
bore or other factors affects the well flow performance.

Productivity Index.  When the well flowing pressure (Pwf ) is greater than bubblepoint pres-
sure  (Pb),  the  fluid  flow  is  single-phase  flow,  and  the  inflow  performance  relationship  is  a
straight line with slope J, as given by the PI.

PI = J = Q / (Pr – Pwf ) . ................................................... (13.12)

Inflow Performance Relationship.  If Pwf is less than Pb, resulting in multiphase flow in the
reservoir, the inflow-performance-relationship (IPR) method should be used. The relationship is
given by Eq. 13.13.

Qomax = Qo / 1 – 0.2(Pwf / Pr) – 0.8(Pwf / Pr)2 . .............................. (13.13)

This  relationship  was  first  used  by  Gilbert39  and  further  developed  by  Vogel.40  Vogel  devel-
oped  a  dimensionless  reference  curve  that  can  be  used  to  determine  the  IPR  curve  for  a
particular well. Others have developed variations of the IPR equation. (See the chapter on in-
flow and outflow in this section of the Handbook).

13.4.3 Step Three: Gas Calculations.  The presence of free gas at the pump intake and in the
discharge tubing makes the process of equipment selection much more complicated and volumi-
nous.  As  the  fluid  (liquid/gas  mixture)  flows  through  the  pump  stages  from  the  intake  to  the
discharge  and  through  the  discharge  tubing,  the  pressure  and,  consequently,  fluid  properties
(such  as  volume,  density,  etc.)  are  undergoing  continuous  change.  Also,  the  presence  of  free
gas  in  the  discharge  tubing  may  create  a  significant  “gas  lift”  effect  and  considerably  reduce
the required discharge pressure or TDH of the pump.

Ideally, a well is produced with a submergence pressure above the bubblepoint pressure to
keep gases in solution at the pump intake. This is typically not feasible, so the gases must be
either handled by the pump or separated from the other fluids prior to the pump intake.

It  is  essential  to  determine  the  effect  of  the  gas  on  the  fluid  volume  to  select  the  proper
pump  and  any  auxiliary  equipment.  The  following  calculations  yield  the  approximate  percent
free gas by volume.

If the solution GOR (Rs), the gas volume factor (Bg), and the formation volume factor (Bo)
are not available from reservoir data, they must be calculated, and there are a number of multi-
phase correlations to select from. The correlation selected will affect the design, so select the
one  that  best  matches  the  conditions.  Standings  correlations  for  solution  GOR  and  formation
volume factor are shown next.

Solution GOR.

Rs = SGg (Pb / 18) × (100.0125 × °API / 100.00091 × TF) 1.2048 . ....................... (13.14)

Rs = 0.1342 SGg Pb × (100.0125 × °API / 100.00091(1.8TC + 32)) 1.2048 . ................ (13.15)

Note:  pump-intake  pressure  should  be  substituted  for  bubblepoint  pressure  when  calculating
pump-intake conditions.

Gas Volume Factor.  The gas volume factor, Bg, is expressed in reservoir scf/bbl gas (m3/

m3).

Bg = 5.04 (ZTR / P) . ...................................................... (13.16)

Or, in metric,

Bg = 0.00377 (ZTK / P) . ................................................... (13.17)

Formation Volume Factor.  The formation volume factor, Bo, represents the increased vol-
ume that a barrel of oil occupies in the formation as compared to the stock-tank barrel of oil
(STBO).

Also, see chapters in the General Engineering section of this Handbook.

Total Volume of Fluids.  When these three variables: Rs, Bo, and Bg are known, the volumes
of  oil,  water,  and  free  gas  can  be  determined  and  percentages  of  each  calculated.  The  total
volume of gas (both free and in solution ) can be determined as

total gas = (producing GOR × BOPD) / 1,000 = Mcf

= producing GOR × m3 / d = m3 . ........................................... (13.21)

The gas in solution at submergence pressure can be determined as

solution gas = (Rs × BOPD) / 1,000 = Mcf . .................................... (13.22)

The free gas equals the total gas minus the solution gas. The volume of oil (Vo) at the pump
intake is equal to stock-tank barrels multiplied by Bo, the formation volume factor. The volume
of  gas  (Vg)  at  the  pump  intake  is  equal  to  the  amount  of  free  gas  multiplied  by  Bg,  the  gas
volume factor. The volume of water (Vw) in the formation is approximately the same as stock
tank barrels. Total fluid volume (Vt) can now be determined.

Vt = Vo +Vg +Vw . ......................................................... (13.23)

The percentage of free gas to total volume of fluids can now be calculated as

vol % free gas = Vg /Vt . .................................................. (13.24)

13.4.4 Step Four: Total Dynamic Head.  The next step is to determine the TDH required to
pump the desired capacity. The total pump head refers to feet (meters) of liquid being pumped
and is calculated to be the sum of: net well lift, HL; well-tubing friction loss, Ft; and wellhead
pressure head, Hwh. The simplified equation is written as

TDH = HL + Ft + Hwh . .................................................... (13.25)

13.4.5 Step Five: Pump Type.  Refer  to  the  manufacturer’s  catalog  for  pump  types,  ranges,
and  pump-performance  curves  (60  Hz  and  50  Hz).  On  the  basis  of  expected  fluid  production
rate and casing size, select the pump type that will, at the expected producing rate, be operat-
ing within the pump’s operating range and near to the pump’s peak efficiency.

Where  two  or  more  pump  types  have  similar  efficiencies  at  the  desired  volume,  certain

conditions determine the pump choice:

• Pump  prices  and  corresponding  motor  sizes  and  prices  may  differ  somewhat.  Normally,

the larger-diameter pump and motor are less expensive and operate at higher efficiencies.

• When  the  well’s  capacity  is  not  known,  or  cannot  be  closely  estimated,  a  pump  with  a
“steep” characteristic curve should be chosen. If the desired volume falls at a point where two
pump types have approximately equal efficiency, choose the pump type that requires the great-
est number of stages. Such a pump will produce a capacity nearest the desired volume even if
the well lift is substantially more or less than expected.

• If  gas  is  present  in  the  produced  fluid,  a  gas  separator  may  be  required  to  achieve  effi-
cient  operation.  Note  that  the  free  gas  is  vented  up  the  casing  annulus.  Refer  to  Step  3  to

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-691

determine the effect of gas on the produced volume. The adjusted volume affects pump selec-
tion and the size of the other system components.

• In  wells  where  the  fluid  is  quite viscous  and/or  tends  to  emulsify, or  in  other  extraordi-
nary  circumstances,  some  pump  corrections  may  be  necessary  to  ensure  a  more  efficient
operation. In such cases, contact the manufacturer for engineering recommendations.

The Variable-Speed Submersible Pumping (VSSP) System and Pump Selection.  Under the
previous or other pumping conditions, also consider the VSSP system. Such systems must be
justified. For instance, in item two in the previous section, if the production rate is not accurate-
ly known, a VSSP system may be applicable. A VSC effectively converts a single pump into a
family  of  pumps,  so  a  pump  can  be  selected  for  an  estimated  range  and  adjusted  for  the  de-
sired production level, once more data are collected.

Review Step 9 when considering the VSSP system. Variable-frequency performance curves
are included in most manufacturers’ information. The VSSP system with the VSC may provide
additional  economies  of  capital  expenditure  and  operating  expenses  and  should  be  considered
in Step 6. The VSC and transformers for the VSSP system are discussed in Steps 8 and 9.

13.4.6 Step 6: Optimum Size of Components.  ESP components are built in a number of sizes
and can be assembled in a variety of combinations. These combinations must be carefully deter-
mined  to  operate  the  submersible  pumping  system  within  production  requirements,  material
strength,  and  temperature  limits.  While  sizing  components,  refer  to  the  manufacturer  for  the
following  information:  equipment  combinations  in  various  casings,  maximum  loading  limits,
maximum diameter of units, velocity of a fluid passing a motor, shaft HP limitations at various
frequencies.

Pump.  Refer to the manufacturer’s performance curve of the selected pump type, and deter-
mine the number of stages required to produce the anticipated capacity against the previously
calculated total dynamic head. Usually, performance curves for 60-Hz, 50-Hz, and variable-fre-
quency  operations  are  provided  in  the  manufacturer’s  catalog.  The  pump  characteristic  curves
are stage performance curves based on water with a specific gravity of 1.0. At the intersection
of the desired production rate (bottom scale) and the head-capacity curve (vertical scale), read
the  head  value  on  the  left  scale.  Divide  this  value  into  the  TDH  to  determine  the  number  of
stages: total stages = TDH/(head/stage).

Separator.  Refer to the manufacturer’s catalog for gas-separator information. Make the nec-

essary adjustments in HP requirements and housing length.

Motor.  To select the proper motor size for a predetermined pump size, the BHP required
by the pump must be determined. The HP per stage is obtained by referring to the performance
curve for the selected pump. The BHP required to drive a given pump is easily calculated by
the following formula: BHP = total stages × (BHP/stage) × SG.

Refer  to  the  manufacturer’s  information  for  motor  specifications.  Select  a  motor  size  that
closely meets the design conditions. The maximum load conditions should not exceed 110% of
rating.  Minimum  operating  loads  should  not  put  the  motor  into  an  idle  condition,  otherwise
protection  monitoring  is  nullified.  Manufacturers  should  be  contacted  for  specific  operating
ranges. Typically, operators try to select a motor that operates in the range from 70 to 100% of
its rating.

Seal Section.  Refer to a manufacturer’s catalog for selection of the proper seal section.

13.4.7 Step 7: Electric Cable.  ESP electric cables are normally available in conductor sizes 1,
2,  4,  and  6.  These  sizes  are  offered  in  both  round  and  flat  configurations.  Several  types  of
armor and insulation are available for protection against corrosive fluids and severe environments.

Cable selection involves the determination of cable size, cable type, and cable length.
Cable Size.  The proper cable size is dependent on combined factors of voltage drop, amper-

age, and available space between tubing collars and casing.

IV-692

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Refer to the cable voltage drop curve (samples are shown in Fig 13.28) for voltage drop in
cable. At the selected motor amperage and the given downhole temperature, the selection of a
cable size that gives a voltage drop of less than 30 volts per 1,000 ft (305 m) can be used as a
guideline.  This  curve  determines  the  necessary  surface  voltage  (motor  voltage  plus  voltage
drop in the cable) required to operate the motor.

Finally, check the manufacturer’s information to determine if the size selected can be used
with the proposed tubing and well casing sizes. The cable diameter plus tubing-collar diameter
must be less than the ID of the casing. To determine the optimum cable size, consider future
equipment requirements that may require the use of a larger-sized cable.

Where power cost is a major concern, kilowatt-hour loss curves can be used to justify the
cable selection. Although power rates vary widely, this information is valuable in determining
the economics of various cable sizes.

Cable Type.  Selection of the cable type is primarily based on fluid conditions, bottomhole
temperature, and space limitations within the casing annulus. Carefully select the type of cable
for  hostile  environments.  Refer  to  the  manufacturers  catalog  for  cable  specifications.  Where
there is not sufficient space to run round cable, use electric cable with a flat configuration. The
flat cable configuration induces a voltage imbalance. If it is significant, a transition splice may
be required. Verify this with the manufacturer.

Cable Length.  The total cable length should be about 100 ft (30 m) longer than the mea-
sured  pump  setting  depth  to  make  surface  connections  a  safe  distance  from  the  wellhead.
Check the voltage available at the motor terminal block to avoid the possibility of low voltage
starts. The available motor terminal voltage is the surface supply voltage minus the cable volt-
age drop.

Cable Venting.  In all wells, it is necessary to vent gases from the cable prior to the motor
controller to avoid explosive conditions. A cable venting box is available to protect the motor
controller from such gases.

13.4.8 Step 8: Accessory and Optional Equipment.  Downhole Accessory Equipment.  Flat Cable
(Motor  Lead  Extension).    Select  a  length  at  least  6  ft  (1.8  m)  longer  than  the  pump  intake
(standard  or  gas  separator)  and  seal  section  for  the  motor  series  chosen.  Refer  to  the
manufacturer’s information for dimensions.

Flat-Cable Guard (Optional).  Choose  the  required  number  for  6-ft  (1.8-m)  guard  sections
to at least equal the flat-cable length. Do not use guards for installation of a 400 series pump
and  seal  section  with  5½-in.  OD  and  20-lbm  casing,  and  a  513  series  pump  and  seal  section
with 6⅝-in. OD and 26-lbm casing.

Cable Bands.  Use one 30-in. (76-cm) cable band every 2 ft (60 cm) for clamping flat ca-
bles  to  pumps.  The  22-in.  (56-cm)  length  can  be  used  for  all  tubing/cable  combinations
through 3½-OD tubing. For 4½-in.- and 5½-in.-OD tubing, use 30-in. (76-cm) bands. One band
is  required for  each 15  ft  (5  m)  of  setting depth.  Refer  to  the  manufacturer’s information for
dimensions.

Swaged Nipple, Check Valve, and Drain Valve (Optional).  Select  these  accessories  on  the

basis of required ODs and type of threads.

Motor Controllers.  Motor  controllers  are  typical  state-of-the-art  digital  controls  consisting

of two components.

System Unit.  This  unit  performs  all  the  shutdown  and  restart  operations.  It  is  mounted  in

the low-voltage compartment of the control panel.

Display Unit (Optional).  This unit displays readings, set points, and alarms. It is normally
mounted in the amp chart enclosure for easy access. It provides all the basic functions, such as
underload, overload, phase imbalance, phase rotation, and many other parameters including pass-
word and communication protocols.

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-693

Single-Phase and Three-Phase Transformers.  The type of transformer selected depends on
the size of the primary power system and the required secondary voltage. Three-phase isolation
stepup  transformers  are  generally  selected  for  increasing  voltage  from  a  low-voltage  system,
while a bank of three identical single-phase transformers is usually selected for reducing a high-
voltage primary power source to the required surface voltage.

On existing systems, some ESP units operate without the use of an additional transformer.
For  new  installation  of  units  with  higher  voltages,  it  is  usually  less  expensive  to  install  three
single-phase transformers, connected wye, to eliminate the auto-transformer.

In choosing the size of a stepup transformer or a bank of three single-phase transformers,

Eq. 13.26 is used to calculate the total kilowatts/volts/amps (KVA) required.

KVA = (Vs × Am × 1.73) / 1,000. ............................................. (13.26)

Surface Cable.  Choose the approximate length required for connecting the controller to the
primary power system or transformer. Two pieces are generally required for installations using
an auto-transformer. Size should equal the well cable size, except in the case of stepup or auto-
transformer, where the primary and secondary currents are not the same.

Wellheads and Accessories.  Select  the  wellhead  on  the  basis  of  casing  size,  tubing  size,
maximum recommended load, surface pressure, and maximum setting depth. Electric cable pass-
es through the wellhead where pressure fittings are not required.

Electric-feed-through (EFT) mandrels are also available. The electric cable is spliced to pig-

tails. The EFT wellheads seal against downhole pressure and prevent gas leaks at the surface.

Servicing  Equipment.    Cable  Reels,  Reel  Supports,  and  Cable  Guides.    Select  the  size  of
cable reel required to handle the previously selected cable size. Select a set of cable-reel sup-
ports on the basis of cable-reel size. Cable guides are designed to handle cable sizes 1 through
6.  Normally,  customers  retain  one  cable  reel,  one  set  of  reel  supports,  and  one  cable  guide
wheel for future use.

Shipping Cases.  Select the type and length of the case required accommodating the previ-

ously selected motor, pump, gas separator, and seal.

Optional Equipment.  Bottomhole Sensing Device.  The  downhole  sensor  provides  continu-
ous  measurement  of  parameters  such  as  wellbore  pressures,  wellbore  or  ESP  temperature,
discharge flow rates, water contamination of the motor, or equipment vibration.

Automatic Well Monitoring.  Motor  controllers  are  available  for  the  continuous  monitoring

of pump operations from a central location.

13.4.9 Step 9: Variable Speed Submersible Pumping System.  The ESP system can be modi-
fied  to  include  a  variable-frequency  controller  so  that  it  operates  over  a  broader  range  of
capacity,  head,  and  efficiency.  Most  of  the  ESP  manufacturers  and  several  third  parties  have
computerized  pump-selection  programs  to  assist  in  VSSP-system  selection;  what  follows  is  a
basic explanation of the principles involved.

Variable Frequency.  The  VSC  is  commonly  used  to  generate  any  frequency  between  30
and 90 Hz. Pump-performance curves for frequencies other than 60 Hz can be generated with
the  affinity  laws  (Eqs.  13.2  through  13.4).  The  output  rating  of  the  motor  is  also  affected  by
the operating frequency (Eq. 13.9).

A  set  of  curves  can  be  developed  for  an  arbitrary  series  of  frequencies  with  these  equa-
tions,  as  shown  in  the  variable-frequency  performance  curves  at  the  end  of  this  step  (Fig.
13.51).  Each  curve  represents  a  series  of  points  derived  from  the  60-Hz  curve  for  flow  and
corresponding head points, transformed using the previously mentioned equations.

Suppose we are given the following data at a frequency of 60 Hz: rate = 1,200 B/D; head
= 24.5 ft (from FC-1200 curve at 1,200 B/D); BHP = 0.34 BHP (from FC-1200 curve at 1,200

IV-694

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 13.51—FC-1200 stage variable-speed performance curve [after Centrilift Graphics, Claremore, Okla-
homa (2003)].

B/D). If a new frequency of 50 Hz is chosen, the data will be: new rate = (50/60) × 1,200 B/D
= 1,000 B/D; new head = (50/60)2 × 24.5 ft = 17 ft; and new BHP = (50/60)3 × 034 BHP =
0.20 BHP.

By performing these calculations at other production rates, a new curve for 50-Hz operation

can be plotted. Start by locating the existing points on the one-stage 60-Hz curve:

• Q1 rate, B/D: 0; 950; 1,200; 1550; and 1,875.
• H1 head, ft: 32, 28.6, 24.5, 15, and 0.
• Efficiency, %: 1, 63.5, 64, 49, and 0.
Following the previous equations, calculate the corresponding values at 50 Hz:
• Q1 rate, B/D: 0; 792; 1,000; 1,292; and 1,563.
• H1 head, ft: 22.2, 19.9, 17, 10.4, and 0.
• Efficiency, %: 0, 63.5, 64, 49, and 0.
Plotting these coordinates gives the one-stage FC-1200 head-capacity performance curve an
operation at 50 Hz. Similar calculations provide coordinates for curves at other frequencies, as
shown by the FC-1200 variable-speed performance curve (Fig. 13.51). The vortex-shaped win-
dow is the recommended operating range for the pump. As long as the hydraulic requirement
falls within this range, the pump is within the recommended operating range.

13.5 Design Example

13.5.1 Step 1: Basic Data.  The data used for this example are given next.

Well Data.  K55 casing from surface to 5,600 ft: 7 in. and 26 lbm/ft; K55 liner from 5,530
to 6,930 ft: 5 in. and 15 lbm/ft; J55 EUE API tubing: 2⅞ in. and 6.5 lbm/ft; perforations and

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-695

true  vertical  depth  (TVD):  6,750  to  6,850  ft;  and  pump  setting  TVD  (just  above  liner  top):
5,500 ft.

Production Data.  Tubing  pressure:  100  psi;  casing  pressure:  100  psi;  present  production
rate: 850 BFPD; pump-intake pressure: 2,600 psi; static bottomhole pressure: 3,200 psi; datum
point: 6,800 ft; bottomhole temperature: 160°F; minimum desired production rate: 2,300 BFPD;
GOR: 300 scf/STB; and water cut: 75%.

Well Fluid Conditions.  Specific  gravity  of  water:  1.085;  oil  °API  or  SG:  32;  SG  of  gas:

0.7; bubblepoint pressure of gas: 1,500 psi; viscosity of oil: N/A; PVT data: none.

Power Sources.  Available primary voltage: 12,470 V; frequency: 60 Hz; power source ca-

pabilities: N/A.

Possible Problems.  There were no reported problems.

13.5.2 Step 2: Production Capacity.  Determine the well productivity at the test pressure and
production  rate.  In  this  case,  the  maximum  production  rate  is  desired  without  resulting  in  se-
vere gas-interference problems. The pump-intake pressure at the desired production rate can be
calculated from the present production conditions.

Because  the  well  flowing  pressure  (2,600  psi)  is  greater  than  bubblepoint  pressure  (1,500
psi), the constant-PI method will most probably give satisfactory results. First, one can deter-
mine the PI using the test data:

PI = Q / (Pr – Pwf ), ....................................................... (13.27)

and

PI = 850 / (3,200 – 2,600) = 1.42 B/D, psi . ................................... (13.28)

Next,  we  can  determine  the  new  well  flowing  pressure  (Pwf)  at  the  estimated  production  rate
(Qd).

Pwf = Pr – (Qd / PI), ...................................................... (13.29)

and

Pwf = 3,200 – (2,300 / 1.42) = 1,580 psi . ..................................... (13.30)

The well flowing pressure of 1,580 psi is still above the bubblepoint pressure of 1,500 psi;
therefore,  the  PI  approach  should  give  good  results.  The  pump-intake  pressure  can  be  deter-
mined  by  correcting  the  flowing  bottomhole  pressure  for  the  difference  in  the  pump  setting
depth and datum point, and by considering the friction-loss datum point and friction loss in the
casing annulus. In the given example, as the pump is set 1,300 ft above the perforations, the
friction  loss,  because  of  flow  of  fluid  through  the  annulus  from  perforations  to  pump  setting
depth, is small, as compared to the flowing pressure, and can be neglected.

Because  there  is  both  water  and  oil  in  the  produced  fluids,  it  is  necessary  to  calculate  a

composite SG of the produced fluids. To find the composite SG, water cut is 75%; therefore,

SGw = 0.75 × 1.085 = 0.8138. ............................................... (13.31)

Oil is 25%; therefore,

IV-696

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

SGo = 0.25 × 0.865 = 0.2163. ................................................ (13.32)

The composite SG is the sum of the weighted percentages:

SGmix = 0.8138 + 0.2163 = 1.03. ............................................. (13.33)

The pressure, because of the difference in perforation depth and pump setting depth (6,800 to
5,500 ft = 1,300 ft), can be determined as:

PSI = (head,

ft × SGmix) / 2.31 ft / psi, ........................................ (13.34)

and

PSI = (1,300 × 1.03) / 2.31 = 580 psi . ........................................ (13.35)

Therefore, the pump intake pressure is

1,580 psi – 580 psi = 1,000 psi . ............................................ (13.36)

13.5.3 Step 3: Gas Calculations.  In this third step, one must determine the total fluid mixture,
inclusive of water, oil, and free gas that is ingested by the pump. Use actual PVT data if avail-
able. For this example, Standing’s correlation was used.41

Determine the solution GOR (Rs) at the pump-intake pressure by substituting the pump-in-
take  pressure  for  the  bubblepoint  pressure  (Pb)  in  Standing’s  equation.  This  relationship  can
also  be  found  as  a  monograph  in  many  textbooks  or  in  chapters  in  the  General  Engineering
section of this Handbook.

Rs = SGs (Pb / 18) × (100.0125 × °API / 100.0091 × TF) 1.2048, ......................... (13.37)

and

Rs = 0.7 (1,000 / 18) × (100.0125 × 32 / 100.0091 × 160) 1.2048 = 180 scf / STB.

.......... (13.38)

Determine the formation volume factor (Bo) with Rs and the following Standing’s equation

(can also be found as a monograph).

Bo = 0.972 + 0.000147F 1.175, ............................................... (13.39)

where

F = Rs(SGg / SGo)0.5 + 1.25TF = 180(0.7 / 0.865)0.5 + 1.25 × 160 = 361.9. ........... (13.40)

Therefore,

and

Bo = 0.972 + 0.000147(361.92)1.175, .......................................... (13.41)

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-697

Bo = 1.12 actual bbl / STB at 1,000-psi-pump intake pressure . .................. (13.42)

Determine the gas volume factor (Bg) as

Bg = (5.04 ZTR) / P . ....................................................... (13.43)

By assuming 0.85 Z factor (use actual PVT data if available),

Bg = 5.04 × 0.85 × (460 – 160) / 1.014 = 2.62 Mcf / bbl . ........................ (13.44)

Next,  determine  the  total  volume  of  fluids  and  the  percentage  of  free  gas  released  at  the
pump intake. Using the producing GOR and oil volume, determine the total volume of gas (Vg).

Vg = (BOPD × GOR) / 1,000 = (2,300 × .25) × 300 / 1,000 = 172.5 Mcf . ........... (13.45)

Using the solution GOR (Rs) at the pump intake, determine the solution gas volume (VSG).

VSG = (BOPD × Rs) / 1,000 = (2,300 × .25) × 180) / 1,000 = 103.5 Mcf . ........... (13.46)

The difference represents the volume of free gas (VFG) released from solution by the decrease
in pressure from bubblepoint pressure of 1,500 psi to the pump-intake pressure of 1,000 psi.

VFG = 172.5 – 103.5 = 69 Mcf . ............................................. (13.47)

The volume of oil (Vo) at the pump intake is

Vo = BOPD × 1.12 = 644 BOPD . ............................................ (13.48)

The volume of free gas at the pump intake (VIG) in barrels is

VIG = free gas × gas volume factor (Bg)

= 69 Mcf × 2.62 Mcf / bbl = 181 BGPD . .................................... (13.49)

Next, is the equation for the volume of water (Vw) at the pump intake.

Vw = total fluid volume × % water

= 2,300 B / D × 0.75 = 1,725 BWPD . ....................................... (13.50)

The total volume (Vt) of oil, water, and gas at the pump intake can now be determined by

Vt = Vo +VIG +Vw = 644 BOPD + 181 BGPD + 1,725 BWPD

= 2,550 BFPD . ......................................................... (13.51)

The ratio or percentage of free gas present at the pump intake to the total volume of fluid is

% of free gas = VIG /Vt = (181 BGPD / 2,550 BFPD) × 100 = 7 % . ............. (13.52)

IV-698

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

As this value is less than 10% by volume, it has only a minor effect on the pump performance,
especially if most of the free gas is vented up the annulus. Use of a gas separation component
is not essential in this case.

The composite SG, including gas, is determined by first calculating the total mass of pro-

duced fluid (TMPF) from the original data given.

TMPF = (BOPD × SGo) + (BWPD × SGw) × 62.4 × 5.6146
+(300 × 575 × 0.7 × 0.0752) = 839,064 lbm / D, ................................ (13.53)

and

SGcomp = TMPF / (BFPD × 5.6146 × 62.4)

= 839,064 / (2,550 × 5.6146 × 62.4) = 0.939. ................................... (13.54)

Now that the total volume of fluid entering the first pump stage is known (2,550 BFPD) and
the composite SG has been determined, we can continue to the next step of designing the ESP
system.

13.5.4 Step 4: Total Dynamic Head.  Sufficient data are now available to determine the TDH
required by the pump.

TDH = HL + Ft + Hwh, ..................................................... (13.55)

and

HL = pump depth – (PIP × 2.31 ft / psi) / SGcomp

= 5,500 ft – (1,000 × 2.31) / 0.939 = 3,040 ft (926 m) . ......................... (13.56)

The TDH required is based on the normal pumping conditions for the well application. If the
well is killed with a heavier-gravity fluid, a higher head is required to pump the fluid out, until
the well is stabilized on its normal production. More HP is also required to lift the heavier kill
fluid and should be considered when selecting the motor rating for the application. Ft = tubing
friction loss. Refer to Fig. 13.52.

Friction  loss  per  1,000  ft  of  2⅞-in.  tubing  (new)  is  49  ft/1,000  ft  of  depth  at  2,440  B/D

(405 m3/d) or 4.5 m/100 m. Using the desired pump setting depth,

Ft = (5,500 × 49) / 1,000 = 270 ft (82.3 m) . ................................... (13.57)

Hwh = desired head at wellhead (desired wellhead pressure). Using the composite SG,

Hwh = (100 psi × 2.31 ft / psi) / 0.939 = 246 ft (75 m), .......................... (13.58)

and

TDH = 3,040 ft + 270 ft + 246 ft = 3,356 ft, or
926.6 m + 82.3 m + 75 m = 1084 m . ........................................ (13.59)

13.5.5 Step 5: Pump-Type Selection.  From the manufacturer’s catalog information, select the
pump type with the highest efficiency at the calculated capacity 2,440 B/D (405 m3/d) that will
fit the casing. Select the 513 series GC-2200 pump (Fig. 13.53).

The head in feet (meters) for one stage is 2,550 B/D (405 m3/d) and is 41.8 ft (13 m). The
BHP per stage is 1.16. To determine the total number of stages required, divide the TDH by
the head/stage taken from the curve. The number of stages = TDH/(head/stage). The number of
stages = (3,556 /41.8) = 85 stages.

Refer  to  the  manufacturer’s  information  for  the  GC-2200  pump.  The  housing  no.  9  can
house a maximum of 84 stages, 93 stages for a housing no. 10. Because the 84-stage pump is
only  one  stage  less  than  the  calculated  requirement,  it  should  be  adequate  and  the  pump  will
cost  less.  Once  the  maximum  number  of  pump  stages  is  decided,  calculate  the  total  BHP  re-
quired as

BHP = BHP / stage × no. stages × SGmix, ...................................... (13.60)

and

BHP = 1.16 × 84 × 0.939 = 91.5 hp . ......................................... (13.61)

13.5.6 Step 6: Optimum Size of Components.  Gas Separator.  If a gas separator was required,
refer to a catalog to select the appropriate separator and determine its HP requirement. In this

homa (2003)].

example,  one  was  not  needed.  If  gas  interference  causes  operating  problems,  a  gas  separator
can be added on the next ESP repair.

Seal Section.  Normally,  the  seal  section  series  is  the  same  as  that  of  the  pump,  although
there are exceptions and special adapters available to connect the units together. Here, the 513
series GSB seal section is selected.

The  HP  requirement  for  the  seal  depends  on  the  TDH  produced  by  the  pump.  The
manufacturer’s  information  shows  a  requirement  of  3.0  hp  for  the  513  series  seal  operating
against a TDH of 3,556 ft. Therefore, the total HP requirement for this example is 91.5 hp for
the pump, plus 3.0 hp for the seal, or 94.5 hp total.

Motor.  Generally,  a  500  series  motor  should  be  used  with  the  513  series  pump.  When  a
motor is selected, consideration should be given to choose as large a diameter unit as possible
for the casing to optimize the initial cost, motor efficiency, operating costs, and repair costs. In
this  example  select  the  100-hp  562  series  motor  from  the  catalog.  The  motor  voltage  can  be
selected on the basis of considerations discussed next.

The  high-voltage,  consequently  low-current,  motors  have  lower  cable  losses  and  require
smaller conductor-size cables. High-voltage motors have superior starting characteristics—a fea-
ture  that  can  be  extremely  important  if  excessive  voltage  losses  are  expected  during  starting.
Although, the higher the motor voltage, the more expensive is the motor.

In some cases, the savings, because of smaller cable, may be offset by the difference in motor-
controller cost, and it may be necessary to make an economic analysis for the various voltage
motors. However, for this example, the high-voltage motor (100 hp; 2,145 V; 27 amps) is an
excellent choice. Check the manufacturers catalog and equipment information to assure that all
operating parameters are well within their recommended ranges (e.g., thrust bearing, shaft HP,
housing burst pressure, and fluid velocity).

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-701

13.5.7 Step 7: Electric Cable.  Determine Cable Size.  The cable size is selected on the basis
of its current-carrying capability. Using the motor amps (27) and the cable voltage-drop chart
in the catalog, select a cable size with a voltage drop of less than 30 V/1,000 ft. All conductor
sizes 1 through 6 fall in this category. The no. 6 cable has a voltage drop of 18.5 × 1.201 =
22.2 V/1,000 ft (305 m), and based on $0.06/kW-hr. results in a monthly I2R loss of $255. A
no.  4  cable  has  14.1  V/1,000  ft  and  costs  $158/month.  The  operating  cost  savings  of  $97/
month is divided into the added cost of the no. 4 over the no. 6 cable to calculate a payout. A
no. 6 cable size was selected for this example.

Cable Type.  Because of the gassy conditions and the bottomhole temperature, the polypropy-
lene  (“poly”)  cable  should  be  used.  Check  to  be  sure  the  cable  diameter  plus  tubing  collar
diameter is smaller than the casing ID.

Cable Length.   The  pump  setting  depth  is  5,500  ft  (1676.4  m),  with  100  ft  (30.5  m)  of
cable  for  surface  connections;  the  total  cable  length  should  be  5,600  ft  (1707  m).  Check  to
verify that the cable length is within the manufacturer’s recommended maximum length,

Cable Venting.  A  cable  vent  box  must  be  installed  between  the  wellhead  and  the  motor

controller to prevent gas migration to the controller.

13.5.8 Step 8: Accessory and Miscellaneous Equipment. Flat Cable—Motor Lead Extension.
As described in section 13.4.8, calculate the length for the MLE. Pump length = 14.8 ft (4.51
m); seal length = 6.3 ft (1.92 m); plus, 6 ft = 6.0 ft (1.83 m) = 213.1 ft (8.26 m); select 35 ft
(10.7 m) of 562 series flat cable.

Flat Guards.  Cable guards are available in 6-ft sections; therefore, six sections are sufficient.
Cable Bands.  The pump and seal section is approximately 20 ft (6 m) long. Twenty-two-
inch  (56  cm)  bands  are  required  to  clamp  to  the  housing  with  bands  spaced  at  2-ft  (61  cm)
intervals  (10  bands).  On  the  production-tubing  string  above  the  pump,  the  same  length  cable
bands can be used. The bands should be spaced at 15-ft (4.5-m) intervals. The setting depth of
5,500 ft requires 367 bands.

Downhole Accessory Equipment.   Refer  to  the  manufacturer’s  catalog  for  the  accessories

listed next.

Swaged  Nipple.    The  pump  outlet  is  2⅞  in.,  per  the  manufacturer’s  information,  so  a

swaged nipple is not required for the 2⅞-in. tubing.

Check Valve.  The 2⅞-in.-EUE, 8-round, thread check valve is recommended.
Drain Valve.  The 2⅞-in.-EUE, 8-round, thread drain valve should be used (in conjunction

with the check valve) to eliminate pulling a wet string.

Motor  Controller.    The  motor-controller  selection  is  based  on  its  voltage,  amperage,  and
KVA rating. Therefore, before selecting the controller, one must first determine the motor con-
troller voltage. Assume the controller voltage is the same as the surface voltage going down-
hole. The surface voltage (SV) is the sum of the motor voltage and the total voltage loss in the
cable. (Adjust taps on the transformer to closely achieve this value.)

Vs = 2,145 V + (22.2 V × 5,600 ft) / 1,000 ft = 2,269 V . ....................... (13.62)

The motor amperage is 27 amps; the KVA can now be calculated.

KVA = (Vs × motor amps × 1.73) / 1,000, ...................................... (13.63)

and

KVA = (2,269 × 27 × 1.73) / 1,000 = 106. ...................................... (13.64)

IV-702

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

The 6H-CG motor controller suits these requirements.

Transformer.    The  transformer  selection  is  based  on  the  available  primary  power  supply
(12,470  V),  the  secondary  voltage  requirement  (2,269  V)  and  the  KVA  requirement  (106
KVA). Choose three 313.5 KVA single-phase transformers as shown in the manufacturer’s cat-
alog.

Surface Cable.  Select 50 ft (15.2 m) of no. 1 cable for surface connection to transformers.

13.6 Example

13.6.1 Step  1:  Variable-Speed  Pumping  System.    Use  the  previous  example,  and  design  a
new system using a VSC. To help justify the use of a VSC, two new conditions were added.
First, assume that we need to maintain a constant oil production (575 BOPD), although, reser-
voir  data  indicate  we  should  see  an  increase  in  water  cut  (75  to  80%)  over  the  next  few
months.  Next,  to  satisfy  our  economic  justification  in  using  the  VSC,  we  must  optimize  the
initial cost and size of the downhole assembly.

To  maintain  oil  production  as  the  water  cut  increases,  we  must  determine  the  maximum

desired flow rate with 80% water.

Maximum flow rate = BOPD / oil % , ....................................... (13.65)

and

Maximum flow = (575 / 0.20) = 2,875 B / D . .................................. (13.66)

13.6.2 Step 2: Production Capacity.  We  can  now  calculate  the  pump  intake  pressure  at  the
maximum  rate  of  2,875  B/D.  First,  make  the  assumption  that  even  though  the  water  cut
changes,  the  well’s  PI  will  remain  constant.  Now,  determine  the  new  well  flowing  pressure
(Pwf) at the maximum desired production rate (Qd).

Pwf = Pr – (Qd / PI), ...................................................... (13.67)

and

Pwf = 3,200 – (2,875 / 1.42) = 1,175 psi . ..................................... (13.68)

The new well flowing pressure of 1,175 psi is slightly below the bubblepoint pressure of 1,500
psi; therefore, the PI approach should still give good results.

The pump-intake pressure can be determined the same as before, although, a new compos-

ite specific gravity must be calculated.

Water cut is 80 % ; SGw = 0.80 × 1.085 = 0.868. ............................... (13.69)

Oil is 25 % ; SGol = 0.20 × 0.865 = 0.173. .................................... (13.70)

The composite SG is the sum of the weighted percentages:

SGmix = 0.868 + 0.173 = 1.04. ............................................... (13.71)

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-703

The  pressure  because  of  the  difference  in  perforation  depth  and  pump  setting  depth  (6,800  +
5,500 ft = 12,300 ft) can be determined as

psi = (head,

ft × SGmix) / 2.31 ft / psi, ........................................ (13.72)

and

psi = (1,300 × 1.04) / 2.31 = 585 psi . ......................................... (13.73)

Therefore, the pump-intake pressure (PIP) can now be determined as

PIP = 1,175 psi – 585 psi = 590 psi . ........................................ (13.74)

13.6.3 Step 3: Gas Calculations.  Next, determine the total fluid mixture that will be ingested
by the pump at the new maximum desired flow rate (2,875 B/D). Determine the solution GOR
(Rs)  at  the  pump-intake  pressure  or  by  substituting  the  pump-intake  pressure  for  the  bubble-
point pressure (Pb) in Standing’s equation.41

Rs = Ys (Pb / 18) × (100.0125 × API / 100.0091 × TF) 1.2048, ........................... (13.75)

and

Rs = 0.7 (585 / 18) × (100.0125 × 32 / 100.0091 × 160) 1.2048 = 94 scf / STB . ............ (13.76)

Determine  the  formation  volume  factor  (Bo)  with  the  Rs  from  Standing’s  monograph  (see  the
General Engineering section of this Handbook) or use Standing’s equation41

Bo = 0.972 + 0.000147F 1.175, ............................................... (13.77)

where

and

Therefore,

F = Rs(Yg /Yo)0.5 + 1.25TF, .................................................. (13.78)

F = 94(0.7 / 0.865)0.5 + 1.25 × 160 = 284.56. ................................... (13.79)

Bo = 0.972 + 0.000147(284.56)1.175 = 1.08 reservoir bbl / STB . ................... (13.80)

Determine the gas volume factor (Bg) as

Bg = (5.04ZTR) / P . ....................................................... (13.81)

Assuming a 0.85 Z factor,

IV-704

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Bg = 5.04 × 0.85 × (460 – 160) / 604 = 4.40 bbl / Mcf . ......................... (13.82)

Next, determine the total volume of fluids, and the percentage of free gas released at the pump
intake. Using the producing GOR and oil volume, determine the total volume of gas (TG).

TG = (BOPD × GOR) / 1,000, ................................................ (13.83)

or

TG = (2,875 × 0.20) × 300 / 1,000 = 172.5 Mcf . ............................... (13.84)

Using the solution GOR (Rs) at the pump intake, determine the solution gas volume (VSG).

VSG = (BOPD × Rs) / 1,000 = (2,875 × 0.20) × 94 / 1,000

= 54.05 Mcf . ........................................................... (13.85)

The difference represents the volume of free gas (VFG) released from solution by the decrease
in pressure from the bubblepoint pressure of 1,500 psi to the pump intake pressure of 1,000 psi.

VFG = 172.5 – 54.05 = 118.5 Mcf . ........................................... (13.86)

The volume of oil (Vo) at the pump intake is

Vo = BOPD × Bo, ......................................................... (13.87)

and

Vo = 575 BOPD × 1.08 = 621 BOPD . ........................................ (13.88)

The volume of free gas at the pump intake is

Vg = VFG × Bg, ........................................................... (13.89)

and

Vg = 118.5 Mcf × 4.40 bbl / Mcf = 521 BGPD . ................................ (13.90)

The volume of water (Vw) at the pump intake is

Vw = total fluid volume × % water, ......................................... (13.91)

and

Vw = 2,875 B / D × 0.80 = 2,300 BWPD . ..................................... (13.92)

The total volume (Vt) or oil, water, and gas at the pump intake can now be determined

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-705

Vt = Vo +Vg +Vw, .......................................................... (13.93)

Vt = 621 BOPD + 521 BGPD + 2,300 BWPD, ................................. (13.94)

and

Vt = 3,442 BFPD . ........................................................ (13.95)

The ratio or percentage of free gas present at the pump intake to the total volume of fluid is

% free gas = Vg /Vt, ...................................................... (13.96)

and

% free gas = (521 BGPD / 3,442 BFPD) × 100 = 15% . ........................ (13.97)

As this value is greater than 10% by volume, there is significant free gas to affect pump perfor-
mance;  therefore,  it  is  recommended  that  a  gas  separator  be  installed.  Next,  we  must  assume
the gas separator’s efficiency. At 15% free gas, a 90% efficiency of separation is used on the
basis of the manufacturer’s gas-separator performance information.

The percentage of gas not separated is 10%.

Vg = volume of gas at PIP × % ingested, .................................... (13.98)

and

Vg = 521 B / D × 0.1 = 52 B / D . ............................................ (13.99)

Total volume of fluid mixture ingested into the pump is

Vo = 621 B / D, .......................................................... (13.100)

Vg = 52 B / D, ........................................................... (13.101)

Vw = 2,300 B / D, ........................................................ (13.102)

and

Vt = 2,973 B / D . ........................................................ (13.103)

The amount of free gas entering the first pump stage as a percent of the total fluid mixture is

% free gas = Vg /Vt, ..................................................... (13.104)

and

% free gas = (52 / 2,973) × 100 = 2%.

...................................... (13.105)

IV-706

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

As the free gas represents only 2% by volume of fluid being pumped, it has little significant
effect on the well fluid composite SG and may be ignored for conservative motor sizing.

Now  that  the  total  volume  of  fluid  entering  the  first  pump  stage  is  known  (2,973  BFPD)
and the composite SG has been determined, we can continue to the next step of designing the
ESP system.

13.6.4 Step 4: Total Dynamic Head.  Sufficient data are now available to determine the TDH
required  at  the  maximum  desired  flow  rate  (2,973  B/D).  The  TDH  for  the  minimum  desired
flow rate (2,550 B/D) was previously determined to be 3,556 ft.

TDH = HL + Ft + Hwh, .................................................... (13.106)

where  HL  =  the  vertical  distance  in  feet  between  the  estimated  producing  fluid  level  and  the
surface, and

HL = pump depth – (PIP × 2.31) / SG = 5,500 – (590 × 2.31) / 1.04

= 4,190 ft (1277 m) . ................................................... (13.107)

From Fig. 13.52, friction loss per 1,000 ft of 2⅞-in. tubing (new) is 60 ft/1,000 ft of depth at
2,973 B/D (405 m3/d), or 4.5 m/100 m. Using the desired pump setting depth,

Ft = (5,500 × 60) / 1,000 = 330 ft (100.6 m) . ................................. (13.108)

Hwh = the discharge pressure head (desired wellhead pressure). Using the composite SG,

Hwh = (100 × 2.31) / 1.02 = 226 ft (68.9 m), .................................. (13.109)

and

or

THD = 4,190 ft + 330 ft + 226 ft = 4,746 ft, ................................. (13.110)

1277 m + 100.6 m + 68.9 m = 1446.6 m . ................................... (13.111)

13.6.5 Step 5: Pump-Type Selection.  The hydraulic requirements for our variable speed pump-
ing system have been determined. Those requirements are the minimum hydraulic requirement
(flow rate 2,550 B/D; total dynamic head 3,556 ft) and maximum hydraulic requirement (flow
rate 2,973 B/D; total dynamic head 4,746 ft).

In the economic justification for using the VSC, the size of the downhole unit was deter-

mined. This was done using the guidelines discussed next.

As  the  operating  frequency  increases,  the  number  of  stages  required  to  generate  the  re-
quired  lift  decreases.  The  closer  the  operation  is  to  the  best  efficiency  point,  the  lower  the
power requirement and power cost.

A fixed frequency motor of a particular frame size has a maximum output torque, provided
that the specified voltage is supplied to its terminals. The same torque can be achieved at other
speeds by varying the voltage in proportion to the frequency. This way the magnetizing current
and flux density will remain constant, and so the available torque will be a constant (at no-slip
RPM). As a result, power output rating is directly proportional to speed because power rating

Chapter 13—Electrical Submersible Pumps

IV-707

is  obtained  by  multiplying  the  rated  torque  with  speed.  Using  the  variable-speed  performance
curves, select a pump that will fit in the casing so the maximum flow rate (2,973 B/D) falls at
its BEP. The GC-2200 satisfies these conditions at 81 Hz.

Next, select the head per stage from the curve. It indicates 86 ft/stage. With the maximum
TDH  requirement  of  4,746  ft,  the  number  of  pump  stages  required  can  be  determined.  The
number  of  stages  =  the  maximum  TDH  /head  per  stage  and  =  4,746  /86  =  55  stages.  A  55-
stage  GC-2200  meets  our  maximum  hydraulic  requirement.  To  determine  if  it  meets  our
minimum  hydraulic  requirement,  divide  the  minimum  TDH  requirement  by  the  number  of
stages. The minimum head per stage = 3,556 /55 = 64.7 ft/stage. Plotting the minimum head/
stage  (64.7  ft)  and  the  minimum  flow  rate  (2,550  B/D)  on  the  curve  indicates  an  operating
frequency of 70 Hz. Note, the minimum hydraulic requirement is also near the pump’s BEP.

Next,  using  the  VSC  curve  for  the  GC-2200  find  the  BHP/stage  at  the  60-Hz  BEP  (1.12

hp). To calculate the BHP at the maximum frequency use Eqs. 13.112 and 13.113.

BHP / stage × no. stages × (max . HP / 60 Hz) × SG, ........................... (13.112)

and

1.12 × 55 × (81 / 60)3 × 1.04 = 157.6 hp . .................................... (13.113)

Because a rotary gas separator was selected (which is a centrifugal machine using HP), it
will add additional load to the motor. The HP requirement also changes by the cube function.
Referring to the manufacturer’s information, the 513 series rotary gas separator requires 5 hp at
60 Hz.

HPseparator = 5 × (81 / 60)3 × 1.04 = 12.8 hp . ................................. (13.114)

Total  BHP  for  the  pump  and  separator  =  157.6  +  12.8  =  170.4  hp.  With  Eqs.  13.115  and
13.116, the equivalent 60-Hz BHP for both the pump and gas separator can be calculated:

60-Hz BHP = BHP at max . Hz × (60 Hz / max . Hz), ......................... (13.115)

or

60-Hz BHP = 170.4 × (60 / 81) = 126.2 hp . .................................. (13.116)

Select  the  appropriate  model  seal  section  and  determine  the  HP  requirement  at  the  maxi-
mum TDH requirement. Select a motor that is capable of supplying total HP requirements of
the  pump,  gas  separator,  and  seal.  In  this  example,  a  562  series  motor  with  130  hp;  2,145
volts; and 35 amps was selected.

Using  the  technical  data  provided  by  the  manufacturer,  determine  if  any  load  limitations
were  exceeded  (e.g.,  shaft  loading,  thrust  bearing  loading,  housing  burst  pressure  limitations,
fluid velocity passing the motor, etc.).

Next, select the power cable and calculate the cable voltage drop. On the basis of the mo-
tor current (35 amps) and the temperature (160°F), no. 6 cable can be used. Adding 200 ft for
surface connections, the cable voltage drop is written as

cable voltage drop = (24 V × 1.201 × 5,700) / 1,000 = 164 V . ................... (13.117)

We can now calculate the required surface voltage (SV) at the maximum operating frequency as

SV = motor volts × (max . Hz / 60 Hz) + voltage drop, ........................ (13.118)

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

IV-708

and

SV = 2,145 × (81 / 60) + 164 = 3,060 V.

.................................... (13.119)

Note  that  the  surface  voltage  is  greater  than  standard  3KV  cable.  Therefore,  4KV  or  higher
cable construction should be selected. Sufficient data are available to calculate KVA.

KVA = (SV × motor amps × 1.73) / 1,000, .................................... (13.120)

and

KVA = (3,060 × 35 × 1.73) / 1,000 = 185 KVA . ............................... (13.121)

Referring to the manufacturer’s catalog, select the model 2200-3VT, 200 KVA, NEMA3 (out-
door  enclosure)  VSC.  All  other  accessory  equipment  should  be  selected  as  in  the  previous
example.

Hydraulic Pumping in Oil Wells
James Fretwell, Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems

14.1 Introduction
Hydraulic pumping is a proven artificial-lift method that has been used since the early 1930s.
It offers several different systems for handling a variety of well conditions. Successful applica-
tions have included setting depths ranging from 500 to 19,000 ft and production rates varying
from less than 100 to 20,000 B/D. Surface packages are available using multiplex pumps rang-
ing  from  15  to  625  hp.  The  systems  are  flexible  because  the  downhole-pumping  rate  can  be
regulated over a wide range with fluid controls on the surface. Chemicals to control corrosion,
paraffin, and emulsions can be injected downhole with the power fluid, while fresh water can
also  be  injected  to  dissolve  salt  deposits.  When  pumping  heavy  crudes,  the  power  fluid  can
serve  as  an  effective  diluent  to  reduce  the  viscosity  of  the  produced  fluids.  The  power  fluid
also  can  be  heated  for  handling  heavy  or  low-pour-point  crudes.  Hydraulic  pumping  systems
are suitable for wells with deviated or crooked holes that can cause problems for other types of
artificial lift. The surface facilities can have a low profile and may be clustered into a central
battery to service numerous wells. This can be advantageous in urban sites, offshore locations,
areas requiring watering systems (sprinkle systems), and environmentally sensitive areas.

Hydraulic pumping systems transmit power downhole by means of pressurized power fluid
that  flows  in  wellbore  tubulars.  Hydraulic  transmission  of  power  downhole  can  be  accom-
plished with reasonably good efficiency using a reciprocating piston pump. With 30°API oil at
2,500 psi in 2⅞-in. tubing, 100 surface hydraulic horsepower can be transmitted to a depth of
8,000 ft with a flow rate of 2,350 B/D and a frictional pressure drop of less than 200 psi. Even
higher  efficiencies  can  be  achieved  with  water  as  the  hydraulic  medium  because  of  its  lower
viscosity.

The downhole pump acts a transformer to convert the energy into pressure in the produced
fluids. A common form of a hydraulic downhole pump consists of a set of coupled reciprocat-
ing pistons, one driven by the power fluid and the other pumping the well fluids. Another form
of a hydraulic downhole pump that has become more popular is the jet pump, which converts
the pressurized power fluid to a high-velocity jet that mixes directly with the well fluids.1,2 In
the  turbulent  mixing,  momentum  and  energy  from  the  power  fluid  are  added  to  the  produced
fluids.3,4  The  operating  pressures  in  hydraulic  pumping  systems  usually  range  from  2,000  to
4,000 psi. The most common pump used to generate this pressure on the surface is a multiplex
positive displacement pump driven by an electric motor or multicylinder gas or diesel engine.

Fig. 14.1—Schematic of a single-well hydraulic pumping system.

Multistage  centrifugal  pumps5  and  horizontal  electrical  submersible  pumps  (ESPs)  have  been
used,6  and  some  systems  have  been  operated  with  the  excess  capacity  in  water-injection
systems.7  The  hydraulic  fluid  usually  comes  from  the  well  and  can  be  either  produced  oil  or
water. A fluid reservoir at the surface provides surge capacity and is usually part of the clean-
ing system used to condition the well fluids for use as power fluid. Appropriate control valves
and piping complete the system. A schematic of a typical hydraulic pumping system is shown
in Fig. 14.1.

14.2 Downhole Pumps

14.2.1 Types of Installations.  The  two  basic  types  of  installations  are  the  “fixed”-pump  and
the “free”-pump design. In the fixed installation, the downhole pump is attached to the end of
a tubing string and run into the well. Free-pump installations are designed to allow the down-
hole pump to be circulated into and out of the well inside the power-fluid string, or it can also
be installed and retrieved by wireline operations.

14.2.2 Fixed-Pump Installations (Conventional Installations).  In the fixed-insert (or tubing-
conveyed) design, the pump typically lands on a seating-shoe in the larger tubing. Power fluid
is  normally  directed  down  the  inner  tubing  string,  and  the  produced  fluids  and  return  power
fluid flow to the surface inside the annulus between the two tubing strings, as shown in Part A
of  Fig.  14.2.  These  systems  provide  a  passage  for  free  gas  in  the  annular  space  between  the
outer  tubing  string  and  the  inside  of  the  well  casing,  but  to  take  full  advantage  of  this  gas-
venting  passage,  the  pump  should  be  set  below  the  perforations.  The  power-fluid  string  is
usually ¾-in., 1-in., or 1¼-in. nominal tubing or 1-in., 1¼-in. or 1½-in. coiled tubing. The fixed-
pump system is used mainly to fit a large-diameter downhole pump into restricted casing sizes
and still retain the gas-vent feature. It also can be used to lift one or both zones of a dual well
with parallel strings.

In the fixed-casing design, the tubing with the pump attached to its lower end is seated on
a packer, as shown in Part B of Fig.14.2. With this configuration, the power fluid is directed

down the tubing string, and the mixed power fluid and the produced well fluids return to the
surface  in  the  tubing/casing  annulus.  Because  the  well  fluids  enter  the  pump  from  below  a
packer, the pump must handle all the free gas. This type of installation is normally used with
large-diameter  high-capacity  pumps  in  wells  with  little  free  gas,  and  if  space  permits,  a  gas-
vent  string  can  be  run  from  below  the  packer  to  the  surface.  As  with  the  fixed-insert  design,
this installation is no longer common, and both have been largely supplanted by the various free-

pump installations. Note that in both of the fixed-type installations, when using a reciprocating
piston pump, the power fluid mixes with the produced fluid after passing through the pump.

14.2.3 Free-Pump Installations.  The free-pump feature is one of the most significant advan-
tages of hydraulic pumping systems. Free-pump installations permit circulating the pump to the
bottom,  producing  the  well,  and  circulating  the  pump  back  to  the  surface  for  repair  or  size
change. Fig. 14.3 shows pump in-and-out operations for a typical free-pump installation. They
require that a bottomhole assembly (BHA) be run in on the tubing string. The BHA consists of
a  seating  shoe  and  one  or  more  sealbores  above  it  and  serves  as  a  receptacle  for  the  pump
itself.  BHAs  are  of  robust  construction  and  use  corrosion-resistant  sealing  bores  to  ensure  a
long  life  in  the  downhole  environmental  conditions.  The  extensions  needed  on  the  BHA  also
can be adapted with different metallurgy to accommodate a changing environment. Once run in
on the tubing string, the BHA normally remains in place for years, even though the downhole
pump  may  be  circulated  in  and  out  numerous  times  for  repair  or  resizing.  As  shown  in  Fig.
14.4, a wireline-retrievable standing valve is landed in the seating shoe below the pump. The
pump  is  run  in  the  hole  by  placing  it  in  the  power-fluid  string  and  pumping  fluid  down  the
tubing. When the pump reaches bottom, it enters the sealbores, begins stroking or jetting, and
opens the standing valve. During normal pumping, this valve is held open by well fluid drawn
into  the  pump  suction.  During  pump-out,  the  normal  flow  of  fluids  is  reversed  at  the  surface
with  appropriate  valving  and  pressure  applied  to  the  discharge  flow  path  of  the  pump.  This
reversal of flow closes the standing valve and permits the pump to be circulated to the surface
—a  process  that  normally  takes  30  minutes  to  2  hours,  depending  on  depth,  tubing  size,  and
the circulating flow rate.

The benefits of being able to circulate the downhole pump in and out of the well include
reduced  downtime  and  the  ability  to  operate  without  a  pulling  unit  for  tubing,  cable,  or  rod
removal. Another significant advantage is that pressure and temperature recorders can be mount-
ed on the pump to monitor downhole conditions with different pumping rates. At the conclu-
sion of the test, circulating the pump to the surface also retrieves the recorder. Substituting a

dummy pump for the normal production unit can be used to check for leakage of tubing pres-
sure. Steaming, acidizing, or chemical treatment of the formation can be done if the pump is
circulated out and the standing valve retrieved on wireline. A flow-through blanking tool may
be  run  instead  of  the  pump  for  such  treatment  if  isolation  of  the  power  fluid  and  discharge
flow paths is desired.

The casing-free installation, shown in Part C of Fig. 14.2, is attractive from an initial cost
standpoint because it uses only one string of tubing. At first glance, it seems to be the same as
the fixed-casing design, but the crucial difference is that instead of being attached to the end of
the power-fluid string, the pump fits inside it to allow circulation into and out of the well. For
a given diameter pump, this requires a larger-diameter string that reduces the annular flow path
for the discharge fluids, but in most cases, a more than adequate flow area remains. Nominal
tubing as small as 1½ in. can be run in systems with 2⅞-in.-outside-diameter (OD) tubing used
as casing, and coiled tubing as small as 1¼ in. can be run in systems with 2⅜-in.-OD tubing
used as casing. In the 1½-in. and 1¼-in. nominal-size tubing, only the jet pump can be used,
while in 2⅜-in.-OD or larger tubing, either jet or reciprocating pumps are suitable. Usually, 2⅜-
in.-OD power-fluid tubing is used in 4½-in.-OD or larger casing, 2⅞-in.-OD tubing in 5½-in.-
OD casing or larger, and 3½-in.-OD tubing in 6⅝-in.-OD casing or larger. Because the BHA
sits  on  a  packer,  the  pump  must  handle  all  the  gas  from  the  well  in  addition  to  the  liquids,
even though a gas-vent string can be run if gas interference limits pump performance. In both
the vented and unvented systems, the power fluid mixes with the produced fluids and returns
to the surface. In wells where the produced fluid should be kept off the casing wall or where
gas  venting  is  desired,  the  parallel-free  installation  should  be  considered.  This  installation,
which  requires  two  parallel  tubing  strings,  normally  does  not  require  a  packer.  As  shown  in
Part D of Fig. 14.2, the BHA is suspended on the power-fluid string, and the return is either
screwed into the BHA or is run separately with a landing spear that enters a bowl above the
BHA.  The  tubing/casing  annulus  serves  as  a  gas  vent  passage,  and  to  take  full  advantage  of
this, the unit should be set below the perforations. In wells with corrosive gas and/or liquid, it
may be undesirable to use the casing for return of gas or to have the liquid in the casing annu-

IV-718

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

lus. In such cases, a packer can be installed; however, the pump must handle all the gas and
produced liquids.

14.2.4 Open and Closed Power-Fluid Systems.  All installations discussed so far are open power-
fluid  (OPF)  types,  which  means  that  all  the  power  fluid  and  the  produced  fluid  are  mixed
together after leaving the downhole pump and return to the surface together in a common flow
passage. Jet pumps are inherently OPF pumps because the energy transfer depends on mixing
the  power  fluid  with  the  produced  fluid.  All  reciprocating  piston  pumps  (not  jets)  keep  the
power and produced fluids separate during the energy transfer process because there is a sepa-
rate piston for each fluid. If the BHA has appropriate sealbores and passages to keep the two
fluids separated, the power fluid can return to the surface in a separate tubing string, thus creat-
ing a closed power-fluid system.

14.2.5 Reverse-Flow Systems.  Considerations for a reverse-flow system for a jet-pump instal-
lation  are  the  need  to  keep  produced  fluid  off  the  casing,  help  minimize  fluid  friction  losses,
and aid in drillstem testing or unloading of wells. A reverse-flow installation is shown in Fig.
14.5.  It  uses  the  tubing/casing  annulus  for  power  fluid  and  the  tubing  string,  which  contains
the pump, and is used for the combined power fluid and production. This protects the casing
with inhibited power fluid and is most useful when severe corrosion is anticipated. In perma-
nent installations, heavy wall casing should be a consideration to avoid casing burst conditions
when  power-fluid  pressure  is  applied.  In  reverse-flow  installations,  the  pump  is  run  and  re-
trieved on wireline in most cases but can be pumped in and out with a pusher-type locomotive.

14.2.6 Dual Wells.  Hydraulic pumps lend themselves to solution of the complex problem of
the production of two separate zones or reservoirs in a single wellbore. To meet the artificial-
lift requirements of the two distinct zones, two downhole pumps are usually required. It would
be highly unusual if the same power-fluid pressure and rate were required for each zone; conse-
quently,  a  separate  power-fluid  line  for  each  pump  is  usually  required.  A  number  of  comple-
tion configurations are possible, but small casing sizes and high gas/liquid ratios may severely
hinder dual-well operation.

14.3 Principles of Operation

14.3.1 Reciprocating Pumps.  The  pump  end  of  a  hydraulic  downhole  pump  is  similar  to  a
sucker-rod pump because it uses a rod-actuated plunger (also called the pump piston) and two
or more check valves. The pump can be either single-acting or double-acting. A single-acting
pump closely follows rod-pump design practices and is called single-acting because it displaces
fluid on either the upstroke or downstroke (but not both). An example is shown schematically
in Fig. 14.6. Fig. 14.7 shows a double-acting pump that has suction and discharge valves for
both  sides  of  the  plunger,  which  enables  it  to  displace  fluids  to  the  surface  on  both  the  up-
stroke and downstroke. With either system, motion of the plunger away from a suction valve
lowers the pressure that holds the valve closed; it opens as the pressure drops, and well fluids
are allowed to enter the barrel or cylinder. At the end of the stroke, the plunger reverses, forc-
ing the suction valve to close and opening the discharge valving.

In a sucker-rod installation, the rod that actuates the pump plunger extends to the surface of
the well and connects to the pumping unit; however, in hydraulic pumps, the rod is quite short
and extends only to the engine pistons. The engine piston is constructed similarly to the pump
plunger and is exposed to the power-fluid supply that is under the control of the engine valve.
The engine valve reverses the flow of the power fluid on alternate half-strokes and causes the
engine piston to reciprocate back and forth. Four-way engine valves are used with engines that
switch from high-pressure to low-pressure power-fluid exhaust on both sides of the engine pis-

ton  in  an  alternate  manner.  These  engine  (or  reversing)  valves  are  used  with  double-acting
pump ends to give equal force on both upstroke and downstroke. Three-way engine valves are
used with unequal-area engine pistons that always have high-pressure power fluid on one side
and switch the power-fluid from high to low pressure on the other face of the piston. This type
of reversing valve is commonly used with single-acting pumps that do not require a high force
on the half-stroke because it is not displacing produced fluid to the surface. An example of this
type of engine attached to a single-acting pump is illustrated in Fig. 14.8.

The engine or reversing valve can be activated by several methods. Commonly, ports on a
rod direct pressure to control the engine valve at the extremes of the upstroke and downstroke,

causing the valve to shift hydraulically. The shifting of the engine valve redirects the flow of
power fluid to the engine piston and causes the reversal of the rod-and-plunger system. Alterna-
tively, the engine can be mechanically “bumped” from one position to the other by the rod and
plunger system as it nears the end of the upstroke and downstroke. Combinations of mechani-

cal and hydraulic shifting are possible, and the engine valve may be located above the rod-and-
plunger system, in the middle of the pump, or in the engine piston.

Note  that  the  two  designs  illustrated  and  discussed  do  not  exhaust  the  design  possibilities
offered  by  the  various  pump  manufacturers;  many  combinations  are  possible,  and  tandem
pumps or engine sections are sometimes advantageous. Examples of combinations of these de-
sign  concepts  can  be  seen  in  the  cross-section  schematics  of  the  various  pump  types  that
accompany  the  pump  specifications  in  Tables  14.1  through  14.3,  which  show  the  producing
abilities  and  other  factors  that  should  be  considered  in  designing  reciprocating  pumps.  In  the
past,  many  tables  were  used  in  choosing  the  correct  pump  for  the  application,  but  today,  the

use of computers eliminates the errors inherent in reading charts and tables, making the process
much simpler. Common to all designs, however, is the concept of a reversing valve that causes
an  engine  piston  (or  pistons)  to  reciprocate  back  and  forth,  stroking  the  pump  plunger  (or
plungers) that lifts fluid from the well.

Chapter 14—Hydraulic Pumping in Oil Wells

IV-723

Because  the  engine  and  pump  are  closely  coupled  into  one  unit,  the  stroke  length  can  be
controlled accurately; thus, the unswept area or clearance volume at each end of the stroke can
be  kept  very  small,  leading  to  high  compression  ratios.  This  is  very  important  when  gas  is
present, and it generally prevents gas locking in hydraulic pumps. The engine valves and their
switching  mechanisms  usually  include  controls  to  provide  a  smooth  reversal  and  to  limit  the
plunger  speed  under  unloaded  conditions.  The  unloaded  plunger  speed  control  is  often  called
“governing” and minimizes fluid pound when the pump is not fully loaded with liquid. In this
way,  shock  loads  in  the  pump,  as  well  as  water  hammer  in  the  tubing  strings,  are  softened,
which  reduces  stress  and  increases  life.  (Caution:  high  pump  speeds,  at  or  above  the  rating,
may significantly shorten piston pump run lives.)

14.3.2 Jet  Pumps.    Jet  pumps  are  a  type  of  downhole  pump  that  can  be  used  in  hydraulic
pumping systems instead of the reciprocating piston pumps previously discussed. They can be
adapted to fit interchangeably into the BHAs designed for the stroking pumps. In addition, spe-
cial BHAs have been designed for jet pumps to take advantage of their short length and their
high-volume characteristics. Because of their unique characteristics under different pumping con-
ditions, jet pumps should be considered as an alternative to the conventional stroking pumps.

Although technical references to jet pumps can be found as far back as 1852,8 it was not
until  19339  that  a  consistent  mathematical  representation  was  published  that  included  sugges-
tions for pumping oil wells.10 Angier and Crocker11 applied for a patent on an oilwell jet pump
in  1864  that  looked  very  much  like  those  currently  marketed.  Jacuzzi12  received  a  patent  in
1930  for  jet  pumps  that  were  subsequently  used  in  shallow  water  wells  successfully.  McMa-
hon13 also received the first of six patents on oilwell jet pumps in 1930. Apparently McMahon
built and marketed pumps in California in the late 1930s, but they did not achieve widespread
use. Hardware improvements and the advent of computer models for correct applications sizing
in oil wells led to the successful marketing of jet pumps in 1970, and the use of jet pumps has
grown steadily since then. More recent publications on hydraulic pumping that describe the use
of  jet  pumps  in  oil  wells  include  those  by  Wilson,  Bell  and  Spisak,  Christ  and  Zublin,
Nelson,14  Brown,15  Clark,16  Bleakley,17  and  Petrie  et  al.18  Much  of  the  following  discussion
derives from Refs. 15, 18, and 19.

An  example  of  the  simplest  downhole  jet  free-pump  completion,  the  single-seal  style,  is
shown in Fig. 14.9. The most significant feature of this device is that it has no moving parts;
the pumping action is achieved through energy transfer between two moving streams of fluid.
The high-pressure power fluid, supplied from the surface, passes through the nozzle, where its
potential  energy  (pressure)  is  converted  to  kinetic  energy  in  the  form  of  a  very-high-velocity
jet of fluid. Well fluids surround the power-fluid jet at the tip of the nozzle, which is spaced
back  from  the  entrance  of  the  mixing  tube.  The  mixing  tube,  usually  called  the  throat,  is  a
straight,  cylindrical  bore  about  seven  diameters  long  with  a  smoothed  radius  at  the  entrance.
The diameter of the throat is always larger than the diameter of the nozzle exit, allowing the

Chapter 14—Hydraulic Pumping in Oil Wells

IV-725

well  fluids  to  flow  around  the  power-fluid  jet  and  be  entrained  by  it  into  the  throat.  In  the
throat, the power fluid and produced fluid mix, and momentum is transferred from the power
fluid to the produced fluid, causing its energy to rise. By the end of the throat, the two fluids
are intimately mixed, but they are still at a high velocity, and the mixture contains significant
kinetic energy. The mixed fluid enters an expanding area diffuser that converts the remaining
kinetic energy to static pressure by slowing down the fluid velocity. The pressure in the fluid
is now sufficiently high to flow it to the surface from the downhole pump.

With  no  moving  parts,  jet  pumps  are  rugged  and  tolerant  of  corrosive  and  abrasive  well
fluids. The nozzle and throat are usually constructed of tungsten carbide or ceramic materials
for  long  life.  Successful  jet-pump  adaptations  have  also  been  made  for  sliding  side  doors  in
both the normal and reverse-flow configurations. These are normally run in on wireline or as a
fixed or conventional installation on continuous coiled tubing and have been successful in off-
shore drillstem testing (DST) of heavy-crude reservoirs. Other applications include the dewater-
ing of gas wells.20

With  different  sizes  of  nozzles  and  throats,  jet  pumps  can  produce  wells  at  less  than  50
B/D or in excess of 15,000 B/D. To achieve high rates, a special BHA is required as the BHA
itself is used as a crossover for the production, allowing for larger passages for the produced
fluid to travel to the jet nozzle as shown in Fig. 14.10. As with all hydraulic pumping systems,
a considerable range of production is possible from a particular downhole pump by controlling
the power-fluid supply at the surface, but for any given size of tubing, the maximum achiev-
able  rates  are  usually  much  higher  than  those  possible  with  stroking  pumps.  Significant  free-
gas  volumes  can  be  handled  without  the  problems  of  pounding  or  excessive  wear  associated
with positive-displacement pumps, or the inlet choking encountered in centrifugal pumps. The

lack of vibration and the free-pump feature make them ideal for use with pumpdown pressure
recorders to monitor BHPs at different flow rates.

Because  they  are  high-velocity  mixing  devices,  there  is  significant  turbulence  and  friction
within the pump, leading to lower horsepower efficiencies than achieved with positive-displace-
ment pumps. This often leads to higher surface horsepower requirements, although some gassy
wells  may  actually  require  less  pressure.  Jet  pumps  are  prone  to  cavitation  at  the  entrance  of

the  throat  at  low  pump  intake  pressures,  and  this  must  be  considered  in  design  calculations.
Also,  because  of  the  nature  of  their  performance  curves,  the  calculations  used  for  installation
design  are  complex  and  iterative  in  nature  and  are  best  handled  by  computers.  Their  overall
energy  efficiencies  are  low,  which  may  lead  to  high  energy  costs;  despite  these  limitations,
their  reliability,  low  maintenance  costs,  and  volume  capability  make  them  attractive  in  many
wells, and their use has increased since commercial introduction in the early 1970s.

14.3.3 Performance  Characteristics.    Intuitively,  larger-diameter  nozzles  and  throats  would
seem to have higher flow capacities, and this is normally the case. The ratio of the nozzle area
to the throat area is an important variable because it determines the trade-off between produced
head and flow rate. Fig. 14.11 shows a schematic of the working section of a jet pump. If, for
a given nozzle, a throat is selected such that the area of the nozzle, An, is 60% of the area of
the throat, At, a relatively high-head, low-flow pump will result. There is a comparatively small
area, As, around the jet for well fluids to enter. This leads to low production rates compared to
the power-fluid rate, and because the energy of the nozzle is transferred to a small amount of
production, high heads develop. Such a pump is suited for deep wells with high lifts, and sub-
stantial  production  rates  can  be  achieved  if  the  pump  is  physically  large,  but  the  production
rate will always be less than the power-fluid rate.

If a throat is selected such that the area of the nozzle is only 20% of the area of the throat,
much more flow area around the jet is available for the production. However, because the noz-
zle  energy  is  transferred  to  a  large  amount  of  production  compared  to  the  power-fluid  rate,
lower heads will be developed. Shallow wells with low lifts are candidates for such a pump.

Any number of such area combinations is possible to match different flow and lift require-
ments.  Attempting  to  produce  small  amounts  of  production  compared  to  the  power-fluid  rate

Chapter 14—Hydraulic Pumping in Oil Wells

IV-729

with nozzle/throat-area ratio of 20% will be inefficient because of high-turbulent mixing losses
between the high-velocity jet and the slow-moving production. Conversely, attempting to pro-
duce high production rates compared to the power-fluid rate with a nozzle/throat-area ratio of
60%  will  be  inefficient  because  of  high  friction  losses  as  the  produced  fluid  moves  rapidly
through  the  relatively  small  throat.  Optimal  ratio  selection  involves  a  trade-off  between  these
mixing and friction losses.

As a type of dynamic pump, the jet pump has characteristic performance curves similar to
those of an ESP. A family of performance curves is possible, depending on the nozzle pressure
supplied  to  the  pump  from  the  surface.  Different  sizes  of  throats  used  in  conjunction  with  a
given nozzle size give different performance curves. The curves are generally fairly flat, espe-
cially  with  the  larger  throats,  which  makes  the  jet  pump  sensitive  to  changes  in  intake  or
discharge pressure. Because variable fluid mixture densities, gas/liquid ratios, and viscosity af-
fect  the  pressures  encountered  by  the  pump,  the  calculations  to  simulate  performance  are
complex and iterative in nature and lend themselves to a computer solution.

14.3.4 Cavitation in Jet Pumps.  Because the production must accelerate to a fairly high veloc-
ity  (200  to  300  ft/sec)  to  enter  the  throat,  cavitation  is  a  potential  problem.  The  throat  and
nozzle flow areas define an annular flow passage at the entrance of the throat. The smaller this
area is, the higher the velocity is of a given amount of produced fluid passing through it. The
static pressure of the fluid drops as the square of the velocity increases, declining to the vapor
pressure of the fluid at high velocities. This low pressure causes vapor cavities to form, a pro-
cess called cavitation. This results in choked flow into the throat, and production increases are
not  possible  at  that  pump-intake  pressure,  even  if  the  power-fluid  rate  and  pressure  are  in-
creased.  Subsequent  collapse  of  the  vapor  cavities,  as  pressure  is  built  up  in  the  pump,  may
cause  erosion  known  as  cavitation  damage.  Thus,  for  a  given  production  flow  rate  and  pump
intake  pressure,  there  is  a  minimum  annular  flow  area  required  to  keep  the  velocity  low
enough to avoid cavitation. This phenomenon has been the subject of numerous investigations—
the  most  notable  being  that  of  Cunningham  and  Brown,21  who  used  actual  oilwell  pump  de-
signs at the high pressures used in deep wells.

The description of the cavitation phenomenon suggests that if the production flow rate ap-
proaches  zero,  the  potential  for  cavitation  will  disappear  because  the  fluid  velocities  are  very
low. Under these conditions, however, the velocity difference between the power-fluid jet and
the slow-moving production is at a maximum, which creates an intense shear zone on the bound-
ary  between  them,  generating  vortices,  the  cores  of  which  are  at  a  reduced  pressure.  Vapor
cavities  may  form  in  the  vortex  cores,  leading  to  erosion  of  the  throat  walls  as  the  bubbles
collapse because of vortex decay and pressure rises in the pump. Although no theoretical treat-
ments of this phenomenon have been published, it has been the subject of experimental work,
which has led to the inclusion, by suppliers, of potential damage zones on their published per-
formance prediction plots. This experimental correlation predicts cavitation damage at low flow
rates and low pump-intake pressures before the choked flow condition occurs. Field experience
has  shown,  however,  that  in  most  real  oil  wells,  the  erosion  rate  in  this  operating  region  is
very low, probably because of produced gas cushioning the system by reducing the propagation
velocity of the bubble-collapse shock waves. It is generally agreed that this phenomenon is of
concern  only  in  very-high-water-cut  wells  with  virtually  no  gas  present.  Under  these  condi-
tions, cavitation erosion has been observed even at very low production rates; however, if a jet
pump is operated near its best efficiency point, the shear vortices are a distinctly second-order
effect in the cavitation process.

14.3.5 Nozzle and Throat Sizes.  Each  manufacturer  has  different  sizes  and  combinations  of
nozzles and throats. Manufacturers A and B increase the areas of nozzles and throats in a geo-
metric progression (i.e., the flow area of any nozzle or throat is a constant multiple of the area

IV-730

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

of  the  next  smaller  size).  Manufacturer  B’s  factor  is  1.29155,  and  Manufacturer  A’s  factor  is
4/π = 1.27324. The system of sizes offered by Manufacturer C uses a similar geometric progres-
sion concept but does not use the same factor over the total range. In the smaller sizes, where
the change in horsepower per size is small, the rate of increase in area is more rapid than in
the systems of Manufacturers A and B. In the larger, higher-horsepower sizes, the percent in-
crease  in  size  is  less  rapid  than  in  the  other  systems  to  limit  the  incremental  increase  in
horsepower.  The  sizes  offered  by  Manufacturer  C  cover  a  slightly  larger  range  than  those  of
Manufacturers A and B. The sizes from these manufacturers are listed in Table 14.4. The max-
imum sizes of nozzles and throats that are practical in pumps for a given tubing size depend
on the fluid passages of the particular pump, BHA, swab nose, and standing valve. Single-seal
pumps  cannot  use  nozzles  as  large  as  those  practical  in  higher-flow,  multiple-seal  pumps.  In
general, nozzles larger than 0.035 in.2 in flow area are used only in pumps for 2½- and 3½-in.
tubing.

Chapter 14—Hydraulic Pumping in Oil Wells

IV-731

The strict progression used by Manufacturers A and B establishes fixed area ratios between
the nozzles and different throats. A given nozzle matched with the same number throat always
gives  the  same  area  ratio:  0.380  in  Manufactures  A’s  system  and  0.400  in  Manufacturer  B’s
system (Table 14.4). This is called the A ratio. Successively larger throats matched with a giv-
en nozzle give the B, C, D, and E ratios. In the systems of Manufacturers A and B, the nozzle
size and ratio designate the size of a pump. Examples are 11-B, which is a No. 11 nozzle and
a No. 12 throat, and 6-A, which is a No. 6 nozzle and a No. 6 throat.

Because the size progression for the nozzles and throats in Manufacturer C’s system is not
constant over the whole range, the nozzle/throat combinations do not yield fixed ratios. Howev-
er, the ratios that result cover the same basic range as the other two systems. The actual ratios
are listed in Table 14.5. In Manufacturer C’s system, the nozzle and mixing tube (throat) sizes
designate the size of a pump. An example is C-5, which are the size C nozzle and the No. 5
throat. This combination has an area ratio of 0.32. The annular flow areas of Manufacturer C’s
jet pumps used in cavitation calculations are also included in Table 14.6. The annular areas for
Manufacturers A and B’s jet pumps are listed in Tables 14.6 and 14.7.

The most commonly used area ratios fall between 0.235 and 0.400. Area ratios greater than
0.400  are  sometimes  used  in  very  deep  wells  with  high  lifts  or  when  only  very  low  surface
operating  pressures  are  available  and  a  high  head  regain  is  necessary.  Area  ratios  less  than
0.235 are used in shallow wells or when very low BHPs require a large annular flow passage
to avoid cavitation. The smaller area ratios develop less head but may produce more fluid than
is used for power fluid (FmfD > 1.0). Where the curves for different area ratios cross, the ratios
have  equal  production  and  efficiency;  however,  different  annular  flow  areas  (As)  may  give
them different cavitation characteristics.

14.3.6 Jet-Pump Application Sizing.  The widespread current use of jet pumps can be credit-
ed to the advent of computer programs capable of making the iterative calculations necessary

IV-732

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

for application design. Jet-pump performance depends largely on the pump discharge pressure,
which  in  turn  is  strongly  influenced  by  the  gas/liquid  ratio,  FgL;  in  the  return  column  to  the
surface, higher values of FgL lead to reduced pump discharge pressure. Because the jet pump is

Chapter 14—Hydraulic Pumping in Oil Wells

IV-733

inherently  an  OPF  device,  FgL  depends  on  the  formation  gas/oil  ratio  (GOR)  and  on  the
amount  of  power-fluid  mixed  with  the  production,  which  in  turn  depends  on  the  size  of  the
nozzle and the operating pressure. As the power-fluid pressure is increased, the lift capability
of the pump increases, but the additional power-fluid rate decreases FgL, thereby increasing the
effective lift. Finding a match between the power-fluid rate, the pump performance curve and
the pump discharge pressure, p, is an iterative procedure involving successive refined guesses.

The  various  suppliers  of  jet  pumps  also  have  developed  in-house  computer  programs  for
application design that are faster than the past calculator routines and incorporate more correla-
tion  for  fluid  properties  and  the  pump  discharge  pressure.  The  object  of  the  calculation

IV-734

sequence is to superimpose a jet-pump performance curve on the inflow performance relation-
ship (IPR) curve of the well and to note the intersections that represent the pump performance
in that particular well. Therefore, a plot of the best estimate of the IPR or productivity index
(PI) curve of the well is the starting point. An example of a completed performance plot in this
format is shown in Fig. 14.12.

14.3.7 Calculation Sequence and Supplemental Equations.  Fig.  14.13  shows  a  typical  jet-
pump  installation  with  the  appropriate  pressures  that  determine  pump  operation.  Although  a
parallel  installation  is  shown  for  clarity  of  nomenclature,  the  same  relationships  hold  for  the
casing-type installation.

14.4 Downhole Pump Accessories

14.4.1 Swab Cups.  A number of accessories are available for downhole pumping systems. Free-
pump systems require swab cups and a standing valve to accomplish the pump-in and pump-
out operations. The swab cups are carried on a mandrel, extending above the pump, which may
contain  a  check  valve  to  limit  the  amount  of  fluid  by  passing  the  pump  as  it  is  circulated  to
the surface. If the pump does not enter a lubricator on the wellhead, the check valve may in-
clude  a  valve  bypass  that  is  actuated  when  the  pump  enters  the  wellhead  catcher  to  prevent
excessive pressure buildup. Two examples of swab cup assemblies are shown in Fig. 14.14. Jet
pumps usually use the simpler system.

Chapter 14—Hydraulic Pumping in Oil Wells

IV-735

Fig. 14.13—Schematic for jet pumping.

14.4.2 Standing Valves.  Standing valves are necessary in free-pump systems to create a “U”
tube  and  prevent  the  circulating  fluid  from  flowing  back  into  the  reservoir.  During  pumping
operations, the standing valve is opened by flow from the formation to the pump suction; when-
ever the pump is shut down, the standing valve closes. In some cases, the standing-valve ball
is held open by a small magnet to prevent it from cycling during reciprocating pump-stroking
reversals. When the downhole pump is unseated, fluids attempting to flow back into the forma-
tion wash the ball off the magnet and onto the seat. The standing valve is wireline-retrievable
and includes a provision for draining the tubing before attempting to pull it. In most cases, the
standing  valve  forms  the  no-go  and  bottom  seal  for  the  pump.  Some  jet-pump  installations,
however, use high-flow designs that do not serve as a pump seat. An example of each type is
shown in Fig. 14.15.

14.4.3 Pressure Recorders.  To  obtain  producing  BHPs  at  several  different  withdrawal  rates,
downhole  pressure  recorders  are  often  run  in  conjunction  with  hydraulic  pumps,  hung  below
the standing valve. While this arrangement provides not only pressure drawdown but also pres-
sure-buildup  data,  it  has  the  disadvantage  of  requiring  wireline  operations  to  run  and  retrieve
the  recorder.  Some  reciprocating  pumps  can  be  run  with  a  pressure  recorder  attached,  which
eliminates the wireline operations but does not permit observation of pressure buildup because
the  recorder  is  above  the  standing  valve.  Virtually  all  jet  pumps  can  be  run  with  recorders
attached, and very smooth recordings are obtained.

14.4.4 Dummy Pumps.  Dummy  pumps  are  sometimes  run  to  blank  off  one  or  more  tubing
strings  so  that  they  may  be  checked  for  leaks.  If  the  dummy  pump  has  a  fluid  passage  in  it,
the terms “flow-through dummy” or “blanking tool” are often used. These tools are useful for
acidizing or steaming.

IV-736

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 14.14—Hydraulic pump swab cup assemblies.

14.4.5 Screens  and  Filters.    To  protect  the  downhole  pump  from  trash  in  the  well,  various
types of screens and filters are sometimes run. Because circulating pumps in and out of a well
may dislodge scale and corrosion products in the tubing, a starting filter can be attached to the
swab-cup  assembly  to  filter  the  power  fluid.  Because  this  must  be  a  relatively  small  filter,  it
will eventually plug up, and an automatic bypass arrangement is provided. This system collects
foreign  material  during  the  crucial  startup  phase  with  a  newly  installed  pump.  For  long-term

operation, power-fluid and pump intake screens or strainers are used, which exclude large-diam-
eter objects that could damage or plug the pump.

14.4.6 Safety Valves.  In some areas, subsurface safety valves are required. When a packer is
set  and  the  BHA  is  above  it,  a  wireline-retrievable  safety  valve  can  be  installed  between  the
standing  valve  and  the  packer  to  isolate  the  formation.  The  safety  valve  is  normally  closed

IV-738

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

unless the pump supplies high-pressure fluid to it by way of a control line run from the main
power-fluid tubing just above. The pump discharge pressure provides the reference pressure to
the  safety  valve.  When  the  pump  is  on  bottom  and  power-fluid  pressure  is  applied  to  it,  the
safety  valve  opens  to  allow  well  fluid  to  enter  the  pump.  Most  safety  valves  will  not  hold
pressure  from  above,  so  the  standing  valve  is  still  necessary  for  circulating  the  pump  in  and
out of the well. Fig. 14.16 illustrates this type of installation.

14.5 Surface Equipment

14.5.1 Surface Pumps.  Hydraulic pumping systems have evolved toward the use of relatively
high  pressures  and  low  flow  rates  to  reduce  friction  losses  and  to  increase  the  lift  capability
and  efficiency  of  the  system.  Surface  operating  pressures  are  generally  between  2,000  and
4,000  psi,  with  the  higher  pressures  used  in  deeper  wells,  and  power-fluid  rates  may  range
from a few hundred to more than 3,000 B/D. While some surface multistage centrifugal pumps
are  rated  to  this  pressure  range,  they  are  generally  quite  inefficient  at  the  modest  flow  rates
associated  with  single-well  applications.  Multistage  centrifugals  can  be  used  effectively  when
multiple wells are pumped from a central location. The surface pump for a single well or for
just  a  few  wells  must  be  a  high-head  and  low-specific-speed  pump.  Wide  experience  in  the
overall  pumping  industry  has  led  to  the  use  of  positive-displacement  pumps  for  this  type  of
application, and triplex or quintuplex pumps, driven by gas engines or electric motors, power
the vast majority of hydraulic pump installations. See Fig. 14.17.

Multiplex  pumps  consist  of  a  power  end  and  a  fluid  end.  The  power  end  houses  a
crankshaft in a crankcase. The connecting rods are similar to those in internal combustion en-
gines,  but  connect  to  crossheads  instead  of  pistons.  The  fluid  end  houses  individual  plungers,
each with intake and discharge check valves usually spring loaded, and is attached to the pow-
er end by the spacer block, which houses the intermediate rods and provides a working space
for access to the plunger system. Most units being installed in the oil field are of the horizontal
configuration, which minimizes contamination of the crankcase oil with leakage from the fluid
end. Vertical installations are still found, however, particularly with oil as the pumped fluid or
when space is at a premium, as in townsite leases.

Multiplex pumps applied to hydraulic pumping usually have stroke lengths from 2 to 7 in.
and plunger diameters between 1 and 2½ in. The larger plungers provide higher flow rates but
are generally rated at lower maximum pressure because of crankshaft loading limitations. The
larger  plungers  provide  higher  flow  rates,  but  are  generally  rated  at  lower  maximum  pressure
because of crankshaft loading limitations. The normal maximum rating of multiplexes for con-
tinuous  duty  in  hydraulic  pumping  applications  is  5,000  psi,  with  lower  ratings  for  the  larger
plungers,  but  applications  above  4,000  psi  are  uncommon.  Multiplex  pumps  are  run  at  low
speed  to  minimize  vibration  and  wear  and  to  avoid  dynamic  problems  with  the  spring-loaded
intake and discharge valves. Most applications fall between 200 and 450 rev/min, and because
this  is  below  the  speeds  of  gas  engines  or  electric  motors,  some  form  of  speed  reduction  is
usually required. Belt drives are found on some units, although gear reduction is more common
while gear-reduction units are integral to some multiplexes and separate on others. A variety of
reduction  ratios  are  offered  for  each  series  of  pumps.  Because  a  positive-displacement  pump
has  an  essentially  constant  discharge  flow  rate  for  a  given  prime-mover  speed,  bypass  of  ex-
cess  fluid  normally  is  used  to  match  a  particular  pressure  and  flow  demand.  Another  option
that has been used successfully is to drive the multiplex pump through a four-speed transmis-
sion, which greatly enhances the flexibility of the system. This allows much closer tailoring of
the triplex output to the demand, thereby pumping at reduced speed when needed, which also
tends to increase the life of such components as the packing and valving.

Fig. 14.16—Safety valve.

Each  plunger  pumps  individually  from  a  common  intake  manifold  into  a  common  dis-
charge, and because discharge occurs only on the upstroke, there is some pulsation, for which
pulsation dampers are commonly used.

IV-740

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 14.17—Horizontal plunger pumps.

Two types of plunger systems are in common use. For oil service, a simple and effective
plunger-and-liner system is used that consists of a closely fitted metallic plunger inside a metal-
lic liner. Sprayed metal coatings or other hard-facing means are often used to extend the life of
the plunger and liner. When pumping water, the metal-to-metal system is not practical because
the  fit  would  have  to  be  extremely  close  to  keep  leakage  to  an  acceptable  level.  Galling  and
scoring are problems with close fits and the low lubricity of water, and to solve this problem,
spring-loaded  packing  systems  are  used  that  do  not  require  adjusting.  The  advent  of  high-
strength  aramid  fibers  for  packing,  in  conjunction  with  other  compounds  to  improve  the
friction characteristics, has resulted in a pronounced improvement in the ability of the pump to
handle  high-pressure  water  for  extended  periods  of  time.  Water  still  presents  a  more  severe
challenge than oil, however, and water systems show much better life if operated at or below
3,500 psi.

Suction conditions are important to multiplex operation. Friction losses in piping, fluid end
porting, and across the suction valving reduce the pressure available to fill the pumping cham-
ber on the plunger downstroke, and if these losses are sufficiently great, cavitation may result.
When pumping oil with dissolved gas, the reduction in pressure liberates free gas and causes
knocking, so it is necessary to have a positive head on the suction side to overcome the fric-
tion losses. In addition, another phenomenon known as “acceleration head” must be considered.
The  flow  in  the  suction  piping  must  accelerate  and  decelerate  a  number  of  times  for  each
crankshaft revolution. For the fluid (which has inertia) to follow the acceleration, energy must
be  supplied,  which  is  then  returned  to  the  fluid  on  deceleration.  The  energy  supplied  during
acceleration  comes  from  a  reduction  in  the  pressure  in  the  fluid,  and  if  this  drops  too  low,
cavitation  or  gas  liberation  will  result.  The  minimum  suction  head  for  the  multiplex  pump  is
then the sum of the friction losses and the acceleration head. Although the pump can draw a
vacuum, this will flash gas and may tend to suck air across the valve or plunger packing. Man-
ufacturers  of  multiplex  pumps  recommend  appropriate  suction  charging  pressures  for  their
products, but it is worth noting that long, small-diameter suction lines increase the acceleration

Chapter 14—Hydraulic Pumping in Oil Wells

head  loss  and  friction  loss.  It  is  therefore  recommended  for  suction  lines  to  be  short  and  of
large diameter, with no high spots to trap air or gas. Suction stabilizers or pulsation dampeners
that tend to absorb the pulsations from the pump also reduce acceleration head, and users are
encouraged to follow good piping practices in the installation of surface pumps.

In many cases, sufficient hydrostatic head is not available to provide the necessary suction
pressure,  and  charge  pumps  are  used  to  overcome  this  problem.  Positive  displacement  pumps
of the vane or crescent-gear type driven from the triplex have been used extensively, but they
require a  pressure-control  valve to  bypass  excess  fluid  and  match the  multiplex displacement.
Where electric power is available, centrifugal charge pumps have given excellent service. Cen-
trifugal pumps generally need to run at speeds considerably above the multiplex speed, and so
driving them from the multiplex presents problems, particularly with a gas engine drive where
prime-mover speed variations cause significant variations in the charge-pump output pressure.

While  good  charging  pressures  are  necessary  to  ensure  proper  loading  and  smooth  opera-
tion,  there  are  problems  associated  with  very  high  charge  pressures.  These  add  to  the
crankshaft loading, and for charge pressures above about 250 psi, it is advisable to derate the
maximum  discharge  pressure  by  one  third  of  the  charge  pressure.  High  charge  pressures  also
can adversely affect the lubrication of bearings, particularly in the crosshead wristpin. In addi-
tion, the mechanical efficiency of multiplex pumps is some 3 to 5% lower on the suction side
compared to the discharge side.22 Consequently, the combination of a charge pump and multi-
plex  pump  is  most  efficient  with  low  charging  pressures  and  a  high  boost  by  the  multiplex
pump.  The  charging  pressure  should  therefore  be  limited  to  that  necessary  to  give  complete
filling  of  the  multiplex  pump  with  a  moderate  safety  allowance  for  variations  in  the  system
parameters.

In some cases, it is desirable to inject corrosion inhibitors or lubricants into the multiplex
suction,  and  fresh  water  is  sometimes  injected  to  dissolve  high  salt  concentrations.  In  severe
pumping applications with low-lubricity fluids, lubricating oil is sometimes injected or dripped
onto the plungers in the spacer block area to improve plunger life. Injection pumps are often
driven  from  the  multiplex  drive  for  these  applications.  A  troubleshooting  guide  for  multiplex
pumps is given in Table 14.8.

14.5.2 Fluid Controls.  Various types of valves are used to regulate and to distribute the power-
fluid supply to one or more wellheads. Common to all free-pump systems is a four-way valve
or wellhead control valve, which is mounted at the wellhead, as shown in Fig. 14.18. Its func-
tion  is  to  provide  for  different  modes  of  operation  by  shifting  it  to  different  positions.  To
circulate  the  pump  into  the  hole,  as  shown  in  Fig.  14.15,  power  fluid  is  directed  down  the
main tubing string. The power fluid begins to operate the pump once it is on bottom and seat-
ed  on  the  standing  valve.  In  the  pump-out  mode,  power  fluid  is  directed  down  the  return
tubing or casing annulus to unseat the pump and to circulate it to the surface. When the pump
is on the surface, putting the valve in the bypass and bleed position permits the well to be bled
down and the pump to be removed and replaced.

Most  systems  include  a  constant-pressure  controller,  as  shown  in  Fig.  14.19,  which  main-
tains  a  discharge-pressure  load  on  the  multiplex  pump  by  continuously  bypassing  the  excess
discharge fluid. It generally operates on the principle of an adjustable spring force on a piston-
and-valve  assembly  that  is  pressure  compensated.  If  the  pressure  rises  on  the  high-pressure
side,  which  is  being  controlled  because  of  changing  system  loads,  the  pressure  forces  on  the
various areas within the valve will cause the valve to open and to bypass more fluid, restoring
the high-pressure side to the preset condition. Jet pumps frequently are operated with a constant-
pressure valve as the only surface control valve. The constant-pressure controller can be used
to regulate the pressure on a manifold assembly serving multiple wells.

Reciprocating  downhole  pumps  are  usually  regulated  with  a  constant-flow  control  valve.
The downhole unit can be maintained at a constant stroking rate if a constant volume of power

fluid is supplied to it, and the constant-flow control valve is designed to provide a preset flow
rate  even  if  the  downhole  operating  pressure  fluctuated  because  of  changing  well  conditions.
Because this valve does not bypass fluid, it must be used with a constant-pressure controller on
the higher-pressure or inlet side.

14.5.3 Control Manifolds.  Where a number of wells are to be pumped from a central battery,
a control manifold is used to direct the flows to and from the individual wells. Control mani-
folds  are  designed  to  be  built  up  in  modular  fashion  to  match  the  number  of  wells  being
pumped  and  are  generally  rated  for  5,000  psi  working  pressure.  A  constant  pressure  control
valve regulates the pressure on the common power fluid side of the manifold. This pressure is
generally a few hundred pounds per square inch greater than the highest pressure demanded by
any  well  to  allow  proper  operation  of  the  individual  well-control  valves.  Individual  constant-
flow  control  valves  regulate  the  amount  of  power  fluid  going  to  each  well.  The  use  of  a
constant  pressure  valve  allows  excess  fluid  to  bypass  at  the  highest  pressure.  Meter  loops  or
individual meters for each station can be integrated into the manifold.

14.5.4 Lubricator.  Some  wells  flow  or  “kick  back”  when  the  operator  is  attempting  to  re-
move or insert a pump into the wellhead. Also, the presence of water may make it inadvisable
to  open  up  the  entire  tubing  string  for  pump  insertion  and  removal.  The  use  of  a  lubricator
allows  the  master  valve  below  the  wellhead  to  be  closed,  and  the  entire  lubricator  with  the
pump in it to be removed from the wellhead. The lubricator is essentially an extended piece of
the tubing with a sideline to allow fluid flow when the pump is circulating in or out of the hole.

14.5.5 Power-Fluid Systems.  The function of the surface treating systems is to provide a con-
stant supply of suitable power fluid to be used to operate the subsurface production units. The

Chapter 14—Hydraulic Pumping in Oil Wells

IV-745

successful and economical operation of any hydraulic pumping system is to a large extent de-
pendent on the effectiveness of the treating system in supplying high-quality power fluid. The
presence of gas, solids, or abrasive materials in the power fluid adversely affects the operation
and  wears  both  the  surface  and  downhole  units.  Therefore,  the  primary  objective  in  treating
crude oil or water for use as power fluid is to make it as free of gas and solids as possible. In
addition, chemical treatment of the power fluid may be beneficial to the life of the downhole
unit. In tests, it has been found that for best operation of the unit, a maximum total solids of
20 ppm, maximum salt content of 12 lbm/1,000 bbl oil, and a maximum particle size of 15 μm
should be maintained. (These norms were established using oil in 30 to 40°API gravity range).
It has been observed, however, that acceptable performance has been achieved in many cases
where these values were exceeded, especially with the use of jet pumps and larger nozzles and
throats. When using piston hydraulic pumps in heavy crude, these limitations have been exceed-
ed  and  satisfactory  results  achieved,  probably  because  the  resulting  wear  does  not  increase
leakage to the same degree. The periodic analysis of power fluid indicates steps to be taken for
improved operation. For example, if the power-fluid analysis shows that iron sulfide or sulfate
compounds make up the bulk of the solids, then a corrosion or scale problem exists that would
require the use of chemical inhibitors to correct the problem. Water is the primary power fluid
being  used  for  jet  pumping  on  offshore  platforms  and  in  applications  where  the  majority  of
produced fluid being made is water. Water requires that a lubricant be added for use with recip-
rocating pumps. Other considerations in the choice of water or oil as a power fluid include:

• Maintenance on surface pumps is usually less with the use of oil. The lower bulk modu-
lus of oil also contributes to reduced pressure pulsations and vibrations that can affect all the
surface equipment.

• Well testing for oil production is simpler with water as the power fluid because all the oil
coming back is produced oil. With oil power fluid, the power rate must be closely metered and
subtracted from the total oil returning to surface. This can be a source of considerable error in
high-water-cut wells where the power oil rate is large compared to the net production.

• In high-friction systems, as sometime occurs with jet pumps in restricted tubulars, the low-
er  viscosity  of  water  can  increase  efficiency.  With  no  moving  parts,  the  jet  pump  is  not
adversely affected by the poor lubrication properties of water.

• In  deep  casing-type  installations,  particularly  with  a  jet  pump,  water  when  used  as  the
power fluid can load up in the casing annulus return, negating any beneficial gas lifting effects
for the produced gas.

It has been found that, in most cases, an upward velocity of 1ft/hr is low enough to pro-
vide  sufficient  gravity  separation  of  entrained  particles  to  clean  power  fluid  to  requirements,
provided that there is no free gas in the fluids or large thermal effects.

14.5.6 Open Power-Fluid System.  A  typical  power-oil  treating  system  that  has  proved  ade-
quate  for  most  OPF  systems,  when  stock-tank-quality  oil  is  supplied,  is  shown  in  Fig. 14.20.
This system has the general characteristic that all return fluids from the well, both production
and power fluid, must pass through the surface treating facility. The power-oil settling tank in
this system is usually a 24-ft-high, three-ring, bolted steel tank. A tank of this height generally
provides adequate head for gravity flow of oil from the tank to the multiplex pump suction. If
more than one multiplex pump is required for the system, individual power-oil tanks can be set
up for each pump, or a single large tank can be used, whichever is more economical and best
meets the operating requirements. If a single large tank supplies the suction for several pumps,
individual suction lines are preferable.

The gas boot is essentially a part of the power-oil tank; its purpose is to provide final gas/
oil separation so that the oil will be stable at near-atmospheric pressure. If the gas is not suffi-
ciently separated from the oil, entrained free gas can enter the power-oil tank and destroy the

IV-746

settling process by causing the fluid in the tank to roll. The following piping specifications for
the gas boot are necessary to ensure undisturbed settling:

• The gas-boot inlet height should be 4 ft above the top of the power-oil tank to allow the

incoming fluid to fall, so that the agitation will encourage gas/oil separation.

• The top section of the gas boot should be at least 3 ft in diameter and 8 ft higher than the
top  of  the  power-oil  tank.  These  two  factors  will  provide  a  reservoir  that  should  absorb  the
volume of the surges.

• The gas line out of the top of the boot should be tied into the power-oil tank and stock-
tank  vent  line  with  a  riser  on  the  top  of  the  power-oil  tank.  In  the  event  the  gas  boot  does
become overloaded and kicks fluid over through the gas line, this arrangement will prevent the
raw or unsettled fluid from being dumped in the top of the power-oil tank, where it may con-
taminate the oil drawn off to the multiplex. A minimum diameter of 3 in. is recommended for
the gas line.

• The line connecting the gas boot to the power-oil tank should be at least 4 in. in diame-

ter. This is necessary to minimize restrictions to low during surge loading of the boot.

Oil entering a large tank (at the bottom and rising to be drawn off the top) tends to channel
from the tank inlet to the outlet; thus, an inlet spreader is used. The purpose of the spreader is
to reduce the velocity of the incoming fluid by distributing the incoming volume over a large
area, thus allowing the fluid to rise upward at a more uniform rate. The recommended spreader
consists of a round, flat plate with a diameter approximately half that of the tank with a 4-in.
skirt that has 60° triangular, saw-tooth slots cut in it. The slots provide automatic opening ad-
justment for varying amounts of flow. It is essential that they be cut to uniform depth to obtain
an  even  distribution  of  flow.  This  type  of  spreader  must  be  installed  with  the  tops  of  all  the
slots in a level plane to prevent fluid from “bumping out” under a high side, and it should be
mounted about 2 ft above the bottom rim of the tank.

The location of the stock-tank take-off and level control is important because it establishes
the effective settling interval of the power-oil tank and controls the fluid level. All fluid com-
ing from the spreader rises to the stock take-off level, where stock-tank oil is drawn off. Fluid

Chapter 14—Hydraulic Pumping in Oil Wells

IV-747

rising above this level is only that amount required to replace the fluid withdrawn by the multi-
plex  pump,  and  it  is  in  this  region  that  the  power-oil  settling  process  takes  place.  The  light
solids settled out are carried with the production through the stock-tank take-off, and the heav-
ier particles settle to the bottom, where they must be removed periodically. The location of the
stock  take-off  point  should  be  within  6  ft  of  the  spreader.  The  height  to  which  the  stock  oil
must rise in the piping, to overflow into the stock tank, determines the fluid level in the power-
oil tank. The diameter of the piping used should be sufficient to provide negligible resistance
to the volume of flow required (4-in. minimum diameter recommended). The extension at the
top of the level control is connected to the gas line to provide a vent that keeps oil in the power-
oil tank from being siphoned down to the level of the top of the stock tank.

The power-oil outlet should be located on the opposite side of the power-oil tank from the
stock take-off outlet to balance the flow distribution within the tank. Because the fluid level in
the tank is maintained approximately 18 in. from the top of the tank, the location of the upper
outlet, for use in starting up or filling tubing strings, depends on estimated emergency require-
ments  and  the  capacity  per  foot  of  the  tank.  A  distance  of  7  ft  from  the  top  of  the  tank  is
usually  sufficient.  This  lower  outlet  line  contains  a  shutoff  valve  that  is  kept  closed  during
normal operations so that the full settling interval is used.

14.5.7 Closed Power-Fluid Systems.  In the closed power-fluid system, the power fluid returns
to  the  surface  in  a  separate  conduit  and  need  not  go  through  the  surface  production  treating
facilities. The consequent reduction in surface treating facilities can tend to offset the addition-
al  downhole  cost  of  the  system.  Virtually  all  closed  power-fluid  systems  are  in  California
because of the large number of townsite leases and offshore platforms, and water is usually the
power  fluid.  Gravity  settling  separation  in  the  power-fluid  tank  ensures  that  the  power  fluid
remains clean despite the addition of solids from power-fluid makeup, corrosion products, and
contamination during pump-in and pump-out operations. The power-fluid makeup is required to
replace the small amount of fluid lost through fits and seals in the downhole pump and well-
head control valve. A certain amount of power fluid is also lost during circulating operations
as well.

14.5.8 Single-Well Systems.  The central battery systems previously discussed have been used
successfully for years and provide a number of benefits. The use of lease fluid treating facili-
ties as part of the of the hydraulic system ensures good, low-pressure separation of the gas, oil,
water, and solids phases present in any system. Good triplex charging of clean, gas-free oil and
consistently  clean  power  fluid  supplied  to  the  downhole  pump  are  desirable  features  of  this
system. The lease treating facilities, however, must have sufficient capacity to process both the
well production and the return power fluid. When the wells are closely spaced, the clustering
of  power  generation,  fluid  treating,  and  control  functions  in  one  location  (but  sufficiently
spread out) is very efficient and allows good use of the installed horsepower. Because the sys-
tem is not limited by production variations on any one well, an adequate supply of the desired
power fluid is ensured by the size of the system. A further benefit associated with the use of
the lease separation facilities is the option of a closed power-fluid system. When well spacing
is large, however, long, high-pressure power-fluid lines must be run. Also, individual well test-
ing  is  complicated  by  the  need  to  meter  the  power-fluid  rate  for  each  well,  which  can
introduce measurement errors. As a final consideration, only a few wells in a field may be best
suited to artificial lift by hydraulic pumping, so the installation of a central system is difficult
to justify.

To address the limitations of the central battery system, single-well systems have been de-
signed,23,24  many  of  the  requirements  of  which  are  the  same  as  for  a  central  battery.  The  oil,
water, gas, and solids phases must be separated to provide a consistent source of power fluid
to run the system. A choice of water or oil power fluid should be possible, and the fluid used

IV-748

as power fluid must be sufficiently clean to ensure reliable operation and that it is gas-free at
the multiplex suction to prevent cavitation and partial fluid end loading. An adequate reservoir
of  fluid  must  be  present  to  allow  continuous  operation  and  the  various  circulating  functions
associated with the free-pump procedures. Finally, a means of disposing of and measuring the
well production to the lease treating and storage facilities must be provided.

To achieve these objectives, several of the manufacturers of hydraulic pumping units offer
packaged  single-well  systems  that  include  all  the  control,  metering,  and  pumping  equipment
necessary. All components are skid mounted on one or two skids to facilitate installation at the
well  and  to  make  the  systems  easily  portable  if  the  unit  is  to  be  moved  to  a  different  well.
Usually, the only plumbing required at the wellsite is the power fluid and return-line hookup at
the wellhead and the connection of the vessel outlet to the flowline.

An example of a typical single-well power unit is illustrated in Fig. 14.1. All units of this
type share certain design concepts, with small variations depending on the manufacturer. Either
one  or  two  pressure  vessels  are  located  at  the  wellsite.  The  size  of  the  main  reservoir  vessel
depends on the nature of the well and the tubular completion. The reservoir vessel should en-
sure that, if the wellhead partially empties the return conduit to the flowline, adequate capacity
remains  to  operate  the  downhole  unit  until  production  returns  re-enter  the  vessel.  Even  if  the
well does not head, extra capacity is needed. When the unit is shut down for maintenance or
pump changes, that portion of the return conduit occupied by gas needs to be filled from the
vessel  to  unseat  the  pump  and  to  circulate  it  to  the  surface.  The  vessel  sizes  normally  used
range  from  42  ×  120  in.  to  60  ×  240  in.  In  some  wells,  even  the  largest  vessel  may  not  be
able to compensate fully for heading, in which case it is common to use backpressure to stabi-
lize the heading. The vessels themselves are normally in the 175- to 240-psi working pressure
range,  with  higher  ratings  available  for  special  applications.  Coal-tar-epoxy  internal  coatings
are common, with special coatings for extreme cases.

The  return  power  fluid  and  production  for  the  well  enter  the  vessel  system  where  basic
separation  of  water,  oil,  and  gas  phases  takes  place.  Free  gas  at  the  vessel  pressure  is  dis-
charged  to  the  flowline  with  a  vent  system  that  ensures  a  gas  cap  in  the  vessel  at  all  times,
while  the  oil  and  water  separate  in  the  vessel,  and  the  desired  fluid  is  withdrawn  for  use  as
power fluid. The power fluid passes through one or more cyclone desanders to remove solids
before  entering  the  multiplex  suction,  where  it  is  pressurized  for  reinjection  down  the  power-
fluid  tubing.  Any  excess  multiplex  output  that  is  bypassed  for  downhole  pump  control  is
returned to the vessel. The underflow from the bottom of the cyclone desanders contains a high-
solids concentration and is discharged either into the flowline or back into the vessel system.
Once  the  system  is  stabilized  on  the  selected  power  fluid,  the  well  production  of  oil,  water,
and  gas  is  discharged  into  the  flowline  from  the  vessel,  which  is  maintained  at  a  pressure
above the flowline. Because the flowline is carrying only what the well makes, additional treat-
ing  and  separating  facilities  are  not  needed,  as  they  are  in  the  central  battery  system  that
handles  mixed  well  production  and  power  fluid.  This  feature  also  facilitates  individual  well
testing.

Overall, simple gravity dump piping, which consists of a riser on the outside of the vessel,
controls the fluid level in the vessel system. To prevent siphoning of the vessel, the gas-vent
line is tied in the top of the riser as a siphon breaker. The choice of oil or water power fluid is
made by selection of the appropriate take-off points on the vessel so that the production goes
to the flowline and the power fluid goes to the multiplex pump. If the multiplex suction is low
in the vessel and the flowline is high in the vessel, water will tend to accumulate in the vessel
and will be the power fluid. If the multiplex suction is high in the vessel and the flowline is
low, oil will tend to accumulate in the vessel and will be the power fluid. Opening and closing
appropriate valves sets the system up for the chosen power fluid. The multiplex suction outlets
are positioned with respect to the overall fluid level in the vessel to avoid drawing power fluid

from the emulsion layer between the oil and water because this layer generally contains a sig-
nificantly higher concentration of solids and is not easily cleaned in the cyclones.

The  power-fluid  cleaning  is  accomplished  with  cyclone  desanders  that  require  a  pressure
differential across them. In the two-vessel system, a differential pressure valve between the two
vessels that stages the pressure drop from the wellhead accomplishes this. The energy to main-
tain this staged pressure is supplied by the multiplex pump through the downhole pump.

The flow path through a cyclone cleaner is shown in Fig. 14.21. Fluid enters the top of the
cone tangentially through the feed nozzle and spirals downward toward the apex of the cone.
Conservation of angular momentum dictates that the rotational speed of the fluid increases as
the  radius  of  curvature  decreases,  and  it  is  the  high  rotational  speed  that  cleans  the  fluid  by
centrifugal force. The clean fluid, called the overflow, spirals back upward through the vortex
core to the vortex finder, while the dirty fluid exits downward at the apex through the under-
flow nozzle. The cones are usually constructed of cast iron with an elastomer interior. Differ-
ent  feed-nozzle  and  vortex-finder  sizes  and  shapes  are  available  to  alter  the  performance
characteristics of the cyclone. Different sizes of cyclones are available, with the smaller sizes
having lower flow-rate capacities but somewhat higher cleaning efficiencies.

Maintaining the proper flow through the cyclone to ensure good cleaning depends on cor-
rectly adjusting the pressures at the feed nozzle, overflow, and underflow. At the design flow
rates, a 30- to 50-psi drop normally occurs from the feed nozzle to the overflow. In the single-
vessel  system,  a  charged  pump  supplies  the  pressure,  while  in  a  dual-vessel  system,  the

IV-750

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

pressure  is  supplied  by  a  higher  backpressure  on  the  returns  from  the  well.  Because  of  the
centrifugal head, the cyclone overflow pressure is generally 5 to 15 psi higher than the under-
flow pressure. An underflow restrictor is commonly used to adjust the amount of underflow to
between 5 and 10% of the overflow. This ensures good cleaning without circulation of exces-
sive  fluid  volumes.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  volume  flow  rates  through  a  cyclone  vary
inversely with the specific gravity of the fluid, and that within the range of normal power flu-
ids, increased viscosity leads to increased flow rates. The viscosity that suppresses the internal
vortex action causes this latter effect. Therefore, proper cyclone sizing to match the charge and
multiplex pump characteristics must be done carefully and with detailed knowledge of the fluid
to  be  processed.  The  manufacturers  of  the  packaged  systems  supply  appropriate  cyclones  for
the  installation,  but  it  should  be  noted  that  moving  the  portable  unit  to  another  well  might
require resizing of the cyclone system.

The routing of the dirty underflow varies with different systems, and may be an adjustable
option in some systems. Two basic choices are available: return of underflow to the vessel or
routing  of  the  underflow  to  the  flowline.  In  a  dual-vessel  system,  the  underflow  must  be  re-
turned  to  the  flowline  downstream  of  the  backpressure  valve  to  provide  sufficient  pressure
differential  to  ensure  underflow.  Discharging  the  solids  to  the  flowline  is  attractive  because
they  are  disposed  of  immediately  and  are  excluded  from  possible  entry  into  the  power  fluid.
Under  some  conditions,  however,  continuous  operation  may  not  be  possible.  If  the  net  well
production  is  less  than  the  underflow  from  the  cyclone  for  any  length  of  time,  the  level  of
fluid  in  the  vessel  will  drop,  and  over  an  extended  period  of  time,  this  can  result  in  a  shut-
down of the system. Shutting off the cyclone underflow during these periods stops the loss of
fluid, but apex plugging occurs during the shutoff period. Returning the underflow to the ves-
sel eliminates the problem of running the vessel dry but does potentially reintroduce solids into
the power fluid. In single-vessel units, the underflow is generally plumbed back to the vessel
in a baffled section adjacent to the flowline outlet. This provides for the maximum conserva-
tion  but  requires  a  differential  pressure  valve,  between  the  cyclone  underflow  and  the  vessel,
which is normally set at about 20 psi to ensure a positive pressure to the underflow fluid.

As mentioned previously, the vessel pressure is held above the flowline pressure to ensure
flow  into  the  flowline  and  a  backpressure  control  valve  is  sometimes  used  for  this  purpose.
This keeps the vessel pressure, which is backpressure on the well, at a minimum for any flow-
line  pressure  that  may  occur  during  normal  field  operation.  When  water  is  the  power  fluid,
“riding” the flowline in this manner is acceptable. However, when oil is the power fluid, chang-
ing vessel pressure causes flashing of gas in the power oil and adversely affects the multiplex
suction.  When  oil  is  used  as  power  fluid,  it  is  recommended  that  a  pressure  control  valve  be
used  to  keep  the  vessel  at  a  steady  pressure  some  10  to  15  psi  above  the  highest  expected
flowline pressure.

Although, the single-vessel system was developed for applications involving widely spaced
wells,  two  or  three  well  installations  have  been  successfully  operated  from  a  single-well  sys-
tem.  This  installation  is  very  attractive  on  offshore  platforms.  With  a  large  number  of  highly
deviated  wells,  offshore  production  is  well  suited  to  hydraulic  pumping  with  free  pumps,  but
the  extra  fluid  treating  facilities  with  an  open  power-fluid  system  is  a  drawback  when  severe
weight  and  space  limitations  exist.  The  closed  power-fluid  system  answers  this  problem,  but
the extra tubulars in deviated holes create their own set of problems and expense. Furthermore,
the use of jet pumps, which is quite attractive offshore, is not possible with the closed power-
fluid system. For safety and environmental reasons, water is almost always the power fluid of
choice offshore. A large single-well system can receive the returns from all the wells and sepa-
rate the power water necessary for reinjection to power downhole units. Full 100% separation

only the actual production from the wells. A compact bank of cyclone cleaners completes the
power-fluid separation and cleaning unit.

In summary, the hydraulic system normally is used in areas where other types of artificial
lift have failed or, because of well conditions, have been eliminated because of their shortcom-
ings. Hydraulic pumping systems have been labeled expensive, where, in truth, the use of other
artificial lift methods may not be feasible. These include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Using hydraulic free pumps in remote areas where the rig costs are unusually high or the

availability of workover rigs is limited.

• Crooked or deviated wells
• Use  of  hydraulic  systems  in  relatively  deep,  hot,  high-volume  wells.  (Note:  Hydraulic

pumps can go through tubing with as much as a 24° buildup per 100 ft.)

• The use of jet pumps in sandy corrosive wells.
• The use of reciprocating pumps in deep wells with low bottomhole producing pressure.
• Wells with rapidly changing producing volumes.

• The use of jet pumping systems in wells producing with gas/liquid ratios less than 750:1

but producing under a packer where free gas must be pumped.

• Using hydraulic free pumps in wells with high-paraffin contents.
• Using hydraulic OPF systems in low-API-gravity wells.

14.5.9 Jet Pumping System Design Example.  The following is an example of a design for a
well using a jet pumping system. The design data must be carefully collected and is shown in
Table 14.9. Because there are numerous possible combinations, and a design typically requires
many iterations, current design methods utilize computer software programs.

A jet pumping system was chosen because of the remote location, the advantage of the free-
pump  system  to  reduce  pump  pulling  costs,  and  the  advantages  and  flexibility  of  a  central
system to produce several wells drilled in the same field. There are no gas-sales lines, and the
produced gas is used to provide the necessary energy to drive the prime movers. The wells are
5,400 ft in depth and have a static reservoir pressure of 2,050 psia. The jet hydraulic pumping
system has been operating successfully for 5 years with low operating expenses.

One well was producing only 150 B/D, and a pressure buildup survey and production test
indicated a skin of 50. Following a successful reperforating and stimulation treatment, the well
is capable of producing significantly higher rates. By running the original jet combination and
matching the power fluid, injection pressure, and total production, a new pump intake was cal-
culated, and a new IPR curve was determined.

A design was made to find what could be produced with the existing horsepower and also
what might be achieved if excess horsepower from a second well was used. A throat and noz-
zle (10B) with an annulus of 0.0503 was determined to be a good fit for both cases. See Table
14.6. The selected jet has an ability to produce 1,063 B/D using 1,720 B/D of power fluid at

Chapter 14—Hydraulic Pumping in Oil Wells

2,500 psi injection or 81 hp. See Table 14.9. If the power-fluid injection pressure is increased
to 3,000 psi, the power-fluid volume is increased to 1,896 B/D, and the pump intake pressure
is reduced to 850 psig, then 1,200 B/D of production is feasible, which will take 108 hp.

The  predicted  performance  of  the  jet  pump  system  for  this  well  is  shown  in  Fig.  14.22.
Line 1 on the graph represents 2,500 psi injection and 81 hp. Line 2 represents 3,000 psi and
108  hp.  If  pressure  is  increased  to  3,500  psi,  the  pump  will  go  into  cavitation,  and  damage
might occur to the jet nozzle throat.

14.5.10 Design Example for a Reciprocating Hydraulic Pump System.  Currently a 12,000-ft
well is equipped with a sucker rod beam pumping system with the pump set at only 9,000 ft.
The  design  data,  plus  the  well  completion  and  pump  installation  data  summary  and  a  pump
performance summary, are shown in Table 14.10. The well is deviated with a severe dogleg at
9,100  ft  and  produces  only  100  B/D  with  a  pump  intake  pressure  (PIP)  of  about  1,000  psi.
Workover  rig  cost  is  high,  and  a  free-pump  installation  is  desirable  to  reduce  maintenance
costs. Furthermore, a production increase is essential for this remotely located well. A review
of the IPR data shown in Fig. 14.23 indicates that production can easily be increased from 100
B/D to 350 B/D, if the well can be pumped with a Pwf of 500 psi without significant gas inter-
ference.  Pressure  maintenance  operations  have  begun  in  the  field,  and  further  decrease  in  the
reservoir pressure is not expected. An economic analysis indicates a payout from changing to
the hydraulic system in less than 3 years.

The  5½-in.  casing  has  a  significant  effect  on  the  proposed  design.  Considering  the  casing
size, depth, production requirements, and reservoir conditions, a casing free-pump system was
selected. Power oil is pumped down the tubing and returned up the casing-tubing annulus with
the  oil,  water,  and  gas  production.  The  2⅞-in.  [2.441-in.  inside  diameter  (ID)]  N-80  tubing
now in the well has ample tension, burst, and collapse strengths and will be used. The pump is
set at the lowest possible depth (12,000 ft) in order to achieve an operating pressure of 500 psi
at the perforations. At design conditions, a pump displacement of about 580 B/D is required to
produce the oil and water liquids, plus the free gas. In order to decrease the number of pump
failures,  the  strokes  per  minute  are  limited  to  33.4.  Pump  model  252017  was  chosen  to  stay
within this range. See Table 14.1.

The selected pump is designed to run at 46.3% of rated speed, requiring a power-fluid vol-
ume of 741 B/D and an injection pressure of 3,211.8 psi. Horsepower required for this well is
44.9  hp,  and  a  60-hp  system  is  selected  to  provide  more  flexibility  and  compensate  for  wear
and possible higher gas volumes.

Introduction
Progressing cavity pumping (PCP) systems derive their name from the unique, positive displace-
ment pump that evolved from the helical gear pump concept first developed by Rene Moineau
in the late 1920s.1–3 Although these pumps are now most commonly referred to as progressing
cavity  (PC)  pumps,  they  also  are  called  screw  pumps  or  Moineau  pumps.  PC  pumps  initially
were used extensively as fluid transfer pumps in a wide range of industrial and manufacturing
applications,  with  some  attempts  made  to  use  them  for  the  surface  transfer  of  oilfield  fluids.
However,  it  was  not  until  after  the  development  of  synthetic  elastomers  and  adhesives  in  the
late  1940s  that  PC  pumps  could  be  applied  effectively  in  applications  involving  petroleum-
based  fluids.  Except  for  several  limited  field  trials,  it  was  not  until  the  late  1970s  that  a
concerted  effort  was  made  to  use  PC  pumps  as  a  method  of  artificial  lift  for  the  petroleum
industry. Over the past two decades, with the technical contributions and persistence of many
individuals and companies, PCP systems have experienced a gradual emergence as a common
form  of  artificial  lift.4–7  Although  precise  numbers  are  difficult  to  obtain,  it  is  estimated  that
more than 50,000 wells worldwide currently are being produced with these systems.

This chapter serves as a guideline for the design and operation of the various PCP systems
currently  being  used  in  various  downhole  applications  worldwide.  The  chapter  is  broken  into
five major parts as follows: Part 1—PCP Lift System Equipment, Part 2—PCP System Design,
Part  3—Specific  Application  Considerations,  Part  4—PCP  System  Installation,  Automation,
Troubleshooting and Failure, and Part 5—Design Example.

Readers  are  encouraged  to  refer  to  the  numerous  references  at  the  end  of  this  chapter  for

additional details on PC pumps and PCP systems.

The  two  key  features  that  differentiate  PCP  systems  from  other  forms  of  artificial  lift  are
the downhole PC pump and the associated surface drive systems. Although other major compo-
nents,  such  as  the  production  tubing  and  sucker  rod  strings,  are  found  in  other  downhole  lift
systems,  the  design  and  operational  requirements  typically  differ  for  PCP  applications.  Also,
many additional equipment components may be used in conjunction with PCP systems to con-
tend with specific application conditions.

Fig. 15.1—Configuration of a typical progressing cavity pumping (PCP) system.

The basic surface-driven PCP system configuration illustrated in Fig 15.1 is the most com-
mon,  although  electric  and  hydraulic  downhole  drive  systems  and  various  other  hybrid  PCP
systems  are  also  available  (see  Alternative  PCP  System  Configurations).  The  downhole  PC
pump is a positive displacement pump that consists of two parts: a helical steel “rotor” and a
“stator” comprised of a steel tubular housing with a bonded elastomeric sleeve formed with a
multiple  internal  helix  matched  suitably  to  the  rotor  configuration.  The  stator  is  typically  run
into the well on the bottom of the production tubing, while the rotor is connected to the bot-
tom  of  the  sucker  rod  string.  Rotation  of  the  rod  string  by  means  of  a  surface  drive  system
causes the rotor to spin within the fixed stator, creating the pumping action necessary to pro-
duce fluids to surface.

PCP  systems  have  several  unique  design  features  and  operating  characteristics  that  favor

their selection for many applications8–10:

• High overall system energy efficiency, typically in the 55 to 75% range.
• Ability to produce high concentrations of sand or other produced solids.
• Ability to tolerate high percentages of free gas.
• No valves or reciprocating parts to clog, gas lock, or wear.
• Good resistance to abrasion.
• Low internal shear rates (limits fluid emulsification through agitation).
• Relatively  low  power  costs  and  continuous  power  demand  (prime  mover  capacity  fully

utilized).

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-759

• Relatively simple installation and operation.
• Generally low maintenance.
• Low profile surface equipment.
• Low surface noise levels.
PCP systems, however, also have some limitations and special considerations:
• Limited  production  rates  (maximum  of  800  m3/d  [5,040  B/D]  in  large-diameter  pumps,

much lower in small-diameter pumps).

• Limited lift capacity (maximum of 3000 m [9,840 ft]). Note that the lift capacity of larger

displacement PC pumps is typically much lower.

• Limited  temperature  capability  (routine  use  to  100°C  [212°F],  potential  use  to  180°C

[350°F] with special elastomers).

• Sensitivity to fluid environment (stator elastomer may swell or deteriorate on exposure to

certain fluids, including well treatment fluids).

• Subject to low volumetric efficiency in wells producing substantial quantities of gas.
• Sucker rod strings may be susceptible to fatigue failures.
• Pump stator may sustain permanent damage if pumped dry for even short periods.
• Rod-string and tubing wear can be problematic in directional and horizontal wells.
• Most systems require the tubing to be pulled to replace the pump.
• Vibration problems may occur in high-speed applications (mitigation may require the use

of tubing anchors and stabilization of the rod string).

• Paraffin control can be an issue in waxy crude applications (rotation as opposed to recip-

rocation of the rod string precludes use of scrapers for effective wax removal).

• Lack of experience with system design, installation, and operation, especially in some areas.
Many of these limitations continue to change or be alleviated over time with the develop-
ment of new products and improvements in materials and equipment design. If configured and
operated properly in appropriate applications, PCP systems currently provide a highly efficient
and economical means of artificial lift.

15.1 PCP Lift System Equipment
The  basic  system  components  include  the  downhole  pump,  sucker  rod  and  production  tubing
strings, and surface drive equipment, which must include a stuffing box. However, a PCP instal-
lation may also include different accessory equipment, such as gas separators, rod centralizers,
tubing-string  rotator  systems,  and  surface  equipment  control  devices.  The  following  sections
describe the various components of a PCP installation in further detail.

15.1.1 Downhole  PC  Pump.    PC  pumps  are  classified  as  single-rotor,  internal-helical-gear
pumps within the overall category of positive displacement pumps.11,12 The rotor comprises the
“internal gear” and the stator forms the “external gear” of the pump. The stator always has one
more “tooth” or “lobe” than the rotor. The PC pump products currently on the market fall into
two  different  categories  based  on  their  geometric  design:  single  lobe  or  multilobe.  Currently,
the  vast  majority  (i.e.,  estimated  at  >  97%)  of  PC  pumps  in  use  downhole  are  of  the  single-
lobe  design  and  thus  are  the  primary  focus  of  this  chapter.  Other  variations  of  these  basic
configurations  include  semi-elliptical  rotor/stator  geometries  and  uniform-thickness  elastomer
pumps.

The geometric design of a single-lobe PC pump is illustrated in Fig. 15.2. The longitudinal
cross-section  in  Fig.  15.2  shows  the  single  external  helical  shape  of  the  rotor  and  the  corre-
sponding double internal helical geometry of the stator. Note that the stator pitch length (Ls) is
exactly  double  the  rotor  pitch  length  in  single-lobe  pumps.  With  the  mating  of  the  rotor  and
stator in a single-lobe PC pump, two parallel, helical cavities are formed (180° apart and one
rotor pitch out of phase) that spiral around the outside of the rotor along the pump length, with
each cavity having a length equal to the stator pitch length. Note that the parallel cavities are

offset lengthwise, with the end of a cavity on one side of the rotor corresponding to the maxi-
mum  cavity  cross-section  on  the  opposite  side.  In  a  single-lobe  pump,  the  rotor  is  circular  in
cross section (with a minor diameter, d), whereas the cavity within the stator has a semi-ellipti-
cal  geometry.  Another  important  geometric  parameter  is  the  pump  eccentricity  (e),  which  is
equal  to  the  distance  between  the  centerlines  of  the  major  and  minor  diameters  of  the  rotor.
The distance between the stator axis and rotor major diameter axis is also equal to the eccen-
tricity value. The rotor creates an interference fit seal with the stator elastomer on both sides of
the  semi-elliptical  opening  and  a  seal  over  the  semicircular  end  of  the  stator  opening  at  the
positions  corresponding  to  the  ends  of  the  longitudinal  fluid  cavities.  The  fluid-filled  cavities
are formed by the open areas left between the rotor and stator at each cross section. Fig. 15.3
shows a section view of a single-lobe PC pump and the different rotor and stator geometries of
several different pump models.

During production operations, the rotor translates back and forth across the stator opening
as it is rotated within the fixed stator. This occurs because of a combination of two motions:
rotation  of  the  rotor  around  its  own  centroidal  axis  in  the  clockwise  direction  and  eccentric
reverse  rotation  (i.e.,  nutation)  of  the  rotor  about  the  centroidal  axis  of  the  stator.  Fig.  15.4
illustrates the rotor movement within the stator opening at a given longitudinal position through
one full revolution. The rotor movement causes the series of parallel fluid cavities formed by
the rotor and stator to move axially from the pump suction to discharge on a continuous basis.
The nutation of the rotor about the stator centerline is also shown in Fig. 15.4.

Typically, rotors are precision machined from high-strength carbon steel (e.g., ASTM 1045
or  4140)  into  an  external  helix,  although  some  manufacturers  have  recently  developed  tech-
niques  that  allow  rotors  to  be  fabricated  through  a  metal  forming  process.  In  most  cases,  the
rotors are coated with a thin layer of wear-resistant material, usually chrome, to resist abrasion
and then are polished to a smooth finish to reduce rotor/stator friction. Rotors are also fabricat-
ed  from  various  stainless  steels  for  service  in  corrosive  or  acidic  environments  because  these
materials  are  less  susceptible  to  corrosive  fluid  attack.  These  rotors,  however,  tend  to  be  far
more  susceptible  to  abrasion  wear  than  chrome-coated  rotors.  For  most  applications,  the
chrome plating thickness is typically 0.254 mm (0.01 in.) on the rotor major diameter. Howev-

er,  for  severe  wear  applications,  vendors  typically  offer  rotors  with  a  “double”  chrome  thick-
ness  to  prolong  service  life.  Other  processes  used  by  vendors  to  fabricate  rotors  with  more
abrasion-resistant coatings include boronizing, nitriding, and also thermal spray methods which
are used to apply carbide-based coatings materials.

Stators typically are fabricated by placing a machined core (i.e., with the shape of the heli-
cal  stator  opening)  inside  a  steel  tubular  and  then  injecting  and  subsequently  curing  an
elastomer  material  within  the  annular  space.  Achieving  a  good  bond  between  the  elastomer
sleeve and the steel tubular is essential. Depending on the chemical composition and the curing

process of the elastomer, the chemical and mechanical properties of the material can vary con-
siderably, as discussed in detail later.

Multilobe PC Pumps.  In response to increasing demand for higher displacement PC pumps,
several  manufacturers  have  developed  various  models  of  multilobe  PC  pumps.  Although  the
basic  operating  principles  are  the  same,  multilobe  designs  can  be  differentiated  from  single-
lobe  pumps  by  the  presence  of  three  or  more  parallel  cavities  within  the  stator  and  by  rotor
geometries with two or more lobes. The stator must always have one more lobe than the match-
ing  rotor;  thus,  the  multilobe  pump  geometries  are  often  referenced  according  to  their  rotor/
stator lobe ratio (e.g., 2:3 and 3:4 pumps). Although it is possible to manufacture pumps with
higher  ratios,  the  multilobe  pump  models  currently  available  have  a  2:3  lobe  ratio  configura-
tion. The cross-sectional shapes of the rotors and stators can also be varied somewhat from the
original Moineau geometry, which has round (i.e., circular) lobes. All the major pump manufac-
turers  have  adopted  semi-elliptical  rotor  and  matching  stator  geometries  for  their  multilobe
pump  products.  This  decision  was  based  primarily  on  fabrication  considerations,  because  it  is
possible to machine the rotors in the same manner as single-lobe rotors, which is substantially
less  costly  than  cutting  rotors  with  a  milling  machine.  Fig.  15.5  presents  cross-sectional  dia-
grams of the two pump designs to illustrate the differences in the rotor and stator shapes. Note
that the interference fit that develops between the rotor and stator is also affected by the differ-
ent  component  geometries,  and  this  can  affect  the  pressure  integrity  of  the  seals  between  the
pump cavities, which in turn can influence pump performance and life.

The primary advantage that multilobe pumps have over single-lobe designs is their ability
to  achieve  higher  volumetric  and  lift  capacity  with  shorter  pumps  of  the  same  diameter.  The
increased  displacement  can  be  attributed  to  a  larger  stator  cavity  area  and  the  fact  that  each
stator cavity is swept multiple times during a single revolution of the rotor (i.e., twice in a 2:3
lobe geometry), as opposed to only once for a single-lobe pump. As a result, the fluid is ad-
vanced  multiple  stator  pitch  lengths  per  revolution.  Because  the  cavities  also  tend  to  overlap
more along the pump length than in single-lobe designs, a shorter pump is typically required to
achieve the same pressure capacity. The shorter lengths also help to reduce product costs.

Multilobe  pumps  also  have  some  disadvantages:  (1)  higher  flow  velocities  through  the
pump,  which  can  lead  to  increased  fluid  shear  rates  and  flow  losses  and  greater  potential  for
erosion of the elastomer; (2) higher frequency of stator flexing, which increases hysteretic heat

generation  and  may  impact  pump  life;  (3)  greater  potential  for  inflow  problems  to  develop
when high-viscosity fluids are pumped; (4) more prone to cause vibration problems because of
the larger rotor mass and increased nutation speeds; and (5) increased torque requirements cor-
responding  to  the  typically  larger  pump  displacements.  In  general,  the  potential  problems
associated with these various disadvantages can be avoided through proper system design and
operation.

Uniform-Thickness PC Pumps.  An  example  of  another  type  of  hybrid  PC  pump  product,
the “uniform-thickness” pump, is illustrated in Fig. 15.6. These products were first introduced
in  the  mid-1990s  as  one  approach  to  overcome  non-uniform  distortion  of  the  stator  cavity
caused  by  swelling  or  thermal  expansion  of  the  elastomer.  A  variety  of  manufacturing  tech-
niques  have  since  been  developed  to  fabricate  stators  with  an  elastomer  sleeve  of  uniform
thickness around the entire stator opening. Note that only the stator component differs and that
conventional rotors are typically used with these pump models. Because the potential for stator
distortion is minimized, these pumps should perform better in light-oil or high-temperature ap-
plications.  Note,  however,  that  because  of  the  relatively  thin  elastomer  sleeve,  proper  pump
sizing is critical for these pump models if reasonable run lives are to be achieved.

15.1.2 Pump Models and Specifications.  A  wide  variety  of  PC  pump  models  are  available
from many different manufacturers. It is important to note that currently no industry standards
(e.g., API) govern PC pump designs and that pump geometries and materials vary considerably
between  vendors.  In  addition,  although  it  is  typical  among  vendors  to  specify  pump  models
according to their volumetric displacement and pressure differential capabilities, the rating crite-
ria  may  vary  (i.e.,  particularly  with  respect  to  pressure  ratings)  and  should  be  understood  for
proper pump selection. Fig. 15.7 shows the wide range of displacement and pressure capabili-
ties associated with currently available PC pumps categorized according to the minimum casing
size in which they can be installed with reasonable clearances.

Pump Displacement.  The  displacement  of  a  PC  pump  is  defined  as  the  volume  of  fluid
produced for each turn of the rotor. When the rotor completes a full revolution, the series of
cavities within the pump have advanced one full stator pitch length, thus discharging a corre-
sponding fluid volume to the production tubing. Because the cavity area between the rotor and
stator remains constant at all cross sections along the pump length, a PC pump delivers a uni-
form nonpulsating flow at a rate directly proportional to pump speed.

IV-764

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 15.7—Current PC pump displacement and pressure capabilities.

The volumetric displacement of a single-lobe PC pump (s) is a function of the pump eccen-
tricity (e), rotor minor diameter (d), and stator pitch length (Ls) and can be calculated as follows:

s = 4 e d Ls . ............................................................ (15.1)

For convenience, most pump manufacturers specify pump displacement in terms of volume
per  day  at  a  certain  pump  speed,  typically  1,  100,  or  500  rpm.  Although  product  selection
varies among manufacturers, PC pump displacements generally range from 0.02 m3/d/rpm [0.13
B/D/rpm]  to  >  2.0  m3/d/rpm  [12.6  B/D/rpm].  This  requires  using  an  appropriate  conversion
factor with Eq. 15.1.

It is apparent from Eq. 15.1 that different combinations of the parameters e, d, and Ls can
be used to obtain equivalent pump displacements. The performance and serviceability of a PCP
system can be influenced strongly by these geometrical variations under certain completion and
production  conditions.  Unfortunately,  the  potential  impacts  associated  with  using  different
pump geometries are usually difficult to assess because these geometric specifications are typi-
cally considered proprietary and thus are not published by pump manufacturers.

The  theoretical  flow  rate  of  a  PC  pump  is  directly  proportional  to  its  displacement  and

rotational speed and can be determined by

qth = s ω, ................................................................ (15.2)

where qth = theoretical flow rate (m3/d [B/D]), s = pump displacement (m3/d/rpm [B/D/rpm]),
and ω = rotational speed (rpm).

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-765

However, as the differential pressure across the pump increases, some fluid slips backward
through  the  seal  lines  between  the  rotor  and  the  stator,  reducing  the  discharge  flow  rate  and
volumetric efficiency of the pump. As a result, the actual flow rate of a PC pump is the differ-
ence between its theoretical flow rate and the slippage rate:

qa = qth – qs, .............................................................. (15.3)

where  qa  =  actual  flow  rate  (m3/d  [B/D]),  qth  =  theoretical  flow  rate  (m3/d  [B/D]),  and  qs  =
slippage rate (m3/d [B/D]).

The slippage rate is dependent on rotor/stator fit, elastomer properties, fluid viscosity, and
pump differential pressure capacity. Note that the actual displacement of a PC pump may vary
from  the  manufacturer’s  published  values  even  without  consideration  for  slippage  in  cases
when  the  stator  cavity  volume  is  reduced  because  of  expansion  or  swelling  of  the  elastomer
under downhole conditions. In some cases, the displacement reduction can exceed 10% of the
published value.

Pressure Ratings.  The overall pressure capacity of a PC pump is controlled by the maxi-
mum pressure that can be developed within individual cavities and the number of cavities (i.e.,
full stator pitches) along the pump. The maximum pressure capacity of each cavity is a func-
tion of the seal integrity between the rotor and stator and the properties of the produced fluid.
In general, the differential pressure capacity of the seal lines increases with tighter rotor/stator
interference fits and higher-viscosity fluids. However, the pump geometric parameters and the
properties  of  the  stator  elastomer  can  significantly  influence  seal  capacity.  For  example,  long
pitch pumps tend to have more effective seals (i.e., all other variables being equal) as a result
of minimal cavity distortion or elastomer deformation in the axial direction of the pump during
operation. The rotor diameter and eccentricity also affect the nature of the rotor/stator interac-
tion,  which  can  affect  sealability  during  pump  operation.  The  elasticity  and  stiffness  of  the
elastomer also govern sealability. For metal-elastomer interference fits, the pressure differential
per  cavity  typically  ranges  from  410  to  620  kPa  [60  to  90  psi].  Determination  of  appropriate
pressure ratings for multilobe and uniform-thickness PC pumps must also consider the different
leak paths and/or seal behavior compared with single-lobe pumps. Pressure ratings for both single-
lobe and multilobe PC pumps are generally considered to be insensitive to pump speed.

Historically,  PC  pump  pressure  ratings  were  often  referenced  to  the  number  of  pump
“stages” or cavities, which led to substantial confusion given that different vendors used differ-
ent stage definitions. As a result, most manufacturers now specify pump pressure capabilities in
terms  of  maximum  differential  pressure  (or  equivalent  head  of  water).  Fig.  15.7  shows  the
range of pressure ratings for most of the currently available PC pumps. Currently, no industry
standards govern the setting of pressure ratings by individual PC pump manufacturers.

Operating  a  PC  pump  at  excessive  differential  pressures  leads  to  high  fluid  slippage  rates
across  the  rotor/stator  seal  lines,  which  causes  excessive  stator  deformation.  Sustained  opera-
tion  under  such  conditions  will  lead  to  accelerated  deterioration  of  the  elastomer  material
properties and will likely result in the premature failure of the stator.

15.1.3 Elastomer Types, Properties, and Selection Methods.  In downhole applications, most
PC pump failures involve the stator elastomer and often result from chemical or physical elas-
tomer  breakdown  induced  by  the  wellbore  environment.  The  environment  can  vary  consider-
ably  between  different  reservoirs  and  individual  operations.  The  bottomhole  temperature  may
range from 15 to 200°C [60 to 360°F]; the well may be pumped off or have a high bottomhole
pressure; and the produced fluids may contain solids (e.g., sand, coal fines), gases (e.g., CH4,
CO2, H2S), and a wide range of other constituents, including water, paraffins, naphthenes, as-
phaltenes, and aromatics. Additionally, the methods and fluids used to drill, treat, and stimulate

IV-766

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

wells introduce a variety of other chemicals into the wellbore, such as drilling muds, comple-
tion  fluids  (heavy  salt  solutions),  treatment  fluids  (e.g.,  diluents,  hot  oil,  strong  acids),  corro-
sion inhibitors (e.g., amines), and flooding materials (e.g., CO2).

Successful  use  of  PC  pumps,  particularly  in  the  more  severe  downhole  environments,  re-
quires proper elastomer selection and appropriate pump sizing and operation. PC pump manu-
facturers continue to develop and test new elastomers; over time, these efforts have resulted in
performance  improvements  and  an  expanded  range  of  practical  applications.  Despite  this  suc-
cess,  the  elastomer  component  still  continues  to  impose  severe  restrictions  on  PC  pump  use,
especially in applications with lighter oils or higher temperatures.

Mechanical and Chemical Properties.  The performance of an elastomer in a PCP applica-
tion  depends  heavily  on  its  mechanical  and  chemical  properties.13,14  Although  many  different
mechanical  properties  can  be  quantified  for  elastomers,  only  a  few  are  highly  relevant  to  PC
pump performance. One important property is hardness because it characterizes the relationship
between  the  rotor/stator  interference  fit  and  the  resulting  sealing  force.  Tear  strength  is  also
important because it provides a measure of an elastomer’s resistance to tearing and indicates its
fatigue  and  abrasion  resistance.  Although  abrasion  resistance  is  a  critical  parameter  in  many
applications, the ASTM abrasion tests (drum, tabor, pico) do not represent the PC pump wear
mode and should be interpreted with caution. Dynamic properties, which characterize the hys-
teretic heat buildup behavior, are not overly critical in PC pumps because the flexing frequen-
cies  of  the  single-lobe  geometries  are  generally  not  high  enough  to  result  in  significant
temperature rise, except when the fit is very tight or heat removal is minimal. Although tensile
strength and elongation are commonly referenced properties, they have little practical relevance
to PC pumps other than their relationship to other mechanical properties because the elastomer
is strained to only a fraction of its capacity. Table 15.1 summarizes the most commonly refer-
enced  mechanical  properties,  along  with  any  corresponding  ASTM  and  DIN  test  references.
The range of values typical of commercially available PC pump elastomers is included to show
the variations that exist in these properties.

Chemical  resistance  is  normally  evaluated  through  compatibility  testing  with  the  fluids  in
question. Elastomer samples are exposed to the fluid in an autoclave environment for a prede-
termined  period  of  time  (typically  72  or  168  hours);  then,  the  volume  and  mass  change  are
measured. To be representative, these tests should also assess the change in mechanical proper-
ties  through  measurements  of  hardness  and,  if  possible,  tensile  strength  and  elongation.  Be-
cause these tests are performed on small samples (which seldom come from actual pumps) for

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-767

a limited period of time, they are most useful for ranking elastomers as opposed to determining
the actual swell level within a stator.

The chemical and mechanical properties of an elastomer are very sensitive to temperature,
and  the  nature  of  changes  in  these  properties  can  vary  dramatically  between  elastomers.  Al-
though testing is normally done at room temperature, in most cases the mechanical properties
will  deteriorate  significantly  with  increasing  temperature.  The  rate  of  fluid  swell  will  also  in-
crease  at  higher  temperatures,  although  in  most  cases  the  ultimate  level  of  swell  will  remain
the same. Whenever possible, any testing to evaluate elastomers should be done as close to the
anticipated downhole conditions as practical.

PC Pump Elastomers.  Most  PC  pump  manufacturers  have  stator  products  available  with
several different elastomer types. Because the formulations of these elastomers are considered
proprietary, there is no standard naming convention. Certain generic names are common to the
different manufacturers, but elastomer properties may vary significantly.

Although there is a wide range of different elastomer types, almost all PC pumps use some
variation of a synthetic nitrile elastomer. Within the class of nitrile elastomers, there is a virtu-
ally  unlimited  number  of  different  formulations  possible  with  an  associated  wide  range  of
mechanical  and  chemical  properties.  A  discussion  of  the  more  common  types  of  elastomers
used in PC pumps follows.

Nitrile  (NBR).    Most  elastomers  in  PC  pumps  can  be  classified  as  conventional  nitrile
(NBR).14 The base polymers for these elastomers are manufactured by emulsion copolymeriza-
tion  of  butadiene  with  acrylonitrile  (ACN).  ACN  contents  in  nitrile  elastomers  typically  vary
from  30  to  50%,  with  the  cost  of  the  elastomer  increasing  marginally  with  increasing  ACN
level. Most manufacturers distinguish between a medium nitrile (sometimes called Buna, which
typically has an ACN content < 40%) and a high nitrile (> 40% ACN). Increasing ACN levels
produce increasing polarity, which improves the elastomer’s resistance to nonpolar oils and sol-
vents.  However,  higher  ACN  levels  result  in  increased  swell  in  the  presence  of  such  polar
media  as  esters,  ketones,  or  other  polar  solvents  and  leads  to  a  decline  in  certain  mechanical
properties.  It  is  important  to  note  that  aromatics  such  as  benzene,  toluene,  and  xylene  swell
NBR elastomers considerably, regardless of ACN level.

NBR elastomers are normally sulfur cured, and the combination of sulfur with the natural
unsaturation of the elastomer can result in additional cross-linking and associated hardening in
the presence of heat. As a result, NBR elastomers are not recommended for continuous use at
temperatures  that  exceed  100°C  [212°F].  For  a  similar  reason,  NBR  elastomers  also  are  not
recommended for applications that contain high levels of H2S because the sour gas contributes
additional sulfur, which leads to post-vulcanization and surface hardening. These changes result
in a loss of resilience and elasticity, typically causing premature stator failure.

Historically, the hardness of NBR elastomers has been between 65 and 75 Shore A. More
recently,  manufacturers  have  introduced  soft  medium  NBRs  (55  to  60  Shore  A)  for  abrasive,
heavy oil applications. The rationale was that they would be more forgiving to the gravel and
iron pyrite solids that are produced occasionally and have a tendency to tear the stator material.
The soft elastomer requires the use of a higher degree of rotor/stator interference fit, which has
the advantage of maintaining some sealing even after extensive wear of the rotor or stator.

Hydrogenated NBR (HNBR).  Conventional NBR elastomers, especially when sulfur cured,
often  contain  a  large  degree  of  unsaturation  in  the  form  of  double  and  triple  carbon-carbon
bonds in the base polymer. Relative to a more stable single bond, these unsaturated hydrocar-
bon  groups  are  susceptible  to  chemical  attack  or  additional  cross-linking.  This  is  the  primary
reason why NBRs experience problems upon exposure to high temperatures, H2S, and aggres-
sive chemicals.

Through a hydrogenation process, it is possible to increase the saturation (i.e., decrease the
number  of  double  and  triple  carbon-carbon  bonds)  of  the  NBR  polymer,  thus  stabilizing  the

IV-768

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

associated elastomer. The degree of saturation can vary, but typically it is > 90% and can be
as high as 99.9%. If the saturation is very high, then a sulfur cure system is no longer effec-
tive,  and  a  peroxide  cure  must  be  used.  These  compounds  are  typically  referred  to  as  highly
saturated  nitriles  (HSN)  or  hydrogenated  nitriles  (HNBR).15–17  For  an  equivalent  volume,  the
cost  of  an  HNBR  elastomer  is  typically  four  times  that  of  a  conventional  NBR,  making  the
stators made from such elastomers considerably more expensive.

The primary advantage of an HNBR is increased heat resistance. Sulfur-cured HNBRs can
ideally be used up to 125°C [257°F], whereas higher-saturation peroxide-cured compounds can
potentially  be  used  in  applications  with  temperatures  up  to  150°C  [300°F].  Other  advantages,
especially  if  the  elastomer  is  peroxide  cured,  include  improved  chemical  resistance  and  H2S
tolerance. The mechanical properties of HNBR elastomers usually are similar to those of NBR
elastomers.

Most  PC  pump  manufacturers offer  HNBR  stators,  but  the  limited number  of  applications
that warrant the higher cost have kept their use to relatively low levels. Historically, the HNBR
polymers have been highly viscous and difficult to inject into stators, increasing manufacturing
costs substantially. However, within the last few years, the polymer manufacturers have intro-
duced  lower-viscosity,  high-ACN  HNBR  elastomers.  As  a  result,  pump  manufacturers  have
taken  a  renewed  interest  in  these  elastomers,  which  may  lead  to  more  use  of  HNBR  com-
pounds in stator products in the future.

Fluoroelastomers (FKMs).  FKMs have been expanding in availability and use over the last
decade. Although a number of different varieties of FKMs are available, common to all is the
presence of high levels of fluorine that saturate the carbon chain. The carbon-fluorine bonds in
FKMs  are  extremely  strong,  giving  this  formulation  heat  and  chemical  resistance  superior  to
that of most other elastomers.

FKMs are, to a large extent, made up of the fluoro-polymer and thus contain a low level of
fillers  and  additives.  As  a  result,  the  mechanical  properties  of  FKMs  tend  to  be  inferior  to
those of NBR and HNBR elastomers. In terms of chemical stability, they have excellent resis-
tance to heat, although their mechanical properties tend to deteriorate further at high tempera-
tures  from  already  relatively  low  initial  levels.  A  variety  of  cure  systems  are  used  for  FKM
elastomers,  including  peroxide,  but  they  require  an  extended  post-curing  session  to  optimize
their  properties,  adding  considerably  to  manufacturing  process  costs.  As  a  result,  the  cost  for
an equivalent volume of FKM elastomer may range from 20 to several hundred times that of a
conventional  NBR.  This  makes  all  but  the  lower-cost  grades  of  FKMs  uneconomical  for  PC
pump stators, and even those that are viable carry a high cost premium.

The primary advantage of an FKM elastomer is the increased heat and chemical resistance.
FKM  elastomers  have  the  potential  to  be  used  up  to  200°C  [400°F]  as  long  as  they  are  not
subject  to  excessive  mechanical  loading  (proper  sizing  of  PC  pumps  is  critical).  In  terms  of
fluid resistance, they have minimal swell with most oilfield fluids, including aromatics.

General use of FKM elastomers in PC pump applications is relatively recent, with several
PC pump manufacturers now offering these products. Some success has notably been encoun-
tered  in  lighter-oil  applications  in  which  NBR  stators  swell,  necessitating  multiple  rotor
changes. Despite being expensive, FKM stator products appear to be viable in certain applica-
tions, especially if the pumps are sized properly and extended run times are achieved.

Elastomer Selection.  Elastomer selection for a particular application involves deciding on a
particular formulation or type (i.e., medium or high NBR, HNBR, or FKM) and a specific sta-
tor  supplier  because  the  basic  formulations  differ  between  manufacturers.  For  the  most  part,
elastomer selection is based on the downhole conditions and required fluid resistance. Although
mechanical properties are also important, sufficient detailed information is not routinely avail-
able from the PC pump manufacturers to make this a consideration in elastomer selection.

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-769

Most manufacturers publish guidelines for elastomer selection that are based on anticipated
downhole conditions, including fluid type, gases, solids, and operating temperature. Historical-
ly, API fluid gravity has been used as the primary measure of fluid aggressiveness in terms of
elastomer swell and associated property deterioration. Although a strong trend does exist direc-
tionally,  problems  can  arise  when  API  gravity  is  used  as  the  main  selection  criterion  (i.e.,
especially  at  the  higher  end),  given  that  fluids  of  the  same  gravity  can  have  vastly  different
compositions  of  the  aromatic  components  that  cause  swell.  There  are  exceptions  to  this  rule,
such as the heavy oil fields in Venezuela, where the gravity is low but the quantity of aromat-
ics  is  relatively  high  and  can  lead  to  problems  with  fluid  swell.  Although  the  exact  value
varies  somewhat  between  manufacturers,  the  crossover  point  for  medium  to  high  NBR  use  is
typically about 25°API. Most manufacturers do not recommend the use of a conventional NBR
beyond 35 to 40°API. At the higher API gravities, the only options are FKM or perhaps HN-
BR formulations, although these elastomers are available only from certain manufacturers and
their use is usually restricted to a narrow range of applications.

When  a  question  exists  as  to  the  best  elastomer  to  use,  it  is  common  practice  to  perform
compatibility tests with the wellbore fluid and selected elastomer samples. These tests general-
ly provide an effective means to rank the suitability of different elastomers (i.e., especially of
the same type from different manufacturers) and can be helpful in establishing appropriate ro-
tor sizing. Results almost always consist of volume, mass, and hardness change and, in some
cases,  may  include  changes  in  mechanical  properties.  From  previous  testing  experience  and
tracking of pump performance, most pump suppliers have established limits for the maximum
volume and hardness change for which they recommend use of their products.

Although compatibility testing provides a more scientific way to select elastomers, it is not
practical  in  many  cases  because  it  is  difficult  to  get  the  well  fluids,  representative  elastomer
samples, and a laboratory that does the specialized testing all in the same location. Neverthe-
less, there are a number of techniques based solely on fluid analyses that may be used to assist
in elastomer selection. Hydrocarbon analysis through chromatographic techniques has been the
most  widely  used  method,  but  for  it  to  be  helpful  in  assessing  elastomer  compatibility,  the
analysis must include detection of the hexanes plus. This results in a breakdown (mole, mass,
and  volume  percent)  by  component  up  to  C30+,  so  the  test  is  often  referred  to  by  this  name
(i.e.,  C30+).  Results  are  normally divided into  paraffin,  aromatic, and  naphthene groups,  with
breakdowns  of  specific  components  within  each  group.  The  most  useful  information  includes
the total percent aromatics and levels of individual aromatic components. Most PC pump manu-
facturers  are  familiar  with  this  testing  method  and  have  guidelines  on  the  maximum  percent
aromatics recommended for each of their elastomers. A less expensive, more readily available
method for fluid analysis is an aniline point test (ASTM D611). Aromatic hydrocarbons exhibit
the lowest aniline point (e.g., 60°C [140°F] for diesel), whereas oils with low aromatics typical-
ly  have  values  that  are  >  100°C  [212°F].  This  test  has  been  used  extensively  to  assess
elastomer compatibility in the drilling industry, but its use for PC pumps is new, so relation-
ships between aniline point and recommended elastomers are still being compiled.

The limitations to the elastomer selection “rules” associated with API gravity or hydrocar-
bon  analysis  are  usually  the  result  of  temperature  or  H2S.  Conventional  NBR  elastomers  are
normally  not  recommended  for  temperatures  >  100°C  [212°F]  or  with  H2S  concentrations
> 2% because of the elastomer hardening that occurs over time, frequently leading to cracking
and fatigue. In these cases, HNBR or FKM elastomers are more appropriate choices. However,
caution must be exercised when these elastomers are considered because the fluid resistance of
the  HNBR  elastomers  varies  significantly  by  manufacturer  and  mechanical  loading  considera-
tions must be addressed with FKM elastomers.

Despite all these selection methods, it is important to point out that operators are typically
faced  with  using  a  “trial-and-error”  approach  to  determine  optimal  elastomer  selection  and
pump sizing when applying PCP systems in new areas.

Rod  Strings  and  Production  Tubing.    Surface-driven  PCP  systems  require  a  sucker-rod
string to transfer the torsional and axial loads from the surface drive system down to the bot-
tomhole  PC  pump.  Although  conventional  sucker  rods18  continue  to  be  used  in  many  PCP
applications, some rod manufacturers have developed products designed especially for PCP ap-
plications:  (1)  larger-diameter  rods  (e.g.,  25.4  mm  [1.0  in.]  and  37.5  mm  [1.5  in.])  to  handle
the  high  loads  associated  with  large-displacement  PCPs;  (2)  hollow  rods  designed  to  handle
high  loads  and  to  facilitate  downhole  injection  of  diluents  or  treatment  fluids;  (3)  rods  with
different connection designs that minimize the coupling diameter to reduce flow losses (typical-
ly,  the  pin  diameter  is  reduced  one  size  relative  to  standard  rods,  e.g.,  25.4  mm  [1  in.]  rods
fabricated  with  22.2  mm  (⅞  in.)  pin  connections,  which  allows  the  use  of  smaller-diameter
couplings); and (4) relatively large-diameter (e.g., up to 29.2 mm [1.15 in.]) round continuous
rod.

Several  different  rod-string  configurations  are  commonly  used  in  PCP  applications.  These
include  continuous  rods,  standard  rods  with  couplings  (including  hollow  rods),  standard  rods
with  centralizers,  and  standard  rods  with  bonded/molded  rod  guides.  Within  these  categories
are  numerous  additional  variations  resulting  from  differences  in  centralizer  and  rod  guide  de-
sign.  The  centralizers  can  be  divided  into  two  groups  based  on  functionality.  The  first  group
consists  of  “coated”  centralizers  that  have  a  urethane,  plastic,  or  elastomer  sleeve  bonded  to
either  a  coupling  or  the  rod  body.  The  second  group  consists  of  “spin-thru”  centralizers  that
have an outer stabilizer that is free to rotate on either an inner core or the rod body. With the
spin-thru  design,  the  rod  string  rotates  inside  the  stabilizer,  which  remains  stationary  against
the tubing. Fig. 15.8 shows several different types of centralizers and rod guides. Continuous-
rod  products  are  not  currently  available  in  all  countries  but  are  used  extensively  in  Canada,
Venezuela, and selected regions of the U.S.

The  production  tubing  strings  used  in  most  PCP  applications  are  typical  of  those  used  in
most other oil and gas production operations. The tubulars conform to API product standards,19
with EUE and NU connections and Grade 55 pipe used in most cases. In some situations, large-
diameter tubing strings are warranted to contend with high flow losses or to facilitate the use
of an alternative PC pumping system (see below), and small-diameter casing products are used

instead.  Some  special  internally  coated  tubing-string  products,  including  boron-coated  tubing
and tubing with polyethylene liners, are available for use in applications in which wear and/or
corrosion problems may occur.

Surface Drive Systems.  The surface equipment used in a conventional surface-driven PCP
system must perform the following functions: suspend the rod string and carry the axial loads;
deliver  the  torque  required  at  the  polished  rod;  safely  rotate  the  polished  rod  at  the  required
speed;  provide  for  safe  release  of  the  stored  energy  during  shutdowns;  and  prevent  produced
fluid from escaping the system. To facilitate these requirements, all surface equipment systems
include a wellhead drive unit (drive head), a stuffing box, power transmission equipment, and a
prime  mover,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  15.9.  In  addition,  the  surface  equipment  may  also  include
safety  shutdown  devices,  torque  limiters,  recoil  control  devices,  and  electronic  speed  control
(ESC) and monitoring systems.

Wellhead Drive Units.  The wellhead drive unit consists of a wellhead frame, thrust bearing,
a polished-rod braking system (in most cases), and sometimes a fixed gear or belt and sheave
system. Fig. 15.10 shows two types of drive heads. In many cases, the wellhead frame threads
directly  onto  the  tubing  head.  However,  there  is  a  growing  trend  toward  the  use  of  flanged
connections, especially for applications involving drive systems that are 60 hp or larger. These
systems  facilitate  proper  alignment  of  the  drive  on  the  wellhead  to  help  prevent  stuffing  box
leakage and provide sufficient strength to carry the much heavier drive heads and motors used
today.  The  drive  heads  typically  mount  onto  composite  pumping  tees,  which  in  turn  mount
onto the casing head. Note that the wellhead frame usually incorporates the stuffing box assem-
bly  and  that  some  units  are  fabricated  to  allow  mounting  of  either  electric  prime  movers  or
hydraulic motors.

One important function of the drive head is to support the axial rod-string load. The thrust
bearing,  contained  in  the  wellhead  frame,  supports  this  load  while  allowing  the  rod  string  to
rotate with minimal friction. Most wellhead frames are available with a variety of thrust bear-
ings  to  suit  different  loading  applications.  The  expected  life  of  the  thrust  bearing  is  usually
quantified by an L10 rating. Within a large sample, the median bearing life is typically between
four and five times the L10 life.

Most drive heads have either a hollow shaft or an integral shaft design that facilitates the
connection  of  the  drive  to  the  polished  rod.  With  the  most  common  hollow  shaft  design,  the
polished rod passes through the entire wellhead and is suspended by a polished-rod clamp that
seats into a drive slot on top of the wellhead frame. In a modification of this design, a hexago-
nal rod substitutes for the polished rod, and the drive unit has a mating hollow shaft through
which torque is applied to the rod. Polished rod and stuffing box exposure depends on whether
the particular design incorporates an open (Fig. 15.10a) or closed (see Fig. 15.10b) frame. The

hollow  shaft  design  allows  some  repositioning  of  the  rod  string  without  removal  of  the  well-
head. This is done by loosening the polished rod clamp, raising or lowering the polished rod as
required, and then tightening the clamp. This flexibility to reposition the rod string simplifies
rod  space-out  procedures,  flush-bys,  and  the  repositioning  of  the  rod  string  to  prevent  wear-
related  failures.  In  drives  with  an  integral  shaft  design,  the  polished  rod  threads  directly  into
the drive mechanism as opposed to passing through it. As a result, the only way to reposition
the rod string is to add pony rods of different lengths to change the string length. Initial space-
out procedures and flush-bys are not easily accommodated with the integrated shaft design.

Drive heads also incorporate a stuffing box that seals on the rotating polished rod to con-
trol  fluid  leakage  from  the  production  string  and  wellhead.  The  two  basic  types  of  stuffing
boxes available are conventional and specialty (i.e., rotating) systems. The conventional stuff-
ing boxes function similar to those used with beam-pump systems. They use a special packing
material  compressed  against  the  polished  rod  to  effect  a  seal;  (i.e.,  the  rod  rotates  directly
against  the  packing  material,  so  the  compressive  loading  imposed  by  tightening  the  stuffing
box must balance the resultant friction forces against fluid seal integrity). These stuffing boxes
require regular inspection and maintenance (i.e., greasing and tightening). Rotating stuffing box-
es are designed to seal differently, typically incorporating an inner sleeve that seals against the
polished  rod  and  rotates  with  it  during  operation.  Additional  seals  designed  to  operate  in  a
clean fluid environment provide a seal between the rotating sleeve and the fixed outer housing
of the stuffing box. A clean lubricating oil environment is ideally maintained in this interstitial
region during operation. One key consideration for stuffing box selection is access for packing
material or seal replacement, and another is tightening of the packing as required. To minimize
stuffing box leakage and maintenance requirements, it is also important to ensure that the pol-
ished  rod  has  not  been  bent.  Some  new  stuffing  box  designs  rely  on  injectable  packing
materials  (viscous  materials  that  require  an  injection  pressure  of  approximately  7  MPa  [1,000
psi] that readily facilitate repacking of a stuffing box).

Normally,  drive  heads  are  connected  to  the  power  transmission  equipment  by  a  vertical
shaft (Fig. 15.10b). However, horizontal connections can be facilitated by incorporating right-

angle  gearboxes  directly  into  the  drive  head  (Fig.  15.10a).  These  gearboxes  typically  enclose
gears that provide a reduction ratio of up to 4:1. To prevent gearbox failure, operators should
adhere to manufacturer guidelines for maximum gearbox speed and torque.

Power Transmission Equipment.  Power transmission equipment is used to transmit power
(torque  and  speed)  from  the  prime  mover  to  the  polished  rod.  This  equipment  almost  always
incorporates some type of speed reduction/torque transfer system that permits the prime mover
to  operate  at  a  higher  speed  and  lower  torque  than  the  polished  rod.  In  some  cases,  power
transmission components, such as gearboxes and fixed speed belts and sheaves, are integrated
into the drive head.

Power transmission equipment can be arranged in a variety of different configurations as is
illustrated  in  Fig.  15.11.  The  various  configurations  can  include  almost  any  combination  of
hydraulic equipment, belts and sheaves, and gearboxes to provide the desired operating speed
and  torque  characteristics. Note  that power  transmission  equipment is  usually  classified as  ei-
ther  direct  drive  or  hydraulic  on  the  basis  of  whether  or  not  it  incorporates  hydraulic  system
components.

Hydraulic  power  transmission  systems  incorporate  a  hydraulic  system  between  the  prime
mover  and  the  input  shaft  of  either  a  gearbox  or  fixed  speed  belt  and  sheave  system  that  is
integrated into the drive head. The hydraulic system itself consists of a hydraulic pump connect-
ed  to  the  output  shaft  of  the  prime  mover,  various  intermediate  valves  and  plumbing,  and  a
hydraulic motor attached to the input shaft of the drive head (Fig. 15.12a). Note that variable
displacement  hydraulic  pumps  and  motors  are  typically  used.  Additional  required  components
include a hydraulic fluid reservoir and fluid filtration system. All hydraulic equipment, except
the  hydraulic  motor  and  connecting  hoses,  is  usually  mounted  on  a  skid  (Fig.  15.12b).  The
torque delivered by the hydraulic motor to the drive head is proportional to the hydraulic sys-
tem pressure and a function corresponding to the hydraulic motor design. The hydraulic system
flow rate may be controlled with either prime-mover speed control systems or, more common-
ly, pump displacement adjustments (i.e., through changes in the swash plate position in variable-
displacement  pumps)  to  set  the  rotational  speed  of  the  hydraulic  motor.  The  relationship
between  prime-mover  speed  and  hydraulic  motor  speed  is  a  function  of  the  relative  displace-
ments  of  the  hydraulic  pump  and  motor.  As  an  alternative,  some  vendors  also  sell  in-line
hydraulic drive units that use high-torque, low-speed hydraulic motors to drive the polish rod
directly without any gear or belt and sheave reduction. These units tend to be relatively com-
pact and quiet compared with the more standard systems.

Direct-drive power transmission systems can be categorized as mechanical fixed speed, me-
chanical  variable  speed,  or  electronic.  Mechanical  fixed  speed  refers  to  a  direct-drive  system
with  a  fixed  gear  ratio  powered  by  a  prime  mover  that  can  operate  at  a  single  speed  (i.e.,
typically an AC electric motor). Mechanical variable-speed systems have either internal combus-
tion  prime  movers  that  can  operate  at  variable  speeds  or  a  belt  and  sheave  system  that
accommodates a variety of sheave sizes. To vary pump speed in the latter case, the well must
be shut down to permit changing of the sheaves. Electronic systems consist of an electric mo-
tor with an ESC system. Fig. 15.13 shows different types of direct-drive systems.

The  features  of  the  different  types  of  power  transmission  systems  are  compared  in  Table
15.2.  Although  hydraulic  systems  are  typically  less  efficient  than  direct  electric  drives,  they

generally require little field infrastructure and have a high variable-speed turndown rate, which
makes them popular for low-rate, high-viscosity applications in which prime-mover speeds are
much  higher  than  pump  speeds  and  flexible  speed  control  is  desirable.  The  simplicity  of  me-
chanical fixed- and variable-speed systems makes them practical for applications in which fluid
rates  are  relatively  stable  and  speed  adjustment  requirements  are  limited.  The  direct-electric-
drive  systems  typically  have  better  energy  efficiency  than  hydraulic  drives,  although  they
typically are more expensive and can be more difficult to repair. Field electrification is usually
required for effective use of electric-drive systems.

Prime Movers.  The  prime  mover  provides  the  energy  to  drive  the  surface  equipment  and
ultimately the rod string and downhole pump. The amount of power that the prime mover must
deliver depends on the power demand at the polished rod and the efficiency of the power trans-
mission  system.  Typical  prime-mover  power  ratings  range  from  4  to  75  kW  [5  to  100  hp],
although higher capacity wellhead units designed to accommodate twin electric motors provid-
ing  power  up  to  225  kW  [300  hp]  have  recently  been  introduced  by  several  vendors  in
conjunction with new large displacement PC pumps.

The two types of prime movers commonly used to drive PCP systems are internal combus-
tion  engines  and  electric  motors.  Internal  combustion  engines  (Fig.  15.13b)  have  the  advan-
tages  of  a  simple  setup  with  minimum  capital  investment  and  variable-speed  capability.  They
are  often  used  on  wells  in  remote  areas  where  electricity  is  not  available.  In  some  situations,
depending on gas production and composition, it is possible to fuel the engine with produced
gas.  Nevertheless,  electric  motors  are  the  most  common  form  of  prime  mover  used  for  PCP
systems because of low maintenance requirements, high efficiency, low energy costs, easy oper-
ation,  and  low  noise  levels.  The  major  disadvantage  of  using  electric  motors  for  the  prime
mover is that the cost of powering the motor can be prohibitively high unless the well site is
electrified. Another drawback is that speed adjustment is possible only through sheave changes,
motor rewiring, or the use of ESC systems.

Most  electric  motors  used  as  prime  movers  in  PCP  applications  are  three-phase,  squirrel-
cage induction motors. The operating characteristics of an induction motor are illustrated in the
speed-vs.-torque  curve  in  Fig.  15.14.  During  motor  startup,  the  difference  between  the  devel-
oped torque and load torque determines the rate at which the motor will accelerate up to speed.
If sustained, the large current draw during startup would cause permanent motor stator damage.
Therefore,  the  startup  torque  capabilities  of  the  system  must  be  well  above  (e.g.,  1.25–1.5×)
that  required  by  the  system  operating  load.  Note  that  in  PCP  applications,  the  static  friction
within  the  pump,  combined  with  initial  system  inertial  loads,  can,  in  some  cases,  cause  the
torque required at startup to be substantially higher than the normal operating torque. In partic-
ular, the startup or breakaway torque of the pump can be affected by excessive compression set
or  swelling  of  the  elastomer.  Fig.  15.14  shows  that  the  normal  operating  range  for  motors  is
the  linear  region  below  the  full-load  torque  (i.e.,  torque  required  to  produce  rated  power  at
rated  speed).  Continuous  operation  at  torques  above  the  full-load  torque  may  result  in  exces-
sive heat generation, which will cause permanent motor damage.

High-efficiency motors designed to NEMA B standards20 (see Chap. 8 in the Facilities and
Construction  Engineering  section  of  the  Handbook)  are  typically  used  in  PCP  applications.
They  characteristically  have  startup  torques  of  between  125  and  150%  of  full  load  (i.e.,  for
motors with synchronous speeds of 1,200 rpm), breakdown torques of 200% of full load, and a
slip of < 5%. In addition, because the motors are unsheltered in most PCP installations, totally
enclosed  fan-cooled  motor  enclosures  are  typically  used  for  these  applications.  The  fans  are
considered critical for providing adequate cooling to prevent damage to the motor under warm-

climate  operating  conditions.  Most  PCP  drive  systems  use  six  pole  motors  that  operate  at
slightly < 1,200 rpm with supply power of 460 V and 50 to 60 Hz.

Nominal  power  factors  are  sometimes  quoted  by  manufacturers  based  on  operation  at  full
load under the rated voltage, current, and frequency conditions. For the induction motors used
in PCP applications, nominal power factors typically range from 0.80 to 0.90. However, motors
are designed to operate with a maximum power factor when loaded to full capacity, and this is
often not the case in the field. Actual power factors can be measured during motor operation
with specialized equipment.

Nominal overall energy conversion efficiency values for electric motors are often quoted by
manufacturers  based  on  operation  at  full  load  under  the  rated  voltage,  current,  and  frequency
conditions.  In  the  range  of  motor  sizes  used  in  PCP  applications,  nominal  efficiencies  range
between approximately 90 and 95%. However, as for the power factor, motors are designed to
operate  at  maximum  efficiency  when  loaded  to  full  capacity.  Operation  above  or  below  full
capacity or deviations from rated conditions will result in lower efficiencies.

Motor power factors and efficiency values may decrease when a motor is used in less-than-
ideal  operating  environments  (e.g.,  high  ambient  temperatures)  or  with  increased  motor  age.
Thus, differences between summer and winter operating conditions should be taken into consid-
eration with respect to motor performance and efficiency.

Safety Shutdown Devices.  Surface equipment components, such as the hydraulic system or
the prime mover, may be at risk of sustaining costly damage if allowed to operate continuously
under  certain  conditions.  As  a  result,  surface  drive  systems  usually  incorporate  devices  that
automatically shut the system down when adverse conditions exist. For example, hydraulic sys-
tems often have a switch to shut the system down if the hydraulic fluid level drops too low;
internal  combustion  engines  usually  have  high-engine-temperature  and  low-oil-pressure  shut-
down switches; and many electronic systems are equipped with high-current shutdown switches.
Torque Limiters.  Bottomhole pump seizures resulting from sanding or elastomer swelling,
parted tubing, and blocked flowlines can all result in a sudden escalation in rod-string torque.
If uninterrupted, the power transmission equipment will continue to increase the applied torque
until the rod string or some other component fails. To prevent such failures, torque limiters are
installed on the surface equipment to ensure that polished-rod torque cannot exceed some pre-

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

set  limit.  Hydraulic  systems,  for  example,  typically  use  a  pressure  control  valve  that  allows
some  hydraulic  fluid  to  bypass  the  hydraulic  motor  when  the  system  pressure  becomes  too
high. This reduces rod-string speed while allowing the prime mover to keep operating at a safe
torque level. Electronic drives either receive torque feedback from a mechanical device on the
drive  head  or  determine  torque  directly  with  special  algorithms.  When  this  operating  torque
exceeds the preset limit, the electronic drive will reduce the rod-string speed in an attempt to
lower torque. If that fails, the drive will eventually shut the prime mover off.

ESC Systems.  ESC  systems  are  used  to  vary  the  speed  of  direct-drive  systems.  ESC  sys-
tems incorporate an inverter operating from a three-phase power source, a control system that
directs  and  excites  the  inverter,  and  an  induction  motor.  Currently,  several  variations  of  ESC
systems are being used in PCP applications. The primary difference between these systems is
in the control system strategy and types of inverters used. Motor speed is controlled by adjust-
ing  the  frequency  of  the  input  power  signals  generated  by  the  inverter  on  the  basis  of  the
control system algorithms.

Most  ESC  systems  typically  operate  the  electric  motor  at  a  speed  setpoint,  although  more
advanced systems also allow torque-based control. Three-phase AC power is fed into a rectifier
circuit that produces a DC bus. The pulse-width-modulated inverter draws energy from this bus
and  creates  three-phase  AC  power  at  the  frequency  commanded  by  the  control  system.  Al-
though basic speed control is typically open loop, the more elaborate systems often use closed-
loop  speed  control  capabilities.  The  control  modules  of  more  advanced  ESC  systems  may
incorporate  sophisticated  motor  algorithms,  microprocessors,  and  digital  signal  processors  to
perform a multitude of motor current, magnetic flux, rotor slip, winding resistance, temperature
correction, and magnetizing reactance calculations using several different feedback signals from
the motor. The system then uses this information to achieve the desired motor operating condi-
tion. Fig. 15.15 shows a block diagram illustrating the typical configuration for these systems.
Most ESC systems allow programming of such basic control options as torque limits, speed
ramping,  and  regenerative  braking.  More  advanced  systems  include  features  like  automatic
restart after fault trips and delays, frequency skipping to avoid resonance, and power-loss ride-
through. Many ESC systems also have an optional serial communications interface that enables
digital  links  to  programmable  logic  controllers  or  computers  for  remote  access  to  monitoring,
adjustment, and control functions.

Rod-String Backspin Control Devices.  When a surface-driven PCP system is in operation,
a significant quantity of energy is stored in the torsional strain of the rods and within the fluid
column above the pump within the tubing string. The development and use of larger-displace-

IV-778

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

ment  and  higher-pressure-capacity  PC  pumps  have  led  to  a  substantial  increase  in  the  magni-
tude of the torsional strain and fluid energy that become stored in the production system during
normal  pumping  operations.  The  stored  energy  is  released  with  backspin  of  the  pump  and/or
rod string whenever the PCP system is shut down through routine operator intervention or auto-
matic power cutoff in high-torque-overload cases. When the power supply to the drive is lost
or interrupted, the potential energy that remains in the system will cause the surface equipment
and drive string to accelerate in the direction opposite its normal operating mode. Uncontrolled
backspin  can  lead  to  surface  equipment  damage  and  backed-off  rod  strings  or  tubing.  These
conditions also pose a significant hazard to field personnel working on or near the surface equip-
ment.  Thus,  it  is  essential  that  brakes  be  used  to  control  the  release  of  rod-string  torque  and
restrict  rod  recoil  to  a  safe  speed.  In  many  applications,  if  unrestrained  by  the  surface  drive/
brake equipment, backspin speeds can increase to the point at which the drive-head sheaves or
motor fans fragment and “explode” radially outward because of the high centrifugal forces gen-
erated.

Typically, two different types of backspin events may occur: the seized pump scenario, in
which  the  pump  rotor  seizes  within  the  stator,  and  the  normal  shutdown  scenario  that  occurs
during routine shutdowns of the pumping system. Upon shutdown in the seized pump case, the
pump has stopped turning and the torsional strain energy (i.e., twists) stored in the rod string
causes the surface system to start spinning in the reverse direction until all the energy is dissi-
pated. The response period is generally short, and little or no fluid drains from the production
tubing because of the seized-pump condition. In the normal shutdown case, fluid remaining in
the  production  tubing  drains  back  to  the  well  through  the  pump,  causing  both  the  pump  and
the  drive  system  to  accelerate  backward.  This  continues  until  the  fluid  energy  in  the  tubing
(i.e., fluid level) is balanced by the fluid column in the annulus and the pump friction, which
can take anywhere from several minutes to hours, depending on the circumstances.

Several  incidents  have  occurred  in  which  uncontrolled  backspin  of  a  PCP  system  drive
head  has  led  to  explosive  sheave  fragmentation.  In  a  few  cases,  personnel  were  struck  by
sheave fragments and seriously injured. This has led to a heightened awareness by equipment
manufacturers and operators of the need to ensure that surface equipment (i.e., particularly the
braking  system)  is  properly  sized  for  each  application  and  to  implement  operating  and
workover procedures that enhance worker safety.

Most drive heads are equipped with some type of brake system to limit backspin speeds to
the allowable speed ratings of the drive-head and sheave components. Table 15.3 summarizes
the major types of recoil control devices used in PCP systems.

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-779

In hydraulic systems, when the rods backspin, the hydraulic motor becomes a pump, caus-
ing the hydraulic fluid to flow in the reverse direction through the system. Braking is usually
accomplished by forcing the fluid to pass through a flow restriction. Standalone hydraulic con-
striction  devices  use  a  hydraulic  pump  driven  by  rod  backspin  to  force  fluid  through  a  flow
restriction. Torque converters provide braking by forcing vanes to rotate within a viscous fluid.
Another  basic  type  of  recoil  control  device  uses  brake  pads  activated  either  mechanically  or
through  the  use  of  a  hydraulic  pump  driven  by  rod  backspin.  Regenerative  braking  has  been
incorporated into some of the newer ESC systems. With this type of braking, the electric motor
is  loaded  during  the  backspin,  causing  it  to  act  as  a  generator  and  convert  recoil  energy  into
electrical energy. However, the utility of these systems relies on the integrity of the drive-sys-
tem components (e.g., belts and sheaves) that link the polished rod and electric motor, which
poses additional risk of failure.

It is important for operators to ensure that the brake specifications of the drive equipment
installed  are  adequate  for  their  specific  application  conditions  under  both  backspin  scenarios
described above. Apart from physical compatibility with the drive system being used, it is im-
portant to consider the speed at which the braking device engages, the torque that it can resist,
and the energy that it can dissipate safely. If the recoil control device does not engage until the
rods reach a relatively high speed or if it cannot handle the amount of torque applied by the
rods, it may prove ineffective in preventing excessive backspin speeds.

15.1.4 Auxiliary Equipment.  This section outlines some auxiliary equipment commonly used
with PCP systems. a brief description of the design and application features of each product is
provided.

Tag Bar Assemblies and Tail Joints.  A tag bar or “rotor stop” is normally required to facil-
itate installation and spaceout of the rod string. Several different tag bar designs are available,
but they usually consist simply of a steel rod or bar (approximately 25 mm [1 in.] in diameter)
fastened widthwise across the middle of a short (e.g., 0.6 m [2 ft]) perforated tubing pup joint
that is threaded to the pump intake. In some designs, the rod is replaced with a steel plate with
holes  to  permit  fluid  flow.  The  number  and  shape  of  the  perforations  in  the  pup  joint  vary
among manufacturers. A large perforated area is particularly important in highly viscous fluid
applications to minimize flow losses and to facilitate sand flow to the pump intake. The pump
vendor usually supplies a tag bar joint with the PC pump.

Although  the  tag  bar  pup  is  usually  the  bottom  component  of  the  tubing  string  in  a  PC
pump completion, an additional length of tubing is sometimes run below the tag bar as a tail
joint to lower the pump intake. For example, in horizontal wells, the pump may be seated in
the vertical section to alleviate wear problems while a tail joint is installed to allow fluid to be
drawn from the curved or horizontal sections of the wellbore. This technique can also be used
effectively  to  increase  the  fluid  flow  velocity  below  the  pump,  which  can  be  important  for
maintaining  solids  in  suspension.  In  some  cases,  tail  joints  can  be  used  to  reduce  the  gas-to-
liquid ratio at the pump intake, although the pressure losses through the tail joint may lead to
additional solution gas breakout, resulting in little or no improvement in volumetric pump effi-
ciency. If tail joints are used, they should not be centralized and the string should be landed at
a position where the intake is on the low side of the wellbore to minimize the amount of free
gas that enters the pumping system.

Tubing  Anchors.    Most  PCP  systems  operate  in  the  clockwise  direction,  so  the  resistive
(i.e.,  friction)  torque  in  the  system  tends  to  unthread  the  production  tubing  connections.  As  a
result,  tubing  anchors  are  often  run  below  or  above  the  PC  pump  so  that  the  resistive  torque
loading  is  transferred  directly  to  the  casing.  They  also  alleviate  the  need  to  over-torque  the
tubing  connections  during  makeup,  which  can  substantially  increase  the  number  of  makeups
possible before thread damage occurs. Tubing anchors should be run with large-volume pumps
and  in  high-speed  applications  in  which  the  high  resistive  torques  and  system  vibrations  in-

IV-780

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

crease the potential for tubing backoff problems. Although several vendors supply conventional
tubing anchors that can be used in this application, several manufacturers sell products specifi-
cally designed for PC pumping systems that differ from conventional anchors in that they resist
torque  while  providing  minimal  axial  load  resistance.  This  facilitates  removal  of  the  tubing
string from a well that has sanded in.

Tubing Rotators.  When tubing wear is a major issue, such as in slant and horizontal wells,
tubing rotator systems can be used to substantially improve the service life of the tubing string.
Rotating tubing hangers that allow the tubing to be rotated while the pump is in operation have
been designed. The tubing is suspended by a thrust bearing, and a rotator mechanism that can
be ratcheted manually or can be equipped to rotate the tubing continuously is provided. Rotat-
ing tubing hanger products are available from several different vendors.

Tubing Drain.  Tubing drains provide an alternative means to drain produced fluid from the
production tubing string in PCP applications when the rotor cannot be pulled from the stator.
These devices are commonly run in wells that are prone to experiencing seized rotors because
of  a  buildup  of  produced  sand  above  the  pump  or  excessive  elastomer  swell.  The  drains  are
run  with  the  production  tubing  string  and  are  typically  located  a  few  tubing  joints  above  the
pump. To activate the drain, the production tubing is pressurized from surface to the point at
which the drain “blows” (i.e., a plate ruptures or shear pins fail), allowing the fluid column in
the tubing string to drain back to the casing annulus. The existing tubing drain products cannot
be reset (i.e., closed) from surface; therefore, the tubing string must be tripped to replace them
once they have been activated.

Tubing Centralizers.  PCP systems can experience severe vibration problems in some wells,
particularly those operating at high speeds. Tubing centralizers can be run in conjunction with
the  production  tubing  to  help  stabilize  the  string  and  reduce  the  vibration  amplitudes,  which
helps to mitigate tubing failures caused by backoff and/or fatigue.

Downhole Gas Separators.  Downhole gas separators are used routinely in the oil industry
to separate free gas from the production fluid before it enters the pump. Eliminating free gas
from the produced fluid reduces its compressibility and therefore increases the volumetric effi-
ciency  of  the  downhole  pump  (which  is  determined  based  on  liquid  volume  only).  The  gas
separators used in PCP applications are normally passive devices that simply create a flow path
that encourages the free gas to flow up the casing annulus. As a result, the completion details
(e.g.,  casing  size,  pump  seating  location,  and  use  of  torque  anchors)  can  have  a  significant
influence on the effectiveness of these devices. Flow losses within the separator may also af-
fect the amount of free gas entering the pump. A gas separator device designed specifically for
directional- and horizontal-well applications uses a weighted cam and swivel system to ensure
that the intake remains on the low side of the wellbore.

Monitoring and Control Systems.  Since the early 1990s, operators have begun to incorpo-
rate  field  instrumentation  and  logic  functions  into  process  control  systems  for  PCP  systems.21
These  systems  monitor  a  variety  of  production-related  parameters,  make  decisions  that  are
based  on  their  values,  and  then  automatically  implement  these  decisions.  For  example,  some
pumpoff control systems measure fluid levels or bottomhole pressures, compare the measured
values with preset upper and lower limits, and then adjust the pump speed to maintain the fluid
level  within  the  desired  range.  These  systems  hold  considerable  promise  for  reducing  manual
monitoring time, decreasing downtime, and increasing productivity.

Pressure and Flow Switches.  Pressure switches are used to shut down the PCP system in
the event of either excessive or low flowline pressures to prevent damage to or failure of the
surface or downhole equipment. Flow switches are used to control flow rates within prescribed
upper and lower limits and to shut down the system if the rates move outside the desired oper-
ating range (i.e., usually low-flow conditions).

15.1.5 Alternative PCP System Configurations.  Several nonstandard PCP systems have been
developed by various companies to improve pumping capacity, performance, and serviceability
for certain applications. These include a number of different downhole drive systems that inher-
ently  eliminate  tubing  wear  problems  and  reduce  fluid  flow  losses.  Rod-insert  PC  pump
designs  are  available  that  preclude  the  need  to  pull  the  tubing  string  for  pump  replacement.
Charge  pumps  and  fluidizer  pumps  are  currently  being  used  to  increase  the  gas-  and  solids-
handling capabilities of PCP systems. The following sections provide a brief description of the
rationale for developing each hybrid system and a description of the basic operating principles
of the product where applicable.

Electric Downhole Drive PCP Systems.  The use of PC pumps driven by conventional elec-
tric submersible pump (ESP) motors was first attempted by a Canadian operator in a heavy oil
well  in  1966,  unfortunately  with  little  success,  and  then  to  a  much  greater  extent  by  Russian
operators  in  the  1970s.  However,  only  within  the  last  decade  have  these  downhole  drive
(DHD)  PCP  systems  been  more  fully  developed  and  successfully  deployed  on  a  commercial
basis.22  Several  major  ESP  vendors  now  market  motors,  gear  boxes,  and  other  equipment  for
DHD PCP systems; as a result, these systems have begun to see wider use. The entire surface
unit  drive  system  and  rod  string  required  in  a  conventional  PCP  system  are  replaced  with  a
DHD  unit  that  typically  consists  of  an  ESP  motor  (either  a  2-  or  4-pole  design  that  has  syn-
chronous speeds of 3,600 and 1,800 rpm, respectively), a gearbox and flex-shaft assembly, and
a pump intake unit. Fig. 15.16 shows a schematic of a generic DHD system.

A key feature of the DHD systems is the gearbox/seal/flex-shaft assembly. Although vari-
ous  vendors  use  different  designs  and  configurations  for  these  components,  the  overall  func-
tions are typically the same: (1) to isolate the motor oil from the well fluids; (2) to provide a
speed  reduction  between  the  motor  and  the  pump;  (3)  to  isolate  the  motor  and  gearbox  from
the pump’s eccentric motion; (4) to support the thrust load generated by the pump; and (5) to
provide a path for the produced fluid to flow from the wellbore past the motor (i.e., for cool-
ing)  to  the  pump  inlet.  The  speed  reduction  is  necessary  because  2-  and  4-pole  ESP  motors

IV-782

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

normally rotate at 3,600 and 1,800 rpm, respectively (i.e., synchronous speed at 60 Hz), which
is  much  higher  than  the  ideal  operating  speed  for  PC  pumps.  The  eccentric  motion  of  the
pump  is  typically  absorbed  by  a  specially  designed  flex-shaft  or  knuckle-joint  assembly  posi-
tioned between the pump and the gear box.

DHD systems offer certain advantages in applications in which neither an ESP nor a rod-
driven  PCP  can  be  used  optimally.  For  example,  PC  pumps  generally  perform  better  than
conventional ESPs in viscous-oil, high-sand-cut, or high-GOR applications. In deviated or hori-
zontal wells, the rod strings required in surface-driven PCP systems create potential for severe
wear or fatigue problems, particularly if there is a large differential pressure on the pump. In
such cases, a DHD system may offer a better overall solution by combining the pumping capa-
bilities of a PC pump with the benefits of a rodless drive system. Eliminating sucker rods also
results in lower flow losses, which may, in some cases, allow less expensive, smaller-diameter
production tubing to be used. In addition, there are no backspin safety issues because the rotat-
ing parts are all run downhole. A DHD system also eliminates the need for a stuffing box at
surface,  thereby  reducing  the  potential  for  leaks.  Drawbacks  of  the  DHD  systems  include  the
additional capital and servicing costs associated with the power cable for the downhole motor,
some  size  restrictions,  and  in  most  cases,  additional  coordination  between  the  ESP  and  PCP
vendors  for  equipment  design,  supply,  installation,  and  service.  In  practice,  these  systems  are
normally used only in higher-rate applications because their use in low-productivity wells gen-
erally is not economical.

It  is  imperative  to  design  a  DHD  system  properly  because  changing  equipment  once  the
system  has  been  installed  in  a  well  is  costly.  Once  installed,  speed  control  can  be  achieved
only with a variable-frequency drive. It is important to ensure that the cable and seal systems
chosen are compatible with the well fluids to prevent premature system failure. Also, the pump
is not normally “sumped” because there must be liquid flow past the motor at all times during
operation to ensure that the motor is adequately cooled.23 Manufacturers recommend a 0.3 m/s
[1 ft/s] minimum liquid flow velocity past the motor, but this recommendation is based on high-
water-cut  ESP  system  designs  in  which  the  flow  is  turbulent.  With  viscous  oil,  it  is  possible
that the flow will be laminar, even at 0.3 m/s [1 ft/s], which may result in insufficient motor
cooling  and  thus  increased  potential  for  motor  failure.  Shrouded  systems  may  be  used  when
seating the pump below the perforations is desirable or when the flow velocity past the motor
is  expected  to  be  too  low  for  adequate  cooling.  Note,  however,  there  may  be  additional  flow
losses through the shroud that should be taken into consideration. During installation of DHD
systems, the susceptibility of the power cable to damage is a concern; thus, particularly in di-
rectional- and horizontal-well applications, the use of cable protectors is recommended.

Wireline-Retrievable DHD PCP Systems.  Recently,  DHD  PCP  systems  have  been  devel-
oped in which the motor, drive assembly (i.e., seals and gearbox) are run into the well on the
tubing string, and the pump (both rotor and stator) are run in and latched to the drive system
by  wireline.24  This  allows  relatively  fast  and  inexpensive  pump  replacement  when  necessary,
which is attractive in regions where rig costs are high or when frequent pump replacement is
required. These systems typically require large casing (e.g., typically 177 mm [7 in.]) and tub-
ing string sizes (e.g., 114 mm [4.5 in.] and larger) to accommodate the use of PC pumps with
adequate displacement capacities.

Hydraulic  DHD  PCP  Systems.    There  are  two  types  of  hydraulic  DHD  systems  for  PC
pumps that are either commercially available or are under development by different manufactur-
ers. These include a closed-loop hydraulic system with a downhole hydraulic motor driving a
PC  pump  and  a  closed-  or  open-loop  fluid-driven  PC  motor  coupled  to  a  PC  pump.  Both  of
these  hydraulic  drive  systems  require  a  surface  pump  and  a  fluid  handling  system  to  provide
power fluid to the downhole hydraulic motor. In an open-loop system, the power fluid is com-
mingled  with  the  produced  fluid  for  return  to  surface;  in  a  closed-loop  system,  a  separate

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-783

flowline is required for the return stream. In the closed-loop systems, hydraulic oil is typically
used as the power fluid, whereas water is normally used in open-loop systems. The systems in
which a second PC pump is used as a motor to drive the production pump are typically open-
loop designs, and the two pumps are sized relative to one another so that the power fluid used
to drive the motor pump is produced with the formation fluid back to surface by the produc-
tion pump. In viscous-fluid applications, this arrangement can provide the advantage of viscosi-
ty reduction and lower flow losses.

The major advantages of these systems are the elimination of the backspin hazard, stuffing-
box  leaks,  and  wear  and  failure  problems  associated  with  rod  strings.  Drawbacks  include  the
added  complexity  of  the  surface  facilities  and  downhole  completion,  higher  workover  costs,
and limited production rate capacity. The availability and use of these systems have been quite
limited.

Rod-Insert PCPs.  Rod-insert PCP systems are configured the same as the conventional sur-
face-driven systems, with the exception that both the rotor and stator are run on the rod string.
This  design  allows  the  stator  to  be  pulled  without  removal  of  the  tubing  string.  The  obvious
benefit to this design is savings in service rig time. The major drawback is the limitations im-
posed by standard tubing-string diameters on the size (i.e., displacement) of the PC pump that
can be deployed. Problems with latching and release of the downhole assembly can also be an
issue in some cases (e.g., sand buildup above the pump). Note that some of these systems rely
on the use of conventional pump hold-down subs designed for beam pump systems.

Tubing-Driven PCP Systems.  This type of system, currently at the prototype development
stage,  is  another  hybrid  of  the  conventional  surface-driven  PCP  system  in  which  the  tubing
string  is  used  to  drive  the  downhole  pump  and  to  provide  a  conduit  for  fluid  production  to
surface. The surface-drive system must support, rotate, and seal the tubing string, and the down-
hole  completion  must  be  modified  to  include  an  anchoring  system  for  the  stator,  a  swivel
fixture  to  facilitate  rotation  of  the  rotor  within  the  stator,  and  tubing  centralizers  to  prevent
casing wear. They are capable of delivering much higher torque to the pump than the conven-
tional  rod-driven  systems.  The  tubing  strings  should  also  be  equipped  with  centralizers  de-
signed to alleviate casing wear concerns.

Charge Pump Systems.  For  many  years,  Canadian  operators  have  successfully  used  PCP
systems  specially  configured  with  two  pumps  run  in  series  with  common  rod  and  tubing
strings.25 These so-called charge pump systems consist of a higher-displacement, low-lift pump
run below a lower-displacement, normal-lift pump, as illustrated in Fig. 15.17. The two pumps
are separated by one or more joints of tubing to facilitate the different rotor eccentricities and
the “timing” of the two rotor/stator pairs. Charge pumps are used to raise volumetric pumping
efficiency in gassy wells by using the larger-volume pump to compress the produced fluid sub-
stantially before it enters the second pump (on which the efficiency is based). This can allow
increased drawdown under gassy conditions and helps to ensure adequate fluid cooling of the
main  PC  pump,  which  facilitates  longer  run  life.  The  drawbacks  of  charge  pump  systems  in-
clude their increased capital cost, increased energy consumption because of the higher mechani-
cal  friction  of  the  system,  and  increased  pump  length,  which  makes  them  more  difficult  to
handle and install. A number of vendors supply these pumps on a special-order basis.

Fluidizer  Pumps.    Fluidizer  or  recirculating  pumps  are  simply  a  variation  of  the  charge
pump configuration. The basic difference between the two systems is that the tubing segment
separating  the  two  pumps  is  perforated  in  a  fluidizer  pump  configuration.  This  design  allows
some of the fluid produced by the larger pump to be recirculated back into the casing annulus
while still helping to improve the efficiency of the second pump. Fluidizer pumps are typically
used to help prevent sand bridging and settlement as a means to decrease the workover frequen-
cy in wells producing sand-laden fluids.26

Water  Reinjection  Systems.    In  addition  to  common  use  in  dewatering  coalbed  methane
wells, PCPs have been used to dewater gas wells. They have also seen use in conjunction with
downhole water injection systems27 and in various configurations of downhole oil/water separa-
tion systems.28 In a gas-well dewatering system with downhole injection, a packer and sealbore
assembly are used to isolate the producing zone from the lower water-disposal zone and a by-
pass sub is run below the PC pump (typically a rod-insert pump design which latches into the
bypass  sub  assembly).  The  PCP  system  operates  in  a  normal  manner,  pumping  the  water,
which  separates  by  gravity  from  the  gas  and  collects  above  the  packer,  into  the  production
tubing above the pump, while the gas flows to surface in the casing/tubing annulus. The water
builds  up  sufficient  head  in  the  tubing  string  to  create  flow  down  past  the  PC  pump  through
the bypass sub into the disposal zone. The PCP downhole oil/water separation systems tend to
be more complex in terms of the downhole equipment configuration given the added require-
ment  of  performing  effective  oil/water  separation  and  downhole  water  reinjection.  These
systems represent an emerging technology with relatively few field trials completed to date.

15.1.6 Industry  Standards.    As  mentioned,  despite  the  large  number  of  installations  world-
wide,  PC  pumps  and  drive  systems  do  not,  in  general,  conform  to  any  industry  standards  or
common specifications. As a result, there is significant variation in the products available from
different vendors, which generally precludes interchangeability of equipment components. The
nomenclature  (e.g.,  naming  conventions,  ratings)  used  in  conjunction  with  both  pumps  and
drive units also varies considerably, which can make it difficult for users to easily compare and
select  products  from  different  suppliers.  Nevertheless,  there  have  been  some  recent  efforts  to
develop industry standards for PCP systems.

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-785

In  the  late  1990s,  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  commissioned
the  development  of  a  standard  for  downhole  PC  pumping  systems.  This  effort  led  to  the  is-
suance of ISO Standard 15136-1, Part 1: Pumps29 in 2001, with further work currently being
undertaken to develop a Part 2 dealing with drive units. The published standard provides guide-
lines related to PC pump manufacturing, design, and bench testing; therefore, it is useful from
an informational perspective. However, the provisions of the standard tend to be very general,
and it does not attempt to preclude individual vendors from continuing to offer a unique line of
pump products with different elastomers. Although many provisions are consistent with the cur-
rent  practices  of  major  suppliers  of  PC  pump  products,  the  standard  as  a  whole  does  not
appear to have been widely adopted by the industry at this time, in part because of some of the
nomenclature requirements.

In response to a number of drive/sheave failures in the mid- to late-1990s, a group of surface-
drive  manufacturers  in  Canada  initiated  the  development  of  an  industry  standard  for  surface
drives  that  encompassed  braking  systems.30  The  standard  provides  guidelines  for  the  design,
specification, and use of PCP surface-drive units in an effort to support safe operation of this
equipment.

15.2 PCP System Design
PCP systems are, in general, highly flexible in terms of their ability to function effectively in a
diverse  range  of  applications.  As  with  other  artificial-lift  systems,  the  basic  objective  in  the
design of a PCP system is to select system components and operating parameters (e.g., pump
speed) that can achieve the desired fluid production rates while not exceeding the mechanical
performance capabilities of the equipment components to facilitate optimal service life and sys-
tem  value.  When  a  PCP  system  is  designed  for  a  particular  application,  both  the  system
components  and  operating  environment  must  be  considered  to  ensure  that  a  suitable  system
design is achieved.

15.2.1 Overview of the Design Process.  Fig. 15.18 presents a “design process” flow chart that
outlines  the  many  factors  and  considerations  that  should  be  addressed  in  the  selection  of  an
effective overall system configuration and operating strategy. At each step, the designer selects
certain  operating  parameters  or  specific  equipment  components  and  must  then  assess  the  im-
pacts of these decisions on system performance. For example, selection of a particular tubing
size is based on such design considerations as flow losses and casing size. Some considerations
apply to more than one decision, as is the case with flow losses that affect pump, tubing, and
rod-string selection. Other design considerations may produce conflicting results, which compli-
cates  the  decision-making  process.  For  example,  the  use  of  rod-string  centralizers  may  mini-
mize  wear  but  may  also  increase  flow  losses.  As  with  other  artificial-lift  systems,  the  design
process is generally iterative, and individual parameters are often adjusted to achieve an opti-
mal design for a particular application. As Fig. 15.18 shows, the primary design considerations
for  a  PCP  system  are  pump  selection  and  sizing,  fluid  flow  effects,  rod  loading  and  fatigue,
rod and tubing wear, and power transmission selection.

The first step in the design process is to gather information for the application of interest.
Past  experience,  fluid  properties,  production,  well  records,  and  reservoir  data  are  all  useful
sources  of  relevant  information.  Next,  it  is  necessary  to  determine  the  anticipated  fluid  rates.
These can be estimated from historical data or by setting a dynamic fluid level and calculating
production rates based on reservoir data and an inflow performance relationship.31 Initial values
must then be set for the wellbore geometry, pump-seating location, dynamic fluid level, tubing
size, and rod-string configuration. If the design is for an existing well, some of these parame-
ters may already be constrained.

Once these equipment and operating parameters are established, flow losses can be calculat-
ed. If the estimated flow losses are unacceptably high, they can be reduced by increasing the

IV-786

tubing size, reducing the rod-string induced flow restrictions, or decreasing the fluid rate. Next,
initial values for pump intake and discharge pressures, net lift, pump speed, and pump displace-
ment  can  be  set.  This  allows  the  designer  to  select  a  range  of  pump  models  capable  of
satisfying the desired pump displacement and lift requirements. However, if there are no pumps
available that meet both requirements, then the prescribed pump displacement and lift specifica-
tions  must  be  relaxed  by  decreasing  the  fluid  rate  expectations,  increasing  pump  speed,
reducing discharge pressure requirements, increasing pump intake pressure, or by implementing
some  combination  of  these  changes.  The  individual  pumps  that  satisfy  the  requirements  are

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-787

then  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  geometric  design  and  fluid  considerations  to  select  the  most
appropriate pump model.

Once  a  specific  pump  model  has  been  selected,  rod  loading,  rod-string/tubing  wear,  and
surface equipment requirements can be evaluated. If the calculated rod stresses exceed the al-
lowable value, then either the rod-string strength must be increased through the use of a larger
rod or higher-strength material, or the loading must be decreased through a reduction in the net
lift requirements or the use of a smaller-displacement pump. Similarly, if the predicted rod-string/
tubing wear rates are unacceptable, then steps must be taken to reduce axial loads (e.g., use of
a smaller pump), or the rod string must be reconfigured so that it is less prone to wear. After
the rod loading and wear considerations are satisfied, the final step in the design process is the
selection of surface equipment. If the available surface equipment cannot meet the polished-rod
power requirements, then the design process must be repeated to configure a downhole system
or  operating  parameters  that  result  in  reduced  system  loads.  For  example,  reduced  power  re-
quirements  can  be  achieved  by  lowering  the  pump  speed  (which  will  also  likely  lead  to  a
lower  differential  pump  pressure)  or  by  selecting  another  pump  with  a  smaller  displacement.
Once a final system design has been established, any areas of potential concern should be re-
evaluated  to  confirm  that  the  design  satisfies  the  functional  requirements  of  the  application
within acceptable operating guidelines.

It is quite apparent that the interdependency between the numerous equipment selection and
well completion options, variations in operating conditions, and complex fluid flow and mechan-
ical  interactions  that  affect  system  loading  and  performance  can  make  the  assessment  and
design of PCP systems difficult and time consuming. In new applications, numerous iterations
may  be  required  just  to  establish  a  workable  system.  Because  design  optimization  based  on
manual  calculations  is  usually  impractical,  computer  programs  have  been  developed  to  help
designers  work  faster  and  more  effectively.  The  following  sections  provide  further  details  on
specific design parameters.

15.2.2 Pump Selection.  Fig. 15.19 summarizes the key technical considerations and decisions
involved  in  selecting  a  PC  pump  for  a  particular  application  (note  that  other  considerations,
such as local vendor choice and economics, can also affect pump selection). As illustrated, the
selection  criteria  include  pump  displacement,  pressure  capability,  geometric  design,  elastomer
type, and rotor coating characteristics.

Pump Displacement and Pressure Capability.  When  selecting  a  PC  pump,  the  two  most
critical requirements are adequate displacement capacity and pressure capability to ensure that
the pump can deliver the required fluid rate and net lift for the intended application.

It is typical to select pumps with a design (i.e., theoretical) flow rate that is somewhat high-
er  than  the  expected  fluid  rate  to  reflect  pump  inefficiencies  during  production  operations.
Fluid slippage, inflow problems, and gas interference all contribute to reduced pump volumet-
ric efficiency. Together, the design fluid rate and prescribed pump rotational speed define the
minimum required pump displacement as

smin =

qa
ωE

, ............................................................... (15.4)

where smin = minimum required pump displacement (m3/d/rpm [B/D/rpm]), qa = required fluid
rate (m3/d [B/D]), ω = pump rotational speed (rpm), and E = volumetric pumping efficiency in
service.

Initially, an optimal pump speed should be assumed on the basis of the intended application
conditions, with the primary considerations being the viscosity of the produced fluids and tubing-
wear potential. Table 15.4 lists typical pump speeds recommended for the production of fluids

IV-788

in different viscosity ranges. Higher speeds may be considered if these suggested values do not
deliver  the  required  production  rates  or  if  a  pump  with  the  preferred  displacement  cannot  be
sourced.  In  most  cases,  it  is  preferable  to  pump  at  the  lowest  speed  practical  to  increase  the
life of the pump, rod string, tubing, and surface equipment. However, consideration should also
be given to the impact that the selection of larger-displacement pumps will have on the sizing
of the rod string and surface drive.

In general, there has been a trend recently toward higher speeds because new pump models
and  better  sizing  practices  have  been  developed  that  have  led  to  improved  pump  lives.  For
example,  pump  speeds  of  300  to  400  rpm  remain  typical  for  high-water-cut  applications,  but
some operators now routinely pump at 500 rpm and higher in such applications. Higher speeds
may also be practical in some high-viscosity applications in which sand production and tubing-
wear  problems  are  not  an  issue  and  reasonable  pump  efficiencies  can  be  maintained.  For
example, the new large-capacity PC pumps used to produce the prolific heavy oil wells in sev-
eral eastern Venezuela fields are being run successfully at speeds of 400 to 500 rpm.

The net pump lift requirement determines the minimum required pressure capability of the
pump.  In  determining  the  net  lift  value  for  pump  selection,  the  full  service  life  conditions
should be considered. Net lift is defined as the difference between discharge and intake pres-
sures of the PC pump under the expected operating conditions and is estimated as follows:

plift = pd – pi, ............................................................. (15.5)

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-789

where plift = net lift required (kPa [psi]), pd = pump discharge pressure (kPa [psi]), and pi   =
pump intake pressure (kPa [psi]).

Pump intake pressure is normally a function of the casing-head pressure plus the pressure
caused by the gas and liquid column above the pump intake in the casing/tubing annulus. How-
ever,  in  systems  in  which  tail  joints  or  gas  separators  are  used,  the  pressure  drop  that  results
from flow through these components must also be subtracted from the intake pressure. An esti-
mate of the pump intake pressure can be calculated as follows:

pi = pch + pg + pL – ptail, ................................................... (15.6)

where pi = pump intake pressure (kPa [psi]), pch = casing-head pressure (kPa [psi]), pg = annu-
lar gas-column pressure (kPa [psi]), pL = annular liquid-column pressure (kPa [psi]), and ptail =
pressure loss associated with auxiliary components (kPa [psi]).

The pump discharge pressure can be calculated as the sum of the tubing head pressure, the
liquid column pressure in the production tubing and the flow losses that occur in the tubing as
follows:

pd = pth + pL + plosses, ...................................................... (15.7)

where  pth  =  tubing-head  pressure  (kPa  [psi])  pL  =  tubing  liquid-column  pressure  (kPa  [psi]),
and plosses = tubing flow losses (kPa [psi]).

For most existing applications, an accurate estimate of the tubing-head pressure will be avail-
able  from  previous  measurements,  but  some  additional  calculations  may  be  required  to  estab-
lish an appropriate value for the surface piping and related facilities in new installations. When
the producing wells flow directly to a central gathering facility, consideration needs to be given
to  the  fact  that  production  from  individual  wells  may  be  diverted  to  a  test  separator  system
that, in some cases, may impose above-normal backpressures on the pumping system.

Although  the  determination  of  static  liquid-  and  gas-column  pressures  is  routine,  accurate
calculation of flow losses and fluid densities can be much more difficult, especially in multi-
phase flow situations. As such, the use of analytical or empirical models is often necessary to
determine these values.

Once the minimum pump displacement and net lift requirements are established, these val-
ues can be used to determine the range of pump models that will satisfy the requirements of a
particular application. The main sources for obtaining pump specification information are prod-
uct brochures and Websites of the various PC pump manufacturers and distributors, as well as
design  program  databases.  As  noted,  if  there  are  no  pumps  that  satisfy  a  particular  set  of  re-
quirements, then the system design or operating conditions must be changed. The relative cost
and  availability  of  particular  pump  models  should  also  be  taken  into  consideration  during  the
pump selection process.

Torque Requirements.  Rotation of the rotor within the stator forces fluid to move up the
pump  from  cavity  to  cavity.  A  series  of  dynamic  interference  seals  separate  the  cavities  and
provide  a  differential  pressure  capacity.  The  energy  required  to  turn  the  rotor  and  move  the
fluid against this pressure gradient is provided in the form of torque. Pump torque is composed
of hydraulic, viscous, and friction components. Hydraulic torque, the component used to over-
come  differential  pressure,  is  directly  proportional  to  pump  displacement  and  differential
pressure and can be calculated from

Th = C s plift, ............................................................. (15.8)

IV-790

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 15.20—Variation in hydraulic torque with pump displacement and differential pressure.

where  Th  =  hydraulic  pump  torque  (N·m  [ft·lbf]),  s  =  pump  displacement  (m3/d/rpm
[B/D/rpm]), plift = differential pump pressure (kPa [psi]), and C = constant (0.111 [8.97 × 10–2]).
Fig. 15.20 shows the variation in hydraulic torque as a function of differential pressure for

a number of different pump displacement values.

“Friction torque” must be applied to overcome the mechanical friction associated with the
interaction  between  the  rotor  and  stator.  The  magnitude  of  the  friction  torque  depends  on  the
interference fit of the rotor and stator, the type of rotor coating and stator elastomer, the lubri-
cating  properties  of  the  fluid,  and  the  pump  length.  Because  friction  torque  reduces  the
mechanical efficiency of a PC pump, use of rotor/stator pairs with excessive values should be
avoided. Understanding the magnitude of the friction torque in a downhole application can be
difficult  because  the  torque  value  can  only  be  established  empirically  from  bench  test  results
(see the Pump Sizing Practices section).

In wells producing highly viscous oil, PC pumps require some magnitude of additional in-
put  torque  to  overcome  flow  losses  that  occur  within  the  pump  itself.  The  magnitude  of  this
torque  requirement  depends  on  the  fluid  properties  (viscosity  vs.  shear  rate),  pump  geometry,
pump  speed,  and  fluid  rate.  The  additional  torque  requirements  are  typically  quite  small  (i.e.,
can be ignored) in most low-rate wells (e.g., < 20 m3/d) but can be quite significant in heavy
oil wells producing at high rates (e.g., > 150 m3/d). Unfortunately, little published information
is available at this time to provide guidance or models to estimate these loads accurately. How-
ever,  some  proprietary  empirical  determinations  have  been  made  with  data  from  several
instrumented, high-rate, heavy oil wells in Venezuela and full-scale pump tests conducted with
viscous oils.32

The total pump torque is thus equal to

Tt = Th +T f +Tv, ........................................................... (15.9)

In  the  pump  selection  process,  it  is  essential  to  make  a  proper  allowance  for  the  torque
requirements  associated  with  pump  friction  and  viscous  pump  torque  (i.e.,  especially  in  the
case  of  highly  viscous  fluids)  to  ensure  that  the  power  limitations  and  load  capacities  of  the
surface-drive  system  and  rod  string  are  not  exceeded.  In  some  cases,  the  available  torque  or
power may affect pump selection by limiting the maximum pump displacement. Also, note that
the friction torque at startup can be considerably higher than the nominal operating torque due
to  swell  or  compression  set  of  the  stator  elastomer  or  settling  of  produced  sand  above  the
pump after a shutdown.

Pump Geometric Design.  In most cases, several different pumps will satisfy the minimum
fluid rate and lift requirements. However, depending on the application, some pumps will like-
ly  be  more  suitable  than  others.  As  discussed,  pumps  with  similar  displacements  can  differ
significantly in terms of design. These geometric variations cause pumps to perform differently
under certain conditions. When selecting a specific pump, it is important to evaluate the nature
of the application, the geometric design of the pump, and the compatibility between the perfor-
mance characteristics inherent to the pump design and the anticipated operating conditions.

The  first  consideration  is  whether  the  casing  size  will  impose  a  restriction  on  the  pump
diameter. Pump diameters currently range between 48 and 170 mm [1.89 and 6.75 in.], typical-
ly  increasing  with  pump  displacement,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  15.7.  Most  vendors  have  pumps
available  in  both  standard  diameters  and  slimhole  configurations;  i.e.,  the  stator  housing  of
many pump models can be machined down to facilitate use in smaller casing sizes. Reasonable
clearances (e.g., > 6 mm [0.25 in.] diametrical clearance on casing drift) should be maintained
to limit the annular fluid flow velocities to facilitate annular gas separation and to help prevent
sand bridging. In the pump selection process, once the maximum allowable stator diameter has
been determined, pumps that do not satisfy this requirement can be eliminated. Note also that
the rotor major diameter for the selected pump model must be less than the drift diameter of
the production tubing string.

For  applications  producing  significant  quantities  of  sand  (i.e.,  >  2%  sand  by  volume),  the
respective capabilities of different PC pump models to effectively transport the sand becomes
an important selection criterion (see also High-Sand-Cut Wells). The sand-handling capabilities
of a PC pump are strongly influenced by its geometric design, with shorter-pitch-length, wider-
cavity pumps generally offering better performance than pumps with long, narrow cavities.

In  applications  producing  high-viscosity  fluids,  pump  inflow  should  be  considered  in  the
pump  selection  process.  The  rate  at  which  fluids  can  flow  into  and  along  the  narrow  pump
cavities is limited. The inflow rate declines with increasing fluid viscosity (because of viscous
restrictions) and decreasing pump intake pressure (because of reduced driving force). Some ven-
dors refer to a minimum net positive suction head. If the pumping rate exceeds the inflow rate,
incomplete cavity filling occurs, resulting in a pressure drop at the pump inlet, possible cavita-
tion, and reduced pump efficiency (see also High-Viscosity Oil Wells).

Suppliers should be consulted for assistance when choosing between different pump models

to contend with sand or highly viscous fluid production.

Pump Elastomer Type and Rotor Coating.  In many cases, the most important pump selec-
tion consideration is fluid compatibility. Even if the optimal pump geometry has been selected,
reasonable pump service life can be achieved only if the stator elastomer is properly matched
to the produced fluid conditions. Refer to the Elastomer Types, Properties, and Selection sec-
tion for guidance on elastomer selection criteria.

Fluid properties should also be considered when it comes to rotor selection. In most cases,
the standard chrome-plated rotor is the most suitable. However, if pumping corrosive or acidic
fluids, a stainless steel rotor will be less susceptible to corrosion damage. Because the rotor is
often  the  first  component  to  wear  when  pumping  abrasive  solids,33,34  the  use  of  better  wear-

IV-792

resistant coating materials should be considered. Most pump suppliers offer rotors with special
coatings for improved wear resistance.

15.2.3 Pump Sizing Practices.  To contend with the wide range of application conditions, PC
pump  manufacturers  typically  fabricate  rotors  in  a  range  of  minor  diameters  for  each  pump
model. The different rotor sizes are often categorized by standard (i.e., nominal), single or dou-
ble  oversized  or  undersized  designations  or  by  different  temperature  ratings.  The  minor  rotor
diameter typically changes by 0.25 mm [0.010 in.] per size increment. This allows individual
pump models to be provided with various degrees of interference fit between the rotor and the
stator. The task of selecting a “fit” that will result in optimal pump functionality under down-
hole conditions is often referred to as “pump sizing.”

Through  experience,  operators  and  pump  suppliers  have  developed  sizing  guidelines  for
many different field applications. These applications are usually classified in terms of fluid vis-
cosity, temperature, and fluid composition (i.e., sand and water cut, aromatic and H2S content)
at  downhole  conditions.  Sizing  guidelines  take  into  account  anticipated  elastomer  expansion
and swell, clearances for abrasives, fluid slippage rates, and volumetric efficiency. For a given
application,  there  is  generally  a  relatively  narrow  range  of  acceptable  volumetric  efficiencies
for the pump at rated pressure, as measured on a test bench under certain standard conditions.
In some cases, the sizing guidelines may also contain limitations on maximum allowable fric-
tion torque.

When a new pump is sized, an initial pump bench test is completed with a particular rotor
and stator. Depending on the results of this test, it may be necessary to conduct additional tests
with different rotor sizes until a rotor/stator combination is found that meets the predetermined
sizing criteria. It is essential to bench test a PC pump to establish its performance characteris-
tics  quantitatively  given  the  numerous  design,  material,  and  fabrication  parameters  that  can
affect  the  results.  The  following  section  describes  bench  testing  equipment,  practices,  and  re-
sults in further detail.

Pump Testing Procedures.  In a typical PC pump test, the pump is installed horizontally on
a test bench (Fig. 15.21). Rotation and power are provided to the rotor through either a direct
or  hydraulic  drive  system.  Fluid  is  pumped  through  a  closed-loop  system  consisting  of  the
pump,  discharge  lines,  fluid  reservoir,  filtering  system,  and  intake  lines.  In  almost  all  cases,
water with a small amount of oil added for lubrication is used as the test fluid. A choke on the
discharge line is used to regulate the pump differential pressure. The test process normally con-
sists of varying the discharge pressure while operating the pump at a constant speed. Various
test parameters are monitored and recorded. The discharge pressure is usually set at zero at the
start of the test and is then sequentially increased to the maximum test pressure that, in most
cases, matches or exceeds the rated pressure of the pump. Depending on the manufacturer, this
procedure  is  repeated  at  up  to  four  different  speeds.  Some  manufacturers  also  determine  the
maximum pressure that a pump can withstand. This is done by completely restricting the pump
discharge and measuring the pressure under that condition.

Pump  test  reports  usually  contain  such  information  as  test  speeds,  pump  discharge  pres-
sures, temperatures, actual fluid rates, volumetric efficiencies, hydraulic pressures, and torques.
These reports should also include information on the pump components, including model num-
ber, unique rotor and stator serial numbers, dimensions, elastomer type, and threaded connec-
tions.  In  terms  of  the  data  reported  for  a  pump  test,  the  only  parameters  actually  measured
during the test are speed, discharge pressure, temperature, fluid rate, and torque. Speed is direct-
ly measured with any one of several mechanical, magnetic, or optical techniques, all of which
generally  provide  quite  accurate  measurements.  Discharge  pressure  is  monitored  with  either  a
pressure gauge or pressure transducer. Depending on the type of instrument, the accuracy and
resolution  of  the  pressure  measurements  can  vary  substantially.  Several  different  methods  are
commonly used to measure fluid rates. These include measuring the time required to fill a spe-

cific  volume  in  a  tank,  use  of  a  flowmeter  or  measuring  mass  changes  in  the  discharge
reservoir with time. Except for properly sized flowmeters, the reliability of measurements made
with  these  techniques  increases  with  sample  size  (volume  or  mass).  Pump  torques  are  deter-
mined  either  directly  with  the  use  of  a  load  cell  installed  on  the  drive  rod  or  indirectly  by
monitoring hydraulic pressure in a hydraulic drive system or by monitoring prime-mover cur-
rent in an electric drive system. In general, the further removed the measurement point is from
the  pump  rotor,  the  more  the  torque  values  will  be  influenced  by  frictional  losses  within  the
drive equipment.

In addition to differences in test equipment, there are currently no accepted industry stan-
dards  for  conducting  bench  tests,  so  test  procedures  differ  among  pump  suppliers.  This  is
particularly true for fluid additives and the lubrication of pump specimens. Although all suppli-
ers typically use water for the test fluid, various amounts of oil are usually added to the water
or applied directly to the pump rotor to provide lubrication. Differences in the type and quanti-
ty of oil in the test fluid can result in a large variation in fluid lubricity, which strongly affects
the mechanical friction of the pump and thus the measured torque values.

Fluid temperature is also an important parameter that can have a large impact on the results
of  a  pump  test.  Some  manufacturers  use  temperature  control  systems  to  ensure  that  the  test
fluid  temperature  remains  relatively  close  to  the  specified  value  throughout  a  pump  test.  The
target fluid temperatures typically range between 15 and 50°C [59 and 122°F] among vendors.
In  other  cases,  no  temperature  control  is  used,  and  the  test  fluid  is  subject  to  temperature
changes during individual tests (due to heat produced by the pump) or from one test to anoth-
er, depending on the test setup and conditions (i.e., ambient temperature, duration, and frequen-
cy  of  tests).  Whether  regulated  or  not,  a  rise  in  temperature  will  generally  cause  the  stator
elastomer to expand, which can change the rotor/stator fit and pump performance. The duration
of a pump test also varies between suppliers, depending on the equipment and procedures used,
which also can lead to different test results.

In most pump test reports, the speed, pressure, fluid rate, and torque data are presented in a
format similar to that shown in Fig. 15.22. Depending on the particular test, there may be data

for more than one speed, or the test results may encompass a different pressure range. Never-
theless,  the  volumetric  efficiency  and  torque-vs.-pressure  curves  contain  the  information  used
to evaluate characteristics of the pump that was tested.

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

Fig. 15.23—Effect of fluid slippage on volumetric pump efficiency.

Volumetric Efficiency.  Volumetric efficiency is calculated as the ratio of the measured flu-
id  rate  to  the  theoretical  fluid  rate  for  the  pump  being  tested.  Theoretical  fluid  rates  are
determined based on the test speed and nominal displacement of the pump. At zero differential
pressure, however, it is expected that a PC pump would operate at a volumetric efficiency of
100%. Invariably, because of manufacturing and sizing differences between pumps of a given
model or variations in the bench test conditions and procedures, the actual efficiency of a PC
pump at zero differential pressure can vary significantly from 100%.

In  general,  volumetric  efficiency  decreases  with  increasing  differential  pressure  (Fig.
15.23). This decrease is caused by fluid slippage, or the leakage of fluid across the rotor/stator
seal line from higher- to lower-pressure cavities. Accordingly, it is evident that higher pressure
differentials  cause  the  slippage  rate  to  increase  further  once  the  pump  efficiency  drops  below
100%.

In addition to being a function of differential pump pressure, volumetric efficiency and slip-
page also depend on the pump pressure capability, fluid viscosity, and interference fit. In Fig.
15.24, efficiency-vs.-pressure curves are shown for four pumps with the same displacement but
different  pressure  ratings.  At  a  particular  pressure  differential,  the  slippage  rates  decrease  and
efficiency values increase as the pressure capability of the pump increases. This trend can be
attributed  to  the  higher  number  of  cavities  and  seal  lines  in  the  pumps  with  higher  pressure
ratings.  For  the  same  total  differential  pressure,  the  pumps  with  more  cavities  have  a  lower
differential pressure across each cavity; as a result, they experience lower slippage rates.

Higher fluid viscosities may also contribute to decreased slippage rates and increased volu-
metric efficiencies. Although fluid viscosity variation is not typically an issue in pump testing
because  bench  tests  are  usually  conducted  with  water,  it  is  an  important  consideration  in  the
sizing of new pumps or in evaluating the potential reuse of used pumps in different heavy-oil
applications.

At  a  given  differential  pump  pressure,  the  slippage  rate  and  volumetric  efficiency  depend
primarily  on  the  “interference  fit”  between  the  rotor  and  stator.  The  tighter  the  fit,  the  more
difficult it is for fluid to leak across the seal lines and hence the lower the slippage rate and
the  higher  the  pump  efficiency.  These  effects  are  illustrated  in  the  pump  test  results  in  Fig.
15.25 for three similar pumps with loose (undersized), normal, and tight (oversized) fits.

Fig. 15.25—Example of the effect of rotor/stator fit on pump volumetric efficiency.

Pump speed variations have a large effect on volumetric efficiency but generally are consid-
ered to have little effect on slippage rates. Fig. 15.26 shows efficiency-vs.-pressure data for a
single pump tested at three different speeds. The notable improvement in pump efficiency with
increased speed can be attributed to the fact that the fluid rate increases in direct proportion to
speed, while slippage rates tend to vary predominantly as a function of pressure (see slippage
rate curves in Fig. 15.26).

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-797

Fig. 15.26—Example of the effect of pump test speed on volumetric efficiency.

Under specific test conditions (speed, fluid, and temperature), bench test results provide the
best indicator of the interference fit of a pump. However, when quantifying pump performance,
most suppliers specify only the volumetric efficiency of a pump at its rated pressure and one
speed. Although this parameter is commonly used for pump sizing and reuse criteria, the previ-
ous discussions illustrate the importance of paying close attention to other test parameters (e.g.,
test fluid temperature and test speed) that may have influenced the bench test results. This is
especially important when pump sizing practices of different suppliers are compared.

Pump  Torque.    The  torque  values  measured  during  pump  tests  can  be  used  to  diagnose
certain  pump  characteristics.  As  discussed  previously,  pump  torque  consists  of  a  combination
of hydraulic, friction, and viscous components (viscous pump torque will be negligible for tests
conducted with water). Hydraulic torque can be estimated accurately from pump displacement
and  differential  pressure.  Therefore,  friction  torque  can  be  estimated  by  subtracting  hydraulic
torque  from  the  measured pump  torque.  For  example, Fig. 15.27  shows  this  breakdown  for  a
typical pump test. In general, for a particular pump, friction torque remains relatively constant
with changes in both differential pressure and speed.

Friction  torque  can  vary  substantially  between  different  pumps  and  with  variations  in  the
factors  that  contribute  to  pump  friction.  Tighter  rotor/stator  fits  are  usually  accompanied  by
larger elastomer displacements (and hence increased hysteretic heating) and higher energy loss-
es,  which  lead  to  a  corresponding  increase  in  pump  friction.  Poor  meshing  or  alignment
between  the  rotor  and  stator  also  leads  to  increased  friction  torque.  This  “meshing”  between
the  rotor  and  stator  is  closely  related  to  the  quality  control  on  pitch  specifications  imposed
during  the  manufacturing  process.  Material  properties,  surface  finish,  and  test  fluid  lubricity
control  the  magnitude  of  the  friction  developed  because  of  the  rolling/sliding  surface  interac-
tion  between  the  rotor  and  stator.  The  size  and  shape  of  the  rotor  and  stator  (i.e.,  the  pump
model  design  and  fit)  influence  the  seal  surface  geometry  and  have  a  direct  influence  on  the
friction  torque  values.  Pump  friction  tends  to  increase  as  the  number  and  length  of  the  seal

IV-798

lines are increased. As a result, multilobe and higher-pressure-rated pumps tend to have higher
friction torque magnitudes.

The  input  energy  consumed  by  pump  friction  is  largely  converted  into  heat  within  the
pump. Excessive heat generated as a result of pump friction and elastomer hysteresis can lead
to thermal expansion and cracking of the rotor coating and to progressive damage to the stator
elastomer.

It  is  important  to  recognize  the  friction  torque  values  from  pump  test  reports  for  a  given
pump model tend to correspond closely to the rotor/stator fit; therefore, they tend to be low for
loose-fit  pumps  and  quite  high  for  normal-fit  pumps.  However,  what  matters  in  a  system  de-
sign is the friction torque that develops under the downhole operating conditions. Most pumps
sized  loosely  on  the  basis  of  bench  results  will  either  swell  up  because  of  the  fluid  environ-
ment or expand because of increased temperature downhole, so their friction torque values will
increase  substantially  relative  to  the  bench  test.  In  general,  the  friction  torque  of  a  properly
fitted pump will range from 30 to 40% of its hydraulic torque at rated lift for smaller models
(e.g., < 0.3 m3/d/rpm) to as low as 10 to 15% for the larger models (e.g., > 0.8 m3/d/rpm). If
the geometric tolerances of a rotor/stator pair match poorly or the interference is overly tight,
then the friction torque values can become much higher and may exceed the hydraulic torque.

15.2.4 Fluid Flow Considerations.  In a PCP system, produced fluid flows from the pump to
surface through the annular area between the rod string and tubing. High fluid viscosities, ele-
vated  flow  rates,  or  restricted  flow  paths  can  result  in  large  shear  stresses  developing  in  the
fluid,  which  cause  large  frictional  forces  to  act  on  the  rod  string.  These  effects  can  have  the
following implications on system loading:

• Fluid shear stresses produce flow losses along the tubing and across couplings, centraliz-

ers, and rod guides that contribute to increased pump pressure loading.

• Rotational frictional forces acting on the surfaces of the sucker rods, couplings, centraliz-

ers, and rod guides produce resistive rod string torque.

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-799

Fig. 15.28—Variation in pressure losses through tubing with viscosity and flow rate.

• Axial  frictional  forces  acting  on  the  rod-string  body,  couplings,  centralizers,  and  rod
guides  and  flow  losses  across  couplings,  centralizers,  and  rod  guides  produce  upward  forces
that reduce rod-string tension.

Fluid-flow effects can range from having a minor to a dominant influence on PCP system
design. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.28, which shows pressure losses for a range of flow rates
and  viscosities  through  a  100  m  [328  ft]  length  of  76  mm  [3.0  in.]  ID  tubing  (typical  of  89
mm  [3.5  in.]  tubing)  without  sucker  rods  present.  Note  that  the  pressure-drop  values  range
from  nearly  zero  to  values  that  exceed  the  corresponding  hydrostatic  pressure.  The  change  in
slope  in  the  curve  of  pressure  loss  vs.  viscosity  is  a  result  of  the  transition  from  laminar  to
turbulent flow.

Unfortunately, depending on conditions, accurately quantifying fluid-flow effects can be ex-
tremely  challenging.  Difficulties  arise  when  the  calculations  involve  non-Newtonian  fluid
behavior, multiphase flow, or complicated flow patterns around couplings and rod guides. De-
signers  typically  resort  to  an  appropriate  computer  model  to  perform  these  calculations.  It  is
beyond  the  scope  of  this  chapter  to  describe  in  detail  the  methods  or  formulations  typically
used  to  quantify  the  fluid-flow  parameters  (e.g.,  pressure-loss  profile  along  tubing,  fluid-col-
umn  density  profile)  used  in  the  design  of  a  PCP  system.  However,  the  following  sections
briefly overview the general approach used and outline some special considerations required in
these assessments.

Single-Phase Flow.  When single-phase flow effects are assessed, the first step is to estab-
lish the type of flow regime. Normally, single-phase flow conditions can be classified as either
laminar  or  turbulent.  Laminar  flow  is  smooth  and  steady  and  governed  primarily  by  viscous
forces  (viscosity,  velocity).  Turbulent  flow  is  fluctuating  and  agitated  and  depends  mostly  on
inertial  forces  (density,  velocity).  The  type  of  flow  regime  is  determined  by  calculating  the
Reynolds number for the flow conditions in question.35 Usually, the transition Reynolds num-
ber for annular pipe flow is assumed to be 2,100 for Newtonian fluids. Flow conditions with

IV-800

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Reynolds  numbers  <  2,100  are  considered  laminar;  conditions  that  have  numbers  >  2,100  are
considered turbulent. The Reynolds number decreases as fluid viscosity increases or flow rate
decreases. Thus, flow tends to be laminar in most heavy-oil applications.

Once  the  flow  regime  has  been  determined,  appropriate  annular  pipe  flow  equations  are
used  to  evaluate  the  flow  (pressure)  losses  within  a  surface-driven  PCP  system.  These  equa-
tions take into consideration the fluid properties, flow rate, and respective rod-string and tubing
dimensions. In the case of standard rod strings, the reduced annular space associated with cou-
plings,  centralizers,  and  rod  guides  can  lead  to  significant  additional  pressure  losses,  which
should also be taken into consideration. In addition, the common flow-loss equations are typi-
cally based on a Newtonian fluid model in which the applied shear stress is proportional to the
shear strain rate and the viscosity is the constant of proportionality (shear stress = viscosity ×
shear rate). However, most high-viscosity petroleum fluids (> 100 cp [100 mPa·s]) tend to be
non-Newtonian, exhibiting pseudoplastic (shear thinning) behavior, which implies that the fluid
effective viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate.36,37 Fluid viscosities typically are strong-
ly  influenced  by  temperature  and  variations  in  fluid  composition  (water  cut,  solution  gas
content). Therefore, it is very important to obtain representative fluid-property information for
the  application  in  question  and  to  pay  attention  to  the  temperature  and  shear  rates  associated
with fluid viscosity tests.

Most annular flow correlations assume that the flow is through two concentric pipes.35 In a
rod-string  and  tubing  system,  however,  wellbore  curvature  and  gravity  will  position  the  rod
string against one side of the tubing in most situations. As a result, the flow pattern that devel-
ops may deviate from the concentric case. The effect of offsetting the rod string is to create a
larger, unrestricted area for flow, thus reducing the magnitude of the fluid shear rates and pres-
sure  losses.38  The  magnitude  of  this  reduction  depends  on  the  amount  that  the  rod  string  is
offset  from  center  (i.e.,  eccentricity)  and  the  relative  diameters  of  the  tubing,  rods,  and  cou-
plings.  Conservative  reductions  for  laminar  flow  are  40%  for  coupling,  centralizer,  and  rod-
guide losses and 25% for rod-body losses. For turbulent flow, reductions of 10% for coupling,
centralizer, and rod-guide losses and 5% for rod-body losses are reasonable.

The  significance  that  flow  losses  have  on  system  design  depends  on  the  application.  In
many instances, such as wells producing light oil or high-water-cut fluids at moderate rates, the
flow  losses  are  generally  small,  so  they  often  are  neglected  in  system  design.  However,  in
wells  producing  high-viscosity  fluids,  excessive  flow  losses  may  occur  with  certain  rod-string
and tubing combinations (i.e., large rods in small-diameter tubing). In such cases, flow losses
are an extremely important consideration in system design that must be addressed through ap-
propriate  sizing  of  the  rod-string  and  tubing  components.  For  example,  consider  flow  of  a
2,500 cp [2500 mPa·s] fluid through a 760 m [2,493 ft] length of tubing with 25.4 mm [1 in.]
rods and slimhole standard couplings. The corresponding flow losses are shown as a function
of flow rate in Fig. 15.29 for 73 mm [2.875 in.] tubing (Case 1) and 88.9 mm [3.5 in.] tubing
(Case  2).  These  flow  losses  have  been  “corrected”  to  account  for  non-concentric  flow.  The
results  show  that  excessive  flow  losses  would  render  it  impractical  to  use  73  mm  [2.875  in.]
tubing unless operating at very low flow rates (i.e., < 20 m3/d [126 B/D]). In contrast, use of
88.9 mm [3.5 in.] tubing leads to much lower flow losses because of the increased flow area.
Fig. 15.29 also illustrates the effect that flow restrictions have on the magnitude of flow losses.
With the 73 mm [2.875 in.] tubing, flow losses associated with the couplings comprised approx-
imately 25% of the total losses even though the coupling flow length was a very small portion
of the total rod length (10 of 760 m [33.3 of 2,493 ft]).

Multiphase Flow.  Multiphase flow can be defined as the simultaneous flow of two or more
phases of fluid, normally liquid and gas. In an oil well producing gas-saturated liquids, when
the  pressure  drops  below  the  bubblepoint,  gas  will  evolve,  resulting  in  multiphase  gas/liquid
flow. As this gas/liquid mixture flows through the production system, the two phases may com-

mingle in a variety of flow patterns.39 The particular pattern or “flow regime” that occurs has a
significant effect on multiphase-flow behavior and pressure loss.40 Flow-regime maps facilitate
the  determination  of  flow  patterns  from  gas  and  liquid  flow  rates,  fluid  properties,  and  well-
bore inclinations. Fluid properties are usually obtained from empirical correlations. Depending
on  the  particular  flow  regime,  different  multiphase-flow  algorithms  are  used  to  calculate  the
hydrostatic and frictional pressure gradients. The hydrostatic gradient is determined from both
gas and liquid densities and takes into account the different velocities of the different phases.
The  frictional  gradient  is  calculated  from  friction  factors  based  on  two-phase  fluid  properties.
Fig. 15.30 illustrates the procedure used for multiphase-flow calculations, which generally are
too complex to perform manually.

Most  common  empirical  correlations  for  fluid  properties  have  been  developed  for  lighter
oils,41  and  they  may  not  apply  to  heavier crudes.  In  general, caution must  be  exercised when
these  empirical  correlations  are  extrapolated  out  of  the  range  for  which  they  were  developed.
In addition, correlations developed for heavy oils from a particular field can differ considerably
for heavy oils of the same API gravity in another region.

15.2.5 Rod Loading.  In a PCP system, the rod string must be capable of carrying axial load
and  transmitting  torque  between  the  bottomhole  pump  and  the  surface  drive.  Therefore,  rod-
string design encompasses an evaluation of the axial tension and torque loading conditions for
the full range of anticipated operating conditions. An appropriate size and grade of rod string
can then be selected on the basis of appropriate design criteria, such as ensuring that the maxi-
mum calculated combined stress does not exceed the yield capacity or manufacturer’s recom-
mended values. Fatigue-loading considerations must also be addressed in certain applications.

Axial Load and Torque.  The  axial  load  and  torque  at  any  location  along  a  rod  string  is
made up  of  several different components (Fig. 15.31).  Several major load  components (pump
hydraulic torque and pump axial load) are applied to the rod string at the pump; others (resis-
tive torque and rod weight) are developed in a distributed manner along the length of the rod

string. In almost all cases, the rod-string axial load and torque are maximum at the polished-
rod connection at surface. Rod-string axial load at any location is equal to

Fr = Fp +∑Fw –∑Fu, ..................................................... (15.10)

where Fr = rod-string axial load (N [lbf]), Fp = pump pressure load (N [lbf]), ΣFw = sum of rod-
string weight below location (N [lbf]), and ΣFu= sum of uplift forces below location (N [lbf]).
Rod-string weight is a function of the unit weight and vertical length of the rod string. The
uplift  forces  result  from  fluid  flow  effects,  as  discussed  previously.  The  pump  pressure  load
results  from  the  differential  pressure  across  the  pump  acting  on  the  pump  rotor  and  is  analo-
gous to the plunger load in a beam pump. There has been some controversy over how this load
develops on the rotor, and several different formulations have been published. One correlation
that provides a reasonable approximation of the pump pressure load is as follows42:

Fp = C (pd – pi) × 0.6 × (2d2 + 13ed + 16e2) – pddr

where Fp = pump pressure load (N [lbf]), pd = pump discharge pressure (kPa [psi]), pi = pump
intake pressure (kPa [psi]), d = nominal rotor diameter (mm [in.]), e = pump eccentricity (mm
[in.]), dr = rod-string diameter (mm [in.]), and C = constant (7.9 × 10–4 [0.79]).

At any rod-string location, the torque is equal to

Tr = Th +T f +∑TR +Tv, .................................................... (15.12)

where  Tr  =  rod-string  torque  (N·m  [ft·lbf]),  Th  =  pump  hydraulic  torque  (N·m  [ft·lbf]),  Tf  =
pump friction torque (N·m [ft·lbf]), Tv = viscous pump torque (N·m [ft·lbf]), and ΣTR = sum of
rod-string resistive torque below location (N·m [ft·lbf]).

The  pump  torque  components  were  discussed  above.  Resistive  torque  is  usually  smaller

than the other two components but should be considered in high-fluid-viscosity applications.43

Rod-string axial loads increase with increases in well depth, rod-string diameter, and pump
displacement.  In  applications  with  high  fluid  viscosities,  changes  in  axial  load  with  flow  rate
depend  on  the  offsetting  effects  of  the  flow  losses  and  rod-string  uplift  forces.  Rod-string
torque  increases  with  increases  in  pump  differential  pressure,  pump  displacement,  and  pump
friction.  In  applications  with  high  fluid  viscosities,  torque  will  increase  with  both  flow  rate
(because of higher flow losses that increase the pump discharge pressure) and rotational speed
(because of an increase in resistive torque).

Combined Stress.  The combined loading of a rod string (i.e., rod body) as a result of axial

load and torque can be represented by the effective (Von Mises) stress calculated as follows:

where  σe  =  effective  stress  (MPa  [ksi]),  Fr  =  rod-string  axial  load  (N  [lbf]),  Tr  =  rod-string
torque (N·m [ft·lbf]), dr = rod-string diameter (mm [in.]), C1 = constant (16.0 or [1.6 × 10–5]),
and C2 = constant (7.680 × 108 or [0.1106]).

Because  the  connections  (couplings)  used  in  standard  rods  are  usually  designed  to  have
greater strength than the rod body, only the effective stresses of the rods typically need to be
checked. However, proper makeup during installation is essential to ensure that the connections
will function as designed by the manufacturers and provide the specified minimum load capaci-
ty. Some vendors offer sucker rods with reduced connection sizes (e.g., 25.4 mm [1 in.] rods
fabricated with 22.2 mm [⅞ in.] pin connections); connection capacity can be the limiting fac-
tor  in  such  cases.  Fig.  15.32  shows  the  magnitude  of  the  maximum  effective  stress  that
develops in a 25.4 mm [1 in.] rod string for a wide range of axial load and torque conditions.
These  results  clearly  show  that  effective  stress  is  primarily  a  function  of  torque  and  that  the
impact  of  tension  on  the  stress  magnitude  at  lower  torque  values  is  normally  of  little  conse-
quence.  From  these  results,  it  becomes  quite  evident  that  there  is  little  advantage  to  using
tapered rod strings in PCP applications.

In contrast to the inherent cyclic rod stress that occurs in beam pumping, the rod stresses in
PCP applications tend to be relatively constant. As a result, the effective rod stresses may ap-
proach  the  yield  stress  of  the  rod  material  without  causing  failures  in  PCP  applications,
although fatigue induced by bending is an issue in directional and horizontal wells (see below).
The  minimum  yield  stress  for  Grade  D  sucker  rods  is  690  MPa  [100  ksi],  although  several
manufacturers also offer higher-strength grades with yield strengths up to 860 MPa [125 ksi].
For continuous-rod products, the minimum yield stress typically ranges from 586 MPa [85 ksi]
at the low end to 790 MPa [115 ksi] for the higher-strength materials. The most common con-
tinuous-rod size is 25.4 mm [1.0 in.].

In  PCP  system  design,  rod  loading  should  be  evaluated  for  the  full  range  of  anticipated
operating  conditions  to  ensure  that  the  selected  rod  string  will  have  adequate  capacity.  It  is
advisable  to  use  at  least  a  20%  safety  factor  in  rod  sizing.  This  will  allow  for  unanticipated
torque increases that might be brought about by such factors as sand slugs, stator swelling, or
startup friction. In addition, it will provide a margin of safety in the case of rod-strength reduc-
tions caused by rod-body wear or corrosion damage. Note that a 20% decrease in rod diameter
can produce a 100% increase in rod stress and a 50% reduction in the load capacity of the rod.
Rod String Fatigue.  It is well established that mechanical components subjected to alternat-
ing loads are susceptible to metal fatigue, even if the peak stress level in the material is well
below  the  yield  strength.  The  fatigue  life  of  a  component  is  affected  by  the  average  (mean)
stress it experiences, the magnitude of fluctuations in the applied stress, and the frequency of
the  stress  fluctuations.  Load  fluctuations,  coupled  with  a  high  mean  stress,  result  in  a  more
severe fatigue situation than in a load case with fluctuations of a similar magnitude but negligi-

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

ble  mean  stress.  This  is  important  in  the  context  of  PCP  applications,  which  usually  will
involve  a  high  mean  stress  in  the  rod  string.  Most  steels  exhibit  an  endurance  limit,  which
corresponds to the maximum alternating stress that will result in an “infinite” fatigue life (i.e.,
for polished materials without any corrosion). Designing rod strings for alternating stress levels
below the endurance limit is an excellent design criterion.44,45

The operating conditions in many PCP applications expose rod strings to severe load fluctu-
ations.  Variations  in  pump  discharge  pressure  caused  by  gas  in  the  production  tubing  or
increases in pump friction as a result of sand or fluid slugs can cause significant fluctuations in
pump  torque  and  axial  load.  However,  the  use  of  PCP  systems  in  directional  wells  typically
presents a more critical fatigue situation, because the rods are subjected to cyclic bending stress-
es  at  a  frequency  matching  the  rotational  speed  of  the  pump.  Given  the  typical  operating
speeds  of  PCPs,  the  number  of  loading  cycles  can  reach  several  million  in  a  relatively  short
time  (weeks  or  months);  therefore,  fatigue  analyses  should  be  considered  when  these  loading
conditions  are  expected.  In  calculations  of  fatigue  life,  both  the  high  frequency  (i.e.,  bending
effects in deviated wells) and low frequency (e.g., gas slugging effects) should be considered,
given the different impacts they may have on stress levels.

15.2.6 Rod-String/Tubing Wear.  Rod-string and tubing wear is an important consideration in
the design of surface-driven PCP systems for directional, slant, and horizontal wells. The rod-
string  configuration,  magnitude  of  the  contact  loads  that  develop  between  the  rod  string  and
tubing,  produced-fluid  conditions,  and  rotational  speed  of  the  rod  string  all  interact  to  deter-
mine the wear mechanisms that will predominate and the corresponding component wear rates
that will occur in different circumstances. From a design perspective, the goal is to assess the
potential for wear problems and then to select a PCP system configuration that will maximize
the service life of the installation.

For standard rod strings, contact between the rod string and tubing tends to be concentrated
at the couplings or rod guides, although rod-body contact can also develop under certain load-
ing conditions. In contrast, continuous sucker rods tend to contact the tubing uniformly along
the  wellbore.  As  a  result,  the  contact  load  magnitudes  differ  considerably  between  these  two
rod configurations for the same wellbore geometry and rod-tension conditions. Particularly for
standard  rods,  contact  loads  can  be  quite  high  in  moderate-  to  high-curvature  well  segments,
such as the angle-build sections of directional and horizontal wells. Also, well shapes that al-
low the tension/curvature contact loading to act in tandem with the gravity loads acting on the
rod  string  (common  in  slant  wells)  can  be  particularly  prone  to  wear  problems.  Figs.  15.33
and 15.34 present charts that can be used to estimate contact loads for standard and continuous
rod strings, respectively, as a function of the well-curvature and rod-tension conditions.

Field  experience6  has  shown  that  tubing  wear  rates  correlate  most  strongly  with  sand  cut,
followed in decreasing order by contact load, centralizer type, rotational speed, and water cut.
In  general,  tubing  wear  rates  increase  exponentially  with  increasing  sand  cut  (to  a  limit)  and
linearly with increasing contact load. Because of reduced lubrication, wear rates may increase
significantly  in  situations  in  which  the  water  cut  increases  substantially.  Coated  centralizers
exhibit lower wear rates than standard couplings, with the degree of reduction being a function
of  the  coating  material.  Note  that  field  experience  has  shown  some  coating  materials  to  be
prone to the embedding of sand, which resulted in accelerated instead of reduced tubing wear
rates. Spin-thru centralizers eliminate tubing wear very effectively as long as they remain func-
tional.  Because  of  the  much  lower  uniform  contact  loads,  tubing  wear  rates  associated  with
continuous  rod  tend  to  be  substantially  (e.g.,  5  to  20  times)  lower  than  standard  rod  strings
with metal couplings (material hardness and size factors play a role in the reduction). In appli-
cations  using  high-volume  PC  pumps  and  large-diameter  standard  rods,  the  increased  surface

velocity  of  the  couplings  may  contribute  to  a  form  of  hydrodynamic  lubrication  that  tends  to
reduce wear rates relative to the expected rates based on the load conditions involved.

Although failures resulting from rod-string/tubing wear usually occur infrequently in vertical-
well applications, failures are not uncommon within weeks or even days in directional or slant
wells producing sandy fluids. Although there are costs associated with wear prevention (central-
izers,  continuous-rod  or  tubing  rotator  systems),  they  are  often  justified  by  the  increased
workover  and  equipment  replacement  costs  (e.g.,  couplings/centralizer  and  tubing)  that  would
otherwise be incurred in such cases. In many cases, repeated failures occur because of the oper-
ating practices used and the lack of data collected during workovers to characterize the source
and locations of the wear problem properly. Operators must develop an understanding of wear
processes  and  become  familiar  with  the  workover  histories  and  operating  characteristics  of  a
variety  of  wells  that  have  experienced  wear  failures  to  become  effective  at  designing,  equip-
ping, and operating wells to prevent wear failures.

One of the most common locations for severe rod/tubing wear is the first couple of joints
above the pump. In many instances, failures have occurred in this section of the well despite
the  well  curvature  and  rod  tensions  being  higher  at  various  uphole  locations.  The  increased
wear  rates  directly  above  the  pump  can  be  attributed  to  the  eccentric  motion  of  the  rotor,
which may cause the rod string directly above the pump to develop an impacting/rotating inter-
action with the tubing. This interaction results in a more severe wear mechanism. The use of
robust  rod  centralizers as  opposed  to  standard  couplings  is  recommended for  at  least the  first
two or three rod connections above the pump. Ensuring that a full-length standard rod (7.6 m
[25  ft]),  as  opposed  to  a  short  pony  rod,  is  attached  directly  to  the  pump  rotor  is  important.
The pony rod may restrict the required orbital motion of the rotor head, causing damage to the
pump stator or failure of the rotor pin.

15.2.7 Power Transmission Equipment Design.  The various surface-drive system components
will generally have specified maximum load and speed limits. For example, drive-head manu-

Fig. 15.34—Development of rod/tubing contact loads with continuous sucker rod strings.

facturers’ catalogs will typically specify a maximum torque, polished-rod speed, and power as
well  as  give  a  thrust  bearing  rating  for  their  equipment.  Some  may  also  provide  a  maximum
axial  load  value  for  their  drives.  The  maximum  torque  limits  typically  are  set  for  structural
purposes,  whereas  the  power  limits  reflect  the  safe  operating  capacity  of  the  power  transmis-
sion system (belts and sheaves or gear set). There are also torque limits related to the braking
system capacity, and in many cases, only the lower of the two is published. The structural load
capacity  of  a  drive  head  is  typically  specified  from  an  allowable  overhanging  motor  size  or
weight. Motor size specifications are also important with respect to functionality of the frame,
doors,  and  other  components.  Hydraulic  systems  have  maximum  and  minimum  speeds  and  a
maximum hydraulic pressure indicated by the manufacturer.

Note that the maximum axial load specification of a drive head is typically not the same as
the thrust bearing load rating (i.e., the Ca-90 thrust bearing rating is the loading at which 90%
of bearings will survive 90 million revolutions). At a speed of 200 rpm, this number of revolu-
tions equates to only 312 days of life, so the actual axial load on the drive head should be kept
significantly lower than the thrust bearing rating to ensure long service life. It is reasonable to
expect the bearing life to increase by about 10 times if the load is reduced by half.

The  prime  mover  should  be  able  to  provide  sufficient  power  to  the  system  without  being

overloaded. The prime-mover power can be calculated as follows:

P pmo =

CTprω
Ept

, .......................................................... (15.14)

where  Ppmo  =  required  prime-mover  power  output  (kW  [hp]),  Tpr  =  polished-rod  torque  (N·m
[ft·lbf]),  ω  =  polished-rod  rotational  speed  (rpm),  Ept  =  power  transmission  system  efficiency
(%), and C = constant (1.047 × 10–2 [1.904 × 10–2]).

IV-808

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

In calculating the prime mover power requirement, the efficiencies of all the power trans-
mission  equipment  must  be  considered.  Belts,  gears,  bearings,  and  hydraulic  systems  all  have
associated  energy  losses.  When  selecting  an  electric  motor,  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  the
motor will be loaded reasonably close to its rating to facilitate efficient operation. The system
torque capacity should be sufficient to handle the worst-case operating conditions in the appli-
cation, including startup.

Drive-head  manufacturers’  catalogs  list  maximum  and  minimum  sheave  sizes  for  the  two
sheaves required (for drive heads that use sheaves). The maximum sizes are usually determined
by  size  restrictions;  the  minimum  size  of  the  motor  sheave  will  typically  be  based  on  a  belt
curvature limitation and/or torque transfer performance. The sheave sizes and hydraulic equip-
ment displacements will determine the speed at which the system operates, in conjunction with
the  gear  reduction  ratio  in  the  drive  head  (if  the  drive  head  has  a  gearbox).  They  should  be
selected so that the prime mover operates as close as possible to its nameplate speed, even in
systems in which it is possible to adjust the prime-mover speed (e.g., use of an ESC with an
electric motor). When electric motors are operated at lower speeds, they are subject to reduced
efficiency and overheating.

In  most  applications,  a  backspin  brake  is  required  to  ensure  safe  operation  of  a  PCP  sys-
tem. The brake system should have sufficient capacity to ensure that the maximum rated speed
of  the  equipment  is  not  exceeded  during  a  worst-case  backspin  scenario.  Again,  both  stuck
pump and normal shutdown cases should be taken into consideration.

15.3 Specific Application Considerations
Different PCP system applications have unique operational issues and challenges. Appropriate
equipment configurations, installation procedures, sizing standards, and operating practices may
be required, depending on the application characteristics.

This section discusses some specific application considerations, including (1) high-viscosity
oil  wells;  (2)  high-sand-cut  wells;  (3)  low-productivity  wells;  (4)  gassy  wells;  (5)  directional-
and  horizontal-well  applications;  (6)  hostile  fluid  conditions;  (7)  high-speed  operations;  (8)
coalbed-methane and water-source wells; and (9) elevated-temperature applications.

15.3.1 High-Viscosity  Oil  Production.    Over  the  past  decade,  PCP  systems  have  become  a
very popular artificial-lift method for producing heavy oil (API gravity < 18°) wells throughout
the  world.46,47  Fluid  viscosity  under  downhole  conditions  can  range  from  a  few  hundred  cen-
tipoise  to  >  100,000  cp  in  these  applications,  and  the  production  rates  also  vary  significantly
although low rates are far more typical. In Canada, for example, the low-GOR, heavy oil wells
generally have low productivities (< 10 m3/d [63 B/D]), whereas recent heavy oil field develop-
ments in eastern Venezuela using horizontal wells have demonstrated very high productivities
(> 500 m3/d [2,000 B/D]). These latter applications have prompted revolutionary developments
in large-volume PCP systems.

Production of high-viscosity fluids can result in significant flow losses through the produc-
tion tubing and surface piping. In some instances, the pressure requirements generated because
of  flow  losses  can  exceed  the  hydrostatic  head  on  a  well.  As  discussed  previously,  pressure
losses  in  the  system  accumulate  and  are  reacted  at  the  pump,  where  they  cause  additional
pump pressure loading, leading directly to increased rod-string axial loads and system torque. It
is critical that system design account for the “worst-case” flow losses, particularly the selection
of the pump (pressure rating), rod string (torque capacity), and prime mover (power output).

Fig. 15.35 shows a good example of the effects that viscous flow losses and water slugging
can  have  on  pump  loads  in  a  heavy  oil  well.  The  axial  and  torsional  loads  on  the  well  were
monitored  in  real  time  with  a  purpose-built  PCP  system  dynamometer  unit.48  The  data  show
that  the  axial  load  and  torque  values  remained  relatively  constant  at  about  45  kN  and  1100
N·m [10,050 lbf and 800 ft·lbf], respectively, over the first hour of the monitoring period. Over

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

the next 2 hours, both loads declined significantly, with the torque dropping to less than one-
half  the  initial  value.  The  loads  subsequently  increased  again  but  remained  somewhat  below
the  initial  load  levels.  Fluid  samples  taken  regularly  during  the  monitoring  period  confirmed
that the well had gone from initially producing heavy oil at a very low water cut to producing
a large slug of water with relatively little oil during the period. Representative water-cut values
are  shown  at  different  times  in  Fig.  15.35.  Because  the  only  significant  difference  during  the
operating  period  was  the  viscosity  of  the  fluid  being  produced,  these  results  clearly  demon-
strate the pronounced effect that flow losses can have on PCP system loads.

Several alternative methods are available to minimize flow losses. Because most of the pres-
sure drop usually occurs in the production tubing, it is important to ensure that the rod/tubing
annular  flow  area  is  not  overly  constricted.  This  is  most  easily  accomplished  through  the  use
of large-diameter tubing. However, tubing sizing must also take into account casing limitations,
economics, and sand transport considerations that favor small-diameter tubing. Streamlining of
the  rod  string  is  another  effective  way  to  minimize  tubing  flow  restrictions.  Large-diameter
centralizers and/or a number of sucker-rod guides can contribute to significant incremental flow
losses and should be avoided when flow losses are an issue. Continuous rod provides the lowest-
pressure-drop alternative.

Surface piping flow losses should also be considered. Use of small-diameter flowlines and
90° elbows and tees should be avoided. Because of the logarithmic effect that temperature typi-
cally has on viscosity, surface flow losses are usually quite temperature sensitive, so insulated
systems or buried flowlines are a necessity in cold climates. These alternatives should also be
considered  in  hot  climates  to  preserve  heat  and  to  avoid  daily  temperature  variations  in  long
flowlines.

In certain situations, changing the equipment configuration is not an option; other methods
must be implemented to reduce flow losses. This can be accomplished by reducing the viscosi-
ty  of  the  produced  fluid,  typically  by  injecting  diluent  (light  petroleum  products  or  water)
down the annulus (to reduce pressure losses in the tubing) or into the flowline near the well-

IV-810

head (to reduce flowline losses). Note that if viscosity-reducing additives are injected down the
annulus, special caution must be taken to ensure that they will not damage the stator elastomer.
Elastomer selection and pump sizing are important in heavy oil applications to achieve opti-
mal  performance  and  pump  run  lives.  It  is  normally  preferred  to  start  with  medium-NBR
elastomers in these applications because of the superior mechanical properties of these materi-
als. However, in heavy oil applications in which the pumps are prone to swelling (e.g., eastern
Venezuela), consideration should be given to the use of high nitrile elastomers. Several vendors
have recently introduced soft elastomers (i.e., < 65 shore A hardness) for heavy oil service to
facilitate effective sealing while allowing high concentrations of sand to pass through the pump
without  causing  damage. Because slippage rates  decrease and  pump  efficiencies increase with
higher fluid viscosities, PC pumps can typically be sized with bench-test efficiencies of 70 to
80%  at  speeds  of  100  to  150  rpm  (i.e.,  at  rated  pressure  without  consideration  for  swell  or
thermal expansion) without negatively affecting performance. In new applications, optimal siz-
ing  criteria  can  be  determined  only  on  a  trial-and-error  basis  by  varying  pump  sizing  and
subsequently tracking both short-term and long-term performance. There is a tradeoff between
sizing pumps more tightly to permit a larger degree of wear to be tolerated before a significant
loss in efficiency is incurred and relaxing the fit to reduce the elastomer stresses and prevent
elastomer  fatigue  failures.  As  a  result,  it  is  preferable  to  start  by  sizing  pumps  in  the  middle
and adjusting the sizing criteria based on the types of failures that occur.

Production  from  heavy  oil  wells  can  also  be  highly  variable  in  nature.  To  respond  to  the
changing  operating  conditions,  it  is  important  to  have  a  flexible  power  transmission  system.
Hydraulic  systems  are  quite  common  because  they  provide  variable  speed  capability  with  a
high turndown ratio that is often necessary to facilitate the low pump speeds typically required.
Electronic systems (electric motors with speed control systems) can also be effective as long as
they have the ability to operate within the lower speed ranges.

15.3.2 High-Sand-Cut  Wells.    Sand  production  is  frequently  a  byproduct  of  oil  production,
especially in some primary heavy oil operations (e.g., Canada) where it is an important part of
the  recovery  process.  In  such  operations,  sand  influx  is  usually  most  severe  during  the  initial
stage  of  production  when  the  volumetric  sand  cuts  can  exceed  40%.  Subsequently,  the  sand
cuts often stabilize at ≤ 3%. In high-rate applications (e.g., Venezuela), even low sand cuts can
equate  to  significant  volumes  of  produced  sand  over  time.  Sand  and  other  solids  production
can cause problems in PCP systems by accelerating equipment wear, increasing rod torque and
power demand, or causing a flow restriction by accumulating around the pump intake, within
the pump cavities, or above the pump in the tubing. Also, given its specific gravity of ≈ 2.7,
even  moderate  volumes  of  sand  can  substantially  increase  the  pressure  gradient  of  the  fluid
column in the production tubing.

With  proper  system  design  and  operation,  PCP  systems  can  effectively  handle  produced
fluids  with  significant  sand  cuts  under  reasonably  steady-state  conditions.  Severe  operational
problems  (equipment  failures,  shutdowns  requiring  workovers)  generally  develop  due  to  short
periods of rapid sand influx (slugging). Although some slugging occurs naturally, sudden sand
influx can also be initiated by operating practices that cause fairly rapid changes in bottomhole
pressure.  The  pressure  variations  affect  inflow  rates  and  can  disturb  stable  sand  bridges  that
develop  around  perforations,  causing  the  bridges  to  collapse  and  sand  to  flow  into  the  well-
bore.  For  example,  experience  has  shown  that  large  changes  in  pump  speed  can  precipitate
sand  slugging.  Therefore,  large  adjustments  in  pump  speed  should  be  made  gradually  over  a
few  days  to  allow  the  well  time  to  stabilize.  If  possible,  other  practices  that  produce  sudden
variations in bottomhole pressure, such as well loading or casing gas blowdown, should also be
avoided. Workover operations that cause swabbing of a well (e.g., rapid pulling of the produc-
tion  tubing  string  within  the  perforated  interval)  are  often  followed  by  periods  of  high  sand
production. Changes in the produced-fluid conditions can also precipitate sand influx. For exam-

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

ple,  a  sudden  increase  in  water  production  or  a  slug  of  higher-viscosity  fluid  can  lead  to  a
breakdown of stable sand arches, causing a slug of sand to enter the wellbore.

Sand accumulation inside the tubing just above the pump is a common problem. It leads to
increased pump discharge pressures, reduced fluid rates, and in severe cases, increased poten-
tial for sudden pump failure. Sand buildup occurs when the produced-fluid stream cannot carry
all the sand up the tubing to surface. Therefore, it is very important to assess the sand-handling
capabilities  of  a  PCP  system  design  for  applications  in  which  sand  production  is  expected.
Sand settling and fluid transport velocities (in vertical pipes) can be assessed by comparing the
fluid drag forces calculated using well-established methods49 with the weight of the sand parti-
cles or particle conglomerates as appropriate.

Sand buildup in the pump intake area causes decreased production rates and, in severe cas-
es, pump failure due to complete blockage of the intake. One effective way to minimize sand
accumulation around the intake is to provide a sump below the pump where excess sand can
settle. Deeper sumps provide a larger buffer, and therefore it will take longer before sand accu-
mulates  to  the  pump  level.  Certain  pump  intake  designs  also  contribute  to  sanding  problems.
Restricted  intakes  tend  to  produce  stagnant  flow  regions  where  the  sand  will  settle  out.  For
sandy applications, the pump intake should be configured so that fluids can readily flow (i.e.,
limited bends, channels) from the wellbore into the pump intake.

Operational problems associated with sand settlement and bridging, both above and below
the  pump,  occur  most  commonly  in  directional  and  horizontal  wells.  The  ability  of  the  pro-
duced fluid to transport sand improves with increasing fluid viscosity and flow velocity. Initial
system  design  should  consider  whether  the  lowest  anticipated  production  rate  will  be  capable
of moving the sand up the tubing, and allowances should be made for slugs of sand entering
the  system.  Decreasing  the  tubing  size  and  increasing  the  flow  rate  are  the  easiest  ways  to
improve sand transport capability. However, the use of smaller-diameter tubing must be evalu-
ated in terms of its effect on flow losses. Injecting a fluid down the annulus and pumping at
higher rates or introducing fluid into the tubing above the pump (recirculation system) are two
possible ways to increase tubing flow rates. Because water has a low viscosity, it is often more
effective (but more costly) to inject produced or blend oil.

Another  recommended  practice  for  operations  prone  to  sand  production  is  to  build  excess
capacity into the equipment design to allow for the associated peak loading condition. If a sys-
tem normally operates at full capacity in terms of torque, power, etc., any incremental loading
will cause either a reduction in speed or a complete system shutdown, which may allow sand
to settle out above the pump and necessitate a workover if the rotor cannot be freed.

Produced  sands  tend  to  be  highly  abrasive,  causing  accelerated  wear  of  the  pump,  rod
string, and tubing. Because abrasive wear is directly proportional to the number of revolutions,
the  use  of  larger-displacement  pumps  operated  at  lower  speeds  can  help  to  extend  equipment
life. However, large-displacement pumps may not handle the sand as effectively as small-dis-
placement pumps. Stator wear can be minimized by choosing an elastomer with good abrasion
resistance. Although the standard chrome coating used on most rotors generally provides good
wear resistance, double-thickness chrome coatings are commonly specified for abrasive applica-
tions; alternatively, special coatings designed to withstand abrasive wear are also available and
have  shown  superior  performance  in  service.33  Note  that  chrome-coated  rotors  with  visible
wear can be repaired by replating as long as the underlying base metal has not been worn.

15.3.3 Low-Productivity or Pumped-Off Wells.  Low-productivity wells by definition deliver
relatively low fluid rates; as a result, operators usually attempt to maximize recovery rates by
producing them at low bottomhole pressures. If produced aggressively, the fluid column can be
drawn down to very low levels even in some relatively high-productivity wells. These pumped-
off  conditions  can  cause  pump  inflow  and  gas  interference  problems  that  prevent  the  pump

cavities from filling completely with liquid. This results in low volumetric pump efficiency, as
illustrated by the field data in Fig. 15.36.

Pump  inflow  problems  are  common  in  wells  producing  viscous  fluids  under  low  submer-
gence conditions. With highly viscous fluids, difficulties occur when the pump is operated at a
speed that exceeds the rate at which the fluid can flow into and up the narrow pump cavities
(cavity  flow  velocity  of  the  PC  pump).  Fig.  15.37  shows,  for  example,  a  dramatic  decline  in
pump  operating  efficiency  with  higher  speed  in  a  heavy  oil  well  application.  Although  the
trend  evident  in  the  data  can  be  attributed  in  part  to  increased  gas  interference  and  reduced
well  inflow  over  time, the  lower  bottomhole pressures  and  pump  inflow  constraints definitely
contributed to the large decline in efficiency.

Operating a PC pump at low volumetric efficiencies results in reduced heat removal rates,
higher  elastomer  temperatures,  and  increased  fluid  slippage,  which  can  substantially  escalate
wear rates (especially if sand is produced). As a result, continued operation at low volumetric
efficiency (< 30%) can lead to significantly reduced pump life. Pump selection is a key consid-
eration  in  low-productivity  wells,  given  the  potential  for  inflow  problems  to  be  mitigated  to
some degree through the use of a larger-displacement pump run at lower speed (i.e., the resul-
tant  higher  torque  requirements  need  to  be  considered).  Pump  intake  designs  with  minimal
flow  restrictions  are  also  desirable.  In  horizontal  wells,  pump  submergence  should  be  maxi-
mized by seating the pump intake as low as practical within the well.

The sensitivity of the dynamic fluid level to changes in the produced-fluid rate varies con-
siderably between wells. Extra attention must be paid when implementing speed changes on low-
productivity wells that can be pumped off rapidly to avoid damaging the pump. Caution should
also  be  used  when  basing  decisions  on  fluid-shot  data  in  heavy  oil  and  bitumen  applications
because it is common for a layer of foamy oil to exist in the annulus, which makes the acousti-
cally measured fluid levels misleading.

15.3.4 Gassy Well Production.  In most operations, dissolved gas begins to evolve as free gas
when the pressure drops as the fluid moves toward and then enters the well. Depending on the
fluid properties and gas volumes, the free gas may coalesce and flow as a separate phase, or,
as in the case of many heavy oil wells, it may remain trapped as discrete bubbles within the
liquid phase (foamy oil). Gas entering the pump causes an apparent decrease in pump efficien-
cy because the gas occupying a portion of the pump cavities is normally not accounted for in
the  fluid  volume  calculations.  The  pump  must  then  compress  the  gas  until  it  either  becomes
solution gas again or it reaches the required pump discharge pressure.

The  best  way  to  reduce  gas  interference  is  to  keep  any  free  gas  from  entering  the  pump
intake. When possible, the intake should be located below the perforations to facilitate natural
gas  separation.  Even  if  the  pump  can  be  sumped  below  the  perforations,  small  casing/tubing
annuli can lead to high flow velocities that can “trap” free gas and carry it to the pump intake,
thereby reducing the effectiveness of the natural gravity-based separation. Thus, seating of the
stator, which typically has a larger diameter than the tubing, either within or above the perfora-
tion interval should be avoided if possible. Another option is the use of slimhole PC pumps in
such circumstances.

In gassy wells in which the pump must be seated above the perforations, passive gas sepa-
rators  that  divert  free  gas  up  the  casing/tubing  annulus  can  be  effective.  In  such  cases,
assemblies  that  centralize  the  pump  intake  in  the  center  of  the  casing  should  be  avoided  be-
cause free-gas bypass tends to be more efficient in a skewed annular space.50 In directional or
horizontal wells, it is best to have the pump intake positioned on the low side of the wellbore
away  from  any  free-gas  flow,  which  naturally  tends  to  be  along  the  high  side  of  the  casing.
With the gravity assistance available in such wells, a short tail joint can be used to locate the
pipe  intake  on  the  low  side  of  the  well  casing.  Special  intake  devices  are  also  available  that
incorporate a swivel assembly to ensure that the fluid intake port remains on the low side of
the wellbore. Small-diameter or long tail joints should be avoided since flow losses within the
tail joint can result in increased gas volumes entering the pump.

Gas production through the pump can lead to substantial fluctuations in rod-string loading,
as  illustrated  by  the  field  data  shown  in  Fig.  15.38.  Loading  variations  can  be  attributed  to
discharge pressure fluctuations associated with changes in the fluid-column density and to the

IV-814

lifting  effects  of  the  gas  produced  up  the  tubing.  Pump  friction  may  also  vary  because  of
changes in fluid lubricity. The load fluctuations can be significant, particularly when substantial
percentages or slugs of gas enter the pump. Large, continuous changes in load may accelerate
rod fatigue problems or damage surface power transmission equipment.

When attempts are made to maximize fluid rates in gassy wells, the pump speed should be
increased in relatively small increments, with subsequent monitoring of the resulting effects on
production rates in order to identify the onset of gas interference problems.

15.3.5 Directional- and Horizontal-Well Applications.  Because of the inherent curvature (an-
gle build sections) and angled bottomhole segment of directional and horizontal wells, optimiza-
tion  of  a  PCP  system  design  for  such  applications  begins  with  the  drilling  program.  The
proposed well geometry, or directional plan, should take into consideration the design and oper-
ation attributes of a PCP system, including equipment selection, to contend with potential rod/
tubing-wear and rod-string fatigue problems, the preferred pump seating location for achieving
optimal production rates throughout the well life, and possible issues related to gas and solids
production.

The first line of defense against rod/tubing-wear and sucker-rod fatigue problems in deviat-
ed  and  horizontal  wells  is  a  good  wellbore  profile  (see  previous  sections  on  rod-string/tubing
wear and rod loading). Ideally, the planned angle build rates should be kept as low as practi-
cal,  and  additional  monitoring  is  typically  required  during  drilling  to  ensure  that  the  well
closely follows the prescribed path. Note that slant wells (wells spud at an angle on surface),
which typically have no planned curvature, often provide a good alternative to deviated wells
for shallow reservoir developments as a means to avoid rod/tubing-wear problems. With slant
wells, it is important to ensure that the well profile remains straight and does not “drop down”
into  the  target  bottomhole  location.  If  it  is  not  possible  to  avoid  high  wellbore  curvature
(>  5°/30  m  [5°/100  ft])  in  directional  or  horizontal  wells,  it  becomes  even  more  important  to
obtain the smoothest wellbore profile possible. Fluctuations in wellbore curvature and curvature
reversals usually lead to severe wear. Therefore, drilling programs should include clauses that

Fig. 15.39—Comparison of well curvatures based on open hole vs. gyro surveys.

specify both maximum curvatures (i.e., dogleg severity) and allowable rates of change in curva-
ture.

Experience6 has clearly demonstrated that closely spaced surveys (< 20 m [65 ft]) help to
prevent large local curvature fluctuations and can typically be justified from an overall capital-
and  operating-cost  perspective.  Closely  stationed  directional  surveys  are  also  helpful  in  deter-
mining  rod  centralization  requirements  at  a  later  stage.  Caution  should  be  exercised  when
specifying rod strings for directional and horizontal wells (i.e., where the pump is seated in the
build  section)  based  on  directional  surveys  with  long  survey  intervals  (>  30  m  [100  ft])  be-
cause the survey data may not reveal high-curvature segments that exist in the actual wellbore.
This is illustrated in Fig. 15.39, which compares the dogleg severity established along a direc-
tional well based on the widely stationed openhole survey data recorded during drilling and a
subsequent  closely  stationed  gyro  survey  run  in  the  cased  wellbore.  The  gyro  survey  depicts
significant variations and much higher curvatures. Therefore, if unexpected wear problems oc-
cur repeatedly at one or more locations along a directional or slant well, the survey may have
provided  a  poor  representation  of  the  actual  well  curvature,  and  appropriate  wear  mitigation
strategies must be taken to prevent additional failures.

In general, PCP installations that operate within the curved portions of directional or hori-
zontal  wells  must  be  equipped  to  deal  with  potential  wear  and  fatigue  problems.  To  protect
against  rod  and  tubing-wear  failures,  options  include  the  use  of  coated  centralizers  or  rod
guides with standard rod strings, use of continuous-rod strings, and use of coated and/or surface-
hardened tubing joints. Use of tubing rotator systems has also grown considerably over the past
decade because they have proved to be an effective preventive measure for severe wear prob-
lems in such applications. For example, a horizontal well that had experienced tubing failures
monthly was subsequently on production for > 5 months without a failure after installation of a
tubing  rotator.  From  a  rod-string  fatigue  perspective,  slimhole  coupling  or  centralizer  designs
offer the best performance because the inherent curvature localization adjacent to the connec-
tion  is  minimized.  Keeping  the  stresses  in  the  rod  string  at  reasonable  levels  under  all
operating conditions is crucial, and undertaking detailed loading/fatigue analyses is highly rec-
ommended at the system design stage to facilitate proper equipment selection for the specific
well conditions. Downhole-drive PCP systems, which remove any concerns about wear or fa-
tigue problems, are another option.

Fortunately, PC pumps can operate effectively at high well angles, even beyond horizontal.
However,  attention  is  required  when  the  pump  seating  interval  is  selected  to  avoid  potential
wear,  pump  inflow,  and  gas  interference  problems.  This  is  illustrated  by  Fig.  15.40,  which
presents a vertical section plot of a horizontal well that was inadvertently drilled with a “trap”
at the base of the build section. Because the severe sand plugging and gas slugging problems
that  occurred  with  the  pump  initially  seated  within  the  angle  build  section  led  to  several

IV-816

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

workovers,  the  operator  was  forced  to  try  seating  the  pump  in  the  horizontal  section  beyond
the  trap  at  the  location  shown.  Although  the  equipment  options  were  quite  limited  and  wear
problems  were  still  a  concern  for  this  well,  it  was  successfully  pumped  in  this  configuration
through the use of a continuous-rod string and a larger pump that could be run at low speeds.

Ideally, the pump should be seated as low as possible in directional and horizontal wells to
maximize  intake  pressures.  As  mentioned,  use  of  long,  small-diameter  tail  joints  should  be
avoided as a means to lower the intake position because of the inherent pressure losses. Depend-
ing on casing size, reducing the wellbore curvature over the planned pump seating interval may
be important to prevent the pump from having to operate in a bent configuration. This condi-
tion  would  negatively  affect  pump  life  and  increase  the  potential  for  wear  and  rod-string
fatigue failures directly above the pump. Operating a PC pump while bent may also introduce
the possibility for fatigue failures of the rotor within the stator. Close attention to the wellbore
inclination and curvature is also important in the selection of an optimal pump intake location
to ensure that the intake will not be positioned against the high side of the casing, thus increas-
ing  the  potential  for  gas  interference  problems.  This  is  especially  crucial  in  horizontal  wells,
which  are  more  prone  to  gas-slugging  conditions  as  a  result  of  elevation  variations  along  the
horizontal section. Sand production should also be taken into consideration in establishing the
pump intake position. Given that sand transport capabilities are reduced in the casing relative
to the smaller-diameter production tubing, seating the pump at nearly horizontal will reduce the
potential for problems resulting from sand buildup.

Achieving  proper  rotor  space  out  (i.e.,  positioning  of  the  rotor  within  the  stator)  is  also
more difficult in directional and horizontal wells because rod weight is normally a key parame-
ter used during rod-string installation to determine when the rotor enters the stator downhole.
Because  of  friction  and  the  non-vertical-well  profile,  the  weight  of  the  rod  string  is  partially
supported by the tubing in such wells. Experience and close attention to other details, such as
recording  accurate  measurements  of  tubing/rod-string  component  lengths  and  monitoring  for
rotation, become more important in these applications.

15.3.6 Hostile Fluid Conditions.  In many applications, the constituents of the produced fluids
pose the greatest difficulty in the successful use of PC pumps.51 In fact, the current use of PCP
systems  in  many  medium-  and  light-oil  wells  can  be  attributed  to  the  recent  development  of
new elastomers that can withstand the produced-fluid chemistry, allowing reasonable pump run
lives  to  be  achieved.  However,  further  developments  and  improvements  are  required  because
there are still relatively few PCPs used in fields producing light oils with gravities > 40°API.
The  presence  of  different  quantities  of  carbon  dioxide,  methane  and  hydrogen  sulfide  gases,
aromatics, and paraffins in the produced fluids, as well as different downhole temperature con-
ditions,  requires  that  special  consideration  be  given  to  elastomer  selection,  pump  sizing,  and
well operation. Aromatics such as benzene and toluene typically induce swelling of the stator
elastomer, which makes pump sizing more difficult, whereas H2S can cause extended vulcaniza-
tion, which results in hardening and eventual breakdown of the elastomer material. Diffusion of
a significant quantity of gas (in particular, CO2) into the stator elastomer can lead to blistering
or fracturing of the rubber because of rapid decompression of the pump during shutdowns.

Pump selection should be based on geometry considerations and stator elastomer properties
to minimize the swell potential, although some swelling of the elastomer is inevitable in most
cases.  Depending  on  the  type  of  elastomer  and  the  downhole  conditions,  total  elastomer
swelling can exceed 3 to 4 vol% in extreme cases, although much lower percentages are usual-
ly required for a pump to operate effectively and have a reasonable run life. Performing swell
tests is highly recommended to assist in pump selection and sizing when fluid compatibility is
expected to be an issue. Experience has shown that the swelling process can be quite gradual,
with it sometimes taking up to 6 months for the stator to reach the maximum swell condition.
To  compensate  for  the  substantial  swelling  expected  in  some  challenging  well  applications,
pumps  may  be  sized  so  loosely  that  they  cannot  generate  any  flow  at  pressures  below  their
rated capacity in a standard bench test. In such cases, the sizing process is usually a delicate
balance because, if pumps are fit too loosely, they will not be able to generate sufficient head
to produce fluid to surface for a long period of time. One approach used to avoid low initial
pumping efficiency because of loose sizing requirements is to complete the initial pump instal-
lation  with  a  tighter-fit  rotor  and  then  occasionally  to  replace  the  rotor  with  progressively
smaller  sizes  as  the  stator  swells.  However,  this  approach  obviously  requires  additional
workovers, which must be justified by the economics of the operation and comparison to other
practical options.

Given  the  many  parameters  that  can  influence  pump  life,  it  is  highly  recommended  that
operators  maintain  a  detailed  database  of  all  pump  testing  and  field  performance  records  to
establish optimal pump selection and sizing criteria. This information is also crucial in terms of
monitoring  failure  causes  and  effectively  guiding  pump  replacement  decisions  as  well  condi-
tions change.

The most common problem associated with gas diffusion into a stator is the damage caused
by  expansion  of  the  gas  trapped  within  the  elastomer  as  a  result  of  the  rapid  decompression
that  may  occur  under  shutdown  conditions.  Elastomer  selection  is  obviously  important  under
such conditions because some materials are much less prone to damage than others. Although
the  options  available  to  prevent  rapid  decompression  and  potential  damage  to  the  pump  are
limited, use of drive systems with brakes that prevent rapid drainage of the tubing during shut-
down events is highly recommended in these situations. There was also a unique check valve
product  available  previously  that  prevented  the  fluid  column  in  the  tubing  from  draining
through the pump in the event of a shutdown. Caution should be exercised when attempting to
restart such wells immediately after a shutdown to avoid a high-torque-overload condition and
potential  pump  damage.  It  is  also  very  important  to  avoid  multiple  restart  attempts  in  rapid
succession because this may lead to reduced brake effectiveness, rod-string failures, or severe
pump  damage.  If  a  high-torque  condition  can  be  attributed  to  stator  swelling/expansion,  the

IV-818

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

options are to load the tubing string to surface before attempting a restart or simply leaving the
well shut down for several hours (perhaps a full day) to give the elastomer time to relax.

The fluids produced in light-oil applications often contain substantial quantities of paraffin.
As fluid temperature declines through the production system, the waxes precipitate and accumu-
late on the inside of the tubing and flowlines. If the buildup becomes large enough to severely
restrict flow, additional flow losses are generated that increase the operating torque and power
requirements of the drive system. Because of the rotational nature of PCP systems, scrapers are
not  effective  at  cleaning  wax  from  the  tubing.  Although  chemical  and  hot-oil  treatments  are
available  to  remove  wax,  operators  must  ensure  these  treatments  will  not  damage  the  stator
elastomer.

The combination of CO2 and high water cuts may accelerate corrosion of the rod and tub-
ing  strings,  leading  to  failures  of  these  components.  The  rotary  interaction  of  the  rod  string
against the tubing, even in “vertical” wells, results in a corrosion/erosion process whereby the
material that would otherwise provide a protective film is constantly removed, leaving a fresh
surface  exposed  for  further  corrosion  attack.  Given  the  mechanisms  involved,  in  many  cases
the problems cannot be resolved by use of conventional rod guides or continuous-rod strings,
although operators have successfully used standard rod strings equipped with spin-thru central-
izers or rod guides to prevent additional failures in some wells. It is also important to instruct
field personnel to handle and install the rod strings carefully in such wells because any surface
damage will increase the potential for corrosion and corrosion/fatigue failures to occur. The use
of rod strings made with special materials may help to mitigate these corrosion problems, but
they are usually costlier. Some recently developed tubular products with liners or coatings have
also proven to be successful in reducing corrosion-related failures. Corrosion inhibitors can al-
so be used, but they must be compatible with the stator elastomer.

Different  well  stimulation  treatments  are  commonly  used  by  operators  to  improve  produc-
tion. When contemplating treatment of a well produced with a PCP system, particular attention
must  be  paid  to  the  chemistry  of  any  fluids  that  may  come  into  contact  with  the  pump.  For
example,  the  fluids  commonly  used  in  acidizing  jobs  will  remove  the  chrome  from  standard
rotors. Other chemicals may be incompatible with the elastomer and cause stator failure.

15.3.7 High-Speed  Operations.    As  the  equipment  has  improved  and  operators  have  gained
familiarity  with  PCP  systems,  pump  operating  speeds  have  increased  substantially.  Although
the  initial  heavy  oil  well  installations  were  typically  run  at  speeds  between  30  and  100  rpm,
speeds in the 300 to 500 rpm range are now common, and some operators have been known to
produce high-water-cut wells at speeds up to 1,000 rpm. Generally, speeds exceeding 500 rpm
are not recommended because they typically lead to reduced pump and surface equipment life,
increased potential for sucker-rod fatigue failures, and vibration problems.

Rod strings commonly experience excessive vibrations within certain speed ranges because
of  the  resonant  frequencies  of  the  system.  The  potentially  harmful  vibrations  can  usually  be
minimized by adjusting the speed slightly up or down. Some speed control systems even allow
the locking out of frequencies that cause harmonic problems. However, it is important to recog-
nize that the resonant frequencies of the system will likely change over time with variations in
the load and fluid flow conditions. Harmonics are an especially important consideration for the
portion of the rod string directly above the pump that naturally experiences a “whipping” ac-
tion because of the orbital motion of the rotor. The various factors influencing the severity of
the  whipping  motion  include  the  mass  and  eccentricity  of  the  rotor,  the  extent  to  which  the
rotor  sticks  out  above  the  stator,  the  well  configuration,  operating  speed,  anchored  vs.  unan-
chored tubing, and rod-string configuration. At higher speeds, this whipping action can lead to
accelerated rod and tubing wear and fatigue failures of the sucker rod. In wells that experience
repeated problems, additional rod centralization or different types of centralizers should be used.

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

Ensuring  that  PCP  installations  are  equipped  with  effective  braking  systems  and  tubing-
string torque anchors becomes very important for high-speed operations, particularly in deeper
wells.  These  devices  help  to  prevent  failures  associated  with  parted  rod  or  tubing  strings  and
surface equipment damage during shutdowns.

Tubing-string  failure  is  another  problem  that  has  been  encountered  in  some  higher-speed
PCP applications. The failures were characterized by a parting of one or more tubing joints at
the last thread on the pin adjacent to a coupling. The failures occurred at many different loca-
tions in the wells, including near surface, midstring, and above the pump, and attempts to solve
the  problem with  tubing  anchors  and  tubing  centralizers simply  led  to  a  subsequent  failure at
another  location  in  some  cases.  The  failures  occurred  after  only  a  few  weeks  in  some  wells
and  after  many  months  in  others.  Available  anecdotal  information  suggests  that  the  problems
were more prevalent in wells with large-volume pumps, high speeds, and improper rotor space-
out  (i.e.,  substantial  rotor  stickup  above  the  stator).  The  evidence  points  to  tubing  fatigue
failure  induced  by  vibration;  therefore,  consideration  should  be  given  to  possible  corrosion-
enhanced fatigue. Possible remedies may include changes in pump speed or pump seating depth.

15.3.8 Coalbed-Methane and Water-Source Well Applications.  PCPs  have  become  one  of
the most common types of lift methods for dewatering coalbed-methane wells. Water rates are
typically  high  during  initial  production  and  may  exceed  400  m3/d  [2,500  B/D]  in  some  cases
but normally decline to ≈ 25% of their original level after a few months. The produced water
often contains high concentrations of suspended sand from hydraulic fracturing, coal particles,
and dissolved solids. To facilitate maximum gas production, the wells are usually maintained in
close  to  a  pumped-off  condition.  This  tends  to  exacerbate  the  problems  associated  with  the
handling of produced gas. Because coalbed-methane wells typically have quite modest gas flow
rates, capital outlays and operating expenses must consequently be minimized for these opera-
tions to be economically viable.

Stator elastomer selection and pump sizing are critical in coalbed-methane applications. The
many substances contained in the produced water, either naturally or as additives, can have a
very detrimental effect on the performance of certain elastomers. Elastomer erosion characteris-
tics are also important, given the typical presence of significant quantities of frac sand and coal
particles in the produced water. In general, the best choice of elastomer for such abrasive pump-
ing conditions is a medium NBR because it generally has the best mechanical properties and,
with the inherently low ACN content (i.e., most nonpolar), can be expected to swell the least
amount  when  producing  water  that  is  polar.  However,  one  must  use  caution  because  some
NBR compounds are prone to high water swell. This is not the result of the polymer itself but
rather the presence of certain fillers or additives that have a tendency to draw in water. Since
there is no oil in the fluid to provide lubrication in these applications, it is very important to
ensure minimal elastomer swell because the tightening of the rotor/stator fit leads to high lev-
els  of  friction,  which  in  turn  can  cause  operational  problems  and  dramatically  reduce  pump
life. As a result, some vendors offer elastomer products specifically formulated for water-pro-
duction applications.

Solids production is usually most severe the first few weeks after a coalbed-methane well
is brought on production. PC pumping systems usually can effectively handle the sand and coal
particles contained in the produced water. However, some coal particles can reach diameters of
up to 20 mm [0.8 in.]. Difficulties arise when these larger coal particles become lodged in the
pump, resulting in a sharp escalation in operating torque, severe tearing of the stator, or com-
plete  pump  seizure.  To  prevent  these  problems,  slotted  pump  intake  or  tailpipe  assemblies
should be installed that are sized to prevent the entry of large coal particles but to allow pas-
sage of coal fines, sand, and water. Buildup of sand and coal particles around the pump intake
can decrease production rates and may cause pump failure as a result of complete blockage of

IV-820

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

the  pump  intake.  To  minimize  solids  accumulation  around  the  intake,  it  is  common  for  the
wells  to  have  sumps  that  extend  up  to  50  m  [160  ft]  below  the  pump.  When  the  tubing  is
pulled  for  a  workover,  the  well  must  be  flushed  out  to  ensure  that  the  maximum  volume  is
available  for  solids  deposition.  To  prevent  solids  from  settling  out  in  the  tubing  above  the
pump,  the  transport  velocity  of  the  water  must  exceed  the  settling  velocity  of  the  solids.  Be-
cause the flow losses associated with water production are normally insignificant, relatively small-
diameter tubing can be used to create high flow velocities and thus enhanced solids transport
capability.

By  nature,  coalbed  methane  operations  produce  substantial  quantities  of  gas.  Ideally,  the
produced gas flows up the casing/tubing annulus to the gathering facilities. In practice, howev-
er, some gas usually enters the pump, causing a corresponding reduction in efficiency (see Gassy-
Well  Applications  section).  Maintaining  reasonably  high  pump  efficiencies  is  especially
important in coalbed-dewatering and water-source well applications because more heat is gener-
ated by pump friction than in an oil well where the produced fluids provide more lubrication.
This  is  reflected  by  the  fact  that  burnt  pumps  are  a  most  common  mode  of  pump  failure  in
dewatering  applications.  As  a  result,  it  is  important  to  keep  gas  away  from  the  pump  intake
and to carefully monitor for pumped-off conditions. The pump intake should always be located
below  the  perforations  or  near  the  bottom  of  openhole  well  completions  to  encourage  natural
gas  separation.  It  is  not  uncommon  for  pumps  to  be  seated  up  to  100  m  [325  ft]  below  the
perforations  in  coalbed-methane  wells.  In  some  coalbed-methane  operations,  the  produced  gas
may  contain  a  fairly  high  percentage  of  CO2,  which,  as  noted,  can  cause  elastomer  swelling
and rapid decompression problems. In such cases, it becomes even more important to limit gas
flow through the pump, although the elastomer selection and pump sizing should take potential
swelling into consideration.

To achieve economic gas rates in most coalbed operations, the pressure (i.e., fluid level) at
the coal seam must be maintained at a very low level. It is not uncommon for pressures to be
as low as 140 kPa [20 psi], which equates to a fluid column above the perforations of only 14
m  [45  ft].  The  low  fluid  level  requirements,  combined  with  the  natural  fluctuations  in  water
flow rates from the coalbed, make it critical to use some form of pumpoff control to prevent
premature  pump  failures.  The  sophistication  of  these  systems  depends  on  the  application  and
can vary from basic manual to fully automated control. Typically, more elaborate systems are
required  for  wells  that  either  have  low  water  flow  rates  or  need  the  fluid  level  to  be  main-
tained  near  the  pump  intake.  The  most  basic  pumpoff  control  systems  use  some  form  of
apparatus that senses whether water is flowing at surface. Commonly used devices include dif-
ferential  pressure  switches  and  hot-wire  anemometers  mounted  in  the  flowline  near  the  well-
head.  Once  a  low-flow  condition  is  detected,  the  control  system  will  usually  shut  down  the
pumping  system.  Some  systems  will  subsequently  have  to  be  manually  restarted;  other  more
sophisticated systems will automatically restart the well after a certain time delay.

15.3.9 Elevated-Temperature Applications.  Elevated-temperature applications can be divided
into medium- and high-temperature categories. The medium-temperature category covers deeper-
well  applications  with  natural,  higher-temperature  reservoir  conditions  ranging  from  40°C
[104°F] to ≈ 100°C [212°F]. Field experience has proved that PC pumps can be used success-
fully  in  wells  producing  fluids  within  this  temperature  range  if  the  fluid  temperatures  remain
relatively constant. However, to achieve reasonable run lives in such wells, additional attention
must be given to elastomer and pump model selection, pump sizing practices, and system oper-
ation.  The  importance  of  these  considerations  rises  substantially  as  temperatures  increase
toward the higher end of this range. In such applications, some additional investigations should
be undertaken to assess the effects that elevated temperatures may have on the compatibility of
the  selected  elastomer  and  the  produced  fluids.  Stator  elastomer  debonding  problems  may  be

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

encountered  in  wells  producing  high-water-cut  fluids  at  bottomhole  temperatures  exceeding
≈ 85°C [185°F].

Applications  that  fall  into  the  high-temperature  category  (temperatures  >  100°C  [212°F])
include  many  geothermal  wells  and  most  thermal  recovery  operations.  Thermal  operations  in-
clude mature steamfloods in which the temperatures are also relatively constant but may be as
high as 200°C [400°F]; cyclic steam operations in which the temperatures can be even higher
and typically change substantially; and steam-assisted gravity-drainage wells, which may oper-
ate  over  a  wide  range  of  high-temperature  and  -pressure  conditions.  Currently,  such  high-
temperature  applications  pose  significant  challenges  to  routine  PCP  system  use,  and  most  of
the  relevant  experience  to  date  has  been  acquired  through  various  experimental  projects.  Al-
though the results from high-temperature tests conducted recently by various PC pump manu-
facturers  under  controlled  laboratory  conditions  have  shown  considerable  improvement  and
promise,  caution  is  warranted  in  translating  such  results  to  a  field  application  because  other
factors  besides  temperature  may  affect  performance  under  the  downhole  operating  conditions.
Nevertheless, given the potential market, both equipment manufacturers and operators continue
to  actively  pursue  alternative  pump  design  and  elastomer  developments  to  effectively  extend
the service temperature range of PC pumps for such applications.

Although the tolerance that elastomers have for high temperatures varies significantly with
formulation, the different elastomers used in PC pumps will all begin to experience permanent
chemical and physical changes with continued exposure to temperatures above their respective
limits.  These  changes  may  cause  the  elastomer  to  become  hard,  brittle,  and  cracked  and  in
some  cases  to  shrink,  which  typically  results  in  rapid  deterioration  in  pump  performance.  In
addition,  the  susceptibility  of  elastomers  to  damaging  chemical  attack  always  increases  with
higher temperatures. A general assessment of the values in the product literature from several
different PC pump vendors indicates that the temperature limit for NBR elastomers is typically
100°C  [212°F];  the  limits  for  HNBR  elastomers  are  125°C  [265°F]  (sulfur  cured)  and  150°C
[318°F] (peroxide cured); and for FKM elastomers, 200°C [425°F]. High temperature resistance
typically comes at the expense of other desirable attributes, such as good mechanical properties
(e.g., abrasion resistance), and these requirements often limit elastomer selection.

Severe problems with the sizing and performance of PC pumps are most common when the
producing temperatures in a well fluctuate substantially. Although different-sized rotors may be
interchanged  to  compensate  for  gradual  temperature  changes  over  several  months,  installation
of PC pumps in wells in which the bottomhole temperature varies regularly by > 15°C [27°F]
is usually not recommended.

The  thermal  expansion  coefficient  of  elastomers  is  approximately  an  order  of  magnitude
higher than that of steel; therefore, temperature changes cause stator elastomers to expand and
contract far more than the steel tube housing or the mating steel rotor. The stator housings are
also much stiffer than the elastomeric sleeve, so the thermal expansion of the elastomer leads
to  inward  deformation  and  distortion  of  the  pump  cavity.  The  magnitude  of  the  distortion  is
proportional  to  the  elastomer  thickness  at  any  given  point  on  the  pump  cross  section.  Fig.
15.41  shows  the  change  in  stator  cavity  geometry  with  increasing  thermal  expansion  of  the
elastomer. It is important to understand that thermal expansion changes are independent of any
fluid-induced swell effects, which can exacerbate pump sizing problems. As a result, some ven-
dors  now  offer  high-temperature  bench-testing  capabilities  as  a  means  to  eliminate  elastomer
thermal  expansion  as  a  parameter  to  be  addressed  indirectly  in  the  sizing  of  PC  pumps.  Be-
cause  pump  performance  and  fit  are  highly  dependent  on  temperature,  caution  should  be
exercised  when  bench-test  results  from  different  vendors  are  compared  to  ensure  consistency
among test parameters.

In certain situations, rod space-out procedures must take thermal expansion into considera-
tion.  If  the  tubing  is  anchored,  temperature  changes  will  cause  the  rod  string  to  lengthen

IV-822

relative  to  the  constrained  tubing.  For  example,  an  average  temperature  rise  of  50°C  [106°F]
will cause a 1000-m [3,280-ft] rod string to increase in length by > 0.5 m [1.6 ft]. However,
temperature variations do not affect spaceout in wells with unanchored tubing because the resul-
tant lengthening of the rod string and tubing is equal.

15.4 PCP System Installation, Automation, Troubleshooting, and Failure Diagnosis
Adherence to proper installation procedures for both downhole and surface equipment is key to
the successful operation and performance of a PCP system. Given the many different types of
equipment available and the number of system configuration alternatives, it is advisable to re-
view  the  product  manuals  provided  by  PCP  equipment  vendors  to  obtain  detailed  installation
instructions  and  system  operating  information  for  specific  installations.  The  well-servicing
guide books available from some service companies also provide useful information. Although
the following list highlights a few key system installation and startup considerations, it is not
intended to be comprehensive, and the appropriate equipment manuals should be consulted in
all cases:

• Confirm that the equipment at the wellsite is configured properly for making the follow-
ing connections: stator to tubing, tubing to drive head, rotor to sucker rods, and sucker rods to
drive shaft or polished rod. Ensure that the stator OD is sufficiently under the casing drift diam-
eter and that the rotor major diameter is less than the tubing-string drift diameter. Also, check
to ensure that the size of any rod guides or centralizers is appropriate for the selected tubing
size and weight.

• Visually inspect the various equipment components, new or used, for any signs of physi-

cal or chemical damage.

• Ensure that proper handling procedures are followed for all equipment components.
• Ensure that the tubing string is made up properly to API 5C1 specifications (i.e., makeup
torque  levels)  to  prevent  backoff  problems.  This  is  especially  important  if  a  tubing  anchor  is
not  used.  If  the  production  tubing  is  of  a  smaller  diameter  than  the  pump  stator,  run  at  least
one joint of larger-diameter tubing above the pump to allow for the eccentric motion of the rod
string above the pump, and then swage down.

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-823

• Ensure that the rod-string connections are cleaned, undamaged, and made up to the proper
API  torque  specifications  (power  tongs  will  likely  be  required  for  larger  rod  string  sizes).18
Proper makeup is essential to prevent failures during production operations, so it is recommend-
ed that every connection be validated by use of a makeup calibration card available from the
rod manufacturers. Installation of at least two rod centralizers directly above the pump is rec-
ommended for directional-well applications. Record the type and position of all centralizers used.
• In hollow-shaft-drive installations, ensure proper spaceout of the rod string so that polished-
rod  stickup  above  the  polished-rod  clamp  is  minimal  (≈  30  cm  [1  ft]  maximum).  Adequate
spaceout allowance is also required for thermal expansion of the rod string in higher-tempera-
ture applications in which a tubing anchor is used.

• Give special attention to wellhead alignment, especially in cases in which hammer union

connections are used. The use of flanged wellhead equipment is recommended.

• If  possible,  start  the  pump  slowly  and  increase  speed  gradually  after  a  minimum  of  5
minutes.  Note  that  after  startup  it  is  normal  to  hear  some  noise  generated  by  the  rods  if  rod
guides are not used. The noise should subside once the produced fluid reaches surface. Contin-
ue to monitor the system operation until it is clear that the unit is functioning properly.

• If possible, record torque and speed with time during startup to obtain breakaway torque

information.

15.4.1 PCP System Monitoring and Automation.  Well monitoring typically refers to the peri-
odic  or  continuous  measurement  of  production  parameters  and  evaluation  of  the  pumping
system operating conditions. Reasons for well monitoring include production optimization, fail-
ure  detection,  and  production  accounting.  Production  parameters  include  fluid  rates,  gas  rates,
water cuts, sand cuts, and fluid levels. Operating parameters include tubing-head pressure, casing-
head  pressure,  rotational  speed,  hydraulic  pressure,  motor  current,  and  polished-rod  loads.
Additional  production  performance  parameters,  such  as  pump  efficiency,  can  be  calculated
from measured values of the production and operating parameters and installed equipment spec-
ifications.

Depending on equipment type and application, a variety of methods are available to obtain
measurements  of  the  production  and  operating  parameters.  The  accuracy  or  frequency  of  the
measurements  required  for  production  optimization  varies  considerably,  depending  on  the  pa-
rameter and application. The cost and accuracy of the various methods available to measure the
individual parameters can also vary considerably.

Automated Monitoring and Control Systems.  Relatively few PCP systems are operated with
any sort of fully automated control system, although the use of ESC systems has grown consid-
erably.  In  most  cases,  measurements  of  such  key  parameters  as  fluid  level  and  polished-rod
torque are taken infrequently. These data are generally used by the operator to make decisions
regarding changing the pump speed on a particular well. In many cases, there may be periods
between these assessments where either the pump runs too fast and the well becomes pumped
off, which increases the potential for pump damage, or the pump runs too slow and the system
does not produce fluid at the maximum rate possible. Therefore, from both workover and pro-
duction  perspectives,  there  is  considerable  incentive  to  optimize  the  production  process  by
automating the measurement of a few key production and operation parameters and implement-
ing a system that uses the data to control the pumping system. Potential benefits of implement-
ing such a system include the following:

• Provide accurate, timely data for use in analysis of individual well production performance.
• Provide operators with a means to visually assess current well conditions and performance

from remote locations.

time.

• Provide immediate identification of existing or potential problems that could lead to down-

• Provide access to historical data for use with production optimization software tools.

IV-824

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

• Increase  the  time  available  to  operators  and  engineers  for  identifying  and  implementing

production optimization programs.

The  first  and  probably  most  beneficial  step  toward  fully  automated  well  monitoring  and
control is implementing a pumpoff control system. Most operators base their operating strate-
gies on the bottomhole pressure they wish to maintain. The common practice is to try to pump
the well at the rate which maintains the bottomhole pressure at the lowest level possible with-
out running the pump dry or causing it to produce large quantities of gas. Usually, this strategy
is implemented by periodically checking the annular fluid level and adjusting the pump speed
according  to  the  interpreted  results.  However,  this  approach  suffers  from  inaccuracies  in  the
methods  used  to  measure  fluid  levels  and  the  relatively  long  periods  that  are  typical  between
actual measurements.

The  preferred  approach  is  to  measure  bottomhole  pressure  directly  with  a  downhole  pres-
sure  gauge  or  an  automatically  actuated  acoustic  device.  The  gauge  can  be  suspended  on
wireline, strapped to the tubing string, or permanently installed on the well casing. The output
from the downhole gauge can be displayed at surface for manual reading, or better yet, it can
be processed and stored by a data logging system at a given time interval. The data acquired
can be interpreted and used by the operator to adjust the pump speed. A more effective use of
the data is in conjunction with a variable-speed controller and a feedback control system. The
operating  speed  of  the  downhole  pump  can  be  adjusted  automatically  by  a  feedback  control
system, thereby ensuring that the bottomhole pressure in the well is maintained at the desired
level. Other available systems measure pump temperature, fluid rate, or axial loads as a means
to control pumpoff.52–54

Providing fluid rate, polished-rod torque, polished-rod axial load, and various other parame-
ters as additional feedback to a control system is conceivable. Certain consistent decisions can
be made automatically by software algorithms, and accurate data can be made available to the
operator so that more complex optimization and diagnosis decisions can be made.

Often, motor line current is measured and used to estimate rod-string torque. However, the
relationship between current and torque depends on the efficiency and power factor of the mo-
tor.  When  speed  remains  constant,  the  current  draw  will  often  vary  linearly  with  changes  in
torque demand. This indicates that the motor efficiency–power factor product remains relatively
constant  over  what  is  usually  a  small  torque  range.  However,  when  an  ESC  system  is  intro-
duced,  speeds  and  loads  usually  change  significantly  over  time.  These  changes  can  result  in
large  variations  in  motor  efficiency  and  power  factor.  This  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  15.42,  which
shows,  for  a  single  well,  the  variation  in  polished-rod  torque,  motor  efficiency-power  factor
product,  and  motor  output  power  with  line  current.  At  high  currents,  with  the  motor  loaded
near  its  rated  power  of  30  kW  [40  hp],  the  motor  efficiency-power  factor  product  is  ≈  70%.
This corresponds to a motor efficiency of 90% and a power factor of 0.8, which are close to
nominal for full-load conditions. Unfortunately, as the current draw decreases, the motor effi-
ciency-power  factor  product  declines  to  ≈  30%.  Thus,  when  the  motor  was  operating  at  low-
load  conditions,  the  efficiency  and  power  factor  were  also  very  low.  Consequently,  torque
values determined from nominal motor efficiencies and power factors may be artificially high.
Depending on the conditions, this might result in a well operating at a lower speed than neces-
sary on the basis of prescribed torque limits. Therefore, caution is required when polished-rod
torque is determined from motor line current.

15.4.2 Troubleshooting.  Most  PCP  equipment  vendors  provide  information  describing  trou-
bleshooting  procedures  and  suggestions  for  solving  problems  that  may  be  encountered  with
their equipment. To assist in the diagnosis and correction of operational problems that may be
encountered in PCP system installations, Table 15.5 outlines several problematic operating sce-
narios  and  provides  some  possible  explanations  and  corresponding  actions  or  strategies  that
may be taken to solve the problems. In some cases, the source of a particular operational prob-

lem  may  be  easily  addressed;  in  other  situations,  the  problem  may  be  quite  difficult  to
diagnose and expensive to resolve, especially if a workover is required. It is important to con-
sider  all  the  information  available  because  further  problems  can  be  caused  if  the  diagnosis  is
incorrect  and  the  wrong  mitigation  strategy  is  taken.  Specific  troubleshooting  actions  may  be
taken to determine the actual source of a problem if the system remains operational. For exam-
ple, some additional backpressure can be applied to the system by partially closing the flowline
valve to test the pressure integrity of the pump (e.g., if a worn or damaged pump condition is
suspected). In such a case, the pump is likely okay if the flow rate remains constant and the
system  torque  increases  proportionally.  Another  technique  is  to  implement  speed  changes  to
diagnose problems associated with well inflow or gas interference conditions.

15.4.3 Pump Failure Analyses.  When a PC pump is pulled during a workover, it should be
sent to a pump shop for a thorough examination and pump test. Usually, the pump components
are first cleaned and visually inspected. Inspection of the rotor involves examining the condi-
tion of the threads and pin, assessing the amount and location of any wear, and identifying the
presence of any heat checking. Although equipment is available to perform a full examination
of the internals of a stator (e.g., bore-scope camera), not all vendors have these systems, and
stator inspections are often limited to the visual checking of the long stator cavity for signs of
damage  or  deterioration  from  the  two  ends.  The  elastomer  surface  typically  is  examined  as
carefully as possible to locate any areas of worn, hardened, cracked, torn, swollen, or missing
rubber. If the rotor and stator components show no evidence of failure, the pump will subse-
quently  be  bench  tested.  If  the  test  results  show  that  the  pump  is  within  the  accepted  perfor-
mance  guidelines  for  the  particular  application,  it  will  usually  be  sent  back  to  the  field  for
redeployment.  Pumps  that  are  tested  but  do  not  meet  the  guidelines  may  be  retested  with  a
new rotor if the stator appears to be in good condition. The stator will be scrapped if further
testing provides evidence that it has sustained permanent damage (e.g., severe wear or loss of
rubber).

IV-826

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Observations made during failed-pump inspections typically provide information that is cru-
cial  to  the  accurate  determination  of  the  root  cause  of  failures.  This  knowledge  is  usually
essential for establishing appropriate remedial actions to achieve improved pump run lives. The
failure attributes provide clear indications of the physical mechanisms that resulted in damage
to either the rotor or stator. The following sections provide descriptions of the unique damage
characteristics associated with different types of pump failure mechanisms.

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-827

Fig. 15.43—Example of fatigue failure.

Stator Fatigue Failure.  Fatigue failures are characterized by missing rubber primarily along
the rotor/stator seal lines. The regions of torn or missing rubber are typically shiny and irregu-
lar  (Fig.  15.43).  Fatigue  failures  can  be  attributed  to  excessive  cyclic  deformation  of  the
elastomer. As the material properties degrade, shear stresses can more readily generate cracks
in the elastomer that subsequently propagate and eventually cause pieces of the rubber to sepa-
rate  from  the  pump.  Excessive  hysteretic  heat  buildup  can  accelerate  material  damage  and
associated crack growth. The loss of material along the rotor/stator seal lines leads to increased
slip and a rapid decline in pump performance. Stators that have missing rubber as a result of
fatigue damage are not suitable for reuse and must be scrapped.

Stator  Wear.    Stator  wear  usually  can  be  attributed  to  the  forced  movement  of  abrasive
solids along the stator cavities, although some wear can also occur because of the normal inter-
action  of  the  rotor  and  stator  during  pump  operation.  Worn  stators  are  characterized  by  the
presence  of  roughened  worn  surfaces,  usually  along  the  minor  diameter.  The  rate  of  abrasive
wear is related most strongly to the quantity and abrasiveness (i.e., size, shape, and hardness)
of the solid particles contained in the produced fluid. Wear rates are also influenced by elas-
tomer  type;  soft  stator  materials  are  more  likely  to  deform  instead  of  tearing  as  solids  pass
through the pump. Stator wear is also proportional, but not necessarily linear, to the amount of
interaction  that  occurs  between  the  rotor  and  stator;  consequently,  stators  tend  to  wear  out
more quickly at higher rotational speeds. Stator wear produces a gradual decline with time in
volumetric efficiency and fluid rate. This effect is most pronounced when producing low-viscos-
ity (< 100 cp [100 mPa·s]) fluids. Stators damaged by significant wear cannot be repaired and
should be scrapped.

Rotor Wear.  Rotor wear results from normal pumping action. Depending on the downhole
conditions  and  exposure  time,  the  severity  of  the  wear  rates  can  vary  dramatically.  Normal
abrasive wear can be identified by the presence of erosion marks in the chrome plating along
the  major  diameter  of  the  rotor.  Extreme  abrasive  wear  is  characterized  by  material  loss
through the surface coating and into the underlying base metal of the rotor. Examples of coat-
ing wear and severe base metal wear are shown in Fig. 15.44. Worn rotors can be rechromed
and  reused  as  long  as  the  wear  has  not  progressed  through  the  chrome  surface.  Rotors  that
have sustained base-metal wear usually must be scrapped.

In some cases, base-metal wear is observed only on the top section of a rotor. This usually
indicates contact between the upper portion of the rotor and the production tubing and can be
attributed to the rotor being landed too high above the tag bar.

Stator  Fluid  Incompatibility.    Fluid  incompatibility  and  gas  permeation  can  pose  serious
problems  for  stator  elastomers.  Signs  of  damage  caused  by  fluid  incompatibility  include

IV-828

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

swelling,  softening,  or  surface  blistering  of  the  stator  elastomer.  Visible  swelling  is  the  most
common,  occurring  to  some  extent  in  many  different  applications.  The  compatibility  between
the elastomer and produced fluid determines the degree of swelling and the rate of any subse-
quent deterioration in mechanical properties. Badly swollen stators will often fail pump tests as
a  result  of  excessive  torque  or  poor  performance  and  must  be  scrapped.  Stators  that  are  only
slightly swollen may be paired with a smaller-diameter rotor and reused.

Gas Permeation and Rapid Decompression.  In gassy wells, stators are prone to severe dam-
age under rapid decompression conditions (e.g., shutdown events) that facilitate the expansion
of any gas that has diffused into the elastomer. The damage is caused when the force exerted
by  the  pressurized  gas  trapped  within  the  elastomer  exceeds  the  tear  strength,  which  leads  to
subsurface  tearing  of  the  material.  These  failures  are  characterized  by  a  number  of  very  soft,
typically raised bubble areas or blisters on the stator cavity surface.

Rotor Fluid Incompatibility.  Fluid  incompatibility  also  occurs  with  rotors,  but  to  a  much
lesser  extent  than  with  stators.  Incompatibility  can  be  identified  by  discoloration  of  the  rotor
and, in some cases, pitting of the base metal. It usually results from corrosive or acidic fluids
attacking the chrome coating. Removing the outer chrome coating makes the rotor more suscep-
tible to abrasive wear and may produce a noticeable increase in friction torque because of the
loss  of  the  smooth  surface  finish.  Unless  the  rotor  has  extensive  pitting,  it  usually  can  be
rechromed and reused.

High-Temperature  Stator  Damage.    Stators  that  have  failed  because  of  exposure  to  high
temperatures typically exhibit elastomer surfaces that are hard, brittle, and extensively cracked.
Fig.  15.45  shows  an  example  of  a  stator  damaged  by  high-temperature  operation.  Causes  of
excessive heat include running the pump dry, high produced-fluid temperatures, and heat gener-
ation within the pump. Heat damage usually produces a rapid decline in the pump’s volumetric
efficiency. Stators that have failed because of high-temperature damage cannot be repaired and
must be scrapped.

Rotor  Heat-Cracking  Damage.    Heat  cracking  can  be  identified  by  fine  cracks  in  the
chrome plating of the rotor, primarily along the major diameter, although cracking may extend
over the entire surface. Heat cracking is the result of differential expansion of the chrome and
base metal in response to temperature changes. These cracks are considered normal, and minor
heat cracking does not appear to affect PC pump performance negatively, although the slightly
roughened surface may affect pump life. Most operators reuse rotors that have sustained minor
heat cracking.

Fig. 15.45—High-temperature stator damage.

Fig. 15.46—Stator damage caused by pressure wash.

Stator  Debris  Damage.    Occasionally,  stators  will  exhibit  damage  in  the  form  of  large
gouges or tears in the elastomer. This type of damage can be attributed to large foreign parti-
cles, such as pebbles, perforation plugs, or metallic debris, passing through the pump. In many
cases, debris damage may go undetected unless an internal camera is used or caliper inspection
is performed. Depending on the degree of damage, the pump may or may not be suitable for
reuse.

Stator High-Pressure Wash.  High-pressure wash or channeling is a common stator damage
mechanism characterized by worm-like holes or groves cut in the elastomer (Fig. 15.46). These
channels develop during production when a large sand particle or other debris becomes embed-
ded in the elastomer material, creating a small orifice across the rotor/stator seal through which
fluid passes at high velocity, eroding and cutting away the stator rubber. Because the channel-
ing  damages  the  pressure  integrity  of  the  pump,  stators  with  extensive  pressure-wash  damage
are not recommended for reuse.

System-Failure  Analysis.    A  thorough  analysis  should  be  conducted  after  each  downhole
equipment failure incident to identify the circumstances during design, manufacturing, installa-
tion,  and  operation  that  likely  resulted  in  the  failure.  Over  time,  this  will  lead  to  a  valuable
database  of  information  that  can  be  used  to  optimize  PCP  system  design  and  operation  for  a
particular well or field.

15.5 Design Example

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

15.5.1 Problem  Statement.    A  vertical  well  is  expected  to  produce  100  m3/d  [629  B/D]  of
12°API  oil  and  no  water,  gas,  or  sand.  The  well  is  cased  with  177.8  mm  [7  in.]  OD  casing
perforated at 1000 m [3,281 ft] from surface. At the desired flow rate, the fluid level is expect-
ed to be 600 m [1,968 ft] from surface. The casing is vented to atmosphere, while the flowline
pressure is 1500 kPa [218 psi]. The oil viscosity is 1,000 cp [1000 mPa·s].

Design a PCP system to produce this well with the following constraints. The pump should
be set below the perforations at 1010 m [3,312 ft]; its speed should not exceed 350 rpm; and
the  pump  should  not  be  loaded  above  its  rated  pressure.  The  rod  stress  should  be  <  80%  of
yield (assume API Grade D rods).

The  following  pumps  are  available.  Assume  that  any  of  these  pumps  will  operate  at  85%
volumetric  efficiency  under  downhole  conditions  and  that  the  friction  torque  will  be  20%  of
the hydraulic torque at the pump’s rated pressure.

Solution.  Using Eq. 15.4, we can determine the minimum displacement required to achieve

the desired flow rate without exceeding the specified maximum pump speed:

smin =

100qa
ωE

=

100 × 100 m3 / d
85 % × 350 rpm

= 0.336 m3 / d / rpm .

The pump displacement must be > 0.336 m3/d/rpm. This eliminates Pumps A and B from

The next step is to determine the differential pressure on the pump using Eqs. 15.5 through

further consideration.

15.7. The pump intake pressure is:

pi = pch + pg + pL .

Casing-head pressure was defined in the problem statement to be atmospheric pressure, or
0 kPa (gauge pressure). The gas and liquid hydrostatic pressures can be calculated from the gas
and liquid densities and the column heights. The pump intake is 1010 m from surface, and the
fluid level is 600 m from surface. This means that there is 600 m of gas column and 410 m of
liquid column. An average gas density can be estimated from the pressure at surface: 0.8 kg/
m3.

pg = ρg × g × hgas = 0.8 kg / m3 × 9.81 m / s2 × 600 m = 4700 Pa ≈ 5 kPa .

This gives a gas column hydrostatic pressure of 5 kPa. (Note that this method is an approx-
imation; the actual gas density will change as the pressure increases, but because the value is

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-831

so small relative to the other pressures in the system, the error introduced by this approxima-
tion  is  small.)  The  density  of  12°API  oil  is  984  kg/m3,  so  the  liquid  hydrostatic  pressure  is
3958 kPa:

pL = ρL × g × hL = 984 kg / m3 × 9.81 m / s2 × 410 m = 3 958 000 Pa ≈ 3958 kPa .

The pump intake pressure is pi = 0 + 5 + 3958 = 3963 kPa .

In this case, the produced oil must flow from the perforations past the pump to reach the
intake. Any flow losses here must also be considered in calculating the pump intake pressure.
However,  because  the  distance  is  small  and  there  is  a  large  clearance  between  the  pump  and
casing,  these  losses  are  small  and  can  be  neglected.  Note  that  if  139.7  mm  OD  casing  had
been used instead, there would be a very small annulus between the casing and the pump, and
the flow losses between the perforations and the intake could be quite significant.

The pump discharge pressure is calculated from:

pd = pth + pL + plosses .

The tubing-head pressure is given as 1500 kPa. The liquid hydrostatic head will depend on
the location of the top of the pump. The pump is seated at 1010 m (intake depth), but the three
pump alternatives have different lengths, so the top will be at a different location in each case.
Also, the flow loss will depend on the selection of tubing and rods. The solution process will
be iterative; it is necessary to calculate these values for one set of equipment and then redo the
calculation  if  it  appears  that  the  selected  equipment  may  not  be  the  best  choice.  If  the  pump
length is 8 m, the top of the pump will be at 1002 m, and the hydrostatic head of the liquid in
the tubing is 9673 kPa:

pg = ρg × g × hg = 984 kg / m3 × 9.81 m / s2 × 1002 m = 9 673 000 Pa ≈ 9673 kPa .

The calculation of flow losses was not described in detail in this chapter, but many differ-
ent  formulations  are  available  in  the  literature,  including  this  Handbook.  For  now,  we  will
consider the use of 88.9 mm × 13.8 kg/m tubing, with 25.4 mm rods, 7.62 m in length, with
standard  couplings  (55.6  mm  diameter,  101.6  mm  length).  For  the  specified  well  depth,  131
couplings are needed, for a total length of 13.3 m; the remaining 988.7 m (assuming that the
top of the pump is at 1002 m) is covered by rod segments. We can calculate the flow losses
past 988.7 m of rod and 13.3 m of coupling separately and then add the two results together to
obtain the total flow loss. This approximation neglects the flow effects at the ends of the cou-
plings, but it should still provide adequate results. The ID of 88.9 mm × 13.8 kg/m tubing is
76.0  mm,  and  the  drift  diameter  is  72.82  mm.  For  flow  calculations,  it  is  recommended  that
the ID instead of drift diameter be used. Assuming that the rods and couplings are concentric,
the  flow  losses  can  be  calculated  (using  one  method)  to  be  5223  kPa  past  the  rod  body  and
841  kPa  past  the  couplings  for  a  total  of  6064  kPa.  If,  as  normally  expected,  the  rods  and
couplings  are  not  concentric  within  the  tubing,  the  flow  losses  would  be  somewhat  reduced,
but such a reduction will not be considered here, so the results are conservative.

We can now calculate the pump discharge pressure,

pd = pth + pL + plosses = 1500 + 9672 + 6064 kPa,

and the pump differential pressure,

IV-832

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

plift = pd − pi = 17 237 − 3963 = 13 274 kPa .

The pump is required to work against a differential pressure of 13 274 kPa. Only Pumps C
and D have a pressure rating exceeding this value. Also, note that Pump E cannot be used with
this  tubing  because  the  major  rotor  diameter  is  larger  than  the  drift  diameter  of  the  tubing.
However, if a larger tubing size that would accommodate the large rotor diameter were used,
the  flow  losses  would  be  reduced,  possibly  to  the  point  that  the  pressure  rating  of  Pump  E
would  not  be  exceeded.  Therefore,  Pump  E  will  continue  to  be  considered  a  potential  candi-
date. All of the pumps have an OD that is less than the drift diameter of even the heaviest-wall
177.8 mm casing. Therefore, none of these pumps must be eliminated due to casing size.

The next task is to estimate the torque in the rods. The torque on the pump is given by:

Tt = Th +T f .

The  friction  torque  was  estimated  in  the  problem  statement  to  be  20%  of  the  hydraulic

torque at the pump’s rated pressure. Hydraulic torque is calculated from Eq 15.8:

Th = 0.111 s plift .

From this, we can estimate the friction torque for each pump. For example, for Pump C,

T f = 0.111 × 0.45 m3 / d / rpm × (20% × 18000 kPa) = 180 N · m .

Accordingly, the values are: Pump C - 180 N·m; Pump D - 233 N·m; and Pump E - 266 N·m.
Next, the hydraulic torque for a differential pressure of 13 274 kPa is calculated for each

of these pumps as

Th = 0.111 × 0.45 m3 / d / rpm × 13274 kPa = 663 N · m (for Pump C) .

Thus,  the  hydraulic  torque  values  are  as  follows:  Pump  C  -  663  N·m;  Pump  D  -  1026  N·m;
and Pump E - 1470 N·m.

The  torque  on  the  rod  string  includes  the  pump  torque  plus  torsional  loading  of  the  rod
string resulting from mechanical interaction (friction) with the tubing and the resistance to rota-
tion  caused  by  the  fluid  viscosity.  In  a  vertical  well,  the  tubing  friction  loads  can  usually  be
considered  negligible.  The  resistive  torques  for  each  of  these  pumps  can  be  calculated  at  the
speed at which they would run to produce the required amount of oil42: Pump C - 69.4 N·m;
Pump  D  -  44.4  N·m;  and  Pump  E  -  31.2  N·m.  The  total  rod  torque  is  then  the  sum  of  the
respective pump friction, hydraulic torque and rod resistive torque values: Pump C - 912 N·m;
Pump D - 1304 N·m; and Pump E - 1768 N·m.

When considering rod loading, we must calculate the axial load in the rods and the torque.

Axial load can be found from Eq. 15.10:

Fr = Fp +∑Fw –∑Fu .

Calculation of the uplift forces will be neglected for this example, providing a slightly con-
servative  result.  The  rod  weight  is  easily  calculated  from  the  specific  weight  of  steel  and  the
rod  volume,  neglecting  the  additional  weight  from  the  couplings  and  upsets.  For  a  25.4  mm
rod that is 1002 m long (Pump C) with a steel specific weight of 77 kN/m3, the rod weight is

Chapter 15—Progressing Cavity Pumping Systems

IV-833

Fw = V × 77 kN / m3 = 1002 m ×

π
4

× (0.0254 m)2 × 77 kN / m3 = 39.1 kN .

For pumps D and E, with their respective rod lengths, the rod weights are 38.9 kN and 39.0 kN.

Pump load is given by Eq. 15.11 as

Fp = C (pd – pi) × 0.6 × (2d2 + 13ed + 16e2) – pddr
2 ,

where C = 7.9 × 10–4 when p is in Newtons, d and e are in millimeters, and pressures are in
kPa.

To  get  the  eccentricity  values  for  the  pumps  for  use  in  this  equation,  we  must  recognize
that  the  major  diameter  is  equal  to  the  minor  diameter  plus  twice  the  eccentricity.  Therefore,
the  eccentricities  for  Pumps  C,  D,  and  E  are  8.5,  7.0,  and  11.5  mm,  respectively.  At  a  dis-
charge pressure of 17 238 kPa and intake pressure of 3963 kPa, the axial load at the pump is
as follows: Pump C - 38.2 kN; Pump D - 45.5 kN; and Pump E - 85.0 kN. So, neglecting the
uplift  forces,  the  total  axial  rod  loads  corresponding  to  the  three  pumps  are:  Pump  C  -  77.3
kN; Pump D - 84.4 kN; and Pump E - 124.1 kN.

The total stress of the rods can now be determined using Eq. 5.13. For Pump C, this gives:

σe =

7.68 × 108 × 9122

+

16 · 773002
π225.44
= 23723 + 241018

π225.46

= 514 MPa .

The  maximum  stress  is  514  MPa,  which  is  88%  of  the  minimum  yield  for  Grade  D  rods
[586  MPa].  Note  that  the  rod  stresses  exceed  the  yield  capacity  if  the  other  two  pumps  are
used. This condition would be in violation of the 80% loading criterion included in the prob-
lem statement.

To redesign the system to produce the well within the specified parameters, it appears that
two viable options would be to decrease the differential pressure on the pump, or to increase
the strength of the rods. There is nothing that can be done to reduce the hydrostatic head on
the system while maintaining the same flow rate. However, a decrease in flow rate would re-
duce flow losses and would cause the fluid level in the casing to rise, thus increasing the pump
intake  pressure  and  decreasing  the  pump  differential  pressure.  The  tubing-head  pressure  can
typically  be  reduced  significantly  only  through  changes  in  the  gathering  system  to  reduce  the
flowline pressure, through the addition of a transfer pump, or through the use of viscosity-re-
ducing chemicals at surface.

Another way to decrease the pressure on the pump is to reduce the flow losses, which ac-
counted  for  almost  half  the  differential  pump  pressure.  This  can  be  achieved  either  through
diluent injection or by increasing the flow area in the production tubing by using a larger-diam-
eter  pipe  or  a  smaller-diameter  rod  string.  Although  using  smaller  rods  would  reduce  flow
losses, the load capacity would also be reduced (assuming the same material), so this does not
appear  to  be  a  viable  option,  although  the  use  of  higher-strength  rods  may  be  an  option  in
some cases. However, the use of a larger tubing string seems quite practical in this case.

The  flow  losses  with  114.3  mm  tubing  with  25.4  mm  rods  would  be  ≈  1338  kPa.  This
reduces the differential pressure to 8548 kPa, producing a corresponding reduction in the pump
hydraulic  torque  values.  The  resistive  torque  is  also  reduced  slightly.  The  total  torque  on  the
rod  string  for  the  three  pump  candidates  can  be  recalculated  to  give  the  following  values:

IV-834

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Pump C - 671 N·m; Pump D - 935 N·m; and Pump E - 1241 N·m. The total axial load on the
rod string can be recalculated as follows: Pump C - 63.0 kN; Pump D - 67.5 kN; and Pump E
- 93.0 kN. With the lower torque and axial loads, the peak rod stress in the three cases is as
follows:  Pump  C  -  382  MPa  (65%);  Pump  D  -  520  MPa  (89%),  and  Pump  E  -  693  MPa
(118%). Pump C now gives a rod stress that is below 80% of yield, the criterion in the prob-
lem  statement;  the  other  two  pumps  will  still  cause  the  rod  stress  to  exceed  the  specified
criterion. Note that Pump C will operate at 261 rpm to produce 100 m3/d/rpm at a volumetric
efficiency of 85%.

At this point in a typical system design, the pump, tubing, and rods have all been selected.
The surface-drive system must now be established. The rod-string axial load at the surface is
63  kN,  the  torque  is  671  N·m,  and  the  operating  speed  of  the  polished  rod  is  261  rpm.  A
suitable  drive  can  be  selected  from  any  manufacturer’s  catalog  by  comparing  these  values  to
the  published  load  and  speed  limits.  The  type  of  drive  head  (right  angle  or  vertical,  solid  or
hollow shaft, direct electric or hydraulic, etc.) normally is based on user preferences and field
characteristics. For example, if electricity is not available, then an internal combustion engine
must  be  used,  which  normally  leads  to  the  selection  of  a  hydraulic  system  because  otherwise
the  belts  would  typically  have  to  be  very  long.  If  electricity  is  available  but  electronic  speed
control systems are not available or used in the area, hydraulic systems are often still preferred
if regular speed adjustments are anticipated; otherwise, direct electric drives with a fixed selec-
tion of belts/sheaves or gears are typically used.

This  example  problem  did  not  address  wear  and  fatigue  considerations  because  a  vertical
well  was  specified.  In  directional  wells,  however,  wear-  and  fatigue-related  problems  can  be
significant. Estimating fatigue life and wear rates is quite difficult and is beyond the scope of
this chapter. The example problem also did not consider the many issues that can arise when
wells produce gas. The presence of gas affects both the frictional pressure losses and the hydro-
static gradient, and the corresponding calculations are much more complex. Pump efficiency is
also  significantly  affected  by  any  free  gas  that  enters  the  pump  intake.  Most  pump  vendors
have access to software tools that can be used to complete a system design evaluation for these
more complex applications.

Plunger Lift

16.1 Introduction
Plunger  lift  has  become  a  widely  accepted  and  economical  artificial-lift  alternative,  especially
in high-gas/liquid-ratio (GLR) gas and oil wells (Fig. 16.1). Plunger lift uses a free piston that
travels  up  and  down  in  the  well’s  tubing  string.  It  minimizes  liquid  fallback  and  uses  the
well’s energy more efficiently than does slug or bubble flow. As with other artificial-lift meth-
ods, the purpose of plunger lift is to remove liquids from the wellbore so that the well can be
produced at the lowest bottomhole pressures. [CD edition includes video clips—Basic Plunger
Animation and Plunger Lift System.]

Whether in a gas well, oil well, or gas lift well, the mechanics of a plunger-lift system are
the  same.  The  plunger,  a  length  of  steel,  is  dropped  through  the  tubing  to  the  bottom  of  the
well and allowed to travel back to the surface. It provides a piston-like interface between liq-
uids  and  gas  in  the  wellbore  and  prevents  liquid  fallback—a  part  of  the  liquid  load  that
effectively is lost because it is left behind. Because the plunger provides a “seal” between the
liquid and the gas, a well’s own energy can be used to lift liquids out of the wellbore efficiently.
A  plunger  changes  the  rules  for  liquid  removal.  In  a  well  without  a  plunger,  gas  velocity
must be high to remove liquids,1 but with a plunger, gas velocity can be very low.2–4 Thus, the
plunger system is economical because it needs minimal equipment and uses the well’s gas pres-
sure  as  the  energy  source.5–7  Used  with  low  line  pressures  or  compression,  plunger  lift  can
produce many types of wells to depletion.3,5,8

In recent years, the advent of microprocessors and electronic controllers,9–12 the studies de-
tailing the importance of plunger seal and velocity,13 and an increased focus on gas production
have  led  to  a  much  wider  use  and  broader  application  of  plunger  lift.  Microprocessors  and
electronic controllers have increased the reliability of plunger lift.9,10,12 Earlier controllers were
on/off timers or pressure switches that needed frequent adjustment to deal with operating-condi-
tion changes such as line pressures, plunger wear, variable production rates, and system upsets.
This  frustrated  many  operators  and  caused  failures,  and  thus  limited  plunger  use.  New  con-
trollers  contain  computers  that  can  sense  plunger  problems  and  make  immediate  adjustments.
Techniques with telemetry, electronic data collection, and troubleshooting software continue to
improve plunger-lift performance and ease of use.12

Traditionally, plunger lift was used on oil wells—as the wells started to load or as a means
of  gas  lift  assist—and  many  early  articles  discussed  optimization  of  liquid  production.8,14–16
Plunger lift lately has become more common on gas wells, and papers from the 1980s onward
have focused on this aspect.2–7,9,17

In the 1980s, several studies were conducted in the field and on test wells to verify 1950s
and 1960s models and to better understand plunger operation. Morrow and Rogers,9 Mower et
al.,13  Lea,18  and  Rosina19  (among  others)  presented  papers  that  verified  and  modified  earlier
models presented by Beeson et al.14 and Foss and Gaul.16 Importantly, for example, these stud-
ies  clarified  the  relationship  between  plunger  seal  and  velocity,  indicating  that  a  plunger  that
more  completely  seals  against  the  tubing  and  travels  at  the  proper  ascent  velocity  minimizes
gas  slippage  around  the  plunger.  Reducing  gas  slippage  allows  the  well  to  operate  more  effi-
ciently  at  lower  bottomhole  pressures,  which  in  turn  increases  production.  The  studies  also
found  that  efficient  ascent  velocities  for  various  plungers  range  from  500  to  1,000  ft/min.
These velocity data have been used successfully to improve methods for controlling and opti-
mizing plunger-lift cycles and to produce highly efficient plungers.

These improvements have enabled plunger lift to be used for a broader range of well types
and  conditions,  allowing  its  application  even  in  extremely  low-pressure  wells  (<  100  psia),
wells with high liquid production (> 100 B/D), deep wells (16,000+ ft), slimhole wells (2⅞- to
3½-in. casing), and wells with packers. Operators have successfully used plunger lift in paraf-
fin-, scale-, sand-, and hydrate-production environments.

Success in plunger lift systems depends on proper candidate identification, proper well in-
stallation,  and  the  effectiveness  of  the  operator.  Candidate  identification  primarily  consists  of
choosing  a  well  with  the  proper  GLR  and  adequate  well-buildup  pressure;  however,  makeup
gas or compression can be used to amend unmet GLR and buildup-pressure requirements.

Proper  well  installation  is  important.  A  plunger  must  travel  freely  from  the  bottom  of  the
well to the top and back to the bottom, carry well liquids, and produce gas with minimal restric-
tion. Problems with tubing, the wellhead, or well configuration can cause failure.

The  well  operator  must  be  able  to  understand  the  system.  Plunger  lift  can  be  a  difficult
process  to  visualize  because  it  comprises  liquid  and  gas  movement  downhole  during  flowing
and  shut-in  periods.  Operators  must  understand  the  mechanism  for  oil-  and  (especially)  gas-
well  loading,  have  a  basic  understanding  of  inflow  performance,  and  be  able  to  troubleshoot

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

wells on the basis of tubing and casing pressures and flow performance. Even with electronic
controllers,  operators  are  necessary  for  finding  initial  plunger-lift  operating  ranges,  choosing
appropriate plunger types, and performing basic maintenance and troubleshooting. An operator
without these skills will have trouble even with the best plunger-lift candidates.

16.2 Basics/Operation

16.2.1 Purpose of Plunger Lift.  Early in the life of a liquid-producing gas well or high-GLR
oil well, rates and velocities usually are high enough to keep the wellbore clear of liquids (Fig.
16.2). At this point, liquids typically are produced as a mist entrained in the gas stream. The
high turbulence and velocity of these gas rates provides an efficient lifting mechanism for the
liquids and the well produces at steady flow rates.

As  reservoir  pressures  decline  and  flow  rates/velocities  decrease,  the  lifting  mechanism
changes.20  Liquids  no  longer  are  entrained  in  mist  and  begin  to  coalesce  on  the  walls  of  the
production tubing. The liquids still might move up and out of the well, but somewhat less-effi-
ciently than in mist form.

As  gas  rates  and  velocities  continue  to  drop,  the  effect  of  gravity  on  the  liquids  becomes
more  apparent.  Liquids  on  the  tubing  walls  that  were  moving  upward  begin  to  stall,  and  gas
slips through the center of the liquid. When enough liquids stall, liquid “slugs” are formed that
inhibit  gas  flow.  The  well  begins  a  cyclic  process  of  unloading  liquids  that  commonly  is  re-
ferred to as “heading” or “slugging.” Liquid collects on the tubing walls, increases hydrostatic
backpressure, restricts gas flow, and further decreases gas velocity.

In a short period of time, the reservoir might build sufficient gas pressure under the liquid
slugs  to  overcome  the  hydrostatic  pressure  and  force  the  slug  back  up  the  tubing.  This  gas
expands,  partially  carrying  liquid,  partially  slipping  through  the  liquid.  Much  of  the  liquid  is
carried out of the wellbore, and the well flows at higher rates because of a decrease in hydro-
static  pressures.  Eventually,  the  liquid  left  behind  in  the  tubing  and  the  new  liquid  from  the
reservoir form slugs, and the process repeats (Fig. 16.3).

Whereas mist flow is an efficient method of removing wellbore liquids, severe heading is
not.  The  reason  for  this  inefficiency  is  that  gas  tends  to  flow  through  liquids  rather  than  to
push  them  up  and  out  of  the  wellbore,  especially  at  low  velocities.  In  intermittent  gas  lift,  a
rule of thumb is that 5 to 7% of the liquid load is left behind for every 1,000 ft of depth. In a

IV-842

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Fig. 16.3—Cycle to liquid loading. (Modified from Phillips and Listiak.10) This cycle can occur over hours
or days in wells that have stabilized flow rates below the critical unloading rate. Such is the behavior of
many wells that are temporarily shut in or blown to atmosphere to unload liquids.

10,000-ft  well,  that  can  be  70%  of  the  liquid  load!  This  fallback  exerts  hydrostatic  backpres-
sure on the reservoir, restricting gas production.

Left alone, heading can occur for weeks or possibly several months, depending on reservoir
permeability,  reservoir  pressure,  and  liquid  inflow.  Eventually,  a  well  will  cease  heading  and
stop  producing  liquids  (or  most  liquids)  altogether.  The  well  sometimes  will  continue  to  pro-
duce at low flow rates, or it might stop flowing completely (known as “loaded,” “logged-off,”
or “dead”). At this point, the liquids are not moving out of the well, and any production gas
merely is bubbling through a static liquid column.

According  to  the  Turner  et  al.1  critical-flow-rate  correlation  (Fig.  16.4),  a  well  that  pro-
duces  gas  and  water  in  2⅜-in.  [1.995-in.  inner  diameter  (ID)]  tubing  to  a  100-psia  surface
pressure requires approximately a 320 Mscf/D flow rate to prevent fallback and unload liquids.
Below  this  rate,  liquid  fallback  will  occur  and  liquids  will  not  be  removed  adequately.  The
same well with a reservoir pressure of 500 psia only requires a water column of 800 to 1,000
ft to shut off flow completely. That hydrostatic pressure is equivalent to < 4 bbl of water in 2⅜-
in.  tubing!  So,  below  critical  flow  rates,  a  very  small  amount  of  liquid  can  limit  production
severely.

When  using  plunger  lift,  however,  unloading  relies  less  on  critical  flow  rates  and  much
more on the well’s ability to store sufficient gas pressure to lift the plunger and a liquid slug
to surface. The piston-like interface the plunger provides between liquid and the gas acts as a
seal between the two, preventing fallback and allowing the well’s energy to build up sufficient-
ly to lift liquids out of the wellbore. Thus, liquids can be removed efficiently, even when gas
velocity is very low.

16.2.2 Plunger-Lift Operation and Cycles.  In its simplest form, plunger operation consists of
shut-in and flow periods. The flow periods are divided into periods of unloading and flow after
plunger arrival. The lengths of these periods vary with application, producing capability of the
well,  and  pressures.  In  specialized  cases  that  use  plungers  that  can  fall  against  flow,  there
might not be a shut-in period; however, most wells require some shut-in, which is the basis of
the discussion below.

A plunger cycle starts with the shut-in period that allows the plunger to drop from the sur-
face to the bottom of the well (Fig. 16.5). At the same time, the well builds gas pressure that

Fig. 16.5—Plunger-lift cycles. (Modified from Phillips and Listiak.10)

is  stored  in  either  the  casing,  the  fracture,  or  the  near-wellbore  region  of  the  reservoir.  The
well must be shut in long enough to build sufficient reservoir pressure to provide energy to lift
both  the  plunger  and  liquid  slug  to  the  surface  against  line  pressure  and  friction.  When  this
pressure has been reached, the flow period is started and unloading begins.

In  the  initial  stages  of  the  flow  period,  the  plunger  and  liquid  slug  begin  traveling  to  the
surface.  Gas  above  the  plunger  quickly  flows  from  the  tubing  into  the  flowline,  and  the
plunger  and  liquid  slug  follow  up  the  hole.  The  plunger  arrives  at  the  surface,  unloading  the

liquid.  Initially,  high  rates  prevail  (often  three  to  four  times  the  average  daily  rate)  while  the
stored pressure is blown down. The well now can produce free of liquids, while the plunger is
held at the surface by the well’s pressure and flow. As rates drop, so do velocities. Eventually,
velocities drop below the critical rate, and liquids begin to accumulate in the tubing. The well
is shut in, and the plunger falls back to bottom to repeat the cycle.

There  are  many  common  names  for  these  periods.  Shut-in  also  is  known  as  a  “closed,”
“off,” or “buildup” period. The time during which the plunger travels up the hole also is called
an “open,” “on,” “unloading,” or “flow” period. The flow period after the plunger reaches the
surface  is  known  variously  as  an  “open,”  “on,”  “flow,”  “afterflow,”  “blowdown,”  or  “sales”
period.

16.2.3 Pressure  Response  During  Plunger  Cycles.    The  pressure  response  of  a  well  on
plunger lift helps explain the plunger lift cycles. Figs. 16.6 and 16.7 and the discussion below
describe a typical pressure response for a well with tubing and no packer and for which sur-
face  tubing  and  casing  pressures  can  be  measured.  Fig.  16.6  shows  three  pressures—casing,
tubing,  and  line—and  the  instantaneous  flow  rate  of  a  well  during  a  plunger  cycle.  Fig.  16.7
shows the same pressures and rate over a period of several days.

By  the  end  of  the  shut-in  period,  the  well  has  built  up  to  the  maximum  casing  pressure,
and to a tubing pressure that is lower than the casing pressure. The difference between these is
equivalent to the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid in the tubing.

When the well is opened, the tubing pressure quickly drops to line pressure while the cas-
ing  pressure  slowly  decreases  until  the  plunger  reaches  the  surface.  As  the  plunger  nears  the
surface, the liquid on top of the plunger might surge through the system, causing spikes in line
pressure and flow rate. This continues until the plunger reaches the surface. After the plunger
surfaces, a large increase in flow rate will produce higher tubing pressures and an increase in
flowline  pressure.  Tubing  pressure  then  will  drop  to  very  near  line  pressure.  Casing  pressure

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

will reach its minimum either upon plunger arrival, or afterward while the casing blows down
and  the  well  produces  with  minimal  liquids  in  the  tubing.  If  the  well  stays  above  the  critical
unloading  rate,  casing  pressure  will  remain  fairly  constant  or  might  decrease  further.  As  the
gas rate drops, liquids become held up in the tubing and casing pressure increases.

Upon shut-in, the casing pressure builds more rapidly. How quickly depends on the inflow
performance and reservoir pressure of the well. As the flowing gas friction ceases, the tubing
pressure will increase quickly from line pressure and eventually will track casing pressure (mi-
nus the liquid slug). Casing pressure will continue to increase toward maximum pressure until
the well is opened again.

16.2.4 Obtaining Maximum Production on Plunger Lift.  In a well with plunger lift, as with
most  wells,  maximum  production  occurs  when  the  well  produces  against  the  lowest  possible
bottomhole pressure. On plunger lift, the lowest average bottomhole pressure almost always is
obtained by shutting in the well for the minimum time.8–10 However, practical experience and
plunger-lift models show that lifting large liquid slugs requires higher average bottomhole pres-
sure, however, so the goal of plunger lift should be to shut in the well for the minimum time
period and to produce only as much liquids as can be lifted at this minimum buildup pressure
(Fig. 16.8).

The absolute minimum shut-in time, regardless of other operating conditions, is the time it
takes the plunger to reach bottom. (The exception to this rule is specialized plungers that fall
while the well is flowing.) Plungers typically fall 200 to 1,000 ft/min in dry gas, and 20 to 250
ft/min in liquids.13,16,23 Total fall time depends on plunger type, amount of liquid in the tubing,
the  condition  of  the  tubing  (e.g.,  crimped,  corkscrewed,  corroded),  and  the  deviation  of  the
tubing or wellbore.

The  length  of  the  flow  period  during  and  after  plunger  arrival  is  used  to  control  liquid
loads.  In  general, a  short  flow  period  brings  in  a  smaller liquid load,  and  a  long  flow  period
brings in a larger liquid load, so that the well can be flowed until the desired liquid load has
entered  the  tubing.  A  well  with  a  high  GLR  might  be  capable  of  long  flow  periods  without

requiring more than minimum shut-in times. In such case, the plunger could operate as few as
one  or  two  cycles  per  day.  Conversely,  a  well  with  a  low  GLR  might  never  be  able  to  flow
after  plunger  arrival,  and  might  require  25  or  more  cycles  per  day.  In  practice,  if  the  well  is
shutting  in  for  only  the  minimum  amount  of  time,  it  can  be  flowed  as  long  as  possible  to
maintain target plunger rise velocities. If the well is shutting in for longer than the minimum
time, there should be little or no flow after the plunger arrives at the surface.

16.3 Applications
Plungers currently are being used in many countries. Applications include wells with depths of
1,000 to 16,000 ft, producing bottomhole pressures of 50 to > 1,500 psia, and liquid rates of
1  to  >  100  B/D.  These  are  common  ranges  of  application,  but  not  necessarily  limits  of
operation.2,3,8,17,24

The  most  common  plunger-lift  applications  are  for  liquid  removal  in  gas  wells,  but
plungers  also  are  used  successfully  for  oil  production  in  high-GLR  oil  wells,  in  conjunction
with intermittent gas lift operations,24–27 and to control paraffin and hydrates. In fact, plungers
have  been  installed  on  wells  for  the  sole  purpose  of  preventing  paraffin  or  hydrate  buildup,
thereby reducing paraffin scraping or methanol injection.2,3,17

For this use, when plunger lift is installed, paraffin, hydrates, and salt should be removed
so  that  the  plunger  will  travel  freely  up  and  down  the  tubing.  Given  initially  clean  tubing,  a
plunger  excels at  preventing formation of  such  deposits  because  of  the  scraping  action of  the
plunger against the walls of the tubing, along with slugs of warm reservoir fluids.

Wellbore  configurations  for  plunger  lift  include  wells  with  an  open  annulus  (most  desir-
able),  wells  with  packers,  slimhole  wells  (2.875-in.  and  3.5-in.  casing),  deviated  wells,  wells
with  coiled  tubing,  and  wells  with  no  tubing  (casing  plungers).  Also,  plunger  lift  is  used  in
conjunction  with  intermittent  gas  lift,  external  gas  supplies/injection,  wellhead  compression,
vent options to tanks or low-pressure systems, some sand production, tubing/casing flow con-
trol (three-valve controllers), and carbon dioxide (CO2) floods.17,25–27

16.3.1 Typical Plunger Installation: Tubing With Open Annulus.  Most  commonly,  plunger
lift is applied in a gas or oil well with sufficient pressure and GLR to operate the system with-

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

IV-847

out additional supply gas. It is desirable to have tubing with no packer in the well. The annular
space provides a storage area (volume chamber) for the gas under pressure and allows this gas
to work freely on the plunger and liquid slug. Gas can flow from the casing to the tubing and
provide lift with little restriction, and inflow from the reservoir is not relied on as the plunger
moves up the hole. Because the stored-gas pressure provides the means to lift the plunger and
liquid slug, adequate GLR and well pressures are critical.

16.3.2 Packers and Slimhole Completions.  Some success has been experienced with plunger
lift  in  gas  wells  with  packers  and  slimhole  completions.  These  installations  are  more  difficult
than those in a well with tubing and an adequate open annulus and will require higher bottom-
hole pressure and GLR. Because an annular volume is not available, gas must be stored in the
near-wellbore  region  or  in  a  natural  or  hydraulic  fracture.  The  near-wellbore  region  must  be
large enough to store the volume necessary to operate the plunger and must be able to deliver
that volume with minimal restriction or loss of energy through the reservoir and perforations.
In addition, plunger-controller options that use the casing pressure cannot be used.

In  some  instances,  production  in  wells  with  packers  can  be  improved  by  shooting  several
holes  in  the  tubing  and  allowing  communication  between  the  tubing  and  casing.  In  this  man-
ner, the casing annulus can be used, but because packers may be set high above the producing
interval, wells may see increased hydrostatic backpressure in the loaded portion of the casing
below  the  packer.  In  addition,  scale  and  debris  might  easily  plug  the  perforated  holes.  It  is
important to shoot enough holes to provide adequate flow area from the casing to the tubing.

Some  slimhole  wells  have  been  equipped  with  small  tubing  in  an  attempt  to  gain  annular
volume. This may or may not provide improved plunger performance, depending on the annu-
lar volume obtained and the reduced hydraulic efficiency of plunger lifting in smaller tubing.

16.3.3 Deviated Wells.  Theoretically, plunger lift can be run successfully in wellbores up to a
60° deviation. Several installations exist in 20° deviations. Because the plunger is small, it can
handle some dogleg severity, but in this type of installation, be especially aware of plunger fall
times.  The  greater  the  deviation,  the  more  slowly  the  plunger  falls  and  the  longer  it  takes  to
get  to  the  bottom.  Fall  times  in  deviated  wells  can  be  measured  with  slickline,  by  acoustic
measurement,  or  by  examining  well  production  characteristics  with  various  minimum  shut-in
times. Excessive fall times can reduce or prevent plunger-lift production.

16.3.4 Coiled Tubing.  Nontapered  coiled  tubing  can  be  plunger  lifted.  Larger  coiled-tubing
strings  are  very  applicable  to  plunger  lift,  especially  when  the  flash  is  removed.  Flash  on
coiled tubing is a byproduct of welding during the manufacturing process. It is a thin bead of
material  that  runs  the  inside  length  of  the  coiled  tubing  at  the  weld  seam  and  upsets  the
smooth, continuous ID of the tubing. Plungers cannot seal against flash (except for some spe-
cial brush plungers). The flash can be removed during manufacturing, but this must be specified.
Special  plungers  have  been  made  for  coiled  tubing.28  A  flexible  brush  plunger  has  been
designed to help curve around potential bends in coiled tubing at the bottom of the well; how-
ever, small coiled tubing (as with any small tubing) has tubing hydraulic problems that make
plunger  lift  difficult.  Smaller  tubing  requires  much  more  pressure  to  lift  the  same  volume  of
liquids, has larger pressure losses because of gas friction, and creates more backpressure on the
formation. In addition, small-plunger equipment is less durable and might fail frequently.

16.3.5 Casing Plungers.  Casing plungers act more like true pistons. The casing plunger has a
synthetic sealing element that forms a seal against the walls of the casing and eliminates gas or
liquid  slippage.  The  well  must  only  overcome  the  weight  of  the  plunger,  the  liquid  slug,  and
friction of the seal against the casing. Because large casing diameters are used (mostly 4.5-in.
or greater), wellbore hydrostatics work in favor of this method. Larger slugs can be lifted with

IV-848

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

a lower pressure requirement. When the casing plunger reaches the surface, an internal bypass
is opened to allow the plunger to fall against flow. This method has been used successfully in
some areas of the U.S.A. (e.g., Ohio and Pennsylvania). Plunger sticking might occur in casing
with varying weights and IDs, with poor casing integrity or condition, and with the reaction of
some sealing elements to produced fluids (e.g., CO2, condensate).

16.3.6 Intermittent Gas Lift.  Plungers work well with intermittent gas lift by reducing liquid
fallback. The same amount of liquid then can be lifted with less gas volume and pressure, and
wells  can  be  lifted  from  greater  depths.  Long  plungers  with  seals  at  both  ends  might  be  re-
quired to maintain plunger seal across gas lift mandrels.24–27

16.3.7 External Gas Supplies.  Using makeup gas with plunger lift will increase the range of
operation.  A  compressor  or  gas  lift  system  can  be  used  to  supply  external  gas  pressure  and
volume.  This  allows  plungers  to  work  at  much  lower  pressures  and  GLRs.  Injection-gas  sys-
tems have been installed successfully to convert pumping fields to plunger lift with gas assist.
Operators have used this technique to reduce costs caused by pumping failures and difficulty in
pumping high-GLR oil wells.24–27

16.3.8 Wellhead  Compression.    It  is  not  always  possible  to  install  centralized  compression,
and a single wellhead compressor might be necessary for production. Even with a compressor,
wells still might experience liquid loading. To alleviate this problem, a plunger system can be
installed  in  conjunction  with  wellhead  compression.  When  using  an  electric  compressor,  the
plunger controller can be used to control the compressor. During the shut-in period, the com-
pressor is turned off. During the unloading and flow periods, the compressor is turned on.29

For a gas-engine-driven compressor, the installation is somewhat more difficult. A gas com-
pressor cannot easily be automated to start and stop, so it is desirable to keep the gas engine
running  during  both  the  flowing  and  shut-in  periods.  When  flowing,  the  compressor  simply
sends gas to the sales pipeline. For shut-in periods, a bypass can be installed on the compres-
sor  that  allows  gas  to  circulate.  The  controller  that  operates  the  motor  valve  can  be  used  to
control  an  additional  sales/bypass  valve.  To  avoid  potential  problems  with  this  setup,  such  as
overheating  of  the  circulating  gas  or  insufficient  supply  gas  to  keep  the  compressor  running,
shut in the well for the minimum amount of time necessary to operate the plunger. Other possi-
ble  solutions  are  to  use  a  plunger  with  a  bypass  that  can  travel  to  bottom  while  the  well  is
flowing, which reduces or eliminates shut-in; to provide an outside source of supply gas; and
to improve the cooling capacity of the compressor.

16.3.9 Vent Options to Tanks or Low-Pressure Systems.  Lower-pressure  wells  that  do  not
meet  plunger-lift  pressure  requirements  at  current  line  pressures  might  be  able  to  operate  if
temporary vent or low-pressure cycles are used. Such a well can be set up to flow to a lower
pressure  while  the  plunger  is  ascending  with  the  liquid  load.  Once  unloaded,  the  well  can  be
switched into the sales line until loading begins again.

Venting  also  is  effective  where  gathering  systems  have  large  swings  in  line  pressures.
When  line  pressures  increase  erratically,  the  well  can  vent  automatically  to  keep  the  plunger
operating  and  to  keep  the  well  from  loading  and  dying.  If  a  well  is  vented  correctly,  only  a
small portion of the gas above the plunger will be lost to the atmosphere.

Before considering venting, however, take a few important precautions. First, use an auto-
mated controller that continually attempts to minimize and eliminate venting. Second, evaluate
where  the  vented  gas  will  flow.  Venting  to  the  atmosphere  is  the  simplest  option,  albeit  the
least desirable one because it involves environmental-impact, government regulatory, and safety
considerations. For example, if the surface equipment malfunctions, will liquids be discharged?
If poisonous gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are present, venting directly to atmosphere

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

IV-849

can create additional safety hazards. Open atmospheric discharges might not be allowed in cer-
tain areas.

Vent tanks can be used to ensure that system upsets do not cause liquid spills. A combina-
tion  high-/low-pressure  separator  is  an  option  that  will  catch  fluids  and  reduce  venting  pres-
sures  before  sending  vented  gases  to  a  tank;  however,  using  vent  tanks  has  drawbacks.  For
example,  if  downcomers  or  downspouts  are  used,  rapid  gas  entry  might  cause  liquid  to  be
blown out of the tank hatch. Also, a vent line that is improperly piped into the tank can gener-
ate  static  electricity.  Furthermore,  if  the  thief  hatch  is  blown  open,  oxygen  might  enter  the
tank, increasing the chances of reaching explosive mixtures in the tank.

The  best  venting  option  is  to  use  a  lower-pressure  gathering  system,  or  possibly  a  vapor-
recovery  system  with  a  vent  tank;  however,  if  a  low-pressure  system  is  available  and  has
sufficient capacity, producing to that system would be preferable over venting to it.

Plungers installed in marginal applications require more venting by design. When this is the
case,  consider  alternate  applications  or  artificial-lift  methods.  Possible  alternatives  to  venting
are to assist the plunger with injected gas down the casing or down a parallel tubing string.25,26

16.3.10 Some Sand Production.  Wells that produce some sand can operate with plunger lift.
Selecting  a  plunger  with  a  brush-type  seal,  or  a  loose-fitting  plunger  with  a  poorer  seal  will
allow  sand  production  and  help  prevent  the  plunger  from  sticking  in  the  tubing.  An  effective
technique is to use a brush plunger that has a standard bristle outer diameter and smaller (down-
turned)  metal  ends.  Installing  sand  traps  at  the  surface  or  using  sand-friendly  seats  on  motor
valves  can  prevent  sand  damage  to  seats  and  trims  that  would  prevent  the  motor  valve  from
closing. With sand, plungers also are prone to getting stuck in the lubricator and require clean-
ing at the surface. Some wells might require periodic downhole cleanouts.

Good  plunger  operation  can  reduce  sand  production  relative  to  poor  plunger  operation.
Short shut-in periods reduce pressure buildups, which leads to more consistent production and
less-intense production surges.  In  some  wells,  sand  production decreases  with  time; in  others,
continued sand production might make plunger lift impossible or uneconomical.

16.3.11 Tubing and Casing Flow.  In some plunger-lift applications, casing-annulus flow im-
proves  production.  If  pressures  and  flow  rates  are  such  that  the  gas  friction  in  the  tubing
chokes the well, casing flow might be beneficial.30 This is the case for many low-pressure, high-
permeability gas wells. The cycle is like a standard plunger-lift cycle (Fig. 16.9), but with two
additional  periods.  After  the  shut-in  and  unloading  periods,  the  casing  annulus  is  opened  to
flow. Before shutting in the well again, the casing annulus is closed and the tubing left open to
allow accumulated liquids in the casing to be transferred to the tubing.

Take care that the casing flow does not cause the tubing to cease flowing. Place a pressure-
differential  device  or  other  type  of  choke  on  the  casing  outlet  to  keep  sufficient  flow  up  the
tubing.  If  the  tubing  stops  flowing,  the  plunger  will  drop,  but  probably  will  not  reach  the
plunger  stop  by  the  time  the  casing  purge  cycle  begins.  Even  if  it  does  reach  the  stop,  there
might  not  be  enough  energy  for  the  plunger  to  lift  any  liquid  to  the  surface.  Either  way,  the
well eventually will load up.

This  type  of  system  is  more  difficult  to  operate  than  standard  plunger  installations.  Their
operation  will  benefit  from  knowledgeable  operators  and  automatically  adjusting  plunger  con-
trollers.

16.3.12 CO2 Floods.  Any gas can be used as the motivating force in plunger operations, even
CO2.  When  CO2  breakthrough  occurs  in  a  CO2  flood,  GLRs  might  increase  substantially,
which  leads  to  pumping  problems  and  possible  well-control  problems.  When  the  GLR  meets
the  minimum  requirement,  plunger  lifting  wells  might  alleviate  some  of  these  problems  and
help reduce field pumping costs.17

16.3.13 Other Methods.  Development and testing of new and improved plunger-lift methods
is  ongoing.  Variations  of  the  applications  discussed  above,  as  well  as  combinations  of  these
plunger-lift techniques with other concepts and methods of artificial lift, continue to transform
plunger-lift capabilities and to expand the limits and applications for this technology.

16.4 Design and Models
Plunger-lift  systems  can  be  evaluated  using  rules  of  thumb  in  conjunction  with  historic  well
production,  or  with  a  mathematical  plunger  model.  Because  plunger-lift  systems  typically  are
inexpensive and easy to install and test, most are evaluated by rules of thumb.

16.4.1 GLR and Buildup Pressure Requirements.  The two minimum requirements for plunger-
lift  operation  are  minimum  GLR  and  well  buildup  pressure.  Plunger-lift  operation  requires
available gas to provide the lifting force, in sufficient quantity per barrel of liquid for a given
well depth. The minimum GLR requirement is approximately 400 scf/bbl per 1,000 ft of well
depth and is based on the energy stored in a compressed volume of 400 scf of gas expanding
under  the  hydrostatic  head  of  1  bbl  of  liquid.3  One  drawback  to  this  rule  of  thumb  is  that  it
does  not  consider  line  pressures.  Excessively  high  line  pressures  relative  to  buildup  pressure
might increase the requirement. The rule of thumb also assumes that the gas expansion can be
applied from a large open annulus without restriction, but slimhole wells and wells with pack-
ers that require gas to travel through the reservoir or through small perforations in the tubing
will cause a greater restriction and energy loss, which increase the minimum GLR requirement
to as much as 800 to 1,200 scf/bbl per 1,000 ft.

Well  buildup  pressure  is  the  bottomhole  pressure  just  before  the  plunger  begins  its  ascent
(equivalent  to  surface  casing  pressure  in  a  well  with  an  open  annulus).  In  practice,  the  mini-
mum  shut-in  pressure  requirement  for  plunger  lift  is  equivalent  to  one  and  a  half  times  the
maximum  sales-line  pressure,  although  the  actual  requirement  might  be  higher.  This  rule  of
thumb works well in intermediate-depth wells (2,000 to 8,000 ft) with slug sizes of 0.1 to 0.5
bbl/cycle. It does not apply reliably, however, to higher liquid volumes, deeper wells (because
of increasing friction), and excessive pressure restrictions at the surface or in the wellbore.

An  improved  rule  of  thumb  for  minimum  pressure  is  that  a  well  can  lift  a  slug  of  liquid
when  the  slug  hydrostatic  pressure  (phs)  equals  50  to  60%  of  the  difference  between  shut-in
casing pressure (pcs) and maximum sales-line pressure:

or

pcs =

phs

(0.5 to 0.6)

+ (pl)max . .............................................. (16.1b)

This rule of thumb accounts for liquid production, can be used for wells with higher liquid
production that require slug sizes of more than 1 to 2 bbl/cycle, and is regarded as a conserva-
tive  estimate  of  minimum  pressure  requirements.  To  use  Eqs.  16.1a  and  16.1b,  first  estimate
the total liquid production on plunger lift and number of cycles possible per day. Then, deter-
mine the amount of liquid that can be lifted per cycle. Use the well tubing size to convert that
volume of liquid per cycle into the slug hydrostatic pressure, and use the equations to estimate
required casing pressure to operate the system (see example below).

A well that does not meet minimum GLR and pressure requirements still could be plunger
lifted with the addition of an external gas source. At this point, design becomes more a matter
of the economics of providing the added gas to the well at desired pressures. Several papers in
the literature discuss adding makeup gas to a plunger installation through existing gas lift oper-
ations, installing a field gas supply system, or using wellhead compression.11,14,16,24–27,29

16.4.2 Estimating  Production  Rates  With  Plunger  Lift.    The  simplest  and  sometimes  most
accurate  method  of  determining  production  increases  from  plunger  lift  is  decline-curve  analy-
sis3 (Fig. 16.10). Gas and oil reservoirs typically have predictable declines, either exponential
or hyperbolic. Initial production rates usually are high enough to produce the well above criti-
cal  rates  (unloaded)  and  establish  a  decline  curve.  When  liquid  loading  occurs,  a  marked
decrease and deviation from normal decline can be seen. Unloading the well with plunger lift
can  re-establish  a  normal  decline.  Production  increases  from  plunger  lift  will  be  somewhere
between the rates of the well when it started loading and the rate of an extended decline curve
to the present time. Ideally, decline curves would be used with critical-velocity curves to prede-
termine  when  plunger  lift  should  be  installed.  This  would  enable  plunger  lift  to  maintain
production on a steady decline and to never allow the well to begin loading.

shows production increase resulting from reducing liquid hydrostatic pressure with a plunger-lift system.
(IPR after Vogel21 and Mishra and Caudle.22)

Another method for estimating production is to build an inflow performance (IP) curve on
the basis of the backpressure equation (Fig. 16.11).4,10,21,22 This is especially helpful if the well
has  an  open  annulus  and  is  flowing  up  the  tubing,  and  if  the  casing  pressure  is  known.  The
casing  pressure  closely  approximates  bottomhole  pressure.  Build  the  IP  curve  on  the  basis  of
estimated  reservoir  pressure,  casing  pressure,  and  current  flow  rate.  Because  the  job  of  the
plunger  lift  is  to  lower  the  bottomhole  pressure  by  removing  liquids,  estimate  the  bottomhole
pressure with no liquids. Use this new pressure to estimate a production rate with lower bottom-
hole pressures.

16.4.3 Models.    Plunger-lift  models  are  based  on  the  sum  of  forces  acting  on  the  plunger
while  it  lifts  a  liquid  slug  up  the  tubing  (Fig.  16.12).  These  forces  at  any  given  point  in  the
tubing are:

• Stored casing pressure freely acting on the cross section of the plunger.
• Stored reservoir pressure acting on the cross section of the plunger, based on inflow per-

formance.

• The weight of the fluid.
• The weight of the plunger.
• The friction of the fluid with the tubing.
• The friction of the plunger with the tubing.
• Gas friction in the tubing.
• Gas slippage upward past the plunger.
• Liquid slippage downward past the plunger.
• Surface pressure (line pressure and restrictions) acting against the plunger travel.
Several publications have dealt with this approach. Beeson et al.14 first presented equations
for high-GLR wells in 1955, on the basis of an empirically derived analysis. Foss and Gaul16
derived  a  force-balance  equation  for  use  on  oil  wells  in  the  Ventura  Avenue  field  in  1965.
Lea18 presented a dynamic analysis of plunger lift that added gas slippage and reservoir inflow,
and mathematically described the entire cycle (not just plunger ascent) for tight-gas/very high-
GLR wells.

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

IV-853

Fig. 16.12—Plunger force balance. (Based on Lea.18)

Foss  and  Gaul’s  methodology16  was  to  calculate  (pc)min,  the  casing  pressure  required  to
move  the  plunger  and  liquid  slug  just  before  it  reaches  the  surface.  Because  (pc)min  is  at  the
end of the plunger cycle, the energy of the expanding gas from the casing to the tubing is at
its minimum. Adjusting (pc)min for gas expansion from the casing to the tubing during the full
plunger  cycle  yields  (pc)max,  the  pressure  required  to  start  the  plunger  at  the  beginning  of  the
plunger cycle. The pressure must build to (pc)max to operate successfully.

The average casing pressure  pc, maximum cycles Cmax, and gas required per cycle (Vg) can
be  calculated  from  (pc)min  and  (pc)max.  The  equations  below  are  essentially  those  presented  by
Foss and Gaul16 but are summarized here as presented by Mower et al.13 The Foss and Gaul
model  is  not  rigorous—it  assumes  constant  friction  associated  with  plunger  rise  velocities  of
1,000  ft/min;  does  not  calculate  reservoir  inflow;  assumes  a  value  for  gas  slippage  past  the
plunger; assumes an open, unrestricted annulus; and assumes that the user can determine unload-
ed  gas  and  liquid  rates  independently  of  the  model.  Also,  because  this  model  originally  was
designed for oilwell operation that assumed the well would be shut in upon plunger arrival,  pc
is only an average during plunger travel. The net result of these assumptions is an overpredic-
tion  of  required  casing  pressure.  If  a  well  meets  the  Foss  and  Gaul  criteria,  it  is  almost
certainly a candidate for plunger lift. For a full description of the Foss and Gaul model and for
a description of improved models, see the references.4,13,16,19,31

where  qg  is  given  in  scf.  The  well  GLR  is  >400  scf/bbl  per  1,000  ft  and  is  adequate  for
plunger lift.

Example of Rule of Thumb for Casing Pressure Requirement to Plunger Lift (Simple).  The

rule of thumb for calculating the minimum shut-in casing pressure for plunger lift, in psia, is:
pcs = 1.5(pl)max .......................................................... (16.13)
pcs = 1.5(100) = 150.

With  800  psia  of  available  casing  pressure,  the  well  meets  the  pressure  requirements  for
plunger lift; however, this is the absolute minimum pressure required for low liquid volumes,
intermediate well depths, and low line pressures.

Example of Rule of Thumb for Casing Pressure Requirement (Improved).   For  this  case,
assume 10 cycles/day, equivalent to a plunger trip every 2.4 hours. Any reasonable number of
cycles can be assumed to calculate pressures.

At 10 cycles/day and 10 bbl of liquid, the plunger will lift 1 bbl/cycle. The slug hydrostatic
pressure (phs) of 1 bbl of liquid in 2⅜-in. tubing with a 0.45-psi/ft liquid gradient is approxi-
mately 120 psia. Using Eq. 16.1b, the required casing pressure, in psia, is calculated as:

It  was  given  that  the  estimated  production  when  unloaded  is  200  Mscf/D  with  10  B/D  of
liquid (GLR = 200/10 = 20 Mscf/bbl), and that the available casing pressure (or the pressure to
which the casing will build between plunger cycles) is 800 psia. The available casing pressure,
pc,  is  equivalent  to  the  calculated  (pc)max—or  the  pressure  required  to  lift  the  assumed  slug
sizes. The well GLR is equivalent to the calculated required GLR. The maximum liquid produc-
tion is a product of the slug size (S) and the maximum cycles per day (Cmax). Importantly, Cmax
is  not  a  required  number  of  plunger  trips,  but  rather  the  maximum  possible  on  the  basis  of
plunger  velocities.  In  reality,  most  wells  operate  below  Cmax  because  well  shut-in  time  is  re-
quired to build any casing pressure. In Table 16.3, note that the casing pressure (pc)max of 810
psia, the GLR of 20 Mscf/bbl, and the production rate of 10 B/D occur at slug sizes between
0.1 and 2.5 bbl. The well will operate on plunger lift.

16.6 Equipment Installation and Maintenance
A plunger lift candidate must meet GLR and pressure requirements, but the method of installa-
tion  and  the  mechanical  setup  of  the  well  also  are  extremely  important.  Installation  is  a
frequent cause of system failure.10 The following are key elements in the proper installation of
a plunger system:

• Equipment quality and metallurgy.
• Evaluation of current and possible wellbore configurations.
• Tubing and wellbore preparation.
• Evaluation and installation of the downhole plunger equipment.
• Evaluation and installation of wellhead and plunger surface equipment.
• Design considerations and selection of a plunger.
• Evaluation of control methods.
• Evaluation and modification of production facilities.
For reference, Fig. 16.13 is a full wellbore schematic of major plunger-lift components, and

Fig. 16.14 is a plunger-lift troubleshooting guide.

16.6.1 Equipment  Quality  and  Metallurgy.    There  are  many  plunger-lift  manufacturers  and
equipment  options,  so  quality  and  design  vary.  Neither  American  Petroleum  Inst.  (API)  stan-
dards  nor  those  of  similar  agencies  govern  plunger-equipment  specifications  at  this  time.
Purchasers have the ultimate responsibility for investigating the manufacturing process. Manu-
facturers who use International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9000/9001 standards or
equivalents help to ensure that customers will receive a quality product.

Evaluate  material  used  in  equipment  manufacturing  on  the  basis  of  the  operating  environ-
ment  of  each  specific  application.  Carbon/carbon  steel  can  be  used  in  most  installations;
however, an appropriate grade of stainless steel might be necessary for some or all of the com-
ponents in corrosive environments (e.g., H2S or CO2). Bottomhole temperature is another factor

to consider. The minor ID expansion of tubing in a deeper, hotter well might affect the choice
of material, as well as type of equipment. Some fiber and plastic materials used in brush and
pad plungers have a maximum operating temperature.

16.6.2 Evaluation of Current and Possible Wellbore Configurations.  The two typical instal-
lation  scenarios  are  those  in  which  existing  wellbore  configurations  are  used  and  those  in
which the wellbore is reconfigured to take full advantage of the plunger-lift system. Setting the
tubing  at  the  proper  depth  and  with  an  open  annulus  offers  the  greatest  chance  of  success.
Other  installations  can  work,  but  require  sacrifices  in  production  rates  and  longevity.  One  of
the biggest factors affecting plunger-lift success is the forcing of applications into unfavorable
configurations, such as wells with packers (with or without holes shot in tubing for communica-

tion), highly deviated wells (> 20 to 60°), slimhole wells (2⅞-in. and 3½-in. casing), and small
tubing (jointed pipe or coiled tubing smaller than 1¾-in. ID).

Keeping  plunger  lift  in  mind  when  originally  completing  a  well  is  ideal.  If  a  plunger  is
considered to be a potential lift method, then proper tubing, wellhead, and surface piping can
be installed initially, making plunger lift inexpensive and effective.

16.6.3 Tubing and Wellbore Preparation.  Often, plunger-lift installation is attempted in unac-
ceptable  tubing.  Problems  can  arise  from  use  of  tubing  that  is  degraded  or  worn  (trash/fill,
holes, crimps, scale, tight spots, pitting, and/or rod cut), has ID variations (out of place nipples,
oversized or undersized blast joints, and/or mixed strings), is set at the wrong depth (too high
or too low), or is undersized. Review well records to determine whether an acceptable tubing
configuration is in place.

16.6.4 Slickline Tubing-Integrity Checks.  Perform a slickline inspection even if records indi-
cate that the wellbore has an acceptable tubing configuration for plunger installation. Tagging
for fill and gauging the tubing are the minimum requirements for this inspection.

To tag for fill, run a small-OD tool (e.g., a sinker bar or sample basket) out of the end of
the tubing. This ensures that the perforations are not covered and that the end of tubing is not
plugged. At the same time, an end-of-tubing locator can be run to verify tubing depth. This is
more important when well records do not clearly indicate the tubing depth.

Next,  inspect  the  tubing  ID  with  a  gauge  ring  (Fig.  16.15).  There  are  many  varieties  of
gauge  rings.  Typically,  gauge  rings  do  a  good  job  of  finding  the  smallest  ID  of  the  tubing;
however,  they  do  a  poor  job  of  drifting  the  tubing  because  they  usually  are  shorter  than  the
plunger. Longer gauge rings can be built that mirror plunger sizes. Another option is to use the
plunger selected for the specific well to drift the tubing. An even better option is to machine a
hollow gauge ring with the same length and OD dimensions as the chosen plunger. The hollow
gauge ring allows for quicker slickline trips in and out of the hole than does a solid plunger or
solid gauge ring.

If the tubing gauges to the proper ID, plunger-lift equipment can be installed. If not, run a
broach and/or swage to try to clean the tubing of obstructions or to bend the tubing walls out
to the proper ID. A broach is a hardened piece of round steel with grooves, much like a round
file. Broaches often are built in the shape of a swage. They are most effective on light scale
buildup or similar light deposits. Smooth swages often are used when crimped tubing is suspect-

ed. The risk in running broaches and swages is the possibility of their getting stuck. A broach
is more likely than the smooth swage to become stuck in crimped tubing. It might be less risky
to use coiled tubing with a bit or scraper for slimhole or permanent-packer installations, where
a stuck broach might become a permanent obstruction.

16.6.5 Considerations for Changing or Reconfiguring Tubing.  If the current wellbore config-
uration  is  unacceptable,  tubing  may  be  reconfigured  or  a  new  string  of  tubing  may  be  run.
Decisions  on  the  tubing  size,  where  to  land  the  end  of  tubing,  and  whether  to  reuse  tubing
should be weighed.

Used Tubing.  Reusing  tubing  might  be  possible  if  the  tubing  has  good  integrity.  Tubing
that is pitted, rod-cut, or has weak pins is not recommended because it might fail prematurely,
inhibit  plunger  rise  and  fall,  and/or  prevent  an  effective  plunger  seal.  One  solution  is  to  line
the tubing with an insert lining. Lined tubing is an uncommon application, but has very good
sealing and friction characteristics and has been used successfully. Choose a durable lining that
holds up against plunger wear and is designed for well temperatures and fluids.

Tubing Size.  A common misconception is that tubing with larger diameters is more diffi-
cult  to  operate  on  plunger  lift  than  tubing  with  smaller  diameters  (Fig.  16.16).  The  larger
tubing  actually  is  easier  to  operate  because  of  the  increased  cross-sectional  area,  which  has
better  hydraulics.  A  larger  plunger,  like  a  larger  hydraulic  cylinder,  requires  less  pressure  to
move.  Large  tubing  also  holds  more  liquid  per  foot  of  height,  thereby  unloading  larger  vol-
umes  with  a  lower  pressure  requirement.  The  smaller  tubing  requires  higher  pressures  to  lift
the same amount of liquids. Friction also can be more of a problem with smaller tubing.

Plunger-lift systems can be operated in practically any size tubing, with 2 ∕16

1 -in. OD (1¾-in.
ID) or larger being more desirable. There is also a benefit in using “standard” equipment. Be-
cause  of  their  abundance,  2⅜-in.  and  2⅞-in.  external-upset-end  (EUE)  tubing  usually  are  the
sizes of choice.

Tubing Depth.  Evaluate each well for correct placement of the tubing. Place the end of the
tubing  very  near  a  gas  productive  interval,  typically  in  the  middle  to  top  perforations.  Single
pay  zones  with  narrow  perforated  intervals  are  the  easiest  to  correctly  place  tubing.  Multiple
commingled  zones  and/or  large  perforated  intervals  (>  500  ft)  require  additional  analysis  be-
cause  bottomhole  pressure  and  pressure  differentials  between  zones  come  into  play.  Use
reservoir  analysis,  examination  of  well  logs,  and  production  logs  to  estimate  reservoir  quality

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

and to help determine the best spot to land the end of tubing. Often, trial and error ultimately
decide  the  best  tubing  depths,  and  may  take  a  few  attempts  to  get  right,  especially  on  wells
with large perforated intervals and wells with low bottomhole pressures.

The most common setting mistake is to set the tubing too deep (Fig. 16.17). In this case,
gas and liquid must flow below the perforations before entering the tubing. On shut-in, liquids
end up above the plunger in the tubing, and between the plunger and perforations in the cas-
ing. When the well is opened, the plunger rises with liquids above, but the liquid in the casing
enters  the  tubing  behind  the  plunger.  This  additional  liquid  places  increased  backpressure  on
the  well,  is  lifted  inefficiently,  might  prevent  the  plunger  from  surfacing,  and  might  load  up
the well. Even if the plunger operates, the well might still produce at much lower than expect-
ed flow rates. Tubing that is set too deep can either be raised or perforated higher to remedy
the problem. Use slickline or electric line to shoot holes in the tubing at a shallower depth. If
perforated, move the plunger stop to above the holes.

Setting  the  tubing  high  above  the  perforations  is  another  common  mistake10  (Fig.  16.17).
The  large-ID  casing  will  load  more  easily,  leading  to  a  permanent  gas-cut  liquid  column  be-
tween the end of tubing and the perforations. Higher backpressure and lower flow rates from
these zones are the result.

Tools Run on the End of Tubing.  Downhole  plunger  equipment  can  be  maintained  with
slickline,  so  a  re-entry  guide  might  be  desirable.  Re-entry  guides  facilitate  smooth  return  of
slickline  tools  back  into  the  tubing  string.  Re-entry  tools  can  be  as  simple  as  a  plain  tubing
collar,  a  mule  shoe  (standard  collar  cut  at  a  45°  angle),  or  a  specially  designed  guide  shoe.
Installing  notched  collars  on  the  end  of  the  tubing  is  discouraged  because  notches  often  are
bent  inward  when  tubing  is  run  into  the  well.  Slickline  tools  run  in  this  situation  are  more
likely to become stuck.

Drifting Tubing in the Hole.  Ideally, to eliminate the possibility of crimps and other imper-
fections, the new or used tubing would be drifted as it is run in the well. Machine the drift to
the same length and OD as the plunger that will be used. Build a standard fishing neck with a
horizontal hole in the neck, to which a length of cotton rope can be attached. The rope should
be longer than the average length of the stands of tubing being run in the well. As each stand
of  tubing  is  run  in  the  wellbore,  the  drift  can  be  safely  lowered  from  the  rig  floor  down  the

IV-864

tubing. If tubing is overtightened or was crimped by tongs as it was made up, the drift will not
fall, indicating that the stand of tubing being inspected should be pulled and replaced. Running
the tubing with the plunger bottomhole assembly in place keeps the drift from being run out of
the tubing or lost. Using cotton rope makes fishing easier, should the rope break.

Often,  the  mistake is  made of  drifting on  the  rig  sand  line after running  the  entire tubing
string. The results of this are misleading because the weight of the sand line can force the drift
through spots that are too small for smooth plunger travel.

16.7 Evaluation and Installation of Downhole Plunger Equipment
The bottomhole assembly may contain one or a combination of a plunger stop, bumper spring,
standing valve, and strainer nipple. If tubing has not yet been run in the well, the bottomhole
assembly can be run in place from the surface. If the tubing is in place, slickline can be used,
or the stop can be dropped from the surface.

16.7.1 Plunger Stop.  A plunger stop is placed inside the bottom of the tubing string to keep
the  plunger  from  falling  through  the  tubing  into  the  wellbore.  Plunger  stops  can  be  set  in  a
profile nipple, directly in the tubing walls with a slip assembly, or in the collar recesses of a
tubing string.

Seat-Cup Stop Assembly.  The  seat-cup  stop  assembly  has  cups  and  a  no-go  similar  to  an
insert  sucker-rod  pump  and  is  installed  in  a  profile  nipple  (Figs  16.18 and  16.19).  Cup  sizes
can be changed to accommodate profile nipples with different IDs. It is very common for these
stops  to  be  built  with  a  standing  valve  and/or  bumper  spring  integrated  into  the  assembly.
These are the most common stops run because of ease of installation and retrieval.

A  seat-cup  stop  is  the  only  stop  that  can  be  dropped  from  the  surface;  however,  it  might
still  be  desirable  to  run  the  stop  on  slickline  to  verify  the  setting  force  and  depth,  especially
when a standing valve is integrated into the stop. Proper setting is necessary to ensure that the
standing valve functions as desired.

Tubing Stop.  A  tubing  stop  has  slips  that bite directly into  the  tubing,  without  need  of  a
profile to hold it in place (Figs. 16.19 and 16.20). It is useful when profile nipples are not run
in a tubing string, or where the stop will be set some distance above the seating nipple (such
as when tubing is too deeply set and will be perforated more shallowly). This stop can be set
with slickline, with no need to pull tubing or install a profile nipple.

Collar Stop.  A collar stop uses a type of slip that can be set only in a collar recess (Figs.
16.19  and  16.20).  It  can  be  set  in  most  types  of  tubing  that  have  space  between  the  tubing

tesy of Ferguson Beauregard.)

collars.  The  collar  stop  is  like  the  tubing  stop,  except  that  setting  depths  are  limited  to  even
tubing lengths. The collar stop actually is the easiest stop to unseat, and it can be unseated by
high gas-flow velocities. Poor-quality stops might unseat more easily.

Pin Collar.  The pin-collar type of stop is a collar with a pin welded inside it. It is screwed
to the bottom of the tubing string, and its pin acts as a permanent stop. These are more com-
mon in smaller-ID tubing strings used as siphon or velocity strings. The benefits of using a pin
collar  include  lower  cost,  minimum  pressure  drops,  and  simplicity.  Because  the  pin  collar  is
permanent, however, slickline cannot be run to tag the bottom of the well, clean out fill from
the bottom of the well, or run tools out the end of the tubing. Also, the pin collar cannot be
replaced without pulling tubing.

16.7.2 Bottomhole  Bumper  Spring  (Optional  Equipment;  Not  Found  in  All  Installations).
(See Figs. 16.18 through 16.20.) A spring installed on the plunger stop prevents damage to the
plunger,  stop,  or  tubing,  if  the  plunger  descends  in  completely  “dry”  tubing  (tubing  without

IV-866

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

liquid). Damage is more likely with poorly sealing plungers (e.g., bar stock or wobble washer
plungers), which fall at much higher velocities. The bumper spring absorbs the plunger impact
in these cases.

16.7.3 Standing Valve (Optional Equipment; Not Found in All Installations).   For  plunger
lift  to  be  effective,  produced  liquids  need  to  stay  in  the  tubing  when  the  well  is  shut  in.  In-
stalling  standing  valves  between  the  plunger  stop  and  bumper  spring  (Fig.  16.18)  will  keep
liquid accumulations in the tubing. Standing valves are more common in wells with low bottom-
hole pressures, where liquids may easily and quickly flow back into the formation because of
gravity segregation of the gas and liquid.

A  disadvantage  of  standing  valves  is  that  they  eliminate  the  ability  to  equalize  the  tubing
and  casing,  should  the  well  load  with  liquids  because  of  a  system  upset.  Some  valves  have
notched seats to allow some liquid slippage past the valve and to allow long-term equalization.
Other  problems  with  standing  valves  include  increased  pressure  drops  across  the  valve  and
sand or scale deposition that can plug the valve or prevent it from closing.

16.7.4 Strainer  Nipple  (Optional  Equipment;  Not  Found  in  All  Installations).    Running  a
strainer nipple on the bottom of the tubing will prevent sand, scale, and other debris from enter-
ing the tubing. It might also plug, inhibiting plunger operation.

16.8 Evaluation and Installation of Wellhead and Plunger Surface Equipment

16.8.1 Wellhead.  The  wellhead  should  have  the  same  or  very  close  to  the  same  continuous
ID  from  the  tubing  through  the  wellhead.  It  is  common  to  have  variations  in  wellhead  IDs,
especially  around  tubing  hangers,  backpressure  threads,  or  blast  joints  set  just  below  the  sur-
face (Fig. 16.21). When wellhead IDs are significantly larger IDs than that of the tubing, the
plunger  can  stall,  which  prevents  unloading  or  keeps  automated  controllers  from  sensing  the
plunger arrival. Some tubing adapters have areas large enough for shorter plungers to turn and
hang  in  the  wellhead.  Smaller-ID  restrictions  can  cause  impact  damage  to  the  wellhead  and
plunger. ID changes can be solved by changing wellheads, installing sleeves in tubing hangers
(especially in the backpressure-valve threads), and minimizing wellhead height by reducing the
number of master valves, flow tees, and swab valves.

It  is  better  to  flange,  rather  than  thread,  master-valve  adapters  and  master  valves  because
threaded adapters are more prone to breaking with system upsets. If a plunger ascends without
a liquid slug, it can reach speeds that can cause damage to the surface equipment. It is more
desirable to keep this damage above the master valve, especially because this valve is the last
isolation  valve  between  the  well  and  the  atmosphere.  A  slip-type  wellhead  with  the  master
valve screwed directly to the tubing string is a possible exception. The strength and durability
of 8-round threads for EUE tubing is much greater than that of normal line-pipe threads; how-
ever, in any application, flanged master valves are preferable.

In some installations with no packer, it is desirable to connect the casing to the tubing and
flowline. During normal operation, the casing remains shut-in, but, if the system is upset and
the  well  loads  and  dies,  the  tubing  and  casing  can  be  equalized.  Equalizing  allows  liquid  to
reach  a  common  level  in  the  tubing  and  casing,  reducing  hydrostatic  head  in  the  tubing.  Gas
that migrates into the casing during shut-in then can more easily and quickly displace liquids
back  into  the  formation.  Equalizing  can  be  used  to  bring  a  plunger  installation  back  on  line
more quickly, or to prevent swabbing to unload the well.

16.8.2 Lubricator/Catcher Assembly.  A  lubricator/catcher  assembly  (Fig.  16.22)  is  used  to
receive the plunger at the surface. It is built with a shock spring, catcher mechanism, and flow
ports.  The  lubricator  is  built  with  O-ring  seals,  and  usually  is  made  to  seal  when  hand-tight-

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

IV-867

Fig. 16.21—Effect of wellhead ID on plunger lift. Large changes in wellhead ID might cause the plunger to
get caught in the wellhead or to stall. Sample dimensions show the difference between one type of pad
plunger’s ODs and tubular/valve IDs.

ened (which facilitates plunger inspection). The lubricator/catcher size should match the tubing
and wellhead ID, and its installation should be plumb. If the lubricator is not plumb, the ascend-
ing force of the plunger will try to straighten the assembly, causing metal fatigue and failure.

Shock Spring.  The shock spring (Fig. 16.22) absorbs the impact of the plunger at the sur-
face, especially in the event of a dry ascent. The shock spring should be easily accessible and
replaceable, because a good shock spring will extend plunger life. Premature spring wear might
indicate very high plunger velocities and incorrect controller settings.

IV-868

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

Catcher Mechanism.  The catcher mechanism (Fig. 16.22) can be manually or automatically
set to catch the plunger at the surface. This facilitates periodic plunger inspections and proper
shut-in of plunger-lifted wells.

Flow Ports.  Flow  ports  tie  the  lubricator/catcher  assembly  into  the  flowline  piping  (Fig.
16.22). Dual flow ports are preferred over single flow ports. Because the plunger is held in the
wellhead  by  well  flow,  it  tends  to  ride  just  above  or  across  from  the  single  flow  port.  This
tends  to  create  flow  restrictions  and  the  possibility  of  hydrate  formation  in  the  wellhead  in
colder climates.

Catcher Extension (Optional Equipment; Not Found in All Installations).  Attaching an ex-
tension  to  the  catcher  improves  cushioning  at  plunger  arrival.  The  extension  consists  of
additional  tubing  placed  between  the  top  flow  port  and  the  shock  spring.  When  the  plunger
passes the flow ports and enters the extension, the loss of the driving force of the gas and the
compression  of  gas  above  the  plunger  slows  it  down.  The  extra  length  allows  the  plunger  to
stop  with  less  impact  on  the  shock  spring.  The  longer  the  extension,  the  greater  this  benefit.
Extensions are more prevalent with plungers in small tubing, where the small equipment increas-
es possibility of plunger damage. Extensions also may be used where a long plunger, such as
the side-pocket-mandrel plunger, is used.

16.8.3 Plunger Sensors.  Plunger  sensors  (Fig.  16.22)  are  placed  on  the  lubricator/catcher  to
sense  when  the  plunger  has  reached  the  surface.  Simple  controllers  use  the  sensor  strictly  to
count the number of times the plunger has reached the surface. More-sophisticated controllers
make cycle adjustments on the basis of sensor data for plunger arrival and ascent velocity.

Different  types  of  sensors  are  available,  but  most  are  either  acoustic  or  magnetic.  Sensor
dependability is imperative when controllers use plunger speed as a criterion for adjusting cy-
cle times. In many cases, sensor failure causes well shut-in by the controller, or well loading
and dying.

Sensors are susceptible to stray electrical currents, such as those produced by cathodic pro-
tection.  Such  currents  may  cause  erratic  sensing  of  plunger  arrivals.  Insulating  the  lubricator
and sensor from stray currents caused by cathodic protection or installing capacitance to level
current fluctuations can improve performance.

16.8.4 Motor Valves.  Pneumatically actuated motor valves (Fig. 16.13) commonly are used to
shut  in  and  flow  a  plunger-lifted  well,  but  electric  motors,  pneumatic  diaphragms,  and  hy-
draulic  operation  can  be  used.  Maintain  the  seat  and  trim  on  these  motor  valves  in  good
condition.  If  the  valves  leak  even  a  small  amount,  the  well  might  load  and  die.  Consider  the
seat and trim size when selecting and installing a motor valve. If sized too small, the seat and
trim can act as a choke to the well and prevent plunger arrival.

16.9 Design Considerations and Plunger Selection
Desirable features in a plunger include efficient sealing, reliability, durability, and the ability to
descend  quickly.8,13  Rarely  does  a  plunger  exhibit  all  these  characteristics,  though.  Usually  a
plunger  that  excels  at  one  aspect  sacrifices  others.  A  wide  variety  of  plungers  is  available  to
accommodate differences in well performance and operating conditions.

16.9.1 Plunger Seal and Velocity.  The  plunger  seal  is  the  interface  between  the  tubing  and
the  outside  of  the  plunger,  and  probably  is  the  most  important  plunger  design  element.  Most
plungers  do  not  have  a  perfect  seal;  indeed,  turbulence  from  a  small  amount  of  gas  slippage
around the plunger is necessary to keep liquids above and gas below the plunger. A more effi-
cient  seal  limits  slippage  and  allows  the  plunger  to  travel  more  slowly,  which  reduces  the
energy and pressure required to lift the plunger and liquid load. Less efficient seals allow exces-
sive slippage, and so increase the energy and pressure required to operate the plunger.13

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

IV-869

Fig. 16.23—The importance of plunger velocity. (Taken from Phillips and Listiak.10)

The velocity at which the plunger travels up the tubing also affects plunger efficiency9,10,13
(Fig.  16.23).  Very  low  velocities  increase  gas  slippage  and  lead  to  inefficient  operation  and
possible plunger stall. High velocities tend to push the plunger through the liquids. High veloc-
ities  waste  well  pressure,  cause  equipment  wear,  and  increase  well  backpressure.  Target
velocities allow just enough slippage to provide a good seal.

Target  velocities  have  been  be  determined  for  various  plunger  types  on  the  basis  of  each
plunger’s sealing ability.13 Better-sealing plungers operate efficiently at low velocities of 400 to
800  ft/min,  whereas  poor-sealing  plungers  must  travel  at  800  to  1,200  ft/min  to  maintain  an
adequate  seal.  Brush  and/or  pad  plungers  have  the  best  seal,  and  bar  stock  plungers  have  the
worst.

16.9.2 Reliability and Durability.  Reliability refers to the ability of the plunger to repeat per-
formance over time or in adverse environments. Many plungers have internal moving compo-
nents  (e.g.,  pads,  seals,  valve  rods,  and  bypasses)  that  might  fail  in  the  presence  of  sand  or
corrosive environments. Other plungers (e.g., brush or bar stock plungers) have no internal mov-
ing components and generally are more reliable.

Durability is a plunger’s ability to operate over many cycles with minimal wear and break-
age. Typically, metal sealing plungers such as pad plungers are longer wearing, whereas brush
plungers with fiber sealing elements wear quickly. Small-diameter plungers (for 1¼-in. or 1½-
in.-OD tubing) tend to break more easily than larger-diameter plungers (those for 2⅜-in. or 2⅞-
in.-OD tubing).

Plunger wear reduces the sealing efficiency of plungers over time. Inspect plungers periodi-
cally,  typically  every  1  to  3  months,  depending  on  operating  conditions  and  plunger  type.
Inspect new installations monthly until normal wear is determined. On the basis of such inspec-
tion results, plunger replacement can be documented and predicted.

16.9.3 Rapid Plunger Descent.  Rapid plunger descent is a desirable plunger characteristic for
wells  that  build  pressure  quickly.  These  wells  typically  are  ready  to  operate  as  soon  as  the
plunger reaches bottom. A plunger that falls more quickly can help to reduce shut-in times and

IV-870

Fig. 16.24—Turbulent seal plungers. (Courtesy of Ferguson Beauregard.)

buildup pressures, yielding lower average bottomhole pressures. In wells that require additional
buildup after the plunger is on bottom, rapid plunger descent is not beneficial.

Typical plunger fall velocities range from 500 to 1,000 ft/min in tubing that contains only
dry gas, but have been reported as low as 200 ft/min and as high as 2,000 ft/min, depending
on such conditions as the type of plunger, condition of the tubing, and deviation of the well. In
liquid, fall times typically are 150 to 250 ft/min, but have been reported as low as 25 to 50 ft/
min.10,13,23,32

Plungers that seal poorly or that have built-in bypasses have the highest fall velocities. Better-
sealing  plungers  fall  more  slowly.  An  internal  bypass  can  be  built  into  most  plungers  to
increase fall velocity.

16.9.4 Other Plunger Characteristics.  Plungers  are  built  with  either  an  internal  or  external
fishing  neck  to  enable  slickline  retrieval.  Plungers  might  need  to  be  retrieved  when  stuck,
when the well loads because of equipment malfunction, or when a plunger wears out and will
not surface.

There are many misconceptions regarding plunger design and choice. Weight sometimes is
incorrectly perceived to be the most important consideration in plunger design.10 This miscon-
ception stems from the incorrect belief that 1 psia is equivalent to 1 lbm, such that a 10-lbm
plunger would require 10 psia, for example, or a 50-lbm plunger would require 50 psia. Actual-
ly,  a  10-lbm  plunger  requires  just  over  3  psia  to  move  in  2⅜-in.  tubing  (ignoring  friction).
Although the weight of the plunger does affect the pressure requirements, the seal and liquid-
slug  size  play  a  more  important  role  in  determining  efficient  plunger  operation  and  required
buildup pressure.

16.9.5 Plunger Types.  Of the many plunger types that are available, the most common ones
are bar stock, wobble washer, sealed pad, retractable pad, brush, internal bypass, and side-pock-
et  mandrel.  Plungers  can  be  manufactured  in  a  combination  of  these  types.  Lengths  and
diameters also can be adjusted to meet installation requirements.

Bar Stock.  A  bar  stock  plunger  (Fig.  16.24)  is  a  piece  of  metal  (solid  or  hollow)  whose
surface  is  machined  with  grooves,  spirals,  or  other  shapes  to  create  turbulence  and  thus  the
seal,  between  it  and  the  tubing  wall.  The  bar-stock-plunger  seal  is  one  of  the  least  efficient
available.

Wobble Washer.  A wobble washer plunger (Fig. 16.24) is similar to a length of bolt that is
full of loose-fitting washers. Its sealing characteristics are comparable to those of a bar stock

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

plunger,  but  the  side-to-side  movement  of  its  loose  washers  sometimes  allows  it  to  travel
through tubing anomalies that would stick a bar stock plunger. The wobble washer plunger can
be less durable than a bar stock or brush plunger, and should it fail in the well, retrieving all
its washers can be difficult.

Pad.  Pad plungers are popular because of their durability and efficient seal. A pad plunger
(Figs. 16.25 and 16.26) incorporates spring-loaded metal pads that are fitted on a mandrel that
expands to maintain contact with the tubing walls. The pads improve the sealing ability of the
plunger  by  providing  less  bypass  area  for  gas  slippage,  but  because  of  this  the  pad  plunger
falls more slowly than other plungers. Pad plungers are available with one set or multiple sets
of pads. In general, the more sets of pads, the better the seal, but the fit of the pad against the
tubing wall also can improve the seal.

Sand can create problems for most pad plungers because the sand has a tendency to deposit
behind the pads. When this happens, the pads are unable to retract and the plunger might be-
come stuck.

Sealed Pad.  A sealed pad plunger (Fig. 16.27) is an improved version of the pad plunger.
In a normal pad plunger, gas can slip behind the pads, making the seal less efficient. The im-
proved plunger has seals behind the pads, eliminating gas slippage. The seals may be made up
of metal, rubber, polymer, or a tortuous path that creates turbulence behind the pads. Take care
that the sealing material is compatible with well fluids.

Retractable Pad.  A retractable-pad plunger seals well when unloading liquid, and falls very
quickly. This type of pad plunger is built with a shift rod that enables the pads to retract and
expand. The pads retract when the plunger reaches the surface and contacts a strike plate in the
catcher. The plunger then has a much smaller than normal OD, which helps it to descend quick-
ly.  It  might  even  be  able  to  fall  against  flow.  When  the  plunger  drops  to  the  bottom  of  the
well, the shift rod strikes the plunger stop and causes the pads to expand, readying the plunger
to lift the next liquid load. Because of its internal moving parts, the retractable-pad plunger is
less  durable  and  can  become  stuck  if  the  pads  fail  to  expand  when  the  plunger  reaches  the
bottom of the well.

tions. (Courtesy of Ferguson Beauregard.)

Brush.  A brush plunger seals very well and falls rapidly, but its bristles may wear quickly.
A brush plunger (Figs. 16.25 and 16.26) is similar to a pipe cleaner. Bristles made of a fiber
appropriate for well conditions are attached to a central mandrel. The OD of the bristles can be
adjusted  for  varying  tubing  diameters  and  can  be  specified  to  be  larger  or  smaller  than  the
tubing diameter. In most cases, new brush plungers have bristle diameters slightly larger than
the tubing so that the bristles maintain constant contact with the tubing. This, coupled with the
high turbulence created when gas flows through the bristles, gives the plunger excellent sealing
characteristics.

Brush-fiber  material  and  stiffness  affect  plunger  durability  and  influence  what  diameter  is
chosen.  A  stiff  bristle  will  wear  longer,  but  can  be  cut  so  large  that  it  prevents  the  plunger
from falling. A softer bristle can be built with an oversized brush diameter for increased seal,
but tends to wear out more quickly. Material selection is important in wells with high tempera-
tures because some nylon-fiber material melts at higher temperatures.

Internal Bypass.  An internal bypass can be built into any type of plunger (Figs. 16.28 and
16.29).  As  with  the  retractable-pad  plunger,  in  an  internal-bypass  plunger  there  is  a  shift  rod
that causes the bypass to open at the surface and close at the plunger stop. There are variations

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

behind the pads. (Courtesy of Opti-Flow LLC.)

of the shift-rod mechanism that require a special lubricator with a permanent rod built into the
shock-spring  strike  plate.  An  even  newer  variation  is  a  two-piece  plunger,  which  includes  a
ball  and  cylinder  that  fall  separately  but  rise  as  a  single  unit.  The  bypass  also  allows  the
plunger to fall more quickly. These types of plungers sometimes are used without any surface
control because of their ability to freely cycle while the well is flowing.

Side-Pocket-Mandrel.    The  side-pocket-mandrel  plunger  (Fig.  16.30)  is  designed  for  use
with gas lift side-pocket mandrels. It is longer than other plungers (5 to 20 ft), with seals on
both ends, and is used to bridge large ID increases across gas lift mandrels. Such ID increases
can  cause  excess  gas  slippage  or  plunger  stall  on  shorter  plungers,  preventing  operation.  The
side-pocket-mandrel plunger always keeps either the top or bottom seals in contact with normal
tubing ID, allowing a continuous seal in the tubing as the plunger passes through the large ID.
This specialty plunger also can be used when a packer, blast joints, subs, or other equipment is
installed with an ID that is larger than the tubing ID.

16.10 Evaluation of Control Methods

16.10.1 Plunger  Controller.    A  plunger  controller  controls  the  shut-in,  unloading,  and  flow
periods  of  a  plunger  system.  It  does  this  by  operating  one  or  more  surface  control  valves  to
shut  in  and  flow  the  well.  Different  controllers  use  various  set  points  and  well  data  to  deter-
mine  the  lengths  of  these  periods.  Controllers  can  be  either  manually  set  devices,  such  as
timers or differential-pressure controls, or self-adjusting systems, such as electronic “smart” con-
trollers that operate on the basis of time, pressure, and/or plunger velocity.

16.10.2 Manual On/Off Timer.  A manual on/off timer controls the plunger system according
to preset shut-in and flow times. Originally, manual timers were wind-up pinwheel models that
actuated a pneumatic valve. Newer versions use electronic clocks and a solenoid to actuate the
valve. The operator programs them with appropriate predetermined on and off times. Frequent-
ly  these  times  are  determined  through  a  long  trial-and-error  process,  during  which  operators
must make small changes each day to optimize the well. If operating conditions are static, the
on/off timers may provide efficient plunger operation, but when conditions change (e.g., if line
pressure increases), the operator must make changes to the settings. To keep the plunger run-
ning  in  all  conditions  requires  a  program  that  assumes  the  worst-case  conditions,  such  as  the
highest  line  pressures  experienced  during  normal  operations.  Such  conservative  programming
of  the  manual  on/off  timer  minimizes  the  chances  of  well  loading,  but  causes  higher  average
bottomhole pressures and, therefore, lower production rates.

Plunger Lift Systems Inc.)

16.10.3 Pressure-Differential Controller.  Pressure-differential controllers monitor tubing, cas-
ing,  and  line  pressures  to  determine  shut-in  and  flow  periods.  Early  versions  of  a  pressure
controller  simply  monitored  casing  pressure.  When  a  high  casing  pressure  was  reached,  the
well opened. When the well blew down to a low casing pressure, it was shut in again. If oper-
ating conditions varied, the control set points had to be reset.

Newer controllers use tubing, casing, and line pressure, as well as the design criteria pre-
sented earlier in this chapter (and below) to calculate when sufficient casing pressure has been
reached to open the well. Eq. 16.1b calculates required casing pressure:

pcs =

phs

(0.5 to 0.6)

+ (pl)max ,

where

phs = pc − pt . ........................................................... (16.19)

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

IV-875

The  well  is  opened  when  it  meets  this  calculated  required  casing  pressure.  Once  the
plunger has reached the surface, tubing and casing pressures are used to calculate a differential
pressure that gives an estimate of slug size. When a preset differential pressure is reached, it is
assumed that an adequate liquid load is in the tubing, and the well is shut in.

Automation and remote monitoring have helped make this type of controller more depend-
able. The ability of some pressure-differential controllers to make adjustments on the basis of
changing  operating  conditions  improves  well  performance.  Without  this  capability,  a  program
that assumes the worst-case operating conditions must be used.

16.10.4 Automated On/Off Timer Based on Plunger Velocity.  Adding  microprocessors  and
plunger-velocity  tracking  to  on/off  timers  was  a  major  advance  in  controller  technology  (Fig.
16.31). These automated controllers monitor plunger velocity to continually optimize the well,
eliminating the time-consuming trial-and-error process.9

The  importance  of  plunger  velocity  and  efficient  velocities  for  various  plunger  types  has
been discussed already. In essence, a plunger must travel at the correct velocity to lift liquids
efficiently. If the plunger ascends faster than the target velocity, then more energy was avail-
able  than  was  required  to  lift  the  plunger,  either  because  the  liquid  load  was  too  small  or
because pressure buildup was too great for operating conditions. In such a situation, the auto-
mated  controller  would  decrease  the  shut-in  time  (to  decrease  pressure  buildup)  and  increase
the flow time (to increase the liquid load).

Conversely, if the plunger ascends more slowly than the target velocity, then too little ener-
gy was available to lift the plunger efficiently, either because the liquid load was too large or
there was not enough casing pressure available. The automated controller then would increase
the shut-in time (to increase pressure buildup) and decrease the flow time (to reduce the liquid
load).

The controller increases and decreases shut-in and flow times on the basis of user-set time
increments.  For  example,  an  operator  might  set  the  controller  to  decrease  the  shut-in  time  by
three minutes and increase flow time by two minutes every time the plunger ascends too fast.
In this manner, the controller slowly adjusts until the well is optimized. This slow adjustment
will optimize the well, but it also can be an issue in that it takes the controller many cycles to

IV-876

when passing through gas-lift mandrels or packers. (Courtesy of Ferguson Beauregard.)

react to changing conditions. The problem can be partially remedied by using a controller that
allows for proportional adjustments. In proportional adjustments, if the target plunger velocity
is missed by a small amount, the changes to shut-in and flow times also might be small. If the
target velocity is missed by a larger amount, the changes might be larger. This allows a well to
react quickly to fast or slow plunger velocities.

A  drawback  with  time-based  plunger-velocity  controllers  is  that  a  target  velocity  can  be
reached with either large slugs and long shut-in periods, or small slugs and short shut-in peri-
ods.  As  discussed  earlier,  production  will  be  higher  with  short  shut-in  periods,  but  the  con-
troller might assume that the well is optimized with large slugs and long shut-ins. Good initial
controller setup can help to prevent this problem, but it is important for the operator to check
the  controller  periodically  to  make  sure  it  is  operating  with  the  minimum  amount  of  shut-in
time, and to make a manual adjustment, if necessary.

16.10.5 Combination  Automated  On/Off  and  Pressure  Monitoring.    One  of  the  most  effi-
cient  controllers  currently  available  monitors  flow  rates,  pressure  differential,  and  plunger
speed. It is efficient because it reacts quickly to changing well conditions. To determine flow
time, this combination controller compares the flow rate of the well to a calculated critical or
unloading  rate.  The  well  is  allowed  to  flow  a  specific  length  of  time  in  relation  to  this  flow

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

IV-877

rate  and  then  is  shut  in.  While  the  well  is  flowing,  the  controller  constantly  recalculates  the
critical  rate  on  the  basis  of  actual  tubing  pressure,  which  allows  quick  reaction  to  changing
flowing conditions.

To  determine  shut-in  time,  the  casing,  tubing,  and  line  pressures  are  monitored.  Like  an
advanced pressure-differential controller, the combination controller uses plunger design equa-
tions to determine when the casing pressure has reached the minimum needed to open the well
and operate the plunger. Thus, the controller allows the plunger to operate as soon as the well
is ready.

Using  these  parameters  alone  is  an  efficient  means  to  control  plunger  lift,  but  it  can  be
further optimized by using plunger velocity with flow and shut-in multipliers. The flow multi-
plier is an adjustment to the critical flow rate. A flow multiplier of 1.0 flows the well until it
reaches critical flow rate. A flow multiplier of 0.9 flows the well until it falls to 90% of the
critical flow rate (resulting in a longer flow time). A flow multiplier of 1.1 flows the well until
it is at 110% the critical flow rate (shorter flow time). If the plunger ascends too quickly, the
controller lowers the flow multiplier. If the plunger ascends too slowly, the flow multiplier is
increased. The shut-in time is changed similarly with a casing-pressure multiplier.

16.10.6 Venting (Optional; Not Found in All Installations).  All  the  plunger  controllers  dis-
cussed here can be used with a venting option. With a venting system, the controllers typically

IV-878

Petroleum Engineering Handbook—Vol. IV

will switch to venting if the plunger does not reach the surface in a specified period of time.
The manual controller requires an operator to determine when the controller vents. An automat-
ed  controller  uses  flowing  conditions  to  determine  when  and  how  long  the  well  should  vent
and, over time, attempts to eliminate venting by making changes to shut-in and flow times. For
automated  controls,  venting  is  a  preventative  measure  to  keep  the  plunger  operating  during
short  periods  of  high  line  pressures.  Venting  is  discussed  in  more  detail  in  the  Applications
section of this chapter.

16.10.7 High-Line-Pressure Delay (Optional; Not Found in All Installations).  High-line-pres-
sure  delay  prevents  the  plunger  from  operating  against  abnormally  high  line  pressures,  which
cause the plunger to load and die. Although optional, this delay feature is recommended with
all applications. With high-line-pressure delay, a pressure transducer or switch gauge monitors
surface pressures and shuts in the well when pressures are too high for the plunger to operate.
Automated controllers incorporate a delay that requires the high pressure to continue for a peri-
od of time (usually 5 to 15 minutes) before shutting in the well. Once line pressure drops, the
controller typically will return the well to the start of the shut-in cycle.

This  option  is  very  useful  in  gathering  systems  that  use  a  single  compressor.  When  the
compressor stops running for any reason, high-line-pressure delays at individual wells override
control  of  the  plunger  control  valve  and  shut  in  the  well,  then  automatically  reset  the  well,
making compressor downtime easier for the operator to handle.

16.10.8 Acoustic Fluid-Level/Plunger-Descent Tracking (Optional; Not Found in All Instal-
lations).    Acoustic  fluid-level  devices  can  be  used  to  track  plunger  descent  and  liquid-load
sizes.23,32 Analysis equipment is being developed that will automatically track plunger descent,
using acoustic signals sent from the wellhead or by listening to the impact the plunger has with
each tubing collar, and will use this measurement to determine the exact minimum shut-in time
required for each cycle. This is useful for operating the well with the least amount of shut-in
time,  for  making  sure  the  plunger  is  on  bottom  before  attempting  to  flow  the  well,  and  for
troubleshooting plunger problems.

This  equipment  also  may  be  used  with  tubing/casing-flow  plunger  lift.  The  casing  purge
cycle can be managed more efficiently by determining exactly when the fluid has been trans-
ferred from the casing annulus to the tubing.

16.10.9 Remote Control/Telemetry (Optional; Not Found in All Installations).  Adding  the
ability to monitor and make adjustments remotely will improve any plunger-lift controller. Sev-
eral  manufacturers  have  incorporated  electronic  flow  measurement,  pressure  monitoring,  com-
puter software, and either phone, radio, or Internet communications into their plunger systems
(Figs.  16.32  through  16.34).  Case  studies  have  shown  that  adding  remote  control  increases
production, even on wells that previously had been equipped with self-adjusting electronic con-
trollers.12  One  advantage  is  the  ability  to  view  production  and  pressure  data  on  a  very  small
time scale, such as 1-min increments. This makes diagnostic work very easy because all stages
of  the  plunger  cycle  can  be  analyzed  for  pressure  or  flow  anomalies.  Also,  viewing  the  data
remotely  enables  quick  diagnostics  on  many  wells,  as  well  as  the  ability  to  use  experts  who
cannot  be  on  site.  Remote  control  allows  immediate  adjustments  to  the  system  when  trou-
bleshooting.  As  with  all  artificial-lift  equipment,  better  accessibility  leads  to  quicker  response
time and an increased understanding of the operations taking place.

16.10.10 Missed-Trip  Protection  (Optional;  Not  Found  in  All  Installations).    Some  con-
trollers  have  missed-trip  protection,  a  feature  that  can  save  operator  time  and  prevent  equip-
ment damage by shutting in the well in situations involving repeated plunger nonarrival and/or
slow arrival. If the plunger fails to surface a preset number of times, usually five or fewer, the

system can be automatically suspended and the well shut in, which keeps the well from load-
ing  and  dying  and  gives  it  time  to  build  pressure.  The  operator  then  can  restart  the  plunger
system immediately upon arriving at the well, whereas if the well is not automatically shut in,
the operator might have to make additional trips back to the well.

Missed-trip protection also prevents dry plunger trips when there is damage to the plunger
sensor or sensor line. If the sensor or sensor line is damaged, the controller will not recognize
plunger  arrivals.  On  the  basis  of  this  perception,  automated  controllers  will  try  to  make  the
plunger  surface  by  making  adjustments  (flowing  less  and  shutting  in  longer),  leading  to  very
fast  plunger  arrivals.  In  such  situations,  if  the  controller  is  allowed  to  continue  to  adjust,  the
plunger velocity can become so high that the plunger and the lubricator/catcher will be damaged.
Controllers with this capability also can shut in the well when the plunger arrivals repeated-
ly  have  been  at  a  slower  than  targeted  velocity.  This  is  usually  not  as  useful.  If  the  plunger
velocity  is  slower  than  ideal,  an  automated  controller  should  be  able  to  adjust  to  bring  the
plunger  back  to  the  target  velocity.  If  a  system  problem  is  causing  the  slower  trips,  then  the
plunger eventually will fail to arrive. The missed-trip protection would then shut in the well.

16.10.11 Swab Mode (Optional; Not Found in All Installations).  Some  controllers  incorpo-
rate a swab mode, which is used primarily in wells that have been worked over with comple-
tion  fluids  or  chemically  treated,  such  that  it  might  be  necessary  to  remove  the  additional
liquids before starting normal plunger operation. In swab mode, the well is shut in immediately
upon  plunger  arrival  at  the  surface.  This  tends  to  conserve  well  pressure  and  produce  many
small liquid loads. In this manner, the additional fluids are “swabbed” with the plunger.

Controllers  operate  in  swab  mode  by  requiring  the  plunger  to  make  a  preset  number  of
consecutive  arrivals  at  or  above  the  target  velocity  before  flow  time  is  allowed.  Shut-in  time
adjustments  usually  continue,  while  flow  time  adjustments  are  suspended.  When  the  plunger
arrival criterion has been met, the additional well liquids are assumed to be unloaded, and the
controller resumes normal operation.

16.11 Evaluation and Modification of Production Facilities

16.11.1 Surface  Production  Facilities  and  Equipment.    Surface  equipment  (e.g.,  separators,
heater  treaters,  and  compressors)  should  be  sized  to  handle  the  high  instantaneous  flow  rates
that accompany cyclical plunger-lift flow. Proper plunger-system operation can minimize these
fluctuations (by operating at the minimum shut-in period), but flow rates still will vary.

Monitor  pressures  from  the  wellhead  through  all  surface  equipment  to  the  sales  point  and
beyond,  and  use  these  pressure  nodes  to  identify  and  eliminate  restrictions  and  leaks.  Piping,
connections,  valves,  check  valves,  and  even  chokes  sometimes  are  already  in  place,  and  are
overlooked when plunger lift is installed. Every restriction increases the pressure necessary to
operate  the  plunger  lift  and  potentially  reduces  well  production.  Eliminate  leaks  upstream  of
the control valve to enable effective static-pressure buildup. Leaking equipment can allow liq-
uid  entry  into  the  wellbore  during  the  shut-in  cycle,  loading  the  well  or  preventing  efficient
plunger operation.

Dehydration  can  be  very  difficult  in  single-well  applications.  If  initial  rates  are  too  high,
glycol could be forced out of the dehydrator and lost. Minimize the loss of dehydration fluid
by installing pressure-differential controllers or bypasses or by using desiccant-type dehydrators.

16.11.2 Measurement.  Electronic flow measurement (Fig. 16.34) is very beneficial for plunger-
lifted wells. Electronic measurement more accurately records cyclical production rates, increas-
ing the profitability of plunger-lift applications. Dry-flow paper-chart recorders (Fig. 16.35) are
difficult to integrate if production has a wide sweep on the chart or overranges the recorder, or
if the chart time cycle is too long.

Larger-range springs and orifice plates help to keep differentials within a measurable range.
The  orifice  plate  should  be  capable  of  measuring  the  peaks  and  valleys  of  the  plunger  flow.
Install  as  large  an  orifice  plate  as  possible;  as  with  the  motor  valve  and  other  surface  equip-
ment, an orifice plate that is too small can act as a choke. Small plates also can become bowed
or damaged if subjected to high differentials at the beginning of a cycle.

16.11.3 Pressure-Differential Controls.  A pressure-differential control (PDC) limits the maxi-
mum flow rate through production equipment of a plunger-lifted well. The PDC uses an orifice
to measure differential pressure and flow rates, and throttles the plunger control valve. Using a

Chapter 16—Plunger Lift

IV-883

PDC  can  prevent  overranging  of  measurement  equipment,  solve  dehydration  problems,  and
even remedy surface-equipment sizing problems.

The drawback to using a PDC is that it effectively is a choke, and so increases the pressure
required to operate the system; however, it chokes the well only when a specific flow rate is
exceeded, and the temporary loss in flow rate might be less costly than replacing surface equip-
ment.

16.11.4 High-Low-Pressure Control Pilots.  High-low-pressure control pilots also can be incor-
porated  with  plunger-lift  control  valves.  Although  they  do  not  control  flow  rates,  they  are
effective at limiting maximum surface flowing pressures. If well flowing pressures exceed the
surface-equipment allowable operating pressures, the high/low pilot will protect the equipment
by shutting in the well.

COVER
Illinois Sen. Barack H. Obama ran for the office of the US presidency on a platform that emphasized change. As highlighted in
this week’s special report on US Energy Politics, starting on p. 20,
Washington, DC-based oil and gas trade association officials are
expecting to see Obama’s plans for change unfold as the presidentelect’s inauguration approaches and as a Congress—with a bigger
Democratic majority—goes to work. Many also think that
deteriorating economic conditions will temper energy and environmental policy changes, at least in the near term. But they’re also
preparing for some major battles with environmental organizations
and lawmakers determined to quickly move away from fossil fuels.

SEC approves reserves reporting requirements
The US Securities and Exchange Commission unanimously approved changes to its reporting requirements for oil and gas producers. The adjustments reflect technological improvements over
the last 25 years, SEC said Dec. 29, 2008.
SEC said the renewed disclosure requirements include provisions that permit use of technologies to determine proved reserves
if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead
to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes. They also allow producers to disclose probable and possible reserves, which contrasts
with earlier rules that limited disclosures to proved reserves.
“These updated rules consider the significant changes that have
taken place in the oil and gas industry since the adoption of the
original reporting requirements more than 25 years ago,” said
John W. White, director of the SEC’s corporate finance division.
The revised disclosure requirements also require producers to
report the independence and qualifications of entities that evaluate
or audit reserves, file reports when a third party is used to prepare
estimates or audit reserves, and report reserves using an average
price based on the prior 12 months instead of yearend prices, according to SEC.
The use of an average price for oil and gas will lead to more
reliable comparisons of reserves among producers and mitigate
distortion of estimates that can result from using a single pricing
date, SEC said. The full text of the changes will be posted on the
commission’s web site as soon as possible, the commission said.
“In the more than a quarter century since the SEC last reviewed
its rules in this area, there have been significant changes in technology that have increasingly limited the usefulness of current disclosures to the market and investors. These updates to the SEC rules
will help ensure more meaningful and comprehensive disclosure
of information that, even though it does not appear on a company’s
balance sheet, is of significance to investors in making informed
investment decisions,” said SEC Chairman Christopher Cox.

DOE to resume SPR ﬁll in wake of oil-price slump
The US Department of Energy plans to take advantage of the
recent crude oil price decline and resume filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, it reported Jan. 2.
DOE said it issued a solicitation to buy about 12 million bbl of
crude to replenish supplies that were sold following Hurricanes

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Katrina and Rita in 2005. Congress overwhelmingly passed a law
ordering DOE to suspend SPR purchases in May after prices broke
the $100/bbl barrier. The ban expired Dec. 31, 2008.
The energy department also said it plans to seek repayments
from refiners for emergency oil it released from the SPR following
Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, to deliver deferred royalty-inkind oil, and to solicit new RIK deliveries this spring. The actions
are required under the 2005 Energy Policy Act, it said.
Planned acquisitions during 2009 will bring the SPR back to its
727 million bbl storage capacity and provide the US with about 70
days of net import protection.

China, Indonesia sign energy agreements
Indonesia and China have signed eight energy-related agreements, valued at $3.13 billion, during the third Indonesia-China
Energy Forum (ICEF) in Jakarta.
The first agreement extended an oil and gas contract for a development in the Madura Strait, East Java, operated by China National
Offshore Oil Corp. and Canada’s Husky Energy Inc.
Indonesia’s upstream oil and gas regulator BPMigas signed the
20-year extension of the two companies’ contracts, which were
due to expire in 2012.
ICEF also witnessed two agreements on coal mining, one on
biodiesel plants, and four on electric power production projects.
The eight agreements, and amount of finance, include:
• Oil and gas contract extension in Madura Strait (BP Migas,
CNOOC, and Husky Madura Ltd.; $642 million).
• Biodiesel development in Jambi and South Sumatra (PT Kurnia
Selaras and China Development Bank; $255 million).
• Coal mining joint venture in Muara Enim (Bukit Asam and
Huadian Corp.; $14.40 million).
• Coal mining cooperation in East Kalimantan (PT Budi Dharma Kencana and Lark Guangdong Power Resources Inc.; $350 million).
• Power plant financing in Pelabuhan Ratu (Exim Bank of China
and PT PLN; $481.94 million).
• Power plant financing in Pacitan (Exim Bank of China and PT
PLN; $293.23 million).
• Power plant construction in Cilacap (PLN, CNTIE, and Shanghai Electric; $605.29 million).
• Power purchase agreement for Muara Enim (PT PLN and PT
GH EMM Indonesia; $330 million). ✦

the Persian Gulf. They include Jaouf-11, Ramthan-9, Nayashin-1,
Jareed-101, and Khorsaniya-114. The minister named the three gas
fields—all offshore—as Arabiya-1, Rabib-1, and Hisbah-16.
Ramthan-9 is 400 km northwest of Dhahran, Jareed-101 is 130
km north of Dhahran, Khorsaniya-114 is 138 km northwest of
Dhahran, and the gas fields Rabib-1 and Hisbah-16 are 125-200
km northeast of Dhahran.
Al-Naimi released first test production results from three of the
wells, saying that Jaouf-11, about 300 km northwest of Dhahran,
is producing 2,551 b/d of oil and 33,980 cu m/day of associated
gas; Nayashin-1, 60 km northwest of Ramthan, is producing 2,076
b/d of oil; and the Arabiya-1 gas discovery 185 km northeast of
Dhahran is producing 1.16 million cu m/day, he said.

Pemex to drill deep in Bay of Campeche
Pemex Exploration & Production is drilling its first deepwater
well, Catamat-1, off Tuxpan, Veracruz state, using the Noble Max
Smith semisubmersible. The wellsite lies in 1,200 m of water. The
rig will take 150 days to drill to 5,200 m.
The rig will be serviced by seven supply vessels and two helicopters from the marine terminal at Cobos, 400 km from Veracruz.
Pemex improved an access road to Cobos and began upgrading
port facilities in April 2008 to accommodate the drilling.
The governor of Veracruz, Fidel Herrera Beltran, and assistant
director of Pemex’s north region, Jorge Andres Perez Fernandez, inaugurated the drilling project Jan. 1 in Tuxpan. Tuxpan is the closest
port to Mexico City; Pemex maintains a facility on the Tuxpan River
to build and maintain drilling rigs.
This is the first exploration project since Mexico’s Congress
passed the 2008 energy reform bill in October 2008 (OGJ, Dec.
15, 2008, p. 18).
Noble Max Smith can drill in 7,000 ft of water. It’s under a
3-year contract to Pemex, from Aug. 1, 2008, to July 31, 2011. Noble said the rig was upgraded in second-quarter 2008, mobilized
from the US to Mexico, and is working at a dayrate of $484,000.
Noble also has 10 jack up rigs working in Mexico’s Bay of
Campeche, with contracts ending December 2009 to December
2011. Noble’s rigs in Mexico contributed 20% of the company’s
overall revenue in the first 9 months of 2008, according to the
company’s investor presentations in December.

The project was deferred in December when Santos said there
were delays in the execution of a gas sales agreement because of the
poor financial climate.
Although Santos said the project is again viable, Clough Australia said it is still waiting to hear if its contracts for engineering,
procurement, and construction of the Devil Creek plant and the
offshore facilities at Reindeer will be reinstated.
Apache holds 55% of the project, and Santos holds 45%.

Nexus: Libra, Crux ﬁelds are separate structures
The successful Libra-1 wildcat drilled in Browse basin permit AC/
P41 off Western Australia has confirmed that Libra field is a separate
structure from nearby Crux field, said the permit’s partners.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC holds 65% interest in the permit; Mitsui
holds 20%, and Nexus Energy, 15%.
Logging and pressure data indicate that Libra-1 intersected a
206-m gross gas column in a better-than-predicted reservoir section on the way to a total depth of 3,918 m.
The gas-water contact in the well is shallower than that encountered
in Crux as well, also suggesting that Libra is a separate accumulation.
Nexus says the find has boosted confidence in the prospectivity
of the Greater Crux region and provides additional incentive for
follow-up drilling at the adjacent Auriga and Caelum prospects.
Libra-1 was drilled by the Ocean Epoch semisubmersible and is
now plugged and abandoned as planned.

ExxonMobil eyes Sandakan basin exploration

ExxonMobil Corp. plans to invest as much as $100 million exploring
for oil and gas in southwestern Philippine waters, press reports said.
The disclosure, contained in Philippines Department of Energy documents, refers to a mid-2008 farmout under which Mitra
Energy Ltd., a private company registered in Hamilton, Bermuda,
farmed out a 50% interest and operatorship of Service Contract 56
to ExxonMobil (OGJ Online, June 13, 2008). The Philippines DOE

The partnership plans to drill two deepwater exploration wells in
2009, Mitra Energy’s web site said.

Japan protests Chinese drilling in E. China Sea
Japan said it “cannot accept” China’s development of the Tianwaitian gas field near a disputed part of the East China Sea, saying
instead that the area should be under negotiation.
“The Japanese government expresses its regret that China is unilaterally developing the field,” said Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo
Kawamura, adding, “Japan cannot accept China’s unilateral development.”
Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone, describing the
Chinese actions as “regrettable,” called for the early resumption of
negotiations between the two sides.
“I can’t say exactly when it would be, but I believe the most
important thing right now is for working-level discussions on this
issue to resume soon,” said Nakasone.
The governments of Japan and China agreed on joint development of the gas fields in June 2008.
The accord includes joint development in the area near the
Asunaro (known in China as Longjing) gas field, and Japan’s investment in the development of the Shirakaba (known in China as
Chunxiao) gas field.
The Tianwaitian field (known in Japan as Kashi) was not mentioned by name in the June agreement but Japan contends it is part
of further negotiations and should be left undeveloped.
“Our understanding is that the status of the [fields] outside
of the political agreement is blank. Therefore the status quo is the
way it should be,” Kawamura said. But China disputes the Japanese
claim.
“The gas field development activities of the Chinese side are
being carried out within China’s inherent sovereign rights,” said
foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang.
According to a recent report in Japan’s Sankei Shimbun newspaper, China has already finished the drilling in Kashi-Tianwaitian,
and “there is the strong possibility that China has entered the stage
of production.”

Venture starts production from Grouse oil ﬁeld
Venture Production PLC, Aberdeen, has brought Grouse oil field
on Block 21/19 on stream in the UK Central North Sea.
The field is expected to produce 10,000 b/d of oil and 3.25
MMscfd of natural gas in 2009. Production is through a single subsea well tied back to the company’s operated Kittiwake platform—
the production hub for the Greater Kittiwake Area (GKA). Natural
gas will be used as fuel or exported via the Shell Fulmar line to St
Fergus.
Venture said it saved money by laying Grouse’s required pipeline when it developed Chestnut and Stamford fields, which began
production in 2008.
“Grouse has also made use of a pipeline tie-in point that was
preinstalled during the construction of the Goosander infrastructure in 2006,” Venture said. Goosander started production in August 2006 in the GKA production hub.
Mallard oil field, also in the GKA, resumed production in midDecember following production optimization initiatives. It is a highpressure, high-temperature subsea tieback to the Kittiwake platform.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Mike Wagstaff, chief executive of Venture, said Grouse was the
third GKA satellite to have been brought into production since Venture assumed operatorship 5 years ago.
Venture operates Grouse with a 50% working interest. Its partner, Dana Petroleum PLC, holds the other 50%.

BC’s ﬁrst commercial CBM project on line
GeoMet Inc., Houston, and Canada Energy Partners Inc., Vancouver, BC, began deliveries from British Columbia’s first commercial coalbed methane project near Hudson’s Hope west of Dawson
Creek, BC.
Flow started on Dec. 31, 2008, from eight wells at the Peace
River project, and GeoMet plans to book initial proved reserves as
of that date.
The companies have drilled 12 production wells and four coreholes
to Lower Cretaceous Gething coals that average 52 ft thick with 400
cf/ton across 50,788 acres. More drilling is planned in mid-2009.
GeoMet is operator with 50% interest, and Canada Energy Partners has 50%. Canada Energy Partners said the companies have invested more than $45 million in the project the past 8 years. The
project has 315 potential well locations on 160-acre spacing.
Canada Energy Partners said the project’s modular, scalable gas
treating and compression facilities will be strategic in commercialization of the Moosebar shale, the Montney shale, and other deeper
formations. Exploration programs on Moosebar and Montney-Doig
formations are under way on the lands covered by the project.
GeoMet said Peace River has thicker coal with higher gas content than its project in Alabama’s Cahaba basin. Operating costs are
higher in Canada, but it expects a similar return because it pays
no severance tax, no royalty for 5-7 years, and then 10% average
royalty for the life of project.

US 2007 drilling outlays rise to $226.4 billion
US oil and gas drilling expenditures soared to a record $226.4 billion in 2007, more than doubling the previous record of $109.8 billion a year earlier, the American Petroleum Institute said on Jan. 5.
API said the Joint Association Survey of Drilling Costs for 2007,
the latest year for which figures are available, showed that records
also were set in average costs per well and per foot.
Average costs per US oil well grew 82% to $4 million in 2007
from $2.2 million, while per foot costs climbed 78% year-to-year
to an average of $717 from $412, according to API. It said that
average costs per domestic natural gas well rose 105% to $3.9 million in 2007 from $1.9 million in 2006 as average costs per foot
grew 74% year-to-year to $604 from $348.
Total oil well expenditures jumped 94% to $72.3 billion in 2007
from $37.3 billion in 2006, while gas well expenditures grew by
nearly 101% to $119.1 billion from $59.3 billion, API said.
Hazem Arafa, director of API’s statistics department, said strong
demand and historically high prices increased competition for labor, services, and equipment, which pushed drilling costs higher
along with record-high steel costs.
“But despite a doubling of the cost to drill and develop wells,
we also witnessed a rise in both the number of wells drilled, which

Indonesia, China to revise Tangguh LNG price
Indonesia, building on earlier agreements, said it will move
ahead with plans to renegotiate the price of LNG from the Tangguh
field for export to China.
“We will refresh (the negotiation) in January 2009,” said VicePres. Jusuf Kalla on a visit to the Tangguh LNG project at Bintuni
Bay in West Papua province.
Kalla, who said the negotiations would take up the pricing formula and not just the price of the LNG, gave no indication of what
his government planned to offer the Chinese.
In the original 25-year contract between Indonesia and China,
the price had been set at $2.40/MMbtu and was based on an oil

price of $20/bbl.
In later negotiations, the Chinese government agreed to raise
the price to $3.80/MMbtu but the Indonesian government refused
the offer, saying it was still too low.
In October, Indonesia denied that it was planning to delay the
first shipments of LNG—due to begin in first quarter 2009—from
Tangguh as a means of pressuring China to agree to a better price.
“We must respect the contract,” said Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro. “We are continuing negotiations, but as the negotiation has yet to reach an agreement,
we must follow the contract,” he said (OGJ Online, Oct. 30,
2008). ✦

A better focus
It’s sad that the oil industry is still
approaching the new government with a
focus on producing more barrels per day.
That focus will fall on deaf ears.
If instead the oil industry approached
the government with how many new
jobs it is going to create (by producing
more barrels), how many billions of
dollars of gross domestic product it is
going to generate by increasing domestic production while reducing the level
of oil imports (a GDP multiplier effect),
and how many more billions of dollars
it is going to pay into desperate federal,
state, and local tax coffers, our industry
would be received at the front of the
Obama line, rather than at the end of the

MEG injection rate
The article “New method yields MEG
injection rate” by M. Moshfeghian and
R. Taraf (OGJ, Sept. 1, 2008, p. 44), fails
to consider two points:
1. In Fig. 2, the MEG rate is difficult
to read at low concentrations of MEG
in rich solution (x axis). This difficulty
makes this graphical method useless for
low concentrations of MEG of less than
40%. Injection of MEG for more than
40% needs serious economical evaluation because MEG is more expensive
than methanol.
2. These days, software is commercially available; this graphical method is
not efficient. Also, users cannot use this
graphical method in their programming,
optimization, and modeling.

inow control, reduce risks and well costs, and increase production.
• Reduce make-up time by up to four hours per zone
• Improve zonal isolation and production rates with smaller holes and lower
drilling costs than with cementation
• Protect against micro annuli by keeping the well owing when cement failure
may require unprotected wells to be shut in

political or social cause can’t carry out
a peaceful “revolution” that completely
changes the world. To understand that,
one needs only to watch old TV footage
of the anti-war and civil rights movements back in the 1960s when every
gathering of people under the age of
30 at a sit-in, a rock concert, or around
a campfire soon had everyone singing
along with the national anthem of that
decade, Bob Dylan’s “The Times They
Are A-Changin’.”
Many people believed the words
and ideas they sang then. And there are
some great changes—Obama’s historic
role as the first African-American president of the US is a direct result of social
and political changes that began in the
1960s.

No dramatic revolution
But the idealists of that decade didn’t
end racism. Some who advocated opening election polls and schools back then
now want to close US borders. People
who once practiced free love now have
families and worry about abortion.
They may have played a part in getting
US troops out of Vietnam, but they
didn’t end war. They just ended the
Selective Service so US parents don’t
have to worry about their children being drafted to fight today’s dirty little
conflicts. The all-volunteer military has
shouldered that duty.
Yes, there will be change in the
energy business under the Obama administration. The most immediate will
be from current economic problems
that persist no matter who is in office.
But there will be no dramatic revolution
that will eliminate demand for oil and
gas. Partly because the Green Movement has no song that can fire public
passion as did “The Times They Are
A-Changin’.” ✦

An expensive land grab
In a move with dire implications for exploration and production on federal land, the US Senate
returned to business as usual as the 111th Congress began work. The phrase “business as usual”
here means sneaking energy mistakes into law as
parts of a wide-mouth sandwich of provincially
irresistible spending adventures.
Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) reintroduced an omnibus lands bill that opponents fear
will tighten limits on access by producers to federal oil and gas resources. He had withdrawn the
legislation, actually a package of more than 150
bills, in November in response to resistance led by
Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.).

regulation. It called the legislation “one of the
largest land grabs in history.”
In his Senate remarks, Coburn put the acreage
figures into perspective by noting that the US area
off-limits to development as wilderness already exceeds that of developed land—107 million vs. 106
million acres. Beyond giving statutory authority to
the NCLS, an initiative of former Interior Sec. Bruce
Babbitt late in the administration of President Bill
Clinton, the bill in various ways would withdraw
a further 3 million acres from leasing and energy
exploration, Coburn said. Some of that lock-up
would occur through wilderness and other such
designations imposed with the stipulation that the
land become subject to NCLS management.

Barack H. Obama ran for US president on a platform that emphasized
change. Washington-based oil and gas
trade associations are expecting exactly
that as his inauguration approaches and
a Congress with a bigger Democratic
majority goes to work. Many also think
that deteriorating economic conditions
will temper energy and environmental
policy changes, at least in the near term.
“Clearly, the
changes for the
worse in our
economic situation should
cause us all to
reflect on how
best to restore
a strong economy, coupled with sound
energy policy and a thoughtful effort
to address environmental concerns,”
observed Jack N. Gerard, the American
Petroleum Institute’s new president.

not only in terms of energy security, but
also economically. They’ve been very
receptive,” he said.
Brian T. Petty, senior vice-president
for government affairs at the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said, “I think 2009 is fraught
with disappointment and danger. It all
depends on the tack the new administration takes in developing new hydrocarbons, and also the market, which is
very much up in the air, for my association’s members.”
“I’m not a pessimist,” said Charles
T. Drevna, president of the National
Petrochemical and Refiners Association.
“Even with the advent of the new administration and a more Democratically
controlled Congress, I believe sound
judgment will always overcome pandering to special interests at the end of the
day.”

In a tight spot

“Make no mistake, though,” Drevna
added. “This industry is in a tight spot,
as are all industries. It has to decide
how it’s going to look in the future, and
it can’t base business decisions on election cycles. What we need is certainty

and cooperation. What we don’t need
are policies that are politically expedient but are detrimental to the consumer
and the economy,” he added.
Skip Horvath, president of the Natural Gas Supply Association, anticipates

involving oil and gas, but in regulation overall. He likened regulation to a

substantial bridge, which will

he said.
But the NGSA president also
said that many Democrats have
not yet made the connection
between relying more heavily
on gas and providing greater
access to domestic supplies. “I
think we haven’t got the message to Democrats that if they’re
going to embrace natural gas as
a bridge fuel, you need to have
access to supplies. We’re making progress in helping them
understand that they’ll need to
allow exploration to get natural gas out
of the ground,” he said.
IPAA’s Russell added, “In a general
sense, we know that the Obama administration and folks up on the Hill generally are interested in renewables and
alternatives. We’re trying to get across
the important role of fossil fuels over
the immediate future. Frankly, there are
still some folks who think we can turn
the light switch immediately from fossil
fuels to renewables. They’re the ones to
whom we need to explain our role in
energy security,” he said.

A long bridge
Lee O. Fuller, IPAA vice-president
of government relations, said several environmental organizations have identified gas as the key bridge fuel to future
energy choices. “We think it’s going to
be a very long bridge before those future fuels will be able to replace natural
gas,” he said.
At the same time, groups such as the
Natural Resources Defense Council have
been difficult to deal with on access issues, he told OGJ. “NRDC has been active in lawsuits involving construction
requirements and hydraulic fracturing.
If you look at the natural gas supply
structure, certainly the role of shale gas
is essential to allow the growth of that
supply going forward,” Fuller said.

to do this is to develop more of our

IADC’s Petty raised another point:
“The Interior Department, as it administers offshore and onshore oil and gas
leasing, has to take a longer view. It is
the second largest source of federal revenue after the Internal Revenue Service.
I think the Obama team could take a
long look at expanding offshore access
as a result.”
NOIA’s Fry was not so certain. “It’s
all about the economy,” he said. “It’s
also about supply and demand from
an oil and gas perspective, and I can’t
predict how that’s going to look in the
short term. Obviously, when prices fall,
some of the harder-to-get resources
won’t be developed, because it’s not
economic to do so. Some companies
already are talking about cutting back
capital expenditures, which probably
means we won’t be producing as much
oil and gas in 2-3 months onshore and
7-8 years offshore,” Fry told OGJ.
“I think people want to look at the
energy security question,” said Naatz.
“President-elect Obama and Congress
are going to have to deal with this. We
hope there won’t be any steps backward
on access onshore as well as offshore,
because the public is looking at this in a
whole new light.”
The most recent election brought
more new members to Congress from
politically conservative districts that are
friendly to business, Naatz continued.
IPAA plans to reach out to them, as
well as to members from districts with
agriculture and other industries that
consume large amounts of energy, he
said.
“Over the last two elections, most
of the Democrats who were elected replaced centrist Republicans,” said Fuller.
“But we also saw in the last Congress
that there’s a big difference between
where they view an issue and how
they’re able to develop legislation.”

ing 2007-13, followed by 1.42%/year
in 2013-18.
Following the forecast 0.5% demand
contraction in 2009, BMI is assuming
0.58% growth in 2010, followed by
1.42% in 2011.
It said this growth reflects a bottoming out of the global economy over the
next 18 months, before recovery gets
underway in second-half 2010.
Growth will accelerate in 2011-13,
BMI said, before slowing again as energy-saving initiatives take effect towards
the end of the forecast period.
OECD oil demand growth is expected to remain weak to 2018, reflecting
market maturity, the ongoing effects of
recent demand destruction, and a greater commitment to energy efficiency.
Following the predicted 1.3%
decline in 2009 OECD oil consumption, BMI expects to see a reduction of
0.05% in 2010.
The recovery forecast for 2011-12
delivers annual gains of 0.43% and
0.64% respectively.
“We expect growth trends to turn
negative once again beyond 2014,” the
analyst said.
On average, OECD demand is
forecast to fall by 0.64%/year during 2007-13, and by 0.18%/year in
2013-18.
For the non-OECD region, the demand trend to 2013 is for 2.84% average annual market expansion, followed
by 2.65% in 2013-18 as economies
mature and energy-efficiency begins to
play a role.

forecasts are negative throughout the
According to the BMI model, 2009
global oil production will increase
by just 0.4%, representing an OPEC
increase of 0.1%, and a non-OPEC production boost of 0.5%.
“We have assumed OPEC production cuts in the first half, but with some
reversal in the second half,” BMI said.
BMI also has assumed that some
OPEC members, such as Nigeria and
Iraq, will increase output despite the organization’s target of reduced volumes
from January 2009. The overall increase
in supply is estimated at just 265,000
b/d.
IEA’s December OMR predicts
non-OPEC supply growth in 2009 of
480,000 b/d, or almost 1%, according
to BMI.
“We believe this to be an optimistic assessment of potential non-OPEC
production growth, even before the
possible impact of price-induced
spending cuts,” BMI said, adding that,
“The IEA does historically overestimate
non-OPEC oil supply.”
EIA forecast in December 2008 a
410,000 b/d rise in non-OPEC oil
output, representing a gain of 0.8%.
EIA expects world oil production to be
85.14 million b/d in 2009, down from
85.52 million b/d in 2008.
“The US organization clearly expects
a sizeable downturn in OPEC oil output,” BMI said.
OPEC itself sees 2009 non-OPEC
supply rising by 640,000 b/d, which
the analyst said “looks to be an ambitious level.”
With a large step-up (up 610,000
b/d) in OPEC natural gas liquids, the
implication is that OPEC crude production will need to fall substantially.
In fact, the December OPEC monthly

period, with demand falling typically
by 0.1%/year.
The non-OECD oil market is set to
expand by an average 31.7%/year in
2008-13, with growth accelerating
towards 3.4% by the end of the forecast
period.

Long-term oil supply
BMI sees global oil supply increasing
by an average 1.52% annually during
2007-13, with a yearly gain of 1.37%
predicted in 2013-18.
It expects growth to be at its slowest
in 2009, but averaging more than 2% in
2010-13. The analyst said this growth
rate is “particularly vulnerable to spending cutbacks from 2009 resulting from
lower oil prices.”
Non-OPEC oil production is expected to rise by 0.63% in 2007-13, then
0.38% in 2013-18. OPEC volumes are
forecast to increase by an annual average
of 2.61% during 2007-13, easing to
2.46%/year in 2013-18.
IEA is assuming an average annual
0.52% increase in non-OPEC oil supply
in 2008-13.
BMI said supply projections beyond
2010 are at risk from reduced international oil company and national oil
company spending.
It explained that OPEC in particular
will be reluctant to add extra spare capacity if the demand is not there to use
it, while IOCs may delay spending on
major oil sands and deepwater projects
if there is scope for price weakness that
will undermine returns and project
economics.

Oil-price assumptions
An early and sustained recovery in
oil prices during the latter part of 2009
should mean that most investment programs are secure.
The OPEC basket price, having averaged an estimated $94.08/bbl in 2008,
is now forecast to be $52/bbl in 2009.
This represents $40 during the first
quarter, which BMI expects to be the
weakest period, recovering to $52 in
the second quarter as OPEC supply cuts
impact the price.

During the second half, BMI expects
the price to move back into a $55-60/
bbl range if OPEC continues to manage
production effectively.
Brent, WTI, and Urals prices for
2009 are put at $55.65, $56.63, and
$52.48/bbl respectively. BMI said EIA
is now using $51/bbl as its central assumption for WTI in 2009.
“With oil demand growth still
relatively subdued in 2010, and a likely
pick-up in non-OPEC supply expansion,

there is limited scope for OPEC to boost
output during the year,” the analyst
said.
However, if it can exercise reasonable
restraint, BMI sees scope for a continuing oil price recovery and is now forecasting an average OPEC basket price of
$58/bbl for the year.
“By 2011, there should be greater
growth in oil consumption and more
room for OPEC to regain market share

and reduce surplus capacity through
higher production quotas,” BMI said.
The analyst is assuming a further
increase in the OPEC basket price to
an average $65/bbl, implying Brent at
$68.70/bbl, WTI at $69.60/bbl, and
Urals at $65.50/bbl.
“For 2012 and beyond, we are now
using a central case forecast of $70/bbl
for the OPEC basket, down from our
earlier long-run forecast of $90,” BMI
said in its report. ✦

Pertamina says Natuna
D-Alpha project delays
persist; access blocked
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Indonesia’s state-owned PT Pertamina may delay its decision to seek partners for developing the Natuna D-Alpha
gas block in the Riau Islands. It is facing
obstacles regarding the status of former
operator ExxonMobil Corp.
“Yes, it [the decision] may be delayed,” said Pertamina upstream director
Karen Agustiawan, adding that the company might not be able to announce
its partners for the block in January as
scheduled.
“We will once again write to the
government asking for confirmation (of
the status of ExxonMobil),” the director said, adding, “We want to know
whether [the ExxonMobil contract] has
expired or not.”
ExxonMobil operated the Natuna
block until the government, claiming
the firm had failed to make adequate
development progress, withdrew its
contract.
ExxonMobil denied the claim, saying
its rights remain after investing some
$400 million.

Data access blocked
Karen also said Pertamina is facing
difficulties accessing data about the
block. “The data is supposed to be available at the directorate general of oil and
gas. I have requested the data, but it is
not available.”
“If the government exposes the
technical data, the managements of the
eight potential partner companies can
immediately make an evaluation and
submit proposals to us,” Karen said.
Earlier this month, Pertamina Vicepres. Director Iin Arifin Takhyan said
ExxonMobil still had far more complete
technical data than Pertamina’s.

facilities to produce LNG at sea.
Does that sound odd? Well, for
starters, the idea could ease a host of
problems, including rising resource
nationalism in countries such as Indonesia which is threatening Japan’s
supply stability.
According to Akira Ishikawa,
chief economist of Japan Oil, Gas, &
Metals National Corp., interest in the
concept of floating production, storage, and offloading facilities for LNG
is likely to increase amid “supplydemand shifts for natural gas and the
rising cost of land facilities due to
environmental concerns.”
Underlining the practicality of the
LNG FPSO concept, Ishikawa notes
that floating platforms will lead to
more stable procurement by visiting
smaller fields—usually ignored due
to low profitability.
According to reports, industry
players have identified more than 130
undeveloped gas fields in the AsiaPacific region alone. Altogether, those
fields contain estimated reserves of
80 tcf, enough gas to satisfy Japan’s
LNG import needs for 20 years.
And many Japanese think that
floating LNG facilities are the best
way to tap those fields.

world’s first FPSO facilities for LNG.
Chiyoda hopes to shop the concept to Royal Dutch Shell, which is
looking to tap fields off Australia and
is thought likely to purchase FPSO
blueprints from either Chiyoda, JGC
Corp., or a French firm.
IHI Corp. which has been applying
proprietary technology for stabilizing LNG carriers for the development
of LNG FPSOs, has signed a licensing agreement with Samsung Heavy
Industries Co. IHI expects to work on
five midsize platforms and two large
ones annually in 2010-15.
Meanwhile, Inpex Corp. plans to
develop FPSO platforms for the Masela Block in Indonesia’s Timor Sea. The
goal is to start producing 4.5 million
tonnes/year of LNG beginning in
2015—all to be shipped to Japan.
Inpex also is considering the idea,
for cost reasons, at Australia’s Ichthys
gas field, which is likely to cost more
than 2 trillion yen to develop—three
times more than earlier projections.
This increase is due mainly to
a government ruling that the LNG
plant must be located far from the
ecologically sensitive field area.

opening of technical data at the moment,” he told the Bisnis Indonesia
newspaper, “Exxon with its technical
data would have bigger chance to get
interest and work together again with
Pertamina to operate the Natuna DAlpha block.”
According to government sources,
however, neither Pertamina nor ExxonMobil has returned the data.

Pertamina seeks partners
After revoking ExxonMobil’s contract, the government ordered Per-

tamina to develop the block and to
seek partners, as investment costs for
the project would come to at least $52
billion.
As the block operator, Pertamina
has a 40% interest in Natuna, with the
remaining 60% to be allocated to partners. At the time of the government’s
decision, ExxonMobil held a 74% stake
in the block, while Pertamina held the
remaining 26%.
Last July, Karen said that Pertamina
would appoint consultancy Wood
Mackenzie to advise it on selecting a

partner to develop the Natuna D-Alpha
gas block.
“We will appoint Mackenzie to
look at 10 potential bidders to develop
Natuna,” Karen said. “Mackenzie will
see the strength of each bidder, as it has
good data on them.”
Pertamina has since shortlisted 8
prospective companies for potential
partnership, including Royal Dutch
Shell PLC, Chevron Corp., Eni SPA, Total
SA, StatoilHydro ASA, China National
Petroleum Corp., Petronas, and ExxonMobil. ✦

Gas exporting countries form charter, base in Doha
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
The Gas Exporters Countries Forum
(GECF), a group of the world’s largest
natural gas suppliers, has established a
charter and chosen Doha as the home
for its permanent secretariat, signaling Qatar’s growing importance in the
natural gas market.
The actions formalize the group,
which was loosely established in 2001,
and strengthen its determination to
shape the global gas market, actions of
concern to Western nations troubled
about future gas prices and energy
security.
Doha was selected over Algeria,
Iran, and Russia as the headquarters for
GECF.
“This is a significant event for the
market,” Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev told reporters. “Global
stability, energy security, and the balance of interests between exporters,
transit states, and consumers depend
on the agreed position of the exporting countries.”

‘Not a cartel’
However, GECF, which met in Moscow on Dec. 22, has stressed that there
are no plans to form a cartel along the
lines of OPEC. Gas producers want to
improve their relationship during this
28

period of uncertainty and its members
account for roughly two-thirds of the
world’s gas reserves.
Venezuelan Energy Minister Rafael
Ramirez said: “It’s not a cartel. We are
defending the interests of our countries,
that’s all.”
Russian Energy Minister Sergei
Shmatko said, “I believe exporters can
find the balance between competition
and the harmonization of their energy
policies.”

Russia’s Prime Minister, Vladimir
Putin, told energy ministers at the GECF
meeting that the era of cheap gas was
coming to an end because operational
costs were soaring.
The Moscow meeting was held amid
growing concerns that Europe could
suffer a shortfall in gas supplies from
Gazprom due an ongoing dispute with
Ukraine. Gas supplies to Europe via the
Ukraine pipelines have since been cut
off (see p. 29). ✦

in Indonesia due to a lack of major
investment. At the same time, the government has been promoting domestic
gas use to offset the higher cost of
importing oil.
However, other problems have arisen, with the country now struggling
to meet its commitment to deliver
LNG to offshore buyers—especially

Asian buyers such as Japan and South
Korea.
Last week, Indonesia said it was
seeking nine cargoes of LNG in 2009
from the spot market to meet its contractual commitments to South Korea
and Japan in 2009.
In early December, a government
official said that Indonesia would buy
five cargoes of LNG on the spot market

in 2009, which it will ship to South
Korean buyers.
Underlining the issue of increased
domestic consumption, Raden Priyono,
chairman of upstream oil and gas regulator BP Migas, said Indonesia would
divert the gas it had previously intended
for the South Korean buyers to PT Pupuk
Iskandar Muda, a state-owned fertilizer
company. ✦

Gazprom head comments on Ukraine gas issue
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Europe has stopped receiving gas
supplies from Russia via Ukraine amid
the bitter dispute that Russia’s OAO
Gazprom is embroiled with Ukraine
over unpaid bills and prices for deliveries in 2009.
Alexander Medvedev, Gazprom’s
deputy chief executive, told journalists
that Naftogaz, the Ukrainian company,
had shut in the fourth export pipeline,
stopping all transit supplies to Europe.

On Jan. 6, Gazprom accused Ukraine of
closing three pipelines.
“We continue to do our utmost to
use alternative routes,” he added, with
gas being delivered via the 4,100-km
Yamal-Europe pipeline and underground storage. Gazprom has delivered
more than 170 million cu m under
contract to its European customers, he
said. It is also looking at buying gas on
the spot market to meet its obligations.
Naftogaz blamed Gazprom for
the disruption, saying that Gazprom
stopped transporting supplies to

Russian gas supplies through Ukraine shut down
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
All Russian gas supplies through
Ukraine were shut down early Jan.
7 in a further escalation of the OAO
Gazprom-Naftogaz pricing dispute,
leaving some European Union and
Balkan countries, now facing bitter cold
temperatures, with no gas supplies
from Russia.
The EU has access to other sources,
including Russian gas from other
pipelines, as well as gas from the UK,
Norway, and the Netherlands. But
some countries are more dependent on
gas transiting through the Ukraine than
others.
Hardest hit by the supply cuts was
the western Balkan route to Romania,

Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece, and
Turkey, however Slovakia, Italy, and
Austria could also suffer from shortfalls
if cuts are prolonged.
For Turkey, gas from Russia is still
available via a line that extends beneath the Black Sea. Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, meanwhile, have
sufﬁcient stocks for some days. Other
countries have large gas reserves or
other supply sources.
The European Commission is
actively organizing meetings to ﬁnd a
solution for the crisis. The Gas Coordination Group meeting planned for Jan.
9 in Brussels should be the one to take
action with emergency measures for
countries with few energy alternatives.
The GCG includes gas experts from

Ukraine on Jan. 7. Over the first 6 days
of January, it insisted it had delivered 74
million cu m of gas to Europe from its
own reserves despite Gazprom’s stoppage.
Gazprom has alleged that Ukraine has
stolen Russian gas intended for European
consumers after it stopped exports for
Ukraine’s domestic needs on Jan. 1.
Different European countries have
reported significant drops in their Russian imports with the Balkan countries
severely impacted. Bulgaria, which relies solely on Russian gas, could run out

each EU member state and representatives from national gas companies and
transmission operators.
The EC still insists that it is a commercial dispute between Gazprom and
Naftogaz in which it cannot interfere,
while urging with increasing force the
two sides to resume gas supplies immediately.
At presstime last week, the EU was
planning a Jan. 8 meeting of its foreign
affairs ministers in Prague under the
Czech presidency to determine how a
more-active role can be played to bring
the dispute to a permanent and satisfactory close. This could bring in the political
dimension of the crisis but also disagreement among the 27 as Eastern countries
are willing to exercise some clout on
Russia while most Western countries
do not want to harm their relations with
Moscow.

in days and Slovakia has declared a state
of emergency. France, Germany, and
Italy are also suffering reductions. The
shortage coincides with an Arctic cold
snap that will leave millions of eastern
Europeans in a humanitarian crisis if
the crisis is not resolved quickly.
Both companies have blamed each
other throughout the dispute and they
have now pledged to the European
Commission to have international
monitors check the supply of Russian
gas through Ukraine for Europe.
Medvedev told OGJ that it previously
wanted to use international observers to
monitor the metering stations in Russia
and Ukraine, but Ukraine has resisted
it. “We sent them to Russia and western Europe and the Ukrainians fought
against it,” he said.

Gazprom is now demanding from
Ukraine $450/1,000 cu m for its exports
in 2009, which is the same rate for the
eastern European countries bordering
Ukraine minus costs of gas transit across
Ukraine. Ukraine’s last price offer was
$235/1,000 cu m and it has announced
it will resume negotiations with Gazprom
on Jan. 8. But it is demanding an increased transit fee of $2/1,000 cu m.
Medvedev told OGJ that the initial
offer of $250/1,000 cu m for gas
exports that expired on Dec. 31, 2008,
was “very expensive for us in the present financial situation,” adding that,
“Ukraine said then it wanted to pay
$100/1,000 cu m.”
Medvedev urged Ukraine to resume
talks, but complained that Jan. 8 was
unfeasible as Gazprom was holding

talks with officials in Europe on this
date. “They [Ukraine] want to create
the illusion that they want to negotiate.”
“We hope that this situation will be
fixed quickly and so we wouldn’t want
to do a force majeure clause in our
contracts,” he added.
Gazprom has sought to establish medium term supply contracts rather than
renewing yearly agreements at different
prices to avoid disruption to exports.
Ukraine, Medvedev said, has rejected this
proposal.
The company has not shut down any
production wells amid the dispute as
this could impact “very negatively” on
its operations. “We have a very comprehensive upstream and midstream
situation and are currently using all our
underground reserves.” ✦

US Coast Guard.
They said the spill occurred during
the unloading of low-sulfur diesel from
a tanker when a 10-in. valve did not
close completely. An outside contractor
had pressure-tested the valve previously
and told ExxonMobil Pipeline it should
be replaced, according to DOJ.
The diesel leaked into a product receipt line containing some 2,500 gal of
low-sulfur kerosine. The line contained
a pressure relief valve capped by a badly
corroded 3/4 in. coupling that had not
been replaced in more than 30 years,
they indicated.
The coupling burst, sending diesel
and kerosine into a containment pan
and then into the river. The spill continued until about 5 a.m. Jan. 10 when
pumping from the tanker ended.
DOJ said the release of some 2,500
gal of kerosine and 12,700 gal of kerosine into the river eventually reached
Boston Harbor, prompting several reports to the Coast Guard. Terminal employees did not discover the ruptured
coupling and overflowing containment
pan until Coast Guard personnel arrived to ask questions about the sheen’s
origin.
As part of its plea agreement, which
is subject to federal court approval,
ExxonMobil agreed to pay the maximum possible fine of $359,018, which
included $179,634 in cleanup costs,
and more than $5.6 million to the
North American Wetlands Conservation Act fund to restore Massachusetts
wetlands, DOJ said. The company also
agreed to the monitoring of the Everett
terminal by a court-appointed official
for the next 3 years, they said. The terminal also will be subject to a rigorous
environmental compliance program. ✦

New SEC rules:
too late for ’08

P

ublicly traded producers were
elated when the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted
new oil and gas reserves disclosure
regulations Dec. 29, 2008. They also
wish it had happened sooner.
“It’s unfortunate that the rules
weren’t modified before now. It’s
good news they’re changing, but not
soon enough to help producers in
2008,” explained Frederick Lawrence,
the Independent Petroleum Association of America’s vice-president of
economics and international affairs.
“Generally speaking, we think they’re
still a huge improvement over the
very archaic rules which previously
were in place.”
The new rules take effect Jan. 1,
2010, so producers still have to limit
2008 estimates to proved reserves.
They also must use a Dec. 31, 2008,
price to determine the reserves’
estimated value.
“We have a lot of concerns remaining, and I expect to hear during
our investors’ conferences about
how these rules affect companies
from 2008 to 2009. Access to capital

and other modern technologies to
show reserves. It will be important
to be able to show more clearly what
resources are in the ground without
having to drill for them,” Lawrence
said.
“Considering the possible and
probable reserves also will be a
factor,” he said. “Just being able to
include nonconventional formations
in reserves will help our members,
who are focusing more on shales and
coalbed methane.”

Impact of estimates

Reserve estimates matter: They
affect a producer’s balance sheet and
market capitalization. Investors pay
close attention to both indicators.
“The whole issue of financial
leverage and credit is high on everyone’s list this year. The balance sheet
certainly will be affected by these
changes from one year to the next,”
Lawrence said. “There could be a
one-time jump in reserve estimates
in 2009 for a lot of these companies.
[But] 2008 will still be a tough year
as they go into the new year with
their balance sheets hammered down
by the yearend pricing rule.”

Analyst notes changing global, Chinese LPG trade patterns
Demand patterns for global LPG trade
will change in the near term, according to
New York-based Poten & Partners, a global
broker and commercial advisor for energy
and ocean transportation industries, in its
December issue of LPG in World Trade.
In the same study, the consultancy
explained recent unexpected patterns in
Chinese LPG supply and demand in terms
of one dynamic: price.
Poten & Partners noted the reversal
in West-to-East LPG trade patterns that
had dominated global trade for the last 5
years; trade is now East-to-West. This contrasts with LNG trade patterns in which
tight supplies have been and will continue
to move to the East.
Until 2008, targeted LPG retail growth
markets in the East have been the large
populations of China, India, and Indonesia. But China’s LPG demand “has stalled,”
said the consultant. India’s LPG markets
are hampered by continuing domestic
price subsidies. And in Indonesia, the
“problem is infrastructure.”
Markets in these countries will not “be
able to absorb the increasing LPG volumes
on the international market,” according to
the study.
Poten & Partners noted that rising LPG
imports to China 2002-04 had once underpinned demand growth in the Far East.
Investors looking in the future, however,
failed to see the extensive new refinery
capacity developing in China’s hinterland
and to anticipate fully the added LPG
production that would result. Import infrastructure for LPG that developed at the
time was underutilized, as a result.
Rather than growing, Chinese LPG
imports have fallen since their 2004 peak.
For 2008, says the consultancy’s analysis,
LPG imports were 2.4-2.6 million tons,
compared with 8 million tons for 2004.
This unexpected trend—China’s disappearance from the international market—
can be explained by price: “High and
rising international prices since 2004
forced China out of the market.”
The downward trend of Chinese LPG
imports appeared to have reversed in

November 2008, when Chinese buyers
bought 130,000 tons of spot November
LPG deliveries. “The impetus [was] again
price—international prices [had] fallen
below domestic prices which although
deregulated are based on governmentcontrolled crude prices,” said Poten &
Partners.
The recent supply and demand dynamics in China’s LPG market since 2004,
before which China was the Far East’s
second-largest LPG importer, are unlikely
to end soon. Major changes have occurred
to the amount of LPG produced in Chinese refineries and to those consuming
the LPG, says the Poten study.
To compensate for the effects of government control of markets for refined
products in China, refiners often “maxi-

mize their LPG production to capitalize
on comparatively lucrative free-market
LPG sales.” A surge in Chinese refining
capacity since 2000 has effectively backed
LPG imports out of China.
Barring changes to the regulatory
structure, says Poten & Partners, China’s
refiners will “continue to maximize LPG
production over that of other products
until refinery gate prices reach a floor set
by the international LPG market.”
On the consumption side, many “light
industrial units have closed since the start
of [2008], taking with them valuable
outlets for LPG.”
In summary, says the consultancy, “domestic LPG production capacity is high
and growing while LPG will lose some
of its demand base for the short term at
least.” ✦

Moody’s downgrades independent E&P industry
Moody’s Investors Service has changed
its outlook of the independent exploration and production industry to negative,
citing the “precipitous decline” in oil and
natural gas prices to levels that are likely to
result in abnormally low cash margins and
fundamental credit deterioration.
“This increased likelihood of fundamental credit deterioration beyond our
normal cyclical expectations is a key driver
for our negative outlook,” said Peter Speer,
Moody’s vice-president and senior analyst.
“In addition, the potential reduction in
credit availability to the speculative grade
companies also weighed heavily in our
forward view,” Speer said.
According to Moody’s, there is significant risk that E&Ps have entered a
prolonged period of abnormally low cash
margins and returns due to persistent
demand-driven price declines’ outpacing
cost reductions and supply response.
“Many E&Ps had fully ramped up capital spending and were increasing leverage
just as the market turned,” said Speer, “as a
result, some companies are ill-prepared for
a downturn.”

Moody’s noted the roller coaster ride
oil and gas prices were on in 2008. “Our
long-term fundamental ratings for these
E&P companies are driven by their scale,
cost competitiveness, capital productivity,
and leverage profiles—not by commodity
prices,” said Speer.
However, the extreme reversal in prices
over the past 6 months followed an enormous ramp up in E&P capital spending that
could not be throttled back as fast as prices
declined.
Speer noted that, overall, most investment-grade E&Ps have sufficient cash
resources, committed credit availability,
and flexibility in their capital expenditures
to manage through current low commodity prices.
However speculative-grade E&Ps are at
great risk of bank borrowing base reductions.
According to Moody’s, key issues in the
coming year include the cost of oil field
services, the impact that global macroeconomic fundamentals have on oil demand
and prices, and the expected adjustment in
response to lower E&P activity. ✦

The design of a 3D seismic survey
depends on a number of field parameters that control the patch geometry and
layout of source and receiver lines.
A 3D seismic survey is planned
over a subsurface geologic target area,
usually picked from interpreted 2D migrated seismic data. Due to the presence
of dips, this migrated subsurface area is
expanded into unmigrated surface area,
which in turn is
further expanded
into the final survey area, in order
to get full fold
coverage over the
target area.
In most cases,
except star and radial layouts, the initial
design starts with source and receiver
lines in the form of a rectangular grid,
which is interactively clipped at the
edges according to the shape of the
expanded geologic target area.
Several software applications are
available with a whole range of 3D survey design and analysis capabilities, but

they do not provide an automated procedure for geologic target area expansion and clipping of source and receiver
lines within the final survey boundary.
This article presents an algorithm
for expanding the subsurface geologic
target area polygon into the final survey
area polygon, on the basis of migration aperture and fold taper zone and
finally, clipping the source and receiver
lines within this expanded survey area
polygon. The working of the algorithm
is demonstrated through a practical
example.

Introduction

In a 3D seismic survey, exploration
objectives of delineating the geologic
target are achieved through optimization of seismic acquisition parameters,
which in turn govern the bin size, patch
geometry, template movement, and
subsequent field layout design. Cordsen
et al.1 discussed in detail these parameters, their relationship with patch
geometry, and selection of appropriate
field layout design that fulfills these
objectives.

The high season for
Canadian drilling should
begin now, but many
Canadian operators plan
to scale back operations.
Depressed commodity
Drilling
prices, increased operations costs, and the new
Alberta royalty program all hurt drilling
activity north of the US border.
Due to commodity price (and industry) pressure, the Alberta government
recently announced a transitional, lower
royalty for new wells drilled after Nov.
18, 2008, but this will probably have
little effect on operators’ plans to drill
(OGJ Online, Dec. 17, 2008).
In response to a Nickle’s Energy
Group poll, 51% of respondents said
their companies would still “decrease
its capital budget for drilling in Alberta
in 2009 because of low commodity
prices, weak capital markets and higher
Alberta royalties.”
In November and December, Canadian Natural Resources, EnCana Corp.,
Imperial Oil, Petro-Canada, Royal
Dutch Shell PLC, and Suncor Energy
announced delays of various projects in
Canada. Some processing projects were
canceled outright.
Top Canadian drilling rig operators
in December were EnCana (43 rigs),
Husky Energy Inc. (30), ConocoPhillips Canada Ltd. (27), Talisman Energy

O D U C T I O N

Inc. (23), and Shell (18), according to
Nickle’s Rig Locator.

The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers represents more
than 95% of Canada’s upstream oil
and gas industry.

Greg Stringham,
vice-president of

Stringham noted a regional shift in

CAPP is forecasting $43 billion
(Can.) in Canadian oil and gas investment spending in 2009, down from
about $50 billion/year in 2006-07.
In particular, spending on oil sands is
expected to drop about 20% to $16
billion in 2009, and spending in the
WCSB will drop to $25 billion from
about $29 billion spent in 2008.
About 16,000 wells were drilled in
western Canada in 2008; CAPP expects
only 14,700 wells in 2009, an 8%
decrease.

Trends

Operators and drilling contractors
reported significant cost inflation in
materials, fees, and labor rates.
Calgary-based Ziff Energy Group
announced two major studies at the end
of 2008. The 15th edition of its Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin study
assessed upstream operating costs and
production reliability, based on 32,500
producing wells in 300 fields. The study
base produced 4.9 bcfd natural gas and
340 million b/d of conventional oil.1

Ziff noted that Alberta oil sands
production has grown 160%, to 0.6
million boe/d over the 6-year period
2003-09, and Ziff analysts expect it to
increase 120% to 1.3 million boe/d
from 2009 to2015. Conventional oil
production in western Canada will drop
to 1 million bo/d in 2015 from an estimated 1.3 million bo/d in 2009.
Canadian oil sand producers
launched a new website in June 2008
to cover environmental and social
impacts of development through media
stories, opinion pieces, and a public
discussion forum (www.canadasoil____________

Reorganizations
Various Canadian companies are
reconsidering plans to split or spin off
IPOs.
During a 2009 budget conference
call on Dec. 11, Randy Eresman, EnCana
Corp.’s president and chief executive
officer, said, “Depending on market
conditions, the company may divest
between $500 million and $1 billion
of noncore assets. If prices are weak in
2009, we expect to invest less and sell
fewer noncore assets. If prices strengthen, we expect to invest more and sell
more noncore properties.”3
Marathon Oil Corp. Pres. and Chief
Executive Officer Clarence P. Cazalot
Jr. said on Dec. 11 that the company
continues to evaluate a split of its assets
and operations into two independent
companies. Marathon’s oil sands mining
headquarters is in Calgary.

Market volatility
A common problem in this industry is that short-term price volatility
threatens long-term strategic planning. Increasing production generally
involves large capital expenditures and
is hampered by a long time lag.
When operators succeed in their initial exploration programs, it generally

EnCana’s Eresman summed up the
company’s outlook on Dec. 11, “With
respect to cost inflation, we expect
consistent downward pressure throughout 2009 with greater effect later in the
year. Short-term impacts are expected to
be offset by a number of factors including existing commitments and supplier
inventory as well as moderate increases
in labor rates. We do not expect our
more measured pace in 2009 to have
a significant impact on the long-term
development of our key resource
plays.” ✦

Expectations
Although the economic downturn
continued to deepen at press time, the
outlook for the oil industry remains unclear. The International Energy Agency
offers a positive outlook, predicting that
demand will be up in 2009.
Price fluctuations are nothing new in
this industry, however, and oil companies will continue to explore and
develop oil and gas resources, although
at a more measured pace. They will
continue to search out and employ new
technologies to work more quickly and
efficiently.
Innovative companies will devise
intelligent approaches to optimizing data acquisition and processing.

Annual Forecast and Review

Module performance
Snider said that the interventionless completion in Cana 1-15H saved
about 2,784 man-hr compared with a
conventional completion. He also emphasized that the time saved included
1,000 man-hr during which personnel
would have been exposed to higher risk
during conventional completion operations, an 84% reduction.
Marathon’s statistics as of October
2008 indicate that it has installed 501
modules in 44 wells with a 100% success. It has attempted to fire 493 modules with only two not firing. Snider
attributed one failure to a crushed hydraulic line at the surface and the other
one to a Barnett well in which 2-3 years
lapsed before attempts to fire the guns
were made. In that Barnett well, only
one of eight guns did not fire, Snider
said.
Marathon believes its 99.6% firing
success is slightly better than industry’s
overall success due to its more intimate
knowledge of the system’s capabilities.
Industry-wide, Marathon’s statistics
show that various companies have attempted to install 1,001 modules with
984 successfully installed in 96 wells. In
firing attempts, only 23 modules of 946
did not fire (97.6% firing success).
For horizontal wells, the statistics
show that companies attempted to
install 329 modules and successfully
installed 312 in 32 wells. In firing attempts, 13 of 303 modules did not fire
(95.7% firing success). ✦

O C E S S I N G
As part of a large
operational improvement
program for its refining
and marketing division,
Eni SPA, with the support
of the Boston Consulting
Refining
Group (BCG), developed
a new strategy for turnaround maintenance of its refineries.
The strategy was implemented in Eni’s
Sannazzaro de’
Burgondi
refinery in
northern
Italy, one
of Europe’s most complex refineries (see box
below).
The new methodology for turnaround maintenance is part of a broader
approach to operational excellence
called “lean refining,” aimed at eliminating waste in refining operations.
Lean refining can help refiners maintain profitability, streamline costs, and
enhance flexibility.
Reducing the complexity of maintenance turnarounds was key to improving the turnaround strategy because
it is the main method for coping

Sannazaro reﬁnery
Eni SPA built its Sannazzaro, Italy, reﬁnery in 1963. It
currently has a primary capacity of more than 170,000 b/d
and a conversion capacity of
46.2%, which makes it one of
the most complex and efﬁcient reﬁneries in Europe.
This reﬁnery supplies northwest Italy and Switzerland
with gasoline, gas oil, kerosine, LPG, and asphalt. Due
to its ﬂexibility, the Sannazzaro reﬁnery can feed a wide
variety of feedstocks, such
as Russian, African, Asiatic,
Caspian, and local crudes.

with recent trends in the engineering,
procurement, and construction (EPC)
industry of higher costs and less available manpower. Lowering the complexity of turnarounds also helps in larger
refineries that have many sophisticated
conversion units.
The new turnaround strategy consists of four major factors:
• Declustering process units.
• Using distributed maintenance for
process-related shutdowns.
• Increasing the intervals between
turnarounds.
• Optimizing the critical maintenance path.

Maintenance trends
Recent refining margins have tended
to fluctuate, in turn threatening refining
profitability. Many companies, therefore,
are implementing efficiency projects to
reduce fixed costs to remain profitable
in low-margin environments.
Maintenance costs, including routine
maintenance and turnarounds, account
for 35-45% of fixed costs for a typical
refinery. Three factors influence maintenance operations and costs for refiners.
First, the EPC industry is experiencing record-level backlogs and skyrocketing costs. Second, the average refinery
size is increasing to enhance scale
economies. Third, a greater need for
high conversion rates requires the use
of sophisticated, difficult-to-maintain
units.

Unit declustering
Due to the characteristics of the Sannazzaro refinery, our original strategy
was based on a turnaround cycle with
two major, complex shutdown clusters
involving more than 1,000 full-time
employees each and an average of 10
units. The new turnaround strategy
aimed to minimize the number of units
down at the same time, which defined
four smaller unit clusters with an average of five units each with an average of
600 full-time contractors (Fig. 1).
This reduced the number of external
contractors involved in a given turn-

The new strategy was implemented as a
pilot project in the Sannazzaro refinery,
which is Eni’s top performing refinery
in terms of maintenance costs. It is in
the top end of the first quartile in Solomon benchmarking.
Turnaround maintenance costs
decreased about 15% (Fig. 2), and a
significant reduction in downtime occurred in many units. Hydrocracking
downtime, for example, decreased 6
days/year (Table 2).
The new strategy, given the small
size of the turnaround, enhances the
flexibility to easily anticipate or defer
shutdowns to exploit opportunities due
to market fluctuations—shutting down
when margins are low and keeping the
refinery running when margins are
high.

• Big size in terms of capacity or
conversion, resulting in a compelling
need to limit shutdown complexity
through a turnaround strategy based on
having relatively small clusters of units
down at the same time.
• A significant number of units that
have process-related shutdowns, such
as hydrocrackers, desulfurization units,
or catalytic reformers, in which the
distributed maintenance approach can
be beneficial.
• A shortage of skilled external
workers; this encourages smaller shutdowns to achieve a workforce with an
adequate level of technical skills.
Given the current trends of the
refining industry, in which almost all
the grassroots projects have a planned
capacity of at least 250,000-400,000
b/d and demand is continuously shifting towards middle distillates, many
refineries around the world can apply
this concept. ✦

CASPIAN NATURAL
GAS—Conclusion

The routes Kazakhstan
could use to export its
natural gas resources are
of interest to both potential customers and the
region’s other producers.
Pipelines
Kazakhstan’s large
natural gas reserves and
limited domestic demand make the
country an increasingly important potential supplier to consuming
countries in both Europe and
Asia. Its geographic position,
meanwhile, makes it a potential transit nation for natural
gas supplies moving from
Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan
to Europe.

designed to export Kazakh natural gas.

14 billion cu m/year to other European
consumers. Conflict between Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan over both gas
share in the proposed pipeline and the
division of Caspian hydrocarbon fields
crippled the project.
Subsequent attempts by the littoral
states to resolve the legal status of the
Caspian Sea have failed, apart from a
2002 bilateral agreement between Russia and Kazakhstan on the division of
Caspian hydrocarbon fields. Turkmenistan and Iran initially denounced the
Russian-Kazakh agreement as contravening their legal rights, while Azerbaijan welcomed the deal.
Advancement of the Nabucco pipeline project has also helped reinvigorate European and US interest in the
Trans-Caspian pipeline. The proposed
3,300-km Nabucco pipeline would run

gas hub at Baumgarten. At Erzurum

RWE (Germany), and Botas (Turkey),
with each company holding a 16.67%
stake. OMV leads the consortium. Gaz
de France, the national oil company of
Azerbaijan, and Kazmunaigaz (Kazakhstan) have all since expressed interest in
joining the project.
Potential gas volumes for Nabucco
could come from a variety of countries,
including Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and
Kazakhstan as well as Iran, Iraq, and
other Persian Gulf producers. Political
instability in the Middle East increases
the likelihood gas volumes for Nabucco
would come only from Central Asian
suppliers.
Kazakhstan could become the entry
point for Central Asian gas supplies
shipped by the Trans-Caspian gas
pipeline (TCGP) from Aktau on Kazakhstan’s Caspian coast (near Tengiz field)
to Baku, Azerbaijan. The TCGP could
connect there to the South Caucasus gas
pipeline. The Kazakhstan section of the
TCGP would also connect via Turkmenbashi to Turkmenistan’s Caspian fields.
TCGP would cover 1,592 km (about
989 miles), including onshore sections
in Kazakhstan (600 km), Azerbaijan and
Turkey (Baku to Erzurum, 692 km), and
the 300-km offshore section crossing
the Caspian Sea. Nominal capacity of 20
billion cu m/year could expand to 30
billion cu m/year.
Alternative methods of delivering
gas from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan
include:2
• LNG.
• Compressed natural gas.
• Gas-to-liquids.
Several issues mitigate against
construction of the Trans-Caspian and
Nabucco pipelines; competition from
other projects, Russia’s well-known
opposition to these projects and Central
Asia’s participation in them, and the still
unclear legal status of the Caspian Sea.
Gazprom and Italian ENI signed
a memorandum of understanding
to build the 900-km South Stream
pipeline in June 2007. The companies
say construction will take 3 years following EU approval. The pipeline will
run from the Russian Black Sea coast

to Varna, Bulgaria, and then in two
directions: to Greece and southern Italy
(southwestern route), and through
Serbia and Hungary to Austria (northwestern route). The pipeline’s planned
capacity is 30 billion cu m/year. The
successful pursuit of South Stream, to
be fed by the Caspian Littoral pipeline
discussed in Part 1 of this article (OGJ,
Jan. 5, 2009, p. 56) could work against
completion of both TCGP and Nabucco.
The accompanying table summarizes
currently discussed Central Asian natural
gas pipeline projects.

Legal status
Apart from any questions regarding its economic viability, the proposed
pipeline faces difficulties stemming
from the uncertain territorial status of
the Caspian Sea.
Only two Caspian littoral sates—Iran
and the Soviet Union—existed before
the 1991 collapse of the latter. The
two signed bilateral treaties regarding
the Caspian Sea in 1921 and 1940 but
never established seabed boundaries or
held consultations regarding oil and
natural gas exploration in the area.
The primary current problem centers
on whether to define the Caspian as an
inland lake or a sea. If defined as a sea,
the Law of the Sea Convention would
apply and both full maritime boundaries and mineral rights of the five states
would be established accordingly.
The Law of the Sea, however, does
not apply to inland lakes, requiring that
the Caspian either be developed jointly
or that surrounding states reach agreements regarding its development.
An agreement on the legal status of
the Caspian Sea will require not only
Russian but also Iranian participation.
The latter is highly unlikely given current tensions between Iran and the US.
Russia has already voiced its concerns
about the possible environmental effects
of a Trans-Caspian gas pipeline and demands all Caspian countries be consulted before such a project commences.
Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan must also
reach a consensus with Turkmenistan
regarding the division of hydrocar-

bon resources in the area, contested
since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Kazakhstan signed a hydrocarbon
agreement with Russia in 1998 and
Azerbaijan in 2001 but has so far been
unsuccessful in reaching an accord with
Turkmenistan.
Political circumstances also hinder
other potential pipeline routes through
Afghanistan to India and Pakistan or via
Iran into Turkey and Europe (favored by
Kazakhstan). ✦

Oil price extremes
do not repudiate
US ‘deregulation’
A popular belief deserving stern resistance holds that oil price extremes of 2008
justify the revival of aggressive market
regulation.
According to this view, the painful levels
oil prices reached in the ﬁrst half of last
year testiﬁed to the failure of deregulation;
therefore, the government must intensify
its incursion into energy markets.
This reading of things takes a short,

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

skewed view of deregulation.
If price is the only gauge, what might be
called the era of deregulation in the US was
in fact more beneﬁcial than not.
To the extent that the US actually
deregulated energy markets, the legislative and regulatory adjustments occurred
during the 1980s, in the latter half of which,
oil prices crashed.
In the decade of the 1990s, oil prices
remained so low that few observers outside
the oil business took much note of them.
During that period, the annual average
spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude
was $19.72/bbl. The highest annual average
price came in the decade’s ﬁrst year at
$24.53/bbl. The lowest price came toward
the end of the decade, in 1998, at $14.42/
bbl.
If price is the measure, “deregulation”
thus was a very good deal in the 1990s—
for consumers anyway. But the comfort
couldn’t last.
Low prices stimulated oil consumption.
Furthermore, the US never fully deregulated oil and gas markets. It liberated
consumption and prices from controls. But
it continued to cap domestic supply with
restrictive leasing and permitting of federal
land, onshore and off.
While demand rose, domestic supply
didn’t. Imported oil had to make up the
difference. And US buyers increasingly
had to compete for oil in trade with buyers
elsewhere as global demand increased
in response to economic and population
growth.
So prices in the current decade have
risen. They have averaged nearly $50/bbl so
far in a strongly upward trend that ended
last July.
The price zoom reﬂects the pressure of
demand expansion against physical and
regulatory limits on capacities to bring oil
to market.
If there has been a failure of deregulation in the US, it’s that the process never
applied fully to supply.

by Paula Dittrick, Senior Staff Writer

Oil prices climb in early 2009
Crude oil futures prices started off 2009 with positive movement on New York and
London markets amid rising geopolitical tensions.
Most analysts agree that markets are unconvinced the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries can cut production fast enough to offset plummeting demand
for oil.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said violence in the Middle East and disputes between Russia and Ukraine provided support for higher oil prices in very early 2009.
“Oil prices have started the year on a strong note,” Barclays analysts said. “While
the violence in the Gaza strip does not affect any oil supplies directly, the market
fears involvement from other countries like Iran could aggravate the situation,” they
added. On Jan. 4, an Iranian military commander suggested Islamic countries cut oil
exports, Barclays said, adding, “This is unlikely to echo far in gulf countries already
engaged in sharp cuts to support prices.” Saboteurs in the Niger Delta used dynamite to partially destroy an oil pipeline operated by Eni SPA subsidiary Agip.
Agip issued no immediate comment on the scale of damage caused by the attack,
which hit the Odimodi-Ogulagha part the pipeline in Nigeria’s Delta state. No group
immediately claimed responsibility.
More volatility likely
Volatility was the key word for oil prices last year.
Oil prices rebounded Dec. 31 with the front-month crude gaining more than $5/
bbl to settle at $44.60/bbl in light trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
NYMEX oil prices peaked at about $147/bbl in July 2008 before tumbling upon a
US credit crisis and a worldwide economic slump. In December 2008, oil prices on
NYMEX dipped to below $34/bbl, marking the lowest price in more than 4 years.
Barclays’ analyst Paul Horsnell noted, “Consensus is a process in which analysts
try to look sensible and reliable, when reality tends not to be a sensible phenomenon and, in this decade at least, has involved shredding every single element of oil
market consensus.” So far this decade, consensus by analysts has tended to overestimate supply from outside OPEC. Analysts also were both high and low on their oil
demand forecasts, Horsnell said.
He said, “So that gives us our ﬁrst forecast for 2009…that consensus is way,
way, way wrong in terms of supply, demand, and price. Forecast number two is that
prices will as ever both overshoot and undershoot and, as in 2008, will be driven
primarily by often sharp changes in perceptions and data ﬂow about supply and
demand conditions.”
US to boost oil inventories
The US Department of Energy said it will start buying oil to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. SPR was heavily drawn down following Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita in 2005. From May 2008 through yearend, DOE was prohibited by law from
buying oil for SPR. DOE plans to buy 12 million bbl of crude. Deliveries are being
sought for February, March, and April. “DOE plans to take advantage of the recent
sharp decline in crude oil prices to enter the market,” said a DOE release issued
Jan. 2. For the week ended Dec. 26, 2008, US crude inventories rose by 500,000 bbl
to 318.7 million bbl, the US Energy Information Administration reported. Gasoline
inventories rose by 800,000 bbl to 208.1 million bbl.
US reﬁneries ran at 82.5% of total capacity on average, a drop of 2.2% from the
previous week. Distillate inventories rose by 700,000 bbl to 136 million bbl.
Separately, in its report on US natural gas inventories in underground storage,
EIA reported a withdrawal of 143 bcf to 2.88 tcf for the week ended Dec. 26, 2008. The
level was above the 5-year average of 2.82 tcf but lags last year’s storage level of
2.95 tcf for the same period. Pritchard Capital analysts said, “The gas market seems
poised to reset itself,” in a process that includes shutting in some production and a
more than a 30% drop in the number of active land rigs in the US. They see “a 4-6
month lag time before recent well decline rates translate into production volume
decreases,” adding, “We may see gas prices around $5/Mcf before things get better.”
They also perceive a shift from a supply-constrained market to a demand-constrained market for LNG. “Global LNG prices on the spot market seem to be stabilizing [at] $8-9/MMbtu in the Atlantic Basin and in the $11-12 range in the Paciﬁc Basin.”
With prices at the Henry Hub, La., spot market “well below the prices a year ago,”
LNG terminals at Lake Charles, La., and at Sabine Pass and Freeport in Texas remain
inactive, analysts said.

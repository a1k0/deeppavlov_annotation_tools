COVER
A fiber-delivered diode laser clads drilling tools with Lasercarb
powder through a coaxial nozzle at a Technogenia plant in SaintJorioz, France. A computer control system allows precise cladding
on complex surfaces to enhance wear and corrosion resistance of
downhole equipment. An article on laser cladding begins OGJ’s
Modern Materials special report on p. 43.The next article,
beginning on p. 52, discusses advanced fiber-reinforced polymer
composites that offer new options for completing deep wells with
high temperatures and pressures and corrosive fluids.The final

Kazakhstan may extend Kashagan suspension order
The Kazakh government has threatened to extend its suspension
order of work at Kashagan oil field if the Eni SPA-led consortium
does not address the operational issues hindering the project.
Kazakhstan stopped the group from continuing work at Kashagan on Aug. 27 claiming breach of environmental standards, cost
overruns, and delays (OGJ Online, Aug. 28, 2007).
Analysts have interpreted the action as a move to gain higher
revenues from the project.
Production, planned to start in 2005, has been postponed to
2010. Eni has suggested that operational costs could rise to $136
billion from $57 billion. The group plans to develop the field by
drilling about 280 wells and building offshore platforms and artificial islands.
According to media reports, the Kazakh authorities are now
pressing the consortium to propose “an adequate compensation”
and reforms in the structure of the deal by Sept. 5 to drive its future
implementation.
Kazakhstan has said that it is prepared to change the operator
if need be, but this does not necessarily mean appointing state oil
company KazMunaiGaz as the replacement. However, even if KazMunaiGaz took control, the issue is whether it has the technical
experience or financial resources to manage the field efficiently.
Kashagan is an important project for future non-OPEC oil supplies to the West, which is trying to persuade Kazakhstan to direct
Caspian oil away from Russia, China, or Iran.

revisions of the standard.”

BLM seeks comments for northeastern NPR-A
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is soliciting public
comment on its draft supplemental environmental impact statement to address proposed oil and gas activities in the northeastern
portion of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) area.
The public comment period on the draft document is scheduled for Aug. 24-Oct. 23, a BLM release said. The northeastern NPRA area covers 4.6 million acres.
The public comment is part of a mandatory process as outlined
in the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA). BLM anticipates a possible NPR-A lease sale in the second half of 2008, but no
definite date will be set pending completion of the NEPA process, a
BLM spokeswoman in Anchorage told OGJ on Aug. 29.
Tom Lonnie, BLM-Alaska state director, said the supplemental
plan will allow the agency to consider the lands appropriate for
leasing “and the restrictions we should place on exploration and
development that will result in petroleum production while protecting the area’s important resources.”
BLM began developing the supplement in December 2006 in
response to a Sept. 25, 2006, ruling from the US District Court
for the District of Alaska that stated the 2005 northeastern NPR-A
amended integrated activity plan-EIS failed to adequately address
cumulative impacts.

NPRA: Keep primary ozone standard

Nicaragua taxes Esso, embargoes assets

The National Petrochemical & Refiners Association supports keeping the primary ozone standard in US clean-air regulations, NPRA
environment director David Friedman testified Aug. 30 before a US
Environmental Protection Agency hearing in Philadelphia.
EPA is considering lowering the National Ambient Air Quality
Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone to 0.07 ppm from 0.08
ppm, said Alison Davis, EPA spokeswoman for air and radiation.
Some environmentalists and medical experts support a stricter
standard of 0.06 ppm. But Friedman said changing the NAAQS is
unnecessary.
“Many states have not yet completed plans to attain the current
standard, so EPA should focus on helping communities meet the
current standard,” Friedman said. NPRA members have worked to
improve air quality, and they acknowledge the efforts undertaken
by the EPA, state governments, and local communities, Friedman
said.
“The science behind lowering the standard is uncertain and
variable, and therefore this is not the right time to change it,” he
said. “There are many questions regarding the state of the science
and, in particular, whether or not there have been any significant

Nicaragua’s vice-president has ordered Esso Standard Oil to pay
$3 million in taxes on allegedly undeclared oil imports, while a
judge has embargoed the company’s assets.
Vice-President Jaime Morales Carazo said transnational companies are not exempt from paying such taxes, a claim Esso denies.
Esso spokesman Alfredo Fernandez said the company owes no taxes
because the importation of oil into Nicaragua is tax-exempt by
national law.
The Superior Council of Private Business sent a letter to Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega saying that the tax claim and embargo “could damage the image of his government and the nation,
which needs so much investment.”
The US Embassy in Nicaragua said the move has the potential
to seriously damage economic relations between the US and Nicaragua.
Ortega has been negotiating with Venezuela President Hugo
Chavez to import and refine Venezuelan crude oil. Last month,
Chavez and Ortega launched construction of a 150,000 b/d refinery in Piedras Blancas, near Nicaragua’s Pacific coast (OGJ Online,
July 23, 2007). ✦

Development

ConocoPhillips makes gas ﬁnd with Harrison well
Operator ConocoPhillips has discovered a 16-m gas column
in the lower Ketch formation of its Harrison exploration well
(44/19b-6) in the UK southern North Sea.
The well reached a TD of 4,289 m and will be flow tested with
results expected later this month. Harrison is 20 km to the northeast of the Murdoch platform. All of the drilling was completed
ahead of schedule and under budget.
Aidan Heavey, chief executive of Tullow Oil PLC, a partner in the
well, said early assessment of the well’s data show that it is in line
with the company’s predrill expectations.

Petrobras to boost Amazon gas exploration
Brazil’s state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) plans to step
up exploration for natural gas in the Amazon rainforest, according
to a senior company official.
Petrobras plans to launch gas production in 2008 from its Urucu field in northern Amazonas state, where it produces 50,000 b/d
of oil, said director of exploration and production Guilherme Estrella on Sept. 3.
Estrella said Urucu field will help meet gas demand growth by
2012 and that Petrobras has a 20-year agreement to supply 5.5
million cu m/day of gas to Amazonas state.

Drilling

&

Petrobras plans to drill 23 wells in the Solimoes basin by 2012, he
said. Major projects will include Jurua, Jaraqui, and Sao Mateus fields.
Meanwhile, Estrella forecast lower production for Petrobras
than earlier predicted. Petrobras’s average oil output will stand at
about 1.85 million b/d in 2007, down from the earlier target of
1.919 million b/d, Estrella said.
The reduced output resulted from operational problems with
platforms P-34, P-50, P-43, and P-48. According to Estrella, however, most problems have been resolved.

Final notice issued for central gulf sale
The US Minerals Management Service issued a final notice for
central Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf Lease Sale 205,
which covers 28.5 million acres of submerged land in federal waters off Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The sale will be held
Oct. 3 in New Orleans.
Sale 205 offers about 5,000 blocks 3-224 miles offshore in 1211,200 ft of water in what is the newly configured central Gulf of
Mexico OCS Planning Area.
Sale 205 is the first central gulf lease sale in the agency’s 200712 OCS leasing program.
MMS estimates the sale could result in the production of 0.7761.292 billion bbl of oil and 3.236-5.229 tcf of natural gas. ✦

Production

Alabama strat trap oil ﬁeld still growing
A southern Alabama oil field with a unique trapping mechanism is still under development after having become the state’s
largest producing field in 2005.
Midroc Operating Co., private Dallas independent, has drilled
more than 40 wells into the Little Cedar Creek field Jurassic Smackover limestone reservoir since becoming operator of the field in
May 2000. Hunt Oil Co., Dallas, discovered the field in Conecuh
County in 1994.
The field is near the updip limit of the Smackover formation,
and the trapping mechanism is interpreted as stratigraphic, the
Alabama Oil & Gas Board reports. There is no faulting or structural closure based on current well control, and the Smackover
displays monoclinal dip to the southwest at a rate of 200 ft/
mile.
“This trapping mechanism is unique among Jurassic reservoirs throughout the entire Gulf Coast region,” the board said.
The discovery well, Cedar Creek Land & Timber Co. 30-1, in
30-4n-12e, 10 miles southeast of Evergreen, Ala., went to a TD
of 12,100 ft. It flowed 108 b/d of oil and 49 Mcfd of gas on
a 12⁄64-in. choke with 248 psi flowing tubing pressure from the
Smackover.
Subsequent drilling by Midroc on 160-acre spacing has expanded the field limits to include more than 10,000 acres in 4n-12e and
4n-13e. Development continues mainly to the northeast.
Little Cedar Creek field produced 1.17 million bbl of oil in 2005
and 1.64 million bbl in 2006, helping reverse the state’s declining

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

oil production trend, the board noted.
The Smackover pool “consists of two main porosity zones separated by a dense nonproductive zone.” The pool is officially defined
as Smackover strata between 11,490 ft and 11,580 ft in the Pugh
22-2 well in 22-4n-12e.

Amerisur moves rig to Colombia’s Putumayo basin
Colombia’s state-owned Ecopetrol SA has authorized mobilization of the Pride-17 drilling rig to the Platanillo block in Colombia’s Putumayo basin, reported partner Amerisur Resources
PLC.
Platanillo is an “advanced project with near-term production
potential,” said Amerisur chief executive officer John Wardle. The
firm said rig mobilization will take about 3 weeks and that it expects the well to spud in early to mid-September, followed by testing and results in October.
The rig will drill a second well, Platanillo-2, immediately following the drilling of Platanillo-1, Amerisur said. The location of
Platanillo-2 will depend on results obtained in Platanillo-1. Subject
to the possibility of additional civil works, it is expected that Platanillo-2 will be spudded in October.
The firm said negotiations are continuing regarding the acquisition of an increased working interest in the Platanillo contract. The
current stakeholders are operator Ecopetrol 40%, Repsol YPF SA
35%, and Amerisur 25%.

start-up at the Long Lake oil sands development 200 miles north of
Edmonton, Alta. and increased the project’s capital cost by 10-15%
above the previous forecast of $5.3 billion.
Nexen said the sulfur recovery unit is slated for completion in
first quarter 2008 because of lower than expected labor productivity and difficulties securing sufficient labor, particularly pipefitters,
to work on the sulfur recovery unit, said Charlie Fischer, Nexen’s
president and chief executive. The pace of commissioning activities
also is slower than expected, he added.
However he said the work is almost complete, and the company
expects to have sufficient laborers for all remaining activities.
Progress on other units of the upgrader also has been slower
than expected. Completion of the hydrocracker, the OrCrude unit,
and all main plant utilities are expected in the third quarter of
this year and the gasifier and air separation units, in the fourth
quarter.
Commissioning has commenced on the utility steam boilers,

Processing
NPRA: US reﬁning capacity climbed 0.6% in 2006
US refining capacity grew 0.6% during 2006 to 17.4 million
b/cd of distillation capacity and 18.4 million b/sd as of Jan. 1,
reported the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association Aug. 22
in its annual refining and storage capacity report. The figures exclude capacity in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
The trend of adding capacity to existing refineries has continued, said NPRA Executive Vice-Pres. Charles T. Drevna. “While it’s
true that a brand new refinery hasn’t been built since 1976, we’ve
actually, on the aggregate, built the equivalent of one new worldclass refinery each year for the past 14 years,” he said.
Capacity at 149 operable US refineries at the beginning of this
year was 3.9% higher than 5 years earlier and 12.9% higher than
at the beginning of 1997, according to NPRA, which used figures
compiled by the US Energy Information Administration in its 2007
Petroleum Supply Annual.
However Drevna said expanding domestic capacity has become
more challenging because of more-stringent regulations, and the
permitting process remains complex and uncertain.
Policymakers also send conflicting signals when they call for
more capacity on one hand and 20% cuts in gasoline consumption
over 10 years on the other, he observed.
“Refiners make their reinvestments today based on where they
see demand headed. If policymakers take actions that significantly
decrease consumption, domestic refiners will naturally consider
the wisdom of investing in new capacity or facilities only to have
those investments stranded in a decade or less,” Drevna said.

Sinopec, CNPC plan 30 reﬁneries in China
China Petrochemical Corp. (Sinopec) and China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) are expanding their refining facilities to ease
the country’s tight oil supply, according to media reports.
China’s eobserver.com said Sinopec is scheduled to add and
enlarge some 20 refineries with 10 million ton/year production

with start-up expected during the third quarter.
Full start-up of the upgrader is now expected to begin in the
first and second quarters of 2008.
Commissioning and start up of the steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) plant and wells is under way. The company currently is
injecting steam into 4 of the 10 well pads and expects to be steaming all well pads by the end of September.
“SAGD performance at Long Lake is as expected or slightly better, and we expect bitumen production to ramp up to full rates over
the next 12-24 months” Fischer said.
Production of synthetic crude oil is expected late in secondquarter 2008. The company expects the upgrader to reach full production capacity 12-18 months after start-up.
“We expect to produce synthetic crude oil at Long Lake for several decades and benefit from a significant operating cost advantage,” Fischer said. Despite the increase in capital costs, “project
returns from Long Lake at current commodity prices are higher
than [was] expected at the time of sanctioning.” ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
capacity in the next 2-3 years, while CNPC plans to set up 10 refineries, each also having a production capacity of 10 million tons/
year.
The financial daily said with completion of the 30 plants, China
will have to import more oil because the country’s current output
of 200 million tons of crude has reached its peak. Now, it said, 50%
of China’s domestic crude oil consumption relies on imports.
Eobserver.com said Sinopec Group’s planned refineries will be
built in South and East China, especially in the relatively developed
southern areas, where “the strong economic engines are in urgent
need of more energy.”
It said CNPC will mainly set up its new plants in West China and
Northeast China, with plans calling for facilities in Daqing, Fushun,
Jinzhou, Huludao, Dalian, Lanzhou, and Xinjiang.

Brazil starts work on Abreu e Lima reﬁnery
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Sept. 4 officially
launched construction on the $4.05 billion Abreu e Lima refinery
outside Recife, the largest city in northeastern Brazil and the capital
of Pernambuco state.
Noticeably absent from the proceedings were any representatives of Venezuela’s state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA),
formerly identified as a 40% partner in the refinery project, with
Brazil state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) holding the
remaining 60%.
Under a memorandum of understanding between the two state
oil companies, the new refinery is expected to process oil from
Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt and from Marlim field in the Campos basin off Brazil, with each country supplying 50% of the crude oil.
The agreement, however, appears to have hit an impasse over
the terms of Petrobras’s proposed participation in a project to develop Venezuela’s Carabobo field, which was to provide Caracas’
share of the oil to be processed at the refinery.
With negotiations over the field continuing, Petrobras said
that by second half 2010 the refinery will begin to refine about

200,000 b/d of heavy oil to annually produce 814,000 cu m of
petrochemical naphtha, 322,000 tons of LPG, 8.8 million tons of
diesel fuel, and 1.4 million tons of oil coke. The products will be
marketed locally and in northern-northeastern Brazil.
Petrobras said the refinery’s main production focus is on diesel fuel, particularly aimed at supplying the increased demand for

derivatives in the northeastern region, which currently is fuel-deficient. The unit will be the first in Brazil to process 100% heavy
oil.
In addition, the Abreu e Lima refinery will be capable of producing low-sulfur content derivatives and will be able to comply
even with the strict European standards, which specify maximum
emission limits of 10 ppm of sulfur. ✦

Fluxys doubling Zeebrugge LNG terminal capacity
Fluxys LNG has received an €85 million loan from the European Investment Bank toward its program to double the capacity of
the Zeebrugge LNG regasification terminal to 6.6 million tonnes/
year. The increased capacity is fully booked on a long-term basis,
the company said.
Fluxys is adding extra regasification infrastructure and a fourth
LNG storage tank under a €165 million investment plan. “Construction works for the capacity increase are nearing completion,”
Fluxys said. Commissioning is expected to start at yearend.
The loan means that parent company Fluxys can optimize its
resources for other infrastructure projects in gas transport and storage.
EIB said it granted the loan because it considers the expansion a
priority for Europe in securing competitive and sustainable energy
supplies.
“The investment will contribute to increase, secure, and diversify gas supplies to the EU, as imported gas from Zeebrugge can
easily be moved to the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxemburg,
and France. Environmental benefits will be felt from the completion of this project as well, since it will allow the use of larger volumes of natural gas to replace less environmentally sound fuels,”
Fluxys said.
Fluxys LNG, with a 93.20% stake, is owner and operator of the
Zeebrugge terminal.

Lukoil completes section of Khauzak pipeline
Lukoil Uzbekistan, a subsidiary of Lukoil Overseas, has completed a 45-km section of 711-mm (28-in.) gas pipeline on the
Khauzak block in southwestern Uzbekistan. The line will enable
sour gas to be delivered to a tie-in point on the Dengizkul-Mubarek
main pipeline.
The line is part of the Kandym-Khauzak-Shady-Kungrad project, which involves the drilling of more than 180 development
wells and construction of more than 1,500 km of pipeline and two
compressor stations (OGJ Online, July 10, 2007).
The project also involves construction of an 8 billion cu m/year
gas processing plant in the Kandym area.
The main gas pipeline for Khauzak gas field will be commissioned at yearend, Lukoil said.

Work starts on Turkmenistan-China gas line
Construction has started on a 7,000-km pipeline that will deliver 30 billion cu m/year of gas from Turkmenistan to China starting in 2009.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov attended
a ceremony at which he made a symbolic weld on the pipeline,
which will cross Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
About 188 km of the pipeline will be laid in Turkmenistan, 530 km
in Uzbekistan, 1,300 km in Kazakhstan, and over 4,500 km in China.
China plans to import 30 billion cu m/year of Turkmen gas for 30
years through the pipeline but has not given the value of the deal.
China National Petroleum Corp. has received exploration rights
for Bagtiyarlik territory.
“Turkmenistan is granting a foreign country the right to produce gas on the mainland for the first time,” Berdimuhamedov
said.
The president, who came to power last December following the
death of his predecessor, has welcomed foreign investment in his
country’s oil and gas industry (OGJ Online, June 15, 2007).

DNV proposes study for Arctic pipeline standards
Det Norske Veritas is proposing a joint industry project (JIP)
to evaluate design methods and recommendations for installation,
operation, and maintenance of offshore pipelines in Arctic regions.
It also would establish a common practice for addressing the challenges of such operations, which includes ice interaction with surface and subsea offshore installations.
The final results of the JIP will be published as the Recommended Practice (RP) for ‘Arctic Offshore Pipelines,’ DNV said.
The project could begin by yearend 2007 or early 2008 and is
expected to take 18-24 months to complete.
The estimated costs are 400 kroner ($68,000)/operator and
200 kroner ($34,000)/contractor.
“Operators, regulators, designers, pipeline contractors, specialists, research institutions, and universities are invited to participate
in the JIP, both through funding and through work-in-kind contributions,” said Catherine Jahre-Nilsen, DNV’s project manager.
The areas tentatively identified for the RP to address include
design philosophy and design principles; design concepts; routing;
line pipe; ice interaction loads (simple and advanced approaches;
pipeline protection; fabrication and installation; and operation, inspection, and repair.
The RP will be an official code for use by pipeline operators and
designers, and will present a common and documented approach
that supplements the requirements of DNV-OS-F101 (offshore
standards for submarine pipeline systems) and other internationally recognized pipeline codes.
It will be subsequently updated and maintained to reflect ongoing research and development, future JIPs, and project experience. ✦

Damon and Bourne
Thanks so much for your Editor’s Perspective on actor Matt Damon’s appearance in a video calling for government
energy solutions (OGJ, Aug. 13, 2007, p.
80). My family and I are all huge Jason
Bourne fans (before he was so cool and
so stunningly cast in Damon; we read all
the books). I share the sad disillusionment you describe in Damon’s behavior
and his apparently shallow understanding of the petroleum and synfuels industries (as well as how Congress really
works).
As you and OGJ readers know, Damon’s behavior only serves to illustrate
the pervasive and profound ignorance
of the average American in both areas,
as well as basic economics. Obviously,
major improvements in American fuel
efficiency need to be made; however, the
market will drive this if the American
people begin to grow up: How many of
us really need a big truck, a Hummer, a
great-room-sized SUV, or a 6,000 sq ft
home? Personal responsibility and intelligent consumption, not just legislative
mandates, must also play their role.
The simplistic “solutions” Damon
(and Ben Affleck, who does not impress
me) dramatized, and failing to acknowledge the shortcomings of a “corn solution” taken too far, are enough to make
even a die-hard Damon fan question his
intelligence (Damon’s, not the fan’s). The
fan in me wants to believe he’s smarter
than that. A full suite of energy, technology, education, and market solutions is
the path to a cleaner, more stable American energy future.
So: Still love the movies, still think
he’s a brilliant actor, but he needs to
become better informed if he is going to
dabble in such public activism. Offer to
take him to lunch and give him a short
course, why don’t you?

Alberta’s royalty review
Months of uncertainty for Canada’s oil sands
industry soon will end. That’s the good news.
How uncertainty over the Albertan fiscal regime
will end remains, well, uncertain. And that could
be bad news far outside the region that leads the
world in production of bitumen and synthetic
crude oil.
Last February, Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach
formed an independent panel to study the royalty
and tax regime “to ensure Albertans are receiving
a fair share from energy development through
royalties, taxes, and fees.” Initially, the panel was
to make its final report by Aug. 31. The web site of
the Alberta Royalty Review Panel now says recommendations will go to the government by midSeptember.

Producers worry
Except where participation terms are onerous
and can only improve, producers worry when
governments talk about adjusting fiscal regimes.
Production investments expose capital to heavy
risk for a long time and are sensitive to, among
other things, the rates and timing of payments to
governments.
For Alberta’s burgeoning oil sands industry,
hints of change come at a bad time. Capital and
operating costs, which technology had lowered
impressively, have spurted lately in a development
boom. Profit margins, never lavish in a business
with high production costs and low product values, are feeling the squeeze. And the industry faces
new uncertainty from federal regulations under
development covering emissions of greenhouse
gases.
The provincial government knows what’s at
stake for Alberta. A fact sheet from the review
panel notes the province collected a record $14.3
billion (Can.) from nonrenewable-resource activity in the 2005-06 fiscal year—nearly 40% of all
provincial revenue. It projects nonrenewable-resource receipts in 2006-07 of $11.7 billion. Of
that, $3.7 billion will be from oil sands royalties
and lease bonuses. The panel also acknowledges
that bitumen from oil sands will claim a growing
share of future production as conventional oil and
gas output declines.
In the system under review, producers pay
lease bonuses and rentals plus royalties that vary

by production type. For conventional oil and gas,
the royalty rate depends on variables that include
vintage, well productivity, and commodity price.
In 2005, average royalty rates were 15% of production for conventional oil and 20% for gas. For
oil sands, the royalty rate is 1% of gross revenue
until a project recovers invested capital plus a
financial allowance. After payout, the royalty rate is
the greater of 25% of net revenue or 1% of gross
revenue.
According to speculation, the review panel
might propose an increase of a percentage point or
two in the oil sands royalty rate, possibly accompanied by an easing of the bite on conventional
production. Such a change probably would delay
some oil sands projects, perhaps permanently.
Labor and material shortages already hamper oil
sands work. Further delays might poison the economics of some projects.
More important than immediate effects on current plans, however, would be the appearance that
Alberta used price elevation as an excuse to grab
money. Precedents like that chill investment. The
government might avoid trouble by leaving the
royalty rate alone and focusing instead, if it must
change anything, on how rising costs hurt it along
with producers by extending payout periods.

Beyond Alberta
Alberta’s royalty reform is important well
beyond provincial borders. Canada isn’t the only
place with unconventional oil. It just has a larger
identified heavy-oil resource and produces more
bitumen than any other country. It thus leads the
world in finding solutions to problems heavy-oil
producers elsewhere eventually must face, such
as lowering inputs of energy—especially natural
gas—and water, handling wastes and byproducts,
and controlling emissions of greenhouse gases.
Producers should have no quarrel with Stelmach’s assertion that “Albertans must be confident
that the royalty structure will meet the needs of
the province.” Indeed, if that confidence has weakened then the royalty review is much in order. But
there’s more at stake than loonies in the treasury.
The oil sands of Alberta aren’t just yielding bitumen; they’re generating knowledge and knowhow crucial to future supply of affordable energy.
In that, everyone on Earth has an interest. ✦

Some have argued that refiners’
recent high income levels are excessive.
However, oil refining is a highly capitalintensive industry needing large profits
to compensate companies for huge
investments. Thus, it is important to put
these profits in the context of returns
on investment (ROI) compared with
other investment opportunities.
The rates of return on fixed investment in US

ROI for the companies earned from foreign refining averaged more than 13%,
almost double that for US refining.
Fig. 1 compares the ROI in US refining with the ROI in the US durable
goods industry, which was chosen for
comparison because it is a capital-intensive industry that does not include
petroleum, and data were available
through 2006.
Over the 28-year period 1977-2006,
the US durable goods industry earned
a 9.4% average ROI, compared with
7% in refining, while at the same time
having a lower variability in rates of
return. After the 1992 recession, refining struggled to return to historical ROI
levels, while durable goods rebounded
much more quickly. Even in 2001, after
a decade of cost-cutting, consolidation,
and restructuring, US refining had not
approached the peak ROI being earned
in US durable goods. Durable goods
returns fell dramatically in 2001, and
refining followed in 2002. Only since
2004 has a strong market provided returns in US refining and marketing that
exceed the 1990 highs earned in the
durable goods industry.

Gasoline inventories

Market concentration

Critics of US refiners have argued
that during the period 1990-2005,

During 1998-2002, as many as
14 oil companies merged into 7. The

20

perception is that these mergers and acquisitions increased concentration and
market power in refining. However, the
evidence suggests otherwise. In 1996,
only 16 large companies owned and
operated 65% of US refinery capacity,
but by 2001 their share had fallen to
44%. The percentage of refineries held
by the top eight firms fell by almost
10% during 2002-05, suggesting that
entry into this industry is not so difficult.
One reason for declining concentration has been the move by major oil
companies away from vertical integration by spinning off less-profitable
refining assets to concentrate
on production. Shifts towards high-volume gasoFig. 3
line stations and increasing
hypermarket sales are also
believed to have increased
competition within the
industry.

Futures markets role
What role, if any, does the
futures market play in elevating gasoline prices?
Critics argue that speculation in financial commodity
markets has bid up the gasoline futures price, which in
turn has bid up the gasoline
spot price. Gasoline futures
contracts typically are used
to lock in prices. More than
99% of contracts do not go to delivery,
and many traders who are not in the
gasoline business purchase contracts
hoping to make a profit.
Between fall 2003 and 2005, gasoline futures activity increased to levels
not seen since 1993. Historically, about
90% of futures contracts have been
held by hedgers or commercial traders
in the oil industry, with speculators or
noncommercials not in the oil industry holding about 10%. In 2003-05,
however, the ratio of noncommercial
contract holders doubled to 20%, and
most of this increase was in buying
contracts (going long).
Critics argue that the actions of these

speculators have destabilized the market.
Others have claimed that speculators
bid up prices by going long in futures.
Most economists, however, believe that
noncommercials help provide liquidity
to the market and allow commercials to
shed risk, thereby stabilizing the market
and providing advance signals about
capacity needs. This would suggest that
the increased volume of 2003-05 reflected increased uncertainty that drove
both hedgers and speculators into the
market to transfer risk.
Theoretically, futures and spot markets
are linked as follows: If futures prices
rise relative to the spot price, commercials buy spot for inventory (bidding up
the spot price) and sell futures contracts
(pushing their prices down). The commercials sell off the inventory in the
future, lowering future spot prices. Conversely, if futures prices fall, traders sell
gasoline out of inventory at the current
higher price and buy futures contracts
at lower prices. When traders are right,
they reallocate inventories to periods of
increased shortage and signal refiners
when to increase capacity.
Investors are destabilizing only if
they are wrong. If investors erroneously
expect shortages, then increased inventories today will bid up current prices
but cause inventories to be sold at lower
prices in the future when no real shortage exists. Although this scenario is possible, it is unlikely to persist for long.
Investors who destabilize the market
must buy high and sell low, thus losing
money. Being wrong in such a game is
costly, and market fundamentals quickly
reassert themselves.
Alan Greenspan, former chairman of
the Federal Reserve, asserts that investors and speculators have correctly
identified impending shortages and are
“hastening the adjustment process” in
world oil markets. Academic studies
suggest that the introduction of derivatives reduces price volatility, increases
the speed at which markets incorporate adjustment, and may decrease the
bid/ask spread.
A study by the Commodity Futures
Exchange Commission in 2005 found
22

no link between speculation by hedge
funds and money market traders and
price changes. They concluded that underlying fundamentals, not speculation,
were determining prices.
Gasoline prices may also feed back
to crude oil prices. Increasing gasoline
demand can bid up gasoline prices,
increase crude oil demand, and increase crude oil prices. Such a pattern is
consistent with a market-based increase
in gasoline prices. Many argue that monopoly power has led to high gasoline
prices, which have led to higher crude
prices. This argument, however, is logically inconsistent. If higher gasoline
prices had been caused by monopoly
suppliers withholding capacity, this
would have had the effect of reducing gasoline consumption and crude
oil demand, thus reducing the price of
crude oil.

Market elasticities
When refineries are nearing capacity, gasoline consumption and production are both unresponsive to price in
the short run. There is some evidence
that this responsiveness has become
smaller than it was in the 1970s. This
means that small shifts in demand or
supply have large short-term effects on
prices as shown in the monthly data for
gasoline price and product supplied. It
does not mean that such markets are
not competitive or contestable in the
long run.
The consumer response to prices is
more than 10 times as great in the long
run, when consumers may move closer
to work, drive less, or buy more fuel-

efficient vehicles and hybrids.
Rapidly increasing gasoline imports
suggest that foreign refineries provide
competition, and the rise of large independent refiners in the US suggests that
barriers to entry are not high. Renewable fuels in the form of biodiesel and
ethanol may provide some competition,
but can only be a significant factor if
they are not made from food crops.

Evidence
The simplistic but appealing explanation that mergers, monopolies, and
speculators have caused recent high
gasoline prices and profits is not supported by statistical evidence. The real
reasons have been high crude oil prices,
higher operating costs, proliferating
grades of gasoline, unexpected demand
growth, recovery from low and negative ROI rates in the 1990s, hurricanes,
and regulatory uncertainty. Further, the
evidence suggests that the higher profits
have been accompanied by normal
inventory and investment practices.
A recent assertion that refinery
capacity should be increased by more
than 15% is also not supported by the
evidence and would surely lead to the
pattern of overcapacity and losses that
followed the price increases of the
1970s.

prices for ethanol and crude oil, and
higher-than-expected demand during
summer pushed up prices, the agencies said in their report to US President
George W. Bush.
The determination that the higher
prices resulted from these factors supports a conclusion that no antitrust laws
were broken, they added. The FTC voted
4-1 to issue the report, with Commissioner Jon Leibowitz dissenting.
The report said about 75% of the
spring and summer 2006 national average gasoline price increases resulted
from growing demand leading into the
summer driving season and increased
crude oil and ethanol prices.
“The evidence further indicates
that the remaining 25% of the price
increases stemmed from declines in
the production of gasoline—due to
refiners’ transition to ethanol from
other blending components, persistent
refinery damage related to Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita...and other refinery
outages caused by unexpected events
and required maintenance—coupled
with increased demand,” it said.
While the FTC’s staff would not rule

out other factors, it believed the causes
it cited “adequately explain the 2006
price increases.” It said, “Our targeted
examinations of major refinery outages
revealed no evidence that refiners conspired to restrict supply or otherwise
violated the antitrust laws.”
In his dissent, Leibowitz conceded
that FTC staff members identified some
plausible justifications for the gasoline
price increases. But he warned that the
oil industry, “which posted record profits in 2006,” should not consider the
report vindication for its behavior. “The
question you ask determines the answer
you get. Whatever theoretical justifications exist don’t exclude the real world
threat that there was profiteering at the
expense of customers,” he said.
A congressional critic of the FTC’s
gasoline price oversight approach immediately criticized the report. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.), who chairs the House
Energy and Commerce Committee’s
Oversight and Investigations Committee, called the findings “further proof
that the Bush administration will ignore
the evidence and distort the facts to
protect big oil companies.”

Stupak, whose bill aimed at ending alleged oil product price-gouging
passed the House earlier this year, said
he would continue working with other
members of Congress to send such
legislation to Bush’s desk. “The fact
remains that last year, when [the FTC]
examined price-gouging under definitions supplied by Congress, the commission found evidence of gouging by
refiners and other big oil companies,”
he said.
A May 2006 FTC report of price
increases following Hurricane Katrina
in September 2005 noted 15 instances
involving seven refiners, two wholesalers, and six retailers of “price-gouging”
under a narrow definition in a 2006
appropriations bill. According to that
definition, “gouging” occurred if the
average gasoline price in the hurricaneafflicted area was higher after the storm
than it was before (OGJ, June 5, 2006,
p. 23).
The FTC made clear in its 2006
report that “other factors, such as regional or local market trends, appeared
to explain the pricing of these firms in
nearly all cases.” ✦

Australia E&P are among companies

in Australia’s latest licensing round.
The permits can be renewed twice for

However, Nigerian oil companies,

must leave these new agencies to run
independently if they are to differ from

apan’s July crude oil imports by
refiners and trading houses rose
7.1% from July 2006 to 21.3 million
kl, or 4.32 million b/d.
While the refiners and trading

Middle East accounted for 85% of
overall imports in July, those imports were actually down 7.6% from
July 2006 and down from 86.1% in
June.

Until the August sale, companies
looking for oil sands were not required
to pay for an exploration permit.
In a news release, Government
Relations Minister Harry Van Mulligen called the sale historic and said it
“heralds the beginning of a potential

That includes the company’s estimate
of original bitumen in place (OBIP) for
the Axe Lake discovery on its Saskatchewan permits “and resource potential on
certain portions of the remainder of its
Saskatchewan permits and its adjacent
Alberta permits.”

An independent consultant’s estimate
of OBIP for Axe Lake will be completed
in the fall, but the company’s estimate
includes a total potential bitumen
resource of 2.1-2.8 billion bbl plus
another 3 million bbl for selected areas

covery area. The remaining 4.5 billion
bbl was said to be resource potential for
about two townships of the company’s
adjacent permits in Alberta.
“Axe Lake is proving to be suitable
for in situ recovery,” Oilsands Quest
said. High recovery factors include
thick, continuous, coarse-grained oil
sands with high permeability and
porosity in reservoirs at depths of 185205 m.
Quest is awaiting approvals to
continue its exploration program, but
meanwhile is evaluating drilling data,
performing laboratory studies for
bitumen recovery, conducting environmental programs to facilitate regulatory approvals, developing engineering
timelines to the field pilot plant stage,
and conducting economic feasibility
and risk assessment studies.
This quarter it plans to begin drilling in Saskatchewan and conducting
seismic surveys in adjacent Alberta. In
the fourth quarter it will undertake
reservoir modeling and continue drilling in Saskatchewan and Alberta in the
winter.
In 2008, it plans to drill test wells to
confirm laboratory studies in the first
quarter, establish a data room and initiate joint venture partnership negotiations for Axe Lake development in the
second quarter, and start field pilot
production in the fourth quarter. ✦

The Middle East has been estimated
to contain approximately 65% of the
world’s oil.1-3 Ultimate recoverable “reserves” growth through time has been
observed both in the aggregate and for
individual oil fields in many parts of the
world.
One common average “multiplier
factor” for ultimate field recoverable
volume as a function of “earliest known

Size distribution of Middle East ﬁelds
and reserves growth issues draw focus

The 2005 book “Twilight in the
Desert,” which exposed questionable
oil reserves figures in the Middle East,
created a great honking and flapping of
wings not only among oil companies
and economists but also among political leaders and ordinary citizens.

In the June 2, 2007, issue of Oil
& Gas Journal, Sadad Al-Husseini and
Moujahed Al-Husseini further detailed
the huge discrepancies between different analysts’ oil reserves calculations
for Iraq in particular (whether proved
reserves or proved plus geologically
probable reserves).4
Further discussion of reserves estimates, which can sometimes vary by
two orders of magnitude, seems warranted. The following article will discuss distribution patterns of Middle
East oil reserves of giant oil fields,
geographically, stratigraphically, and
with respect to reservoir type.
Historical trends in oil and gas
reserves and examples of growth factors for individual field reserves require
us to be more optimistic than “Twilight
in the Desert” but skeptical about some
of the more sensational reserves claimed
by IHS Inc. in Iraq, for instance, where
insufficient attention was paid to certain
geological factors (overmaturity of
Silurian source rock and poorer Jurassic
reservoir quality than in
neighboring Saudi Arabia).

Introduction
Plotted on probability
paper, about 400 significant Middle East oil
fields had a 50 percentile
(median) reserve size 10
years ago of 150 million
bbl5 (Fig. 1).
The median reserve
sizes for seven other
producing basins, also
plotted on Fig. 1 for comparison, average about
20 million bbl. Some 40
years ago this 150 million
bbl median figure would
have been an estimated
250 million bbl, and for
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and
Iran separately, median
reserve sizes of about
500 million bbl were
estimated by the writer at
that time. Of course median reserve sizes tend to

decline with time as exploration in any
given area reaches a more mature stage.
Presently at least 80 to 90 Middle
East oil fields have ultimately recoverable “reserves” greater than 1 billion
bbl each. Of these 80 or more giant
fields, the top 33 supergiants exceed
about 5 billion bbl each (Table 1).
Ghawar, the world’s largest oil field,
has at least 90 billion bbl recoverable
from Upper Jurassic limestone reservoirs. Even without access to Saudi Aramco proprietary data, one can imagine
recent stratigraphic trap gas-condensate
discoveries on Ghawar’s east flank could
increase the final total at Ghawar to
perhaps 92 billion to 95 billion bbl of
oil or barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) on
a btu basis.

follows: 11 are in Saudi Arabia, 6 are in
the United Arab Emirates, 5 are in Iraq,
5 are in Iran, 4 are in Kuwait, and 2 are
in Qatar.
These same supergiant oil fields are
distributed according to main reservoir rock as follows: 28% in Lower
Cretaceous carbonate, 20% in Tertiary
carbonate and clastics, 18% in Lower
Cretaceous sandstones, 17% in Upper
Jurassic carbonates, 11% in Upper Cretaceous carbonates, and 6% in Paleozoic
sandstones and limestones.
Barrels of reserves are distributed in
a different way: 32% in Lower Cretaceous sandstones, 31% in Upper
Jurassic carbonates, 15% in Lower
Cretaceous carbonates, 11% in Tertiary
carbonates, 6% in Paleozoic sandstone
and carbonates, and 5% in Upper CretaSupergiant oil ﬁelds

Saudi Aramco’s 1988 annual report

Reserves growth since 1988 in

have been 320 billion bbl. Remaining proved Middle East oil reserves are
reportedly about 700 billion bbl.8 9
No attempt to forecast yet to be
discovered oil is included here, and for
that matter, numerous oil and gas “discoveries” of small or undetermined size
scattered throughout the Middle East
are not included. More than a dozen
such unevaluated or subcommercial
discoveries (mostly gas) are known to
exist in Syria alone.10
Worldwide oil discoveries (especially
of giant sized oil fields) reached an annual peak no later than 1962. That year
an inflection point in the rate of change
in the growth of world oil reserves (ultimate recovery) took place, and annual
reserves additions have been declining
ever since.
Worldwide annual oil production,
on the other hand, has continued to
increase for at least 40 years (minor
exceptions being caused by economic
recessions, oil embargoes, or wars).
If two Gaussian or near-Gaussian
curves are constructed which plot (a)
annual additions to oil reserves, and (b)
annual oil production worldwide (the
King Hubbert-L.F. Ivanhoe approach),
the two curves cross in 1979 or 1980,
and so net remaining worldwide oil
reserves have been declining steadily
since 1980.9
Integrating the areas under the two
curves, it is evident that eventually the
two areas must be equal: that is, total
ultimate production obviously cannot
exceed total discovered reserves; and
since there has already been a 42-year
period of producing history since the
peak discovery year and a 25-year
period of producing history under
conditions of declining net remaining
reserves worldwide, reasonable mathematical projections are able to suggest
more or less permanent producibility
shortfalls beginning about the year
2010, or perhaps 2020.
After that an inevitable world decline
in oil production has been forecast. Of
course this does not take into account

tially involved in underwriting development schemes (as opposed to sometimes
overly exuberant exploration geologists
and geophysicists intent on drilling and
developing favorite prospects).
National and international income
tax, royalty, and depreciation terms,
and even Wall Street attitudes or oil
company bonus policies may also create
conscious or subconscious motives on
the part of oil company management
(and host government authorities) to
either inflate or minimize early geological reserves estimates.
The sudden doubling of stated
reserves by countries at war, or at times

when World Bank loan applications
are pending (or for reasons of national
pride), may also be mentioned.
Hussain13 ascribes the huge increases
in stated oil reserves by gulf members
of OPEC in about 1985 to the fact that
OPEC production quotas were at the
time determined in part by individual
country oil reserves.
Similar circumstances of inflated
reserves statements by the former
Superior Oil Co. led Mobil Oil Corp. to
outbid competitors in a hurried buyout
ordered by top management without
adequate auditing of Superior’s stated
reserves.14 Superior’s top executives had

been receiving annual bonuses based on
additions to reserves.
Most recently, Sadad and Moujahed
Al-Husseini4 have highlighted enormous discrepancies (by two orders of
magnitude) in so-called “proved” and
“potential” oil reserves for Iraq in particular by different analysts.

Precision in terms
The kinds of discrepancies in reserve
estimates mentioned here are most severe when there is a failure to discriminate between “proved” reserves and
“probable or possible” reserves.
Proved reserves are those that have
been blessed by engineers, planners,
bankers, and historians, for instance
following complete infill drilling and
production to a point approaching
the time of field abandonment, while
“geologically probable or possible”
reserves are calculated much earlier on
the basis of a single discovery well (or
two or three) plus the planimetered
area of a seismically mapped structural
trap.
The trouble with such big differences in calculated or estimated reserves
is that economic decisions (to develop,
to build a pipeline, to abandon) cannot
rationally be reached taking into account either extreme, but rather require
economic evaluation of risk factors of
various kinds as well as the extremes
between early “reserve” estimates by
engineering and economic managers
on one hand vs. the early estimates of
explorationists on the other hand.
The legendary petroleum engineer
John Arps pointed out during a 1967
AAPG Lecture Tour that “management’s
interest in estimates is maximal when
information is minimal and vice-versa,”
making for lots of arguments between
optimistical geologists and pessimistical
engineers!15
The need for management decisions
to look at both sides of such disagreements at an early stage and to introduce probability and risk analysis into
the decision equation is obvious. The
significance of early understatement of
proved and potential oil reserves was

New hard facing materials and corrosion-resistant alloys broaden the
market for laser cladding
services. Laser cladding,
a type of laser surface
Drilling
alloying, is a process
that precisely applies a
uniform surface coating to tools and
equipment, and provides protection
against corrosion and wear without
inducing magnetization.
The laser process involves fusing an
alloy layer to a substrate with minimum
melting of the substrate. The aim is to
overlay and solidly bond one metal with
another.1
Oil field tools are routinely subject to
abrasion and corrosion, degrading their
surface integrity both mechanically and
chemically. The industry’s tools have
become increasingly sophisticated, as
engineers incorporate exotic base materials, and wear protection is ever more
important to safeguard capital investments and keep projects on schedule.
Cladding is a less-expensive alternative to manufacturing
tools, structural parts,
and downhole components from solid corrosion-resistant or wearresistant alloys. Applying
a surface coating (hard
facing) improves wear
and corrosion resistance,
results in longer component life, and keeps
equipment in service
longer. Cladding can be
used to create an entirely
new surface or it can repair and renew damaged
or worn surfaces.
Laser cladding is particularly useful for protecting stabilizers and other drillstring components
made of nonmagnetic steel. Laser-applied, tungsten carbide composites can
provide the same protection against
abrasion as carbide inserts, according to
one supplier.2

O D U C T I O N

Nonlaser approaches
Traditionally, hard facing was applied
manually (stick-weld overlays) but this
process is time-consuming and subject
to non-uniformity or irregularities in
surface cover. It also requires application of multiple layers, causing a thicker
surface buildup. Furthermore, heating
the base metal causes surface contaminants to seep into the weld pool, and
electricity and
heat induce
magnetization
in the object
being clad.
Welding
is cost-effective, however,
for objects that are not required to be
nonmagnetic, such as drillbits and bit
shanks.
According to Mark Juckett, hardband product line manager at NOV
Tuboscope’s global drill pipe services,
MIG (metal inert gas) welding is the
industry standard for applying hard
facing (hardbanding) to drill pipe. The

process can be automated, but requires
an experienced welder to operate.
Oven sintering is another method of
applying hard facing, but often repairs
are not possible and the process is
costly and time-consuming.
The hexavalent hard chrome plating
method is also falling from favor due
to the slowness of the coating process,

If you’re a senior engineer on a busy platform in
the North Sea – and responsible for subsea and
downhole operations – then you know all about
the horrors your control lines are exposed to.
Especially at one kilometer below sea level and
another kilometer into the ground.
You’re also fully aware of the nightmare that
would result from a sudden failure or other serious malfunction of those mission-critical lines.
Such knowledge tends to make many people
rather nervous.
While others stay remarkably assured, never
seeming to give their installations much of a
thought.
Their secret? Tubulars made of engineered
materials from Sandvik. Materials that will resist
just about any subsea or downhole torture
imaginable.
As the oil and gas industry is up against more
hostile operating conditions, Sandvik’s cure is
more innovative metallurgical technology and
more advanced materials.
By continuously developing new, higher grades
of these materials, we’re able to produce lighter,

most often used. It forms hard, tough
coatings; carbides resist abrasion due
to their hardness. Pure cast tungsten
carbide spheres, which vary in size,
form the wear component in a nickelalloy matrix that is either formed into
continuous, flexible welding rods
(Fig. 3) or a powder for laser cladding. These spherical tungsten carbide
mixtures are produced by a number of
different companies, including spherotene from Technogenia.
Among the companies that provide
materials for engineered surface coatings used in laser cladding are:
• Carpenter Powder Products, part
of Carpenter Technology Inc., Bridgeville and Reading, Pa., and Torshälla,
Sweden.
• Durum Verschleiss-Schutz GMBH,
Willich, Germany.
• Stellite Coatings, part of Deloro
Stellite Group, Goshen, Ind.
More complex alloys are used for
surface enhancements, corrosion, and
oxidation.
For instance, exposed portions of
subsea riser supports made of commercial pipe with welded hanger flanges
are laser clad with nickel-based alloys to
add corrosion resistance to seawater.

Process
Laser cladding for the oil field is
usually a single-stage application process that involves either pre-placing or
blowing powdered cladding material
on the substrate (object to be clad). The
laser generates a molten pool in the
presence of an inert gas. To cover a large
surface, the laser must follow overlapping tracks. The resulting surface layer is
usually 1-2 mm thick.6
Technogenia developed its Lasercarb
process with the assistance of Irepa
Laser in Strasbourg and the CALFETMAT
research laboratory in Lyon. The process
uses a computer-numeric control system to regulate temperature and power.
Although laser cladding imposes
stresses on the material by the high
local heat generated by the laser and
the length of time required to complete
multiple, overlapping passes across

large surface areas, the heat input is
still much lower than traditional weld
overlay processes.
A two-stage laser cladding process
exists that is limited to flat surfaces and
is more prevalent in other industries.

Innovations
At the laser applications division of
the Fraunhofer USA Center for Coatings
and Laser Applications in Plymouth,
Mich., researchers partner with Michigan State University on a variety of
projects. Among the innovations was a
laser-cladding method that uses a 3-kw
diode laser and a coaxial powder-feeding nozzle to apply tungsten carbide.7
The diode process is one-third the cost
of CO2 laser application and is successfully being used for downhole drilling
equipment.
Laser-cladding research is also underway at the University of Waterloo, Ont.
Ehsan Toyserkani, in the university’s
“mechatronics” engineering group, is
working on measuring clad geometry
microstructure in real-time, an essential
control signal for a closed-loop control
of laser cladding.
Toyserkani, Amir Khajepour, and

Stephen Corbin, authors of a recent
book on laser cladding,6 were awarded
a patent in 2006 outlining a system
and method for intelligent closed-loop
control of laser cladding by powder
injection.8
The researchers focused on improving the wear resistance of high-temperature turbine blades, but the methods
are applicable to most oil field requirements.
Researchers in China are working
on aluminum oxide (Al2O3) coatings
on AZ91D magnesium alloy and 7075
aluminum alloy.9 10
Surface laser cladding with a CO2
laser was recently used to develop
iron-based powder coatings containing
nano-Al2O3 particles. Researchers found
that adding nano-Al2O3 particles significantly improved mechanical properties,
particularly wear resistance.11
Corrosion resistance is also a subject
of current research, although in general
practice, it’s common to use commercially available corrosion-resistant alloys
in laser cladding. Russian researchers
found that adding nickel to chromium
cladding on stainless steel considerably

Before the oil gets to you, it goes through us.

You can’t always see us, but Momentive is out there. In a better headlight lens. In an improved
tire. Even in the oil you use. And with oil extraction and recovery becoming more challenging,
our scientists invented Silbreak* 638 demulsiﬁer that takes some of the pain out of the process.
Silbreak* 638 separates water and gas from the oil at cooler temperatures to produce drier oil
and cleaner water while controlling foam, providing solutions that work in extreme environments
like the North Sea and Alaska’s North Slope. And even better, Silbreak* 638 demulsiﬁer degrades
in seawater and meets test criteria for non-toxicity to selected marine organisms. Every day,
we’re coming through for companies around the world in exciting, revolutionary ways. And that’s
a formula for success. Go to Momentive.com/oil/.

Market, industry
Even operators such as ExxonMobil have worked on laser cladding,
as shown in a review of US-issued patents.
But laser cladding wasn’t widely commercialized until the mid-late 1990s.
Now, engineers at operating companies generally specify drilling requirements and service companies provide
the specified equipment and services.
Equipment manufacturers employ machine shops to build tools and arrange for
specialty services such as laser cladding of
certain components.
Laser cladding facilities are generally found in areas with heavy oil field
demand, such as Texas and Alberta, as well
in unexpected spots, such as the foothills
of the French Alps, from which products
are shipped worldwide.
According to Holger Stibbe, director of
MWD/LWD development, Baker Hughes
INTEQ uses a variety of proprietary wear
resistant coatings and several laser cladding vendors. Different patterns are applied to improve wear resistance of MWD
and LWD tools. Stibbe told OGJ that the
availability of laser cladding services has
improved in the last few years, with vendors in the US, France, and UK serving
market needs. Baker uses predominantly
CO2 lasers and some diode lasers.
At the Offshore Technology Conference this past May, Houston’s Laser Cladding Services discussed its partnership
50

with NASA to develop specialized laser
cladding for a control valve on a rocket
engine test stand in NASA’s rocket engine
testing program at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.13
Phelan told OGJ that the majority of
the company’s work is for the oil industry, and the laser process is used for
choke and kill lines, downhole tools, ball
bounce, hydraulic cylinder rods—even
the occasional drillbit (Fig. 4).
Laser cladding is useful wherever
components need to be protected from
abrasion, cavitation, fretting, particle erosion, and corrosion. Many of the world’s
largest oil field equipment designers and
manufacturers—including Baker Hughes
INTEQ, Halliburton, NOV Tuboscope,
Schlumberger, and Smith International—
use some level of laser cladding. ✦

Hot-wet downhole conditions affect composite selection
Yusheng Yuan

Advanced fiber-reinProduction
forced polymer composites offer new options for
working on and completing deep wells
that have high temperatures and pressures (HT-HP) and produce corrosive
fluids, although proper material selection requires an understanding of the
composite’s hot-wet thermomechanical
behavior.
Companies can include composites in drilling, logging, completion,
production, and workover. Completions
and workovers often require tools set
temporarily in a wellbore that need to
be made from easily drilled or milled
out materials. Offshore deepwater extended-reach drilling and completions
require materials for downhole tubular
components and equipment that are
lightweight and fatigue-resistant.1 2
Advanced fiber reinforced, high-tem52

perature polymer composites can function at elevated temperatures in deep
wells while offering advantages such as
lightweight, corrosion resistance, long
fatigue life, and easy removal. Furthermore, nonconductive and nonmagnetic
high-temperature polymer composites
are ideal for resistivity and induction
logging tools.2
Aerospace and other industrial applications, including oil field operations,
have incorporated in various applications such high-temperature polymers
as polyimides, cyanate esters, phenolics,
high-temperature epoxies, thermoplastics, and their composites.1 2
Under moisture or a wet condition
with high-temperature, however, most
polymers and their composites behave
differently from their original dry state
because of severe hydrolytic and hydrothermal degradations from the hightemperature wet environment.3
It is therefore important to understand the HT-HP hot-wet thermomechanical behavior of various high-tem-

perature polymer resins, reinforcement
fibers, and their composites.3

Composites downhole
The petroleum industry has actively researched and used composites
downhole since the mid-1960s. It has
developed numerous fiber-reinforced
composite products for downhole
operations, such as sucker rods, tubing
and casing, drill pipes, coiled tubing,
and well screens.1 2 These applications,
however, have limited temperature ratings, mostly below 200° F., and lack
long-term performance reliability under
HT-HP downhole conditions.
Many downhole operations require
service tools that perform in a hot-wet
fluid at temperatures greater than 400°
F. and pressures greater than 10,000
psi. These conditions require more
advanced HT-HP hot-wet resistant composite materials.

started in the mid-1970s to meet the
demand for downhole corrosion resistance.
These strings had pultruded fiberglass rods with steel connectors at two
ends. Pultruded fiberglass rods possess
high tensile strength, are lightweight,
and have good corrosion resistance.
With proper string design, the
fiberglass sucker rods can increase the
production rate, reduce energy consumption, and provide longer rod life.
Temperature remains the major limitation for expanding field applications.
Most operators install the rods in wells
with bottomhole temperatures of less
than 180° F.

Tubulars
In the early 1980s, the industry started using CO2 flooding for enhancing oil
recovery. Mixing CO2 and water causes
severe corrosion to traditional steel tubing strings.
These corrosion problems expanded
the use of corrosion resistance and
lightweight, glass fiber-reinforced
polymer (GRP) pipe to high-pressure
downhole and surface applications,
including water and gas injection lines,
and downhole tubing and casing.
To establish an industrial standard,
the American Petroleum Institute
(API), in the mid 1980s, initiated
the development of pressure-rating
methodologies and purchase specification for commercial high-pressure
fiberglass line pipe (API 15HR) and

downhole tubing (API 15TR).
API, in 1992, only published API
15HR. This specification provides purchase guidelines and pressure-rating
methods for high-pressure fiberglass
line pipes with internal pressure rating
from 500 to 5,000 psi, but the service
temperature specified for long-term
applications was limited to less than
150° F.
Although several manufacturers sell
filament-wound GRP downhole tubing
and casing products, no industrial standards or specifications exist today for
these products.
The primary industry concerns in
using these products are the lack of
standards and application data and
long-term performance uncertainty.

Composite drill pipe
Horizontal and extended-reach drilling has expanded since the 1980s in
both onshore and offshore operations.
The heavy weight of conventional steel
drill pipe, however, has limited drilling
operations.
Lightweight composite materials can
reduce the frictional drag of drill pipe
on the wellbore. Also carbon fiber-reinforced composite tubular structures
are applicable for extended reach and
deepwater drilling because of their high
torsional stiffness and strength, flexibility, and long fatigue life.
One vendor introduced small-sized
flexible composite drill pipe products
into the market in the mid-1990s. A

major application of this drill pipe is in
short-radius lateral drilling.
A program was initiated in 1999 for
developing cost-effective, larger sized
composite drill pipe for extended-reach
and deepwater (ER-DW) drilling. The
goal was to attain about a 50% weight
saving over steel drill pipe. This would
enable ER-DW drilling and real-time
data and power transmissions through
the drilling string.
Recently, a program developed 6-in.
ER-DW composite drill pipe that is now
under field evaluation. Because the major reinforcement material in the drill
pipe is carbon fiber, and drill pipe is a
short-term application, the pipe usually
has a temperature rating higher than
other downhole fiberglass products.
Drillers, however, commonly use
composite drill pipe in holes that have a
temperature of less than 250° F.

Spoolable tubing
Although the industry widely uses
metallic spoolable tubing in downhole
applications, limitations such as heavy
weight, low corrosion resistance, short
fatigue life, and high thermal conductivity of conventional carbon steel products, have led companies since 1988 to
seek new materials for the tubing.
Companies in recent years have made
much progress in developing spoolable
composite tubular.
The manufacturing of spoolable
thermoset composite tubing uses a continuous filament winding process. The

tubing has an extruded thermoplastic
liner, a major composite structural
laminate body, and a protective outer
layer. During the winding process, the
manufacturer can embed in the tubing wall data and power transmission
conductors.
Spoolable composite applications
include flowlines and injection lines
for transporting oil field corrosive
fluids and gases, coiled tubing for well
intervention, and production tubing in
corrosive wells.
Commercialization of composite
spoolable tubing products has focused
on flowline and injection line applications because major downhole applications such as coiled tubing, production
tubing, and “smart” pipe remain under
development and evaluation.
Developers still must overcome the
low axial stiffness and strength and
ensure long-term exposure reliability of
composites in HT-HP downhole conditions.

Logging tools
Resistivity or induction logging tools
require a nonconductive and nonmagnetic cylindrical housing structure to
contain the electrical and electromagnetic devices and provide mechanical strength, pressure integrity, and
resistance to the corrosive downhole
conditions.
The materials in the housing structures require certain dielectric properties and electromagnetic radiation
transparency.
Advanced glass fiber-reinforced
polymer composites are ideal for these
applications.
Because the logging process in each
run is basically a short-term application under a hydrostatic pressure, the
temperature and pressure rating of the
logging tools with glass fiber-reinforced
epoxy composite may reach 350° F. and
15,000 psi. In deeper wells, the logging
tools may have to endure temperatures
and pressures greater than 400° F. and
20,000 psi. In these circumstances, the

industry will need more advanced HTHP hot-wet resistant composites.

Drillable downhole tools
Drilling, completion, and workover
operations require various downhole
tools, such as packers, bridge plugs,
and some cementing tools that are set
temporarily in the wellbore and that are
removed by drilling or milling operations.
A workover rig usually is needed for
drilling or milling out a conventional
cast-iron packer or bridge plug and
often the work is unwieldy. Multiple
bridge plugs set in a multizone wellbore for a remedial job often are time
consuming and expensive to remove
because of multiple drillstring trips and
the need for expensive kill-weight drilling fluids.
Advanced composite materials and
structures, incorporated with highstrength fibers and high-temperature
resin matrices can be an alternative
to cast-iron tools. The composites can

much improvement in compressive

this outstanding hot-wet mechanical

that the compressive strength retention

Inefficient heat
transfer
in heat
exchangers is a
common
bottleneck that plagues refineries and
energy operations around the world,
requiring considerable attention and,
at times, and greater-than-anticipated
expense.
In refineries, heat exchangers play
a critical role in cooling and processing various streams. It is of paramount
importance to preserve these systems
to ensure they operate at maximum efficiency and prolong their working lives
through good maintenance practices.
Because the cost of poorly performing HTE can cost well into the millions
of dollars, many operators have usually
found it preferable to maintain maximum operation efficiency and extend
tube life by coating the inner diameters
with phenolic materials.
Although the type of pipe metallurgy and tubular ID coatings can differ
between oilfield, refinery, and pipeline
applications, a preventive-coatings approach holds many advantages and can
save millions in operational costs.
In the past, coating piping ID had to
be done in special shops, not on site.
That meant each heat exchanger had to
be completely disassembled, shipped,
and then reassembled; it precluded the
largest units from being transported at
all.
Progress in techniques has enabled
in situ application to be common, and
coatings are optimized to match the
type of steel service conditions for best

effect. Coatings can consist of bisphenol
f, fluorinated products, phenolics, and
novolacs, depending on the service conditions to which they are applied.
Before coatings, the only way to extend tube life involved chemical cleaning and mechanical cleaning or upgrading to expensive alloys. The chemical
cleaning actually produces toxic H2S
gas and hazardous waste, and removing
oxides also causes further corrosion due
to structural degradation.

Case study
A US Gulf Coast refinery tracked its
heat exchanger costs during a 12-year
period. Measuring outages/month for
cleaning or leaks at 6-month intervals
during January 1993 through January
2005, the company saw visible improvements. The monthly outages were
as high as 17 until after July 2001,
when they dropped to fewer than 2
outages/month (Fig. 1).
The time between leaks (Fig. 2)
also dramatically increased during the
period, particularly from January 2002
to March 2004. The number of years
between service maintenance for leaks
was trending toward 20 years, according to the data; before the coatings
were applied, the number of service
stoppages was averaging 6.5/month.
Outages/month dropped to a mean of
less than one in recent years because
the most problematic exchangers were
coated.
This represents an improvement of
120 fewer service outages and 72 fewer
repairs/year. Because the cost of an
outage is about $5,000/heat-exchanger
bundle, this improvement translates to
savings in outages of $600,000/year.
Additionally, repair and replacement costs average $20,000/bundle.
With coatings and proper maintenance
procedures now in place, this refinery is
saving about $1.4 million/year. Combined, the outage and repair savings
exceed $2 million/year.
These estimated cost savings do not
account for the price of bundle retubings or higher alloy replacements, at
about $500,000/incident. Additionally,

the greatest potential economic benefit
is maintaining optimal or additional
process throughput, which, while
harder to quantify, can quickly add vast
amounts of net revenue to an existing
unit.
In another part of the same company’s refinery operations, the C4-recovery unit, several heat exchangers (feed
flash condenser, de-ethanizer overhead
condenser, ammonia condenser) were
historically “bad actors.” The heat-exchanger tubes were suffering severe
fouling, corrosion, and pitting, which
plagued unit reliability and cost due
to frequent outages for leak repair and
cleaning that cut back feed rates to the
FCC units.
Of the six exchangers chosen for
coatings, two required complete retubing before coating. The other four were
3 years old at the time but had about
50% remaining tube wall. The company opted to apply coatings to all six
heat exchangers to prevent further corrosion from sulfate-reducing bacteria
and to decrease fouling from calcium
deposits.
By coating all the exchangers, the
refiner could use preventive maintenance to reduce further stoppages for
leak repairs, retubings, and cleaning
cycles.
The results due to tube ID coatings
included improved FCC gas cooling in
the heat exchangers, which ran at more
than 230 psi in the older equipment
before retubing and coating. After the
coated exchangers were put in service,
the coolant fluid pressure dropped 10%
and remained steady within a range of
190-200 psi.
The additional cooling eliminated all
gas recycling and kept the unit at 96%
recovery rate even in the hottest summer months. This netted an additional
recovery of 1,000 b/d.
Previous cleaning cycles for each
exchanger averaged 6 months at 4 days
each and lost production of 10,000 b/d.
The heat exchangers now have more
than 9 years of service and have never
been taken out of service for cleaning.

A history of coatings
Fluids that come into contact with tubular surfaces have always plagued heatexchanger equipment. Historically, operators used water treatment and periodic
cleaning via hydroblasting to manage fouling, but the results were not always
optimal.
Users now use polymer coatings on the tubular inner and outer diameters
(ID, OD) of heat-transfer equipment. Over the years this practice has evolved
and matured into a cost-effective remedy to reduce typical fouling and corrosion
problems intrinsic to heat-exchange equipment.
Improvements in materials, surface preparation, application and thermal
conductivity, plus owner-operator data collection and analysis, have established
tubular coatings as viable heat-transfer equipment problem solvers.
A German chemical company ﬁrst developed phenolic materials for tube ID
coatings in the 1950s. Applied by a ﬁll, drain, and rotate method in a specialized
shop, it was the industry’s best option until the mid-1980s. By that time, companies in Italy began experimenting with air-atomized spray applications of epoxy
phenolic. The Italian companies, by coating the tube ID with the epoxy phenolic
compound, achieved excellent results and improved fouling and corrosion resistance to the main condensers, which actually restored the generating units to
normal operating capacity.
Today, ID coatings are commonly considered a best practice for extending
the performance and lifecycle of a heat-transfer system. It took decades of trial
and error in upstream, midstream, and downstream applications to ﬁnd the right
solutions for each ID, bare metal, and chemical coating compound to optimize the
practice for each and every condition and situation.

Common coatings used for the heat
exchanger ID coating include baked
phenolics, epoxy phenolics, vitons, novolacs, and thermoplastics. Coatings are
chosen according to the service temperature and conditions, and whether they
are applied in the shop or the field.
One of the best-known coatings for
oilfield applications is a thermoplastic, polyphenylene sulfide (PPS). It is a
viable thin-film corrosion barrier for
tubular products that can function well
even at temperatures exceeding 400°
F. It provides excellent protection to
carbon-steel substrates and serves as a
good alternative to an alloy.

oxidized or new condition. Reducing
friction reduces the boundary-layer
drag and substantially opens up the
flow profile.

Bottom-line beneﬁts
Applying polymer coatings to the
ID of HTE in refineries can provide
benefits that increase heat-transfer duty,
eliminate corrosion, reduce or eliminate
micro- and macro-fouling, improve the
cleaning cycle, and allow for perpetual
equipment life with recoating.
Certain chemical environments,
elevated temperatures, and high fluid
or gas velocities can limit the efficacy
of coatings. Benefits, however, can be
realized with coatings in the acceptable
temperature and exposure that correspond to the coating properties, guided
by quality-assurance techniques.
Video scopes can verify and test
surface cleanliness for grit blasting.
Chloride testing is also viable, but usually on tube-sheet areas. Blotter tests or
black-light examinations can confirm or
eliminate the presence of hydrocarbons.
The most limited quality-assurance
issue centers on dry-film thickness
readings. Current instrumentation can
only reach 6 in. into the tube-end to
verify adherence to the specification. If
additional verification is needed, sample
tubes can be coated, split, and measured
for verification of minimum dry-film
thickness throughout the tube.
Holiday testing can then be accomplished with a low voltage, wet-sponge
method, adapted to extend all the way
through the tube, with the sponge sized
to fit snugly into the tube’s ID.
There are now more approaches
to produce the desired outcomes and
reduce the losses incurred through
inefficient heat transfer in oilfield applications, pipeline transmission, and
refining. The best starting point is to
consider the various conditions and use
the most efficient methods to clean and
coat the tubular systems.
Reduced downtime, slower depreciation on capital, assets and equipment,
fewer stoppages due to repairs or outages, and better maintenance procedures

all contribute to improved operational
efficiency, gains in production capacity
and, ultimately, higher margins. Coating
HTE tubes can yield significant returns
on capital investment. ✦

SPECIAL

Background
Operators of LNG loading terminals want to change
loading pipeline design from
the standard jetty-based
stainless steel to a subsea
36Ni alloy-based design. Changing
pipeline materials from stainless steel to
a 36Ni alloy would allow elimination of
the jetty structure and expansion loops
in favor of a straight subsea pipeline,

decreasing the materials required, reducing environmental disturbance, and
increasing the security of the pipeline.
The 36Ni’s low coefficient of thermal expansion, about 10 times lower
than stainless steel, allows these improvements, decreasing thermal stresses
that arise when the pipeline is cooled
from ambient to operating temperature.
Traditional LNG offloading lines compensate for these thermal stresses by
including mechanical expansion loops
and bellows that can deflect with the
thermal stresses. Moving away from the
traditional method could reduce operating expenses of the LNG offloading terminal by extending the LNG pipeline to
deeper water, reducing the amount of

required loading berth access dredging.
Development of 36Ni as a pipeline
material is ongoing. Determining a
weld filler metal for both pipe fabrication in the mill and pipeline installation in the field that can withstand the
stresses from installation and service is
a critical component of this work. This
article aims to identify an existing filler
metal class that meets these needs.

C not present in the microstructures
of matching CTE filler metals A and B.
These titanium-rich particles absorb the
tramp elements that cause the cracking
seen in filler metals A and B. Filler metal
E, while exhibiting no ductility dip
cracking, showed very low toughness
(Fig. 4).
Very high niobium and carbon levels
in the weld pool (Table 5) cause NbC
particles to form on the weld grain
boundaries (Fig. 8). While NbC particles are advantageous for certain applications, in large amounts these hard
particles act to decrease weld toughness.
Among the five tested alloys, two
filler metals—C and D—exceeded all
specified minimum criteria and passed
the weld-cracking test. Filler metal C
showed the most consistent Charpy
v-notch toughness values, but its yield
strength was one of the lowest. Filler
metal D showed the highest tensile
strength values, overmatching at room
temperature and matching plate values
at cryogenic temperature. Its toughness values, however, showed a sharp
decrease at the weld center line.
The welding detailed in Tables 3 and
4 was designed to provide the highest
quality and consistency for comparison
among different weld metals and not to
obtain the highest mechanical properties for individual filler metals. Further
refinement could improve individual
mechanical properties, as evinced by

shown by the nearly 20,000 psi variation in cryogenic 0.2 yield stress. The
GMAW tensile stress and yield stress
values, however, are generally higher
than the GTAW.
Even though further welding process
optimization could increase the property values of some filler metals, the

elsewhere in the literature.6-9 The presence of ductility dip cracks precluded
selection of a filler metal for cryogenic

filler metals A and B over that seen in
an optimized welding schedule of 4-5

New line of resilient seated butterﬂy valves
The new line of ST Series resilient
seated butterfly valves offers high flow
coefficients, ISO top mounting, one-piece
body with self-centering disk, and a selection of direct mount actuators and gear
operators.
Valves are also available as a manual
type with limit switches for those uses that
do not require automation but do require
feedback to a PLC or network bus system.
Valves are available in sizes 2 through
12 in. with a pressure rating up to 225 psi
and 14 through 24 in. have a pressure rating up to 160 psi.
The ST Series features a one-piece,
ductile iron body. The fusion bonded epoxy body coating offers superior exterior
corrosion resistance, the firm says. Also,
since no gasket is required for mounting
between flanges, additional gaskets or Orings are not needed for installation. Valves
are available with either Buna-N or EPDM

In their new book, authors Michael D. Tusiani and Gordon
Shearer, using everyday language and real-world examples,
present LNG as the most viable energy answer to the everincreasing global demand for natural gas.

458 Pages/ Hardcover/
August 2007
ISBN10 087814-885-X
ISBN13 978-0-87814-885-1
Price: $69.00 US

Even the most conservative estimates suggest that the
demand for LNG internationally will double by 2020, and
billions of dollars will be needed for the infrastructure
investment.
The authors’ straightforward explanation of a complex
industry proves that LNG can deliver a critical link in the
energy demands of international economies.

Tawdry tricks
trample facts in
energy politics
The vicious fraud that masquerades as
energy politics is testing limits of acceptability in the US Congress.
The Department of Justice’s antitrust
division and Federal Trade Commission
have determined yet again that the oil and
gas industry hasn’t manipulated gasoline
prices.
And, yet again, congressional nags
won’t believe it. In fact, one of them has

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

sprung a devious trap.
Justice and FTC on Aug. 30 reported
results of a study ﬁnding that market forces
accounted for increases in the price of
gasoline in the late spring and early summer of 2006 (OGJ Online, Aug. 31, 2007).
This, said Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.),
showed the Bush administration to be
concerned only about protecting big oil
companies.
“The fact remains that last year, when
the FTC examined price-gouging under
deﬁnitions supplied by Congress, the
commission found evidence of gouging
by reﬁners and other big oil companies,”
Stupak said.
This “fact” omits much.
Here, for example, is the deﬁnition
of “gouging” to which he refers, which
Congress added to a 2006 appropriations
bill: “Any ﬁnding that the average price of
gasoline available for sale to the public in
September 2005 [after Hurricane Katrina
ravaged Gulf Coast production equipment
and reﬁneries], or thereafter in a market
area located in an area designated as a
state or national disaster area because
of Hurricane Katrina, or in any other area
where price-gouging complaints have been
ﬁled because of Hurricane Katrina with
a state consumer protection agency, exceeded the average price of such gasoline
in that area for the month of August 2005.”
Although accompanied by limited exclusions, this deﬁnition allows a predictable
market response to Hurricane Katrina to be
construed as “gouging.”
So, yes, FTC found in its study of postKatrina price hikes that, under a perverse
deﬁnition of the term, “gouging” occurred
in 15 instances. But it emphasized that
other factors explained the price increases
and concluded that no illegal manipulation
occurred (OGJ, June 5, 2006, p. 23).
Stupak’s “fact” omitted that context, too.
The omissions show the congressman
to be interested less in facts, and therefore
in constructive energy policy, than in tawdry political tricks.

Another hurricane threat
Having just returned to full production after Hurricane Dean, Petroleos Mexicanos
again faced a possible decision Sept. 3 whether to evacuate offshore rigs and platforms in the Bay of Campeche as another category 5 storm, Hurricane Felix, churned
through the Caribbean.
Felix developed quickly with a much stronger than anticipated pattern, reaching
category 5 even before it entered Caribbean waters. Dean also was a category 5 that
weakened as it crossed land and entered the Gulf of Mexico. Nevertheless, it forced
Pemex to shut down 140 offshore units and move 1,300 workers to land.
At one point, a weather model at the US National Hurricane Center showed Felix
possibly passing over the Yucatan Peninsula to enter the Bay of Campeche—where
66% of Pemex’s oil production is located—not far from Dean’s previous track. “None
of the models show it going straight towards the US Gulf but rather through the
Yucatan (as did Dean) or Central America,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of
Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland.
Hurricane Felix later was downgraded to category 4 with sustained winds of 135
mph. Meteorologists said it could ﬂuctuate between the two categories until hitting
the mainland. There was no indication Sept. 3 that Pemex was evacuating any workers or shutting down any production as Felix’s track appeared to move south toward
the Central American coast. Hurricane alerts were issued for Nicaragua, Guatemala,
and Belize. However, traders expected Felix to remain a major market force through
the rest of the week. They also expected production losses as a result of Hurricane
Dean to show up in Sept. 6 reports of US imports.
Oil futures prices rose Sept. 3 in international markets as traders tracked potentially destructive storms that could hit the Gulf of Mexico region. But with US ﬁnancial markets closed for the Labor Day holiday, trading was sluggish. That holiday
marked the end of the US summer driving season, after which gasoline demand
historically declines.
US inventories
The Energy Information Administration reported commercial US crude inventories fell 3.5 million bbl to 333.6 million bbl during the week ended Aug. 24. That
surpassed the consensus expectation of a 600,000 bbl draw. US gasoline stocks
dropped 3.6 million bbl to 192.6 million bbl in the same period, vs. a consensus
draw of 2.5 million bbl; gasoline supply is well below average for this time of year
with declines in both ﬁnished gasoline and gasoline blending components. Distillate
fuel inventories increased 900,000 bbl to 129.9 million bbl, slightly more than the
consensus build of 800,000 bbl. US reﬁnery utilization fell to 90.3% during the same
week from 91.6% the prior week.
“Gasoline inventories fell by 4.7 million bbl east of the Rockies and hit their lowest absolute level since the 2005 hurricanes,” said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital
Inc., London. “In terms of days of forward cover, they are even tighter than that.” US
gasoline supplies were then 8.2% below year-ago levels, having fallen 12.1 million
bbl in 4 weeks. “The large gasoline draw has left stockpiles at the lowest level since
1991, when the government began collecting this data,” said analysts in the Houston
ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. However, Jakob at Petromatrix said half
of the Aug. 24 draw of crude occurred in “discounted” Petroleum Administration for
Defense District 5 (PADD 5) for Hawaii, Alaska, and the West Coast of the continental
US. In the other four PADDs, Jakob said, “Overall US crude stocks remain at multiyear highs for the period, both in absolute terms and in days of forward cover but
with a balance which remains underweight in PADD 2 [the Midwest] and overweight
in PADD 3 [the Gulf Coast]; and this continues to prevent signiﬁcant pressure to
develop on the front West Texas Intermediate time spreads.”
Natural gas outlook
EIA reported the injection of 43 bcf of natural gas into US underground storage
during the week ended Aug. 24. That compared with injections of 23 bcf the previous
week and 48 bcf during the same period last year. That put total US gas storage at
2.969 tcf, up 71 bcf from year-ago levels and 315 bcf above the 5-year average.
“If we have the same injection each week for the remaining 10 weeks left in storage injection season, inventories would surpass 3.4 tcf in November, which would
be close to the record high of 3.461 [tcf] reached on Oct. 20, 2006. It would take injections of 53 bcf to get storage to 3.5 tcf,” said analysts at the Société Générale Group
in Paris.

Welcome to Oil & Gas Maintenance Technology
Conference and Exhibition
Maintenance means money. In the world-class, global-scale oil and gas operations of the
Middle East, maintenance means big money.
The Oil & Gas Maintenance Technology Conference and Exhibition brings together professionals
from the Middle East and around the world to discuss practical solutions to real problems. It
includes sessions on predictive and preventive maintenance, reliability and asset management
and maintenance management. From vibration analysis to corrosion control to contracting
practice, the conference addresses maintenance and inspection issues aӽecting tanks,
compressors, rotating equipment, pipelines, gas plants, reﬁneries, instrumentation and more.
The exhibition represents a showcase of technical innovation.
Because harsh conditions and operational scale make the Middle East a proving ground for
maintenance practice, the Oil & Gas Maintenance Technology Conference and Exhibition will
attract worldwide attention. PennWell Corporation and Oil & Gas Journal are pleased to oӽer
industry leaders this rich opportunity to exchange ideas and to learn.

INFORMATION FOR VISITORS
About Bahrain
Bahrain has a prosperous economy based on its key industries of aluminium, oil
and gas, metal and ship building and repair, ﬁnancial services and tourism. Its
major trading partners are Saudi Arabia, United States, India, Japan, UK, France,
and South Korea.
Having been the ﬁrst country in the region to discover oil in 1932, Bahrain·s
economy is now well diversiﬁed and the country is less dependent on oil than
most other Gulf states. Petroleum production and processing in Bahrain accounts
for about 60% of export earnings, 60% of government revenues and 30% of the
country·s GDP (currently $25,300 per capita). Source: FCO, UK
Bahrain is strategically located at the heart of the key oil and gas markets in
the Gulf, in particular Saudi Arabia and Qatar, making it an attractive location to
host this inaugural event. With its highly developed communication and transport
facilities, Bahrain is home to many multinational companies.
In 2004 Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, with which the US
intends to eliminate certain barriers to trade between the two nations.

PIPELINE REHABILITATION & MAINTENANCE
PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOPS
9-10 DECEMBER 2007
Workshop B: An Updated Look at Pipeline Rehabilitation
A two-day intensive course on current pipeline rehabilitation techniques
being used around the world. The course features in-depth coverage of
the engineering aspects of in-situ pipeline rehabilitation including topics
such as working over operating pipelines, raising and lowering operating
pipelines and determining safe operating parameters for reconditioning
operating pipelines. Case studies of pipeline rehabilitation projects
from around the world are presented and analyzed. Draft procedures

for performing ﬁeld pipeline rehabilitation are included in the course
materials. Ten popular pipeline coating systems are compared based on
physical and application properties. A model for determining total applied
costs of a coating allows the student to develop a cost comparison of the
coatings for a speciﬁc project. In-plant rehabilitation of old pipelines is
discussed including inspection methods to determine ﬁtness for re-use.

About Bahrain
Bahrain has a prosperous economy based on its key industries of aluminium, oil
and gas, metal and ship building and repair, ﬁnancial services and tourism. Its
major trading partners are Saudi Arabia, United States, India, Japan, UK, France,
and South Korea.
Having been the ﬁrst country in the region to discover oil in 1932, Bahrain·s
economy is now well diversiﬁed and the country is less dependent on oil than
most other Gulf states. Petroleum production and processing in Bahrain accounts
for about 60% of export earnings, 60% of government revenues and 30% of the
country·s GDP (currently $25,300 per capita). Source: FCO, UK
Bahrain is strategically located at the heart of the key oil and gas markets in the
Gulf, in particular Saudi Arabia and Qatar, making it an ideal location to host the
9th annual Pipeline Rehabilitation & Maintenance conference and exhibition. With
its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain is home to
many multinational companies.

_______________________

Welcome to Pipeline Rehabilitation & Maintenance Technology
Conference and Exhibition
Current high oil and gas commodity prices make oil spills and vapor escapes from operating pipelines
more costly than ever before. At the same time, public and governmental pressures on pipeline
operators to protect air, water, and ground environments have never been greater.
The convergence of these factors heightens the need for pipeline operators to share experiences in
monitoring and controlling system ﬂows and diagnosing and rehabilitating lapses in line integrity.
As Middle East producers and processors ramp up their operations to meet greater hydrocarbon
energy demand, this conference stands as an established and leading forum in bringing together
operating and service companies and their technical and management personnel to learn the latest
and best in pipeline rehabilitation and maintenance.
The previous eight conferences have ﬁrmly established the value and need for an international
specialised meeting to examine issues centered on the ﬁtness for purpose question of oil and natural
gas transmission lines.

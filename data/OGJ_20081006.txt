GE Oil & Gas

Balance:
it’s genetic
It starts with the right people and it ends with the right solution.
Like when our people set out to make a compressor unit with higher
performance and lower environmental impact. The result was our new
Integrated Compressor Line – an integrated system with a single casing
for a centrifugal compressor and high-speed electric motor. The ICL
provides up to 15 MW of power for a wide operating range, with units
that are 40-60% smaller than traditional products, and a simpliﬁed
design that reduces noise and projected lifecycle maintenance costs
by 40%. On the environmental side, the closed design and pressurized
stopping capability avoid 1,520 metric tons of CO2 leakage annually.
And our active magnetic bearings eliminate the need for 38,250 liters
of lubricant oil over each unit’s life. So the ICL will help balance your
books and your peace of mind.
Balance – it’s in our DNA.

CobraMax® H service boosts
gas production, cuts time and
cost on horizontal wells by
fracturing with coiled tubing
The Challenge:
British Columbia, Canada—A Canadian operator
used Halliburton’s CobraMax® H service to place
multiple fractures in a horizontal well in the
Montney shale formation. The treatment was
successful and the well produced 160,000 m3
gas/day (5.6 mmcf/d) which was more than the
operator expected. Completing the five fractures
took five days and the treatment required three
bottomhole assemblies (BHAs). The operator
liked the results and requested Halliburton work
on speeding up the process because each BHA
change required eight hours of coiled tubing
operations.

 The new CobraMax H system achieves maximum conductivity

in the near-wellbore region to overcome flow convergence issues
common in horizontal wells.

The Solution:
Halliburton made three improvements that dramatically increased the speed of CobraMax H treatments: an
erosion-resistant BHA that could last for an entire operation on a well, an improved sand plug technique to isolate
intervals and a new fluid design.

“I now have higher
production with
increased speed and
lower cost from
CobraMax H —
quality, service and
price without
any tradeoffs.”

The Results:
The new CobraMax H system has now been used on dozens of
horizontal wells in the Montney play. Seven zones fractured in
40 hours is now routine performance. Completion costs have typically
been slashed by more than 40 percent. Safety and reliability have
improved. And wells fractured with CobraMax H service are the
best performers in the field.

For more information about how CobraMax H service can help reduce the time for multizone frac treatments and
make your field more profitable, visit www.halliburton.com/reliability or e-mail stimulation@halliburton.com.

Senate rejects oil shale moratorium
The US Senate on Sept. 26 defeated by 52 to 42 votes an economic stimulus bill containing a provision to extend a moratorium
on federal oil shale leasing. The measure fell 8 votes short of the 60
votes necessary for passage.
Republicans were pleased with the outcome. “This Democratcontrolled ‘do nothing and drill nothing’ Congress is out of touch
with the people that put them in office,” said Sen. Wayne Allard
(Colo.), who is retiring in January. “Earlier this week, we saw the
largest single-day jump in oil prices in history. How do Democrats in Congress react? They attempt to extend the ill-conceived
Udall moratorium on oil shale regulations. This places over 800
billion bbl of potentially recoverable oil out of reach; that’s an energy source larger than the proven reserves of Saudi Arabia,” Allard
said.
Rep. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), who is running to succeed Allard,
and two other Democrats on Colorado’s congressional delegation,
Sen. Ken Salazar and Rep. John Salazar, said on Sept. 24 that they
would try to reinstate the moratorium when Congress comes back
to work.
“The Democrat-controlled Congress is completely ignoring the
needs of our nation,” Allard maintained. “This is not only unfortunate but also insulting to the American people who are struggling
to pay these high fuel prices. This attempt is a clear sign that they
would rather help the economy of foreign oil producers. Had this

misguided moratorium continued, it would have helped [Venezuelan President] Hugo Chavez stimulate his economy more than our
own.”

Statoil teams with schools in heavy oil research
StatoilHydro has partnered with universities in Canada and
Norway to examine ways to improve recovery of heavy oil and oil
sands in an environmentally friendly way.
The group will support PhD students at Canada’s University of
Calgary, University of Alberta, and Vancouver Island University, and
at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)
in Trondheim.
The Canadian universities have broad research experience with
heavy oil, and their projects will complement StatoilHydro’s research activities.
High oil prices have made development of heavy oil and oil
sands projects economically feasible. NTNU rector Torbjorn Digernes said heavy oil would be important in future global energy
scenarios, but these posed serious challenges. Cooperation with
StatoilHydro would be important in identifying solutions.
The universities will collaborate with NTNU in their respective
areas of the value chain for heavy oil production, with the University of Calgary specializing in recovery methods.
The University of Alberta focuses on emulsion stabilization
mechanisms for such oils, while Vancouver Island University deals
with environmental monitoring of their production. ✦

Verenex ﬁnds more oil in Libya’s Ghadames basin oil and 10.3 MMcfd (gross) of gas through 32⁄64-56⁄64 in. chokes,
Libya’s state-owned National Oil Co. said Verenex Energy Inc.
has made a seventh oil discovery on production-sharing contract
Area 47 in Libya’s Ghadames basin.
The discovery, in the Lower Acacus and Memouniat formations,
is Verenex’s second on Block 4 in the northern part of Area 47 and
is the eighth consecutive oil and gas discovery since drilling began
in September 2006.
Exploration well C1-47/04, about 150 km southwest of Tripoli,
was drilled and cased to a depth of 10,155 ft in the Memouniat
Formation. The operator carried out extended flow tests on the
well from 48 ft of perforations in two sandstone intervals. They
included a 28-ft interval in the Memouniat Formation, starting at
9,962 ft, which flowed 900 b/d of 56° gravity oil and 4.2 MMcfd
of gas and a 20-ft interval in the Lower Acacus formation, starting at 7,819 ft, which flowed 150 b/d of 55° gravity oil and 4.5
MMcfd of gas, all through a 32⁄64 in. choke.
The tests yielded a combined maximum measured flow rate—
restricted by test equipment capability—of 1,350 b/d (gross) of

Verenex said.
C1-47/04 (well No. 13) lies 14 km northwest of Verenex’s
nearest oil and gas discovery at A1-47/04 on Block 4.
According to Verenex, eight new field wildcat exploration wells
and two appraisal wells in the area have tested at a maximum aggregate rate of 93,800 b/d and have been suspended as potential
future oil and gas production wells.
The latest find is the seventh in Area 47, in which Verenex and
partner PT Medco Energi Internasional share a 13.7% interest. NOC
holds the remaining 86.3%.

Inpex chooses Darwin, 850 km line for Ichthys
Japanese company Inpex Australia and joint venture partner Total of France have shunned Western Australia and selected Blaydin
Point at Darwin’s Middle Arm Peninsula in the Northern Territory
as the landfall for development of their Ichthys gas-condensate
field in the Browse basin off northwest Western Australia.
Inpex, as operator of the project proposal, believes Northern

Territory’s friendlier business environment, gas-ready location,
significant in-place infrastructure, lack of domestic gas reservation
policy, and closer proximity to the Asian markets will offset the
costs of the 850 km undersea pipeline that will be needed to deliver the gas from the field to Darwin.
Inpex Pres. Naoki Kuroda said Sept. 26 that Darwin provided
the certainty required for the project’s tight schedule to enable first
LNG to come on stream in late 2014 or early 2015.
He added that environmental, economic, and engineering studies demonstrate the viability of Blaydin Point as the best location
for the LNG plant. Front-end engineering and design is expected
to follow shortly to enable a final investment decision by yearend
2009 or early 2010.
Ichthys field in permit WA-285-P holds an estimated 12.8 tcf of
gas plus 527 million bbl of recoverable condensate.
Initial plans calls for a $20 billion (Aus.), two-train project
producing more than 8 million tonnes/year of LNG, 1.6 million
tonnes/year of LPG, and more than 100,000 b/d of condensate.
The project will inject about $50 billion into the Northern Territory economy over the next 20 years, beginning with site work
in 2010. Inpex’s original plan was to pipe gas a much shorter distance to the Maret Islands off Western Australia’s Kimberley coast.
Gas was scheduled to come on stream in 2012, but ongoing delays in Western Australian bureaucracy caused the date to slip into
2013-14.

Production

Mexican production continues downward spiral
Mexico’s state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos said that during January-August 2008 its production of crude oil fell to 2.83 million
b/d or 9.7% while exports dropped 16% compared with the same
period in 2007.
Natural gas production, however, was 6.776 bcfd, up 14% over
the first 8 months of 2007. In August alone, natural-gas production
rose slightly to 6.968 bcfd, up from 6.902 bcfd in July and 5.942
bcfd in August 2007.
The decline in the country’s production of crude oil was led by
its largest field, Cantarell, which dropped 29.2% to 1.11 million
b/d, while output at the second-largest field, Ku-Maloob-Zaap fell
39% to 688,800 b/d.
For August alone, Mexico’s crude oil production slid to 2.76
million b/d due to the decline in overall production and to temporary production glitches.
August production was down from 2.78 million b/d in July
and 2.84 million b/d in August 2007, Pemex said. Production figures for August were the lowest monthly numbers since November
1995.
Mexico exported some 1.44 million b/d of crude during the
January-August 2008 period, down from 1.71 million b/d sold
in the same period last year. However, due to soaring oil prices,
Pemex earned $34.38 billion from exports, or about 51.4% more
than in 2007.
August exports stood at 1.42 million b/d, up slightly from July,
but down from 1.63 million b/d in August 2007.
Mexico President Felipe Calderon has proposed giving Pemex

Western Australia’s approvals process, including restrictive environmental controls, has been blamed for the delays. In addition,
the WA government-federal government-backed plan to select a
single Kimberley hub for all Browse basin projects has added to
the uncertainties.
In contrast, Northern Territory stepped in earlier this year, ensuring Inpex that it had port access and land on which to build,
and that environmental and planning approvals would be streamlined.
Inpex and Total also found gas at the Mimia-1 wildcat in nearby Browse permit WA-344-P earlier this year and that production
likely will be added to the Ichthys system.
Interest now will turn to the likely landfall of Woodside Petroleum group’s Browse gas project, still in its planning stage. Inpex’s
withdrawal from contention throws the question of a Kimberley
hub open to conjecture.
Woodside now may take the view that its best bet also will be a
pipeline extending more than 800 km from its Torosa-BrecknockCalliance fields in the Scott Reef area direct to the Burrup Peninsula
in the Pilbara area, where it is building the Pluto LNG plant. It is
in need of more gas supplies to enable construction of a second
and perhaps third LNG train. This would make the Kimberley hub
unnecessary and obviate the need for Woodside to go through the
lengthy approvals process. ✦

broad financial and managerial autonomy and exempting the stateowned firm from some government rules on procurement and
outsourcing.
While Calderon insists he has no intention of privatizing Pemex, some contend the bonuses the company would be permitted
to offer private contractors represented a disguised form of profitsharing aimed at opening the door to privatization.
The administration is focusing on the search for deepwater oil
in the Gulf of Mexico near areas where the US and Cuba are already
exploring.
The government recently presented an analysis which concluded that the decline in production at Cantarell, Mexico’s largest oil
field and located in the Sound of Campeche, was costing Pemex
$10 billion/year.
The study said production at Mexico’s main oil fields would fall
by 800,000 b/d by 2012, with the drop in output reaching 1.5
million b/d by 2018.

California OKs Occidental Long Beach drilling
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed legislation enabling oil exploration and drilling in Wilmington oil field
in Long Beach.
Under Bill 2165, California’s State Lands Commission can negotiate a contract with the city and Occidental Petroleum Corp. to
explore and develop the western end of Wilmington field, which
includes tidelands mineral deposits.
In the past, California shouldered most costs for previous oil
efforts in the tidelands deposits, but Occidental offered to take on

earlier criticism voiced in testimony before the country’s parliament, has approved the construction of a floating oil storage facility for the Cepu oil and gas block.
“The study shows the floating storage facility is more feasible
economically [than land storage],” said BPMIgas head R. Priyono,
who added that the floating facility would be easier to implement
as it did not require the sometimes costly and time-consuming
process of acquiring land.
Earlier in September, the Indonesian parliament heard a report
that a floating offshore storage project jointly planned by ExxonMobil Corp. and state-owned PT Pertamina EP might incur up to
$1.2 billion in state losses (OGJ Online, Sept. 12, 2008).
The report attracted the attention of members of parliament—
who currently are eyeing illegal expense claims—as it came from
Hestu Subagyo, a former director of PT Pertamina EP.
Hestu claimed that the decision to build a floating storage facility was made solely by ExxonMobil, without any involvement on
the part of Pertamina EP, which he said rejected the idea from the
start.
According to Hestu, Pertamina had instead proposed renting
land storage, which would be far cheaper than constructing the
floating storage facility.
But Priyono rejected Hestu’s testimony, noting that the project
feasibility study was made jointly by ExxonMobil and Pertamina.
“It’s impossible that BPMigas would approve the project without Pertamina’s participation,” said Priyono, who noted that, “Hestu also signed the report.”
BPMigas approved the proposal for a floating storage facility
with a capacity of 2 million bbl in May 2007. A tender currently is
underway for procurement of the facility.
Earlier this week, Pertamina announced plans to invest some
$500 million of company funds in the Cepu Block, which it shares
50:50 with ExxonMobil (OGJ Online Sept. 23, 2008). The Cepu
Indonesia approves storage facility for Cepu
Block is estimated to hold some 600 million bbl of oil along with
Indonesia’s upstream oil and gas regulator BPMigas, rejecting 1.7 tcf of natural gas. ✦

that role in exchange for a larger share of the potential revenues—
an offer that required the new legislation.
Occidental spokesman Richard Kline said the Los Angeles-based
firm needs a new contract with more financial incentives to make
the Wilmington deal worthwhile. The current agreement gives 95%
of revenue to the state and 5% to Occidental—too little to allow the
firm to recover its investment.
Altogether, Occidental is expected to invest more than $200
million to increase production by injecting water, carbon dioxide,
or other material into some of the field’s estimated 500-700 existing wells. Occidental would also drill as many as 200 new wells,
Kline said.
Bill 2165 does not allow for offshore drilling or expansion of
the existing drilling area. According to officials, Occidental would
use directional drilling techniques to reach beneath the port’s tidelands, increasing output by as much as 63%.
Long Beach city analysts say that under the agreement with Occidental, reserves could rise by 22 million bbl from the current 35
million bbl in the West Wilmington unit, where the new drilling
is planned.
Any drilling also must comply with existing regulations of the
South Coast Air Quality Management District, as well as the California Environmental Quality Act.
Wilmington, which produces about 8,500 b/d, is California’s
sixth largest oil field. It has produced more than 2.5 billion bbl
since 1932, when General Petroleum, an antecedent of ExxonMobil Corp., drilled the first well.
Last year, it was reported that the central area of Wilmington
field is in the midst of a redevelopment project over the next few
years, with Los Angeles city authorities approving the drilling of as
many as 540 directional oil and water injection wells from central
facilities (OGJ Online, Feb. 19, 2007).

Processing
UOP to upgrade Abu Dhabi reﬁnery
Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Co. (Takreer) selected UOP LLC, a Honeywell International company based in Des Plaines, Ill., to supply
technology and engineering services for upgrading its 120,000
b/d Ruwais refinery 240 km west of Abu Dhabi City in the UAE.
The value of the project was not revealed.
The refinery will produce propylene, unleaded gasoline, naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas, aviation turbine fuel, kerosine, gas-oil,
bunker fuel, and other hydrocarbon derivatives. Basic engineering
design is under way and is expected to be completed in 2014.
The facility will utilize a wide range of UOP technologies for
the production of low-sulfur distillate and gasoline, including its
Unicracking and Unionfining processes to upgrade heavy feedstocks and produce ultralow-sulfur diesel and its Merox process to
remove sulfur from saturated LPG streams. In addition, the company’s BenSat process will manage the benzene content in the gasoline pool.
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
The refinery includes a hydrotreating unit that will use UOP’s
naphtha hydrotreating process and a distillate Unionfining unit to
produce low-sulfur kerosine. The unit is the largest kerosine-fed
hydrotreating unit licensed by UOP.

Synthesis licenses ExxonMobil’s technology
Synthesis Energy Systems (SES), Houston, signed a technology
licensing agreement with ExxonMobil Research & Engineering Co.
(EMRE) that provides SES the option to execute up to 15 methanolto-gasoline (MTG) licenses.
SES assigned the first license to a 7,000 b/cd unit at its U-Gas
coal gasification project under development near Benwood, W. Va.,
where Consol Energy Inc. has a coal mine. SES and Consol are negotiating a joint venture agreement.
ExonMobil’s MTG technology converts crude methanol directly
to low-sulfur, low-benezene gasoline that can be sold directly or
blended with conventional gasoline.

East, and West zones. CRE indicated that this will provide greater
competition among the various gas sources: Norwegian gas, North
European sources, LNG, and Russian gas. The merger was made
possible through reinforcement of the network developed by GRTgaz. (OGJ Online, July 3, 2008).
In the South of France, notes CRE, investments TIGF and GRTgaz
make on Artere de Guyenne will eliminate congestion where their
networks meet.
CRE warned that important investments will be needed in the
next few years to reduce congestion between northern and southern France and to ease access for new market entrants.
Interconnections between Belgium and Spain also are needed
to satisfy markets and bolster supply security, while new methane
terminal projects and gas-generated power units will require reinforcement of the transportation networks. ✦

CORRECTIONS
In the Sept. 15 special report, OGJ200, Cano Petroleum Inc. should have

at No. 20 with 116.6 million bbl.

In the Sept. 22 article revealing PDVSA’s criticism of Orimulsion, quotation marks were incorrectly placed, making it appear that an aside remark
was the author’s. It should have read:

The Tasnee ethylene plant in Al-Jubail, Saudi Arabia, achieved on-spec ethylene
production on August 23, 2008 following mechanical completion on July 15, 2008,
which is six weeks ahead of schedule.
The plant which was built for Saudi Ethylene and Polyethylene Company (SEPC) by
the consortium Linde Engineering and Samsung Engineering Co. Ltd., with Fluor as PMC,
has a capacity of 1 MM MTA.
This remarkable success was achieved due to outstanding execution by Linde and
Samsung in a difcult environment with a shortage of qualied manpower and tight
markets for material and equipment supply. The cracker of SEPC, a joint venture of
Tasnee, Sahara and Basell, is the rst cracker to come on stream several months ahead
of other cracker projects in Saudi Arabia which were also awarded in 2005.
With this success Linde and Samsung clearly demonstrate their leading position in
technology and project execution in the Middle East.

Warming blame off base
I get so tired of reading such onesided, biased letters as Jeff Temple’s on
the question of global warming and his
conclusion that it is the oil industry that
is primarily responsible (OGJ, July 7,
2008, p. 12).
Certainly, there is global warming occurring at this time as in the past, and it
has melted most of the ice that covered
much of North America during the past
20,000 years. But Mr. Temple’s primary
blaming of the oil industry is way off
base.
An article by Arthur B. Robinson,
Noah E. Robinson, and Willie Soon
published in the December 2007 Journal
of American Physicians and Surgeons
reports research that strongly rejects the
theory that hydrocarbons are primarily
responsible for global warming. Their
research is backed by the endorsement
of 31,072 American scientists.

Cooling or warming?
I read with interest David Archibald’s
letter on “Warming or cooling?” (OGJ,
Aug. 11, 2008, p. 12).
There is lots of discussion about solar
cycles and their apparent relation to
warming (or cooling) of the earth.
It is safe to say Archibald’s findings
differ from the majority of climate scientists working in this field.
His conclusions suggest the earth is
actually cooling, and man-made carbondioxide contributions are “minuscule”
to the big picture.
Hasn’t he been keeping up on current events? He surely must be aware
of the retreat of almost every glacier on
earth? Melting glaciers reflect long-term
heating (or cooling) trends. If David’s
conclusions are correct, glaciers should
not be retreating.
Is he aware the permafrost is melting?
That, too, would suggest evidence of a
long-term trend that is counter to the
findings of this article.

Is he aware the ocean levels are rising
around the earth? The Alaskan coastline
is being battered with rising sea levels.
Low-lying Pacific islands are loosing
ground to rising oceans. Again: longterm evidence that counters this letter’s
conclusions.
This paper is not an objective discussion on the topic. The astute reader
might conclude the Oil & Gas Journal
does not want a balanced discussion. I
would hope for a more objective coverage of a subject that will have profound
effects on your readers and customers.

Falcon Gas Storage Company

You know us as the largest operator of high-deliverability,
multi-cycle natural gas storage in North Texas. Now discover
our expanding role as a major midstream service provider in
the Barnett Shale.
Our NorTex Gas Storage subsidiary is meeting the needs of the
largest U.S. onshore gas production area with two cryogenic
gas processing plants providing 120,000 Mcfd of capacity and
a 60-mile, high-pressure pipeline that can transport more than
450,000 Mcfd of Barnett Shale gas. These assets complement our
North Texas gas storage facilities, Hill-Lake and Worsham-Steed,
with more than 35 Bcf of capacity and nearly 1 Bcfd of injection
and withdrawal capability.
Storage, processing and transportation in one of the nation’s

A hard kick in the face
The city will pay $25 million to haul
away all of the debris.
People helped each other wherever,
however they could.

Judy R. Clark
Senior Associate Editor
Hurricane Ike, 600 miles in diameter, devastated Haiti and Cuba then
came roaring into the Texas Gulf Coast
in the wee hours of Saturday, Sept. 13,
and gave the Galveston-Houston areas a
sodden hard kick in the face.
Normally bustling with more than 4
million people, Houston was eerily dark
and quiet following the storm’s 8-hr
battering that littered manicured lawns
with tons of debris and toppled majestic trees and power lines in a jarring
tangle that would take weeks to clear.
Few people were unaffected.
To the south, whole neighborhoods
were chewed up and spit out by the
enormous storm surge that left only
colossal debris piles and a few isolated
posts where beautiful beachfront communities had been. At least 64 persons
in Texas died.
In the aftermath, a stunned populous
found themselves in the dark with little
available electricity, water, food, gasoline, or means of communication. Gas
stations could not pump gasoline, tap
water had to be boiled, grocery shelves
were bare, cell phones didn’t work, areas were flooded, mosquitoes swarmed,
and a curfew was necessary to protect
people and vacated homes. Laundry was
a problem, businesses were closed, and
there were long lines for food, water,
and gasoline.
In the sultry air, it was difficult for
the “most-air-conditioned city in the
world” to be without cooling for 2-3
weeks. But Texans are resilient. The
long, hard cleanup began immediately.

the special demands of processing oil sands crudes. Such

computer based designers who
have little or no experience and
never leave the office. They are
developed only by engineers

Shouldn’t this be kept in mind
by those considering long term

The energy factor
A credit implosion threatening US prosperity
magnifies the costs of errors in energy policy, of
which the federal government has committed far
too many in recent years. While attention now
properly focuses on keeping a liquidity crisis centered on bad mortgage debt from strangling the
US economy and infecting the rest of the world,
energy cannot for long stay in the shadows. It’s
too important to economic health. And politicians
have mistreated it for too long.
Hopeful signs glint in the gloom. Congress
this month dropped moratoriums in effect since
the 1980s on leasing of undrilled acreage on the
Outer Continental Shelf. And, in his first debate
against Democratic presidential contender Barack
Obama, Republican John McCain gave voice to his
politically bold opposition to subsidies for fuel
ethanol.
But those are isolated exceptions to a national
orientation toward energy that remains fundamentally wrong. They should arise instead as part of an
energy strategy fully integrated with responses to
the immediate crisis. Aligning energy with economic imperatives, however, requires a political
discussion more enlightened than anything heard
lately from the American political machinery.

Urge to spend
Both presidential candidates and most lawmakers, for example, still wail against imported oil
for reasons that are at best skewed and at worst
xenophobic. Foreign oil surely is less desirable
than domestically produced energy. At the point of
consumption, though, it beats any energy, domestic or not, that costs more.
Such economic verity escapes notice in the
US, which commits itself to ever-growing public
spending on noncommercial energy forms that
promise minor contributions to supply. This urge
to spend money on energy whose only appeal is
that it isn’t foreign oil needs to be brought under
control. It has opened up a budgetary drain when
national fiscal health is in jeopardy.
The natural linkage of energy and fiscal policies doesn’t end there. First word of a proposal
to use public funds to buy $700 billion worth of
bad mortgages seemed to ease equity markets but
weakened the US dollar, which had been recover22

ing from the abysmal levels it reached in the first
half of this year. Apparently, currency markets
worried about the bail-out’s budgetary effects.
When the dollar weakened, the price of crude oil
rebounded in line with the inverse relationship
evident earlier this year before falling anew when
the deal collapsed and concern turned to economic health and demand for oil.
Obviously, the dollar’s value isn’t the only factor
in oil-price movements. Some economists say the
relationship is illusory. But the strong correlation
that emerged at a time of exceptional dollar weakness shouldn’t be ignored. A government rescue of
the financial system, hardly a sure bet at this writing, would expand the federal budget deficit and
weaken the dollar if unaccompanied by economic
growth, which will be difficult to achieve under
any circumstances. The weaker dollar, if the crudedollar correlation outweighs demand questions in
traders’ minds, would raise the nominal price for
crude and lower growth prospects.
These interconnections compel the government
to reject anything that expands the deficit without
sound economic reason, such as limitless expenditure on energy forms that do nothing but perpetuate fantasies about energy independence. They also
compel the government to favor anything that
promises to generate incomes and tax revenues,
boost domestic energy supply on a meaningful
scale, and—oh, yes—trim oil imports. Leasing of
federal land, on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
coastal plain as well as the OCS, serves those goals.
The need is urgent.

Clarifying vision
The credit crisis thus erects a framework within
which the US can address energy as a central element of economic strategy. The very real threat of
economic collapse should clarify America’s energy
vision. Correction of past mistakes can shed costs
from the economy and federal budget, neither of
which should have to carry extra baggage through
the perilous course ahead. And development of
commercial supply from natural resources can
help strengthen the economy and balance national
accounts.
At this anxious moment in history, the US
must, at last, get energy policy right. ✦

‘Vast amounts of capital’

P

erhaps it was because of the
proposed multibillion-dollar Wall
Street bailout that the expiration of
US Outer Continental Shelf leasing moratoriums on Sept. 30 went
largely unnoticed (see p. 39). But it’s
likelier that nearly everyone involved
recognizes the fight isn’t over.
“Lifting the decades-old ban...is
good news for the millions of American consumers...calling for the ban to
be lifted, but it is only the first step.
Congress should avoid reimposing
this ban or any other obstacles to US
oil and natural gas resources,” said
the American Petroleum Institute.
That same day, Natural Resources
Defense Council official Rob Perks
said, “Sadly, many elected officials
who get that drilling won’t lower
prices at the pump or put a dent in
our country’s oil dependence nevertheless were unable to stop Big Oil
and its friends in Congress.”
“And in this election year, President Bush’s threatened veto of a
federal spending bill authorizing
renewal of the drilling ban made the
risk of a government shutdown too
great for the Democrats to ignore,”
he continued on API’s web site.

Association executives said such
provisions made the bill questionable; House Republicans called it a
sham.
Still, some considered the OCS
moratoriums’ expiration a milestone.
“Not only is Congress tackling the
problem of rising energy prices head
on by encouraging domestic energy
development, we are doing so by
working together across party lines,”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said after the continuing
resolution passed by 78 to 12 votes.

Refused to discuss it

Others were less upbeat. Sen. Thad
Cochran (R-Miss.) said a continuing
resolution became necessary when
Democrats refused to allow OCS leasing amendments.
The result? “Before us, we now

In a floor statement, Peterson noted
that commodity trading volumes have
climbed dramatically in recent years.
“This increase includes vast amounts of
capital from parties that are not traditional futures market participants such
as index funds, pension funds, and
some hedge funds,” he said.
“The presence of this additional
capital has raised concerns that the
resulting futures market prices may not
accurately represent the forces of supply
and demand, nor may they be fundamentally supported at the local selling
points where those in the producing
and selling of commodities are doing
business,” Peterson said.
The bill would go farther than the
recommendations in CFTC’s swap dealers and index traders report. In addition
to removing these market participants
from the commercial trading category,
the study recommended development
and publication of a new periodic supplemental report on OTC swap dealer
activity, creation of a new CFTC data
collection office with enhanced procedures and staffing, and development of
“long form” reporting for some larger
traders to more accurately assess their
type of trading activity.
Other recommendations included
adding staff and resources, encouraging more clearing of OTC transactions,
and reviewing swap dealer commodity
research independence.
“Transparency is healthy to regulators, participants, and the market,” Lukken said at the Sept. 11 hearing. “Certainly, opening the drapes and shedding
more light would be welcome. We were
concerned that swap dealers had a loophole and were using it to get around
reporting requirements. Having said
this, we didn’t find a significant number

shouldn’t be allowed to do it,” he said.
Lukken said CFTC had not fully examined an independent report released
on Sept. 10 which concluded that
speculators were a likelier cause of oil
price volatility in 2008 than underlying
supply and demand. “My first impression is that there’s a lot of margin of
error and reverse engineering in their
numbers. Our staff is still studying it,”
he said.

‘100% ﬁction’
Energy economist Philip K. Verleger
Jr., president of PK Verleger LLC, issued
a statement that day calling Michael W.
Masters’ and Adam K. White’s report,
The Accidental Hunt Brothers, Part 2, a
“piece that is 100% fiction” and “the
worst example of junk economic analysis published in a very long time.”
Verleger said oil prices rose during

the first part of 2008 because light,
sweet grades were in short supply
because of continued US purchases and
political problems in Nigeria. Prices
came down after mid-July because new
light, sweet crude production from
Thunder Horse field in the Gulf of
Mexico began, production in Nigeria
stabilized, and the US finally stopped
taking light, sweet crude off the market,
he said.
But two business groups separately
said on Sept. 18 that stronger commodity market regulation is needed
to halt excessive speculation affecting
natural gas as well as crude oil prices.
“It has cost natural gas consumers over
$40.4 billion from January to August
2008 when compared to the same time
period last year,” said Paul N. Cicio,
president of the Industrial Energy Consumers of America.

Cicio said the US Energy Information
Administration reports that domestic
gas production rose by 8.6% from January to August, demand was essentially
unchanged from the previous year, and
national inventories were within their
normal range. “These facts prove that
the price spike was not driven by supply vs. demand fundamentals,” Cicio
said. He said HR 6604 was a good beginning but fell short of needed mandatory position limits in the OTC market.
American Public Gas Association Pres. Bert Kalisch said consumer
confidence in the gas market has been
shaken, and additional transparency
measures are needed to restore trust. He
also indicated that speculative investment played a role in pushing gas prices
higher recently and stated that “consumers should not be forced to pay a
‘speculative premium.’” ✦

would be released before yearend.
During 2006-08, Petrobras explored
and discovered light oil in presalt
reservoirs, including eight discoveries
in the deepwater Campos basin with
28-30° oil. Filho said cluster drilling
in the Santos basin’s Litoral Norte led
to discoveries of light oil in complex
carbonate reservoirs, typified by Tupi
and Iaga. The salt is 2,000-m thick, and
the hydrocarbons have associated CO2.
The high-pressure, acid environment
requires special production equipment.
Filho believes Brazil’s presalt prospectivity is greater than that of the
Gulf of Mexico, noting that all nine

are 25,000-28,000 ft subsea.
Chevron is working on ultradeepwater developments with long-distance
tiebacks of more than 50 miles for
oil and more than 200 miles for gas.
Thurston said the company plans to
drill through as much as 3,300 m of
salt, and anticipates host facilities “with
small field tie-ins.”

Chevron

Shell

Chevron Vice-Pres. Steven P. Thurston
said the company has made 25 discoveries in deep water and is running 18
deepwater projects, with 8 of those
already producing. Thurston participated
in the subsalt experiences plenary on
behalf of Melody Meyer, president of
Chevron Energy Technology Co.
Chevron is investing billions in Brazil
as a partner with Petrobras on Campos
basin Block BC-20, which includes the
Frade discovery, and in other areas.
Deepwater developments require
integrated surface and subsurface
technologies, he said. Chevron is working in deep water because it “offers a
significant reward,” and the company
can leverage its people, portfolio, and
deepwater capability. He described
wide-azimuth 3D seismic as a “breakthrough” technology because of its use
in subsalt imaging.
Thurston noted the success of the
extended production test in 2006 at
the subsalt Jack discovery in the Gulf
of Mexico’s Lower Tertiary trend. The
water at Jack is deeper than 2,000 m
and the well’s TD was more than 8,000
m. Chevron will next run a well test at
nearby St. Malo, also on Walker Ridge.
The company uses titanium tubulars to
mitigate high temperatures and pressures, and plans for subsea artificial lift
and pumping systems.
“We believe we will find a commercial solution,” Thurston said.
Thurston mentioned the installation of the topsides on the Tahiti truss
spar in Green Canyon Block 640,

Peter Voser, chief financial officer
at Shell, described the company as a
deepwater pioneer, citing the Perdido
development in the Gulf of Mexico and
the BC-10 development in Brazil.
Voser said Shell has discovered 8
billion bbl of oil globally in the last 7
years and increased its research and
development spending to $1.2 billion/year, up from $500,000/year. He
mentioned the success of ocean bottom
sensor technology in seismic imaging.
Shell is building a new class of rigs
called “bully rigs” and will take delivery of the first in 2010. It expects to
improve fuel and safety performance
and plans to use them in the Arctic and
in deep water.
Voser said Shell has the largest LNG
capacity of any IOC, and the company
is investigating the use of floating LNG
systems to tap and monetize hard-toreach gas.
Shell’s subsalt experience began
with Groningen gas field, discovered
in 1959, that has been producing since
1965. The company is adding compression at Groningen and using it as a
swing producer.
About 10% of Shell’s annual production comes from subsalt wells in
Gabon, Oman, Kashagan, and the Gulf
of Mexico.
In Oman, Shell is involved in a JV
with Petroleum Development Oman
LLC to develop intrasalt and presalt
carbonate fields requiring advanced
well techniques. PDO is a joint venture

of the government of Oman 60%, Royal
Dutch/Shell Group 34%, Total SA 4%,
and Partex Oman Corp. 2%.
In the Gulf of Mexico, the Princess
subsalt well was discovered in 2000,
in water 1,083 m deep on Mississippi
Canyon Block 765. Production began in
2002.
Shell has had downstream interests
in Brazil since 1913. It now has interest
in 10 offshore blocks, including 5 in
the Santos basin. The company currently
produces about 26,000 boed from
Bijupira-Salema. Voser said Shell will
drill more than 10 new subsalt wells in
the coming years, in water deeper than
1,500 m. The company is fabricating
subsea hardware in Brazil, and plans
to incorporate subsea separation and
pumping. The FPSO for BC-10 should
arrive soon.

Panel
In a panel discussion on Sept. 16,
Chevron, Schlumberger, and Petrobras
discussed technological and economic
challenges of exploring and exploiting
subsalt reservoirs.
Mark Riding, deepwater theme director at Schlumberger, described a new
seismic acquisition method developed
by Schlumberger. “Coil shooting” is
a full-azimuth (FAZ) technique with
a circular geometry, in which a single
vessel sails in overlapping circles,
acquiring data constantly. Riding said
FAZ data images subsalt more accurately
than wide-azimuth data.
Riding also mentioned magnetotellurics, optimized drilling and well
placement, geosteering, and fluid sampling and analysis (fluid profiling) as
important technologies that will enable
cost-efficient development of subsalt
reservoirs.
“Deepwater E&P is on a technology
fast track,” he said.
Petrobras and partners began drilling
presalt prospects in the Santos basin in
2005.
Brazil’s national petroleum agency
(ANP) approved five new deepwater fields in the Santos basin: Parati

(BM-S-21), and Carioca and Guará
(both BM-S-9). Three more fields are
under negotiation, according to Jose
Formigli, executive manager of subsalt
E&P at Petrobras.
The presalt reservoirs are complex
carbonates, chiefly extensional basin sag

(“sag”) and synrift (“rift”) formations.
Petrobras produced 1.79 million
b/d in 2007 and expects production to
increase at least 7%/year through 2012.
In addition, the company anticipates
that its new presalt fields in the Santos

basin will begin commercial production in 2010, with a “steep ramp-up”
to follow. By 2017, the presalt cluster
in Santos will produce 1.126 million
boed, Formigli said.
Petrobras said it will release its business plan for 2009-20 next month. ✦

SPE: Industry cites unconventional resources potential
Guntis Moritis
Production Editor
The estimated vast unconventional
resources hold much promise for substantially adding to the world’s energy
needs, but developing these resources
entails overcoming many restraints,
attendees were told Sept. 22 during
the opening session of the Society of
34

Petroleum Engineers Annual Conference
& Exhibition in Denver.
The speakers expected production
from these resources to grow but each
listed some practical barriers and limitations that may hinder development
such as rising infrastructure costs and
limited human capabilities.
Demand forecasts are that the world
will need 50% more energy in the next

25 years, creating a need to continue
developing unconventional resources
from tight gas, shale gas, coalbed methane, Canadian oil sands, and oil shale, as
discussed in the session.

emphasized the need to have sufficiently high oil prices to develop unconventional resources economically.
“At today’s prices development of
these resources makes sense,” he said.
Recent high oil prices have squeezed
oil demand out of system but in the
future, demand will continue increasing
because of energy needs in such countries as China and India, Adkins said. He
does see oil demand continuing to fall
in the economically developed countries. In the US, he expects a continued
minus 2% year-on-year demand drop.
Adkins noted that the world does
not have an oil bubble because of the
limited potential to increase production
rates, especially in non-Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries countries. He added that more rigs are drilling but production growth is not taking
place. He expects an average $130/bbl
oil price on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in 2009.

Tight gas
Charles B. Stanley, executive vicepresident and chief operating officer,

Questar Corp., noted that tight gas
development entails much more intense
investment and activity than conventional gas.
Stanley said conventional gas reservoirs had a 70-80% recovery factor,
with a few wells and limited infrastructure. In contrast, unconventional
gas development requires many wells,
he said. The wells decline by 60-70%
during the first year and recover about
one half of their recoverable gas in 5-6
years, with the remaining gas produced
in the next 6-40 years, he added.
In the US, about one half of its
produced gas is from tight gas, shales,
and coal beds, and by 2020 this will increase to 60-70%, according to Stanley.
He noted that the US currently has
an 8% year-to-year ramp-up in unconventional gas production.
Innovations in drilling, completions,
and reservoir characterization have allowed development of these resources,
Stanley said. Some innovations, he
noted, were in rig design, bit design,
new drilling fluids, directional drilling,
fracing, coring, and microseismic.

Stanley said US permitting problems
persist because local and state agencies
are not staffed to handle the large number of wells needed to recover gas from
unconventional resources.

Oil shale
Glen Vawter, executive director,
National Oil Shale Association, said current oil shale research and development
concerns in situ retorting. In the 1980s,
before the US oil shale industry went
bust, projects primarily involved mining and surface retorting. He noted that
four of the main companies doing work
in Colorado oil shales are Royal Dutch
Shell PLC, ExxonMobil Corp., Chevron
Corp., and American Shale Oil Co. in
Colorado.
Vawter noted that this work is
still in the research, development,
and demonstration phase but he also
expects gradual US oil shale development with possible production rates of
100,000-200,000 b/d in the next 25
years. He also noted that oil shales have
much potential in many parts of the
world. ✦

Bodman: Russia using energy as foreign policy ‘tool’
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
US Sec. of Energy Samuel Bodman,
concerned about Russia’s use of energy
as a tool of foreign policy, said he
would take up the issue with officials at
a meeting next week in Vienna.
“I am concerned when...there seems
to be a pattern of using energy and
their God-given resources to affect foreign policy,” Bodman said at an energy
conference in Washington, DC. “That’s
a situation that bears looking into,” he
said.
Bodman’s remarks coincided with
reports that Abdalla Salem El-Badri, the
secretary-general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, would
visit Moscow on Oct. 21-24.
The aim of El-Bari’s visit is to hold

talks following the attendance of a
high-level Russian delegation, led by
Vice-Premier Igor Sechin, at recent
OPEC meetings.
At the meetings, Sechin proposed
“extensive cooperation” with OPEC to
meet global energy needs and said a
draft memorandum of understanding
would be drawn up to strengthen ties
with the group.
While OPEC officials have downplayed the idea that Russia would join
the organization, there are concerns in
the US and elsewhere that Moscow will
attempt to influence the group in connection with world markets—a point
emphasized by Russian energy minister
Sergei Shmatko on Sept. 26.

A more active position
“A Russian delegation attended the

recent OPEC meeting, and I want to tell
you what many of those in our delegation were saying: Russia needs to take
a more active position concerning the
current market price for oil,” Shmatko
said, adding, “There needs to be a Russian factor.”
“We have always told OPEC, which
tries to regulate it, that there are other
factors: financial speculation, US inventories, etc. From our standpoint, we
occupy such an important place in oil
‘high society’ we should be our own,
Russian factor, perhaps not just one,”
Shmatko said.
“In any case, the [Russian] energy
ministry has set that goal for itself. We
will be preparing if not proposals then
at least approaches. We haven’t done
this before. We want to formulate these
approaches. And in that sense the deci-

sions might be most unexpected. Why
not, for example, revise oil production
forecasts?” he said.
“We believe we should more actively
engage with the markets. Technological
considerations prevent us from simply
turning off the tap. We can’t simply shut
down a field and then open it up again
at any time. We have different climatic
conditions. In my view we can give
our opinion from the point of view of
forecasts, perhaps even engage in that in
actuality,” Shmatko said.
“The idea of reserving potential
fields is very interesting in my view.
Instead of discovering a field tomorrow
and then proceeding [with development], we prepare a field from the
point of view that it won’t be touched
for the time being, but there will be the
ability to start it up in a fairly clearly
defined term,” he said.
“We are absolutely convinced, given
those ‘American bumps’ oil prices have
experienced in recent times, that we, a
big, important oil power, need to formulate our relation to that—the Russian
factor,” Shmatko said.
As for when the new approaches

would be ready, Shmatko said: “We
are going to the next OPEC meeting
in December, and I think we will have
something before then.
“This is not a joint effort with
OPEC,” he added.

A new oil consortium?
Bodman’s comments coincided with
reports that Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin of Russia and President Hugo
Chavez of OPEC member Venezuela
have established plans to create an oil
consortium aimed at investing in joint
oil ventures.
“[The Russians have] offered us the
chance to create an oil consortium...
the largest in the world,” said Chavez
in televised remarks from Moscow,
adding that the consortium would be
comprised of state-owned Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, Russia’s Lukoil Holdings,
TNK, OAO Rosneft, and OAO Gazprom.
The venture initially would develop
oil and gas projects in Venezuela then
in other Latin American countries at a
later time, Venezuela’s communications
ministry said in a statement.

While Russia may be using diplomatic efforts to affect market prices,
it also has been criticized for using
military tactics to control the flow of oil
and gas.
In August, Russia attacked neighboring Georgia and was accused of efforts
to undermine the transport of hydrocarbons from the Caspian-Central Asia
region to world markets.
During the hostilities, Georgia accused Russia of attempting to bomb all
three of the main pipelines through the
country: the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and
Baku-Supsa oil pipelines and the South
Caucasus Pipeline, which carries gas to
Turkey.
Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy head of
Russia’s general staff during the incursion denied early reports of attacks on
the BTC line by his country, saying:
“The oil pipeline was never a target that
needed to be bombed” (OGJ Online,
Aug. 12, 2008).
The Russian military incursion nonetheless caused the closure of oil and gas
pipelines, as well as railway lines and
ports, across the region (OGJ Online,
Aug. 25, 2008). ✦

discoveries off Brazil are evidence of

In deep water, ROVs are a key enabling technology for drilling and field
development, and increasingly service

thousands of existing underwater installations worldwide, she said.
The analysts conclude that over the

dual demands of market growth and

compares with 411 over the past 5
years. ✦

FERC approves Oregon Columbia River LNG project
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission on Sept. 18 approved the
first new LNG terminal and related
send-out pipeline in the Pacific Northwest after a 31⁄2-year review. Developers
of the Bradwood Landing project on
the Columbia River in Oregon will be
required to fully implement 109 mitigation measures as a condition of the
approval, FERC said.
The federal agency said the project,
which would deliver as much as 1.3
bcfd of gas, consists of an LNG terminal consisting of a single marine berth,
two insulated storage tanks, and other
related facilities 20 miles east of Astoria, Ore. A 36.3-mile pipeline would
connect with the Williams Northwest
pipeline north of Kelso, Wash.
Gas from the project would be
delivered to two contracted customers,
Georgia Pacific Corp.’s mill in Wauna,
Ore., and Portland General Electric Co.’s
Beaver power plant, as well as into intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines through interconnections with
Northwest Natural Gas Co. and Williams
Northwest Pipeline, FERC said.
Final approval came after the project’s sponsor, NorthernStar Natural Gas
Inc. of Houston, was granted prefiling
status on Mar. 7, 2005. NorthernStar
said that FERC’s consideration of the
proposed project ran more than a year
longer than for any previous LNG project and reflects the agency’s detailed and
in-depth review.

NorthernStar said it expects to obtain
the remaining required permits in the
next several months. Construction is
scheduled to begin in 2009, and the
project is expected to become fully operational in 2012, according to NorthernStar, which is developing two other
West Coast LNG projects.

A substantial record
FERC Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher
said the required mitigation measures
primarily reflect safety and environmental considerations. “Our order is
also based on a substantial record that
encompasses more than 50,000 pages
of material. We carefully considered
more than 1,827 public comments,
many of which came from six scoping
meetings held in Oregon, and numerous studies and analyses from federal,
state, and local agencies,” he indicated.
“Bradwood Landing can help meet
the project energy needs of the Pacific
Northwest in a safe, secure manner
with limited adverse environmental
impacts. It also provides [the US] with
direct access to the LNG markets in the
Pacific region,” Kelliher said.
FERC said its review of the proposed
project also included consideration of
a report by Oregon’s Department of
Energy to the state’s governor and an
examination of alternatives, including
different projects and sites, alternative energy sources, and the potential
for energy conservation and renewable sources to replace the need for the
Bradwood Landing project.
It said that denying approval would

deprive the region of a new natural gas
source. “Energy conservation cannot
replace the natural gas needed in the
future but can be a complementary
component in the overall energy supply
and demand mix. Renewable energy
resources would not be able to provide
the amount of energy equivalent to the
Bradwood Landing project,” FERC said
in its approval order.

Filtered water system
The 109 mitigation measures that
FERC’s staff recommended and the
commission adopted include a requirement for NorthernStar to install a system capable of delivering filtered water
from the Columbia River to the LNG
tankers for ballast and engine cooling
during off-loading while the vessels are
at berth.
FERC said the system’s water intakes
would require screens to prevent the
potential entrapment or entrainment
of juvenile fish. It also will require
NorthernStar to conduct postinstallation
water flow assessments of the screens
for review and approval by the director
of the federal agency’s Office of Energy
Projects prior to operation.
It denied requests from Oregon’s
governor and others, in response to the
project’s final environmental impact
statement, to issue a supplemental
EIS. FERC also rejected requests from
Columbia Riverkeeper, a water quality
advocacy organization based in Hood
River, Ore., and others for a formal evidentiary hearing to develop a record on
the project’s need and potential impacts.

Now Russians
enter Somalia

T

he oil industry may think it can
breathe a sigh of relief now that
authorities in Somalia have called for
help in getting rid of pirates infesting its waters. But think before you
breathe.
“I call on the Somali people to
fight against the pirates,” said Somali
President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed. “I
also call on the international community to act quickly on what is
happening in Somali waters as well as
on shore.”
Yusuf was speaking just a week
after the seizure of a Ukrainian cargo
ship—the MV Faina—carrying tanks
and other weaponry. The seizure attracted further international attention
on piracy off Somalia, whose waters
command access to a route through
which about 30% of the world’s oil
transits.
“I condemn the pirates, who are
undermining trade and international
maritime traffic off the Somali coast,”
said Yusuf. “They are imposing an
embargo on the Somali people and
the international community because
they are blocking movement between
the Mediterranean and the Indian
Ocean, which affects not only Somalia but the whole world,” Yusuf said.

Common sense approach
So far, so good. It seems like common sense. And the international
community did appear to be doing
just what Yusuf asked for as several
US warships blockaded the MV Faina
to prevent the offloading of its military cargo.
But Yusuf apparently was not
happy enough with that sort of action by US and allied forces in the
region. He wants stronger remedies
38

and has asked the Russians to provide
them—at least according to the Somali ambassador in Moscow.
Somalia welcomes Russian help
in fighting piracy off its coast and is
“not satisfied” with warships from
other countries, said Ambassador
Mohammed Mahmud Handule.
President Yusuf “gave permission
for Russian ships to enter the sea (off
Somalia) and fight the pirates in the
sea and on the coast,” he said.

FERC extended the comment period
on the draft EIS to 120 days from
45, collected additional comments at
six public meetings in Oregon and
Washington, and reviewed studies and
analyses from government agencies,
third-party contractors, and others
involving safety, security, and environmental issues.
Parties will have 30 days after the
order is issued to appeal the decision,
FERC said. ✦

UGI: Unconventional
gas wealth seen
in world’s basins

Russia complies

G. Alan Petzet
Chief Editor-Exploration

“Many warships can be found near
our shores, but we are not satisfied
with the results of their activities,”
the ambassador added. “More than
10 countries are patrolling (Somalia
waters) but we have asked Russia and
she agreed to our request.”
Even as he spoke, the Russian
Navy confirmed that the frigate
Neustrashimy was heading for Somali
waters.
The Neutrashimy is said to be a
multifunctional vessel capable of antisub, antiship and antiaircraft support.
It carries the Vodopad-NK missile and
torpedo system and displaces more
than 4,000 tonnes. Its navigation
range is about 3,000 miles.
“Russia will continue to send
its ships to risky areas in order to
protect Russian citizens and to ensure
safe navigation,” said one Russian
official.
That sounds like the justification
Russia used back in August when it
decided to invade Georgia. With that
in mind, don’t breathe any sighs of
relief just yet. Do we really want the
Russians in control of a shipping
lane that sees so much of the world’s
oil? ✦

Sedimentary basins in the US appear
to contain a volume of technically recoverable unconventional gas that is 10
times the ultimately recoverable volume
of conventional gas.
All resources are logarithmically distributed in nature, and the lower quality
deposits need more expenditures and
better technology to develop economically, Stephen A. Holditch of Texas A&M
University told the opening session of
Oil & Gas Journal’s Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition
in Fort Worth Sept. 30.
Results of the studies of eight US
basins are being configured into software that can be used as advisory points
as operators begin to drill, complete,
stimulate, and produce shale, tight
sands, and coalbed gas reservoirs outside North America, where almost all of
this type of drilling has occurred so far,
Holditch said.
Based on the findings, which imply
that vast quantities of gas can be produced in the world’s basins, even Saudi
Arabia’s state oil company Saudi Aramco
has started a tight gas sands research
group, Holditch said. Holditch and
a large group of his students plan to

release more details of the still incomplete findings at a Society of Petroleum
Engineers conference in Pittsburgh in
mid-October.
C. Michael Ming, president, Research
Partnership to Secure Energy for America (RPSEA), noted the importance of
basic research into unconventional gas
recovery technology. Partly due to such
research, which is under constant threat
of reduced federal and other funding,
the US has more gas reserves today
than when former US President Jimmy
Carter made his “moral equivalent of
war” (meow) speech in the midst of
the late 1970s energy crisis, Ming told
the conference.

World gas study
Holditch’s students, who compared
conventional and unconventional gas
statistics from eight US basins, plan to
expand the study to 25 basins.
The information covered petroleum
systems descriptions and other public data on the San Juan, Green River,
Powder River, Uinta-Piceance, Black
Warrior, Wind River, and Illinois basins.
Data came from the National Petroleum Council, US Geological Survey,
Energy Information Administration,
Gas Research-Gas Technology Institute,
Potential Gas Committee, and other
sources.
When looking at a given target basin
or formation anywhere in the world,
we can find the analogous basin or
formation in the US and glean from
published case histories that abound in
the literature what amount to the best
practices for recovery of unconventional
gas, Holditch said.
The system, still a work in progress,
is advisory in nature and not an expert
system, he cautioned. Unconventional
oil reservoirs have not yet been considered.
Part of the current study, for example, lists US basins and ranks world
basins by most analogous, second most
analogous, and so on. The software
would eventually help operating companies, service companies, and others to
select a tight gas sand fracturing fluid,

Democrats remove OCS leasing
bans from continuing resolution
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Faced with the prospect of a presidential veto of a continuing resolution,
congressional Democrats deleted language dealing with US Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas leasing restrictions
on Sept. 23.
House Budget Committee Chairman
David R. Obey (D-Wis.) “negotiated
the best package he could get with the
White House to take a budget standoff off the table so we can address the
larger Bush financial crisis,” said a
spokesman for House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.).
“The White House made it clear any
new drilling provision was a nonstarter.
The future resolution of offshore drilling will have to be addressed with a
new president,” the spokesman said.
The decision meant that existing
moratoriums expired Sept. 30, but leasing will not begin immediately in those
areas. The US Minerals Management
Service, which has jurisdiction over
federal offshore acreage, continues to

operate under a 5-year plan that began
in mid-2007, a spokesman said on Sept.
24.
The only acreage in that plan that
was covered by a moratorium was off
Virginia, where a sale is tentatively
scheduled for 2011, he told OGJ.
He noted that MMS has received
more than 160,000 comments after
US Interior Sec. Dirk A. Kempthorne
launched preparation of a new OCS
plan that would cover the 2010-15
period. “We’re currently evaluating
and reviewing those comments. It’s
too early to say which areas will be
considered, but we are looking at areas
that were under moratorium. We’re not
scheduled to finish planning for the
program until mid-2010,” the MMS
spokesman said.
There also were indications that
a 1-year moratorium on developing
leasing regulations for federal oil shale
resources in three western states would
not continue. The US Bureau of Land
Management hopes to finalize such
regulations by yearend, a spokesman for
that agency said on Sept. 24.

Uniﬁed insistence
Congressional Republicans immediately claimed a victory. “The news that
Democrats have finally recognized the
significance of this energy crisis and
will allow the moratorium on deep sea
and oil shale production to expire is
welcomed by the millions of American
families, farmers, and small businesses
struggling to make ends meet because
of their soaring energy bills. But more
importantly, it is a victory born directly
from their unified insistence that Congress put America on a path of energy
independence,” House Minority Whip
Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said.
“While details remain unclear, I
hope the Democrats do not use this as
an opportunity for another ruse that
would put vast energy reserves under
lock and key. While the expiration of

this ban is critically important, we must
do more to invest in alternative and
renewable energy sources that will fuel
our economy in the future,” he continued.
“The Democrats’ capitulation is a
victory for middle-class Americans
who have suffered under the crushing
burden of high [gasoline] prices. After
a long summer of $4[/gal] gas, with
winter home heating bills on the way,
this good news could not have come
too soon,” added House Republican
Conference Chairman Adam Putnam
(Fla.).
Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-NM), ranking minority member of the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, said on
Sept. 24 that few gave his May 1 bill to
lift offshore and oil shale leasing bans

much chance of passing. “Now, not
even 5 months later, Democrats have
done a 180° turn on this issue. As the
price of gasoline rose, the American
people became outraged that Democrats
have blocked us from producing offshore and from developing oil shale for
many years. The American people spoke,
and joined Republicans in Congress
with a unified message: find more oil,
use less,” he said.
It will be up to the next president
and Congress to determine whether
these resources should be taken off the
table again, he continued. “With these
bans no longer in place, work can begin
to allow us to tap into our abundant oil
and gas resources—if our leaders don’t
lock them back up next year. Americans
will be watching closely,” Domenici
said. ✦

offshore deep wells are all relatively
near the shoreline of Egypt and Israel.
As onshore in the Egyptian Western
Desert and northern Sinai Peninsula and
the Israeli coastal plain, these preacquisition offshore deep wells commonly
targeted large inversion structures (Petroleum System A: “Syrian Arc” folds)
that were “squeezed up” from paleolows during strong, abrupt transpressional episodic pulses during the Late
Cretaceous-Eocene period (Fig. 4). The
stratigraphic section penetrated in these
offshore “Syrian Arc” wells consists of
a thick Mesozoic section under a thin
Pre-Messinian Tertiary section. Middle
Jurassic limestone or Early Cretaceous
sandstones reservoirs in these offshore
“Syrian Arc” wells frequently exhibit oil
and gas shows or tested oil generated
from mature Middle Jurassic and Early
Cretaceous source rocks.
With the exception of one well (the
Total Mango-1 well drilled in 1985
off the Sinai Peninsula), all other preseismic acquisition, deep offshore wells
are separated from the distal portion of
the EMB by extreme structural (prominent structural ridge offshore Israel)
or stratigraphic (deep incised valley/
submarine canyon complexes offshore
western Egypt) obstructions and, thus,
these deep wells do not provide reliable
extrapolation with confidence of well
ties along seismic lines to the distal portion of the EMB.
Previous attempts to extrapolate
horizons along seismic lines tied to
formation tops encountered in these
proximal deep offshore wells to the
distal portion of the EMB have been
greatly influenced by these structural or
stratigraphic obstructions. The prevailing interpretational paradigm has been
to “drop down” along normal faults
on the distal side of these obstructions.
This “drop-down” interpretation has
resulted in prevailing perspective that
the distal portion of the EMB is widely
interpreted to be dominated by a very
thick Oligo-Miocene section (2-3 sec
(TWT) thick) overlying a thin, deeply
buried Mesozoic section (Fig. 5a).
Burial histories constructed on

pseudowells utilizing the thick OligoMiocene section over a thin, deeply

• Known onshore/proximally offshore Early Cretaceous/Middle Jurassic

buried, and overmature to provide hydrocarbons to the overlying sections.
• The Paleogene/Neogene section is
thermally immature and only capable

(if source rock potential exists) of generating biogenic gas into the available

Due to the above interpretational

Operators have rushed
to add acreage, expand
leaseholds, and submit
applications to drill the
Marcellus shale. This
Drilling
middle-Devonian-age
black organic shale underlies New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Virginia, and Maryland (Fig. 1).
Devonian shales in the Appalachians
are the oldest gas play in the US.
In 2007, 18% of all US wells were
spud in Appalachia—3,134 gas wells.
Much of the drilling activity in Appalachia crosses multiple pay zones and
types, including coalbed methane.
Shales are one-stop hydrocarbon
shops, consisting of source, seal, trap,
and reservoir. Shales have low permeability but shale gas wells generally have
low decline rates, 2-3%/year, and long
producing lives.
The Marcellus shale has been a
known gas reservoir for 75 years but
has only recently become newsworthy
because the industry has new technol-

ogy and new price incentives that make
this regional gas play economic.1
According to the US Department of
Energy, land drilling produces 72% of
natural gas produced in the US, with
only 13% coming from offshore US
wells and about 15% from net imports.
Gas prices have been on a sustained
high, averaging more than $7/Mcf
for the past 3 years. In the last few
months, prices have peaked at $13-14/
Mcf. Despite recent softening, analysts
believe gas prices will remain strong.
NYMEX pricing suggests $8.40-9/Mcf
for fourth-quarter 2008 and all 2009,
which will spur drilling.

Natural gas drilling
Since 2002, US land drilling activity has increased along with gas prices,
with about 1,900 rigs working in the
US in August 2008, up from about 700
rigs in mid-2002.
Drilling companies have consolidated. Based on 2007 results, The Land
Rig Newsletter noted that the five larg-

site, Seneca operates about 2,500 wells
in western New York and northwestern
Pennsylvania, and owns about 720,000
acres of fee minerals, 270,000 acres of
leased minerals, and 100,000 acres of
surface and timber rights throughout
the region.
During the 6 months ending Mar.
31, 2008, Seneca spudded 6 exploratory wells and 75 development wells.
During the same period, it completed
5 exploratory wells and plugged 1, and
completed 103 development wells.
Seneca Resources formed a joint
venture with EOG Resources in 2007 to
develop the Marcellus shale and the JV
planned to drill 18 wells in 2008.
In 2007, Patterson-UTI moved three
rigs to drill the Marcellus in Pennsylvania. By the end of 2009, Doug Wall
said the company will have a fleet of
16 fit-for-purpose rigs working in the
Marcellus shale, where they are drilling
horizontal wells.
Chesapeake Appalachia is drilling
actively in Pennsylvania, using rigs
from Yost Drilling, another Chesapeake
Energy subsidiary (Fig. 2).
Earlier this year, Houston-based
Southwestern Energy Production Co.
announced it would “invest $26 million
in various exploration and new ventures
projects, including drilling as many as
three vertical wells targeting the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania” (OGJ, June 2,
2008, p. 43).

Pennsylvania. In July, the company spud
two more Marcellus wells in Bradford
County.
Fort Worth-based Range Resources
Corp. reported on its Marcellus operations on Sept. 1. The company is using
three rigs in its 2008 Marcellus development project in Pennsylvania, and
the 40-well horizontal program “is
progressing with encouraging results.”
Range plans to steadily increase drilling
operations to 8 rigs by yearend 2009.
The company reported in July that
it had drilled more than 100 wells in
the Marcellus, including 20 horizontal
wells, and increased its high-graded
acreage position to 850,000 net acres
out of 1.4 million acres total (OGJ, July
21, 2008, p. 10).
Range is building pipelines and processing plants and continues to acquire
acreage.
In June, Rex Energy Corp., based
in State College, Pa., announced it had
amassed 88,000 gross (57,000 net)
acres in the Marcellus play. The company completed hydraulic fracture stimulation of its second Marcellus vertical
well in western Pennsylvania. James
Watson is vice-president of drilling for
Rex Energy’s Appalachian basin region
(OGJ, May 19, 2008, p. 35).

West Virginia
In August 2008, 15 operators were
running 77 rigs in West Virginia.
Chesapeake Appalachia, based in
Charleston, WV, has drilled “two very
nice horizontal Marcellus wells” in that
state, according to CEO McClendon in
a second-quarter conference call. As of

Aug. 1, the wells were producing a total
of 7 MMcfd. McClendon said Chesapeake believes the wells “have a combined EUR of about 11 bcf” equivalent.
Chesapeake is running two rigs in the
state.
Other operators in West Virginia include: Equitable Resources; Atlas America; Fortuna; XTO Energy Inc.; Dominion
E&P; Columbia Gas; Northcoast/EXCO;
PC Exploration; Daugherty Petroleum
Inc.; Vinland energy Operations-Nami
Resources Co. LLC; Samson Resources
Co.; Anadarko Petroleum; Penn Virginia

Corp.

Future drilling?
About 150 rigs are drilling the Marcellus and other shales in Pennsylvania
and West Virginia, according to Weatherford, which expects the number to
increase slightly in 2009
In addition to several companies that
have already drilled hundreds of wells
each, many smaller players are drilling
just a few wells each.
Some service companies have had
local offices for many years. BJ Services
Co.’s district office in Dunbar, WV provides hydraulic fracturing and cementing services to Chesapeake, Equitable

BJ also services the region from a district office in eastern Kentucky.

Unlocking gas
from your reservoir
needs the right touch.

Unconventional wells require unconventional solutions.
The easy formations have been drilled. Natural gas from unconventional sources is the new reality for operators in
N. America today. BJ Services Company has earned a reputation of successfully exploiting shale gas and CBM reserves,
and delivering best-in-class hydraulic fracturing services and innovative products like low- and no-polymer frac fluids
and GasFlo™ surfactant for optimized frac fluid recovery in gas wells. BJ’s LiteProp™ ultra-lightweight proppants
can be placed with slick water or BJ’s Liquid LiteProp™ proppant, and the StimPlus™ service protects against
long-term production problems. The DirectStim™ service offers precise placement of stimulation fluid throughout
a horizontal wellbore, increasing stimulation coverage and reserve access. For unconventional gas, BJ Services has
what it takes to help your development strategy succeed.

recovery concurrent with CO2 storage
in the reservoir.
SWP also has started Phase 3 of
the project that involves injecting CO2
into saline water zones in the Farnham
dome in Utah. It plans to drill the injection well toward yearend 2008.
SWP is one of seven regional partnerships organized by DOE in 2003 to
validate and demonstrate the feasibility of CO2 sequestration underground.
New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology leads the companies and
organization involved in SWP.
Reid Grigg, senior engineer for New
Mexico Petroleum Recovery Research
Center at the New Mexico Tech, Socorro, said the total cost of the three
phases will be about $130 million of
which DOE will provide $90 million.
The remaining $40 million comes from
industry, state governments, and other
sources.
Grigg estimated the cost of each
phase as:
• Phase 1—$10 million. The phase
involved characterization of the sequestration potential of the region that
includes Colorado, Oklahoma, New
Mexico, Utah, and parts of Arizona,
Kansas, and Wyoming (Fig. 1). Phase 1
started in 2003 and finished in 2005.
• Phase 2—$20 million. The phase has
the four parts mentioned previous. It
started in 2005 and goes through 2009.
• Phase 3—$90 million. For this saline
aquifer injection phase, DOE will provide $65 million while other sources
will provide $35 million. The phase
started in 2008 and will continue at
least through 2017.

Aneth
Injection in the deep saline sequestration test at Aneth oil field near Bluff
Utah started in November 2005 and
will conclude in 2009.
Resolute Natural Recourses Co. and
Navajo Nation Oil and Gas Co. operate
the field.
SWP’s plan is to inject about
150,000 tons of CO2 during 3.5 years
and to conduct extensive monitoring,
measurement, and verification (MMV)

Halliburton in 2008 acquired Protech Centerform, Protech has a license
to manufacture the material from ENI

patent for the material.
Halliburton notes that the first commercial application of the centralizers
was on 16-in. and 133⁄8-in. casing for
Eni SPA in the Cascina Cardana 1 gas
well in the Po Valley of Italy in 2000,
and the most common application of
the material is for centralizing casing
and liners in highly deviated or sidetrack wells.

Carbon-ﬁber centralizers

expand versatility while reducing overall project cost from design through
completion. For example, the design
engineer can now use slim-hole centralization without stop collar rings around
the outside of the casing wall, providing a smooth and uninterrupted flow
during circulation.
Because the elasticity of the composite is higher than for steel casing,
the material reduces if not completely

It adds that an economic advantage is
that the material allows adequate casing

The company says that it has standardized the material for the centralizers but also can customize it. It can
bond the material to pipe in various
geometries or shapes such as spiral
blades, staggered blades, or buttons; and

it commonly applies it to tubulars at the
pipe yard, although it can also do this at
the rig site.
The most common applications are
solid standoffs, although using the
material in conjunction with close
tolerance bow springs provides a
technically and commercially sound
alternative in underreamed holes, the
company notes. It adds that in the US,
90% of the applications have been on

The standardized material has a 350°

Figs. 1-4 show the centralizers on
various tubulars.

Centralizer compositions
The material for the composite centralizers consists of a combination of a
bicomponent amine-cured epoxy resin
compounded with a polyurethane hybrid (for flexibility), AL203 (Alumina),
SiC (silicon carbide), TiN (titanium nitride) particulate, and chopped carbon

These data show that the new catalyst
performance meets and even exceeds
vendor projections. Gasoline yields during this period were 56.6 wt % to 59.3
wt %.
The variation in gasoline yields is
due to different blends of local and
imported VGO feeds. Imported VGO
slightly reduces the gasoline yields.
Yields using the new catalyst are higher

than the original catalyst’s yield, which
was less than 57.8 wt %.
The new catalyst provides a higher
RON (91) compared with the vendor
projection (90.4). The new catalyst improved gasoline quality compared with
the original catalyst RON of 90.
Actual measured sulfur content of
0.14 vol % is much lower than the

vendor projection of 0.263 vol % and
original catalyst performance of 0.3 vol
%.

Economic beneﬁts
The four catalysts showed different projections and, based on Saudi
Aramco’s selection criteria, we selected
the catalyst that satisfied most of the
refinery criteria. The selected catalyst,
therefore, might not be the best choice
for another refinery with different target product.
This article shows that many factors
influence gasoline yield, including riser
outlet temperature, feedstock quality,
and catalyst formulation.
Based on an economic comparison
and technical evaluation during the initial catalyst testing phase, we anticipated
that the selected catalyst would meet the
refinery’s objectives of the highest yield
and octane number for the gasoline
stream. Actual performance confirmed
the conclusion that we reached during
the study phase.

Depth-WT ratio

Acting on the observation that Equation 1 tended to give less and less accurate predictions as the level of Charpy
energy of the material decreased, Maxey
postulated Charpy upper-shelf energy
should be proportional to the ductile
fracture resistance of a material with
suboptimal toughness. He showed
the Charpy energy of a carbon steel
pipe material to be roughly equal to
the strain energy release rate of crack
formation, G, which Irwin had shown
to equal KIc2/E, where KIc is the plane
strain fracture toughness and E is the
elastic modulus of the material.
Maxey further postulated Equation
1 could be corrected for materials that
failed in a ductile manner but which
exhibited suboptimal toughness by
means of the Dugdale model.2 The
Dugdale model embodies a Ln-Secant
functional representation of crack-tip
opening displacement for a material
exhibiting plastic strain at the tips of
flaws before fracturing. Combining the
concepts of Charpy energy, the Dugdale
model, and Equation 1 yielded two failure criteria, one for through-wall flaws
(Equations 2-3) and one for surface
flaws (Equations 4-5).
Equation 6 shows σfs, the predicted
hoop stress at failure for a surface flaw.
Maxey’s review of full-scale test data
showed the most appropriate value
of flow stress for line pipe material as
described by Equation 7.
He also suggested a three-term
Folias factor (Equation 3) be used as
it is less conservative than the original
Folias factor. Equations 2 and 4 became
known as the Ln-Sec equations and
are often also referred to as the NG-18
Surface Flaw equations.3
Validation for line pipe materials
involved burst tests of 35 end-capped
pipes containing longitudinally oriented uniform-depth V-shaped notches of
various lengths and depth-to-thickness
ratios.
The 35 materials’ exhibited 2⁄3-size
Charpy upper-shelf energy levels ranging from 10 ft-lb to 34 ft-lb (full-size

One experiment, with a notch-

depth-to-WT ratio of 0.25, deserves
particular attention due to its implications regarding use of the original LnSec Equation with shallow defects. This
was the only experiment in which the
notch had such a low depth-WT ratio.
The other experiments involved notches

Regression fitting the data including
this result yields an R2 value of 0.92.
Excluding the one shallow-flaw experiment, however, changes the R2 to 0.96,
suggesting the original Ln-Sec Equation
tends to give excessively conservative
predictions for failure stress of shallow
flaws.
The lack of additional shallow-flaw
results and early use of this equation
for predicting failure pressure led this
deficiency to be regarded as unimportant. Because of little interest in shallow
flaws not posing an imminent threat
to the integrity of a pipeline at normal
operating stresses, the inaccuracy of the
model for shallow flaws was not viewed
as a detriment, nor did much incentive
exist to perform expensive burst tests of
pipe samples with shallow flaws.

nonzero defect length even though the
defect depth is zero. The lack of perceived threat from such deficiencies has
allowed it to be largely ignored, despite
general recognition of the original
equation’s limitations. Fig. 1 shows a
good fit for experiments with depth-tothickness ratios of 0.38 or more; defects
that would pose a potential threat to
the integrity of a pipeline at operating
stress levels.
The original Ln-Sec equation gives
conservative estimations of failure pressure, but its use with materials having
suboptimal toughness can result in underestimation of the depths of defects that
could survive such pressure, potentially
leading to overestimation of remaining
life in a remaining-life assessment.
Fig. 3 shows such a circumstance,
suggesting an 11-in. long flaw with
essentially zero depth would barely survive a hydrostatic test to 100% of SMYS
and yielding the absurd conclusion that
a test to 100% of SMYS ensures the pipe
is free of defects longer than 11 in. In
reality, however, the incorrectness of the
shallow-flaw curves prevents use of the

New cable withstands downhole temperature to 300° C.
This new high performance SureSight
fiber optic distributed temperature cable
withstands extreme heat and operates in
high temperature wellbore monitoring.
Cables withstand temperatures as high
as 300º C., which are often experienced
in steam assisted gravity drainage and
cyclic steam injection wells in steamflood
reservoirs. Cables have been designed and
optimized with double ended measurement capabilities.

The company says that cable construction provides a number of benefits over
the use of standard fiber optic technology.
While multiple layers provide a pressure
barrier to prevent damaging hydrogen ingress, the latest generation of optical fibers
helps minimize the effects of hydrogen
darkening with chemical composition and
coatings.
The cable design means the integrity of
the distributed temperature sensing system
can be monitored during installation and
information sourced on stimulant-frac
fluid placement.

Federal rules don’t
align with private
sector’s courtesies
The inspector general’s report that’s
knocking over desks at the US Minerals
Management Service recalls for this writer
an encounter years ago with a petroleum
engineer employed by the Department of
Energy.
In a hotel grill between the end of a
conference and ﬂights home, an Oil & Gas
Journal colleague and I saw the engineer,
whom we both knew, and invited him to

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

join us for lunch. He did.
When I reached for the check, the engineer insisted on paying for his hamburger
and coffee. Rules, he explained.
The lesson: Federal rules don’t always
align with the private sector’s standard
courtesies.
Oil company employees need to remember that.
The report of Department of the Interior
Inspector General Earl E. Devaney is devastating on many fronts (OGJ Online, Sept. 12
and Sept. 18, 2008). One former MMS employee already has pled guilty to a criminal
charge. Other employees named in Devaney’s report must be having night sweats.
The oil industry, meanwhile, looks complicit in corruption.
“The whole sordid affair shows how
much sway Big Oil holds over the government,” said Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) while introducing legislation specifying how government ofﬁcials should behave with the oil
and gas business.
In fact, Devaney’s report reads differently from Nelson’s interpretation. It details
many instances in which four companies—
Chevron, Shell, Hess, and Gary Williams
Energy Co.—treated ofﬁcials of the MMS
Royalty-in-Kind (RIK) Program as they
would private business associates.
The IG report says company representatives bought the RIK ofﬁcials occasional
meals and drinks and included them in appreciation dinners and golf, ski, and paintball outings. As business behavior, none of
that sounds illicit. But the RIK ofﬁcials don’t
work for business.
The government says federal employees
shouldn’t accept gifts worth more than $20
apiece or totaling $50 in any given year.
Apparently, the company and RIK ofﬁcials
targeted in Devaney’s report thought those
rules didn’t apply or chose to ignore them.
And the oil industry has a political
problem likely to cost much more than the
few thousand dollars four companies spent
showing MMS marketers that they appreciated their business.

Record spike in crude price
On its last day of trade Sept. 22, the October contract for benchmark US light,
sweet crudes shot up $16.37 to $120.92/bbl in the largest 1-day price jump ever on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, prompting an investigation by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
Stephen J. Obie, acting director of CFTC’s enforcement division, promised his
staff would “scour” trading activity for that day in search of illegal manipulative
activity. CFTC can compel testimony under oath and subpoena oil market records,
including recent trading. But some traders blamed the spike on an unidentiﬁed large
oil company scrambling to cover its short positions. Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce
of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, “Traders that were short oil were desperately trying to unwind positions or ﬁnd physical oil before the October crude futures
contract expired.”
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, described it as “the largest
squeeze ever” on a front-month contract. “It does raise a few question marks as to
what has really happened to the West Texas Intermediate delivery mechanism,” he
said. Prior to the contract’s expiration, he said, “Open interest was absolutely in line
with previous months, so it was not the case of too large a position going into the
last day of trading.”
He earlier pointed out “abnormal trading patterns” of “a $4.30/bbl rally in the last
10 minutes” of the Sept. 19 NYMEX session and a $14.74/bbl difference between
bottom and top intraday prices Sept. 15-19. “Open interest in WTI futures has been in
a declining trend since last year,” Jakob said. The price spike surpassed the previous 1-day price-gain record of $10.75/bbl on June 6. The highest percentage rise
in price in a single day was 20.9% Jan. 3, 1994. The front-month November crude
contract lost $3.64/bbl over the next two sessions, then regained $2.29 to $108.02/bbl
Sept. 25. It closed at $106.89/bbl Sept. 26 amid uncertainties about the international
economy, the US dollar, and world demand for energy through next year. Despite
strong price ﬂuctuations over that period, the November contract for benchmark
crude ﬁnished the week $4.14/bbl higher than it started.
Bailout package
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
met Sept. 18 with House and Senate leaders to recommend a $700 billion capital
injection to purchase bad mortgage debt from ﬁnancial companies. A favorable vote
was expected that week, but discussions dragged through Sept. 28 before federal ofﬁcials reached a bailout agreement that would allow the US government to purchase
devalued mortgage related assets from ﬁnancial institutions in order to unfreeze the
credit markets.
The initial bailout agreement “seemed to be a done deal until the candidates
[Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.)] invited themselves to
the show,” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland. “The easiest way to
become an overnight leader is to break a deal and then become the savior of it. The
latest political debacle will not help consumer sentiment.”
The agreement went to Congress on Sept. 29 for a vote. But NYMEX oil futures
prices dropped more than 4% in pre-market trade that day as the US dollar gained
against the euro. “The broader market remains skeptical as to whether the package
will be enough to prevent the economic downturn from persisting or even spreading
to other major economies, further pressuring oil prices,” said Raymond James analysts. Critics point out the plan does nothing to improve oil demand. “This plan is a
rescue plan to prevent a collapse of the ﬁnancial system and not a plan to boost the
economy,” Jakob said. “The rescue plan’s impact on the economy will be a lengthy
process and will not immediately put the US driver back on the road.”
Meanwhile, he said, “The Washington soap opera is taking so much of traders’
attention that market liquidity is coming off.” Jakob said, “Open interest continues to
decline to new lows for the year and soon to new lows for 2 years. All the main commodities are in a declining trend of open interest. With so much public outrage on
the Wall Street bailout, we see little chance that the commodity futures market will
be able to escape a regulatory change, and the more commodity prices increase, the
more immediate the risk becomes.”
In another sign of a troubled economy, federal regulators seized Washington Mutual Inc. (WaMu) Sept. 25 in the largest bank failure in US history. The government
then agreed to sell WaMu’s $307 billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits to J.P.
Morgan Chase & Co.

Environmental, staff issues top
HC process industry concerns
he global hydrocarbon processing industries face a
daunting mix of challenges and opportunities in the
years to come.
Chief among those challenges are shortages of
qualiﬁed personnel, mounting pressures to switch to alternative
fuels, and health, safety, and environment (HSE) concerns.
At the same time, proliferating mandates to redesign the
world’s energy supply create many new opportunities as well
as challenges, according to downstream service and supply
company executives interviewed for this report.
Those mandates, coming atop an
already burdensome regulatory regime, could mean some countries’
downstream sectors will emerge
as winners and others as losers.
“Although there has been a lot of investment in the reﬁning industry over
the past 5 years, much of it has been
overseas,” notes Carlos Cabrera, UOP
LLC president and CEO. “Faced with
increased installation costs and lengthy
permitting requirements, many US reCarlos Cabrera
ﬁners are investing in overseas assets
rather than in the US. While this can be attractive with respect
to near-term business returns, it deﬁnitely raises a concern with
respect to security of the future US reﬁning industry.”

T

hike availability and cut operational cost.
Production optimization to increase throughput.
Energy optimization to reduce energy cost.
Use of electrical drives to increase availability and reduce operational cost and energy consumption vs. use
of gas turbines.
• Use of “robotized” solutions for inspections and monitoring in hazardous areas.
• Extended service environments enabling efﬁcient remote support and collaboration from a global network
of suppliers; this drives up response time and reduces
HSE impact with less traveling and site work
Wuttig also sees the stafﬁng pressures creating a new workﬂow paradigm—or rather emulating one in the
upstream oil and gas sector: “The upstream industry has been driving strategic initiatives to prepare for the new
future, and the term ‘integrated operations’ has been adopted globally. The
[upstream] industry is already implementing new technologies along with Hartmut Wuttig
new work processes to enable more
work being done remotely with a smaller workforce. We believe
the downstream sector will follow the same trend.”

Staffing challenges

Documentation

Topping the list of concerns for most downstream companies
is operating and maintaining processing facilities with an aging
workforce and infrastructure.
“The scramble for experienced workers has already started.
Over the next years, many facilities will struggle to attract and
retain the expertise needed to secure a safe and efﬁcient operation,” says Hartmut Wuttig, manager of ABB’s oil, gas, and
petrochemical business unit. “We foresee a need for new technologies and work processes to manage this development. The
service/supply sector will also scramble for expertise, and at
the same time, be challenged with developing and delivering
the requested new technologies.”
According to Wuttig, these new technologies will include
infrastructure technologies, such as wireless communication,
sensors, and cameras; efﬁcient data management such as
data modeling and other means to make information efﬁciently
available locally and remotely; and solutions that use this information to push higher availability and throughput at a lower
operational cost.
Some examples of these enabling solutions Wuttig cites are:
• Performance and equipment condition monitoring to

Quantapoint CEO Eric Hoffman stresses the need for hydrocarbon processing plant operators to maintain accurate,
updated documentation of plant engineering design and
construction data.
“With oil prices at record levels and fuel consumption needs
escalating in the United States and many parts of the world,
the hydrocarbon processing industries are being revamped to
ensure production levels are as high as possible,” he notes.
“Unfortunately, most owners and operators have little or no asbuilt (or ‘existing condition’) documentation on which to base
revamp designs. Further, the as-built documentation that does
exist is typically out-of-date or of questionable integrity.”
Hoffman contends that inaccurate or nonexistent as-built
documentation can cause many issues during revamps, including having more personnel in the plant, increased design
time, clashes between the new piping and existing piping
and equipment, and ﬁeld routing of pipe (contributing to additional inaccurate as-built documentation), to name a few:
“The cost is time and money in the form of ﬁeld changes,
missed schedules, project delays, construction rework, hot
work, and lost production.”

Modularization
Modularization is another solution for an industry pressed to
the limit, according to Dan McCarthy, executive vice-president
of CB&I company Lummus Technology.
“It seems clear that for the foreseeable future we will continue to experience a high demand for engineering services,
material supply, and construction labor,” he says. “CB&I believes that an important solution to this challenge is to modularize designs and fabricate modules in a shop, which improves
quality, simpliﬁes the coordination of ﬁeld activities, minimizes
delays due to inclement weather, and reduces risk because
more work can be done at ground level.”

Synfuels industry impact
If anything, the push to develop alternative fuels as a substitute
for fossil fuels in light of climate change concerns will exacerbate industry’s stafﬁng dilemma, according to John Hemmings,
director of technology and studies, SNC-Lavalin.
“The lack of sufﬁcient, suitably qualiﬁed people to design,
construct, and operate facilities may limit the development of
energy technologies and will hit the
most capital- and manpower-intensive
segments harder than the rest of the
industry,” he contends. “This may delay or even prevent the emergence of
a synthetic fuels industry, since synthetic fuels plants are about four times
the capital intensity of conventional oil
reﬁneries; therefore, if resources are
constrained, there is four times the
‘bang for the buck’ in extending conventional reﬁning assets than in buildJohn Hemmings
ing a new synthetic fuels industry.”
Hemmings thinks this situation may have the effect of focusing
the resources into extension of conventional reﬁneries, which will
in itself drive up energy prices, creating a “space” for synthetic
fuels projects that cannot be ﬁlled due to insufﬁcient resources.
“Also, high energy costs have created an environment that is ripe
for new developers and new companies to pursue large, complex
gasiﬁcation and alternative energy projects,” he adds. “Most of
these entities have little experience with the complexity of the
projects or of the engineering effort required to design these custom facilities. This often leads to termination of their efforts.
“This scenario continues to occur, and SNC-Lavalin has
made several presentations on the turmoil in the capital projects industry and alternatives to obtaining project ﬁnancing in
an effort to advise and inform developers of their options.”
In addition, there is a question as to whether the vehicle
manufacturers will make vehicles to employ such fuels, and the
question of distribution is huge, Hemmings notes.
“So this raises the question whether it is worth spending
the limited R&D dollars developing technologies that make products that will never be needed—and a ‘chicken-or-egg’ situation
between engines and fuels,” he says. “Vehicle manufacturers
| 6 |

won’t make the cleaner and more efﬁcient engines because suitable fuels are not there, and technology suppliers to the fuels
industry are not developing the processes to make the fuels.”
The bottom line for SNC Lavalin is that, “while we feel good
about the future of the synthetic fuels industry, we need to
remain ﬂexible and to be able to deliver projects for our clients
regardless of the technologies involved.”

HSE concerns
The number one HSE concern will be to meet continuously
increasing HSE demands from an aging workforce and infrastructure—but within increasing energy and cost constraints,
Wuttig notes.
“One critical factor will be the ability to balance an efﬁcient
HSE system with trained individuals, at complex, often continuously changing facilities,” he says. “From a technology perspective, a prerequisite to succeed will be availability of up-to-date
information and documentation on the facility and realistic
training facilities to continuously train the personnel on critical
and complex situations.”
Hoffman contends that the inherent safety risks of working at
a plant site increase as a result of inaccurate as-built information.
“The resulting safety concern is having too many personnel
in the facility for too long gathering or verifying as-built information, and the resulting hotwork and rework from inaccurate
information,” he says. “Traditionally, gathering this information
involves team members and/or traditional surveyors visiting the
facility to gather spot measurements manually with tape measures and plumb bobs, which is time-consuming and provides
relatively few measurements. Then there are additional trips to
the plant that are required to gather information for different
disciplines or to verify previous measurements. Finally, during
construction there is usually signiﬁcant ﬁeld routing, hot work,
and rework due to missing as-built information, incorrect designs, fabrication errors, and ﬁt-up or interference problems.”
Reducing environmental hazards and emissions in processes also is a driving factor in downstream HSE regimes, according to McCarthy.
“One technology that still has a signiﬁcant environmental
issue is gasoline alkylation,” he notes. “While alkylate is viewed
as a clean fuel, the commercial processes use liquid acid catalysts. I believe that eventually we will see solid catalysts replace
these liquid catalysts. Lummus Technology is currently partnering with Albermarle in the development of the AlkyClean process, which eliminates corrosive liquid acid use and the associated safety concerns, as well as mitigation/disposal costs.”

Carbon footprint
McCarthy sees the dominant industry focal point on environmental issues as the drive to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, “which we believe will become an increasingly decisive
factor in the choice of upgrading technology and in catalyst and
process development.”
In the short term, CO2 recovery from stack gases remains

a viable option, he points out: “However, new dieselization
and upgrading demands will dramatically increase the need
for hydrogen production. Hydrogen production involves CO2
production as well, but the CO2 can be directly ‘captured’ using commercially proven technology rather than attempting to
recover it from unit stack gases.”
While reducing carbon footprint is becoming a major issue
throughout the energy industry, it is a much bigger issue when
coal and heavy feedstocks are considered, as they are all high in
carbon, Hemmings notes.
“Synthetic fuels processes lend
themselves to carbon capture and
sequestration [CCS]; however, the
necessary legal framework and economic driving forces are not yet in
place,” he says. “SNC-Lavalin has
initiated a CCS forum internally to
ensure it is current with legislation
and technologies that can address
this ever more sensitive area. It is
predicted that most future capital
projects will require some manner of
John E. Lionberger
carbon plan if not also capture. We
are planning to address this issue in an upcoming Gasiﬁcation
Technologies Conference presentation.”
John E. Lionberger, vice-president and general manager, Houston regional ofﬁce of Burns & McDonnell Inc., sees the biggest
technology challenges facing the hydrocarbon processing industry
service and supply sector as those related issues centered on reducing facilities’ carbon footprint, improving energy utilization and
efﬁciency, and utilizing an increasing level of renewable fuels—all
in ways that are sustainable in light of uncertain regulation.
“The example of these challenges in reﬁning would be designing or redesigning hydrotreaters using more active and selective catalysts and utilizing novel process conﬁgurations that

allow reﬁners to reduce operating severity (i.e., reduce energy
consumption) but continue to produce high-quality, environmentally acceptable fuel products.
“In petrochemicals this might mean process innovations
such as metallurgy or coatings for cracking furnace tubes to
extend run lengths.”
In most processing facilities there are energy-saving opportunities that go unrealized because attractive, high-temperature
sources are few and less attractive, low-temperature sources
abundant, Lionberger says.
“The challenge is to provide an integrated, plantwide approach instead of the more typical unit-by-unit analysis and
evaluation to achieve better energy usage and efﬁciency,” he
explains. “A heat recovery scheme in a reﬁnery might involve
collecting low-grade heat from process streams headed for
product storage and transporting it to the boiler house, where
it can be used to heat makeup water and thus reduce a combustion source.”
With regard to renewables, the challenge is to provide economic pathways that allow for continued and even increasing
use, notes Lionberger.
“Responsible care in selecting only nonfood sources as
feedstocks is essential,” he says. “Absent mandates in a market-based economy, this would occur naturally. Service and
supply industry leaders must be dedicated to developing renewable solutions based on nonfood alternatives.”
In the end, it’s critical for hydrocarbon processing industries
to focus on remaining viable regardless of regulation.
“The reﬁning industry service and supply companies know
this well,” Lionberger says. “Regulation will continue to be the
norm, not an exception. Whether it’s lead elimination, sulfur reduction, oxygenate addition, vapor pressure control, benzene
reduction, or renewables content, new and changing regulation
has been a constant. Service providers must be anticipatory,
responsive, and innovative to be successful.” ]

ownstream service and supply companies are pressing hard to develop new technologies that can help
hydrocarbon processing plant operators cope with
an ever-changing mix of feedstocks and products.

Heavy hydrocarbon challenge
Dan McCarthy, executive vice-president, CB&I company
Lummus Technology, believe that the biggest single challenge facing the downstream service/supply sector is the
signiﬁcant ramp-up in demand for heavy hydrocarbon up| 8 |

grading in Canada, South America, the Middle East, and Russia that is placing tremendous pressure on the entire supply
chain, from engineering services and process and catalyst
development to fabrication and construction labor.
“The upgrading of conventional (heavy, sour gas oils and
cracked stocks) and synthetic gas oils derived from sources
such as the Athabasca oil sands, continues to constrain industry resources,” he notes.
Such projects are especially difﬁcult because of their
combination of challenges—large equipment, high conver| Technology Forum | October 6, 2008 |

sion, and difﬁcult and somewhat unfamiliar feedstocks.
“Since most of these projects involve high-pressure hydroprocessing technologies, they compete for the limited
availability of high-pressure equipment in general and largediameter forged reactors in particular,” says McCarthy. “Additionally, major bottlenecks exist in high-pressure alloy piping and valving supply. These constraints generate very long
lead times that put tremendous strain on project schedules
and construction costs and also result in broad price swings
in metal and fabrication costs, which can compromise the
accuracy of project cost estimates.”
In the area of heavy oil production, UOP has introduced
Catalytic Crude Upgrading (CCU) technology, notes Carlos
Cabrera, UOP LLC president and CEO.
“With escalating crude prices,
heavy ﬁelds that have historically
been too costly to pursue are now
worth developing. Many of these
crudes are too viscous to meet
pipeline speciﬁcations and need to
be upgraded near the source,” he
says. “CCU is an extension of FCCbased technology to the oil ﬁeld and
is designed to generate its own diluent to improve the ﬂow properties
of stranded crudes to meet pipeline
Dan McCarthy
speciﬁcations. In addition to enabling stranded crude reserves, CCU is essentially a power
plant as well, which is capable of supplying all of the fuel
gas, steam, and electrical power generation to operate the
entire ﬁeld installation.”

such as allowing additional amounts of low-quality diesel to
be blended into the pool,” he says.
Ethanol blending continues to have an uncertain impact
for North American reﬁners, according to Cabrera: “These
[ethanol mandate] regulations will create issues that can
best be solved by solutions that look across the entire naphtha complex, not just by modifying operations of a single
process unit.
One potentially serious complication that ethanol blending can create is increased Reid vapor pressure (RVP), Cabrera points out.
“Adding ethanol to meet the oxygenate speciﬁcation of the
gasoline pool raises the vapor pressure of the gasoline. With
2 vol % ethanol in the blend, the RVP increases by approximately 1 psi. RVP rises slightly with further increases in ethanol until it declines above 20%. Because of the RVP increase
with ethanol blending of 2–10%, reﬁners are forced to lower
vapor pressure speciﬁcations for the other gasoline blending
components. The immediate solution is to reduce the amount
of high-vapor-pressure hydrocarbons going into the gasoline
pool. However, this simple solution can cause the unintended
consequence of actually reducing the volume of the available
gasoline pool by excluding high-octane iso-parafﬁns.”
Another challenge facing reﬁners in North America is
compliance with new gasoline benzene limits.
“While many reﬁneries are well under way with selecting
or implementing solutions, many other reﬁners are now just
starting their evaluation and selection process,” says Cabrera. “The best answer is reﬁnery- or reﬁnery system-speciﬁc
and needs to be evaluated on that basis.”

FCC
Vehicle fuels
Another technology challenge that McCarthy sees on the horizon is the dieselization of light-duty vehicles.
“This is well under way in Europe, and I believe the US
may be on the verge of a similar transition, given the high
price of motor fuel and the imminent introduction of a range
of modern diesel-powered automobiles,” he says.
McCarthy contends this trend would have a profound
change on reﬁnery operations. “There will be a need to install a large number of new hydrocrackers and to address
the reduced gasoline demands on current FCC capacity,” he
notes. “Concurrent with the increase in hydrocracking capacity, there will be a need to install new hydrogen plants.
It will be interesting to see if carbon sequestration will be
included in these new plants.”
Technologies that produce complete fuels that are fully
compatible with the reﬁning infrastructure offer many advantages to reﬁners, consumers, and the auto industry, contends Cabrera.
“Processes such as UOP/Eni Ecoﬁning that produce a
diesel fuel that meets all current diesel specs and even exceeds the specs for cetane create opportunities for reﬁners,
| October 6, 2008 | Technology Forum |

With high crude oil prices and with the high price differentials between light and heavy feeds, the proﬁtability of FCC
units can be signiﬁcantly improved by processing lower-value residue feedstocks, points out Harvey McQuiston, Shaw
Group FCC program manager.
“The Shaw/Axens FCC Alliance has seen tremendous
growth with the licensing of 12 grassroots FCC units in just
the last 2 years,” he says. “Also, for existing FCC units, there
has been increased interest in processing more resid. To
maximize the proﬁtability of an FCC processing resid, FCC
hardware becomes even more important.”
The feed injection system is the heart of the FCC reaction
system and is responsible for rapid vaporization of the heavy
feed and even distribution across the riser, notes McQuiston.
“These two functions are critical for maximizing gasoline yield while minimizing coke and dry gas production,”
he says. “The feed injection system becomes even more
important when processing resid in the feed. A feed injection upgrade is relatively inexpensive, with typical payouts
of less than 6 months.”
Another key part of the FCC reaction system is the riser
termination device (RTD), whose chief function is to quickly

separate the hydrocarbon products from the catalyst and direct the hydrocarbon products to the main fractionator, minimizing the exposure time of the vapors to high temperature.
“An advanced RTD reduces thermal cracking of valuable
products, such as gasoline, to less valuable products, such
as dry gas,” McQuiston says.
Finally, stripper performance in the reaction system is important because it ensures that valuable products are not
burned in the regenerator, and good stripping minimizes regenerator air usage, he adds: “This also minimizes regenerator temperature increases when
processing resid material. The use
of stripper packing technology has
become very common to achieve
good contacting between the catalyst and steam used for stripping.”
On the regenerator side, additional carbon is typically deposited
on the catalyst with resid processing, McQuiston notes.
“This increases the importance
of uniform distribution of the spent
Harvey McQuiston
catalyst, from the stripper, across
the regenerator bed,” he says. “A spent catalyst distributor
is used to achieve this. Uniform air distribution is also important to minimize carbon monoxide after burning in the dilute
phase of the regenerator.”
For an FCC unit, the need to maximize light cycle oil (LCO)
for diesel production is quickly becoming a critical issue, according to Shawn A. Abrams, vice-president and general
manager, Grace Davison reﬁning technologies.
Grace Davison introduced the MIDAS series of catalysts
in 2005, and the technology has been expanded to include
the new FCC additive for LCO maximization, SABRE-300.
“In a commercial FCCU, at constant conditions, 1.5 lv%
of slurry was shifted to LCO,” Abrams notes. “SABRE-300,
by converting coke precursors into liquid product, actually
decreased regenerator temperatures and equilibrium catalyst coke factor.
“Using current spot economics, the addition of 10% SABRE-300 improved proﬁtability by $1.14/bbl. Further increases in yield can be attained through a detailed unit severity
optimization.”
There will be a continued movement in the FCC area over
the next 10 years to be more fully integrated with aromatics
and petrochemicals production, claims Cabrera.
“FCC technology has seen a resurgence in technical innovation, as the focus has shifted from fuels-oriented distillation cut points to truly managing hydrocarbon species to
maximize product value upgrade,” he says. “Consistent with
this market shift, UOP’s ﬁrst PetroFCC was commissioned
earlier this year. As clients continue to drive for higher propylene production, UOP has continued to develop technology solutions to meet that need.”

Hydrogen processes
The reﬁnery-wide need for hydrogen continues to be a challenge for reﬁners worldwide, says Cabrera.
“Naphtha reformers will continue to play an important part in
the reﬁnery hydrogen balance. High-yield reforming processes and
catalysts will continue to play a part in meeting this challenge.
“UOP’s R-264 catalyst increases throughput and yield
from a CCR Platformer. In addition, unique revamp options
offer lower-cost, quicker-to-implement solutions. In a recent
job, UOP was able to revamp an existing unit to increase
the throughput of a CCR Platformer by 35%, eliminating the
need for adding a reformer.”
Cabrera contends that key solutions still needed by industry include new higher-activity catalysts with improved hydrogen utilization for distillate and vacuum gas oil hydrotreating to meet ever-tightening fuel quality speciﬁcations.
Robert H. Bullard, Grace Davison vice-president and managing director, advanced reﬁning technologies, notes, “Our latestgeneration catalyst for the SmART Catalyst System Series, ART
420 DX, has demonstrated excellent performance in industry lab
testing. ART 420 DX has been qualiﬁed by a number of reﬁners
for its ability to treat difﬁcult feed blends in demanding ultralowsulfur diesel (ULSD) applications. A major oil company’s testing
labs found ART 420 DX to be a ‘top-tier ULSD catalyst.’”
Gordon Low, manager for Haldor Topsoe USA, points to reﬁners’ desires to match hydrotreating and hydrocracking unit
cycle lengths to match longer reﬁnery turnaround cycles.
“To do this requires use of catalyst systems with the highest activity and stability,” he says. “Management of pressure
drop buildup in the catalyst beds can be achieved using a
graded catalyst system with high void fraction and low activity at the top of the ﬁrst bed, followed by catalysts with
decreasing void fraction and increasing activity. Some units
are installing bypassable reactors with the capability to take
reactors off line for midcycle catalyst change-out.”
Reﬁners can also consider a revamp of the unit, which
may include the addition of more catalyst volume to meet
the required cycle length, he adds.
Feedstock quality is another issue challenging hydroprocessing licensors and catalyst suppliers, says Low: “Reﬁners are using more synthetic crude from Canada, light cycle oil and light
coker gas oil need to be upgraded to ULSD, and reﬁners want
to process heavier feeds with poorer cold ﬂow properties.
“Topsoe’s TK-576BRIM CoMo ULSD catalyst extends the
operating window to allow deep desulfurization of distillates
and gas oils at low to moderate unit pressures.”
Topsoe has focused its catalyst and process developments to produce ULSD from difﬁcult feeds with optimal
hydrogen usage, according to Low.
“A ULSD unit designed to minimize hydrogen consumption
while meeting the product quality objectives will have lower
capital cost and operating expenses than an ULSD unit designed with hydrogen give-away in the product,” he says. “It
is also important to look ahead and design ULSD units with a

deﬁned process scheme for future revamps to produce higher
cetane and lower aromatics diesel if regulations change.”

Coking
The main cutting-edge developments in coking today are
alternatives to traditional coking technology for conversion
of asphaltenes to lighter, more valuable products, points
out Cabrera.
“The emergence of new hydroprocessing technologies
using slurry nano-sized catalysts will prove to be the residual
oil conversion technology of choice for many feedstocks in
the future,” he says. “UOP’s SRC-Uniﬂex is a proven slurry
hydrocracking technology that achieves >90% conversion of
resid at only 2,000 psig.”

Alkylation
While alkylate is a highly desirable component for gasoline
blending, permits for hydroﬂuoric acid or sulfuric acid alkylation units are becoming increasingly difﬁcult to obtain.
“Solid catalyst alkylation technologies have been developed, but none have been commercialized due to marginal
economics,” notes Cabrera. “UOP is currently updating its
Alkylene process for economics at, or superior to, sulfuric
acid alkylation. The updated Alkylene process utilizes a highactivity, water-tolerant, low-Pt catalyst for capex and opex
competitive with sulfuric acid alkylation.”

Isomerization
Optimization of the isomerization unit must take into consideration the reforming unit as well, according to Cabrera.
“The naphtha complex as a whole should be optimized to
achieve the objectives of the gasoline pool,” he says. “Optimizing
the naphtha complex in response to ethanol blending requires
advanced technology in both the reforming and isom units.
“For example, the added octane from ethanol blending
will allow a decrease in the reformer severity, but reduced
reformer severity alone will still require elimination of light
parafﬁns from the gasoline pool to maintain RVP. Further
reduction in reformer severity with a corresponding use of
light naphtha isomerization will allow the required ethanol
and octane [levels] to be met, and the decreased RVP of
the reformate will accommodate the RVP of the ethanol and
isomerate as well. In addition, the reduced-severity reformer
operation results in much longer cycle lengths.”

Catalysts
For reﬁners, rapidly changing reﬁnery margins and market
drivers have increased their need for ﬂexibility in their reﬁning operations.
“To meet their needs, UOP has added capabilities to the

workhorse of most reﬁneries, the UOP CCR Platforming
process,” Cabrera says. “Improved regeneration capabilities
such as the new CycleMax regenerator increase the ability
to burn the greater coke generated in processing heavier
crudes at increased operational severities, allowing reﬁners
to maximize their proﬁts.
“To add to this ﬂexibility, a new generation of CCR catalysts, the R-200 series, has been developed that can be operated at higher feed throughputs for maximum aromatics
or gasoline production, or alternatively at higher selectivity
when proﬁts are best realized by obtaining the highest yields
with limited available naphthas.”
The ability to design, build, and characterize catalysts at
the atomic level is leading to new levels of performance,
Cabrera contends.
“Catalyst breakthroughs lead to increased throughput,
improved fuel quality, and longer cycles that mean better
utilization of reﬁning assets and capital avoidance,” he says.
“In addition, new materials are hitting the market with more
robust operating characteristics, such as UOP’s PI-242 and
PI-244, which give very high naphtha isomerization activity,
octane, and stability without the contaminant sensitivity and
environmental issues of chlorided alumina.”
The invention of new catalytic materials has accelerated
due to improved testing (i.e., combinatorial chemistry), characterization, and modeling tools, the UOP CEO says: “Nanozeolites and novel metal functions are increasing catalyst activity, minimizing unwanted byproducts and enabling longer
cycle lengths.

Petrochemicals
On the petrochemicals front, the oleﬁns industry is struggling with the ethylene/propylene supply balance, McCarthy
points out.
“Propylene has traditionally been produced as a byproduct of steam crackers and FCC units,” he says. “However,
with gas feeds being used in new and existing crackers and
with FCC units having a lower proﬁle in modern reﬁneries, it
has become necessary to focus on new propylene production technologies.”
Lummus offers two commercial routes: Its Oleﬁns Conversion Technology reacts byproduct butenes from oleﬁns
plants or reﬁneries with ethylene to produce propylene at
high yield.
“These plants operate at moderate temperatures and
pressures in a near isothermal environment, so investment
is low,” McCarthy says.
The second route is propane dehydrogenation via the
Catoﬁn process, he adds: “We recently were awarded a
650,000 tonne/year [project]—the world’s largest to date.” ]

Giving back its own career reward

D

ear Reader,
Have you considered undertaking volunteer work for a deserving charitable organization?
Putting altruistic and “feel-good” motives aside, have you then wondered whether volunteer work would
yield tangible career benefits for you, considering the investment of time and effort often involved?
Wonder no more. Apart from its providing great opportunities for networking and ways to hone
underutilized skills, there is empirical evidence to show that volunteering enhances one’s career profile.
A 2005 survey of 200 top UK firms done for recruiting firm Reed Executive showed that:
• 73% of employers would recruit a candidate with volunteering experience over one without.
• 94% of employers believe that volunteering can add to skills.
• 94% of employees who volunteered to learn new skills had benefited either by getting their first job,
improving their salary, or being promoted.
Companies in the energy sector have always acquitted themselves well in this area, based on my
nonscientific observations. Some cynics might see this inclination as a need to compensate for the
energy industry’s unpopular image. But I prefer to think of volunteer work as a natural outgrowth of the
entrepreneurial spirit and tough work ethic that have always defined the energy industry.
One laudable new charitable initiative
in the energy industry is Geoscientists
Apart from its providing great opportunities

million funding from Schlumberger. The
catalyst for GWB was the December 2004
tsunami that devastated Southeast Asia.
GWB provides funding to projects that will bring benefits to communities in need where conditions and
hazards can be mitigated or removed using geoscience technology. Among the types of projects that could
be funded include tsunami warning seismic site, mapping contamination from old mine sites, prospecting
for fresh water in areas of scarce resources, mapping sinkholes in informal settlement areas, mapping old
mine underground workings, and assisting with archaeological digs.
Individual project funding could total as much as $50,000/year for up to 2 years, and project proposals
would be reviewed twice per year. More information about GWB can be found under the SEG Foundation
tab at SEG’s website at http://www.seg.org/. So go ahead: Make the world a better place, and advance your
career at the same time.

NOV addresses staff shortfall with new
technical college concept
Bob Williams, Managing Editor

When faced with an unprecedented level of
need for skilled technical staff—having to
double its targeted labor pool in 18 months—
amid an industry-wide shortage of skilledtrades workers, oil field supply/service giant
National Oilwell Varco opted for an ambitious
and novel solution: starting its own technical
college from scratch.
By all accounts, the National Oilwell Varco Technical
College has been a rousing success. NOV will graduate its
first class of 150 students in Houston and Kristiansand,
Norway, by yearend 2008. Plans call for putting 1,000
students through the school in 2009 and for adding classes
in Singapore.
NOV has pumped $30 million in the technical college
concept in order to recruit, train, and ultimately employ
desperately needed skilled workers in the areas of
hydraulics, electrical systems, and controls/software. The
new concept and training methods have worked so well
that NOV’s clients, mostly drilling contractors, have taken
notice for their own training needs.

Rig building boom
Two years ago, NOV was looking ahead to a disconcerting
scenario of worker shortages with the ongoing rig building
boom.
The rig building boom would put a strain not only on
NOV but on all of industry to come up with the people to
commission and service and support these new drilling
assets, according to Joe Rovig, group vice-president, global
operations, NOV Rig Solutions,
“The traditional way that industry has worked was that it
would ebb and flow, and you would hire people in ones and
twos, and grow on that basis,” he says. “But we were seeing a
dramatic increase in activity going forward.”
However, the traditional labor pools were inadequate to

the task of meeting future staffing needs, Rovig notes:
“Additionally, it wasn’t something that was happening just
to us, it was happening to everyone in the industry—where
retention became an issue for everyone in the industry;
everybody was trying to fish from a common pond.”

Technical college genesis
So NOV assembled a team to brainstorm solutions in early
2007 and quickly came to the conclusion that a step-change
concept was needed to address the trades staffing challenge,
because the traditional methods of recruiting, retaining,
and training workers would not give the company the
number of personnel it needed to serve its customers in the
years to come.
That resulted in an epiphany along the lines of “We’re not
going to be able to hire experienced people in the industry,
so we’re going to have to take it upon ourselves to go and
hire individuals and train them to a competency level to
where they can be able to stand on their own two feet before
we put them in the field,” recalls Rovig. “And that was the
birthplace of the technical college.”
NOV commissioned an internal group to screen, recruit, and
hire employees to eventually work in the areas of hydraulics,
electrical systems, and controls/software. But before they
would ever be placed in a “live” work situation, they would
receive 6-12 months of schooling while earning a salary.
“We went to senior management, and they funded us to
the tune of $30 million in the first year. That’s a significant
investment,” Rovig says.
The investment would go toward implementing a concept
that Rovig describes as, “We’re going to hire people, we’re
going to train them, and they’re going to become competent
to whichever discipline they’re in the college for, before
they ever start generating any revenue for the company.
“We believed we needed to double our own labor pool in a
period of 18 months. That was roughly an addition of 1,000
people. And that’s pretty much where we stand today.”

Rovig says it was important to dedicate sufficient resources
to the plan: “We needed to dedicate people, which included
recruiters, trainers, and management, to go out and drive the
establishment of the colleges. We needed to establish a team
to go out and recruit the right level of people to go into that
college. We then needed to create the curriculum and that
curriculum of teaching an individual who has no oil field
experience everything he needs to know about the oil field,

While the NOV Tech College is currently focused solely
on the company’s own needs, Rovig sees the potential for
eventually using elements of the school’s curriculum for
training others in the industry.
“It would allow NOV to train the oil industry, or at least
our part of the oil industry, to ensure a competent level of
manpower to service the number of new rigs coming to the

to deliver—representing just our aspect of offshore rigs—
another 100 rigs between now and 2012. And there’s a lot
more rigs out there to be delivered by others. The industry
is facing a huge manpower challenge. On top of which,
these new rigs are significantly more sophisticated than the
last time around.”

Dawson Geophysical’s Mears: Seismic crew
chief has many duties, but a rewarding job
Bob Williams, Managing Editor

Advances in seismic technology have been the
most important technological innovation in the
oil and gas industry of the past several decades.
Industry’s vastly expanded capability to interpret seismic
data and image subsurface formations from those data
have enabled oil and gas companies to make huge strides
in reducing exploratory risk and improving hydrocarbon
recovery rates.
This process can entail staggering displays of computing power
to create sophisticated three-dimensional and even fourdimensional (3-D over time) models that would probably wow
some CGI folks in Hollywood.
As dazzling as the technology is, it still falls to some roughand-ready folks in the field to make sure all of the geophones
and cables are properly placed and gathered back up in some
of the world’s most inhospitable locales. The work for those
who were once called “jug hustlers” is physically demanding
and can entail trudging through swamps, forests, or deserts
for 12–14 hours per day. And because the reflected seismic
waves are sometimes generated by explosions, the work can
get dangerous.
It takes a special kind of person to manage that crew and make
sure the job of collecting seismic data is done right. That’s
where Richard Mears comes in. Mears is the party manager
for Geophysical Party 24 of Midland, Tex.-based Dawson
Geophysical Co.
Dawson, founded in 1952, is the leading geophysical
contractor in the US, maintaining the largest number of
seismic crews across the Lower 48.

Party manager responsibilities
A party manager for a geophysical contractor has many
responsibilities, notes Mears.
“He has to hire and keep a crew of 50–100 people. His crew
will work long hours, 7 days a week, and are sure to spend long

En er gy Wo r k f o r c e

periods of time away from home and family. His crew will
often move from project to project and state to state.”
Party manager responsibilities include hiring new personnel,
training new personnel, quality control of field data, and
employee payroll and paperwork, according to Mears. He is
also responsible for the crew’s equipment, including more
than 30 vehicles and a number of 40-ft-long semi trailers and
smaller trailers for moving field equipment.
“All vehicles and trailers must be inspected and maintained
for safety and good operating condition for efficient field
operations,” Mears adds.
The seismic crew chief also must maintain good relations
with landowners, as the crew is often working on private as
well as public lands. This includes coordinating with permit
personnel, field surveyors, and client quality control people.
Additionally, he maintains an inventory of the millions of
dollars of equipment on the crew as well as ordering and/or
finding vehicle parts and geophysical equipment required keep
the crew working.

Typical work day
Mears offers this rundown of his typical work day:
“The clock goes off at 3:45 a.m. Shower, make coffee, check
e-mail and weather forecast. 6:00 a.m., meet crew for safety
meeting and to discuss problems and plans for the day. We
have a crew go out early—5:00 a.m.—to check the spread and
get the vibrators ready to work. Go back to the motel and
start the payroll for the day and start the daily report. Handle
inquiries from human resources and operations from the
main office. Go to the field. Check on layout/pickup crews,
recording truck, vibrators, and transcriber. Answer questions
and problems concerning operations that arise during the day.
Return to my field office/motel around 6:00 p.m. Respond to
any e-mails that have come in during the day. Crew finishes in
the field around 7:00 p.m. and is in town by 8:30 p.m. Finish
the payroll, daily report, and progress map for the day and
e-mail them. In bed early in order to be ready for tomorrow—
which comes early.”

Personal characteristics
A geophysical party manager must be able to work with
people, notes Mears—“be able to use their strengths and work
around their weaknesses; everyone is different.”
It’s also critical for a seismic crew chief to be organized and be
able to delegate in order to get the job done, he adds.
“And you have to be willing to work long hours and get
satisfaction from a job well done.”
For new entrants to the seismic data gathering business, Mears
recommends a drive to gain experience: “Start out learning most
of the jobs in the field and work up to the observer’s position.
Most party managers come from the ranks of the observers. Be
dependable and be at work and on time every day.”
Mears also notes that party managers can move up to
supervising several crews or go into the operations office in
several regions or the home office.

Today vs. yesterday
While tremendous advances in computing
power now enable a single technician to
process and interpret massive volumes
of seismic data in days vs. the months it
might have taken a roomful of geophysicists
a couple of decades ago, that kind of
productivity improvement doesn’t translate
to seismic crew activity, which has gotten
more labor-intensive because of the
relentless quest for more data.

While the basics are still the same—dealing with people,
ensuring personnel safety, making sure geophones are properly
planted, etc.—the scope of operations has greatly increased for
the seismic crew chief.
“There is just a whole lot more of everything to deal with,”
Mears says. “The quality of the equipment and end product
have greatly improved since the old analog days.
“Back then, recording instruments frequently broke down,
and the observer might have to pull vacuum tubes from the
instruments and take them to the local store to test them on
the machines used for checking television vacuum tubes.
When they were bad, you had to hope they had a new one
to replace the bad tube.
Same problem with the
old vacuum tube radios
used to communicate with
personnel on the crew.”

“When I started in the geophysical industry
in 1967, we used 12 and/or 24 live receiver
stations for each source point acquired with 2-D recording,”
Mears noted. “Today, with 3-D recording, we use up to 7,000
live stations for each source point acquired.
“Back then, 12–20 people could handle the operation,
including permitting and surveying. Now a field crew can have
up to 100 people, plus several permit people, lead front end
people, and multiple survey crews. Permitting and surveying
can start 6–18 months before a project is ready to be recorded.

Personal proﬁle
Mears was hired out of Tyler Junior College in Tyler, Tex., by
Petty Geophysical Engineering Co. in 1967.
“I worked in a party chief ’s office doing interpretation,” he
recounts. “Back then we worked from field records. All NMO
(normal move-out) corrections and dip migrations were done
by hand and mechanical adding machines.
“At that time most crews had a party chief in town in the
interpretation office and a party manager with the field crew
running the field operations. As time went by, crews became
‘bobtail’—with no interpretation office.”

Mears then worked as a computer on field crews, working
hand-calculated survey notes, quality checking field data, and
handling general paperwork and reports.
He was promoted to party manager in West Virginia in 1972
and had the first Petty-Ray crew in Illinois 6 months before the
merger of Petty Geophysical with the Ray Geophysical division
of Geosource.
“I had the crew that allowed seismic crews to work on

Indonesia, Pakistan, and Egypt.
“I have met a great number of very interesting people,” he adds.
“Working outside and not having to sit in an office all day every
day is a large plus. In general, as long as operations are going
well, I do not have anyone messing with me every day.
“I like having a smooth running operation with people I can
depend on to do the job right. “There are challenges of some
sort every day, but the only drawback is being away from home
most of the time.”
After 41 years, Mears says he still enjoys the work.

Mears also bossed the first crew allowed to work on the
Navajo Indian reservation in Arizona in 25 years and later
worked overseas as a quality control consultant on seismic

GE: Clean energy concerns help
drive stafﬁng initiatives
Bob Williams, Managing Editor

Energy concerns at the forefront of public
awareness today are helping to drive staffing
initiatives in the power industry.
Power production and distribution companies and the
companies that serve the power industry are capitalizing
on a surge of interest in the topic of energy—notably
alternative and clean energy sources—to bolster sagging
ranks depleted by a workforce dominated by employees
approaching retirement.
General Electric is one of those companies that sees strong
staffing opportunities in the media frenzy over energy.
“Today’s power industry is very exciting and
competitive,” says Kim Warne, manager of the GE Center
of Excellence supporting US recruiting and staffing
operations for five GE businesses: Energy, Aviation,
Transportation, Water & Process Technologies, and Oil
& Gas. “Innovative shifts to alternative power sources
such as renewable energy and cleaner coal, as well
as traditional power sources such as natural gas and
nuclear, are driving tremendous interest and activity.”

“Innovative shifts to alternative power sources such as renewable energy and cleaner
coal, as well as traditional power sources
such as natural gas and nuclear, are driving
tremendous interest and activity” in working
in the power sector.
— Kim Warne, GE

Warne points out that while many talented professionals
pursing careers in the power industry are joining GE, “we
are also seeing a global shortage of graduates with technical
degrees, so the competition is heating up for qualified
engineers and scientists. In this environment, GE’s goal is to

14

recruit, develop, and retain the best available talent.”
Translating ‘buzz’ into recruiting
The nightly news is helping to remind everyone about the
need for clean, reliable energy, notes Warne, so GE needs to
translate that “buzz” into more effective recruiting.
One way GE Energy attracts new college graduates is
through its world-class leadership programs.
“Technical graduates (both undergrad and graduate) can
apply to our Edison Engineering Development Program
(design/development), Operations Management Leadership
Program (manufacturing/sourcing), or Commercial
Leadership Program (sales/marketing),” Warne says. “Our
program members rotate through different assignments
and attend formal training classes. By combining these
programs with mentoring and exposure to GE leadership,
we are able to develop the next generation of GE leaders.”
GE also has a Renewable Energy Leadership Program for
recent MBA graduates with experience in the renewable
industry and a Field Engineering program for field service
careers. More information about these programs can be
found at www.gecareers.com.
Nontraditional recruiting
GE Energy’s recruiting efforts go beyond
traditional methods, such as postings on the
usual internet job boards.
The company set up a new microsite (http://
____
www.jobs.gecareers.com/whygeenergy) that
provides information to candidates about its
business and highlights featured jobs, with
monthly updates. The site also invites viewers
to a monthly webinar to learn more and allows
them to sign up for more information.
“We also have a page with information about GE Energy
programs to help employees balance their professional
and personal obligations with flexible work arrangements

and benefits, such as paid time off, family leave and care
programs, educational program’s and adoption assistance,”
Warne says. “In addition, when we meet candidates who
may be interested in GE for the future, we stay connected
to them via periodic recruiter check-ins and a short
newsletter.”
Retention initiatives
GE Energy is focused on several key retention initiatives,
according to Warne.
“First, due to the large number of new people we bring
into our business each year, we find that orientation and
assimilation are critical to retaining talent within the first
12 months,” she says. “We have new-hire checklists that
walk new employees through the first 30-60 days. We have
also developed a PowerOn new employee assimilation
program, which is mandatory for all new hires. We provide
information on the business, our products, critical processes,
and operating mechanisms. We also provide bimonthly
newsletters to keep new employees up to date on tools and
information that’s useful as they become acclimated to GE.”
Also as part of its retention initiatives, GE Energy is actively
targeting its employees who have been with the business for
2-5 years.
“We have created a special program called Energized Faces,
Exciting Places that highlights employees at various stages
in their careers and details why they decided to come to GE
and why they choose to stay,” Warne says. “The program
also provides a tool for employees to blog with one another
about their experiences.”
GE Energy also came to the conclusion that no matter
“what career stage you are in, your manager plays a large
role in your overall ‘engagement’ and therefore retention
with GE Energy.”
Accordingly, in 2007, GE launched a Contemporary
Leadership Series for all managers.
“These sessions focused on Knowing and Connecting with
Employees, Coaching Skills, Empowering Employees,
Appreciating Employees, and finally Building a Global Team,”
Warne notes. “Retention needs to be driven at the manageremployee level and needs to be specific to each person.”

Advice to new entrants
Addressing a typical young person considering or just
starting a career in the power industry, Warne’s best advice
is to “follow your passion.”
New industry entrants should “take a job in the industry
that makes you excited every day when you go to work.
Push for challenges as soon as you are ready. Ask for
additional responsibility once you’ve proven your ability to
excel in your current role.”
“As we explore alternative energy sources for this and future

ENERGY INTEREST

Utility Achieves Success in Tackling Aging
Workforce, Training, Recruitment Challenges

FirstEnergy Corp. has had to face issues
common to many utilities over the last few years.
This includes the aging workforce, loss of institutional
knowledge, and the lack of a steady flow of new recruits
ready and able to learn the business. More recently, the
company has been wrapping its collective wits around the
workforce implications of the Energy Policy Act of 2005
(EPAct). Per this legislation, utilities and other power
producers are now required to qualify their workforces for
the different positions they hold.
“The capabilities of our employees are core to how we create
value,” said Dick Grigg, executive vice-president and chief
operating officer for FirstEnergy. “People who perform line
service and meter reading all are part of our core business. What
we realize from a financial perspective is that it will cost us
severely if we have to shut things down. That isn’t an option.”
Accordingly, FirstEnergy has worked with workforce
consultancy Interliance Consulting Inc. of Santa Ana, Calif.,
for several years. Interliance Pres. Brad Kamph sees dire times
ahead unless the energy sector takes action to resolve its most
pressing workforce challenges.
“A recent study showed that employee attrition is costing the
natural gas industry over $575,000,000 per year, so that means
it must be costing the energy sector billions of dollars annually,”
said Kamph. “Without proactive steps taken both by the industry
as a whole and by individual companies, the attrition-related
losses are expected to swell by another 30% within 5 years.”

Baby boomer retirements
As the baby boom generation gradually enteers retirement, a
number of industries are finding themselves impacted.
The energy sector is one area that is hurting badly due to
retirements. According to the US Department of Labor (DOL),
the median age for workers in the utilities field, for example, is
3.3 years higher than the national average. And during the past
9 years, the median age of utilities industry employees has risen

En er gy Wo r k f o r c e

from 41.1 years to 43.7 years. For utilities as a whole, that means
now that around 150,000 employees fall in the 55–64 age group,
with another 25,000 or so over the age of 65—about 15% of the
workforce—eligible for retirement.
DOL has identified a number of positions that will experience
heavy retirement rates in the next few years. Between now and
2012, 22–33% of staff will retire who hold positions as electric
power linemen, nuclear engineers, reactor operators, nuclear
technicians, power plant operators, first-line supervisors,
mechanical technicians, pipefitters, plumbers, maintenance
technicians, and electrical technicians.
“Currently, there are 360,000 electrical and 23,000 registered
power engineers, yet today there are only about 500
undergraduate degrees awarded annually in power engineering
compared with nearly 2,000 in the 1980s,” said Kamph.
“When you combine that data with the retirement picture, it
indicates that utilities have to elevate their workforce initiatives
to a strategic level in order to guarantee the future of the
organization and safeguard institutional knowledge.”
Executives at FirstEnergy were among the first at utilities
to recognize the problem and have been among the most
aggressive in pursuing solutions.
“In the late 1990s, we recognized that we faced a serious age
demographics issue,” said Charlie Lasky, FirstEnergy’s vicepresident of fossil operations. “We know that close to 74% of our
fossil operations workforce will be eligible to retire in the next
10 years. We were very concerned about sustaining the years of
skills and equipment knowledge that our employees have built
up over the past 25 years.”
FirstEnergy is a diversified electric company headquartered
in Akron, Ohio. Its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in
the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, as
well as energy management and other energy-related services.
Its seven electric utility operating companies comprise the
fifth largest investor-owned electric system in the US, serving
4.5 million customers within 36,100 square miles of Ohio,
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Its generation subsidiaries control

more than 14,000 MW of capacity.
While the company began building a strategy for dealing with
the retirement bubble almost a decade ago, most other utility
executives only became aware of the problem in the past 2 or 3
years. As a result, it already has a system in place to address this
growing problem.
“The fossil group at FirstEnergy decided to take advantage
of this opportunity to redefine what our future organization
needed to be, in order to be successful,” said Lasky. “Similar to
other portions of our standard operation system, we developed a
manual for workforce development.”
This workforce development manual includes standardized
employee development strategies, standardized employee
skill definitions, standardized roles and responsibilities,
standardized measures of success, and building a common
culture of how employees are developed.
At the same time, FirstEnergy executives also began to build

relationships with local colleges and universities to create a
2-year degree program for potential candidates for each of its
critical skill sets.
“We felt it was critical to accelerate training in power plant
basics through these schools, since they specialized in training,
and then begin a hands-on training program as soon as the
new employees started working in our plants,” said Lasky.

Spanning entire workforce
Lasky headed the effort to standardize employee development in
the fossil generation business, which has about 1,800 employees.
At the same time, other leadership at FirstEnergy also began
working on the problem in order to ensure the entirety of its
14,500 employee workforce was taken care of.
“In each of our operations, we have the same strategic issue,”
said Grigg. “We are very much focused on institutionalizing the
knowledge of our employees.”
Years ago, this was referred to as “tribal knowledge,” he pointed

power industry is on the leading edge of technology. We have
some of the most sophisticated control systems out there for
such things as water treatment and environmental control.”

Tradition versus innovation
FirstEnergy soon realized that traditional methods of recruiting
and training employees would not be sufficient to achieve its
workforce aims. As a result, its fossil operations group hired
Interliance to develop the optimum approach.
“Recruiting is the first critical step to be successful in this
process,” said Lasky. “Pre-employment candidate qualification
and minimum hiring requirements must be well-defined to
allow the interviewers to properly evaluate job candidates.
Evaluating and optimizing the screening process can save
significant cost associated with training.”
Other areas that had to be improved or standardized included
employee profiles, curricula, tasks, procedures, training, and
performance criteria.

“This level of ongoing development will help us sustain new
generations of the workforce focused around a questioning and
performance-based culture,” said Lasky.
One of the major departures from how utilities have acquired
and trained employees in the past, something Interliance
specializes in, is converting
“knowledge” into systems and
processes that enable new
employees to perform at a
higher level more quickly.

“We have completed a full set of on-the-job training modules
and evaluations and are in the process of customizing them for
each plant location. We also created an automated assessment
process that provides real-time results for each new employee
that pinpoints individual development needs.”
FirstEnergy’s fossil operations department also finalized
on-the-job training modules with the assistance of subject
matter experts to capture critical knowledge and best
practices to pass on to new employees.

Of course, FirstEnergy, like other
utilities, is competing for a declining

the modules again. Instead, they complete a program that is
about one-fifth the size of that for entry training.

performance and impact the bottom line.”
One immediate factor is that power producers need to
adopt some kind of standardized program for personnel
training. The act notes that the National Electric Safety Code
and other industry bodies can help companies with their
training guidelines. The point here is not to wait for the DOL,
Department of Energy, or anyone else to issue guidelines but
to get to work on it now.
“The last thing you want is to be called to the carpet after a
blackout or brownout is traced to operator error,” said Kamph.
“When an investigation reveals lack of mandated training and
qualification procedures, penalties could be severe.”
FirstEnergy’s lead in this area is one that others could well
follow. With its manual for workforce development already in
hand and established partnerships with learning establishments,
it is already well on the way to complying with EPAct’s
workforce section. For example, it has established programs with
local colleges and universities to create a 2-year degree program
for potential candidates for each of its critical skill sets.
“We worked closely with Interliance to develop a post-hire
training process using a structured, on-the-job training
approach,” said Brian Wilkins, staff generation specialist at
FirstEnergy. “As we tailored it to each job classification at each
plant, it fits like a glove.”
FirstEnergy accepts only staff with a 2-year degree in the applied
science of their line of production, or equivalent. Someone who
has served in a propulsion division within the US Navy, for
example, would meet the qualifications for consideration.
New arrivals go through a structured, on-the-job training
regimen based on well-defined modules, within 2 years or less.
The modules were developed by SMEs (subject matter experts)
and customized for each plant. Incentives exist for completing
the required modules ahead of schedule.
“We had two employees who finished the operations modules
in about 14 months,” said Wilkins. “There is a clear incentive
to complete the modules based on pay hikes linked to
training progress.”
He notes, though, that Section 1103 does not specify how
frequently requalification is to be done. FirstEnergy has decided
to do it every 5 years. Employees won’t have to go through all

En er gy Wo r k f o r c e

A c h i e v e s

“This mainly consists of carrying out specific tasks under the
observation of a supervisor who verifies every step is done
correctly,” said Wilkins. “We begin qualifying the first 20%
of our workforce next year, starting with those with least
seniority. It doesn’t make sense to subject soon-to-be retirees
to requalification.”
There is a case that can be made that quality training translates
to quality operation. When FirstEnergy investigates trips, for
example, if a case of operator error is determined, it can receive
special focus to be incorporated into the associated module as
part of ongoing training.
“The goal is continuous improvement,” concluded Wilkins, “and
we believe training and qualification play a vital role and that
they can strongly influence plant performance.”

Compliance exercise vs. ROI
One thing to avoid, however, when engaging in workforce
programs in response to EPAct Section 1103 is to treat it as yet
another compliance exercise and do the minimum necessary
to satisfy the terms of the act. Some firms made that mistake
earlier with the Sarbanes Oxley Act. A few ended up spending
a fortune in compliance without realizing any real efficiency
or profitability gain. Similarly, implementation of the operator
qualification aspects of the Pipeline Safety Act, in some cases,
has resulted in a compliance expense that doesn’t translate into
heightened employee performance.
The winning approach is to embrace EPAct’s workforce
provisions as an opportunity to improve performance across
the board. Instead of a generalized “train the workers more,” or
“adopt computer-based training,” it has to be broken down into
many different job classification categories and equipment types,
systems, and/or skills for each job.
“There is no substitute for training that familiarizes employees
with how to perform actions on the ground and that results in
heightened competence,” said Kamph. “This training should be
monitored based on how effective it is against such metrics as
error rates and other efficiency statistics. That’s the only way to
make the investment in training achieve a measurable ROI.” —EW

CONDENSATE EAST OF SUEZ:
NGL and its Naphtha Impacts in
Asia Pacific and Mideast Gulf
Condensate and the Light-End Products Squeeze
By Asia Paciﬁc Energy Consulting

• This is the “deﬁnitive” report on
condensate in the fastest growing,
critical regions of the world, Asia
Paciﬁc and the Mideast Gulf.
• The study provides a complete guide
to optimizing value in future condensate production, utilization, and trade.

Condensate coming into its own
Condensate, one of the two groups
deﬁned as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs),
is ﬁnally coming of age in world trade,
marketing, reﬁning and petrochemicals. Condensate sales are moving
from a niche marketing specialty to
a mainstream segment of crude and
products trade, and nowhere is this
more evident than in the Mideast Gulf
and Asia Paciﬁc.
This report explains how the protean
nature of condensate allows it to be
used in a wide range of sectors: as a
reﬁnery slate component; in specialized distillation towers called condensate splitters; in direct feed to ethylene crackers; in gasoline blending and
as a substitute for gas in turbine power generation. It can be deﬁned as a
base material, a blending component,
a feedstock or a boiler feed.

Innovation:

it’s genetic

It starts with the right people
and it ends with the right solution.
GE’s Oil & Gas business is built on a hereditary drive
for continuous innovation. For more than 100 years
we’ve been setting new standards in compression
technology, pipeline integrity, drilling, completion
and production, both on land and subsea.
Today, our 10,500 people are reaching further than
ever before: with larger LNG plants, lower cryogenic
temperatures, higher injection pressures, safer,
more productive pipelines and, through VetcoGray,
deeper waters and wells in every environment. And
our Global Services team is continually injecting
new technologies into aging equipment to maintain
peak performance.
Throughout our history and across the industry, our
goal has always been clear: continually develop
technologies that push production boundaries to
new levels and help meet increasing demand for
oil and gas. It’s as true today as it was when we
began, and it will remain so into the future.

EU member states’ gas use falls 1.5% in 2007
Natural gas consumption in the 27 member states of the European Union fell 1.5% in 2007 compared with 2006 because of
widespread mild weather early in the year.
In some countries high energy prices and increased efficiency
also played a role, said Eurogas in Brussels. Natural gas consumption amounted to 505 billion cu m compared with 513 billion cu
m in 2006.
By yearend 2007, the number of customers connected to the
EU 27 gas grid increased 1% to 110.2 million, pulled along by the
UK, Spain, and Italy, which made up for a negative trend in the
other countries.
Indigenous production decreased 7% to 198 billion cu m with
drops in major producing countries such as the UK, down 9.9%;
Germany, down 8.3%; Denmark, down 11.4%; and Italy, down
11.5%. Eurogas said indigenous production provides the highest
percentage of gas supplied in the EU 27, covering 38% of total net
supplies in 2007.
The main external sources of gas are Russia with 23%, Norway with 18%, and Algeria 10%. It was increasing imports from
Norway, which mainly compensated for the drop in indigenous
production.

ETP settles gas market manipulation charges
Energy Transfer Partners LP of Dallas and three of its subsidiaries agreed to pay a $10 million fine to settle charges that they
attempted to manipulate natural gas markets, the US Commodity
Futures Trading Commission announced.
The federal commodities regulator charged the Dallas publicly
traded energy partnership and subsidiaries Energy Transfer Co. of
San Antonio and Houston, Houston Pipeline Co. of Houston, and
ETC Marketing Ltd. of San Antonio and Houston in a Jul. 26, 2007,
complaint.
The complaint alleged that from September to early December
of 2005, ETP and its subsidiaries sold massive quantities of gas
on the InterContinental Exchange to place downward pressure on
prices at the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) delivery hub, according
to CFTC.
It said the defendants then reported these transactions to McGraw
Hill Co.’s Inside FERC Gas Market Reports in an effort to manipulate

the HSC gas price index that the reporting service calculated and
disseminated in its October and December 2005 issues. ETP and its
units did this in an effort to benefit their financial swap positions
which were tied to Inside FERC HSC gas index prices during that
period, CFTC said.
The agency and ETP settled the charges in a consent order that
imposed a permanent injunction against all defendants and ordered them to pay the fine while releasing ETP and its affiliates, directors, and employees from claims or assertions in the proceeding.
The agreement, which contains no findings of fact or conclusions
of law, was entered before US District Judge Ed Kinkeade of the
Northern District of Texas on Mar. 17.

Indonesia looks to replace BP Migas chairman
Indonesia, seeking to replace Kardaya Warnika as chairman of
the country’s upstream oil and gas regulator BP Migas, will present
three potential candidates for parliament to consider next month.
Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro,
who Mar. 12 confirmed that Kardaya would be replaced before his
tenure ended in 2010, identified the three candidates and said their
names would be presented to parliament.
Purnomo said it was simply time to “refresh” the agency, declining to say if the replacement plan had come in response to
complaints by lawmakers over Kardaya’s performance in office.
Purnomo named the candidates as R. Priyono, currently director for upstream activities at the ministry; Evita H. Legowo, an assistant to the minister for human resources and technology; and
Hadi Purnomo, director of a research and development center for
oil and gas technology.
Reports said lawmakers have been demanding a replacement
for Kardaya, saying his administration of BP Migas failed to increase the country’s output of crude oil. The country’s oil production has declined over the past 5 years, falling below 1 million b/d
in 2007.
Kardaya, who has held his post since 2005, several times failed
to appear before legislators, sending his deputy instead. Lawmaker Tjatur Sapto Edy said parliament is ready to test the candidates
next month and hope to install the new chairman by the end of
April. ✦

is to sidetrack the well to the oil leg updip, Hess said.
“Based on the results to date of the Pony No. 2 well, the estimated range of gross recoverable resource on the Hess-owned
portion of the structure has been narrowed to 100-500 million
bbl from the previous estimated 100-600 million bbl,” the company said.
Hess owns a 100% working interest in Pony, and is evaluating
a range of development options for the discovery.

Aminex has gas success near Songo Songo ﬁeld
A wildcat well operated by Ndovu Resources Ltd. (Aminex) in
a joint venture with Australian companies Key Petroleum Ltd. and
Bounty Oil & Gas NL, both of Perth, has found natural gas about 2
km from producing Songo Songo gas field in Tanzania.
Key Petroleum, which has 20% interest, said the well, Kiliwani
North-1, was drilled in the southern tip of Songo Songo Island and
has intersected a 60-m gross gas column in the same Neocomian
sand reservoirs producing at Songo Songo field.
Electric logs and formation pressure data have confirmed the
presence of gas.

Drilling

&

Kiliwani North-1 was drilled on the so-called Nyuni Block
and will be completed as a future gas producer. Further drilling
will be needed to confirm the size of the find.
The close proximity of Songo Songo to Dar Es Salaam gas
pipeline bodes well for an early development. Key Petroleum said
there is additional potential in Tertiary age reservoirs that may be
the target of future wells.
Ndovu Resources holds 40%, RAK Gas Commission 25%, Key
Petroleum 20%, East Africa Exploration Ltd. 10%, and Bounty
5%.

Total acquires interest in Alaskan blocks
Total SA will join Chevron Corp. in exploring the onshore White
Hills blocks in Alaska by drilling three wells for the winter season.
The White Hills blocks lie 40 km southwest of Prudhoe Bay field in
Alaska’s central North Slope.
Total has gained a 30% interest in the blocks and the partners
plan to drill several exploration wells during next winter. Chevron
will operate the blocks with a 70% interest.
The acreage covers 2,000 sq km. ✦

Production

TPAO producing gas from Ayazli ﬁeld
Operator Turkish Petroleum Corp. (TPAO) has begun producing natural gas from Ayazli gas field in the Black Sea off Turkey,
reported partner Stratic Energy Corp., Calgary.
Ayazli is the third gas field in which production has begun under Phase 1 of the South Akcakoca sub-basin development program. Production began last year from Akkaya and East Ayazli fields.
Officials said initial flow rates from Ayazli support operator estimates that production from the field will average more than 10
MMscfd. Production from the two existing fields recently has been
17 MMscfd gross.
TPAO has started well intervention projects to add further perforations on the East Ayazli-2 well to increase production from that field.
TPAO has 51% interest in the permit area. Dallas-based Toreador
Resources Corp. has 36.75%, and Stratic Energy has 12.25%.

UK Chancellor changes decommissioning tax rules
North Sea operators are welcoming tax changes by the UK
Chancellor that aim to extend the life of marginal oil fields.
During his first budget, Alistair Darling reported he would reform petroleum revenue tax (PRT) and help operators cover the
treatment of decommissioning costs of oil and gas installations in
the UK North Sea.
Companies can delay decommissioning because of an exten-

sion of corporation tax loss carry-back to 2002, instead of 3 years
as was previously the case. The government will also address inconsistencies regarding the application of PRT to decommissioning
liabilities and the proposal to remove PRT nonpayers from future
exposure to the tax.
Trade association Oil & Gas UK welcomed the measures but
stressed that more fiscal changes were needed to attract investment
in a competitive global environment.
Malcolm Webb, OGUK’s chief executive, said the new changes will provide greater certainty and consistency. “However, this
should only be regarded as the start of the process of simplifying
and easing the tax burden on UK oil and gas production, and we
look forward to the next stage of the government consultation producing further positive outcomes to that end.”
Investment on the UK continental shelf fell by £1 billion in
2007. OGUK said it was necessary to change the 50-75% tax
rate on new projects if the UK is to carry on producing hydrocarbons.
Mike Tholen, OGUK’s economics director, added: “The future
of the North Sea can only be properly secured by simplifying and
reducing the overall tax burden to ensure [that] investment can be
sustained in this mature and challenging province.”
The government estimates that it will receive £9.9 billion in
tax revenues from the North Sea in 2008-09, up from £7.7 billion
this year. ✦

Purvin & Gertz expects the growth to pick up in 2008-09.
High LPG prices are reducing demand growth in residential and
commercial sectors, especially in unsubsidized markets in developing economies, Otto said.
All of these factors will push more supplies into the petrochemical feedstock sector. A large expansion of petrochemical capacity is
under way in the Middle East, which will increase fairly dramatically base-load demand for LPG. Global LPG supplies, however, will
grow faster than base demand, which will increase the amount of
LPG available for the feedstock market, Otto said.
Global LPG supply will increase by 43 million tonnes during
2007-12, increasing to about 272 million tonnes from 229 million tonnes, Otto said.
LPG production is growing in most regions of the world, the
exception being North America. Because LPG production in North
America will be fairly flat, Otto expects the Middle East to surpass
North America in a few years to become the largest LPG producing
region in the world. The Middle East will expand LPG production
more than 45% during 2007-12.
Overall, Otto expects that LPG supply growth will average
3.5%/year through 2012. About 50% of this growth will come
from nonassociated gas.

study. The two companies also will consider forming a joint venture to build the refinery, should they decide to proceed.
Irving Oil conducted initial feasibility work and informal public
consultation in 2006 on the proposed refinery, and has been engaged since January 2007 in permitting, public consultation, and
engineering design for the facility.
The refinery would be situated close to Irving Oil’s existing
300,000 b/d refinery and the existing Irving Canaport deepwater
oil terminal, which receives cargoes of oil from very large crude
carriers (VLCCs) and is 65 miles from the US border.
This next phase of engineering, design and feasibility work,
combined with ongoing permitting and community engagement
activities, represents more than $100 million of investment over
the next 12-15 months, Irving Oil said.
A final investment decision is not expected before 2009. The
refinery is expected to cost at least $7 billion. If permitting approval is received and an investment decision is made to proceed,
site preparation would begin in 2010 with full-scale construction
to begin in 2011. Start-up is expected in 2015.

Petrobras, Mitsui form Brazilian ethanol venture
Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) is forming a 50:50
joint venture with Mitsui & Co. Ltd. of Japan for investments in
renewable energy.
The new joint venture, called Participacoes Nippo Brasileira em
Complexos Bioenergeticos SA, will provide ethanol for the Japanese market, Petrobras said.
In February Petrobras said it would join with Mitsui and Brazilian builder Camargo Correa SA to form a JV to build the world’s
first ethanol-only pipeline.
The pipeline, with a capacity to transport 12 million cu m/year
of ethanol, will ship the biofuel from sugarcane-growing areas in
western Brazil to the Atlantic coast in Sao Paulo state.

Repsol-YPF SA has awarded a contract to Foster Wheeler Ltd. unit
Foster Wheeler Iberia SAU, Madrid, for the detailed engineering, procurement services, and construction management of a new delayed
coker complex at its refinery in Cartagena in southeastern Spain.
The coking complex consists of a 53,000 b/sd delayed coker unit,
a gas concentration unit, and a 90,000 b/sd vacuum distillation unit.
The coker will use Foster Wheeler’s Sydec process technology.
The value of this contract was not disclosed. In 2007, Foster
Wheeler Iberia was awarded a separate contract for the design and
supply of the coker-fired heaters that are an integral part of the
coker unit.

GDF receives ﬁrst LNG from Snohvit
The first shipment to France of LNG from Snohvit in Norway
was delivered to Gaz de France’s Montoir-de-Bretagne terminal in
Brittany Mar. 12. The Provalys LNG carrier, especially fitted out to
withstand the severe weather conditions in Norway’s arctic waters,
will unload 154,500 cu m of LNG, marking the opening of a new
LNG supply route capable of providing 700 million cu m/year of
gas for the European market.
Snohvit field licensees are StatoilHydro (operator) 33.5%, Petoro 30%, Total E&P Norway 18.4%, Gaz de France 12%, Hess
3.3%, and RWE Dea Norway 2.8%.
LNG accounted for 31.5% of Gaz de France’s overall gas supplies in 2007. Deliveries from Snohvit will increase its supply flexibility. The group is already the largest LNG importer in Europe. It
has been involved in the Snohvit project, in which it holds a 12%
stake, from initial development planning. Commissioned in September 2007, the Hammerfest facility is the first liquefaction plant
in Europe, said Gaz de France.
Norway currently is the group’s main natural gas supplier, accounting for 21.5% of its overall supply portfolio. Gaz de France
Norge is also involved in Norway’s upstream and in 2006 was approved by the Norwegian authorities as operator for the production phase of Gjoa field, another natural gas development.

Woodside bids to supply LNG to Singapore
Woodside Petroleum Ltd. is competing for a multibillion-dollar
contract to become Singapore’s exclusive supplier of LNG, according to Woodside Chief Executive Officer Don Voelte.
Woodside is on a shortlist of five groups bidding for a contract
to provide 3 million tonnes/year of LNG starting in 2012, Voelte
said, adding that his company might partner with Singapore Power,
if successful.
Singapore’s Energy Market Authority, which expects to announce the successful bidder as early as next month, has not disclosed the names of the four other bidders. The winner will supply
the country’s planned LNG regasification facility.
Construction of the $1 billion terminal is expected to begin
late this year or early in 2009 to enable the city-state to begin importing LNG by late 2011 or early 2012, according to S. Iswaran,
Minister of State for Trade and Industry (OGJ Online, Feb. 2,
2008).

Williams, TransCanada propose gas pipeline
Williams Cos. Inc. and TransCanada Corp. are evaluating joint development of Sunstone Pipeline, a major transmission line that would
transport natural gas supplies from the Rockies to the US West.
The proposed 618-mile, 42-in. Sunstone line would have a capacity of 1.2 bcfd. The line, proposed for service in 2011, would
be built parallel to the existing Williams Northwest Pipeline system
10

between the Opal Hub in Wyoming and Stanfield, Ore. Williams’
Northwest system interconnects at Stanfield with TransCanada’s
Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) pipeline system.
The project provides the option to deliver gas to markets served
by the Northwest and GTN pipeline systems. Sunstone’s open season commenced Mar. 17 and extends through Apr. 30. GTN will
have an additional open season to offer existing capacity available
on its pipeline system between Stanfield and GTN’s terminus at
Malin, Ore., near California’s northern border.
Sunstone would provide broad access and enhance supply diversity to markets throughout the Pacific Northwest, northern
Nevada and northern California. It would require construction of
fewer miles of pipeline along existing utility corridors, including
segments of Northwest’s existing pipeline system and would provide favorable rates due to efficiencies from existing infrastructure
and operations along the route, officials said. Moreover, Williams
has recent construction experience along the pipeline corridor.

Keystone oil line construction to start in 2Q
A partnership of TransCanada Corp. and ConocoPhillips subsidiaries received a presidential permit from the US State Department
to proceed with construction, maintenance, and operation of the
proposed 2,148-mile Keystone oil pipeline. It will transport Canadian crude to US markets.
“We will begin construction in second-quarter 2008 to achieve
an in-service date of fourth-quarter 2009,” said Hal Kvisle,
TransCanada president and chief executive officer.
Affiliates of TransCanada will construct and operate Keystone,
which will be capable of delivering 590,000 b/d of crude from
Hardisty, Alta., to US Midwestern markets at Wood River and Patoka, Ill., and to Cushing, Okla. Initial deliveries to Patoka are expected to begin in late 2009.
Keystone has secured firm long-term contracts of 495,000 b/d
with an average duration of 18 years.

Taiwan mulls ending CPC’s gas import monopoly
A number of wTaiwanese legislators have proposed a new
Natural Gas Industry Act that could end state-owned CPC Corp.’s
monopoly on gas importation. A draft of the act is expected to
be completed and submitted to the Taiwan’s Cabinet for approval
before the end of April.
If enacted into law, the act would enable other companies to
lease CPC’s LNG terminals and pipelines. CPC owns Taiwan’s only
two LNG receiving terminals.
A prime candidate for leasing CPC’s terminals is the Taiwan
Power Co. (Taipower), which accounts for 60% of Taiwan’s total
LNG consumption. Taipower has petitioned the government to import LNG directly and will consider building its own terminal if
permission is granted. ✦

Enterprise drives exploration
The letter “Peak-oil context” by
Michael Lynch (OGJ, Feb. 25, 2008, p.
12) correctly points out that large additional reserves continue to be added to
the world’s capacity, despite statements
that the “elephants” have all been found
(see, for example, the size of Tupi, p. 34
of the same edition). The figures should
influence the market price of oil. The fact
that they do not and the daily fluctuation of a few dollars along a rising trend
point to market manipulation for which
we all pay, and for which the industry
will undoubtedly soon suffer, repeating
history (yet again).
Peak oil understanding rests upon the
presumption that current paradigms are
correct and final. These act as a brake on
knowledge development.
Fortunately, enterprise drives exploration to new frontiers, new surprises
(Jack, Tupi, Indian gas, etc.), and new
reserve additions.
An example of a paradigm that needs
to fall is the 40-year-old idea that the
Caribbean Plate came from the Pacific
and therefore is oceanic. Many data
show that the area shares geological
history with the Gulf of Mexico and that
continental crust is distributed around
and within the plate.
Oil is seen in Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Cuba, Belize, Guatemala,
Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and
Panama. Prolific hydrocarbon provinces exist north and south in the Gulf
of Mexico and along northern South
America. The Caribbean is a surprise
waiting to happen. Once understood it
will point the way to analogues elsewhere in the world. Peak-oil history has
a long way to go.

fact, refining is what pulled down many
firms’ earnings in the fourth quarter of
2007. Independent refiners lost money
not only for the quarter, but also for the
entire year (see story, p. 31).
Refining margins sank during last
year’s final quarter, as feedstock costs
soared to record highs. US refining
margins posted sharp declines from
their second-quarter 2007 peaks.
For example, the US Gulf Coast cash
refining margin fell to average $8.11/
bbl in the fourth quarter of last year
vs. $19.68/bbl in the second quarter, according to Muse, Stancil & Co.
Meanwhile, feedstock costs in the same
region averaged $89.40/bbl in the
fourth quarter, up from $71.64/bbl in
the second quarter of last year.
Refinery utilization is lower, too. Last
month, it averaged 85.6% in the US,
according to the American Petroleum
Institute. For all of 2007, utilization
averaged 88.5%.
In its most recent Monthly Oil
Market Report, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries said the
decline in refining margins over the
last few months has negatively affected
refining operations across the board,
leading to early maintenance, especially
in the Western Hemisphere.
Further, the report said the current
conditions of the product markets (i.e.,
sluggish demand) and refining margins
may encourage more discretionary cuts
to utilization in the near future. ✦

Attention to cost
Economic gloom fast engulfing the US economy contains at least one reason for hope. The new
attention it forces onto cost might keep the country from rushing into peril over global warming.
Politically, sad as it is to say, the global-warming
debate is over in the US. All candidates with any
hope for winning the presidency support mandatory limits on emissions of greenhouse gases,
whether or not the measures offer reasonable
prospect for affecting global average temperature.
All candidates, in other words, support the imposition of certain cost in pursuit of very uncertain
benefit against the crucial metric of measured
temperature. They all want the government to set
limits on emissions of greenhouse gases, especially
carbon dioxide. And they all dodge the core question: Can restriction of the relatively small amount
of CO2 subject to human control, which may well
represent a minor influence over temperature,
meaningfully alter observed warming?

Condescending dismissal
People who would be asked to sacrifice wealth
to global-warming fear deserve a better answer to
that question than anyone so far has offered. What
they hear instead are mourning over the melting
of glaciers, meaningless assertions about a consensus of scientists, and stilted hints of doom from a
United Nations initiative riveted to climate models
with demonstrably limited powers of prediction.
Questions, in fact, encounter nothing more than
condescending dismissal, such as that delivered
by England’s Prince Charles, who recently called
skepticism about global warming alarm “sheer
madness.”
In the US, if presidential candidacy validly
indicates popular mood, intellectual bigotry of
that abysmal order has won the day. Come next
January, no veto will await legislation enacted in a
cost-blind panic. Even worse, the leading proposition of the moment is a bill that camouflages
economic consequences behind a “cap-and-trade”
smokescreen.
The US can’t cut emissions of CO2 without
reducing the combustion of hydrocarbons, which
means raising the cost of energy. There must never
be any confusion about this. The only political issue
that remains after the decision has been made to cut
CO2 emissions is the mechanism for the cost hike.

Politicians and business people favor the capand-trade mechanism—politicians because it
hides the costs and business people because it
creates opportunities to make money through the
trading of emissions allowances. But cap-and-trade
schemes in no way eliminate the costs, which
ultimately must be borne by taxpayers and energy
consumers.
The alternative is a tax on carbon. Because this
option promises no trading opportunities, business people dislike it. Politicians spurn the tax, too,
because it would make costs painfully clear to the
people who must pay them. That reason alone is
enough to make a carbon tax preferable.
Even in the cap-and-trade house of mirrors,
though, costs can be analyzed. Two cost estimates
recently emerged for the Climate Security Act
sponsored by Sens. Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn.)
and John Warner (R-Va.). One, by the National Association of Manufacturers and American Council
for Capital Formation, said the bill, which would

lower gross domestic product by $151-210 billion/year by 2020 and $631-669 billion/year by
2030. The reduction in average disposable household income would be $739-2,927/year in 2020
and $4,022-6,752/year by 2030.

Energy costs
The other estimate, by the Environmental
Protection Agency, sees reductions in GDP of
$238-983 billion in 2030 and $1.012-2.856 trillion in 2050. EPA notes that its analysis makes no
attempt to account for economic benefits associated with emissions cuts. In both studies, forced
emission cuts inevitably raise energy costs appreciably over projected baselines. Gasoline, for example, would be up 60-144% by 2030, according to
the NAM-ACCF study. EPA puts the gasoline price
increment attributable to the Lieberman-Warner
bill in that year at 53¢/gal. A public antagonized
by rising fuel prices should know what its government contemplates for it in this area.
Pampered royals to whom the word “cost” has
no meaning can afford to ignore warnings like
these. To everyone else, not heeding costs and not
addressing doubts about the likely effectiveness of
hasty warming remedies are truly what constitute
madness. ✦

Interest in Fischer-Tropsch (F-T)
chemistry and associated technologies such as gas-to-liquids (GTL) and
coal-to-liquids (CTL) continues to
grow worldwide. Within the last few
years one new world-scale unit came
on line, three others are in construction, and many more are planned,
while other approaches and synergies,
such as biomass-to-liquids (BTL) and
integrated coal gasificationcombined cycle (IGCC), are
under evaluation.
During this period, commercial products have been
tested, certified, shipped,
and used. However, concerns
such as CTL’s carbon dioxide
(CO2) manufacture have come to the
center stage. Technology development
and demonstration, economics of construction and operation, and regulatory directions in various jurisdictions
continue to be in flux. This article

reviews recent GTL and CTL activities
and discusses the likely directions and
commercial impact of this technology.

molecular-weight hydrocarbons, such
as naphtha, diesel, lube, and wax range
material.
The syngas stream, primarily carbon
monoxide (CO) and H2, can originate
from different sources, such as natural
gas methane partial-oxidation or steam
reforming, coal or coke gasification,
or the gasification of biomass (not
yet commercially demonstrated). The
source of the syngas affects F-T chemistry both in terms of potential impurities—such as sulfur and various metals
from coal-derived syngas—that need
removal and in terms of the syngas CO/
H2 composition.
Aside from the feed and its properties, F-T reactor product composition
depends on factors that include reactor
type and design and operating conditions such as temperature. One can
modulate the mix to produce primarily waxes or diesel, for example. Most
often, in low-temperature operation
much waxy and lube-range material is
produced, which is then mild-hydrocracked to high-quality diesel having
near-zero sulfur and a cetane number of
70-75.
Many variations can be considered
in terms of how the key elements are
combined and which products are
made. Fig. 2, for example, shows the
use of coal or other higher-carbon
sources as feedstock while potentially
generating power, CO2, or liquid hydrocarbons such as diesel, naphtha, lubes,
and waxes. In addition, aside from hydrocracking the lubes-wax stream, the
naphtha or light ends could be steamcracked to syngas and recycled back to
the F-T reactor to increase production
of high quality diesel.
References 1-3 give more detail on
the F-T chemistry and GTL-CTL processes, products, and qualities.

Background

Drivers and issues

A general arrangement diagram of
F-T-based processes is shown in Fig. 1.
Commercial F-T chemistry uses
cobalt or iron-based catalysts in fixed,
fluidized, or slurry-phase reactors to
convert synthesis gas (syngas) to large-

Many factors that originally aroused
interest in GTL and associated processes
during the past decade remain valid:
• A steady increase in global energy
demand. F-T-based processes along
with a number of other approaches are

overruns include the large amount of
engineering and construction

Product demonstrations
Although commercial GTL
units in South Africa and Malaysia and
CTL units in South Africa have been
operating for decades, their products’
utility and performance, including
emission characteristics, were further
demonstrated in several ways during
the past few years.
A number of fleet tests of GTL diesel
blends were or are being performed.
For example, in 2007 Chevron and
a northern California transit district
initiated 6-month-long test evaluations
involving 60 buses using GTL diesel
and biodiesel.27

Capacity, b/d

Last month Airbus A380 became the
first commercial aircraft to complete a
flight using GTL jet fuel blend. Parties
to the flight test included Shell, Qatar
Airways, and Rolls Royce, the engine
manufacturer.
There have been flashy demonstrations. Ten Audis used in the 2007 World
Economic Forum annual meeting at
Davos, Switzerland, were run on Shell
GTL fuel.32 33 In April to June 2006,
Sasol Chevron ran a 6,500-km “GTL

Coal-to-liquids
Lately, CTL has gained a relatively
high profile in the US—witness a 60
Minutes segment as well as multiple
New York Times editorials and articles—
as the country leads a small group of
countries with substantial proved
coal reserves, including Russia, China, India, and Australia (Fig.4).36-39
Within the US, coal reserves are
distributed in several states, including Montana and Wyoming in the
West, Illinois and West Virginia in
the Midwest and East, and Louisiana and Mississippi in the South.
The quality of the coal varies in
different US and global regions
with respect to water, sulfur, and
energy content, but based on current levels of usage—primarily in power
generation—it is expected to last two
to four times as long as world oil or gas
reserves (Table 1).
In the US, many stakeholders are
involved in improving the technology,
evaluating implementation feasibility,
and affecting policy. Parties include:
• Private industry, which includes
coal companies such as Peabody;
technology suppliers such as Chevron,
ConocoPhillips, Sasol, Rentech, Syntroleum, and GE; and industry advocacy groups such as the National Coal

These parties are joined by others
outside the US, such as GreenGen in
China, Coal21 in Australia, and the Asia
Pacific Partnership.

Meaningful progress
The advancement of F-T-based technologies over the past few years have
been measured but meaningful: one
commercial unit is on stream, and three
others are to start operating by the end
of the decade; products have been tested
and are used in commercial quantities;
and technical problems have been confronted and are being resolved.
Yet important issues remain: capital
cost, economics, and potential growth
in the near term and the environmental
impact of CO2emissions during CTL
production in the long term.

Nevertheless, excitement exists in
these areas fueled by higher global
energy demand and rising crude prices.
It is likely that, given all this, F-T-based
technologies will continue to improve
in commercial application and relevance, although they will remain a
modest component of the overall search
for clean, secure, and cost-effective
transportation fuels.

improved results from a year earlier.
ExxonMobil Corp. posted record 4Q07
and annual results.
For the recent quarter, net income
increased 14% to $11.66 billion.
ExxonMobil reported its production
increased nearly 1% from the fourth
quarter of 2006. Excluding the expropriation of assets in Venezuela, divestments, effects of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries’ quota,
and price and spend impacts on volumes, production was up nearly 3%.
For the year, ExxonMobil’s upstream
earnings were a record $26.5 billion,
up $267 million from 2006 due to
higher crude oil realizations and favorable sales mix effects, mostly offset by
higher operating expenses, net unfavorable tax items, and lower natural gas
realizations.
Marathon Oil Corp. reported reduced
earnings for the quarter and for 2007.
Net income slid 38% to $668 million
for 4Q07. Annual earnings declined
24% to $4 billion while revenues for
2007 were up only slightly to $65.2
billion.
Marathon’s downstream income was

$4 million in 4Q07 and $2 billion for
the year, compared to $533 million
and $2.8 billion in the same periods of
2006, down in both periods mostly as
a result of lower refining and wholesale
marketing gross margins.
The refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon was 4.8¢
in 4Q07, compared with 17.07¢ a year
earlier, and 18.48¢ for 2007, compared
with 22.88¢ for 2006.
“The fourth quarter of 2007 was
a difficult quarter that included lower
downstream margins driven primarily
by rapidly rising crude prices; relatively
flat upstream production due to delays
in the Alvheim (Norway) project and
unscheduled downtime for warranty
repairs at our Equatorial Guinea LNG
production facility, unscheduled downtime at our Athabasca oil sands project in
Canada, and higher exploration costs,”
said Clarence P. Cazalot Jr., Marathon
president and chief executive officer.

Reﬁners
Sunoco Inc., Tesoro Petroleum Corp.,
and Valero Energy Corp. posted mixed
results for the quarter and the year.

While each of these refiners reported
stronger revenues from the year-earlier
periods, they each saw their net income
drop. High crude prices and weak refining margins held earnings in check.
Valero reported 4Q07 income from
continuing operations of $567 million, compared with $1.1 billion in
the fourth quarter of 2006. Despite the
decline, recent results were better than
analyst expectations.
Analyst Eitan Bernstein with Friedman, Billings & Ramsey said that behind
Valero’s operating earnings were betterthan-expected refining margins, which
benefited from the company’s use of
lower-cost, lower-quality crude oils and
other discounted feedstocks.
Valero said its complex refineries
were able to take advantage of wide
sour crude discounts during 4Q07,
and it benefited from having a large,
geographically diverse refining system,
which provides relatively more earnings
stability through exposure to multiple
refining regions.

of oil and gas producers, refiners, and
transporters each recorded earnings
increases for the recent quarter. Meanwhile, results for the year were lower for
a few of the 11 companies in the group.
EnCana Corp. reported a 63% gain in
net income for 4Q07 and a 30% decline
in full-year 2007 earnings.
“With strong production growth and
successful price hedges that delivered a
$1 billion benefit to 2007 cash flow, our
company’s cash flow, operating earnings,
and free cash flow all increased substantially in a year when our industry faced
many challenges,” said Randy Eresman,
EnCana president and chief executive
officer. “In 2007, production from our
key natural gas resource plays grew 14%,
while production from our integrated oil
projects increased 25%. Our newly established refining business also delivered
great results, achieving twice the cash
flow we expected during its inaugural
year,” he said.
For the quarter and for 2007, Nexen
Inc. posted large increases in net income due to strong oil and gas production from Buzzard field in the North
Sea, robust commodity prices, and high
cash operating margins. Net income in
4Q07 grew 152%, and for the year, the
company’s earnings climbed 81%.
Nexen reported that although average benchmark West Texas Intermediate
prices for the year increased 9%, it grew
its cash netbacks per barrel by 32%.
Suncor Energy Inc. said that the
169% jump in its 4Q07 earnings primarily reflects higher oil sands operating revenues, as stronger price realiza34

Suncor’s earnings also benefited

US Senate votes to extend OCS, oil shale moratoria
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Senate voted Mar. 13 to
extend moratoria on federal oil and gas
leasing on most of the Outer Continental Shelf as well as on developing oil
shale resources.
The actions came on a pair of

amendments to the budget bill for fiscal
year 2009. Both proposed establishing
a deficit-neutral reserve fund to encourage consumers to buy more-efficient
wood stoves and install smart electricity
meters. Both supported carbon capture
and storage from coal. But they differed in their treatment of OCS leasing
expansion and oil shale resources in

Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming.
The first amendment, submitted
by Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), deleted
oil shale completely and limited OCS
oil and gas development to areas not
covered by congressional moratoria or
presidential withdrawals. It passed by
56 to 43 votes.
Nelson proposed his amendment to
head off one by Sen. LaMar Alexander
(R-Tenn.), which was defeated by 51
to 47 votes despite Alexander’s limiting
new federal OCS leasing to tracts off
Virginia. “That is the proverbial camel’s
nose under the tent and what we fight
about each year: oil drilling off the
coast,” the Floridian said.
Alexander responded that Nelson’s
approach would strike provisions
“which will tend to reduce the price of
gasoline and reduce the price of natural
gas and make us less dependent on
people in other countries who are trying to kill us.”
His oil shale provision would have
overturned a moratorium enacted as
part of the US Department of Interior’s
fiscal 2008 budget in December as part
of the omnibus budget bill. This moratorium delays a program authorized
under the 2005 Energy Policy Act.
Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-NM), the
Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s ranking minority member, said the
oil shale program delay was “somebody
in one of those states putting a moratorium on in appropriations with nobody
around.” He said, “This senator wasn’t
there. If I were there, it would not have
happened. We would not have had a
bill.”
But Sen. Ken Salazar (D-Colo.) said
the Alexander amendment overturning the oil shale moratorium should be
defeated. “We have a thoughtful way to
move forward with that program. This
is putting the horse ahead of the cart.
This is the wrong way to go,” Salazar
said.
In a statement after the Senate recessed for the day, Salazar said the US
Bureau of Land Management “is rushing toward a commercial lease sale and

leasing moratorium for about 30
years to keep oil and gas activity away
from their shores. Colorado now
seems willing to use it onshore.
Democrats in the state’s congressional delegation inserted a provision
into the fiscal 2008 budget reconciliation act in December which suspends federal oil shale leasing for a
year. The US Senate voted to extend
the delay through fiscal 2009.
Meanwhile, Assistant US Interior
Sec. C. Stephen Allred told Colorado
Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. that the Bureau of
Land Management is incorporating
concepts Ritter proposed in December into its management plan for the
Roan Plateau on the state’s Western
Slope.
This includes placing 38,470
acres, or more than half the federal
acreage on the plateau, off-limits to
surface disturbance and scheduling
development in phases to assure that
no more than 1% of the remaining
federal land’s surface would be disturbed at any one time.

NPRA: Valero looking to sell three reﬁneries
David N. Nakamura
Refining/Petrochemical Editor
Valero Energy Corp. is conducting a
“strategic alternative review” of three
of its refineries in an effort to possibly
sell them, according to Chief Executive
Officer Bill Klesse.
Speaking Mar. 11 at the National
Petrochemical & Refiners Association
annual meeting in San Diego, Klesse
said that given Valero’s entire refining portfolio, it does not make sense
to invest in every plant. “Some of our
plants are clearly worth more to others
and it is a real opportunity to some
other companies. The Lima refinery [in
Ohio], which we sold last year, was a
good fit for Husky [Energy Inc.] (OGJ,

May 14, 2007, Newsletter).
“Today, we are looking at strategic
alternatives...at Aruba, Memphis, Tenn.,
and Krotz Springs, La. We’ve elected not
to invest further in those refineries,”
Klesse said, adding, “We expect to complete this strategic alternative review by
the end of the year.”
Klesse said Valero would still be
interested in acquisitions, but that the
company does not necessarily need to
make any. Valero is focusing its capital
investment on its existing refineries.
“We have two very large projects
that we’ve announced on the US Gulf
Coast,” he said. “Our capital spending
this year should be somewhere between
$4 and 4.5 billion. I would expect next
year’s to be in the $5 billion range.”

Prices, taxes
Klesse also outlined Valero’s positions
on future gasoline trends in the US as
well as tax issues.
He said gasoline demand may increase in the US this year, but probably
will be flat and maybe even more likely
decrease. “The high retail prices and
the weak economy are having a very
negative impact on demand,” he said.
“Our view is that crude oil prices are
going to stay high. The world economy
has shown that it can handle these high
prices.”
Regarding the renewable fuel standard, Klesse says an ethanol mandate,
tax credit, and import duty are not all
needed. “The ethanol program and
other programs like it are just a huge

transfer of wealth from [the refining]
industry to the Midwest farmer,” he
said. “Since we have a mandate, let’s at
least eliminate the excise tax credit on
ethanol. This is pork-barrel legislation at
its worst.”
Klesse said the US gasoline supply
will likely contain 10-15% ethanol in
the next few years. He noted, however,
that ethanol volumes above this level are

T E R E S T
“totally impractical, totally uneconomical, and just crazy.”
Due to the RFS mandate and CAFE
standards, Klesse believes that “to
maintain the US gasoline producing
capability, our industry may need our
government to increase import duties
on gasoline and blendstock to protect
the [refining] industry and prevent the

dumping of gasoline in the US market.”
Klesse also said Valero “would support an increase in the federal excise
tax on transportation fuels combined
with the elimination of the ethanol tax
credit, which is not needed because
we have the mandate.” He said, “This
would generate significant funds [to
improve road infrastructure and eliminate bottlenecks].” ✦

Gulf lease sales attract $3.7 billion in high bids
Two federal sales of offshore oil and
natural gas leases in the eastern and
central planning areas of the Gulf of
Mexico have attracted a total of more
than $3.7 billion in apparent high bids.
Central Gulf Lease Sale 206 and Eastern
Gulf Lease Sale 224, both conducted
by the US Department of the Interior’s
Minerals Management Service, were
held back-to-back Mar. 19 in New
Orleans.
Central Lease Sale 206, held first,
attracted $3,677,688,245 in apparent high bids, setting a record in US

leasing history for high bids since
area-wide leasing began in 1983, MMS
reported. In Sale 206 the agency received 1,057 bids from 85 companies
on 615 tracts.
For Eastern Lease Sale 224, held
second, MMS received 58 bids from
6 companies on 36 tracts resulting in
$64,713,213 in apparent high bids.
“Today’s lease sales mark an important milestone in sharing substantially
increased revenue from offshore oil
and gas development with states willing to support it,” said Interior Sec. Dirk

partial blocks in the eastern planning
area. These four gulf producing states
also will share in 37.5% of all future
revenues generated from the acreage
leased today in the gulf’s eastern planning area.
The enhanced revenue-sharing program was mandated by GMESA 2006,
and no royalty relief will be issued with
these leases.
With Central Sale 206, the royalty
rate for blocks in all gulf water depths
is increased to 183⁄4% from 162⁄3%, MMS
said.
In addition, 12.5% of revenues from
today’s lease sales will be deposited
into the Land and Water Conservation Fund for use by states to enhance
parklands and for other conservation
projects.
Eastern Sale 224 is the only sale
scheduled to be held in the eastern
gulf under the current 5-Year Outer
Continental Shelf oil and gas leasing
program. The acreage included in this
latest eastern sale was last available for
lease in 1988.
Currently there are more than 7,000
leases in the gulf that account for 25%
of the nation’s domestically produced
oil and 15% of the domestically produced natural gas.

and gas industry. After all, how much
can be said about a country that produces no oil of its own and consumes
just 278,000 b/d?
Well, much has recently been said
about Switzerland’s involvement in
the petroleum industry. Consider US
concerns about an agreement signed
on Mar. 17 between Switzerland’s
Elektrizitaets-Gesellschaft Laufenburg
and National Iranian Gas Export Co.
“We have conveyed to the Swiss
that major new oil and gas deals with
Iran send precisely the wrong message at a time when Iran continues
to defy UN Security Council resolutions,” the US embassy in Bern said
in a statement.
The US embassy said it believes
the deal “violates the spirit of the
sanctions” imposed on Iran by the
UN Security Council as part of an effort to try to force Iran to give up its
program of uranium enrichment and
cooperate further with the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline
Calmy-Rey, who attended the signing
ceremony between EGL and NIGEC,
agreed with that assessment, saying
the agreement did not violate UN
sanctions and served only to secure
uninterrupted energy supplies for
Switzerland.

Strategic interests

“We have a strategic interest to secure our gas supplies and diversify our
gas suppliers,” Calmy-Rey said. She
said the agreement may even reduce
Europe’s dependency on energy supplies from Russia. “We are decreasing
our dependence, and the dependence
of Europe, on Russian gas.”
The duration of EGL’s natural gas
procurement contract with NIGEC is
25 years. The contracted gas quantities
will allow EGL to cover its 50% share
of transportation capacity of the Trans
Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), which it will
build with Norway’s StatoilHydro ASA

An Upper Devonian shale gas play,
emerging the past 2-3 years in remote
northern Northeast British Columbia,
has the potential to become one of
North America’s larger gas fields.
The play is for gas in the Muskwa
shale in the Horn River basin 775 miles
northwest of Calgary.
EOG Resources Inc., Houston, with
140,000 acres in the play, estimates 70
tcf of gas in place
in the shale of
which a net 6 tcf
seems recoverable. Gas in place
in the Muskwa
on EOG lands averages 318 bcf/
sq mile, 2.5 times that of the Barnett
shale in Johnson County, Tex., in the
Fort Worth basin south of Fort Worth.
EnCana Corp. and Apache Corp.
hold a combined 400,000 acres in the
play in a 50-50 area of mutual interest.
Other independents have smaller leaseholds, and the total area under lease is
estimated at 600,000-700,000 acres.
EOG said its land is in the richest
gas-in-place portion of the play, where
the Muskwa is half again as thick as its
thickest Johnson County Barnett shale.

The play is sparsely drilled so far, so
much so that Apache told analysts it is
still determining whether it is commercial. If commercial, it would expose
Apache to 3-6 tcf of net recovery.
EOG said it expects Muskwa to develop more slowly than the Barnett.
The company estimated that industry will have drilled a total of 17-21
horizontal wells in the play by the end
of 2008. EnCana-Apache will drill nine
horizontal wells and EOG two vertical
and four to eight horizontal wells this
year.

Formations compared
The Muskwa shale, which lies at
about the same depth as the Barnett, is
thicker and has higher pressure than the
Barnett in the Northeast BC area south
of Fort Liard, NWT, EOG said.
Muskwa is geologically less complex than the Barnett, with equivalent
permeability of 230 nanodarcies,
equivalent 4% gas-filled porosity, 2.8%
vitrinite reflectance, better silica content
at 65%, and no water.
The Muskwa has continuous gas
thicknesses in the upper and lower parts
of the formation, which will smooth
completions. EOG has a large proprietary data base
of core, log, and
microseismic data
from area wells
that were drilled
through the formation.
The Muskwa
has limited faulting, and the
carbonate that
underlies it has
no sinkholes, EOG
added.

Barnett grew from

Early drilling
Two large gas pipelines flank the
Muskwa play.
EOG plans to begin production
in June 2008 from its first two wells
through a 15-km gathering line to a 24
MMcfd conditioning plant and doesn’t
see important contributions of production until 2010-11.
Apache, which has referred to the
shale as “Ootla,” plans to experiment
with different multistage fracs this year
to enhance flow rates.
EOG’s first vertical Muskwa well, in
2006, made 750 Mcfd after a two-stage
frac.
Its first horizontal well in 2007 tested 5 MMcfd after a six-stage completion in 3,000 ft of mostly off-azimuth
(to formation fractures) lateral. Reservoir simulation of that well indicated
ultimate recovery of 4-6 bcf/well if the

York state by Jan. 16, 2009.
Gastem will earn a 65% working interest in all 29,000 acres of leases held
by Utica Energy and in other leases that
may be obtained during the year.
Drilling is to start in the second
quarter subject to permitting and other
approvals. The companies declined to
identify the location more precisely.
Gastem’s program will target gas
in the Upper Ordovician Utica shale

formation, already the object of exploration on Gastem’s Yamaska property
west of Drummondville, Que., in the St.
Lawrence lowlands.
Utica Energy drilled, completed, and
ran frac jobs on two test wells on its
acreage in mid-2007. Other intervals
identified during logging, notably the
Devonian Marcellus shale, will also be
tested for gas potential. The acreage is
near gas pipelines.

But with high flow of heavy and viscous
oil in a long stepout, gas lift becomes
inefficient and ESPs provide the best
artificial lift option.
The ESP in JUB-6 started operating in April 2007, 17 months after its
November 2005 installation.
Reliability is a main concern with
ESPs and, therefore, the system has to
be properly selected for the particular
application.
This

describes
the selected ESP system for JUB-6. The

The extended well test proved the
economics of the field and Petrobras
started Phase 1 development that includes four wells producing to the P-34
FPSO.
JUB-6 produces through 7-in. tubing, 26 lb/ft, ID 6.276 in (Fig. 1). The
string is carbon steel except for the
downhole safety valve (9% Cr) and
the pup joint, crossover, and adjustable
union above the safety value (13% Cr).
The well has a long horizontal, about
1,000 m, that creates a high productivity index and is openhole gravel packed
for sand control.
The tubing string has gas lift mandrels for backup artificial lift if the ESP
fails.
Water depth is about 1,400 m at
Jubarte.
The well has 135⁄8-in. casing to about
2,480 m. The kick-off point is at about
2,175 m from the surface.
The ESP, installed at 0° from vertical,
is encapsulated in a 103⁄4-in. flush joint
capsule. The well has 95⁄8-in. liner from
2,480 m to 3,130 m. At this point, the
well is already in the reservoir.
The 81⁄2-in hole in the reservoir was
drilled horizontally to about 1,000 m.
The completion has a 7-in. gravel pack.
Above the gravel-pack packer, the
well has a nonreturning valve (NRV).
This valve prevents brine being injected
into the reservoir during well-intervention work. The NRV is closed, isolating
the reservoir, if the fluid weight above
the NRV is greater than the reservoir
pressure. The closed valve allows fluid
to circulate through an orifice above the
NRV with minimal or no loss of fluid to
the reservoir. The orifice at the bottom
of the string is in a gas lift mandrel.
The NRV is incorporated in the bottom string and is not pulled during
intervention.
A tubing-string receptacle installed
at about 2,385 m completes the lower
string that has a gravel-pack assembly.
The pressure and temperature gauge
sensor (PDG), manufactured by ProductionQuest, is set as close as possible
to the reservoir for accurate reservoir

tion. These cracks seem to propagate
quite fast due to severe working conditions and operations, i.e., high string
deflection, drilling in dogleg areas, high
torque, high rotation, etc.
The inspection did not reveal the
propagated minute cracks. It was difficult to confirm whether these cracks
initiated before or after the last conducted inspection. This requires us to
establish the crack propagation rate and
some calculations.
2. Several propagated fatigue cracks

when high load or torque (remaining
sound material can no longer carry
the applied load) was exerted during
the drilling operation. The jar failure
mechanism depends on the toughness
of the jar materials (KIC). It seems that
torque exerted during drilling (14,000
lb) was high enough, and in presence
of small isolated fatigue cracks, to lead
these minute cracks to propagate quickly, resulting in overload and catastrophic
rupture of the jar.
The nondestructive test techniques
and procedures used, such as MPI, do
not seem to detect small fatigue cracks
in the jar threads. As previously mentioned, the observed fatigue marks
(ratchet marks) extended over small
and isolated areas on the jar fracture
surface. In addition, some of the examined fatigue cracks showed a tiny

initiation point or site, indicating that
only small part of the crack will be apparent (external surface) and the rest
will propagate through the jar’s cross
section.
Based on these findings, we suggested that the company change the
inspection procedure and technique to
avoid any misinterpretation during the
inspection process.

Jar determination
We can summarize the lessons
learned from the failed drilling jar:
1. The drilling jar failed catastrophically due to high torque during drilling
operations. The fatigue cracks initiated
at the jar threads and those initiated
from corrosion pits reduced the loadbearing capability (reduced the crosssectional area) and therefore assisted in
the jar’s premature failure.
2. Observed fatigue cracks seem
to propagate over a short time. Rough
fatigue marks were visible on the examined fracture surface, which indicates
that high load or torque was applied to
the drilling string.
3. Jar connectors (threads) on the
external surface and corrosion pits on
the internal surface acted as “stress raisers” where the fatigue cracks initiated.
4. Using MPI on the threaded
components is sometimes insufficient
to detect the fine fatigue cracks. The
inspector should consult nondestructive testing experts regarding conducting additional testing techniques for

thread inspections.
5. The proper torque needs to be applied when the joint is made up (make
up torque).
6. Drillers need to be aware of the
limits for applied torque, weight on bit,
and rotation (rpm) while drilling in
the dogleg zone and at high inclination
to avoid buckling. Drilling outside of
recommended limits endangers the integrity of the drilling tools and reduces
markedly the working life.

Case study 2: drilling stabilizer
We received a sample from a failed
123⁄16-in. ID drilling string stabilizer.
We were asked to conduct a detailed
metallurgical investigation and to establish the main cause of string stabilizer
failure. The failure report included stabilizer dimensions, material, stabilizer
number, last inspection date, and the
geoservices logging chart.
We conducted visual and microscopic examinations on the fracture surface
of the failed part (extracted piece) after
the pieces were cleaned with special
chemicals and brushes.
Examination confirmed that the
string stabilizer failed predominantly in
a brittle manner. The fracture is partly
planar and covers about 70% of the
total fracture surface. The rest of the
fracture was inclined 45º, which is a
ductile rupture.
Shear leaps, twisting, and washout
were all visible on the collar sample.

drilling-fluid pressure leakage (pressure

followed by the complete failure (separation) of the stabilizer.
The flat fracture of the stabilizer was
due to initiation of multiple fatigue
cracks at the thread roots of the last
four threads. These cracks extended
or propagated throughout the stabilizer wall thickness during service
wall thickness during services such as
drilling at a high rotation rate, drilling
through a dog-leg; high loading on the
bit, buckling and vibration when drilling hard rock zones, etc.
The rate of crack growth or propagation depends on the material fracture
toughness and applied load. The applied
load, due to stressed threads, should be
below the fatigue endurance limit for
the stabilizer material.
Visual examination. We scrutinized
the fracture surface and threads of the
failed string stabilizer. The fracture
surface was partly flat, typical of brittle
failure, and partly inclined by 45º, typical of shear or ductile failure.
Washout was visible on the failed
stabilizer. This may have occurred due to
leaking high-pressure drilling fluid before failure. The geoservice chart, which
reported a pressure drop of 150 psi
before the final failure, confirmed this.
Over the flat area of the fracture surface, noncontinuous beach marks typical of fatigue failure originated from
the thread root. These beach marks
appear to have originated from multiple
initiation sites at the thread root (81⁄2-in.
OD female box), where high residual
stresses are attained. The beach marks
were found across 70% of the total fracture surface of the failed stabilizer. The
remaining 30% were inclined, however,
typical of ductile failure.
In some areas, beach marks appeared
rough, indicating that the stabilizer was
subjected to high stresses (bending
stresses and vibration) or to high load
rate. Recent geoservice data just before
failure show high applied torque (up
to13,800 ft-lb), which exceeds the allowable or recommended value.

Shear lip, indicating the final fracture
due to overload failure, was visible on
various areas on the fracture surface,
such as the external side (outer rim)
of the stabilizer as well as the inclined
surface. Shear lips over a thin area along
the rim of the stabilizer confirms the
difficulties in detecting the fatigue crack
from the external surface even when a
wet fluorescent magnetic particle was
used.
Microscopic examination. We examined the failed part of the stabilizer in
a low-magnification stereomicroscope.
This confirmed that the stabilizer failed
due to the initiation of multiple fatigue
cracks at the thread root (Fig. 6).
Generally, thread roots attain
maximum residual stresses, which

Hardness. Measured hardness of the

string stabilizer met the required specification.

Failure mechanism

Failure of the string stabilizer is
mainly due to the fatigue failure that
initiated from the most weak and
stressed area of the stabilizer (threads
of 81⁄8-in. OD female box). The fatigue
crack initiated during drilling operations, i.e., drilling in the dogleg area,
string buckling, string bending, etc.
High load on pit, high torque, or
service load (abnormal load) all initiate
fatigue microcracks at the thread roots
(a0). Initiated cracks grow during drilling operations until they reach a critical
size (ac), at which catastrophic failure
of the string stabilizer is imminent.
Fatigue cracks in this case were mainly
flat; others were inclined 45º as a result
of overload.
Generally, development of a fatigue
crack can be divided into two main
steps:
1. Incubation and initiation of microscopic cracks. Detection of the flaw
is impossible due the minute size of the
crack.

Preventing black powder contamination from
damaging a gas pipeline’s
metering system requires
regular dismantling and
cleaning of its metering
Pipelines
instruments, manifolds,
impulse lines, and associated facilities. Determining which
cleaning method to apply, however,
requires
gathering
comprehensive
information about
the nature
of the
black powder problem. Only then can
the operator determine which technique will provide the most efficient
and cost-effective method of removing
black powder from gas installations.

Background

Solid contaminants—known as black
powder—found in natural gas transmission and distribution systems are
a cause of increasing concern in the
global natural gas industry. Chemical or
biological reactions with steel found in
natural gas pipelines, gas wells, and associated facilities can create black powder. Operators can detect black powder
in both dry and wet gas pipelines and
in conjunction with other contaminants
such as oil, grease, liquid hydrocarbons,
and sand.1
Black powder influences the flow
performance of gas pipelines and can
also impair the function of valves and
measurement systems, requiring the
development of specific inspection and
cleaning methods.2

devices, clogging of instrumentation,
and increased deterioration of valves
due to erosion.
The greatest accumulation of black
powder lay in the first segment of the
network, immediately downstream of
the Bulgarian-Greek border, but large
flow migration of the powder was
documented through the mainline to
various downstream lateral lines and
customer delivery points.
Filtering at the entrance of processing plants or networks is the most common method of fighting contaminants.
Black powder particulates, however,
can shear easily to submicron sizes and
pass through gas separation devices
and filters, making filter-based control
difficult.
Two vertical cartridge filters at the
inlet of the Sidirokastro border metering station served as the primary
facilities to remove black powder from
Greece’s gas stream. These filters separated 100% of particles larger that 3
μm, and 99% of particles 0.5-3 μm.
Black powder deposits continued to
appear downstream, however, despite
nearly continuous cleaning of these
filters’ cartridges. Other network gas
filtration devices clogged regularly and
had to be replaced. The extra maintenance load on the new transmission
system increased greatly workman
hours, creating higher costs.
The network operator installed two
cyclone (centrifugal) filtration facilities with 99% separation efficiency for
contaminants larger than 5 μm at the
entry point for Russian natural gas to
further protect the downstream system.
Operation of these cyclone separators
efficiently removed the black powder.
The operator also pigged the contaminated pipelines and purged specific
sections. Black powder had heavily
contaminated all vented gas. Literature
provides an extensive description of
both the harm caused by black powder
in gas pipelines and the experience

Despite these efforts, however, small
particles continued
to flow through
filtration devices,
agglomerating to
larger sizes downstream. Traces of
black powder appeared in metering
lines, fiscal metering instruments,
analysers, density
meters, and control valves.

Black powder has almost completely blocked this pressure transmitter (Fig. 5).

Laboratory analysis
Samples taken from the debris of
pigging operations or from filters’
deposits provided material for analysis
of the powder’s chemical composition
and particle-size distribution (OGJ, Mar.
12, 2007, p. 52). Black powder consists
mainly of magnetite (iron oxide), a
form of rust, and is highly magnetic. All
other compounds found through laboratory analysis exist in common dirt.
The powder contains practically no iron

sulfide or other sulfur compounds.
The amorphous nature of the powder caused variance in particle-size
analysis with both large particles and
submicron flakes detected, though a
dominant peak appeared at about 30
μm. Large particles stayed in filters
and dropout vessels, while the smaller
ones carried downstream and tended
to agglomerate due to their magnetic
properties (OGJ, Mar. 12, 2007, p. 52).
The black powder examined in this

Small particles flowed through
filtration devices despite continuous
operation of cyclone and cartridge
filters, prompting an investigation as
to whether black powder had entered
fiscal metering instrumentation and associated installations. DESFA examined
all instruments and installations at its
Sidirokastro border metering station
(BMS).
• Orifice plates. Pressure differential
devices (orifice plates) measure the gas
quantity at BMS. An investigation uncovered heavy black powder deposits on
the upstream face of orifice plates. The
left side of Fig. 2 shows an orifice plate
covered by a thick layer of black powder. This layer consists of black powder
together with oil or grease, which gives
the mixture adhesive properties. The
right side of Fig. 2 shows a clean plate.
The operator removed the dirty orifice
plate from a metering line after about 1
month of operation. Both the upstream
and downstream faces of the removed
orifice plate showed black powder
deposits.
• Metering lines. Black powder contaminated the inner metering lines,
potentially affecting their roughness.
Contamination may decrease pipe
roughness by filling the relatively
rougher underground to a smoother
surface. Altering inner pipe roughness
upstream of the orifice plate affects the
discharge coefficient, Cd (ISO 5167),
increasing the uncertainty of gas measurement5 by altering the shape of the
flow profile. The unpredictable nature of
this effect with time makes retroactive
corrections difficult to apply.

RECOVERY METHODS

™

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs once considered economically and
technically impossible. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy.
But they’re still unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing
wells in them are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems.
Producing gas from unconventional reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the
market requires continuous rethinking – the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible
with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 – Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by editors
of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight innovation
from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and learn from other
professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.
So mark your calendar.

sitometer’s inlet pressure filters (Fig. 6,
right). Black powder also contaminated
the densitometer’s low-pressure internal
filters, passing on to its sensitive vibrating cylinders. The operator sent the
instruments to the manufacturer’s laboratories for maintenance. The manufacturer confirmed that the densitometers’
sensors were contaminated with black
powder.

Corrective actions
Preventing damage to metering instruments required inspection for black
powder as part of monthly inspection
and calibration of fiscal instruments.
These inspections repeated the findings
discussed in this article; a large amount
of black powder existing in instruments of all metering lines, creating
the danger that impulse lines would be
plugged by contaminants.
BMS operators applied a regular
cleaning program to avoid abnormal operation of the instruments and
reduce possible errors in gas measurement, cleaning all transmitters similar
to that shown in Fig. 5 by blowing
compressed air and the transmitters’
diaphragms with acetone solution.
Operators also began thoroughly
cleaning all manifolds and impulse
lines as part of the monthly calibration
process, purging impulse lines with
air and nitrogen. A special air tool also
pushed pellets of cylindrical sponge
into the tubes of impulse lines (Fig. 7).
The white pellets turned black after just
one pass through an impulse line.
The air driven pellet launcher can
also remove contaminants from hoses,
tubes, or pipes.

Data sheet discusses underwater pig and test units
A subsea pigging unit (SPU) and subsea
hydrostatic testing unit (SHU) are discussed in a new data sheet, yours free for
the asking.
The SPU has the capability to filter and
chemically treat flooding water while
continuously regulating and monitoring the flooding and pigging operation
autonomously and without the need for
umbilicals or constant attendance by a
support vessel.
The SHU allows hydrostatic testing
operations to be completed entirely on the
seabed, moving the risks posed by high
pressure fluids to a location far removed
from personnel.

EPA, Congress
share blame for
high fuel prices
Congressional oil-price inquisitions
target the wrong people. Government ofﬁcials, not oil-company executives, should
have to answer for zooming prices.
As Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.)
on Mar. 12 announced a new grilling of oil
executives, the Environmental Protection
Agency was raising the costs of gasoline
manufacture.
Markey has summoned chief executives

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

of the ﬁve largest major oil companies to
an Apr. 1 hearing of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global
Warming, which he chairs. He’ll try to make
them look responsible for painful gasoline
prices.
EPA, meanwhile, has toughened federal
air-quality standards for ozone in a move
that will squeeze fuel consumers far more
than anything oil executives can do.
By lowering the 8-hr ozone standard to
0.075 ppm from 0.08 ppm, EPA will push
new areas of the US into noncompliance.
This will happen as new mandates for
renewable fuels, enacted by Congress last
December, take effect. Those mandates aggravate ozone pollution. Biodiesel increases
emissions of nitrogen oxides. Ethanol puts
volatile organic compounds into the air. In
sunlight, those compounds form ozone.
So EPA is raising an ozone standard
that Congress, by lifting renewable-fuel
standards, is making increasingly difﬁcult
to achieve.
The problem will be most severe when
summertime volatility limits take effect for
gasoline. Areas newly out of compliance
with air-quality standards because of the
new ozone standard will lower gasoline
volatility limits or require reformulated
gasoline, which doesn’t qualify for volatility
waivers available to conventional fuel.
To accommodate growing volumes of
high-volatility ethanol, reﬁners will have
to reject growing volumes of light gasoline components. This will lower supply as
demand rises at the start of driving season,
further lifting the costs of making gasoline
and raising prices at retail.
EPA says new scientiﬁc evidence about
health effects forced it to toughen the
ozone standard. That evidence is controversial. And continuing improvement in ozone
pollution under the existing standard casts
doubt on the need to act and wisdom of doing so while gasoline prices are high.
EPA can’t worry about gasoline prices,
though. It can’t by law-a law written by
blame-dodgers like Markey.

Measuring ‘extreme’ oil prices
For seven sessions Mar. 5-13, the front-month crude contract consecutively set record high prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange as the US dollar fell to record
lows vs. the euro and a 12-year low against the Japanese yen.
Crude climbed to an intraday high of $111/bbl Mar. 13 prior to a record $110.33/bbl
closing as the weak dollar prompted investors and speculators to put their money
into commodities like oil and gold, which for the ﬁrst time hit $1,000/oz.
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist for Deutsche Bank in New York, and
Michael Lewis, the bank’s head of global commodities research in London, issued a
report Mar. 14 outlining several measures to examine how far oil prices would need
to rise to represent extreme levels of valuation. “Although oil demand side fundamentals are deteriorating, we expect the oil price will be captivated by a collapsing
US dollar, a relationship we hold with deep suspicion. A further 4% decline in the US
dollar index would imply oil prices hitting $120/bbl,” Sieminski said.
Although crude is at an all-time high in nominal terms, oil prices would have to
hit $118/bbl to exceed earlier records in real terms “deﬂated by US consumer prices,”
Sieminski said.
Relative to per capita income, crude would have to reach $134/bbl to bring the
purchasing power of “an average G7 consumer” from the group of seven industrialized nations—Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, and US—to 1981 levels.
“In 1970, back in the days of cheap oil and prior to the 1973 and 1979 oil crises, oil
prices were trading at around $3.50/bbl. At the same time the average G7 per capita
income was around $3,400 and consequently sufﬁcient to buy just over 1,000 bbl
of oil each year,” the report said. “Following the two surges in oil prices, purchasing
power of an average G7 consumer deteriorated rapidly such that by 1981 an average
G7 consumer was only able to buy 318 bbl of oil.”
In this decade, the purchasing power of an average G7 consumer has deteriorated as oil prices climbed faster than incomes. “However, the oil price would
need to average $134/bbl in 2008 to reduce the purchasing power of an average G7
consumer such that he or she would be able to buy just 318 bbl, or a similar level of
purchasing power as prevailed in 1981. As a result, on this measure oil prices are not
yet at extreme levels,” the report concluded.
“West Texas Intermediate prices would have to rise to $150/bbl for oil as a percent
of global gross domestic product to hit the all-time high that prevailed in 1980,” the
report said. “Crude prices would need to hit $145/bbl to raise energy expenditures as
a percent of US disposable income to early 1980s levels.”
Ethanol outlook
In a separate report, Sieminski said, “We believe population growth, rising incomes, and increased ethanol production will lead to a doubling in grains demand
by 2050.” But the major benefactor of that market will be Brazil and probably would
require further encroachment on its rain forests. Brazil, Sieminski said, “is the only
country in the world that combines 20% of the world’s unused arable land, weather
patterns which allow two annual harvests, political stability, and close proximity to
US markets.”
A broad-based market rally has boosted the nominal prices for soft grains—corn,
wheat, rice, and soybeans—to record high levels. “However, in real terms prices are
still signiﬁcantly below the highs reached in the early 1970s,” Sieminski said.
He said, “The US government has made a key strategic decision to increase the
relevance of ethanol in its energy matrix over the next decade. We forecast that
global soft grain demand for ethanol production should reach approximately 350
million tonnes by 2010 and 675 million tonnes by 2030. These ﬁgures are based on
our calculations that US ethanol consumption will reach 13 billion gal by 2010 and 24
billion gal by 2030.” Sieminski added, “We estimate that 26% of total growth in soft
grains consumption between 2005 and 2050 will be driven by ethanol.”
Sieminski said, “We believe that there is plenty of unused arable land available
for agricultural purposes. We ﬁnd that the world has approximately 4 billion hectares
of potential arable land, of which 1.6 billion hectares was being used in 2005. If we
factor in the increase in global soft grain demand coupled with stable crop yields going forward—an aggressive assumption as yields are likely to continue to rise—the
amount of available arable land could decrease to just 600 million hectares by 2050.”

TIRED AT THE END OF THE DAY? CONGRATS.
YOU’VE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING.
You don’t shy away from hard work; you know
it’s a critical ingredient to success. But your
dedication and experience should count for
something. At Marathon, they do. In fact,
we've built the fourth largest U.S. based integrated oil and gas
company on those ideals, plus honesty and integrity. Another thing
that sets us apart is that we want to help you succeed—and with
opportunities in the U.S. and abroad, there’s plenty of room for you
to shine. And because we’re a fully integrated oil and gas company,
we even have a stable launch pad waiting for you. Your hard work
should get you somewhere, right? After all, it’s your Marathon.

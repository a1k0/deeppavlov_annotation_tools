COVER
The rig is drilling a Marcellus shale well in north-central Pennsylvania. Marcellus shale is one of the more active US unconventional
gas plays.The well is on an Anadarko Petroleum Corp. lease, and
Precision Drilling Oilfield Services Corp. owns the rig. Although US
rig counts are down from a year ago, the count has begun an upward
trend, as discussed in OGJ’s Drilling Report special, starting on p.
39. Photo from Anadarko.

CERI updates oil sands production, cost outlook
The realistic scenario in the latest Canadian Energy Research
Institute outlook expects Alberta oil sand production to increase
to 1.7 million b/d by 2015, 2.5 million b/d by 2020, 4.5 million
b/d by 2030 before reaching a peak of 5.3 million b/d in 2041. Oil
sand production was 1.3 million b/d in 2008.
The scenario assumes crude oil demand starting to increase in
2010 as the world recession ends and crude prices reaching $200/
bbl for West Texas Intermediate in 2043.
CERI’s outlook notes that during the past year oil sands projects
have seen construction costs decline by 15% and operating costs
decline by 13%.
It estimates that oil sands projects will have a rate of return of
23% for steam-assisted gravity drainage, 11% for mining and upgrading, and 18% for mining without upgrading. Total capital required during its 35-year realistic scenario period is $309 billion.
CERI points out, assuming no technology changes, that by
2043 oil sands natural gas requirements will be three to four times
more than current levels, leading to US gas exports into Canada.
In addition, greenhouse gas compliance may cost the industry
$130 billion during the next 35 years, CERI says.

API issues new hydraulic fracturing guidelines
The American Petroleum Institute published a new guidance
document outlining industry best-practices for properly drilling
and cementing wells that are being hydraulically fractured.
The well construction and integrity guideline is designed to
ensure that shallow groundwater aquifers and the environment
are protected through a well’s drilling, completion, and production phases, API said on Nov. 2. It was the second of four documents that API’s standards and practices department has been
developing to address hydraulic fracing’s increasing role in US
energy options.
API published a guidance document on hydraulic fracing environmental and reclamation practices in August, it noted. The final
two documents that are being developed will address cradle-tograve water-handling practices and surface environmental considerations.
The newest guidance document is intended to provide producers and state regulators a framework for well construction that will
supplement state regulations already in place or being developed,
API said. The trade association has published industry standards

since the 1920s and continually updates them to provide guidance
and highlight industry-recommended best practices on a number
of topics, it pointed out.
More than 1 million wells have been drilled in the US using
hydraulic fracing over the past 60 years, according to API. As geographical formations being drilled become more complicated, hydraulic fracing will be used even more, especially for natural gas, it
said, citing a 2006 government-industry report that found 60-80%
of gas wells drilled in the next decade will require the technology.
“Natural gas has the potential to serve as an important bridge
to our nation’s energy future, but we need hydraulic fracturing to
develop this gas,” said Doug Morris, API upstream director. “Hydraulic fracturing is a safe and proven technology that is critical to
developing the natural gas needed to heat homes, generate electricity, and create basic materials for fertilizers and plastics. This
guidance document helps supplement and support existing state
regulations to ensure that development of our nation’s abundant
natural gas resources is safe and effective.”

Chesapeake decides not to drill in NYC watershed
Chesapeake Energy Corp. does not plan to drill natural gas
wells within the New York City watershed.
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake’s chief executive officer,
said, “…it has become increasingly clear to us over the past few
months that the concern for drilling in the watershed has become
a needless distraction from the larger issues of how we can safely
and effectively develop the natural gas reserves that underlie various counties in the Southern Tier of New York.”
Chesapeake is the only leaseholder in the New York City watershed, holding fewer than 5,000 acres there. “This leasehold is
immaterial to Chesapeake and also does not appear prospective for
the Marcellus shale,” McClendon said.
Chesapeake notes that it is the largest leaseholder in the Marcellus shale play, with 1.5 million net acres under lease. The leases
lie in northern West Virginia, across much of Pennsylvania, and
across portions of the Southern Tier of New York.
McClendon also said, “Chesapeake supports the [New York]
Department of Environmental Conservation’s decision to have all
hydraulic fracturing vendors register their products and reveal the
chemicals used in them.”
Chesapeake discloses the frac chemicals it uses on its web site
www.chk.com and also on www.hydraulicfracturing.com. ✦

Talisman said it is positioned for a major increase in Marcellus
drilling in 2010 and plans to move parts of its Montney shale play
to commercial development at the beginning of the year.
The company defines Tier 1 as top quality acreage with an expected full cycle breakeven of $4/Mcf. It has added 170,000 acres
in the last few months through a combination of acquisitions and
swaps for $570 million (Can.).
In the Marcellus, Talisman expects to end 2009 at 70 MMcfd.
Production exceeds 50 MMcfd, compared with 5 MMcfd at the
start of 2009 after commercial development began in late 2008.
The company’s last five Marcellus wells have estimated ultimate recoveries of 6 bcf/well, and it has hiked its average assumption for EUR over all Tier 1 acreage 17% to 3.5 bcf/well. The 2009
wells have average 30-day initial production rates of 4.5 MMcfd,
and the last six wells flowed 5 MMcfd or more.
Marcellus drilling and completion costs are down to (US) $4.3
million/well.
The company’s 214,000 highly contiguous net acres in the
Pennsylvania Marcellus are centered on Bradford and Tioga counties. Its 180,000 Tier 1 acres have 1,800 net well locations and a
full-cycle breakeven of (US) $4/MMBtu. Land acquisition costs
averaged (US) $3,250/acre.
Meanwhile, the company has 270,000 net acres in the Montney
shale, of which 166,000 acres are considered Tier 1 with 3,000
net well locations. Land acquisition costs averaged $3,500/acre
(Can.).
The 2009 focus has been in the Greater Groundbirch, Greater
Farrell, and Greater Cyprus areas. Talisman expects to complete 20
pilot wells this year, including 11 horizontal wells. The company
expects a full-cycle breakeven of $4/Mcf (Can.) but is not providing guidance yet on drilling and completion costs, initial potential
rates, or EURs.

Barrett may give one Uinta shale another try
Bill Barrett Corp., Denver, expensed as a dry hole in the quarter
ended Sept. 30 its first horizontal well on the deep Hook shale gas
prospect in eastern Utah.
The State 16H-32 well flowed natural gas at a subcommercial
rate from Upper Mississippian Manning Canyon shale at about
8,000 ft.
Although the well wasn’t commercial, the company will conduct further analysis of a longer horizontal section and improved
completion techniques, building on the knowledge gained from
this initial well, and will consider a second horizontal well in the
area.
The prospect lies in northern Emery County southeast of Price,
Utah, along the San Rafael swell on the Uinta basin southwestern
flank (OGJ Online, May 6, 2009).

Drilling

&

The Manning Canyon shale in the Uinta basin is 2,000 ft thick,
7,000-11,000 ft deep, with attractive 1-4% total organic carbon
and a 1.2-1.5% Ro. A hard limestone that may provide a frac barrier underlies it. Shell Exploration & Production Co. has also tested
the play (OGJ, Oct. 19, 2009, p. 41).
Bill Barrett also expensed the costs associated with a second
shallower well into the fractured Juana Lopez member of the Upper Cretaceous Mancos formation and the Woodside well previously drilled.
The company has a 50% working interest in Hook with ConocoPhillips holding the other 50%. Barrett has 100% working interest in the shallower formation. The prospect covers 74,500 net
undeveloped acres.

South Africa shales, sandstones evaluation set
Falcon Oil & Gas Ltd., Denver, plans to evaluate the natural gas
content of fractured shales and sandstones of Permian age in the
Karoo basin 120 miles northeast of Cape Town, South Africa.
Under a technical cooperation permit, Falcon has up to 1 year
to perform a technical appraisal of 7.5 million acres in the basin.
The appraisal will include a review of the South African Petroleum
Data Base.
The permit does not require Falcon to drill any wells and establishes the company in a priority position for exercising future
exploration rights on lands covered by the permit, Falcon said.
Nine wells drilled in the area in the late 1960s and early 1970s
encountered gas shows. One well, drilled in 1968, flowed at the
rate of 1.84 MMcfd of gas from fractures without stimulation, according to a Soekor Inc. geological well completion report.

Shales due look in New Zealand’s East Coast basin
Trans-Orient Petroleum Ltd., Vancouver, BC, plans to deepen
to 5,250 ft the Boar Hill-1 wildcat it has drilled to 1,600 ft in New
Zealand’s nonproducing East Coast basin.
The well’s shallow section provided some encouragement as
drill cuttings “head gas” readings were progressively more oilrich as the well cut Oligocene strata, reaching full depth in Oligocene Weber. The drillsite is at the crest of the Boar Hill structure
in the 100% controlled, 1.6 million-acre PEP 38349.
Deepening will take the well into the Paleocene and Upper
Cretaceous Waipawa black shale and Whangai fractured oil shale
source rocks.
Trans-Orient also plans to drill and core three shallow stratigraphic wells in its 100% owned, 530,000-acre PEP 38348 around
the Waitangi Hill discovery, where a 1912 well recovered 50°
gravity oil at 650 ft. Recent field work indicates that the Whangai
formation generated the oil.
Trans-Orient will become a fully owned subsidiary of Tag Oil
Ltd. in mid-December. ✦

PDVSA closes purchase of Dominican refiner stake
After several months of delays, Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) has completed its purchase of
a 49% stake in the Dominican Republic’s state refiner Refineria
Dominicana de Petroleo SA (Refidomsa), which owns a 34,000b/d facility in Haina.
The Dominican Republic’s Treasury Minister Vicente Bengoa
said the sale, worth $131.5 million according to Venezuelan media, would allow his country to become an oil distribution center
for the Caribbean and possibly Central America.
As part of the agreement, the Dominican Republic will buy
30,000 b/d of oil from Venezuela in addition to the 50,000 b/d it
already receives under the Caracas-sponsored PetroCaribe accord,
which provides Venezuelan oil and gas at preferential prices.
Analyst BMI said, “The deal will further integrate the Caribbean island into Venezuela’s PetroCaribe petroleum trading scheme,
touted by President Hugo Chavez as an alternative to the region’s
dependence on the US for its energy needs.”
Chavez showed interest in the agreement in June, but PDVSA did
not obtain a purchase memorandum of understanding from the Dominican government due to a regional crisis involving the ouster of
Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, a close political ally of Chavez.
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
A further delay arose in August after California legislator Loretta Sanchez suggested the agreement would violate the terms
of the free trade agreement between the US and the Dominican
Republic. Under the FTA’s terms, oil refined by Refidomsa could
be exported to any market while under the new agreement with
PDVSA refined oil could be sold only to Venezuela.
Purchase of the refiner was reported in July, when PDVSA said
it agreed to acquire a 49% interest in Refimdosa as partial payment
of oil debts. The Dominican Republic owed $1 billion to Venezuela for oil supplied under the PetroCaribe program (OGJ, July 20,
2009, Newsletter).
In December 2008, Royal Dutch Shell PLC sold its 50% stake in
Refidomsa to the Dominican government for $110 million, making the government sole owner of the Haina refinery.
Shell said its decision to sell the shareholding was part of its
active portfolio management to realize value for shareholders and
to refocus the downstream portfolio.

for joint construction and operation of the Abreu e Lima refinery,
in Brazil’s Pernambuco state.
The two firms said the Abreu e Lima refinery will be able to
process 230,000 b/d of heavy oil, supplied equally by Petrobras
and PDVSA. The refinery’s main product will be low-sulfur diesel.
Petrobras and PDVSA will incorporate the company in Brazil.
They did not say when the procedures would be completed or
when the refinery would begin operating.
The refinery was conceived to process crude from a PDVSAPetrobras joint venture in the Carabobo region of Venezuela’s Orinoco belt, but it has taken years for the two sides to agree on the
terms of their partnership.
Last month, Petrobras said it had resolved all outstanding issues with PDVSA over development of the Abreu e Lima refinery,
but that the Venezuelan firm would have to pay Petrobras at least
$400 million when it signs the final agreement (OGJ Online, Oct.
8, 2009)
Petrobras will hold a 60% stake in the joint-venture firm, while
PDVSA will hold the remaining 40%.

offshore platforms and subsea pipeline package began fabrication
in September. The units involved 30,000 tonnes of steel for 38
structures, said an announcement from the company in mid October.
The three onshore packages—Karan gas facilities, pipeline utilities and cogeneration, and the Karan sulfur recovery and Manifa
gas facilities—have all begun initial construction at Khursaniyah
(OGJ, June 22, 2009, p. 50).
Project teams consist of members from Aramco and contractors J. Ray McDermott, Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co.,
Petrofac, and GS Engineering.
Karan is the first nonassociated offshore gas field Aramco has
developed, the announcement reiterated. The onshore facility,
about 160 km north of Dhahran, will be able to process 1.8 bscfd
of Karan Khuff gas.
The gas will move in a 110-km subsea pipeline from field to onshore processing at the Khursaniyah gas plant. The offshore facilities
at Karan consist of four production platforms connected to a main
tie-in platform that will feed sour gas to the subsea pipeline.

BP, Eni need more gas for Egyptian LNG train
Egypt’s state-owned Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Co. (Egas),
clarifying earlier comments, reported that BP PLC and Eni SPA
have found just 2 tcf of gas, or half the amount needed to start up
an LNG train at Damietta.
For the proposed second train to start up, said Abdallah Abdelhady, Egas assistant vice-chairman for production, the two firms
have to find a total of 4 tcf of gas. Once they have done so, he said,
the second train will start.
An Egas official said last week that the firm had shelved plans
for the construction of a second LNG train at Damietta until
enough reserves are found.
“If the Egyptian government is given proven gas reserve certificates then it will deal with the project in a more positive manner
because we have a lot of commitments with domestic demand,”
said Hassan Sabry, an Egas projects and planning official.
Shamil Hamdy, undersecretary at the oil ministry, was earlier
quoted as saying that Eni had delayed the project because it lacked
the necessary financing due to the global economic downturn
(OGJ Online, Oct. 30, 2009).

Construction begins on Chinese LNG terminal
Construction on another LNG terminal in China began earlier
last month, according to press reports from the country.
The Ningbo LNG terminal is south of Shanghai, in Zhejiang Province, and will be the fifth Chinese terminal, the fourth
owned by China National Offshore Oil Co. Ltd. China’s National

Development and Reform Commission approved the project earlier this year.
When completed in 2012, Phase 1 of construction at Ningbo
will have installed 3 million tonnes/year of regasification capacity. Press reports put construction costs of Phase 1 at more than
$1 billion. CNOOC envisions a matching second phase but has
announced no completion date.
Ownership of CNOOC Zhejiang Ningbo Liquefied Natural Gas
Co. Ltd. is among CNOOC Natural Gas & Power Co. Ltd. (51%),
Zhejiang Provincial Energy Group Co. Ltd. (29%), and Ningbo City
Power Developing Corp. (20%).
CNOOC’s 3-million-tpy terminal at Shanghai received its first
LNG cargo earlier this month (OGJ, Oct. 26, 2009, p. 11).

Floating Florida LNG terminal approved
A Gulf of Mexico offshore LNG terminal took a major step towards reality Nov. 2 when acting Maritime Administrator David T.
Matsuda approved its construction off western Florida.
The approval was expected after Port Dolphin Energy LLC announced last week it had signed a “record of decision” in its application for a license to build the deepwater LNG port.
The signing, according to the announcement by the company,
“paves the way to the awarding of a deepwater port license” to be
issued by the US Maritime Administration. It marked the “successful completion of a comprehensive environmental impact statement” directed by the US Coast Guard and formal approval [in
September] by Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. ✦

Carbon-eating trees
Your editorial entitled “Mitigating
climate change” was right on target
(OGJ, Oct. 19, 2009, p. 18). The idea of
spending $10.5 trillion on projects with
essentially no potential return on investment is ludicrous.
A much better approach for reducing greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide)
would be to plant billions of carbon-eating trees. Such a program would benefit
all of the agricultural schools in the
world and would provide employment
for low-skilled workers everywhere.
Additionally, it could put ACORN to
work on something worthwhile.

While Republican senators deserve applause for
demanding to know what climate-change legislation would cost before voting on it, the illumination they seek has large shadows. Cost projections
have no way to account for a crucial and largely
unheeded disadvantage of the cap-and-trade approach to moderation of greenhouse gas emissions.
Cost studies, of course, are essential to political deliberation. And in this case they’re alarming.
Whether the Environmental Protection Agency

So what would the allowance price be? It’s obvious from the range of assumed prices in studies

windfall towards the public good
rather than the curse it has become for
other nations, which have found
their discovery a short-lived path
to prosperity because of the damage it can wreak on the overall
economy. Brazil is determined to
forge its own way to best manage
the exploration and development
of these vast oil reserves as well as
their ultimate revenues.
To ward off the future oil curse,
Brazil is taking bold steps today along
a tightrope. On one side of our balancing pole is the commitment to remain a
reliable development partner to foreign
governments and energy companies.
On the other is our country’s desire to
control its own resources and use their
revenues to fuel our fight against poverty and improve social equality.
What’s proposed is a New Social
Fund that not only would keep these
efforts on track for generations to come
but also would help shield the economy
from the potentially destructive impact
of a resource windfall. Also helping to
fend off the “curse” is the hard-earned
fact that the oil bonanza arrives in a diverse economy and a land rich in many
natural resources.
Brazil’s booming economy, expected
to grow about 4% next year, was attractive to foreign investors well before
the discovery of the massive presalt oil
reserves. The new legal and regulatory
framework submitted to the National
Congress aims to preserve this allure.

gent oversight onto the contract process
to fight corruption and ensure scrutiny.
It would rest on a foundation of Brazil’s
already strict banking transparency
regulations, which have helped turn
Brazil from a debtor into a creditor nation and produced the clear, real-time
metrics that enabled the central banks
to take quick measures to counter the
global financial crisis.
The existing development contracts already held by foreign companies for 26%
of the presalt territory will be unaffected
by the new regulations. These agreements
will be honored and cover what Petrobras
estimates as 5-8 billion bbl of oil and
natural gas equivalent. In addition, the
current concession model will remain in
effect for Brazilian onshore sites.
In the 72% of unlicensed presalt
reserves, Petrobras will operate all
exploration contracts and partner with
all parties while keeping a minimum
of 30% of costs incurred and profits
realized. That formula leaves plenty of
profitability for investors, and Brazil
still needs these foreign partners to bid
on development rights. A competitive
market is a stronger one, both financially and technologically. International
investors viewing involvement alongside Petrobras face a tremendous opportunity, as Petrobras has established
global benchmarks developing technologies for deep-sea oil exploration.
Furthermore, presalt oil exploitation is
high reward, low risk.

New system

With the creation of the New Social
Fund, Brazil will create a public savings
account that funnels presalt revenue
into education, science, and technology as part of our fight against poverty.
Countries that have successfully managed wealth from their newly found

BRAZIL’S NEW LICENSING SYSTEM
Cost recovery
mechanisms

• Contractors will recoup costs of exploration, development, operation, and abandonment through “cost oil,” limited per period by a
ceiling established in their contract.
• Costs above ceiling can be carried and recovered in succeeding
years.

Production shares
before and after
cost recovery

• Petrobras will be the operator of all production-sharing contracts,
with a minimum participation of 30% of the costs incurred and
profits obtained.
• “Cost oil” will be shared by contractors, and “profit oil” will be
shared among government and contractors according to the auction
result.

Royalties

• Royalties are still under consideration by the Brazilian Congress.
• The model is expected to follow that of most other fiscal systems,
with royalties taken as a percentage of gross revenues (calculated
from the percentage of production).

Taxes

Taxes applied will depend on existing legislation.

Uplifts

A portion of capital costs can be recovered through cost recovery,
determined on a case-by-case basis by regulation or by contract.

Adjustments to price
changes

• Adjustments on “profit oil” shares between the government and
contractors can be previewed in contracts to protect against future
price fluctuations.
• Adjustments will be approved by the national energy council.

Terms of contract
auctions

• The winner of auctions for exploration and production-sharing
contracts will be the company or group of companies whose proposal offers the greatest percentage of “profit oil” to the Brazilian
government.
• Upon assigning a contract, the contractor must pay a bonus.

Existing concession
contracts

• Concession contracts already established in the presalt region will
be fully honored by the Brazilian government.
• The new sharing model will be effective only for those areas which
have not yet been auctioned, representing about 72% of the whole
presalt area, or 107,000 sq km.

natural resources, such as Norway,
earmarked those funds as investments
in human capital and development.
The New Social Fund would draw
income from different facets of presalt
exploration and production revenues
to fuel Brazil’s commitment to socially
inclusive development. Core to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s priority
of sustainable growth to reduce poverty
and inequality, this would further
brighten a social landscape, which during 2004-08 saw a 10-point rise in the

proportion of Brazilians belonging to
the middle class—currently 52%.
Brazil continues to take a longterm view of managing these natural
resources, including a commitment to
renewable and alternative energy. We
are self-sufficient in oil, and the presalt
discoveries will not impact our clean
and renewable energy network. For
example, last year, 160 hydroelectric
plants produced 74% of all electricity
generated, and only 27% of the country’s hydroelectric potential has been

explored. By 2017, the expanding Brazilian economy is projected to demand
approximately 155,000 Mw of installed
energy capacity. Despite the presalt bequest, 80% of that energy will continue
to come from renewable sources. We
also boast the world’s largest flex-fuel
fleet.
Given the magnitude of expected
reserves, many issues surround the development of what international geologists estimate could be tens of billions
of barrels of recoverable oil. But the
country’s fundamental objective is to
exploit this resource in a way that bolsters Brazil’s economy and its progress
in fighting poverty while remaining a
reliable international business partner, rewarding the investments of the
countries and international oil developers that join Petrobras in exploiting the
presalt layer.
Like Brazil’s actions to shield its
economy from the global financial
crisis, the new plan is another step on
our unique path as full participants of
the world economy while remaining
responsible for stewarding our own
resources and destiny. For the oftdescribed country of the future, the
future is now. ✦

CSIS: unconventional resources altering global gas outlook
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Production potential from tight
shales and other unconventional
resources has significantly altered the
world’s natural gas outlook, experts
said Oct. 28 at a seminar on the evolu-

tion of global gas markets at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies
in Washington, DC.
“Unconventional sources are likely
to play a role in other parts of the
world,” observed Glen Sweetnam,
director of the US Energy Information
Administration’s international, eco-

nomic, and greenhouse gases division.
By 2035, shale gas could represent
62% of the total gas produced in China,
50% in Australia, and 42% in the US,
Sweetnam. “They also have shale gas in
Europe, but there’s increasing disagreement over whether it will be developed” because so few of the resources

are on private property, officials must
contend with a “not-in-my-backyard”
(NIMBY) attitude, and the region does
not have a particularly robust oilfield
service industry to support it, he said.
Sweetnam said EIA is in the process
of “tuning up” its first international gas
outlook model, which will be included
in the next annual energy outlook. Gas
provided 26% of the world’s consumed
energy in 2006 and should continue to
supply a similar share, he said, adding,
“In end uses, gas will compete against
other fuels in stationary markets.”
When it released its initial estimate
of yearend 2008 US oil and gas reserves
on Oct. 29, EIA noted that gas reserves
rose enough not only to replace production during the year, “but also to grow
by almost 3% over [their level at the
end of] 2007, largely due to continued
development of unconventional gas
from shales.”
Sweetnam said, “Low-cost US conventional gas has been depleted. We’re
left with high-cost conventional gas deep
onshore and in small pockets offshore.
The unconventional resource is larger,
but its costs will have to come down to
about $4/MMbtu to be competitive.”

nomic recession toward the end of
2008 and a recovery that looks increasingly gradual influences the gas
demand and price outlooks. “Demand
retrenchment occurred as global
liquefaction capacity grew, creating a
complete mismatch,” she observed.
Through last year, Pacific Basin customers called on Atlantic Basin suppliers
for around 1.8 bcfd of gas, Snyder said.
Now, it’s around 400 MMcfd. New North
American shale gas production growth
through 2015 could negate its pull on
Atlantic Basin LNG, she suggested.
“What we’re seeing over the next
few years is that even though European
supplies are under take-or-pay contracts, volumes will contract to protect
the price through periods of excess supply,” Snyder said. LNG prices in Europe
and the US could stay close through
2013, but may climb in 2013 in Europe
but not in the US because of its shale
gas production. “Essentially, a wide gap
could open when more LNG supplies
are delivered into Europe. We also see
Qatar continuing to deliver baseline
supplies to the US to protect prices,”
she said.

Local factors

Investment costs for developing new
global gas supplies vary, the panelists
noted. “A lot depends on the size, distance, and location,” said Jensen. “The
upstream is very blurred. In places like
Qatar, some of the opportunity costs
are negative because all the money is in
liquids and the gas might be flared to
save reinjection costs.”
Snyder noted that long transportation costs also raise some questions.
Jensen added that new gas development
is increasingly occurring away from
coasts, while customers avoiding some
potential producers for political reasons
also could affect costs.
Panalists also questioned whether
a gas cartel could emerge. “We see
individual incentives with producers
like Russia,” said Snyder, adding, “Going forward, with European shale gas
development and a wider supply base,
there could be a movement away from

Local conditions will determine the
time and extent of shale gas development, other seminar panelists noted.
The lack of existing infrastructure and
water-handling issues will likely make
Marcellus shale development move
more slowly than other US gas-bearing
shales, according to Jen Snyder, head of
Wood Mackenzie’s North American gas
practice in Houston. Europe could be “a
game-changer” but only after 2019, she
added.
Jim Jensen, president of Jensen Associates in Weston, Mass., warned against
shale gas over-optimism. “Natural
gas is the manic-depressive of energy,
swinging from dwindling to abundant
supply prospects,” he said, adding that
shale gas development could be affected by cost questions as well as water
disposal and NIMBY issues.

oil price-based contracts.”
Jensen said, “I’ve always been
skeptical that a gas cartel could work.
[The General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade] stipulates that countries can’t
exercise export controls, which is why
[the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries] sets production quotas.
Because the major gas exporters export
only 36% of their total production,
controls would affect their domestic
markets.”
He said Russia could continue to be
a leader gas exporter, once it resolves
whether OAO Gazprom, its national gas
company, is a commercial or political
entity. Iran also could be significant because it has the world’s second-largest
reserves, but its growing domestic demand and need to reinject gas into oilbearing formations could limit exports,
Jensen said. Caspian Basin gas producers face significant pipeline transportation issues while China, which has
substantial gas resources, may find
them more expensive to produce and
consume than coal, he added.
Sweetnam said, “It’s difficult to
increase market control if you’re facing competition from other stationary
sources such as nuclear and coal.”

US exporting LNG?
Panelists also were skeptical of US
prospects to become an LNG exporter
if its shale gas resources are aggressively developed. Jensen said liquefaction plants require substantial customer
commitments, and that US exporters
would be competing in a global market
with suppliers with lower overhead.
“I think North America is much
likelier to export LNG technology
than product,” added Snyder. “We also
might see some revival of the domestic
petrochemical industry.”
One audience member disagreed.
“With enormous pipeline capacity between the Marcellus shale in the Northeast and the Gulf Coast, LNG exports
don’t sound so far-fetched, particularly
to Europe,” said Benjamin Schlesinger,
president of Benjamin Schlesinger &

Senate panel’s climate-change markup under protest
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
As other Republicans boycotted the
US Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee’s markup of global
climate-change legislation on Nov. 3,
George V. Voinovich (Ohio) showed
up to work with what he said was still
incomplete information.
“I agree with you that climate
change and how our nation addresses
it is of incredible importance,” he told
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), the committee’s chairwoman, in his opening statement. “But, in my 44 years in public
service, I have learned that tackling
significant problems requires the best
information available and the most rig-

orous analysis from unbiased sources.
I don’t recall ever finding meaningful
solutions with incomplete information
and partisanship.”
Republicans have complained that
the US Environmental Protection Agency’s analysis of S. 1733, which Boxer
and John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) introduced
on Sept. 30, was not adequate for the
committee to work knowledgably on
the bill.
In her opening statement, Boxer said
she and the committee’s majority staff
took steps to provide more information
sooner than usual as the markup approached. The committee held 3 days’
of hearings and heard from 54 witnesses on nine panels Oct. 27-29 in addition
to 28 earlier global warming hearings

during 2009, she said. “To ensure
that members had all the information
required for this markup, we made the
chairman’s mark public a full 10 days
prior to this meeting, rather than the 3
days required,” she added.
The committee’s majority also
released EPA’s analysis of the bill,
which she said was built on 5 weeks of
analysis by the agency of HR 2454, the
measure cosponsored by Reps. Henry
A. Waxman (D-Calif.) and Edward J.
Markey (D-Mass.) which the House
approved by 7 votes on June 26, and
another 2 weeks of analysis of changes
in S. 1733 which Boxer said modified
the House bill by only about 10%.
Boxer also reportedly is feeling pressure from other Democrats on the com-

Chesapeake’s
NYC decision

S

o exactly what did Chesapeake
Energy Corp.’s decision not to
drill any Marcellus shale natural gas
wells in New York City’s watershed
mean? It depends on who you ask.
“One company’s voluntary moratorium is no substitute for analyses
by the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation and Department
of Health to determine the potential
of natural gas drilling failures in the
New York City watershed, and of
damage to critical infrastructure in
adjacent communities,” a spokesman
for the city’s Department of Environmental Protection told OGJ Nov. 2.
Gwen Lachelt, director of Earthworks’ oil and gas accountability
project in Durango, Colo., said the
same day that the environmental
organization welcomed Chesapeake’s
“recognition that drilling is inherently risky, and that people don’t
want their drinking water at risk.
Welcome and unenforceable declarations aside, the greater issues of permanent protection for the watershed
and an underregulated polluting
technology remain.”
Chesapeake CEO Aubrey K. McClendon took a different view when
he reported the Oklahoma City independent producer’s decision.

Chesapeake’s research showed that
it was the only leaseholder within
the city’s watershed, which put it in a
unique position to take the matter off
the table so the area’s gas development discussion can proceed constructively, McClendon said.
“The small amount of acreage
Chesapeake had acquired within the
watershed region—fewer than 5,000
acres—was largely obtained as a result
of leasing land outside the watershed
from property owners who also had
tracts within the watershed. This
leasehold is immaterial to Chesapeake
and also does not appear prospective
for the Marcellus shale,” he said.

Refocusing efforts

Chesapeake believes it can drill
safely in any watershed, including
NYC’s, McClendon said, but the company has chosen to focus its efforts
on more promising areas in the state.
The company supports the state
DEC’s decision to have all fracturing
vendors register their products and
reveal ingredients in them, and has
already made such disclosures at its
own web site.
Chesapeake has 1.5 million net

it the single-largest leaseholder in

mittee such as Max Baucus (Mont.) and
Ben Nelson (Neb.) to modify the bill.
She said that she expects the committee
to resume its markup on Nov. 4.

More than typical
“That’s 7 weeks of analysis, involving tens of thousands of pages of
documentation. There is no reason to
do additional analysis and spend more
taxpayer dollars when the work has
been done,” she said. “EPA has made it
clear they stand behind the economic
analysis and that it is more analysis
than is typically provided before a
markup.”
Voinovich responded that he appreciated Boxer’s delaying the markup and
pushing back the deadline by which
Republicans can offer amendments,
as well as her inviting EPA to explain
its analysis to the committee later that
afternoon. “However, while I respect
your intent, the issue before us is not
whether we understand EPA’s 38-page
discussion paper on S. 1733 and its current analysis of Waxman-Markey,” he
continued. “Rather, the issue is that the
committee lacks a full analysis, with
modeling runs, of S. 1733. Having an
EPA briefing does nothing to change
that.”
Voinovich said the EPA briefing also
was unnecessary because it has already
agreed to analyze the bill using modeling inputs and assumptions which he
requested. “So we should be able to
reach a bipartisan agreement to get it
done. My staff worked together with
EPA’s modelers over several weeks to
reach this agreement, and I appreciate
their hard work. No more negotiation
is needed. Chairman Boxer, all you
need to do is give your consent, and
EPA can begin its work immediately,”
Voinovich said.
“There is no doubt that, based on
the make-up of the committee, S. 1733
will move forward. The majority has
the votes, five more on the committee than the minority,” he continued.
“While I believe that S. 1733 will

CFTC chair calls for regulation of emissions markets
Nick Snow
Washington Editor

this role in existing emissions trading
programs, he indicated.

Comprehensive regulation of financial derivatives will also need to be a
critical component of a well-functioning domestic emissions trading market,
US Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary G. Gensler said
on Nov. 3.
“As Congress moves forward with
potential cap-and-trade legislation, I believe it should fully regulate the expanded carbon trading markets—including
the futures market, the OTC market, and
the cash market—without exception,”
Gensler said in an address to the International Emissions Trading Association’s
2009 fall trading symposium.
“Ensuring transparency, protecting the
price discovery function, and addressing
financial risk are every bit as critical for
emissions markets as for other markets,”
Gensler said, adding, “It is crucial to
ensure that carbon markets function
smoothly, efficiently, and transparently.
Effective regulation of carbon allowance
trading will require cooperation on the
parts of several regulators.”
Gensler said six regulatory components will need to be considered, including standard setting and allocation,
compliance with emissions caps and
offset requirements, record-keeping
and registry maintenance, trade execution system oversight, clearing of trades
oversight, and protection against fraud,
manipulation, and other abuses.
The first three components, which
Gensler said represent the “cap” portion of cap-and-trade, fall within other
regulatory agencies’ expertise. CFTC is
best equipped to handle the remaining components since it already fills

Lists examples
For example, the US Environmental
Protection Agency issues sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxide allowances under
the federal acid rain, NOx budget trading, and clean air market programs, he
said. On a smaller scale, 10 states from
Maine to Maryland form the Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative and issue
GHG allowances, Gensler added.
“In each case, other entities issue
allowances, ensure compliance, and
maintain the registry. The constant,
however, is that the CFTC regulates the
emissions futures trading markets,” he
explained. “In other words, the CFTC
has a great deal of experience regulating the ‘trade’ part of cap-and-trade.”
It already oversees contracts based on
sulfur dioxide, NOx, and carbon dioxide
allowances and offsets listed on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and Chicago
Climate Futures Exchange, Gensler said.
“In most respects, emissions contract
markets operate similarly to other commodity markets the CFTC regulates,” he
said, adding, “While each contract—
such as SO2, wheat, treasury bills, or
natural gas—presents its own unique
challenges, the regulatory scheme is
essentially the same.” He said CFTC
has thorough processes to ensure that
exchanges have procedures in place to
protect market participants and ensure
fair and orderly trading, that products
are designed to minimize potential manipulation, and that exchanges comply
with the law and regulations.

Additional oversight
Its compliance staff monitors operations to ensure that exchanges are

enforcing their rules and customers
are protected from abusive practices.
Its surveillance staff watches for signs
of manipulation or congestion and
determines how to best address market
threats. “We have the authority to set
and enforce position limits, and our
enforcement staff is actively prosecuting cases,” Gensler said.
If Congress passes cap-and-trade
legislation, CFTC would work with
other regulators to implement appropriate additional safeguards, he noted.
“There may be specific facets of carbon
markets that require particular protections, and I look forward to working
with Congress, market participants, and
the public to offer the commission’s
expertise in considering those,” he said.
“As a foundation, the markets should
benefit from the protections that we
currently have against fraud, manipulation, and other abuses as directed by
the Commodity Exchange Act coupled
with any new protections Congress is
considering for the OTC derivatives
markets,” said Gensler.
“We also must ensure that all transactions in both the carbon futures and
cash markets are promptly reported
and that a central registry is updated at
least on a daily basis,” he said, adding,
“With immediate registry of trades, it
will be easier for regulators to identify
manipulation in the markets.”
Gensler said he considers it important for companies to be able to make
long-term capital commitments and
hedge their carbon emissions allowances’ long-term price risk. “That is why it
is critical to get the regulatory oversight
right of both the futures markets and
the over-the-counter markets that may
develop out of a cap-and-trade program,” he maintained. ✦

Refinery desulfurization capacities for gas oil and naphtha in US and
Canada will continue to grow through
2013 but more slowly than they did in
2000-08, says a study by GlobalData,
London.
Among 134 active refineries in the US
and Canada covered by the study, gas oil
desulfurization increased from 2.8348
million b/d in 2000 to 3.8216 million
b/d in 2008. The total is expected to
reach 3.979 million b/d in 2013.
The average growth rate thus will
decline from 3.7%/year in 2000-08 to
0.8%/year in the forecast period, the
study says.
Naphtha desulfurization capacity
in the US and Canada will increase to
4.6379 million b/d in 2013 from 4.5983
million b/d in 2008 and 4.3418 million
b/d in 2000, GlobalData predicts.
The average growth rate for naphtha
desulfurization capacity will decline
from 0.7%/year in 2000-08 to 0.2%/
year in 2008-13.

combined naphtha desulfurization
capacity is 40% of the global total.
The US share of global gas oil

Denbury-Encore merger to test CO2-oil synergies
The production-sequestration synergies of crude oil and carbon dioxide
will receive a new test under a $4.5 billion acquisition by Denbury Resources
Inc. of Encore Acquisition Co.
Both companies have strategies
geared to enhanced oil recovery via
CO2 injection. On Nov. 1 they announced signing of a definitive merger
agreement that will leave Denbury, of
Plano, Tex., the surviving entity.
Both companies also are pursuing
26

supplies of CO2 from industrial sources
needing to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas through capture and sequestration in the subsurface.

The companies
Denbury has 212.4 million boe of
reserves, 59% developed and 82% oil,
in mature fields of Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas.
At Jackson Dome in Mississippi it
has CO2 reserves estimated at 5.6 tcf

proved, 3 tcf probable, and 2 tcf possible connected to mature oil fields
by 750 miles of existing and planned
pipelines. Denbury hopes to supplement Jackson Dome supply with CO2
from Gulf Coast emitters and planned
projects to gasify solid carbon.
In this year’s second quarter it
produced an average of 44,240 boe/d
after adjustments for the acquisition late
last year of Hastings oil field south of
Houston and sale of properties this year

in the Barnett shale gas play.
Among other projects, Denbury is
laying a 320-mile, 24-in. pipeline to
carry CO2 from Donaldsonville, La.,
near the termination of an existing
line, to Hastings field.
Encore, Fort Worth, recently reported 186 million boe of reserves,
72% oil and 80% proved developed, in
the Williston basin, Rocky Mountains,
Midcontinent, and Permian basin. Its
interests include 300,000 net acres in
the Bakken shale oil play.
In this year’s first half Encore produced an average 41,652 boe/d.
Before the merger announcement,
Encore said its CO2 plans centered on
Bell Creek field in southeastern Montana. Now on waterflood, the field
has an estimated 350 million bbl of oil
originally in place with 221 million bbl
remaining.
Encore said it expects the field to
produce an additional 30.1 million bbl
through miscible CO2 injection. It will
deliver the gas through new 206-mile,
8-in. or 10-in. pipeline from the Lost
Cabin gas plant operated by ConocoPhillips in central Wyoming.
Encore entered a deal in July to buy
about 50 MMcfd of CO2 from the plant
during an initial term of 15 years. In

addition to laying the pipeline, it plans
to install compression at the plant.
The Bell Creek project includes
reactivation of 275 wells and drilling of
as many as 75 wells to establish a fivespot injection pattern.
Encore estimated the production
response from 100% utilization of the
available CO2 at more than 6,500 b/d
by 2015, with output remaining at that
level for 10 years.
The Bell Creek project would bring
CO2 to within 120 miles of the Cedar
Creek anticline in eastern Montana,
where Encore has 40% of its total
reserves and estimates oil potentially
recoverable via CO2 injection at 200
million bbl.
It has identified the U4 zone of the
Upper Ordovician Red River formation
in South Pine oil field as the first target
of CO2 injection enabled by a northward extension of Log Cabin-Bell Creek
pipeline.
Shell Oil, the original South Pine
operator, conducted a pilot CO2 flood
in the field in the 1980s after the pilot
area stopped producing oil via waterflood. Encore estimates potential recovery through CO2 injection in the target
zone at 19 million boe and in other
South Pine strata at 42 million boe.

Larger projects
After the merger, the combined
company will be able to pursue “significantly larger” CO2 projects in the
Gulf Coast and Rockies, said Denbury
Chief Executive Officer Phil Rykhoek.
“This combination will also further
enhance Denbury’s position as the
natural buyer and owner of mature oil
properties in our core regions and the
partner of choice for CO2 emitters looking to reduce their carbon footprint,”
he said.
Rykhoek said the acquisition
would provide for production growth
in 2015 and beyond, “about the
time when we anticipate nearing the
production peak of our existing EOR
field inventory.”
Although the companies have reported financial losses in recent quarters,
mainly because of decreased prices of
oil and gas, both were profitable last
year, during the first half of which
prices set record highs.
For 2008, Denbury reported net
income of $388.4 million on revenue of $1.366 billion. Encore earned
$438.8 million on $1.125 billion of
revenue. ✦

corrective actions to eliminate potential

“Instead of living up to that commitment, BP has allowed hundreds of potential hazards to continue unabated,”

mission, which is independent from
OSHA. BP suggested the OSHA citations
will expedite the process of referring
the contested case to an administrative
law judge.

OSHA outlines citations
OSHA issued 270 notifications of
failure to abate with fines totaling
$56.7 million. The agency also identified 439 new willful violations for
failures to follow industry-accepted
controls on the pressure relief safety
systems and other process safety management violations with penalties totaling $30.7 million.
“BP was given 4 years to correct the
safety issues identified pursuant to the
settlement agreement, yet OSHA has
found hundreds of violations of the

agreement and hundreds of new violations,” said Jordan Barab, acting assistant
secretary of labor for OSHA, adding, “BP
still has a great deal of work to do.”
OSHA can issue a notification of failure to abate if an employer fails to correct a cited condition and the citation
is a final order before the Occupational
Health and Safety Review Commission. A willful violation exists where
an employer knows of a violation and
demonstrates “either an intentional
disregard for the requirements of the
OSHA Act of 1970 or shows plain indifference to employee safety and health,”
OSHA said.

BP responds
“We are disappointed that OSHA

took this action in advance of the full
consideration of the review commission,” said Keith Casey, manager of the
Texas City refinery. “We continue to
believe we are in full compliance with
the settlement agreement, and we look
forward to demonstrating this before
the review commission.”
BP will continue to work with OSHA
to resolve the differences, Casey said.
“We believe our efforts at the Texas
City refinery to improve process safety
performance have been among the
most strenuous and comprehensive that
the refining industry has ever seen,”
he said, adding, “We remain committed to further enhancing our safety and
compliance systems and achieving our
goal of becoming an industry leader in
process safety.” ✦

for more rapid diffusion of technology

Peebler said his company conducted mostly internal R&D in 1999.
While internal work has continued,
the company has now expanded into

partnerships, and a joint venture with

Industry typically does experimental prototypes with such small tests
that problems don’t surface until fullsize tests are performed later, Peebler
lamented.

Khodorkovsky
fights back

ussia’s oil and gas industry has
had its share of drama over
former OAO Yukos head Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, who was convicted
and sentenced to 8 years in jail in
2005 for major fraud and tax evasion.
Khodorkovsky has been on trial
again before a Moscow court since
Mar. 3 and faces more than 20 years
in prison over embezzlement allegations. But the oilman has now
opened a new front in his battle with
Moscow.
The European Court of Human
Rights recently announced that Yukos is suing the Russian government
for a record $98 billion. Talk about
a counter attack. The former Yukos
boss thinks big, and knows the case
will serve as a foil to the trial in
Moscow.
The European Court of Human
Rights initially said the case would
be heard in November, but it has
since postponed the hearing in order
to allow the recently appointed judge
to become familiar with the file—
doubtlessly a thick one.

billion in unpaid taxes and another
€6 billion in penalty charges.
Along the way, Khodorkovsky
was convicted and sentenced to jail.
His supporters have condemned the
trial as politically motivated to keep
Khodorkovsky—a critic of Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin—out of
politics altogether.
Analyst BMI grants that Yukos
former shareholders achieved a
moral victory in getting the European Court of Human Rights to hear
the case, but says it is “doubtful that
Yukos will come away victorious in
the end.”

Moscow worried

That may be, but Moscow is clearly worried as evidenced by its recent
efforts to manipulate the outcome of
the hearing.
That much became clear in August
when the court announced that a
Russian judge on the panel, Valery
Mussin, had resigned—after having
been named a director at Russia’s
state-owned OAO Gazprom—in
order to avoid a conflict of interest in
Yukos’s claims

Proved reserves of coalbed methane
fell 5% to 20.8 tcf.
The SEC accounting change would
also have affected 2008 gas reserves.
Under existing SEC rules, the price
at Henry Hub, La., used to estimate
reserves dropped 21% to $5.63/MMbtu
at yearend 2008. The price would have
increased 32% to $8.93/MMbtu under
the new rules.
As to crude oil, the SEC rules change
will allow producers starting in 2009
to calculate reserves on an average of
first-day-of-the-month prices throughout the year rather than the single price
in effect on the year’s last trading day.
This should reduce sensitivity to price
troughs that often occur near the end of
a year, EIA noted.
Under the old system, oil reserves
fell to 19.1 billion bbl, largely due to
the misleading effect that arises almost
entirely from negative net revisions,
EIA said.
The spot price of West Texas Intermediate fell to $44.60/bbl on Dec. 31,
2008, compared with $99.64/bbl on
Jan. 1 and $145.31/bbl in early July.
The yearend price was close to the
market low of $30.28/bbl on Dec. 23.
Net negative revisions were about the
same as the 1.7 billion bbl produced in
2008 and were nearly 1.5 times what
was discovered.
“Using the new (SEC) approach, the
WTI price would have been $71.79/
bbl for 2007 and $101.63 for 2008, an
increase of 42%,” EIA said.
It said the effect of the new pricing
methodology can’t be estimated precisely for past years, but “it seems certain that net revisions for 2008 would
have been substantially less negative, or
perhaps even positive, under the new
reporting method.”
Oil reserves added in 2008 include
375 million bbl in the Gulf of Mexico
Outer Continental Shelf, 250 million
bbl in Texas, and 167 million bbl in
North Dakota. ✦

A I analysis
Building on our experience in Texas,
as earlier reported here,3 we focused on
the Waulsortian mounds in the Williston basin, the Lodgepole reefs.
The rationale of the A I photogeomorphological analysis is that the
weight of the overburden compacts the
off-reef argillaceous sediments more

than it does the reef core; this drapes
strata over the buildup.
The differential compaction drape
increases upward (Fig. 4) and has
disappeared at Level 1; this is why the
A I analysis requires uplift and erosion
to remove enough of the top section
(say, from Ground I down to Ground

II) to expose the extremely subtle drape
etched in the bedrock down to a level
where it may be reliably detected.
Of course, A I is only an innovation
in aerial photogeomorphology. The
outcome Fig. 5, a scientific epiphany

carbonates (Fig. 9). This explains how
the puny Waulsortian mounds with
3-5% porosity, negligible nonfracture
permeability, and holding a maximum
of, say, 120,000 bbl of producible oil,
in fact may yield more than 4 million
bbl of oil.
The mounds and their collapse
chimneys are the outlets of the real
reservoir.
Unlike the Bakken shale play in the
Williston basin that requires hydraulic
fracturing, the collapse of the Lodgepole mounds created a natural vertical

fracturing across the entire area that
can effectively drain the Madison carbonates if wells are placed within the
collapses.
A scaled composite structural profile
of all Dickinson wells plotted with
(X) as origin shows the reconstructed
profile of precollapse mounds and the
different amounts of collapse (Fig. 10).
Critically, it documents the existence of
a central collapse cavity, filled with reef
rubble.
The only four wells that found the
“central collapse cavity” were sited on

the evidence of A II. This central “sinkhole” has been corroborated by seismic
elsewhere (Fig. 11).

The US working drilling rig count has started
to reverse its steep drop
as expectations for crude
and gas prices and demand have become more
Drilling
bullish.
The Baker Hughes
Inc. US rig count for the week ending
Oct. 23 was 1,048, up 8 rigs from the
previous week. Although this is down
considerably from the 2,031 rigs working in September 2008, the count was
up 172 rigs from the 2009 low point of
876 rigs in June.
Recent oil prices have been above
$70/bbl since reaching a low of about
$32/bbl in December 2008 (Fig. 1).
Spot gas prices at the Henry Hub have
remained below $4/MMbtu, although
gas future prices and the large MMbtu
spread between oil and gas prices seem
to indicate that gas prices will rise (Fig.
2).
Fig. 3 shows the fall in the Baker
Hughes working rig count in the world
from a high of 3,557 rigs in October

Smith International shows some
rig counts unavailable in the Baker
Hughes statistics. For some countries,
the two counts are very different. This
article mainly uses the Baker Hughes
rigs counts although it also presents
some Smith International numbers. The
Smith International rig count of total
rigs operating worldwide for September
2009 of 3,444 is considerably more
than the
2,203 in
the Baker
Hughes
statistics.
The
Baker
Hughes
count outside of the US and Canada was
986 for September, up 39 from August
but down 22 from September 2008.
The number of working rigs outside the
US and Canada shows much less variance than the rig count for the US and
Canada (Fig. 4).

2008 to a low of 1,983 rigs in June
2009 and an increase to 2,203 working
rigs in September 2009.
In its world rig count, Baker Hughes
does not include land rigs drilling in
China and Russian as well as activity in
Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Sudan, and elsewhere.

2009, p. 6) includes a graph showing
the last 2 years of the Baker Hughes
working rig count for total world, total
onshore, and total offshore rigs. Also
shown is a graph that compares the
working rig count for the last 3 months
with the rig count in the previous year
for activity in the US and Canada.

said that horizontal well
permits for drilling in the
Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania have soared to 184 in
September, compared with

activity in seven counties:
Bradford County (36 horizontal permits), Tioga (31),
Washington (23), Clinton,

It indicated that environment issues

The decline
is partly attributed to Alberta’s new

into effect in January 2009, although
since then Alberta has put in place
some incentive programs for reducing
oil and gas royalties for small and midsize producers to spur drilling of wells
that otherwise would be uneconomical.
Most drilling in Canada is the
western provinces of Alberta, British
Columbia, and Saskatchewan. Because

drogen fluoride alkylation units have
been shut down over the last decade.
HF alkylation units require extremely high levels of maintenance to ensure
safe operation. Accidents have, in some
cases, convinced the refinery management to moth ball these units. Three
separate accidents involving HF releases
at US refineries occurred in a 5-month
span during 2009, leading to prolonged
shutdowns and investigations by the US
Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, Washington.2
Solid acid-catalyzed alkylation eliminates the hazard and costs associated
with using and regenerating corrosive
liquid acids such as HF. Solid acids have
for many years promised safer and
cleaner alkylation.3 The short lifetimes
of most solid acids, however, have
resulted in expensive processes with
complex reactors and large catalyst inventories, making them uncompetitive
with liquid acid technology. Competing
with liquid acids requires new solid
acids that are engineered for optimum
performance, rather than selected from

to the results of the study, capital costs

operating costs were unchanged.

Solid-acid catalyst
The new solid-acid catalyst (SAC) has
been engineered on multiple levels,5
as shown in Fig. 2. The catalyst particle shape and size are controlled to
provide the proper reaction environment by manipulating the rate of mass
transport into and out of the catalyst
pellet. In this way, the catalyst reduces
the constraints on the reactor design,
simplifying the process and reducing
overall cost.
The catalyst pore structure has been
optimized on both the macro and
microscale to enhance the diffusion of
large coke molecules out of the catalyst
pores, reducing catalyst deactivation
that results from pore blockage. The
strength and distribution of the active
catalyst sites have been tuned to promote alkylation over coke formation.
The active sites are adjusted to facilitate
formation of 2,3,3- and 2,3,4-trimethylpentane, both of which have octane
ratings greater than 100. Cracking

and isomerization to dimethylhexanes
(DMH) are minimized to maintain
high total alkylate octane.
The SAC also has the ability to
isomerize 1-butene to 2-butene, leading to higher alkylate octane rating
than produced by HF units when using
olefin feeds rich in 1-butene. Carefully tuning the catalyst properties at
multiple levels achieves all of the desired attributes: long life, high product
octane, and simple process design.

Process
Fig. 3 shows the new alkylation process using the engineered SAC process.6
Unique to solid acid-based processes
are the two multistaged fixed-bed reactors used in the reaction section. One
is used for reaction, while the other is
being regenerated.
The olefin stream is mixed with
isobutane returning from the distil-

lation section and with the reactor
effluent recirculation stream before
being fed to the reactor. The alkylation
reaction is mildly exothermic.
The robust catalyst is insensitive
to small changes in temperature and
hence the heat of reaction is removed
by a heat-exchanger located on the
recycle loop outside the reactor. Table 1
gives typical process conditions for the
solid-acid catalyst process.
The remaining portion of the
process replicates the function of the
fractionation section in the HF unit
but with reduced complexity. Because
the catalyst is a true solid acid, the acid
cannot migrate to other parts of the
process. As a result, acid neutralization
steps are not required. Maintenance
requirements are also reduced because
corrosion of critical devices, such as
emergency pressure-relief valves, is no
longer a concern.
The SAC process operates at temperatures greater than that of HF,
reducing the need for extensive cooling
of the reaction mixture. Consequently,
the reaction pressure must be elevated

slightly to maintain the reaction in a
liquid state. Feed ratio of isobutane to
olefin is the same or lower than HF
unit designs.
All alkylation catalysts, solid and
liquid, must be continuously regenerated. HF units perform the regeneration
through a combination of intense heating to decompose alkyl fluorides and
distillation to separate acid from heavy
hydrocarbons (coke).
For the SAC unit, catalyst regeneration is performed with a circulating
loop of hydrogen-hydrocarbon mixture
at an elevated temperature of 250° C.
This simple flow scheme (Fig. 4) results
in low capital costs and the ability to
retrofit existing plants readily.7
Alkylation cycle lengths are designed
to be between 12-24 hr to simplify
reactor operation. After the alkylation
cycle, the reactor is taken off stream
and the solid-acid catalyst is regenerated. During this time, the second
reactor maintains the constant alkylate
production. Due to the small amount

is suitable for this service and is reused.
The surge vessel is simply a holding
tank and requires no particular internals. The settler can be used without
modification for this purpose, which is
not significantly different from its current service.
• Separation zone. The distillation sections of the two units are identical and
operate at the same isobutane-to-olefin
ratio. Therefore, the existing isostripper
(main fractionator) and depropanizer
columns continue in their present services while unit capacity is maintained.
Column operation and maintenance
are simplified by eliminating the presence of HF in the columns. Product
purity specifications are maintained
because the column’s feed composition
and flow are unchanged by the revamp.
Smaller operations related to HF capture, such as the HF stripper, are idled.
• Product finishing zone. No leaching of
acid is possible from the SAC. Therefore, product washing and neutralization steps, including the defluorinator
and caustic (KOH) treaters are idled.
The solid waste generated from the
neutralization steps is also eliminated,
reducing operating cost and complexity. Product coolers and storage tanks
are retained in their current service.
• Regeneration zone. The equipment
needed for regenerating the SAC differs
from that used to regenerate HF. Many
pieces of equipment available in an HF
plant, however, can be modified for
use in the SAC regeneration cycle.
For example, the fired heater can
be used to raise the regeneration gas
stream to 250° C. The HF unit uses a
fired heater as a reboiler for the main
fractionator in order to achieve temperatures high enough to decompose
alkyl fluorides formed in the reactor.
Such high temperatures are no longer
required in the SAC process.
This fired heater can be reserviced
for the SAC regeneration and a new
reboiler installed in place of the fired
heater. The new reboiler can be steam
heated in order to reduce maintenance
and safety concerns.

Revamp cost
Table 2 gives equipment costs for
revamping a 3,000-b/d HF unit to a
SAC system. These costs were developed with in-house correlations and
algorithms, updated to second-quarter
2008 US Gulf Coast prices. Reactors and
supporting vessels are priced according
to a power-law dependence of the vessel mass. Heat exchangers are priced by
a scaled heat duty.
Compressor and pumps are fixed
price based on vendor estimates. Installation costs are calculated from typical
scale factors for each equipment type
and are summed at the bottom of the
table to provide an estimate for total
installed cost.
Table 2 shows that the single largest
expense, as expected, is for the new
reactor vessels. These reactors are the
heart of the new alkylation process. The
remaining cost is distributed evenly

errors in locating oil and gas pipelines.

increasingly include GPS
coordinates as part of a
one-call notification by
an excavator. GPS coordinates can help accurately
locate proposed excavations. Reliance on GPS
readings without a clear
understanding by all parties concerning
important settings and nomenclature
options, however, can lead to a false
sense of security and actually introduce
new errors into the one-call notice
process.

centers, similarly, should avoid accepting at face value whatever coordinates
are given over the phone and simply entering them into the computer
system, and line locators should avoid
assuming the GPS information they
receive is in a certain format or uses a
certain datum.
This article addresses three potential sources of GPS error: coordinate
nomenclature, datum selection, and accuracy, in the hope its use will further
understanding of these issues by all
parties involved in the one-call process.
A number of factors affect the accuracy of GPS readings, including the
number of satellites, the sophistication
of the GPS unit, etc. The accuracy of
particular information (i.e., ±29 ft, 58
ft, etc.), is obtained from typical GPS
units and frequently is shown on the
main screen along with latitude and
longitude coordinates. Users widely
hold accuracy information to be the
only source of error when using GPS
coordinates, resulting in a false sense of
security. This article shows accuracy to
be only one source of error, with other
less understood sources perhaps having
a much larger
effect on absolute
accuracy of a depicted location.

ly, such as: –30° 53’ 27.95”.
Another, equally accurate nomenclature uses degrees and decimal minutes,
without seconds (30 seconds being
equal to 0.5 decimal minutes). A third
popular nomenclature simply uses
decimal degrees (30 min being equal to
0.5 decimal degrees, and 30 sec being
equal to 0.008333 decimal degrees).
A GPS coordinate submitted in
degrees, minutes, seconds is much different than one submitted in degrees,
decimal minutes, which is much different than one submitted in decimal
degrees. The numbers may look the
same, however, and many times a set of
coordinate numbers could be feasible
in several different nomenclatures.

ent result (Fig. 2).
These plots use the same series of
digits (295030 and 955050) and both
lie within the greater Houston area,
regardless of nomenclature used, but
are more than 30 miles apart. The fact
that many GPS units fail to show on
their main screen which nomenclature
is being used can confuse one format
with another or create difficulties in
determining which a particular GPS
unit is using, leading to potentially
huge mapping errors.

Datum selection
A separate but related issue is the
selection of datum in the GPS unit. In
this context, a datum is a theoretical
model of the earth’s surface the GPS
coordinates reference against. A typical
Garmin GPS unit can be set to more
than 100 different datums, 11 starting
with NAD 27. Each of these datums
is different from the rest, reflecting
different models of the earth’s surface,
ovality, etc.
Few people are familiar with what
datum selection means or how to select
the correct one. They simply use the
default datum to which their unit was
set when purchased (or however the

on different points on the earth when
using different datums.
The National Imagery and Mapping Agency has published a document
(NIMA TR8350.2) listing parameters for
many geodetic datums. Some have exotic sounding names like Astro Tern Island (FRIG) 1961 or Pico de las Nieves,
while others carry more mundane
names like Geodetic Datum 1949 or Arc
1950. Setting the GPS receiver to one of
these datums shifts the measured coordinates anywhere from a few meters to
as much as 1,000 m from the nominal
WGS 84 datum of the GPS system
Plots of the center of the Texas State
Capitol dome, for example, with the
WGS 84 datum at longitude 97:44:25.19
West, and latitude 30:16:28.82 North as
the reference, often vary by more than
500 m from the intended location even
with the same coordinates.
The difference between common
datums in North America is usually
rather small (on the order of dozens of
feet, not miles), but even this degree
of error could be important for onecall purposes. Both NAD 27 and NAD
83 datums are widely used in North
America. The NAD 83 datum is newer,
but many companies and government
56

agencies (such as the US Department of
Interior, and the US Geological Survey)
still use NAD 27, and many maps use
that datum.
If someone submitted GPS data with
the coordinates shown in Fig. 3 and
plotted it with the NAD 83 datum (virtually identical to the WGS 84 datum,
the default for most GPS units), the
results would be as shown.
But the NAD 27 datum (the default
for USGS topographic maps) with the
same data represents a point on the
other side of the street in a different
back yard (Fig. 4). This difference,
though small in absolute terms, could
lead a utility operator to mistakenly
clear a one-call which in the belief the
proposed excavation would not affect
its facility.

Path forward
All parties involved in the one-call
process should understand the importance of GPS accuracy, nomenclature,
and datum selection, and establish procedures to avoid confusion concerning
these items. A recent API-AOPL Damage Prevention Workshop recommends
considering development of standard
GPS coordinate submittal guidelines to

increase the confidence in and reliability of GPS coordinates submitted
by excavators to one-call centers, and
transmitted from one-call centers to
locators.
Training all one-call centers on this
issue with a standardized coordinate
submittal criteria, and using a help
guide to talk people through how to
verify or change the datum and coordinate system settings on common GPS
equipment, would also eliminate much
of this confusion. An industry group
intends to work with the Common
Ground Alliance to modify existing
CGA best practices and establish new
best practices as necessary to address
these issues for all involved parties.
The Virginia Pilot Project for using
GPS coordinates in damage prevention
activities used NAD 83 as the datum
and decimal degrees as the format. The
National Pipeline Mapping System also
prefers NAD 83 and decimal degrees.
To maintain consistency with these
previous initiatives, the API-AOPL
work group specifically recommends
one-call systems adopt NAD 83 and
decimal degrees (with a minimum of
six decimal place digits) as the standard
GPS nomenclature for one-call use. The
WGS 84 datum (the default setting for
most GPS units) is virtually identical to
the NAD 83 datum throughout North
America and should also be accepted.
The work group also recommends onecall centers obtain and share the stated
accuracy of the GPS readings when taking information from excavators. ✦

Companies move
toward disclosure
in frac-fluid issue
In a simmering US political challenge to
the main method for completing gas wells
in shale, a secondary issue over proprietary information is starting to dissipate.
The larger threat is federal regulation of
hydraulic fracturing, refinements of which
have combined with horizontal drilling to
unlock the enormous potential of shales.
The oil and gas industry has used
hydraulic fracing for 60 years. Regulation

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

of the practice has occurred effectively at
lower levels of government.
But activist lawmakers and regulators
want to impose federal regulation. The
producing industry, wary of new delays
and costs, says that level of oversight isn’t
necessary.
In support of a new layer of regulation,
environmental groups and their friends in
government are planting fear in a public
mostly unaware of the technique before
overblown warnings emerged that it
dooms drinking water.
Their regulatory push includes an effort
to require disclosure of frac-fluid composition.
At first, the industry opposed the idea.
An important element of competition
among frac service providers is fluid performance, which depends greatly on ingredients. Disclosing fluid composition would
be like giving away company secrets.
At the end of September, however,
Schlumberger Ltd. said it was asking suppliers for permission to report chemicals
used in its frac fluids. A month later,
Chesapeake Energy Corp. supported disclosure and posted on its web site a list of
chemicals in fluids used to frac its wells.
In rapidly developing US shale plays,
both companies are heavyweights.
They also worked together on a
Louisiana well near where 17 cattle died
last April after drinking water thought to
contain spilled frac fluid. So they have
first-hand experience with the readiness
of opponents to use an incident like that to
incite alarm.
Because fear of fracing is largely fear
of the unknown, information should be a
prime antidote. Against determined opposition, however, it’s never guaranteed
to work.
Understandably, many companies
abhor the idea of tipping their proprietary
hands on frac fluids.
Given recent events, however, and in
view of the broader effort to regulate if not
stifle hydraulic fracing, it’s an idea whose
time already may have arrived.

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Aramco switches from WTI benchmark
Starting with its January sales program, Saudi Aramco, national oil company of
Saudi Arabia, will switch from West Texas Intermediate to an index of Gulf Coast
sour crudes as the benchmark for pricing its oil for sale in the US market.
Aramco will use Argus Media Ltd.’s Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI) in pricing its
Extra Light, Arab Light, Arab Medium, and Arab Heavy crudes, which are heavier
and have higher sulfur content than WTI. That index, launched in May, uses the
volume-weighted average of daily spot sales of the Mars, Poseidon, and Southern
Green Canyon crudes.
Aramco’s move is “more of an evolutionary smoothing out of distortions,
rather than…a dramatic change in the dynamics of the US crude market,” said Paul
Horsnell at Barclays Capital in London. He sees it as “a form of insurance” against
volatility caused by WTI price dislocations. Usually, Gulf crudes and WTI prices
move “pretty much in line.” However, distortions caused by logistical or inventory
constraints at its pricing point in Cushing, Okla., can dislocate WTI prices away
from North Sea Brent and US gulf crude prices.
Aramco’s switch to ASCI sparked speculation other exporters of sour crude to
the US may change over. But the move should not be interpreted as a rejection of
WTI’s general role as market leader, Horsnell said.
“US gulf crudes tend to be assessed in terms of differentials to WTI, rather
than as separate centers of independent price discovery, and we expect that to
continue,” he said, adding, “Should an active OTC or futures market based on
ASCI eventually arise, then the dynamics could change. However, establishing
futures contracts based on delivered US gulf sours has proved very problematic
in the past and is still very far from an inevitable development. Indeed, the current
regulatory climate is not exactly ideal for any innovative development of new OTC
or formal exchange based oil derivatives.”
The New York Mercantile Exchange has tried to establish a benchmark US gulf
sour crude contract for trade since the early 1990s. Now NYMEX officials say they
will launch a futures contract based on the Argus index before Aramco makes its
change.
Saudi pricing formulas
For more than 20 years, Saudi crudes imported into the US on term contracts
have been priced against a benchmark averaged 50 days after the time of loading
and adjusted by a differential declared in advance for the month plus freight cost
adjustments. “Until the January 1994 sales program, the marker used was Alaskan
North Slope (ANS) as delivered into the US gulf. After a period in which holders
of term contracts grew dissatisfied with the dynamics of ANS prices, WTI forward
prices were introduced instead,” Horsnell said. “Given that past changes in the
mechanics of the formula have primarily been the result of representations from
term contract holders, it seems safe to see the change as reflecting a wide discontent within the US oil industry about the performance of WTI during those periods
of dislocation.”
At its inception, ASCI said it will use WTI as a basis for its price assessments,
with the WTI basis following the NYMEX light sweet crude contract.
Bloomberg News reported Mars Blend crude for December trading at a $3.10/
bbl discount to WTI at Cushing in late October. Discounts for Poseidon and
Southern Green Canyon crudes were $3.05 and $3.95, respectively. On the US
spot market, WTI at Cushing was down $2.87 to $77/bbl Oct. 30 in lock-step with
the December futures contract on NYMEX. Brent for the same month lost $2.84 to
$75.20/bbl. The average price for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ basket of 12 reference crudes, including Saudi Arabia’s Arab Light, was down
38¢ to $75.56/bbl that day.
“To some extent the growth in prominence of ASCI is as much a challenge to
Brent as it is to WTI,” Horsnell said. “Before, Brent was the only benchmark that
had a claim to being the best gauge for Atlantic crude pricing during periods when
the US Midcontinent pricing decoupled. Now there is another potential claimant,
albeit one that so far lacks the panoply of OTC and derivative markets and liquidity
that are necessary to lay a claim to being a center of price discovery rather than
one of price reflection.”
In Europe and the Mediterranean, Aramco prices its crude against the Brentweighted average posted by the International Petroleum Exchange in London. In
Asia, it relies on the average of two Persian Gulf benchmarks of Oman and Dubai
grades of crude.

Exhibit Today
Expanding Sustainably
Growth requires the oil sands and heavy oil industry to make steady, long-term
progress along a narrow road for which no map exists.
On one side loom the high costs of extracting, processing, and transporting
unconventional hydrocarbons.
On the other side are environmental performance standards that toughen with
time and that the industry never must fail to meet.
Each step along this road requires innovation. Each must withstand
unpredictable economic changes. Each must uphold eternal values of nature
and society.

On this road, the beacon for progress is technology, advances in which will
control the costs, improve the environmental performance, and assure the
sustainability of an industry crucial to oil supplies – now and in the future.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the
premier showcase for the knowledge and methods of this fascinating business.
Take this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential
audience. Join PennWell Petroleum Events in this fourth year conference and
exhibition.

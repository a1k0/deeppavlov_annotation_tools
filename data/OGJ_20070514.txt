COVER
Scientists from industry, government, and universities are studying
the potential for geologic sequestration of CO2 emitted by industrial plants. A special report article, starting on p. 20, discusses
some of the research being done under a US Department of Energy
program. The cover photo shows Battelle scientists preparing to
drill an 8,000 ft test well at FirstEnergy‚Äôs R.E. Burger plant to
evaluate CO2 storage potential in the Appalachian basin. Drilling
was completed in February. Battelle is the lead organization for the
Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership.The drilling
rig shown on the top of this page is AEP‚Äôs Mountaineer Plant in
West Virginia. Under a separate DOE-funded initiative, Battelle
scientists also drilled the first test well at a coal-fired plant to
determine CO2 storage potential in the Camrian rocks in the Appalachian basin. Photos from Battelle.

Improve UK North Sea safety standards, BP told
The UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has ordered BP PLC
to carry out a major audit of its safety practices for operations at
its platforms in the UK North Sea, raising fresh fears about the
company‚Äôs safety culture.
HSE in March served BP with an improvement notice that required it to improve its operations and show that it is meeting
health and safety regulations after a series of safety concerns on
the Schiehallion floating production and storage facility, 150 miles
west of Shetland. Within the past year, BP received 14 safety standards notices, and it has complied with 10 of them.
UK unions for oil and gas workers were unsurprised at the
news, stressing that they have been campaigning for an improved
safety culture in the UK North Sea for some time and that investment is needed to maintain oil and gas infrastructure, particularly
as energy prices currently are so high.
HSE said over the past year it has served 51 improvement notices and nine prohibition notices on various platforms and other
companies in the UK sector of the North Sea.
The HSE notices for BP, however, come amid a company-wide
review of its operations following harsh criticisms of its safety
practices in the Baker report published earlier this year, which examined the Texas City, Tex., refinery fire that killed 15 people in
March 2005. Last year BP also was forced to close in oil production
from its Alaska Prudhoe Bay field because of pipeline corrosion.
BP has appointed independent expert Duane Wilson, a retired
ConocoPhillips vice-president for refining and marketing, to lead
its safety improvements in wake of the Baker report.
Tony Hayward, BP‚Äôs new chief executive, who took over the
company earlier this month, is expected to make safety an important part of his agenda in the early part of his tenure.

age in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, in the Bristol Bay area off Alaska‚Äôs
coast, and in the Atlantic Ocean off southeastern Virginia.
She also presided over 16 OCS sales and initiated royalty compliance program reforms to make it more effective and eliminate
delays.
Burton was criticized when it was discovered that federal Gulf
of Mexico deepwater leases issued by MMS in 1998 and 1999 did
not contain price thresholds on their royalty exemptions.
Pointing out to angry members of Congress that the omissions
took place during the Clinton administration, Burton ordered MMS
to approach leaseholders and ask them to voluntarily negotiate new
terms. Several leaseholders have done this, and talks with others are
continuing.

Attacks on Nigeria oil workers continue
Some 12 foreign oil workers have been abducted in Nigeria in
several separate overnight attacks, according to local government
and company officials. The latest attacks followed one on May 1
in which armed militants killed one man and took six others hostage.
The most recent attacks, for which no group has claimed responsibility, include an unemployed Dutch oil worker kidnapped
from a bar in the southern town of Warri, three South Korean executives and eight Filipino workers seized from a Daewoo construction site in Rivers state after a gunfight, and five people taken from
Eni‚Äôs Mystras floating production, storage, and offloading vessel.
On May 2, Chevron Corp. shut down 15,000 b/d of oil production in Nigeria after a Nigerian sailor was killed and six foreign oil
workers kidnapped by members of the militant group Movement
for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta. The militants attacked
Chevron‚Äôs Oloibiri FPSO off southern Bayelsa State on May 1 (OGJ
Online, May 2, 2007).

MMS Director Johnnie Burton to retire
US Minerals Management Service Director Johnnie Burton announced that she will retire at the end of May.
Burton, who became MMS director in March 2002, told Department of the Interior Sec. Dirk A. Kempthorne in her May 7
resignation letter that the job ‚Äúhas been the most rewarding, and
often the most challenging, of my career.‚Äù
Her successor has not been named. Burton will be the second
US DOI agency chief involved with federal oil and gas resource
management to leave in the last year.
US Bureau of Land Management Director Kathleen Clarke resigned on Dec. 28, 2006, to rejoin her family in Utah.
Burton‚Äôs primary accomplishment as MMS director was completion of a 5-year federal Outer Continental Shelf leasing plan
from July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2012, that includes new acre-

Japan to greatly increase products exports
Japan will increase exports of petroleum products by as much
as 50% this year due to a decline‚Äîfor the fourth year running‚Äîin
domestic demand for fuel oil. The demand drop was caused by the
increased use of natural gas by industry, as well as sales of hybridelectric cars and other low-consumption products.
Nippon Oil Corp. will try to double its petroleum exports to
2.35 million kl, as well as increase contract production for a major
Chinese oil firm by 20% to 2.2 million kl. That will give Nippon
overall exports of 4.55 million kl, a 50% increase. Cosmo Oil Co.
plans to raise its exports by 40% to 1.44 million kl/year, largely by
selling jet fuel and diesel in the US market.
Meanwhile, Taiyo Oil Co. and other midsize oil distributors reportedly will upgrade or create export facilities to step up their
overseas shipments. Taiyo will upgrade the ship-loading pumps at

Premier rig to work over, drill Anoa Ô¨Åeld wells

BowLeven respuds D-1 wildcat off Cameroon

Premier Oil PLC, after plugging and abandoning its Gajah Sumatera-1 exploration well on Natuna Sea Block A in Indonesia, is
moving the Seadrill-5 rig to Anoa field to carry out a workover on
an existing well. It will then drill a development well to exploit oil
discovered last year in Anoa‚Äôs Central Lobe.
Last September, the company drilled an appraisal well into a
new fault block on Anoa field and found a 67 ft column with an
overlying 80 ft gas column that it said could greatly increase oil
production.
Premier Chief Executive Simon Lockett said, ‚ÄúThe Seadrill-5
now moves on to development activity to support existing gas sales
contracts into Singapore and to exploit the oil discovered in 2006
in the Central Lobe of Anoa.‚Äù
The abandoned Gajah Sumatera-1 exploration well drilled a
structure adjacent to Gajah Puteri field, reaching a TD of 2,387 m.
It had ‚Äúsome gas shows,‚Äù Premier said, but no significant hydrocarbons.

BowLeven PLC, Edinburgh, has respudded its D-1 exploration
well on Block MLHP 5 off Cameroon because of mechanical and
well-control problems at the first location.
The well is to reach 10,000 ft TD in 8 weeks to target Upper
Miocene channelized turbidite sands that could be similar to hydrocarbon-bearing formations found by Noble Energy 10 km
downdip in the 0-1 Belinda discovery in Equatorial Guinea (OGJ
Online, July 7, 2006).
The original D-1 location was 37 km from a power plant at
Limbe, which is proposed as a hub for gas exports to Equatorial
Guinea and its LNG plant under construction on Bioko Island (OGJ
Online, Feb. 19, 2007).
BowLeven has a 100% interest in Cameroon‚Äôs Etinde permit
area, which holds three shallow-water blocks: MLHP 5, MLHP
6, and MLHP 7. They cover 2,300 sq km in the Rio del Rey and
Douala basins.

Centrica awarded stake in Block 2AB off Trinidad
OGDC Ô¨Ånds gas, condensate in Pakistan
Oil & Gas Development Co. Ltd. (OGDC) has found gas and
condensate in its exploratory well Kunnar West No. 1A in the Kunnar mining lease area in Pakistan.
The well reached a TD of 4,065 m targeting two zones of Massive Sands of the Cretaceous Lower Goru formation. The first tested 11.02 MMcfd of gas and 170 b/d of 44¬∞ gravity condensate
through a 32‚ÅÑ64-in. choke.
The well is 577 m west of Kunnar West Well No. 1.
‚ÄúThe potential of additional Zone-2 (Massive Sand) of Lower
Goru formation in the well will be tested shortly,‚Äù OGDC said.

Centrica PLC, parent of British Gas, said the Trinidad and Tobago
Energy Ministry has awarded it a share of an offshore license as part
of its bid in the Trinidad and Tobago onshore and shallow water
bid rounds.
Centrica will have a 32.5% interest in offshore Block 2AB near
the Trinidad and Tobago coast and existing LNG export facilities.
Centrica will partner with Tullow Oil PLC, operator and holder
of a 32.5% stake in the license, and with state-owned Petrotrin
35%.
Trinidad and Tobago is one of the largest exporters of LNG in
the Atlantic Basin, currently accounting for about 80% of LNG imported into the US, said Centrica.

Putumayo well gauges natural oil Ô¨Çows
Gran Tierra Energy Inc., Calgary, gauged natural oil flows on
tests of the Cretaceous Lower and Middle Caballos formations at
its Juanambu-1 exploration well on the Guayuyaco Block in the
Putumayo basin of southern Colombia.
Four more zones were to be tested, including shallower Cretaceous Villeta T sand, the well‚Äôs primary objective.
The Caballos tests yielded stabilized flows of 32¬∞ gravity oil
with constant wellhead flowing pressure. Further details were to
be released on completion of the remaining tests. Most wells in the
basin require pumping.
Working interests are Gran Tierra 50% and Solana Resources
Ltd. 50%. State Ecopetrol has a 30% back-in right, which would
reduce the companies‚Äô respective interests to 35% each.

PNG offshore licensing round draws one bid
Just one application has been received for the much-heralded
offshore Papua New Guinea licensing round (OGJ Online, Sept.
22, 2006).
The apparent interest from 15 groups that bought bid packages
last year for blocks in the Gulf of Papua, Papuan Plateau, Moresby
Trough, and parts of the Coral Sea seems to have evaporated.
PNG authorities said they will process the lone application and
reserve the other blocks for competitive application and appropriate work program bids at any time. ‚ú¶

Talisman appraisal well off Vietnam successful
Talisman (Vietnam 15-2/01) Ltd. has drilled a sidetrack appraisal
well into its Hai Su Trang (HST) discovery made earlier this year on
Block 15-2/01 in the Cuu Long basin off eastern Vietnam.
The sidetrack penetrated the HST structure about 1.1 km northeast of the original discovery location. It was drilled to a TMD of
3,342 m and encountered 51 m of net oil pay at a structural elevation similar to that of the discovery well.
Downhole well logging and sampling confirmed the presence
and quality of the same oil-bearing zones tested in the original
HST discovery well. As a result, Talisman and its partner, PetroVietnam Exploration & Production Co., anticipate moving quickly to
full field development.
Talisman Pres. and Chief Executive Jim Buckee said the HST appraisal well also encountered new zones structurally higher in the
section.
Thang Long Joint Operating Co. (TLJOC), a special purpose
company established for conducting all operations on Block 152/01, plans to begin drilling three new exploration wells in third
quarter to evaluate a very exciting basement structure. The company also expects to drill on two more of the many Miocene-Oligocene clastic prospects that are on trend with the HST discovery.
Additional exploration drilling is anticipated beyond 2007, Talisman said.
TLJOC is preparing a reserves assessment report for a joint area
project development plan. Talisman said discussions will be ongoing with the operators of the Te Giac Trang (TGT) discovery on
adjacent Block 16-1. Talisman recently completed a successful sidetrack into the TGT Block 16-1 structure to determine how much it
extends into Block 15-2/01 (OGJ Online, Jan. 18, 2007).

Statoil shuts in Kvitebj√∏rn gas, condensate

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

Kvitebj√∏rn field in the Norwegian North Sea because of low pressure in the reservoir during the company‚Äôs complex drilling program.
A Statoil spokesman told OGJ the company had produced the
field at about 50% of its 190,000 boe/d capacity since late December.
‚ÄúThe operation‚Äôs complexity and adaptation of necessary new
technology has led to an extension of the drilling program and
resulted in further pressure fall in the reservoir,‚Äù Statoil said.
Statoil plans to restart production during the fourth quarter.
Statoil is operator of the license with 43.55% interest; other
partners are Petoro AS 30%, Norsk Hydro AS 15%, Royal Dutch
Shell PLC 6.45%, and Total SA 5%.

Umuroa FPSO on site off New Zealand
The floating production, storage, and offloading vessel for the
$245 million Tui oil development has arrived on location on the
PMP 38158 permit 50 km off Taranaki on New Zealand‚Äôs North
Island.
The Umuroa FPSO, owned by Prosafe of Norway, is being leased
for an initial 5 years to the Tui joint venture, operated by Australian
Worldwide Exploration Ltd. of Sydney. The group has an option to
retain the vessel for a further 5 years.
Umuroa is capable of handling up to 120,000 b/d of fluids,
including 50,000 b/d of oil from the Tui project. It has a storage
capacity of 730,000 bbl.
Oil is expected on stream at the end of June from Tui, Amokura,
and Pateke accumulations. Flow will be via four subsea wellheads
and flowlines connected to the FPSO.
Permit interest holders are AWE 42.5%, New Zealand Oil & Gas
Ltd. 12.5%, Mitsui E&P New Zealand 35%, and Pan Pacific Petroleum Ltd. of Sydney 10%. ‚ú¶

Processing
Husky to buy Valero‚Äôs Lima, Ohio, reÔ¨Ånery
Husky Energy Inc. has agreed to buy a 165,000 b/d refinery in
Lima, Ohio, from Valero Energy Corp.
Husky Pres. and Chief Executive Officer John C. S. Lau said the
company would integrate the refinery with ‚Äúfuture growth of
heavy crude oil and oil sands production.‚Äù
The company produces more than 100,000 b/d of heavy oil in
the Lloydminster region of Alberta and Saskatchewan and last year
started production from the Tucker oil sands project in the Cold
Lake area. Tucker output is to reach 30,000 b/d.
Husky operates a 28,000-b/d asphalt refinery in the Lloydminster area that also produces distillate used in a heavy-oil upgrader
and condensate blended with heavy oil production. It also operates
a 12,000-b/d light oil refinery in Prince George, BC, and ethanol
plants in Minnedosa, Man., and Lloydminster.
For the Lima refinery it will pay $1.9 billion plus net working
capital estimated at $200 million.
According to Oil & Gas Journal‚Äôs latest Worldwide Report, the

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s
refinery‚Äôs processing capacities include delayed coking 20,700 b/cd,
fluid catalytic cracking 36,000 b/d, catalytic reforming 49,500 b/

p. 56).

GS Caltex sees 2010 start for Oman reÔ¨Ånery
GS Caltex Corp. in 2010 will begin operating the 120,000 b/d
refinery it has completed for state-owned Sohar Refinery Co. (SRC)
in Oman.
GS Caltex‚Äîa 50-50 joint venture of South Korea‚Äôs GS Holdings
and Chevron Corp.‚Äîwill operate the plant and transfer technical
knowledge on refining for a royalty of $50 million from SRC.
Located in Sohar, a port city 240 km northwest of Muscat, the
refinery has a 75,000 b/d residual fluid catalytic cracker. It will
supply naphtha and propylene to a large petrochemical complex
under construction nearby (OGJ, June 6, 2005, Newsletter).

Indian Oil to participate in Iraq oil projects
Iraq has invited India‚Äôs largest refiner, Indian Oil Corp. (IOC),
to establish refineries in war-torn Iraq and to participate in other
downstream projects.
Indian Petroleum Minister Murli Deora and Iraqi Oil Minister
Hussain Al-Shahristani met recently to exchange views on a host of
such mutually beneficial projects.
Discussions revolved around the participation of two Indian
state-owned enterprises in Iraq‚Äôs oil and gas sector‚Äîrefiner IOC

in downstream projects, and explorer-producer ONGC Videsh
Ltd. (OVL) in Iraq‚Äôs upstream sector. OVL and Reliance Industries
both have expressed interest in entering Iraq‚Äôs oil exploration sector.
OVL, Reliance, and Algeria‚Äôs Sonatrach had been in talks with
the Saddam Hussein regime before United Nations‚Äô forces assumed
control over Iraq in 2000. The talks were interrupted by UN sanctions after 2000.
Iraq has proved oil reserves of 112 billion bbl, which makes it
the world‚Äôs second largest oil nation behind Saudi Arabia. ‚ú¶

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Sinotrans to store, ship oil for Sinochem
China‚Äôs Sinotrans Group Corp. said it will begin providing global oil shipping and logistics services to Sinochem Corp.
Under an agreement signed Apr. 18, Sinotrans said it will provide Sinochem with oil transportation by sea, air, rail, and road
as well as storage services, all aimed at increasing efficiency and
lowering costs.
The Sinotrans statement, which did not stipulate the amounts
the firm will transport, follows an Apr. 17 oil products shipping
contract between China National Petroleum Corp. and Nanjing Oil
Shipping Group, a subsidiary of China Chang Jiang National Shipping Group.
Under that contract, Nanjing will transport 600,000 tonnes of
oil products in 2007, using 30,000-40,000 dwt tankers. Nanjing
currently has nine product tankers and will increase its capacity
through a further 24 vessels to be constructed by 2010.
The transport agreements are consistent with Chinese government policy, which promotes use of domestic shipping firms to
curb foreign currency outlays and to assume a tighter grip of the
country‚Äôs energy supply chain.

CNOOC-ConocoPhillips FPSO hull complete
China National Offshore Oil Co. Ltd. (CNOOC) has completed
the hull of the country‚Äôs largest floating production, storage, and
offloading unit.
The FPSO, called Offshore Oil 117, is a joint venture of CNOOC
and ConocoPhillips China Inc. It can store 2 million bbl of crude
and can process more than 190,000 b/d.
The finished hull will be shipped to Singapore from Shanghai
for completion of the unit‚Äôs topsides before being deployed by
the end of 2008 to the Penglai 19-3 project in China‚Äôs Bohai
Sea.
The second phase of Penglai 19-3 is expected to go into production at yearend 2008 and produce 180,000 boe/d of oil.

JBIC loan enables ADNOC oil expansions
A $1 billion loan offered by the Japan Bank for International
Cooperation to Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. is designed to secure
stable supplies of crude oil to Japan while enabling ADNOC to
expand existing fields, develop new ones, and improve production and oil transportation capabilities.
The loan‚Äî70% from JBIC and 30% from Japanese commer10

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

cial banks‚Äîis being offered on condition that Abu Dhabi ensures
steady exports of its crude oil to Japan.
ADNOC, along with repaying the loan, is expected to sign a
long-term deal to export crude oil to Japanese oil companies over
a 10-year period.
Four Japanese companies, including Japan Oil Development Co.,
are currently operating off Abu Dhabi, and the UAE is home to
nearly half of the oil fields that Japanese companies are developing
independently.
To ensure the security of its oil exports, Abu Dhabi is planning a
360-km pipeline that will bypass the Strait of Hormuz by carrying
more than 1 million b/d of crude oil from production areas inside
the Persian Gulf to the East coast port of Fujairah.
The UAE accounts for about 25% of Japan‚Äôs total crude oil imports, about 95% of that coming from Abu Dhabi. The UAE also
exports about 90% of its LNG production to Japan, according to
the US Energy Information Administration.

Kalimantan-Java pipelay must start by July
The Indonesian government, reiterating an earlier warning, said
it will revoke the special right granted to PT Bakrie & Brothers
to build a 1,200-km natural gas pipeline from East Kalimantan to
Central Java unless the company starts construction in July.
Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro
said Bakrie, after winning the tender in July 2006, had been given
1 year to start work on the 15-trillion-rupiah ($1.65 million) project. He said Bakrie must have signed contracts with gas producers
in East Kalimantan and consumers in Java by July 2007.
In March Tubagus Haryono, head of upstream oil and gas regulatory body BP Migas, also had warned that the right, which Bakrie
won in last year‚Äôs tender, would be reviewed if the company fails to
start construction by July.
At the time, however, Bakrie Finance Director Yuanita Rohali
said the company was awaiting publication of a government report on the country‚Äôs gas balance, and the company had decided
not to go ahead with the venture without a guaranteed supply
of gas. Many industry officials earlier had cast doubts about the
feasibility of the project due to declining gas reserves in East Kalimantan. ‚ú¶

America‚Äôs oil and gas operations
produce about 14 billion barrels of
water each year. While some of it is
too salty to have practical uses, much
is not, and with modern puriÔ¨Åcation
technology a lot of this produced
water represents a valuable natural
resource ‚Ä¶ usable in Ô¨Åeld production,
agricultural and industrial applications.

Subsea advances in prospect

Guntis Moritis
Production Editor
An array of new technologies either
commercial or nearly commercial is set
to improve recovery from fields with
subsea-completed wells.
The recent Offshore Technology
Conference highlighted several technologies, including those for lowering
subsea drilling and operations costs
as well as those for subsea processing, multiphase boosting, and wet-gas
compression.

Statoil
Statoil ASA has several initiatives for
improving oil recovery from subsea-completed fields. Statoil‚Äôs average
recovery from these fields is 45.1%, but
presentations at OTC said the company
aims to increase this by 10% to move
closer to the 60% recovery factor for its
fields completed with dry-tree wells off
platforms.
One of its nearly complete projects
is the deployment of a subsea processing station at Tordis field off Norway
(OGJ, May 7, 2007, p. 20). Developed
by Kongsberg FMC and scheduled
for installation in August, the station
includes a separation vessel, desander,
and injection pump for removing and
disposing of most of the water and sand
into an injection well as well as a multiphase booster pump for moving the oil,
gas, and remaining bs&w to topsides
processing.
With this subsea installation, Statoil expects the field‚Äôs recovery factor to increase
to 55% from the current 49%, which
equates to an additional 35 million bbl of
oil during the next 15-17 years.

Statoil is also lowering the costs of
drilling and completing subsea wells. Its
R&D efforts have developed a riserless
light-well intervention vessel for reducing by one-third the costs of wireline
service previously done from a semisubmersible. The vessel will be ready for
work in 2008 and will operate at a cost
of $150,000/day.
Another technology Statoil expects will reduce subsea well costs is
through-tubing rotary drilling equipment placed on a dynamically positioned rig. The technology will allow
sidetracks to be drilled in subsea wells
for additional drainage. Statoil expects
the system to be operational in 2007
and estimates that each sidetrack will
cost $10 million.
Statoil plans to install a subsea raw
seawater injection pump to support
the reservoir pressure in Tyrihans oil
field from Day 1. It expects Tyrihans to
start producing in 2009, depending on
processing capacity on the Kristin field
semisubmersible production unit.
The company also is involved in
developing subsea wet-gas compression
and may start deploying the technology
in 2011-12.
Last year Norsk Hydro, which now
is part of Statoil, awarded Aker Kvaerner
a contract for a subsea compression
pilot for Ormen Lange gas and condensate field in the Norwegian Sea. Aker
Kvaerner expects a final decision on the
deployment in 2011.

Cameron‚Äôs CAMFORCE subsea processing system, which includes a CurtissWright Flow Control Corp. and Leistriz
AG subsea twin-screw multiphase
pump, an all-electric separation unit,
and a multiple application reinjection
system (MARS). BP will install the first
MARS on King oil field in the Gulf of
Mexico.
Cameron describes MARS as a USB
(Universal Serial Bus) port for subsea
completions that allows installation
of multiple processing technologies
directly onto the subsea completion
without disturbance to existing equipment. These technologies include such
components as boosting, metering, and
well stimulation.

Petrobras

Petrobras is another company with
plans to deploy more subsea technology in several fields off Brazil, especially
in those with limited deck space for
additional processing equipment. As
with Statoil in Tordis field, Petrobras
has needs for separating out water from
the oil subsea and reinjecting the water
into disposal wells as well as for subsea
boosting of the produced oil.
One problem it faces is the breaking of oil-water emulsions from fields
producing heavy oil, such as the 20¬∞
gravity oil from Marlim field.
Presentations at OTC said Petrobras
expects to implement subsea processing
off Brazil in the next 5 years, with such
mature fields as Marlim and Pampo

The energy rip-off
The senators are new to their jobs, and their
bone-headed energy bill won‚Äôt go far. But mischief
isn‚Äôt harmless just because it comes from inexperience.
‚ÄúIt is long overdue for the United State Congress to summon up the courage to stand up to
the oil industry, one of the most powerful lobbies
in Washington, DC, and to say very clearly, ‚ÄòStop
ripping off the American people,‚Äô‚Äù said Sen. Bernie
Sanders (I-Vt.) while explaining why he joined
seven first-term Democrats supporting a bill for a
‚Äúwindfall profit‚Äù tax on oil companies. Another of
the senators, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, said,
‚ÄúOil companies have been ripping us off over and
over and over again, and this is going to stop.‚Äù
The bill‚Äôs sponsor, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania,
observed: ‚ÄúThe Bush administration has let the oil
companies run the pump for too long without any
real investment in renewable fuels.‚Äù Complaining
that Pennsylvanian gasoline prices have increased
‚Äúwhile oil companies continue to make billions
in profits,‚Äù Casey said his bill would ‚Äúincrease our
energy independence while providing relief at the
pump and taking away taxpayer subsidies for big
oil.‚Äù

What‚Äôs overdue
If anything is ‚Äúoverdue,‚Äù it‚Äôs mature energy
discussion free of repeatedly discredited accusations and ideas. Uninformed energy pronouncements, full of invective falsehood, are too common
in Washington. They lead to too many mistakes,
which are heaping too many unwarranted costs
onto Americans.
Casey‚Äôs bill, embracing concepts espoused by
Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) last year, would do
just that (OGJ, June 12, 2006, p. 19). In elegant
conflict with its purported aims, the proposal
would lower energy independence and elevate
oil prices. Its ‚Äúwindfall profit‚Äù tax would discourage development of US oil and gas supply. And its
closing of ‚Äútax loopholes‚Äù‚Äîin the description of
which Casey mistakes deductions for credits‚Äî
would aggravate the effect. That damage would be
minor, though, because the so-called loopholes
aren‚Äôt the lavish subsidies Casey portrays them to
be. In further subversion of the proposal‚Äôs stated
goals, channeling proceeds of the tax measures

to renewable energy and poor people would rush
overpriced energy into the market and stimulate
consumption.
This riot of contradiction should collapse under
serious analysis. But it threatens to evade serious
analysis by connecting with the enduring hatred
many Americans feel toward oil companies. When
junior senators who seem to know nothing about
energy speak of oil companies ‚Äúripping off‚Äù consumers, they and their bad ideas capture attention
they don‚Äôt deserve. Oil companies therefore need to
take accusations like this seriously and address them
whenever and from whatever sources they arise.
Americans believe the rip-off myth because
they hear it repeatedly. So the response bears
repeating: Markets determine oil prices; companies don‚Äôt. The market is too big and has too many
buyers and sellers, all of them in competition with
one another, to allow manipulation by any single
company or group. Even the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, with its strong influence over oil supply, can‚Äôt manipulate prices to
the extent Americans seem to believe. If OPEC, oil
companies, or any other source of supply held that
kind of market control, oil prices wouldn‚Äôt have
languished at levels that crimped suppliers‚Äô profits
throughout the latter 1980s and 1990s.

Suppliers‚Äô proÔ¨Åts
Prices are not now elevated because of sinister
manipulation that has somehow come into force.
They‚Äôre elevated because expanding demand has
encountered physical limits to supply. It‚Äôs no ripoff that suppliers of a supply-constrained market
profit from the inevitably increased prices. Are

Global climate change presents
challenges associated with balancing
potential environmental impacts with
a wide variety of economic, technical, and lifestyle changes that may be
necessary to address the issue. Carbon
dioxide emissions from the use of fossil
fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas
are the largest anthropogenic contributor to greenhouse gases, which are
believed to contribute
to climate change. The

cus of this article, CO2 is captured, compressed, transported by pipeline, and
injected into deep reservoirs, such as
saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs,
and coal seams. This option is amenable
to reduction of CO2 emissions from
point sources such as power plants and
refineries. Such point sources contribute
about half of the CO2 emissions.
Before the CO2 can be injected into a
deep geologic reservoir, it first must be
captured in a concentrated form from
a fossil fuel-fired process such as those
used for power generation or petroleum
refining. Capturing CO2 in a nearly
pure form is necessary to minimize the

and, thus, slow climate change.
Carbon sequestration is one class of
carbon management technologies. It
involves permanently sequestering and
storing CO2 in the earth. There are two
broad classes of sequestration: terrestrial
and geologic.
Terrestrial sequestration involves
absorbing CO2 from the air using biologic materials such as crops, trees, and
grasses. Ultimately, the carbon is transferred to the soil in which the biologic
materials grow. By optimizing the way
we manage our land, we can do much
to optimize the effectiveness of terrestrial sequestration around the globe. In
geologic sequestration, the primary fo20

the CO2 can be compressed to a supercritical state. A number of pathways are
currently available or under development for CO2 capture. For example, in
post-combustion capture, CO2 can be
scrubbed or otherwise removed from
the flue gas after combustion of fossil
fuels. However, this flue gas stream is
relatively dilute, usually less than 15%
by volume, making capture difficult and
expensive. Commercial processes exist
today for doing this based on absorption of CO2 from the flue gas with
monoethanolamine (MEA). However,
the cost of capture due to the steam and
energy requirements for the process
makes it too expensive to be feasible for
retrofit to existing plants in an efficient

manner. A number of improved processes are under development, including advanced MEA processes and more
recently the ammonia-based capture,
but these will require time to develop
and commercialize.
Another option is to separate the
CO2 before combustion, precombustion
capture. By first using a process called
gasification, such as in integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) processes
for power generation, fossil fuels such
as coal and biomass can be converted
into hydrogen and other components
that can be used directly as a fuel or
converted into other fuels such as those
used for transportation today. Gasification can facilitate CO2 capture by creating a relatively pure and concentrated
CO2 stream. The FutureGen project,
funded jointly by government and
industry, will utilize IGCC technology
with the goal to build a near zero-emission coal-based power plant, including
geologic sequestration of CO2.The site
for FutureGen has been narrowed to either Illinois or Texas. Final site selection
is expected to be announced this year.
Another combustion type is oxycombustion, which uses oxygen instead
of air for combustion of fossil fuels in
boilers, furnaces, and other processes
and produces flue gas with a high
concentration of CO2 with the intent of
facilitating its capture.
With the ongoing research and
development, it is anticipated that there
will be continuing improvements in
the costs, integration of capture with
power plant operations, and reduction
in energy penalties for the capture technologies. In addition, there is a need
to evaluate the CO2 composition from
various capture processes for permitting
and injection purposes.

Geologic storage
Sequestration in geologic formations builds on strong experience in
the oil and gas industry. The primary
types of geologic reservoirs for storing
CO2 underground are depleted oil and
gas reservoirs, unmineable coal seams,
and deep saline formations. The target

Through the Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership, Battelle scientists drilled an 8,000 ft
test well at First Energy‚Äôs R.E. Burger Plant near Shadyside, Ohio, to evaluate CO2 storage potential in

reservoirs are typically, but not always,
over 2,500 ft deep and consist of layers of sandstone or other porous rocks
where CO2 can be stored. The target reservoirs would also be capped by layers
of nonporous rocks that act as seals to
prevent the CO2 from leaking out. Deep
reservoirs are targeted because they are
well away from drinking water supplies and because they are naturally at a
pressure above about 1,100 psi. At this
pressure or above, the CO2 is in a supercritical state where its density is near
that of a liquid, thus greatly reducing its
volume compared to a gas. Also at these
pressures, the CO2 is less mobile than as
a gas and, thus, more easily contained
in deep geologic reservoirs for long
periods. Recently the US Department
of Energy (DOE) completed the first
edition of a National Atlas describing
these reservoirs and their capacities as
estimated by DOE‚Äôs Regional Carbon
Sequestration Partnership Program. The
atlas discusses the partnerships‚Äô estimated storage potential and implementation aspects in various reservoir types,
such as:
‚Ä¢ Depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Oil and

gas fields are considered a natural
choice for storing CO2 for several reasons. They make attractive CO2 sequestration targets since they have already
proven their ability to contain oil, gas,
and water for millions of years and
their geologic character is well defined
by previous exploration efforts. According to the atlas, these types of reservoirs
in the US are estimated to contain about
90 gigatons of storage capacity. Currently, CO2 is injected in depleted oil
fields to enhance oil recovery because
under suitable reservoir conditions CO2
mobilizes the oil trapped in fine pore
spaces through miscible or immiscible
displacement processes. The US is a
world leader in enhanced oil recovery
(EOR) technology, using about 30 million tonnes/year of CO2 for this purpose, mostly from natural CO2 sources.
However, these are primarily operated
as EOR projects with an effort to maximize economic returns through CO2
recycling rather than maximizing CO2
storage in the reservoirs. CO2 injection
also may be used to maintain reservoir
pressure in depleted oil and gas zones.
Enhanced oil and gas recovery offers

DOE partnerships testing sequestration
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
A government-industry task force is
working to develop technologies and
infrastructure for carbon capture and
sequestration with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
that can contribute to global climate
change. The goal is safe, cost-effective, and long-term carbon mitigation,
management, and storage.
The US Department of Energy in
2003 organized seven Regional Carbon
Sequestration Partnerships. The RCSPs
currently are Ô¨Åeld-testing sequestration
as part of the validation phase, which
ends in 2009. The validation phase is
the second in the three-phase program. More than 30 validation projects
are planned by the RCSPs‚Äîa network
of more than 300 state agencies, universities, and private companies spanning 40 states, three Indian nations,
and four Canadian provinces.
A deployment phase, slated for
2008-17, involves several large-volume
sequestration tests to demonstrate that
sequestration sites have the potential
to store hundreds of years of regional
CO2 emissions.

While a small number of current
large-scale projects provide valuable

build a foundation for the technology
through evaluating storage potential
in various regions of the US and the
world‚Äîa purpose served in the US by
the regional carbon sequestration partnerships. As part of an effort to further
develop carbon sequestration technologies and develop ways to reduce CO2
emissions while protecting the industrial economy of the Midwest, Battelle

Laboratory oversees the RCSPs. The
DOE sequestration research program
supports other US and United Nations
GHG mitigation efforts. In addition,
DOE belongs to the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, an international collaboration on climate change. Six
forum member nations are participating in RCSP‚Äôs validation projects.

Partnership activities
The Big Sky Carbon Sequestration
Partnership (BSCSP) plans Ô¨Åeld tests
in basalt formations and sedimentary
rock hosted saline formations to assess
mineral, chemical, and hydrologic effects of injected CO2.
Researchers will test how well
volcanic rocks abundant below the
Columbia and Snake River plains store
CO2. They plan to inject the gas into
subterranean volcanic basalt rock and
monitor whether the rock can hold it.
BSCSP also is conducting a reactive carbonate reservoir assessment
examining long-term CO2 mineralization rates in carbonate rocks. This
involves enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
operations at Lost Soldier and Wertz oil
Ô¨Åelds in south-central Wyoming. The
consequences of long-term exposure
of carbonate rocks to CO2-rich Ô¨Çuids
are being studied through pre- and

Sequestration Partnership (MRCSP) for
the DOE and 30 other partners. The
MRCSP covers eight states (Indiana,
Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New
York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia). The MRCSP is one of seven partnerships in the DOE Regional Carbon
Sequestration Partnership Program.
In Phase I, the MRCSP focused on
defining the region‚Äôs existing sources of
CO2, geological and terrestrial reservoirs, potential options for transporting
CO2, regulatory framework, and economics of implementing sequestration
opportunities in the region, as well as
reaching out to public stakeholders to

postinjection core comparisons.
Big Sky partnership‚Äôs area includes
Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and South
Dakota as well as eastern Washington,
and Oregon.
The Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium is investigating options for CO2 storage in oil reservoirs,
coal seams, and deep saline waterbearing formations in the Illinois basin,
where all three potential geologic storage opportunities exist in proximity to
substantial CO2 sources.
The Illinois State Geological Survey
is the lead technical contractor for the
consortium. The MGSC covers all of
Illinois, southern Indiana, and western
Kentucky.
The Midwestern Regional Carbon
Sequestration Partnership (MRCSP),
led by Battelle, Columbus, Ohio, is
conducting three deep saline reservoir
tests in Appalachian basin, Michigan
basin, and Cincinnati Arch geologic
regions. MRCSP completed drilling of
an injection and a monitoring well at
the Michigan basin site hosted by DTE

2008. The Burger power plant is also
the planned site for a CO2 capture test,
a potential source of CO2 for geologic
testing. Test drilling at the East Bend
Station is planned for late 2007.
The Plains CO2 Reduction Partnership (PCOR) is investigating sequestration technologies across the central US
and into Alberta. The region includes
the Weyburn geologic sequestration
project. The partnership represents
Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, North
Dakota, Nebraska, Montana, South
Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Validation projects
PCOR is developing three geologic
Ô¨Åeld-validation projects. Acid gas (70%
CO2 and 30% hydrogen sulÔ¨Åde) from
gas processing plants in northern
Alberta will be injected into an oilproducing zone in an underground pinnacle reef structure. Results will help
expand understanding of the effects
of H2S on tertiary oil recovery and CO2
sequestration.
CO2 will be injected into an oilbearing zone at great depth in Beaver
Lodge Ô¨Åeld in northwestern North
Dakota to determine the efÔ¨Åcacy of se-

feature of these tests is that they are
hosted or sponsored by major regional
utilities, which increases the probability
of commercial implementation in the
future. Similar tests are being implemented by other partnerships, and DOE
recently announced plans for largerscale demonstrations.
Another noteworthy project has been
under way at American Electric Power‚Äôs
Mountaineer Plant in New Haven, W.Va.,
to evaluate geologic storage potential
in the Appalachian basin, a key area
for coal-fired power generation. This
project funded by DOE, AEP, and others
and operated by Battelle has completed

questration and EOR using CO2 there.
Unmineable lignite seams in northwestern North Dakota will be injected
with CO2, which researchers say will
be trapped by naturally bonding to the
surfaces of the fractured lignite. This
validation test is expected to increase
knowledge about lignites for both CO2
sequestration and enhanced coalbed
methane production.
Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership, led by the
Southern States Energy Board,
Norcross, Ga., plans a stacked storage
project along the Gulf of Mexico coast.
Researchers, led by the Gulf Coast Carbon Center at the University of Texas,
will investigate a stacked sequence
of hydrocarbon and brine reservoir
intervals.
A separate test at Mississippi Power
Co.‚Äôs Victor J. Daniel coal-Ô¨Åred power
plant near Escatawpa, Miss., will focus
on validating CO2 storage in a deep
saline reservoir near large coal-Ô¨Åred
power plants along the Mississippi
Gulf Coast. A project team, led by
Electric Power Research Institute and
Southern Co., has identiÔ¨Åed the Lower
Tuscaloosa formation as a high-capacity CO2 storage option.
Other Ô¨Åeld tests involve two coal
seam projects in the Black Warrior
basin and the Appalachian basin.
States represented in the partnership

are Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, North
Carolina, and South Carolina.
Southwest Regional Partnership on
Carbon Sequestration, led by the New
Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, plans Ô¨Åeld tests in the San Juan
basin in New Mexico, Paradox basin in
Utah, and the Permian basin in Texas.
This includes the SACROC Unit in Texas
and Aneth oil Ô¨Åeld in Utah.
The tests involve various carbonsink targets, including deep saline
sequestration, EOR and sequestration, and enhanced coalbed methane
production. In some cases, geologic
sequestration tests are being combined with terrestrial tests.
West Coast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (WESTCARB)
is a coalition of more than 70 agencies
and companies from Arizona to British
Columbia. The California Energy Commission is leading the partnership‚Äôs

WESTCARB plans to inject CO2 3,000

to proceed with an extensive injection
and monitoring phase with CO2 to be

the first use of carbon capture technology on a commercial scale at a coalfired power plant and will provide a test
case for retrofitting of existing plants.
These projects represent an example of
an expedited pace in development and
deployment of carbon sequestration
technologies.

Accounting framework
The US currently has no national
regulations governing CO2 emissions.
There are a number of voluntary trading markets, including the Chicago
Climate Exchange.
There are state initiatives such as that
implemented by California and a number of northeastern states through the
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. It is
possible that, at some point in the nottoo-distant future, national regulations
will be implemented that will regulate
emissions of CO2 from various sources.
The imposition of such regulations

those affected. While companies know
the amount of emission reductions they
need, figuring out the most cost-effective way to achieve these reductions
is not an easy task. Companies may
change their operations to reduce their
emissions, or they may acquire emission allowances from other companies
that do not need them. They also may
acquire approved emission-reduction
credits created under two project-based
mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol: the Joint Implementation (JI) or
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
programs.
JI allows industrialized countries to
fulfill part of their required greenhousegas emission reductions by paying for
emission-reducing projects in other
industrialized countries. CDM allows
industrialized countries to invest in
emission-reducing projects in developing countries.
In addition to the voluntary or state
initiatives in the US, experiences in
carbon control and trading in other
26

countries provide valuable lessons.
Major capital investments that may
reduce greenhouse-gas emissions will
often have lifetimes that extend far
past 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol
and the first phase of the European
Emissions Trading Scheme expire. The
exact mechanism, scope, and participation levels that will emerge after 2012
remain uncertain. During the first year,
the market price of European Union
emission allowances has been volatile, reaching over $30/tonne of CO2
equivalent in the summer of 2005 but
decreasing substantially after that. JI and
CDM emission reduction credits can
be acquired for a fifth of this amount.
However, until these credits are actually
created and approved, uncertainty exists
as to whether they will be delivered and

Building experience
A number of modeling studies and
forecasts demonstrate that no single
measure will stabilize atmospheric concentrations of CO2 at a safe level‚Äîthere
is no silver bullet.

These studies, including those done
as part of the Global Technology Strategy Program by the Joint Global Change
Research Institute, show that a suite of
technologies will be required and that
sequestration of CO2 from fossil fuel
processes will be an important factor if
we are to continue taking advantage of
economical fossil fuels.
If carbon sequestration is not undertaken, the use of fossil fuels may

have to be severely diminished, with
significant consequences for the world‚Äôs
economy. The current pilot-scale field
projects funded by the government and
industry provide a unique opportunity to build expertise and experience
in this technology so that a broader
deployment can be undertaken in the
future with greater public confidence
and in compliance with national and
international greenhouse gas mitigation
regulations. ‚ú¶

after discovering that BP withheld key
documents related to anticorrosion
cost-cutting at the field, which was
partially shut down in August 2006 due
to corrosion.
BP American Chairman Robert A.
Malone requested the postponement in
an Apr. 30 letter to subcommittee chairman Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) and chief
minority member Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.).
Malone stated that he had not received
the documents, nor had the president
of BP Alaska or the subcommittee.
‚ÄúSecond, some of the documents
recently produced to the subcommittee
raise concerns about previous spending decisions that cause me concern.
We need time to determine how the
concerns and frustrations expressed

by workers were ultimately resolved,‚Äù
Malone continued.
He said he was troubled by the extent to which the workforce apparently
was frustrated during 2004-05 and that
he wants to eliminate such frustration
‚Äúby creating a culture in which workers are confident their concerns will be
heard and addressed.‚Äù
He said this will take time, but BP is
changing the way it manages its business and is creating a positive safety
culture.
In an Apr. 2 response, John D. Dingell
(D-Mich.), who chairs the full committee, and Stupak told Malone that
BP supplied information Apr. 17 after
numerous requests for such material
‚Äúgoing back nearly a year‚Äù and that the

documents ‚Äúreveal important internal
decisions suggesting a severe cost-cutting atmosphere existed in [BP‚Äôs] crude
oil production operations at Prudhoe
Bay.‚Äù
Some documents discuss stopping
the injection of a corrosion inhibiter
to meet budget targets, while others
suggest that other corrosion mitigation
activities were reduced or postponed
due to spending constraints, they told
Malone.
‚ÄúWe now know that BP proceeded
with cost-cutting measures that may
have compromised pipeline safety while
earning $22 billion in profits. What we
don‚Äôt know is why,‚Äù Dingell said as he
and Stupak announced the hearing‚Äôs
postponement. ‚ú¶

National Association of Manufacturers
Pres. John Engler also called for increased
access to the OCS, as well as more investment and research in energy efficiency,

on Apr. 30 in response to the PFP.
‚ÄúManufacturing requires adequate

high energy rates and rising consumer

demands are crippling manufacturers,

Barnett to spar Hugoton for top US natural gas Ô¨Åeld
Newark East field in North Texas,
center of the Mississippian Barnett shale
play, was Texas‚Äôs largest gas-producing
field in 2006 and could become the
largest in terms of ultimate recovery in
the Lower 48.
The field ranked third in the nation
in reserves, after the entire San Juan
basin in New Mexico and Colorado and
Pinedale field in the Green River basin
in Wyoming, and second in the nation
in terms of production after San Juan.
Eleven articles totaling more than

220 pages describe numerous aspects of
the Barnett shale formation in the April
2007 issue of the American Association
of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin.
One article states, ‚ÄúSeveral individuals who have worked the Barnett play
believe that the greater Newark East
field will eventually surpass the Hugoton field of Kansas, Oklahoma, and
Texas as the largest onshore gas field in
the conterminous US.‚Äù
The Kansas and Oklahoma portions
of Hugoton have produced 35 tcf of gas

The Oil & Gas Journal Databook, 2007 Edition

How the play grew

is a single-source reference for critical facts, forecasts for
the oil and gas market, and insightful articles which were
published throughout 2006 in the Oil & Gas Journal.

Discovered by the former Mitchell
Energy Corp. in 1981 in Wise County,
Newark East field attracted the drilling
of only 100 wells between 1981 and
1990, wrote David F. Martineau, Pitts
Oil Co. LLC, Dallas, in the AAPG lead
article.
The field has been divided into the
original core area where the Barnett overlies the Ordovician Viola limestone and
the expansion area where it sets atop the
Ordovician Ellenburger Group. The early
drilling was in Wise and Denton counties,
and development has now spread to more
than 30 counties underlain by the Fort
Worth basin and Bend arch.
Federal tax credits that expired in
1993 for gas produced from tight sands
and state severance tax relief that continues today helped spur Barnett shale gas
development.
Numerous other Barnett shale field
names include JMG Mag field in Jack
County, Cleburne field in Johnson County,
and St. Joe Ridge field in Montague
County.
The field(s) had produced 2.3 tcf and

could have another 20 tcf recoverable,
a recent study said (OGJ Online, Apr.
27, 2007). The US Geological Survey in
2004 estimated the Barnett‚Äôs potential
at 26.2 tcf of undiscovered recoverable
gas, excluding possible increased recovery as a result of horizontal drilling.
The 26.2 tcf applies to an area of
more than 4 million acres. The play is
considered to have 3-4 tcf of proved
reserves, leading to a total resource
of more than 30 tcf as most recently
envisioned.

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year‚Äôs SSTB is scheduled for March 3 ‚Äì 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year‚Äôs conference.You can‚Äôt
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year‚Äôs theme is ‚ÄúSubsea is here, the game
is changing.‚Äù As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

he Chinese can hardly contain
their glee over the recent discovery of Nanpu oil field in Bohai Bay.
The find, they say‚Äîwhen slowing
down long enough to talk‚Äîis the
country‚Äôs largest in decades.
‚ÄúDiscovery of such a major oil
field offers great flexibility and initiative for the country to plan and adjust
its energy strategy,‚Äù said Hu Wenrui,
vice-president of CNPC subsidiary
PetroChina, which announced on
May 3 a 1.02 billion-tonne reserve of
oil equivalent on the Nanpu Block.
‚ÄúThe Bohai Bay is a relatively
mature area and this new discovery
is encouraging,‚Äù Mark McCafferty,
the lead analyst for Southeast Asia at
energy consultant Wood Mackenzie,
told Reuters. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it is a big find
but exactly how big is uncertain as
they tend to have a different methodology for reporting reserves in
China.‚Äù
Don‚Äôt they indeed! One wonders
if this find was orchestrated by the
ministry of information instead of
sober oil executives.

too, as the aging Daqing oil field in
northeastern Heilongjiang province,
China‚Äôs main domestic source of supply for 30 years, saw annual output
drop below 50 million tonnes in
2003.
Things are really going to change
as a result of the new find, officials
trumpet. CNPC said it will start to
develop the Nanpu oil field as soon as
possible, with the first-phase project,
to be finished by 2012, yielding 10
million tonnes/year.

More to come

PetroChina‚Äôs Hu said, ‚ÄúThis year‚Äôs
production target for the Jidong
Nanpu oil field is 2.2 million tonnes,
with substantial annual increase
scheduled from this year on. By
2012, we expect the oil field to roll
out 10 million tonnes of crude every
year.‚Äù
After that, officials declared, output is expected to rise progressively
to 25 million tonnes/year, making
the new field China‚Äôs third largest
after Daqing and Shengli.
And the party‚Äôs hardly over yet,

was making 2 bcfd of gas as of July
2006, Montague wrote.
Operators completed more than
6,200 wells through September 2006,
more than 5,800 wells were on production, and hundreds of others were
drilled, completed, or awaiting a pipeline.

Technology advances
The main technology improvements
have been shale gas-in-place evaluation, geologic relationships, wellbore
designs, and completion techniques,
Martineau wrote.
Canister desorption tests in the
late 1990s-early 2000s on wells with
nearly identical total organic carbon
values indicated that gas recovery from
the Barnett shale would be more than
double what was previously thought.
Also, the formation has an above-normal pressure gradient in the core area
that reaches 0.54 psi/ft.
Operators have used 3D seismic
surveys since 2001 mostly outside the
core area where the size and strike of
the faults and number and size of karsts
are more random.
Mitchell Energy began pursuing the
Barnett shale in the early 1980s. The
company had a large acreage position
in Boonsville (Bend Conglomerate)
field, which had produced 1.67 tcf of
gas in 30 years. The field‚Äôs decline left
infrastructure that needed a new play to
remain economic.
Mitchell produced 1.35 bcf in 24
years from its first 1981 Barnett shale
completion, which Martineau described
as a ‚Äúsupposedly original noncommercial well.‚Äù
Vertical drilling was the primary
drilling method until 2002. More
than 1,900 horizontal wells have been
drilled. Hydraulic fracturing advanced
through several generations until the
onset in 2006 of the ‚Äúsimo-frac,‚Äù in
which an operator simultaneously fracs
two parallel horizontal well bores 5001,000 ft apart.
It remains to be seen whether the
Barnett will be economic in areas where
it thins to 100-150 ft. ‚ú¶

This is the second of three parts on
insurance loss statistics and their role in
risk management in offshore exploration and development operations.
Part 2 is a summary of the scale of
insured loss in the offshore energy
industry by cause, category, and region
using the Willis Energy Loss database.
Energy loss statistics play an important role in calibrating and verifying
risk management software and are useful to gauge the state of the insurance
market.
Risk events associated with offshore
energy exploration and production occur infrequently but have the potential
of generating large losses. Blowouts,
design/workmanship, heavy weather,
and fire/lightning/explosion represent
the largest loss categories for offshore
basins across the world.

misleading, since damage can occur in
many forms and failures are often due
to a combination of conditions.

Total offshore losses
For each offshore region of the
world, overall losses are tabulated in
terms of their inflation-adjusted total
34

loss and average indexed loss (Table 1).
North America, Europe, and the Far
East have the greatest number of incidents and offshore losses in the world,
contributing roughly 80% of the total
$34 billion reported loss.
The number of incidents is a useful
measure to gauge the frequency of

events and the relative size of each data
category. On an aggregate basis, the
average loss across all cause and loss categories are roughly comparable, ranging from $8.1 million (Eastern Europe)
to $13.4 million (South America).

weather, fire/lightning/explosion, and
mechanical failure (Table 6). The relative frequency indicates the number of
events relative to the total that occurred
over the time period in which loss
reports were available.
On average, the most expensive
incidents are fires ($20.8 million), followed by windstorms ($17 million),
heavy weather ($13.3 million), blowouts ($12.3 million), and mechanical
failure ($10.2 million).
Fire and windstorms often represent
36

the largest loss by cause because of the
total destructive nature. Fire and windstorms require topsides and structural
replacement. Blowouts, windstorms,
and fire represent 75% of the total indexed losses reported.
In Europe, design/workmanship incidents occur most frequently, followed
by heavy weather, mechanical failure,
anchor/jacket/trawl, and pipelaying/
trenching problems (Table 7).
Similar to North America, fire events
represent the largest average loss ($46.7

million) but at a substantially higher
average level. Following fire events
are blowouts ($20.7 million), heavy
weather ($12.0 million), and design/
workmanship ($10.7 million).
Because the average value of a platform in the North Sea is many times
greater than an average Gulf of Mexico
platform, when a fire occurs it is expected to be more destructive. Design/
workmanship, fire, blowouts, and heavy
weather contribute about three-fourths
of the total indexed losses.

P L O R A T I O N

European blowouts are more costly
than North American blowouts, but
the impact of heavy weather losses are
roughly comparable. North America
and European losses reflect differences
in the environmental conditions and
the design requirements for offshore
production.
In the Far East, blowouts are the
most frequent loss occurrence, similar
to North America, followed by design/workmanship, heavy weather, and
mechanical failure (Table 8). Windstorms lead to the largest average loss
($25.3 million), followed by blowouts
($17.3 million) and heavy weather
($8.4 million). It is interesting to note
that fire/lightning/explosion events in
the Far East are not a major contributor
to losses.

Blowout events
Total losses from blowouts include
the direct physical loss or damage to
platforms, rigs, and equipment (Table
9).
Operators extra expense (OEE)
includes the cost to control a blowout
and the cost to redrill the well. North
America is responsible for more than
half of the total losses reported. The
Middle East and South America exhibit
average losses nearly $38 million/
blowout, while the Caribbean, Eastern
Europe, and Australasia exhibit average aggregate losses in the range $4-10
million.

Average and total loss
North America exhibits an average
$9 million/blowout, while the Far East
has a $37 million average rig blowout
cost (Table 10).
Note that in several regions a small
sample size may prevent the average
statistic from being representative of the
region. Most blowouts occur in exploratory drilling, but platform blowouts,
which primarily represent development
wells, are also common. Loss reports do
not allow well blowouts to be assigned
to drilling, production, or workover
activity, and the occurrence of drilling
vessel blowouts is small.
38

& DEVE

L O P M E N T

The average loss due to a platform
blowout is significantly larger than a rig
blowout, probably reflecting the higher
valuation and potential damage associated with the platform. The average well
blowout loss claim is $10.4 million.

Onshore blowouts
Sample sizes for most regions are
relatively small, but for North America,
South America, and the Far East, the
data are sufficiently large to conclude
that onshore blowouts are typically
two to five times less costly than their
offshore counterparts (Table 11).

Spain
Sherritt International Corp., Toronto,
is awaiting final regulatory approval to
begin work on four blocks in the Alboran Sea off southern Spain.
The company was awarded permits
in March 2007 to explore the blocks,
which total 818,261 acres. Planned
work includes a 3D seismic survey and
contingent wells.

Design/workmanship events
Europe dominates design/workmanship problems ($3.765 billion), far
exceeding North America ($389 million) and the Far East ($297 million)
(Table 14).
This is partly explained by the hostile
operating environment in the North
Sea, where platforms need to be built
to withstand the harsh conditions.
Platforms and pipelines contribute the
greatest amount to the loss categories, and on average, the loss statistics
are roughly comparable across each
category.

About 50% of FPSOs and 60% of FSOs
are leased, while only 15% of other
production units are leased.

Strong market

Fundamentals driving the floating production sector have never been
stronger. Crude futures prices 6 years
out are in the mid-$60/bbl range, and
crude prices of $50/bbl or more
have gained increased acceptance as
the measure for project hurdles.
The lure of $60/bbl crude is
drawing capital into the floating
production sector. Industry has
made speculative investment of
more than $3 billion in a dozen

years, eliminating some constraints on
exploration and development that have
slowed deepwater projects in recent
years.
These indicators suggest that growth
of floating production clearly has room
to expand.

Planned projects
IMA‚Äôs recently published study has
identified 109 offshore projects in
the planning pipeline that potentially
require floating production systems
(Fig. 2).
Asia has the largest concentration of
new projects, with 24 known floater
projects. Of these 14 are at bidding or
final design stage.
West Africa has the second largest
concentration of new projects, with 20
known projects in the planning pipeline, 8 of which are in bidding or final
design stage.
In third place is Brazil with 17 projects, followed by the Gulf of Mexico
with 15, Northern Europe with 12, and
Australia-New Zealand with 9.

Redeployments
Redeploying existing units will satisfy an increasing portion of new floating
production projects involving FPSOs.
During the past 5 years, 16 FPSO
redeployments accounted for 17% of
FPSO contracts. But as lease contracts
40

expire and fields reach depletion, more
units will become available and the
percentage of FPSO contracts that use
redeployed units will increase.
Of 60 leased FPSOs in service, 31
have contracts in which the firm lease
period or known option period expires
within the next 5 years. Some of these
units will become available as current leases expire, although some will
receive lease extensions.
More importantly, of 122 FPSOs
(leased and owned) currently in operation, 58 have been on a field for more
than 5 years and 20 for more than
10 years. Among the units that have
operated for more than 5 years, 18
are high-end, well maintained, harsh
environment FPSOs now in use in the
North Sea.
The ability to redeploy existing units
depends on numerous technical issues,
such as compatibility of the old and
new fields in terms of reservoir fluids,
producing GOR, water depth, operating
environment, and storage requirement.
Another complication is the extent
to which single-hull FPSOs will be accepted for use on future fields. Less than
20% of the 58 units on fields more than
5 years have double hulls. The other
80% may find resistance to redeployment on fields in environmentally
sensitive areas.
Also influencing redeployment is the

economics of removing a unit from an
existing field, even one that is handling
small production volumes. Oil prices in
the $60/bbl range have extended the
economic limit of these fields and allow
operators to keep producing them even
at a very small percentage of the unit‚Äôs
processing capacity.
For example, the Jabiru Venture and
Challis Venture FPSOs off Australia recently averaged 2,200 bo/d production,
which is 4% of the installed processing
capacity. Yet the units apparently remain
profitable and will continue operating.
In these cases, not only does the field
continue to produce a positive cash
flow but the operator defers abandonment costs.
IMA expects that redeployments will
provide about 25% of the FPSOs needed
for new projects during the next 5
years. ‚ú¶

In its production operations in
northwest Arkansas, XTO Energy Inc.
has extended the productive life of
five gas wells by controlling proppant
flowback. The flowback was plugging
rod pump systems and eroding tubular
goods.
XTO Energy is the largest natural

gas producer in Arkansas, with more
than 500,000 acres under lease. The
company is following two trends in
the Arkoma basin: Fairway trend and
Overthrust trend, as well as the Fayetteville Shale. XTO is focusing on well
recompletions and new stimulation
techniques, as well as drilling additional
development wells.
There were three rigs drilling in
fourth-quarter 2006 and the company
expects to drill 90-100 wells in the Arkoma basin in 2007. About 86% of Arkoma basin production is from Arkansas
wells and about 14% from Oklahoma
wells (www.xtoenergy.com).
In addition to the five gas wells
discussed in this article, XTO has
identified many more wells that would

likely benefit from flowback control.
Projected value added, in the form of
reduced workover-cleanout expense
and increased production from the five
wells treated ranges from $210,000
to 440,000/well/year. Figs. 1 and 2
illustrate the economic impact of conducting cleanout operations to remove
produced proppant from the near-wellbore area, tubulars, and production
equipment at the surface.
Although flowback-control treatment
may have minor effect on production
rate in most cases, it helps greatly to
keep the wells in continuous production, without requiring shutdown for
workover and cleanout processes. In
some wells, treatments have increased
production substantially.

XTO wells in northwest Arkansas
were typically drilled and completed
in the late 1980s. Completion methods included: (1) perforation and (2)
production without fracture stimulation or other production-enhancement
measures. The pay zones in these vertical wells are at about 5,000 ft, and they
have produced at commercially favorable levels.
In early 2003, XTO accelerated a
fracture stimulation program that substantially increased natural gas production. XTO fractured existing producing
zones, typically using a nitrified borate
gel system to place 20/40-mesh sand.
Production spiked up and then began to
decline. In addition, proppant flowback
accompanying the hydrocarbons fouled
the rod-pump system.
In 2006, XTO treated five wells with
a proppant-flowback arresting system

a tacky, thin film of resin that creates
bonds between grains that cure with
time and temperature. Unconsolidated
proppant grains are consolidated with
negligible loss of initial permeability.
The combination of resin with the
activator into a single component helps
ensure that wherever the proppant pack
is treated, the consolidation will take
place without the uncertainty that often
accompanies other consolidation systems. Instead of an instant cure, as often
occurs with acid catalysts, curing of the
resin designed in this one-component
system takes place slowly to allow complete placement into the proppant pack
and complete displacement from the
pore space within the proppant pack.
‚Ä¢ Pulsing tools. PFA treatments can be
applied with either fluid-oscillator technology or low-frequency pulsing; both
methods enhance fluid flow through
porous media (Fig. 5). Fluid oscillation
produces emissions of alternating bursts
of fluid that create pulsing pressure
waves within the wellbore and formation fluids. These pressure waves can
break up many types of near-wellbore
damage, helping restore and enhance
the permeability of the perforations and
near-wellbore area.
Wave stimulation is a coiled-tubing deployed placement method for
improving chemical treatments such as
matrix acidizing, scale inhibition, and
remedial sand-proppant control. The
wave technology is based on high-amplitude, low-frequency pulsing (LFP) to
enhance flow of fluids through porous
media.
Its porosity-dilation effect results in
fluids being forced into normally unoccupied pore spaces under the influence
of pressure waves. The effect is more
attributable to fluid-wave propagation
and pore dilation than to rock movement.
PFA service provides the following
technical and economic benefits:
‚Ä¢ Extends production life of the well.
‚Ä¢ Reduces proppant production.

requiring a workover rig. The source
of the proppant was a fracture treatment performed in 2003 to increase

are $3,000/day for the workover rig,
with 4 lost-production days associated
with the process. Cleanout costs range
between $18,000 and $44,000.

across each perforated interval.
A pulse-pressure tool was applied across the perforated intervals to
enhance fluid flow into the proppant
porosity. The pulsing technique eliminated the need for mechanical isolation
between intervals. Pumping rate was
1 bbl/min. No proppant flowback has
been observed during the year of production since the treatment.

Case 2
This well was completed in 1986
and produced naturally until 2003,
when it was fractured with a boratecross linked gel and 75,000 lb of
20/40 white sand, at 1 to 5 lb/gal. Initial proppant-sand production reduced
rod-pump system efficiencies, leading
to costly workover completions and
nonproductive time.
The PFA treatment was conducted in
much the same manner as described in
Case 1. Since the treatment, no proppant has been produced and the pumping system continues to run smoothly.
Economically viable production levels
have been restored. ‚ú¶

A recent study of
the European refining
industry from Concawe
(Conservation of Clean
Air and Water in Europe)
concludes that the imbalRefining
ance between demand
for gasoline and middle
distillates will continue to increase. The
study, ‚ÄúOil refining in the EU in 2015,‚Äù
developed base case, lowdemand, and other plausible supply-demand scenarios to evaluate possible
consequences in terms of
investment requirements,
total economic impact,
energy consumption, and
CO2 emissions.
From a reference 2015 scenario,
Concawe explored different sensitivities, which included such factors as the
dieselization rate of EU‚Äôs car population, improved vehicle efficiency, effects
of nontechnical measures to reduce
demand, introduction of biofuels, and
availability of gasoline export markets
and gas oil/diesel import sources.
The study‚Äôs main conclusions are:
‚Ä¢ Adequate crude distillation capacity exists in Europe to meet forecast demand by 2015. Refiners there, however,
must add downstream units and operate
others differently to cope with changes
in the product slate, especially regard-

ing middle distillates and gasoline.
‚Ä¢ The gas-oil-to-gasoline (GO/G)
ratio is the most important parameter
that determines the processing configuration that will be needed. This ratio,
according to Concawe, can change due
to many factors including dieselization,
relative penetration of alternative fuels,
and continued availability of gasoline
export markets and middle distillate
imports.
‚Ä¢ Refinery investments are mainly
required in hydrocracking and some
residue desulfurization or conversion
capacity.
‚Ä¢ A continued increase in the GO/G
ratio would present serious difficulties
for EU refiners in terms of adapting
their refineries for the right processes
and the magnitude of required investments.
‚Ä¢ A possible increase in overall CO2
emissions due to an excessive rate of
dieselization and a decrease in the efficiency gas between diesel and gasoline
cars.

EU reÔ¨Ånery model
The Concawe study used a linear
programming technique to simulate the
European refining system. The EU, plus
Norway and Switzerland, was divided
into eight regions: Baltic, Benelux, Germany, Central Europe, UK and Ireland,
France, Iberia, and Mediterranean. In

Crude supply
In the past 2-3 decades, the favorable
geographic location of Europe in relation to light and sweet crude-producing regions has resulted in a fairly light
crude diet, according to the study.
In 2005, the 27 countries included
in the study consumed about 735 million tonnes of crude as feedstocks. This
will grow to 785 million tonnes by
2015, according to Concawe.
Supplies will be adequate for this demand, but supply sources will change.
North Sea production will decline but
other regions like West Africa and Caspian basin will take over. This change
will not significantly affect overall quality; the study predicts that Europe will
be able to maintain its current proportion of 45% sweet crude feed (Fig. 1).

Product demand
Europe, in the past few years, has
seen two main trends affecting product
demand from its refineries:
‚Ä¢ Lighter products. Europe is
demanding more gas oils and lighter
products, and less residual fuel oils. This
is due to development of land and air
transport as well as demand for petrochemical feedstocks.
‚Ä¢ Dieselization. Europe has a fastgrowing market for diesel and jet fuel,
and eroding demand for gasoline. Although present in other regions of the
world, this trend is particularly strong
in Europe.

Fig. 2 shows historical demand
for various refinery products and the
forecast to 2015. It shows the further
lightening of the demand barrel. The
widening imbalance between middle
distillates (gas oils, kerosine, jet fuel)
and gasoline is also obvious; a marked
decrease of gasoline demand and large
increases of diesel and jet fuel demands
only slightly tempered by a slow decline of other gas oils (mostly heating
oil).
Fig. 3 shows imbalances in the GO/G
ratio and middle-distillate-to-gasoline
ratio. In this study, gas oils include automotive, marine, and off-road diesel,

the internal trade opportunities to what
appears feasible logistically, the modeling represents an economic optimization of the system‚Äôs capabilities.
Table 2 summarizes the changes to
the EU refining system required by
2015 for both the reference and lowdemand scenarios.

Reference scenario
Total production increases 8.5% in
the reference scenario. This will require
more distillation capacity, although this
level of increase is attainable via capacity creep through minor revamps rather
than new units or grassroots refineries.
52

GO/G ratio

4.3

The fraction of light products in the
total product slate (which characterizes
conversion intensity) only increases
marginally; demand for residual does
decrease, but current residual fuel oil
imports (around 10 million tpy) are
assumed to cease by 2015.
Production of an additional 47 million tpy of distillates requires, however,
new conversion capacity. Because the
bulk of the increase is in the form of
diesel and jet fuel, hydrocracking is the
preferred route. The model also seeks to
maximize the economic use of existing
assets. FCCs are still fully used, but their
operating mode changes (Fig. 4).

In the 2005 base case, almost all FCC
capacity operates as high-conversion
units, thereby maximizing the yield of
gasoline components and minimizing
the yield of low-quality diesel components. In the 2015 reference scenario,
FCCs operate as low-conversion units.
Light cycle oil quality improves, partly
due to use of hydrotreated feedstocks
from dedicated feed hydrotreaters, mild
hydrocrackers, and residue desulfurizers
(Fig. 5) but also by deep hydrodesulfurization.
Additional deep gas-oil hydrodesulfurization is also required to make sulfur-free road diesel. There is of course
a concurrent need for extra hydrogen
production.
A significant increase of reformate
splitting is required to rebalance the
various quality requirements of the
gasoline pool.
According to the study, any additional steam cracker capacity is broadly
in line with increased ethylene demand.
The larger increase in demand for
higher olefins and aromatics is partially
met in refineries that will invest in propane-propylene splitter and aromatic
extraction plants. Steam-cracker feed
composition only marginally changes.
The resulting capital investment cost
is ‚Ç¨15.2 billion (‚Ç¨4.4 billion/year),
which includes capital charges, extra
fixed and variable costs, and extra fuel
and loss. All these additional plants consume energy and energy consumption
of the refineries goes up in absolute
terms, as do CO2 emissions.
Energy consumption and CO2 emissions also increase relative to the total
production. Because the depth of conversion does not significantly change,
this is clearly the result of a higher
GO/G ratio.

Low-demand scenario
Reduced transportation-fuel demand
results in a slight contraction of the
total refinery output, according to the
study‚Äôs low-demand scenario. Because
the study assumes that demand for all
other products is constant, the conversion intensity is lowered.

The middle distillate/gasoline ratio
is, however, nearly double compared to
the 2005 base case. Refiners can only
achieve this level of production via a
much larger shift from FCC to hydrocracking capacity. Utilization of existing
FCCs is much lower (72% of available
capacity), whereas investment in new
hydrocracking and residue desulfurization capacity is 50% higher than in
the reference scenario despite reduced
conversion intensity.
The mechanisms used by the model
to rebalance the gasoline pool are complex.
In this scenario, FCCs operate in
high-conversion mode (Fig. 4) and
more desulfurized residue is used as
FCC feed (Fig. 5), replacing desulfurized vacuum gas oil used as hydrocracker feed.
The steam-cracker feed diet changes
significantly; more heavy naphtha is
used because less gasoline, no hydrowax, and less LPG is produced in
refineries due to lower FCC runs. The
average ethylene yield decreases compared to the base case, which explains
the additional increase in steam cracker
feed capacity compared to the reference
scenario.
For energy consumption and CO2
emissions, both effects compensate each
other so that the figures are similar to
the study‚Äôs 2005 base case.

Sensitivity to GO/G ratio
Fig. 6 shows the changes in the
cumulative throughputs of key process
plants. Similar to what was observed in
the comparison between the reference
and low-demand scenarios, FCC utilization decreases with increasing GO/G
ratio. Concurrently, new hydrocracking and residue desulfurization capacity becomes important. At very high
ratios, hydrocracking cannot be further
increased due to a lack of feedstock and
massive residue desulfurization capacity is the only solution. FCC throughput recovers somewhat because more
desulfurized residue feedstock becomes
available.
The large investment cost required

to install additional unit capacity correlates remarkably well with the GO/G
ratio for a given level of demand (Fig.
7). Both curves follow the same trend.
The reference scenario requires ‚Ç¨15.2
billion of investment (from the 2005
base case) and increasing the GO/G

ratio from 2.6 to 3.4 virtually doubles
this cost.
Fig. 7 shows a shallow minimum towards the lower range of GO/G ratios.
This suggests there may be an optimum
ratio value, as a function of the demand
level, where demand can be met at lowest investment cost. ‚ú¶

soil temperature field is minor. Similar
conclusions emerge at different pipeline
distances.
The isothermals on the left side of
the crude oil pipeline changed greatly
with variation of the vertical relative
position of the two pipelines. The heat
loss of the hot crude oil pipeline at the
pumping station outlet increased due
to the heat absorption of the products
pipeline. Moreover, as the products
pipeline‚Äôs buried depth increased, the
heat loss of the crude oil also experienced a small increase. The vertical
relative position of the two pipelines
did not significantly affect heat loss on
the crude oil.
Analysis showed that when there are
two pipelines in one ditch, the heat loss
of the crude oil pipeline is greater than
that of the crude oil pipeline laid in a
ditch on its own at distances less than
80-100 km and is smaller than that of
the single crude oil pipeline at distances
greater than 80-100 km. Across the first
80-100 km, the significant temperature difference between the hot crude
oil and the cold products increases the
products temperature and decreases the
crude oil temperature. After 80-100 km
have been traveled, the heat absorption
of the products pipeline diminishes
and the products even release heat due
to the minor temperature difference
between the two pipelines.
Fig. 3c shows that the temperature
of the products first increases then
decreases. Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c show the
temperatures of the crude and products
separately. Table 2 details the underlying
data.
A new parameter, Tdiff, describes the
thermal effect on the crude oil pipeline clearly. The parameter consists of
the temperature difference at the same
location of a pipeline coexisting with
another and one laid on its own. Fig.
3b, in which the curves have good
superposition with each other, shows
that Tdiff of the crude oil is minor when
the vertical relative positions of the two
pipelines change.
The maximum Tdiff of the crude oil
and products lines both decrease gradu58

ally with the shallower buried depth of
the products pipeline (Table 2). Table
2 also shows the maximum Tdiff and its
location.
Changing the physical properties of
the soil, the outlet temperature, and the
throughput rates of crude oil and the
products had little effect on the results.
The comparison described here varied the depth of the products pipeline
while keeping the crude oil pipeline
fixed. Reversing these conditions would
produce similar results.

Laser system detects gas pipeline leaks
An airborne gas pipeline leak detection
system combines a methane sensitive laser
with a digital video record of the pipeline.
Test findings revealed by the Rocky
Mountain Oilfield Testing Center, Casper,
Wyo., from results of a study conducted by
the US Department of Energy evaluating
the use of Englewood, Colo.-based Aviation
Technology Services‚Äô proprietary laser leak
detection system indicate that ATS‚Äôs system
found 25% more leaks on a blind test than
any other system tested and detected 90%
of all gas released in the test. Aerial, laser
leak detection is a fast method of inspection without losing pipeline production,
ATS notes.
During 4 days in September 2006,
RMOTC evaluated ATS‚Äôs Boreal laser system
for natural gas leak detection near Casper.
Throughout the test, ATS‚Äôs helicopter-based
laser system consistently detected methane
leaks, the firm reports. Large and small
leaks were successfully detected, measured,

and reported, ATS points out.

Survey conÔ¨Årms
US confusion
about energy
Surveys can provide important ratiÔ¨Åcation of the obvious. One recent survey, for
example, indicates Americans know little
about energy.
Conducted by the Manhattan Institute‚Äôs
Center for Energy Policy and the Environment (CEPE) and Zogby International, the
survey quizzed 1,000 Americans on basic
energy facts.
‚ÄúThe survey found that the views that

T h e
E d i t o r ‚Äô s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Americans hold about a wide range of
these issues are, in key ways, inaccurate,‚Äù
wrote Max Schulz, CEPE senior fellow, in a
report summary.
According to Schulz, a former policy advisor and speech writer for US energy secretaries, ‚ÄúsigniÔ¨Åcant numbers of people‚Äù
don‚Äôt understand matters such as:
‚Ä¢ Fuels representing the main sources
of energy. More than 60% of respondents
think most US energy comes from oil,
which represents 40% of supply.
‚Ä¢ Main uses of energy supplies. Almost
half think incorrectly that transportation accounts for most US energy consumption.
‚Ä¢ Countries that supply the most oil to
the US. More than half think Saudi Arabia
is the No. 1 supplier. It‚Äôs really No. 3, in a tie
with Venezuela behind Canada and Mexico.
‚Ä¢ Extent of oil reserves. Forty-three
percent think the world will run out of oil
during this century.
‚Ä¢ The rate of global warming. More
than three fourths believe warming was
greater in the second half of the past
century than during the Ô¨Årst, apparently
unaware of the decline in global average
temperature during 1945-75.
‚Ä¢ Terms of the Kyoto Protocol on
climate change. Sixty percent mistakenly
believe the agreement requires all countries to cut emissions of greenhouse gas.
‚Ä¢ The environmental record of nuclear
power plants. Only 17% know that no one
died in the 1979 partial meltdown at the
Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania.
‚Ä¢ The extent of urban air pollution.
Eighty-four percent incorrectly believe
urban pollution is rising.
‚Ä¢ Effects of conservation and increases in
energy efÔ¨Åciency. Two thirds or more believe
the US can meet future energy needs solely
with conservation and efÔ¨Åciency measures.
The misunderstanding on display here
helps explain US bamboozles such as the
ethanol mandate, which is among several
other subjects covered in the report. It‚Äôs at

Gas tests $8/MMbtu
The June natural gas contract brieÔ¨Çy pushed past $8/MMbtu May 3-4 in a rally by
hedge-fund investors that forced traders to cover short positions on the New York
market. The contract touched $8/MMbtu before it closed at $7.95/MMbtu May 3, up
21.7¬¢ for the day on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It climbed as high as $8.11/
MMbtu May 4, before settling at $7.94/MMbtu. On the US spot market, however, gas
at Henry Hub, La., lost 7¬¢ to $7.55/MMbtu May 3 and remained unchanged May 4.
‚ÄúFutures prices through October were up 20¬¢ or more as hedge funds went on
a calculated buying spree, forcing traders out of short positions ahead of rapidly
increasing prices, which perpetuated the rally,‚Äù said analysts at Enerfax Daily.
Robert S. Morris, Banc of America Securities LLC, New York, noted a 6.5% rise
in composite spot gas prices over the Ô¨Åve trading sessions that week. ‚ÄúNatural gas
prices began the week with a strong rally as near-record warm temperatures permeated much of the country while technical factors boosted the near-month NYMEX
futures contract to over $8/MMbtu,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúAlso, despite a higher-than-expected natural gas storage injection Ô¨Ågure that
week, and with the traditionally weak seasonal shoulder period upon us, natural gas
futures prices also seem to be looking ahead with the ofÔ¨Åcial start of both the Atlantic Basin hurricane season and summer less than a month away,‚Äù Morris said. ‚ÄúMost
prognosticators are calling for a more-active-than-normal hurricane season and a
warmer-than-normal summer.‚Äù
Enerfax analysts said, ‚ÄúBy all accounts the nation is Ô¨Çush with natural gas, and
inventories are expected to build quickly over the next several weeks.‚Äù Above-average temperatures were expected to stretch across the entire middle of the US and
fan out to cover most of the US through mid-May.
Crude prices
Crude futures prices fell 7% Apr. 30-May 4 in the largest weekly decline since Jan.
5 in the New York market. ‚ÄúOil prices started the week on a downward trend after
supply fears that had stoked the market at the end of the prior week‚Äîwhen Saudi
Arabia arrested 172 militants and thwarted a terrorist plot targeting its oil Ô¨Åelds and
oil infrastructure‚Äîeased,‚Äù Morris said. Otherwise, he said, the US crude and product
inventory report through Apr. 27 was largely in line with expectations while the Department of Energy suspended reÔ¨Ålling the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve until at
least the end of the summer driving season because recent bids were ‚Äútoo high and
not a reasonable value for taxpayers.‚Äù
US crude inventory levels were 5% above the 5-year average on Apr. 27, said Raymond James analysts. However, they said, ‚ÄúGoing forward, signiÔ¨Åcantly below-average gasoline inventories and above-average demand for gasoline should continue
to give support to crude prices, while many investors are beginning to look toward
other commodity markets.‚Äù US gasoline inventories declined for 12 straight weeks
through Apr. 27, and, as reÔ¨Åners come back online and increase reÔ¨Ånery utilization,
this will increase the US‚Äôs crude demand, said Raymond James.
Meanwhile, Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, noted, ‚ÄúThe main fundamental [crude market] change this year vs. 2005 or most
of 2006 has been the re-creation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries‚Äô spare capacity through quota reduction.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúWhen OPEC production was
operating at full capacity, producers had little incentive to hedge; whereas nowadays
the incentive is to hedge more of the production on Ô¨Çat price increases in order to
front-run any potential OPEC cheating. The resurgence of producer hedging will play a
greater Ô¨Çat-price capping role than in the 2 previous years and was probably a factor
in the failure of crude to break the resistance lines in the higher $60/bbl level.
‚ÄúGasoline demand is up 97,000 b/d, but production is up 241,000 b/d. Hence
the US fundamentals situation stays unchanged,‚Äù Jakob said. Despite production
cuts this year by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, he said, ‚ÄúUS
reÔ¨Åneries have so far faced no problems [Ô¨Ånding] the required crude imports, while
gasoline is not able yet to end its Ô¨Çirt with minimum of inventory levels.‚Äù
Jakob also noted the reduction of the US Navy‚Äôs armada in Middle East waters,
with one aircraft carrier, the USS Eisenhower, sailing back through the Red Sea;
another carrier, the USS Nimitz, currently in the Philippine Sea, leaving only the USS
Stennis to cover Afghanistan. That, he said, ‚Äúcoincides with the goodwill attitude that
has been shown before the start of the Iraq conference and is leading to a lowering
of the Iranian premium [on world oil prices].‚Äù

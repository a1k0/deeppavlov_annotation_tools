Depend on WellDynamics
Monitoring Solutions
for Heavy Oil Recovery
Typical heavy oil recovery methods such as steamassisted gravity drainage and steam flooding create a
high-temperature, corrosive well environment that
most monitoring systems can’t withstand.
WellDynamics systems hold up in even the most
extreme conditions.
• EZ-Gauge® monitors downhole pressure without
downhole power, electronics or moving parts –
making it one of the few options for long-term
monitoring in harsh environments.
• OptoLog® DTS HT is a newly-developed fiber optic
distributed temperature sensing system that works
even in high-temperature, hydrogen-rich environments that are detrimental to standard hightemperature multi-mode fiber.

Europe opens gas, electricity markets July 1
Household customers across Europe became free to choose their
gas and electricity suppliers on July 1, indicating the beginnings
of a single, open energy market. The question, however, is whether
customers will switch, as many utility firms on continental Europe
continue to enjoy monopolies.
Legal unbundling of local electricity and gas distribution companies also was compulsory on July 1 to ensure independence
from their parent companies and provide fair access to all suppliers
in the distribution network. At transmission level legal unbundling
was enforced in 2003.
Member states with open gas and electricity markets on July 1
were France, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Northern Ireland, Austria, Belgium,
Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Ireland, Sweden, and the UK.
However, some member states have succeeded in obtaining derogations on introducing competition in their electricity markets;
including Cyprus, Malta, and Estonia. Cyprus and Estonia have until 2013 to ensure there is a competitive electricity market.
Countries that have extensions to open their gas markets are
Finland, Latvia, Greece, and Portugal, the last three of which have
until 2010 to do so. “Cyprus and Malta do not have gas markets,” a
spokeswoman from the European Commission told OGJ.
The European Commission has championed an internal market, arguing it would provide competitive prices for consumers,
energy efficiency, and investment in infrastructure. Developing a
liberalized market has been difficult, with the latest report in January from the European Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes,
showing that tougher rules to prevent discrimination are needed.
Several legislative measures for greater unbundling are expected to
be published in September.
According to UK researcher Datamonitor PLC, a single liberalized market “remains a distant possibility rather than an imminent
reality” because of differing attitudes at a political level, market
conditions, and varying degrees of competition.
On July 5 the European Commission will launch a charter of
rights for energy consumers. The Commission hopes to have a fully
functioning gas and electricity market with open competition and

Denbury to buy more manufactured CO2 for EOR
Denbury Resources Inc. agreed to buy carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery from Rentech Inc.’s proposed synthetic fuels
plant to be built in Natchez, Miss.
Gareth Roberts, Denbury chief executive, said the Rentech
agreement could supply additional CO2 supplies as Denbury expands its tertiary operations in the Gulf of Mexico coastal area.
Initially, Denbury will use the CO2 for EOR in Cranfield and Lake
St. Johns fields near the Mississippi-Louisiana border, a company
spokesman said, adding that there will be more CO2 than will be
needed by those fields.
The company holds operating acreage onshore in Louisiana,
Alabama, in the Barnett Shale play near Fort Worth, Tex., and in
Southeast Texas. Denbury plans to build a CO2 pipeline from the
Natchez plant. Details were not yet available.
The Natchez plant will be designed to use petroleum coke, coal,
and biomass as feedstock and will use a patented Rentech derivative of the Fischer-Tropsch process, The particular feedstock to be
used remains undetermined, a Rentech spokesman said.
Rentech’s final investment decision on whether to build the
plant will be made by Dec. 31, he said. Initial plans call for the
plant to produce 25,000 b/d of synthetic fuels and specialty chemicals. It is to be completed in 2012 and would be expandable to
50,000 b/d.
Denbury said it expects to purchase 350-400 MMcfd of CO2
from Rentech’s Natchez proposed plant. Terms were not disclosed.
Previously, Denbury signed CO2 purchase contracts for two
other planned gasification plants proposed by Faustina Hydrogen
Products LLC, one expected to be built near Donaldsonville, La.,
and another planned for construction near Beaumont, Tex.
If all three plants are built, total manufactured sources will provide Denbury with 750-850 MMcfd of CO2 by 2012. Denbury already owns substantial CO2 reserves on the Jackson Dome in southcentral Mississippi. It operates and is expanding a network of CO2
pipelines in the region.
Denbury said it plans to connect the manufactured sources of
CO2 to its natural source of CO2, allowing the company to allocate
production as required between the two sources. ✦

off Nigeria near borders with Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon. Production
of the field’s 37° gravity oil could start
as early as 2009.
Sovereign Oil & Gas Co. II LLC,
Houston, conceived and negotiated the
Ebok farmout on Oriental’s behalf to
compensate Oriental for partial loss of
OML 115 that resulted from the 2000
maritime boundary treaty between
Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea. That
treaty facilitated ExxonMobil’s development of giant Zafiro oil and gas field
on Block B off Equatorial Guinea.
Sovereign has established a data
room in Houston for Oriental’s farmout to a qualified technical advisor of
a 40% participation interest in Ebok,
which has three untested wells as deep
as 5,298 ft, one of which cut 271 ft
of net oil pay in four sands at 2,6003,600 ft.
Sovereign previously handled the
farmout of nearby Okwok oil field to
Oriental (OGJ Online, July 3, 2006).
Oriental drilled four wells in Okwok
in 2006 and plans to drill two more in
2007 with partner Addax Petroleum
Corp., Calgary, which acquired 40%

participating interest in Okwok in June
2006.
Mobil contributed Ebok field to
Nigeria’s marginal field program,
and Nigeria in 2001 granted Oriental
exclusive negotiating rights to take the
Okwok and Ebok farmouts from Mobil
as compensation for its loss to ExxonMobil in Equatorial Guinea waters.

Petrovietnam, Petronas sign
joint exploration deal
Petrovietnam has signed a contract
with Malaysia’s Petronas Carigali Overseas to drill for oil and gas in fields in
the Gulf of Tonkin.
The fields lay 100 km offshore and
cover nearly 12,000 sq km. They hold
collective reserves of 50 billion cu m
of gas and 45 million bbl of condensate, Petrovietnam said.
Under terms of the contract, the
two companies will invest $57.7 million in exploration during the first 4
years, with Petrovietnam subsidiary
Petrovietnam Exploration Group contributing 55%, and Petronas 45%.

Syria begins licensing round for offshore blocks
Syria’s Oil Minister Sufian Al Alao and Syria Petroleum Co.
General Manager Omar Al Hamad were in London in late
June to promote Syria’s first offshore licensing round, where
four blocks covering 50, 000 sq km are available for lease.
The deadline for applications is Sept. 27.
The selected blocks are in different petroleum basins
where the expected potential for petroleum resources is
“very high,” said the Syrian petroleum ministry (OGJ Online, May 31, 2007).
The basins off Syria are the Levantine basin to the south,
the Levantine basin to the north, the Iskenderun basin to
the north and entering into Turkey territory, and the Cyprus
basin, mostly off Cyprus.
Asked the status of talks between Syria and Turkey regarding maritime boundaries and how such discussions might
affect licensing rounds, Al Alao said the two countries are
friends. “We have selected acreage within Syria’s territorial
waters,” adding that the foreign minister is having discus-

Rosa ﬁeld off Angola starts oil production
Total SA reported the startup of oil production from deepwater Rosa field on Block 17 off Angola.
The field, discovered in January 1998, lies 135 km off the
coast in 1,350 m of water. It is tied back 15 km from the
Girassol floating production, storage, and offloading vessel,
making it the first deepwater field of its size to be tied back
to such a remote installation and in such water depths, Total
said.
Rosa field, which is estimated to hold 370 million bbl of
proved and probable oil reserves, will maintain the FPSO’s
production plateau at 250,000 b/d until early in the next
decade, Total said.
Rosa field will comprise 25 wells, including 11 for
water injection and 14 producers, which will be tied into
four manifolds. The subsea installation consists of 64 km of
insulated, pipe-in-pipe production flow lines and 40 km of
water-injection lines linking Rosa to the FPSO vessel.
Block 17 is composed of four major zones: Girassol and
Dalia, both on production; Pazflor, which is in the bidding
process before sanction; and CLOV, a fourth production area
based on the Cravo, Lirio, Violeta, and Orquidea discoveries,
development of which is now being studied.
Future production from these fields will come in addition
to the 500,000 b/d of oil currently pumped from the Girassol and Dalia structures on the block.
Total E&P Angola is operator of Block 17 and has a 40%
interest. Partners are Esso Exploration Angola (Block 17) Ltd.
20%, BP Exploration (Angola) Ltd. 16.67%, Statoil Angola
Block 17 AS 13.33%, and Norsk Hydro Dezassete AS 10%.
Rancher plans CO2 EOR in Wyoming ﬁelds
Rancher Energy Corp. has selected two contractors to
implement the front-end engineering and design of an en8

sions with Turkey about border issues.
Most of the recent exploration in Syria has resulted in natural gas discoveries. Major gas projects under development in
central Syria are Petro-Canada’s Ash Shaer and Cherrife fields,
which will produce an estimated 80 MMcfd of gas in 2010.
Life-of-field production from Ash Shaer and Cherrife
is estimated at 500 bcf of gas equivalent over the 25-year
contract.
Development is under way, and Petro-Canada has begun
drilling another area, Al Hamad said.
Petro-Canada hopes that its appraisal wells will identify
upside gas, which could double the initial life-of-field estimate and expand production capacity after initial start-up.
Capital investment for the project is expected to be $460660 million.
Syria also is looking at developing 2,000 Mw of wind
power and has received bids for that work. The use of biofuels is being discussed, but Syria would have difficulty sourcing food crops, Al Alao added. ✦

hanced oil recovery project using carbon dioxide injection in
Powder River basin fields in Wyoming.
Rancher expects to recover at least 115 million bbl of
oil by injecting CO2 into the reservoirs of three fields in
the southwest corner of the basin—South Glenrock B, Cole
Creek South, and Big Muddy—all in Wyoming’s Converse
County.
Pipeline engineering consultant Trigon EPC LLC and surface facilities contractor Nicholas Consulting Group Inc. will
conduct the FEED studies for construction of CO2 infrastructure and a pipeline connecting Rancher’s fields with a CO2
pipeline operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corp.
Anadarko, under a long-term supply agreement, will deliver 25-40 MMcfd of CO2 to Rancher for its EOR project.
Rancher Energy Pres. and Chief Executive John Works said
the project is in the planning phase and the company does
not have details on routing, timetable, and financial arrangements for the pipeline and surface facilities. The company
also has not yet obtained financing for development of the
fields and related infrastructure.
Rancher acquired the three fields earlier this year. The
company has a 93.73% interest in South Glenrock B field and
a 100% interest in the other two.
The 7,070-acre South Glenrock field, discovered in 1950
by Conoco Inc., is organized into three units: A, B, and C. It
has estimated remaining recoverable reserves of 40 million
bbl. Field production from the Dakota and Muddy sandstones have been maintained by secondary recovery initiated
in 1961. Current gross production from Unit B is 210 b/d,
primarily 35° oil.
Cole Creek South field, covering 2,080 acres, was discovered in 1948 by Phillips Petroleum Co. It has remaining oil
reserves of 10.8 million bbl. The field has been water-flooded
since the 1960s and currently produces 80 b/d of 35° oil.

Covering 8,500 acres, Big Muddy field is producing
about 60 b/d. Since its discovery in 1916 by Conoco, it has
produced about 52 million bbl of oil from several producing
zones, of which the Wall Creek formation has been the most
prolific, producing 32 million bbl at a depth of 3,500 ft.
Geologically, the field is analogous to nearby Salt Creek field,
in which Anadarko is conducting a successful CO2 injection
program.

Soco plans for 2008 Ca Ngu Vang oil deliveries
Soco International plans initial oil deliveries from its
Ca Ngu Vang field in Vietnam in the first half of 2008. It is
moving ahead with exploration and appraisal and will build
infrastructure on Block 9-2, which contains the field.
The appraisal well tested at a maximum combined rate of
7,050 boe/d, with 5,333 b/d of oil and 10.3 MMcfd of gas
in 2006.
Soco said Vietnam is a core area and that the Te Giac
Den-1X well on Block 16-1 in Vietnam indicated oil and gas
shows and an overpressured environment in the Oligocene
interval. No testing has been carried out on that well.
In Yemen, Soco plans to delineate the western and southern parameters of Kharir field. Production facilities are being
expanded “in anticipation of reaching 70,000 b/d of export
capacity,” the company added. Soco has acquired three rigs
to drill on the block throughout the year, and will focus on

EPA responds to Coffeyville reﬁnery spill
Major flooding caused an oil spill from Coffeyville Resources
LLC’s refinery and fertilizer plant at Coffeyville, Kan. The oil spilled
into the Verdigris River, flooded from several days of heavy rainfall.
The 100,000 b/cd Coffeyville refinery was under 4-6 ft of water
on July 3, emergency officials said.
Workers were able to return to some administrative offices and
warehouses on July 4. But the extent of damages remained unknown until floodwaters recede more. It was unclear when the
refinery might resume operations.
The US Environmental Protection Agency sent coordinators to
Coffeyville for pollution assessments, the EPA Region 7 office in
Kansas City, Kan., reported.
The refinery was shut on June 30, and flood waters breached a Coffeyville levee on July 1. The flooding caused an oil spill from storage
tanks. The spill was isolated and stopped, a refinery spokesman said.
No estimate is currently available on cost of the damages. Coffeyville Resources management said.
“A tank system containing crude oil overflowed during the early hours of the flood, and subsequent record levels of flood waters
have swept the oil from containment areas within the refinery,” a
refinery news release said. “No estimate was immediately available
as to the amount of crude oil lost as access to tank gauges has been
restricted by high water.”
The company also reported a “small ammonia release” but said there
was no threat to the immediate community.The nitrogen fertilizer plant
is at higher elevation than the refinery, but it also remained closed.

development and injector wells to increase basement productivity and production capability.
The company hopes in early 2008 to drill its first exploratory well on the Marine XI block, off Congo (Brazzaville). It
expects to select drilling targets for its West African portfolio
in the third quarter.
Later this year Soco also will shoot a 2D seismic survey
on the Nganzi and Cabinda North blocks in Congo (former
Zaire).

BP terminal work to lift gas recovery off UK
BP PLC expects to increase gas recovery by 30% from
West Sole and Amethyst fields in the southern UK North Sea
by boosting compression in a reconfiguration of onshore
terminals.
The company plans to invest $250 million to add compression at its Dimlington terminal and close its adjacent,
unmanned Easington terminal by early 2008.
Dimlington now receives gas directly from fields in BP’s
Cleeton area and Ravenspurn fields along with gas from
southern UK North Sea fields operated by other companies.
Easington receives gas from West Sole, Hyde, Newsham,
and Hoton fields and passes it to Dimlington.
Amethyst gas flows to Centrica Storage Ltd.’s gas processing terminal at Easington. ✦

The Verdigris River flows into Oologah Lake, a water source for
Tulsa. Officials believe the oil will dissipate before it ever reaches
the lake, said a spokesman for the Tulsa District of the US Army
Corps of Engineers. Tulsa water plant operators along the Verdigris
and the Oologah Lake reported no sign of the oil spill on July 2.

Exxsol Jurong Island ﬂuids plant to be expanded
ExxonMobil Chemical said it will add 130,000 tonnes/year of
capacity to its Exxsol hydrocarbon fluids plant in Jurong Island,
Singapore, raising commercial production to more than 500,000
tonnes by yearend 2008.
ExxonMobil said the increased capacity is designed to meet the
demand for differentiated hydrocarbon fluid products, which is
growing annually at an average rate of 5-6% in Asia Pacific.
The hydrocarbon fluids are used for such uses as drilling mud
oil used in oil exploration, metal working, polymer and pharmaceuticals processing, industrial cleaning, adhesives, and coatings.
Asia’s increasing demand for the fluids comes from strong industrial growth, accompanied by heightened health, safety, and environmental requirements.
The more-stringent requirements include specifications of the
Globally Harmonized System, the international agreement to classify products uniformly, and European legislation known as REACH
(Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals).
The firm’s fluids portfolio is positioned to meet or exceed such
increasingly stringent regulatory and environmental requirements,
according to Kittiphong Limsuwannarot, ExxonMobil Chemical’s

Siemens to supply equipment for propylene plants
Datang International Power Generation Co. Ltd. has let a €20
million contract to Siemens Power Generation to supply core
equipment for the world’s first methanol-to-propylene (MTP)
plant to be built in China.
In the MTP process, natural gas or coal is used as feedstock to
produce methanol, which is then converted to propylene.
China’s MTP project comprises two propylene plants that will
use Lurgi AG’s plastics-from-coal technology. The plants, due on

stream in late 2008 and early 2009, will each produce about
500,000 tonnes/year of polypropylene from coal (OGJ Online,
Dec. 4, 2006, Newsletter).
The Siemens contract includes the supply of a synthesis gas
compressor, which will compress the synthesis gas to 86 bar from
31.7 bar, and a propylene compressor that will compress the propylene to 17.6 bar from 1.05 bar.
Both compressors are single-shaft horizontally split compressors, driven by a SST-600 condensing steam turbine with an output
of over 40 Mw. They are scheduled for delivery in the spring of
2008. ✦

BG to sell Karachaganak gas to KazRosGaz
KazRosGaz, a joint venture of OAO Gazprom and KazMunaiGaz,
will buy 16 billion cu m/year of gas from BG Group PLC and its
partners in the third phase of the Karachaganak project in northwest Kazakhstan. KazRosGaz also will purchase increased volumes
of condensate, but figures for this were not available.
The contract lasts for 15 years. Gas is expected to come on
stream in 2012 following completion of the $8 billion expansion
at Karachaganak.
Production is expected to double at Karachaganak once the third
phase is sanctioned in 2008 to 16 billion cu m/year of gas and
16.5 million tonnes/year of condensate. The Orenburg processing
plant in Russia currently handles 8 billion cu m/year of untreated
Karachaganak gas.
Mark Carne, BG executive vice-president, Europe and Central
Asia, said the gas sales agreement covers more than 7 tcf of gas.
“Additional gas sales resulting from the expansion will also enable
the venture to increase liquids production for export to high-value
western markets,” he added.
BG is the joint operator of Karachaganak gas and condensate
field with a 32.5% interest. Karachaganak holds estimated gross reserves of more than 2.4 billion bbl of condensate and 48 tcf of gas.
Partners are Eni SPA (joint operator) with a 32.5% stake, Chevron
Corp. with 20% interest, and OAO Lukoil with 15%.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Completion of the second stage will raise gas throughput volume in the third pipeline by 500 MMcfd to its maximum capacity
of 750 MMcfd. PTT also plans to install a gas compression facility
at Erawan field to raise the third gas line’s total throughput capacity
to 1,900 MMcfd in 2010, when additional supplies from fields in
the southern gulf become available.

Chevron to increase Keystone storage capacity

Chevron Pipe Line Co. plans to expand the working gas capacity
of its Keystone Gas Storage facility to 7 bcf from 5 bcf. Keystone is
a high-deliverability natural gas storage salt cavern in the Permian
basin production region of West Texas.
The company will hold an open season in third quarter to
gauge interest in firm gas storage services for the additional 2 bcf
of capacity, expected to be realized from two additional caverns
scheduled to be completed in early 2010.
The project has received Texas Railroad Commission approvals and
permits to develop these caverns—the facility’s sixth and seventh. The
fifth cavern was placed in service during fourth-quarter 2006.
The planned expansion is expected to increase the facility’s injection capability by 40 MMcfd to 200 MMcfd. The facility’s withdrawal capability currently is 400 MMcfd.
Keystone, which has been in service since September 2002,
connects to the pipelines of El Paso Natural Gas, Transwestern Gas
Co., and Northern Natural Gas Co. These connections allow KeyThailand’s new gas pipeline starts deliveries

Iran’s gasoline fracture
From the perspective of the US and other
nations hoping for stability in the Middle East,
regime change would be more than welcome in
Iran. Any of a number of countries probably would
act to bring change about if it could devise some
promising and acceptable strategy for getting the
job done. So far, no such strategy has emerged.
Maybe it won’t be necessary.
Evidence mounts that in Iraq and Afghanistan
the US and its allies are fighting a proxy war with
the Islamic Republic. Iranian weapons and agents
are turning up in both places. The conflict broadens to the extent US entanglement in Iraq constitutes war against terrorism, Iranian links to which
are well known. Beyond Iraq and Afghanistan, Iran
is believed to support Hamas in Gaza, Hizbollah in
Lebanon, and shady groups in Syria.

Deadly contest
In this deadly contest, events so far favor Iran.
In Iraq, the US is expending lives and resources in
a quagmire with no end in sight. It has lost stature
abroad and political cohesion at home. Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, meanwhile,
courts other Persian Gulf leaders eager to hedge
their bets against a US pull-out from Iraq and
mocks the United Nations with nuclear work.
Iran has much to gain if the US flees Iraq and
by all evidence is pursuing the goal with nasty
enthusiasm. The Islamic Republic acts determined
not only to fill whatever power vacuum might
develop in Iraq but also to amplify its regional
influence, denials notwithstanding, with nuclear
weapons.
Iranian domination of the Persian Gulf would,
among other things, overhaul the oil market. Since
the late 1980s, the Islamic Republic’s consistently
expressed price aggression has been kept in check
by more-sensible gulf producers led by Saudi
Arabia. A nuclear Iran with 4 million b/d of crude
production would tip that balance, especially if
it were able to co-opt Iraqi output destined not
to stay below 2 million b/d forever. And it could
count on help from Venezuela, the maverick
president of which, Hugo Chavez, met recently
in Tehran with Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
For the US and its allies in and out of the gulf,
options are limited. Among the worst of them is
an air raid on Iranian nuclear sites. While possession of nuclear weapons by Iran’s ruling mullahs
is no cheery prospect, preventive incursion would
do more harm than good. Devastation would be
impossible to confine to narrowly targeted air
strikes. Tehran would retaliate with terrorist attacks, producing a body-count contest nobody
wants. Oil prices would zoom.
What’s more, military attacks would give
Ahmadinejad political support he doesn’t now
enjoy. While his international truculence is said to
be popular in Iran, his domestic policies are not.
Indeed, Iran’s large, young, and underemployed
population generally loathes the oppressive clergy
from which Ahmadinejad takes orders. Military
attacks would congeal nationalistic support around
a vile regime.

Better strategy
A better strategy is to let internal pressure
widen Iran’s political fractures. The oil-dependent
Iranian economy is an ironic source of fundamental political weakness. Lavish subsidies of food
and vehicle fuel, much of it imported, keep the
government budget in deficit. Imposition of gasoline rationing late last month, following a 25%
price hike in May, was a sure sign of strain. The
move provoked riots and the torching of service
stations in several cities. On July 3, during a news
blackout, the Energy Committee of the Iranian
parliament said the government would amend the
rationing order to supply motorists “according to
their real needs within the next 2 months” and
called on the cabinet to supply the fuel.
The promise might relax immediate tensions.
That it had to be made, however, signals the
inevitably approaching end to Tehran’s ability to
buy political calm with cheap fuel. A large fracture
then will grow. It will be a step of unpredictable
importance toward regime change. For outsiders,
it will be a time to keep warplanes in their hangars
and to imagine a world in which Iran shuns the
role of international menace. ✦

Geologic knowledge can provide
vital information for scientists modeling the climate, said Eric J. Barron, dean

OF

of the Jackson School of Geosciences at
the University of Texas, Austin.
Climate models create mathematical representations of
atmospheric patterns and
ocean movements. The
current focus is on models that relate temperature to concentrations
of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere.
Scientists are developing increasingly
sophisticated models that explain and
project climate change.
For oil and gas exploration, climate
modeling is a concept that has come
and gone and now come again, Barron said. Scientists report great strides
since 20-25 years ago in their ability to
generate simulations that accurately examine specific time periods and basins.
“The geologic record is a window
on how the earth can change,” Barron
said of the emerging climate-change
science. “I like to say that climate modeling brings the discipline of forecasting to the geologic record.”
He serves on an Association of
American Petroleum Geologists special
committee on climate changes. At the
AAPG April convention in Long Beach,
Calif., he presented a paper entitled “Is
It Time for a Rebirth in the Geologic
Applications of Climate Models?”
The committee is evaluating AAPG’s
policy statement on climate change,
which Barron calls “a fast-moving field
in some ways.” The committee addresses whether AAPG should renew its
statement to reflect growing public con-

cern about climate change. “We’re also
looking for the opportunity to provide
more education for AAPG members on

climate change topics.”
Climate projections have informed
decision-makers worldwide about water
resource management, ecosystems
maintenance, and alternative energy
development. Despite an inherent uncertainty in climate models, the science
is gaining corporate attention as executives across all types of industries try to
address global warming issues.
“It used to be that many of the automakers and oil and gas companies had
mixed views about the issue of global
warming,” Barron said. “But I think the
debate is being more broadly engaged
than it ever has been. In my opinion,
when this country starts talking about
energy issues and global warming, it’s
almost as if you are for or against—you
can do it this way but not that way.
I hope we are coming to realize that
there are all sorts of degrees, issues, and
responses. We can actually address them
quite intelligently if we set out to do
so.”

energy policy with climate policy, Barron notes that industrialized countries
are better able to address environmental
issues
than
many
developing countries are. “It’s very clear
that the countries that have the most
problems associated with any kind
of environmental change are those
countries that do not have economies
that enable them to address issues. So I
think robust economies are much more
capable of addressing these issues. It’s
hard to separate energy from economic
well-being.”

Climate models
Climate modeling stems from science that started in the 1920s to predict
weather. But climate modeling differs greatly from weather forecasting.
Weather forecasters are concerned about
near-term, localized phenomena while
climate modelers are concerned with
long-term, large-scale features and variables that respond to external pressures,
called forcings. The models involve
land, oceans, ice, interactive atmospheric aerosols, atmospheric chemistry, and
the carbon cycle.
Climate models are very complex.
Hundreds of independent teams having diverse expertise are comparing
models primarily based on simulations
performed in 2004-05 for the United
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Barron said climate models can be
applied to geological information in
two ways. One involves improving
knowledge of climate change so scientists can better project the future, and
the other involves new ways of studying
Earth’s history.
In the typical model study of future
climates, scientists study the period
from 1895 to 2100. For the first 100
years, researchers have information to
compare against their models, but they
lack this information for the next century. Various models get very different results for the next century. The question

confronting climate modelers is whether
they can believe models based on simulating 100 years of history in which the
changes were relatively modest.
“A great deal of change has a lot of
significance for humans, while a little
change has much less significance for
humans,” Barron said. “One application here is the geologic record is a
wonderful way to explore the versatility
and capability of climate models. How
well can you predict the past? The one
thing geology has is abundant examples
of climate change. So can we replicate
those changes? If we can then we certainly are adding insight.”
The second application is exploration of past time periods. In the study
of Earth’s history, researchers start
with a set of observations. These can
be derived from cores or outcrops
containing pollen or isotopes that

Career highlights
Eric J. Barron joined the University
of Texas at Austin as dean of the Jackson School of Geosciences in 2006. He
succeeded William L. Fisher. Barron’s
research interests are climatology, numerical modeling, and Earth history.
Previously, he was dean of the
College of Earth and Mineral Sciences
at Penn State. Before that he directed
Pennsylvania State University’s College
of Earth and Mineral Sciences Earth
System Science Center and was a
geosciences professor.

Education
Barron has a BS degree in geology
from Florida State University and a MS
degree in oceanography and a Ph.D in
oceanography from the University of
Miami.

Organizations
Barron belongs to the American
Geophysical Union and the American
Association for the Advancement of Science. He has chaired several national
research boards, including the Board on
Atmospheric Sciences and Climate of
the National Academies (1997-2003).
He is chairman of the Consortium for
Ocean Leadership, a combination of the
former Consortium for Oceanographic
Research and Education with the Joint
Oceanographic Research Institutions.

document past conditions.
“You constantly try to build a bigger
picture from a limited number of observations,” Barron said. “You come up
with this bigger picture, and you test it
by trying to gather some more observations. A really good model gives you the
potential to say, ‘OK, I know what the
physical geography of the continent was,
and I know a lot of the conditions. What
environment do I predict for a time period in the past?’ Then all those observations become an opportunity to prove
whether you did it right or wrong.”
Climate modelers try to make world
reconstruction projections that are independent of key observations, Barron
said. If the observations fit the predictions, then scientists have more confidence when they look at geographic
areas lacking many observations.
Barron said: “It’s a way to fill in a
lot of the holes if you can prove your
predictions work well. If you attempt
to reconstruct a past set of conditions,
you tend to think rather simply about
particular variables: Was it hot or cold?
Was it dry or wet? Whereas what you
are looking at could be one wet season
and one dry season....
“The type of information that you
derive could turn out to provide much
more insight as well. Not only are you
filling in the gaps but you are starting to tie what you see in the geologic record with a more defined set of
physical variables. For instance, consider
predicting severe weather in the past.
Storms are capable of moving the sediments and altering the record.”
Tsunamis and hurricanes inundate coastal regions, depositing sandy
sediment across broad areas. Scientists
believe identifying a sandy bed in the
geologic record as a tsunami or hurricane deposit is crucial to accurately
identifying a recurrent interval, which
in turn could produce a statistical measurement regarding the probability of
future tsunamis or hurricanes.
The variables in a climate model
also are crucial to the model’s accuracy.
For instance, scientists are examining
whether greenhouse gases (GHGs)

influenced past climates. Ice cores document past GHG levels. When building
climate models, scientists could not
get the models to simulate past climate
change unless they considered changes
in CO2 levels. Although scientists are not
sure why the CO2 levels changed, research indicates the changes contribute
to observed warming. Climate scientists
examine the cause-effect relationship
between CO2 levels and warming.
Climate models project additional

warming on a global scale. About 30
major centers for atmospheric or ocean
research develop climate models.
Universities involved in climate
modeling in Earth history are the
University of California, Santa Cruz; the
University of New Mexico; the University of Michigan; Purdue University;
and Penn State.
Barron said the list of universities
involved is growing, and he believes climate models will continue to improve.

“If you have confidence that these
models can predict the past, it starts to
give you more confidence that they can
predict the future. There are definite
flaws. There are definitely things in
Earth history that we are having trouble
predicting,” Barron said. “There are
cases where you can safely say we don’t
understand this problem well enough.
There are other cases fitting exactly as
predicted, and that’s where you start to
believe you have something to say.” ✦

Loss of three companies could hurt Venezuelan investment
Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
The withdrawal of ExxonMobil
Corp., ConocoPhilips, and Petro-Canada from Venezuela under government
pressure to nationalize private industry
in that country could potentially limit
the development of four heavy-crude
projects, that could produce 600,000
b/d from the Orinoco reserve, analysts
say.
ExxonMobil and ConocoPhilips
quit their Venezuelan operations when
officers of the two companies refused
to sign a memorandum of understanding that would make them minority
partners in multibillion-dollar heavy-oil
projects after surrendering controlling
ownership to Petroleos de Venezuela SA
(PDVSA), the national oil company.
Petro-Canada, Calgary, said it also
is pulling out of Venezuela, having
rejected new nationalistic terms for oil
projects and passed its working interest in an oil discovery to the Venezuelan
government. Through its predecessors,
Petro-Canada has had assets in Venezuela since 1996.
In western Venezuela, Petro-Canada
holds a 50% working interest in the
ExxonMobil-operated La Ceiba Block on
the eastern shores of Lake Maracaibo.
The partners submitted a field development plan to PDVSA and the Venezuelan government in December 2005.
In March 2006 PDVSA shut down
20

ExxonMobil’s 12,000 b/d production
from La Ceiba oil field. Petro-Canada
said at that time its production had
already been shut in. PDVSA gave no
reason for its decision to halt the loading of oil from La Ceiba (OGJ Online,
Mar. 24, 2006).
Prior to the expropriation of its
interests, ConocoPhillips held a 50.1%
interest in Petrozuata, a 40% interest
in Hamaca, and a 32.5% interest in
Corocoro heavy oil projects in Venezuela (OGJ Online, June 27, 2007). The
only operation ConocoPhillips retains
in Venezuela is a minority interest in
development of an offshore natural gas
field.
The company said it expects to
record a complete impairment of its entire interest in its oil projects in Venezuela of $4.5 billion, before and after tax,
in its second-quarter financial results.
Although hopeful that the negotiations
will be successful, ConocoPhillips has
“preserved all legal rights including
international arbitration,” it said.
Negotiations for compensation
settlements for the international companies could last for up to 6 months and
must go to international arbitration if
no accord is reached. In the process, US
companies may seek to attach PDVSA
assets in the US, such as refineries of its
subsidiary, Citgo Petroleum, pending
a final agreement. Venezuela President
Hugo Chavez has said he might sell

Citgo or cut off oil sales to the US,
which gets 14% of its oil imports from
Venezuela.
A number of relief options may be
available to the companies, said Neil
Popovic, an attorney in the law offices
of Heller Ehrman, and Alex Lathrop, a
member of Heller Ehrman’s Insurance
Recovery Group. “Among these are
political risk insurance (PRI), bilateral
investment treaties (BITs) and other
analogous bilateral and multilateral
treaties, and any investment agreement
between the company and the host government. For some companies, recovering under a PRI policy and assigning
their direct claims against the host
government to their insurer may be
preferable to direct arbitration against
the host government,” they said (OGJ,
June 25, 2007, p. 20).

ExxonMobil
In response to Venezuela’s demand
for a 60% or more stake in the Orinoco basin heavy oil projects by May
1, ExxonMobil announced Mar. 1 that
it would hand over to PDVSA operations of Cerro Negro—one of the four
Orinoco basin oil fields that it operates
as part of a JV with BP. ExxonMobil has
not yet indicated what other steps it
might take. Attempts to reach company
representatives at presstime last week in
Houston and at its Irving, Tex., headquarters were unsuccessful.
ExxonMobil was the only major

international oil company to challenge
Venezuela’s 2004 royalty increase on
heavy oil production and the only one
to sell its interest in a field to avoid
having to negotiate a new contract
with PDVSA as the operator. In 2006, it
ceased investments and postponed drilling in Venezuela.
ExxonMobil sold its 25% interest in
Venezuela’s Quiamare-La Ceiba field to
Repsol YPF SA, which held the remaining 75% interest. The field, located in
Anzoategui, produces 15,000 b/d of oil.
Repsol YPF agreed to migrate the terms
of the field’s contract to a joint venture
that PDVSA controlled under changes in
the country’s hydrocarbons law. PDVSA
subsequently removed ExxonMobil from
a multibillion-dollar petrochemical project, claiming the company was holding
up the project launch.
ExxonMobil has no other operations
in the country, having earlier sold its 49
branded gas stations in Venezuela.

that time, almost 60 foreign companies,
many from the US, participated in the
Venezuelan oil sector at the government’s invitation.
In recent years as rising oil prices
spurred the country’s rapid economic
growth, Venezuela’s gross domestic
product increased by 17.9% in 2004,
9.3% in 2005, and 10.4% in 2006.
The Venezuelan government then
sought a greater share of revenue by
forcing renegotiation of contracts and
by nationalizing entire companies. In
2005, Venezuela gave foreign oil companies operating conventional oil fields
1 year to convert their service contracts
into joint venture agreements under
which PDVSA was to be granted the
minimum 60% stake. In April 2006, after Total SA and Eni SPA refused to enter
into the proposed JV agreements, the
Venezuelan government seized the oil
fields operated by those two companies.

their stakes or acceded to the governOther companies’ actions

That move is part of Chavez’s nationalization drive that includes taking over
US companies’ assets in telecommunications and electrical power.
Four other international companies—Chevron Corp., Statoil AS, BP PLC,
and Total SA—apparently accepted the
accord that will keep them in the massive Orinoco projects.

Seeking more investment
Despite the expropriations, the
Chavez government hopes to attract
more than $21 billion in foreign investment to boost Venezuela’s oil production to 5.2 million b/d by 2012, up
from 2.4 million b/d currently. The
fourth-largest producer among the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Venezuela plans to spend $77
billion over the next 5 years.
However, analysts say the nationalization program likely will disrupt those
plans. Venezuela’s oil production has
fallen 25% since Chavez took office in
1999, largely as a result of the layoffs
of more than 20,000 experienced
PDVSA engineers and executives after
they joined a 2002-03 strike to remove
Chavez from office. ✦

to combat climate change, and create

Critics said provisions that would

called independence from foreign oil “a

GENERAL INTEREST
that the Blue Dog Coalition “should
steer the majority ship when it comes
to crafting a substantive and comprehensive energy policy.”
The fiscally conservative Blue Dog
coalition of Democrats was formed in
1995 with an aim of representing the
House’s political center. Its core beliefs
include a commitment to US financial
stability and national security, according
to a statement at the group’s web site.
Reps. Jim Matheson of Utah and
Charlie Melancon of Louisiana, both
members of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, cochaired the
Blue Dog Energy Task Force, which produced the eight principles dealing with
energy production, climate change, fuel
diversity, and technology development.
Matheson said the first principle
applies the “pay as you go” concept
to domestic energy. “America’s energy
policy cannot depend solely on a future
technological breakthrough. We have
diverse energy resources in America
today, and we can’t discard any of them.
Until technology catches up, a reliable
supply of conventional fuels is essential
for our economy,” he explained.
The principle states that US energy
policy should not reduce access to domestic resources, domestic infrastructure, or incentives for domestic production unless there is a corresponding
initiative to replace lost capabilities.
While renewable resources are increasingly contributing to energy supply, the Blue Dog Coalition considers
oil, gas, coal, nuclear power, and other
traditional sources key components of
US energy supply.

‘Reliable supply’
“In the long run, alternative fuels
will provide a significant contribution to our country’s energy profile,”
the group says. “Until that takes place,
a reliable supply of conventional fuels
will be important for our economy,
and policies should be directed toward
maintaining domestic conventional
energy capabilities.”
Other group principles address
climate change (which the Blue Dogs
24

believe should be handled with predictable long-term policies that don’t
disproportionately affect one industry
or sector) and fuel diversity (which
the group says should include biofuels,
coal, geothermal, hydroelectric, nuclear,
oil, and gas).
Heavy US reliance on foreign petroleum suppliers contributes to the country’s balance of payments and distorts
foreign policy by encouraging energy
development in unstable regions, according to the Blue Dogs. They consider
encouraging domestic exploration and
production of petroleum “a responsible
component of a national energy policy.”
The group also considers renewable
energy “the key to long-term energy
security” and recommends that the
federal government invest substantially
to help develop wind, solar, biomass,
fuel cells, and other sustainable energy
technologies. “Congress should also
extend the wind energy production
tax credit to provide greater long-term
market certainty,” it says.
The Blue Dogs also call for consistent
and transparent federal energy policies; keeping energy affordable with
consistent rates and access to supplies;
encouraging investments in electricity transmission systems, distributed
generation, and a more efficient grid;
promoting development of cleaner
technologies with substantial federal investments in research; and encouraging
adoption of more-efficient technologies
to reduce consumption.

Support for principles
NAM’s Engler said the Blue Dog
Coalition’s energy principles are “highly
consistent” with his association’s energy
and economic security plan, which also
supports domestic energy production,
diversity, and technology development.
“When you restrict the domestic
supply, it’s only logical that prices will
go up. Continuing down this path is not
just bad policy, it’s bad economics,” he
said.
IPAA’s Russell said oil and gas currently represent about 65% of total US
energy supplies and will continue to be

significant as domestic demand grows
by 30% by 2030. “Legislation that
reduces the ability of American oil and
gas producers to invest in the United
States means higher costs for consumers and more dependence on foreign,
often unstable, supplies. National energy policy needs to expand all of our
energy resources, not pit one against
another,” he said.
Policies that support steady additions
to domestic energy supplies are essential, American Petroleum Institute Pres.
Red Cavaney said in a June 29 letter to
members of the 110th Congress. “These
policies ought to encourage development of every viable form of energy
and more efficient use of each of them.
However, an ‘either-or’ policy—one that
favors alternative energy at the expense
of oil and natural gas—is short-sighted
and could end up harming both consumers and the economy,” he said.
Two days before Pelosi’s announcement, the House voted to renew a
26-year-old moratorium on new federal
oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf and make it part of the
US Department of Interior’s fiscal 2008
budget. ✦

Pearce said several members of New Jersey’s congressional
delegation have expressed concern over the possibility of a
spill in the proposed leasing area off Virginia reaching their
state’s coast. “Currents running immediately offshore Virginia
are southerly and, farther out, run straight out to sea. We believe the chances that a spill would reach New Jersey’s coast are
minimal,” Cruickshank replied.
“Including Virginia in the 5-year plan will provide answers.
It would be short-sighted not to seek them, as I believe the
majority of Americans want to know how extensive our domestic resources are,” said one witness, Rep. Thelma Drake (RVa.), a former subcommittee member whose district includes
much of Virginia’s coast.
She and Virginia State Sen. Frank Wagner (R-Virginia Beach)
separately noted that the state sought assurances in its energy
plan that any federal leasing would take place an appropriate
distance from shore. They criticized the new 5-year plan because it gives the state a much smaller potential federal leasing
area because of Virginia’s concave coast.
But Drake reiterated that it’s important to learn just how
much natural gas is out there. “All the renewable energy we
could produce won’t keep our homes warm and our lights
on. We must allow MMS to determine how extensive our OCS
resources are,” she maintained.
Not every Virginian supports OCS leasing off the state’s
coast. Albert Pollard, a former member of Virginia’s house
of delegates, told the subcommittee that outside the Virginia
Beach region in Wagner’s district, the state has the largest
coastal pristine acreage on the eastern seaboard. Production
from offshore leases would not occur for at least 10 years, he
added. ✦

MMS royalty in-kind program
exceeds revenue goals
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent

sales@intelliserv.net

The US Minerals Management Service’s crude oil and natural gas royalty in-kind program continued to exceed its goals
during fiscal 2006, reported the Department of the Interior
June 28. Financial returns increased, administrative costs decreased, and compliance cycles shortened, it said in an annual
report delivered to Congress a day earlier.
The RIK program is now in its third year of full operation,
said acting MMS Director Walter D. Cruickshank. He said the
program generated $26.2 million more in revenues during the
year than what would have been received if the government
had taken its royalties “in value,” as cash payments from producers. Combined with a $2.6 million gain from additional

interest on RIK revenue received 5-10 days earlier than under
a royalty in-value program, additional revenue was $28.8 million during fiscal 2006, Cruickshank said.
This followed $32 million of additional revenue in fiscal
2005 and $18 million more in fiscal 2004. With the fiscal
2006 increase, federal revenue under the RIK program has
been more than $78 million above what it would have been
under an RIV system, the MMS official said.
Under the RIK program, the federal government takes its oil
royalties “in kind” as product, which is then sold competitively
on the open market. MMS received and sold nearly 75.3 million boe in kind, valued at more than $4 billion, during fiscal
2006, the agency said. The Gulf of Mexico remains the core
source for RIK crude, it added.
The program has drawn fire from House Natural Resources
Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall (D-W.Va.), who noted
during a May 23 hearing on HR 2337—the Energy Reform
and Revitalization Act—that the US Department of Justice is
investigating the operation. MMS subsequently said DOJ’s inquiry came in response to findings by DOI’s inspector general.
The bill, which the committee approved in mid-June, includes
a provision that would limit RIK payments to crude used to
refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Cruickshank said that by the end of fiscal 2006, MMS took
in kind about 72% of the crude oil and 45% of the natural gas
royalty volumes produced daily in the gulf. The agency began
taking gas in kind for federal production in Wyoming in April
2006 at the rate of 30,000 MMbtu/day, he added.
MMS and the US Department of Energy also will use the
RIK program to begin filling the SPR during July, with an
initial 50,000 b/d from the crude oil portfolio, Cruickshank
said. MMS will continue to use RIK sales in tandem with RIV
payments, depending on the particular business case, to ensure
a fair return on federal royalty assets, he said. ✦

Chavez returned home last
week, fresh from visits that sought to
strengthen political ties with fellow
oil producers Russia and Iran.
In Moscow on June 28 Chavez said

They didn’t leave; he pushed them
out. Last February, Chavez ordered
exploration by international companies
to be run under joint ventures with local companies. He even set a minimum
stake of 60% for the local players.

Meanwhile, he said, “We need a
strong and strengthening Russia.” The
president stressed that Caracas “does
not want war but wants peace.”
He insisted that “if the US dares to
invade Venezuela...we are ready to

Located in the northern edge of the
Qilian Mountain fold belt in western
China, the Jiuxi basin is a MesozoicCenozoic foreland basin with Lower
Cretaceous source rocks and TertiaryCretaceous reservoirs.
This is the first of two parts on the
course of exploration and a relatively
recent discovery that has implications
for broader exploration in foreland
basins and thrust
belts elsewhere.
The Jiuxi basin
is small but has 67
years of exploration history.
Five Tertiary
anticline oil fields
had been found in the foreland thrust
belt at the southern margin of the basin
with oil in place of 61.61 million tons
from 1950 to 1960 and a peak production of 1.4 million tons in 1959. Since
then, no discoveries were been made
until the late 1990s, and production
gradually declined to 0.4 million to 0.6
million tons/year.
In 1983, exploration turned to
the source depression, i.e. the Qingxi
Depression, and oil discovery peaked
in the Jiuxi basin. In 1998 a high oil
flow from the Lower Cretaceous was
encountered in test well Liu 102 in the
Liugouzhuang structure; and Qingxi field, the largest in the basin, was
found. Since the discovery, 41 wells
have been drilled, proved reserves have
reached 58 million tons, and the basin’s
production is 80 million tons/year.

The discovery of Qingxi field in the
Jiuxi basin is an example of successful
exploration in foreland thrust belts. The
key factors for the success include deepened geological understanding, improved seismic imaging in hilly areas,
better identification of reservoirs, and
good reservoir stimulation. This success
provides hope for finding new oil and
gas fields in other foreland basins, especially their thrust belts, in central and
western China.
The case study of the Qingxi field
discovery in this article sheds light
on future hydrocarbon exploration in
thrust belts of foreland basins in China
and other parts of the world.

Introduction
Foreland basins and their thrust belts
are some of the world’s most petroliferous areas with a great hydrocarbon
exploration potential.1
Mann and Gahagan2 classified six
kinds of tectonic settings according to
the evolution history of hydrocarbons
and found that, among 595 giant oil
and gas fields with reserves over 500
million bbl or equivalent gas, 141 are
in collisional margins produced by
terminal collision between two continents, and 44 are in collisional margins
produced by overthrusting of volcanic
arcs onto a passive margin. Pettingill3
showed that 58% of 76 giant fields
discovered in 1990-99 are in collisional
tectonic settings, including fold belts,
foreland, and foredeep.
The multiple stages of tectonic evo-

many small and medium-sized oil fields
were discovered.
In the 1990s, improved hilly seismic
technology and drilling and welllogging technology under complex
geological conditions (e.g., complex
structures and high temperature and
abnormal formation pressure) enabled discovery of a group of oil and
gas fields in foreland regions, which
increased reserves dramatically.
In the late 1990s, Qingxi field was
discovered after 67 years of exploration in the mature Jiuxi basin. It is a
great example of successful exploration
in Chinese foreland basins and shows
the great potential of hydrocarbon
discoveries in many other thrust belts
in west and central China. The success
also demonstrates that good geological
understanding and wise application of
new technology can make great discoveries in mature foreland regions.

The Jiuxi basin is located in the Hexi
Corridor, northwestern China, bounded
by the Alashan landmass in the north,
Qilian Mountains in the south, Jiayuguan uplift in the east, and Arkin strikeslip fault belt in the west (Fig. 1).6
It is one of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic
foreland basins along northern front of
the Qilian Mountains and covers 2,700
sq km (Figs. 1 and 2).

Stratigraphy
The Jiuxi foreland basin developed
overlying a pre-Jurassic folded basement. Basin fill consists of Carboniferous, Permian, Lower-Middle Triassic,
Lower-Middle Jurassic, Lower Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary, dominantly nonmarine deposits (Fig. 3).
The basement of folded and metamorphosed Lower Paleozoic rocks
consists of extremely thick marine
deposits.7 The Devonian contains mainly

Stage of basement formation. The northern
Qilian oceanic basin underwent convergence closure at the end of the Caledonian Orogeny to form the northern
Qilian orogenic belt was amalgamated
with the northern Alashan landmass. Together they formed the folded basement
for the overlying Mesozoic-Neozoic
basins in the Hexi Corridor.
During Early and Middle Devonian,
piedmont molasses were deposited on
the edge of the northern Qilian fold
belt. During Carboniferous and the
earliest Permian, a mixed marine-nonmarine coal-bearing succession was
deposited associated with an extensive
marine transgression.
After a hiatus, typical continental
clastic rocks were deposited during the
Early-Middle Triassic. Thereafter, Upper
Triassic was absent probably due to
regional uplift associated with the Indosinian Orogeny.
Stage of pull-apart and rift basin. The
amalgamation of the Qinghai-Tibet
Plate with the Northern China Plate in
Jurassic and Early Cretaceous caused
the northeastern movement of both the
Qilian fold belt and the Alashan Massif via strike-slipping along the Arkin
fracture.6
A more rapid eastward movement of
the Alashan Massif caused a clockwise
transtensional movement at the joint
between the Qilian fold belt and the
Alashan Massif, resulting in sets of NEoriented fractures and transtensional rift
basins11 (Fig. 4). Depocenters at both
the northern and southern ends of the
rift basins were filled with lacustrine
facies.

Crude bitumen is a viscous mixture
of hydrocarbons that does not flow into
a well naturally. The bitumen occurs
in both sand (clastic) and carbonate
formations, which are referred to as the
oil sands. EUB’s report also includes as
bitumen some heavy oil resources lying
in these same areas that can be produced by primary means.
The report says that the oil sands
area contains 15 deposits, occupying a
54,000 sq mile area (Table 3). The main
deposits are the Athabasca Wabiskaw-

average price of $97.11 (Can.)/acre.
Alberta holds public offerings of
mineral rights every 2 weeks and issues
leases or permits through a competitive
and confidential bidding system. The
highest bid wins the right to drill for
and recover the minerals.
Leases typically have a primary 15year term and can be extended, depending on the exploration work and if
the lease is on production.

EUB updated the resources in the
Athabasca Wabiskaw-McMurray in 2005
and slightly revised them in 2006. It
updated the Cold Lake Clearwater and
Cold Lake Wabiskaw-McMurray deposit
also in 2006.
In its latest report, EUB updated the
Peace River Bluesky-Gething and found
them to be more areally extensive than
previously published.
The report says that these four
deposits contain more than 60% of the
total initial in-place bitumen resource
and about 86% of the in-place resource
found in clastics.
Of the 173 billion bbl remaining
established reserves, EUB considers 82%
or 141.7 billion bbl recoverable with in
situ methods and the remaining 31.5
billion bbl recoverable with surface
mining.
The currently active mining and
in situ areas contain about 21 billion
bbl out of the 173 billion bbl deemed
recoverable.
EUB’s report explains that bitumen
saturation varies within a reservoir,
decreasing as the reservoir shale or clay
content increases or as the porosity decreases. Increased water saturation also
decreases the amount of bitumen in the
pore space.
The resource evaluation expresses
bitumen saturation as mass per cent
in sands and per cent pore volume in
carbonates. In Cretaceous sands, the
assessment used a minimum bitumen

saturation cutoff of 3% mass and a
minimum 1.5-m saturated zone thickness for in situ areas.
As of yearend 1999, EUB increased
cutoffs to 6% mass and 3.0-m for areas
amenable to surface mining.
In the carbonate deposits, the assessment used a cutoff of 30% bitumen
saturation and a minimum 5% porosity.
EUB notes that the oil sands quality
cutoff of 6% mass is more reasonable
and plans to use that value in future resource updates. It adds that a change to
6% from 3% would reduce the bitumen
in place as follows:
• Athabasca Wabiskaw-McMurray—20%.
• Cold Lake Clearwater—35%.
• Peace River Bluesky-Gething—
50%.
EUB, however, also notes that new
drilling may offset these reductions. For
instance, in the Peace River BlueskyGething deposit, its update showed a
slight increase of in-place resources due
to drilling that extended the deposit
especially to the northeast.
The report assumed a cutoff depth
of 250 ft to separate mined and in situ
resources, although it noted that some
resources above a 250-ft depth might
be produced with in situ methods. It
identified potential mined areas using
economic strip ratio (ESR) criteria, a
minimum bitumen saturation cutoff of
7% mass, and a minimum 3.0-m saturated zone thickness cutoff.
The evaluation applied a combined
82% mining-extraction recovery factor
to the resource volume, which reflects
the combined loss, on average 18% of
the in-place volume by the mining operations and the extraction facilities.
For in situ areas amenable for thermal, EUB used a minimum 10.0-m
zone thickness in all deposits except
the Athabasca Wabiskaw-McMurray, in
which it used a 15.0-m cutoff in the
Wabiskaw zones.
In primary development, EUB used
a minimum 3.0-m zone thickness or
lower if current production is from a
zone with less thickness.
For in situ areas, EUB used a miniOil & Gas Journal / July 9, 2007

in future reports. The evaluation applied a 20% recovery factor for thermal
projects and a 5% recovery factor for
primary projects.
EUB noted that the deposit-wide
recovery factor for thermal development is less than in some of the active
projects so as to account for uncertainties. It also is currently reviewing these
overall recovery factors.
For thermal commercial projects in
the Peace River, Athabasca, and Cold
Lake areas, the evaluation used 40, 50,
and 25% recovery factors, respectively
to reflect various steaming strategies
and project designs.

At yearend 2006, the EUB report says
about two-thirds of the initial minable established reserves were under
active development. The developments
48

that EUB considers active are the three
projects on production and Fort Hills,
Horizon, and Jackpine. The report does
not consider the recently approved Kearl

Special Report

mine in the active projects.
Companies have drilled most of the
in situ producing wells in the oil sands
as deviated wells from pads to minimize
the drilling and production footprint.
EUB’s report says that from 1985
through yearend 2006, companies had
drilled 29,558 wells to explore for
and develop oil sands (Table 4). About
8,500 wells were producing during
2006, with the average well producing
61 bo/d (Fig. 2).
EUB noted that upgrading the
mined bitumen yielded 240 million
bbl of synthetic crude oil (SCO), while
companies mainly marketed production
from most in situ projects as nonupgraded crude bitumen.
Fig. 3 shows the history of mined
bitumen production in Alberta, starting with production from the Great
Canadian Oil Sands (Suncor) project in
1967. Also shown is the price of SCO
from 1971, which the EUB report says
is generally at a premium to light crude
oil.
Fig. 4 shows the historical production and price of in situ bitumen
produced in Alberta. Imperial Oil Ltd.’s
Cold Lake cyclic-steam-stimulation
recovery project has accounted for most
of the in situ production. EUB says Cold
Lake’s price generally follows the light
crude oil price but at a discount of
between 50 and 60%.
The EUB estimates that bitumen production will more than double by 2016
to about 3 million b/d (Fig. 5).
EUB assumed that West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil would average
$62/bbl in 2007 and rise to $69/bbl
by 2016.
EUB expects upgraded bitumen
product to increase more than threefold, from 661,000 b/d in 2006 to
1.898 million b/d by 2016.
If production follows the forecast,
Alberta will required additional crude
oil pipeline capacity by 2010-2012.
EUB also expects exports of SCO
products will increase from 63% of the
total SCO production in 2006 to 83%
of SCO production by 2016.

Special Report

Upgrading, transportation
Upgrading converts bitumen and
heavy crude oil into SCO by adding
hydrogen, subtracting carbon, or doing both. The process also may remove
sulfur in either its elemental form or as
a part of the oil sands coke.
EUB’s report says companies stockpile most oil sands coke, with some
small amounts being burned to generate electricity. Companies also either
stockpile elemental sulfur or ship it
to facilities that convert it to sulfuric
acid, which mainly is used in fertilizer
manufacturing.
Pipeline transport of bitumen crude
requires addition of a diluent such as a
lighter viscosity product, which in Alberta is mainly pentanes plus. Pentanes
plus represent about 30% of the blend
volumes. These diluents are recycled if
the blend has an Alberta destination but
usually not returned to the province
from markets outside Alberta, according
to EUB’s report.
Companies can use SCO as a diluent, although this requires a volume
of about 50% SCO in the blend. Other
used diluents are naphtha and light
crude oil.
Heated and insulated pipelines decrease the amount of diluent required
diluent.
EUB’s forecast of upgrading considered potential production from existing facilities and supply from future
projects, as follows:
• Suncor’s existing production and
expected expansions, including Voyageur and Voyageur South.
• Syncrude’s existing production and
expected expansions, including Stage 3
with start-up in 2006 and the Stage 3
debottleneck of the four-stage project
that began in 1996.
• Albian Sands’ existing project and
debottlenecking projects and expansion, approved by EUB in November
2006 and scheduled for completion by
yearend 2010.
• CNRL’s Horizon project, approved
by the EUB in January 2004 and with

Refiners in the US and operators in
Canada are adding capacity to handle
additional volumes of bitumen and
synthetic crude oils from increased oil
sands production. Rising crude prices
in the past few years and increased demand for refined products have pushed
up oil sands production substantially
(see article on p. 43).
Producers also have to decide what

men blend (dilbit).
According to a 2006 study from
Canada’s National Energy Board, the
light-heavy crude price differential will
remain wide for the next several years
until sufficient upgrading capacity is
added.1 Because international heavy
crude output is also rising, NEB predicts
that Canadian crude will continue to be
heavily discounted.
Core markets for oil sands
crudes include Canada, US Petroleum Administration for Defense
District (PADD) II, PADD IV, and
Washington state.1 Canadian
producers are also considering
expansion into markets in the US
Mideast, US Gulf Coast, and even
perhaps Asia.
Fig. 1 shows that production in
Canadian crude will increase to 3.3

production must either
upgrade bitumen to SCO, or
dilute it to synbit or dilbit, before transporting it to the end
user. Incentives for producers
to invest in processing include
the ability to capture the lightheavy differential. SCO is more
marketable and easier to transport than bitumen blends.
Bitumen requires diluent
blending for pipeline transport,
has a high residual content that
requires more conversion (coking or hydrocracking), and is
of low quality.2 Bitumen is not
a good fit with refineries designed for light, sweet crudes.
It also requires large amounts
of hydrogen for hydroprocessing and creates many unwanted by-products.
SCO, on the other hand, can
have a much higher quality,
depending on the degree of
processing. Premium SCO is
a bottomless, refined product. Sour synthetic is partially

announced that it is proceeding with
detailed engineering for its project that
would nearly double capacity at its
upgrader at Lloydminster to 150,000
b/d by 2009 from its current 80,000
b/d. “It would enable Husky to capture
full value from increased production at
its Cold Lake and Athabasca oil sands
projects,” according to the NEB study.
Husky also announced on May 7
that it is acquiring Valero Energy Corp.’s
165,000-b/sd Lima, Ohio, refinery. The
$1.9 billion sale was to close at the end
of second-quarter 2007. This would

There have been three merchant upgrader proposals announced, according
to the NEB study.
The BA Heartland Upgrader project
will take place in three phases, with the
first phase starting up in early 2008.
The first phase will process 77,000 b/d
of bitumen blend. The project will have
a total processing capacity of 250,000
b/d.
North West Upgrading Inc. is planning to construct a heavy oil upgrader
near Edmonton. The first phase is to
come on stream in early 2010 and will
upgrade 50,000 b/d of bitumen to
SCO, according to NEB. North West is

planning as many as three additional
phases by 2015, with a total processing capacity of 231,000 b/d and would
produce 180,000 b/d of SCO and
42,000 b/d of diluent.
Peace River Oil Upgrading Inc. has
proposed a 20,000-b/d bitumen processing facility near McLennan, Alta.,
according to NEB.

US reﬁning
US refineries are Canada’s largest
market for crude exports and, according
to the NEB study, “possess the greatest
potential for increased penetration of
oil sands derived crude oil.” In 2005,
Canada supplied nearly 10% of US
crude feed.
Fig. 5 shows combined US and
Canada crude production and that falling production in the US will be offset
by more crude from Canada.
In US Petroleum Administration for
Defense District I (East Coast), only the
United Refining Co. refinery, Warren,
Pa., processes western Canadian crude.
In 2005, it processed 21% SCO and 8%
blended bitumen, according to the NEB
study. In September 2006, the company
announced that it was delaying a project for a new coker due to “uncertainty
in the petroleum markets.”
PADD II (US Midwest) is the largest
market for western Canadian crude: In
2005, 70% of western Canada’s crude
exports were to PADD II, according to
NEB. SCO comprised 20% of that volume and blended bitumen was 19%.
Because refineries in Northern PADD
II are complex, they are well positioned
to run more bitumen blends and SCO.
Especially wide light-heavy differentials
are resulting from rising output from
oil sands and conventional production
in Northern states.
“This could be alleviated in the future,” according to NEB, “as a number
of companies identified an interest in
constructing a coker or developing
refinery expansion plans that would
allow them to process heavier crude
oil to take advantage of the light-heavy
differential and the expected increase in
oil sands production.”

Canadian heavy crude has the largest
market share in US Midwest refineries, which processed 3.3 million b/d
of crude in 2005, of which 24% was
heavy sour crude.4 Nearly all was from
Canada. Canadian light crude had a
smaller market share.
PADD III (US Gulf Coast) is an attractive market for Canadian producers due to the complexity of refineries
there. Bitumen blends especially could
compete against imports from Venezuela and Mexico.
PADD IV (US Rocky Mountain)
refineries have traditionally been a
significant market for western Canadian
crudes. Recently, however, higher prices
have resulted in more drilling and
production in the district, according to
NEB.
“Refiners in PADD IV are taking less
western Canadian crude supplies in
order to run the readily available and
heavily discounted Wyoming sweet and
sour crudes,” according to the NEB
study.
“The large discount is in reaction
to aggressive Canadian crude pricing,
shortage of refinery capacity, and the
lack of pipeline capacity to move the
crude oil to other markets. Due to its
size and the complexity of its refineries,
PADD IV will continue to be a marginal
growth market for western Canadian
crude oil, particularly SCO and blended
58

bitumen,” says the study.
It considers PADD V (US West Coast)
a growth market for western Canadian
crude, especially Washington. This is
due to a decline in the availability of
Alaska North Slope crude. In 2006,
Washington received only 11% of its
crude from Canada.
Fig. 6 shows the different markets
and pipeline systems for western Canadian crude.

Market expansion
High oil prices will continue to
compel oil sands expansions. The NEB
study outlined a scenario in which oil
sands crude would expand its markets:
1. Fill existing markets, including
Washington, PADD II, PADD IV, and additional volumes in Canada.
2. Expand into southern PADD II
and PADD III and refinery expansions
and conversions in northern PADD II,
IV, and V. Southern PADD II could take
40,000 b/d more with the expansion
of the Spearhead pipeline, and the US
Gulf Coast could take up to 400,000
b/d if the necessary pipeline capacity
existed. NEB estimates that in the next
10 years, PADD II could take an additional 500,000 b/d.
3. Develop new markets such as
California and Asia. This would require
new pipelines or expansions.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

“Energy security” has
become a key word in
understanding European
politics. Even more than
its world environmental

leadership, the European Union is apparently
defining itself around the need–or the
perceived need–of developing a common energy policy, despite the fact that
under the European Treaty
energy is left
to the member
states.1
The commission,
Europe’s executive body, has set three goals for its
energy policy:
1. Creation of an internal market.
2. Security of supply.
3. Promotion of environmental
sustainability.
The idea that Europe’s energy supplies are not secure enough rests upon
the belief that Europe’s increasing
dependence on imported hydrocarbons
“carries political and economic risks.”2
There are at least two reasons for this.
One is merely ideological or political: It has to do with the myth that
energy, as a strategic sector, should be
produced domestically, as well as with
Europe’s obsession with decreasing the

carbon component of its economy.
There is also a more pragmatic
reason: Europe depends upon a small
number of providers especially for
natural gas, which in turn is becoming the single most important energy
source for the continent. This helps to
explain why for Europe, LNG is not just
another way to meet its energy needs: It
is also a political challenge.
According to the commission,
indeed, to promote energy security
“Projects should be developed to bring
gas from new regions, to set up new
gas hubs in central Europe and the
Baltic countries, to make better use of
strategic storage possibilities, and to
facilitate the construction of new liquid
natural gas terminals.”3

European situation
Europe is becoming increasingly
dependent on natural gas because such
fuel is, at the same time, economically
competitive and environment friendly.
Compared with other fossil fuels, its
greenhouse gas emissions are significantly lower. In fact, the amount of CO2
emissions produced per unit of electricity generated by the burning of natural
gas are, respectively, 49% and 32%
lower than with coal or oil.4
European consumption of electricity is growing as well, and electricity
is increasingly generated by natural

Concerns
European policy-makers find such a
scenario concerning for two reasons.
One is merely political: As Europe
learned at its own expense, its reliance
on Russia in particular carries risks as
well as benefits. While Russia’s proven
gas reserves are the largest in the world,
Pres. Vladimir Putin is clearly aiming to
consolidate his regional leadership by
using gas as a political weapon. In January 2006 he turned off gas to Ukraine–
a transit country for pipelines to Europe–which did not hesitate to take gas
from the flow headed westwards.
Even though the practical loss of gas

gas, which apparently is more socially
accepted than coal and nuclear. As a
result, the European energy mix is shifting from being coal and nuclear-based
towards being based upon natural gas,
both in absolute and relative terms, as
Figs. 1 and 2 show.
What these figures don’t show is
that natural gas is becoming even more
fundamental in the EU15, that is, in
Western Europe where demand growth
is slower but environmental requirements, particularly those CO2-related,
are ever more stringent.
As natural gas becomes more important, two other trends are set in motion.
On the one hand, domestic production of methane is steadily declining,
while the relative weight of only two
gas producers, i.e. Russia and Algeria,
increases. While the quota of imported
energy sources in general will increase
to 65% of the total by 2030 from 50%
now, the share of imported gas will
grow to 84% from 54%.
Domestic energy production in the
EU25 grew to 896.6 million tonnes
of oil equivalent (toe) in 2000 from
877.84 in 1990, but then it started to
decline to 888.17 million toe in 2003.
Likewise, natural gas domestic production peaked at 196.66 million toe in
2000 then declined to 189.39 million
toe in 2003. In 2004, EU15 alone relied
on only three countries–Norway, Russia, and Algeria–for more than 80% of
its gas imports (Table 1).

was limited, Europe understood then
that it was at continuous risk of seeing
its deliveries suspended or reduced,
even though it isn’t directly involved
in disputes. Luckily, it is unlikely that
Russia will ever turn off its gas to the
EU, except for short periods of time,
as happened in January 2006. After all,
Russia depends upon European money
as much as Europe depends upon
Russian gas. And, while it is true that
pipelines can’t be redirected so that
Europe has little ability to adjust in the
short term, that is true for Russia as
well: Russia won’t be able to export its
gas elsewhere.
A second and perhaps more serious
problem is Russia’s ability to keep pace
with growing demand, both internal
and external. Russian companies just
can’t afford the investments needed
to develop existing and new fields, let
alone technologies and know-how, and
international oil companies find a hos-

tile and risky environment in Moscow.
According to some experts, then, the
risk that around 2010 Russia will be
unable to meet its supply commitments
is real.
The risk has nothing to do with
physical scarcity of gas; it is caused by
the lack of a stable and investmentfriendly legal framework in Russia, so
that international oil companies hesitate
or are discouraged, while national
companies, including but not limited to
state-owned Gazprom and Rosneft, are
unable to achieve production increases
that are needed.
Correctly or incorrectly, virtually
everybody in Europe agrees that
• Both in the short and long run, the
current state of things is insecure.
• More diversification must be
pursued.
• LNG may be a key step in that
direction.
In fact LNG promises the safest,

Also, there is a scarcity of liquefaction plants, hence of LNG, and gas cargoes around the world, so that unless a
terminal or customer has already signed
or is about to sign long-term contracts
with LNG producers and has secured
cargoes, capacity short fall may be very
real.
Both these problems will be more

an LNG plant near Livorno. According
to Edison, OLT didn’t have a right to
take advantage of simplified procedures
that were allowed. This claim has been
supported by the chief legal officer of
the Environmental Ministry, Sergio De
Felice, in an unsolicited letter to the
court.
With this claim, he is also implicitly
claiming that the ministry itself was
wrong in releasing the authorization.
Among the arguments he makes, one is
amusing: Since the part of the sea that
lies before Livorno is part of the socalled Cetaceans’ Sanctuary of the Mediterranean Sea,11 an international treaty
between Italy, France, and the Principality of Monaco aimed at protecting the
cetaceans applies, France and Monaco
should take part in an environmental
impact assessment.12 The terminal is
supposed to be on stream in 2009, but
it is still unclear if the schedule will be
met.
Political problems are likely to interfere with other projects. At the same
time policy makers are aware of what
is at stake: not just a company’s right
to follow up the authorizations it has
received, but more broadly Italy’s ability to satisfy its own gas and electricity
needs. Many politicians believe it was a
mistake to give lower levels of government what in fact is veto power and
suggest a return to centralization.
66

Others think the national government should take the lead in those
infrastructures of strategic importance,
including regasification terminals. To
this end, a year ago was formed a “cabina di regia,” i.e., a high-level working
group on LNG terminals.
The group’s members are Pecoraro
Scanio, Economic Development Minister Pierluigi Bersani, Cabinet Undersecretary Enrico Letta, and later Infrastructure Minister Antonio Di Pietro. All
of them, except for the environmental
minister, support LNG terminals, including Brindisi.
The group has met a few times,
the last in December 2006, without
reaching any meaningful conclusion.
Rumor in early summer was that it will
not meet anymore. Significantly, both
in Rovigo and Brindisi and presumably
elsewhere the national leadership of
most parties has been openly in favor,
while local leaders were against.
There is, hence, a problem of making the regulatory process faster and
more effective. In part it can be solved
through appropriate reforms. The belief
that centralization of the process might
solve the problem, however, is probably
excessively optimistic.
“It’s not just about the legal side of
the whole thing,” said Massimo Romano, a former vice-president of Enel
who is now chief executive officer of

Sogin, a state-owned company created
to dismantle Italy’s nuclear sites.13
“Companies should invest more in
creating a consensus within the local
communities. Building a new plant is
not only about bureaucratic requirements: It is about convincing people
as well that they can get more benefits
than costs, and showing them that companies pay much attention to the safety
issues. We should communicate [to]
them that we are not working against or
despite them, but with and for them as
well as for our shareholders.”
Yet a legal problem does exists,
which depends on the lack of certainties regarding the outcomes of the
administrative processes as well as with
the practical ability of local and regional
governments to reverse their own decisions because of electoral changes.
Moreover, there is a broader problem
in the legal framework. For example,
last summer Pecoraro Scanio declared
that four LNG terminals are enough for
the country and named them, significantly omitting Brindisi. This is inconsistent with a liberalized market, where
what is “too much” is decided by the
market and whether a terminal should
be operating depends upon the ability
of the owners to meet administrative
criteria that are known in advance.
Then, if the imported gas is “too
much,” the price will fall and some
companies will post losses in their
budgets, but addressing this problem is
not the government’s business. By the
same token, the criticism that only a
minority of the proposed LNG terminals have already secured a long-term
contract for natural gas should not be a
government’s concern.✦

New meter measures distance, level, volume
Here’s the OPTIFLEX 1300 C TDR level
meter, an instrument that promises accurate measurement of distance, level and
volume of liquids and solids.

Its high signal dynamics translate to
measurements that are accurate and stable.
Despite disturbances such as strongly
agitated surfaces, the meter will clearly
locate the product’s true surface and will
continue to provide accurate measurements, the company points out.
Sharper pulses allow the meter to detect
and measure interfaces as thin as a 2-in.
film of oil on water in a large tank. The
sharper pulses also allow better repeatability of results, the firm says. OPTIFLEX
measures down to a dielectric of 1.4 (and
even 1.1 under certain conditions).
The instrument is available with five
probes—single rod, double rod, single
cable, double cable, and coaxial, helping
ensure that the device can handle virtually any application. The unit’s maximum
measuring range is from 13 ft to 115 ft,
depending on the probe type.
Installation and setup of the tool
requires the user to simply fit the gauge
to the tank, wire it, and turn it on, after
which the device will then run a self-di-

agnostic test to ensure proper operation.
A setup wizard takes the user through a
simple series of questions to define the
tank and the product to be measured. A
help screen is also available to assist in
setup and any subsequent operation. The
instrument also features a device type
manager—a device driver that makes functionality available independent from the
field bus protocol.

Literature discusses oil ﬁeld tubulars
New literature details DUOLINE 20
corrosion resistant oil field tubulars for
water injection and disposal of salt water
or other environmentally degrading corrosive fluids, including case studies of its
installations during the past 20 years.
The filament-wound glass-reinforced
epoxy liner is installed in oil field tubulars
that are used in corrosive services.

Ethanol’s fans
are dodging the
food-cost issue
Consumers worry more about rising
prices of corn ﬂakes and milk than about
the extent to which the cost of one ingredient affects all food.
Ethanol’s tireless propagandists, however, are focusing on corn’s contribution to
the Consumer Price Index for food to imply
that their favorite fuel deserves no blame.
The Renewable Fuel Association trumpets a report concluding that the price of

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e

corn, ethanol’s main ingredient, has much
less effect than the price of energy does on
all food prices in the CPI.
“Increasing petroleum prices have about
twice the impact on consumer food prices
as equivalent increases in corn prices,”
says report author and economist John M.
Urbanchuk, director of LEGC LLC.
RFA Pres. Bob Dinneen calls references
to ethanol’s link with food prices “baseless
scare tactics” and says, “While it is true
increased ethanol production is creating a real market-driven price for corn,
this [Urbanchuk’s] report clearly presents
the undeniable facts: Energy prices, not
ethanol, are responsible for much of the
increase in the price of food.”
This is a dodge. Of course energy costs
affect food prices. And it should surprise
no one that an energy-price rise affects
aggregate food prices more than does a
comparable increase in the price of a single
grain—the core message of Urbanchuk’s
report.
But those assertions are irrelevant to the
issue, which is that the ethanol mandate is
raising prices of corn and of foods associated with it beyond increases attributable to
energy. Urbanchuk addresses not ethanol’s
effect on the price of corn but rather
corn’s effect on all food in the CPI. He still
concludes that “the days of cheap corn are
more likely than not over.”
The ethanol mandate undeniably stokes
that outlook and its portents for the prices
of foods based on corn. It also helps push
up the energy prices onto which ethanol
fans are trying to shift blame.
Congress launched these assaults on
consumers on the basis of ﬂawed energy
and environmental claims in order to enrich
corn growers and distillers. In a political
climate where this can happen, “scare
tactics” are, in fact, appropriate.

Crude tops $70/bbl on NYMEX
The August contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes pushed past $70/bbl June
29 on the New York Mercantile Exchange to its highest level in 10 months due to declines
in US gasoline and distillate fuel supplies despite an increase in reﬁning capacity.
That same contract traded as high as $70.52/bbl June 28 on NYMEX before closing at $69.57/bbl, up 60¢ for the day. On June 29, it climbed as high as $71.68/bbl
in intraday trading before closing at $70.68/bbl. It was the ﬁrst time a front-month
crude contract closed above the psychological $70/bbl mark since August 2006.
“Crude oil has now been able to conﬁrm a break out of the $70/bbl barrier that
was keeping it in check since the beginning of the second quarter. If it is able to
conﬁrm the momentum, it would now set the next technical target at $75/bbl in a
repeat of the July 2006 dynamics,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. Trading was volatile June 28-29 due to “an oil triple
witching with the [simultaneous] end of the week, end of the quarter, and expiry of
the July product contracts,” Jakob said.
The crude price dipped slightly in early trading July 2 but remained near a 10month high after three consecutive weekly gains.
News from Iraq that a pipeline linking the southern oil ﬁelds to the Baghdad reﬁnery was damaged by a bomb explosion helped push up energy prices in New York.
“While the damaged pipeline shouldn’t signiﬁcantly hinder Iraqi supplies, it underscores the tense environment that contributes to the geopolitical risk premium in
crude prices,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
US inventory surprise
On June 27, the US Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration
reported gasoline inventories dropped 700,000 bbl to 202.6 million bbl in the week
ended June 22 in conﬂict with the consensus expectation of 1 million bbl increase.
It was the ﬁrst draw on US gasoline inventories in 8 weeks. Distillate stocks fell 2.3
million bbl to 120.4 million bbl against the consensus expectation of a 600,000 bbl
build. Crude inventories increased by 1.6 million bbl to 350.9 million bbl in the same
week, reaching levels not seen since May 1998.
Imports of crude into the US fell 290,000 b/d to 10.5 million b/d in the week ended
June 22. Yet the input of crude into US reﬁneries increased by 408,000 b/d to 15.4
million b/d, as reﬁning capacity utilization increased to 89.4% from 87.6% the prior
week. Nonetheless, US gasoline production was “relatively ﬂat” at 9.3 million b/d
while distillate fuel production was “unchanged” at 4 million b/d, EIA reported.
The price of the August crude contract “moved up 80¢/bbl in the 60 seconds that
followed the release of the DOE report and managed afterwards to hold and improve
on those gains,” stopping the momentum of previous price erosion, Jakob said. It
traded as high as $69.36/bbl before closing at $68.97/bbl, up by $1.20 June 27 to
recoup much of its loss from the previous session.
“With both the US reﬁnery utilization rate and gasoline inventory levels remaining well below the 5-year average, the draw in gasoline supplies has reignited concerns about adequate inventory levels,” said Raymond James analysts.
Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London, reported, “US oil product inventories are now at the greatest deﬁcit to their 5-year average since 2004.” Assessing the
gasoline market, he said, “Strong demand, falling imports, and ﬂat output is not a
great combination, and we continue to look for gasoline prices to push up towards
their second peak of the driving season. Gasoline demand for June-to-date is averaging 9.551 million b/d, which is just 34,000 b/d lower than the all-time record for
any month set last August.”
“Despite US retail gasoline prices having averaged more than $3/gal during the
past several weeks, demand remained 1.4% above comparable year-ago levels,” said
Eitan Bernstein of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc., Arlington, Va.
Meanwhile, improved reﬁnery utilization rates will help pull down the huge crude
stockpiles in Cushing, Okla. “As these stockpiles continue to fall, West Texas Intermediate prices may soon exceed prices of Brent crude as they have historically done,”
said Raymond James analysts. In recent weeks, North Sea Brent crude has sold at an
unusual premium to WTI.
Jakob, said, “No other energy commodity was able to follow the strong pace of
WTI [in June 28 trading]. Individual and reﬁning cracks continued to erode, and the
Brent premium to WTI corrected sharply lower” during that week.

COVER
The global economic slowdown will cause energy demand to
contract this year, with oil demand declining worldwide and in the
US, according to OGJ’s Forecast & Review.This special report looks
ahead to 2009 and back at 2008, detailing among other trends
demand, supply, prices, and production. Apache Corp. drilled its
Brunello-1 discovery in 2007 on Australia’s North West Shelf and
is exploring development options that include production for the
domestic market or for export through an LNG development. Photo

General

Interest

Oil, gas equipment sales likely to slow in 2009
Global oil and gas equipment sales are expected to be slow for
much of 2009 because of the economy and slumping oil prices in
late 2008, said Freedonia Group Inc., a Cleveland industry research
group.
The oil field equipment market is forecast to increase 2.9%/year
during 2008-12 to reach $85 billion in 2012. Freedonia said this
growth rate is a drastic deceleration from the 15.2%/year growth
during 2002-07.
In its world oil field equipment study, Freedonia said the most
rapid equipment demand growth through 2012 will come from
a few countries in the developing world, especially Brazil, China,
and Kazakhstan.
Nigeria and Angola also hold strong growth prospects if regional politics and the economy remain relatively stable, Freedonia
said.
Natural gas drilling is forecast to grow especially fast in China
and Qatar. In contrast, field maturity and declining production in
the US, Mexico, Venezuela, Norway, and UK will suppress equipment markets in those countries.
“In Mexico and Venezuela, growth could become stronger if
foreign, technologically advanced energy companies are allowed
greater rights to drilling and exploration activities, a domain that
is currently monopolized by inefficient state-controlled entities in
both countries,” Freedonia said.
Industry is expected to become more reliant on high-technology services such as directional drilling control and real time logging and measurement-while-drilling techniques.
“Despite the overall market exhibiting weak gains through
2012, prospects for certain products are more favorable, particularly for fixed-cutter drill bits and advanced well logging equipment,” Freedonia said.
Large tubular goods markets are expected to benefit from increased
drilling efficiency and gains in casing demand being bolstered by a
trend toward greater footage drilled per rig.

US, Georgia sign accord on defense, energy
The US and Georgia have agreed to step up physical security
of energy transit across the trans-Caucasus to European markets
as part of the US-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership signed
Jan. 9.
“We intend to build upon over a decade of cooperation among
our two countries and Azerbaijan and Turkey, which resulted in the
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and Baku-Supsa oil pipelines and the BakuTbilisi-Erzurum natural gas pipelines, to develop a new Southern
Corridor to help Georgia and the rest of Europe diversify their supplies of natural gas by securing imports from Azerbaijan and Central Asia,” the two nations said.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Before signing the document with her Georgian counterpart
Grigol Vashadze, US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice renewed US
support for Georgia’s territorial integrity in an allusion to the 2008
war between Georgia and Russia.
“The US…will always support Georgia’s sovereignty and its territorial integrity, as well as its Euro-Atlantic aspirations and its integration into the institutions of the Euro-Atlantic,” Rice said.
Russia invaded Georgia in August 2008 after the Tbilisi government tried to retake the breakaway region of South Ossetia by
force. The conflict saw considerable disruption in the transit of oil
and gas across the region, with Russian warplanes said to have targeted pipelines and railways.

China, Japan negotiate East China Sea pact
Japan and China will proceed with joint exploration for natural
gas in the disputed East China Sea, but further negotiation is scheduled on China’s continued unilateral activity in those waters.
In June 2008, the two sides agreed to explore jointly one area
of the East China Sea, while continuing talks over development of
two natural gas fields, Kashi and Kusunoki.
Earlier this month, Japan said it “cannot accept” China’s development of the Tianwaitian (or Kashi as it is known in Japanese) gas
field (OGJ Online, Jan. 5, 2009).

Egypt’s proved gas reserves reach 76 tcf
Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Co. (EGAS) has announced that
proved gas reserves in Egypt now total 76 tcf. This is up from the
2007 estimate of 72.3 tcf.
“Currently, the Mediterranean region contributes 81% of total
gas reserves and will dominate over the coming years as the majority of large gas discoveries are expected to be achieved in this
vital region,” said EGAS Vice-Chairman for production and development Eng. Atef Youssef.
“The Western Desert and Nile Delta contribute around 11% and
2% respectively of the remaining recoverable reserves, with the
Gulf of Suez making up just 6%. Most of the gas in the Gulf of Suez
is either associated with oil reserves or exist as gas cap in the oil
fields,” Youssef said.
EGAS said that Egypt has adopted a process for reserves estimation and documentation in which EGAS and Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. (EGPC) are closely involved from the early stages of
the exploration planning and approval process. Before drilling any
exploratory well by the production sharing contract partner, approval must be given by EGAS or EGPC. Following the declaration
of any discovery, the contractor must deliver a summary technical
report including well data, proved reserves, and testing results to
EGAS and EGPC.
EGAS and EGPC will review the report and then meet with the

The tenth discovery, H1-47/02, tested oil and gas from Ordovician Memouniat and Silurian Acacus. Verenex will release results
from an 11th discovery, Il-47/02, the first well drilled in the central
3D seismic survey area in northwestern Block 2, after National Oil
Corp. reviews them.
The company is preparing to test the K1-47/02 new field wildcat and is drilling the L1-47/02 new field wildcat.
The tenth find, H1-47/02, gauged 1,315 b/d of 42-64° gravity
oil and 16.2 MMcfd of gas on 32⁄64-in. to 48⁄64-in. chokes. Tested were
73 ft of Memouniat sandstone and two intervals totaling 82 ft of
Lower Acacus sandstone. TD is 10,475 ft.
Il-47/02, which went to TD 10,925 ft, extends the Lower Acacus and Memouniat play fairways into northwestern Block 2.
Formation evaluation of Jl-47/02, in southern Block 2, indicated hydrocarbons in Lower Acacus Basal Sand 1 and Upper
Shoreface intervals. It is to be tested in late January.
In Basal Sand 1, the results indicated a thick oil column of 66
ft with an underlying water-oil contact that is at a different subsea
depth than the contacts found in A1 field and the F1 well, suggesting that the J1 structure may be isolated. Testing may help confirm
this interpretation.
Basal Sand 1 contains the majority of the contingent resources
in A1 field and in other fields in southern Block 2.
The L1-47/02 new field wildcat that was spud Jan. 2 is 5 km
southeast of the A1-47/02 oil and gas discovery on a prospect
identified on 2008 2D seismic.

Buru Energy Ltd., Perth, has decided to defer its 2009 drilling
program in the onshore Canning basin in the Kimberley region of
northwest Western Australia to conserve cash while the company
reviews its entire exploration portfolio.
Buru will use the deferral to try and identify drilling targets
in areas closer to its existing oil fields, or in areas that enable
cost-effective development using existing oil production infrastructure.
This includes the possibility of acquiring 3D seismic coverage
over its Blina and Sundown oil fields about 100 km east of Broome
in the hope of delineating low-risk drilling targets.
The company will also review its plans for the more isolated
central and southern parts of the Canning basin that have high potential prospectivity, but greater exploration costs due to difficult
access as well as native title and other approval issues.
In addition, Buru plans to halve its production at Blina and
Sundown from a total of 200 b/d to 100 b/d to reduce field operating costs.
At present the company has cash reserves of $60 million (Aus.)
and is scrutinizing a number of opportunities that have been offered by third parties outside its Canning base.
Buru was formed last year from the demerger of Arc Energy’s
Canning assets from the merger of Arc and Australian Worldwide
Exploration.

E.On Ruhrgas assumes Huntington operatorship
Oilexco North Sea Ltd. has lost operatorship of the Huntington
license in the UK North after its partners voted unanimously to
transfer it to E.On Ruhrgas UK Exploration & Production Ltd.
Ernst & Young has become the administrator of Oilexco, which
failed to secure a loan from the banks amid the credit crunch for
its drilling and development program.
“The operatorship change will ensure progression on the development in line with the partnership’s plans,” said Norwegian
Energy Co. ASA, a partner in the field.
Huntington is potentially one of the largest discoveries in the
last 5 years; it was put on a fast track to come on stream early
in 2010. It is estimated to have up to 150 million bbl of oil in
place.
Oilexco will become a nonoperating partner in the license, according to Noreco. The operatorship change became effective Jan.

Corridor sees busy 2009 in New Brunswick
One priority in the $59.9 million 2009 budget of Corridor Resources Inc., Halifax, is to drill an exploration well 4 km southeast
of the 2008 South Branch G-36 (Caledonia) oil discovery.
This exploration well would evaluate the oil and gas potential
of the Upper Hiram Brook formation and the shale gas potential of
the Frederick Brook formation.
Corridor also plans to drill a step-out to the Caledonia discovery, where it shot 3D seismic last fall, and drill four McCully gas
field appraisal and development wells.
The company also hopes to frac and test the Green Road G-41
well to evaluate Frederick brook shale gas potential in the Elgin
subbasin. G-41 went to 2,422 m and cut 785 m of Frederick Brook
gassy shale, siltstone, and minor sandstone. That included a massive, predominantly siltstone interval at 1,753-1,906 m that is friable and had strong shows of gas while drilling. Another 10 m
of sheared, fractured black shale at 1,919-29 m was recovered as
conventional core.
Other goals are to seek a joint venture partner to accelerate
work at Elgin and other areas in the basin, and run a site survey at a
proposed drilling location on the 45,000-acre Old Harry structure
in 1,400 ft of water in the Gulf of St. Lawrence off Quebec (see
map, OGJ, Sept. 28, 1998, p. 107). ✦

Ithaca installs Jacky facilities in UK North Sea
Ithaca Energy (UK) Ltd. has installed the wellhead platform and
pipelines for its Jacky field in the Inner Moray Firth of the UK
North Sea.
Two months of bad weather in the North Sea had caused a delay,
so Ithaca hired, on short notice, the Hermod Heavy Lift Vessel to
progress the project and ensure that the schedule for the pipelay
and for finishing the well completion on time was not impacted.
The company said these activities and the delay likely will increase
development costs by 20-24% above the original estimate of £59.7
million because of shifts in the exchange rates of the UK pound,
US dollar, and euro.
Jacky initially will produce 7,500 b/d in mid-March once the
well completion and production well tie-in is finished.
The company will use the Ensco 92 jack up to enter the already-

BP to supply Vietnam’s Dung Quat reﬁnery
BP PLC has signed an agreement with state-run Petrovietnam
Oil Corp. and operator Binh Son Refinery Co. to supply oil to Vietnam’s 130,000-b/d Dung Quat refinery starting on Feb. 25.
Petrovietnam will negotiate with BP over the purchase of as
much as 70,000 b/d of crude, which will gradually replace output
from Vietnam’s Bach Ho (White Tiger) field.
Analyst BMI said delivery of the crude will “pave the way” for
BP to acquire at least part of the 49% stake open in Dung Quat.
BMI cited a statement by Petrovietnam Chairman Dinh La Thang
that international partners committed to supplying crude would be
given preference as stakeholders in the facility.
Petrovietnam had planned to run the Dung Quat refinery on domestically produced Bach Ho oil, but it decided instead to bolster
its foreign exchange earnings by using more imported Middle East
oil and reserving Bach Ho for export markets.
The Dung Quat refinery, which is scheduled to begin operations
on Feb. 25, is designed to process 3.5 million tonnes of oil during
2009, while its capacity is eventually set to increase to 6.5 million
tonnes/year.
When it is fully operational, the Dung Quat refinery will meet
30% of domestic demand, producing LPG, propylene, 90RON and
92RON gasoline, kerosine, Jet A1, diesel oil, and fuel oil.
Earlier this week, Petrovietnam announced plans to build a 2
million-tonne underground storage facility at Long Son in Ba RiaVung Tau Province that is designed to hold products from the Dung
Quat refinery.

drilled Jacky in mid-February or early March to complete the well
work, depending on previous well timing. Jacky will be an unmanned facility with the single well tied back to nearby Beatrice
field facilities.
The Beatrice facility will be modified to accommodate Jacky’s
production, a company spokesman told OGJ. Ithaca plans to add
another well at the end of the year if Jacky performs as expected,
he added.
As part of the Jacky development project, Ithaca also is reinstating production from the closed-in Beatrice Bravo platform. The
Bravo facility was producing about 800 b/d when Talisman Energy
UK Ltd. shut in the facility in July 2007 because of corrosion of the
pipeline between Bravo and the Alpha platform.
Jacky is owned by operator Ithaca, which has a 67.3% interest,
and its partners Dyas 22.7% and North Sea Energy 10%. ✦

In addition to Nexi, Ferederick said the consortium is comprised of a number of banks, including HSBC Holdings PLC, BNP
Paribas SA, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
Pertamina last year announced plans to build the unit.
“The prospects for the polypropylene market are good,” said
Pertamina chief Ari Soemarno in May. “That is why we plan to build
a polypropylene unit to meet domestic demand [for] plastic.
“We are seeking a partner,” Ari said, adding that the new unit
would turn Balongan’s propylene into polypropylene to increase
its value, while another company official said the plant would
cost about $200 million and would have a production capacity of
200,000 tonnes/year.
In January 2008, Pertamina signed a contract with Japan’s Toyo
Engineering and Indonesia’s Rekayasa Industri for an expansion
project aimed at upgrading the refinery’s residue catalyst cracking
unit to switch from ethylene output to propylene.
Meanwhile, this month, officials expected the Balongan refinery, which has been shut since last October, to resume operations
by Jan. 9. According to Pertamina Vice-Pres. Anang Rizkani Noor,
“Everything is smooth and on schedule.”
Pertamina shut the refinery on Oct. 18 to upgrade the RCC unit,
and 10 days later, there was an explosion at the refinery’s 58,000
b/d atmospheric hydrodemetalization unit. The refinery was restarted Dec. 17 but was shut again Dec. 21 due to what officials
called “technical problems.”

EU considers action against Gazprom, Nafttogaz
European Commission Pres. Jose Manuel Barroso advised European companies “to take the matter to the courts” if OAO Gazprom
and Naftogaz don’t resume soon the movement of Russian gas to
Europe via Ukraine.
Barroso also called for concerted action by European Union
states to find alternative energy supplies if the “unacceptable and
incredible” problem isn’t resolved soon.
Barroso reiterated that EU members should use the €5 billion
in the community budget to finance interconnections with other
energy supplys.
The EU gas coordination group met Jan. 9 to identify helpful
measures for countries suffering most from gas shortages, but concluded only inadequate short-term measures are available. Those
measures include increased production from European countries,
sharing larger withdrawals from storage, fuel switching, and limiting industrial consumption of gas. Even LNG would be of little
help as terminals with spare capacity are not connected to those
countries most in need of supply.
In an extraordinary session Jan. 12, energy ministers agreed on
the need to develop transparency of physical gas flows, enhance
storage capacity, increase strategic stocks, and make regional and
bilateral solidarity arrangements.
An assessment of network connections identifying gaps and diversified routes and sources is to be submitted at the Feb. 19 energy
council.

Transneft: ESPO’s ﬁrst stage on track for yearend
The first stage of Russia’s East Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline
(ESPO-1) will come on stream on Dec 25, 2009, according to
Nikolai Tokarev, the head of the state-owned pipeline operator
OAO Transneft.
“There are grounds to assume we will succeed,” Tokarev said,
adding that the revised budget for ESPO-1 had been approved at
390 billion rubles ($12.5 billion), with an extra 60 billion rubles
($1.94 billion) to be invested in the Kozmino terminal on Russia’s
Pacific Coast.
According to Tokarev, the estimated cost of building ESPO-1 rose
21% to 390 billion rubles from the original estimate of 322 billion
rubles following an adjustment for inflation at yearend 2008.
ESPO-1 will extend 2,757 km from Taishet in East Siberia to Skovorodino in the Amur Region near the border with China, while the
line’s second stage, ESPO-2, will extend a further 2,100 km from
Skovorodino to the port of Kozmino on Russia’s Pacific Coast.
Altogether, ESPO-1 is designed to transport as much as 220.5
million bbl/year of oil to Skovorodino, while the combined
ESPO-1 and ESPO-2 lines will transport as much as 367.5 million
bbl/year of oil. While awaiting construction of ESPO-2, oil will be

transported by rail from Skovorodino to Kozmino.
Tokarev said Transneft is ready to begin construction of ESPO-2
by yearend, but that the line’s feasibility study is currently under
scrutiny by Russia’s State Environmental Review Agency.
In December, Natural Resources Minister Yury Trutnev said his
ministry planned to conduct an analysis of the resources needed to
fill the ESPO line, underlining his concerns that the global economic crisis could affect development of the necessary oil resources in
Eastern Siberia.
“Just a couple of years ago, we gathered oil producers and received from them absolutely confident statements of production
volumes, summed them up and received an absolutely calm picture of resources supply,” Trutnev said.
“Today we are confident that this work needs to be done again.
We need to make sure that everything is okay. Otherwise we may
have concerns and therefore need to take appropriate measures,”
Trutnev said, adding, “We will do that in February.”
Meanwhile, in making his announcements, Tokarev said that
OAO Transneft will not be able to begin the construction of a proposed pipeline spur from Skovorodino to the Chinese border until
2010 at the earliest.
“We will complete the construction quickly and efficiently,
but it won’t be in 2009 since the issue of financing has yet to be
resolved,” Tokarev said, referring to a breakdown in negotiations
with China that took place late last year.
Transneft and OAO Rosneft, which were expecting Chinese
loans of $10 billion and $15 billion, respectively, for construction
of the spur and for oil deliveries, were unable to complete talks
with China National Petroleum Corp. by yearend 2008.
In early December, China said it expected to sign the agreements before yearend 2008, but the talks broke down due to a
disagreement over interest rates for the loans, with China insisting
on a floating rate, while Russia waning a fixed rate. Talks between
the two sides are scheduled to resume in February, about the time
the resources ministry plans to announce its revised analysis of the
resources needed to fill the ESPO line. ✦

Correction
The headline for a story about ExxonMobil Corp.’s world
demand outlook to 2030 should have read: World energy demand to reach 310 million boe/d in 2030 (OGJ, Jan. 12, 2009,
p. 30). Also, the start of the third paragraph of that story should
read as follows: Driven by growing populations and expanding
economies, global energy demand is expected to increase to
the equivalent of 310 million b/d in 2030 compared with the
equivalent of 229 million b/d in 2005.

Hydrogen and thermodynamics
I daresay that, even as readers of this
petroleum-oriented journal, most of us
would like to see hydrogen become an
economically viable transportation fuel
that could supplement traditional automotive fuels. However, Duncan Macleod
in his article “Oil industry ramps up for
hydrogen vehicles” offers us little encouragement (OGJ, Dec. 8, 2008, p. 26).
He writes glowingly of hydrogen as an
ideal, pollution-free fuel, which cannot
be denied, but he does not address the
issue of the cost of the energy required
to produce the hydrogen necessary to
fuel the vaunted hydrogen economy.
The laws of thermodynamics are the
problem. It simply takes more energy
to extract hydrogen from water using
electrolysis or to extract it from methane
using steam reformation than can be
obtained from the subsequent use of the
extracted hydrogen as a fuel. This imbalance of more energy in than out is the
barrier to a broadly based, economically
viable hydrogen economy.
Small facilities using solar or wind
power to produce locally used electrolytic hydrogen from water may have
some potential. This is predicated on the
assumption that solar or wind power
used to generate the hydrogen could not
otherwise be used. However, as soon as
significant production of solar or windbased power is developed at any single
location, it would be siphoned away and
put to more efficient use. This suggests
that hydrogen can never be more than
a boutique fuel with specialized niche
markets.
I certainly would like to be proven
wrong, but it’s hard to argue with the
laws of thermodynamics. If Mr. Macleod
can offer some insight on this apparent
dilemma, he should be invited to do so.
Otherwise, the pursuit of the hydrogen
economy brings to mind the age-old
search for the perpetual motion machine!

Almost 20% of younger Americans
said they would revert to their old
driving habits once pump prices fell,
compared with 12% for ages 35-54 and
only 6% of those 55 years and older.

Comparing data
OGJ’s weekly and monthly statistics will support the surveys’ findings.
In the graph below, note that when
prices reached a certain level, motor
gasoline demand started to decline.
Motor gasoline demand primarily fell
in mid-2008, once gasoline hit unprecedented prices of $3-4/gal.
Motor gasoline consumption typically follows a cyclical trend, rising and
falling at certain times of the year. The
graph indicates this cycle. Demand
goes up slightly in the months of the
summer driving season and begins to
decline in September.
Even though demand rose from the
beginning of last year to hit the highest
point in May 2008—the start of driving
season—at 9.216

Congress lurching leftward
Concern about a disintegrating economy hasn’t
daunted lawmakers who seem determined to
force up the costs of energy. As Oil & Gas Journal’s
Nick Snow reported from Washington last week,
industry trade associations have three main hopes
for moderation of Congress’s most extreme urges:
concern by congressional leaders for the economy,
growth in the number of centrist Democrats,
and migration toward the political center by an
incoming administration facing urgent national
problems (OGJ, Jan. 12, 2009, p. 20). Senate and
House leaders quickly are dispelling the first two
of those hopes. If the last one has any validity,
intraparty conflict between the White House and
Capitol is inevitable.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made his
course clear by pushing forward, in a rare Sunday session Jan. 11, a lands bill that will create 2
million acres of wilderness (OGJ, Jan. 12, 2009,
p. 18). To overcome a filibuster led by Sen. Tom
Coburn (R-Okla.), Senate leaders last year created
a package of 150 land, water, and other bills, many
of them local spending measures. A dozen more
bills joined the bundle, called the Omnibus Public
Lands Management Act, this year. Sixty-six senators
voted to take the bill to the Senate floor.

reason has emerged to see the new land bill as a
departure from that one-way tendency. The Senate
thus marches forward with an effort to curtail the
wealth generation of resource development just
when the US needs it most.
The House, meanwhile, has shifted leftward
again with energy committee assignments. The
first such lurch was the successful campaign last
November by Henry Waxman of California to
replace John Dingell of Michigan as chairman of
the Energy and Commerce Committee. Dingell
had been the committee’s ranking Democrat for
28 years. Waxman, whose coup is believed to have
had the tacit backing of House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi, thought Dingell’s support for the auto
industry made him insufficiently aggressive in climate change legislation crafted by his committee.
Dingell worked on the bill with Rep. Rick Boucher
of Virginia, chairman of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee. Boucher’s affiliation with the
coal industry made him suspect with Waxman’s
environmentalist supporters.

US energy demand this year will
shrink along with the economy, but
total use of all forms of energy will
decline by a smaller margin than during
2008.
Oil demand will contract for the second year in a row in 2009, but natural
gas demand will increase. Economic
weakness will be the biggest factor affecting demand for oil and gas in the
US.
Coal demand will see
a small decline
from a year
ago, nuclear
energy demand will be
unchanged, and the use of energy from
renewable sources will post a small
increase.
In 2008, strong worldwide oil
demand growth coupled with limited
spare oil production capacity to push
crude and product prices to record
levels.
Then, stung by high prices and
collapsing economic conditions, oil
demand shrunk and caused inventories
to swell in the second half of 2008,
lowering prices to the start of 2009.
The duration of price weakness
hinges on the speed of economic recovery.

Economic slump to suppress
US, worldwide oil use in 2009

Worldwide oil demand
Global oil demand will contract this
year by 400,000 b/d, as a 600,000 b/d
decline in the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development offsets a collective increase in oil demand among non-OECD
countries.
In 2008, worldwide demand for oil
declined to average 85.8 million b/d
from 86 million b/d a year earlier,
according to the International Energy
Agency. This change also was marked by
a large decline in the OECD and a 1.4
million b/d increase in the non-OECD
countries, led by rapid demand growth
in China, Latin America, and the Middle
East.
But this year non-OECD oil demand
growth will slow under the weight
of global economic contraction. Oil
demand in China will climb to average
8.1 million b/d from 7.9 million b/d
last year. In 2007, China’s oil demand
averaged 7.5 million b/d.
Demand in other non-OECD Asia,
the former Soviet Union, the Middle
East, and Africa will be unchanged from
2008 while demand in non-OECD Europe declines marginally. Latin American demand will inch up to 6 million
b/d this year.

Global oil production
Worldwide supplies of oil are also
set to contract this year, provided that

pledged output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
hold.
OPEC in December agreed to reduce
its crude output by 2.2 million b/d, in
addition to another 2 million b/d in
cuts agreed to at meetings the organization held in September and October
amid rapidly declining oil demand and
even faster-declining oil prices.
OECD oil supply for 2009 is forecast to decline about 500,000 b/d in
OECD European countries, hold steady
in North America, and increase to
700,000 b/d from 600,000 b/d in the
OECD Pacific countries.
Meanwhile, IEA expects that increases in oil production in Latin
America and the former Soviet Union
will propel non-OECD supplies to
average 28.2 million b/d this year, up
from 27.6 million b/d a year ago. The
Paris-based agency’s outlook also calls
for small increases in output in China,
other non-OECD Asia, and Africa, and a
small production decline in non-OPEC
Middle East output.
Adding processing gains and other
biofuels to these estimates for 2009
supply, total non-OPEC production will
average 50.1 million b/d, up from 49.6
million b/d last year.
OGJ estimates that OPEC output will
decline appreciably from last year’s
average 32.1 million b/d, as the organization limits supply to ease pressure
on full inventories and to bring crude
prices back toward $75/bbl.
In keeping with the most recent IEA
estimates, these OPEC figures include
production in Indonesia, although the
country exited the organization at the
end of 2008. The agency estimated that

and other production estimates prove
correct, inventories will climb about
400,000 b/d this year.

US economy, energy
The US economy will remain feeble
this year until consumer and investor
confidence returns. A strengthening
of the financial system and an effective government stimulus plan will be
necessary to underpin recovery. OGJ
forecasts that GDP will decline 1% this
year, erasing all 2008 economic growth.
A string of dismal economic results
followed the bursting of the housing
bubble last year. Home values plummeted in parts of the US, credit markets
froze, stocks slumped, unemployment
climbed, and consumer spending
shrank on fears that more bad news was
looming, creating a downward spiral.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that in December the unemployment rate reached 7.2%, the highest rate in 16 years. In November, the
rate was 6.8%, up from 6.6% a month
earlier.
BLS also reported that the Consumer
Price Index fell in November by 1.9%
from the previous month. BLS said falling energy prices, particularly gasoline,
drove the decline in the index. Excluding energy prices, the index was virtually unchanged.
Rising unemployment and deflation will weigh on the health of the US
economy all year, but some recovery
will begin to take hold before 2010.
OGJ forecasts that US energy demand
will slip 1.4% this year to 98.2 quadrillion btu (quads), building on last year’s
gains in energy efficiency.
High oil prices last year forced a
decline in demand, which resulted in
improved energy efficiency. In the US
in 2008, total energy demand fell 2%
in spite of a 1% increase in economic
output.

Energy sources
While overall US energy use this year
will decline, some sources of energy
will be in slightly higher demand
than they were a year ago. Demand for

boost from production in Shenzi, Tahiti,
and Thunder Horse fields in the Gulf of
Mexico, provided there are no major
disruptions brought on by tropical
storms.
Meanwhile, low product prices and
reduced petrochemical manufacturing will suppress production of NGLs. Poor extraction
economics will kill any incentive
to produce more NGLs this year.
OGJ estimates that crude
and condensate production in
Alaska continued its decline to
average 683,000 b/d last year,
compared with 722,000 b/d a
year earlier. The last year production in Alaska moved higher was
28

2002, when output jumped 2.6% and
averaged 988,000 b/d.
States recording production declines
last year also included Louisiana, California, Montana, and Texas.
Production in North Dakota in 2008

averaged 155,000 b/d, up from the
year-earlier average of 123,000 b/d
due to increased output from the Bakken shale formation. Production also
climbed last year in Colorado, Utah,
Alabama, Mississippi, and Oklahoma.

Inventories
Industry stocks of crude
and products will finish 2009
down from their unusually high
end-2008 levels.
Stocks of crude, excluding
those in the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, at the end of last year
totaled 325 million bbl, more
than 13% higher than a year
earlier. Throughout 2008, reOil & Gas Journal / Jan. 19, 2009

finery utilization rates were lower than
normal. Utilization hovered around
85% all year, except in September,
when Gulf Coast refineries experienced
hurricane-related outages.
Product stocks will end 2009 at 689
million bbl, down from 692 million
a year earlier. Total motor gasoline in30

ventories at the end of last year sagged
from the end of 2007, but the amount
of gasoline blending components in
storage grew 8% over the period.
At the end of 2008, inventories of
jet fuel, residual fuel oil, and unfinished
oils all stood below their year-earlier
levels. Over this period, though, indus-

try stocks of distillate fuel oil, propane
and propylene, and other oils grew.
The SPR will add about 18 million
bbl of crude this year. The Department
of Energy announced plans earlier this
month to purchase crude to take advantage of the recent decline in prices.

In 2008, utilization averaged 85%, as
spring maintenance caused the rate to
dip to 83% in March, then hurricane-related interruptions to Gulf Coast refineries sent the September rate to just 74.6%.
While refiners continued to ramp up
production of ultralow-sulfur diesel and
scale back output of distillate with more
than 500 ppm sulfur to meet fuel regulations, production of most other products
was little changed during 2008.

to interruptions caused by Hurricanes
Gustav and Ike, along with 120,000
additional “premium” barrels of oil that
the refiners are required to pay.
The SPR will also receive 2.178 million bbl of royalty-in-kind oil, originally scheduled for delivery in 2008 and
deferred until the spring of this year.

domestic and imported crude to US
refiners last year averaged about $95/

of US crude and product imports last
year were Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia,

Venezuela, and Nigeria.
US exports of crude and products
will average 1.85 million b/d this year,
up 4.2%. Last year, weaker demand
caused total oil exports to soar 24%

gasoline in the US peaked at an average

earlier the average was $2.959/gal.
By the end of last year, pump prices
had sunk to levels not seen since early
2004. For the week ended Dec. 29,
2008, the pump price of regular unleaded averaged $1.613/gal. With geopolitical tensions pressuring oil prices,
the pump price rebounded a bit to start
this year, though, averaging $1.784/gal
for the week ended Jan. 12.
While lower prices may encourage use,
the poor economy will remain a drag on
motor gasoline demand this year.

Fewer wells to be drilled in US, Canada in 2009
Alan Petzet
Chief Editor-Exploration
Drilling in the US is declining in
response to the 2008 oil and gas price
collapse and financial crisis in the US,
and further drops are expected in the
US and Canada in 2009.
Rig counts in the rest of the world,
however, have held up fairly well.
Capital spending cuts in connection
with the US financial crisis begin
in earnest in the third quarter
of 2008. Most companies have
alerted the investment community that they plan to monitor
oil and gas prices closely during
2009 and adjust budgets accordingly. Many pledged to operate
within cash flow this year.
It was impossible at this writing in early January to predict
how low the US rig count might
go before bottoming out.
Here are highlights of OGJ’s
early year drilling forecast for 2009:
• Operators will drill 43,384 wells
in the US, down from an estimated
52,097 wells in 2008.
• All operators will drill 4,291 exploratory wells of all types, down from
an estimated 5,474 last year.

The US total peaked at 2,031 rigs in
the weeks ended Aug. 29 and Sept. 12,
and the count had fallen to 1,589 by
Jan. 9, latest available at this writing. By
that time, drilling in the two East Texas
districts had held up better than most
other areas of the country.
Texas drilling peaked at 958 rigs the

exploratory wells. OGJ looks for
180 wells to be drilled there in
2009.
Forecast and Review
Before prices turned south,
regulators struggled to keep
up with the activity. Colorado,
for example, expected to have
issued 7,600 drilling permits in
2008 compared with more than
6,300 in 2007. OGJ estimates
that only 3,825 wells were
drilled in the state in 2008 and
January 2008 forecast and 1,840 in
looks for a drop of about 18% in 2009.

OGJ looks for a 7.8% drop in Canadian drilling in 2009, far less of a falloff
than in the US.
The Canadian Association of Oilwell
Drilling Contractors estimated that
Canada’s rig count will average 348 this
year, a drop of 6% from 2008.
Horizontal drilling in shale gas
plays in Northeast British Columbia
and in the Bakken shale oil play in the
Saskatchewan portion of the Williston
basin are expected to markedly extend
the average footage of Canadian wells,
the group said.

International drilling
The “international” rig count,
incorporating North America for the
first time, didn’t vary much throughout
2008, Baker Hughes reported.
However, the number of rigs working internationally outside the US and
Canada averaged 3,346 in January-November 2008 compared with 3,107 in
the same period of 2007.
Busy spots outside the US and
Canada on the November 2008 count
were Mexico with 78 land rigs and 29
marine units active, Saudi Arabia with
64 land rigs and 12 offshore units, and
India with 55 land rigs and 27 offshore
units.
Indonesia was running 46 land rigs
and 15 offshore units, and Oman had
54 land rigs operating.
In Latin America, Argentina had 77
land rigs and one offshore unit running, Venezuela 68 land rigs and 12
water units, Brazil had 29 land rigs and
30 offshore rigs, and Colombia had 42
land rigs.
In Africa, Egypt led with 45 land rigs
and 10 offshore rigs, while Algeria had
25 land rigs at work. Operators mobilized 14 land rigs and one offshore unit
in Libya.
Twenty-three offshore rigs and 2
land units were working in the UK. ✦

GAO report sees
duplications

T

he US Department of Energy
should formally assess whether
its oil and gas research and development projects would not have
occurred without federal funding,
the Government Accountability Office
has recommended in a new report.
The Jan. 9 report examined a
program that has shrunk dramatically over several years despite having
developed technologies that significantly improved domestic exploration and production.
It noted that the US oil and gas
industry spent at least $20 billion on
R&D from 1997 through 2006, with
a current focus mostly on near-term
(within about 2 years) production
challenges. It also said DOE spent
roughly $1 billion on oil and gas
R&D during the same period on both
near and long-term projects.
Funding grew in fiscal 2007 and
2008 because Section 999 of the 2005
Energy Policy Act (EPACT) makes
about $50 million/year available
over 10 years and assigns 75% of that
amount to a consortium of universities, industry groups, and independent
research organizations, GAO said.
Under EPACT, DOE is charged with
maximizing the value of US oil and
gas resources by increasing supplies,
reducing E&P costs, and minimizing
environmental impacts, GAO said.

and uses a project selection process
to ensure that its programs support
the industry. But DOE does not assess
whether the industry would conduct
this R&D without federal support,
GAO said.
“Such an assessment is not made
because DOE’s screening criteria do
not specifically require this type of
evaluation. Despite the lack of an
assessment, DOE officials continue to
believe that DOE’s oil and gas R&D
activities only minimally duplicate
industry’s R&D activities because
of their extensive interaction with
industry,” the report said.

Methane hydrates exception

The report said that for several
years the White House Office of Management and Budget has expressed
concern that DOE’s oil and gas R&D
backs projects comparable to industry
efforts. “However, OMB specifically
acknowledged that [DOE’s] methane
hydrates [research] program is an
exception that can provide a unique
contribution,” the report continued.
GAO also said it found instances
where DOE funds near-term oil and
gas R&D that companies would be
unlikely to underwrite. For example,
it said DOE worked with the US
Bureau of Land Management on
several projects to monitor impacts

need to encourage energy research and
development, he said. The oil and gas
industry already is making substantial
investments and the government can
encourage further R&D by granting
incentives, he suggested.
Mulva also recommended that government funding concentrate on technologies with long lead times or highly
advanced science on which the oil
and gas industry can’t focus. “We also
would benefit too from greater support
of the educational system, particularly
in the scientific and engineering disciplines. Otherwise, we anticipate a severe
shortage of industry technical personnel
in the future,” he said.
These priorities must be achieved
with full environmental and economic
awareness, which includes addressing
global climate change, Mulva said. “We
believe that the public will not allow
new energy development unless the
resulting carbon impact is addressed.
Conversely, the public will not favor
reductions in carbon emissions if, as a
result, energy prices are forced upward
too much or too fast. Both issues must
be addressed together,” he said.

A transparent process
Whether with a carbon tax or a
cap-and-trade system, addressing global
climate change will be costly, making a transparent policy development
process essential, Mulva said. “We think
the science is quite clear. We also think
it’s going to take a lot of commitment
and a lot of adjustment. That’s why it’s
important to keep talking about these
issues. The train is leaving the station.
People are forming their opinions,” he
said.
Mulva said ConocoPhillips belongs
to the US Climate Action Partnership,
which plans to release its comprehensive climate policy recommendations
on Jan. 15. “They should convey a high
degree of credibility and merit because
of the broad and diverse membership
of USCAP. It includes manufacturers of
products from cars to medical devices

are companies engaged in mining,
financial services and consulting. There
are prominent environmental organizations,” he said.
“In short, there is broad representation of business and industry, and of
the environmental community. So the
consensus recommendations are neither
a one-sided, proindustry approach nor
simply a proenvironment approach.

They are balanced. They can and should
serve as a guide to Congress as it crafts
climate policy,” Mulva said.
He noted that oil and gas executives
consider prices in preparing budgets
because of their potential cash flow
impacts. But other factors also have
an influence, including difficulty in
obtaining permits for production and
infrastructure improvements that has

affected ConocoPhillips operations in
the US, he said.
“Oil prices went up too quickly last
summer. We also recognize that the
economic recession since then has had
an impact and brought prices down.
We think today’s prices will produce a
response. We also think they need to be
somewhat better to produce the necessary investments,” Mulva said. ✦

Appeals court backs earlier Kerr-McGee deepwater ruling
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
A federal appeals court affirmed on
Jan. 12 a US district court’s ruling that
Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Corp. should not
have to pay royalties on eight Gulf of
Mexico deepwater leases from 1996 to
2000 despite price thresholds imposed
by the US Department of the Interior.
Kerr-McGee, now part of Anadarko
Petroleum Corp., argued that it should
not have to pay royalties even though
natural gas produced from the leases
exceeded the leases’ inflation-adjusted
price threshold in 2003 because volume thresholds had not been reached.
Congress established the thresholds
as part of the 1995 Outer Continental
Shelf Deepwater Royalty Relief Act that
was designed to promote OCS exploration and production in deep water.
DOI disagrees with the US Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals ruling and
is exploring every option, including
appealing and continuing to work
with Congress to resolve the matter, a
spokesman told OGJ on Jan. 13.
“As we have said before, if the
court’s interpretation of Congress’s action in 1995 is correct, certain leaseholders will be able to produce massive
amounts of oil and gas without paying
royalties to the United States without
regard to the price, perhaps amounting
to one of the biggest giveaways of federal resources by Congress in modern
history,” he said.

An Anadarko spokesman said on Jan.
13 that the appeals court’s affirmation
upheld clear congressional intent to
assure that producers were afforded the
royalty treatment granted as encouragement to make huge investments in the
deepwater gulf.

Panama popping
with possibility

P

anama has been out of the news
for a while, but the oil and gas
industry has plans for the place, and
those plans are moving ahead smartly.
Panama’s trade and industry
ministry recently said that studies are
almost finished for the construction
of a 350,000 b/d refinery at Puerto
Armuelles, about 550 km west of
Panama City.
In 2007, the Panamanian government agreed to cooperate with Qatar
Petroleum and Occidental Petroleum
Corp. in the project, then valued at
$7 billion, and the two companies
commissioned Foster Wheeler Ltd. to
conduct the studies.
Since then, Tesoro Corp. has entered the country with a throughput
agreement that will allow the company to transport crude oil through a
pipeline owned by Petroterminal de
Panama (PTP).
Last May, PTP unveiled a plan to
reverse the flow of its 130-km transPanamanian pipeline, built in 1982
to allow Alaska North Slope (ANS)
crude to be shipped to US Gulf Coast
refineries.

Mothballed line
The 800,000 b/d line was mothballed in 1996 as falling Alaskan oil
production made ANS crude noncompetitive on the Gulf Coast. Eventually, PTP got the idea of reversing
the line to allow oil from the Atlantic
to be pumped to the Pacific.
The idea may have come from
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,
who once expressed interest in using the PTP pipeline to help ship his
country’s crude to China as a way of
diversifying exports away from the
US.

INGAA: Wider economic
pressures could hamper
gas pipeline ﬁnancing
Nick Snow
Washington Editor

Chavez is out of the picture now,
and PTP expects the reversal project
to be ready for start-up during the
third quarter of 2009.
The proposed reversal could shave
30 days off the transport of a crude
cargo from West Africa to a US West
Coast refinery—an idea that struck
home with Tesoro.

Tesoro’s agreement
After the completion of the
project, Tesoro has agreed to ship
107,000 b/d of crude through the
pipeline under a 7-year agreement.
The throughput agreement will
allow Tesoro to economically deliver
crude produced in Africa, the Atlantic
region of South America, and the
North Sea to the company’s five Pacific Rim waterborne refineries.
Tesoro leases existing tankage
from PTP but, in an added development, PTP is building dedicated
tanks for Tesoro on both sides of the
Isthmus of Panama, scheduled to be
online in early 2010.
In September, PTP awarded CB&I,
The Woodlands, Tex., a contract worth
more than $40 million to design, fabricate, and construct petroleum storage
tanks associated with the Trans-Panama
Pipeline Expansion Project.
The tanks will be built at Chiriqui
Grande on the Atlantic Coast and
Puerto Armuelles on the Pacific Coast.
Tesoro plans to use the pipeline and
tanks to blend and distribute different grades of crude for its own use.
Not surprisingly, Tesoro Chairman, Pres., and Chief Executive Bruce
Smith said, “This project is consistent
with our strategic goal to increase
optionality around crude oil selection.” ✦

While US natural gas pipelines
remain financially strong, broader
economic conditions could challenge
their ability to raise money to expand
and maintain their systems, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America
warned on Jan. 14.
“The industry’s ability to continue
to invest in safe, reliable energy infrastructure is challenged by an inability
to access capital on reasonable terms,”
INGAA Pres. Donald F. Santa said in a
Jan. 14 letter to President-elect Barack
H. Obama.
“Consequently, like other capital-intensive segments of the economy whose
growth depends on access to external
financing, the interstate natural gas
pipeline industry would benefit from
[a] tax policy that promoted investment
in infrastructure, plant, and equipment,” Santa said.
Accelerated depreciation, investment
tax credits, and a reduced dividend tax
rate could be part of such a policy, he
said.
Santa noted that as transportation
service providers, INGAA members
“take great interest in the discussions
concerning energy infrastructure in the
upcoming economic stimulus legislation and future energy legislation.”

Low-emission backup
Natural gas is in a position to play
a significant role as the US makes the
transition to a lower-carbon economy
and complements renewable technologies such as wind and solar power by
providing low-emission back-up generation, according to Santa.

increased dramatically in response to

ment, he added. “The interstate pipeline industry has invested $51 billion
already in this decade to maintain and
expand the US natural gas transmission
network,” Santa said, adding that 2008
likely will represent the largest singleyear increase in gas pipeline capacity
since the 1960s.
Santa said the US Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission’s regulatory regime for authorizing new pipeline construction and the pipeline rate certainty

provided by the Natural Gas Act have
been instrumental in this infrastructure
development.
“While we do not believe that the
natural gas pipeline industry needs federal funds to continue our infrastructure expansion and upgrades, we do
believe that maintaining this regulatory
certainty will be essential to raising additional private capital,” he said.
The INGAA official specifically questioned proposals to change the Natural

Gas Act by decentralizing the process
for authorizing new pipeline construction and alter the ratemaking regime,
which he said would place future and
existing pipeline investments at greater
risk.
“We urge policymakers to avoid
changes to the pipeline regulatory
program that would increase the cost of
capital for, and drive investment away
from, new natural gas pipeline infrastructure,” Santa said. ✦

Petrobras keeping 5-year plan under wraps
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
The long-awaited 5-year strategic
plan spanning 2009-13 for Brazil’s
Petroleo Brasilerio SA (Petrobras)—
already delayed several times—will be
assessed by the company’s board at the
end of January, according to Paulo Roberto Costa, downstream director.
“We usually present our strategic
plan to the board in September, but due
to market volatility, the board requested
a more detailed plan, which will be
presented at the end of January,” said
Costa, referring to a meeting of the
company’s board scheduled for Jan. 23.
Meanwhile, Petrobras financial
and investor relations director Almir
Barbassa, refuting analysts’ forecasts
that Petrobras would issue debt in the
next few days, said the firm will launch
a bond issue only after it defines and
announces the company’s strategic plan
for 2009-13.
Petrobras initially said it would announce the investment plan at the start
of September. It then delayed the date to
the beginning of October and then to
the second half of October.
The firm then said its announcement
would be made before yearend 2008,
but even that date slid as company executives pondered the growing impact
of the worldwide financial crisis on
company projections.
In December, company president
42

Sergio Gabrielli finally said that the announcement of the 5-year strategic plan
would have to be pushed back yet again
as the 2009 corporate budget was still
being worked out.
At the time, Gabrielli said that investment in 2009 should total around
55 billion reais ($23 billion), a figure
larger than that spent in 2008, but well
below the 72 billion reais ($30 billion)
Petrobras first presented to lawmakers
in August.
“In the last 6 months, we saw a gigantic variation in oil prices,” Gabrielli
said in December. “We discussed the
problems with making projections for
[oil] prices and costs, so it was decided
to wait [on the strategic plan] until

there was greater clarity,” he said.
At the time, Gabrielli said the enormous drop in international oil prices—
from $150/bbl in August to just over
$40/bbl in December—surprised
company executives. “We knew that
the price of oil was going to fall, but
we didn’t imagine it would be by so
much,” he said.
Despite the decline in international
oil prices, Gabrielli said development
of the company’s promising subsalt oil
reserves was still viable at current levels.
“Given the actual international oil
prices, the subsalt is viable,” Gabrielli
said, explaining that the board’s decision was based on oil prices between
$40-50/bbl. ✦

Costs rise despite economic slowdown, analysts say
Despite the global recession, construction costs for upstream oil and gas
facilities have reached a record high, as
have those for the design and construction of refining and petrochemical
projects, say IHS Inc. and Cambridge
Energy Research Associates (CERA) in
their most recent upstream capital costs
index (UCCI) and downstream capital
costs index (DCCI).

previous high of 210. The values are
indexed to the year 2000, meaning that
a piece of equipment that cost $100 in
2000 would cost $230 today.
Driven by high demand and escalating fuel prices, cost increases reached
even higher points during July and
August, but have moderated as of the
end of the third quarter.
“Hidden in these substantial increases are the first signs of what may
be a change in direction,” said Daniel
Yergin, CERA chairman and IHS executive vice-president. “Moderation in the
last 2 months of the third quarter was
a response to the unfolding financial
crisis and the spending cutbacks and

The increase was driven by a continued high level of upstream oil and
gas activities and a marked increase in
the cost of steel and subsea equipment.
Upstream steel costs have grown by an
unprecedented 32% from the first quarter to the third quarter because of raw
material and scrap metal costs. Although

At the same time, demand for energyrelated projects remained at high levels,

“While some markets had significant

Forrest said. “Credit issues will almost

regions.”
Forest said, “It is important to note,
however, that governments around
the world are working hard to restore
liquidity, and it still remains to be
seen how far these measures will go
in bridging the gap and providing the
funding needed for the long list of
general construction projects currently
planned globally.”
Construction levels for planned
downstream projects are almost three
times busier than the recent past, and
although CERA does not expect all of
these facilities to be built, the level of
construction activity for downstream
projects is projected to remain relatively
strong until at least 2010 as existing,
committed projects are under construction.

Iraq’s proved reserves of 115 billion

(Fig. 1). Of these, seven oil fields have
been fully developed and another 15
partly developed.
The remaining 58 fields rank between appraised or discovered but not
yet delineated or appraised.
It should be noted, however, that
there is a concentration of reserves in
few fields. The seven largest
fields, for example, Rumaila
South and North, Kirkuk,
East Baghdad, Majnoon,
West Qurna, and Zubair,
contain two-thirds of total
reserves.
Iraq may prove to have
the greatest endowed oil reserve base in
the world, whose true extent has not as
yet been fully explored or developed.
Its proved reserves are 145.5 billion bbl
of oil and its potential reserves are in
excess of 215 billion bbl.
Its historically sustained optimum
oil production level was 3.5 million
b/d, while its production today is 2.5
million b/d. As such, Iraq’s production
capacity has always lagged its potential.

It is no surprise, therefore, that the

more difficult and deeper horizons and
smaller oil fields, the finding cost would
be higher, but it would still be a fraction of a dollar for a long time.

Development cost

According to the author’s experience and based on the findings of the
Petrolog & Associates 1997 study, average Iraq development cost at the field’s
boundary was of the order of $1,000/

Middle East major producers and the
contribution of each to the global energy market at the year beginning 2007.
Iraq’s oil resource is on par with
Saudi Arabia, but its resource base is the

It is, therefore, worthwhile to diagnose the impediments that have limited
Iraq oil production to date to 2.5 million b/d while Saudi Arabia has managed, decades away, around 10 million
b/d under a system of state monopoly.
Iraq, as the table shows, has thus
far produced only 8% of its oil source

Iraq’s cumulative oil production
is 30.5 billion bbl, only 8% of its oil
resource base of 330-380 billion bbl
(based on enhanced recovery).
Iraq’s proved reserves are 115 billion bbl, and its potential exceeds 215
billion bbl. These figures put it on par
with Saudi Arabia. It would take Iraq

The policy of granting wholesale
exploration contracts of the latest
amended draft petroleum law, based
on controversial long-term contracts, is
unnecessary and divisive. Announced
at this time, when the country is in
desperate need for peace within its factions, is most unwise.
Iraq’s recovery factor has averaged
25-31%, while technology elsewhere
has achieved 50-60% and 70% is the
target. The Iraq of today lacks state-ofthe-art technology and management
know-how, due to years of war, sanctions, and lately, occupation, terror, and
failing infrastructure and institutions.
Clearly, Iraq requires international
oil company support. The question is,
on what contract model basis, whether
production-sharing agreement or ser-

Iraq’s present proved
reserves could support a production rate
in excess of 12 million
b/d.
vice contracts for know-how, with or
without investment?
Iraq is a founding member of OPEC
and rightly adopts a policy of crude oil
price stabilization and conservation.
An open exploration and production
policy under contracts employing IOCs’
technical support as well as their capital
investment would create the problem
of having to cap exports while investing. IOCs require unrestricted production. Service or management contracts
employing IOCs latest technology and
management with remuneration choice
in cash or kind suggests itself as an appropriate model.
Iraq’s present proved reserves could
support a production rate in excess of
12 million b/d as potential reserves are
discovered and developed to sustain the
plateau. Today, however, Iraq’s production facilities are dilapidated, looted,
sabotaged, or war-torn, to the extent

that in September 2003, its production
rate sank to around 1 million b/d from
a prewar rate in March 2003 of 2.8 million b/d.
Rehabilitation of infrastructure and
monetizing reserves should, therefore,
be the priority.
Iraq’s enormous proved reserves and
potential make it the only major Middle
East member with relatively untapped
and inexpensive oil resources. At the
same time, it raises an alarm amongst
Iraqis, fearing continuing occupation

and interference in the country’s political and economic future.
Iraqis have lived and seen all the major Middle East member producers for 4
decades of state control of oil exploration and development with pivotal if
not total role given to their national oil
companies.
No doubt privatization rubs against
the skin of Iraqis.

Chile’s Austral basin.
GeoPark said it ended 2008 with
production of 6,250 boed. Earlier this
year the company said more than 90%
of its output, 77% of which is gas,
comes from the Fell Block.
The company drilled 14 wells, shot

placed nine wells on production, in-

cluding four new field discoveries. Most
recent to go on production are Aonikenk oil field and Manekenk gas field.
The Manekenk discovery well tested

Pittsburgh-based CNX
Gas Corp., an exploration
and production company
that has drilled hundreds
of coalbed-methane
wells in the Appalachian
Drilling
basin, drilled its first
horizontal Marcellus
shale wells in Pennsylvania in 2008. The
CNX No. 3 well was spud June 3 and
began producing 6.5 MMcfd of natural
gas in December.1
The CNX No. 3 was drilled horizontally through the Marcellus formation
on company-owned mineral land in the
Rogersville Quadrangle, Greene County,
Pa. (Fig. 1).
The well was drilled to a vertical
depth of 8,140 ft in the Huntersville
Chert, penetrating 83 vertical ft of
Marcellus shale. The well was logged,
plugged back, and then CNX cut a
horizontal section of 3,395 ft for a total
measured depth of 10,738 ft. The well
was completed with a five-stage slickwater fracture treatment using 3 million
lb of proppant.

Tale of two rigs
CNX used two rigs to drill three
horizontal Marcellus shale wells (3, 2,
and 2a):
• Crown Drilling’s Rig 7 to drill the
tophole.
• Les Wilson Inc.’s Rig 25, to drill
the horizontal section to TD.

Top holes
CNX wrote a day-rate contract to use
Crown Drilling Rig No. 7, a Speedstar
185 with top drive and hook load
capacity of 185,000 lb. The rig’s maximum depth capability is about 8,500 ft
in an air-drilled hole.
CNX used it to drill a vertical Marcel-

O D U C T I O N

lus well, CNX No. 4, and top holes of
three horizontal wells: CNX No. 3, No.
2, and No. 2A.
Crown Drilling Rig 7 moved on
location and set 33 ft of 20-in. diameter conductor pipe in June. The Crown
Drilling crew drilled a 171⁄2-in. diameter
hole with air to a depth sufficient to
set 556 ft of 133⁄8-in.-diameter surface
casing. They next drilled a 121⁄4-in. hole
with foam mist to 2,680 ft.
CNX then logged the hole
in support of the company’s
coalbed-methane development
drilling program. After logging,
Crown set and cemented 2,630
ft of 95⁄8-in. intermediate casing
(36 lb/ft, J-55 grade).
On June 16, 2008, Crown Rig No.
7 moved off the CNX No. 3 well and
went on to drill top holes the CNX No.
2 and CNX No. 2A. Both wells were
drilled from a single surface location,
about a half-mile northeast of the CNX
No. 3.
After the three horizontal wells, the
rig returned to its previous task of drilling horizontal coalbed-methane wells
for CNX. It also drilled three vertical
Marcellus wells for CNX:
• GHCV No. 12—targeted to the
Marcellus but came in “natural” in U
Devonian sands.
• GHCV No. 8.
• GHCV No. 2.

of 16 billion bbl at a minimum grade of
25 gal/ton.
With processing technology advances, for example the addition of hydrogen to the retorting process, potential
oil yields could approach those of
western shale.
Eastern shale has some advantages
over the western shale. Five of these are:
1. Eastern shale is closer to major
demand centers and this would reduce
transportation costs.
2. Companies could move the liquid
produced by barge to a refinery for processing. This would eliminate the need
for local upgrading and for constructing
large new pipelines.
3. Because the resource is diverse,
eastern shale development should have
fewer associated environmental problems.
4. Because the eastern area is more
populated, the area should have fewer
infrastructure and socio-economic
problems than in the west.
5. The eastern states also have

on Alaska’s North Slope.3 More than
700 billion bbl of US oil shale resource
occurs in concentrations richer than
currently produced Alberta tar sand.
As industry demonstrates the commercial viability of oil shale, a subset,
almost certainly in a range near 100 billion bbl, would become a prospect for
reclassification to proved reserves.
A reasonable assumption is that
first commercial oil production from
oil shale will yield at least 30 gal/ton.
Zones richer than about 40 gal/ton
are generally too thin to be selectively
recovered at a practical scale.
Beds with average 30 gal/ton commercial thickness are found throughout
the Colorado and Utah resources. In
previous activity, Unocal Corp. reported
yields averaging 38 gal/ton, at least in
the early stages, and is believed to have
averaged about 34 gal/ton during the
life of its project.3

Resource access
The US government owns and
manages about 73% of the lands that
contain much of the oil shale deposits
in the west. These lands contain about
80% of the known recoverable resource
in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming.

lower domestic consumption, according to the report.
Iran also plans to build new refineries, which the report says are doubtful. There are current projects that will

Iran’s gasoline imports

According to the report, Iran’s
gasoline imports averaged 180,000 b/d

Although Iran had planned to introduce
gasoline rationing through smart cards,
it feared political backlash and expected
consumer resistance.
The threat of US sanctions gave
Iranians the justification they needed to
impose rationing with limited public
resistance in summer 2007. Imports fell

Tanker market earnings for the half-year
ended September 2008
firmed 43.7%, accelerating the strength seen in
the previous 6 months.
Tankers

demand. Clarkson Research
Services Ltd. detailed the reasons behind these market
movements as well as offered forecasts
of future market direction in its Autumn
2008 “Shipping Review and Outlook:
A Half-Yearly Review of the Shipping
Market.”
According to Clarkson data, the
tanker market, consisting of both modern and early-1990s VLCCs, modern
Suezmax, modern Aframax, and both
dirty and clean products carriers, averaged $49,272/day in earnings from
March 2008 to September 2008, a
43.7% increase from the $34,280/
day seen September 2007-March 2008.
Greater than 65% increases in Suezmax
and Aframax earnings, to $86,661/day
and $58,535/day respectively, led the
upward momentum, with earnings for
all segments moving up from the previous 6 months (Table 1).
Another example of market strength,
according to Clarkson, were the
January-July 2008 increases seen in
VLCC rates, which peaked at more than
$169,000/day, compared with the

more than $53,000/day spot rate seen
in January.
Even with the overall strength of the
market, however, Clarkson cited the
deepening problems in the global economy and financial sector as reinforcing
the idea that the recent bull market was
ending.
The conversion of single-hull tankers combined with 3.6 million dwt of
scrapping reduced tanker-fleet growth
to only 1.5% for the first 9 months of
2008, well below the 4.4% increase
forecast for the year (OGJ, June 23,
2008, p. 66). Clarkson has revised
its 2008 growth forecast to 4%—to
401.4 million dwt—but notes that this
remains stronger than expected and that
59 million dwt of tankers are scheduled
to be delivered in 2009.
This article will detail some of the
other findings in a few of the numerous vessel categories covered twice each
year by Clarkson in its Shipping Market
Outlooks.

Market outlook

Surging oil prices encouraged
importers to lift their oil earlier than
usual, fueling strength in the tanker
market despite steady demand erosion,
according to Clarkson. Clarkson said
that spot earnings improved across most
major sectors, though not as rapidly as
in the previous 6 months. The average
clean products spot rate increased 64%.
Suezmax spot rates slipped 1% from the
previous 6 months, but remained 27%
above their 10-year average.
Crude tankers of all other categories
gained ground against 10-year average
spot rates over the past 6 months. The
spot rate for 30,000 dwt clean product
tankers also increased to $36,023/day
from $20,689/day in
the preceding 6 months.

Spot earnings for modern vessels
peaked July 25 at $153,088/day, the
highest rate ever recorded. By Sept.
1, however, earnings had slipped to
$57,247/day. Even with the spot softening, time-charter rates for 1-year on
a modern vessel firmed 12.9% from the
end of 2007 to $35,000/day. Rates for
modern vessels only showed a similar
pattern to the overall Suezmax class,
with average spot earnings and 1-year
time charter rates converging (Fig. 2).
Clarkson expects spot rates in the
Suezmax sector to remain steady in the
short term, while noting that ongoing
unrest in Nigeria could soften demand.
In the medium term, however, rates
66

$56,560/day and slipped over the next
8 months to $41,730/day, averaging
$52,096/day for the period. Unlike the
other crude-carrier classes, time charter
rates also slipped 2.3% over the first 8
months of 2008, reaching $22,500/day
for a 1-year term.
Clarkson sees the relatively smaller
order book in the Aframax sector possessing less potential for medium-term
oversupply than is expected for VLCC
and Suezmax vessels. Clarkson also
described declining North Sea production over the next 5 years as bullish for
Aframax’s as European import demand
looked to longer-haul supply sources.

may come under pressure as potential
vessel oversupply emerges. Increased
production from non-Nigerian West
Africa and the former Soviet Union,
however, could absorb some of this
oversupply, according to Clarkson.

Aframax
On Sept. 1, 2008, the Aframax fleet
had increased to 78.2 million dwt.
Another 4.8 million dwt scheduled
for delivery over the balance of 2008,
only partially offset by demolitions and
conversions, will grow the fleet to 81.9
million dwt by yearend 2008, according to Clarkson.
Aframax earnings ended 2007 at

Clarkson reports strong earnings
in the products market during the 6
months ending Sept. 1, 2008. Spot
earnings for clean product tankers averaged $30,779/day, up from $27,961/
day for the year-earlier period. Dirty
carriers averaged $43,699/day. Clarkson ascribed the strength in earnings
to a combination of pre-Olympic stock
building in China and extra hurricanerelated demand on the US Gulf Coast.
On Sept. 1, 2008, the 10,00060,000 dwt product tanker market
stood at 85.9 million dwt. Clarkson
expects the fleet to reach 91.8 million
dwt by end-2008 and 102.4 million
dwt by end-2009, a 26% increase on
the end-2007 fleet.
This growth in the fleet could lead
to tonnage oversupply. Combined with
uncertain demand growth, Clarkson
expects that rates could come under
pressure.

Chemical
Sept. 1, 2008, saw spot freight rates
moving up across the chemical segment from yearend 2007, according
to Clarkson. Rates for 15,000 tonnes
Persian Gulf-Far East rose 21.8%, with
Houston to Rotterdam for 5,000 tonnes
rising 23%.
Persian Gulf-Mediterranean rates
showed the sharpest increase, rising 41.3% (15,000 tonnes). Healthy
demand allowed ship owners to pass

rising bunker costs on to charterers.
Crew costs also continued to rise as the
qualified pool shrank.
As with the other tanker segments,
Clarkson sees heavy ordering in recent
years as creating a potential oversupply unless the credit crisis affects the
owners’ ability to finance newbuilds.
Buoyant biofuels markets and expanded
Middle East production tempered bearish sentiment in the chemicals segment.

LNG
Clarkson described the LNG segment
as depressed by uncertainty regarding
potential completion dates of several
liquefaction and regasification projects. New contracting for LNG carriers
depends more heavily on the shipment
needs of particular projects than other
tanker segments, with the spot market
for LNG vessels typically limited.
In the first 8 months of 2008, 30
vessels totaling 5.27 million cu m were
delivered to the fleet, the average size
being 155,735 cu m. This new tonnage,
combined with production delays, had
about 70 vessels available on the spot
market as of Sept. 1, 2008, depressing
charter rates accordingly. In total, 31
vessels were scheduled for delivery in
the last 4 months of 2008, 45 in 2009,
and 21 in 2010, but only five new
vessels were contracted in the first 8
months of 2008.
Prospects for major growth longer
term, according to Clarkson, continue
to depend on the success of Russian
and Iranian development plans. Iran in
particular, says Clarkson, could stimulate demand if all of its plans come to
fruition.
Failure to approve new projects and
on-schedule vessel delivery, however,
could extend the current rate softness
forward, according to Clarkson. ✦

In Russia-Ukraine
gas row, everyone
loses something
The new gas-price showdown between
Russia and Ukraine is a complex affair in
which all parties lose.
While it’s a misleading gloss to say
only—as some reports do—that Moscow
cut off wintertime gas supply to Europe,
European consumers indeed have experienced another untimely interruption of
crucial Russian deliveries.
Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly,

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e

at the beginning of this month suspended
sales in Ukraine amid a price dispute. A
few days later it cut almost all shipments
through Ukraine, saying the transit country
was using opacity of its gas operations to
siphon supplies destined for Europe.
Russia’s move looked especially heavyhanded when no less an authority than
President Vladimir Putin announced the
curtailment. Moscow has never been subtle
with its political pressure on the Westernleaning, economically distressed government in Kiev. But politics isn’t the only
story. Gazprom last year wanted to raise
the price of gas sold in Ukraine from $180/
thousand cu m (Mcm) to $250/Mcm, still
below the average $400/Mcm it received at
the time under oil-indexed ﬁxed contracts
in Europe. When Ukraine balked, Gazprom
countered with an improbable $480/Mcm.
The company reasonably can argue that
it had to end gas sales to Ukraine because
the commerce lost legal footing when the
contract expired Jan. 1. It also probably suspects Ukraine of hoping to win European
Union help in the price negotiations.
European ofﬁcials in fact reacted feverishly to the disruption of gas deliveries to
15 countries, some suffering extreme cold.
At this writing they were trying to coax
Russian and Ukrainian ofﬁcials into a deal
that would allow international monitoring
of Ukraine’s gas network and enable ﬂow
to restart.
Politically, commercially, or both,
everyone directly involved stands to lose
something.
Just as undelivered gas means chill in
Europe, it represents uncollected revenue
at Gazprom. The disruption underscores
the bargaining weakness of unconsolidated
European gas buyers. Ukraine will emerge
as either powerless victim or opportunistic
schemer. And Russia’s reputation as a secure source of gas, already damaged when
this happened 3 years ago, has weakened
further.
A potential winner, by interesting contrast, is the European coal business.

Market rally remains ‘elusive’
A sustained rally in oil and gas commodity prices “will be elusive” as markets
search for a self-supporting recovery and a reduction in asset market volatility into
2010, predicted Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC, in his ﬁrst report of the new year.
“Commodity indices posted their worst performance in recorded history last year,
primarily due to the collapse in spot prices,” Sieminski said. Moreover, he said, “We
expect global oil demand growth to be signiﬁcantly worse in 2009 than consensus
forecasts.” He predicts crude prices “will not hit rock bottom until the end of this year
as Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries production cuts work their way
through the system and global growth starts to recover.” He said a necessary condition for commodity prices to recover requires a signiﬁcant reduction in risk aversion
levels.
Meanwhile, Sieminski said, “The US natural gas outlook is being tempered by
the US recession and the possibility that new LNG export facilities in Asia and the
Middle-East will ofﬂoad product in North America. However, the US gas rig count is
falling rapidly and, in our view, this suggests that gas production could be contracting by up to 1% by the second half of 2009.”
In a separate report, Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, noted that in
the ﬁrst full week of commodity trading in 2009, West Texas Intermediate reversed
most of its price gains from the last week of 2008, trading in a wide $10/bbl range.
Jakob reported, “The average volume trading in crude oil futures during 2008
made a new record. If we bring the annual volume traded in crude oil futures to
a barrels per day basis, then in 1995 a volume corresponding to the daily world
production was traded each day on the futures exchanges. In 2000 the volume trading on futures was double the world production. That jumped to three times over in
2005, and in 2008 it was close to eight times the daily world production of crude oil
that was traded each day in crude oil futures. This jump in volume has also brought a
jump in volatility and is an input that needs to be taken in consideration when making a price forecast, or comparing current prices to history.”
The curse of Sisyphus
Sieminski said commodity markets currently are “suffering the curse of Sisyphus,” the ancient king of Corinth who, according to Greek mythology, was punished by the gods for his trickery by being condemned for all eternity to roll a heavy
boulder up a high hill only to watch it roll down again each time before he reached
the top.
“Like Sisyphus, we believe the ability of world growth to push commodity prices,
and speciﬁcally energy and industrial metal prices, higher in 2009 will be fraught
with difﬁculties,” said Sieminski. “In fact the current episode of volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, is second only to
1929. We believe the longer asset market volatility takes to subside, the larger the
downside risks to global growth and commodity prices will be.”
He said, “In terms of duration, if the current high level of volatility continues until
March, it would be on a par with events in 1932.”
Sieminski said, “What may interrupt this negative price outlook is not only new
money being put to work in the complex but also the aggressive monetary and ﬁscal action being adopted by central banks and governments around the world. For
example, in the next few weeks both the US and Europe will announce new ﬁscal
stimulus measures to cushion the economic downturn.”
Another view
Sisyphus’s curse is usually seen as an allegory for a repetitive attempt to complete an unrewarding, backbreaking task. But Albert Camus, an Algerian-born French
author, philosopher, and journalist who won the Nobel prize for literature in 1957,
provided a different interpretation in the Myth of Sisyphus, a 1942 philosophical
essay. Each time the boulder crashes down the hillside returning to its lowest level,
Sisyphus standing near the summit before starting down to try again is at that moment “superior to his fate,” Camus argued, adding, “He is stronger than his rock.”
He said, “Sisyphus teaches the higher ﬁdelity that negates the gods and raises
rocks. ...The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to ﬁll a man’s heart. One
must imagine Sisyphus happy.”
That same description might apply to many of the oilmen who stick with this
industry through all of its booms and busts.

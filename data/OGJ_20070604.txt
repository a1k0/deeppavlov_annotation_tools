COVER
A Precision Drilling Co. rig drills for the former Burlington Resources Canada, now part of ConocoPhillips, at Tumbler Ridge near
Chetwynd, BC, in late 2005.This area lies in the Foothills Domain, one of six domains interpreted as being part of the structured
belt of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.The author suggests
that the structured belt may contain several hundred trillion cubic
feet of recoverable gas in conventional and nonconventional plays.
A four-part article on the structured belt interpretation starts on
p. 36 in OGJ’s New Views of the Subsurface special report. Photo

Oil worker kidnappings continue in Nigeria
Nigeria’s ability to defend international oil operations came
under scrutiny again May 25 when local militants kidnapped six
foreign oil workers—including three Americans—from a pipelaying ship owned by Texas-based Transcoastal Corp. under contract
to Nigeria’s Conoil.
Shots were fired during the abduction, which occurred off the
coast of the Niger Delta near the Brass oil export terminal. According to industry sources, the Americans, two British citizens, and
one South African were abducted by the militants who used two
speed boats in the attack.
The attack on the Transcoastal ship follows earlier warnings
about the increase of piracy off the coast of Nigeria. In April the
International Maritime Bureau said that oil tankers and installations
off Nigeria continue to be a main target of pirate attacks, despite
a downward trend elsewhere around the globe (OGJ Online, Apr.
30, 2007).
Coming just a day after gunmen kidnapped a Polish engineer
near Warri, the Brass raid brings the number of hostages now held
by militants to 22. The upsurge in violence over the past 18 months
continues to depress production by nearly 1 million b/d, or 25%.
On May 15 Royal Dutch Shell PLC said it had been forced to cut
170,000 b/d of oil production after villagers demanding money
occupied a major pipeline, bringing the total shut down through
unrest, sabotage, and militant action to 980,000 b/d, nearly a third
of Nigeria’s 3 million b/d capacity.
The Shell shutdown is apparently unrelated to raids by the
Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta that took place
earlier in May. At the time, Chevron shut down 15,000 b/d of oil
production after one Nigerian sailor was killed and six foreign oil
workers were kidnapped by members of MEND, who May 1 attacked the company’s Oloibiri floating production, storage, and
offloading vessel off southern Bayelsa state (OGJ Online, May 2,
2007).

and gas operations in a manner that accommodates the surface
owners by minimizing intrusion upon and damage to the surface
of the land.”
Greg Schnacke, executive vice-president of the Colorado Oil &
Gas Association (COGA) in Denver, said oil and gas companies are
unclear about exactly what the new law will mean to industry.
COGA statistics show that more than 80% of drilling permits
filed in the state already are accompanied by a negotiated surface
agreement, Schnacke noted.
“Nobody has ever called a surface owner protection bond,”
Schnacke said, adding that Colorado oil and gas companies already
maintain good relationships with surface owners.
“The concept is an attempt to put into statute what generally
already is occurring today. You always are liable for negligence,”
Schnacke said, adding that COGA expects someone probably will
file a lawsuit stemming from the new law.

DOE awards $22.7 million for basic solar research
The US Department of Energy recently announced $22.7 million in funding over 3 years for 27 solar energy research projects
that will be conducted by universities and national laboratories in
18 states.
DOE Undersecretary for Science Raymond Orbach said the projects are part of an “aggressive basic research in the physical sciences—what I call transformational science” intended to push the
cost-effectiveness of renewable energy.
These projects, along with the commercialization projects
funded through the Solar America Initiative, are part of President
George W. Bush’s Advanced Energy Initiative. DOE plans to fund
additional projects in fiscal year 2008.
The projects will address two priority technical areas: conversion of solar energy to electricity and conversion of solar energy
to chemical fuels.
About $9.9 million and 14 projects involve research into converting sunlight to electricity. The goal is to greatly reduce costs
while improving the conversion efficiency.
About $12.8 million for 13 projects involve research into direct
conversion of sunlight into chemical fuels. This project overcomes
a problem of the day vs. night variation of the solar resource and
provides solar-derived energy in forms useful for transportation,
residential, and industrial applications.

Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter on May 29 signed legislation that promoters said clarifies the structure for negotiated compromises between oil and gas companies and surface landowners.
The Oil & Gas Accountability Project (OGAP) of Durango helped
write the law, which it called “precedent-setting legislation that is
one of the most powerful state laws in the nation in terms of proWind power costs, investment up next 5 years
tecting landowners’ rights and the environment.”

“Successful exploration could lead to

BP said.
BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward described the deal as the company’s “single
biggest exploration commitment.” The
company hasn’t worked in Libya since the
country nationalized the oil industry more
than 30 years ago.
NOC wants to boost Libya’s oil reserves
to 20 billion boe under a plan covering
2005-15 through an aggressive offshore

BP PLC and a Libyan partner will drill
17 exploratory wells under a $900 million contract with Libya’s National Oil
Co. (NOC) covering 54,000 sq km in the
onshore Ghadames basin and frontier offshore part of the Sirte basin. BP said its
program will primarily target gas.
BP and the partner, Libya Investment
Co., will shoot 5,500 km of 2D seismic
survey and 30,000 sq km of 3D seismic
survey.

expects to increase production to 3.5 million b/d by 2020 by encouraging the drilling of at least 50 wildcats/year and acquiring at
least 4,000 sq km/year of 3D seismic data and 10,000 km/year of
2D seismic data.
“These targets will be met through existing NOC and joint venture operations and through investment by international oil companies expected to total some $7 billion,” BP said.
Libyan professionals will receive petroleum education and
training under a $50 million program organized by BP and NOC
during the exploration and appraisal period of the new contract. If
oil is found, an additional $50 million will be invested on training
once production starts.

Total makes two oil ﬁnds on Angola’s Block 32
Total E&P Angola (Block 32) Ltd. and its partners have made two
more oil discoveries on deepwater Block 32 off Angola.
The Cominhos-1 well was drilled on the northeastern part of
the block in 1,594 m of water and tested 6,258 b/d of 32° gravity
oil. Oil came from a selected Lower Oligocene reservoir. The exploration well is 18 km north of the company’s Caril-1 discovery (OGJ
Online, Feb. 8, 2007).
The second well, Louro-1, was drilled in the southern part of
Block 32 in 1,806 m of water and found both Miocene and Oligocene oil-bearing reservoirs. The find lies 4.5 km west of the Salsa-1
discovery.
Angola’s Sonangol is concessionaire of Block 32. Total holds a
30% interest in the block and serves as operator. Other Block 32
partners are Marathon Oil Co. 30%, Sonangol EP 20%, Esso E&P
Angola (Overseas) Ltd. 15%, and Petrogal 5%.

BP makes another strike on Angola’s Block 31
BP Exploration (Angola) Ltd. and Angola’s Sonangol EP have
made their fourteenth oil discovery on ultradeepwater Block 31
off Angola.
The Cordelia well tested 2,063 b/d of oil through a 20⁄64-in.
choke. The well was drilled in 2,308 m of water using the Jack
Ryan drillship and reached 4,040 m TVD.
The well is 31⁄2 km southeast of the recent Miranda discovery,
which flowed on test at 3,822 b/d through a 48⁄64-in. choke (OGJ
Online, May 7, 2007).
BP is the block operator and holds 26.67% interest. Other stakeholders are Esso E&P Angola (Block 31) Ltd. 25%, Sonangol 20%,
Statoil Angola AS 13.33%, Marathon International Petroleum Angola Block 31 Ltd. 10%, and Total Group subsidiary Tepa (Block
31) Ltd. 5%.

MMS proposes Central Gulf Lease Sale 205
The US Minerals Management Service proposed an Oct. 3 lease
sale in the newly configured Central Gulf of Mexico Planning
Area.
The sale, to be held in New Orleans, would be the first central
gulf sale in the MMS 2007-12 Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas
leasing program.
The sale would involve 5,000 blocks covering more than 28.5
million acres. The acreage is 3-210 miles offshore in 4-3,400 m
of water.
8

Sale 205 excludes the areas under moratorium and respects the
buffers created for the Florida coast.
MMS estimates that as much as 1.3 billion bbl of oil and 5.2
tcf of natural gas could be discovered and produced from the lease
sale area.

Statoil discovers light oil in Norwegian North Sea
Statoil ASA has found light oil in wildcat well 15/6-9 S, which
was drilled on production license 303 in the Norwegian North
Sea.
The well is 7 km north of Sleipner field and 3 km east of the
15/5-1 Dagny discovery in the central part of the North Sea.
Seadrill’s West Epsilon jack up drilled the well to 3,850 m TD in
114 m of water. West Epsilon will now drill a sidetrack to delineate
the discovery.
Statoil said the find will contribute to its goal of producing
1 million boe/d from the Norwegian continental shelf until
2015.
Statoil has not carried out a production test and has focused on
gathering extensive data collection and sampling. It will consider
producing the discovery with a tie-in to Sleipner, Volve, or Gudrun.

Ascent Resources suspends Hungarian well
Ascent Resources PLC has suspended its PEN-102 exploration
well in northeast Hungary as it investigates drilling a sidetrack well
to target the Miocene gas reservoir.
Ascent drilled the PEN-102 well to 1,500 m TD within its Nyirseg exploration permits.
“Drilling and logging results indicated that the well had intercepted a fault system and consequently the target Miocene tuffaceous formations were encountered 38 m deeper than prognosis,”
Ascent said.
The company found residual gas in the deeper section of the
reservoir and shot a seismic survey to identify the orientation of
the fault system. After interpreting the survey, Ascent plans to drill
a sidetrack well.
PEN-102 is the third well of a four-well program to be drilled
under a farm-in agreement Ascent has with Canada’s DualEx and
Sweden’s Petro Pequnia. The partners will acquire working interests in the Nyirseg permits of 37.5% and 2%, respectively,
by paying 75% and 4% of the costs of these wells. Through its
subsidiary PetroHungaria, Ascent will contribute the outstanding
21% for the drilling costs and keep a 60.5% working interest in
the permits.
“The drilling rig will move to the last of the four farm-in wells,
VAM-1, a gas exploration well designed to test exploration prospects in both the Miocene and Pannonian formations in the Vamospercs area, some 14 km farther southwest of PEN-102,” Ascent
said.
Ascent said, “A successful sidetrack of the PEN-102 could yet
add reserves to the planned Peneszlek development in Hungary,”
which includes the PEN-104 discovery and other proved reserves
in PEN-9 and PEN-12. ✦

Gas sales start from Turkish Black Sea

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The first natural gas sold from the Turkish Black Sea has begun
flowing from the South Akcakoca subbasin to AKSA, a Turkish gas
distributor, reports Toreador Resources Corp. (OGJ, Apr. 16, 2007,
Newsletter).
Initial production for the AKSA sale is 29 MMcfd of gas from
three wells on the Akkaya platform. Production is expected to increase to 50 MMcfd by this year’s third quarter, when three platforms are on stream. The contract is for 3 years, based on volume.
Toreador has 36.75% interest in the project, state-owned TPAO
has 51%, and Stratic Energy Corp. has 12.25%.

this drilling program, which will comprise a total of 12 development wells and 3 water disposal wells.
In addition, engineering design is under way on two additional
platforms, which are to be installed in and around the Jasmine
production area following a successful exploration program conducted in first half 2006.
At the end of this year’s first quarter, two existing platforms,
Jasmine A and B, were producing at a gross average rate of 24,000
b/d of oil. Production started at the Jasmine A platform June 7,
2005, and at Jasmine B on Jan. 22 of this year (OGJ Online, Jan.
26, 2007).

Pearl starts up Jasmine C platform off Thailand

Venoco runs six rigs in Sacramento basin

Pearl Energy Ltd., a unit of Aabar Petroleum Investments Co.
PJSC of Abu Dhabi, began production of 1,450 b/d of oil from a
single development well at the Jasmine C platform in the Gulf of
Thailand.
The platform is connected via a 3.8-km pipeline to the Jasmine
venture MV7 floating production, storage, and offloading vessel.
Its 1,150-tonne processing topsides were installed Mar. 21, and
drilling of the first group of development wells started Apr. 25. Two
additional development wells, C2 and C3, will be completed and
brought on production in the next few days of the initial phase of

Venoco Inc., Denver, spud 34 wells in the quarter ended Mar.
31 in the Sacramento basin, where it plans to drill more than 120
wells in 2007.
Venoco doubled the number of rigs it is running in the basin to
six from three in the quarter.
The company’s program is focused mainly on infill drilling and
recompletions, and it set casing on 30 of the 34 first quarter wells.
More completion rigs are expected to be available the rest of the
year.
The company has expanded its land position 164,000 net acres
in the basin, where it operates about 250 gas wells. ✦

Processing
Koch to add hydrocracking unit at Navajo reﬁnery
Koch Partners LP will design, supply, and install a gas oil mild
hydrocracker at Navajo Refining Co. LP’s 60,000 b/cd refinery in
Artesia, NM.
The unit, which will use Process Dynamics Inc.’s IsoTherming
process, will have an initial capacity of 15,000 b/sd and be expandable to 30,000 b/sd. It is expected to be operational in fourth
quarter 2008.
The project will increase the refinery’s capacity to process outside feedstocks and increase yields of higher-valued products. It
also will be a key component in the company’s overall strategy for
producing low-sulfur transportation fuels.

Combine lets coker contract for Jubail reﬁnery
Aramco Services Co. and Total France have let a contract to Foster Wheeler USA Corp. for a process design package for a new delayed coker, which will be part of the 400,000 b/d export refinery
to be built in Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia.
The coker design package will be developed by Foster Wheeler’s
Houston office. Terms of the award were not disclosed.
The delayed coker, expected to be one of the largest in the
world, will be based on Foster Wheeler’s selective yield delayed coking process, which upgrades heavy, high-sulfur residue feed into high value transport fuels with minimum fuel
coke yields.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
The planned Jubail refinery will be a grassroots full-conversion
plant designed to process Arabian heavy crude. It is slated for startup in 2011 (OGJ Online, Sept. 4, 2006).

Nigerian group wins Port Harcourt reﬁnery bid
Blue Star, a consortium of Nigerian companies Zenon Oil, Dangote Oil, and Gas & Transnational Corp., paid $561 million to acquire 51% of a government-owned stake in Nigeria’s Port Harcourt
refinery.
The companies, which are headed by close associates of the
country’s outgoing President Olusegun Obasanjo, won the bid
over UK-based international steel baron Lakshmi Niwas Mittal,
who bid $550 million.
Blue Star emerged the winner in open bidding conducted last
weekend in Abuja by the Nigerian privatization agency Bureau of
Public Enterprises.
Sources at Indian government-owned refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. (HPCL) said Mittal originally had planned to bid
for the 210,000 b/d refinery with HPCL, but instead bid it alone
when HPCL decided against investing in the facility.
The Indian-born Mittal earlier this year had accepted a 49%
stake in HPCL’s proposed $3.3 billion Bhatinda refinery to be built
in Punjab, northwestern India (OGJ Online, Feb. 22, 2007).
India’s largest refiner Indian Oil Corp., also invited to bid on the
Port Harcourt refinery, decided against making an offer. Two other
bidders, local fuel marketer Oando and a combine of Sahara and
Refinee PetroPlus, were disqualified. ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Contract let for west-east Malaysian oil line
Ranhill Engineers & Constructors Sdn. Bhd. (REC), a wholly
owned unit of Ranhill Bhd. of Kuala Lumpur, has secured a contract for the design, engineering, procurement, construction, and
testing of a 320-km west-east oil pipeline across Malaysia.
REC entered into a master alliance agreement with Trans-Peninsula Petroleum Sdn. Bhd. (Transpen), also of Kuala Lumpur, and
Tripatra Engineers & Consultants of Jakarta for the Malaysian TransPeninsula Pipeline.
Ranhill said Transpen was granted exclusive rights by the Malaysian government to develop the project, which will receive oil
from carriers off Western Peninsular Malaysia and store, transport,
and deliver oil to carriers off Eastern Peninsular Malaysia.
Work on the pipeline is slated to start in 2008 and be completed
in 2014, according to Transpen Chairman Rahim Kamil Sulaiman,
who told a news conference that oil would be loaded onto tankers bound for Japan, China, and South Korea, bypassing Singapore
and the Malacca Strait, which currently supports transportation of
about 50% of the world’s oil.
Sulaiman’s statement confirmed reports in early May that Malaysia had agreed to build the pipeline from northwestern Kedah state, across Perak state, to northeastern Kelantan state which
fronts the South China Sea. At the time Prime Minister Datuk Seri
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the project would enable Middle
Eastern shippers to reach East Asian markets without risking cargoes along the busy, pirate-prone Malacca Strait (OGJ Online,
May 7, 2007).
The Ranhill statement did not mention refineries. However,
Mahdzir Khalid, the chief minister for Kedah state, through which
the line will extend, told reporters that two refineries with a combined refining capacity of 450,000 b/d will be built in Kedah by
2010. He said Malaysia’s SKS Ventures and Merapoh Resources
Corp. would reveal arrangements for the refineries in August.

FERC issues ﬁnal EIS for Gulf South gas line

ment calling for the plant’s full capacity of 3.4 million tonnes/
year.
The first cargo was destined for Lake Charles, La., although BG
has the option to divert the cargo elsewhere.
Interest holders in the plant are Marathon 60%, state-owned
Sonagas 25%, Marubeni Gas Development Co. Ltd. 6.5%, and Mitsui & Co. Ltd. 8.5%.

Northeast Gateway LNG port gets Marad nod
Excelerate Energy LLC subsidiary Northeast Gateway Energy
Bridge LLC has received its deepwater port license from the US
Maritime Administration (Marad) for its Northeast Gateway deepwater LNG importation facility in Massachusetts Bay.
Construction will begin soon, and gas deliveries from the
Northeast Gateway facility to Massachusetts and the rest of New
England are anticipated by yearend.
The LNG facility will be designed to handle peak deliveries of as
much as 800 MMcfd of gas. During normal operations the facility
will be able to deliver about 500 MMcfd of gas, or 20% of New
England’s current annual gas consumption.
The port’s infrastructure will feature two submerged turret
loading buoys supplied by Advanced Production & Loading Inc.
Excelerate Energy will build and own the Northeast Gateway
deepwater port 18 miles east of Boston. It will be operated by
Skaugen Offshore and will accommodate Excelerate’s proprietary
Energy Bridge Regasification Vessel (EBRV) fleet operated by Exmar
NV.
Spectra Energy, formerly Duke Energy, will build a 16-mile subsea pipeline from its existing HubLine to the deepwater port site
to transfer gas from the vessels into New England’s gas pipeline
network.
Northeast Gateway will be the first new LNG importation facility to serve the east coast in more than 25 years. And it is the
world’s second deepwater LNG importation facility.
The first, Gulf Gateway, 116 miles south of Cameron Parish, La.,
in the Gulf of Mexico, is owned and operated also by Excelerate Energy, which recently increased its LNG vessel fleet through equity
investments in three new EBRVs to be constructed by 2010. This
brings the company’s LNG vessel involvement to eight regasification vessels and one traditional LNG carrier.

The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission concluded that
the proposed East Texas-to-Mississippi natural gas pipeline project
is environmentally acceptable, FERC said in a final environmental
impact statement.
The project, proposed by Gulf South Pipeline Co., would transport 1.7 bcfd of gas from East Texas to the US Gulf Coast, Midwest,

R&D: results amid doubt
Angel White
Associate Editor
Recent actions by the administration
of US President George W. Bush raise
industry concerns about the future of
federal funding for oil and gas research
and development. The administration
has repeatedly excluded from its annual
budget proposals funding for oil and
gas R&D by the Department of Energy’s
Office of Fossil Energy (OFE). Yet OFE
continues to participate in such projects, although at decreased funding
levels.
In fact, OFE’s National Energy
Technology Laboratory and Texas A&M
University recently completed a 3-year,
$890,000 research project that developed a computerized method for rapidly interpreting field tracer tests. OFE
funded $630,000 of the project’s cost,
and the university provided the rest.

technology feasible for small independent producers.
The system enhances reservoir
characterization, enabling its users to
identify unswept regions in mature
fields with high oil or gas saturation.
It uses computer models to characterize a productive oil reservoir. Historymatching then calibrates the model by
correlating its predictions of oil and
gas production to a reservoir’s actual
production history.
A key input to history-matching is
data from tracer tests, in which traceable gases or liquids are injected into a
well to determine the paths and velocities of fluids as they move through the
reservoir. This information helps reservoir engineers calculate how much oil
remains in the reservoir and determine
the most efficient way to sweep the
residual oil from the reservoir.

lies in difficult-to-access pockets and
that predicting the location and size of
these elusive, compartmentalized deposits is costly because it often requires
complex computing.
Many independent producers, the
agency said, aren’t able to commit
the labor or buy the expensive supercomputer time required to create and
operate the models needed to access
bypassed oil.
With federal R&D funding uncertain,
Texas A&M researchers have responded
to interest in their new technology by
assembling an industry R&D consortium funded by eight production and
service companies. The consortium has
won a grant from the National Science
Foundation, and its technology has
been adopted by two companies.

From fallacy to law
Fallacy plus propaganda can equal irresistible
politics and expensive mistakes. In a tantrum over
gasoline prices, the US House has passed a bill that
makes “price-gouging” a federal crime. The Senate
will consider similar legislation this month. The
measure is an exquisite fallacy enshrouded in propaganda. Unless lawmakers come to their senses, it
will pass.
The bill, HR 1252, makes a crime out of behavior it can’t define. During an emergency declared
by the US president, it would be illegal for anyone
to sell oil products at a price that was “unconscionably excessive” and that indicated the seller
was “taking unfair advantage of the circumstances
related to an energy emergency to increase prices
unreasonably.” The bill offers parameters by which
to assess these ambiguities, among them whether
a price “grossly exceeds” either the average price
during the 30 days before the emergency or the
prices of products available from other sellers in
the same area. Sellers must await prosecution to
learn the meaning of “grossly exceeds.”

Riot of adverbs
From nowhere amid this riot of scornful
adverbs does there emerge a useful definition of
the activity that Congress would make a criminal
offense. Indeed, no such definition is possible because the activity never occurs in any general way.
Competition doesn’t allow it. Sellers who aggressively raise prices during emergency shortages lose
business to competitors who do not. Markets are
self-enforcing. Continuous monitoring by federal
authorities ensures that fuel markets work. This is
partly why all formal investigations of past price
increases have uncovered no “gouging” by refiners
or major marketers.
HR 1252 thus makes a federal crime out of behavior that its sponsors can’t define, that economic
theory rejects, and that history says doesn’t exist.
It’s a meaningless stack of empty phrases—“pricegouging,” “unconscionably excessive,” “unfair
advantage,” “grossly exceeds.” It’s propaganda devoid of substance that threatens victims of unlucky
interpretation with stiff civil and criminal fines,
even jail terms. Lawmaking can’t get much worse
than this.
Yet who will oppose a measure that professes
to capture and punish “price-gougers?” Americans

spoiled by decades of low fuel prices have ridden
their excesses into an uncomfortable market turn.
Many of them are angry and want the government
to make prices low again. Lawmakers are accommodating them by inventing a class of villains.
They’ll be hard to dissuade from their mistake.
And what a mistake it will prove to be the next
time hurricanes wallop refineries or something
chokes crude oil supplies. Prices jump at times like
those. So what is an oil seller who doesn’t want
to go to prison supposed to do? Allowing prices
to rise with the market risks having the increase
deemed “grossly excessive.” The safe alternative is
to sell below the market, drain inventories, shun
replacement supplies, and suspend sales until the
emergency subsides.
HR 1252 thus would discourage product sales
in a supply emergency, just what consumers don’t
need. The gullible would see compensation in the
absence of “price-gouging.” But there’s no pricegouging now. Why impose a costly and unnecessary tradeoff?
Self-destructive nonsense like HR 1252 comes
about because of an unseemly need of politicians
to assign blame. When gasoline prices arouse
public ire, politicians blame oil companies. They
do so despite the investigations that regularly find
oil companies innocent of price manipulation.
And they incite suspicions about “price-gouging”
when no such thing exists in a free market.

Dodging blame
This all is a dodge. Blame for the elevation of
fuel prices belongs to Congress and federal agencies. Fuel specifications are stricter and more prescriptive than they need to be and add unnecessary
costs to the manufacture of gasoline, diesel, and
other oil products. US laws and regulations, on
matters ranging from federal oil and gas leasing
to permitting of refineries and pipelines, have for
decades militated against the expansion of supply.
With consumption unrestrained, a price-raising
crunch was inevitable.
Instead of accepting blame and correcting
errors, though, lawmakers seem determined to
spin law out of fallacy and claim, incredibly, to be
helping consumers. They might just as well outlaw
hurricanes. ✦

N T E R E S T
Since 1995, a totally unanticipated restructuring of the US refining
industry has reconstituted the corporate identities of the largest refiners.
By 2007, venerable names—Amoco,
Arco, Ashland, Clark, Coastal, DiamondShamrock, Texaco, and Unocal—had
disappeared from the roster. Has the industry reached such concentration levels that further mergers and acquisitions
will be successfully challenged
by government agencies? Is the
M&A party over? This article
concludes that it is not.
According to the 1995 OGJ
refinery survey, 91 companies
operated 169 refineries with
15.4 million b/d of refining capacity in the US (OGJ, Dec. 18,
1995, p. 41). By 2007, OGJ reported,
the number of refining companies had
dropped to 51 companies operating
131 refineries with a total capacity of
17.3 million b/cd (OGJ, Dec. 18, 2006,
p. 56, and OGJ Online survey).
In the intervening years, refinery
capacity had risen by 1.9 million b/d.
Fig. 1 shows the change in the structure over those years. The cumulative
capacities for the individual companies
are arrayed from the largest companies
on the left to the smallest on the right.
During 1995-2006 the curve moved up
(more capacity) and to the left (fewer
companies).

Downstream mergers,
capacity hikes persist

Remarkably, no new grassroots
refineries were built during that period,
but total US capacity increased by the
equivalent of almost one world-class
refinery (250,000 b/d) every year. Table
1, taken from OGJ refinery surveys,
shows a recap of the largest refiners in
1995 and 2006 (those with more than
200,000 b/d of capacity.) In a rash of
mergers and acquisitions, the top 25
refining companies in 1995 had been
absorbed by the top 14 of 2006 in the
manner shown in Fig. 2. In the process,
there were survivors and casualties.

Adding the squares of the shares of
the remaining 47 companies gives the
sum of 768, the US refining industry’s
HHI.
The US Department of Justice holds
that: “Markets in which the HHI is between 1,000 and 1,800 are considered
to be moderately concentrated, and
those in which the HHI is greater than
1,800 points are considered to be concentrated.”3 In 2007, the US refining
industry is well below those standards.
Some concerned economists might
well point out that the US is not just
one market but a composite of several.

2006, the refining industry in the US,
or even in its logistical submarkets,
is still less concentrated than what
economists accept as important benchmarks. For that reason, mergers and
acquisitions, such as Tesoro’s acquisition
of Shell’s 100,000 b/cd Wilmington,
Calif., refinery the first of this year, may
continue for some time as companies
seek to achieve economies of size and
scope, and others choose to continue
exiting the business.5 ✦

Rahall said.
He said the primary witnesses were
limited to representatives of the current
presidential administration to give it
“the opportunity to testify in person in
the event that it wanted to defend its
position with respect to specific provisions or to offer constructive advice
in its capacity as the entity that would
have to implement provisions of the bill
should it become law.”
As they testified, however, the federal
witnesses generally said their agencies
needed more time to consider the bill’s
potential impacts and would have to
submit written comments later.

Defends provisions
In his opening statement, Rahall also
defended the bill’s provisions, which
he said grew out of 13 committee and
subcommittee hearings. They showed
that the federal government is not
receiving a fair return on energy produced from public resources and that
recreational and agricultural activities
are being harmed, he said.
“I have heard the allegation that this
bill repeals the Energy Policy Act of
2005,” Rahall said. “There are 530 sections in that act, 84 of which fall under
this committee’s jurisdiction. Of those
84, HR 2337 amends only seven of
those provisions.”
The EPACT provisions that would
be repealed include a requirement for
BLM to process onshore drilling permit
applications in 30 days, suspension of
permit processing fees, and initiation

of a process that could lead to oil shale
and tar sands development. Rahall said
the hearings also revealed that surface
landholders need more rights in federal
split-estate situations and that produced
water uses should be restricted.
But his strongest attack was on
MMS’s RIK program, which the agency
says has reduced operating expenses
and increased revenues but which
Rahall said is plagued with scandal.
“According to media reports, the Justice
Department has launched a criminal investigation into the activities of top officials involved with the royalty-in-kind
program. The inquiry appears to focus
on the cozy relationship between these
officials and those in industry who seek
contracts from them,” he said.
An MMS spokesman confirmed to
OGJ that the Department of Justice is
investigating two possible ethics violations in the RIK program following a
probe by Department of Interior’s inspector general and that the program’s
director, Gregory Smith, is retiring
effective May 26.
HR 2337 would require MMS to
conduct a minimum of 550 oil and
gas lease audits each fiscal year. In his
testimony, Cruickshank said compliance reviews, which MMS uses as a
less expensive alternative to full audits
on high-volume properties, collected $3.27/$ spent from fiscal 2003
through 2005, compared with $2.07
collected through audits.
Committee Democrats generally
applauded the bill. “It’s a good place to

start to assure we get a fair return from
production on public lands. Compared
to other parts of the world, where assets
can be seized, our government extracts
relatively little from those who produce
oil and gas on its holdings in a much
more secure political environment,”
said George Miller of California.
Others called for a more cautious
approach. “Repealing the 30-day drilling permit decision deadline could
have consequences. Maybe 30 days isn’t
the right time period, but leaving it
open-ended could be problematic,” said
another Californian, Jim Costa.
Dan Boren of Oklahoma said he
backed Rahall’s commitment to an
open process but added that domestic
drilling has grown and production will
follow soon since EPACT’s enactment.
“I’m glad this committee is taking its
oversight responsibilities seriously, but
this bill would increase energy costs
and place a greater burden on the poor,
something that Democrats traditionally
oppose,” he said.
Some Republicans said the bill is a
mistake. Chief minority member Don
Young of Alaska said it would make domestic energy more expensive and less
available. Doug Lamborn of Colorado
said, “Section 306 raises disturbing
implications of federal interference in
groundwater, which traditionally has
been handled by states.”
Rahall reiterated that the bill could
change. “Very few introduced measures
are perfect. I do not view HR 2337 as
being written in stone,” he said. ✦

Senate Democrats promise bill with ‘gouging’ measure

US Senate Democrats said they
will soon bring an energy bill to the
floor that will make oil product price
manipulation a federal crime, mandate
more efficient government offices and
motor fleets, increase biofuel supplies,

28

and accelerate market entry of other
alternative fuels.
Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.)
said he originally planned to bring the
bill before the full Senate immediately
after the week-long Memorial Day
recess but decided to delay it for a week
to allow full debate on immigration
legislation.
The package will contain bills from

the Energy and Natural Resources,
Environment and Public Works, and the
Commerce, Science, and Transportation committees, Reid said in a May 23
briefing.
He was joined by Jeff Bingaman (DNM), who chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee; Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.), who chairs Environment and
Public Works; John F. Kerry (D-Mass.),

who chairs Commerce, Science, and Transportation’s Science, Technology, and Innovation Subcommittee; and Maria
Cantwell (D-Wash.), a member of the Energy and Natural
Resources and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation
committees.
Despite a backdrop proclaiming “Energy Independence,”
Reid said the bill, designated “The Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007,” is a
starting point. “We think anything we do should have some
effect on the gluttony of the oil companies. The mere fact
that we’re talking about legislation should get their attention,” he said.

‘Sends a message’
Noting that the US sent $250 billion overseas in 2006
to import crude and products, Reid added: “The mere fact
we’re moving legislation on the floor should send a message
to oil cartels.”
Cantwell said Reid notified six committee chairmen in
January that energy would be a top Senate priority in 2007.
“It is critically important, as we research and develop cleaner
energy alternatives, that consumers are protected, particularly
during supply emergencies,” she said on May 23.
Later that afternoon, the House passed its own bill directed against alleged oil-product price manipulation, HR
1252, originally introduced by Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.),
by a 281-184 vote.
Cantwell’s bill was added to motor vehicle fuel efficiency
legislation that passed the Senate Commerce Committee on
May 8 and will be part of the energy legislation package due
on the floor in June.
That bill will offer energy steps more easily achieved than
the bigger ones that need to be taken to solve the US energy
dilemma, Boxer said.
“It’s low-hanging fruit that can be picked right now,” she
said. “We have decided that the federal government should
be a model of energy efficiency by retrofitting buildings that
it owns and office space that it leases. I’m also excited that
we have the administration’s support in offering matching
funds to states and cities for similar efforts. And the 60,000
cars which the federal government buys each year will have
to be as fuel-efficient as possible.”
Bingaman said the package will contain language from
the energy and commerce committees dealing with cellulosic ethanol, energy efficiency, and carbon sequestration.
Provisions requiring creation of a power generation portfolio of renewable sources, lighting efficiency, and additional
renewable fuel incentives could be added on the floor, he
said.
“This will be one of the most significant debates we have
in Congress this year,” said Kerry, who noted that the commerce committee’s contribution to the package was its motor
fuel efficiency and oil product price-gouging bill. ✦

It’s also possible the press conference was postponed because of
so much other oil and gas activity
in Congress. On May 23 alone, the
House Natural Resources Committee
held a hearing on HR 2337, which,
to put it mildly, is controversial.
“I cannot recall a bill that has

He’s not alone this time. In discussions of other bills that are seemingly

HR 2337, which primarily deals with
onshore federal resource management, Brown asked five government

US House cites similar
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Cost-cutting efforts created a culture
at BP America Inc. that led to compromises of systems integrity at its Alaska
North Slope oil-gathering pipelines and
of workplace safety at its Texas City, Tex.,
refinery, witnesses and federal lawmakers agreed on May 16.
“Virtually all of the seven root causes
identified for the Prudhoe Bay incidents
have strong echoes in Texas City,” said
US Chemical Safety Board Chairwoman
Carolyn W. Merritt. She had been asked
by the House Energy and Commerce
Committee’s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee to compare Booz
Allen Hamilton’s analysis of the oil line
leaks for BP with CSB’s investigation of
the Mar. 23, 2005, explosion and fire at
the refinery.
“Both reports point to the significant
role of budget and production pressures
in driving BP’s decision-making—and
ultimately harming safety.... Both investigations found deficiencies in how BP
managed the safety of process changes.... Other common findings included
flawed communication of lessons
learned, excessive decentralization of
safety functions, and high management
turnover,” Merritt told the subcommittee during a hearing on causes of the
oil leaks.
Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.), the
subcommittee’s chairman, also found
similarities. “One of the primary findings in the CSB report was that ‘costcutting and budget pressures from BP
group executive managers impaired
process safety at Texas City’.... Similarly,
documents made available to this subcommittee suggest that BP field managers were under extreme pressure to cut
costs in Alaska,” he said in his opening
statement.

Leak causes revisited

problems with BP line, reﬁnery
was intended to update corrective actions that BP, as well as
state and federal agencies, were taking at Prudhoe Bay. Documents that BP recently supplied to the full committee made
it necessary to revisit the issue of what caused the leaks, he
said.
“Some of these documents were actually available to BP
officials before the Sept. 6 hearing, yet BP failed to disclose
this information. These documents show that cost-cutting
pressures on Prudhoe Bay operations were severe enough
that some BP field managers were considering reducing or
halting a range of actions related to preventing or reducing
corrosion,” Stupak said.
BP America Chairman Robert A. Malone said cost-cutting
pressures helped create problems at Texas City and Prudhoe
Bay. But he also suggested that the ANS oil-gathering line
leaks may have been caused more by employees placing too
much confidence in corrosion inhibitors’ effectiveness.
“Booz Allen Hamilton concluded that in the absence of
better risk assessment processes, budget increases alone
would not have prevented the leaks. Our own work has
revealed that the workforce did not have an adequate process
to challenge their own assumptions,” he said in his written
statement.
In questioning Malone, Stupak noted that the BAH report
concluded that because BP Alaska’s health, safety, and environment program focused exclusively on workplace safety,
its major accident risk and hazard assessments did not consider corrosion risk on the oil transit lines (OTL).
“These risk assessment approaches might have identified
the changing profile of the OTL created by the changing
operating conditions,” the report says. Stupak said falling
production at Prudhoe Bay reduced pressure and added produced water to what was going through the gathering lines,
making corrosion inhibitors much less effective.
Malone said the BAH report concluded that the leak occurred because there was no formal risk-assessment process
that considered the oil field’s changing operations and conditions. “It suggests that if we had given them more money,
they wouldn’t necessarily have used it because they were
confident the system they were using was working,” he told
Stupak.

BP’s reforms
Since becoming BP America’s chairman in July 2006,
Malone said he has installed managers in Alaska as part of a
series of reforms across all of BP PLC’s US division.

Russia goes
after TNK-BP

H

ave we spoken enough of the
Russian government and its depressing effects on the international
oil and gas industry? Apparently we
haven’t, given recent events which
portend further ills for all concerned
parties.
Last week, Russian regulators
were poised to begin discussing the
withdrawal of the license held by BP’s
Russian venture TNK-BP to develop
massive Kovykta gas field.
One report said the long chess
match over Kovykta appeared to
be entering its end game when a
Siberian court claimed it hadn’t the
jurisdiction to hear a suit from TNKBP challenging regulators’ claims
that it was not producing enough gas
from the field.
As a result, Russia’s natural resources ministry said it would “very
likely” discuss whether to revoke the
company’s license.

Rocket science?
What does that really mean? Well,
it doesn’t take rocket science to understand that the move would create
the need for a new tender for the
field. Nor, given the kinds of money
now being paid for natural gas, is it
any surprise that a new tender would
be won by Gazprom, Russia’s statecontrolled natural gas monopoly.
Indeed, a number of observers
see the attack on Kovykta as part of
a broader move to return Russia’s oil
and gas deposits to state control.
The Russian government is no
stranger to such moves, nor should
anyone else find them surprising. In
April this year, Gazprom completed
its takeover of Royal Dutch Shell
PLC’s Sakhalin-2 oil and gas venture
32

in a deal that leaves the state-controlled gas giant with one share more
than a 50% stake in the project.
The Sakhalin-2 settlement came
after a bruising government campaign targeting the formerly Shellrun project for alleged ecological
violations on the far eastern island.
Shell caved in to government pressure
last November when it agreed to cede
control to Gazprom for $7.45 billion.

Uncertain supplies
Under the deal, Shell is to hold
a 27.5% stake in Sakhalin Energy,
which runs the project, while Japan’s
Mitsui and Mitsubishi will hold a
12.5% stake and a 10% stake respectively. Regardless of stakes, though,
the deal left the Japanese owners—as
well as their government—uncertain about the security of their gas
supplies. In Europe last week, similar
concerns were voiced over plans approved by the Russian government
for an oil pipeline that could enable
the country to bypass Belarus and
tighten Moscow’s grip over much of
the EU’s energy supplies.
Analysts said the new spur could
eventually end shipments through the
Druzhba, or Friendship, pipeline via
Belarus to Poland, Hungary, Slovakia,
the Czech Republic, and Germany.
Would the Russians use such a
stranglehold?
“Russian diplomacy is quite
strong, quite experienced, and they
are trying to divide us. That’s obvious,” said Gediminas Kirkilas, prime
minister of Lithuania. His experience
speaks volumes: Russia has halted
shipments of crude oil to Lithuania’s
Butinge terminal for the past 10
months. ✦

the US Pipeline Safety and Hazardous
Materials Administration (PSHMA);
and Jonne Slemons, coordinator of the
Petroleum Systems Integrity Systems
Office (PSISO) in Alaska’s oil and gas
division—said BP’s new Alaska team has
been much more cooperative.
Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), the Energy
and Commerce Committee’s chief
minority member, was more skeptical. “Everything that’s in these documents suggests that BP is trying to do
the right thing in public while fighting
like a tiger in private. These folks who
represent state and federal regulatory
authorities can do their jobs to the extent of the law, but we’re just rearranging deck chairs if BP refuses to change
its attitude,” he said.
As he examined BP America’s operations soon after taking the helm,
Malone said, “The most striking thing
to me was that we didn’t have rigorous
process safety management embedded
in our culture. It will take years to do
this. But as I’ve traveled to Texas City
and Alaska, I’ve been impressed with
the teams’ commitments to getting the
job done.”

Regulators’ actions
In response to the 2006 Prudhoe Bay
oil-gathering lines’ leaks and shutdowns, Alaska established PSISO as the
lead state oversight agency for oil and
gas facilities and as coordinator with
federal entities, said Slemons. PSISO is
conducting a regulatory gas analysis to
avoid duplication of efforts while trying
to close gaps, and is requiring well operators to implement quality assurance
programs, she told the subcommittee.
“Alaska is the only state in the country to require industry to allow regulator access to operator facilities in order
to ensure compliance with their own
maintenance programs. We look forward to breaking this new ground and
to cooperative efforts with our federal
partners,” she said.
Gerard said in response to the
federal Pipeline Safety Act reauthorization—passed by the 109th Congress in
December—PHMSA is proceeding with

rulemakings that include extending full
regulatory protection to low-pressure
pipelines such as the BP ANS oil-gathering systems. The US Department of
Transportation agency also is improving
its coordination with Alaska’s regulators, she said.
“We also have progress to report
concerning our oversight of BP Alaska.
Based on our ongoing monitoring of
its activities and pipeline inspection
results, we have increasing confidence
in engineering, operations, and maintenance of the existing transit lines. BP
Alaska also has begun to replace the
Prudhoe Bay transit lines and is beginning to address management problems
that contributed to the failures they
experienced last summer,” she said.
Of the 16 miles of Prudhoe Bay oil
transit lines that BP intends to replace

by the end of 2008, Malone said, 8
miles were completed by the end of
April after more than 600 workers
worked through the winter without a
lost-time injury. The new system will
use insulated carbon steel with a special
epoxy external coating and will have
a new above-ground vertical support
structure, permanent pigging facilities,
and a highly sensitive leak detection
system, he said.
Fairfax said OSHA imposed a $21
million penalty, the largest in its history,
against BP Products following the Texas
City explosion and fire. It also issued an
enhanced enforcement alert to its regional offices and state partners, began
inspections of the company’s four other
US refineries, and fined BP Products
another $2.4 million based on 32 violations, he said.

OSHA program launched
“As a result of the Texas City accident, OSHA began evaluating its data on
facilities and catastrophes and determined that refineries experienced more
of these problems than the next three
industry sectors combined. Accordingly,
OSHA is preparing to launch a National
Emphasis Program (NEP) for petroleum
refineries focusing on the Process Safety
Management standard,” he said.
The federal workplace safety agency
plans to conduct enforcement inspections at all 81 refineries under its jurisdiction by the end of 2008 and to encourage its state partners to implement
its NEP or create their own emphasis
programs, Fairfax said.
Subcommittee member Gene Green
(D-Tex.) suggested that federal safety
requirements need to be extended to

contractors and their employees. Earlier
this year he introduced HR 141, which
would require companies to report
contractor employees’ injuries and
deaths to OSHA in the same way they
report injuries and deaths of their own
employees.
Green said when he was visiting
another company’s refinery following
the Texas City blast and fire, he noticed
several contractors’ temporary structures still were close to process units
(a situation that contributed to the
deaths and injuries at the BP Products
refinery). When Green asked officials of
the other company why, he said, they

responded, “We haven’t got around to
moving them yet.”
Green said, “Unfortunately, I do not
believe all the lessons learned either
from the leaks on the North Slope or
the accident at Texas City have been
applied yet. Incidents such as the ones
we’re discussing today breed more public mistrust of the industry and suggest
a disregard by some companies for the
safety of their workers.”
Stupak told reporters following the
hearing that he thought Malone was
as forthright as he could be, considering he’s running a multibillion dollar
operation. But he also suggested that

a cost-cutting culture still pervades BP
America.
“You don’t change that quickly. There
are several layers between workers in
the field and [Malone], and I’m certain
it will take time for them to grow
confident that they can bring safety
matters which could cost money to the
company’s attention,” the subcommittee chairman said.
Stupak also said he believes the subcommittee will need to hold another
hearing on BP’s ANS oil-gathering lines
within the next 6 months. ✦

Government, industry prepare for 2007 hurricane season
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
New procedures are being implemented to better protect Gulf of Mexico
oil and gas operations during the coming hurricane season, federal government and industry officials said.
Measures range from requiring all
structures to have global positioning
systems to restricting operations of mobile offshore drilling units that have not
been brought up to new standards, they
told reporters during a May 30 briefing
at the US Dept. of the Interior.
“We’re preparing for a very, very
active hurricane season,” said Walter D.
Cruickshank, deputy director of the US
Minerals Management Service. He noted
that a week earlier, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration forecast 13-17 named storms during the
Atlantic hurricane season, with 7-10
of those becoming hurricanes and 3-5

hurricanes reaching Category 3 strength
or higher.
MMS is implementing seven operational enhancements to further
clarify special engineering practices and
reporting procedures on all offshore
structures from mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) and jack ups to
existing and new fixed platforms, said
Cruickshank. On June 1, the hurricane
season’s opening day, the DOI division also will activate a new hurricane
information website with current storm
information and updated production
and evacuation information, he said.
Simultaneously, the American Petroleum Institute has published three
interim documents that apply the latest
understanding of environmental conditions in and around the gulf to better
protect offshore facilities from hurricanes, API Pres. Red Cavaney said.

‘Metocean’ impacts
Hurricanes Ivan in 2004 and Katrina
and Rita in 2005 produced higher
waves and stronger winds than anticipated in deeper areas, moving the
industry away from viewing the gulf as
a uniform body of water, he explained.
Recognizing a central portion, the
“metocean,” as a gathering spot for water currents that can strengthen storms

led API to reassess applicable recommended practices, Cavaney said.
API published three interim documents for the 2006 hurricane season
covering operation and construction
of both MODUs and fixed and floating production platforms. The interim documents announced on May
30—dealing with hurricane condition
data, offshore structure design, and
assessment of existing offshore structures—are expected to become final
recommended practices in 2008.
“Meanwhile, our companies are
refining and distributing fuel at record
levels after recovering from damage
sustained during the 2004-05 hurricanes. For 2007, refiners and marketers
continue to work with authorities to
clarify priorities for power restoration
critical to restarting operations and,
where possible, to provide emergency
power generation to avoid significant
disruption to fuel delivery and distribution,” Cavaney said.
The GPS requirement is one of several steps that will improve tracking of
equipment and evacuation of employees, noted Rear Adm. Wayne Justice,
enforcement and incident management
director at the US Coast Guard. “Assuring that two agencies can communicate,
even if one has to move to another locaOil & Gas Journal / June 4, 2007

tion, is critical. We have shown we can
do that,” he said.
Cruickshank said that after the 2005
hurricanes forced MMS to temporarily relocate its Gulf Coast headquarters
to Houston from New Orleans, its five
offices in the region now have independent communications systems so
they can still function if one has to shut
down during an emergency.
“New practices have suggested that
MODU operators increase the number
of mooring lines from 8 to 12,” he said.
MMS has issued notices to operators in
the gulf providing guidance for meeting new requirements, which includes
following API’s recommended practices,
he said.

including onsite backup electric power
generation capability, improving communications systems to support continued operations, and working with
vendors to preposition food, water, and
transportation, and plan for other emergency supplies and services.”

“We think that with the improvements that have been made to new and
existing facilities that they’d be able
to better withstand what they had to
endure in 2005,” said Cruickshank, “although it’s never smart to second-guess
Mother Nature,” he added. ✦

able to operate in parts of the gulf during hurricane season because they don’t
have new equipment. Up to 20% of the
existing MODU fleet could be affected.”
New standards primarily involve
top-side equipment because subsurface
systems came through the 2005 hurricanes with relatively minor damage,
he told reporters following the briefing.
The Mars platform experienced problems when wind tore a derrick loose
and sent it into the water, creating a
cascade that jarred the entire structure,
he said.
Platforms now are being designed
so decks are about 25 ft higher at
75 ft above the surface, Danenberger
said. Older platforms still are likely to
survive, based on their performances
during the 2005 hurricanes, but the
newer ones are being built to sustain
less top-side damage, he said.
Offshore pipelines have developed
alternative routes since the two Category 5 storms, while some platforms
have built systems that make it easier to
unload stored crude onto barges, added
MMS Associate Director Chris Oynes.

Introduction
For more than a billion years, the
western Canadian portion of the North
American continent was a receptacle of
sediments (Fig. 1). The WCSB is one of
the world’s most prolific hydrocarbon
basins.
Sediments mainly were sourced from
the east (Fig. 2) by erosion of igneous-metamorphic basement rocks of
the Canadian Shield. Sediments include
Precambrian to Cambrian mainly si38

liciclastics (>3 miles thick) overlain by
Cambro-Ordovician to MississippianPermian carbonates and shale (2 miles
thick) and Triassic siliciclastics and
carbonates (0.5 mile).
A second sediment source area
emerged with massive structural upheaval in the W in post-Triassic time. A
large foreign body slammed into and
overrode the western Canadian Shield.
From then onward, the WCSB received
sediments from E, S, and W. Post-Trias-

sic strata (3 miles
thick) include
thick sections
of Cretaceous
siliciclastics with
abundant Barnettlike shale-siltstone
and coal seams,
representing an
untapped major
gas resource play.
The WCSB
sedimentary
section contains
many basinwide
unconformities,
reflecting periods
of worldwide
tectonic upheaval.
Its western reaches
were deformed
into a structured
belt by the Nevadan, Sevier, and

Laramide orogenies.
In British Columbia, the Rocky
Mountain Trench stretches from the
US border to the Yukon. It separates a
region formed primarily of plutonic,
volcanic, and metamorphic rocks
(allochthon) intruded by numerous
Cretaceous granites in the W from the
Laramide Rocky Mountains and Foothills comprised of folded and faulted
sedimentary rocks (structured belt of
the WCSB) in the E.
The structured belt (Fig. 3) encompasses the Rocky Mountains, Foothills,
and the western structured portion of
the Plains of western Alberta and Northeast British Colombia. It covers more
than 100,000 sq miles and extends more
than 1,000 miles in a northwesterly direction with a width of 100 miles from
the Alberta/Montana border in the S to
the line between British Columbia and
the Yukon Territory in the N.
This region is bordered in the E by
the “undisturbed” Plains sedimentary
section (Precambrian to Tertiary) that
extends E to igneous and metamorphic
outcrops of the Canadian Shield. To the
W, it is bordered by the Rocky Mountain Trench.

Special Report

Commonly, it is mistakenly assumed that subduction created the
structured belt of the WCSB. Instead, it
was a N-moving elongated land mass
(allochthon, Fig. 4) an estimated 300
miles wide, 2,000 miles long, and 2030 miles thick that collided with and
slid onto the W portion of the massive
Canadian Shield, core of the North
American continent. It includes most of
British Columbia and moved parallel to
its NW-SE long axis, guided by ancient
subsurface oceanic crustal features.
Any structured belt associated with
subduction and passive continental
margin was overridden by this N-moving continental rock body. It scraped
over the shield like a massive rock
plough. It ploughed E the sedimentary
section of the WCSB.
A series of massive composite thrusts
developed. The oldest ones are in the W
and the youngest in the E. Each of these
acted as a rock plough pushing the
sedimentary section ever farther E. This
assessment is based on regional seismic
transects, surface geology, and well data.
Six exploration/structural domains are recognized. Structures were
formed by simultaneously acting
major compression/thrusting, gravity sliding, and transpression/shear
force fields. The shield, composed of
rigid igneous and metamorphic rock,
resisted deformation.
At a depth of >5 miles (overburden
pressure >30,000 lb/sq in.), it deformed plastically (Fig. 5). At shallower
depths, deformation was brittle and the
shield eventually broke in numerous
parallel, generally vertical, mainly N-S
and NW-SE, and minor NE-SW and EW striking strike-slip fault blocks.
Predominant right-hand lateral
movements along these faults sheared
the basement many kilometers to the
N and shortened it E-W. The pliable
sedimentary cover, resting on this basement, sheared sideways to the NW in
places along up to six subhorizontal layers separated by detachment zones.
While being deformed by shear, it
simultaneously was horizontally shortened up to 100 miles by E-directed

compression (thrusting and gravity
sliding) in the form of enormous rock
ploughs. NE and W-E shear and strikeslip zones developed within the rocks
pushed by the rock ploughs.
In this dynamic setting, the section
structurally thickened vertically, over
large areas. While all this deformation
was proceeding, sediments continued

to accumulate in the WCSB, but now
derived from two provenances: one in
the E and a second, new one, in the W
(Fig. 2).
The moving landmass formed very
high topographic elevations in the W.
It compound thrusted the sedimentary
section to great heights, and it pushed
the younger, less-compacted sections

the velocity (11,000 fps) of the same
shale sections in the undisturbed Plains
to the E.
The sedimentary section is in a state
of “overcompaction.” It has not had
sufficient time to structurally relax and
decompact in places, giving rise to local
overpressure zones. These anomalously
high seismic velocities and complex
structures make seismic processing and
interpretation most difficult tasks.
The regional topography once
included towering mountains, which
were almost leveled by four major periods of glaciations, in the past 2 million
years.
The structural trend of the structured
belt from S to N changes several times
from NW to N and even from N to NE.
These changes take place at hinge lines
of unknown origin (Figs. 6 and 7).

Oil and gas
To date, only the E portion of the
vast structured belt is explored.
A rewarding 41 tcf of gas in place
and 1.3 billion bbl of oil in place were
discovered in 169+ fields and pools
since 1913 (Table 1). These discoveries
followed an oil find in 1859 at Stoney
Creek, NB, and gas finds at Medicine
Hat, southeastern Alta., in the 1890s.
Many discovered fields include
more than one structure: Sukunka field
includes the discoveries of seven gas
accumulations in series of shingled,
independent, parallel anticlines.
Industry discovered four fields in
1910-51 (1/10 years), 47 fields in
1951-63 (4/year), went without a
discovery in 1963-67, found 52 fields
in 1967-81 (3.5/year), two fields in
1981-89 (1/4 years), and 20 fields in
1980-2007 (1.2/year).
Fields were discovered by Shell (12),
Gulf (5), Imperial Oil (5), Phillips

Bay (4), Pacific Petroleum (3), Oakwood
Petroleum (3), Sun Oil (2), Sinclair

If you are a Offshore
equipment manager, Ship
owner or Infrastructure
maintenance manager,
METALIZING will
eliminate corrosion on
the steel covered for
20-30 years and minimize
further maintenance.

Corrosion must be dealt with
by any owner of equipment
made of steel and particularly
those exposed in the marine
environment. In the past, various
paint systems have been used all
requiring follow up maintenance
with eventual complete recoating
for equipment in long term use
i.e.15-30 years. Views promoted
by paint manufacturers of the life
cycle of a coating vary, but no
existing paint system will protect
a steel structure exposed to a
harsh marine environment for
periods in excess of 10 years.
Metalizing has a proven track
record of protecting structures
and vessels for over 80 years of
exposure to the environment.

Metalizing is a process that has been available for
many years but the application equipment was not
well suited for covering large areas in a reasonable time
frame. Now new equipment can spray up to 1200
ft2/hr per hour under the right conditions. Metalizing
can now be applied at the same speed as paint, with up
to 400 microns thickness in an application, requires no
curing time and additionally provides tough abrasion
protection. Metalizing is essentially putting down a
protective, sacrificial layer of metal over a steel
substrate by spraying, typically aluminum or zinc.
Other metals such as copper, stainless steel,
Aluminum-Zinc alloys, inconel and any other metals
that can be drawn into wire form, can also be sprayed,
depending upon the particular requirement. This
process ELIMINATES CORROSION on the steel
covered and lasts 20-30 years. Constant labor and
time traditionally used maintaining painted surfaces
are eliminated.
FROM A FINANCIAL VIEWPOINT of an owner,
the long term financial benefits are that equipment life
is extended and maintenance costs including labor are
reduced with less downtime on the equipment. In the
short term viewpoint equipment that is not affected by
corrosion will command a higher secondhand value as
it will not require current or future paint application
and therefore the owner captures long term value in
the resale price. The question is CAN YOU AFFORD
NOT TO LOOK INTO THIS ALTERNATIVE ?
Current examples of recent projects include 2 dry
cargo vessel decks of approximately 62,000 ft/2, a
vehicle bridge of 400 ft length, Pipe spools for Chevron,
Exxon Mobil, refinery works for Texas Gas
and Kellog Brown & Root. Hatch covers and holds on
bulkers, decks on all types of ships, storage tanks,
hulls, flare booms, steam pipes, crane booms and other
offshore rig structures are suitable for this process.

Recently, gas discoveries (each rumored >0.5 tcf in place) were made in
Permian carbonate reservoirs overlain
by shale in asymmetric folds (Monkman by Talisman), in a fractured Leduc
reservoir with more than 400 ft of net
pay (Tay River by Shell Canada), and
in Cambrian/older strata (Talisman).
Clearly, this demonstrates the “Foothills” is a viable, exciting, and rewarding exploration region!
The common play is structural
with stratigraphic components such
as fractured carbonate, reefs, platform
margins, and pinnacles. As a rule, reservoir quality is enhanced by geother-

80

high temperature conditions (pressures
>15,000 psi and temperatures >300°
F.) prevail. To date, drilling depths
have not exceeded 20,000 ft. The plays
become costlier with deeper drilling,
3D, and 3C-3D seismic acquisition, and
construction of roads, leases, tie-ins,
and pipelines.
Difficulty of access and increasing
distances to infrastructure add to the
costs. Development of less costly shallower resource plays may be favored
over expensive deep target drilling in
the near future.
Despite the 2005 increase in natural
gas price, drilling in the “Foothills” has
not picked up as it has in other regions
of the WCSB. Risk adversity, long lead
times, quarterly reporting to financial
markets, and dry hole and F&D costs
affecting the financial “bottom line” are
viewed as possible causes. Others might
include inadequacy of 3D seismic
acquisition and processing to properly
define deeper structures. Recent downturns in gas prices will probably slow
exploration in the region.

Oil industry management accepted a
model of simplicity: “Compression
from the W resulted in thrusting to the
E.” The reality is a tad more complex.
Currently, most shallow exploration
targets (<10,000 ft), excluding resource plays, are drilled in the belt. The
trend is to drill deeper targets. Unfortunately, seismic energy decreases with
depth and reduces the definition of
such targets. Consequently, acquisition
of deep data, processing, and imaging
and interpretation thereof are a challenge.
Commonly, structural geologists are
not included in this process until the last
minute. No wonder the end results often
represent wide gaps between the real
structures and those based on interpretations of iterated isotropic abstract mathematical treatises of raw seismic data.
Cases in point, deep structures with
limbs that dip more than 20° are difficult or impossible to image. Thus,
seismic interpretations become unreal-

istic to bizarre. In most cases, interpreters through recognition and mapping
of impedance surfaces create geometric
form (structure) maps, also called “wet
blanket” maps. These maps show structural highs connected by contouring
that ignores overthrusted portions of
the structures.
A further problem is posed by the
many active “structural” seismologists,
who worked in a structured belt but
had no formal structural geological
training. Thus, they lack understanding
of how structures are formed and what
is plausible and what is not in their interpretations. Besides, not being aware
of certain structural forms probably
precludes mapping thereof.
Once a deep structure is identified,
a structural geologist should complete
mechanical and kinematic analyses of
that structure. This is to determine the
forces (stress) that formed the structures’ geometry and the history of their
development. It also aims to understand
the genesis of strain (fractures) in the
region.
Combined, it leads to an understanding of 3D stress and strain through
time. Investigations normally should
include studies of surface structures,
subsurface data, including cores, well
cuttings, and logs, and the review of
analog structures. Unfortunately, such
analyses are seldom performed as an essential part of team work leading up to
budget requests and eventual drilling.
It is said, it all comes down to luck,
geosteering, FMI logs (bedding and
fracture dip readings) and integration
with seismic data. Dipmeter interpretations work well in structured regions
where deformation is not too complex
and uniform. This is not the case in the
subject structured belt, where structural
complexity reigns: simultaneous thrusting and strike-slip faulting.
FMI logs show the presence of
fractures (open, closed, and healed)
with microresistivity measurements.
Openings vary from a half-inch to 1
micron (about 1⁄2,500 in.). In laboratories,
it is demonstrated that micron fractures
might add 2% to 10% porosity (gas

storage) to a deformed rock body. A
⁄25 in. open fracture is represented by
a 4-in. wide dark band on a 1:1 scale
FMI log. This is a ratio of 1 to 100. This
means that a 1 micron fracture should
be represented by 100 x 1⁄25,000 in. = 1⁄250
in. dark band on a 1:1 scale FMI log,
beyond the image resolution of that log.
How wide should an open fracture be
before it is visible on an FMI log?
Most evaluation engineers admit
the contribution of fractures to both
reservoir storage and producibility is
not fully understood, especially not in
not-so-obvious structural settings.
Another difficult problem faced by
seismologists is that unless the rock
body is entirely homogeneous from
a seismic velocity point of view, it is
practically impossible to mathematically precisely position a vertical well
or a directional well in either 2D or 3D
seismic surveys. Well synthetics might
be positioned and stretched to fit the
processed data, but it will always remain an inexact solution to an unsolvable problem.

Shell Canada drilled
a well using managed
pressure drilling (MPD)
and an unweighted fluid
system to improve drillDrilling
ing rate of penetration
in the Bullmoose area,
northeastern British Columbia.
Operators working in this area
identified the Nikanassin as a very hard,
slow drilling formation, which increases drilling time and costs. The Nikanassin is hard and abrasive and ranges from
1,000 m to 1,800 m thick. Elevated
mud weights are sometimes required
to deal with high-pressure nuisance gas
or water flows, which further impedes
drilling performance.
Various mud systems and bits were
used in offset wells, resulting in average
rates of penetration of 1.4-2.4 m/hr.
Based on a presentation to the IADC/SPE Managed Pressure Drilling and Underbalanced Operations Conference, Mar. 28-29, 2007, Galveston,
Tex.

O D U C T I O N

Implementing an MPD program allowed Shell to use an unweighted, flocculated water fluid system, which increased average ROP to 4.0 m/hr. When
compared with low-fluid-loss mud
systems, such as invert, the improvement in ROP was notable and resulted
in considerable time and cost savings.
MPD is typically considered a tool
to mitigate drilling hazards and reduce nonproductive time
from lost-circulation zones,
tight margins between pore
pressure and fracture gradient, and high-pressure,
low-volume, nuisance gas
zones. MPD can also be used
to increase ROP when air
drilling and underbalanced drilling are
unsuitable because of borehole instability, water flows, coal seams, or environmental concerns such as flaring gas.
As with any advanced drilling
technique, successful application of
MPD technology requires a detailed
understanding of the potential benefits

enhancements being considered for future use of MPD in the Bullmoose area.

Nikanassin is a Jurassic formation
consisting of interbedded marine sandstones and shales with the occasional
coal seam (Fig. 1). The sandstones consist of fine-grained quartzite and chert.
The base of the Nikanassin is about
125 m (TVD) above the Pardonet and
Baldonnel formations (Fig. 2).
In Bullmoose field, Nikanassin can
vary from 1,000 to 1,800 m thick
(TVD), and multiple tricone bits are
required to drill the interval. Sand and
shale sequences make bit selection difficult. A bit that will drill a sand package
effectively will not necessarily perform
well in the shale sections.
Also, directional drilling is often required to position the wellbore for the
horizontal through the Pardonet and
Baldonnel formations. Steering to align
the well path properly for the horizontal section further reduces ROP, diminishes bit life, and increases the borehole
length through the Nikanassin.
Finally, shallow water flows and
overpressures are prevalent in Bullmoose field. The increased mud density necessary to control the inflows
degrades drilling performance.

2001, Shell Canada has participated in
four exploration wells and one development well in this area. The primary
hydrocarbon objectives are the Pardonet
and Baldonnel formations, Triassic
limestones and dolostones. To maximize
production, the current well design
involves drilling 500-1,500 m horizontals through these formations in order
to intercept fractures and porosity.
Predominant drilling hazards include
the hard and abrasive rock, steeply dipping and faulted formations, nuisance
gas, water flows, and coal seams. Although each drilling risk poses its own
unique challenges, the most consistent
and costly problem is the hard rock encountered in the Nikanassin formation.

gel chemical mud.
Air drilling has been successful at increasing ROP through the Nikanassin in
vertical drilling applications. Mountainous topography, however, which limits
location positioning, and the requirement for horizontal well paths through
the reservoir often result in deviated trajectories with borehole inclinations beyond 20o. Furthermore, aquifers within
the area increase the risk of watering-out
and coal seams can create hole instability.
These constraints prohibit the use of air
drilling in many wells.
Invert oil-based mud has been used
through the Nikanassin but with limited success. Generally, invert is used not
for its inhibitive properties, but rather
for its low density. Offset information
indicates that the density of oil-based

mud must be close to 900 kg/cu m and
have minimal fluid loss control before
significant ROP increases are realized.
Fig. 3 demonstrates the effect of
invert mud weight on ROP in the
Nikanassin. In most cases, however, uphole water flows, nuisance gas, and coal
gas often require fluid density to be
increased, eliminating the low-density
advantage of the invert mud system.
Gel chemical water-based mud is
the most common fluid system in the
Bullmoose area. It is a low-cost system
and ROPs are slightly higher when
compared with weighted, invert oilbased mud.

and improve overall project economics, Shell Canada wanted to drill the
Nikanassin more efficiently in the Shell
Bullmoose d-A80-A/93-P-3 well.
To better understand the rock properties of the Nikanassin, Shell Canada’s
drilling and geological staff made a field
trip to the Bullmoose area to collect Nikanassin samples. Ten rock samples were
acquired from two different mapped
outcrops. Geological analysis verified
the composition, hardness, and abrasiveness of the rock.
There was a lot of offset control for
this project; a Kerr-McGee well was
drilled in 1973, less than 100 m from
Shell’s proposed location. Several options were investigated, and managed
pressure drilling with a flocculated
water system was selected as most likely
to succeed.
While drilling the Nikanassin formation, Kerr-McGee conducted a drillstem
test (DST). The DST was taken from
1,455 m to 1,552 m and results indicated potential for gas flow upwards
of 1.05 MMscfd. Because the DST was
taken over an extended interval (97 m),
an exact pore pressure gradient could
not be determined. Using the two shutin pressures recorded during the DST,
operators produced a graph (Fig. 4) to
estimate the pressure gradient of the
Nikanassin gas.
Based on the information supplied
by the DST, the expected mud weight
would fall between 935 kg/cu m and
1,047 kg/cu m. This mud weight range
could be achieved with an invert OBM

mud system; however, offset data (Fig.
3) suggests that ROPs would likely
range between 1.5 m/hr and 2.5 m/hr
because of the low fluid loss nature
of the invert and its potentially higher
solids content.
The data also demonstrate that there
is a 35% probability that the pore
pressure could exceed 1,000 kg/cu m,
which could be problematic if a fresh
water fluid system were used. Although
hydraulic models predict that ECDs and
annular cuttings would likely increase
bottomhole density to about 1,020
kg/cu while drilling with a fresh water,
it is important to note that the Kerr-McGee well drilled through the Nikanassin
with mud densities ranging from 1,048
kg/cu m to 1,084 kg/cu m. These mud
densities could mask possible overpressures in other sections of the Nikanassin.
Offset data indicate that elevated
mud weights and low ROPs can be
expected if either invert or gelled mud
were used to drill the 1,840-m thick
Nikanassin section at the planned
Bullmoose well. Therefore, a flocculated
water system combined with MPD was
desired because of the potential ROP
benefits and pressure management capabilities. Both systems offer advantages
(Fig. 5).

BENEFICIAL DRILLING TECHNOLOGIES

Fig. 5

Flocculated water system advantages:
• Inexpensive to mobilize and maintain compared to invert or gel chemical systems.
• High ﬂuid loss properties result in fast pressure equalization, minimizing chip hold down effects.
Data suggest that lower ﬂuid loss muds such as invert and gels impede penetration rate in
Bullmoose ﬁeld.
• Low solids content could enhance ROPs.
• A high quality ﬁlter cake is not required in the Nikanassin because of the rock’s hardness and relative
stability.
• Swelling clays and quickly reactive shales are not known to be present in the Bullmoose Nikanassin.
MPD system advantages:
• The actual pressure regime in the offset Kerr-McGee well was unknown, and could be higher than
water gradient.
• An economic analysis predicted that an average ROP of 2.6 m/hr would be required with fresh water
to offset the additional costs of the MPD package. This assumes an ROP of 2.0 m/hr with an invert
or gel system through the entire 1,840-m interval.
• If the overpressures are not encountered, the data can be applied to future wells in the area and the
amount of MPD equipment can be minimized, or eliminated altogether.
• If the overpressures are encountered, surface hole mud can be stored and used to kill the well on
trips. This would eliminate the need to trip using the rotating head, which can be time consuming.

MPD operations planning
Considerable upfront planning was
required to ensure a successful application of the technology. After a risk
assessment, the equipment was selected
and operations designed and reviewed
to ensure meeting all of the project’s
key performance indicators.
Based on the risk assessment, the primary components of the MPD package
were chosen. Fig. 6 shows the on site
equipment. Weatherford provided an IP
1000 RCD, which has a working pressure rating of 6,900 kPa (1,000 psi),
and a static pressure rating of 10,350
kPa (1,500 psi). The RCD was nippled
up on a BOP with three rams (dual pipe
rams, dual choke lines, and one blind
ram), with annular returns directed
through dual manual choke manifold

Managed pressure drilling equipment at the Nikanassin wellsite included a Weatherford IIP 1000 rotating control device (RCD; Fig. 6)
and sample catchers. Returns were then
sent to the horizontal separator.
The rig choke was connected to
the second inlet of the MPD choke
manifold so that well control operations
could be conducted through either the
rig’s degasser or Weatherford’s separation package. From the separation
package, drilling mud and solids are
pumped back to the rig’s shaker and

These photos were taken after drilling the Nikanassin section. In Fig. 8a, the bit drilled from 1,356 m to 1,683 m through the Nikanassin and was graded as
6-6-FC-A-E-3-FC-HR. In Fig. 8b, the bit drilled from 1,683 m to 1,895 m and was graded as 8-8-SD-A-F-30-CC-PR (Fig. 8).
well required 30.8 days on bottom to
drill 1,052 m of Nikanassin.
Normalizing these values to
days/100 m, the well drilled with
flocculated water and MPD techniques
required 1.05 days/100 m to drill,
while the previous well required 2.93
days/100 m, a 179% improvement.
Offset wells, drilled with gel-chem and
invert systems required about 2.1-2.5
days/100 m. Table 1 shows bit performance for offset wells.
The second bit run in the Nikanassin set a field record, drilling 327 m in
82.75 hr, and resulting in an average
ROP of 3.95 m/hr. The driller used a
Hughes Christensen HR-S55 bit, which
has an IADC rating of 6-3-7. When
pulled, the bit’s grading was 6-6-FC-AE-3-FC-HRS.
Damage to bits was similar to previous wells drilled in Bullmoose field.
Drilling through the abrasive sands
often resulted in gauge wear, and gauge
row inserts were usually chipped or
completely worn off the bit. Figs. 8a
and 8b show examples of typical bit
wear through the Nikanassin.
Average bit life was also reduced
compared to wells drilled with an invert
52

or gel chemical system. The average bit
life drilling with water was 45.9 hr/bit,
whereas the offsets that drilled with
invert oil based fluid averaged 53.6 hr/
bit. This reduction in bit life is possibly
due to the decreased lubricity of water.

Flocculated water performance
To flocculate the water system, a
mixture of calcium nitrate, lime, and
dispersible polyacrylamide (Alkapam
1103) was used. The calcium nitrate
and lime provided the calcium source
and the polyacrylamide flocculated the
solid particles. When the fluid returned
to the mud tanks after passing over the
shakers, the solids would settle to the
bottom of cone tanks.
Because a water system has limited
viscosity, hole cleaning was done using
pump rates and annular velocity. Bentonite-based gel sweeps were pumped
to remove cuttings that settled out in
the borehole.
The results at Bullmoose d-A80A/93-P-3 indicate that the high fluid
loss and low solids content of the
water system had a significant effect
on drilling rates.
After the fluid system was displaced

from flocculated water to invert oil
based mud, two bit runs were required
to finish drilling the Nikanassin.
The average ROP of the bit runs
with flocculated water was 4.51 m/hr
compared to 2.12 m/hr average with
the 965-990 kg/cu m invert mud. The
ROPs with an invert fluid are consistent with offset well data. Clearly, mud
weights were not the predominant factor that increased the ROPs.

Results
MPD operations were executed
successfully on the Bullmoose well as
a result of extensive prejob planning
involving the operator, the MPD service
provider, and the drilling contractor.
The planning resulted in a job that met
all the short-term key performance
indicators, including drilling with
increased ROP compared to the offset
wells, reducing the overall well costs,
and completing the MPD operation
without any HSE incidents.
Compared to the previously drilled

than 40% for the interval.
Increased ROP on this well is primarily attributable to the use of the flocculated water drilling system. Displacing
to an invert mud system for the last two
bit runs of the operation resulted in the
same reduced ROPs as the offset wells.
MPD was chosen based on a probabilistic analysis during the planning
phase to determine the potential for
encountering above-hydrostatic formation pressures. Although the expected
high-pressure, low volume gas zones
were not encountered, the MPD system
was an enabler and was seen as a tool to
manage pore pressure uncertainty.
If the high-pressure zones had been
encountered, the MPD package would
have been used to continue drilling
while depleting any gas, allowing for
drilling to continue with water.

The study obtained measurements
on the pumping wells with a portable
computerized system, including the
required hardware and software components, that was specifically developed
for testing and analyzing sucker-rod
pumped oil wells.
A complete analysis of a rodpumped installation with the portable
equipment involves several phases and
requires the adherence to specific procedures. Each phase can be conducted
independently but proper and complete
well analysis usually has the following
steps:
• Without stopping the operation
of the pumping unit, find the dynamic
liquid level in the annulus with an
acoustic device.
• After the casing valve is closed,
measure the pressure buildup vs. time at
the casinghead to determine the well’s
gas production rate.
• Conduct a dynamometer survey
to measure the polished-rod loads and
movements for several pumping cycles.

• Measure the electric power used to

Measured data evaluation
The study processed most measured
data online with a portable analyzer
system at the wellsite and stored appropriate parameters and diagrams in
computer files. In addition to the factors
calculated by the software, the study
evaluated other operational parameters
for each well. The following describes
the parameters not readily available and
those requiring additional explanation.
The study based well inflow calculations on the dynamic fluid level. After
calculating the FBHP (flowing bottomhole pressure), the study had two
options available for finding the well’s
inflow performance:
1. Use the constant PI (productivity
index) principle.
2. Use the Vogel IPR (inflow performance relationship) curve.
For the majority of the cases, the
study used the PI principle because
no free gas entered the wells from the
perforations.
Other parameters included:
• Surface system loadings expressed
as percentages of equipment ratings.
• Beam loading calculated as the
ratio of the measured PPRL (peak polished-rod load) to the pumping unit’s
structural load rating.
• Gearbox loading determined from
the ratio of the measured peak net
torque and the torque capacity of the
gearbox.
• Motor load expressed by the ratio
of the rms (root mean square) current taken by the electric motor to the
motor’s full-load current rating.
• Rod loading of the individual tapered portions of the string expressed
as the percentage of the maximum
allowed rod stress. The allowed stresses
were calculated from the modified
Goodman diagram, which is used

for evaluating the fatigue loading of
sucker-rod strings.
The analysis program calculates
the degree of counterbalancing of the
gearbox and recommends ways for
achieving optimum conditions. This
may involve moving or replacing counterweights on the unit’s cranks.
The results of the valve tests as well
as the shape and other parameters of
the calculated pump cards determined
the downhole pump conditions. In
some cases, usually for wells with older
production tests, the calculated pump
displacement varied substantially from
the latest measured liquid rate. In such
cases, to verify the measurement accuracy, the study calculated the pumping
rate with the API RP11L model.1
If the calculated liquid rate did not
agree with the analysis program output,
the study did not use the production
test data and recommended a new test.
Various publications define and
calculate power efficiency of suckerrod pumped installations in different
ways.2-4 This study defines power efficiency, in general, as the ratio of useful
and total input power to a system.
The useful power for the rod-pumping system is calculated from the

amount of liquid lifted and the lifting
depth, while the total electrical energy
input to the system is measured with
the portable analyzer. Thus, Equation 1
(see equation box) yields total system
efficiency.
The system’s total efficiency equals
the efficiencies of the downhole system
added to the efficiency of the surface
drive train. The latter includes the
pumping unit, gearbox, V-belt drive,
and electric motor. With the efficiencies to those two components assigned,
Equation 2 will express the system efficiency. Lifting efficiency represents the
efficiency of energy used and the losses
in the downhole system, which includes the downhole pump and the rod
string. Its value depends on the proper
selection by the production engineer
of the pumping mode, which includes
pump size, polished-rod stroke length,
and pumping speed.
Equation 3 calculates the lifting efficiency from the measured polished-rod
power (PRHP).
The surface efficiency, calculated
with Equation 4, includes all energy
losses in the drive train.
A comparison of the efficiencies

The optimization procedure, as discussed, finds the least amount of power
required at the polished rod. Because
total energy use of the pumping system
is directly related to polished-rod horsepower (PRHP), the optimization model
automatically finds the most energy-efficient pumping system.

it can be changed in a broad range
by modifying the pumping mode
while the well’s rate is unchanged.

To recover
valuable gases from the CCR net gas,
Saudi Aramco installed an LPG-recovery
unit that uses a technology unfamiliar
to the refiner.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

the two solvent circulation loops were
completed. The LT controlling flow
from the discharge of the absorber bottoms pump G-0109B was switched to
auto control.
With no gas flow through the absorber system, and after establishing
lean solvent circulation, the column
pressure started to decrease to about
122 psig from an initial pressure of
about 142 psig. This indicated slight absorption of hydrocarbons even at warm
solvent temperatures (98° F.).
To reestablish the pressure in the
column to the CCR net gas compressorsuction drum pressure without flowing
gas through the LPG-recovery unit, we
reopened the inlet isolation valve. The
isolation valve blocking flow from the
LPG absorber overhead to the fuelgas system remained closed. With the
circulating warm solvent, the pressure
increased and stabilized at about 139
psig.
When establishing the aforementioned two solvent circulation circuits,
we identified several level and flow

Operation of the integrated LPG-recovery facility is easy, stable, and flexible
to gas flow and composition changes.
If the refrigeration compressor accidentally trips, the LPG-recovery process
can continue to operate stably and await
restart of the refrigeration compressor.
Operation of the Yanbú refinery unit
has successfully demonstrated turn-

NIOC expects to produce 10 million
tonnes/year of LNG by 2010, using a
two-train plant fed by almost 1.94 bcfd
of natural gas from South Pars Phase 12.
NIOC divided the project into three
packages to facilitate efficient implementation and increase use of domestic
resources:
• Package I: Processing and condensation units, utility, offsite equipment,
and the top section of the quay.
• Package II: LPG and LNG storage

New emulsion breaker; feedstock treatment
New products for emulsion breaking
and feedstock treatment are on the market.
PetroLuxus 500 is a new aqueous
emulsion-breaking product for drilling,
production, refining, and storage.
It is a specially blended aqueous chemical solution developed for the treatment
of hydrocarbon emulsions. When introduced into an emulsion, PetroLuxus 500
disperses rapidly while eliminating the
interfacial surface tension between oil and
other materials such as water, metals, dirt,
sediments, and other contaminants.
The product works rapidly, usually
within several hours, to effect separation
of hydrocarbon emulsion components
resulting in a stratification of materials
by specific gravity. The company says that
stratification of the emulsion components
by specific gravity provides an efficient
method for the remediation and recovery of the components. PetroLuxus(TM)
500 is nonhazardous, nonflammable, and
biodegradable.

The product offers the opportunity to
recover hydrocarbons and reduce former
waste to nonhazardous, disposable, or salable materials.
PetroLuxus 500 can be utilized to
break emulsions at all phases of crude oil
production.
During the drilling phase it can be
utilized to remediate drilling fluidsmuds, tailings, and sludge pits. During
the operational phase the product can be
used to break emulsions at the wellhead,
reduce water and particulates, and decrease
viscosity in heavy oil. Emulsions created
in the refining phase can be broken to
maximize raw feedstock and processing
final product. Storage facilities can utilize
the product to clean and maintain tank
batteries.
Feedstock treatment. PetroLuxus 100
is a new treatment for biodiesel, heavy oil,
waste oil, and other raw fuel feedstocks.
The company says it is a cost effective,
time efficient solution for upgrading raw

fuel feedstocks before they enter the refining process or the treatment of finished
product that has accumulated particulates
and water during storage and transportation.
The specially blended treatment promises rapid dispersement that eliminates the
interfacial surface tension of the feedstocks
and other materials such as water, metals,
dirt, sediments, and other contaminants.
The product works rapidly, usually within
several hours, to separate the components,
resulting in a stratification of materials
by specific gravity. The stratification of
components provides a cleaner product for
refining, the firm points out. PetroLuxus
100 is nonhazardous, nonflammable, and
biodegradable.
It helps improve flow characteristics of
heavy oil, segregate water, paraffin, and
particulate matter, reduce acidity, reduce
sulfur content, and reduce overall pumping costs, the company says.

Congress follows
the Take That!
energy approach
Welcome to the Take That! approach to
energy legislation.
The strategy has one advantage. Politicians who apply it never have to learn anything about energy. In fact, the approach
works best when lawmakers and their
constituents stay wholly ignorant about the
subject.
Instead of creating effective and affordable solutions to real and complex

T h e

problems, the Take That! approach conjures
up villains to ﬂail. The drama and simplicity
especially appeal to children, young adolescents, and surprisingly many US politicians
of more advanced age.
The US Congress has implemented Take
That! energy legislation on several fronts
recently. A new House energy bill would repeal several provisions of the Energy Policy
Act of 2005 that tried to fortify US supplies
of oil and natural gas.
Take that, oil companies!
Another House bill would make vaguely
deﬁned “price-gouging” a criminal offense.
Take that, oil companies!
Lawmakers in a Joint Economic Committee hearing have discussed breaking up
major oil and gas companies.
Take that, oil companies!
Yet another House bill would enable the
US government to sue the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries for price
manipulation.
Take that, OPEC!
See how it works? Take That! energy legislation doesn’t address real problems. For
example, investigation after investigation
has found no price-gouging by US reﬁners.
The problem doesn’t exist. Claims to the
contrary are demonstrably false.
Yet the House sees ﬁt to legislate against
it. Doing so presupposes villainy where
none exists. While promising action in June
on a Senate version of the price-gouging
legislation, Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid (D-Nev.) deployed the Take That! approach with characteristic aplomb.
“We think anything we do should have
some effect on the gluttony of the oil companies,” he said.
The Take That! approach gives political
heroes like Reid dragons to slay. After all,
political heroes who know nothing about
the problems before them need dragons to
slay. So they lash out at suppliers of fuels
in short supply. To the extent they succeed
they’ll make demand ever harder to meet.
And prices will rise even more.
So take that, oil consumers! And never
forget who did it to you.

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Market wafﬂes prior to driving season
Crude futures prices wafﬂed during trading sessions prior to the extended Memorial Day weekend May 26-28 that marked the start of the US summer driving season.
The June contract for benchmark US sweet, light crudes gained $1.33 to $66.27/
bbl May 21 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest closing since Apr. 27. It
traded at $64.80-66.35/bbl May 22 before expiring at $64.97/bbl in the biggest 1-day
price decline since May 4.
The new front-month July contract lost $1.36 to $65.51/bbl on May 22. It traded
as high as $66.20/bbl May 23 before closing at $65.77/bbl. On May 24, it bounced
between $63.82 and $66.15/bbl before closing at $64.18/bbl, the lowest level in more
than a week, while in the UK North Sea Brent crude for July broke through $71/bbl, a
9-month high, before settling at $70.72/bbl.
“As a consequence, the Brent-West Texas Intermediate spread widened as much
as $6.54/bbl,” said analysts at Barclay’s Capital, the investment banking division of
Barclays Bank PLC, London.
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, “We
continue to believe the Brent crude contract more accurately depicts the tight global
oil market, along with underlying supply risks associated with Nigeria and Iran, and
would expect this premium over WTI to dissipate once the localized glut is eliminated.”
Traders ignored the loss of 100,000 b/d of production when BP PLC partially shut
in Prudhoe Bay oil ﬁeld May 22 after 20 bbl of water produced from the ﬁeld leaked
through a “pencil-sized” hole in a pipeline and was contained by BP. Ofﬁcials expected to have the leak repaired within a week. That ﬁeld normally produces 400,000 b/d.
US gasoline stocks increased by 1.5 million bbl to 196.7 million bbl in the week
ended May 18, still well below average for the time of year. Commercial US crude
inventories rose by 2 million bbl to 344.2 million bbl.
Valero reﬁnery
On May 24, Valero Energy Corp. shut down part of its 158,000 b/d McKee reﬁnery
in Sunray, Tex., due to a catalyst circulation problem. “We are still evaluating the
problem, but we expect the unit to be operating within 2 weeks. We expect that this
will result in a loss of production of 30,000 b/d of gasoline and 3,000 b/d of jet fuel
while the maintenance is ongoing. On the other hand, we will be able to increase
production of ultralow-sulfur diesel at the plant by 11,000 b/d,” said a company
spokesman. “We expect to reduce crude rates slightly to 80,000 b/d. This issue will
not affect our plans to increase overall throughput at the plant to 150,000 b/d by the
end of June.”
Meanwhile, Jerry Taylor, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said US motorists
had no reason to worry about fuel costs over Memorial Day. “High [gasoline] pump
prices are not reducing demand because they are not imposing anything like the
economic pain politicians allege,” he said. Adjusting nominal 1949 gasoline prices
of 27¢/gal for inﬂation, he said, “We get a price of $1.90/gal in today’s terms. If we
further adjust those prices by mean disposal income, we ﬁnd that gasoline prices
would have to be $6.68/gal before they were taking the same bite out of our wallets
as they were in 1949.
In 1962—a year writ large in the popular imagination as the quintessential year
of muscle cars and cheap gasoline thanks to [the movie] American Grafﬁti—gasoline
prices averaged 31¢/gal. When disposable income is considered, today’s gas would
have to cost $4.48/gal to be a comparable burden.”
Taylor said, “The public likewise thinks of 1972 as the last year of energy innocence prior to the rise of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the
onset of shortage. Fuel prices in 1972 averaged 36¢/gal—a hefty $2.77/gal in today’s
terms. While still high, this price is not all that different than the prices we were paying earlier in the year.”
The US sent nine warships through the Strait of Hormuz in a major show of
force May 23. “The ships are anticipated to commence exercises after traversing the
waters to reassure neighboring countries of US commitment to localized security
(the move is said to be a symbolic demonstration, as opposed to an inciting ﬂex of
muscle),” said Raymond James.
Elsewhere, the US National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration forecast a
75% chance that activity in the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season will be above average,
with 13-17 tropical storms anticipated and 7-10 of these expected to develop into
hurricanes and 3-5 expected to become major hurricanes.

Seismic business evolving
amid industry upturn

E

ven as activity rebounds strongly in the oil and natural
gas seismic sector, that business continues to evolve
in new directions.
Rapidly advancing technology is one of the key drivers of that evolution, coming in response to the changing technology needs of operators as they venture into more challenging geologic and geographic environments.
Industry specialists also see a seemingly contradictory pair
of trends in the seismic sector: increased specialization by new
niche companies and horizontally expanded service offerings
for “one-stop shopping” by established ﬁrms.
Given the revenue growth prospects for the oil and gas industry today, the future of the seismic industry is decidedly
bright—and there is substantial room for growth.
“Oil and gas companies continue to ramp up their exploration expenditures to take advantage of these historically high
price levels and to attempt to sustain production in an era in
which oil and gas is becoming harder to ﬁnd and more costly
to produce,” says Robert Peebler, president and CEO of I/O
(Input/Output Inc.) “While seismic expenditures have grown at
a 10–15% annual rate over the last several years, comparable
to the growth of the overall E&P sector, seismic still accounts
for only $10 billion of the $300 billion total annual E&P spend.”

“While seismic expenditures have grown at a
10–15% annual rate over the last several years,
comparable to the growth of the overall E&P sector, seismic still accounts for only $10 billion of
the $300 billion total annual E&P spend.”

through a more open relationship.”
Sledzik also contends that by managing both local and
global considerations in the planning and execution of projects,
seismic ﬁrms are able to further enhance the opportunities for
new technologies to deliver value that lowers E&P risk.
“This may take the form of long-term relationships where
we work with operators to understand the 4D, or time-lapse,
response of producing assets to multicompany collaboration,
including interpretation and modeling, on multiclient projects.”
A strong commitment to R&D is critical in the changing oil
and gas industry environment, Sledzik adds.
“Key to addressing ever-more complex E&P challenges will
be to maintain a scale and commitment to R&D that can create and enable new game-changing technologies,” he says.
“Increasingly, successful R&D is deﬁned not just in the development of singular technologies or products, but, more importantly, integrated solutions, which leverage the beneﬁts of a
suite of component technologies. This philosophy led to the
development of WesternGeco Q-Technology and continues to
guide the direction of our R&D strategy.
“These integrated solutions must not only answer key
technical challenges but also increase oil ﬁeld productivity per employee—a goal that is increasingly enhanced by
bringing together the collaborative knowledge and expertise of
all parties involved.”

Marine seismic
In the marine seismic arena, a drive toward improving acquisition productivity and spatial sampling is resulting in ever-increasing numbers of streamers and greater efforts to position
and control them, according to Peebler.
He also ticks off these trends in the marine seismic
business:
• Exploration for prospects in deeper waters and deeper in
the geologic column.
• More than 20 new marine vessels expected to enter the
market before 2009.
• A move toward more and longer streamer cables and

tighter streamer spacing to increase sampling densities
and improve image quality.
• Introduction of complex acquisition geometries (such as
wide- and multi-azimuth) to better image subsalt targets.
• More than $200 million (60%) growth in sector revenues
from marine equipment since 2004.
• Growing sector backlogs for key technologies, especially
streamer cables.
• Increasing penetration of new acquisition platforms,
including node systems and full-wave seabed systems.
• Introduction of new processing algorithms, such as beam
migration and reverse time migration. ]

Structural, technological changes create
new seismic business opportunities

E

ven as it adapts to structural and technological
change amid a new oil and natural gas industry boom,
the seismic sector faces a wealth of new business
opportunities.
Propelled by high commodity prices, nonconventional oil
and gas exploration and production activity is experiencing rapid
growth. And there will be fresh opportunities in areas outside
of traditional oil and gas operations, such as a push for carbon
dioxide sequestration in response to a mounting global clamor to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
That said, the seismic sector will continue to rely most
heavily on its bread-and-butter business: conventional oil and
gas exploration and development.
“Seismic data will always play a major role in the exploration for and exploitation of oil and natural gas resources,” says
Steve Jumper, president and CEO, Dawson Geophysical Co.
“As subsurface features become more subtle and drilling risk
increases, our industry will be forced to respond with cost-

effective technology to improve subsurface images and reduce
ﬁnding costs.”

Reservoir characterization/monitoring

Even within the context of oil and gas operations, there is a shift
under way in the seismic business toward more emphasis on
reservoir characterization and monitoring.
“Our industry is expanding its knowledge of the information
carried in conventional seismic data, not to mention multicomponent data, and how those data relate to well data, engineering
data, and geologic information,” Jumper points out. “Once we
further integrate conventional—as well as multicomponent—
seismic data with other information available from the production and development of a reservoir, the door will open for increased utilization of seismic technology on the production side
of the E&P business.” He adds, “As we discern more information
about the reservoir rock, the use of seismic technology in the life
cycle of an oil and gas asset will be extended.”
That view squares with the evolving philosophy of WesternGeco,

and buying decisions have been dictated by immediate imaging
needs within the cycle, but without signiﬁcant consideration for
future imaging requirements,” he says. “In addition, conventional
seismic data are rarely of sufﬁcient resolution or ﬁdelity to reliably extrapolate quantitative maps of reservoir properties, such
as porosity.”
Today’s dynamic E&P environment demands much more, and
advanced seismic technology plays a key role, Sledzik contends.
“With brownﬁeld exploration, step-out exploration, and exploration near existing facilities, the life cycle of a reservoir becomes
a continuous loop. Seismic data buying decisions must take this
into account,” he says.
WesternGeco describes this cycle as the Geophysical Continuum, deﬁned as the connected life cycle of an oil ﬁeld, where
uncertainty is reduced by using high-ﬁdelity geophysical measurements that are consistently calibrated with all other oil ﬁeld
measurements throughout the cycle.
“WesternGeco developed Q-Technology to deliver advanced
seismic measurements that can span the life of a reservoir, from
providing the best exploration images to delivering quantitative rock and ﬂuid properties for development and production,”
Sledzik points out. “The key to unlocking this potential lies in
making fundamentally better seismic measurements that deliver
greater reservoir detail, allowing seamless calibration with other
geophysical and borehole data.”

Structural change
Perhaps the most signiﬁcant new business opportunity for companies in the seismic sector will come as a result of the oil and
gas industry’s own structural changes.
“We see a need to change the modus operandi of the larger
seismic companies,” says Sverre Strandenes, group president,
data processing and technology, Petroleum Geo-Services AS. “A
company like PGS has a very large, global, and unique seismic
database, combined with deep insights into the various hydrocarbon basins of the world.
“While a seismic database provides a tremendous value to
an oil company—constituting the fundamental basis for deﬁning and drilling prospects—in the hands of a service company,
these data are valued quite differently. Therefore we see scope
to change roles between oil companies and service companies—with the service companies moving higher up in the value
chain—becoming a partner to oil companies rather than a pure
service provider. This implies tighter relationships when it comes
to developing new technologies and different business models
and risk/reward sharing on commercial projects.”
Business models for geophysics are evolving, permitting
some fast-moving teams and organizations to respond with fullservice capabilities that are highly cost-effective and competitive, contends Fred Aminzadeh, president-elect of the Society of
Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) and president and CEO of dGB
USA: “The industry is in a new age of true ‘integration.’ The new
integration includes multidisciplinary technical work and data fusion, as well as new business collaboration models with open
| 10 |

source software approaches. All of these efforts target lowering
of exploration cost and reducing uncertainty and risks associated
with drilling energy opportunities.”

Technology role
New technology will play a key role in creating new business
opportunities for seismic companies as well.
“Geophysics can help operators drill wells, not only in the right
place, but also in the right way,” says Aminzadeh. “This means,
for example, assisting drilling by predicting overpressures and
detecting geohazards. One recent successful application of seismic methods in this area is the use of ‘gas chimney’ technology.
Gas ‘chimneys,’ or ‘clouds’—both in the overburden above some
hydrocarbon reservoirs and below reservoirs—are the result of
the seepage of gas over geologic time or migration of hydrocarbon from source. The associated effects in seismic data were
often, in the past, ﬁltered out as noise. Modern gas chimney
seismic technology instead attempts to utilize such information
to assess seal and charge risk, better understand the hydrocarbon migration pathways, and detect shallow gas hazards.”
Leon Thomsen, current SEG president and principal geophysicist at BP PLC, sees opportunity in revitalizing old ﬁelds through
4D (time-lapse) guidance of enhanced recovery processes: “Advances in 4D seismic in the form of permanently installed seismic monitoring systems (a part of the ‘instrumented oil ﬁeld’) are
expected to help the EOR process by guiding optimum placement of the injection wells and directional inﬁll drilling.”
Even booking and certifying reserves will create new business for seismic companies, Aminzadeh contends, namely estimating reserves by augmenting wellbore methods with surface
geophysical methods in order to quantify different risk factors
away from wells.
“While historically, engineers and geologists have been mostly responsible for reserve estimation, recent advances in various
geophysical methods and the role they play in quantifying and
risking different factors that go into the reserve estimation process (volumetrics, saturation, permeability, and recovery factor)
make it absolutely crucial for the participation of geophysicists in
booking the reserves and their certiﬁcation,” he says.

Emerging opportunities
Seismic technology also will play an increasingly important role
in exploiting the emerging energy resources of tomorrow. Of
special interest are applications of geophysical technology in
developing unconventional hydrocarbon resources such as gas
shales, tight sands, and coalbed methane.
“Various geophysical techniques, such as multicomponent
seismics, well-to-well tomography, and passive seismics are
candidates for such applications,” Thomsen points out. “The
fundamental point is that these emerging resources are more
expensive to tap—that is why they are just now emerging.
“Whenever you do something expensive in the subsurface, it
pays to understand the subsurface very well, in order to control
that expensive process. This is where geophysics comes in.”

Integration the key driver
in seismic technology today

eismic technologies continue to make rapid advances
in response to a robust but technically more challenging
industry environment.
Even as the sector continues to break new ground
in a host of technologies, a new paradigm is emerging in how
these advanced technologies are being integrated to provide
the most detailed and accurate picture of the subsurface yet.

Integrating technologies
Steve Jumper, president and CEO of Dawson Geophysical Co.,
doesn’t foresee a single game-changing technology, but rather
a combination of technologies.
“For example, the use of multicomponent seismic data
technologies may lead to improvements in reservoir characterization and production monitoring onshore,” he notes. “The
most efﬁcient way to handle multicomponent recording will
| 12 |

be with digital sensors. The channel count required to properly image a reservoir will necessitate some form of wireless
recording system.”
Integrating technologies is becoming more essential with
the high risks associated with the increasingly geologically
challenging plays operators encounter today.
“With deepwater wells costing $25 million or more to drill,
operators face three main challenges—reducing exploration
risk, reducing upfront costs, and protecting their investment,”
notes Jim Sledzik, marketing director for WesternGeco, a division of Schlumberger. “They can accomplish these objectives
by using complementary technology to narrow the search and
improve the likelihood they will discover a hydrocarbon-bearing
structure before they spud the ﬁrst well.”
A seamless integration of the many geophysical datasets
available is key, says Sledzik: “Bathymetry and gravimetry

“With deepwater wells costing $25 million or
more to drill, operators face three main challenges—reducing exploration risk, reducing
upfront costs, and protecting their investment.
They can accomplish these objectives by using
complementary technology to narrow the search
and improve the likelihood they will discover a
hydrocarbon-bearing structure before they spud

— Jim Sledzik, WesternGeco

combine to identify sedimentary features such as ﬂuvial channels and deltaic fans. The WesternGeco Electromagnetics
product line now offers magnetotelluric surveys to indicate
the presence and thickness of subterranean resistive strata.
Used sequentially, these technologies can greatly reduce
exploration risk by identifying the most promising areas for
detailed seismic exploration.
“High-resolution Q-Technology seismic is now uniquely
enabling complex imaging solutions in extremely challenging
geological environments. Rich/wide azimuth [RAZ/WAZ] and
over/under [streamer] solutions will continue to propagate
throughout the world as reservoirs become smaller and more
complex. Finally, augmented by quality seismic data, interpretation of CSEM [controlled-source electromagnetic] surveys can
reveal the presence and areal extent of hydrocarbon-bearing
strata, further reducing exploration risk.”

‘Deep’ and ‘broad’ advances
Leon Thomsen, current president of the Society of Exploration
Geophysicists (SEG) and chief geophysicist for BP PLC, sees a
two-pronged evolution of technology in the seismic business.
“Advances in geophysics and their practical applications are
both ‘deep’ (meaning new extensions of existing ideas) and ‘broad’
(meaning new ideas beyond conventional seismic geophysics),”
he says. “Examples of deep geophysical advances include wideazimuth seismic, with a rich distribution of source/receiver azimuths; passive seismic (with no source at all); frequent time-lapse
seismic, with permanent receivers enabling cheaper reshoots
(done at intervals of every few weeks if necessary); cable-free
land seismic using radio transmission of data to a doghouse; and
‘surgical,’ nonintrusive 3D surveys in urban areas such as the Barnett Shale play in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.”
He cites as examples of broad innovations in geophysics
both nonseismic methods and integration with ideas outside
of geophysics. The nonseismic methods include new developments in electromagnetic methods, which are able to sense
hydrocarbon reservoirs at depth in favorable circumstances,
and full-tensor gravity gradient and magnetic gradient methods

that take advantage of declassiﬁed
military technology. Ideas outside
of geophysics include pattern
recognition and new ideas from
geology, sequence stratigraphy,
petrophysics, and engineering.
“In deciding which of these
technologies—both classical and
modern—may be useful in any particular context, it is important for the
operator to consider both the costs
and the beneﬁts of the technology,”
he says. “In this analysis, access to
geophysical expertise is crucial, and
SEG can help to provide it.”

Reservoir characterization
Innovations in geophysical technology and advances in computing technology are enabling industry to learn more about the
subsurface than ever before, spurring a quantum leap in reservoir characterization and monitoring, according to Fred Aminzadeh, SEG president-elect and president and CEO of dGB USA.
“We are able to see deep into the petroliferous basins of
the world with a new ability to directly see reservoir rock and
ﬂuid ﬂow properties resulting from new state-of-the-art full
elastic wave seismic acquisition, allowing for better reservoir
characterization and understanding,” he adds.
More advanced pattern recognition techniques to relate
the signature of geophysical measurements to reservoir properties are emerging, Aminzadeh notes. He speculates that it
is conceivable that proper integration of data from different
disciplines can identify details of the reservoirs with added
certainty: “‘Fingerprinting’ of seismic data, or associating a
given seismic character with the ‘DNA’ of a producing ﬁeld or
‘genetic building blocks’ of known reservoir properties, may
become a reality.”
Aminzadeh contends that all of this effort has to be done
with a better understanding of the physics of the earth, namely
“the capture and interpretation of a full elastic inversion for
various rock and ﬂuid properties in reservoirs, along with the
ability to see their behavior through visualization. Seeing ‘ﬂuids’
ﬂow will be the biggest accomplishment.”
Such potential led Petroleum Geo-Services AS to recently
commit to two third-generation Ramform vessels—due for
delivery in the ﬁrst quarters of 2008 and 2009—“because the
industry has clearly embraced the need for large streamer
counts,” says Sverre Strandenes, PGS group president, data
processing and technology.
“PGS ﬁrmly believes that we need to offer acquisition technology that can be tailored speciﬁcally towards each individual
reservoir—that, in general, high-density 3D will provide more
detail in a similar manner to increasing pixel density in digital
cameras and deliver these conﬁgurations with the highest
efﬁciency and reliability.”

seismic proﬁles (where the seismic source is placed inside the
well, and the measurements are made at the surface), borehole gravity, and well-to-well tomography—can ﬁnd more widespread utilization, once their economic value in reducing drilling
costs are understood and proven.”
Aminzadeh contends that the growing popularity of horizontal/directional drilling will make both surface and borehole geophysical measurements an integral part of any
drilling program.
Seismic data will realize their potential as quantitative oil
ﬁeld measurements when they tie with borehole data without
being forced, says Sledzik: “With calibrated inversion of Q seismic data, rock and ﬂuid properties can be propagated throughout the reservoir model in conjunction with geostatistics.”

Wide azimuth/multi-azimuth
With the advent of RAZ/WAZ acquisition, industry is still in the
early stages of understanding and realizing the full potential of
the data, contends Sledzik.
“Key factors in maximizing the value of the seismic data
will come through use of better well control (as more wells are
drilled), WEM (waveﬁeld extrapolation migration)-based multiazimuth tomography, and full waveform inversion for better
velocity models and salt geometry,” he says. “RAZ/WAZ tech| 16 |

nology will also be complemented in many areas by the use of
Multi-Measurement Constrained Imaging [MMCI], where we
integrate marine magnetotelluric and gravity data to further enhance interpretation and modeling.
“In the Gulf of Mexico we are now using this to better
deﬁne base-of-salt, which is critical to optimizing the subsalt
image quality.”
The greater operational complexity of WAZ multivessel
surveys, frequently in congested areas, demands the highest
standards in health, safety, and the environment, says Sledzik:
“These survey fundamentals, combined with recording and
source vessel synchronization, will rely upon the most experienced and highly trained personnel to ensure the safe and
successful execution of WAZ surveys.”
Because of their operational complexity, such surveys are
also costly.
Consequently, detailed forward modeling should precede
each project, Aminzadeh contends, noting that SEG is organizing a joint industry project dubbed SEAM (SEG Advanced
Modeling Project) to collaborate on such complex modeling
projects. SEG presentations at the 2007 Offshore Technology
Conference in Houston demonstrated that full inversion studies
of deepwater reservoirs are ready to begin, he adds.

technology an increase in both the number of streamer and
source vessels: “Also, wider towing spreads and utilizing data
acquired on line turns could be possible future extensions.
“In addition to the acquisition techniques, we will see developments in the areas of wide-azimuth depth imaging, velocity depth model building, and improved efﬁciency in multiple
removal methods.”

Wireless recording
A new era of digital, full-wave seismic land surveys using wireless micro-electromechanical sensors is being implemented rapidly in the ﬁeld, notes Thomsen.
“The jug hustler’s task is considerably lightened, so to speak,
if the miles of seismic cable in a 3D survey are replaced by radio
transmission,” he adds.
At the 2005 Society of Exploration Geophysicists convention,
Input/Output Inc. (I/O) announced the world’s ﬁrst full-wave,
cableless land acquisition system, FireFly, developed in partnership with BP and Apache Corp. Both operators committed funds
to deploy the ﬁrst system on their key E&D assets around the
world, starting with BP’s Wamsutter ﬁeld in Wyoming.
“By leveraging wireless technology and eliminating the cables
used in traditional land systems, FireFly reduces the cost, time,
and safety risks involved in a survey by requiring fewer workers
to lay out cables and by minimizing cable repairs,” says Robert
Peebler, president and CEO of I/O. “Reducing these acquisition
costs enables more money to be spent on sensors and recording units, providing densely sampled, high-resolution subsurface
data in return. At the same time, cable removal decreases environmental impact and allows companies to implement more
ﬂexible survey designs that are better aligned with their overall
subsurface imaging objectives.”
In late 2006, the ﬁrst FireFly system was deployed at Wamsutter. The ﬁrst Wamsutter survey involved recording about 7,200
shot points in a 28-square-mile survey area, according to Peebler.
The acquisition crew averaged 700 shots per day with a dynamite energy source; peak production was 1,001 shots during a
6-hr period. Data processing has begun, and initial results appear
promising, suggesting much higher-quality seismic images will
be obtained.
“Over the next several years, both BP and Apache will be
handing the initial FireFly system back and forth as they test how
far they will be able to push the boundaries of land seismic imaging,” Peebler adds.

Microseismic
Microseismic is emerging as a crucial tool in the development
of unconventional gas resources, particularly in hydrofracturing
tight gas sands and gas shales.
“A seismic truism is, ‘One person’s noise is another person’s
signal,’” notes Thomsen. “There are several ways to use seismic noise to advantage. Suppose, for instance, that the objective is to monitor a hydrofrac process by detecting and locating
the microseismics triggered by the injection, without being tied

to observations from only a nearby well.
“One way to do this is to lay out seismic receivers on the
surface and simply turn them on, recording the microseismic
events among the noise. By beam-forming the array in different
directions (like shining a ﬂashlight in different directions into a
dark room) and stacking the data with a known velocity function, the microseismics can be located under favorable circumstances to reveal the regional extent of microseismicity caused
by the hydrofrac operation.”

Prestack depth imaging
The continued development of azimuthal processing technologies to extract the maximum value from full azimuth and
WAZ acquisition solutions will further enhance depth imaging,
says Sledzik.
“In areas of the world with challenging salt and basalt imaging challenges, we expect to see increased deployment of
Q-Marine technology to facilitate a combination of [RAZ/WAZ]
solutions with over/under streamers to signiﬁcantly improve
the imaging of subsalt and sub-basalt geology.
“In many cases, we also expect to use [MMCI], which
brings together the beneﬁts of the best seismic with marine
magnetotellurics and gravity data in one integrated model. This
will allow us to reduce uncertainty and signiﬁcantly improve the
depth imaged data.
“Finally the enhanced integrity of the data achieved with
MMCI and the lower frequencies obtained through deployment
of the Q-Marine technology will enable the capture of low frequencies, which will greatly improve the potential for full waveform inversion.”
PGS believes that pre-stack imaging portfolios must have
ﬂexibility in accuracy vs. cost for the various imaging challenges
experienced, contends Strandenes.
“As a consequence, we have developed a broad portfolio of
velocity depth model building tools and depth migration algorithms,” he says. “Current migration methods have limitations
in the imaging of steeply dipping reﬂectors such as those found
on salt ﬂanks.
“Reverse time migration (RTM) overcomes these constraints, enabling structures with dips greater than 90° to be
imaged. An RTM was released in 2006 by PGS, thus providing
a solution to the two-way wave equation, capable of accurate
imaging in the most challenging geology. The PGS solution is
isotropic now, but the natural extension is to also include anisotropy and more accurate true amplitude solutions.”
Strandenes believes that seismic waveform analysis—instead of the current wave equation or travel time-based tomography methods could be the next game-changing seismic
technology for the depth velocity model update.
“In Waveform Tomography, the input data consist of the
seismic waveforms as opposed to the picked travel times, and
the underlying numerical method is based on the full wave
equation,” he notes. “However, more fundamental research is
required to deliver state-of-the art industrial tools.”

cutting-edge solid streamer technology. Photo courtesy of CGG-Veritas.
As more complex subsurface structures or those associated with poor data quality (e.g., deepwater or subsalt) become
E&P targets for many producers, more accurate, faster, and
more cost-effective methods continue to be in high demand,
notes Aminzadeh.
“While advances in hardware (faster and cheaper computers) are expected to play a key role, more efﬁcient software
approaches to reduce the cycle time (especially the human-intensive component) will be important,” he says. “For example,
a more interactive velocity model building workﬂow and recursive algorithms (e.g., incorporating ‘implicit representation’) are
expected to make a major impact.”

Software
The nature of software development and the way software is
licensed for commercial use is also going through a major revolution, claims Aminzadeh.
Among the new trends he cites are the ability to use the software as a commodity (pay per use), access software through
the internet, and use a multitude of software packages from different vendors on a single platform. Aminzadeh expects open
source software to become increasingly common.
“These trends are unstoppable, but they are slowed down by
several factors,” he says. “First, there is the demographic distribution of our profession. People of our generation are overrepresented. In general, this generation takes the decisions regarding
new software tools, while it is less willing to learn new techniques than younger generations. Secondly, most professionals are under extreme time pressure to perform only the basic
tasks, leaving no time for introducing new technology. Lastly, in

large companies, standardization is considered more important
than innovation. IT departments rule instead of serving.”

Seismic analysis/interpretation
Advances in pattern recognition and other nontraditional analysis
are helping to push the boundaries of seismic interpretation.
“Normally, geophysicists look for anomalies within otherwise regular patterns,” says Aminzadeh. “In many situations,
conventional statistical means are inadequate to tackle practical problems, and nontraditional methods such as neural
networks, fuzzy logic, complexity theory, genetic algorithms,
chaos theory, and ﬁngerprinting are employed.” These tools
have proven useful in many complex geologic settings, such
as fractured reservoirs, where simplifying assumptions such
as homogenous medium and “convolutional models” are not
valid, he points out.
“Fuzzy logic and other nonlinear methods can describe shapes
and structures with realistic geologic complexity,’’ says Aminzadeh. “These techniques can push the boundaries of seismic resolution, allowing smaller-scale anomalies to be characterized.”
The SEG president-elect cites a paper presented at the 2006
SEG Annual Meeting that detailed how a neural network was
used in conjunction with fuzzy logic to high-grade prospects containing hydrocarbon-saturated reservoirs.
“This was accomplished by using fuzzy logic to formulate
general rules of thumb, derived from rock physics data and interpreter’s knowledge and experience,” he says. “Integrating such
linguistic rules with a neural network ranking (of the most relevant attributes for prospect risking) improves the process when
compared to conventional ‘thresholding’ methods.” ]

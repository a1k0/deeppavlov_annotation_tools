CATHODIC SHIELDING BY
DISBONDED COATINGS
Why you need
Polyguard RD-6

Disbonded coating
with moisture
underneath.

Graphic Illustration of Shielding

Extracted from NACE document “Coating Failure Definitions in Relation to CP”
Definition of “Shielding With No Holiday”
“A substantial diversion of cathodic current away from its intended target (i.e.steel substrate) due to a disbonded coating with a
high dielectric characteristic and no holidays on the disbonded coating. Steel substrate is deprived of protective current and
corrosion can continue undetected and unchecked, including MIC activity, until failure occurs. Traditional diagnostic techniques
such as CIS and DCVG cannot identify the existence of such anomalies.”
DISBONDMENT
Even the best coatings can
disbond in areas over time.
Disbondment risk is greatest
with girth weld coatings which
are application sensitive and
subject to soil stress.

HIGH DIELECTRIC
Corrosion coatings with solid
film backing have this high
dielectric characteristic.

INSIDIOUS #1
We at Polyguard believe that the
problem of shielding disbonded
coatings is one of the most
serious in the pipeline industry.
Our belief is reinforced as large
operators who discover the
shielding problem convert to
our RD-6 coating system.

INSIDIOUS #2
Shielding hides corrosion
not only from CP, but also from
common diagnostic techniques.
Shielding is truly an insidious
phenomenon.

Two corrosion coatings are proven to be non-shielding, that is to allow passage of protective CP current into disbonded areas. One
of these is FBE. The other is the Polyguard RD-6 coating system. After 21 years, and thousands of installations, there has been no
significant metal loss found under the Polyguard RD-6 coating system.

Polyguard has been ISO 9000 certified since 1996.
Current certifications are:
- American Natl. Standards Institute
- Dutch Council for Certification
- Deutscher Akkreditierungs Rat

EPA directs Texaco to resume Superfund cleanup
The US Environmental Protection Agency has ordered Texaco
Inc., which Chevron Corp. acquired in 2001, to assess soil and
ground water contamination and evaluate cleanup options for the
Pacific Coast Pipeline Superfund site in Fillmore, Calif.
Texaco operated the 52-acre site northwest of Los Angeles as a
refinery from 1920 to 1951, contaminating soil and ground water with heavy metals and volatile organic compounds, EPA said
on Nov. 4. It said the company cleaned up on-site waste disposal
pits in 1986 and, in 1993 under the chemical waste Superfund
program, pumped and treated the ground water under EPA’s direction.
Benzene is the primary contaminant in the ground water, the
federal environmental regulator said in a unilateral administrative
order. The benzene plume, which extends 100 yards off the site,
does not threaten drinking water wells but concentrations remain
above drinking water standards, it added.
The soil has low levels of lead and semivolatile chemicals, such
as naphthalene, which also need to be addressed, according to
EPA. It said it is updating the Pacific Coast Pipeline Community Involvement Plan to identify opportunities for communication with
the public about upcoming activities at the site.

Industry extends funding for marine life research
Oil and gas producers have agreed to extend funding of a joint
industry program (JIP) to support research into learning more
about how sounds generated by upstream oil and gas activities
affect marine life.
Much of the research has focused upon how various types of
whales react to sounds and vibrations created by seismic survey
equipment.
The JIP on Sound and Marine Life started with a 1-year scoping phase in 2005 followed by a 3-year phase that started in May
2006. The International Association of Oil & Gas Producers announced a 3-year funding extension on Nov. 11. OGP is based in
London.
John Campbell, OGP technical director, said the extension will
“enable us to continue supporting key research that assists regula-

tory and technical organizations in understanding the complex
marine environment.”
A core of 10 of the original JIP participants agreed to extend the
fund. They are BG Group, BHP Billiton, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips, Eni SPA, ExxonMobil Corp., the International Association
of Geophysical Contractors, Santos Ltd., Statoil ASA, and Woodside Petroleum Ltd.
One of the first JIP projects led to developing acoustic-monitoring software that helps operators detect the presence of marine
mammals within exploration and development areas.
Since May 2006, the JIP has funded 62 projects, and various
government groups worldwide have helped funded many of these
projects. JIP research addresses:
• Sound source characterization and propagation in the
ocean.
• Physical, physiological, and hearing effects of sound on marine life.
• Behavioral reactions and their biological significance to
sound in the marine environmental.
• Mitigation, monitoring, data analysis, and management.

Oil and gas group forms in Greenland
Responding to “a continuously increasing focus on the possibilities for oil and gas production in Greenland,” seven operators
have formed a trade association anticipating industry development
in the country.
Founding members of the Greenland Oil Industry Association
are DONG E&P Greenland AS, Esso Exploration Greenland Ltd.,
Chevron Greenland Exploration AS, Husky Oil Operations Ltd.,
Capricorn Greenland Exploration Ltd. (a subsidiary of Cairn Energy PLC), PA Resources AB, and Nunaoil AS.
All the companies have interests in exploration licenses off
western and southern Greenland (see map, OGJ, Aug. 24, 2009, p.
38). At present, Greenland produces no oil or gas.
In a press statement, DONG Energy said members of the group
will pursue safety and environmental stewardship, knowledge
sharing, public and governmental communications, and development of a competitive industry. ✦

New Zealand’s Maari-Manaia tops 100 million bbl
Estimated ultimate recovery of more than 100 million bbl of
oil has been confirmed for OMV AG-operated Maari field and
adjacent Manaia field in the offshore portion of New Zealand’s
Taranaki basin, two of the field’s partners said.
OMV, which declined comment on reserves and production

until a full evaluation is complete, plans to place on production
an extended reach well that at 26,250 ft is New Zealand’s longest

The new recovery figure is twice the volume initially estimated
for the main Moki sands reservoir at Maari. New Zealand’s next

largest producing area is the Tui fields at an original 50 million
bbl.
Recent additional discoveries at Manaia and the Maari M2A
sands plus the main Moki reservoir together “amount to over 100
million bbl of recoverable oil,” said Richard Tweedie, chairman of
Maari minority partner Cue Energy. Maari field went on production in April.
The Manaia extended reach well is to be tied into Maari facilities and begin producing within months. Production from the
M2A zone well in the Moki sands, 50 m above the main reservoir,
is expected to start by yearend.
Another Maari partner, Horizon Oil, said the additional reserves will extend the field’s production plateau. The MR9 well to
the M2A zone will produce intermittently when capacity becomes
available.
Horizon said the Manaia-1 horizontal well cut 1.5-km-long
Mangahewa reservoir section with a net-to-gross pay factor of 6070% and that logs and gas-oil ratio analyses confirm the presence
of oil throughout.
There was no revision to the predrill oil in place estimate of
50-60 million bbl at this stage. Horizon said oil in place estimate
for the Maari M2A zone is 30-40 million bbl (OGJ Online, Oct.
7, 2009).
Exploratory wells have penetrated two more oil zones at Maari
that are not yet appraised, Horizon noted. They are the deeper
Mangahewa formation at Maari and the shallower Moki formation at Manaia.
Maari-Manaia interests are OMV 69%, Todd Energy 16%, Horizon Oil International 10%, and Cue Energy Resources 5%. Todd
Energy owns 27% of Cue.

EOG sees reserve hike in Barnett Combo play
Improved horizontal completion techniques in the North Texas
Barnett Combo play have led EOG Resources Inc. to estimate that
ultimate recoveries in one area will be 80% higher than the company’s early 2008 estimates in the play.
The new EUR figure for wells in eastern Montague and western
Cooke counties is 280,000 boe, EOG said.
The two recent horizontal wells, Christian A-1H and B-1H, had
initial production of 1,000 b/d and 6,000 b/d of oil and 2.5 and 2
MMcfd of gas, respectively. EOG has 100% working interest.
Meanwhile, in the play’s core area, where pay intervals are
thickest, EOG has been developing its acreage with vertical wells
that are expected to recover more than 220,000 boe. For example,
the Fitzgerald-1 and Stephenson-1 vertical wells had initial rates
of 1,100 b/d and 450 b/d of oil and 2.1 MMcfd and 700 Mcfd,
respectively. EOG’s interest is 100%.
The company, which rarely makes acquisitions, made a tacti-

Reliance reports Cambay oil discovery
Reliance Industries Ltd., Mumbai, reported a Miocene oil discovery in the Cambay basin southwest of Ahmedabad, India, that
Reliance said “is expected to open future potential within the
block.”
CB10A-A1, Reliance’s fifth well, went to a total depth of 1,451
m in Part A of the two-part block and flowed at a rate of 500 b/d
of oil from the Babaguru formation of Miocene basal sand on a
6-mm bean with 360 psi flowing tubinghead pressure. The well
has a gross reservoir thickness of 15 m.
Block CB-ONN-2003/1, won in India’s fifth licensing round,
has two parts in Gujarat. Part A to the west covers 570 sq km, and
Part B to the east covers 65 sq km. Reliance, which holds 100%
participating interest, named the discovery Dhirubhai-43.
Reliance has shot 3D seismic data over 80% of the block and
2D data over its entirety. Based on interpretation of the 3D data,
Reliance has identified several prospects at different stratigraphic
levels to fulfill the minimum work obligation under the production sharing contract.

GeoResources Bakken participation growing
GeoResources Inc., Houston, said the pace of activity in the
Williston basin Bakken/Three Forks play is increasing in its joint
venture with Slawson Exploration Co., private Wichita-based operator.
GeoResources expects to participate in 60 joint venture wells
in the next 18 months and will hold minor interest in numerous
other wells. The company has 10-18% working interest in 110,000
net acres in the Bakken and has a 100% success rate with 34 Slawson-operated wells.
GeoResources, which continues to acquire land, said 63,000
acres are in Mountrail County, ND, on the east side of the Nesson
anticline.
The company also owns minor working interests with multiple
operators in more than 125 wells in the Bakken/Three Forks play
in different parts of the basin.
Most wells in which GeoResources participates will be on 640acre units, but the company is scheduling 1,280-acre and some
larger spacing units and has numerous locations that may result in
or require the larger units.
Completed well costs for single-lateral wells on 640-acre units
are $3-3.5 million. Initial production rates have improved as the
number of frac stages increases, and recent wells have had 18 stages. Three rigs are running and a fourth rig joins in from time to
time. ✦

ploration and production activities at Sacha over the next decade,
with about 60% of the investment coming in the next 5 years. In
September Rio Napo signed a service contract with Petroproduccion, a Petroecuador subsidiary, for Sacha field. PDVSA said the
contact was to “manage, increase production at, develop, optimize, integrally improve, and exploit” the Sacha site.
Analyst BMI said Sacha is “one of the country’s largest producing fields, but insufficient investment has meant that, as is the case
with several other fields operated by Petroecuador, it has yet to
reach its full potential.”
BMI added that the Rio Napo JV is one of a series of accords
reached between Ecuador and Venezuela since President Rafael
Correa took power, in line with the strategy of the Venezuelan
leader Hugo Chavez of offering “special treatment” to his leftist
allies in the region.
In addition to Venezuela, Ecuador last month also signed an
E&P contract for its Oglan field with a joint company of Petroecuador and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec).
With the agreement, Sinopec joins a handful Chinese state
oil companies that have positioned themselves in the Ecuadorian
market as partners of Petroecuador, including China National Petroleum Corp., Andes Petroleum, Petroriental, Sinopec, and CPEB
Changqing Petroleum.
Petroecuador also started talks with Angola’s Sonangol, which
is interested in Blocks 28 and 29 in the Amazon region as well as
offshore Block 42. In April Petroecuador and Sonangol signed an
agreement to cooperate in several blocks in Ecuador.

PSAC sees low 2010 Canadian drilling activity
The Petroleum Services Association of Canada (PSAC) expects
the oil and gas industry to drill 8,000 wells in Canada during
2010.
This number of wells is about the same as its current forecast
for 2009, which is 1,500 wells less than it expected in July and
considerably less than the 16,000 wells it had forecast at yearend
2008.
PSAC’s 2010 breakdown by province and change from 2009 is
5,095 wells in Alberta (a 5% decrease), 630 in British Columbia (a
7% increase), 1,935 wells in Saskatchewan (a 10% increase), and
300 wells in Manitoba (a 22% increase).

Processing
Western Refining trimming New Mexico units
Western Refining Inc., El Paso, is consolidating operations of
its two small refineries in New Mexico to reduce operating costs
in a period of shrunken refining margins.
To be consolidated at Gallup are the 23,000 b/d refinery there
and the 17,000 b/d facility at Bloomfield, which will be idled.
Western said total crude throughput will not decline from recent
combined levels, which in the first 9 months of this year averaged
25,560 b/d.
The company said the move will cut operating costs by about
$25 million/year beginning in the first quarter of 2010.
The Gallup refinery’s processing capacities include 7,000 b/d
of catalytic cracking, 8,000 b/d of catalytic reforming, 16,500 b/d
10

PSAC noted that it sees adequate oil prices in 2010 to sustain
conventional drilling activity in areas such as Saskatchewan and
northeast Alberta, but continued low gas prices that will reduce by
30% conventional shallow-gas drilling in southeast Alberta.
PSAC based its 2010 forecast on an average $5 (Can.)/Mcf gas
price and a $72/bbl West Texas Intermediate oil price.

Contract let for coal gasification plant
Tenaska Energy Inc., Omaha, has let a contract to Siemens Energy for coal gasification technology at the planned Taylorville
Energy Center (TEC), one of the first commercial-scale facilities of
its kind in the US to use carbon capture and sequestration.
Siemens will provide equipment contracts and licensing agreements for four 500-Mw-class gasifiers.
TEC, in Taylorville, Ill., will have gross generating capacity of
730 Mw, and net capacity of 500-525 Mw.
It will use a hybrid integrated gasification combined-cycle process to convert coal into synthesis gas, which in turn will be converted into methane, called substitute natural gas (SNG) by project
sponsors, to fuel power generation.
Officials of Tenaska, TEC managing partner, expect the facility
to produce about 33 trillion btu of SNG/year.
Volumes not needed as fuel for two gas turbines will move to a
connection with the interstate pipeline system. Amounts will depend on coal and gas prices. Officials say current modeling indicates the SNG pipeline volume will be about 10 trillion btu/year.
The project will capture as much as 3 million tons/year of carbon dioxide at the synthesis gas stage, more than half its output
of the greenhouse gas. It will sequester the CO2 underground near
the plant site or sell it for use in enhanced oil recovery.
Tenaska and Siemens officials say capturing that much CO2 will
make the TEC comparable in greenhouse gas emissions to a power
plant fueled by natural gas.
The facility is expected to cost $3.5 billion. The US Department
of Energy has selected the project for negotiation of loan guarantees totaling as much as $2.579 billion under a program created by
the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
DOE last month issued a notice of intent for the preparation
of an environmental impact statement for the TEC loan guarantee. ✦

of catalytic hydrotreating, 2,500 b/d of alkylation, and 5,000 b/d

Bloomfield’s capacities are 5,000 b/d of catalytic cracking,
5,100 b/d of catalytic reforming, 8,300 b/d of catalytic hydrotreating, and 2,000 b/d of polymerization.
The refineries, about 95 miles apart, process mainly light sweet
crude and natural gas liquids produced nearby. Western owns
more than 250 miles of crude gathering lines.
“The company is evaluating alternative uses for the Bloomfield
refinery, including the possibility of biofuels production,” Western said in a press statement.
Western also operates a 128,000 b/d refinery in El Paso and a
70,000 b/d refinery in Yorktown, Va.

Transneft poses export tariff zones for ESPO line work in its construction. Earlier this year, another blast occurred
Russia’s OAO Transneft has proposed dividing its East SiberiaPacific Ocean oil pipeline into three export tariff zones, according
to a company official.
Spokesman Igor Dyomin said Transneft wants the ESPO line
to be divided into the eastern, western, and central export tariff
zones, with $34/tonne charged for oil transported via the eastern zone, $48/tonne via the western zone, and $42/tonne via the
central zone.
The eastern zone will extract oil from Talakan field, the western zone from Vankor field, and the central zone from fields in
the southern Krasnoyarsk territory, said Dyomin, who added that
the proposals already have been filed with the Russia’s Federal
Tariffs Service.
Transneft expects the tariff for oil transportation through its
system to increase in 2010 at a rate comparable with inflation, said
Dyomin, who added that the state firm has no plans to increase
its tariff proportionally to the growth of its expenses, which are
expected to rise by 30%.
Russian authorities last month said oil for the line is to be
branded Vsto, and will be light and medium-sour, superior to
Urals export blend but inferior to Siberian Light (OGJ Online, Oct.
12, 2009).

Moldova to investigate gas pipeline explosion
Moldovan Prime Minister Vladimir Filat said his government
has established a commission to investigate the cause of an explosion on a natural gas trunkline that supplied the Balkans with
Russian gas.
A section of the line, about 70 km southeast of Moldova’s capital Chisinau, burst on Nov. 8 and cut supplies to 34 Moldovan villages and towns but left gas transit to the Balkans unaffected.
MoldovaGaz Chief Executive Officer Alexander Gusev said the
blast may have occurred due to wear-and-tear or even negligent
12

along the pipeline in the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, and
was attributed to wear-and-tear.
“The country’s gas pipelines are ageing while no serious investment in upgrades has been made or is on the horizon,” said
analyst IHS Global Insight. “With the onset of winter and no imminent investment on the horizon for Moldova’s gas pipeline network, further explosions and gas disruptions may well occur.”

First phase finished for PNG LNG project
ExxonMobil Corp. and its joint venture partners completed
the front-end engineering and design phase for their Papua New
Guinea LNG project.
All that is needed before a final investment decision for the
project are a benefit-sharing agreement with the Papua New
Guinea government, expected in the next few weeks, and ExxonMobil finalizing loan finance as well as sales and purchase agreements with customers.
Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Michael Somare said the
project would help transform the economy and raise living standards in the country.
About 60,000 landowners in remote rural areas will be direct beneficiaries of royalties and dividends in addition to the
increased capacity of the national, provincial, and local governments to improve infrastructure and services.
ExxonMobil and its partners are already implementing a number of programs, including work on building training facilities
for 1,000 people at Juni in the Southern Highlands and in Port
Moresby.
Work will be carried out to help landowner companies via the
provision of jobs and cash dividends.
The Papua New Guinea LNG project will cost $15 billion and
have the capacity to produce 6.6 million tonnes/year of LNG. The
country’s Department of Environment and Conservation approved
its environmental impact statement. ✦

Focus on jobs
One of the unfortunate characteristics of the oil and gas industry is its
unwillingness to estimate the impact of
government actions in terms that the
public can relate to.
While industry people can get silly
about impacts in terms of marginal barrels per day and dollars per barrel, what
the public relates to is jobs created and
jobs destroyed.
For a change, it would be nice to
see the American Petroleum Institute,
National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, or National Petroleum Council
objectively look at the options on the
table before Congress and estimate the
jobs impacts on the primary hydrocarbons business—and also on the secondary jobs that depend on oil and gas.
Congress would look differently at
the oil provisions if its members knew
that, say, 500,000 jobs in the business

The credits phase out over a 1-year
period for any given manufacturer
once the company has sold over 60,000

“We believe, however, that a new
round of incentives will emerge from
the US government to encourage purchase of hybrids and electric vehicles,”
said Sankey. ✦

The reckless IST mandate
The 111th Congress has shown yet again a
dangerous urge to govern before thinking. The
House on Nov. 6 passed a security bill that would
put the federal government in the middle of safety
decisions that instead should be made by facility
designers and operators.
The Chemical and Water Security Act of 2009
contains provisions that have the effect of mandating design and operational principles called inherently safer technology (IST; OGJ Online, Nov.
9, 2009). That phrase has irresistible appeal. Who
can oppose something with such a name? It’s easy
to see why politicians yearning to govern would
want to enshrine it in law with their names attached.

that industry has applied the concept for decades,
Langerman said IST “collectively captures a
group of processes and technologies that improve
safety by greatly reducing or eliminating hazards
through a permanent and inseparable element of
the process.” Safety, he noted, “is built into the
process from the outset, not added on, and the
hazards are reduced or eliminated, not simply
controlled.” IST can include engineering changes,
material substitution, or quantity reduction, he
said, and is one among many ways to reduce risk.
Objecting to inclusion of a requirement for IST in

Expansion of the petrochemicals
complex at Shuaiba, Kuwait, about
25 miles south of Kuwait City, was
completed earlier this summer, according to its engineering contractor Fluor
Corp. The project spanned 5 years (OGJ

Fluor began work on Olefins II in
July 2004 by providing overall management consultancy and front-end
engineering and design for utilities and
infrastructure. Olefins II doubles capacity of the existing complex that has
operated there since 1998 (OGJ, Sept.
15, 1997, p. 36).
Olefins II also included Fluor oversight of engineering and construction
of an 850,000-tonne/year (tpy) ethane

he said, adding, “Additionally, HR 2868
strengthens CFATS by adding enforcement tools, protecting the rights of
whistleblowers, and enhancing security
training.”
Simply extending the program’s
existing authority for 3 years “flies in
the face of testimony that we received
about gaps in CFATS and would be a
rejection of all the carefully tailored
security enhancements in the bill,”
Thompson said.

Beyond chemicals
Peter T. King (R-NY), the committee’s ranking minority member, said
HR 2868’s IST provision would create
confusion and unnecessary expenses,
cost jobs, and stifle the private sector.
“We should keep in mind that we’re
not just talking about large chemical
plants, but we’re also talking about
institutions such as colleges and hospitals which will have to incur these
costs,” King said.
King said the current law is working, and that DHS did not ask for an
extension of its authority. “I believe
that we took…an admirable concept
of enhancing chemical plant security,
and have allowed concepts and ideas
regarding the environment…[to]
have too large an influence on this
bill,” he said.
Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-NJ), a committee member, said the bill was long
overdue, noting that his home state is
the location of what the FBI considers
the most dangerous 2 miles in America
with several large chemical plants near
residential areas along the New Jersey
Turnpike. State law requires chemical plants to conduct safer technology
assessments “and believe it or not, our
state is not only safer for it, but the sky
hasn’t fallen on the chemical companies in New Jersey,” he said. Such state
authority should not be preempted in
federal legislation, he added.
But Charles W. Dent (R-Pa.) said
New Jersey’s law requires IST assessments, but not implementation, and
that HR 2868 would go much farther.

DHS already is required to assess plants’
vulnerabilities and has completed
about a third of the estimated 6,000
assessments, he noted. “Adding these
IST assessments will be enormously
costly,” he said. IST assessments also are
designed to deal with workplace safety
issues, not plant security, he added.
Thompson said: “What we’re looking at now is an opportunity to go into
facilities that don’t, in many instances,
have security assessments. If we make
security assessments, then we will
identify those vulnerabilities in those
facilities and help them correct them.

the Energy and Commerce Committee.
“First, granting the [Homeland Security] secretary authority to mandate a
facility to perform a ‘method to reduce
a consequence of a terrorist attack,’ or
IST, raises questions as to whether, or
how, to involve government agencies
like DHS that have few, if any, process

other qualified staff,” Green said in
extended comments. “We worked to

Bad people would love to get into facilities with vulnerabilities and do them
harm. What we’re trying to do is help

Concerns addressed
Gene Green (D-Tex.), who supported the bill, said chemical and other
facilities in his district have invested $8
billion to improve their security since
2001 and are fully complying with
CFATS provisions which have not been
fully implemented. He noted that he
had some concerns when HR 2868 was
introduced but that many of these were
addressed when the bill went through

safety, engineering, and chemistry.”
The scope of facilities nationwide
that would potentially be affected by
IST requirements was substantially
reduced by focusing exclusively on
chemical facilities in populated areas
subject to a release threat, Green said.
DHS also would not be able to mandate
IST if it was not feasible or if the facility
would no longer be able to continue
operating at that location, he said.
The original bill also contained language which unnecessarily duplicated
chemical facility regulations under the
Marine Transportation Security Act
(MTSA), according to Green. He said

Green said the bill also contains a

Green maintained, “HR 2868 is

regulations while reducing duplicative regulatory standards, increasing
worker protections, and providing

“I’m an industrial engineer and understand plant processes and chemical
processes to some extent,” he said. “I
think we’re very blessed in this country to have a robust chemical industry,
much of which is located in Texas and
Louisiana. If this bill becomes law, my

so, many of those facilities are going to
be closed down and inoperable, tens of
thousands of jobs are going to be lost,
and our chemical industry is simply going to move onshore.”

HR 2868 is not about preventing
terrorist attacks, but simply sets up a
regime under which DHS and EPA employees who know little about chemical
processes make key technical decisions,
Barton said. “As if this was not enough,
this legislation weakens the protections
traditionally given to high-risk security information by treating need-toknow information like environmental

facilities almost an open book to go in
and, under these open meeting requirements and open records requirements,

to concoct schemes to destroy these
very facilities?”
Republican amendments to preempt
state laws, to strike the IST provision
and simply extend the existing CFATS
program, and to remove language allowing citizens to sue DHS to compel
enforcement were defeated on Nov. 6
before the bill’s final vote. ✦

EIA forecast
mentions rebound

E

conomists are generally hesitant
about using “r” words. Many
waited a year ago before admitting
that the world had entered a recession. They’re equally cautious now
about any possible rebound.
The US Energy Information
Administration nevertheless raised
by $7/bbl its forecast price of West
Texas Intermediate crude in its latest
short-term energy outlook because it
believes sustained economic growth
in China and elsewhere in Asia may
lead to a rebound in demand.
WTI prices should average $77/
bbl in the October-March period and
reach $81/bbl by December 2010 if
US and world economic conditions
keep improving, particularly in Asia
where growth has been stronger
than expected, EIA said on Nov. 10
in its latest monthly forecast.
The forecast assumes US real
domestic product will grow by 1.9%
in 2010 while world oil consumptionweighted GDP increases by 2.6%.
High inventories tempered EIA’s
assessment. “Although Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development inventories remain high,
optimism for a continued economic
turnaround, combined with the
impact of Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries production cuts,
have driven oil prices higher,” it said.

Initial assessments
fourth quarter, demand in nonOECD countries should “more than
offset these losses, leading to the first
growth in global oil consumption in
five quarters,” it said.
EIA said it projects a 1.26 million
b/d growth in world oil consumption during 2010, with non-OEDC
countries representing the largest
share. It expects OECD consumption
to increase by only 100,000 b/d next
year, largely because of a projected
turnaround in the US, which would
reverse a decline that began in 2005.

‘Surprisingly strong’

Oil production outside OPEC averaged 50.1 million b/d during 2009’s
first three quarters, about 500,000
b/d above the average for the comparable 2008 period, EIA reported.
“Non-OPEC oil production has been
surprisingly strong in 2009, largely
the result of higher-than-expected
production from Russia,” it said.
Russia produced more than 10
million b/d during August, setting a
new post-Soviet era record, EIA said.
It expects non-OPEC production to
grow by about 250,000 b/d in 2010,
with higher output from the FSU and
the US offsetting falling production
in Mexico and the North Sea.
OPEC production averaged 29 million b/d in the first three quarters,

er the consequences of failing to act.”
Two witnesses warned that economic harm could be substantial, especially
if other countries don’t take similar
steps. Others emphasized jobs and revenue in a transition to a lower-carbon
energy system.

Among initial assessments by committee members, Charles E. Grassley
(R-Iowa), the ranking minority member, said, “An honest cost assessment
requires us to acknowledge that there
would be no economic benefit for
Americans from it, at least initially.”
Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said that his
state has supported renewable energy
development for some time and that
investments have been based on market
forces.
Kansas ranks ninth in oil production
and eighth in gas production among US
states and has three small refineries that
contribute jobs and money to nearby
communities, he noted.
“Under the bill which some said
was railroaded out of the Environment
and Public Works Committee last week,
officials in these communities have told
me they would suffer significant job
and economic losses,” Roberts said.
In comments submitted to the committee, the National Petrochemical and
Refiners Association cited an Energy
Policy Research Foundation Inc. study
earlier this month that said even before
US refiners face higher costs from
carbon emissions they would face a
higher cost structure and increased international competition, which would
threaten to close 2.5 million b/d of the
existing 17.5 million b/d of US refining
capacity.
But Kerry said comprehensive climate change legislation would create
jobs. He dismissed reports such as
the one cited by NPRA saying, “Your
studies aren’t credible because you
haven’t considered the impacts of
inaction.”
He said, “What business people like

Duke Energy, are telling me is that if we don’t do
anything, countries like China, which is tripling
its wind energy investment, are going to leave us
behind.”
He questioned a statement by Kenneth P. Green, a
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute
for Public Policy Research (AEI), that a cap-and-trade
system would be an inappropriate greenhouse gas
control tool that would cause economic damage, cost
jobs, and provide little environmental benefit.
“Legislation now before Congress will create
regional winners and losers,” Green said. “Cap-andtrade creates a poorly understood financial instrument, which will increase debt. As biofuels gain
favor, more agricultural farmland will be converted
to fuel from food production.”
Margo Thorning, senior vice-president and chief
economist at the American Council for Capital
Formation, said a reason economic assessments of
cap-and-trade’s potential impacts reach such differing
conclusions is that some use input-output models and
others rely on macroeconomic assessments, which
she said most government and think-tank analysts
prefer because they can show impacts on capital markets and other economic components.
“Macroeconomic studies show significant costs,”
she maintained. “As [the US Environmental Protection Agency] and others have admitted, the environmental benefits will be almost nil if the US goes it
alone.”

Acid rain comparison
Baucus warned against predicting dire economic
consequences from new cap-and-trade policies,
pointing to the cap-and-trade system established
by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which
he helped write, to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions
related to acid rain.
During debate on that bill, he said, several industry studies made dire predictions about potential
economic effects and job losses. EPA studies even
estimated $2.7-4 billion of annual costs and predicted
that 13,000-16,000 coal-mining jobs would disappear
as a result of the program. A decade later, he said, an
EPA analysis estimated the cost at $1-2 billion/year
and job losses at one-fourth the predictions.
“About 95% of the jobs lost were due to productivity gains in the industry,” Baucus said. “Very few
were lost due to the acid rain program itself.”
AEI’s Green said the acid rain program was much
smaller than a cap-and-trade operation for carbon
dioxide would be.
“In acid rain, you had a smaller number of players

The final costs turned out to be lower
because early problems led to changes
in the system,” he said.
When Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.)
asked whether derivative market loopholes should be closed before a carbon
allowance system was established, the
AEI analyst said they should. “We’re
talking about a huge amount of the
energy economy which would be put
into these securities. If they are not

sustainable, the government will burst
the bubble, and it would be a very big
bubble,” Green said.
Other witnesses said federal lawmakers should consider which forms
of energy would work best in creating jobs during a transition to lowercarbon sources. Carol Berrigan, energy
infrastructure director at the Nuclear
Energy Institute, said construction of
nuclear plants would create tens of

thousands of jobs.
Abraham Breehey, legislative director at the International Brotherhood of
Boilermakers, Iron Shipbuilders, Blacksmiths, Forgers, and Helpers, said coal
with carbon capture and sequestration
and nuclear expansion have higher job
potential than natural gas.

only by 17% in the 450 Scenario due
to more efficient use, lower electricity
demand, and increased switching to
nonfossil energy sources.
IEA expects the boom in North
American unconventional gas production together with the recession’s
impact on demand to prolong the glut
of gas supply for the next few years.
“The analysis of WEO 2009 shows
that the annual underutilization of
interregional pipeline and LNG capacity could rise from around 60 billion
cu m in 2007 to 200 billion cu m by
2015. This glut could have far-reaching
consequences for the structure of gas
markets, with suppliers to Europe and
Asia-Pacific coming under pressure to
modify pricing terms under long-term
contracts, to delink gas prices from
oil prices, (to) sell more gas on a spot
basis, and to cut prices to stimulate
demand,” IEA said. ✦

IPAA advocates fact-based hydraulic fracturing study
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
The Independent Petroleum Association of America will work to ensure
that an upcoming study on hydraulic
fracturing is scientific, based on facts,
and includes input from the oil and gas
industry as well as state regulators.
Various speakers at IPAA’s annual
meeting in New Orleans discussed the
attention and concerns raised by some
members of Congress and some environmental groups about fracing and its
safety.
Water management issues have
come into play because of suggestions
by some industry critics that fracing

W i r e l e s s

chemicals might get into ground water.
There has been no definitive evidence
of that in various studies that have been
done.
On Oct. 29, the US House of Representatives and US Senate approved a
Department of Interior appropriations
bill that includes a provision directing
the Environmental Protection Agency
to produce another study on hydraulic
fracturing.
IPAA Chairman Bruce Vincent,
president of Swift Energy Co., Houston,
said no such study is necessary. Fracing
is crucial to recovering gas from shale
plays.
Vincent noted that state regulators
have successfully monitored fracing

operations for 60 years. He said ongoing congressional efforts to impose
federal regulations could result in extensive, costly monitoring of chemicals
throughout the life of a well.
“It’s the environmentalists wanting
a way to further regulate our business,”
Vincent said. “Antidevelopment movements based on misinformation and
scare tactics cannot delay or deter the
responsible development of American
resources,” he said.
Vincent said other principal policy
priorities for IPAA are resisting tax
changes as proposed in US President
Barack Obama’s 2010 budget. The
Obama administration has proposed
repealing numerous tax provisions,

including percentage depletion and
intangible drilling costs.
“There is still serious concern about
the direction of energy policy in this
country,” Vincent said, adding, “It’s
clear to me that policy battles will
remain front and center.”
Other areas of concern are increased
oversight and regulation of financial
markets along with gaining access to
more oil and gas off the US, Vincent
said.

Chemical disclosures
Lee O. Fuller, IPAA’s vice-president
of government relations, told OGJ on
the sidelines of the IPAA meeting that
he has never seen “an environmental
issue with less substance behind it” as
concerns about fracing chemicals contaminating ground water.
Well completions create a barrier
around the wellbore to prevent the
leeching of any chemicals, Fuller said,
noting that industry has been doing
this successfully for decades.
“There’s been no history of prob-

lems with hydraulic fracturing,” Fuller
said. “It is a very orchestrated effort
to try to diminish production.” He
believes “people historically opposed to
developing natural gas” are raising the
concerns.
Some groups have called for oil
and gas companies to disclose the
chemicals that they use in fracturing.
Most producers resist that, saying the
chemical mixtures are proprietary
information.
IPAA does not believe that companies should have to disclose the chemicals, Fuller said. If analysis were to
show chemicals from a specific oil and
gas operation getting into water, then
IPAA would support getting the chemical information to regulators who could
supply it to first responders, he said.

Industry comments
Separately from the IPAA meeting,
Oklahoma City independent Chesapeake Energy Corp. issued an Oct. 28
news release saying that it supports
efforts by the state of New York to

require fracing vendors to register their
products and disclose the chemicals
used.
Chesapeake already has posted
its fracing chemical mixture on the
company web site, Chesapeake Chief
Executive Officer Aubrey A. McClendon said.
“We fully support setting high environmental standards for the extraction
of natural gas from the Marcellus shale,
and we look forward to continuing
that process with the state,” McClendon
said.
On Oct. 23, Schlumberger Ltd.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Andrew Gould said he expects to see
more US drilling regulations, and he
supports discussing disclosure of fracing ingredients.
“I’m pretty sure that there will be
some form of new regulation in order
to satisfy the authorities and the public’s desire to know that what is being
done is safe,” Gould said during an Oct.
23 webcast on Schlumberger’s quarterly
earnings. ✦

Study: Cooperation key to growth in oil sands supply
Although the oil sands industry
will continue to develop in Alberta
despite the jolt it received when oil
prices plunged last year, total Canadian
oil exports to the US face constraints,
according to a study by the Center for
Global Energy Studies, London, and
Geopolitics Central, Calgary.
Oil sands production will increase
by 1.19-1.99 million b/d during 200920, depending on the degree of economic and environmental cooperation
among major countries, the study says.
Cooperation extensive enough to
keep the global recession relatively
short and ensure strong and lasting
growth afterward would support oil
prices and enable oil sands production
in Alberta to rise from 1.21 million b/d
in 2008 to 3.2 million b/d in 2020.
The production growth in that
scenario would occur despite high costs
32

related to economic strength in Alberta
and rising outlays for environmental
mitigation, the study says.
In an alternative scenario, competition among major economic powers
prolongs the recession, leads China
and Russia to challenge Western powers for dominance, and produces a
second economic dip in 2010 with
subsequent growth slower than in the
recent past.
In the lower-growth scenario, oil
prices below those in the alternative
set of assumptions restrict growth in
Albertan oil sands production in 2020
to 2.4 million b/d. The increase occurs
because of projects in progress, lower
costs, and gradually rising oil prices.
The study notes a preference by
project operators for upgrading of
bitumen outside Alberta because of
cost advantages elsewhere. But in the

higher-growth scenario, the provincial
government legislates that new projects
by 2015 upgrade all bitumen in Alberta.
In the lower-growth scenario, this isn’t
an option because light-heavy price differentials are too narrow.
As a result, 82% of new bitumen
production is upgraded in Alberta with
high growth, half that amount with
lower growth.
The main market for incremental oil
sands supply through 2020 is Northeast
Asia, where refineries prefer lighter
grades of crude.
In the low-growth scenario, the
main market for new oil sands supply
is the US, chiefly the eastern Midwest.
But total exports to the US are limited
to “a relatively small increase” by a
“relatively large decline” in Canada’s
conventional oil production, the study
says. ✦

FACTS: Abu Dhabi needs gas for domestic market
Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
Abu Dhabi currently imports 740
MMscfd of natural gas from Qatar via
the Dolphin Pipeline and likely would
buy more if the Qatari gas moratorium
were lifted, according to FACTS Global
Energy (FGE).
“The Dolphin Pipeline has extra
capacity of 1.2 bscfd,” FGE said in a
recent report. “If the Qatari gas moratorium is lifted, the UAE would be an
easy source of incremental exports if
the price is right. Given that Abu Dhabi
is developing high-cost domestic gas
and considering using oil for power
generation, there is likely an increasing
willingness to pay higher gas prices.”
In 2005 Qatar—third-largest gas
producer in the world behind Russia
and Iran—placed a moratorium on additional gas development projects at its
massive offshore North field, pending
results of a study of the field’s reservoirs that is not expected to be completed until after this year. That means
that no new projects are likely to be
signed before 2010, said FGE.
Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi is the largest
gas producer in the UAE with production of 4 bscfd of gas for sale.
Abu Dhabi has several new projects pending that could produce large
amounts of gas, condensate, or other
gas liquids in 2010-15. However, some
of that gas will be reinjected into the
Emirate’s oil fields. Some 1.4 bscfd of
gas currently is reinjected into Abu
Dhabi’s oil fields to maintain oil production levels.

a result of the expanding local, petrochemical, and industrial projects.

Shah gas development
Development of ultra-sour gas
reserves in Shah gas field is the most
expensive gas project in the UAE and
is expected to produce only 500-600
MMscfd of gas for new industries, power generation, or reinjection into the oil
fields, said FGE. ADNOC selected ConocoPhillips to develop the field. That
involves drilling 20 wells plus construction of necessary infrastructure,
with gas scheduled to start flowing by
first-quarter 2015.
Development cost is estimated as
high as $10 billion, making it the
country’s largest and most expensive
nonassociated gas project. Through
development of Shah’s gas reserves,
roughly 1 bscfd of raw gas, 1.6 million
tpy of NGL, 30-40,000 b/d of condensate, and 3.4 million tpy of sulfur will
be produced. After gas treatment, 500600 MMscfd of dry gas could be available for domestic market or reinjection
purposes.
ADNOC wants to proceed with
development of Hail and Bab sour gas
fields. Hail gas field is expected to
add an extra 400-600 MMscfd of gas,
while Bab would produce 1.3 bscfd of
gas. However, Abu Dhabi has not yet
awarded EPC contracts to develop these
fields, and these projects are unlikely
to come on stream before 2015-16, said
FGE. ✦

Gabon to launch 40block licensing round
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Gabon will launch an oil licensing round for more
than 40 blocks from two of its deepwater basins in May
2010, according to an official at CGGVeritas.
The licensing round, which will close in November
2010, says Steve Toothill, CGGVeritas chief geologist, is
a deepwater round, with attention on subsalt plays.
Gabon presents a vast unexplored basin and drilling so far has been only above the salt, according to
Toothill, who said his firm has seen some large structures below the salt where there is large potential.
CGGVeritas, which has been hired to advise the
government on promotion of the licensing round,
purchased 12,000 km of seismic data and reprocessed
much existing data. Some companies, all deepwater
players, have already signed up to buy data, Toothill
said.
Word of the licensing round comes as Gabon’s
production has fallen to 250,000 b/d from its peak of
371,000 b/d in 1997—apparently due to maturing fields
and a lack of new ones coming online.

Liquids production down
Analyst BMI said, “Following Brazil’s recent significant subsalt discoveries and Angola’s deepwater discoveries, Gabon will be hoping that its deepwater offshore
acreage holds similar potential.”
However, in its most recent Gabon Oil & Gas Report,
BMI forecasts that in 2008-18 the country’s oil and
gas liquids production will decrease by 3.95%, with
volumes peaking at 265,000 b/d in 2010, before falling steadily to 226,000 b/d by the end of the 10-year
forecast period.
BMI said Gabon’s oil consumption in 2008-18 is set
to increase by 56%, with growth slowing to an assumed 5%/year towards the end of the period and the
country using 21,000 b/d by 2018.
Gas production is expected to rise to 1 billion cu m
by the end of the forecast period, the analyst said. With
demand rising by 900% in 2008-18, BMI said, “there
should be a balanced market, with no need for imports
or scope for exports.”

reland’s planning authority, An
Bord Pleanala, has told Royal
Dutch Shell PLC it is dissatisfied
about the level of risk posed by the
planned Corrib gas pipeline.
The board said the proposed
high-pressure pipeline would run
too close to housing at Rossport and
between Glengad and Aughoose. It
is “unacceptable” that these houses
were within “the hazard range of the
pipeline if a failure should occur.”
The board said, “The design
documentation for the pipeline and
the quantified risk analysis provided
with the application does not present
a complete, transparent, and adequate demonstration that the pipeline
does not pose an unacceptable risk to
the public.”
The board asked Shell and partners Statoil Exploration and Vermilion Energy Trust to modify part of
the pipeline route, and provide more
information on the project.

Incomplete application
An Bord Pleanala’s ruling also
said the application could not be
approved because part of the application dealing with the pipeline section between chainage 83+390 and
chainage 83+400 was missing.
The board further noted that 5.64
km of the 9-km route was unacceptable because of its proximity to houses, its impact on local land value, and
insufficient plans to upgrade the road
network in the area.
The board gave the partners until
Feb. 5, 2010, to return with additional information on the safety of
the pipeline and its effect on the peat
bogs along the route.
The board also asked that the
36

route between chainages 83+910
and 89+550 be diverted to the Sruwaddacon estuary, a move which the
partners had ruled out earlier due to
environmental and technical considerations.
If these requests were complied
with by the deadline, the board said,
it would be “appropriate” to approve
the project.

Rethink needed
However, opponents of the Corrib
project suggested it is now time for
a complete rethink not only of its
safety but also of its basic economics.
“This is a clear vindication of the
stance that local people have taken
on health and safety grounds over
the last 10 years, and those concerns
will remain our top priority until
a resolution is found,” said John
Monaghan of the protest group Pobal
Chill Chomain.
“It is now time for a complete
rethink on the Corrib project by the
developers Shell and Statoil, and even
more importantly by Minister Eamon
Ryan and his department, within
whose remit the safety issues central
to the ongoing conflict clearly lie,”
Monaghan told Mayo News.
Sounding an altogether different
note was Maura Harrington of the
Shell to Sea protest group: “It is now
time for a proper economic debate
on the huge implications of this
giveaway.”
For its part, Shell was quoted as
saying: “In relation to the issue of
safety, the Corrib gas partners remain
firmly of the view that the pipeline,
as designed, is safe and meets all
international standards and industry
best practice.” ✦

uncertainty due to the death in June of
President Omar Bongo Ondimba, who
ruled almost unchallenged for 41 years.
“Political uncertainty is also expected to affect economic activity, as several
companies will delay their investments
until they are assured the country will
remain politically stable,” said the
Economist Intelligence Unit in a recent
report.
“In addition, despite the recent recovery in oil prices, there is still widespread uncertainty over the prospects
for oil prices and some companies will
delay investments until contractors’
costs have been significantly reduced,”
the EIU report said.
Meanwhile, largely on political
grounds, the Gabon government has
replaced its oil minister as part of a reshuffle following elections which were
necessitated by the death of the former
president.
Julien Onkogho is the new oil minister, replacing Casimir Oye Mba, who
had opposed the ruling party’s choice
of Ali Ben Bongo, the late president’s
son, as its candidate in the country’s
presidential elections. Ali Ben Bongo
claimed victory in September. ✦

The GSC’s conclusion was that the
recovered alkanes
correlated mostly,
if not wholly,
with soil lithology, were most
likely generated
in soils, and were
not microseepages

subsurface.
The report’s

hydrocarbons
to only pop out
of microseepages, but studies
indicate that they, too, may originate in
near surficial sediments.
One likely reason for the recent
appearance of aromatics in shallow
sediments (and so-called biogenic gas)
is the emergence of instruments that
allow detection in parts per billion.
To circumvent this problem we first
determine, in the field, the background
level of aromatics, and then know that
the soil-air aromatics we sample mostly
derive from microseepages.
Two types of commercial aromatic
hydrocarbons geochemistry were available. One requires burying traps in
soil for 3 weeks before analyzing their
catch; the other detects benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene directly
in soil-air.
Our tests were conducted on the
axis of the collapse chimney of our first
discovery in Dickinson (Fig. 13). The
chimney, offset from the contamination of surface production facilities,
offers a perfect testing ground.
Conoco used seismic to site its verti-

cal No. 1 dry hole. No. 2, a directional
reentry from No. 1 and entirely based
on our A II, hit the reef and had an
1,800 b/d IP. No. 3 was drilled in defiance of A II vehement prediction of a
dry hole. This well missed the reef core
and hit the tight flank, as did No. 1. An
attempt to convert it into an injection
well was a complete failure, following
an immediate communication between
wells 2 and 3.
The “buried traps” aromatic geochemistry found that chimney and
background gave identical measurements. The other method using soil-air
aromatic geochemistry proved hugely
nonrepeatable.
Clearly, if we wanted the profiles of
Fig. 12 (they are actual A III geochemistry, published here for the first time),
somebody had to construct ad hoc
instruments and invent algorithms to
interpret their measurements.

Rudely, the field tests revealed three

hydrocarbon geochemistry useless.

Mobile equilibrium
The three aromatic gases benzene,
toluene, and ethylbenzene, sampled in
soil-air, are found between their melting and boiling temperatures.
This means that Le Chatelier mobile
equilibrium partitions them between
liquid and gaseous phases (alone
analyzed), which in turn means that

The Weyburn battery, built in the

Secondary recovery with field-water
injection commenced in the 1960s.
In 1997, EnCana and partners signed
a carbon-dioxide supply agreement
with Dakota Gasification Co. (DGC).
DGC is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Basin Electric and Power Cooperative of
Bismarck, ND, and owns and operates
the Great Plains Synfuels Plant.
A 323 km, 16-in. pipeline from Beulah ND conveys the CO2 to Weyburn,
Sask. Current CO2 delivery to Weyburn
is 125 MMscfd.
Oil production at the battery has
increased to 29,000 b/d and Encana

The required flow rate of the 82%
CO2, 0.6 specific gravity, dense-phase
recycle gas required 520 hp. Subsequently, the pump required upgrading
to a 600-hp motor.
To ensure pump redundancy and
ample capacity, the design required installation of two pumps per compressor
train. A programmable-logic controller controlled the pumps. One pump
operates at 100% capacity, while pump
suction pressure controls the other one
that had a VFD drive. Thus, the second
pump ensures a uniform compressor
throughput.
In addition, the design included

installation of heat exchangers to avoid
summer 43° C. gas off the third-stage
compression from bottlenecking the
Reda pump. Note that dense-phase
CO2 is very sensitive to temperature.
As temperature increases above 25° C.,
the specific gravity decreases rapidly,
thereby lowering the pump’s throughput volume. As the specific gravity
increases, the throughput increases and
the horsepower required increases also.

Based on compressor discharge

for the different CO2 concentrations of
the recycled gas that several conditions
would govern the pump suction.

Because of the curve under predicting the horsepower and flow rates,
EnCana decided to install two pumps
per train (a total of four pumps) with
600-hp motors on each.
As discussed previously EnCana also
decided to ensure a constant pump
temperature in the summer. It decided
to install heat exchangers as soon as
possible.
To minimize size constraints in the
battery, it selected a compact printedcircuit exchanger. The overall (flange
to flange in-out) dimensions of these
exchangers were 45-in. overall width
and 76-in. overall length
Fig. 4 shows the exchangers installed. An equivalent shell and tube
exchanger would have required two
stacked exchangers each consisting of
two 1,219 mm (4 ft) diameter by 13,176
mm (45 ft) long units (2 by 2 stacked
exchanger units).
Fig. 5 shows the heat-exchanger
profile. It assumes summer conditions with the DGC pipeline exchanger

gas inlet temperature of 5° C. and the
K-701 compressor cooler third-stage
outlet at 43° C. into the exchanger.
The process required installation
of inlet strainers upstream of both exchanger inlets because the exchangers
are susceptible to fouling. Inspection
of recycled and DGC gases shows them
to be extremely dirty on start-up. The
heat-exchanger strainers were worth
the investment but were extremely
time consuming to depressure and
clean.
Fig. 6 shows a single-train process
flow diagram. The material balance for
the summer conditions and a liquid
flow rate of 2,700 liquid cu m/day or
39 MMscfd of gas equivalent densephase CO2 was one of the key conditions evaluated. The main data for this
material balance are:
• Dense-phase recycled gas with
82% CO2 flowing at 39.3 MMscfd at an
ambient 43° C.
• DGC heat-exchanger gas flow at
42 MMscfd.

• An 8,460 kPa-g at 43° C. compressor third-stage discharge pressure.
The PFD-material balance shows the
three-stage compressor and coolers, the
Heatric printed-circuit heat exchanger,
and the Schlumberger REDA boosterpump stream data. The stream table
shows the critical parameters for ensuring that the design meets all required
process conditions.
One can check any condition of the
plant on the PFD material balance; for
example the Reda horsepower is 594
(stream hp-reda701). The most important stream is Stream 17, which shows
the process conditions before the pump
suction.
Stream 17 key parameters are:
• 39.3 MMscfd dense phase flow,
mostly CO2.
• 8,548 kPa-g at 24° C. pump inlet
pressure.
• 0.655 kg/cu m mass density.
From the above simulation results,
it is evident that any slight fluctuation

Total project cost was $9.928 million.
To understand the economic advantage of this project, following is a comparison of the cost of new compression
vs. the upgrade.
An installed cost of a reciprocal 4,000-hp compressor with a 25
MMscfd throughput is $26 million
compared with the $10 million cost
of a three-stage, one-train K701s with
REDA rated for a 39 MMsfd throughput.
The 4,000 hp compressor costs were
from a canceled project fully scoped
and bid for the Weyburn plant last year.
Total production increase for the two
trains was 28 MMscfd (2 × (39-25)).

Addition of the dense-phase pumps
and restaging compression added 28
MMscfd for a $10 million investment
vs. the $26 million of compression to
realize a 25 MMscfd gain. This translates to $0.36 million/MMscfd for
compressor restaging-pumps vs. $0.96
million/MMscfd for reciprocating
compression.

Schedule

tion to produce solutions while meeting operational needs.
The I3P project team found increased participation from various parts
of industry organizations to include
technical managers, IT staff, auditors,
and supervisory control and data acquisition managers. Feedback indicated
that, technical challenges aside, communication and investment justification
were two areas of particular concern
and interest to industry.
Linking cyber security to a business
investment is difficult. Making the case
for an investment to prevent something
bad from happening to a network or
architecture can be difficult.
Many industry members developed
their own strategies to justify spending on protection and awareness. These
included potential consequence cost
assessments and development of crosssegment risk analysis teams. Market
drops in the past few years affected
momentum that security had gained
early in the project. Reduced staffing,
increased workloads, limited training,
and shrinking travel budgets slowed the
major security efforts.
An interesting but beneficial consequence to these events, however,
was the broadening of communication
across different areas within industry
organization. For several years, the I3P
team has recommended strong communications across organizations.5 The
first workshop indicated that departments within the organization worked
at different paces and with different
objectives for security. A need to reconcile objectives, motivators, and application in operational segments became
evident.
At a time when resources are
strained, a need to maximize and
coordinate limited security budgets for
comprehensive solutions, technology,
and policy is evident. In 2008, the I3P
conducted its second SCADA Security
Forum in conjunction with the API IT
Security Conference. Overwhelming
feedback from industry at this event
suggested that technical staff and SCADA managers had a strong awareness of
54

cyber security and many had integrated
security into their operations.
Feedback suggested, however, that
a next step was needed to extend
this awareness to CEO and executive
management to ensure cyber security
was a major consideration in strategic
planning. These areas, in addition to
evolving technical options, are considered important pieces in the future of
securing infrastructure.

Technology advancements
In addition to outreach, methodology development, and risk characterization, the I3P project team researched
specific technologies and gathered
feedback from industry on its primary
needs. Early in the project, feedback
from workshops indicated several areas
that industry felt required focus:6
• Wireless.
• Intrusion detection.
• Situational awareness.
• Legacy and interoperability.
• Standards compliance.
• Business and control system network connectivity.
• Forensic data and traceability.
• Life-cycle maintenance, patching,
upgradability.
Some of these concerns, such as
interoperability and life-cycle issues,
are ongoing, but many new options are
available to assist asset owners. Over
the past few years, the market has seen
new technologies, products, and services erupt in this area.
Industry members may select component-level solutions, total consultant
solutions, or third-party membershipinformation portal services. The choice
typically boils down to what meets
an organization’s specific objectives,
funds, and the staffing resources available in-house.
Many industry members indicated
they do not want a component level,
“bump in the wire” solution. They also
strive for control and management of
cyber security, however, and attempt to
meet very specific security objectives.
Purchasing a comprehensive service
and solution seems less agreeable.

The reality is likely somewhere in
between and a mix of options. Regardless of how much an organization does
in-house or farms out, a comprehensive
operational approach is still the most
effective option. This includes:
• Assessment.
• Determination of risk.
• Identification of vulnerabilities.
• Analysis and application of mitigation.
• Support with policies and procedures.
• Development and utilization of a
life-cycle maintenance plan.
• Periodic assessments.
As is always recommended, an approach that includes people, processes,
and technologies best removes gaps in a
security solution.
Perhaps the greatest challenge is
system interconnection. This includes
all connectivity, such as the business
network to the control system network,
the connection of remote and field
sites, or the connection of simple sensors to the network.
Controlling the flow of data as well
as ensuring its integrity can certainly
benefit from technology-based solutions. Typically, however, an organization must still review its own operations to determine specific needs before
applying security to interconnection
points.
A one-size-fits-all technology cannot
be applied to disparate architectures.
Technology-based security controls,
along with supporting policies, however, can mitigate many risks. As an example, general architectural guidelines
and interconnectivity recommendations
can be found in API 1164 SCADA Security Standard for Pipelines.7 Encryption, intrusion monitoring, firewalls,
and role-based controls can provide the
technology that facilitates the architectural goals.
Industry is also interested in tools
that help it reduce risk while making
the business case. Market conditions at
present demand strong economic viability of technical solutions. A shift towards component-based solutions that

require lower up-front costs is visible
in the market today. Doing something
towards security, even a small improvement, provides some level of assurance
to some industry members rather than
taking risks and waiting until budgets
are stronger to address security.
Industry faces tough choices on how
to invest in security in a tough market.
Many more options exist today, however, than even a few years before in
terms of technology, tools, guidelines,
and methodologies that can help.
Industry is also now more aware of
cyber security and potential technical
and economic consequences, and it can
make more informed decisions based
on its own architectures and business
needs.

ing these challenges in the market and
the technological landscape. It can only
be anticipated that the elements of risk
will continue to evolve and at different
rates, which requires industry to focus
on preparedness rather than reaction
measures.
Great strides have been made in
securing infrastructure. The changing
elements of risk, however, prove that
we must continue to keep security in
focus as energy systems evolve to meet
the demands of the future.

Standards, guidelines
Early in the I3P project, industry and
vendors indicated that standards and
guidelines were necessary to facilitate
application of security solutions. In
efforts to ensure industry created those
guidelines, industry forums and bodies
stepped up to create guidance with a
security focus. Guidance took the form
of written standards, conferences and
workshops, and outreach efforts.
Members of industry frequently
point out that guidelines should be
developed to facilitate the application of
controls that support secure operations
rather than requiring large investments
of resources or redesigns that hinder
or slow operations. Working together,
such industry bodies as the American
Petroleum Institute, the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association,
and the Instrument Society of America
can ensure guidance is available that
provides a clear benefit to industry.
Standards that provide a backbone
for organizational and operational
policies are extremely beneficial. Consistently throughout the research on
the I3P project, the role of policy that
supports technology-based and operationally based security controls has
remained critical. The need to react accordingly to information during an incident, meet organizational objectives,
and ensure continuity of operations
relies heavily on policy and guidelines.
Many in industry have suggested
that cyber-security regulation will
only increase. The best preparation
for industry is to become involved in
establishing standards that may provide
a solid technical foundation for those
regulations while meeting operational
objectives. The rapid deployment of
new technologies within the smart-grid
environment and understanding how
fossil-energy systems may interconnect and interface in the future re-

quire preparation and analysis now to
maximize opportunity, support system

There are many challenges in standards development. Developing guidance that is not product or technology
specific that may date the document,
while providing enough detail to be
useful, can be difficult. The benefits
that industry brings from an operational view, business and practicality sense,
however, are extremely valuable. The
end result is typically a useful product
and a positive experience.
Often in this competitive market,
cyber or operational information is not
readily shared. Complete security incident data will likely never be openly
shared for obvious reasons. Industry
members, however, have been very
willing to participate in developing
guidance, brainstorming on protective
measures, sharing ideas, and participating in industry-wide events. A continued commitment to these activities will
ensure that security in this sector will
continue to evolve throughout lifecycle, market, and global changes.

Market effects
Many events, certainly those with
the magnitude of Sept. 11, 2001, affect
the culture, technology, and business
investments of the energy industry.
Certainly, the market changes over the
past 5 years have affected all areas. The
shift from large budgets, expansions,
and new ideas, to tighter belts, critical
decisions, and reductions has affected
the focus on security and survivability.
Examples are:
• Tough choices on spending while
maintaining operational and business
objectives.
• The need to rank main goals and
prioritize objectives.
• Choosing solutions wisely, such as
robust all-in-one technology solutions
vs. piecemeal tools and applications at a
lower cost.
• Utilization of staff resources. Can
a dedicated security staff be afforded?
What about training budgets?
• Participation in industry forums,
maximizing information sharing and
lessons learned in cyber security.
In times of tighter budgets, a few
overarching ideas about security can be
applied to maximize the investment of

time and money.
These include:
• Define an
approach up front,
before application
of new security
controls.
• Rank priorities.
• Balance a
lower cost operational security option with technology choices.
• Select an approach that does
not include a large
system redesign
with hardware,
software, and staff
resource implications.
• Identify and
address high-value

targets first.
• Minimize major gaps and address
“low hanging fruit” that provides a
good return on resource investment.
• Consider the life cycle and longterm costs and return on investment.
These can be tough to define but attempt to weigh the risks.
• Consider a perspective that includes cyber security as another critical
operational element.
• Define the role of people, processes, and technology.
• Utilize research, technical guidance, and standards to help.
• Convey organizational objectives
and maintain good intraorganizational
communication.
The oil and gas industry has survived many market changes over many
decades. One can expect approaches on
technology, operations, and cyber security to continue to adapt to continuous
market changes in the future.

Given the changes in the market and
industry over the past several years, one

longer term. Several infrastructure-scale
areas will be relevant when addressing
cyber security in the next few years.
The accompanying diagram illustrates
the presence of risk and interconnected
areas.
• Emerging technologies. These are
adaptive technologies that facilitate protection, detection, response, and decision making. Combining protection and
response is particularly attractive and
presents a good return on investment.
• Integration with renewable energy
systems. Many are now focusing on
the inclusion of solar, wind, and other
renewable energy sources in their
systems and operations. Industry is also
currently engaged in discussions on the
role and impact of smart grid in the oil
and gas infrastructure.
• Emerging standards and regulation. New policies and regulations that
focus on cyber security may emerge
that could include technical and operational guidelines. Traditionally, these
standards and regulations focused on
safety, but cyber security may be considered, just as physical security, as an
operational element.
• Market changes. Adaptability of
security implementations, including
technology and operations, may be
the key to surviving market changes.
Balancing available budgets with short
and long-term needs, as well as carving
out the role of security in the future of
the organization is important.
• Changing work force. Many discussions are under way within industry
on how to deal with a changing workforce and the retirement of those with
critical skill sets. Operational learning curves and lack of experience can
lead to an unintentional incident from
a trusted insider. Conversely, awareness of emerging technologies among
younger workers through recent education can be an advantage.
A great deal of research exists, lessons learned from global events, and
shared experiences that can be built
upon to ensure secure critical infrastructure. Understanding potential
threats, vulnerabilities, consequences,

and effects is essential to moving forward with continued risk mitigation.
Maintenance that includes continual
reduction in vulnerabilities is required
for a company to stay abreast of new
security risks and meet the needs of a
changing infrastructure. Recommendations for the future include broadening
the view of cyber security to include
emerging technologies such as advanced situational awareness tools or
renewable energy components. Increased interconnection and interoperability can also be expected and will
require cyber-security considerations
throughout a system’s life-cycle.
An increased need for a return on
investment from cyber security and its
role in business strategies is expected.
This requires that cyber security be
continually recognized as a key organizational objective, a thread that
must exist through staffing, market,
and organizational changes. Successful,
uninterrupted operations can continue
with the perspective that security has a
permanent role in the organization.

requirements, and is special purpose
shipping code compliant—to meet PRP
II’s timeframe.
Eclipse measures 130 m long, 32 m
wide, and has a hull depth of 8.5 m.
The vessel can handle pipe diameters
between 6-in. and 60-in. OD, and has
two 60-tonne pipe tensioners. Eclipse is
fitted with a 300-tonne pedestal crane

and 117-m wide. The dynamically
positioned vessel will have a topsides
lift capacity of 48,000 tons and a jacket
lift capacity of 25,000 tons. Two portal
cranes at Pieter Schelte’s stern will
lift jackets by means of a tilting beam
system, allowing tilting of the jacket
into a horizontal position on the ship’s
deck. The vessel’s pipelay tension of
2,000 tons will double Allsea’s Solitaire, with the company describing
Pieter Schelte as the world’s largest
pipelay vessel.
The ship has a top speed of 14 knots,
accommodation for 577, and can lay
pipe of 6-68 in. OD in a near-vertical
orientation off its 175-m stinger. Pieter
Schelte’s welding facilities include a
double joint factory with five lineup
stations and two stations for combined internal and external welding.
They also include a mainline with six
welding stations for double joints, one
non-destructive testing station, and six
coating stations.
Allseas will pitch the vessel for
large-diameter pipeline installations,
and the company says its lift capacity will position it well for North Sea
decommissioning work. Allseas says
Pieter Schelte’s movements in a 10-ft
sea are smaller than those of a comparable semisubmersible vessel, despite
its twin traditional-hull design. Allseas’

initial cost estimates for the vessel were
$1.7 billion.
Heerema Marine Contractors is
designing its own $1-billion Class III
DP deepwater construction vessel. The
ship will be 220-m long and 88-m
wide, with a maximum speed claimed
by Heerema of up to 20 knots, roughly
four-times that of its current fleet.
Heerema’s vessel will include facilities
for 550 people, upgradable to 750, with
a payload capacity of 25,000 tonnes and
a dual crane capacity of 15,000 tonnes.
Its J-lay tower, with 2,000-mt tension,
will install pipe of up to 32-in. OD at
depths of 200-3,500 m.
Heerema designed the vessel particularly for offshore construction in the
Arctic, locating its cranes, J-lay tower,
and other installation equipment so as
to minimize the effect of the Arctic environment on operations. The vessel’s
hull and thrusters were also designed
to withstand conditions likely to be
encountered in environments such as
the Barents Sea and Beaufort Sea, both
of which Heerema has targeted as areas
for future growth.
Heerema planned to have the vessel
in service in 2010, but this schedule appears to have slipped. ✦

New geologic interpretation tool for upstream operations
StratEarth 2009 is a new upstream program designed to bridge the gap between
seismic and geological interpretation.
Offered as an add-on to SeisEarth,
StratEarth provides an integrated geological correlation and cross-section environment for evaluating and assessing reservoirs for better well positioning and field
management.
StratEarth incorporates geologic and
seismic data to facilitate advanced work
flows that support exploration and development projects from initial interpretation
to advanced subsurface modeling. The software suite enables users to automatically
correlate hundreds of wells and quickly
detect any inconsistencies between seismic
data, petrophysical data, well markers, and
geological data in markers positions and
orders.
The suite provides users with intuitive
interfaces to facilitate common work-flow
elements and data analysis tools. It also
offers seamless interoperability with SKUA

2009, a subsurface modeling software,
enabling rapid construction of geologically
valid, simulator-ready reservoir models
from all available data.

Shrinking to grow:
Is Conoco plan a
model for industry?
Although one company doesn’t represent a whole industry, a shrink-to-grow
strategy adopted by ConocoPhillips illustrates pressures on the biggest operators
in a world of shrinking opportunity.
ConocoPhillips has disclosed plans to
cut capital spending next year to $11 billion from $12.5 billion this year and $14-15
billion in earlier years and to sell properties in 2010-11 worth $10 billion.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

“We will be somewhat smaller,” said
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim
Mulva in an Oct. 28 conference call.
Mulva noted recessionary effects on
credit markets and said diminishing access
to large opportunities “is and will continue
to be quite an issue.”
Capital spending will target development of ConocoPhillips’s 50 billion boe of
oil and gas resources, Mulva said. Of next
year’s outlay, 90% will be upstream, with
no pullback from exploration. The 10%
downstream investment will be for maintenance “and not really much for growth.”
Disposition targets include ConocoPhillips’s 9% interest in the Syncrude oil sands
operation in Alberta; 10% of its North
American upstream interests; US pipelines
and terminals; and interests in the southern North Sea, mainly gas.
Mulva said refineries aren’t part of the
sales program because “it is not a very
good market to part with or sell refineries.”
Asked about four of the company’s
largest projects, Mulva made only one, an
Australian coalbed methane and LNG joint
venture with Origin Energy, sound immune
to change.
He said spending probably will be
deferred on an upgrade of the 260,000-b/d
refinery in Wilhelmshaven, Germany.
And decisions will be made next year
about a venture with Abu Dhabi National
Oil Co. to develop sour gas and condensate in giant Shah field and another with
Saudi Aramco to build a 400,000 b/d refinery in Yanbu.
While “essentially shrinking to grow,”
Mulva said, ConocoPhillips mainly is
reorienting toward returns and away from
growth.
He said international companies face a
changing business model.
“How do they participate in work with
national oil companies and sovereigns
with respect to this issue of access and
development of returns?” he asked. “If it is
not there, well, then obviously the companies will get somewhat smaller.”

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

DB: Markets are between recessions
The recession appears to have ended in June, “although not officially declared
yet,” said analysts with Deutsche Bank AG, London. But before rejoicing spreads
throughout the world economy, the bank’s analysts warn another recession is
coming in just 3 years, making the period in between “one of the shortest economic expansions in the last 55 years.”
Deutsche Bank analysts explained, “Historically, the beginning of the end for
US gross domestic product growth comes as soon as the Federal Reserve starts to
embark on a new monetary tightening cycle. Over the past 50 years the duration of
every US expansion has been directly proportional to the amount of time the Fed
provides monetary stimulus to the economy.”
For example, they said, “When we first presented this analysis in January 2005, we
stated the next US recession would begin in December 2007. This reflected the fact
that the US left recession in November 2001, but it was not until June 2004, 32 months
later, that the Fed started to raise interest rates. Based on the historical correlation, a
prime rate lag of 32 months would imply an economic expansion of 72 months.”
Bank officials said, “Since our US economics team expects the Fed to embark
on a new monetary tightening cycle in August 2010, and if we assume the US
recession ended in June 2009, then it would imply a prime rate lag of 14 months.”
Based on the historical correlation this would imply “an economic expansion of
just 40 months,” with another recession starting in November 2012.
Volatile prices
Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank analysts said, “We believe the next decade may herald a significantly more volatile macroeconomic environment than we have seen
in the past. However, given the significant provision of liquidity by the US Fed,
concerns over a double-dip next year are probably misplaced.”
They said, “For the time being we remain optimistic that US GDP growth will
continue to surprise to the upside. However, our concerns have focused on the
risks that with a weak housing sector and labor market, the US economy may be
challenged when the benefits of the fiscal stimulus start to fade.” They expect the
fiscal stimulus to “work against growth” in 2011.
“This may not cause the US difficulties given the provision of unlimited central
bank liquidity by the Fed,” analysts said. “In fact we believe central banks have
created the conditions for another minibubble to form in financial asset prices
heading into next year.” Global oil demand began to improve in the second quarter
but is still running at a slightly negative rate on a year-over-year in the current
quarter. “We expect this situation to improve dramatically in the first quarter [of
2010] with oil demand up at least 1 million b/d and possibly as much as 1.5 million
b/d,” said Deutsche Bank analysts. The remaining quarters of 2010 should show
relatively steady improvement “of about the same absolute amount,” they said.
Inventory imbalance
Meanwhile, imbalances in the US oil market have been sorting themselves out
“very slowly indeed,” said Paul Horsnell, managing director and head of commodities research at Barclays Capital in London.
A key part of that adjustment is the “winnowing away” of the crude overhang.
“Producers have had to constrain supplies enough so that reductions in refinery
runs have been covered by lower imports in such a way as not to further bloat
inventories,” he reported the first week of November.
Horsnell said, “However, beyond that reduction, an even greater degree of import compression has been needed to get the overhang to fall simultaneously with
lower runs. In the latest data release [for the week ended Oct. 30], the US crude
overhang (i.e., the amount of inventory above 5-year average levels) fell to 21.5
million bbl, the lowest this year.”
Horsnell noted, “The crude overhang peaked at the end of April at close to 50 million bbl, had shown signs of ballooning out again in August, but has been brought
back into line more sharply in recent weeks. Since the peak was reached, the reduction in US crude oil inventories relative to the 5-year average has averaged 150,000
b/d. That is not a very fast rate of overall improvement, but having been sustained
over more than 6 months the cumulative effect has now become significant.”
In terms of international demand, he said, “Gasoline and North America remain
strong, while Europe and diesel remain weak.” Middle East demand is surging,
with Saudi Arabian demand “a very strong dynamic.”

COVER
Workers install an ultralow-sulfur diesel reactor on its foundation
within the existing diesel hydrotreater unit at Alon USA Energy
Inc.’s 70,000 b/d refinery in Big Spring,Tex. Addition of this new
reactor, installed in series with an existing reactor unit, more than
doubled the catalyst used in the process.The company, a subsidiary
of Alon Israel Oil Co. Ltd., also is considering building a biodiesel
plant at that facility. Industry analysts say more supplies of
low-sulfur diesel is needed in virtually every area of the world. See
related story on diesel supply and demand on p. 20.

General

Interest

ConocoPhillips concerned about Orinoco work
ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Officer James Mulva said he is
concerned about his company’s heavy-oil production operations in
Venezuela’s Orinoco region.
His comment came in answer to questions from reporters on
Mar. 1 during a Rice University Baker Institute conference on national oil companies.
Mulva was asked about Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez’s recent comments that he has decreed that state-owned Petroleos de
Venezuela SA take majority control of Orinoco projects by May 1.
Such a move could have “commercial and operating implications for heavy oil,” Mulva said, noting that international oil companies have made massive investments there.
“It’s important for us to start our discussions with the ministry and PDVSA,” Mulva said, adding that it was “premature” to
speculate on the possible outcome. “Obviously, there have been
significant changes in Venezuela over the last several years.” Since
last year, the Venezuelan government has been negotiating with
international consortia operating in the Orinoco area, seeking a
PDVSA majority stake in each project (OGJ, Jan. 15, 2007, p. 41).
Joint ventures of PDVSA with ExxonMobil Corp., Chevron Corp.,
ConocoPhillips, Total SA, BP PLC, and Statoil ASA produce about
600,000 b/d of tar-like Orinoco crude. PDVSA currently holds an
average 40% stake in these ventures.
Except for Mulva’s comments, the international oil companies
have declined to comment until they have further details.

Saudis plan $95 billion capacity upgrades to 2015
Saudi Arabia plans to invest $95 billion to develop its oil and
natural gas industry over the coming 4-8 years, according to the
Kingdom’s advisor to the oil minister.
“Saudi Arabia plans to invest $70 billion to increase its oil and
gas production capacity until 2015 and invest $25 billion to increase its refining capacity before 2011,” said Majid Al Moneef,
advisor to Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi, in a speech at the Jeddah
Economic Forum. Al Moneef also confirmed previously announced
plans to increase the country’s upstream output capacity to 12.5
million b/d by 2009 from the current 11.3 million b/d output
level, as well as to step up downstream refining capacity by some
50% to 6 million b/d.
Al Moneef said he expected developing nations, especially those

in Asia, to spur 85% of new demand for oil over the next 25 years.
He said, “We will see increasing oil roles coming from OPEC and
Middle Eastern countries.”

Indonesia to boost gas output to offset deﬁcit
Indonesia expects a natural gas production shortage of some
300 MMscf for 2007 and must increase production to meet its
projected demand of 8.7 bcf, said Energy and Mineral Resources
Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro during a meeting with members of
the country’s House of Parliament.
However, he said the country has no plans to terminate existing
natural gas export contracts
Luluk Sumiarso, director general for oil and gas at the Ministry
of Energy and Mineral Resources said Indonesia has sufficient reserves of gas to meet domestic needs as well as export contracts but
he did not explain how the country would service the projected
shortfall.
Luluk spoke in reference to forecasts of Indonesia’s long-term
gas supply and needs, a “gas balance” drawn up by the government
to help determine its future export policy. According to Purnomo,
the national gas balance for 2007 shows a supply of 8.4 bcf, and
demand of 8.7 bcf, creating the deficit.
Last year Indonesia produced a total of 8.217 bcf, of which
about 54% was exported, with the remaining 46% sold on the
domestic market.
But a shortage of gas due to declining output in 2006 prevented
the government from fully meeting its export commitments to
overseas buyers, while this year the government has already cut
LNG exports by 19% to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.
It will not export gas to neighboring Malaysia and Singapore
beyond current contracts, because of its need to meet rising domestic demand (OGJ Online, Mar. 1, 2007).
During the meeting in parliament, the government announced
a number of moves to deal with the problem, including incentives
to boost production from existing fields and accelerate the development of new onshore and offshore fields.
Purnomo, who provided no details of the proposed incentives,
said there is no other way forward for the country except to increase production of natural gas in the near future.
The government has set a goal increasing gas output by 30%
by 2009. ✦

area as part of a project to draw gas from the hydrate.
As a result of the find, METI said it will broaden the scope of its
exploratory efforts in Japan’s coastal seabeds, which are thought to
hold substantial deposits of methane hydrate that as yet cannot be
produced economically.
Last October METI announced new efforts in Canada to develop
technologies associated with the development of methane hydrate.
Starting in December, METI and JOGM planned to conduct methane production tests in northwestern Canada with the Canadian
government.
Following the drilling of an exploratory well in Canada’s Arctic
Circle on Feb. 23, JOGM said Feb. 27 it will start test-production of
gas from methane hydrate in the permafrost area this month.
Depending on the outcome, Japan expects to start trial exploitation of methane hydrate deposits from the Pacific Ocean floor in
2009 with the hope of beginning commercial output from 2017.
The US, Canada, and Germany are all studying ways to use
methane hydrate. In February, BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. successfully drilled a research well on the Alaska North Slope in partnership with the US Department of Energy and the US Geological
Survey to collect samples and gather knowledge about the potential
gas source.
Drilling crews and research team members collected about 430
ft of core samples, which will be distributed to US-based gas hydrate researchers.

Caracas, Trinidad reach border ﬁelds accord
Trinidad and Tobago has approved a framework agreement for
the unitization of hydrocarbon reserves in offshore fields bordering the Caribbean twin-island nation and Venezuela. It is the first
such cross-border initiative in the Americas and one of only eight
worldwide.
After 4 years of negotiations, there has been agreement at the
technical level for the exploitation of reserves in the offshore Plata-

Drilling

&

forma Deltana area, said Trinidad and Tobago Minister of Energy
Lenny Saith.
Saith said the first field to be jointly produced would be Loran-Manatee, which contains 10 tcf of gas. It has been agreed that
in Loran-Manatee, Venezuela owns 7.3 tcf, while 2.7 tcf is on the
Trinidad side of the border.
Chevron Corp. is the operator of Loran, while it partners with
BG Group in Manatee field.
The treaty focuses on general provisions, exploitation of crossborder hydrocarbon resources, and establishment of a committee
for implementing the treaty, the applicable law, and final provisions.
The treaty provides for determination and allocation of the reserves volumes, the way in which costs and benefits from the unitization will be distributed, and the construction, operation, and
use of installations related to the project.
The agreement also provides for construction of a cross-border
pipeline.
Each state will continue to exercise civil, administrative, and
criminal jurisdiction over the various areas that fall within the
treaty.
Parties will settle disputes by negotiation through the respective
steering teams and a ministerial committee from each country, e.g.,
the ministerial teams will decide what the states will do with the
gas reserves.
Although the agreement will have indefinite life, either party
may terminate it.
Saith said no decision has been made as to where Manatee gas
will go, but Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela will exploit the reserves “as partners” and make whatever decisions were in the best
interest of each country.
It is expected that the treaty will be signed in Caracas later this
month when Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez is scheduled to
hold energy talks with Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Patrick
Manning. ✦

Output is 320 MMcfd of syngas, further refined into 270 MMscfd
of pipeline-grade hydrogen, and as much as 12,500 tonnes/day of
high-quality CO2.
The Dodds-Roundhill coal gasification project would be Canada’s first commercial coal gasification application. Sherritt and the
Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan are 50-50 partners in the developer,
Carbon Development Partnership. CDP owns or has the rights to
12 billion tonnes of economically minable coal in Alberta, British
Columbia, and Saskatchewan.
The initial project would involve a single coal gasification unit
on 640 acres and a 312 sq km surface mine with 320 million
tonnes of subbituminous coal, enough to support two gasifiers for
40 years. Average overburden depth is 15 m.

Sherritt International Corp., Toronto, has floated a development
plan for a $1.2 billion clean coal gasification project in south-central Alberta that would produce syngas, hydrogen, carbon dioxide,
and elemental sulfur.
One of as many as four coal gasification units could start up
in late 2011 on flat agricultural land about 50 miles southeast of
Edmonton, just south of Beaverhill Lake. Feasibility of a second
unit would be investigated once the first unit is operating at design capacity. Sherritt noted, “The development of Alberta’s vast oil
sands resource has resulted in increased demands for natural gas to
produce steam for bitumen recovery and as a source of hydrogen
for bitumen upgrading.” Use of natural gas is costly and unsustainable, the company said.
Coal carefully reacted with oxygen and steam produces a syngas Shell starts Changbei ﬁeld gas production
Commercial gas production has begun at Changbei gas field in
mix of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and CO2. This mix, with more
steam, converts CO to hydrogen and CO2. Then acid gas is applied China, said Royal Dutch Shell PLC, the field’s operator, on Mar. 1.
to remove the CO2 and other impurities such as hydrogen sulfide. The field is expected to plateau at 3 billion cu m/year in 2008 and

deliver gas to Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, and Hebei.
Shell will use long multilateral horizontal wells to achieve this
production level because Changbei is a difficult reservoir.
PetroChina and Shell are jointly developing the field under a
production-sharing contract, with Shell currently being the field
development operator. The field is on the edge of the Maowusu
desert in the Ordos basin of Shaanxi Province and Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region and is the largest onshore upstream cooperative development Shell has had in China.
Changbei development includes the construction of the central
processing facilities, interfield pipelines, and a drilling program
that is expected to involve about 50 horizontal and multilateral
wells over 10 years.

Gas delivery starts from Indonesia’s Suban ﬁeld
ConocoPhillips, operator of Suban gas field on the Corridor
Block production-sharing contract (PSC) area in South Sumatera,
has achieved first gas delivery via a gas processing plant recently
completed as part of the Indonesian field’s second-phase development.
The development also includes a series of planned development
wells, the first of which, the Suban-10 well, was drilled, completed, and is producing at a constrained rate of 150 MMscfd.
ConocoPhillips, under a 17-year gas sales agreement, will supply 2.2 tcf of gross gas to Perusahaan Gas Negara via the South
Sumatera-West Java pipeline. Gas sales deliveries from the field are
expected to start later this year.
Interest holders in Suban field are ConocoPhillips 54%, Talisman
Energy Inc. 36%, and PT Pertamina 10%.

CEPSA lets contract for reﬁnery expansion

Kearl oil sands project gets conditional nod
Imperial Oil Ltd. has received conditional approval from the
Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian government
for the development of the Kearl oil sands project in the Kearl Lake
area of the Athabasca region.
The approval comes after a joint federal and provincial review
of the proposed oil sands mining project, which is similar in design to existing Fort McMurray-region oil sands mines that use
large-scale shovels, trucks, crushers, and oil sands hydrotransport
technology.
The Kearl mining project will be developed in stages. Plans call
for an initial mine train with production capacity of about 100,000
b/d, and possible subsequent expansions to about 300,000 b/d.
The mine plan does not include any on-site bitumen upgrading.
Any future upgrading capacity to support the project would be
submitted in separate applications.
Imperial will review the approved conditions before advancing
engineering work to define the project design, execution strategies,
and project cost estimate, said Randy Broiles, senior vice-president
of resources.
The company previously had reported that the total project investment is estimated at $4.5-6.5 billion (Can.). The project was
scheduled to start up by yearend 2010, with possible second and
third mine trains starting up in 2012 and 2018, respectively (OGJ
Online, July 18, 2005, Newsletter).
Kearl oil sands project is a joint venture of Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Ltd. 70% and ExxonMobil Canada Properties 30%.
Imperial is the designated operator of the project. ✦

Cia. Espanola de Petroleos SA (CEPSA) has let a detailed engineering contract to Foster Wheeler Iberia SAU for a major expansion of its 100,000-b/cd La Rabida refinery in Huelva, Spain.
The project will add a 90,000-b/sd crude unit, 30,500-b/sd
vacuum distillation unit, and 148-ton/hr gas concentration unit.
The contract value was not disclosed. CEPSA is spending more
than $1 billion at the refinery to meet growing demand in Europe
for middle distillates.
Foster Wheeler Iberia has completed the front-end engineering
design for the planned units (OGJ, Nov. 13, 2006, Newsletter).
Mechanical completion of the new facility is scheduled for
fourth-quarter 2009.

In a statement, Shell said upstream some 1.6 bcfd of wellhead gas will be produced, transported, and processed to produce
120,000 boe/d of condensate, LPG, and ethane.
Downstream, dry gas will be used as feedstock to produce
140,000 b/d of clean, high-quality GTL fuels and products.
Shell said Pearl GTL is expected to produce 3 billion boe of
wellhead gas over the agreement period.
A total of $10 billion in contracts for the project has been
awarded, Shell said, including major engineering, procurement,
and construction contracts. Construction began in third quarter
2006.

Pearl GTL plant foundation stone laid

Sinopec, Syntroleum sign technologies deal

Qatar’s Crown Prince Shaikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani laid the
foundation stone Feb. 26 for the Pearl gas-to-liquids (GTL) facility,
reportedly the country’s largest energy project.
The complex will have two 70,000 b/d GTL trains and associated facilities. Production from the first train is expected to begin
in 2009-10, with start-up of the second train due a year later (OGJ,
Aug. 7, 2006, Newsletter).
Pearl GTL, 100% funded by Royal Dutch Shell PLC, is being developed under a development and production-sharing agreement

China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) and Syntroleum
Corp., Tulsa, have signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding aimed largely at advancing natural gas-to-liquids and
coal-to-liquids technologies.
The MOU aims at cooperation in verifying Syntroleum GTL
technologies on an industrial scale, construction of a 17,000 b/d
GTL plant and a 100 b/d CTL pilot plant in China as well as joint
marketing of Sinopec Syntroleum technology there.

of proprietary GTL technologies, including catalyst technology and
Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) technologies related to CTL, for use in China
on an exclusive basis during the period of cooperation.
After signing a formal cooperation agreement, Sinopec will
provide Syntroleum with $20 million/year over the next 5 years to
support the technology’s development.
Sinopec will start feasibility studies for construction of the
plants as well as the CTL pilot plant in China, upon completion of
the cooperation agreement.
Both plants will be fully capitalized by Sinopec, with technological support from Syntroleum. The two projects will provide the
basis for the two parties to jointly market the combined F-T technology capabilities to third parties within China.
A Sinopec spokesman said the company was investing in the
technology to complement existing efforts to develop its gas reserves in the long term.
Last December, Syntroleum signed a joint development agreement with Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co. for development of a 50,000 b/d GTL plant in Papua New Guinea (OGJ
Online, Dec. 22, 2006).

PNOC moves forward on biofuels projects
Philippine National Oil Co. subsidiary PNOC Alternative Fuels
Corp. is moving forward with projects related to the production of
biofuels from japtropha following approval of its 2007 budget for
1.257 billion pesos ($26 million).
PNOC-AFC Pres. Peter Anthony Abaya said the company plans
to invest in a planned biodiesel refinery, but he did not disclose
details.
For feedstock, PNOC-AFC expects to sign a memorandum of
understanding this month with Malaysian firm Biogreen Energy
Sdn. Bhd. to establish jatropha “meganurseries” on 1,500 hectares
to grow about 30 million seedlings within 2 years for commercial
plantations and research, Abaya said.
Abaya said other international firms interested in undertaking
biodiesel-related projects with PNOC-AFC include South Korea’s
Samsung Corp, Sumitomo Corp. and JGC of Japan, National Biofuels
of the US, Malaysia’s HDZ, and Brunei National Petroleum Co.
PNOC-AFC has already signed an MOU with Samsung for an
8.2-billion-peso jatropha plantation and refinery project, while
Sumitomo has agreed to conduct a feasibility study on the establishment of a biofuels central terminal in Bataan. ✦

Alaska governor outlines gas pipeline bill
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has introduced legislation intended to
induce construction of a multibillion-dollar pipeline that would
deliver North Slope natural gas to the Lower 48 states.
On Mar. 2 Palin outlined elements of the proposed Alaska
Gasline Inducement Act, or AGIC. The legislation sets aside a previous effort by former Gov. Frank Murkowski. It’s unknown when
the legislature will begin public hearings on AGIC. Murkowski
had negotiated a draft contract with Alaska North Slope producers
ExxonMobil Corp., ConocoPhillips, and BP PLC. The first draft was
released in May (OGJ, June 5, 2006, Newsletter).
Despite changes to the draft and special legislative sessions, state
lawmakers never approved the proposed plan from Murkowski,
who lost a reelection campaign in November.
Palin’s bill initiates an application process open to any project
sponsor, meaning that ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and BP must
start their negotiations over again. At least 12 companies or groups
of companies have expressed an interest in building the pipeline.

Tangguh LNG nears completion, seeks ﬁnancing
Construction on Indonesia’s Tangguh LNG facility is 70% complete, and startup is expected by fourth quarter 2008, if operator
BP Indonesia receives further financing for the project, said Kardaya Warnika, chairman of Indonesia’s upstream oil and gas executive agency BP Migas.
To build the plant BP needs financing of $6.5 billion altogether,
he said, of which $3.5 billion consists of loans, with the remainder
coming from the company’s own resources.
Warnika said BP Indonesia has secured more than $2 billion in
loans and is negotiating with a group of Chinese banks for another $884 million. If BP’s current negotiations are successful, these
loans should be disbursed in April.

BP secured loans of $2.616 billion in 2006, including $1.2 billion from the Japan Bank for International Corp., $350 million
from the Asian Development Bank, and $1.066 billion from commercial banks, Warnika said.
Meanwhile, according to BP Migas, Indonesia has signed contracts with Fujian-China for 2.6 million tonnes/year of gas over
25 years, SK Power Korea for 550,000 tonnes/year over 20 years,
Posco Korea for 550,000 tonnes/year over 20 years, and Sempra
Energy for 3.7 million tonnes/year over 20 years.

Nigeria LNG lets FEED for Bonny Island trains
Nigeria LNG (NLNG) has hired Foster Wheeler and Chiyoda
Corp. to carry out front-end engineering and design work for the
SevenPlus project on Bonny Island, which would add two liquefaction trains, each with a capacity of 8.5 million tonnes/year.
Foster Wheeler and Chiyoda will produce a project specification package that will form the basis for an invitation to bid for an
engineering, procurement, and construction contract.
Foster Wheeler said the two trains once finished would be the
largest in the world. A spokeswoman for Foster Wheeler declined
to say when the trains would go on line, but press reports have said
this would be 2012.
NLNG recently signed 20-year sales and purchase agreements
with units of BG Group, Eni SPA, Total SA, Royal Dutch Shell PLC,
and Occidental Petroleum Corp. for offtakes from SevenPlus.
Eni will take 1.375 million tpy of LNG to sell into the US via a
terminal at Cameron, La., where it holds regasification capacity of
4.4 million tpy. Total’s 1.375 million tpy will be sent to its Sabine
Pass and Altamira regasification terminals in the US and Mexico.
Shell Western LNG and Oxy, meanwhile, will receive 2 million
tpy and 1 million tpy, respectively, but have not revealed the destination for their supplies. BG has bought 2.25 million tpy. ✦

in 2012 from about 20 in 2002.

When asked whether high rig rates
are driving project architecture towards
more dry-tree solutions over subsea
developments, Wright said the leading developments are still employing
subsea systems. In developing heavy oil
in Latin America, dry-tree completions
possibly will become a trend, though,
he said.

Looking back
Surprising the analysts was a look
back at one difference between their
2002 forecast and the actual split in the
types of companies that recently have
drilled deepwater subsea wells.
In the 5-year forecast that it formulated in 2002, Infield predicted that
through 2007 fully integrated operating
companies would account for 68% of
deepwater wells brought on stream in
the Gulf of Mexico, leaving just 29%
drilled by independent operators and
3% by other companies.
The actual share of wells drilled in
the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico
by integrated companies during the
5-year span was just 44%, while independent operators were responsible for
52% of all wells brought on stream in
the same area. Wright said this shows
that, more than expected, the independents have been able to overcome some
of the major challenges of deepwater
developments.
Those challenges that remain for
companies involved in offshore development include limited equipment
availability and limited manpower,
which raise costs and threaten the momentum of development activity levels.
But with higher demand and prices
for oil and gas, Infield has seen companies shift from taking a low-cost
development approach to one of doing
what it takes and paying what it takes to
get the job done. ✦

Energy extremism
Energy extremism has tricked its way into the
mainstream. Three shades of it now control politics in the US. In an area where mistakes cost large
amounts of money, the potential for error is high.
Triangular extremism has infused American
politics with repugnance for oil and gas. It might
be more accurate to say that extremism has pushed
onto center stage a prejudice never absent from
the political fringe. Either way, it threatens to radicalize energy law and regulation.
Aversion to fluid hydrocarbons is manifest in
legislation that would raise taxes uniquely on oil
and gas producers and divert proceeds to energy
forms preferred by politicians—and energy providers receiving the money—but not by markets.
It’s manifest in federal budget proposals that
cancel funding for oil and gas technical research.
It’s manifest in a US president who bewails an
“addiction” to oil and presumes to know how
much gasoline Americans should use, in congressional inquisitions of oil executives in times of
high gasoline prices, and in a thundering failure
of confidence in the ability of energy markets to
dissipate stress.

Wasting money
The problem with antioil politics isn’t that oil
and gas face any threat of losing their commanding positions in the energy market. Hydrocarbons
dominate the market because they offer value that
other energy forms—no matter how much the
government spends on them—can’t match. The
main problem with the current political mood is
the amount of taxpayer and consumer money that
the government might waste combating economic
forces that never yield to political caprice. Another
problem is the political mire accumulating before
an industry that should be focused on meeting
demand for its products.
Through political expression contradicted by
consumption trends, the US thus is acting out a
futile ambition to disengage from hydrocarbon
energy, especially oil. For the sake of its operations and the interests of its customers, the oil
and gas industry needs to confront the off-oil
agenda head-on. It can best do so by addressing
the three presumptions of antioil extremism: that
oil destroys the environment, funds terrorism, and

enriches a despised industry.
By its nature, extremism begins with some
core truth then spirals away from reality. Antioil
extremism is no exception.
The production and consumption of oil and gas
do harm the environment. But they do so less and
less as technology and regulation make industry
operations diminishingly intrusive and petroleum
fuels remarkably less polluting than they were in
years past. Lately, global panic over climate change
has preempted consideration of real environmental progress. In fact, however, the contributions
of fossil energy to observed warming remain
less certain and almost certainly smaller than a
frenzied political discussion seems to assume.
With extremists controlling debate, the political
choice so far is between extreme response and no
response. As long as people yearn to prosper, that’s
a prescription for stalemate.
It is no doubt true as well that money from oil
sales ends up funding terrorist groups. But such
problems require diplomatic and military rather
than economic solutions. Mandates for expensive
substitutes for cheap energy hurt only Americans
and impoverish no terrorists at all. They also reflect
dreadful American xenophobia, insult oil exporters, and undermine US promotion of global trade.
And, yes, oil sustains an industry with scale and
operations that many outsiders find incomprehensible and therefore suspect. The industry easily
slides into the role of villain in rants by politicians
too ignorant, lazy, or corrupt to provide constructive energy leadership. When uninformed hate becomes policy that blocks work essential to energy
supply, national interests suffer.

Politics vs. economics
These extreme prejudgments have put politics in
conflict with economics. While US political leaders
profess to hate oil, their country consumes the substance at a rate that both leads the world and grows.
The paradox is typical. Extremism always generates
unachievable ambitions. It deserves neither the attention nor the expenditure it demands.
Energy extremism promises high cost and low
supply. It belongs on the political fringe. Now,
before politicians make any more mistakes, is the
time to put it back there. ✦

While US demand for ultralowsulfur diesel (ULSD) is expected to
escalate, no industry or government organization has solid data on how much
of the fuel will be available or needed.
And no one seems concerned. Unlike in the period prior to the 2006
deadlines for refiners to reduce highway diesel sulfur to 15 ppm from 500
ppm, government and industry officials
interviewed for this report said
they are confident the market will
function smoothly while meeting new deadlines in 2007 and
beyond. Refiners approached last
year’s changes confident that they
could meet demand for ULSD
but worried about logistics they
couldn’t control, especially the possibility of downstream contamination
(OGJ, May 22, 2006, p. 18). Any such
problems have been minor.
Since Oct. 15, most of the diesel
fuel sold at retail outlets in the US and
Canada has been ULSD—more than the
80% of US diesel production mandated
by the US Environmental Protection
Agency. The first diesel engines specifically designed for the ultralow-sulfur
fuel are in 2007 model vehicles now in
car and truck showrooms. The 2007model diesel trucks also will reduce
particle emissions by 90% and significantly lower emissions of nitrogen
oxide (NOx). But no one has a depend-

able estimate of how many of those
new diesel vehicles will be produced,
much less sold, in this or other years.
Meanwhile, EPA is mandating by
June a 500 ppm sulfur cap on all offroad diesel, with a 2010 deadline for
all highway and some off-road diesel
to be at the 15 ppm ULSD level. In June
2010, the sulfur cap is to be lowered
to 15 ppm for all nonroad diesel other
than locomotive and marine, but small
refiners are exempted from that rule.
In June 2012, the ULSD requirement
will apply to locomotive and marine
diesel, and by June 2014 the ULSD cap
will extend to small refiners that make
nonroad diesel.

Supply outlook
The only data on ULSD production
available through the US Department of
Energy’s Energy Information Administration show refinery and blender net
production totaled 1.9 million b/d last
June; 2.2 million b/d in July; 2.4 million b/d, August; 2.6 million b/d, September; 2.5 million b/d, October; and
2.6 million b/d, November. Imports
tallied at 97,000 b/d in June; 202,000
b/d in July; 182,000 b/d in August;
263,000 b/d in September; 137,000
b/d in October; and 143,000 b/d in
November.
But after allowing for adjustments
and stock change, the total ultralowsulfur distillate fuel supplied amounted
to 1.3 million b/d in June; 1.8 million
b/d in July; 2.3 million b/d in August;
2.4 million b/d, September; 2.6 million
b/d, October; and 2.7 million b/d as
of November. No later or more detailed
data were available, EIA officials said.
US inventories of ULSD totaled 57.3
million bbl in the week ended Feb. 23,
the latest period available at deadline,
down from 58 million bbl the previous
week but up from 1.7 million bbl during the same period a year ago, before
the mandate took effect. Low-sulfur
diesel (LSD) stocks amounted to 22.3
million bbl on Feb. 23, down from 23.6
million bbl the previous week and 79.5
million bbl during the same period in
2006. EIA officials told OGJ that data

on distillate fuel exports come from the
Bureau of Census. “Currently, Census
does not break out ULSD from LSD.
Normally exports of diesel are small,
and ULSD exports would be expected
to be even smaller. This means that the
product supplied (which is a surrogate
for demand) for ULSD potentially is
slightly overstated,” EIA said.
EIA said refiners likely will see little
shift in diesel and gasoline demand in
the next decade because of the slow
growth in the fleets of vehicles requiring ULSD. Diesel prices no longer
provide an incentive to switch over
as when they were lower than gasoline prices some years ago. But high
fuel prices in general should maintain
consumer interest in more fuel-efficient
diesel vehicles, EIA officials said.
The US gasoline price on Feb. 26
averaged $2.383/gal at the pumps,
up 8.7¢/gal from the prior week and
12.9¢/gal from the same period a year
ago. US diesel averaged $2.551/gal
at the pump, up 6¢/gal from a week
before and 8¢/gal from a year ago. For
the month of January, the US retail price
of gasoline averaged $2.24/gal. EIA
said factors contributing to that price
included the price of crude, 54%; refining, 11%; distribution and marketing,
15%; and state and local taxes, 20%. In
that same month, the retail price of diesel averaged $2.49/gal. Contributors to
that pump price included crude, 49%;
refining, 18%; distribution and marketing, 12%; and taxes, 21%, EIA reported.
The absence of good data on true
supplies of and demand for ULSD is
“one of the key issues all of us are painfully aware of in trying to understand”
that market,” said Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Technology
Forum. He blames reduced reporting by
EIA “because of budgetary restraints.”
Schaeffer said, “Diesel demand in the
US is directly related to the economy.
When the economy is growing consistently, as it has in the last couple of
years, that creates a demand for moving goods. That means locomotives,
ships, trucks—the primary sources of

diesel fuel consumption.” Meanwhile,
increased demand for crude around the
world and especially in China, India,
and the US influences prices, refiners’
strategy, and other factors. “And there’s
no relief in sight for that,” Schaeffer
said.
“The DOE data are pretty good and
shows in 2006, for example, that the
road diesel demand increase was 4.2%
year-on-year, even though the total
heating oil and diesel demand increase
was little more than 1%,” said Jeff D.
Morris, a former Fina executive who is
president and chief executive of Alon
USA Energy Inc. Alon Israel Oil Co. Ltd.
bought the US downstream assets of
TotalFinaElf SA in 2000. “The diesel demand growth rate over the last 3 years
has been double that of gasoline. It has
been 3.5-4% for 3-4 years in a row
now, very strong, whereas gasoline has
been around 2%,” Morris said.
Markets need “more diesel and less
gasoline” in virtually every area of the
world, said Aaron F. Brady, associate
director of global oil for Cambridge Energy Research Associates, at that group’s
annual Houston energy conference in
February. He expects rapid growth in
commercial demand for diesel and jet
fuel over the next 25 years, with refiners having to squeeze light and middle
products from heavier crudes. Asia will
be the greatest growth area for oil de-

mand by 2030, primarily in transportation fuels, Brady said.

Reﬁneries and infrastructure
Refineries are relatively flexible and
can move the manufacture of gasoline
or diesel “up and down about 10%,”
Morris said. So if US diesel demand
increased by 10%, displacing an equal
amount of gasoline demand, “The
existing refineries can handle that.
Beyond that, we would have to do some
retooling, but the technology exists to
do that. And it’s a lot cheaper retooling
than building ethanol plants all over the
country.”
He said, “Today we’re importing 15% of the gasoline used in this
country. If gasoline demand grows by
1%/year for the next 25 years, the US
would need to build 16 new 200,000
b/d refineries over that period just to
maintain the present level of gasoline
production and imports. Assume that
2% of US motorists convert to E-85
vehicles; the US then would have to
build 25 refineries, including ethanol
plants.” But if instead 2% of US motorists bought advanced diesel cars, only
six new refineries would be needed,
Morris said. And if a diesel hybrid
vehicle were developed and marketed at
the same annual rate, he said, no new
refineries would be necessary. “I don’t
understand why this is not talked about

more and why more incentives are not

At the recent CERA energy conference, Gary Heminger, executive vicepresident of Marathon Oil Co., projected that the industry will need to build
“a couple of world class refineries each
year” to keep up with global demand
for fuel. The average number of motor
vehicles in Asia is expected to grow to
47 per 1,000 persons by 2020 from 18
per 1,000 in 1997. Neither development of alternate fuels nor increased refining capacity will do much to reduce
US gasoline imports in the short term,
he said. However, he said, the world
will need all new forms of energy “that
can stand on sound investment.” For the
present, Heminger said, ULSD inventories “look decent.”

the density of retail diesel service station and truck stop locations per 100
sq miles. According to that data, 498 US
counties have 5-75—or more—retail
diesel locations per 100 sq miles. But
1,115 counties were indicated to have
less than one location per 100 sq miles.
Many of those areas with the fewest stations were in large and sparsely
populated counties encompassing long
stretches of interstate highways in West
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah,
Nevada, Nebraska, South Dakota, North
Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.
The largest group of counties in any
of the 11 density levels indicated on the

per 100 sq miles; the second largest
group was 738 counties with two to
five locations per 100 sq miles. Virtually
all of the density divisions had similarly

overlapping numbers. The largest evident concentration of diesel outlets was
essentially east of the Mississippi River.
However, Morris said there is “more
than sufficient infrastructure” for supplying diesel to a larger US market.
“Assume half of the motorists are driving diesel engines all of a sudden; the
conversion per station is simple. All it
takes basically is a change in the [size
and color of the pump] nozzle. It’s a
relatively small fix, whereas if you want
to put E-85 at a station, you have to
put a new tank and completely segregated system in the ground at a cost of
$30,000 per site,” he said. “Diesel has
a big advantage in infrastructure in that
it can go through [existing] pipelines.”
Of course, ULSD can’t afford to pick up
much sulfur contamination during the
distribution process, or it will be sent
back to the refiner for reprocessing.

the trucks that fueled up there were too
tall to fit under the station’s canopy and
needed extra space to turn,” Schaeffer
said. But now companies “like Shell and
Chevron and BP” are integrating a diesel
pump right alongside the gasoline on
the pump islands. “That suggests to

The best way to meet the goals set
by President George W. Bush to reduce

Those standards require stricter control

emissions and apply to diesel-powered
vehicles with gross vehicle weight

and HC standards are being phased in
at 50% of new vehicle sales in 2007-09.
By 2010, all new on-road vehicles will

For 2007-09, however, diesel engine
manufacturers have the option to design

less-stringent emission control systems.

long-term certainty and targets as the
government prepares to publish its
White Paper on energy within the next
month. In pursuing government policy,
communication across government
departments is important, he added,
as is assessing overlaps with European
initiatives to ensure there are no adverse
impacts on European goals such as
the Emissions Trading Scheme and the
carbon levy.
UK Energy Minister Peter Truscott
welcomed IEA’s findings, describing
them as “constructive and positive.” He
said, “It shows that the UK is heading
in the right direction, especially with
security of supply and climate change.”
He acknowledged that the government needs to improve energy efficien-

cy—a central tenet of its policy to reduce energy consumption—and curtail
carbon emissions. “There is no room
for complacency as we’ve got to achieve
reductions in emissions. The UK has introduced climate change legislation, but
we’ve got to act internationally to move
towards a low-carbon economy.”

Nuclear power
However, the role of nuclear power
in the UK’s future energy mix remains
uncertain. Mandil said the UK could
progress on this if it makes clear to the
public how it will dispose of waste,
saying France and Finland are “more
advanced on dealing with this.”
IEA recommended that the government establish a legal and regulatory

framework for potential investors to
assess the short and long-term risks
and benefits of building a new nuclear
plant.
Truscott said that the government will
not directly intervene in the development of the nuclear sector. “Any new
nuclear capacity will be developed and
financed by the private sector,” he added.
Greenpeace, in a recent High Court
judicial review, succeeded in compelling the government to hold a wider
consultation on the future role of
nuclear power in the UK’s energy mix.
The Department for Trade and Industry,
which develops energy policy, has committed to wider consultancy, and will
publish its nuclear policy in the Energy
White Paper within the next month. ✦

Mulva: energy interdependence rather than independence
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ofﬁcer James J. Mulva said energy independence is a popular topic in the US, but
believes that energy interdependence
among worldwide energy companies is
a more realistic goal.
“We believe it is unrealistic to believe
the US can become energy independent,” Mulva said Mar. 1 in a speech
at Rice University’s Baker Institute in
Houston. His speech was part of a 2-day
conference on national oil companies
(NOCs).
Bader al-Khashti, chairman and
managing director of Kuwait Foreign
Petroleum Exploration Co. (Kufpec), and
Victor Zhikai Gao, senior vice-president
and general counsel-company secretary
of CNOOC Ltd., also spoke at the conference.
In separate speeches, al-Khashti and
Zhikai Gao each talked of corporate growth
plans and the need for cooperation with
international oil companies (IOCs).
Mulva said cooperation and collaboration between NOCs and publicly held
IOCs is vital. He advocated a supportive
government attitude on the part of both
producing and consuming nations in
order to encourage the massive investments by energy companies that will
be needed to fulﬁll anticipated world oil
and gas demand.

US policy

signals to partners around the world
that their contribution to energy is vital
now and for years to come,” Mulva
said, adding that any efforts against
allowing foreign investment in the US
upstream or downstream sectors “is
out of touch with the real world.”
A new model is evolving for NOCIOC partnerships, Mulva said. Components of a successful partnership
include sharing costs and risk, complementary business and technical skills,
good relationships, and a commitment
to uphold contracts.
“Partnerships must take into account
the big picture,” and partners must
seek to help each other meet goals,
Mulva said. “We believe there are a
multitude of ways NOCs and IOCs can
work together” in both upstream and
downstream projects.
Mulva said NOCs are “in a stronger
position to bankroll big projects on
their own as well as make acquisitions.” Western “Big Oil” companies
no longer necessarily have a lock on
technology. “In comparison to NOCs
today, Big Oil is not so big.”
CNOOC’s Zhikai Gao said his
company’s mission is to become “more
and more international” going forward.
He expressed disappointment about
CNOOC’s failed attempt to buy Unocal

its bid in the face of opposition from

“The US must start sending clear

of a privately held international oil
company (IOC), the study said.
This means NOCs might have
more difficulty replacing reserves and
expanding oil production than the
industrialized West, which was responsible for 40% of increased worldwide
oil production capacity in the past 30
years—with most of that investment
coming from IOCs, the report said.
30

Supply, demand
NOCs’ influence over global oil supply and demand will affect future oil
prices and security trends. Consuming
nations, like the US, might need to adjust national energy strategies to reduce
vulnerability to NOC oil supply.
The study’s summary calls Saudi
Aramco “the powerhouse of geopolitical NOCs” because it’s the only state oil

about a Chinese company buying a US
oil company. Chevron Corp. bought
Unocal for $18 billion.
“I really do believe CNOOC’s offer
was a better deal,” Zhikai Gao said.
“It did not go the way we wished, not
for commercial reasons, but for other
reasons.”
CNOOC believes “greater openness
and greater cooperation between one
country and another is in the fundamental interests of all the countries, all
the consumers,” he said.

Kufpec
Kufpec expects to meet its previously announced goal to produce
100,000 boe/d by 2010. It produced
more than 65,000 boe/d at yearend
2005, al-Khashti said. The company
has operations in 15 countries including Australia, Egypt, Indonesia, and
Pakistan.
“Our presence helps bring economic
prosperity,” al-Khashti said. “We are
here not only to make oil and gas. We
are here to make a proﬁt.”
The company’s strategy calls for
continued growth by expanding existing partnerships and also through the
creation of new partnerships, he said.
Kufpec is considering many possibilities, including Commonwealth of Independent States countries, he said.
“NOCs represent their nations as
ofﬁcial and unofﬁcial ambassadors in
energy,” al-Khashti said. “Kufpec has
successfully carried the Kuwaiti ﬂag
into many host governments.”

company that is truly a global oil swing
producer.
“The critical question for the future
is whether Saudi Aramco, along with
other major NOCs, will be able to
continue to invest adequate amounts to
meet the projected rise in oil demand
in the United States, Europe, China, and
emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere,” the summary report said.

reach 62 million tonnes/year by 2012,
said Whitley.

World LPG prices, boosted by high
oil and natural gas prices, have pushed
up supply but depressed demand in
developing markets, according to Craig
Whitley of Houston-based consultancy
Purvin & Gertz Inc. in opening remarks
Mar. 6 to the firm’s 20th Annual International LPG Seminar in Houston.
Especially in China and India have high
prices halted LPG demand that had seen
several years of steady growth as those
countries’ economies have expanded.
On the other hand, higher oil
production rates have pushed up LPG
production, especially in the Middle
East. The region, led by Saudi Arabia,
historically leads the world in LPG
produced for export. Adding to the
growing supply is a spate of new LPG
production projects around the world,
including many associated with new
LNG production.
In 3 years’ time, said Whitley, world
LPG trade has moved from being demand-driven to supply-driven, building

Mideast charge

Asian push

Global LPG production during
2006-12 will rise to 273 million tonnes
from 227 million tonnes last year. This
growth in fact will exceed growth by all
other petroleum supplies, said Whitley.
Middle East LPG production—rising
the fastest—will surpass North American production about 2010, taking
over as world leader. North American
production in that period will remain
flat.
Middle East production, according
to Whitley, will expand by more than
60% through 2016, as oil production
continues strong and the region ensures
ample feedstock for rapidly growing
petrochemical capacity.
Following relatively flat growth in
the 1990s, Middle East production
expanded by 18% during 2003-06,
increasing by 6.6 million tonnes/year.
With projects virtually all over the
Arabian Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia,
the UAE, Qatar, and Iran, regional
production will grown by 6.3%/year to

Demand has been especially strong
in developing nations of Asia, primarily China and India, but Middle Eastern
petchem demand has also begun to
attract larger volumes, he said.
Sometime shortly after 2000, Asia
surpassed North America as the world’s
leading consuming center, and in 2006
reached 66.5 million tonnes in demand, compared with North America’s
61.8 million tonnes.
With rapid expansion in the Middle
East’s petchem sector, LPG demand
growth there is also being driven up by
continued growth in the residential and
commercial sector.
Demand in the developed world,
primarily Europe and North America,
has been relatively flat. Both regions’
petchem industries remain markets for
price-sensitive supplies of LPG.
Worldwide, residential and commercial markets continue to dominate LPG
demand and will reach close to 150
million tonnes in 2012. ✦

Senate energy leaders voice concerns in budget requests

US Senate energy leaders have formally raised questions about oil and
natural gas-related aspects of President George W. Bush administration’s
proposed fiscal 2008 budgets for the

Departments of Energy and the Interior.
Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (DNM) and Ranking Minority Member

Reserve’s size and eliminate funding for
oil and gas, geothermal, and hydroelec-

tric research and development in DOE’s

gas leasing within the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge and to repeal portions
of the 2005 Energy Policy Act related
to funding for processing of drilling
permit applications on federal lands.
Their letter was required under
Senate rules for each committee to
provide views and estimates annually of
programs under its jurisdiction to the
Budget Committee.
Of the proposal to double the SPR’s
size, Bingaman and Domenici wrote,
“We will need to look closely at the
need for a larger reserve, its cost, its
impact on world markets, and its effect
on oil and gasoline prices, before we
authorize any such expansion.”
They also said they believe that eliminating R&D funding for oil and gas and
other traditional energy sources “will
compromise efforts to fully develop our
domestic energy resources.” Adminis-

tration officials have said they do not
believe federal funding for oil and gas
R&D is justified because prices for the
commodities have grown dramatically
the past few years.
Regarding the ANWR proposal in
DOI’s budget request, Bingaman and
Domenici noted that the Energy Committee and the Senate overall are deeply
divided over the issue, but added that
they do not consider it likely that the
110th Congress will approve the plan.
They listed the drilling permit application processing proposal with
three others involving cuts or changes.
The others were proposed reductions
of Land and Water Conservation Fund
support to its lowest point in history, of
Payments in Lieu of Taxes and of water
programs at the US Bureau of Reclamation and US Geological Survey.
Bingaman and Domenici also ex-

pressed their concern over omissions of
price thresholds from federal deepwater
Gulf of Mexico oil and gas leases that
were issued in 1998 and 1999. They
said that the omissions may result in
billions of oil and gas royalty payments
being lost and indicated that the committee would look it ways to mitigate
such losses.
The committee also will consider
additional legislation this year to reduce
US dependence on foreign oil by promoting the use of new energy technologies, they said. “It is important that
the budget resolution accommodate the
necessary funding to allow the committee to report such legislation. We
urge the Budget Committee to include
a deficit neutral reserve fund in the
budget resolution to accommodate such
legislation,” Bingaman and Domenici
said. ✦

Rig shortages to delay
Libya’s E&P projects

Security: the
Chinese view

Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Exploration and production programs
in Libya are facing significant delays because of a shortage of drilling and workover rigs, according to Phoenicia Group, a
Libya-based investment and trade consultancy firm.
The scarcity of equipment also means
higher prices for available rigs, which is
straining already high E&P costs in the area.
A Phoenicia spokesman told OGJ that
some projects are facing delays as long
as a year. “Day rates for both drilling and
workover rigs have gone up by as much as
15-25% in some cases, and in others it can
be as much as 40-60%. It really depends
on the company and the circumstances.
Contracts need to be done early before rigs
are brought into the country.”
Ryad Sunusi, Phoenicia’s interim president and chief executive, said, “Libya needs
at least 40 rigs for the next 10 years to
support [international oil company (IOC)]
exploration programs, and this represents a great opportunity for the Libyan
private sector to get involved, in forming
[joint ventures] with overseas drilling and
workover contractors, as outlined by GPC
Decree 443/2006.”
IOCs wishing to do business in Libya
must do so through JVs with a Libyan partner, according to GPC Decision 443/2006,
which was passed last November by the
General People’s Committee, Libya’s executive decision-making body.
Foreign partners can take a maximum
share of 65% and have the majority of
representatives on its board. The Libyan
partner, however, legally must have a
minimum 35% stake in any joint stock
company.
According to Phoenicia, major oil
services companies such as “Schlumberger,
Halliburton, Weatherford, and others are
scrambling to conform to the new decree,
and newcomers keen to pinpoint Libyan
partners.” ✦

T

he other day, I was chatting
with one of China’s oil and gas
people—let’s call him Ooh Hyun—
who was at pains to tell me (and the
world we watch) that his country
does not deserve the bad press it gets
these days.
In fact, sitting on a verandah
overlooking the port of Hainan, one
of his country’s leading gateways for
the import of oil and natural gas,
Ooh raised his hands in a gesture
that could be interpreted as one of
despair.
“I find it hard to understand why
people are not talking about those
countries with a high level of consumption and imports threatening
the world’s oil security but who say,
on the contrary, that our low level of
consumption and imports is a threat
to world energy security,” he said.
“This is not fair. China is not only not
a threat to energy security, but is a
positive factor in safeguarding world
energy security.”

I mentioned security problems over
oil and gas between his country and
Japan in disputed waters of the East
China Sea.
Ooh recovered and shrugged.
“You see?” he said. “Your observation just proves my point. It’s those
energy-hungry Japanese who are the
ones causing the problems in the East
China Sea. Not us.”
I was not sure how to reply to that
since Japan a week before—in a bid
to break the stalemate with China
over joint development of gas fields
in the area—proposed launching a
project that would cover a broad area
of the East China Sea and encompass the contested demarcation line

GLOBAL OFFSHORE
OIL—2

This is the second of two parts on
the outlook for global offshore oil discoveries, production, and reserves.
The reserve base is the sum of
cumulative production and remaining reserves; these two combined with
undiscovered potential (or yet-to-find)
give the ultimately recoverable reserves
(URR).

only available from the US Geological
Survey’s 2000 world petroleum assessment. The USGS methodology is based
on assessments of a total petroleum system (TPS) of known and frontier provinces, which is a less restrictive measure
than known field-by-field estimates.
Table 4 shows the global offshore
reserve base at end 2005 based on a
combination of these two sources adjusted for discoveries and type of liquid.
But how can we get a second opinion?

L O P M E N T
the offshore giants range in size from
30 billion bbl to 2.5 billion bbl.
In general, the mean size of the
onshore giants is three times that of
the offshore giants, 24 billion bbl vs. 8
billion bbl. Consequently, the expected
value of the offshore crude reserves
would be around 600 billion bbl, corresponding to one-third of the K-value
estimated for the onshore.
Using the tail-end values of the
offshore size distribution, it is also possible to obtain a range of values. The
high end corresponds to the oil fields
of the Persian Gulf. They are the largest
offshore oil fields in the world, varying
in size from 30 billion bbl to 4 billion
bbl. Their onshore counterparts are also
the biggest in the world. The size ratio
of onshore to offshore fields is estimated at 2.5.
At the low tail-end of the distribution are the giant oil fields discovered in
the Gulf of Mexico. With the sole exception of the fields in Mexico, the largest
fields discovered in the Gulf of Mexico
to date tend to be relatively small, less
than 1 billion bbl, and average 500
million bbl and less. The onshore fields
contiguous to the gulf are also relatively
small.
The 10 largest onshore oil fields
in the US Lower 48 have sizes varying from 6 billion bbl to 1.4 billion
bbl with an average of 2.5 billion bbl.
The size ratio for the onshore Gulf of
Mexico is 5, which is twice that for the
Persian Gulf.
These size ratios would indicate that
the offshore reserve base can range
from 720 billion bbl to 360 billion bbl.
The heuristic methodology shows
that the average estimate for the global
offshore oil reserve would be closer
to 600 billion bbl, which is nearly
30% more than the IHS bottom-up
estimate; considering the difference
in the approach, the proximity of the
results is reassuring. However, given
that both methodologies may not apply
to unexplored regions with probably
significant reserves and potential, it can
be concluded that additional offshore
reserves must exist over and above this

new estimate.
By combining the average result of
the heuristic approach with the USGS
2000 assessment estimate for undiscovered oil, the URR for the global offshore could be closer to 1,000 billion
bbl, of which just 200 billion bbl have
been produced (Fig. 8).

The shallow offshore is expected to
continue to grow at a slower pace to
the end of this decade until the pressure from declining North Sea oil is
reduced. At least three giant fields will
contribute significant volumes in the
medium term: Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli,

its maximum level in the medium term
due to the nature of turbidite reservoirs. However, this scenario remains
uncertain due to the potential impact of
technology and unexplored deepwater
provinces, both of which could extend
the growth and certainly the postpeak
production level.
The ultradeep water will remain
constrained, but in 5 years several fields
will be producing in the US gulf, Angola, and Brazil. Offshore production in
Russia/Arctic is also just taking off with
new production from Sakhalin, Pechora,
and the Barents Sea.
Fig. 9 shows historical and modeled
future world offshore oil production.
Deepwater is included separately given
the importance of this source. The near
to medium term has been modeled
with known projects (over 200) and assumed decline rates. The model has also
been calibrated so that projected R/P
ratios remain stable.
There is no doubt that global offshore oil production will continue to
grow strongly in the medium term; in
fact, various tests of the model show
that global offshore crude oil production could grow to 34 million b/d by
2020.
Long term, once the R/P ratio reaches 10 to 15 and cumulative production
exceeds 50% of URR, it is expected that
production will start to level off and
then decline. The

Delta sizes up northern Paradox discoveries
Delta Petroleum Corp., Denver, is sizing up gas-condensate and oil discoveries in the northernmost Paradox basin
in Grand County, Utah.
The company hopes to ultimately
recover 2 to 4 tcf of gas net to its 70%
interest from Pennsylvanian Hermosa
Group clastics in southwestern Grand
County. It has drilled the GreentownState 36-11 and 32-42 wells south of
Green River, Utah. A pipeline Delta
plans to build mainly on federal land
to transport the gas could take a year to
complete.
The 36-11 well is completed in 2 of
12 pay intervals. From the two completed intervals it production tested
at a combined 4.5 MMcfd of gas and
125 b/d of condensate. The company
estimated proved reserves at 2.7 bcfe
from the two perforated zones. The
other 10 intervals have similar log
characteristics.
The well blew out for several days
in 2006 during postfrac flowback after
only one interval had been perforated.
The 32-42 well, 7.5 miles southeast,
is completed in 8 of 12 pay intervals. It

flowed a combined 2 MMcfd of gas and
500 b/d of condensate. Proved reserve
estimate is 5.8 bcfe in the eight zones.
The wells have 906 and 1,077 ft of
potentially productive clastics in the 12
intervals, respectively, and the company
believes all of its 40,900 gross (28,600
net) acres to be prospective.
Delta plans to drill six to eight
wells in 2007 to an average 9,800 ft at
$3.0-3.5 million/well. One well will
be a clastic prospect on a salt anticline
analogous to Greentown.
Meanwhile, about 15 miles east in
Grand County, Delta completed its 70%
owned Salt Valley-State 25-12 well in 13
stages. It encountered 654 ft of net sand
in 15 intervals. The well, expected to recover 200,000 bbl of light, sweet crude,
is to go on pump in mid-March.
Delta holds 7,100 gross (5,000 net)
acres, all of which it deems prospective.
It will drill five to six wells in 2007 on
40-acre spacing. Wells are to average
8,200 ft and cost $2.5 million.
An undisclosed private company
holds the other 30% interest in both
prospects. ✦

PCL in the PTTEP S1 area, in Pitsanuloke, and Kampangpetch, and Supanburi provinces, for several years (Fig. 1).
Rig GW-80 was built in China by
Honghua Machinery Manufacture,
Sichuan. Model ZJ 50DBS uses variable
frequency drive and is rated to 5,000m
(16, 400 ft). All rig components were
manufactured in China, except for the
Caterpillar generators and the Varco
TDS-11SA top drive.
The 1,500-hp rig features a driller’s
cabin and console with joystick controls, and can handle triple stands of
pipe (Fig. 2). Triple stands of pipe are
handled manually; there is no automated pipe handling equipment (Fig. 3).
Over a 26-month period (August
2004-October 2006), this land rig
drilled 78 wells, completed 3 workovers, was skidded 27 times over a
total skidding distance of 3,150 m, and
moved 55 times over 380,000 km.
The drilling completion cycle ranged
3.6-27.6 days/well for 60 wells drilled
in 2005-06, with an average around
7 days (Fig. 4). Rig move cycle time
ranged 1.5-5.1 days/move.
During the first 10 months of
2006, Rig GW-80 drilled 40 wells, 1
workover, 1 sidetrack, and 100,500 m
(about 330,000 ft). Crews skidded the
rig 18 times over a total of 1,612 m
and moved the rig 26 times.
During the entire year, 2006, GW80 drilled 114,482 m (375,500 ft). It
may be a land rig footage record for
the country and the company, but OGJ
cannot confirm record status. There is
no central database for land rig performance outside the US.
The Land Rig Newsletter ranks the
top 75 “most active” land rigs each
year, based on footage drilled in the US.
Publisher Richard Mason told OGJ that
the GW-80’s performance in Thailand
in 2006 would rank 17th in the US.
The top two US rigs finally broke the
500,000 ft. barrier in 2006.

Procedure
GWDC (Thailand) detailed the
operations procedure for a typical well
drilled in the PTTEP S1 area. The well

program was designed by PTTEP’s drilling department.
The first section is drilled from 8501,250 m in about 12 hr, using a 121⁄4in. PDC bit with a 95⁄8-in. motor and
MWD and fresh water. The inclination
is increased from 15-60º. The choke
manifold, pipe ram, and SCR are tested.
After reaching TD, the driller backreams
with the bottomhole assembly (BHA).
The crew sets 95⁄8-in. casing and cement
in 7-8 hr. The well is then pressure
tested for 3-4 hr.
The driller reenters the hole with
an 83⁄4-in. BHA and drills with overbalanced mud weight, drilling 2,5003,500 m in about 40 hr. Pulling out of
hole requires about 12 hr. Two wireline
logging runs take about 10 hr. The crew
sets and cements 7-in. casing in about
15 hr. Completing the well (without
perforating) requires about 10 hr.
Another half hour is required to nippledown the BOP.

late December 2005 for Aspect Energy
LLC, a privately held, Denver-based,
independent oil and gas exploration
and investment company. On Jan. 17,
2006, GWDC completed the first well
successfully.
The fourth GWDC America rig,
1,500-hp, spudded its first well in
Sulphur, La., on Aug. 16, 2006. The fifth
and sixth rigs, 750-hp and 1,000-hp,
cleared the Port of Houston in September 2006 and went to work for Aspect
Energy.
By January 2007, GWDC had nine
Chinese-built rigs operating in the US,

easily allow for changing speed in midcycle; although, one can change the
constant operating speed by changing a
gear belt.
In the past, some operators have
replaced mechanical pump jacks with
hydraulically operated pump jacks, but
these hydraulic units generally have
allowed little flexibility in the pumping
process.

New design
The new Ecoquip hydraulically
operated rod pump allows adjustment
of the pump-jack operating speed. The
unit can change the speed on-the-fly to
deal with short-term anomalies in the
production.
Each pumping unit has two hydraulic slave cylinders, mounted vertically.
The pump rods hang between them.
When the cylinders extend, they pull
the rods up during the suction stage.
On the downstroke, the rod weight
pulls the rods and hydraulic actuators
down.
Fig. 2 shows two of the hydraulic
rod pumps installed on Trident Exploration Corp. wells near Swann Hills, Alta.
Next to the rod pumps are the set of
pumps, valves, and hydraulic accumulators that provide the power. Fig. 3 is a
closer view of the control and pumping
equipment.
Each sphere is an accumulator. Under
each accumulator is a large hydraulic
master cylinder that forces oil into the
slave cylinders that lift the rods.
Fig. 4 shows a cutaway view of the
accumulator and master cylinder beneath. During the pumping cycle, as the
weight of the rods in the well pulls the

rods down, they force oil back into the
master piston. The oil pressurizes the
nitrogen in the sphere for assisting the
next upstroke.
The accumulator contains nitrogen
under pressure and serves as a counter balance storing energy during the
down stroke to balance the weight of
the pump rods.
Because the accumulator contributes
to balance the weight of the pump rods,
the system requires a smaller 80-100
hp hydraulic pump than would be
needed if the hydraulics provided all the
lifting force for the rods. The rod and
its payload of produced fluid typically
weighs 27,000-35,000 lb.
Hence, the accumulator accommodates a wide load range with the same
power unit.
Most installations to date are on
wells with a 1,000-7,000 ft depth. The
average well depth is about 4,000 ft.
A typical installation has the following capacity:
• A 2.75-in. diameter sucker-rod
pump at 6 strokes/min will lift a 144in. column of fluid/stroke. At 85%
pump efficiency, the pump will lift
about 648 b/d of fluid.
• A 1.5-in. diameter sucker-rod
pump at 6 strokes/min will lift a 144in. column of fluid/stroke. At 85%
pump efficiency, the pump will lift
about 193 b/d of fluid.
Note that the stroke rates can range
from 2 to 6/min, depending on well
conditions.

movement, the slave moves 6 in.
The main hydraulic pump providing fluid to the system is a swashplate
model manufactured by Sundstrand
Corp. When the pump swashes in one
direction, it moves the master cylinder
one way to cause the lifting cylinders to
raise the rods. When it swashes in the
other direction, the rods come down.

Trident Exploration Corp. installed two of the new hydraulic rod pumps on wells near Swann Hills, Alta.
Two hydraulic cylinders on each pump string pull the rods up, while gravity pulls the rods under control
back into the well and recharges the pressure accumulators (Fig. 2).

A closer view of the Trident installation shows the control-power systems for the two hydraulic rod
pumps.The cylindrical vessels are the accumulators.The skids also include hydraulic pumps and control
boxes (Fig. 3).
As the rods come down, the pump
assists in pressurizing the nitrogen in
the sphere to help the lift on the next
upstroke.

Method estimates
K values quickly
S.K. Mukherjee
Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd.
Mumbai, India

A new method to estimate equilibrium phase
distribution ratios (K
values) improves on the
shortcomings of older
Refining
methods. The method
is based on the generalized fugacity charts of Lewis, Kay, and
Newton, and uses reduced temperatures
and pressures as parameters.
A third-degree polynomial is
prepared from Lu’s chart for calculating liquid molarity, which is used
for calculating liquid phase fugacity
from fugacity of saturated liquid. The
proposed method, therefore, requires
looking up only one chart—the
generalized fugacity chart (which is a
well-spaced-out chart and can be read
accurately) and the rest of the calculations use equations, thus enabling
rapid calculation.
This article also explains the first
principles for calculating K values from
fugacity of real gases and liquids.
A K value is required whenever one
designs a distillation column or assesses the performance of an operating
column. Depriester nomographs can
be used to obtain estimates of K values.
The K values thus obtained depend on
pressure and temperature of the multi-

component system and not on concentration.
Concentration-dependent K values
can be calculated from empirical correlations involving lengthy calculations or
from equations of state using commercial software because hand calculations
are unwieldy. For preliminary design
work and checking performance of
existing columns, however, K values for
multicomponent systems based on system pressure and temperature suffice.
Depriester nomographs do not
explain the basis how the K values are
obtained. Other methods require looking up charts or figures, where accuracy
can be compromised.

K value
The equilibrium phase distribution
ratio (K value) is defined in Equation 1
(see attached equation box).

The graph may be used
to calculate the fugacity of
liquids at their vapor pressures because the fugacity
of a pure component as a
saturated vapor and saturated
liquid are same at the same
temperature and pressure.
One can estimate the fugacity of a saturated liquid from
the f/P chart by finding the
corresponding vapor fugacity.
Liquid fugacities are
obtained from the f/P chart
using the method described
at the vapor pressure at the
given temperature. System
pressure is higher or lower
than the vapor pressures of
the components in the mixture. One must consider the
difference in pressure when
computing the liquid fugacities of the components using
Equation 11.

• P* (from Table 1) = 190.3 psia.
• MW = 44.
• Molar volume of liquid (from
Table 2) = 1.204768 cu ft/lb-mol at Tr
= 0.6171
By definition, Tr = (100 + 460)/666
= 0.8408 and Pr = 300/617 = 0.4862.
Pr* is therefore 190.3/617 = 0.3048.
f/P from Fig. 1 is 0.692 for Tr =
0.8408 and Pr = 0.4862. fiV is therefore
0.692*300 = 207.6 psia.
f/P from Fig. 1 is 0.8 for Tr = 0.8408
and Pr* = 0.3048. Multiplying by P*
gives fiLP* = 0.8*190.3 = 152.24 psia.
Using Equation 14 and Tr = 0.6171,
then K1 = 0.9938907. Similarly, for Tr =
0.8408, K2 = 0.7949121.
Rearranging Equation 13 gives V2L =
(K2/ K1)* V1L = (0.7949121/
0.9938907)*1.204768 = 0.963571.
From Equation 12, ln fiLp =
ln 152.24 + ((0.963571*44)/
(1,544*560))*(300-190.3) =
5.030837. Solving for fiLp gives a value
of 153.0611.
Using Equation 5, Kideal = fiL / fiV =
153.0611/207.6 = 0.737289.

Example 2
Estimate the K value for ethane at
120° F. and 400 psia given:
• Tc = 550° R.
• Pc = 708 psia.
• P* (from Table 1) = 963.8 psia.
• MW = 30.
• Molar volume of liquid (from
Table 2) = 0.880107 cu ft /lb-mol at Tr
= 0.606545.
By definition, Tr = (120 + 460)/550
= 1.0545 and Pr = 400/708 = 0.5650.
Pr* is therefore 963.8/708 = 1.3613.
f/P from Fig. 1 is 0.83 for Tr =
1.0545 and Pr = 0.5650. fiV is therefore
0.83*400 = 332 psia.
f/P from Fig. 1 is 0.59 for Tr =
1.0545 and Pr* = 1.3613. Multiplying by P* gives fiLP* = 0.59*963.8 =
568.642 psia.
Using Equation 14 and Tr =
0.606545, K1 = 1.00076. Similarly, for
Tr = 1.0545, K2 = 0.4323483.
Using Equation 13 gives V2L =
(K2/K1)* V1L = (0.4323483/1.00076)*
0.880107 = 0.351778.

From Equation 12, ln fiLp =
ln 568.642 + ((0.3802283*30)/
(1,544*580))*
(400 – 963.8) = 6.33606956. fiLp is
therefore = 564.572923.
Using Equation 5 gives Kideal = fiL/fiV
= 564.572923/332 = 1.70052085. ✦

Effective removal of
black powder from a

often requires a combination of methods. Removing such particulates

is a multistep process
requiring a comprehensive understanding of the nature
of the problem. Different tools may be
effective in some
instances but not in
others.

Gas Corp. SA’s
(DEPA’s) experience
in fighting black
powder in its system, focused on its
determining which technique provided
the most efficient and cost-effective
method of powder removal.

the different sorts of pigs, filters, and
separators DEPA used in attempting to
address the problem, with the effectiveness and shortcomings of each assessed.

Background
Black powder is a solid contaminant
found in natural gas transmission and
distribution systems throughout the
world. Chemical or biological reactions
with steel found in natural gas pipelines, gas wells, and associated facilities
can create black powder.1 Solids may be
simple or complex mixtures of small
particles dispersed in gas (particulates)
or they may be dispersed in water or
liquid hydrocarbons (slurry).
Formation cuttings, drilling mud,
desiccant dust, construction dirt, sand,
mill scale, iron oxide, iron carbonate,
iron sulphide, welding slag and splatter,
eroded steel cuttings, salt crystals, valve
grease, corrosion inhibitor, and other
organic materials can all contribute to
the presence of black powder.2

DEPA performed a pigging

of powder.
Ongoing black-powder contamination of
DEPA’s network increased
gradually as gas offtakes
increased. Powder gathering in the gas piping and
installations resulted in:
• Reduced flow efficiencies.
• Clogged and collapsed filters.
• Deposits on gas measurement devices.
• Clogging of instrumentation and valves.
• Accelerated deterioraOil & Gas Journal / Mar. 12, 2007

tion of valves due to erosion.
• Other operations, maintenance,
and safety concerns.
Black powder, either attached to the
pipe wall, or collected in the pipe bottom, increased roughness, decreased
flow area, and increased pressure drop.
Black powder could also reduce the
functionality and reliability of emergency shutdown systems, system
isolation valves, pressure-control monitors, gauges, and other pipeline safety
devices. Solids in the gas stream etched
and grooved a number of DEPA’s highpressure valves.
Although the greatest accumulation
of black powder was in the first segment of DEPA’s pipeline immediately

powder continued to be deposited at
all downstream gas installations. As a
result, other gas filtration devices along
DEPA’s system clogged regularly and
had to be replaced.
This extra maintenance load increased labor hours needed to keep the
system functional and safe. The economic effect on the newly constructed
gas transmission system was exorbitant
and mounted every day that the system
was operated.
Black powder also prevented DEPA
from accommodating gas flow rates
above a certain limit, because the
amount of black powder transferred to
the cartridge filters at high flow rates,
was sufficient to clog a clean filter within a few hours.

On February 22, 2007, LNG Observer’s Editor,
Warren True, led a panel discussion on the
importance and future of gas storage.
Hal Miller, of the widely respected consultancy
Galway Group, provided an overview of the
current state of underground natural gas
storage.
Ned Crady, with leading LNG law ﬁrm King &
Spalding, covered regulatory and legal issues
that may affect development of storage.
Mark Cook, current Chairman of National
Energy Services Association (NESA) discussed

Dual module bidirectional pigs with brushes continued to remove large amounts of black powder even after other techniques had been applied.The interior of the
pipeline on the Bulgarian side of the border was not protected with coating (Fig. 4).
time removed 500 kg of black powder,
with the pig again undamaged.
The cleaning operation continued
with a heavy bidirectional pig using
polyvinyl chloride discs (two discs in
front and two at the rear) at an average
velocity of 1.4 m/sec. This pig experienced difficulty in moving through the
line. At the final stage of its route the pig
stopped and gas flow downstream was
interrupted. Getting the pig back under
way required venting gas with powder
from the pig trap, creating a sufficient
pressure drop across the pig to kick the
pig into the trap. This pigging removed
5,000 kg of black powder.
All aforementioned pigging operations removed a combined total of
11,620 kg of black powder.
Pigging continued from 2000 to
2003 at DEPA’s pipeline and also upstream, in Bulgarian territory, where
dual module bidirectional pigs with
brushes were also used, the interior of
that pipeline not having been protected
with coating. These operations removed
a large amount of powder (Fig. 4).
All processes focused on the physical removal of the powder without
any chemical treatment. Pigging with
chemicals, such as dispersants, solvents, or gelling agents might be useful
in other cases, but the nature of the
powder and the rather large size of
56

the pipeline prevented their use in this
instance.5
DEPA purged the valve station at the
entrance of the border metering station
with gas after this round of pigging to
dispose of any remaining powder and
prevent rapid clogging of the cartridge
filters. Gas vented during these blow
downs contained large amounts of
black powder (Fig. 5).
October 2003 cleaning pig operations covered the same pipeline section,
initially using a gauge pig and subsequently completing three runs with a
bidirectional pig. These efforts removed
770 kg of powder. Further cleaning
used a magnetic pig, after which the
pipeline section was declared clean and
inspected by first a profile pigging and
then an intelligent pigging (magnetic
flux leakage).
The intelligent pigging detected no
significant damage in the DEPA system,
proving that the black powder was not
being generated by DEPA’s pipeline
network but it was instead being transported from the upstream network with
the gas.

Filtration
The most common means of fighting solid contaminants is to filter them
at entrances of processing plants or networks. The nature of the black powder

examined here, however, works against
standard filtration; the particles are able
to shear easily at submicron sizes and
pass through gas separation devices and
filters capable of trapping particles as
small as submicron.
Filtration of black powder in flowing gas streams therefore requires extra
effort. Operators should replace or
clean filter elements at optimum points
shown by pressure differentials across
the filters to minimize flow resistance,
powder penetration, or overfill. Filtering might also require expensive
reinforced filter elements to prevent the
filter from collapsing under the weight
of the powder during gas flow.
DEPA installed two vertical cartridge
filters with dropout vessels at the border metering station entrance to remove
condensates, water, scale, or other
foreign matter from the gas. The filter
elements consist of fiberglass treated
with phenolic resins and silicone. They
collapse at a differential pressure larger
than 2 bar. The separation efficiency of
these elements is 100% for particles
larger that 3 μm, and 99% for particles
0.5-3 μm.
During the summer of 2001, DEPA
cleaned and replaced the cartridges of
these filters up to three times/week,
compared to an annual normal replacement frequency.

DEPA purged the valve station at the entrance of the border metering station
with gas after pigging in order to dispose of any remaining powder and
prevent rapid clogging of the cartridge filters, venting large amounts of black
powder in the process (Fig. 5).
Even with these inlet filters operating
continuously, however, DEPA continued
to find black powder deposits downstream in metering lines, metering
instruments, analyzers, densitometers,
and control valves. Despite the filter efficiency, enough small particles flowed
through filtration devices to agglomerate into larger masses downstream.
Operation of the cartridge filters
also limited gas offtake. Every time
the gas flow rate at the border metering station would rise above 200,000
cu m/hr, the pressure drop at the inlet
station cartridge filters experienced a
sudden and steep increase resulting in
automatic flow interruption. At high gas
flow rates, large black powder quantities were clogging a clean filter within a
few hours, requiring that flow rates be
kept low for safe system operation.
Cartridge filters should be used to
protect key installations, like metering

In order to protect its downstream system from black powder, DEPA installed
two cyclone (centrifugal) filtration facilities at the start of its network next
to the Bulgarian border. Use of these filters enhanced the effectiveness of trap
filters further downstream (Fig. 6).

facilities, by removing limited quantities of black powder from the gas.
The amount of black powder carried into DEPA’s network was inversely
related to the water dewpoint (WDP)
of the gas. During periods of high
WDP (increased humidity of the gas)
black powder quantities disposed of
at the filters were relatively lower than
during periods of low WDP for the
same gas flow rates. The higher density
of the partially wet powder inside the
pipe and the subsequent difficulty in
detaching the powder from the internal
pipeline wall and transporting it in the
gas flow led to this result.

Cyclone separators
In order to protect its downstream
system from black powder, DEPA installed two cyclone (centrifugal) filtration facilities (Fig. 6) at the start of its
network next to the Bulgarian border.

These filters separate 99% of contaminants larger than 5 μm. Each cyclone
uses a dedicated online dust collector
vessel.
These cyclone separators removed
black powder very efficiently. During second-half 2003, the cyclones
removed roughly 7,000 kg of black
powder; a quantity capable of clogging
the downstream cartridge filters several
times, thereby preventing normal gas
offtake.
The separators continuously gathered
the black powder in high-pressure dust
collectors placed below the cyclones.
Once full (roughly 1,000 kg), the separator would depressurize to remove the
debris. In addition to the dry powder,
the cyclones separated compressor oil
and water from the gas stream.

Late? Feel good;
you might be
saving energy
If you’re late for an appointment Mar. 12,
blame Congress, but feel good about yourself. You might be—cue the violins—saving
energy.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 added
about 4 weeks to Daylight Savings Time
(DST). This is supposed to—cue the violins
again—lower energy consumption.
DST now starts on the second Sunday
of March instead of the ﬁrst Sunday of April

and ends on the last Sunday of October
instead of the ﬁrst Sunday of November.
Clock time advances by 1 hr on Mar. 11.
While computers, servers, and various
gadgets with internal electronic clocks need
adjustment, experts say the change warrants no revival of Y2K anxiety.
The idea is to shrink the period during
which people need lighting. But will that really—violins, please—lower energy use?
California has studied DST and energy
use much recently. Last month, a staff
paper by Adrienne Kandel, in the Electricity
and Demand Analysis Division of the California Energy Commission, raised doubts.
“There is no clear evidence that electricity will be saved from the earlier start to
[DST] on Mar. 11, but the 7 p.m. peak load
will probably drop on the order of 3% for
the remainder of March, lowering capacity requirements,” Kandel concluded from
simulations of Californian energy-use
patterns. Extending DST by a week into
November would have similar but smaller
effects. Capacity constraints, she added,
“usually do not occur in March and early
November.”
With earlier DST California might,
Kandel said, save “a fraction of a percent
of total electricity use” unless a morning
electricity spike offsets the effect.
Apparently unsure about the nationwide
effectiveness of its DST tinkering in the energy bill, Congress ordered the Department
of Energy to do a quick follow-up study.
Whether or not the initiative proves to
have worked, date and time processing
functions need changing in all electronics
in or related to the US. And among those
sure to be overlooked may well be the one
you need for a reminder to be somewhere
important on time.
If catastrophe happens, however,
remember: In partnership with Congress,
you—one more time on the violins, crescendo—saved energy. Or not.

Proﬁt-taking ends 7-day rally
Energy prices slipped in proﬁt-taking Mar. 2, ending a 7-day rally of consecutive
gains on the New York market that had not been matched “since last year early in the
summer,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland.
The April contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes dipped by 36¢ to $61.64/
bbl Mar. 2 on the New York Mercantile Exchange yet still ended the session 1%
higher than where it opened at the beginning of the week. Earlier, the front-month
contract broke the $62/bbl barrier to an intraday trading high of $62.49/bbl on Mar.
1. The April contract for reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB)
was down 0.83¢ to $1.90/gal on Mar. 2, yet up 7% from its Feb. 26 opening price on
NYMEX.
The trading pattern remained similar during most of that week, with crude
“pulled higher by a very ﬁrm gasoline complex and pulled lower by the spillover of
the equity scare” from the Feb. 27 sell-off in global stock markets, Jakob said. The
sell-off, which took 9% off the China Shanghai Composite Index, resulted in part
from the Chinese government’s crackdown on speculation that had pushed Chinese
stock prices to record levels (OGJ Online, Feb. 28, 2007). The US stock market appeared to rebound in Feb. 28 trading, however.
There were still fears in some quarters that China’s energy demand may be slowing. However, Jakob reported that in January China for the ﬁrst time became a net
importer of coal. That changeover wasn’t expected until later this year. Moreover,
it represented “a major structural change not only for the global coal trade but for
the global energy balances; yet it has gone barely noticed as the numbers came out
at the same time as the Shanghai stock exchange collapse,” Jakob said. “Chinese
power and energy demand is not decreasing, and it would be wrong to discount it
on the basis of local stock market gyrations.”
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. reported
crude futures prices were down in early trading Mar. 5 following steep dives in
the Asian and European equity markets. The Nikkei index was down over 3%, and
increasing strength in the yen—the apparent unwinding of the currency carry
trade—induced a massive global sell-off that seemed poised to carry into US trading
that day.
However, as Raymond James analysts noted, oil prices remained relatively
strong, supported by tensions with Iran and concerns about gasoline supply as the
driving season approaches. Gas use was expected to moderate as temperatures rose
across the US West and parts of the eastern seaboard.
US inventories
The market was boosted by a report by the Energy Information Association that
commercial US gasoline stocks declined for the third consecutive week, down 1.9
million bbl to 220.2 million bbl in the week ended Feb. 23. Distillate fuel inventories
dropped 3.8 million bbl to 124.5 million bbl. Crude inventories, however, gained 1.4
million bbl to 329 million bbl (OGJ Online, Feb. 28, 2007). Propane and propylene
inventories declined by 2.8 million bbl to 31.9 million bbl.
Imports of crude into the US were down by 220,000 b/d to 9.5 million b/d that
week, partly because lightering operations were disrupted by fog along the Houston
Ship Channel. However, the input of crude into US reﬁneries increased by 196,000
b/d to 14.6 million b/d with units operating at 86% of capacity. Gasoline production
increased slightly to 8.7 million b/d; distillate fuel production increased to 3.9 million
b/d.
“Overall US stocks (including propane) have drawn down 42 million bbl over the
last month and are now 23 million bbl below last year. Excluding propane, stocks
have drawn down 22 million bbl over the month and are 16 million bbl below last
year,” said Jakob of Petromatrix.
The 4-week average of crude imports into the US through Feb. 23 was 390 million
b/d lower than in the same period last year, while gasoline imports were down by
266 million b/d. The 4-week average of gasoline production was up by 328 million b/d
from a year ago when reﬁnery runs were still recovering from damage by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The resulting imbalance of lower imports and higher demand
resulted in a gasoline stock draw of 4.4 million bbl over the latest 4-week period,
compared to builds of 3.5 million bbl in February 2006 and 7.1 million bbl in February
2005, Jakob said.

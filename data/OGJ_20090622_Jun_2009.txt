Offshore LNG loading is likee threading a needle on a trampoline:
it takes highly specialized equipment. Seven years ago we began
developing the world’s ﬁrst offshore LNG loading system. We designed
it with constant motion swivels to handle rapid, unpredictable motions.
We developed a patented cable targeting system to enable connection
under these same conditions. And we helped make offshore LNG
both practical and cost-effective. To see what we’ve done and how
we’re approaching a next generation, worst-condition solution,

General

Interest

TransCanada to take ownership of Keystone line
TransCanada Corp. reached agreement with ConocoPhillips
to buy its remaining interest in the Keystone pipeline system for
roughly $550 million plus the assumption of $200 million of
short-term debt. Upon completion of the transaction, TransCanada
will be sole owner of the project.
The purchase price reflects ConocoPhillips’s capital contributions to date and includes an allowance for funds used during construction. TransCanada will also assume ConocoPhillips’s share of
the costs associated with completing the project, an incremental
commitment of roughly $1.7 billion through the end of 2012.
Pending regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close
in the third quarter.
TransCanada’s 2,148-mile Keystone pipeline will transport oil
from Canada to the US Midwest. In addition to 1,379 miles of
newbuild US line, Keystone includes additions to existing Canadian pipelines and mainline flow reversals. It is expected to start up
in December 2009 with the capacity to deliver 435,000 b/d from
Hardisty, Alta., to the US at Wood River and Patoka, Ill.
TransCanada plans to extend the line to Cushing, Okla., starting
fourth-quarter 2010, expanding it to 590,000 b/d. It has secured
firm long-term contracts totaling 495,000 b/d for an average of
18 years.
New pipeline construction of 101 km in Manitoba was about
98% complete as of Apr. 15. TransCanada plans work on a total of
six spreads in South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois during 2009.
TransCanada announced plans in July 2008 for the Keystone
Gulf Coast Expansion Project (Keystone XL), providing 500,000
b/d additional capacity from western Canada to the US Gulf Coast
by 2012. Keystone XL has secured firm contracts for 380,000 b/d
for an average of 17 years from shippers.
Keystone XL includes 1,980 miles of 36-in. OD line starting in
Hardisty and extending to a delivery point near existing terminals
in Port Arthur, Tex. TransCanada anticipates beginning construction
in 2010, pending regulatory approvals, and intends to start the line
in 2012.
The combined Keystone pipeline system could be expanded to
1.5 million b/d from its as-built capacity of 1.09 million b/d if
warranted by market demand.

Gazprom chief forecasts $85/bbl oil at yearend
Oil prices should hit $85/bbl by the end of 2009, and if capital
investment is not restored, oil prices could rise to $150/bbl within
2-3 years, warned Alexey Miller, chief executive officer of OAO
Gazprom at the European Business Congress in Porto Cervo, Italy.
Miller said it was encouraging that oil prices had crept to $70/
bbl recently, adding that this was “a return to a precrisis trend” and

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

not “not a technical correction or accidental fluctuation.” At this
level, it was double the price at yearend 2008, but still far below
the peak reached in July 2008.
It was “financial transactions in the oil markets” and not the
physical market that caused low oil prices earlier this year, Miller
said. He forecasts that investment in exploration and production
will decline by more than 20% in 2009. Operators are reluctant to
proceed with projects because of the volatility of the market resulting in a reduction in production capacity and oil supplies within
3-5 years.
A year ago Miller said it was possible that oil prices could leap
to more than $250/bbl because of the major imbalance between
demand and supply of hydrocarbons by 2012.
Miller recommended that there be a radical overhaul in the operation of the oil market. “The problem is that today the price is
determined not on the physical oil market, but on a market for
financial instruments. As a consequence, the oil price greatly depends not on fundamental factors, not on the real oil demand and
supply, but on the activities of speculating investors.”
Miller suggested that long-term oil supply contracts could help
exchange trading as it would contain the “impact of speculative
capital on the oil price” and help to drive out “economically unjustified intermediaries.”

Ecuador appoints Pinto as oil, mining minister
Ecuador President Rafael Correa, vowing to crack down on international oil companies operating in his country, has sworn in
Germanico Pinto as the country’s oil and mining minister.
“We’re going to radicalize our citizens’ revolution…and that
radicalization implies demanding respect,” said Correa after Pinto
was sworn in. “Germanico will take a much firmer approach toward all these companies that think they can still keep abusing the
country.”
Correa said of the companies: “They refuse to pay taxes, and on
top of that, they take us to arbitration and press charges against us
seeking millions,” adding, “We are heading in the right direction.
These multinational companies know they can’t play around with
Ecuador anymore.”
Shortly after assuming his new position, Pinto—essentially
playing with words—said there was no need for the government
to nationalize the oil industry “because the oil already belongs to
the state.”
Without providing any details, Pinto said he will promote “a
deep change in…how we have been developing productive activities as well as energy and environment activities.”
Pinto also said current oil prices are reasonable, adding that he
sees no need for a cut in output by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, which Ecuador rejoined last year.

Pinto succeeds Derlis Palacios, who offered his resignation last
month after failing to resolve several key disputes, including one
with Perenco SA, which has declined to pay $338 million that Ecuador claims since raising taxes in 2007 to 99% on windfall oil
earnings.
Perenco claims that the windfall tax violates its contract and has
taken its case to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a branch of the World Bank.
In response, the Ecuadoran government seized 70% of Perenco’s
output in March and tried to auction it in May, despite a ruling by
ICSID calling for suspension of the sale until a final judgment had
been reached.
Repsol YPF SA also has approached ICSID for resolution of the
tax issue, while Occidental Petroleum Corp. has applied to ICSID
for $1 billion in compensation for oil fields seized by Correa’s predecessor in 2006.

Newﬁeld reports deepwater GOM discoveries
Newfield Exploration Co. reported two natural gas discoveries
in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico: Pyrenees on Garden Banks Block
293 and Winter on Garden Banks Block 605.
Pyrenees, drilled in 2,100 ft of water, encountered 125 ft of net
pay in three intervals. This could prove to be the company’s largest
discovery, a Newfield spokesman said.
He described Pyrenees as a gas-condensate discovery. The well
was temporarily abandoned pending development plans.
Delineation drilling is planned for the second half of this year.
Newfield operates Pyrenees and holds 40% working interest. Partners include Stone Energy Corp. 15%, Ridgewood Energy Corp.
15%, Arena Exploration 15%, and Deep Gulf Energy 15%.
Winter, drilled in 3,400 ft of water, found 44 ft of net pay in
two sands. The well was temporarily abandoned. Development options are being considered.
Newfield operates Winter and holds 30% working interest. Partners include Apache Corp. 25%, Deep Gulf Energy 25%, and Royal
Offshore 20%.

Tullow Oil has success with Kigogole-3 well
Tullow Oil PLC, London, will suspend its Kigogole-3 exploration well as a future oil-producer following the discovery of more
than 20 m of net pay from two separate zones on Uganda’s Block
2.
The well reached 575 m TD and encountered “excellent” reservoir sands. The Kasamene-type reservoir sands were in the lower
zone with more than 15 m of net oil pay. Thin-bedded oil-bearing
sands also were found in another 5 m total net reservoir section
above the 15 m main reservoir interval.
Angus McCoss, exploration director at Tullow Oil, said this dis-

Following Perenco’s lawsuit, and faced with those of Repsol YPF
and Oxy, Ecuador announced its intention to withdraw from ICSID
on May 31, claiming that the court had a bias in favor of Western
corporate interests.
According to analyst BMI, Palacios’s departure “heralds a further
leftward shift of Correa’s administration, whose radical agenda has
been emboldened by a comprehensive victory following the April
2009 elections.”
In view of this, BMI said it expects the government to drive a
harder bargain during the ongoing restructuring of the Ecuadorian
oil industry, which aims to confine oil operators to a position of
service providers to state-run Petroecuador.
“Given the continuously deteriorating operating terms, further
exits by foreign players may be expected over the next few years,”
BMI said. ✦

covery in the Butiaba region of Block 2 reaffirms the exceptional
quality of the prospects within the Victoria Nile Delta play. “We
are steadily drilling our prospect inventory in this region and this
continued success is enabling us to make significant progress on
new leads and prospects. The ongoing campaign will help us define
the ultimate limits of this very prolific petroleum system,” McCoss
said.
Kigogole-3 was drilled southwest of the Kigogole-1 oil discovery. The company said these results lower the risks of some
of the adjacent prospects to be drilled later this year on Blocks
1 and 2.
Tullow Oil will now drill the Wahrindi prospect, which is 13 km
to the southwest of this well. Drilling is to start later this month,
close to the shore of Lake Albert. This well will be drilled to a depth
of about 1,300 m.

Murphy Oil Corp., El Dorado, Ark., found oil at one exploratory
well and gas at another off Malaysia.
A well on the Siakap North prospect in 4,300 ft of water on
Block K off Sabah 6 miles from Kikeh field found oil-bearing pay
sands of similar age and quality to those at Kikeh. Murphy is evaluating development options including tieback to Kikeh.
A well in 89 ft of water on the East Patricia prospect in Block SK
309 off Sarawak cut 230 ft of net natural gas pay. It is 23 miles off
the Bintulu onshore gas receiving facility under construction for
the Sarawak gas development.

Algar is about 8 km east of Pod 1 and covers eight sections
about 80 km south of Fort McMurray.
Alberta’s Energy Resources Conservation Board approved the
project on Nov. 13, 2008.
As with Pod 1, Connacher has designed Algar to produce 10,000
b/d of bitumen.
The company expects the project to cost a total of $359 million
(Can.), including deferral costs of $14 million.
To date, it has completed an 8-km road, site work on the well
pads and plant site, and has constructed and stored major component parts for the plant facility offsite. It estimates that completion
of the project requires and additional $200 million (Can.).
The company says following completion of a brief prestart-up
organizational period, the work at Algar, including drilling of 15
SAGD well pairs, will last about 275 days from commencement of
field activities.
Following this, the company expects that it will need 30 days to
commission the plant and 90 days to steam the SAGD wells before
bitumen production starts.

Jubilee ﬁeld subsea system ordered
The Jubilee integrated project team placed an order with FMC
Technologies Inc. for designing and manufacturing a subsea production system for the Jubilee deepwater development in 4,0005,100 ft of water off Ghana.
The Jubilee integrated project team consists of Kosmos Energy
Inc. (technical operator), Anadarko Petroleum Corp., and Tullow
Oil & Gas PLC (unit operator).
The Jubilee discovery well, Mahogany-1, found 312 ft of net
pay in Cretaceous sandstone.
Appraisal wells Mahogany-2 and Mahogany-3 on the West Cape
Three Points block and wells Hyedua-1 and Hyedua-2 on the adjacent Deepwater Tano block delineated the discover.
Kosmos says drillstem tests of the Mahogany-2 and Hyedua-2
wells indicated individual wells could produce more than 20,000
bo/d.
Kosmos and its partners plan a fast-track development of Jubilee, targeting first production for 2010 with the first phase tapping
about 300 million bbl of oil (OGJ Online, June 12, 2009).
FMC will supply 19 enhanced horizontal subsea trees, 5 production manifolds, 3 injection manifolds, a pair of riser bases,
and associated control systems, with subsea equipment deliveries
scheduled to begin in 3 months.
FMC expects to realize $210 million from the order.
Production will flow to a leased turret-moored floating production, storage, and offloading vessel, owned and operated by Modec
Inc. The lease is for 7 years with 13 1-year options.

Hibernia southern extension work advances
Development of the southern extension of Hibernia oil and gas
field off Newfoundland has advanced with tentative agreement on
fiscal terms.
Hibernia partners and the government of Newfoundland and
Labrador have signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding providing for a provincial equity stake of 10% and a top royalty
rate of 50%.
Premier Danny Williams announced the agreement at the annual conference of the Newfoundland and Labrador Oil and Gas
Industries Association.
Provincially owned Nalcor Energy would pay $30 million for
an equity interest in 170 million bbl of oil expected to be produced through subsea wells tied back to the Hibernia gravity-base
structure. It also would pay a $2.50/bbl processing fee for its oil.
Depending on oil prices, the top royalty for this production would
be 42.5%.
For the rest of the 220 million bbl of recoverable oil in the
southern-extension area, development would occur from the existing structure. For this oil, the royalty rate would be 42.5% with
no price trigger.
The new peak 50% royalty would apply to new licenses in the
Hibernia area.
Field operator Hibernia Management & Development Co.
(HMDC) recently has been producing 136,000 b/d of oil and 256
MMscfd of natural gas through its platform in 80 m of water 315
km east-southeast of St. John’s. The royalty rate has reached 30%.
HMDC applied for development of the Hibernia southern extension in May 2006 but met resistance from the province, which
required additional information.
Since then, HMDC has applied for the part of the development
that would use the existing platform. It hasn’t filed a development
plan for the subsea-tieback scheme.
Hibernia field came on stream in November 1997 and has produced 670 million bbl of oil. ✦

Model for our technologies.
Lurgi is the worldwide leading partner when clean conversion is postulated. We command
sustainable processes which allow us to make better use of oil resources or biomass than
ever before.
With our technologies we can produce synthesis gases, hydrogen or carbon monoxide: for
downstream conversion to petrochemicals. Based on resources like natural gas, coal and tar
sand we produce synthesis gas which we convert into low-pollutant fuels.
Enhanced sustainability: from biomass which does not compete with the food chain, we
can recover ultra-pure fuels burning at a low pollutant emission rate which are excellently
suited for reducing the carbon footprint. You see, we are in our element when it comes to
sustainable technologies.

The Jubail refinery originally was to have processed Arabian
Heavy crude and a new grade from Manifa. In a statement about
the contract-award plan, the joint venture mentioned only Arabian
Heavy.
The venture will let contracts for 13 process packages for the
Jubail refinery, which will maximize yields of diesel and jet fuels
and also produce 700,000 tonnes/year of paraxylene, 140,000
tonnes/year of benzene, and 200,000 tonnes/year of polymergrade propylene.

Algeria gas project moves ahead
Algeria’s Sonatrach has hired Canada’s SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.,
Montreal, to build natural gas handling facilities in eastern Algeria.
The Algerian state company awarded SNC a $1.1 billion,
39-month contract to build a gas gathering system, gas processing
plant, and carbon dioxide reinjection facilities to serve four fields:
Rhourde Nouss Central, Rhourde Nouss Southwest, Rhourde Adra,
and Rhourde Adra South. The gas processing plant will be at nearby
Qartzites de Hamra.
Due for completion in 2012, the project will allow Sonatrach
to process and treat about 353 MMscfd, which would generate,
according to Algerian Oil Minister Chakib Khelil, about $500 million/year in export revenues. The project will also produce 16,000
b/d of condensate, according to other published reports.
Residue gas from the plant will move more than 1,000 km
to Arzew, on Algeria’s northwestern Mediterranean coast, where
Sonatrach is building a 4.7-million tonne/day train to come on

line in 2012. That project will expand the already installed 16.4
million tonnes/year of LNG production capacity at that site.

Clean-fuel specs strain South African reﬁners
South African refiners will need to invest $4.95 billion by 2014
to comply with clean-fuel specifications, a senior Sasol SA official
said earlier this month.
Sasol Executive Director Benny Mokaba said, “Refineries cannot
afford to put in the equipment that is required. That’s 40 billion
rand that doesn’t add an additional liter.”
Mokaba warned of a clash between the high costs of improving
fuel standards and the growing focus on cleaner fuels technology
in the country. He said it was important not to jeopardize economic growth.
South Africa’s fuel meets Euro 2 emission standards, but European countries have progressed to Euro 5 standards, which lower
allowable emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Refiners have requested a 5-year delay to have sufficient time to deliver Euro 4 standards.
Speaking at the South African National Energy Association Action for Energy conference in Johannesburg, Mokaba said there
could be shortfalls of domestically produced fuels and the need to
increase imports.
Nelisiwa Magubane, deputy director-general at South Africa’s
Department of Energy, said the government would seek greater
stakeholder participation to implement its integrated energy plan.
She said integrated energy planning had formerly “fallen flat”
for numerous reasons, one of which was enabling legislation. ✦

Papua New Guinea LNG partners start work early
ExxonMobil Corp.’s Papua New Guinea LNG project has moved
forward another step with the partners agreeing to begin early
work activities.
The activities include a range of infrastructure programs like
the upgrade and repair of roads, construction of camps, wharf upgrades, early site preparation in the highlands, establishment of
training facilities and ordering long lead time items.
Development of this type of infrastructure will contribute towards a swift beginning to the main construction work in early
2010 following final investment decision for the project expected
later this year.
The early work will comprise an accelerated investment of
about $600 million during the next 12 months prior to the final
investment decision and is seen as a major vote of confidence and
commitment in the project as a whole.
The early works agreement follows the recent signing of the
umbrella benefits sharing agreement as well as progress made on
marketing the LNG.
This month a major construction contract for upstream civil
infrastructure was awarded to the Clough Curtain engineering
joint venture. ExxonMobil also signed an agreement with KBR and
WorleyParsons EOS joint venture for services such as training, incountry support and integrated project team services for construction and project management of the development.

storage facility in depleted Ten Section gas field 10 miles southwest
of Bakersfield that would enter service in January 2012.
Tricor Ten Section Hub LLC said the field would have 22.4 bcf
of working gas capacity and 10.1 bcf of base gas. It said the field
would provide four high-speed cycles per year with a maximum
withdrawal rate of 1 bcfd and a maximum injection rate of 0.8
bcfd.
An application filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the field will initially connect with the Kern RiverMojave interstate pipeline.
Later potential tie-ins with California’s two intrastate systems,
Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co., would give
the hub a “combined lateral surrounding optionality” of more
than 4 bcfd.
Tricor started an open season for Ten Section’s capacity on June
1. It asked that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issue
a certificate by February 2010.
Ten Section field was discovered in 1936. ✦

HOW CAN YOU TRANSPORT
YOUR REMOTE NATURAL GAS
AND MAKE A PROFIT?
THE PROFITABLE SOLUTION TO YOUR DIFFICULT LOCATION.
SYNFUELS INTERNATIONAL. Synfuels plants operate upstream at the wellhead to
process natural gas into liquid fuel you can pipe, truck, barge or transport by rail to market. Synfuels
International has developed and patented an alternative to the conventional methods which are
cost-prohibitive for upstream conversion. Our proven process significantly reduces capital and
process costs and is environmentally friendly. By directly converting natural gas into a high-octane
gasoline at the wellhead, the Synfuels technology alleviates the necessity for a natural gas pipeline
and will produce superior end products at a cost below conventional technology. The Synfuels
technology is the ideal solution for remote and stranded as well as associated flared natural gas
worldwide and will bring a much more cost-effective, cleaner-burning fuel to market.

IT’S NOT A PIPEDREAM, IT’S SYNFUELS.

We put our drives through the most grueling
tests imaginable. And then things got really bad.
In 2005 Hurricane Katrina battered the Gulf, unleashing a
relentless torrent on the platform. The equipment room that
housed TMEIC GE’s Dura-Bilt5i™ Medium Voltage drives was
ﬂooded and abandoned.
When engineers reopened the platform
in 2006, the Dura-Bilt5i drives started up
without incident. While it was an
extraordinary situation, it underscores
the reliability of our drives, even in the
world’s most demanding environments,
conditions, and climates.
The world is a tough place. That’s why
you need a tough drive.

Beyond fundamentals
More remarkable than hints of oil market recovery this month is growing acceptance that supply
and demand don’t always paint the whole picture.
Current conditions illustrate the void. Oil prices
have zoomed despite demand weakness and supply health evident in full inventories and resurgent
production-capacity surpluses.
The recovery signals are weak. Inventories relative to demand eased slightly in May. And in June
market reports, the International Energy Agency,
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
and US Energy Information Administration quit
cutting forecasts for annual average consumption by as much as they had done in preceding
months. IEA and EIA actually raised their projections marginally. OPEC, although trimming its
demand outlook, declared, “The worst appears to
be behind us.”

Recovery?
But these are indications of a possible end to
the market’s slide, not necessarily of recovery.
Nothing says market projections won’t resume
their slump next month. Nothing says demand,
even if it has quit falling, won’t stay depressed.
Yet marker prices of crude oil seem to herald
recovery. The futures price for light, sweet crude
has traded lately above $70/bbl. EIA expects the
second-half average price of West Texas Intermediate oil to exceed the first-half number by $16/
bbl. How can this be? Supply and demand—the
“fundamentals”—provide no ready answer.
Other influences must be at work. “Prospects
for equity markets and the global economy, backed
up by exchange-rate fluctuations, expectations
about future oil market tightness, and, by inference, a shift of money into or out of futures markets can all influence short-term prices,” says IEA
in its June Oil Market Report. “Indeed, it is tempting to conclude that the shift in [New York Mercantile Exchange] WTI noncommercial positions
from a net 11,000 short in early May to 40,000
net long a month later is sufficient explanation for
the surge in prices” of more than 20% during May
and into early June.
OPEC’s June Monthly Oil Market Report notes
the apparent failure of fundamental market weakness to suppress oil prices. “Financial market
developments,” it says, help explain “this recent
divergence between oil market fundamentals and
18

prices.” Crude price changes recently have correlated with changes in equity markets, as traders
anticipate the oil-demand boost that will accompany economic recovery, and in value of the US
dollar.
Similarly, EIA’s Short Term Energy Outlook this
month attributed May oil price gains partly to
“expectations of a global economic recovery and
future increases in oil consumption.” Also, it said,
“a weaker dollar and increasing financial market
activity are prompting higher prices for commodities, overshadowing weak oil supply and demand
fundamentals.”
At this time last year, IEA and EIA remained
reluctant to attribute surging oil prices, then approaching $130/bbl, to forces other than supply
and demand. “In reality,” wrote IEA in June 2008,
“these abnormally high prices are largely explained by fundamentals.” EIA’s June 2008 report
cited supply uncertainty and demand growth and
predicted, “The overall picture of strong demand
and tight supply is expected to continue.”
Only OPEC, ever wary of oil-price speculation,
in the middle of last year looked unapologetically
beyond market fundamentals. “In the absence of
any change in fundamentals, this strong [price]
volatility reconfirms the view that current price
levels do not reflect supply and demand realities but are strongly influenced by future market
activities and the prevailing bullish sentiment,” it
said.
Now all three agencies assert factors other than
supply and demand, especially dollar gyrations
and financial-market dynamics, as important in
the determination of oil prices, at least in the short
term. Doing so doesn’t disengage them from market theory. Dollars and investment flows are part of
the market, after all.

Broadened view
Last year’s record indicates the broadened view
might, to the benefit of everyone, improve forecasting. After listing the nonfundamental forces
elevating oil prices in 2008, OPEC wrote, “A
review of prospects for the remainder of the year
also shows little support for prices to remain at
current levels.”
That was in June. Crude prices began a
5-month, $90/bbl plunge in the middle of
July. ✦

Among China, Europe, and Russia, the competition over oil and gas
from Central Asia and the Caucasus is
intense and growing. In this rivalry
China enjoys a cash advantage, while
Russia builds on decades-long cultural
and political ties. European companies
offer more-advanced technology than
is available from their Chinese and Russian competitors.
Rivalries aside, the
external powers share
an interest in promoting
political stability in this
major energy-producing
region. Competition for
political influence is likely
to complicate the full
utilization of the Caspian hydrocarbon
wealth (see related story nearby).
More regional and international
cooperation is needed. The speedy
development of the region’s oil and gas
resources would benefit all concerned
parties.

Central Asian, Caucasus
energy rivalries intensify

European security
Europe, with its high standards of
living and limited hydrocarbon resources, brings to this competition an
historic reliance on external energy
supplies. In 2008, Europe imported
54% of its energy.
Heavy dependence
on foreign supplies has prompted
European leaders to
articulate a strategy
to enhance their
energy security. In
November 2008,
the European Commission issued a new strategy, called the
EU Energy Security and Solidarity Action Plan, underscoring the significance
of good relations with energy suppliers.
The Caspian region already supplies oil and gas to the EU. Azerbaijan
and Kazakhstan export oil to several
European countries. Similarly, since
2007 small but growing volumes of
Azeri gas has reached several European
destinations. In the next few years, oil
and gas production from the Caspian
20

region is projected to rise, and Europe’s
dependence on imported supplies will
deepen. The Caspian region therefore is
likely to play a bigger role in meeting
the EU’s energy needs. The question is
how to ensure the continuity of these
supplies.
The EU has simultaneously pursued
several strategies. The Nabucco pipeline
is at the heart of European efforts to
secure energy supplies outside of Russia. It would bring Central Asian gas to
Europe without passing through Russian territory. A consortium of European
energy companies, including Turkey’s
Botas AS, Bulgarian Energy Holding
EAD, MOL PLC of Hungary, Austria’s
OMV Gas & Power GMBH, RWE AG of
Germany, and Transgaz SA of Romania,
has been planning Nabucco’s construction since 2002.
The EU sponsored two conferences
in 2009—one in Budapest in January
and the other in Prague in May—to
rally support for the scheme. In Prague,
Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, and Turkey
signed an agreement to participate in
the huge project, while Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan refused
to sign due to pressure from Russia.
The pipeline would connect eastern
Turkey, transiting Bulgaria, Romania,
and Hungary, with Austria. It would
carry 31 billion cu m/year of gas,
starting in 2014. Engineering began in
April.
Another proposal is the Trans-Caspian pipeline between Turkmenistan and
Turkey via Azerbaijan and Georgia. The
EU strongly supports the construction
of this link; however, the project faces
hurdles including the lack of agreement
on the legal status of the Caspian and
strong opposition from Iran and Russia.
Another project under construction
is the Samsun-Ceyhan pipeline, which
will carry Russian and Kazakh oil from
Turkey’s Black Sea port of Samsun to
Ceyhan on the Mediterranean coast.
The project is being developed by a
50-50 joint venture between Italy’s
ENI and Turkey’s Calik Energy. It will
bypass Turkey’s narrow and dangerously congested Bosporus Strait and

about meeting its contractual obligations. Russia’s domestic consumption
is rising while production is stagnant.
One solution is to fill this growing gap
by importing gas from the Caspian producers and reselling it to Europe. Another option is to consolidate Moscow’s
control over transit routes from the
region. This strategic framework makes
Russia’s recent initiatives in Central Asia
and the Caucasus easy to understand.

production, and 9.3% of oil consumption. Its gas shares were 1.1% of global
reserves, 2.4% of production, and 2.3%
of consumption. China’s oil consumption will grow by an average rate of
3.4%/year between 2005 to 2030, the
highest in the world. Its gas consumption will grow by a world-leading
5.5%/year in that period. China has

reserves. In 2008 their combined share
of global oil production was 3.2%, and
that of gas was 3.5%. Recent discoveries strongly suggest that the region’s oil
and gas production will substantially
increase.
The scope and timing of oil and gas
development in these three Caspian Sea
states depend on two dynamics. One
is the availability of foreign investment
and technology, which in turn depends
on the approach authorities in Baku,
Astana, and Ashgabat take toward international oil companies. The other is the
yet-unclear ability of export capacity to
keep pace with expected increases in
oil and gas production in the region.
The rivalry between regional and global
powers will have a great impact on
pipeline construction.
Reviews of recent energy developments in these countries follow:

Azerbaijan
Since independence, Azerbaijan has
taken a more pro-Western, foreign
investment-friendly approach than
most other regional powers. This opening to international oil companies has
contributed to the vast expansion of
the country’s hydrocarbon production.
Most of the oil comes from the AzeriChirag-Guneshli structure, developed by
Azerbaijan International Operating Co.
The bulk
of Azeri
oil is
exported
via two
major
pipelines:
BakuTbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC), with a terminal at
the Turkish port on the Mediterranean,
and Baku-Novorossiysk, with a terminal
at the Russian port on the Black Sea.
Azerbaijan has a similarly successful
story with natural gas. The country’s
production almost doubled in the last
decade. Most of the gas comes from
three fields—Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli,
Bakhar, and Shah Deniz. The latest is
considered one of the world’s largest
gas discoveries in the last few decades.
24

T E R E S T
In 2007 Azerbaijan became a net gas
exporter. Azeri gas moves mainly to
Turkey with small volumes to Georgia
and Iran. The major gas pipeline is the
South Caucasus, known also as BakuTbilisi-Erzurum, which runs parallel
to the BTC for most of its route with a
connection to the Turkish gas network.

Kazakhstan
Given its
size and massive hydrocarbon reserves,
Kazakhstan
has the potential soon
to become a
major energy
exporter. Astana’s oil and gas production has more than tripled over the
last decade. Most of the country’s oil
comes from Tengiz and Karachaganak
fields. Kashagan field, discovered in
2000, is the largest oil field outside the
Middle East and the fifth largest in the
world in terms of reserves. ENI was
the major operator of the international
consortium developing Kashagan until
early 2008, when the Kazakh government doubled its stake in the scheme
and stripped ENI of its leading role.
Kashagan is scheduled to come on
stream in 2013; however, geological
and environmental hurdles might delay
production.
Kazakhstan exports most of its oil via
three major pipelines. Traditionally, Kazakhstan used to export all its oil via the
Atyrau-Samara pipeline, a northbound
link to the Russian distribution system.
In recent years, pumping and heating
stations were added to the pipeline.
Astana, however, has decided to diversify its oil shipment routes.
The Caspian Pipeline Consortium
(CPC) connects Kazakhstan’s oil fields
in the Caspian Sea with Novorossiysk. It
is the only export pipeline on Russian
territory with partially private ownership. CPC was officially inaugurated in
October 2001. Expansion of the CPC,
including additional pump stations and
storage facilities, is planned.

The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline
represents an important diversification
step. The pipeline connects oil fields in
Atasu in northwest Kazakhstan with
Alashankou in China’s northwestern
Xinjiang region. China started receiving Kazakh oil in 2006. Kazakhstan also
agreed to swap arrangements with Iran.
And Astana has endorsed a plan to build
a link connecting oil fields to the BakuTbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.
Almost all Kazakh gas is
associated with oil production, with Karachaganak and
Tengiz the largest sources.
Kazakh gas, along with that of
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan,
is shipped via the Central Asia
Center connecting western
Kazakhstan with Russia’s gas system.

Turkmenistan
Unlike Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan has limited oil reserves
but some of the richest gas endowments in Central Asia. Upon independence, Turkmen gas was seen as
a competitor to that of Russia. All
Turkmenistan gas was exported to Russia via the Central Asia Center pipeline,
and the two countries became locked in
a price dispute. As a result, Turkmen gas
production stagnated for most of the
1990s.
The two nations have signed several
agreements since the late 1990s, and
Turkmen gas production has since skyrocketed. In addition to gas deals with
Moscow, two other developments have
boosted production and brightened the
outlook: discoveries and a change in
political leadership.
Most of Turkmenistan’s gas comes
from Dauletabad and Shatlyk fields. In
the mid-2000s the supergiant South
Yolotan-Osman was discovered in the
southeastern part of the country. In
October 2008 an independent audit
confirmed that the field was among the
world’s biggest. In August 2008 another
large field, South Gutlyayak, was discovered.
In addition to the Central Asia Center
pipeline, a small proportion of Turkmen

gas is exported to Iran via the Korpedzhe-Kurt Kai pipeline. Built in 1997,
it was the first in
Central Asia to bypass
Russia.
Following the
death of President Saparmurat Niyazov in
December 2006, his
successor, Gurbanguly
Berdymukhammedov,
promised a fresh start in domestic and
foreign policies. The new president
invited international oil companies
to develop the country’s hydrocar-

bon deposits. Though he declared the
county “open for business,” authorities
say Turkmenistan will
develop its vast onshore
resources itself. International oil companies
will be limited to exploration in the Caspian
Sea and offered service
contracts rather than
production-sharing
agreements.
Berdymukhammedov has sought to
diversify gas exports. In addition to the
links to Russia and Iran, his government
is negotiating gas deals with Pakistan

and India via the so-called Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI)
or Trans-Afghanistan pipeline. In July
2007 Ashgabat and Beijing signed an
agreement under which the former will
supply the latter 30 billion cu m/year
of gas for 30 years via the proposed
Central Asia Gas pipeline. China will
participate in development of Turkmen
gas fields.
In April 2008 Berdymukhammedov
signed an agreement with Germany’s
RWE to explore for and develop gas
fields in Turkmenistan and agreed to
supply the European Union with 10 billion cu m of natural gas. ✦

• Remaining established, 170 billion bbl.
• 2008 production, 0.477 billion bbl (1.3 million b/d).
• Ultimate potential, 315 billion bbl.
The report reduced the established reserves in Peace River
but increased by 14.5 townships the area suitable for mining in the Athabasca region, resulting in a 1.9 billion bbl
decrease in initial established reserves.
Of the 170 billion bbl remaining established reserves,
ERCB considers 80%, or 135 billion bbl recoverable with in
situ methods and the remaining 34 billion bbl recoverable
with surface mining methods.
The in situ volumes include production with enhanced
recovery methods, such as injection of steam, water, or other
solvents into the reservoir to mobilize the bitumen, as well
as bitumen and heavy oil produced with primary methods
from the Athabasca, Peace River, and Cold Lake regions.
In 2008, average production from the three oil sands areas
was:
• Athabasca, 721,500 b/d mined, 232,100 b/d in situ.
• Cold Lake, 310,700 b/d in situ.
• Peace River, 42,000 b/d in situ.
The reports says companies drilled 4,627 wells in the oil
sands in 2008. Of these, 1,209 were development wells and
3,428 were exploratory wells.
About 9,700 wells were on production in the oil sands
during 2008, with the average well producing 62 bo/d, according to the report. ✦

Groningen ﬁeld to produce
gas for another 50 years
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Supergiant Groningen natural gas field in the northern
reaches of the Netherlands will continue to produce gas
for at least another 50 years, according to Roelf Venhuizen,
managing director of Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij BV
(NAM).
NAM, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell PLC and ExxonMobil Corp., operates the field, which has so far produced
1,700 billion cu m of gas since first starting production in
1963. To date, Groningen’s reserves are 60% depleted and it
holds 1,000-1,100 bcm of gas still to be recovered.
Groningen underpinned the development of a gas market in northwest Europe. Speaking at the 50th anniversary
celebrations in Groningen, Venhuizen said the company has
drafted a business plan to 2068 that involved the field. “I’m
convinced that gas storage will last beyond that,” he told
an audience comprising Her Majesty Queen Beatrix of the

Belize’s energy
independence

O

ne of the more remarkable
things about the oil and gas
industry is its ability to penetrate
every nook and cranny of the known
world. Even the tiniest of countries
count. Consider Belize.
About 22,960 sq km in size,
Belize lies south of Mexico, east of
Guatemala, and is just a 2-hr flight
from Houston or Miami. With just
320,000 people, Belize has the lowest population density in Central
America.
Yet, even those 320,000 people
need all the amenities that oil and gas
can provide, especially when the local
population is augmented by tourists. In the past year, Belize has seen
150,000 tourists arriving by cruise
ship alone.
That adds up to a lot of energy
demand—even for such a tiny country. Altogether, according to the US
Energy Information Administration,
Belize consumed 7,400 b/d of oil in
2007—more than twice the 3,210
b/d the country required in 1998.

Production shortfall
As for production, Belize Natural
Energy struck oil in the country 3
years ago, with output at 2,260 b/d
in 2006. Since then, the figure has
climbed. As of February, production
from BNE’s seven wells averaged
4,300 b/d.
That leaves a consumption-production shortfall of 3,100 b/d—a
shortfall that creates space for international political maneuvering.
As might be expected, Venezuela
President Hugo Chavez has his hand
in Belize’s politics. In 2006, under its
PetroCaribe scheme, Venezuela began

28

to supply Belize with 4,000 b/d of
products.
In 2007, former Belizean Prime
Minister Said Musa sought more help
from Chavez, saying, “We’re examining the possibility of a small refinery
or a topping up plant to produce
diesel in Belize.”
Musa also said Belize needed to
find its own oil. “As you know we
have a small infantile oil industry—
infant industry—producing about
3,000 b/d and we, of course, need to
do more exploration.”

Empty promises
In 2007, Venezuela mentioned
plans to study construction of a
small refinery in Belize, but nothing
resulted.
Belize took steps to secure the refinery, with a 2,500 b/d facility now
operated by the Blue Sky Co., while
it also signed a production-sharing
agreement with Taiwan’s state-owned
CPC in January.
There’s irony here as CPC had its
Venezuelan oil assets nationalized by
the Chavez regime and is still negotiating compensation with Venezuela
for its $85.2 million investment.
Could CPC’s exploration off Belize
yield financial results to exceed
that $85.2 million loss, even as the
Caribbean nation achieves a measure
of energy security? Even the Taiwanese are being cautious after getting
burned by Chavez.
“We’ll send a team there (to Belize) to evaluate the potential for oil,”
said CPC spokesman Chu Shao-hua.
“It’s a high-risk area,” said Chu, referring to South and Central America.
“You’ve got to be reasonable in your
investment there.” ✦

Netherlands, politicians, and company
representatives.
More than 300 wells have been
drilled on the field, which spans 900
sq km. Its pressure from 350 bar is falling meaning that NAM has invested in
compressors at most of the production
clusters to keep it going. The company
has spent €2 billion over 15 years to
maintain long-term production with
the work program involving modernizing the plant and technology, ensuring
the operation is fully unmanned, and
improving environmental standards.
“The last site will be modernized
with new compressors in September,”
Venhuizen stated.
Groningen is not empty now
because the Dutch government has
implemented a policy of focusing on
small fields; this has meant that Groningen has adopted the role of a swing
supplier. Due to the small fields policy,
gas volumes equivalent to half of Groningen field have been discovered in
hundreds of others.
But since the field’s discovery in
1959, energy markets have become
politicized and liberalized. The Netherlands must plan for the next stage in
the gas cycle as it will no longer be a
net exporter in 15 years, urged Maria
van der Hoeven, Dutch minister of
economic affairs. So far, Groningen has
brought €160 billion in revenues for
the country.
“We want to be a gas hub for northwest Europe with gas storage capacity,
transport capacity, and trading opportunities. We need to look at new partnerships to realize this,” van der Hoeven
said.
She added that the government is
keen to develop LNG import terminals
and pipelines to diversify its supplies in
the future and it was keen to see an improvement in the gas markets. “We’re in
the transition period from fossil fuels to
nonfossil fuels and we’re trying to develop policy on this. It requires working
with companies and the support of the
population, particularly for gas storage
and carbon capture and storage.”
But the meltdown of the financial

price unrest

US

retail gasoline prices reached
an average $2.67/gal on
June 15, nearly 60¢ above their
average on May 4, the US Energy
Information Administration reported.
Higher oil prices were the primary
culprit, American Petroleum Institute
officials told reporters.
“Most analysts have seen an
improvement in the worldwide
economy, which has helped several
commodities including crude oil,”
API Chief Economist John C. Felmy
said. Production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose members apparently are
showing more discipline than usual,
also contributed, he said.
Ronald Planting, API’s statistics
director, added, “We’ve had some
demand growth for gasoline, not
terribly strong but much more than
for other products. The industry is
producing near-record amounts.”
Refinery utilization rates have held
up better than rates for US manufacturing as a whole, Planting said,
adding that at 84%, it’s 20 percentage points higher than the domestic
manufacturing average, he said.
The average US retail gasoline
price should reach its summer seasonal peak in July, with a monthly
average near $2.70/gal, EIA said in
its latest short-term energy outlook
on June 9.

Gasoline demand rises
EIA expects overall oil products demand to drop by an average
550,000 b/d this year because of
the weakened US economy, but it
anticipates a 30,000 b/d increase in
average gasoline demand because of

30

significantly lower prices and stabilized disposal incomes.
API’s Felmy said, “Right now,
gasoline costs about $1,700-1,800 of
the consumer’s yearly budget, down
about $1,000 from a year ago.”
The US Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has been
preparing an energy bill with several
provisions. But other committees
on both sides of the Capitol seem
more concerned with closing what
they consider commodity trading
loopholes that contributed to 2008’s
dramatic oil price spike.

‘Transparency and oversight’
Senate Agriculture, Nutrition,
and Forestry Committee Chairman
Thomas R. Harkin (D-Iowa) noted in
a June 4 hearing that he introduced
a bill earlier this year which would
require all futures contracts to trade
on regulated exchanges.
“For many years, derivative contracts have traded very efficiently and
openly on regulated exchanges. We
have seen the damage done by moves
to circumvent properly regulated
derivatives trading,” Harkin said.
On June 12, the US Commodity
Futures Trading Commission used
authority it received from Congress
in 2008 for the first time to examine
whether a contract traded on the
Intercontinental Exchange performs
a significant price discovery function
and should be regulated.
Felmy remained skeptical that
speculation was driving the current
gasoline price rise. More normal
summertime demand certainly is
playing a role, he conceded. “But I
think the increase in crude prices has
played a bigger part,” he said. ✦

Facility Anti-Terrorism Act, would have
disrupted new federal security standards in the short term and weakened
infrastructure protection and economic
stability in the long run.
“Our top concern is that legislation
could go beyond security protections by
creating a mandate to substitute products and processes with a governmentselected technology,” the letter said.
“Congressional testimony found that
this could actually increase risk to the
businesses that the bill is supposed to
protect. Such a standard is not measurable and would likely lead to confusion,
loss of viable products, prohibitive legal
liability, and business failures.”
It also asked that federal lawmakers ensure that any security legislation
avoid overlapping or conflicting with
existing federal security requirements
such as the US Coast Guard’s Marine
Transportation Security Act. “Any proposal must also protect from release any
sensitive security information on site
vulnerability,” the letter said. ✦

The American Petroleum Institute
and 15 labor unions have formed a

“The genesis of our committee

became apparent we have many mutual
interests,” API Pres. Jack N. Gerard told

come together,” he said.
Mark H. Ayers, president of the
Building and Construction Trades
Department at the AFL-CIO, said, “We
intend to work in close cooperation
with API to assure that the oil and gas
industry remains a good source of
income for our members. That will
require us to remind lawmakers that
competitively priced supplies of oil
and gas should remain a part of the US
energy portfolio.”
Doug J. McCarron, president of the
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and
Joiners of America, said the committee will provide a great opportunity
for craft unions to work with the oil
and gas industry to create and maintain
well-paying jobs. “I think the biggest
opportunity for the building trades industry is in creating training programs
to make sure there are qualified people
to take these jobs,” he said.
API Chairman J. Larry Nichols, who
also is Devon Energy Corp.’s chairman
and chief executive officer, said he
expects the Oil and Natural Gas LaborManagement Committee to be at the
forefront of shaping policies to assure
oil and gas stay affordable. “If this
country doesn’t try to continue developing its own oil and gas resources,
supplies from outside will cost more
and reduce our economic recovery as it
begins to occur,” Nichols warned.
One impetus for the committee’s
formation was proposals that have
emerged in Congress and the Obama
administration, according to API’s Gerard. “It’s very clear that some of them
are not in the best interest of the oil
and gas industry and its employees. Our
role will be to go up there arm-in-arm
and educate people that there are great
opportunities here for job creation.
Many people don’t realize that oil and
gas industry jobs pay 2-3 times what
other jobs pay, and that creating more
of them can help our economy recovery
more quickly,” Gerard said.
“When you look at the vast US oil
and gas resources, we could create
another 160,000 jobs by 2030,” Gerard
continued, adding, “We also shouldn’t

T E R E S T
overlook the $1.7 trillion of revenues
that would come from doing this.”
AFL-CIO’s Ayers said, “We’ll take a
multifaceted approach. One is public
policy, but there are several other areas
in which we plan to engage to create
good-paying jobs. That will help perpet-

uate the oil and gas industry and open
great opportunities for employment. We
have an aging workforce that needs to
be replaced. The need’s there. The opportunity’s there. The jobs are there. We
just need to reinvest in America.” ✦

TransCanada, ExxonMobil join forces
on Alaska natural gas pipeline
Christopher E. Smith
Pipeline Editor
TransCanada Corp. and ExxonMobil
Corp. reached agreement June 11 to
work together on TransCanada’s Alaska
Pipeline Project natural gas pipeline.
Tony Palmer, TransCanada vicepresident of Alaska development, said
the two companies will now jointly
advance all aspects of the projects:
technical, financial, and regulatory. The
companies also will share costs, with
TransCanada maintaining a majority
interest in the project. Neither Palmer
nor Marty Massey, ExxonMobil Production Co. US joint interest manager,
would divulge specific percentages of
ownership. The two addressed media
in a conference call following the announcement.
Palmer noted that the state of Alaska
had reviewed the arrangement and
determined that no action was required
under the terms of the Alaska Gasline
Inducement Act (AGIA). Both emphasized that TransCanada’s obligations
under AGIA remained entirely with
the company, with Massey stating that
ExxonMobil was in full support of AGIA
and that it would help TransCanada
meet its obligations under the act.
Massey later said ExxonMobil had
not asked the state for any fiscal discussions as part of joining the project
and that the company recognized

AGIA as the proper forum in which to
address fiscal terms.
TransCanada Alaska Co. LLC and
Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. submitted an
application in November 2007 under
AGIA to build a 1,700-mile, 48-in.
OD natural gas pipeline with 4.5
bcfd capacity to Alberta from a new
natural gas treatment plant on Alaska’s
North Slope (ANS). TransCanada was
awarded the AGIA license in December
2008 and has since been conducting
engineering, environmental reviews,
aboriginal engagement, and commercial planning toward a July 2010 initial
binding open season. The open season
will provide separate terms for ANS
producers to wishing to ship their gas
intrastate, as LNG, or via the pipeline
to Alberta and beyond.
TransCanada and ExxonMobil will
increase preopen season spending on
the project to $150 million from a
previously budgeted $83 million. The
companies anticipate a late-2018 startup.

Another line
BP PLC and ConocoPhillips (as Alaska
Gas Pipeline LLC) have been pursuing
their own 4-bcfd Alaskan gas pipeline project, Denali, which also has an
open season slated for 2010 (OGJ, Feb.
9, 2009, p. 54). Following the open
season, the companies plan to file for
certification from the US Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and Canada’s
National Energy Board for authorization
to move forward with the project.

TransCanada already has NEB authorization for its project.
ConocoPhillips submitted a proposal
under AGIA which the state said failed
to meet the act’s criteria. BP and ExxonMobil did not submit AGIA applications.
Massey remarked repeatedly that
ExxonMobil joined the TransCanada
project because it provides “the best opportunity to bring all interested parties
together,” including BP and ConocoPhillips. He also said it has always been
ExxonMobil’s position that it would
take all four companies and the state
working together to get a pipeline built.
When asked if the agreement between ExxonMobil and TransCanada left
room for other companies to subsequently join the project, Palmer said
TransCanada would still give equity

T E R E S T
status to producers willing to commit
a threshold amount of natural gas for
shipment. Palmer also emphasized that
access to the pipeline would be provided to all potential customers, not just
the majors.

DOI reaction
US Secretary of the Interior Ken
Salazar described the agreement as “a
significant step forward on a project
very important to the president and the
Department of the Interior as a way to
get American energy to the Lower 48.
We recognize there are two very strong
project proposals, both aiming toward
a 2010 open season and both now
supported by major gas producers that
control vast proven reserves of North
Slope gas. We look forward to working

with all stakeholders involved with this
project.”
Alaska Gas Pipeline awarded a frontend engineering and design contract to
Fluor WorleyParsons Arctic Solutions in
February for a 5-bcfd gas treatment plant
to process gas delivered through Denali.
The plant would be the world’s largest,
with process modules weighing up to
9,000 tons (OGJ Online, Feb. 11, 2009).
TransCanada’s pipeline would also
include a gas treatment plant. Ownership of the pipeline, gas plant, and all
other facilities would be fully integrated
between the two companies, Palmer
said, while conceding that ExxonMobil’s expertise in gas treatment would
likely see it take the technical lead in
that area while TransCanada focused on
the pipeline. ✦

at the Boleshak onshore production facility.
Large deepwater subsalt discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico
Lower Tertiary Trend have the potential to return gulf oil production to the 4 million b/d peak formerly attained solely
from shelf fields, said James Cearley of Chevron Corp.
Among the operating challenges are multistage salt canopies below which explorers can encounter the Wilcox three
times and loop currents that can deflect risers so far that
rotating drill pipe can burn a hole in them, Cearley noted.
Cumulative production of 500,000 bbl/well equates to
a recovery factor of less than 2% in North Dakota’s Bakken
formation, said Mark Williams, Whiting Petroleum Corp.,
Denver.
Many wells average 10,000 ft of true vertical depth and a
10,000-ft lateral with 10 sliding sleeves for frac stages, and
Whiting has drilled two laterals that extend across 2 sq miles
each. These 1,280-acre units have room for a second and
possibly a third 2-mile lateral, Williams said.
He said the Bakken play has more than 700 horizontal
wells, most of them drilled since 2004 and heavily weighted
to 2007-09, and that wells for which operators have reported initial production of 1,000 boe/d or more have almost
exclusively been in the Parshall/Sanish field area. ✦

Aussie energy minister proposes
retention lease system reforms
Australian Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson
released a discussion paper on his proposals to reform the
country’s retention lease system.
One of the proposals includes strengthening the “use-itor-lose-it” provisions, where the government will no longer
tolerate companies “stranding” Australian discoveries by
branding them subcommercial while they turn their resources and attention to developing fields overseas.
Ferguson says he and his department are determined to
rigorously apply the commerciality test to ensure gas fields
in particular are developed at the earliest possible time.
“Australia’s political stability can mean our resources are
put to the back of the queue in terms of development planning,” Ferguson said. “Companies chose to get in and out
of nations with greater sovereign risk, knowing that their
Australian titles can be warehoused and kept for a rainy
day. However, our economic strength and political stability should not be allowed to continue to work to Australia’s
detriment,” he said.
The retention lease program was first introduced in
1985. There are now 40% of Australian titles held as retention leases. This amounts to 46 5-year retention leases, 32 of
them off the coast of Western Australia. ✦

Collection procedures
Sample collection procedures
were developed by Quest geologists with the assistance of Well
Refined Drilling and L&S Well
Services personnel.1
With air rotary drilling rates
varying from 100 to 250 ft/hr
and high pressure cuttings returns, various different collection
techniques were attempted.
The cuttings from a coal will
normally return to the surface
in less than 2 min after being
drilled, and the cuttings from a
2-ft thick coal will exit the blooie
line in less than 30 sec. Thus, it
is absolutely necessary for the
wellsite geologist to: 1) know the
stratigraphy during drilling, 2)

know when to expect to intersect each
coal or carbonaceous shale, 3) continuously monitor the cuttings stream, 4)
be prepared to collect a sample at a
moment’s notice, and 5) collect a high
percentage of the exiting cuttings in
order to obtain sufficient sample for a
desorption canister.
The following sampling procedures
were found to be the most effective. The
wellsite geologist continuously monitors the cuttings stream at the end of
the blooie line by using sieves that are
either hand-held or attached to a piece
of PVC pipe. A large bucket of fresh water to wash the cuttings is placed next
to the end of the blooie line.
By continuously monitoring the
cuttings stream and with stratigraphic
data from nearby wells, the geologist
is able to anticipate the next zone to
be sampled. The driller assists with this
process by conveying to the geologist
when the drilling rate changhes.
When coal or carbonaceous shale
cuttings are first observed, or are
anticipated, the geologist (or a drill
helper at the geologist’s direction)
takes an expanded metal trash can and
places it over the end of the blooie line
at an angle. This takes a fair degree of
strength, and safety clothing (including
a heavy long-sleeve shirt, boots, leather
gloves, safety glasses with side shields,
and hard hat) is required.
Three or more trash cans need to be
available, in cases where the zone to be
collected is over 2 ft in thickness. It is
often necessary to rotate the trash can
during collection, since the cuttings
stream will quickly abrade holes in the
side of the expanded metal trash can.

Production correlation
A comparison was made between the
coal gas content and well production.
Of the 272 canistered wells in eastern
Kansas, two or more coals were collected in 223 of these wells (for various
reasons, not all coals that were present
were canistered in every well; or in certain outlier areas, most coals were very
thin or absent).

Production data
Production data for these 223 wells
(with gas content data from two or
more coals) was researched at the
Kansas Geological Survey web site. The
website lists the monthly production
data on each producing gas well in
eastern Kansas (most wells in eastern
Kansas are multizone completions, and
the gas from all zones in a well are
commingled).

P L O R A T I O N

Of the 223 wells with gas content
data on 2 or more coals, only 96 wells
had sufficient production data to be included in this comparison. Most of the
remaining wells had no production data
or had been producing for only a short
time. The wells with no production data
were mostly shut-in gas wells awaiting
a pipeline, and in a few cases the wells
had been plugged and abandoned.
The average daily production rate
was determined from each of the
96 wells. This was calculated for a
12-month period starting with the
month of peak production, which occurs after a period of dewatering.
Nearly all coalbed methane wells in
eastern Kansas require dewatering to
be productive. This is especially true in
new areas with little or no production.
In areas that have been developed
and there are only infill drilling locations, this dewatering period is significantly shorter. On two thirds of the
wells, peak production occurred within
7 months after the start of pumping,
and peak production on the remaining
one third of the wells took 8 months or
longer.

Coal gas content
A weighted average gas content was
calculated for the two (when only two
were available) or three coals with the
highest gas content for the above 96
wells.
Sixty-two wells had gas content data
for three or more coals. The remaining 34 wells had gas content data for
two coals. The average coal gas contents
were divided into one of seven categories (Table 6). Wells, based on their
average coal gas content, were sorted
into their appropriate category.

Production vs. content
The daily production for all of the
wells in each gas content category
was averaged (Table 6). Two important
conclusions can be made from Table 6.
They are:
• There is, in most wells, a general
correlation between coal gas content
and well production. On average, gas
40

L O P M E N T

production increases as coal gas content
increases.
• There is a correlation between the
coal gas content and the average daily
production rate for the poorest producing well in each category. Generally, the
average daily production rate for the
poorest producing well in each category
increases with higher gas contents.
From 2001 to 2005, Quest Resource
as part of its exploration program,
would lease small outlier tracts. These
tracts would be 10-30 miles from established coalbed methane production in
eastern Kansas.
Quest would drill one or two air
rotary wells, canistering cuttings from
all of the carbonaceous shale and coal
zones encountered. When the results of
these desorption samples indicated that
the gas contents were generally poor,
Quest, with minimal effort and expense, was able to redirect its exploration efforts to more productive areas.

and establish best practices for various types of facilities.
The upstream oil and gas industry
historically has focused primarily on
equipment availability as a primary
design input, which differs significantly from typical designs or operating
strategies found in sectors operated on
smaller margins, such as refining and
chemicals.
The analysis method discussed can
benefit preappraise, appraise, and select
project stages of a typical offshore development. The primary technique covered involves profiling various options
with life-cycle analysis to determine
potential energy efficiency and carbon
footprint improvement.
This article discusses how these
input factors affect decision making
early in project planning and execution.
A hypothetical analysis of a West Africa
floating production, storage, offloading

Availability to efﬁciency
As defined in this analysis, availability is a measure of the time a piece of
equipment or system works compared
to the required time.1 The requirement
for a high overall availability often results in installation of spare equipment,
even though the peak rate period may
be short compared with the life of the
facility.

Life-cycle energy efﬁciency model
inﬂuences upstream project design
In this article, efficiency, termed
intensity when expressed as a percentage, is the amount of energy expended
compared with the energy produced by
the facility. Projects have not included
efficiency as a primary design metric
for several reasons, despite the potential
for savings and environmental benefits.
Reasons include for not including efficiency include:
• Lack of a valuation method for fuel
gas in developments without access to
gas markets.
• Difficulty in prediction modeling for the life of the field to quantify
benefits.
• Variability in emissions tax regimes
and incentives for energy efficiency.

are the most energy intensive industries
in the world in terms of annual heat

collectively consume nearly 20% of the
fuel value of produced fluids in compression and pumping, heating, and
other processes.
Sectors in the industry use this energy differently (Fig. 2).2 3 Upstream on

during the initial decision-making
phases of the project. Late changes to
the project involve rework and therefore
may not achieve the expected savings,
and late project work typically focuses
on capex savings rather than efficiency
and uptime.
Additionally, the method requires a
framework to ensure commonality of
reporting basis to support comparisons.
44

Full ﬁeld life cycle
The process design engineer’s primary concern is the sizing of equipment and systems in accordance with a
composite base case.
The most conservative and simplest
approach combines the peak rate of
each fluid, though this rarely results in
a practical design. More commonly, the
engineers will prepare several representative cases from reservoir model

production data that include parameters
such as high arrival temperature, low
arrival temperature, maximum oil flow,
maximum gas flow, maximum total liquids, and maximum compressor horsepower at end of life arrival pressure.
While not necessarily a discrete
model, the combination of these sizing cases results in a composite overall
design base case.
Prediction of what these design cases
should be, given time and personnel
constraints during this early phase of
the project, is difficult. The engineer,
therefore, will often select the same
definitions as used previously.
Alternatively, a base case for all
expected contingencies developed
through a year-on-year modeling approach can determine utility use, emissions load, and energy efficiency at the
particular combination of production
rates provided by the reservoir model.
Fig. 3 shows an example of selecting various system capacities to match
this composite requirement. Note that
values have a common weight value for
comparison purposes only.
In any case, one can evaluate a
system requirement on such factors as
horsepower, allocated area, direct capex
cost, and volumetric throughput from
which one can select an appropriate
model year or base model updated to
change inputs.
For a turbine-driven reinjection gas
compressor, one may consider an approach for finding the point at which a
3 × 50% design (two units in operation, one unit spare, 50% of the time)
becomes more attractive than a 2 ×
100% design.
The 2 × 100% design usually costs
less from a capex perspective, due to
fewer units, less overall weight, smaller
allocated area and simplified piping.
The 3 × 50% design, however, is
more efficient in the sense that installed
capacity is closer to the requirement for
a longer cummulative period. As the
facility moves away from the requirement for compression, the 3 × 50%
design provides better flexibility with
less recycling required.

One needs to quantify the benefits
to determine whether this advantage
outweighs the capex increase.
In addition to providing additional
data during the design phase, another
important application of this approach
is for providing an ongoing operational
target, for energy use or emission, similar to a nameplate processing capacity.
Those involved on a day-to-day basis
can make significant nondesign-related
improvements, such as taking trains
offline when not required, driving antisurge or capacity control valves towards
minimum position, performing fugitive
emission surveys, etc. Real-time data in

an indicator or scorecard format could
support this effort.6

Establishing current costs
In the early days of the oil industry, associated gas was considered a
nuisance and therefore it was vented
or flared. As markets developed for
using this gas as a fuel or feedstock,
the industry started to understand the
reservoir drive mechanisms better. It
then began using the gas for reinjection
as well as for gas sales.
In areas without access to gas markets and below the recoverable threshold for capital-intensive LNG develop-

ments, the industry still considers the
associated gas as free.
Most producing countries prohibit
continuous flaring or will prohibit it in
the near future. One valuation, therefore, could be cost avoidance of associated fines.
Assuming that a gas market becomes
available due to population center shift,
nearby development leading to improved infrastructure, or invention of
more efficient small field technologies
for transporting the gas to market, an
analysis could determine a discounted
net present value of the gas based on
future sale.
Another method involves looking
at the associated cost of using the gas
due to emissions taxes. Norway is an
example of a country with significant
reserves and a mature CO2 tax, currently
at about $60/ton CO2. The EU rate for
2008-12 is $33/ton CO2.
Different fuel gases will provide
varying amounts of carbon per standard
volume, but assuming 133.759 lb CO2/
Mscf 7 at the EU tax rate, this equates to
about $2.21/Mscf. This compares to the
2007 average price for US industrial gas
of $7.59/Mscf.8
For valuing the price of carbon emissions separately from the actual cost of
the fuel gas itself, the EU rate seems reasonable. Note that Norway’s Ministry of
Finance is pushing to join the current
EU trading system.9
Discounting for present value in
countries without any expected requirements in the near future could also be
developed.
Alternately, one can use methods
provided by several consultancies with a
focus towards carbon pricing strategies,
such as www.pointcarbon.com.

Model evaluation
A West African FPSO project illustrates the model. This is a common
offshore development type and provides
some advantages when preparing an
illustrative case, as typically storage requirements determine deck area and the
deck area is relatively constant regardless of the process configuration.

The model builds the composite base
case and all alternative variants directly
from the fluid data. Proper determination of the composite case requirements
includes preparing a production depletion curve complete with major power
users, such as water injection and gas
injection requirements.
Notwithstanding potential sensitivity
studies based on variation in production rates, Fig. 4 depicts a representative
depletion curve tool.
Note that this layout has a quarterly
input, which provides sufficient granularity to phase in additional development wells during the early life of the
field and for infill wells later on.

Base case preparation
After preparing the model with the
fluid data, the engineer must review
the peak requirements of the various
systems. This involves quantitatively
looking at the loads predicted by the
software during the field life (Fig. 3).
The base case model sets the benchmark for comparing other alternatives.
This requires that the model generate a
set of values for each case.
Once the model updates the base
case against the asynchronous peaks
determined by the software (Fig. 3), it
can produce curves of annual energy
production and use against the depletion curve (Fig. 5).
Evaluation metrics of potential interest are the minimum energy intensity
(Fig. 6) and CO2/boe (Fig. 7). These
provide a measure of the maximum
efficiency of the particular design arrangement for a given depletion profile
with respect to energy used and CO2
emissions. One can use these results to
compare against the capex difference
for the various arrangements.

From the emissions perspective,
plotting against production provides
another way to visualize the drop in
efficiency as the facility moves away
from the peak throughput point (Fig.
8). The gap between the plots after year
6 provides a measure of the marginal
drop in efficiency.

Alternatives studied
The following alternative cases all
consider the same depletion profile for
illustrative purposes. The peak requirements for the power generation and
reinjection gas compression systems are
selected based on maximum horsepower. The software model automatically selected the other system peaks on
maximum weight basis.
• Base—FPSO base case.
• Small—Change 2 × 50%
LM2500+ driven reinjection gas compressors to 2 × 50% LM2500 driven
reinjection gas compressors (available
horsepower reduction, requirement
is now 94.5% of site rated available
horsepower).
• Spared—Change 2 × 50%
LM2500+ driven reinjection gas compressors to 3 × 50% LM2500+ driven
reinjection gas compressors (improve
availability).
• Flexi—Change 2 × 50% LM2500+
driven reinjection gas compressors to 3
× 33% Titan 130 driven reinjection gas

compressors (improve availability and
late life flexibility).
• Elec—Change 2 × 50% LM2500+
driven reinjection gas compressors to
2 × 50% variable speed drive (VSD)
electric motor driven reinjection gas
compressors (power generation forced
from 3 × 50% with total load of 18.9
Mw attached to 4 × 33% with total
load of 60.8 Mw attached).
• Import—Change 2 × 50%
LM2500+ driven reinjection gas compressors to 2 × 50% VSD electric motor
driven reinjection gas compressors and
have power generation requirement of
61.5 Mw replaced with import power
from shore. Remaining fuel gas users
are inert gas generation and low-pressure compression.

Model comparisons
The Elec model shows the best efficiency and emissions performance of
the cases studied. A simple net present
value calculation for the difference between the Base and Elec cases includes a
combination of the fuel used and emissions as modeled, and uses a value of
$3.795/MMbtu for fuel (based on 50%
of pricing above and 1,000 btu/scf)
and $33/ton CO2 for emissions, and
annual inflation of 2.5% for all pricing.
This comparison indicates an NPV of

sions avoidance), which can be evaluated against the expected capex increase
from the Base model. When combined
with expected improvements in uptime,
for the modeled case an all-electric
drive approach may have significant
benefits vs. the traditional design with
dedicated gas turbines at each major
power user.
Note that the graphs do not include
the Spared and Import cases. Spared
produces the same efficiency curves as
Base. The improvement in availability
requires generation of a reliability and
maintainability (RAM) study to support
the increased capex.
Import provides a much lower
local emissions and fuel usage, shifting the burden to shore-based power
plant with higher expected efficiency
(even with transmission and conversion losses). One needs to balance this
against the capex impact of powerline
installation, changes in the production
facility design and other factors outside
the scope of this article.

• Ensure depletion model includes
effect of gas cycling in gas lift or gas
reinjection situations and water influx
for water injection cases.
• Complete opex model with

consumables, logistics, modifications

decommissioning costs.

to present different values depending on the development criteria. As an
example,11 an onshore Canadian heavy
oil development combines high direct
energy intensity requirements, a near
Arctic environment, and a relatively
high market price for gas. These factors would combine to make energy
efficiency improvements much more
valuable than a similarly sized facility in
places such as Venezuela.
• Companies can report carbon tax
in $/ton of carbon or $/ton of CO2.
There are 27.3 tons of carbon/100 tons
of CO2.
• If the model can include an agreed
basis on a current dollar value to improve percent uptime, one could select
a more efficient process despite increased capex and otherwise insufficient
opex savings. A RAM study could highlight the uptime differences between
the two designs. ✦

Global gas processing activity in 2008
remained flat, despite
gains in global natural
gas production.
Natural gas producGas Processing
tion last year advanced in
every region, as climbing
natural gas prices spurred global production growth of nearly 7% (OGJ, Mar.
9, 2009, p. 64).
Each major
region of the
world witnessed
growth in gas
production, with
the Middle East
leading the way
with more than 18% (1.8 tcf) growth.
Countries of the Western Hemisphere
produced more than 1.6 tcf (4.8%)
over 2007.
Gas processing capacity, however,
lagged this growth. In the US, capacity moved ahead by nearly 2% but
Canada’s growth was flat (Table 1).

For the entire world, OGJ’s data show
that capacity growth in virtually every
region stagnated.
Natural gas processing capacity
outside the US and Canada continued
to outgrow combined capacities in
the world’s two largest gas processing countries, a trend that emerged in
2005. For 2008, processing capacities
50

of the two North American nations held
at slightly less than 50% of world capacity. That trend was pushed by plants’
capacities in the US advancing by only
1.8%, while Canadian plants’ capacities
remained flat.

Highlights
The marginal advantage in gas
processing capacity for regions outside
the US and Canada continued in 2008,
the fourth year in a row to show this
imbalance.
Production of Canadian NGL barely
ticked upward. Combined with US
production, NGL output from the two
countries’ gas plants resumed a decline
evident in recent years but reversed
somewhat in 2007. Total NGL production for the two North American countries reached 108.3 million gpd, or 37%
of global NGL production. For 2007,
the countries’ combined production was
130.4 million gpd, or more than 44%
of global NGL production. For 2006,
the figure was 38.7% of world totals;
for 2005, slightly more than 33%;
for 2004, more than 34%; and in
2003, more than 40%.
On Jan. 1, 2008, OGJ data show
that US gas processing capacity
stood at more than 72 bcfd, up
from 71 bcfd for 2007; throughput in 2008 only 395 MMcfd
ahead of 2007, averaging slightly
less than 46 bcfd (less than 64%
utilization); and NGL production, more than 75.7 million gpd,
compared with 76 million gpd for
2006 (Table 1; Fig. 1).
Fig. 2 shows pricing differentials in the US between LPG—the
most widely traded NGL on the
world market—and crude oil
for the first trading day of each
month in 2008. With crude oil prices
escalating sharply during the first half
of the year then dropping over the
last half, the chart nonetheless reflects
the historically normal relationship
between LPG and crude oil continued
throughout 2008. (An accompanying
article, beginning on p. 58, discusses
international trade in LPG and ethane.)

In March 2009, Enterprise Products Partners LP announced start-up of the expansion at its Meeker II gas processing plant in Colorado’s Piceance basin.The
expansion doubled capacity to 1.5 bcfd with the capability to extract as much as 70,000 b/d of NGL. Enterprise expects gas volumes at the expanded plant to
reach 1.1 bcfd by yearend, when NGL production will reach 60,000 b/d. Photo from Enterprise.

Oil & Gas Journal’s exclusive, plantby-plant, worldwide gas processing
survey and its international survey of
petroleum-derived sulfur recovery provide industry activity figures.
Canadian data are based on information from Alberta’s Energy and Utilities Board that reflect actual figures for
gas that moved through the province’s
plants and are reported monthly to the
EUB. For 2000 for the first time, OGJ
took these data for all of Alberta and
compiled annual figures and thereby
created a new baseline for data comparisons thenceforth.
(Effective Jan. 1, 2008, the province
realigned the EUB into two separate
regulatory bodies: the Energy Resources
Conservation Board to regulate the oil
and gas industry and the Alberta Utili-

ties Commission to regulate the utilities
industry.)
In addition to EUB figures for Alberta
and to operator responses to its annual
survey, OGJ has supplemented its Canadian data with information from the
British Columbia Ministry of Employment & Investment’s Engineering and
Operations Branch and the Saskatchewan Ministry of Energy & Mines.
As 2008 began, gas processing capacity outside Canada and the US stood
at more than 127 bcfd; throughput
outside Canada and the US for 2008
averaged 80.5 bcfd, up from 77.8 bcfd
in 2007 and 80 bcfd in 2006. NGL
production in 2008 outside the US and
Canada averaged 182.4 million gpd
compared with 163 million gpd in
2007 and 170 million gpd in 2006 but
still off of 2005 production of more

than 201 million gpd.
The current state of gas plant construction in the world appears in Table
2, based on OGJ’s worldwide construction surveys. Table 3 ranks the world’s
major natural gas reserves by country
at the start of 2008; Table 4, the world’s
top natural gas producing countries for
2008; and Table 5, the world’s leading
NGL producers.

Activity
Global gas plant construction, especially in the Middle East, is responding
to the increases in natural gas production that occurred last year. Following is
a review of project plans and progress
announced in the last 15-18 months.

nonassociated gas to 12.5 bcfd from
9.3 bcfd.
The Hawiyah NGL recovery plant
started up in second-half 2008. The
associated pipelines were completed
in November 2007 to deliver C2+. The
plant can process nearly 4 bcfd of sales
gas to yield 310,000 b/d of NGL as
feedstock for the country’s expanding
petrochemical industry.
Transport capacity on the existing
East-West NGL pipeline, says the annual
review, is being increased to 555,000
b/d from 425,000 b/d to meet demand on the west coast for ethane and
NGL.
The Khursaniyah gas plant, with processing capacity of 1 bcfd of associated
gas, was to have begun operating the
middle of 2009, but published reports
have put the start-up closer to October.
The plant will be able to produce 560
MMscfd of sales gas and 280,000 b/d
of C2+.
A company spokesman declined to
provide OGJ with an update on the
schedule of this or any other project
summarized here.
The Hawiyah gas plant expansion
to process an additional 800 MMcfd of
non-associated gas is to be completed
mid 2009 and will raise the plant’s
capacity to 2.4 bcfd.
Expansion of the Ju’aymah gas plant
to fractionate additional NGL was to
have come into service in first-half
2009. The project adds 260,000 b/d of
C2+ capacity and 260,000 b/d of C3+
capacity for a total of 815,000 b/d and
715,000 b/d, respectively, of fractionating capacity, according to the report.
Expansion of the Yanbu’ gas plant is
increasing existing NGL fractionation
capacity to 555,000 b/d from 370,000
b/d to meet increasing demand for
ethane as a petrochemical feedstock,
specifically at the Yanbu’ and Rabigh
petrochemical complexes. This project
was to have been on line in mid-2009.
Karan gas field, discovered in 2006
east of Jubail, is Saudi Aramco’s first
nonassociated offshore gas field. Drilling is under way; the company ultimately plans 23 wells on five producing

First trading day

platforms. The program to develop the
field will provide offshore platforms,
pipelines, new gas treating and upgraded facilities at the Khursaniyah gas
plant. Saudi Aramco projects output
from Karan field at about 1.6 bcfd.
Combined with associated gas from
the Manifa project, the net production
increase of gas processing at the Khursaniyah plant will reach 1.8 bcfd, says
the annual review. Offshore gas production is slated for early 2012.
Saudi Aramco’s Master Gas System
can process more than 9 bcfd and
deliver more than 7 bcfd of net sales
gas to industrial customers around the
country. A project to expand the transmission system in the eastern region,
funded in 2007, is set for completion in
2010. This project will expand the MGS
with 215 km of 56-in. pipe paralleling
existing lines in order to serve future
demand in Jubail and Ras az-Zawr. A
total of seven stations will be installed
to protect critical equipment for black
powder corrosion, says the 2008 review.
In January 2009, Saudi Aramco
awarded a contract to the Bonatti Group
to build a plant to recover and treat
residual gasses produced in the Uthmaniyah and Shedgum gas plants and
currently being flared. Work was to
have begun immediately with a target
completion of October 2010.
As part of developing its $9 billion

Manifa offshore oil field project, Saudi
Aramco will also build a 1-bcfd gas
plant. The processing plant will receive
gas from offshore fields Arabiyah and
Hasbah, both near Manifa field.
The Manifa project will be Saudi
Aramco’s largest offshore field when
fully operating and add 900,000 b/d
of capacity to the country’s oil production. As well as heavy crude, Manifa
field will produce 120 MMcfd of
sour gas, 50,000 b/d of condensate,
and 950,000 b/d of produced water.
Production from the field targets mid2011.
In addition, the nearby Khursaniyah
gas plant is being upgraded to handle
additional gas from the project.
In April in Iran, the managing director of Oil Industries Engineering and
Construction Company said the Siri
NGL project will come on stream by the
end of March 2010.
The Siri NGL project includes Siri-toQeshm pipeline, Siri-to-Kish pipeline,
Siri NGL plant, and Kish booster station,
all estimated to cost $450 million.
The NGL plant is to produce 841
tonnes/day of propane, 328 tonnes/
day of butane, 361 b/d of pentane,
and 1,250 b/d of gas condensates. Siri
Island sits in the southern waters of Iran
off Hormozgan Province.

Fort Nelson, BC.
Phase 1, 400-MMcfd, is due on
stream in third-quarter 2011. The plant
will be expanded as the Horn River
basin gas-shale production grows.
In Mexico, Pemex plans a
250-MMcfd gas processing plant at
the Poza Rica gas complex in Veracruz
state in northern Mexico to handle new
supplies from the Chicontepec basin
that is currently under development, the
company said earlier this year.

the early stages of developing Chicontepec, Pemex plans to produce about 1
bcfd in the area by 2016 and propane,
butane, and natural gasoline at the new
plant.
Contract awards and construction
were due to start by mid-2009 with 2
years anticipated for construction.
In the US in April, Range Resources
Corp., Fort Worth, updated its Marcellus shale activity in the Pennsylvania
Appalachia, announcing completion
and commissioning on a 30-MMcfd
cryogenic gas processing plant in
Washington County, south of Pittsburgh.
The plant is part of the second phase
of infrastructure work based on a 2008
agreement with MarkWest Energy Partners LP that set plans for development
of gas processing and pipelines in the
area. The companies completed the first
phase of those plans in October 2008.
That initial phase included a
30-MMcfd refrigeration gas plant, three
compressor stations, and about 25 miles
of pipelines. The second phase adds
three compressor stations and 20 miles
of gathering and pipelines. The new
cryogenic plant will bring Range’s total
processing capacity in southwestern
Pennsylvania to 60 MMcfd.
When the second plant starts up
later this summer, Range plans to divert
natural gas flowing to the first-phase
plant to the second cryogenic plant.
The company said it wants to fill the
cryogenic plant “as soon as practical”
because it can extract a larger portion
of natural gas liquids from the high-btu
Marcellus gas.
Once the cryogenic plant is fully
loaded, Range said, it will begin flowing gas from previously drilled Marcellus wells into the expanded pipeline
system. As Range adds more production, it will be processed through the
first-phase refrigeration plant. Range
said it will be tying in new wells and
expects the refrigeration and cryogenic
plants to reach full capacity in thirdquarter 2009.
The company said earlier this year it
had 15 Marcellus wells in various stages

Enterprise also completed expansion
of its Gulf Coast NGL pipeline system
earlier in 2009. This expansion follows
the company’s service at Meeker II and
expansion of three natural gas processing facilities in the Piceance basin of
Colorado.
Enterprise said it completed installing two 8-in. pipelines to increase NGL
throughput capacity from the partnership’s Norco fractionation plant west of
New Orleans to refineries and petrochemical plants in southern Louisiana.
The Norco fractionation plant can
separate up to 75,000 b/d of NGL
and is owned 100% by an affiliate of
Enterprise. The plant receives mixed
NGL via pipeline from refineries and
gas processing and fractionation plants
in Texas, southern Louisiana, and along
the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and Alabama.
The company said one of the pipelines is dedicated to a Garyville, La.,
refinery and will transport natural gasoline under long-term agreement. The
second pipeline will allow Enterprise
to increase delivery of NGL to refineries and petrochemical plants in the St
Charles Parish area.
In Alaska earlier this year, Denali—
The Alaska Gas Pipeline LLC announced
it would build what it called the world’s
largest gas-treatment plant.
The plant, to be located on the North
Slope, is part of Denali’s overall project.
It will remove carbon dioxide, water,
hydrogen sulfide, and other impurities
from the gas before it is shipped in the
pipeline.
It will also provide initial gas chilling
and compression. The GTP will be the
largest plant of its type in the world, according to the announcement, and will
have process modules weighing up to
9,000 tons. Denali is also planning for
the construction of a pipeline to deliver
4 bcfd of gas from the North Slope
of Alaska to markets in the Lower 48,
Alaska, and Canada. ✦

strong demand for crude oil and a rush
of LNG liquefaction projects, which is
only partially offset by solid but limited
growth in premium LPG markets. Indeed, the global LPG supply in excess of
base demand has built every year since
2002, resulting in a compound growth
in the “base surplus” of nearly 20%/
year 2002-08.
As might be expected, by-product,
surplus LPG requires an incentive to be
consumed, so that LPG prices have been
growing weaker compared with crude
oil during the past few years, even as
absolute prices for LPG and crude oil
have fluctuated.
LPG trade has also been
affected by the increase
in LPG production and
the global recession. Recent shifts in petrochemical demand patterns have
prompted shippers, hoping
to benefit from an expected
increase in LPG trade, to
commission new LPG ships.
This has caused freight rates
to plunge.

Global supply
Global supplies of LPG rose to nearly
239 million tonnes in 2008 from 198
million tonnes in 2000. Thus, supplies
increased by about 2.4%/year. Purvin &
Gertz expects supplies will reach about
270 million tonnes by 2012 (Fig. 1).
Natural gas processing continues to
be the largest source of LPG supply, accounting for nearly 60% of total worldwide production. Refineries accounted
for nearly all the remaining production.
Other sources account for less than
0.5% of worldwide LPG production.

that about 45%

On a percentage basis, production
increases have been particularly high
in CIS countries (Commonwealth of
Independent States), where supply
nearly doubled to about 13.8 million
tonnes in 2008 from 6.9 million tonnes
in 2000. Other regions where production grew quickly in the same period
include the Middle East, the Indian
subcontinent, and northeast Asia, each
of which saw average growth exceed
4%/year so far this decade.
Since 2000, total global LPG production has increased by more than 41 million tonnes. On an absolute production
basis, the largest supply increase came
from the Middle East, which increased
to about 47.4 million tonnes in 2008
from a relatively large base of 34.3 million tonnes in 2000, an increase of 13.1
million tonnes.
Thus, the Middle East accounted for
nearly a third of the global increase in
LPG production so far this decade. Other regions with large absolute increases
included the CIS with an increase of
about 6.9 million tonnes, and northeast
Asia at 10.1 million tonnes. These three
regions accounted for almost threequarters of the world’s net increase in
LPG supply 2000-08.

Middle East
The Middle East was responsible for
one-fifth of world LPG supply in 2008
and has averaged 4.1%/year growth in
LPG supply since 2000 despite consecutive production decreases in the region
in 2001 and 2002. In 2008, about 66%
of Middle East LPG production resulted
from the processing of associated gas,
with 24% from nonassociated gas
(including LNG) and the other 10% as
refinery by-product.
Increased crude oil production
in the Middle East in this decade has
increased production of associated gas
and consequently in LPG production related to associated gas. Countries of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, however, have cut crude oil
production, which should reduce LPG
produced from associated gas in 2009.
We do not expect LPG from associated
gas to recover to 2008 levels for several
years.
Nonassociated gas is pushing increased LPG production in the Middle
East; LPG production from nonassociated gas has more than doubled since
2000. In 2000, nonassociated gas was
responsible for about 15% of Middle
East LPG supply, but that share increased
to 24% by 2008 and should ramp up to
more than 40% by 2012. The increase
in LPG from nonassociated gas is driven
by LNG and other dedicated regional

gas projects but also includes contributions from gas-to-liquids projects.
Saudi Arabia remains the largest LPG
producer in the region with about 43%
of the Middle East’s 2008 production of
more than 47 million tonnes. The Saudi
share of Middle East LPG production is
decreasing, as the great majority of the
country’s LPG production is currently
from associated gas and refineries. The
UAE was the second largest Middle East
LPG producer in 2008, with output of
7.2 million tonnes and a share of more
than 15%.
Iran is a close third with 2008 production of 7.0 million tonnes of LPG—
more than double its production in
2000. LPG production has been surging
in Qatar due to numerous gas projects,
and we expect the country will become
the second largest LPG producer in the
Middle East by 2012.
By 2012, LPG production in the
Middle East will likely reach more than
65 million tonnes, and nonassociated
gas should account for about 85% of
the increase. More than 95% of the
Middle East increase will be from Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, and Iran.

decrease in 2003 due to the war, but

Thailand has had the largest increase
in LPG production so far this decade in
either region. LPG production in Thailand increased to 4.3 million tonnes in
2008 from 3.0 million tonnes in 2000,
with a boost from a large gas processing plant added in 2004. Another such
plant is to be added in the forecast
period. Almost two thirds of Thailand’s
LPG is from gas processing.
Australian LPG production increased
to 3.8 million tonnes in 2008 from
3.2 million tonnes in 2000. The largest
jump in output occurred 2003-06 and
was due largely to LPG from the Bayu

fourth LNG train on the Karratha gas
plant on the North West Shelf. A fifth
LNG train was added in 2008, which
should help boost LPG production in
Oceania to about 4.5 million tonnes/

About 18.3 million tonnes of LPG
was produced in northern Europe in
2008. Nearly half of that LPG output
was in the North Sea, and most of the
rest came from refineries. Germany was

of LPG, with about 3.0 million tonnes
of LPG generated in 2008. North Sea
LPG production appears to have peaked
around 2006 at 9.3 million tonnes and
should decline to about 7.7 million
tonnes by 2012. Purvin & Gertz expects
that LPG from northern Europe refineries should decline by an average of
0.6%/year through 2012.
Southern Europe generated about 9.6
million tonnes of LPG in 2008, almost
all from refineries. The largest producing countries in 2008 were France at
2.7 million tonnes and Italy at 2.3 million tonnes. LPG output from southern
Europe is likely to be flat through 2012.
The CIS has experienced a strong
increase in LPG supply so far in this
decade. In 2008, the CIS produced
13.8 million tonnes of LPG, a 9%/year
increase since 2000. Purvin & Gertz
expects growth to slow in the CIS in the
forecast period.

estimates that the market will grow
to about 270 million tonnes by 2012.
Thus, total demand will likely grow by
about 3.1%/year in the forecast period
(Fig. 2). Although total global demand
growth for LPG since 2000 averaged
2.5%/year, growth rates in individual
geographic regions have varied widely.
In contrast to total demand, base
demand was about 223 million tonnes
in 2008 and will grow to about 251
million tonnes by 2012. Base demand
should increase by 3.0%/year in the
forecast period, which is slightly lower
than the growth for total demand.
Price-sensitive demand growth should
average nearly 6%/year in the forecast
period.
The highest growth in base demand
has occurred in developing regions of
the world, driven by residential-commercial consumption (Fig. 3). Overall,
base demand grew at 2.1% since 2000.
In the more mature economies of Western Europe, Japan, and North America,
however, LPG base demand has been
relatively flat or slightly down since
2000.

Northeast Asia
In 2008, Northeast Asia had the
world’s second largest base demand
(after North America), but its growth

increased demand to about 19.4 million tonnes in 2008 from 12.3 million
tonnes in 2000.
China’s LPG demand is about 80%
residential-commercial, with the balance consisting of industrial and engine
fuel demand. High LPG prices followed
by a slowing economy have made
China’s LPG consumption stagnate over
the past few years despite the overall
rise since 2000.
Japan is the second largest LPG consumer in northeast Asia and the world’s
largest LPG importer. Japan’s economy is
mature, and base demand has decreased
by 1.2 million tonnes since 2000. Japan
has a large petrochemical industry,
however, with flexibility to use LPG in
place of naphtha, and price-sensitive
demand has increased by 0.9 million
tonnes since 2000. Consequently, total
demand in Japan has decreased by less
than 0.3 million tonnes compared with
2000.
South Korea is the world’s largest
consumer of LPG for automobile fuel
(autogas). Autogas has recently amounted to about half of Korean LPG demand.
In 2008, autogas consumption was
on track to exceed 2007 demand until
fourth quarter 2008, when demand
fell well below that of fourth-quarter

2007. Similarly, industrial demand for
LPG had risen to unprecedented levels
by third-quarter 2008 but fell sharply
in the fourth quarter due to the global
recession.
We expect economic growth in Asia
to resume in the forecast period and
result in rising consumption of LPG, although more slowly than earlier in the
decade. In the forecast period, Purvin &
Gertz expects Chinese demand to be the
main driver of LPG growth in northeast Asia. Purvin & Gertz expects total
demand growth in northeast Asia to
average about 2.2%/year through 2012.

Middle East
The Middle East had the second
largest regional volume increase in
LPG demand 2000-08, after northeast
Asia. More than 70% of the increase of
6.5 million tonnes came from chemical demand, while the balance of the
total increase was nearly all from the
residential-commercial sector. In 2008
chemicals comprised close to half of
total LPG demand in the Middle East,
and by 2012 that figure will rise to
about 63% of total LPG demand as new
projects come on stream.

the relatively low base-demand growth
and the recent plunge in petrochemical
output, total LPG demand in 2008 in
the US and Canada was fairly flat compared with 2000.
Because the US and Canada are
mature markets, Purvin & Gertz expects
that LPG demand growth other than
chemicals should average only about
1.5%/year through 2012. Petrochemical demand for LPG will depend largely
on the recovery of the chemical industry, which is struggling not only from
the recession, but also from a global
overbuild in olefins capacity.
As global LPG supply exceeds global
LPG base demand during the next
several years, it is likely that relatively
inexpensive LPG will be available to
the flexible US petrochemical producers, which should help them compete
against the naphtha crackers in Europe
and Asia.

Latin America
The Latin American market, which
includes Mexico and the Caribbean
down through South America, is the
world’s third largest regional consumer
of LPG. Within the region, about 75%
of the LPG is used in the residentialcommercial sector. Combined demand in Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela
accounts for about two-thirds of the
region’s LPG consumption.
Latin American LPG demand has rebounded to about 28.1 million tonnes
in 2008 from a low of 25.4 million
tones in 2003. Purvin & Gertz expects
that demand will grow to nearly 30
million tonnes by 2012.
For many years, Mexico had the
highest per-capita residential-commercial use of LPG of any country in
the world. Its residential-commercial
consumption of LPG has dropped, however, by more than 1 million tonnes/
year since 2000, while the country’s
population continues to increase. Consequently, at about 63 kg/person, it is
likely that Mexico now has a slightly
lower per-capita, residential-commercial LPG consumption than Russia or
Japan. At 8.9 million tonnes of total LPG

Europe
Base demand in northern Europe has
grown slowly to 13.2 million tonnes
in 2008 from 12.0 million tonnes
in 2000. In contrast, base demand in
southern Europe decreased from 17.2
million tonnes in 2000 to about 14.8
million tonnes in 2008.
In northern Europe, LPG residentialcommercial demand is about threequarters propane, while in southern
Europe propane supplies only about
half of the demand for heating and
cooking. The residential-commercial
market in southern Europe is also about
three times the size of the residentialcommercial market in northern Europe.
Both northern and southern Europe
have countries with large autogas markets. Poland, Turkey, and Italy all rank in
the Top 10 consumers of LPG for engine
fuel in the world. Overall, autogas consumption in northern Europe is similar
to that of southern Europe. The two regions also have similar-sized industrial
LPG markets.
Europe’s olefins production is largely
naphtha-based. In the late fall and
winter, LPG typically does not compete
economically against naphtha because
heating and cooking demand makes
it too expensive for cracking. A major drop in petrochemical operating
rates began in September of 2008, and
naphtha became favored as a feed in the

1990

same month, consistent with the seasonal pattern. Consequently, consumption of LPG in 2008 was affected less by
the petrochemical slump in Europe than
it was in North America.
Both northern and southern Europe
have significant centers of petrochemical production—Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) area in the north
and the Fos-Lavera area near Marseille
in the south. Northern Europe petrochemical plants receive a large portion
of their feedstocks from the North Sea,
while much of the Lavera-area LPG is
from the local refineries and Algeria.
LPG consumption for petrochemicals
is roughly four times greater in northern Europe than in southern Europe.
Price-sensitive LPG demand for ethylene
production has increased dramatically
in both regions since 2000. Purvin
& Gertz expects that base demand in
Western Europe will grow at only about
0.6%/year through 2012. Price-sensitive demand growth, however, should
remain relatively strong, with growth
of about 9%/year during the forecast
period.

CIS
Between 1990 and 1998, demand
in the CIS region steadily declined due
to weak economic conditions. In recent
years, however, positive growth has
returned to these markets. LPG demand

2005

2010

in the CIS has grown at near 8%/year
since 2000.
In 2008, demand in the CIS totaled
about 11.1 million tonnes. Russia accounts for the largest portion of the
regional demand, consuming more
than 80% of the LPG. Within Russia,
the residential-commercial sector uses
slightly less than one-half of the total,
and petrochemical consumption of LPG
accounts for almost 40%. We expect
LPG demand in the CIS to rise to about
12.5 million tonnes by 2012.

Africa
In Africa, about 85% of LPG demand
is concentrated on the northern coast,
and 95% of LPG is consumed by the
residential-commercial market segment.
The balance of demand consists mainly
of autogas consumption in Algeria and
some industrial demand in North Africa. Total LPG demand was about 10.6
million tonnes in 2008, which reflects a
compound growth of about 5.0%/year
since 2000.
At about 4.1 million tonnes, Egypt
had the largest LPG demand in Africa—
more than double the demand from Algeria or Morocco (1.9 and 1.8 million
tonnes in 2008, respectively). Although
Nigeria is the second largest producer
of LPG in Africa, its annual consumption would amount to less than the
supply provided by two very large gas

REGISTER TODAY!

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.
Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more
than tomorrow’s oil supply. They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil
industry.
Problems like managing costs during periods of lower oil prices, dealing with labor shortages,
handling sulfur, controlling air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions, mitigating surface
impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to these challenges, the oil sands and heavy oil industry continues to
develop unconventional resources that are critical to meeting the world’s long-term needs for
reliable hydrocarbon supplies.
Continued progress in oil sands and heavy oil producing technologies means progress in ensuring
a dependable supply of petroleum products at a time when traditional recovery methods are
strained by additional demand from rapidly developing industrial nations.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the
people who make this innovation and progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience.

Deepwater pipeline coatings can be mixed on site
The new ETNAFLOW portable mixing
plant blends glass syntactic polyurethane
(GSPU) coating and insulation systems
for deepwater pipelines on site in remote
locations.
The plant allows for safe and efficient
mixing of materials, while an advanced
process control helps ensure formulation
accuracy and the quality and consistency
of the finished product. ETNAFLOW requires fewer human and capital resources
to operate, eliminates storage and disposal
requirements of conventional GSPU mixing systems and, due to its closed-loop
design, helps to minimize potential for
chemical exposure or injury to workers
from moving machinery, the company

Ethanol’s green
goodness clouded
by water strains
For a supposedly clean-burning gasoline
additive, ethanol always has carried a full
load of environmental compromises.
The problem of volatility is a longstanding example. It’s why ethanol promoters
focus on tailpipe emissions of ozone precursors and ignore evaporative emissions.
Generally, ethanol improves the former but
aggravates the latter.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

And it turns out that ethanol from corn—
most of the ethanol burned as fuel in the
US—doesn’t live up to its press notices as
a way to combat global warming. To sweep
this one under the rug, ethanol promoters want everyone to ignore the forests
displaced by fuel-crop agriculture.
New to the list of questions about ethanol’s environmental goodness is water use.
Growing mandates for the fuel additive
through 2022 require energy conservation
and careful planning for land use and crop
choices, warns a new study published by
the Shell Center for Sustainability at Rice
University in Houston.
The water needed to grow feedstock for
a liter of ethanol in the US ranges from 500
l. to 5,000 l., the study says, depending on
crop and location.
For ethanol from irrigated corn grown
in Nebraska, travel in a car that achieves 16
mpg of ethanol represents the use of about
50 gal of water/mile driven (gwpm), the
study calculates.
“This value could decrease to 23 gwpm
for corn grown in Iowa or increase to 90
gwpm if sorghum ethanol is used or to 115
gwpm if the sorghum is grown in Texas,” it
says.
The peak mandate for corn ethanol in
2015 could require 6 billion cu m/year of
water for ethanol, about 3% of the total
used for US irrigation in 2000, the study
estimates.
The ethanol mandate also will hurt
water quality by raising the use of nitrogen
fertilizer and pesticides, it adds.
“Such threats to water availability and
water quality at local to national scales
represent a major obstacle for sustainable
biofuel production and require careful
assessment of crop selection and management options,” the study says.
That kind of planning has been ostentatiously absent in the agricultural gold rush
incited by US subsidies and mandates for
ethanol.

Crude tests $73/bbl
The July contract for benchmark US light sweet crude hit an intraday high of
$73.23/bbl June 11 on the New York Mercantile Exchange before closing at $72.68/
bbl, up $1.35 for the day after the International Energy Agency in Paris increased its
prediction of global oil demand for the ﬁrst time in 10 months.
However, oil closed at $72.04/bbl June 12 after the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries reported its production increased for the second consecutive
month, up 135,000 b/d to 28.27 million b/d in May.
IEA increased its oil demand forecast by 120,000 b/d to 83.3 million b/d. The latest
total is down 2.9% from 2008 demand, compared with IEA’s previous prediction of a
3% decline (OGJ Online, June 11, 2009).
OPEC expects world oil demand growth to be down 1.6 million b/d in 2009,
broadly unchanged from its previous report. It revised its 2009 projected growth for
the world economy up by a mere 0.1%, still down 1.3% from 2008 levels. It expects
non-OPEC production to increase by 200,000 b/d above 2008 production.
The 11 OPEC members excluding Iraq increased their production by 118,800 b/d
to 25.903 million b/d in May. Analysts expect compliance with ofﬁcial production
quotas will continue to erode as crude prices rise.
The average price for OPEC’s basket of 12 reference crudes surged almost 14% in
May to $56.98/bbl, its highest monthly average in 7 months, driven by the widespread hope for a recovery in petroleum demand. OPEC’s basket price was up 68¢
to $70.87/bbl on June 11. Ofﬁcials at OPEC reported the tanker market rebounded
in May. “The [very large crude carrier] sector continued to suffer the most from
the global economic crisis and OPEC output adjustments. Clean spot freight rates
rose by 37% on average. After reaching a high level, storage at sea lost momentum
towards the end of the month due to the narrowing of the contango structure in the
crude futures market,” ofﬁcials said.
May market increased
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, “Commodity prices rallied in May and the energy indices took note, outperforming the
broader market by over 10%. While we believe both oil and natural gas may be in
for short-term corrections in the coming weeks, the bifurcation between the two
continues to grow. Oil is simply waiting for demand to recover before climbing even
higher. Natural gas is headed towards full storage, and prices will plummet.”
They said, “Oil has ripped for 4 months in a row now, jumping 30% in May (and
already up 6% in June). Oil has more than doubled off its bottom from back in February. While the global economy has started to show ‘green shoots’ of recovery, we
still believe that a dramatic rebound in oil demand isn’t in the cards for 2009, and a
short-term pullback is likely given worldwide storage levels, which are still full.”
Raymond James observed, “The global economic crisis continues to obscure
oil demand, with virtually no near-term visibility. Despite recent stimulus packages
around the world, we assume depression-era year-over-year demand destruction
of 3.5%. In spite of brimming worldwide inventories, oil has spiked to over $70/bbl
over the last few months (over 100% above its February low). However, we believe
global demand will need to stabilize (and possibly recover) before oil prices can be
maintained at this level. We don’t expect to see this until 2010, hence our $52.50/
bbl second-half forecast. Even if oil prices saw a short-term pullback, we believe the
long-term story is intact and accordingly model $65/bbl in 2010. Indeed, if anything,
given the number of marginal supply projects that have been shelved, the long-term
outlook for crude is actually stronger.”
As for natural gas, Raymond James analysts said, “While the fundamentals
continue to deteriorate (year-over-year storage surplus quickly approaching 600 bcf),
natural gas rode a technical rally higher in May, ﬁnishing the month up 14%. We
believe this is solely the result of a lot of new money entering the market and still
believe full storage will drive prices below $3/Mcf toward the end of summer.”
They said, “Despite our assumption of a 70% peak-to-trough decline in the gas
rig count, we believe shut-ins may still total 500-750 bcf. To force such large shutins, natural gas prices would need to fall well below $3/Mcf. Moreover, LNG imports
could be substantially above our estimates, causing an even higher amount of shutins. For 2010, the outlook is still uncertain.”

COVER
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has impacted
the price and availability of oil for more than 40 years. Now that
natural gas can move farther from source to market via lengthy
pipelines and LNG deliveries, there has been talk of a similar
organization forming to control gas.Will an OGEC form? If it did,
how would it impact current and future plans for costly LNG and
pipeline infrastructure? How could gas consumers protect themselves? Many gas-exporting countries are also OPEC members;
how much more power could they wield? And where does Russia fit
in all this, with its vast gas resources and quest for energy power?
These questions and more are answered in the Special Report beginning on p. 22. Cover illustration by Kermit Mulkins.

UK planning policy to speed energy projects
The UK has launched a white paper to revamp the planning system and ensure that large energy projects of national importance
are dealt with quickly, smoothly, and separately from other proposals in the planning program.
Energy companies previously had complained that the planning
system—particularly when dealing with major gas projects—was
burdensome and that local communities abused the process system
by blocking proposals and significantly delaying their timetable.
UK Communities Sec. Ruth Kelly insisted that local communities would have a say in major infrastructure projects at every stage
of the process and stressed that the new regime would be accessible to them for voicing their concerns. Companies will now be
required to have low-carbon emissions under any new community
projects planned.
The new planning system will replace more than eight different
planning regimes and could save over £1 billion within 10 years,
the UK government said. Ministers and parliament will draw up a
new national policy framework to decide how the country’s key infrastructure needs for the next 10-25 years will be met under one
legal framework. This will be subject to public consultation.
The government has proposed introducing a new independent
infrastructure planning commission that would make decisions on
nationally significant energy applications, such as LNG terminals
and power plants. The commission would comprise “experts of
considerable standing and experience drawn from a range of relevant fields,” the government said.
Trade and Industry Sec. Alistair Darling said, “Secure, clean energy supplies are vital. Currently major energy projects, including
wind farms, can take many years going through the planning system which is confusing and unpredictable for both industry and
communities.”
Appeals must now be filed within 8 weeks rather than 6 months
so they can be dealt with quickly, according to the white paper.
National Grid said that major reform of the planning system
was needed and that it would continue to involve local communities in the planning process for its 14 gas and electricity projects
that are expected to come on stream by 2012.
E.On welcomed the white paper and urged the government to
implement it by 2009 to help facilitate constructing new power
stations and renewable schemes. Paul Golby, chief executive of E.On
UK said, “The situation is especially pertinent for next generation
nuclear power stations and for onshore wind farms, where some of
our schemes have been held up in planning for literally years.”
Environmentalists were dismayed that major infrastructure
projects, such as nuclear power stations and airport expansions,
would get the green light under the white paper, arguing that these

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

would harm the environment.
Interested parties have until Aug. 17 to submit comments on
the white paper.

DOE staffer pushes renewable technology transfer
The US Department of Energy’s renewable energy office is working to accelerate technology transfer as part of an overall effort to
improve its outreach to industry, a spokesman said at a recent wind
and biofuels conference.
Paul Dickerson, chief operating officer of DOE’s office of energy
efficiency and renewable energy, said the DOE hired three people
having experience as venture capitalists to help accelerate technology commercialization and deployment.
The three visit DOE laboratories and talk with researchers and
scientists about ways to provide technology to businesses, said
Dickerson. Meanwhile, he schedules weekly meetings between
himself and business leaders to discuss technology transfer.
“I have asked the DOE to think differently and to quicken our
pace,” Dickerson told reporters after he spoke at an energy conference in Houston sponsored by Haynes and Boone LLP on May
19.
“For the first time in our lives, being ‘green’ is not a partisan
issue,” Dickerson said. “It is in our vital interests to diversify the
United States’ energy supply, and the way forward is through technology.”
President George W. Bush promotes the use of ethanol in gasoline as a way to help reduce fossil fuel consumption. He has outlined a goal to produce 35 billion gal of renewable and alternative
fuel by 2017.
Dickerson called that goal realistic. He said much of the leading-edge fuel technology is being financed by private capital rather
than by DOE funding.
Simmons & Co. International analyst Pearce W. Hammond Jr.
believes total production of ethanol and biodiesel together could
reach only 17.5 million gal by 2017. Other fuel options also will
be needed to fulfill Bush’s goal, Hammond told the conference.
Previously the US Energy Information Administration predicted
that the nation’s ethanol use will grow to 14.6 billion gal/year
by 2030, with corn ethanol accounting for 13.6 billion gal of the
total. That projection was made assuming no changes in existing
energy policy.
Under the same scenario, EIA predicted US consumption of
biodiesel will reach 400 million gal/year in 2030. Last year, the US
produced 91 million gal of biodiesel, made primarily from soybean oil.
Pamela Beall, Marathon Oil Corp. vice-president of business development, downstream, noted that Marathon is one of the nation’s
largest blenders of ethanol.

Cellulosic ethanol is years away from commercial operations
and will not replace corn-based ethanol, Beall said. Renewable
fuels will not make energy cheaper, she added.
William Spence, chief executive officer of BioSelect Fuels, Houston, said the biodiesel industry is looking for more feedstock with
which to produce biodiesel.
Scientists are researching how to improve crop yields, possibly
through genetically modified crops, Spence said, and also are seeking to develop technology enabling a move from food crops for

&

Development

PTTEP’s Gulf of Martaban wells show gas
Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production PLC (PTTEP) said another two exploration wells drilled on Block M9 in Myanmar’s Gulf
of Martaban have both tested natural gas. The results followed on
the success made earlier this year (OGJ Online, Apr. 3, 2007).
Zawtika 3, drilled to 2,274 m TD, encountered eight zones of
gas-bearing formation with a total thickness of 65 m, the company
said. A tubing stem test was conducted on a selected zone, indicating gas flows of 26.7 MMcfd.
Zawtika 4 reached a 2,390 m TD and found 11 zones of gasbearing formation with a total thickness of 161 m. A tubing stem
test was conducted on two zones, indicating gas flows of 39.6
MMcfd and 31.5 MMcfd.
PTTEP said it plans to drill three additional appraisal wells—Kakonna 2, Zawtika 5, and Zawtika 6—in July. It will then prepare a
development plan with sights on starting production in 2011 or
2012.

Falcon to develop Mako Trough in Hungary
Timing remains uncertain, but Falcon Oil & Gas Ltd., Denver,
plans to develop a vast basin-centered gas accumulation in southeastern Hungary, where it just announced an oil discovery.
The company, which on May 22 received a long-term oil and
gas production license from the Hungarian Mining Authority, said
it will “put the necessary systems and personnel in place” to develop its holding in the Mako Trough near the borders with Montenegro and Romania.
The production license covers Falcon’s Tisza and Mako exploration licenses totaling 900 sq miles and remains in force as long as
the company continues operations, but it was unclear how soon
sustained gas or oil production might begin (see map, OGJ, Feb.
6, 2006, p. 40).
The company said its Magyarcsanad-1 well near the acreage’s
southern extremity discovered oil and gas in the Miocene Endrod
formation below 13,000 ft.
Falcon plans to frac the entire 1,188 ft of Endrod that is behind
casing after a 23-ft gross interval at 13,310 ft flowed 377 b/d of
sweet, 48° gravity oil and 745 Mcfd of gas at 3,843 psi flowing
tubing pressure without treatment. Estimated bottomhole temperature is 360° F.
Magyarcsanad-1 is 101⁄4 miles south of Falcon’s Mako-6 well,
TD 18,674 ft, which encountered 17,100 psi bottomhole pressure
and 460° F. temperature. Mako-7, northwest of Mako-6, set a Hun8

feedstock to nonfood crops.
BioSelect Fuels will operate a biodiesel production and distribution plant in Galveston, Tex. Chevron Technology Ventures LLC,
another partner in the project, is part of a joint venture consisting
of various investors. The plant is in the process of being commissioned, and it initially will use soy feedstocks.
The facility will have an initial production capacity of 20 million
gal/year. Spence hopes the plant can be expandable to 470 million
gal/year by 2010 through three sites near refining centers. ✦

garian drilling depth record at TD 19,964 ft on Dec. 21, 2006.
Falcon has acquired more than 1,100 sq km of 3D seismic surveys, is drilling its sixth well, and has built a high-capacity gathering pipeline on the acreage. The company has described the Tertiary-age Mako Trough basin-centered gas accumulation, discovered
in the 1960s, as the world’s youngest.
Consulting engineers in 2006 assessed the acreage as having
potential for a contingent resource of 55 tcf of gas, three fourths of
which is attributed to the Pliocene Szolnok formation.

Nicaraguan exploration well noncommercial
Norwood Resources Ltd., Calgary, was moving to test its first
indicated discovery in the Sandino basin of western Nicaragua after
it plugged its second well there as noncommercial.
The company tested eight intervals at the Las Mesas Gutierrez-1
well southwest of Managua. An interval at 3,350-3,460 ft yielded a
noncommercial flow of 45° gravity oil.
Intervals at 8,818-38 ft, 8,708-28 ft, and 7,846-8,034 ft tested
noncommercial gas flows.
Intervals at 2,770-95 ft, 2,954-3,035 ft, 3,908-56 ft, and
4,742-4,810 ft flowed salt water.
“This well indicates the presence of a positive hydrocarbon basin system (source, maturation, migration and timing of migration
including the generation of light oil); and the presence of reservoir rock, as demonstrated by logs, sidewall cores, and water flow
rates,” the company said.
Norwood is moving to test the San Bartolo Rodriquez Cano-1
well, where it set casing in February. Logs from that well, showed
232 ft of conventional pay and 300 ft of naturally fractured low
permeability sands in eight zones below 6,000 ft. Porosities were
17-21% and permeabilities 3 to 30 md (OGJ, Mar. 26, 2007, p.
38).

Petrobras secures semi for work off Brazil

CNOOC Ltd. reported start of oil production from Wei Zhou
(WZ) 11-1 field in the western South China Sea. The field currently
has one well producing more than 2,100 b/d of oil.
WZ11-1 lies southwest of Weizhou Island in 30-40 m of water
and next to WZ11-4 and WZ12-1 producing fields.
The one producing platform in WZ11-1 field is tied back to
the adjacent WZ12-1 field’s production facilities and subsea pipelines.
At peak, WZ11-1 field is expected to produce 7,200 b/d of oil.
CNOOC said marginal fields such as WZ11-1 can be commercialized by sharing facilities with surrounding oil fields. The company has previously developed WZ6-1 field, another marginal field
next to WZ11-1, in the same way.
CNOOC Ltd. holds 100% interests of WZ11-1.

Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has awarded a 5-year, $482
million drilling contract to Pride International Inc. for the Pride
Mexico semisubmersible to drill off Brazil.
The contract is to start during second quarter 2008.
Before then, the rig will undergo a 270-day shipyard program
and then be moved from the Gulf of Mexico. The $120 million
shipyard program includes a previously planned regulatory survey
and maintenance, upgrade of the rig’s water depth capability to
2,300 ft from 1,100 ft, and modifications to the rig’s mooring
system and crew quarters.
The contract value includes a performance bonus option of as
much as 15%, but it excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, and reimbursables. The contract also includes an operating
cost escalation provision.

Essar Global plans $3.4 billion Egypt reﬁnery
India’s Essar Global plans to invest 138 billion rupees ($3.4 billion) to build a proposed 300,000 b/d refinery in northern Egypt.
The project likely will be approved, but it is unknown whether
Egypt would permit Essar Global to proceed alone or insist in retaining some portion of equity in a project. If approved, the refinery could be on stream by 2010.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
Egyptian oil output has declined to 800,000 b/d from peak
levels of nearly 1 million b/d in the mid-1990s, and the country is
actively encouraging international firms to invest in the oil and gas
sector in the country to reverse the declining hydrocarbon output
trend.
Egyptian Oil Minister Sameh Fahmy said the country plans to
develop recent discoveries in the Gulf of Suez and the Western Sahara. And last month, because of its strategic importance, Egypt

postponed a plan to privatize its 100,000 b/d Middle East Oil Refinery (Midor) in Alexandria.
Essar Global’s proposed refinery is part of its plan to have a larger presence in western Asia, where oil-fueled growth and a construction boom have boosted domestic consumption, squeezing
supplies to Europe and Asia.

The diversified group also is conducting talks with Iran to develop the country’s largest oil field, Azadegan, to fuel a planned
refinery and steel plant.
India’s state-owned refiner Indian Oil Corp. also has proposed
participation in a crude pipeline project from the Mediterranean
to the Red Sea coast to allow oil flow to Asia, bypassing the Suez
Canal. ✦

Oil ﬂow resumes through Nigeria’s Bomu manifold
Royal Dutch Shell PLC has resumed pumping crude through
the Bomu pipeline manifold in the eastern Niger Delta in southern
Nigeria. About 170,000 b/d of production was shut in last week
because of community protests.
During the shut-in, Bomu was unable to feed the Bonny export
terminal in southern Nigeria.
“Force majeure, however, for May and June contracts still remains in place for Bonny,” a Shell spokesman told OGJ. Shell was
forced in mid-May to declare force majeure on its contracts after
attacks on its facilities.
Nigeria’s oil exports have fallen by about 25% over the past
year because of continuous attacks on oil infrastructure by militants, which have promised to increase pressure until May 29 when
President-elect Umar Musa Yar’Adua takes over from incumbent
Olusegun Obasanjo.
The militants see this transition as an opportunity to demand a
more equitable distribution of Nigeria’s oil wealth.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

National Grid PLC subsidiary National Grid Grain LNG Ltd.,
which operates the terminal, will invest $612.3 million to boost
capacity, positioning the terminal to import one fifth of forecast
UK gas demand by 2010. This expansion is in response to the UK’s
growing need for gas imports and its dwindling supplies from the
mature UK North Sea.
Under a $500 million lump-sum turnkey contract, Chicago
Bridge & Iron Co. NV will construct a jetty to support LNG vessels
with capacity as large as 265,000 cu m and with an unloading
rate of 12,000 cu m/hr. CB&I also will build another 190,000
cu m full containment LNG storage tank and gas processing infrastructure.
National Grid has secured long-term contracts with E.On, Iberdrola, and Centrica, each of which have taken all the additional
capacity to justify the third expansion.
BP PLC and Algeria’s Sonatrach have a 20-year contract for 3.3
million tpy of LNG at Isle of Grain. Long-term contracts for the
second phase of expansion have been agreed with Gaz de France,
Centrica, and Sonatrach.

Statoil installs Tampen link for fall gas deliveries
Statoil AS has installed the 23-km Tampen gas pipeline link between Statfjord field and the UK section of the North Sea preparatory to the delivery of gas from its Statfjord field to the UK beginning Oct. 1. Statoil will hand over its operatorship of the Tampen
link to Gassco AS when production begins.
The 32-in. Tampen link delivers Statfjord field gas to the Flags
pipeline that extends from Brent field in the UK North Sea to St.
Fergus, Scotland. Statoil installed the pipeline using Saipem’s Castoro Sei laybarge.
The Statfjord partners will convert three Statfjord field platforms
from handling oil with associated gas, to handling gas with associated oil. The work enables Statfjord to continue Statfjord production to 2020, with partners investing just over $2.7 billion.
Statfjord “late-life” additional resources are estimated at 32 billion cu m of gas, 25 million bbl of oil, and 60 million bbl of
condensate. The expected recovery ratio is up to 70% for oil and
75% for gas.

National Grid to expand Isle of Grain LNG terminal
Capacity at the UK’s Isle of Grain regasification terminal
will increase for the third time by another 50% to 14.8 million
tonnes/year by 2010-11. The terminal, which has a current capacity of 3.3 million tpy, is undergoing a second expansion to 9.8
million tpy to start in 2008.

Kinder Morgan signs pipeline release agreement
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP has entered into a consent
agreement with several government agencies to resolve civil claims
relating to the unintentional release of petroleum products during
three pipeline incidents in northern California.
These releases occurred in the Suisun Marsh area in Solano
County in April 2004, in Oakland in February 2005, and near Donner Pass in April 2005.
KMEP has since undertaken a number of operations and pipeline integrity initiatives to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. For instance, the Concord-Sacramento pipeline
that was involved in the Suisun Marsh incident was replaced in late
2004 as part of a major expansion project and was routed outside
the marsh area, KMEP said.
Terms of the agreement state that KMEP will pay $3.7 million
in civil penalties, $1.3 million in natural resource damages and
assessment costs, and $170,000 in agency response and future remediation monitoring costs. In addition, KMEP agreed to perform
enhancements in its Pacific operations relative to its spill prevention, response, and reporting practices, the majority of which have
already been implemented.
KMEP has substantially completed remediation and restoration
activities at the three sites; remaining restoration work at the Suisun Marsh and Donner Pass areas is expected to be completed later
this year. ✦

Taxing creativity
I concur with the position of your
editorial “Fuels and political favors” (OGJ,
May 7, 2007, p. 17).
However, opposition from “protesting
lawmakers” was to have been expected.
It is often a normal reaction to successful
programs. I recall having developed a salesman compensation program which met all
of the vice-president of marketing’s desires
and had his full approval. At yearend, the
program had exceeded all sales goals,
contributing to unprecedented profitability
at the Williams Cos. fertilizer division. But
the executive in charge was extremely displeased: A very few salespersons received
total compensation which exceeded his
own.
Successful incentive programs should
drive creativity to new heights along
unexpected paths. ConocoPhillips’s venture
not only provides a feedstock for biodiesel,
it uses waste materials extracted as part of
the water purification process at animal
processing facilities.
If the current uproar is not overcome,
where will it stop? I can anticipate challenges to the Cargill-Ashland venture
which will produce chemicals with
glycerin waste from agricultural biodiesel
production.Yet many biodiesel ventures
have wondered how to make that waste
disappear through landfill or compost. The
Cargill-Ashland venture should be cheered,
not attacked.Yet the same rationale used
to oppose the ConocoPhillips project may
encourage an effort to recapture biodiesel
financial incentive from chemical users
of glycerin. Where would it stop? Should
the distillers’ grain (one of the effluents of
ethanol manufacture) be taxed? This highprotein byproduct, now far more available
due to the ethanol craze, is being substituted for soybean meal in animal rations.
At this rate, the mantra may soon be:
“If a profit is being made from unexpected
creativity, tax it to oblivion.” It sounds
ominously like the refrain emanating from
Venezuela. Creativity is one of the primary
means for this nation to meet its many
energy and environmental challenges. Let
us not stifle that guiding light every time it
brings success.

OPEC’s changes
Much of what has been written about the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries lately
concerns not the group but the model. As demand
grows worldwide for natural gas, the question
arises: Can a global cartel of gas producers form
with enough control over supply to influence
price? The special report starting on p. 22 examines the issue.
Most other questions about OPEC focus on
immediate conditions in the oil market. How
will political unrest affect production in restive
members such as Nigeria and Venezuela? Will the
group predict demand accurately and make timely
adjustments in production?
Questions such as those are now the routine
because OPEC, contrary to lingering prejudices,
has become a steadying influence in the market.
The group regularly parries the lurches of its maverick members and has settled into its role as the
oil market’s balancing mechanism. While internal
politics can be testy, OPEC as a whole has learned
from its mistakes and improved its ability to
anticipate and adjust production to requirements
for members’ crude. That the group sometimes
misreads market signs hardly makes it unique.
Stability, though, is not stasis. OPEC is changing.

Adding members
Most obviously, membership of the group is
growing. In January, Angola, with its 1.6 million
b/d of production, became a member. Sudan, with
300,000 b/d of production, wants to join. Ecuador, which produces 500,000 b/d, might rejoin
after having left the organization in 1992. New
members increase OPEC’s market share and, therefore, its leverage. They also represent new bundles
of interests that must be accommodated when the
group tries to coordinate production.
Divergence of interest is the bane of any cartel.
The problem seems minor when, as now, the oil
market absorbs most of what OPEC members can
produce. But conditions change. The next time
OPEC needs to apportion production cuts across
the membership, an expanded roll will complicate
the politics. So will another important influence
on the group’s character: the contrast between
members able to increase production capacity and
those with no hope for output gains.

Another often-overlooked but important trend
in OPEC is the steady growth of members’ production of natural gas liquids. In its May Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency says
OPEC output of NGL might rise by 7.8%/year to
reach 7.1 million b/d by 2012. There are several
reasons for the expected increase, most having to
do with burgeoning gas production and antiflaring programs. Most significant about the increase
is that OPEC quotas don’t apply to NGL. In the
context of quota pressures, OPEC NGLs represent,
to OPEC, competitive supply.
In international affairs, OPEC frequently
expresses concern about security of demand,
the reciprocal of the supply-security worries
voiced regularly by industrial consuming countries. For OPEC, security of demand has a vital
financial component. Members able to expand
capacity must make immediate decisions about
the enormous investments required if they’re to
meet projected demand for their crude oil years
and decades from now. They naturally worry
when politicians in the US and other consuming
countries make diminished reliance on foreign
oil a touchstone of energy policy. At present, the
mutuality of interest between buyers and sellers
gets little attention as a source of security. Still, an
opportunity for international cooperation presents
itself here.

Iraq and OPEC
Looming over all matters pertaining to OPEC is
Iraq. Still exempt from group quotas, the beleaguered country struggles to produce 2 million
b/d. Key pipelines and production equipment
remain subject to attack by insurgents. Insecurity precludes oil-field modernization. Work on a
hydrocarbon law has stalled over regional politics.
The government wants to take a 2-month vacation.
But Iraq’s travails, deadly and drawn out as they
have been, can’t last forever. Not everyone has given
up hope for peace and prosperity for Iraqis. With
stabilization, wherever that might lie in the future,
comes a renewal of prospects for the 6 million b/d
of oil output of which the country surely is capable.
When Iraq realizes its production potential,
OPEC will be a different organization than it is
now—and hopefully not much older. ✦

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS
Few of the world’s oil and gas regions are as hard on ﬁeld equipment as the Middle East.
At the same time, the region’s importance in supplying oil and natural gas to the rest of the world has only
increased in recent years and critical in the movement of hydrocarbons from ﬁeld to market are the region’s oil
and gas pipelines, the integrity of which is the focus of ongoing research and development.
The tools and technologies that are the fruits of the research and the accounts of how pipeline operators have
dealt with maintenance issues form the core of this conference.
This event has established itself as the leader in bringing together major operating and service companies
and their technical and management personnel to learn the latest and best in pipeline rehabilitation
and maintenance.

N T E R E S T
The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries has influenced
both the supply and the price of oil
internationally for more than 30 years.
Many commentators, consumers, and
politicians in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) countries consider the rise of
the cartel’s power to be a consequence
of their countries’ becoming dependent on imported energy
supplies to fuel growing
economies.
OECD countries in
East Asia and many in the
European Union decades
ago also had to come to
terms with a dependence
on imported natural gas.
In recent years the US and the UK
have recognized a future that requires
increasing gas imports to fill widening domestic supply gaps caused by
increasing demand, primarily for power
generation, along with the simultaneous decline of domestic reserves and

Could a future gas OPEC
shape LNG import plans?
David Wood

SPECIAL

It is important to explore such an
argument because the prospect is used,
particularly by some in the US, to argue
against building extensive additional
LNG import capacity.
Furthering this apprehension, the
world’s leading gas exporting nations
met this April at the Gas Exporting
Countries Forum (GECF) in Qatar and,
with Russia as driver, agreed to establish a group to evaluate “gas pricing
implications for gas exporters” and
“cooperation to stabilize the market,”
viewed by some as another step towards
the creation of an OGEC.
Although the GECF includes the
more-market-friendly nations of Qatar
and Nigeria, it is the Russian, Iranian,
Venezuelan, and Algerian contingent
that is striving for a cohesive “gas
OPEC” that can command an export
price for gas that reflects its “real” value.
There are several relevant factors that
influence how, when, and if a cartel
of producing gas nations might form
and the control it might leverage over
supply and prices. Considered here are
some of those factors and a comparison
of the circumstances of the global oil
and natural gas industries.

Who controls reserves?
OPEC’s New Directions

production.
Many in the US and the EU are associating OPEC’s rise and subsequent
many-fold oil price increases for
consuming nations with a potential for
the formation of a similar natural gas
cartel of main gas reserve holders and
producers—an OPEC-like Organization
of Gas Exporting Countries (OGEC).

Tables 1 and 2 summarize the latest
BP Statistical Review statistics for June
2006 proved gas (Table 1) and oil (Table 2) reserves at yearend 2005, ranking the top 25 countries in descending
order according to their reported holdings of gas and oil. In Table 2 the 12
OPEC countries are boldfaced.
Comparisons between the two tables
are illuminating. The cumulative reserves column reveals how many countries together control what percentage
of proved reserves worldwide. Although
the broader distribution of reserves
incorporating the lesser categories of
reserves and potential resources provide
the full long-term picture, proved
reserves are those that are most likely
to be converted into production in the
medium term and will serve here to
make the necessary points.

tables: Together with Kazakhstan, it
is the only non-OPEC member in the
top 10 ranking for oil reserves, and
it is at the top of the rankings for gas
reserves, controlling more than 25% of
the world’s resource. Despite its other
mineral riches Russia remains a petroeconomy, historically booming when
prices are high and suffering economic
crisis when oil prices collapse, such as
during the major recession in 1998.

Russia’s gas market role

supply whether it is in or out of OPEC,
and its inability to sustain year-on-year
production growth of nearly 10% that it
achieved during 2000-04 has partly influenced the high oil price environment
of the last few years. It is not necessary
for such a large reserve holder to be
part of a cartel to make its mark on the
oil industry, particularly when supply
is tight.
Russia’s position for gas is even more
dominant, and should a gas cartel form,
Russia would have to be part of it for it
to be effective on a global scale. Indeed
gas reserves are even more tightly held
than oil. Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan together hold
30.7% of global proved gas reserves.
Russia already controls gas supply
from those countries to a great degree

through infrastructure holdings and access to Western Europe.
By adding Iran and Qatar, a cartel of
six nations could be formed, straddling
parts of central Asia and the Middle
East in one contiguous geographic
block that controls some 60% of global
proved gas reserves—the same percentage that Middle East OPEC nations
control of the world’s oil.
By adding the North African producers—Algeria, Egypt, and Libya—along
with Saudi Arabia and Nigeria, another 10% of global gas reserves could
be controlled. It is certainly possible
therefore, in volume and geographic
terms, to conceive of a gas cartel, led by
Russia, with as much resource might as
OPEC holds in the oil sector.
So why has such a cartel not
emerged? The different structures of the oil and gas inTable 3

ent energy sources made to the world’s
primary energy consumption mix in
1977 and 2005.
In the 1970s when OPEC began to
exert an extraordinary influence on the
oil industry, the world depended on oil
for almost half of its energy requirements. Oil was used for power generation, transportation fuel, and as a petrochemical feedstock to create nonenergy
products such as plastics, solvents, and
paint. It was difficult to imagine how
any modern economy could function
or grow without access to a plentiful
supply of oil.
OECD countries had grown accustomed to having ample supplies of
cheap oil as a legacy from its colonial
past.
In the 1970’s natural gas amounted
to less than 20% of the primary energy
mix, and few nations—OECD plus Russia—consumed it in substantial quantities. Gas was used almost exclusively for
power generation and space heating.
Today, although oil’s use is reduced
26

in percentage terms, it continues to
dominate other forms of energy worldwide, particularly for transportation
fuels, and it still vastly outweighs the
world’s dependence on gas.
Table 3 shows that global consumption of gas, however, has more than
doubled in absolute terms since the

1970’s, growing
more rapidly than
any other primary
energy source in
the past 15 years,
whereas oil use
has increased
some 30% since
the 1970s.
Although gas
clearly is raising
its profile and
significance, it has
a long way to go
to rival that of oil.
Moreover, with
current infrastructure, it is easier to
substitute alternative energy sources
to replace gas for
power generation,
as required, than it
is to replace oil for
certain transportation fuels, such
as aviation fuel,
and for specialty

petroleum products.
To achieve the impact and magnitude
of control that OPEC has maintained
over oil supply requires a lack of readily
available substitutes and a dominant
position in an environment of growing
energy demand. Gas has yet to achieve
such status in a global context, but
could yet do so in the next 2 decades
as oil supply becomes tighter and gas
increases its share of the global energy
mix.
Gas markets also are being diversified, with gas-to-liquids (GTL) projects
producing Fischer Tropsch middle
distillates, methanol, and dimethyl ether
(DME) and gas being used as a source
for hydrogen to fuel cells for transportation and embedded power generation
projects.
However, such markets are likely
to remain small for the next decade at
least, and it is hard to see gas rival oil in
any transportation market in the short
term. The significance is that it diminishes the ability of a gas-producers

badly impacted by the oil shortages that
resulted from the oil crises that OPEC
created in the 1970s.
To improve the security of its gas
supply, Japan entered into a series of
long-term contracts with a diverse
range of international LNG suppliers in
subsequent decades.
To further improve its security and
control its supply, Japan’s state-controlled utility companies have taken
equity positions upstream along the
supply chain, all the way back to remote gas fields in some cases.
Subsequently, South Korea and more
recently China have adopted similar
models. Each consumer nation is taking steps to become involved in the
upstream gas chains supplying gas from
the Middle East, Far East (Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia) and Australia.
Australia is of particular interest to
gas consumers of the Pacific Basin. Positioned at number 14 in the proved gas
reserve ranking—with potential to rise
up the ranking as more discoveries secure offtake agreements—it is unlikely
to join an international gas supply cartel
or to be influenced by radical religious
fundamentalist governments that could
renege on long-term gas contracts
should they secure power at some stage
in the future.
Long-term contracts with a large
number of suppliers from different
continents seems to be one means by
which gas-consuming nations can
protect themselves in part from the
emergence of an international gas cartel
in the future.
LNG offers a much better diversification lever for consumers than intercontinental pipelines. Not only can LNG
provide gas from a number of sources,
it also serves as competition to dominant pipeline suppliers such as Russia to
Western Europe and can limit the supplier’s ability to use unilateral threats of
supply interruptions to secure excessive
price increases to captive customers.
Building and developing a vast
network of LNG supply sources is likely
to hinder or inhibit the influence that
an international gas cartel could exert.

to avoid relying completely on a single
source, which would undoubtedly be a
disadvantage should a gas cartel emerge.
Germany, on the other hand, is heavily reliant on Russian gas via pipelines
crossing Eastern Europe. It does take
some supply from Norway, the Netherlands, and Algeria, but it is most dependent on Russian supply.
The Russian-Ukrainian incidents of
January 2006 that led to supply interruption to Western Europe during its
peak winter demand period should be a
warning to Germany and other Western
European consumers of Russian gas to
further diversify their supply.
The UK is establishing new gas supply chains by building new pipeline and
LNG infrastructure. Pipeline gas
supplies will come from Norway
and continental Europe, including
some gas originally derived from
Russia.
LNG will come from Algeria, Qatar, Nigeria, Trinidad and
Tobago, and other suppliers. It is
tempting for the UK to sign up to
large-scale supply deals with Russia
once the trans-Baltic Nord Stream
pipeline—now under construction—is completed. However, a
competitive price for such gas only
makes sense in terms of supply security
if it is backed up with a large percentage of gas from other suppliers. The
new LNG supply chains being developed should provide this leverage.
Diversification also means using a
variety of primary energy mixes. If the
major energy-consuming nations have
learned anything from the evolution of
the oil industry over the past 50 years,
it is that it would be folly for the world
to become as highly dependent on gas
for power generation as we are on oil
for transportation fuel. Hence it makes
sense for nations to have a diversified, long-term energy supply strategy
incorporating nuclear, coal, hydro, and
renewables as well as gas.
This is in the interest of the consumer and the gas industry, as it will help
to preempt attempts by gas-producing
nations to hold consuming nations ran30

Iranian gas seems destined to stay in the
ground for the foreseeable future. This
situation would dramatically reduce
Iran’s current influence in an international gas cartel should one materialize.
However, once major pipelines are
in place to Europe and China from the
Middle East and Central Asia, including
East Siberia, and Russia has secured the
substantial gas liquefaction capacity it
currently is seeking on Sakhalin Island,
in Shtokman field in the Barents Sea,
and at St. Petersburg, with the aid of
investment from OECD consumers, the
impact of a gas cartel would be more
influential on consuming markets.
Geopolitics, massive investment
requirements, technical hurdles,
consumer mistrust, and time to
construct such epic gas supply
systems all indicate that a gas cartel
is not going to happen in the medium-term.
However, by investing in such
projects OECD countries and companies should realize that they are
sowing the seeds for a potentially
formidable international gas cartel
to emerge.
Geopolitical influence and threats to
stability of worldwide gas markets do
not just come from Central Asia and the
Middle East.
The gas-producing nations of North
Africa—Algeria, Libya, and Egypt—
could certainly coordinate supply to
the southern Mediterranean countries
of Europe and perhaps cooperate with
Russia in squeezing supply to Europe.
However, there is substantial competition among these North African
suppliers to secure supply contracts
and market share with European and
North American consumers, and in the
medium-term it is unlikely they would
take actions that would risk loss of market share or alienation from their main
gas markets. Algeria’s more established
infrastructure and supply contracts
place it in a stronger position, with
more market power than its neighbors.
32

Algeria’s recent moves to increase its
fiscal take and control over exploration
and production contracts testify to such
power.
Venezuela, ninth in the proved gas
reserves ranking, like Iran has been
extremely slow to develop and exploit its reserves. The radical, anti-US,
and expansionist policies of the Hugo
Chavez government sought in 2006
to coordinate gas movement across
South America by promoting an ambitious Venezuela-Argentina gas pipeline
through Brazil and Bolivia.
Such coordination could consolidate

in South America. Such a cartel would

gas producers to squeeze the international gas trade.
However, in order to do so, massive
investment in the form of tens of billions of dollars to build long-distance
pipelines and gas liquefaction facilities
would be required to provide this potential South American cartel with the
ability to export gas at all.
The OECD financial sector and
international companies from those
countries would be ill-advised to sanction investments in such infrastructure
projects that risk ultimately being used
to leverage control of international gas
supply in a direction that would be
disadvantageous to OECD gas-consuming nations.

Implications for the US
The US already imports large volumes of gas by pipeline from Canada

and exports some pipeline gas to
Canada and Mexico and LNG to Japan
(Table 4). However in recent years it has
become clear that its gas supply gap is
widening rapidly as domestic production declines and gas demand rises. The
position of gas imports and exports
in the US in 2005 is illustrated in Fig.
2 together with the location of existing LNG receiving terminals and those
under construction in 2006.
Most in the energy industry and in
government recognize and accept that
importing larger volumes in the form
of LNG is essential for the US. Opposition, however, has come from two
elements: local communities concerned
about potential environmental and
safety impacts of specific sites and from
independent US gas producers that
see imported LNG as threatening to flood the US market with
“cheap” gas and erode their currently healthy profit margins.
The battle with the former has
been largely overcome with new
legislation in 2005 and government and state commitments in
2006. However, there has been
substantial delay in commitment
to many proposed LNG receiving
facilities, particularly in California
and the northeast seaboard. So much
so that in 2006 the Energy Information Administration and others forecast
that new US terminals are unlikely to
contribute to much more than a third
of LNG imports by 2020 (Fig. 3).
Most imports will come from expanding existing US terminals and from
new terminals being built more rapidly
in Canada and Mexico.
The position taken by the US independent gas producers is traditional
protectionist rhetoric; they are emphasizing the risks of “getting hooked on
gas imports” and the specter of “an
OPEC for gas.” Their aim is to raise the
fear of a future US gas crisis caused by
a cartel of international gas producers
to which the US would remain impotent to respond. Such independent
producers, however, would be among
the first to benefit from the high prices

that would accompany interruptions to
international supplies.
The reality is that regardless of how
much money is invested in US gas
exploration, it will not generate enough
gas, from either conventional or unconventional resources, to meet ongoing
demand. Imports will continue to be
necessary.
There are risks associated with becoming dependent on gas imports, but
countries such as Japan, South Korea,
and many European countries have
been dependent on them for decades.
These risks can be managed if consuming nations and companies follow some
clear strategies—diversification of gas
supplies, long-term contracts, integrated joint ventures, and diversification
of energy mix—and collaborate with
producing nations along the entire supply chain so that all parties benefit from
the massive investments required.
At this stage the questions that
should be asked in the US should be
associated with “how best to” structure

whether gas should be imported at all.

imports to the US since 2002, benefiting from its closer location and lower
marine transportation costs than other
existing suppliers on the far side of the
Atlantic and further afield in the Middle
East and Asia.
The emergence of Egypt as an LNG
exporter in 2005 plus the imminent
new supplies from Equatorial Guinea,
Norway, Nigeria, and Qatar, all expected
on stream by 2008, should improve
diversification and therefore security of
supply. Based upon these discussions,
a prudent national gas import strategy
would avoid becoming reliant on a
single nation supplier (Trinidad and
Tobago or Qatar?) for more than about
20% of the nation’s import demand.
The deregulated North American
gas market has become accustomed
to trading gas on a short-term basis.
This doesn’t make sense for the bulk

Long-term contracts with send-or-pay
clauses and some supplier guarantees to

Special Report

OECD gas-consuming nations should
have little to fear from the market
power and control that an international
gas supply cartel could exert or from
manipulated supply shortages if they
execute the following long-term gas
import policies:
1. Diversification of gas supply.
2. Diversification of primary energy
mix.
3. Long-term supply contracts with
volume guarantees.
4. Limited investment in gas infrastructure projects that enhance the
market power of potential international
gas cartel coordinators such as Russia,
Algeria, Iran, and Venezuela.
5. Disregard for domestic lobby
groups with vested interests to keep gas
imports in tight supply, enabling them
to exploit captured consumers with
high prices.
Also, should a gas cartel materialize in the future, it is unlikely to ever
influence worldwide trade in gas to an
extent comparable with the power that
OPEC continues to enjoy.
Nevertheless, prudence in contracting and sanctioning of international
supply chain investments, coupled with
vigilance and suspicion of the strategies
and motives of those nations seeking to
establish and exert coordinated global
control over worldwide gas markets,
is required to avoid the emergence of
an OPEC for gas at some stage in the
future. ✦

Worldwide, well over 50% of all pipelines use
coatings which shield (block) cathodic
protection currents if disbondment occurs.
If you specify corrosion coatings with solid
polymeric backings (shrink sleeves, tapes,
and most multilayer systems) on pipelines
with CP, the high dielectric backing can
block your protective CP current. This can
happen if and when the coating disbonds
from the pipe and water reaches the
disbonded area.
Cathodic shielding is a serious problem and a
documented problem. Since the late 80’s there
is a large body of published research on
shielding. Much of this research can be seen on
our website.
Corrosion coatings which permit the passage
of cathodic protection currents to water under
disbonded areas are called “fail/safe” coatings.
In other words, if the coating fails, your
cathodic protection current can keep your
pipeline safe.
Two types of corrosion coatings are proven to
allow the passage of protective CP currents.
One of these proven “fail/safe” coatings is FBE.
The other proven “fail/safe” corrosion coating
is Polyguard RD-6. We have sold RD-6 since
1988, so there are thousands of installations.
We know of no project where serious corrosion
or SCC has been found under the rarely seen
disbonded areas of RD-6.

specifications with our corrosion expert,

opposition to any legislation aimed
at stopping alleged manipulation of

Hours earlier the Alliance for Energy

legislation aimed at alleged gasoline

provisions in the 2005 Energy Policy
Act, authorize prosecutions of foreign
oil-producing countries for violating
US antitrust laws, and cancel alternative

They see there have been no hurricanes,
but there have been refinery breakdowns and significantly lower product imports. Add to that what’s going

situation. But I hope people will understand that gasoline price-gouging
legislation could lead to controls, which
were the most horrific experience we

Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) said Congress

it should increase consumer choices of

Rep. Charlie Melancon (D-La.) said
continued heavy reliance on fossil fuels
poses environmental impact questions, but it will be necessary in the
short term. “We have a bottleneck in

the process. We can’t pump oil out of
the ground and refine it fast enough to
meet the growing demand,” he said.
Rep. Jim Murphy (R-Pa.) said: “One
thing we should not do is adopt policies that establish artificial controls. We
did that during the Nixon and Carter
administrations, and the results were
shortages and long lines,” he said.
“When we refuse to commit support to
building more refineries, we increase
costs by buying products that are refined overseas. It’s the same with crude

goal of diversifying its trading relations away from the US and reducing
its dependence on that market for its oil
exports.
China will provide an expanded supply of oil and gain a larger foothold in
the Latin American region.
The deals include:
• A JV of PDVSA and China National
Petroleum Corp. for oil production in
the Campo Junin field in Venezuela’s
heavy-oil Orinoco basin.

• A JV to build tankers to transport
the crude, with a goal of eventually
having a full fleet of tankers.
• Accords to jointly service and
maintain oil wells and to increase
the daily supply of Venezuelan oil to

Separately, Ramirez said, “We are
planning to build 14 new refineries
in other countries, especially in Latin
America. Most of them were already
included in previous energy agreements. These facilities will guarantee

Kerr-McGee, EPA
settle Rockies air
pollution allegations

Colorado independently initiated
enforcement actions against Kerr-McGee in which it alleged violations at
five gas compressor stations in Weld
County during the last half of 2005.
The state and EPA agreed to begin
joint discussions with the oil and gas
producer concerning those allegations

and others in Utah in early 2006, the
federal regulator said.
Under the settlement, Kerr-McGee will spend $100,000 to reduce
dust emissions from roads that service oil and gas facilities in Utah,
and $150,000 to identify and retire
vehicles with higher emissions than

Kerr-McGee Corp. agreed to spend
$18 million on pollution controls and
pay a $200,000 fine in a comprehensive
settlement covering operations in Colorado and Utah, the US Environmental
Protection Agency said on May 17.
EPA said the company, which
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. bought in
2006, also agreed to spend $250,000
on environmental projects in the two
areas where alleged violations of federal
air pollution regulations occurred.
The settlement addresses alleged
violations at natural gas compressor
stations on the Uinta and Ouray Indian
Reservation near Vernal, Utah, and in
the Denver Julesberg basin of Colorado.
The control measures and operational
improvement are expected to reduce
air pollution emissions by more than
3,000 tons/year in Utah and more than
2,500 tons/year in Colorado, EPA said.
EPA said Kerr-McGee disclosed a
number of the violations itself and
worked with state and federal regulators
to resolve them.

Japan’s energy
explorations

I

f you ever thought exploration and
production meant huge outlays of
cash for oil and gas projects in far-off
locales, think again. Now, with a little
help from the inventive Japanese, the
next energy source is as close as your
nearest garbage can.
Consider the work of Eicoh Co.,
which has commercialized a system
called Yukaki that produces reclaimed
oil from waste plastic. To produce the
oil, Yukaki—to be familiar—first pulverizes and melts such waste plastics
as polyethylene.
Then Yukaki heats the plastic to
some 400º C. in a thermal decomposition tank to vaporize it, whereupon
the collected gas is cooled and the oil
taken from it. We are told the extracted oil is the equivalent to fuel oil,
which can be used to fuel generators
and other heavy machinery.
Ingenious? Well, consider another
idea coming from Japan to reduce
waste and enhance the performance
of power stations, while increasing
the production of a form of natural
gas.

supply. Worse, the shellfish cannot be
used for food and—if left to sit—develop foul odors.
Under the new method of removing and processing the shellfish, both
the shells and the meat are processed
at the same time to recover usable
substances from both. The shellfish
are first put in a solution of acetic
acid, which dissolves the shells, allowing the meat to be removed.
The meat is allowed to ferment in
order to generate methane, while the
solution of dissolved shells is processed to recover calcium carbonate,
which can be used for cement, paper,
and other products. Even the acetic
acid can be recovered and reused.

Algae power

Then, again, Tokyo Gas has begun
marketing a new power-generation
system that employs fuel gas derived
from the algae that accumulate in
harbors.

The company also agreed to:
• Install low-emission dehydrators at
its new Uinta basin facilities.
• Install emissions controls on storage tanks at the Cottonwood and Ouray
facilities in Utah and the Brighton facility in Colorado.
• Install emission controls on 25
compressor engines in the Uinta basin
and 11 compressor engines in the Denver Julesberg basin.
• Retrofit high-bleed pneumatic
controllers with low-bleed models at
facilities in the two production areas.
• Install liquid bed sulfur removal

• Spend $300,000 to develop an airmonitoring program in the Uinta basin.
• Implement a Uinta basin pilot
project which gathers multiphase fluids

• Conduct a study to increase gas recovery and reduce air emissions at five
facilities each in the two basins. ✦

Sudan is climbing on the list of
African oil producing countries and is
seeing its refining capacity expand as
well.
The country’s oil production averaged 414,000 b/d in 2006, up from
363,000 b/d in 2005, said the US
Energy Information Administration, and
China is in the forefront of the country’s oil developments.
Capacity of the two main
pipelines from interior oil
fields to Port Sudan totals
450,000 b/d, and together
these are expandable to
950,000 b/d. Minister of State

for Mines and Energy Angelina Tany said
Sudan plans to be producing 1 million
b/d of oil by the end of 2008.
Sudan consumed 94,000 b/d of oil
in 2006 and exported 320,000 b/d,
most of it to Asian countries, EIA said.
“Factional fighting in the south and
rebel attacks on oil infrastructure have
kept oil production and exploration
from reaching full potential to date,”
EIA said.
An expansion of the Khartoum
refinery to 100,000 b/d from 50,000
b/d was completed in mid-2006, and a
100,000 b/d refinery is under construction at Port Sudan for completion

CNPC is producing oil since November 2004 from Fula field on Block 6
in troubled Darfur Province 400 miles
southwest of Khartoum.
The company is producing 40,000
b/d, EIA said, and intends to raise this
to 80,000 b/d. It has built a pipeline
that transports the Fula crude to the
Khartoum refinery.
Exploration is at a much earlier stage
in other parts of the country, where
various companies are acquiring blocks,
planning seismic surveys, and seeking
partners (see map).
“It is estimated that vast potential reserves are held in northwest Sudan, the
Blue Nile basin, and the Red Sea area in
eastern Sudan,” EIA said. ✦

Ridgeway to delineate CO2 ﬁeld, eyes Permian EOR
A Houston independent has decided
to commence its own Permian basin
carbon dioxide pilot floods hoping
to jump-start demand for CO2 from a
world-class helium and CO2 resource in
New Mexico and Arizona.
A reoriented Ridgeway Petroleum
Corp. has the task of delineating the
nearly 400-sq-mile St. John CO2 field
that the ex-Calgary company’s founder
discovered in 1994. A scant 26 wells
have been drilled in that accumulation,
the extent of which is defined only by
geologic work.
Ridgeway’s founder, Walter Ruck,
who passed away in 2005, thought the
best market for the St. John CO2 was for
enhanced oil recovery in light oil fields

of California’s Los Angeles and Ventura
basins.
Ruck’s successor, Barry Lasker, has
redirected marketing efforts toward
the Permian basin, already supplied by
three large CO2 pipeline systems. Lasker,
president and chief executive officer,
also plans to truck CO2 to Ridgeway’s
own oil production pilot projects until
industry support materializes for construction of a pipeline.

Those pipelines were built in the
1980s from Sheep Mountain field west
of Trinidad, Colo., and Bravo Dome field
near Bueyeros, NM.
The third system originates at McElmo Dome field southwest of Cortez,
Colo. Its operator, Kinder Morgan, is
considering an expansion, but producers have already spoken for all of the
additional supply.
With oil prices near record highs,
demand for CO2 for EOR in the PermPermian EOR

Meanwhile, Ridgeway in February 2007 completed the purchase of
15,000 acres in a 19,000-acre mature
Permian basin oil field. It cited an independent estimate that the field, which
has produced 14% of the original
180 million bbl of oil in place, could
recover a further 34 million bbl with
state-of-the-art CO2 injection.
Lasker said Ridgeway hopes to begin
trucking and injection CO2 later this
year and continue for at least several
months. Last month Ridgeway signed a
binding agreement to purchase another
oil field adjacent to its first acquisition.
Ridgeway did not identify the
properties because it is pursuing other
acquisitions in the area but said they
produce oil from a formation that has
responded well to CO2 injection elsewhere in the Permian basin.

Drillers and drilling service companies
continue to build new
land and offshore rigs,
although yards are full
and there is some softenDrilling
ing in the North American land rig market. This
picture emerged from analysts’ review
of companies following conferences
and quarterly reports.
Operators and service companies
spoke at the Independent Petroleum
Association of America’s (IPAA) 11th
annual Oil & Gas Investment Symposia
(OGIS) in New York in April.
Parker Drilling Co. Chairman, President, and CEO Robert Parker Jr. said the
company’s revenue has been evenly split
between domestic and international and
that US revenue increased 49% in 2006
over the previous year. He expects international business to increase in 2007.
The company has 34 drilling rigs and
19 barge rigs operating in 15 countries
and also operates 8 other rigs under
operation and maintenance contracts.
Parker said the company had $195
million in capital expenses in 2006,
including $72 million to build four,
2,000-hp land rigs; $29 million to
build the 77B ultradeep drill barge;
$8 million to convert workover barge
12B to a deep drilling barge; and $50
million to expand Quail Tools to six
locations in the US.
Dave Mannon, Parker Drilling senior
vice-president and chief operating officer, said the company is benefiting from
increased margins on contract turnovers
for six international rigs, which are all
moving to 3-year contracts in southern
Mexico, Libya, and Kazakhstan. Parker
also has rigs in Colombia, Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Turkmenistan, Sakhalin, Papua New Guinea,
Indonesia, and New Zealand.
Parker Drilling is also benefiting
from the 17 barges it operates in the
US. Mannon said that barge-rig day
rates have risen dramatically in the Gulf
of Mexico in the last 4 years. In 2003,
intermediate-depth barges leased at
about $13,000/day, and the current av-

O D U C T I O N

erage is $38,600/day (197% increase).
Deeper drilling barges that leased at
$17,700/day in 2003 are now averaging $52,900/day, up 199%.
Mannon discussed the company’s
2006-07 front end engineering and design (FEED) contract
DRILLING
to design a unique
rig for BP Alaska’s
Liberty project in
which BP authorized
Parker to procure
long lead items.
Mannon told OGJ
that BP will sanction
the full scale project
in 2008, which will
provide Parker the opportunity to begin detailed design and
construction.
Parker and Mannon reiterated reports
that the company set an extended-reach
drilling record from the Yastreb rig in
Sakhalin I, reaching 37,016 ft laterally
in the Z-11 well (OGJ, May 7, 2007, p.
9).

also noted that Patterson-UTI has a lessaggressive construction program for
new land rigs, which may depress 2007
estimated earnings, relative to companies that are building new rigs.

Construction
Lehman Bros. characterizes
this as “the first significant newbuild cycle during the past 25
years...[encompassing] all major
geographic regions and...every asset
class—land rigs, jack ups, and floaters.”
In early May, Lehman Bros. oil service and drilling analysts Jim Crandell
and Lisa Hackman noted National
Oilwell Varco’s “commanding market
share” in land and offshore rig construction. They believe NOV’s businesses
will benefit in the “robust worldwide
drilling markets” because of expanding
demand for capital equipment.
NOV’s rig technology group manufactures drilling rigs, rig equipment
packages, coiled-tubing units, cranes,
mooring systems, wireline units, nitrogen-injection units, and workover rigs.
The group recently acquired Rolligan, a
manufacturer of completion and service
equipment such as frac units, blenders,
data-acquisition systems, and coiledtubing support units.
NOV’s revenue from rig technology
increased 7% to $1.22 billion in firstquarter 2007 from $1.137 billion in
the prior quarter. Although new orders
for capital equipment fell 14% to $1.2
billion from $1.4 billion in the prior
quarter, NOV’s backlog for rig equipment increased to $6.4 billion from
$6.0 billion. And following the end of
the quarter, NOV booked a $238 million drillship order.
NOV’s backlog for land rig drilling
equipment, however, dropped 33% to
$1.2 billion from $1.8 billion in the
prior quarter; it represented 18% of
total backlog (down from 30% in the
prior quarter). The company said that
the demand for land-rig equipment
weakened in North America but showed
gains internationally during the quarter.
Meanwhile, NOV’s offshore backlog
increased 24% to $5.2 billion from

$4.2 billion in the prior quarter. Of
the current total backlog, the company
expects to deliver about $2.5 billion
in 2007, $2.1 billion in 2008, and the
$1.7 billion balance thereafter—supporting Crandell and Hackman’s belief
that demand remains strong for drilling
equipment, particularly offshore.
NOV’s Petroleum Services and
Supplies group provides consumable
oilfield product such as transfer pumps,
solids-control systems, drilling motors and other downhole tools, and rig
instrumentation systems. The group’s
revenue increased 3% to $692 million
in first-quarter 2007 from $670 million
in the prior quarter.
Demand is strong in North America
and internationally, although NOV saw
declining revenue from Latin America.
Low costs of some raw materials (nickel, copper, bronze) improved margins,
but the company expects those costs to
increase during second-quarter 2007.
NOV’s Distribution Services group
provides maintenance, repair, and operating supplies to drilling and production operations. Group revenue fell 5%
in first quarter to $352 million from
$371 million, largely due to reduced
activity in Canada. This overshadowed
gains in the US (Rockies, Gulf Coast)
and internationally (North Sea, Saudi
Arabia).
Cameron International’s drilling and
production systems group provides surface and subsea equipment. Cameron’s
surface orders were up 22% year-overyear, driven by Eastern Europe. Subsea
orders were down 5% year-over-year,
but order activity picked up in second
quarter. In April, Petrobras awarded
Cameron a $127 million contract to
provide 22 subsea trees and the related
control systems.
Lehman Bros.’ Crandell and Hackman expect orders for 600 subsea trees
in 2007, mostly for Africa (61%) and
the Gulf of Mexico (20%). Cameron
has about 30% market share for subsea
trees, along with FMC (40%), VetcoGray (15-20%), Aker-Kvaerner (710%), and DrilQuip (less than 8%).
Cameron’s drilling equipment orders

fell 29% during first quarter and 47%
year-over-year to about $200 million as
offshore rig orders declined.

Future markets
At the OGIS conference in New York,
Parker COO Mannon said, “Majors,
super independents, and national oil
companies are looking for large fields
to develop. A lot are in frontier markets
that demand rigs to drill deeper, more
directional, and often employ extended
reach technology.”
He said a lot of the fields are in desert, arctic, and other environmentally
sensitive areas. Shortages of personnel
are a continuing problem, but Parker
[and other companies] offer in-house
crew training. HSE performance is often
a critical performance variable, used as
a measure to prequalify contractors and
make purchasing decisions. ✦

monitoring, through cased wells, is the
key for proper reservoir management
and recovery optimization, especially
for large and mature oil fields.
A TDT log has been the main technique for monitoring reservoir water
saturations, but the log has problems in
formations with low water salinity. This
problem was obvious in some wells
in the Sinai oil field that produce from
sandstone formations.
Some of these reservoirs have naturally low 20,000-30,000 ppm water
salinity. Also low salinity occurs in waterflooded reservoirs that use formation

water. Water injection projects in the
field use Red Sea water with a 40,000ppm salinity mixed with 150,000-ppm
formation water.
TDT measurements depend on the
chlorine (NaCl) content in the formation water; therefore, in zones with
water salinity less than 60,000 ppm, a
TDT cannot distinguish between water
and oil. This problem was solved with
the introduction of the carbon-oxygen
(C/O) technique, which was combined
with TDT technique into the RST tool.1-3
Other problems with TDT logs occur
in wells with high pressure or wells that
need to be killed before a workover.
Running TDT logs in wells completed with electrical submersible pumps
(ESP) also in problematic. About 88
% of wells in the Sinai field have ESPs.
The ESP string because it is close-ended
prevents the TDT tool from reaching
the producing formation. In this case,
the production string must be pulled
from the hole first, which requires killing the well with a heavier fluid that

because it has a short 6-8 in. depth of
investigation, even shorter than the TDT.
For these reasons, the Sinai wells
need anther type of cased-hole log for
monitoring water saturation, although
the field experience indicates that both
the TDT and CHFR logs have advantages
and limitations under certain conditions.

TDTs
Interpreting TDTs based on a timelapse technique is the most useful and
practical approach. This technique
requires the running of a reference log
soon after completing the well. Equation 1 (see equation box) then can be
50

used to compute the change in water
saturation.1 4 This technique has the disadvantage that many wells do not have a
reference log or base TDT because these
runs must be made a few weeks after
the initial completion. For wells such
as subsea completion, recording a TDT
base run a few weeks after completing
the well is impractical.
The reliability of a TDT quantitative evaluation generally increases with
greater formation porosity and water
salinity. This evaluation is based on the
summation of the cross-section of all
material multiplied by their respective
volume proportions. In the general case
of a shaly porous formation containing

water and hydrocarbons, Equation 2
calculates the water saturation, Sw from
a TDT log.2 4
The TDT technique is limited by the
following:
• Not for formations that have low
formation-water salinities because measurement depends on the capturing of
neutrons of the chlorine nuclei of NaCl
dissolved in formation brine.
• Not for formations with different
salinity brines.
• Not for formations with near
wellbore effects, formation damage, or
washed-out holes because of the logs

CHFR ﬁeld examples
The first field example is from Well
A, the first well in the field logged with
a CHFR tool. The log was recorded after
running of an openhole resistivity log
and setting the casing. Fig. 1 shows that
the CHFR and the openhole LLD data
have a good match. This logging data
comparison is an important step for
testing and evaluating CHFR data to
monitor water-saturation changes.
The next example, Well B, shows the
use of CHFR logging technique based
52

on determining the difference between
CHFR resistivity and openhole resistivity. These logs are from a well that has
been on production for the years and
produces 2,700 b/d of total fluid from
a 90-m shaly sand layer. Fig. 2 shows
the old perforations from which the
well started producing a 49.5% water
cut.
This well is completed in a reservoir
with a mixed, 90,000-ppm water salinity. The aquifer water has a 150,000
ppm while the injected water has a
40,000-ppm salinity.
This current formation-water salinity
complicates use of a TDT to monitor
changes in reservoir water saturation;

therefore, a CHFR was used to evaluate
the water cut problem. The CHFR was
recorded over the interval 2,495-2,523
m.
The comparison of openhole LLD
and CHFR logs (Fig. 2) showed that
the CHFR resistivity is generally lower
than the openhole resistivity in intervals
R2A and R2B, indicating that these are
depleted and flooded zones.
A squeeze job on the 2,513-43 m
interval and reperforating selectively
the total interval (Fig. 2) to avoid the
flooded out zones reduced the water
cut. The work reduced the total production to 1,500 b/d with the water cut
decreasing to 0.8%.

A third example, Well C, initially produced 820 b/d total fluid, 0.8% water
cut, with an ESP from sandstone reservoirs. After the water cut increased and
reached 72.3%, the operator decided to
make a logging run to determine the
reason for the high water cut. Because
the formation has a low, 22,000-ppm
water salinity, the CHFR was selected
instead of the TDT.
Fig. 3 compares the CHFR resistivity
and openhole resistivity. The logging
data clearly show that the middle of the
perforated interval, 2,589-2,615 m, is
the source of the water.
After squeezing of the waterflooded
interval 2,595-2,611 m, water cut decreased to about 35%.

TDT ﬁeld examples
Well D is an oil producer with an
ESP. Initial production was 1,260 b/d
of fluid with a 1.6% water cut. Fig. 4
shows openhole log of the producing
sand and shaly sand intervals (2,804-

12, 2,816.5-32, and 2,832.5-48 m).
After 2 years of production, water
cut reached 62.3%. Formation-water
salinity was about 178,000 ppm; therefore, the operator decided to run TDT
for detecting the waterflooded zone.
Fig. 5 shows the TDT data for the
same intervals. The TDT interpretation
indicated that waterflood intervals were
2,816.5-32 and 2,832.5-48 m. Based
on this interpretation, the operator
isolated the lower intervals, but this did
not change the water cut and the work
decreased oil production.
Another example is the lower section
of Well D that initially produced 600
b/d. Producing intervals were mainly
sand and shaly sand at 2,933-41 and
2,946-51.
Fig. 4 shows the openhole data,
neutron-density logs indicating clearly
the producing sections. Fig. 5 illustrates
the TDT for the same intervals with the
TDT sigma curve clearly showing that
the waterflooding of the producing

intervals. The interpretation of the TDT
indicates that the water is coming form
Zone IVa.

TDT, CHFR comparison
A CHFR may replace a TDT log in
cases where reservoir conditions or
well completions are unsuitable for
running a TDT log. Also CHFR logs
can clarify any confusion in the TDT
interpretation.
One major problem with the TDT
is the difference between quick-look
interpretation of the TDT log and the
quantitative interpretation of the TDT
with a water saturation model.
Fig. 6 compares the TDT and CHFR
for Zone IV, Well D, and Fig. 7 compares
the TDT and CHFR for Zone IVA, Well D.
The quick-look interpretation of the
TDT indicates that the lower sections
of Zone IV and IVa were waterflooded;
whereas the CHFR indicates that only
the upper section of IV and lIVa were
waterflooded.

Fig. 8 shows a quantitative interpretation of openhole data, TDT, and
CHFR for Zone IV. The TDT interpretation shows that the entire section was
flooded, which disagrees with the TDT
quick-look interpretation.
The CHFR interpretation indicated
that only the top section was waterflooded, which agrees with the CHFR
quick interpretation.
Fig. 8 also shows the quantitative
interpretation of openhole log, TDT, and
CHFR for Zone IVa. Both the TDT and
CHFR indicated that this is a flooded
zone.
Worth noting is that the TDT shows
more water saturation difference with
reference openhole water saturation, indicating more flooding than the CHFR.
The difference between openhole
saturation profile and CHFR or TDT
saturation profiles indicates that Zone
IVa and the top section of Zone IV were
producing zones, but now water has
swept these zones.

But based on the CHFR data interpretation, the operator isolated Zone

thereby reducing the water cut to 38%

Oil & Gas Journal / May 28, 2007

If you are a Ship owner,
offshore equipment
manager or Infrastructure
maintenance manager,
METALIZING will
eliminate corrosion on
the steel covered for
20-30 years and minimize
further maintenance.

Corrosion must be dealt with
by any owner of equipment
made of steel and particularly
those exposed in the marine
environment. In the past, various
paint systems have been used all
requiring follow up maintenance
with eventual complete recoating
for equipment in long term use
i.e.15-30 years. Views promoted
by paint manufacturers of the life
cycle of a coating vary, but no
existing paint system will protect
a steel structure exposed to a
harsh marine environment for
periods in excess of 10 years.
Metalizing has a proven track
record of protecting structures
and vessels for over 80 years of
exposure to the environment.

Metalizing is a process that has been available for
many years but the application equipment was not
well suited for covering large areas in a reasonable time
frame. Now new equipment can spray up to 1200
ft2/hr per hour under the right conditions. Metalizing
can now be applied at the same speed as paint, with up
to 400 microns thickness in an application, requires no
curing time and additionally provides tough abrasion
protection. Metalizing is essentially putting down a
protective, sacrificial layer of metal over a steel
substrate by spraying, typically aluminum or zinc.
Other metals such as copper, stainless steel,
Aluminum-Zinc alloys, inconel and any other metals
that can be drawn into wire form, can also be sprayed,
depending upon the particular requirement. This
process ELIMINATES CORROSION on the steel
covered and lasts 20-30 years. Constant labor and
time traditionally used maintaining painted surfaces
are eliminated.
FROM A FINANCIAL VIEWPOINT of an owner,
the long term financial benefits are that equipment life
is extended and maintenance costs including labor are
reduced with less downtime on the equipment. In the
short term viewpoint equipment that is not affected by
corrosion will command a higher secondhand value as
it will not require current or future paint application
and therefore the owner captures long term value in
the resale price. The question is CAN YOU AFFORD
NOT TO LOOK INTO THIS ALTERNATIVE ?
Current examples of recent projects include 2 dry
cargo vessel decks of approximately 62,000 ft/2, a
vehicle bridge of 400 ft length, Pipe spools for Chevron,
Exxon Mobil, refinery works for Texas Gas
and Kellog Brown & Root. Hatch covers and holds on
bulkers, decks on all types of ships, storage tanks,
hulls, flare booms, steam pipes, crane booms and other
offshore rig structures are suitable for this process.

The Cakerawala production platform (Figs. 1
and 2), an offshore processing facility in Block
A18 of the Malaysia
Thailand Joint DevelopGas Processing
ment Area in the Gulf
of Thailand, installed
semipermeable membranes to lower the
CO2 content in its produced gas.
The CO2removal process on the
Cakerawala
production
platform
(CKP) uses
Cynara semipermeable membranes. The facility was
successfully commissioned in December 2004 and is currently continuing to
operate.

gali Ltd. and Hess Oil Co. of Thailand Ltd., operates the plant, 150 km
offshore (Fig. 3), for the Malaysia-Thai
Joint Authority.
Raw untreated inlet gas to CKP with
about 37% CO2 has a sales-gas specification of less than 23% CO2 before being
delivered to the buyer’s pipeline.
The low-CO2 sales gas produced is
compressed and routed to southern
Thailand in a 34-in. subsea 270-km
pipeline, owned and operated by TransThai Malaysia on behalf of the gas buyers. There, the gas is used primarily for
power generation and chemical industries in Thailand and Malaysia.
Due to a delay in the onshore gas
processing plant, a new specification of
10% CO2 was needed, with an operating specification of 8% to provide
an adequate operating margin. Even

During conceptual design, the project

different processes
for gas separation

processes included
CO2 membranes,
pressure swing

and cryogenic distillation (Ryan Holmes process). Fig. 4 The Cakerawala production facility can produce 425 MMscfd of sales gas with a final CO specification of 15% (Fig. 2).

for CKP due to environmental considerations and space and weight savings.
A technical and commercial evaluation was then conducted of different

CO2 membrane suppliers. In 1999, a
Bangkok
contract was awarded to NATCO to design and build the required membrane
system for CKP Phase 1. In addition to
the membrane CO2-removal system, the
scope of supply included the gas pretreatment system, dehydration, cooling,
and liquids separation for condensate
recovery.

considerations and was developed with
nearly identical operating conditions to
those expected for CKP operation.

CKP membrane description
The design condition of the membrane plant was to deliver 425 MMscfd
of sales gas containing 15% CO2 from
a feed-gas volume of 700 MMscfd and
feed CO2 concentration of about 37%.

Design pressure to the membranes is
630 psig (43.4 barg).
The sales-gas agreement called for
the CO2 content in the sales gas to be
less than 23%; for design purposes,
however, 15% was chosen as the design

point. This enabled Carigali Hess to take
advantage of higher heating value at the
lower CO2 condition, which translates
to more revenue at the same export
volumes.

Questar Pipeline Co. monitors its
pipeline system in Utah, Wyoming,
and Colorado with gas chromatographs
and manages the systems based on
HDP. Questar used four technicians to
conduct a two-phase study on dewpoint
at different locations on its pipeline
system.
Phase I showed agreement of the
dewpoint values from the C9+ analyses to the extended analyses within
expected limits of about 10-12° F. for
95% of the data sets. When compared to
dewpoint by chilled mirror, some of the
data sets matched within the expected
10-12° F. About a third of the data sets,
however, showed chilled-mirror values
more than 20° F. greater than GC-EOS
values.
Investigation found that the agreement between the chilled mirror and
GC-EOS values were within the expected limits of 10-12° F. for Technicians 1 and 2 and that essentially all

Liquid fallout
The issue of liquid hydrocarbon
formation in gas transmission lines has
preoccupied the gas industry for several
years. Fluctuating processing spreads
(the price difference between equivalent quantities of natural gas and NGL)
since 2003 have often led processing
plant operators to minimize hydrocarbon liquid recoveries and enhance gas
production, increasing the dewpoint
of gas delivered to downstream pipelines. Deliveries of high-hydrocarbondewpoint gas into pipelines increase
the likelihood of hydrocarbon liquid
fallout, leading to concerns for both
pipeline operators and their customers.
These concerns prompted formation
of an industry-wide taskforce that published its findings in a white paper.1 The
US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a policy statement in June
2006 providing guidance to pipeline
companies on how to address these gasquality issues. Recommendations from
the document formed much of the
technical basis of the policy statement.
One of the key recommendations
from the white paper was that a pipeline company should include a control
parameter in its tariffs allowing it to
limit deliveries of gas that could cause
formation of liquid hydrocarbons. The
white paper recommended that pipelines use cricondentherm hydrocarbon
dewpoint as the control parameter because it “offered the greatest operational
flexibility for all stakeholders.”
This recommendation stimulated
renewed interest in dewpoint determination methods and their relative
accuracies.
The theoretical dewpoint consists
of any point along the dewpoint line
moving from gas phase to the first small
drop of liquid. The cricondentherm, or
CHDP, is the maximum temperature at
which hydrocarbon liquids could occur
(maximum dewpoint).

an evaluation of dewpoint using the

A C9+ analysis and an extended

The accuracy of the method depends
largely on determining the C6+ components, typically through one of two
methods. The first involves a standard
GC analysis for composition through
C6+, using GPA 2261 procedure10 with
a procedure to characterize the C6+
fractions suggested by Moshfeghian
(OGJ, Nov. 21, 2005, p. 60), Voulgaris,7

The second method for C6+ determination uses either a C9+ analysis or an

Warner used five certified
gas standards for measurement of the dewpoint by
the chilled-mirror method.3
Weight, rather than GC, determines the composition of a
certified gas standard. Warner
did not report the compositions for these five certified
gas standards and did not use
them to calculate the dewpoint by the GC-EOS method.
This article used the compositions of the five certified
gases obtained from Hal Warner14 and ProMax to calculate
dewpoint.
Table 1 shows that dewpoint calculated by both PR
and SRK agree well with
measurements by chilled
mirror. The average difference
for each in ProMax was –3.0
and 0.4º F., respectively. With
good compositional analyses, therefore, the PR and
SRK EOS options in ProMax
predict dewpoint within the
accuracy of the chilled-mirror
method.
Based on this limited set
of observations, SRK predicts
dewpoint 3-4º F. higher than
PR and matches the chilledmirror measurements somewhat more closely.

Chromatographic
analysis
The C9+ analysis groups
the C6, C7, C8, and C9 by
summing the area of the
peaks and assigning a response factor based on the
normal isomer. The on site
gas analysis, which is the
Questar standard C9+ analysis, used a Varian 4900 micro
gas chromatograph and was
performed in the field along
with the chilled-mirror
measurements. Technicians
heated the sample delivery
system to the chromatograph
and the chilled mirror to
120-140º F.
Four different technicians
using the same model GC
performed the analyses. Each
of the four Varian GCs used
an 8-m capillary column and
a 0.4-m Haysep A column.

Extended analysis
The extended analysis
quantified a broader range of
components, especially the
heavier components. Questar
reported BTEX (benzene,
toluene, ethylbenzene, and
xylene) and n-hexane along
100
with several other compounds. It grouped other
compounds in a similar
manner to the C9+ analysis.
API’s 14.1 purge-and-fill method
obtained spot samples in the field for
extended analysis. A heated box maintained the sample cylinder at 120-140°
F. until it was removed and insulated
with a preheated wrap. A 36-in. extension tube kept the Joule-Thomson
cooling away from the cylinder on the
exit throttling device. A truck with a
heated enclosure brought the cylinder
back to the lab, where a heated room
maintained the cylinder’s temperature
at 120° F. Extended analysis used an
HP6890 chromatograph with the Wasson configuration and a 60-m capillary
column with a flame ionization detector.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

Results
Phase 1 of this study included 34
data sets. Analysis of these results led to
Phase 2, consisting of 11 data sets. Each
data set included the field, sample location, pipeline pressure, water dewpoint,
and various hydrocarbon dewpoints.
Collecting the data for this study under
typical operating conditions undoubtedly introduced more variability into
the analysis but should also reflect
actual pipeline conditions.
Phase 1 included five data sets with
hydrocarbon dewpoints near or below
the water dewpoint. Three of these five
originated in the Ferron field and were
apparently near or below the cooling
limit of –40º F. for the chilled-mirror
device. The dewpoints from both the
C9+ and extended analyses also lay far
below the chilled-mirror value.
The cooling limit for the chilledmirror device or the water dewpoint
appeared to interfere with the measurement of hydrocarbon dewpoint by
chilled mirror for these five data sets,
prompting their omission from further
analysis and discussion.
Comparison of dewpoint from the
C9+ analyses and the extented analyses
showed about 80% of the values within
10º F. and 95% within about 12º F.
for both PR and SRK. This is excellent
agreement, given that the C9+ analyses
were performed on site at the sample
locations by four different technicians
using different versions of the same Varian GC. An HP chromatograh collected,
transported to the central laboratory,
and analyzed the samples used in the
extended analysis.
Phase 1 compared the dewpoint values from the chilled-mirror method to
the values from each of the GC methods
using PR (Fig. 2). The GC-SRK combination reached virtually the same results
but with dewpoints 3-4º F. higher than
for PR.
Roughly 30-40% of the data sets
showed chilled-mirror values more than
20º F. greater than GC-EOS values. A
field study such as this typically shows
agreement within 10-12º F. But the
excellent agreement between the C9+
72

and extended analyses lends credibility
to the values calculated by GC-EOS.
A detailed investigation discovered
differences between the samples collected by each technician. Of the 29 data
sets used, Technicians 1 and 2 collected
9 sets and Technician 4 collected 20
sets. Samples collected by Technicians
1 and 2 showed agreement between
the chilled mirror and GC-EOS within
the expected limits of about 10-12º F.,
depending on the GC-EOS combination, for nearly all values, with only one
greater than 20o F for certain GC-EOS
combinations.
The extended analysis, as expected,
gave slightly better results than the C9+,
while the C6+ characterization was not
as good for Technicians 1 and 2.
Agreement between chilled mirror
and the GC-EOS values for Technician 4
were within the expected limit for only
four to six sets, depending on GC-EOS
combination, with about half differing by more than 20º F. Technican 4
collected data for 6 days; three sets were
collected each day for 2 days, and four
sets were collected each day for 4 days.
The technician measured the hydrocarbon dewpoint for each sample by
chilled mirror, ran the C9+ GC analysis
in the field, and collected a gas sample
for the extended GC analysis.
Technician 4 appears to have rushed
and probably did not take adequate
time performing the chilled-mirror
measurement.

Phase II
The data problems in Phase I called
about 60% of the data into question,
prompting Questar to add Phase II and
collect samples from 11 additional
locations to supplement the original
data. Technician 1 collected all the new
samples from the Uinta basin, taking a
chilled-mirror measurement and conducting a C9+ gas analysis.
Fig. 3 shows the results from Phase II
for PR and SRK. The supplemental data
showed that operator error was indeed
the major cause of deviation in Phase I.
The data also demonstrated the efficacy
of using GC data along with an EOS

to predict hydrocarbon dewpoint and
CHDP in a field setting.
PR matched the data in Phase II
slightly better than SRK. Out of the 11
samples taken, all but 1 were within
10° F. or less of the chilled mirror, with
more than half the values within 5° F.
SRK slightly overestimated the
hydrocarbon dewpoints but were still
generally within an acceptable range
generally.
Finding that SRK was a better predictor of hydrocarbon dewpoint using the
five certified gas samples from Warner3,
and that PR was the better predictor
on the Uinta Basin samples, initially
surprised the researchers. The entirely
different nature of the samples, however, suggests that pipelines should not be
limited to just one EOS for calculation
purposes but rather should select one
or several equations that best predict
hydrocarbon dewpoint temperatures
for the particular gas supplies in their
systems. Both PR and SRK agreed with
the chilled-mirror method in this case
within acceptable limits, showing both
the viability of GC-EOS methodology
and the care that needs to be taken
when applying it.

out. Two inflatable dams are positioned
inside the pipe, restricting the length of
the purged section to about 75 mm on
each side of the weld. At the same time, a
sleeve joining the dams occupies most of
the pipe’s diameter, so that only the space
between the outer surface of the sleeve and
the inner surface of the pipe needs to be
purged.
When the Argweld has been positioned

US politicians
need to calm
down on energy
Before taking another step on energy,
US politicians should calm down.
“I start from the presumption,” said
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) at a Deloitte
energy conference last week in Washington, DC, “that overcoming US dependence
on imported energy and working with
other nations to prevent energy crises are
fundamental national security imperatives
on a par with controlling weapons of mass

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e

destruction.”
Good grief. If dependence on foreign
energy threatened national security to that
degree, the US already would be a wreck.
It’s not. It has been importing oil and natural gas for many years. The foreign share of
total supply increases. The economy grows.
Even with oil prices high, the economy
grows.
Is it the elevated price of gasoline that
makes politicians come unhinged this way?
In his speech, Lugar offered a list of
“nightmare scenarios” with oil at their
center: an embargo, severance by terrorists of “our oil lifeline,” and war with an
anti-American regime “emboldened by oil
wealth.” These worries are exaggerated.
The modern oil market is too broad, ﬂuid,
and buffered by strategic reserves for an
embargo to work. There is no “oil lifeline”
for terrorists to cut. And no antagonist will
challenge the US militarily just because it
makes money on oil.
Exporters need to sell oil as much as importers need to buy it. Those relationships
provide more security than can come from
fearful policy lurches.
Yet Lugar proposes to raise the mandate for fuel ethanol to a stupendously
expensive 100 billion gal/year and severely
toughen vehicle fuel-mileage standards.
Meeting elevated miles-per-gallon goals
with all that ethanol would be no easy trick.
But the senator from corn-heavy Indiana
apparently doesn’t worry about trivialities
like ethanol’s energy-content disadvantages, which he didn’t bother to factor into his
oil “savings” calculations.
“Our energy dependence is perpetuated
by a lack of national will and focus,” Lugar
declared.
Baloney. Energy dependence comes
with participation in a global economy. A
country can’t will it away without sacriﬁcing
trade and growth. A country’s aim should
be to stay competitive, not choke itself with
uneconomic energy.
Politicians should quit trying to scare
people.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Supply fears inﬂuence markets
The June contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes topped $65/bbl in intraday trading May 17 on the New York Mercantile Exchange as unexpected shut-ins of
US reﬁning capacity “sent shock waves through the markets,” analysts said.
Among the disruptions that week, BP PLC said it might delay the restart of a
52,000 b/d gasoline-production unit at its Toledo reﬁnery in Ohio. ConocoPhillips
announced it shut in one of three crude units at its 194,000 b/d reﬁnery in Ponca
City, Okla., ahead of scheduled turnaround, and that some units at its Sweeny, Tex.,
reﬁnery were operating at reduced rates. Valero Energy Corp. shut in 64,000 b/d of
gasoline production at its Houston reﬁnery for a week.
Meanwhile, analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.,
said, “Above-average weekly gasoline inventory draws this year have left traders
skittish regarding gasoline supplies, now 7% below the 5-year average, as we quickly
approach this summer’s driving season” at the end of May. The American Automobile Association reported the US average retail price for regular unleaded gasoline
gained 1.5¢ to a record high of $3.129/gal on May 18, just a week before the US
Memorial Day weekend. US pump prices for regular gasoline had advanced 26¢/gal
total within 30 days.
The June crude contract traded as high as $65.09/bbl on May 17 before closing at
$64.86/bbl, up by $2.31 for the day. The June contract for reformulated blend stock
for oxygenate blending (RBOB) jumped by 9.96¢ to $2.44/gal the same day, but it
dropped to $2.41/gal in proﬁt taking on May 18. Crude continued climbing to $64.94/
bbl. At that point, crude prices had remained above $60/bbl for almost 2 months on
the New York market, despite a high degree of volatility from session to session. “We
continue to believe that rising global demand, coupled with minimal excess production capacity from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and increasing visibility of geopolitical risks, are likely to drive oil prices even higher as 2007
progresses,” said Raymond James analysts.
Moreover, the North Sea Brent crude contract on the International Petroleum
Exchange—now viewed by many as a more accurate benchmark than US crudes on
NYMEX—rallied above $70/bbl, representing a $5/bbl premium to benchmark US
crudes. In London, the new front-month July IPE contract for Brent crude jumped by
$2.30 to $70.27/bbl on May 16 but fell back to $69.43/bbl during proﬁt taking in the
next session.
Meanwhile, the value of the US dollar fell against that of most other major currencies after China widened the band in which the yuan can ﬂuctuate against the dollar.
That means that crude, which is priced universally in dollars, is cheaper outside the
US economy, and similarly reduces OPEC’s oil revenue vs. the euro paid for European goods.
Natural gas
Natural gas futures rose above $8/MMbtu May 17 on NYMEX “on fund buying,”
said analysts at Enerfax Daily. “Speculative traders have been trying to push the
market above $8[/MMbtu] but have found higher prices difﬁcult to sustain amid mild
weather,” the analysts said. Investment funds wanted to escape from the trading
range so technical market triggers would kick in to force prices higher. Hedge funds,
who had been betting that the price of June natural gas futures would fall, had to
buy long positions ahead of warmer weather, analysts said.
The June natural gas contract traded as high as $8.14/MMbtu in the NYMEX session before closing at $8.08/MMbtu, up 18.5¢ for the day. On the US spot market,
gas at Henry Hub, La., gained 10¢ to $7.71/MMbtu. On May 18, prices dropped to
$7.94/MMbtu on NYMEX but climbed to $7.89/MMbtu at Henry Hub.
Raymond James analysts reported, “[LNG] imports to the US continue to come in
at elevated levels as a result of the remaining supply overhangs in Asia and Europe.
However, we believe that increased gas demand fueled by a rising price incentive to
burn natural gas over crude derivatives, combined with increased liquid stripping
and declining imports from Canada should help offset the increase in [LNG] imports
during this injection season.”
Analysts at Enerfax Daily said Canadian gas supplies to the US in June may be
600 MMcfd below last year’s levels. “Companies cut their drilling budgets last year
as prices dipped and well costs soared,” they said.
Meanwhile, Raymond James reported May 17, “The natural gas 12-month strip
has reached $9/Mcf for the ﬁrst time in over 8 months; and as such, gas producers
can now hedge winter 2007-08 volumes at an appetizing price of over $10/Mcf.”

GE
Oil & Gas

49 million
tons of CO2 annually

The numbers tell the story
Developed for sour gas reinjection to enhance petroleum production, GE’s BCL
series of centrifugal compressors has recently completed a rigid environmental
and operational evaluation and received ecomagination certification.
Gas reinjection not only stimulates the production process, it also avoids flaring
and the consequent emission of greenhouse gas (CO2) into the atmosphere. The
worldwide fleet of BCL compressors installed since 2000 for sour gas reinjection
by GE’s Oil & Gas business, has the capacity to prevent more than 49 million tons
of CO2 from being released each year. That’s the equivalent of the annual CO2
emissions of approximately 10 million average size cars.

Production flow control evolving
into systems approach

T

he oil and natural gas industry’s approach to production ﬂow control is evolving into a more systemsoriented approach that encompasses not only the life
of a well but also an entire ﬁeld’s life.
No longer is ﬂow control limited to being an afterthought of
completions and simple metering devices. This is a departure
from past practices of providing discrete, standard ﬂow control
products in a piecemeal fashion.
A more-holistic approach to production ﬂow control is being
applied throughout the entire production well stream, from reservoir contact to surface separation. That’s a necessity born of the
changing nature of production practices today. New reservoirs
are discovered in increasingly geologically complex formations.
Bypassed potential reserves in highly heterogeneous zones of
aging ﬁelds are increasingly targeted in mature producing areas.
Service and supply companies now offer complete ﬂow
control solutions to meet the needs of operators seeking to
save time and money while increasing hydrocarbon recovery
and improving ﬁeld economics.

egies,” says Derek Mathieson, vice-president of business development and technology at WellDynamics.
“Today’s key challenges are the following:
• “Selecting and optimizing ﬂow control choke ranges to
more closely match expected reservoir conditions and expected changes over the life of the well.
• “Managing a multitude of interfaces with other completion technologies and surface infrastructures to deliver a
reliable well solution and not just a product.
• “Providing ﬁeldwide solutions for remote control and ﬂow
management where many wells may have a combination
of sensing and control technologies.”

Systems approach

Flow control should be approached with a “cradle-to-grave”
mentality that can result in signiﬁcant reductions in both capital
and operating outlays, according to Joe Jordan, vice-president,
cased hole completions, Weatherford International Ltd.
“Our customers are in the business of designing, installing,
and operating hydrocarbon recovery systems,” Jordan says. “This is

Well architecture
In terms of making the best choices in well architecture to optimize ﬂow control, Mathieson contends that the ability to provide
ﬂexibility and reliability over the life of the well is paramount.
“What has happened over the last 10 years is the evolution
of ‘preferred solutions’ for speciﬁc reservoirs or deployment
areas, as the technology, particularly the ancillary equipment
needed to integrate well solutions, has evolved,” he says.
Examples of these preferred solutions are:
• The two-zone, three-gauge “dip-tube” ﬂow control solution for dual gravel packs in the
Gulf of Mexico.
• The multizone (up to six so far)
ﬂow control “snake well” solutions for thin oil rims in the AsiaPaciﬁc region.
• The multizone maximum reservoir contact (MRC) solutions for
multilateral wells in the Middle
East (more details on WellDynamics’ MRC solutions in the
Middle East appear in the second article in this supplement).

being able to demonstrate economic results.”
Weatherford adopts such an approach, according to Jordan.
“We work with clients during the completion design phase
of a speciﬁc application,” he says. “At that time, we review all
aspects of their installation and testing, potential reservoir and
production management activities, and the impact of any future
workover operations.
“This process yields two important outcomes. First, customers beneﬁt from our expertise in how to better design their well.
Second, we gain detailed knowledge of the speciﬁc application,
allowing us to make more informed recommendations regarding
appropriate ﬂow control and completion equipment choices.” ]

Integrating step-technologies enhancing
production flow control

N

ew technologies are rapidly coming to the forefront to aid operators in the control and monitoring of oil and natural gas production ﬂow.
Technology is at hand to install interventionless completions, or to design them as part of an integrated
ﬂow control system so that future workovers and service
jobs are as painless as possible.
Intelligent well solutions are leading the way, as are advances in tubular goods, sand control, and ﬂowmeters.

Step-change technologies

bleless systems and reservoir monitoring solutions, notes
Mathieson.
“Cableless technologies will enable another suite of applications for multilaterals, in which each individual lateral
can effectively be monitored and controlled as an individual
multizone well,” he points out. “Longer term, it may even
be possible to retroﬁt these types of solutions into existing
wellbore architectures, opening another range of solutions
that impacts a much wider spectrum of wells.”
Increasingly, permanent downhole pressure and temperature sensors are now deployed in a large percentage of
new wells, notes Mathieson.

“There has been a lot of activity over the past few years

economics of drilling/completion and towards a full-life
depletion plan.”
For some workover operations, such as electric submersible pump changeovers, equipment such as hydraulic and
electric disconnects can allow lower completions to remain
in place and be reconnected while the upper completion is
replaced, according to Mathieson.
His WellDynamics colleague, Konopczynski, adds, “This
ability has an additional beneﬁt of being able to shut off communication with the reservoir for the duration of the workover to avoid losses of workover ﬂuids to the formation and
to prevent the associated formation impairment.”
Thinking ahead at the initial completion stage can be crucial for designing future workover operations.
“Generally, most completion designs can be conﬁgured
to have speciﬁc sections where future sidetracks can be
placed or where downhole umbilicals can be more readily
sheared, etc.,” says Mathieson. “These conﬁgurations can
be as simple as speciﬁc space-outs at certain points, additional landing nipples, or additional clamps that facilitate certain parts of potential future workover operations.”
Stephen A. Sakowski, Baker Oil Tools production engineering applications advisor, cased-hole completions/intelligent
well systems, contends that, ideally, advanced-technology
ﬂow control systems are designed as part of interventionless completions that eliminate the need for pulling equipment for workovers over the life of the well.
“If not,” he says, “it is important that ﬂow control systems
include a capability to ‘disconnect’ the downhole equipment
at some point to allow the upper completion to be pulled for
workover operations.”

Innovative completions

to adjust the ﬂow performance from each ﬂow path in the
well, whether they be multiple reservoir zones or multiple
well segments in the same reservoir zone.”
The bottom line, says Sakowski, is that a systems approach to implementing ﬂow control technology is critical to
success of these advanced-technology completions.
“Operators should require that all components of such
completions be designed, procured, installed, and maintained as an integrated system,” he says.

Sand control
Sand control technology in particular is enjoying a period of
signiﬁcant technological growth, with the advent of passive
control solutions also known as “interval control devices”
(ICDs), according to Mathieson.
“ICDs provide the well designer with a means of effectively setting a ﬁxed choke along a length of the wellbore at
the time of well construction, allowing a crude form of ﬂow
control to balance drawdown, particularly in long horizontal
wells or in sections of high permeability,” he says.
For improved sand control, Sakowski would like to see
“lower completions that allow near-full-bore access for
placement of production ﬂow control equipment.”

Flow measurement
Eliminating uncertainty is key to advancing the technology
of production ﬂow measurement. That applies to assurances
about the reliability of ﬂowmeters as well as their accuracy.
Tom Moser, president of the Micro Motion Inc. division
of Emerson Process Management, contends that although

Ecuador claims 90% of oil ‘windfall proﬁts’
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa has signed a decree requiring
foreign oil firms with operations in his country to pay the treasury
90% of their profits resulting from the rise in global crude prices
and not 99%, as earlier stated by official sources.
There was no explanation regarding the change from earlier
reports that quoted Correa as saying that by a new decree “it is
established that 99% of the windfall oil profits will go to the state
and the remaining 1% to companies.”
Under a law passed last year, oil companies and the Ecuadorean government each received 50% of profits whenever prices on
international oil markets exceeded prices established in existing
contracts.
Correa said last year’s law had to be changed, however, because
“it’s not enough for Ecuador to get 50%,” as in the past. He said the
new law puts an end to “the distribution system by which for every
100 bbl of oil, the country (Ecuador) would only keep between 46
and 48 bbl.”
According to Correa’s decree, “It’s the state’s fundamental right
to defend the country’s natural patrimony and preserve the economy’s sustainable growth.”
The new regulation comes as Ecuador is renegotiating contracts
with foreign oil companies, including Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Repsol-YPF SA, and Perenco SA.
Ecuador produces 530,000 b/d of oil. Of that total, 363,000
b/d comes from private oil companies, while the remainder is
produced by state oil company Petroecuador.

Changes proposed to OCS pipeline rules
The US Minerals Management Service is proposing revisions
to its Outer Continental Shelf pipeline and pipeline right-of-way
(ROW) regulations. The new rules would bring the regulations,
last revised in 1988, in line with current MMS policies and selected
industry practices, it said.
Many industry standards covering pipelines have been revised
since 1988, and MMS has issued several notices to lessees and operators containing guidance on applying for, installing, maintaining, and decommissioning pipelines, MMS said.
The proposals include two new safety initiatives. One is a requirement for companies to follow MMS pipeline operations and
maintenance manuals as well as pipeline integrity management and
personnel training manuals. Another would require a pipeline riser
attached to a floating platform to use an independent, third-party
review of its design, fabrication, and installation which would be
similar to, but separate from, the platform verification program.
MMS said its proposed rule also would increase the ROW bonding amount to more accurately reflect actual pipeline decommis-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

sioning liabilities. The proposed revisions would let an ROW holder choose either a $300,000 individual bond or a $1 million area
bond covering all pipeline ROW grants held by a company in an
MMS OCS region.
The proposals also include an increase in annual rental fees
for pipeline ROW grants, currently $15/mile. Guidelines for new
rights of use and easement (RUE) and pipeline accessory structures
and pipeline accessory structures based on acreage would equal
about $125/mile. MMS said the proposed $70/mile rate attempts
to strike a balance between the ROW and RUE amounts.
MMS is accepting comments on the proposals, which can be
viewed online at www.mms.gov/federalregister, through Jan. 31,
2008.

Ukraine, Gazprom reach deal on gas debt
Ukraine is expected to pay $1.3 billion it owes OAO Gazprom
for natural gas by Nov. 1 under an agreement reached Oct. 3 to
avoid cuts in gas supplies.
Gazprom has assured Europe that it will not suffer a shortfall in
gas deliveries after a meeting between Alexey Miller, chairman of
the Gazprom management committee, with Ukraine Energy Minister Yury Boiko. Gazprom had threatened to cut supplies to Ukraine
if the arrears were not paid by the end of the month.
According to Russian news reports after the talks, Boiko said, “I
hope the situation will stabilize in the near future.”
Europe’s Commissioner for Energy Andris Piebalgs welcomed
the resolution, stressing that Europe expects the problem to be
solved by Nov. 1.
“Transparency is capital in our relations with gas supply and
transit countries,” he said.
Earlier, the European Commission urged Ukraine and Gazprom
to speedily resolve the fallout over gas debt payments. It noted that
Gazprom had promised to fulfill all existing gas supply commitments to European companies. The commission has invited Russia and Ukraine to discuss energy security in Brussels later this
month.
Ukraine has disputed the debt. First Deputy Prime Minister, Finance Minister Nikolai Azarov said Ukraine does not “owe a single
cent. The size of debt which it (Gazprom) is talking about is out
of the question.”
The dispute escalated as Ukraine prepared for elections and the
formation of a new government in which Yuliya Tymoshenko looks
set to become prime minister. Russia has been accused of using
energy as a foreign policy tool by punishing Ukraine for supporting Tymoshenko, who had a pro-Western stance during the Orange
revolution leading to the country’s independence from the fomer
Soviet Union. ✦

Lease Sale 205 attracts $2.9 billion in high bids
More than $2.9 billion in apparent high bids—the secondhighest total in US leasing history—were offered for 723 tracts in
the central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 205, the US Department of
the Interior’s Minerals Management Service reported.
The agency’s previous sale in August, Lease Sale 204 covering
the western Gulf of Mexico, attracted high bids of $290 million
(OGJ Online, Aug. 27, 2007).
In the latest sale, the first under the newly demarcated central
gulf area, MMS received 1,428 bids totaling $5.246 billion from
the 84 companies participating.
This sale offered 5,359 tracts comprising about 28.7 million
acres in federal areas off Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Developing these oil and gas rights could result in the production of
776 million-1.3 billion bbl of oil and 3.2-5.2 tcf of natural gas,
according to Interior officials.
About 40% of the tracts that received bids are in ultradeep water
of more than 1,600 m. MMS said it expected the ultradeep and
deepwater areas to receive a high level of interest. It said, “The
progress being made both in terms of discoveries and advanced
technology provide incentive for operators to explore these frontier areas.”
The deepest tract to receive a bid is Amery Terrace Block 206 in
3,398 m of water.
MMS said BP Exploration & Production Inc. submitted the most
high bids, 83 for a total of $107.1 million. Shell Offshore Inc.
took second place with 69 high bids totaling $554.6 million. It
also submitted the highest single bid of $90.5 million for Walker
Ridge Block 7.
Rounding out the top five for high bids were Cobalt International Energy LP with 53 bids totaling $211.3 million, Chevron
USA Inc. with 44 at $283.4 million, and Nexen Petroleum Offshore USA Inc. with 30 at $113.6 million.
The top five companies submitting the highest dollar amount of
high bids are Shell with high bids totaling $554.6 million, Chev-

Drilling

&

BHP Billiton, on behalf of partners Hess Oil Corp. and RepsolYPF SA, has begun oil production from the Genghis Khan development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico 120 miles off Louisiana.
The BHP-led group acquired an interest in Genghis Khan earlier
this year for $1.33 billion. The development, which has pegged
gross reserves of 65-170 million boe, may include as many as seven production wells (OGJ Online, Nov. 12, 2006).
Currently, production is flowing from a single well connected
to a subsea manifold on Green Canyon Block 652. A second well
is being drilled, and two more wells are to follow shortly. One of
these additional wells is slated to test Green Canyon Block 608.
The produced oil is transported to a third-party owned and operated facility where it is processed and sent via existing pipelines
to markets in Texas or Louisiana. The oil is sold as a blend, commingled with crude oils from other pipeline shippers.

ron with $283.4 million, Marathon Oil Co. with $221.7 million,
Cobalt International with $211.3 million, and Murphy E&P Co.
with $161.1 million.
Based on all the bids submitted, Shell offered the highest dollar amount of $650 million for its tracts. Chevron followed with a
submission of $380 million.

Total ﬁnds gas on Mahakam block off Indonesia
Total SA has made two natural gas discoveries in the southern
part of Mahakam block, 45 km off Balikpapan, Indonesia.
Total said both well—East Mandu-1 and West Stupa-1—were
drilled in 60 m of water. EM-1 found 164 m of good quality, gasbearing reservoirs, while WS-1 found 72 m of reservoirs.
Total said the discoveries lie a few kilometers from, and will be
developed in connection with Stupa field. A development plan for
Stupa field was submitted to Indonesian authorities in July.
Work on Mahakam block was carried out with Indonesian firm
PT Apexindo Pratama Duta Tbk., which has five drilling rigs operating for Total in Indonesia.
Total, operator of Mahakam block, holds equal interest with Inpex.

Statoil stops oil development work at Snohvit
Statoil AS and partners have decided to cease oil zone development work at Snohvit field in the Barents Sea as analyses show its
development would not be economical.
“This decision is final,” said Geir Pettersen, senior vice-president for the Tromso Patch business cluster. Pettersen said the upcoming startup of gas production from Snohvit will prevent the oil
zone being developed at a later stage.
Earlier this summer the partnership drilled an appraisal well in
the Snohvit structure to confirm the presence of oil and the thickness of the oil zone in its western part. The well confirmed the
presence of oil. ✦

BHP starts oil production from Genghis Khan

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The Genghis Khan development comprises the western flank of
the Shenzi structure, which lies on adjacent blocks in 4,300 ft of
water. The Shenzi project is also being developed by the same BHPled group. Interests in the Genghis Khan and Shenzi developments
are operator BHP 44%, and Hess and Repsol-YPF, 28% each.
“This project allows us to optimize the development of the reserves at Shenzi-Genghis Khan, providing flexibility in selecting
well locations, production facilities, and the pace of development
to capture the most value possible over the expected 25 to 30-year
life of the field,” said J. Michael Yeager, chief executive for BHP
Billiton Petroleum.
Genghis Khan is one of three fields BHP has in development in
the deepwater gulf that is scheduled to come on stream this year.
The Atlantis and Neptune fields, which are also in the Western
Atwater Foldbelt region of the gulf, are expected to begin production by yearend. These three projects, combined, boost BHP’s net

Five countries agree to extend Odessa-Brody oil line

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Ministers from five East European countries Oct. 10 signed an
agreement for construction of a crude pipeline extension that will
link Caspian producers with consumers in Northern Europe.
The agreement, signed by Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, Poland,
and Lithuania, calls for the building of a 490-km extension to the
existing Odessa-Brody pipeline and securing supplies of Azerbaijan’s crude oil to fill the extended line.
The Odessa-Brody leg of the pipeline from Odessa to Brody was
completed in 2004, and the extension will stretch from Brody to
Plock, in central Poland, and from there to the port of Gdansk.
The pipeline will transport 14 million tonnes/year of crude.

South Korea to build two natural gas separation plants, each capable of processing 800 MMcfd of gas.
The plants will be built on a turn-key basis in Rayong, about
180 km southeast of Bangkok for completion in March 2010, reported PTT executives.
The plants form part of a new gas system PTT is constructing
to ramp up gas throughput from the Gulf of Thailand to meet the
country’s increasing appetite for energy.
PTT is completing a third trunk line that will provide a throughput capacity of 750 MMcfd, enhancing deliveries through decadesold transmission lines that are operating at capacity limits of 1,800
MMcfd (OGJ Online, June 22, 2007).

Spectra gauges interest in Texas Eastern expansion

EPP places MAP pipeline expansion in service

Spectra Energy Transmission plans another capacity expansion
of its 9,040-mile Texas Eastern pipeline system that connects Texas
and the Gulf Coast to the US Northeast.
The company has started to gauge shipper interest in the project, designated the Time 3 Project, via a binding open season
through Nov. 16.
The Time 3 Project involves expanding the pipeline system
from a point in Oakford, Pa., through the addition of compression
and pipeline looping. Existing rights of way will be used, where
possible, to minimize environmental impacts, Spectrum said.
The project will provide many potential receipt points, including existing gas storage fields in Oakford and the proposed Steckman Ridge gas storage project in Bedford, Pa.; points to be created by its proposed Northern Bridge project, which is designed to
move western supplies from Clarington, Ohio, to the Oakford area;
and interconnections to numerous other gas pipelines.
At an estimated $300 million, the Time 3 Project is expected to
be placed into service in late 2010.

Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPP) has placed into service
the final phase of its 50,000 b/d expansion of the Rocky Mountain portion of its 2,500-mile long Mid-America Pipeline (MAP)
system, increasing the system’s capacity to 275,000 b/d from
225,000 b/d.
This portion of the project involved the installation of new
pumps and modification of existing equipment at 20 pump stations. The initial 30,000 b/d of additional capacity was created by
looping more than 160 miles of pipe, which were placed into service in April.
The expansion will enable EPP to handle natural gas liquids from
two new plants: the Meeker gas processing plant in northwestern
Colorado’s Piceance basin, which is expected to be in service in the
coming weeks, and the Pioneer cryogenic facility near Opal, Wyo.,
which is on schedule to begin operations by yearend.
In addition to the Rockies project, EPP in the second quarter
completed a 190-mile, 12-in. expansion of its MAP system between Conway, Kan., and Skellytown, Tex., along with installation
of additional compression. As a result, capacity for mixed NGLs

Government and energy

I should like respectfully to comment on the article in which you attack
Rep. John Dingell’s suggestion that the
government should take action to reduce
consumption as part of a climate change
policy (OGJ, Sept. 17, 2007, p. 100). You
say that it ought to be left to “market
principles.”
Consider the following two propositions:
1. That the US government might
decide that the Saddam Hussein government of Iraq so much threatened peace
in the region that it is legitimate for
the government to assign resources to
overthrow him.
2. That the US government might
decide that the development of nuclear
weapons by Iran so much threatens
peace that it is legitimate for the government to assign resources to overthrow
the present regime.
I am not concerned here with the
rights and wrongs of either policy, but
I would argue that these are reasonable
positions for a government to take. As
we know, the US government adopted
proposition 1 at a huge cost to the
economy in money (and a huge cost in
blood and suffering). Nobody would
argue that “market principles” ought to
decide the issues.
I suggest a third proposition:
3. That the US government might
decide that climate change is so severe a
threat to the US economy, and to other
aspects of the life of the community,
that it is legitimate for the government
to take action to control it, and to assign
resources.
I further suggest that this is an equally
reasonable position for the US government to take. One might argue with the
policy but not with the principle that the
government is entitled to take action.
Climate change will come with huge
and potentially catastrophic costs. Why
should it be right for politicians to turn
their backs and say that everything can
be left to the market? Or for the energy
industry to take the same line?
In saying all this, I am not arguing
for an extreme position. You were kind
enough to publish an article I wrote in

For 2008, EA Gibson has projected
61 LNG carriers will be commissioned. Capacity will average more than
161,000 cu m. Of these, at least 21 are
of more than 200,000 cu m in capacity, and eight of them are for more than
215,000 cu m each.
And for 2008, more than 57 million tpy of regas capacity is set to come
online at such locations as St. John, NB;
near Lake Charles, La., and Sabine Pass
and Freeport, Tex.; and in Baja California.
However late to the terminal scramble, Brazil may open both planned
offshore terminals; another opening
is likely in Chile late in the year; and
another terminal will open in China.

Scale, signiﬁcance
For scale, global crude oil and product transportation facilities dwarf those
for LNG and likely always will.
But this overview illustrates the pace
of development in an industry many
had given up on scarcely a decade ago.
Most important about the development is that, for the first time in the
international trade in hydrocarbons,
natural gas has finally become a globally
traded commodity, breaking out of the
regional restrictions caused by reliance
on pipelines for transportation.
And given the environmental benefits of burning natural gas for power
generation—by far the largest demand
driving LNG growth—such growth is
welcome indeed. ✦

Price and energy politics
In US energy politics, the prime mover is price.
Yet politicians fortify their energy initiatives with
other, seemingly steadier motives, probably because they’ve learned that prices fluctuate. Favorite
motives of the day are global warming and energy
independence.
In fact, however, neither of those issues influenced energy politics generally until prices of energy, especially gasoline, reached levels the public
found outrageous. Energy then became a public
concern with gravity enough to pull global warming and independence into orbit. This happened
perhaps just before and certainly after Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita jolted oil supply. Before then,
global warming and independence were discrete
causes. Energy in general aroused little public
excitement.

New pressure
Because prices rose, politicians feel new pressure to do something about energy. Worse, an
acrimonious presidential election campaign buries
discussion of the issue beneath the fevered exaggerations and outright lies that political discourse
has become. With both major political parties
jousting under the banner of energy against the
twin demons of foreign oil and global warming—on battles against which it is possible to
spend limitlessly to no avail—an appeal based on
price might be the only hope. A study released last
month by the US Energy Information Administration therefore deserves more attention than it has
received.
Conducted at the request of Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), the study examines the 25-by-25
proposition frequently discussed in Washington,
DC, under which 25% of the electricity and 25%
of the liquid transportation fuel sold in the US in
2025 would come from renewable energy sources.
Inhofe asked EIA how much this might cost. Inhofe deserves credit for asking the question.
No government can manipulate energy use
without require sacrifice by energy users. US
energy users should know how implementation
of the 25-by-25 proposal would affect them. In
its study, EIA gauges the effect as the difference
between price and other projections it makes for
the proposal and corresponding reference-case
forecasts in its Annual Energy Outlook, with some
adjustments.

In the case of retail electricity prices, that difference in 2030 would be 0.5¢/Kw-hr, a 6.2%
increase, in 2005 money. To meet the legislative
goals, electricity generation from biomass and
wind would have to be more than 10 times current levels. Use of coal and natural gas in power
generation would fall. Annual consumer spending on electricity would track the reference-case
projections as prices of fossil fuels fell through
2022. After that, the annual expenditure under the
legislative proposals would outstrip the referencecase projections, becoming $16 billion (3.9%)
higher in 2030.
The price effect of the 25-by-25 proposal on
transportation fuels—politically more reactive
than electricity—is much greater. Against reference-case projections, the retail price of gasoline
would be higher by 10¢/gal (5%) in 2020, 28¢/
gal (1.3%) in 2025, and 24¢/gal (1.1%) in 2030.
The diesel fuel disparity would be even greater,
EIA says. Overall, the proposal would raise consumer expenditures on all liquid transportation
fuels by 5.4% in 2020 and 8% in 2030.
Hitting the renewable-fuel targets would
require ethanol and biodiesel supply to increase
during 2005-25 by a factor of 12. EIA points out
that such an increase would raise food prices, with
corn, for example, costing $6.25/bushel in 2025
instead of $3/bushel in the reference case. And
the higher energy prices would reduce economic
activity.

Consumption declines
Meeting the 25-by-25 goals would lower the
use of fossil energy from reference-case projections: of coal by 23% in 2030, of natural gas by
26%, and of petroleum by 12.1%. Asked if they
would support those consumption declines, most
Americans would answer affirmatively. Asked if
they would favor those consumption declines at
the cost of the price increases EIA projects for electricity, gasoline, diesel, and food, and the consequent damage to economic growth, most Americans might answer differently.
Not long ago, Americans didn’t know how
much coal, gas, and oil they used. They didn’t
care. What they cared about then is what they care
about now: price. Told of EIA’s new study, they
might begin to care supremely about what some
lawmakers want to do to them. ✦

Independent oil and gas producers
are moving into traditional producing areas of the UK Continental Shelf
(UKCS) as major companies move
toward technologically the region’s
challenging frontiers or out altogether.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Chevron
Corp., and ExxonMobil Corp. recently
have begun selling UK North Sea fields,
following BP PLC and ConocoPhillips
last year. Increasingly taking their
place are companies like Fairfield

Oilexco Inc., and

but still plentiful enough to represent
much of what remains a large target for
exploration and production. The trade
group Oil and Gas UK estimates potentially recoverable oil and gas reserves for

tax and cost increases, equipment and
worker shortages, and the indirect effects of a global credit squeeze.

UK attraction

The ability to develop small North
Sea oil and gas fields via tie-in to the
large production facilities installed years
ago by major producers has long been
recognized as an attraction to independent operators.
In addition, active asset trading has
enabled relatively small companies to
establish positions on the UKCS quickly.
The government has helped.
“The Department for Business,
Enterprise, and Regulatory Reform
[formerly the Department of Trade and
Industry] has simplified the paperwork for asset trading and improved
the process for third-party access to
infrastructure,” said Geoff Gillies, lead
analyst for Europe at Wood Mackenzie.
“The fallow-fields initiative, where
unworked acreage and discoveries are

Government policies
Encouraging activity by independent producers has been an aim of UK
licensing policy.
In 2002, the former Department of
Trade and Industry introduced promote
licenses, offering them at reduced cost
to small producers willing to generate prospects and commit to prompt
work programs by themselves or others.
It also introduced the fallow initiative mentioned by Gillies, a system for
transferring licenses with no activity to
companies agreeing to aggressive work
programs.
According to North Sea consultancy
Hannon Westwood, the initiatives have
stimulated exploration and appraisal in
general and work by operators new to
the UKCS in particular.
Hannon Westwood Technical Director Andrew Vinall noted recently that
37% of more than 3,600 individual
working interests on UKCS acreage fall
under pressure for early activity from
the promote program or frontier licenses, which encourage operators, not
specifically small producers, to generate
and promptly drill prospects in unusually challenging areas such as deep
water. He also cited the fallow initiative.
“Fallow wells are important as they
tend to examine riskier but larger
structures compared to traditional joint
ventures targeting near-field accumulations,” he said. “We have seen farm-in
exploration wells on fallow acreage outperform regular joint-venture-funded
wells by a significant margin.”
Jim Hannon, founding partner of the
consultancy, said drilling in the past 2
years “exceeds the 50 or so wells per
year that are necessary to adequately
explore and appraise the remaining
potential of the UKCS at a reasonable
pace.”
According to a Hannon Westwood
report, 116 UKCS exploratory and appraisal wells drilled in 2005-06 found

(R-Ariz.) introduced on Sept. 12. ✦

Onshore pipeline spend to be $180 billion by 2012
An estimated $180 billion will be
spent on onshore pipeline projects
worldwide through 2012, says Douglas-Westwood analysts in a new study,
“The World Onshore Pipelines Report
2008-12.”
Based on strong market drivers and
the volume of announced projects, the
analysts expect the onshore pipelines
industry to experience “substantial
and sustained growth over the forecast
period.”
Analyst John Westwood, speaking at
Brazil’s Rio Pipeline 2007, said: “With
oil and gas demand set to continue
growing, production increases are
forecast, leading to greater need for the
transportation of products to market. Increasing demand for gas to be
transported vast distances from source
to market in places such as the USA
and Australia, coupled with previous
underinvestment in Russia, for example,
and aging infrastructure set the stage for
an increase in onshore pipeline project

investment over the forecast period.”
According to Westwood, “Currently,
there are almost 2 million km of oil,
gas, and product pipelines installed
globally, with 65% located in North
America and Eastern Europe and the
FSU (Former Soviet Union), with gas
pipelines making up the majority.”
The Douglas-Westwood report
forecasts a 16% increase in kilometers
of pipelines installed during 200812, compared with the historic 5-year
period of 2003-07. Nearly 75% of this
expenditure is expected to be spent in
Asia, Eastern Europe and the FSU, and
North America. Almost 70% of this
expenditure is expected to be allocated
for gas pipelines.
Asia stands out as the largest forecast
market based on the length of pipeline
construction. The region accounts for
$42 billion of forecast capital expenditure.
The status of forecast pipeline
projects shows that about 47% are

in the planning stage, 40% are under
construction or have been ordered, and
13% have been approved. Analysis on
a project-by-project basis has resulted
in more than 90,000 km of announced
pipeline projects being ‘slipped out’
of the forecast period. However, new
projects that will be commissioned over
the forecast period will compensate
somewhat for project slippage.
Pertaining to the future of the LNG
market, the report predicts that “although the LNG market is continuing
to experience strong growth and is
expected to increase its share of gas
transportation from around 7% in 2003
to 26% by 2025, piped gas will remain
the main method of gas transportation, carrying over 30% more gas (by
volume) in 2025 than in 2007. With an
onshore activity boom under way, both
upstream and downstream projects are
exerting an upward pressure on levels
of pipeline construction. ✦

NGC: Gas to play critical part in reducing GHG emissions
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Conventional natural gas supplies
from basins currently restricted for
exploration and development will be
needed if the US adopts greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions reduction mandates,
the Natural Gas Council said Oct. 3.
The findings were contained in an
NGC-commissioned study of S. 280,
the Climate Stewardship and Innovation

Act, which US Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman
(I-Conn.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.)
introduced on Sept. 12. The bill aims
to reduce domestic GHG emissions
by 30% below the “business as usual”
scenario by 2020 and by 60-80% from
current levels by 2050.
NGC said its study built on the US
Energy Information Administration’s
recent analysis of S. 280’s potential
domestic economic impacts, but added
that the study’s findings can be applied

to other climate-change proposals. NGC
said it used conservative assumptions
under the National Energy Modeling System, or NEMS, including the
unlikelihood that 145 new US nuclear
power plants would be built by 2030
as EIA assumed in a July analysis of the
legislation.
More constrained nuclear power

he changing of the Republican
leadership on the US Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee is a relatively small consequence of Pete V. Domenici’s deciding
not to seek reelection in 2008 for
health reasons. But it could have a big
impact on the oil and gas industry in
Congress.
It’s easy to identify the two bills
that Domenici promoted during his
35 years in the Senate that most affected the industry: the Energy Policy
Act of 2005 and the Gulf of Mexico
Energy Security Act of 2006.
Both became law because of
compromises he developed to assure
passage. This especially mattered in
the second bill. The compromise cut
provisions to increase offshore leasing that the House had passed but
that the Senate would not.
The final bill retained language
initially establishing shares of federal
revenues for affected coastal states—
crucial to gaining support of senators
from Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and
especially Louisiana. It also added 25
miles to a proposed coastal buffer
zone that helped end opposition by
Florida’s senators.
Consequently, the US Minerals Management Service has begun
preparations for federal oil and gas
leasing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

Bingaman, made the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee more
bipartisan than others in the Senate
as its chairman and chief minority
member. They carried on a tradition
I first observed in the early 1990s
26

when Democrat J. Bennett Johnston
of Louisiana and Republican James
McClure of Idaho held those posts.
Bingaman and Domenici traded
jobs earlier this year after Democrats
gained a majority in the Senate during the 2006 elections, but they have
continued to cooperate.
“Today, and during his entire Senate career, Pete has achieved what all
of us try to achieve—that is, to be
effective in getting results in Washington while also staying close to
the people who have sent us here
to represent them,” Bingaman said
on the Senate floor after learning of
Domenici’s decision.

Next top Republican
An obvious question is who will
follow Domenici as the committee’s
top Republican. Larry E. Craig of
Idaho was No. 2, but he lost his seniority after legal problems in August
made his reelection next year questionable. So it’s likelier that Alaska’s
Lisa Murkowski, who was No. 3, will
get the job.
That could be interesting, since
she supports not only opening the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
Coastal Plain to oil and gas leasing
and constructing a gas pipeline from
Alaska to the Lower 48 states but also
investment incentives for renewable
energy and reform of automotive fuel
efficiency standards.
Domenici has 15 more months
in office, however, and he’ll likely
play a major role in the upcoming
House-Senate energy conference.
His potential successors on the Senate energy committee and in New
Mexico probably will pay close attention. ✦

need to comply with carbon dioxide
limits, NGC’s study said. The higher
wellhead prices would affect all consuming sectors but have their biggest
impact on electric utilities and industrial users paying more for CO2 allowances
required to consume gas, it said.
Leaders from four oil and gas industry associations that are also NGC
members said NGC believes gas will be
a critical component in achieving GHG
reductions under any climate-change
legislation. They said the US gas industry would welcome the exploration of
policies with Congress to facilitate optimizing the potential contribution of gas
as a bridge fuel to generate electricity
until GHG emission reduction technologies and market mechanisms can
be implemented.

Signiﬁcant component
“No climate-change approach
should be adopted unless it includes
mechanisms to assure access to
American natural gas,” said Mike Linn,
chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association of America and NGC.
“Even with the potential changes in the
energy supply mix to expand renewable
fuels, improve efficiency and enhance
conservation, natural gas will continue
to be a significant supply component
and leading solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.
Skip Horvath, president of the
Natural Gas Supply Association, said
NGC was puzzled by EIA’s conclusion that less gas would be used under
carbon-reducing legislation. “When we
examined the reasons, we noticed that
EIA’s assumptions were constrained by
that agency’s restrictions on modeling
US societal and political limitations.
After adjusting these assumptions to
better reflect US realities, we found that
an additional 4 tcf of gas would be used
above the base case by 2020,” he said.
Results from NGC’s modeling project
show that gas will continue to play a
key part in meeting US energy needs
and reducing GHG emissions under the
most likely scenarios, said Donald F.

“Yet some policymakers remain
determined to frustrate the nation’s
ability to gain access to additional gas

domestic sources and from the global
market. We need an honest discussion
about the importance of gas supply and

infrastructure development as part of a

encourage ample, environmentally
responsible production of the gas we

keep us globally competitive, future

generations of American businesses and
families will pay a hefty price.”
Parker said the average American gasconsuming household uses 33% less gas

Rowan Cos. pleads guilty to environmental charges
Rowan Cos. Inc. has pleaded guilty to
three felonies involving the discharge of
pollutants and garbage into the Gulf of
Mexico from the Rowan-Midland drilling rig, the US Department of Justice
reported.
Nine employees also filed guilty
pleas to related charges. Although the
company sold the Rowan-Midland rig
in January, the discharges were made
in 2002-04. Rowan and its employees
pleaded guilty Oct. 9, 2006, in federal
court in Beaumont, Tex.
A government investigation revealed
that Rowan employees discharged waste
hydraulic oil mixed with water, used
paint, paint cans, and other pollutants
and garbage into the gulf and failed to
notify the government of violations of
the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Act
to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS).
The company will pay a $7 million
criminal fine, along with community
service payments totaling $1 million to
five state government enforcement organizations for environmental training,

education, and enforcement coordination.
Rowan of Houston also provided a
community service payment of $1 million to the National Marine Sanctuaries
Foundation to be used for preservation
and protection projects at the Flower
Garden and Stetson Banks National Marine Sanctuary off Texas and Louisiana.
As part of a plea agreement, Rowan
will be subject to 2 years probation
during which time it will reorganize its
corporate structure to add an environmental division and implement a comprehensive environmental compliance
plan for its rigs.
In cooperation with the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Coast
Guard, Rowan will develop new sandblasting techniques and help establish
new industry standards for the minimization and containment of sandblasting
debris over water.

Employees plead guilty
Charges associated with these violations were filed in the US Eastern Dis-

trict of Texas. In the US Eastern District
of Louisiana, Rowan pleaded guilty to
one CWA felony count for discharging
pollutants into the Sabine River as a result of sand blasting operations used to
clean the rig in Port Fourchon in 2004.
Nine supervisory employees of
Rowan pleaded guilty to charges related
to Rowan’s violations. Carl Smith,
James Rawson, Warren James, and
Randy Hoover each pleaded guilty to
negligently discharging pollutants and
agreed to pay a $2,500 fine.
David Burcham and Murphy Comardelle each pleaded guilty to a failure
to report knowledge of a felony regarding illegal discharges of waste oil and
agreed to pay $5,000 in criminal fines.
Terry Glen Fox and Michael Friend
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges
for negligently discharging waste oil
and agreed to pay $2,500 in fines. Michael Freeman pleaded guilty to a felony violation for knowingly discharging
waste oil and faces a maximum fine
of $250,000, the exact amount to be
determined by the court. ✦

Total CEO says work will continue in Iran, Myanmar
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Total SA Chief Executive Christophe
de Margerie, in an interview with Le
Monde newspaper, has affirmed that his
company will continue to work in Iran
and Myanmar despite pressure coming
28

from government and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
In response to a request by French
President Nicolas Sarkozy, who asked
Total to freeze all of its investments
in Myanmar, De Margerie said it
would be “provocative” to invest in
that country today. But, he noted that

Total’s investments “date back to the
1990s and there have not been any
new ones. We have been asked not to
talk about our activities. I find that is
very good.”
De Margerie also commented on
requests by NGOs to withdraw from
Myanmar, “We listen to [NGOs], but

they do not decide what the group does. Total will not get
out.”
Noting that his firm was awarded the Helen Keller humanitarian prize 2 years ago, De Margerie said NGOs vary in
their perception of his firm’s contributions to rights issues.
Even the opposition in Myanmar has not sought Total’s departure from the country, he added.
Referring to recent demonstrations in Rangoon, De
Margerie said, “We did not wait for this crisis to become involved locally and [to] support activities that are in keeping
with our code of conduct, which bans forced labor.” Total
has “intervened massively with the junta in the past to avoid
these blunders,” he said.
Responding to questions about legal cases against Total in
connection with forced labor in Myanmar, De Margerie said
both suits filed against the company were dismissed. “There
is no forced labor at our facilities.”
De Margerie also dismissed suggestions that the company is indirectly supporting the military regime through
Yadana, which allegedly brings the state $500 million/year,
saying all companies that pay taxes could face that type of
charge.
“These taxes (30%) are paid by Total as well as by its
three partners: Chevron, PTTEP (Thailand) and the Burmese
national company.”
However, he insisted that, “Total, no more so than any
other company, cannot ask the government what it does
with that money. Yadana earned the state a total of 350
million euros in 2006. The [Myanmar] government would
have earned this revenue regardless of whether the shareholder was Total or a Chinese, Indian, Thai, or South Korean
company.
Turning to Iran, De Margerie acknowledged that “there
are differences between the current government and the
international community.” As for Pars LNG, however, he said
it is a very important LNG project and one the company has
been working on for 10 years.
“It has to be reviewed; its costs have skyrocketed. It is
clear that before we begin, we shall take the political context
and the nuclear crisis into account. The question does not
arise today [because] the contract does not exist.”
De Margerie said pressure from the US over Iran is “very
strong” but that Total, like any other oil company, has its own
interests to consider. “No country, regardless of how powerful it might be, can unilaterally decide where an oil company
can invest,” he said. “It is up to the company to assess the
risks.”
He noted the demands of politicians, but said they are
conflicting. “Demands cannot be made to have oil prices under control and at the same time push producer countries to
shut off the taps. This oil—we are required to go get it where
it is.” ✦

Norwood to press exploration program in Nicaragua
Numerous opportunities may have
gone unevaluated in Norwood Resources Ltd.’s initial two-well program in the
remote Sandino basin in nonproducing Nicaragua, a consulting engineer’s
report indicated.
In addition to possibly productive
formations at the San Bartolo and Las
Mesas exploratory wells, the Vancouver,
BC, company’s integration of well and
seismic data confirmed the existence of
8-10 nearby structures with 2 to 5 sq
miles of closure each, using only the
productive intervals discovered at San
Bartolo as horizons of interest.
Meanwhile, the consulting engineers’ evaluation of logs and drillstem
tests from the two wells suggests that
several potential reservoirs were damaged during drilling and testing and
that large potential may exist in zones
thought to be water-bearing or tight
(OGJ Online, July 12, 2007).
Zones at 6,764-6,835 ft and 6,2106,277 ft at San Bartolo are capable of
commercial production rates that could

approach the initial DST flow rates of
570 and 365 b/d, respectively, with
proper cleanup, the evaluation concluded.
Several of the tested intervals, including 8,610-38 ft and 6,380-6,584 ft,
were damaged by drilling or completing overbalanced and would require
some stimulation to determine their
productivity. Acid frac stimulated intervals at 7,014-7,244 ft, 6,135-85 ft,
6,066-6,110 ft, 5,975-6,010 ft, and
5,790-5,885 ft need to be flowed for
longer periods to determine their true
production rates. DSTs run on damaged intervals caused several zones to be
abandoned without testing and considered unproductive, which may not be
the case, the evaluation said.
Artificial lift is probably needed, but
low-pressure gas in the oil in the successfully tested intervals could facilitate
gas-lift production as opposed to installing surface or submersible pumps.
This gas probably caused the appearance of gas flows while drilling and the

unneeded builds in mud weights that
contributed to formation damage.
The interval 3,350-3,460 ft was
found to be the most promising at Las
Mesas. The interval might produce better than the initial 107 b/d flow rate,
but artificial lift is implied.
Intervals at 8,818-38 ft, 8,708-28 ft,
7,846-8,034 ft, and 7,054-90 ft warrant further investigation.
Recoveries at 4,742-4,810 ft and
3,908-4,186 ft are considered invalid
because it is suspected that the fluids
were from failed squeeze perforations.
The report recommends modifying drilling practices, including single
trip tubing-conveyed perforating/DST
to maintain underbalanced perforating, sample-chambered DST tools, and
possibly air drilling. Avoiding formation
damage is of high importance because
of the sands’ clay content.
The company is retooling to continue its exploration program at reduced
cost and has evaluated rigs in four US
states. ✦

Tengizchevroil ﬁned for Tengiz ﬁeld sulfur storage
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Kazakhstan authorities have imposed
a $609 million fine on Tengizchevroil
(TCO), the Chevron Corp.-led consortium developing giant Tengiz oil field,
for alleged violations of national environmental legislation.
Kazakh Environmental Protection
Minister Nurlan Iskakov said the company “is causing colossal damage to the
environment and all people in Kazakhstan’s western region by its actions.” He
said complaints had been filed against
the consortium for storing uncondensed sulfur during 2003-06.
A TCO spokesperson said the consortium had received notification of
30

the fine but said the firm would appeal.
TCO said formal notification of the fine
was delivered by a local court in July.
The firm said it operated and managed
its sulfur storage in an environmentally
safe manner.
TCO also said it was reducing the
sulfur stockpiles by increasing sales,
which have increased by 28% as of
June 30. Sulfur has been sold to China,
Russia, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan, and
some Mediterranean countries.
After the July notification, however,
TCO came under further pressure in
September when Kazakh parliamentarians threatened to revoke the company’s
license if it did not produce a plan
to deal with the storage of millions
of tonnes of sulfur at the site. Gani

Kasymov, a member of the upper house
of parliament, called for TCO’s project to be suspended unless the joint
venture dealt with the “huge stocks”
of sulfur that have built up at the field
as a byproduct of the production of
sour Tengiz oil and gas. “The nation is
closely watching the government’s actions to protect our country’s economic
interests,” Kasymov told parliament.
Chevron thought its problems with
the Kazakh government had been
resolved later in September when Chief
Executive Officer Dave O’Reilly met
with Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Masimov and other officials, who praised
TCO as a model of cooperation.
“The regional authorities have always
found the common ground with TenOil & Gas Journal / Oct. 15, 2007

said Bergei Ryskaliyev, the governor of
Atyrau, the region of Kazakhstan where
TCO operates.
“Taking advantage of this opportunity, I once again want to express my

appreciation for the work done by Tengizchevroil in the region,” Ryskaliyev
said at a meeting with O’Reilly.
In August, TCO said it produced 6.72
million tonnes of oil in the first half of
2007, an increase of some 12% over

the 6 million tonnes it reported for the
same period in 2006.

COMPANY NEWS

KMG EP to acquire interest in Citic Energy
JSC KazMunaiGas Exploration
Production (KMG EP) will buy a 50%
stake in Citic Canada Energy Ltd. for
$930 million, which will provide access to the Karazhanbas field in western
Kazakhstan.
In other recent company news:
• Norway’s Pertra ASA announced
plans to merge with DNO ASA’s Det
Norske Oljeselskap ASA (NOIL) in a
move that will create the second-largest operator in Norway after the newly
formed StatoilHydro ASA.
• OMV AG plans to grow production to 500,000 boe/d by 2010 from
a current 324,000 boe/d through acquisitions and organic growth, a senior
company executive told reporters Oct. 9
in Vienna.

KMG EP acquisition
Citic Canada owns Citic Canada Petroleum Ltd., which has total control
of JSC Karazhanbasmunai (KBM), a
large oil and gas company developing that field. Total proved reserves of
KBM as of Jan. 1 were 363.8 million bbl of oil according to a Miller
& Lents Ltd. reserve report. In 2006,
Karazhanbas produced 2.3 million
tonnes of oil.
Askar Balzhanov, KMG EP chief
executive, said the deal—approved by
board members Oct. 3—would boost
its production level by another 10%.
“We are working closely with Citic with
32

the goal to improve performance of
Karazhanbas field,” he said.
KMG EP will pay $875.5 million for
its interest in CCEL and spend $54.5
million on financing costs. “Management structure of CCEL and CCPL as
well as underlying assets will include
representatives of both shareholders.
Important matters, including related
party transactions, annual work plan,
budget, significant financial commitments and significant supply contracts
will require unanimous approval,” KMG
EP said.
The transaction follows an option
agreement KMG EP signed with JSC National Co., Kazakhstan’s state-owned oil
company, to acquire interest in CCPL by
yearend (OGJ Online, May 30, 2007).
KMG EP will spend $150 million
from its own funds to finance the deal
and will be entitled to a preferred
return of $26.2 million/year from the
project. CITIC will provide limited recourse financing to KMG EP to meet the
shortfall and other financing charges
at a cost comparable to KMG EP’s own
cost of financing.
Closure of the 50% beneficial interest is expected to be completed before
the end of the year once the parties
have secured necessary regulatory approvals.

Pertra-NOIL merger
The transaction is expected to close
in November pending approval by the
companies’ shareholders and Norwegian authorities.
The new company will be called Det
norske oljeselskap ASA. It will operate
17 licenses off Norway and expects as
operator to drill 20 exploration wells
over the next 3 years.
Pertra Chief Executive Erik Haugane
and Chairman Kaare M. Gisvold will
both continue in their respective roles
with the new company.
The deal, structured as an exchange offer, requires Pertra to swap
each one of its shares for three shares
in NOIL. DNO will be the largest
shareholder of the new company
with a stake of 39.97%. Terms of the
agreement requires DNO to reduce
its stake to no more than 25% by
yearend 2008.

OMV looks at acquisitions
Helmut Langange, OMV head of
exploration and production, said,
“Developing new fields will contribute
more than 70,000 b/d in places like
Pakistan and New Zealand. We are one
of the few companies that can show
organic production growth of 5-6%/
year.” OMV expects 100,000 b/d from
its 2010 target will come from acquisitions. Langange acknowledged that
would be difficult with high prices now

being paid for assets.
Romania is a key license area for the
company with 65,000 sq km of acreage.
It is applying modern seismic technology to help increase its exploration
success.
OMV is focusing on drilling deep
wells onshore and deepwater wells
offshore in light of high oil prices. Its
deep onshore wells are hitting 5,500 m
in Austria. “The target has been gas, and
we’ve been very successful with that,”
Langange told OGJ.
OMV is drilling deepwater wells in
the Atlantic margin, New Zealand, and
Egypt, but the major problem is securing drilling equipment for which prices
have soared. “This is driven by a scarcity
of ships and the huge demand in Gulf
of Mexico, Norway, and West Africa,”
Langange added.
OMV is a partner with operator
Chevron Corp. in Rosebank, which
recently tested 6,600 b/d of oil in
July (OGJ Online, July 18, 2007).
However, it took the partners 2 years
to acquire a drillship that could reach
depths of 1,500 m. Hiring these vessels 2 years ago cost $150,000/day
and now costs are $600,000/day,
Langange said.
Presently OMV is able to recover
about a third of its reserves but wants
to improve recovery rates to 50% and
expand into frontier areas. “Research
should focus on how to recover more
oil. Enhanced oil recovery is helping
and we are using more sophisticated
methods such as surfactant flooding,
reducing tension pressure, and carbon
dioxide flooding to get out more oil
and gas.”
Langange is not optimistic that
prices would ease in the short term. “I
don’t think the extra capacity will come
on stream in time. Projects are being affected by time delays and cost overruns.
We see projects that were delayed to
2009-10 instead of starting in 2007-08,
which is due to an overheated market
and scarcity of skilled workers.” ✦

Oil at center
of Iraqi ﬂaps

I

n US congressional hearings last
week, Iraq’s central government
was accused of reverting to its old
ways, with control of the country’s
oil reserves a mainstay of that effort.
That’s what the people in Kurdistan
think, too.
Nechirvan Barzani, prime minister
of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq, is clearly not the least
bit happy about the efforts of Iraq’s
central government to control the
country’s oil—especially that of
Kurdistan.
“This August, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) of Iraq
passed an oil and gas law to regulate
the oil sector in our region,” Barzani
recently wrote. “So far,” he said, “we
have signed eight production-sharing contracts with international oil
and gas companies. We expect to sign
another two in the near future.”

al-Radhi, an Iraqi judge who led
the US-established Commission on
Public Integrity, said—among other
things—that oil revenues were helping to finance militias in the country.

Rocket attacks

Also consider al-Radhi’s observations that Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri
al-Maliki had protected relatives
involved in corruption and allowed
ministers to protect their employees
from investigation.
According to al-Radhi, 31 of his
employees and 12 of their family
members were assassinated, including one investigator and his pregnant

The oil sands of Alberta are undergoing an investment boom worth more than
$100 billion. From 2007 to 2016, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board
(EUB) projects total real investment in Alberta’s oil sands (surface mining,
upgrading, in situ, and support services to reach Canadian $118 billion.
Output from oil sands is set to rise from about 1.2 million barrels a day to
an expected 3 million b/d by 2016, and perhaps 4 million plus by 2020.
That could make Canada the world’s fourth-biggest oil producer after Saudi
Arabia, Russia and the United States.
Today’s oil pricing levels have made extraction of oil from oil sands much
more attractive than in the past. The reserves in Alberta will support
production for a least the next century. Canada is the new frontier in nonOPEC oil developments.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your expertise to a powerful, inﬂuential
audience. Join PennWell Petroleum Events in this second year conference and
exhibition. As the boom continues, share your ideas, experiences, technology,
and expertise with major industry players who must react quickly to the rapid
expansion. Plan to present a technical paper at the the second annual Oil Sands
and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition, July 15 – 17, 2008, at
the Calgary TELUS Convention Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

WEB SERVICES
TO SOA—2

& DEVE

In the first part of this article, we
provided an overview of the value BP
will derive from a broad service-oriented architecture (SOA) program as well
as the issues that exist today in realizing
this desire (OGJ, Oct. 8, 2007, p. 38).
Part 1 outlined an SOA maturity
model that BP has developed to support a clear roadmap for adopting and
deploying an SOA-based approach at
scale across the
organization.
This model was
presented as
an actionable,
vendor-independent approach to
delivering immediate value from SOA while recognizing
that this is a long-term journey.
BP defines SOA as a transformational
approach to the design, implementation, and management of business
solutions and their supporting technical infrastructures. SOA is a method of
delivering business solutions through
services (capabilities) that are linked together by business logic. This approach
reflects how a business actually operates
compared to conventional application
development methods.
This second and final part discusses
the details of that maturity model and
the explicit deliverables—including
standards, tools, and infrastructure—
that are needed to deliver the value BP

believes can be realized at each incremental level of the model.

Deﬁning SOA maturity
The following section describes each
of BP’s SOA maturity levels in sequence,
along with associated standards,
management processes, and business
benefits.
While this article provides an overview of the five maturity levels, more
explicit details, best practices, and
recommendations for internal use are
embedded in a proprietary set of documents, which we will identify for each
level. Each IT group and company must
create these to fit its particular needs
and circumstances.
Additionally, we provide a checklist
of documents that must not be overlooked if an organization expects to
realize the full value of SOA.

Level 1: Initial

At this level—where all IT organizations begin—no SOA or web service
standards or products exist either for
individual projects, a business unit, or
the enterprise.
There is, in fact, no common environment for developing, deploying, or
maintaining business solutions. Common services are not yet defined. Data
at this level are not often shared, even
within a single business unit. Few, if
any, data or architectural
standards exist, makL EVEL ONE INTEGRATION*

thing and the wheel is reinvented several times through the enterprise.
This is not to say that Level One IT
projects fail to deliver any real value.
They do. However, benefits tend to be
localized, and little cross-project value
or reuse of technology occurs (Fig. 6)
Success depends largely on having
a seasoned technical architect and a
capable software development team,
rather than any structured organizational competence. While an overall
portfolio management process may be
available to optimize sanctioned applications, there is scant guidance around
implementation.
It is, of course, at Level One that an
IT organization realizes the need for
SOA and web services and begins to
move in that direction. However, no
formal SOA work occurs at this point.
Most of the heavy lifting will take place
in Levels Two and Three.

Level 2: Managed services
At Level Two, where many IT organizations are today, basic web service
standards are being established for the
first time.
By the end of this phase, web
services will be the preferred method
for all projects in the organization to
connect all applications and-or services.
In effect, projects will have to request a
formal exception if they wish to do it
any other way.
During Level Two, therefore, considerable time is spent building or otherwise acquiring common business func-

tions intended for reuse. These include
not only specific business and technical
functions but generic services required
by all applications, such as security.
It would be highly inefficient for every project to continue writing code for
user authorization and access, as they
do today. It’s best to do it once and do it
rigorously for the whole organization.
Security services may be among the
most challenging technical hurdles at
this level, but the value in getting them
right is enormous. With potentially
thousands of employees, contractors,
and partners to keep track of day-byday, no company can treat SOA security
as an afterthought.
Legacy applications can also be
elevated from Level One to Level Two
by wrapping their core functions
with standard web service interfaces.
Ultimately, as the library of discrete
services grows, projects will favor reuse
of existing components before building new ones, off-the-shelf services
will take precedence over custom-built
services, and application vendors who
provide native services will be preferred
over those who do not. To find reusable
components, project teams will refer to
a central catalog where all services must
be registered. Initially, this may be little
more than a web page on the corporate
intranet identifying what the service is,
what it does, and who maintains it.
Divergent data models still exist at
this level, but services that show the
greatest potential of being reused across
the organization should be aligned with

key data models by the IT team.
It is recognized that not all services
created at Level Two will necessarily be
adopted by other projects or business
units. However, the service development
process is disciplined enough and sufficient web service standards are available
to enable adequate interoperability, both
internally and with external partners.
For some period of time—perhaps
several years—an organization could
remain at Level Two as past IT initiatives
continue untouched, new services are
under construction, and new projects
slowly begin adopting them (Fig. 7)
To efficiently manage Level Two
activities and encourage a culture of
reuse, basic IT metrics on the cost of
building services and amount of reuse
among projects must be tracked and reported centrally. In addition, a comprehensive set of documents that capture
SOA policies, standards, and governance
processes must be created. General
documents intended for internal SOA
marketing and training should include:
1. SOA overview presentation—provides a reasonably technical introduction to web services and the SOA vision
for IT professionals.
2. Maturity Level Two training
pack—includes overview presentations
and related “deep-dive” documentation
on Level Two.
In terms of process-related documents, the SOA Maturity Model itself
(whether the one presented in this
article or another version) is required to
facilitate the transition to Level Two. It

should include a definition of SOA maturity levels, as well as the criteria used
to assess the maturity of any given IT
initiative. Other SOA process documents
we’ve identified include the following:
1. Service life-cycle management—
describes the entire process of creating
services, from conception to delivery,
including requirements planning, design, development, testing, deployment,
and documentation.
2. Operational support plan—describes the handover-to-support process
as well as the standard process of supporting individual services.
3. SOA governance framework and
policies—defines the management
structures required to ensure that SOA
architectural decisions will actually get
implemented.
Important technical SOA documents,
which contain more details than the
above, should include:
1. SOA architectural principles—
outlines a high-level set of principles
and “beliefs” within which the entire
SOA concept and architecture operates.
2. SOA architectural decisions—lists
the key architectural decisions that have
been made and the reasoning behind
each one, for future reference.
3. SOA standards and guidelines—
identifies detailed technical standards
for the development and deployment
of services and web services in the
organization.
4. SOA development tools—contains guidance and recommendations
on best-practice usage of commercial

service development technology; in
general, the development environment
should be chosen based on the most
appropriate solution for a company’s
specific issues; the only mandated
“tool” required at Level Two is a common service catalogue that complies
with standards.
5. Interim security model—describes the interim security model to
be used until an enterprise security
framework is established.
6. Interim scalability and SLA
model—describes the interim scalability model and how service level agreements (SLAs) will be managed and met.
As the foundations of the SOA are
put in place at Level Two, a number of
benefits can be expected. The use of basic integration standards and a cohesive
architectural framework will accelerate
the evaluation, design, and execution of
internal and external solutions. Availability of a small number of common
services will begin to reduce both the
costs and time involved in deploying
applications, significantly in at least a
few cases. Establishing an organizational
approach to SOA will help educate key
IT and business stakeholders, as well as
primary IT vendors, on the company’s
plans and processes for pursuing the
SOA vision. The organization is now
starting to think strategically rather than
around the tactical, disjointed projects
of Level One.
Shared services developed at maturity Level Two will form the essential
basis for Level Three process orchestra-

tion and all subsequent SOA-related
benefits.

Level 3: Process orchestration
At Level Three, the primary activity
is the formal “orchestration” of broad
business processes based on a pool of
fine-grained services rather than the
writing of code as in Levels One and
Two.
This means the organization must
have begun modeling current processes
that span multiple areas of the business, decomposing those processes
into discrete activities, mapping those
to available services, and managing
services with a common drag-and-drop
orchestration tool.
At this level, a broad range of standards and definitions exists for implementing SOA and consuming reusable
services across projects. A more formal
services registry has been implemented,
providing a single source of information on all available services.
Although new services continue to
be introduced and some are not intended for broader use, the focus is on
increasing the amount of sharing and
reuse among as many different programs as possible.
To ensure integration in critical business areas, a small number of common
data models exist—either industry
standard models, or at least major data
models used by other projects. However, no standard for all possible data
types is available at this point.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition
PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

at this level include the spread of web
services as the preferred integration
technology, the number of key business
processes being modeled and executed
in the orchestration environment, and
estimated cost savings generated by
service reuse.
SOA solutions at this level enable much greater business agility. In
different regions or business units,
even when a relatively similar overall
process is called for, unique operating
conditions may require flexibility in IT
implementation. Even if the same component services are involved, they may
need to be orchestrated differently.
Once it has reached Level Three,
an organization can rapidly “rewire”
existing services used in a particular
business process, without necessarily
buying or building any new technology.
Services can be upgraded or replaced
entirely without any noticeable impact
on the process, because the user’s interface remains unaltered (Fig. 8).
As we noted earlier, Level Three is
still a good state for most large companies, including BP. We have a few advanced IT projects dabbling with Level
Three capabilities, but at present there
are still too few services available to
orchestrate a complete business process.
By the end of this year, we expected
to have sufficient services completed
to begin orchestration of a few critical
processes in E&P.
The SOA Maturity Model currently
includes all documents we have completed for Level Two. However, docu40

ments for Levels Three through Five are
still in development. We have identified
seven standards that appear critical to
successful implementation of Level
Three:
1. Process modeling tool standard—
defines the standard for exchanging
models and identifying compliant
tools that enable process modeling and
creation of executable business process
definitions.
2. Orchestration tool standard—
identifies a commercial product and
defines usage guidelines for executing
business process models at runtime.
3. Data model standard—defines the
standard for exchanging models and
identifying compliant tools for capturing and extending existing data models,
or proposing new models.
4. Intranet portal standards—identifies a specific product and defines usage
guidelines for the implementation of an
intranet portal.
5. Web services gateway standard—
identifies a product and defines usage
guidelines for a service gateway that
mediates services between providers
and consumers.
6. Services registry standard—identifies a product and defines usage guidelines for a central repository of service
information.
7. Publish/subscribe standard—
identifies a product and defines usage
guidelines for an environment that allows publish/subscribe connectivity.
In addition to the above standards,
Level Three requires two, more detailed

technical documents, to update Level
Two documentation with new information:
1. Extended SOA standards and
guidelines—incrementally extends the
allowable definition of a service where
new SOA industry standards become
available for implementation.
2. Enhanced security model—updates the maturity model to incorporate
the enterprise SOA security model,
framework, and patterns.
Finally, an SOA test bed or “sand
box” must be provided—a preconfigured environment (target platforms)
equipped with the standard tools listed
above, enabling projects to test new
composite business applications and
services.
Maturity Level Three further boosts
business agility through more extensive
reuse and better integration of services across the organizational project
portfolio. Greater reuse of common
components and interoperability standards enables the company to deploy or
rewire business solutions more quickly,
at lower costs.
Business processes are no longer
“hidden” inside big, monolithic applications, thereby supporting greater
awareness and ownership of processes
by the operating units. With greater
knowledge, they can begin to analyze,
automate, and optimize processes more
intelligently and responsively than the
long, costly IT initiatives of the past.

Level 4: Quantitatively
managed
In moving to Levels Four and Five,
it’s important to reiterate that significant
areas of maturity remain unidentified.
Nevertheless, we have sought to
avoid the kind of arm-waving statements that are common at higher levels
of transformational change programs,
such as “everything just gets better,
faster, and cheaper.”
While many details may be uncertain
at present and subject to revision, the
purpose and value of each higher level
is not fuzzy at all.
For the most part, by the time an
organization reaches Level Four few
basic enterprise-level services will be
missing and orchestration will be well
understood (Fig. 9).
Also, the message semantics (based
on XML industry standards) for service/
data interchange will be fully defined
and governed. Services intended only
for local use will be rare, and the introduction of new services will be seen as
“adding to the pool” or “extending the
portfolio” rather than creating independent work.
Industry-wide—or at least consistent
vertical segment-wide—data models
will be available for most sectors of
the business. Because external partners and suppliers have access to the
same models, data can be shared more
transparently than at any previous level
of maturity.
At Level Three, metrics were focused
largely on IT processes associated with

the spread of reusable services across
projects and business processes. The
organization was still putting critical
pieces in place, and learning how to use
them.
The primary shift at Level Four is
starting rigorous quantitative measurement of the effectiveness of business
processes now being orchestrated
within the SOA environment. Quantitative targets, therefore, are set for cost,
quality, and performance both of the
business processes themselves and of
the services supporting them. These
goals are determined by the needs of
the business users, those who implement the processes, and the organization.
Quality and performance are understood in statistical terms, monitored,
and managed throughout their life
span—a practice currently known as
business activity monitoring (BAM).
The idea is to benchmark now well
processes are functioning, identify significant causes of process variation, and
seek to rectify them, where appropriate, to ensure repeatability and prevent
future issues.
At Level Five, all this quantitative
feedback on current processes will act
as a baseline for greater automation and
process optimization.
The only new technology considered
essential to success at Level Four is some
type of BAM tool. Organizations will
only need to create a small number of
SOA documents at this stage:

2. Industry data standards—identifies multiple vertical industry standards
that will be adopted, along with gaps
in existing data models that need to
be filled (known examples for the
upstream energy industry include
WITSML, PRODML, and PIDEX—all
XML-based standards for data exchange
in specific areas).
Monitoring the benchmarking of
business process efficiency at Level
Four will enable rapid identification of
opportunities for improvement. Then
processes can be quickly reconfigured
using new or reusable services, and resulting enhancements can be compared
with a known baseline. With pervasive
common services and supporting data
standards, information from diverse
locations throughout the organization
can be located, aggregated, reported,
shared (internally and externally), and
analyzed with ease and efficiency.

Level 5: Optimized
Here we reach the summit of the
SOA vision.
By this point, it may seem there
is almost nothing left to accomplish.
Nevertheless, at this maturity level,
considerable added value will be created
through continuous process improvements—both incremental and innovative. Primary activities revolve around

traditional IT approaches to a truly
virtualized company where the optimized business processes seamlessly

All resulting changes will be measured and compared with objectives.
Broad transformation of existing business models will take place through this
ability to monitor, evaluate, and reconfigure processes “on the fly” (Fig. 10).
At Level Five, detailed external security standards and services will enable
complex, seamless integration of the

other hand, it could go ahead and build
proprietary services in-house, but some
or all of them will have to be torn out
when standards become available.
What’s more, if a corporation’s
major IT vendors, vertical application
developers, and business partners are
not embracing SOA as well, everyone
could be held back. No one can do this
alone.
It behooves every IT organization,
therefore, to launch a coordinated SOA
program, accelerate its move from Level
One to Level Two, and to inform all of
its partners and suppliers of its commitment to the vision. In addition, it will
benefit all of us to work together, across
traditional organization and industry
lines, to develop, test, and establish
solid SOA standards.
As we noted above, SOA is not a
natural evolution of current practices
or environments. It is a totally new and
revolutionary way of creating business
solutions and optimizing business processes. Only with widespread cooperation among forward-thinking global
businesses will we begin to realize the
full promise and potential of SOA.

The sharp recent
rise in well drilling and
particularly well stimulation costs has led to the
concern that much of the
US unconventional gas
Production
resource may be becoming uneconomic.
Similar concerns about economic
viability have existed since the initial
pursuit of this resource, sometimes
rightly so. However, by pursuing improvement in the unconventional gas
knowledge base and its recovery technology (using industry-government
partnerships), in our view, the industry
will be able to maintain the economic
viability of this large, often marginally
productive resource.
Past reservoir characterization methods and traditional means of linking a
wellbore to the low-permeability unconventional gas reservoir are no longer
sufficient. As such, the discussion of the
economic viability of unconventional
gas is as much a story of technological
advance and the pursuit of efficiency, as
introduced in the third (OGJ, Sept. 24,
2007, p. 48) and fourth articles (OGJ,
Oct. 1, 2007, p. 46) in this series, as it
is a story of costs, financial risks, and
wellhead prices.
Even though the overall economic
trends for unconventional gas are currently unfavorable, with finding and

O D U C T I O N

development costs rising faster than
wellhead prices, examples of economic
success nonetheless exist.
This fifth article in the series presents
a number of examples of how selected
companies, with diligent pursuit of
knowledge and technology, have converted previously judged uneconomic
unconventional gas plays into economically viable prospects. In addition,
potential actions can
help maintain the future economic viability of US unconventional gas, although
several challenges on
the horizon could
influence the future
economics of this resource.

If sharp increases in well drilling and
completion costs continue, they will
harm the economic viability of unconventional gas.
So far, oil field service companies have been able to increase prices
charged for services and products because of increases in natural gas prices
and the subsequent boom in unconventional gas development.
For example, rig rates quoted at
$12,000/day several years ago are now
routinely at $18,000-20,000/day or

Some emerging unconventional gas plays in the
US also exhibit attractive
economics (Table 2).
According to Chesapeake Energy
Corp., the Deep Bossier tight gas play
in East Texas has an average $10 million
well cost and a 5 bcf/well (gross) average estimated ultimate recovery (EUR).
At a $6.30/Mcf realized wellhead gas
price, the play provides very attractive
returns that should improve as drilling
costs decline.
The Woodford gas shale in Southeast
Oklahoma can provide RORs of 1825%, assuming a $4.3 million well cost,
2.2 bcf/well gross EUR, and a $6.30/
Mcf realized gas price, also according to
Chesapeake Energy.
More speculative are the economics

for the emerging deep Dakota-EntradaNavajo tight gas play in the Uinta basin.
The initial well costs range from $9 to
10 million for a 15,000-ft well. With
expectations of obtaining 5-6 bcf/well
EURs, however, the economics appear
viable, especially if well costs decline.
The initial discovery well in this play
tested at more than 11 MMcfd (gross)
in the Dakota, Entrada, and Navajo
formations, followed by wells tested at
6-10 MMcfd (gross) in the Navajo formation, supporting a favorable outlook
for this new gas play.

EnCana’s experience illustrates the
next phase in the pursuit of efficiency
and costs savings in well drilling and
completion. As the gains in drilling
efficiencies with conventional rigs
began to diminish, EnCana contracted
for fit-for-purpose rigs and equipment
that enabled it to reduce further drilling days for its Rocky Mountain gas
prosepcts to about 30 days/well from
more than 40 days/well. With experience, EnCana expects additional gains

faces potential barriers, such as land use
and environmental concerns, access to
federal lands, and prudent management
of produced water. At the same time,
these barriers provide opportunities for
innovative, forward-thinking firms.
Access and land-use policies on
federal lands continue to pose formidable constraints on unconventional
gas development. For example, for the
remaining unconventional gas resource
not yet developed in the Lower 48
states, about 15% is inaccessible, while
another 64% is accessible but only
under conditions more restrictive than
standard lease terms.2
Some firms, however, are working
collaboratively with government agencies to develop innovative “win-win”
strategies to address seasonal restrictions in exchange for enacting more environmentally friendly drilling practices. For example, Questar Corp., a Rocky
Mountain-based natural gas production
and pipeline company, faced heavy
restrictions on its lease in the Pinedale
anticline of Wyoming. In response, the
firm used information gathered through
an extensive outreach program with
local organizations and government
officials to develop a plan whereby it
could perform year-round drilling on
previously seasonally restricted portions
of its lease.
In exchange for the exception, the
firm proposed to make investments
that would reduce its environmental
footprint, such as directionally drilling
multiple wells from a single well pad
and piping gas to central compression
facilities instead of using tanker trucks.
In 2005, the Wyoming Bureau of
Land Management approved the plan,
giving Questar rights to drill yearround, including through the previously restricted winter months. Questar
reports that these modifications will
eliminate the need for an extra 89 well
pads and 25,000 annual tanker truck
trips.3
An increasingly visible and contentious issue is coalbed methane (CBM)
produced water management. An indepth US Department of Energy study
50

O D U C T I O N

demonstrated that the cost to treat
produced water from coalbed methane
operations could impact severely the
economics of recovering natural gas.4
Depending on the regulatory requirements and management options
used, capital costs for CBM-produced
water management could range from as
little as $1,500 to as much as $72,300/
well.
In response to the barriers posed by
managing produced water, Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. implemented an innovative solution that creates synergies
between its CBM and oil production
investments.
The firm has recently completed
a 48 mile, 24-in. Powder River basin
pipeline to transport 400,000-450,000
bw/d produced from its CBM wells to
the Madison aquifer at Salt Creek.
This pipeline will reduce greatly the
water handling expenses for Anadarko,
and establish a predictable cost structure
for future water handling costs, reducing the risk in existing and future CBM
development projects in the region.
Additionally, the water injected into
this reservoir will provide an affordable
source of water for enhanced oil recovery at the firm’s nearby oil fields. Companies had depleted this low-cost Salt
Creek reservoir water source through
past waterflood and EOR activity.
Another example of turning a barrier
into an opportunity is to use coal seams
for value-added CO2 storage. Coals are
often near large point sources of CO2
emissions, especially power plants. In
addition, the injection of CO2 into coal
seams can enhance the recovery of
methane (enhanced coal bed methane,
or ECBM) from coal seams, although
the technology is still relatively new.
Nonetheless, ARI analyses have
shown that CO2-ECBM can be economic with today’s gas prices across a
broad range of geologic environments,
although substantial research and demonstration projects are still needed to
push its application.

Economic viability
The economic viability of US un-

conventional gas resources remains in
a precarious balance. Though drilling
and completion costs are likely to level
off and be partially offset by advances
in technology, the economic viability of
unconventional gas is at the mercy of
service, raw material, and environmental management costs, all of which are
increasing.
To remain a viable source of energy
into the future, the unconventional gas
industry as a whole will need to continue to build on the successes mentioned
in this article by promoting greater
cooperation between industry and
government, by accelerating the pace of
technological progress, and by tirelessly
promoting efficiency and innovation in
its field applications.

Shell has revitalized its “Technical
Limit” program in well delivery and
well servicing activities. Early positive
results have prompted the company to
extend the program to additional assets
in 2007 (Fig. 1).
The concept of technical limit (TL)
arose in the late 1990s and quickly
spread across the industry.1 Led by
Shell’s technical-limit drilling approach,
TL got well engineers to work toward
a “perfect world” execution of their
operations by removing lost time and
adopting innovative practices.2 3
Shell achieved global success with
the program, which eventually became
known as “Drilling the Limit” (DtL).1
Driven by a team of performance
consultants supporting a global project base, many projects achieved step
changes vs. historical performance levels. In retrospect, however, uptake was

patchy and the performance was not
sustained in some areas.

Top quartile challenge
By 2004, achieving industry topquartile performance became a priority
for Shell. The goal was to translate this
strategy into a practical program to
apply globally. Workers within the company’s Wells discipline (Wells) felt that
the response should be to revitalize DtL
rather than to create a completely new
performance initiative. Shell selected
this revitalization approach, “rDTL,” for
two reasons:
• DtL had been successful in many
areas and clearly contained many of the
necessary elements for success.
• The DtL name and brand were
already familiar, reducing “initiative
fatigue” in the organization.
The approach needed to be broadened and adapted, however, to cover
aspects of performance that

had not been
addressed before
and also to imitate
operating units
where DtL had
been successful. To
some, an environment for performance comes
naturally; rDTL
aimed to offer a
framework for all
projects on how
to create such an
environment.

performance staircase, which links

of the staircase—technical, commercial, or process improvements—form
the core of the team’s preparation for
the year, creating focus and structure,
and allowing the team to work only on
activities that will have a major impact.
In its drilling and completion activities,
the Pinedale team used the staircases to
focus the team’s activities and to ensure
that performance targets were based on
facts, not aspirations.
The Pinedale team also developed a
program of clear, simple, performancebased incentives with staff and key contractors. These incentives—all related to
bottom-line delivery of the three key
performance indicators—were replicated by several other rig teams.
In the spirit of continuous improvement, the Pinedale team further tested
themselves in early 2007. Looking for
new improvement opportunities, the
team brokered a performance-benchmarking project with all of its local
competitors.
In the study, the teams shared performance data, which further strengthened the Pinedale team’s belief that its
current performance and future targets
were systematically outperforming the
competition. Shell wells at Pinedale are
top quartile, drilling costs are significantly lower than competitors, and
days/1,000 ft drilled are significantly
better than competitors.

Asia—Sarawak gas
In Asia, the big-bore gas wells of
the Sarawak gas program (Fig. 2) will
deliver 25% of LNG imports in Japan
and Korea, and 20% of Shell’s Asian
production. It was therefore critical that
the team achieve promised production
levels at competitive cost.
In contrast to some other projects,
the Sarawak Gas team did not apply
dedicated performance staff to support
its campaign, opting for performance to
be a team responsibility.
Clarity of targets was considered vital
to the team’s success and, consequently,
54

the team’s performance objectives were
rolled up into a drive for the “21-day
well.” The results were impressive, with
$/ft and UDC both coming in at less
than 70% of the project baseline. The
team had the company’s highest performance vs. project baseline for the year.

Lessons for industry
These case studies demonstrate the
variety of approaches that can be taken
to achieve high performance. Shell’s experience has taught its rDTL team three
unbreakable rules:
1. Set unambiguous targets tested
against external performance markers, and hold people accountable for
delivery.
2. Relentlessly communicate learning and success.
3. Ensure that facts and results are
easily available to ensure high-quality
discussions and avoid debate around the
numbers.

rDTL’s future
Based on its success in 2006, the
rDTL program for well delivery is being
expanded to a new wave of projects.
The program has been extended to
support Shell’s well-servicing activities.
In this new avenue, the best learning
from the well-delivery program has
been adopted, and in partnership with
asset production teams, well-services
teams are well on track to achieve top
quartile in Wells. ✦

policy factors that have
played a large role in the
US motor fuels market,
Refining
and quantifies future
outcomes based on a
range of possible economic and policy
conditions. These include aggressive
pursuit of biofuels programs, increases
in Corporate Average Fuel
Economy (CAFE) standards,
dieselization of US motor
fuels, and the pricing of
carbon emissions.
Part 1 of this two-part
series, last week (OGJ, Oct.
8, 2007, p. 66), developed
a forecast for diesel and gasoline demand in the US based on economic factors. This week, the concluding article
will examine the factors that influence
US motor fuel demand to draw a picture of what is likely to happen over the
next decade.
Our findings suggest there will
be substantial effects on the gasoline
market, but fairly small effects on the
diesel market. The US administration’s
program to decrease gasoline demand
20% in 10 years is unlikely to reach that
goal, but pursuit of biofuels and higher
CAFE standards still could substantially reduce historic gasoline demand
growth. Continued economic growth
should stimulate diesel demand, though
constraints on carbon may temper its
rate of growth.
Ordinarily, rising fuel demand would
elicit additions to US refining capacity.
Proposals, however, to control refined
product prices and other measures to
intervene in open fuel markets, or the
imposition of special taxes on refiners,
are likely to discourage such investment. Furthermore, efforts to mandate
biofuels as a substitute for petroleumbased motor fuels create a new level of
uncertainty in the downstream petroleum market.
Government policy is inherently
unpredictable and current mandates
may not be in place in the future. Some
mandates are likely to have unintended

consequences not yet fully understood.
As a result, refiners face more rather
than less risk in making decisions on
how much capacity to add during the
next 10 years.
We see a contradiction between the
current market and recent policy proposals: market forces imply a need for
more domestic refining capacity, while
legislative and policy initiatives discourage it.
We chose a 10-year time span
because beyond that the picture is less
clear. Fuel prices, the state of technology, and policy all might be very different from today—projections beyond
10 years are highly uncertain. Still, a
10-year perspective can tell us a good
deal about what the state of the world
might look like by 2017.

President Bush’s plan to reduce US
gasoline demand 20% by 2017 is based
on two approaches:
• An aggressive effort to substitute
biofuels for gasoline (15% reduction).
• A 4%/year increase in the fuel
economy of new light vehicles sold in
the US (5% reduction).
If the market otherwise would have
grown 13% as projected by the US
Energy Information Administration, to
158 billion gal/year (10.4 million b/d)
in 2017 from 140 billion gal/year (9.1
million b/d) in 2006, biofuels would
replace 24 billion gal and rising fuel
economy standards would conserve
another 8 billion.
How realistic is this? Most of the
biofuel contribution would have to
come from ethanol. Biodiesel will
reduce diesel demand somewhat, but
US biodiesel production is projected to
increase to only 650 million gallons by
2015.1 If diesel demand grows 15-20%
between now and then, this would be
only a little over 1% of the total market.
Ethanol is currently made almost
exclusively from corn and that is not
likely to change dramatically in the next
10 years.
In the long term, ethanol from cellulose may make an important contriOil & Gas Journal / Oct. 15, 2007

bution to supply. The US Department
of Energy has offered $385 million in
grants to build plants capable of supplying ethanol from cellulosic sources.
At least three technical hurdles must be
overcome at production scale, however.
The cellulosic portion of the feedstock
must be isolated, the cellulose must be
enzymatically degraded into sugars, and
those sugars need to be fermented to
turn them into ethanol.
Different cellulosic sources require
somewhat different processes, further complicating the situation. DOE’s
National Renewable Energy Laboratory
has set a goal of cutting the cost of
cellulosic ethanol by 50% over 5 years,
which would make it competitive economically. The steps to do so, however,
are likely to take longer than that and
it appears unlikely that this technology
will produce large quantities of fuel
within 10 years.
In 2006, 23% of US corn production of somewhat less than 10 billion
bushels was devoted to the fuels market,
yielding about 5.3 billion gal. More
acreage will be devoted to corn in 2007
and higher yields per acre may be possible.
The processing capacity exists or is
under construction to produce as much
as 12 billion gal/year of ethanol by
2009. This could consume 1⁄3 of the US
corn crop, however, with consequent
effects on food markets. Furthermore,
because ethanol has only 67% of the
energy content per gallon as gasoline,
this is only 8 billion gal in gasoline
equivalent. That is but 1⁄3 the 2017 goal.
Presumably, land that is now used
for other crops could be replanted
with corn to provide feedstock for
the fuels market. That would reduce
pressure on the corn market but would
raise prices of other agricultural commodities. Also, some land now held in
reserve might be released to increase
aggregate corn production. But some
of that land is unsuitable for corn and
yield on other such acreage is likely to
be low. Production devoted to the fuels
market could yield 15 billion gal by
2017, but even this would replace only

10 billion gal of gasoline.
DOE’s Office of the Biomass Program
projects 2017 ranges for corn-based
and cellulosic ethanol of 12.5-15.0 billion gal/year and 2-5 billion gal/year,
respectively. Combined, this is 14.520.0 billion gal/year. The lower end of
this range, mainly from corn ethanol,
seems more likely.
It is clear that US corn-based ethanol
cannot replace 24 billion gal of gasoline
by 2017.
Another option is to relax import
barriers to ethanol in order to induce
greater supplies from around the world.
To date, however, domestic producers
have successfully opposed such relaxation and, in any case, such a program
would merely replace one form of
imported fuel with another.
In all likelihood, US-produced
ethanol will slow growth in demand
for gasoline but not prevent it. Even
if that growth is no greater than DOE
projects and 15 billion gal of ethanol
are supplied by 2017 (equal to about
650,000 b/d of gasoline), ethanol will
replace only a little more than half the
projected growth amount (10 billion
out of 18 billion gallons).

Tightened CAFE standards
Many studies have examined prospects for raising the average fuel economy of US vehicles. For example, the

2017

National Academy of Sciences in 2002
and Energy and Environmental Analysis
Inc. in 2006 identified technologies
already in commercial use that could
increase fuel economy throughout the
fleet. These include rolling resistance
reduction, improved lube oils, weight
reduction, engine friction reduction,
and alternator improvements.
An analysis conducted at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory found that at gasoline prices between $2/gal and $3/gal,
increased light vehicle fuel economy of
30-50% will more than pay for itself.2
Other vehicle technologies also may
contribute to increased fuel economy
during the next 5-10 years. These
include homogeneous charge compression ignition and hybrid electric
vehicles, including plug-in hybrids with
advanced batteries; but the contributions of these technologies will likely be
limited during this time period.
Proposals have been made to raise US
CAFE standards as a means to increase
light vehicle fuel efficiency. For example, Senators Richard Lugar (R-Ind.)
and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) have introduced the “National Fuel Initiative,”
which would mesh light trucks with
autos and increase the overall CAFE
standard by 4%/year. For our analysis,
we initially assume that during 200817, average annual mileage among the
US light vehicle fleet will increase by

that number.
Each year, new vehicles comprise
about 7% of the vehicle fleet. The retirement rate is only about 4.5%; therefore,
the vehicle fleet is expanding. Our first
assumption is that 7% of the fleet turns
over every year, with no net gain.
Currently, light vehicles average 21
mpg.3 In 2008, therefore, the 7% of
new vehicles would average 1.04 x 21
or 21.8 mpg. The 2009 new vehicles
would average 22.7 mpg, and so on. Because new light vehicles make up only
7% of the fleet, the average increase in
mpg from the first year increment is
only 0.07 x 0.04 = 0.0028 or 0.28%.
In the second year, the percentage gain
would be from a slightly higher mpg
base. By the 10th year, new vehicles
would average 21 x 1.0410 raised to
the 10th power or about 31.1 mpg.
Given these assumptions, the 2017
fleet would consist of 10 years of
vehicles averaging 26.2 mpg (assumed
to be 70% of the fleet) and another 3
years averaging 21 (30%). Fleet average
fuel economy would be 24.6 mpg, a
gain of 17%. A vehicle traveling 13,000
miles/year, the average in the US,
would consume 528 gal of gasoline
rather than 619 gal, a savings of 15%.
This arithmetic suggests that growth in
gasoline demand would be significantly
affected.
The actual gain in fuel economy,
58

however, between 2008 and 2017 from
increasing CAFE standards by 4%/year
is likely to be considerably less. First,
the 2008 and 2009 models already are
past the design stage; a new program
probably would not be implemented
until the 2010 model year.
This would reduce the average mileage of new vehicles sold between 2008
and 2017 to 24.3 mpg, and the overall
fleet average to 23.3 mpg. Of course,
if CAFE standards continue to increase
past 2017, the effects would continue
to grow.
Automakers receive credit towards
CAFE goals by marketing flexible fuel
vehicles—vehicles that can use alternative fuels such as ethanol or methanol
as well as gasoline. The credit allows
each manufacturer to increase the calculated CAFE value of its fleet by up to 0.9
mpg. Almost all of today’s flexible fuel
vehicles, however, use gasoline. Their
production has little effect on demand.
If 0.9 is deducted from 24.3, new
vehicles would average 23.4 mpg and
the fleet average would be 22.7 mpg. A
vehicle traveling 13,000 miles would
consume 573 gal rather than 619 gal,
a fuel economy gain of about 7.4%.
Demand for gasoline would be reduced
by about 775,000 b/d.
Other factors would reduce the effect
of increased CAFE standards further.
Better gas mileage means a lower cost

of travel, which will induce people to
drive more. This “rebound effect” is
estimated to be about 20%. The average
gain in fuel economy in new vehicles is
effectively reduced by 0.5 mpg, to 22.9
mpg.
In reality, the light vehicle fleet
will likely continue to expand by a
few million vehicles every year. If this
occurs mainly through old vehicles
lasting longer—in contrast to extra new
vehicles being sold—then new vehicles
will comprise less than 70% of the total
in 2017, and closer to 60%. In that case,
raising CAFE standards by 4%/year for
new light vehicles between 2010 and
2017 would result in fleet average fuel
economy of about 22.1 mpg and a
reduction in gasoline demand of about
550,000 b/d.
Fig. 1 shows the effects on gasoline
demand if a biofuels program yielding 15 billion gal in 2017 is combined
with a program to increase CAFE 4%/
year for the light vehicle fleet. Assuming
a base case growth rate of 15% between
2007 and 2017, to 10.7 million b/d
from 9.3 million b/d, biofuels would
reduce demand by 650,000 b/d and
CAFE standards by another 550,000
b/d. The two together would reduce
demand by around 1.2 million b/d, to
about 9.5 million b/d.
President Bush’s goal of a 20%
reduction in gasoline demand would
be only partly met, but the combined
programs nevertheless would have a
significant effect on gasoline demand.

Dieselization
Another way to reduce US motor
fuel consumption would be a massive
transformation of the light duty vehicle
fleet from gasoline to diesel. Fewer
gallons would be needed to propel
vehicles because diesel has about 14%
more energy per volume and because it
combusts more efficiently than gasoline.
The two effects combined result in a
vehicle of given size and weight going
about 30% farther on a gallon of diesel
than on a gallon of gasoline. For given
aggregate vehicle miles traveled, therefore, about 23% less fuel is needed.

The net reduction in petroleum use
would be less, however, because more
oil is required to make diesel fuel than
gasoline. Adjustment for this factor
would reduce the net fuel efficiency
advantage of diesel over gasoline by
about 20%.
To help achieve greenhouse gas
reduction goals, European nations have
encouraged such a vehicle transformation through differential taxation of
diesel and gasoline. The policy appears
to be working. Despite diesel vehicles
being more expensive (approximately
$3,000 more for a comparable light vehicle), 50% of new cars sold in Europe
in 2005 were fueled by diesel.
The current situation favors the US
in one important respect. European
refineries are producing more gasoline
than Europe is consuming, and are
exporting about 800,000 b/d to the
world market.
Concurrently, the US is importing
more than 1 million b/d of gasoline
and gasoline components from world
refining centers. Gasoline prices in the
US would be higher if European refineries were not overproducing relative
to European demand. To some extent
in Europe, gasoline has now become
an unwanted by-product of rising
throughput to meet diesel demand.
A new policy to encourage diesel use
in the US would require US refineries
to substantially change their processing
configuration. Currently, the product
mix is heavily oriented towards gasoline, which makes up more than 50%
of production. Only a little more than
20% is diesel.
A large-scale switch from gasoline
to diesel would render past capital
investments in catalytic cracking less
valuable and would require large new
investments in hydrotreating and
hydrocracking. In the short run, such a
policy would put pressure on the diesel
market. In the longer run, increased US
diesel production capacity would relieve
that pressure, but several years would
be required and cost recovery would be
necessary.
US policy makers are indicating
60

is that elasticity of demand increases
in even increments towards intermediate term values of –0.5 for gasoline and
–0.2 for diesel (for example, elasticity of
demand for gasoline is assumed –0.05 in
2008, –0.1 in 2009, etc.).

it would not be entirely equivalent.
Without knowing the specifics of
what might be done, it is difficult to
precisely predict the future price of prospective carbon allowances, but there
is experience within the EU of carbon
allowance trading and the price ranges
that emerge.
For analytic purposes, we assume
an allowance price of $30/ton of CO2,
which roughly equates to 30¢/gal of
motor fuels. We also assumed the price
is set in 2008 and remains constant in
real terms through 2017. A base price
of $2.60/gal for both fuels is also assumed.
We assume too that gasoline demand
would rise 1.4%/year or 15% over 10
years if there were no carbon constraint;
diesel demand would rise 1.8%/year or
20% over 10 years. The final assumption
a preference for biofuels and fuel
economy measures as the core strategy
to reduce motor fuel consumption.
Although diesel offers considerable
potential for fuel savings, it appears unlikely that this alternative will be given
serious consideration currently.

China’s rapidly growing demand for clean
energy sources stands to
make it a major LNG importer in coming years.

potential.
Natural gas
currently provides only about 4% of
China’s national energy supply (as
opposed to 23% in the US).2 Yet gas
demand will grow rapidly if China’s
leadership becomes serious about
controlling pollution and summons the
will to launch price reforms in the coal,
gas, and electricity markets.
These are intertwined because gas
can supplement dirty coal as a powergeneration fuel but will only be broadly
competitive in China if coal is taxed and
electricity prices are liberalized and rise
to market levels.
This analysis examines the market and
strategic effects of increasing Chinese
LNG demand as well as the possibilities
for Chinese exploration and production,
shipping, and energy service companies
to gain footholds throughout the LNG
value chain (Table 1).
China began importing LNG in 2006
and is likely to expand its LNG imports
greatly in coming years, particularly if
Russia cannot make good on longstanding promises to build gas pipelines to
China. To date, the two sides have been

unable to agree on a price, with China
wanting prices of $100/1,000 cu m
and Russia seeking prices nearer the
$250/1,000 cu m it realizes for gas
sales to Western Europe.
China’s investment-led growth
model leads to massive demand for inexpensive baseload electricity. Here coal
will almost always prevail over gas, unless the government imposes draconian
coal taxes, carbon-emission restrictions,
or other such measures to lessen the
raw fuel price disparity. Gas will gain
from demands for generation flexibility,
because unlike coal-fired plants, gasfired combined cycle turbine plants can
rapidly adjust their output.
Gas-fired generation also stands
to benefit from growing electricity
demand in southeast Chinese cities that
are prosperous, far from coal supplies,
lie near the coast, and are battling severe pollution.

Southern China
Sinopec and PetroChina are delaying
LNG projects in northern China until
more LNG supplies become available
and the price situation improves. China
is rich in coal, making LNG uncompetitive for baseload power generation at
prices greater than $3.50/MMbtu. International LNG prices in August 2007
stood nearer $9-11/MMbtu. Japanese
and Korean consumers can afford LNG
at these prices, but relatively few Chinese consumers can. These customers
are primarily in the more prosperous
Shanghai, Fujian, and Pearl River Delta
areas.
China’s relatively prosperous and
economically dynamic Southeast will
therefore be the primary demand center. Even regional Chinese LNG demand
growth can have global market effects.
By 2015, LNG demand in southeast
China and Shanghai could exceed that
of South Korea, which is currently the
world’s No. 2 LNG consumer. Fig. 1
shows income levels in China’s southeast, where LNG terminals are being
built, vs. the rest of the country.

increased domestic gas supplies are
currently dampening Chinese LNG
demand growth. Average international
LNG prices exceed Chinese coal prices
by a factor of four and could remain
high for several years to come because
new projects can take 5 or more years
to come online.
A recent spate of domestic gas discoveries equal to more than 5 years of
imports at China’s projected 2010 demand level will reduce China’s prospective LNG demand.3 China may also see
domestic supply gains from its coalbedmethane reserves. Chinese residential
gas prices are also controlled, making
LNG largely uncompetitive at current
price levels.
Although China’s internal gas market
policies and the broad inability of
consumers to pay current international
LNG prices are curtailing demand, there
may be changes afoot. In April 2007,
Mitsui UK and CNOOC signed a framework accord on LNG spot trading. Then,
on May 10, 2007, CNOOC’s Dapeng
terminal accepted China’s first spot LNG
cargo, which came from Oman and was
purchased ex-ship from Mitsubishi.
The deal’s significance lies in the
fact that for the first time, a Chinese
local gas company was willing to pay
full international price for gas imports.
China’s Fujian and North West Shelf
LNG import contracts featured low
prices and were signed during an LNG
buyers’ market.
Part of those deals’ low prices may
also stem from energy companies
working to establish a foothold in the
potentially huge Chinese market. Yet the
spot deal combined with the fact that
China’s Ministry of Commerce recently
eliminated gas import restrictions may
signal that the Chinese government and
Chinese companies are slowly moving toward greater integration with the
international LNG market.
Greater participation by Chinese
firms in the LNG spot market could also
increase liquidity in East Asia, because
South Korea’s KOGAS uses spot trading
to help account for seasonal demand
shifts and is already a leading global

LNG spot market player.
Utilities in Southeast China also appear to be interested in LNG as a way
to meet residential and industrial gas
supply needs. Guangdong and the surrounding Pearl River Delta are economic powerhouses with some of China’s
fastest growing electricity demand. Gasfired power is competitive in these areas
because serious rail bottlenecks raise
coal delivery costs and cause supply interruptions for coal-fired power plants.
In addition, oil-fired power plants in
Guangdong are being shut down as
China struggles to restrain rapid oil demand growth.1 Finally, because it burns
cleanly, gas is also favored over oil and
coal for power generation in the badly
polluted southeast.
China Gas, one of the country’s largest pipeline gas distributors, expected to
take its first LNG shipment in September.4 The company experienced a 145%
surge in gas sales between April 2006
and March 2007 and is looking to expand its distribution operations to eight
more cities. These events may mark the
emergence of residential demand, a
new gas-demand driver independent of
electrical generation.

Asian LNG competition
Increased Chinese LNG demand will
sharpen competition for LNG supplies in East Asia, particularly because
Indonesia is looking to curtail export
volumes sharply in order to meet domestic gas needs. Growing Chinese LNG
import demands will also have geopolitical consequences. Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Iran are seen as prime
LNG sources.
The close bilateral ties between LNG
producers and consumers will also
influence China’s foreign policy. This
means that China will oppose actions
that might harm Iran’s energy development. In the case of Australia, a staunch
US ally will find itself in the diplomatically delicate position of balancing deep
strategic ties to the US and a burgeoning economic relationship with the
PRC.
Finally, LNG shipments will travel the
same sea lanes that oil imports do, posing an additional sea lane security issue
in Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean
by 2020.
As Fig. 2 shows, Southeast Asian LNG
supplies are already very important
to Japan and South Korea. Given that
the region lacks the LNG production

ficers have been at sea for more than 25
years and are nearing retirement. LNG
crewing and officer training are therefore areas where China could positively
affect the global LNG market. According
to Poten & Partners, China is building
training facilities aboard one of its newbuild LNG carriers.8

Naval expansion
China’s growing LNG imports may
fuel blue water naval expansion. In the
case of LNG sea lanes of communication security, being able militarily to
protect one’s supply lines may in fact
turn out to be far more important than
in the case of oil. LNG is physically
more difficult to handle than oil and is
not as easily tradable. LNG is still sold
primarily on the basis of long term
take-or-pay contracts, with only about
10-12% of global volumes traded as
spot cargoes. And even these spot cargoes change hands once or twice before
reaching the final end user, whereas
oil cargoes commonly pass through a
dozen or more buyers and sellers before
finally reaching the end user.
As a result, ties between LNG producers and consumers tend to be very
direct. LNG projects are typically served
by dedicated tankers that carry LNG on
one route (for example, Qatar-Japan),
and cargoes are rarely resold at sea.
From a military perspective, this
would make shipments much easier to
interdict because—in contrast with oil
cargoes—it would be relatively simple
to determine where an LNG cargo was
headed. This means that a consumer
nation has a strong motivation for possessing the capacity militarily to defend
its LNG supply lanes. LNG carriers
being built to serve Chinese terminals
are currently either Hong Kong or PRC
flagged, making it even simpler to justify using naval power to defend them
during a crisis.

Looking ahead
China’s primary source of influence on the East Asian and global LNG
markets in the next 5 years will be

supplies, particularly from Indonesia
(falling production), Malaysia, Australia,
and possibly Sakhalin. Chinese sources
express a preference for obtaining LNG
from these areas, as they are “close to
home” and shipments do not need to
pass through the Malacca Strait.
If Iran begins producing and exporting LNG, China will almost certainly take large volumes, deepening
its energy interests in Iran and possibly
sharpening tension with the West over
Iran’s nuclear program.
Insofar as specific segments of the
LNG value chain are concerned, Chinese
shipping firms will serve the Chinese
market but will face stiff international
competition from Japanese, Korean,
North American, and European shippers. China’s main contributions to
the global LNG shipping sector would
likely come from providing ship officers and crewmen, as well as building
some LNG carriers (in the 10-year time
frame). Although Chinese shipbuilders
are making great strides, more technically advanced South Korean yards will
likely capture the majority of LNG carrier orders.
CNOOC and other Chinese producing firms will seek upstream project

stakes, and their service subsidiaries
will be active in countries from which
China is obtaining LNG. As southern
and eastern Chinese power producers
increase the share of gas-fired generation, it is possible that they could seek
upstream stakes in LNG projects that
feed their plants.
Western and Japanese power producers and utilities such as Gaz de France
and Tokyo Gas now seek upstream
stakes in LNG projects to ensure supply
security for their plants and industrial
and residential consumers.
For the foreseeable future, Chinese
construction and engineering firms will
enter the LNG construction business
based on political rather than economic
advantages. In Iran, for instance, KBR
and other Western firms are effectively
shut out by US sanctions. If tensions
continue, Iran may have no choice but
to rely on Chinese firms to help it build
LNG infrastructure. China’s growing
LNG demand could exert profound
strategic and commercial effects on
the relatively undeveloped global LNG
market. Existing LNG consumers and
suppliers in East Asia will need to make
adjustments to deal with China’s rise.
As the LNG market continues to

Western Europe and North America will

true as the US becomes a top global

Crankcase fumes-disposal system for generator sets
The maker of the AIRSEP crankcase
fumes-disposal system has packaged its
systems for easy field installation on large
generator sets.
The AIRSEP system processes engine
crankcase fumes, coalesces the oil from
the fumes back to liquid, and then returns
the oil back to the engine crankcase. It also
captures the fine oil mist that can often
lead to radiator fouling, turbo or aftercooler fouling, or excessive emissions if
left unchecked, the firm notes.
The kit uses specially designed side
mount brackets that mirror the engines’
control panel brackets. This helps expedite
installation and helps ensure a uniform
package on engines.

Even the most conservative estimates
suggest that international demand for
LNG will double by 2020, and billions

of a complex industry proves that LNG
can deliver a critical link in the energy
demands of international economies.
Features and beneﬁts:
• Explanations of the technology,
including liquefaction, transportation
and regasiﬁcation
• Pending worldwide LNG projects
• Understanding the economics of the
LNG industry, including examples of
gas supply agreements, sales
contracts, and project ﬁnancing
• Shipping conventions and regulations
LNG: A Nontechnical Guide will be a

• Energy industry leaders
• Investment bankers
• Professors specializing in energy

Condensate, one of the two groups
deﬁned as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs),
is ﬁnally coming of age in world trade,
marketing, reﬁning and petrochemicals. Condensate sales are moving
from a niche marketing specialty to
a mainstream segment of crude and
products trade, and nowhere is this
more evident than in the Mideast Gulf
and Asia Paciﬁc.
This report explains how the protean
nature of condensate allows it to be
used in a wide range of sectors: as a
reﬁnery slate component; in specialized distillation towers called condensate splitters; in direct feed to ethylene crackers; in gasoline blending and
as a substitute for gas in turbine power generation. It can be deﬁned as a
base material, a blending component,
a feedstock or a boiler feed.

Oil traders know
output gains trim
a market cushion
A production increase coordinated by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries isn’t always what it appears to
be.
Much of the price response depends
on how much oil the group’s heavy hitters
can produce but don’t before the output
change.
By deﬁnition, when OPEC raises production, idle capacity falls. The latter effect can

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s

spook the market enough to offset price
moderation sought by the former.
The market needs its cushions against
supply disruptions. When those cushions
are thin, traders get nervous.
For now, one of the market’s two cushions, inventory, looks stout. The other cushion, spare capacity, looks—well, interesting.
In August, according to the International
Energy Agency, spare capacity of the 10
OPEC members other than Algeria and Iraq,
which don’t have quotas and produce as
much as they can, totaled 3.3 million b/d. A
year earlier it was 2.27 million b/d.
Against the production numbers that
yielded the recent ﬁgure, the 500,000 b/d
production increase OPEC announced Sept.
11, effective Nov. 1, would lower spare
capacity to 2.8 million b/d.
That’s still up from last year—and the 3
prior years—but is it enough?
The answer depends on how much oil
traders think the market might need in a
hurry. In 2002-03, the market lost supply in
sequential, sudden increments of 2-2.5 million b/d from Venezuela, Nigeria, and Iraq.
Spare capacity at the current level could
cover such losses. But then there’s Iran,
another place where anything can happen.
In August the Islamic Republic produced,
by IEA’s reckoning, 3.87 million b/d. Loss of
Iranian oil would make all that oil in storage
very important while it lasted.
While welcome, the past year’s growth
in spare production capacity offers little
comfort. It happened because OPEC cut
production. Total sustainable capacity of
quota-bound OPEC members actually fell
August-to-August by 170,000 b/d.
If there’s warming news in any of this,
it’s that capacity losers include the three
producers that worry the market most. So
potential losses from disruptions in Venezuela, Nigeria, and Iran are less, however
slightly, than they were before.
But that’s stretching. Demand’s still rising. The market remains under strain.

Crude price rebounds then settles
Crude futures prices rebounded more than $10/bbl in the ﬁrst 3 weeks of September to a record high of $83.90/bbl Sept. 20 on the New York Mercantile Exchange then
ﬂuctuated in a $5/bbl range below that, subsequently closing at $81.22/bbl Oct. 5.
Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, noted
for the third consecutive week benchmark US crude futures had traded “in a very
narrow range but still near record highs.” Although West Texas Intermediate had
declined, it was “still $21.45/bbl higher than a year ago,” Jakob said.
Many analysts credited the weakness of the dollar for helping to keep energy
prices at higher levels than otherwise could be expected. In late September into
early October, the US dollar sank to its lowest level against the euro since 2004. The
dollar index inched up just 0.4% Oct. 5 amid reports European ﬁnance ministers
were trying to bring the euro down from record highs against the weakened dollar.
That same day US ofﬁcials said the economy improved with strong employment
ﬁgures for September.
“Concerns over worrisome economic indicators have undermined oil prices on
fears of a slowdown in oil demand growth,” said analysts at KBC Process Technology Ltd. in Surrey, UK. They predicted, “Crude oil prices will not hold above $80/bbl,
and this will lead to liquidation of speculative length and a sharp drop in oil prices,
sooner rather than later.”
The Societe Generale Group in Paris said increased reﬁnery maintenance and
retreating reﬁning margins should pull down crude prices through reduced demand.
“Reﬁning margins are poor everywhere on a sharp fall last week, except in Singapore,” group analysts reported Oct. 8. Even so, they said, “It will take time for lower
runs to tighten product balances.”
‘Bullish’ indicators
However, analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
said: “The global oil outlook looks as bullish as we have seen in many years. We are
looking at meaningful oil inventory reductions, despite the following (very conservative) supply-demand assumptions. First, we believe the oil market will continue to
overestimate non-OPEC’s ability to grow production; this is a trend that will likely
continue for the next decade. Second, since non-OPEC oil supply is not going to be
able to meet the rising demand, the world is going to be increasingly dependent on
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ ability to increase production.
We are assuming that key OPEC producers ramp back up 2008 production to peaks
seen in late 2005. Finally, limited oil supply growth forces us to model a slowdown
in oil demand growth in both the US and Asia.”
Raymond James forecast worldwide oil demand will grow only 1.5% vs. the
Paris-based International Energy Agency estimates of 2.4% growth in 2008. “Even
with lower demand growth assumptions and Saudi Arabia returning to late 2005
production highs, global oil inventories are likely to fall again in 2008. Ultimately, as
worldwide inventories continue to fall and mature oil ﬁelds continue their production declines, we expect oil prices to maintain their bullish trajectory. Accordingly,
we are increasing our 2008 oil price forecast from $70/bbl to $80/bbl and setting our
initial 2009 forecast at $85/bbl,” Raymond James analysts said.
Still, KBC analysts point out the “virtual disappearance” of US demand growth
in the third quarter. “US expansion appears to have been curtailed as falling house
prices dent both consumer conﬁdence and construction activity,” they said.
After falling in August, US gasoline inventories were down to 191.3 million bbl in
the last week of September. “While this is a massive 22 million bbl below the record
high level for this time of the year in 2006, the peak demand season is over, and
the threat of hurricane disruption is fast receding. The front month NYMEX gasoline
crack has fallen below $3/bbl, which appears to belie stated market concerns over
tightness in gasoline. Moreover, it seems to suggest that the current high level of
speculative length in gasoline (47,000 contracts) could be vulnerable to liquidation,”
said KBC analysts.
US distillate fuel stocks were at 135.9 million bbl in the same week—an “adequate
level” said KBC analysts. “Thus, with forecasts of a comparatively mild fourth quarter, speculators might also be carrying a high level of exposure on No. 2 heating oil
with a net long position of 37,000 contracts, especially when reﬁnery output rises
later in October as the current period of US reﬁnery maintenance draws to a close.
Any sell-off in either gasoline or heating oil would also impact on the price of crude,”
they said.

Welcome to the 20th Deep Offshore Technology International Conference & Exhibition
It’s a pleasure to welcome you to PennWell’s 20th Deep Offshore International Conference & Exhibition
(DOT). We’re celebrating our 20th anniversary in Houston at the George R. Brown Convention Center and
we expect the largest attendance in DOT history.
The theme for this event, “Risks, Resources & Rewards” captures three key challenges facing the deepwater
industry - safely and successfully managing risks, completing projects on time and under budget with limited
resources, and assuring profitability in the face of increasing costs and difficult operating environments.
As most of you know, improved commodity prices have been accompanied by significant increases in the
cost of equipment and services. At the same time, the industry is faced with an inadequate supply of trained
and experienced personnel in virtually every engineering and technical discipline. Meanwhile, the search
for hydrocarbons is moving into more hostile environments and greater water depths. The challenge for all
operating companies is to apply the right technology to safely deliver vital oil and gas to the world’s growing
economies while returning adequate value to the shareholders.
More than ever, the industry must rely on innovation in technology to unlock deepwater assets. New
and improved technology - much of which you will see presented at DOT in Houston - must provide the
capabilities to succeed in the face of these challenging circumstances.
The mission of DOT is to provide an annual forum dedicated to the advancement of the deep offshore
industry that addresses these technical challenges. The conference provides an unparalleled networking
opportunity for attendees to share technology and address issues with experts in their respective fields
and to gain an understanding of the changes that are taking place within those technologies. DOT also
encourages the development of young professionals. This initiative has resulted in a growing number of
papers authored by young engineers. Newcomers to the industry have found DOT to be an effective forum
at which to quickly gain an understanding of key deepwater technologies.
This year’s program will focus on lessons learned from recent field developments, emerging technical
solutions, and areas where new challenges still remain. This year’s conference features the high-quality
selection of papers participants have come to expect, with special emphasis on the unique challenge of
subsea boosting and processing and expanded discussion of riser technology.
On behalf of the Advisory Board, I welcome you to DOT Houston 2008. I believe you will find this year’s
program stimulating, engaging, and beneficial as we anticipate the highest attended DOT yet.
I look forward to seeing you on the show floor.

08:30 a.m. – 09:00 a.m.

“Plug and Play” Deepwater Minimum Production Riser System
Jean-Luc Legras – Acergy
As operators progress in deepwater reservoirs, smaller isolated zones are identified. Contractors need solutions for this inevitable
refinement process.

09:00 a.m. – 09:30 a.m.

Developments in Riser Technology for the Next Generation Ultra-Deep HPHT Wells
Roy Shiling – BP America
BP is currently looking at the next generation of development projects in the US GoM deepwater operating region. These wells will
involve HPHT requirements together with requirements for sour service compliant materials.

09:30 a.m. – 10:00 a.m.

Design Options of Top Tensioned Risers for XHPHT Development in Ultra-Deepwater
Lixin Xu – Technip
Dry tree risers have been successfully used with floating production systems in a wide range of deepwater applications (up to 8,000 ft.),
in particular, in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM).

TRACK 3

Flow Assurance • Well Construction • Field Development

CONSTRUCTION / INSTALLATION 2 – Chair: John Murray – FloaTEC / Co-Chair: Pete Strake – Hydro
08:30 a.m. – 09:00 a.m.

Corrosion Protection -– Robust Retrofit of a Gravity Based Production Structure in Frozen Artic High Scour Conditions
Michael Surkein – ExxonMobil Development Company
Cathodic protection retrofit of a gravity based structure located in Russian waters was completed using a uniquely designed (one of a
kind) impressed current system consisting of semi-remote anode sleds.

09:00 a.m. – 09:30 a.m.

FPSO Hull Refurbishment: Theoretical and Practical Execution
Taco Terpstra – Gusto
These last months have seen an important increase of FPSO conversions due to two circumstances: new-building shipyards slots unavailability, and fast-track project needs linked to the relatively high price of oil barrel.

09:30 a.m. – 10:00 a.m.

Going into 2000 m+ Waters: Are Pipe-in-Pipes Getting too Heavy for Installation?
Christian Geersten – ITP Interpipe
The typical pipe-in-pipe consisting of an inner pipe designed for the wellhead shut-in pressure and an outer pipe designed for
hydrostatic pressure is running into installation capacity limits as water-depths increase beyond 2000-2500m.

10:00 a.m. – 10:30 a.m. COFFEE BREAK

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2008
10:30 a.m. – Noon SESSION 9:
TRACK 1

Floating Facilities • Lessons Learned • Integrated Operations

Sponsored by:

STATION KEEPING & MOORING – Chair: Richard D’Souza – KBR/Granherne Americas / Co-Chair: Majid Al-Sharif – Helix Energy Solutions Group
10:30 a.m. – 11:00 a.m.

Bending Effects on the Fatigue Performance of Mooring Line Chains
Author TBD – Saipem SA
Since the unexpected rupture of chains in the chain hawse of the Girassol buoy, industry attention has been paid to the bending fatigue
phenomena. Understanding of the involved mechanism has now been improved.

11:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m.

Acoustic Frequency Management in the Atlantis Field
Geir Karlsen – BP America
BP Atlantis is located in 7000-ft water-depth in Green Canyon block 743. The producers and the injectors tie back to the Production
Quarters (PQ), two miles south of the well center. A comprehensive SIMOPS Plan handles the acoustic frequency management.

11:30 a.m. – Noon

Development and Construction Status for a Novel Dynamically Positioned Offshore Loading Terminal
Claes Olsen – Remora ASA
As oil is discovered in increasingly deeper waters, Remora has identified a need for a more suitable offshore loading system than the
traditional moored buoy system. A novel technology including a DP based loading vessel has been developed to meet this need.

TRACK 2

Subsea Technology • Riser Technology

FLOW ASSURANCE 1 – Chair: Lee Noris – Scandpower / Co-Chair: Jeff Schrull – ADDAX Petroleum
10:30 a.m. – 11:00 a.m.

Synergies between Injection Network Design and Virtual Flow Metering
John Friedemann – VetcoGray Scandinavia
It is well known that virtual flow metering systems are dependent upon a reliable and well designed valve and instrumentation system.
A well designed system should then consider all of the operational conditions for the application.

11:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m.

Stabilization of Gas Coning in Horizontal Wells Using Automatic Feedback Control
Vidar Alstad – Hydro Oil & Energy Research Centre Porsgrunn
The daily production optimization of wells on Grane depends on keeping the desired stable flow rates from the wells in order to fully
utilize the available topside processing capacity.

11:30 a.m. – Noon

Long-Distance Step-Out – How Far Can We Go?
Christian Geersten – ITP Interpipe
Recent advances in subsea power distribution such as implemented by Statoil have changed perspectives on extremely long tie-backs.
For fluids other than dry gas, long tie-backs were mostly academic.

TRACK 3

Flow Assurance • Well Construction • Field Development

FIELD DEVELOPMENT – Chair: Paul Hansen – Chevron / Co-Chair: Uri Nooteboom – INTEC Engineering
10:30 a.m. – 11:00 a.m.

MARS (Multiple Application Re-injection System): an Investment in Future Field Productivity and Flexibility
Ian Donald – DES Operations
Historically, intervention on subsea wellheads is a high risk/high cost activity. Routine field shutdowns for maintenance or simple service
activities are cost prohibitive due to lost production revenues and intervention costs.

11:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m.

Fiscal Metering Solution for Subsea TieBacks
Hans Olav Hide – MPM
A metering system to perform multiphase measurements at fiscal standards provides new alternatives for subsea tiebacks..

11:30 a.m. – Noon

Remote Power Generation for Deployment of New Subsea Technologies` onto Deepwater Marginal Fields
Christian Cermelli – Marine Innovation & Technology
A power generation platform is a viable solution to marginal and remote fields developments. Many deepwater marginal fields can be
produced economically if they are tied back to a nearby production facility.

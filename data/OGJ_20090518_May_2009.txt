COVER
Maintenance issues were paramount in August 2008 as Hurricane Gustav approached the Louisiana coast, threatening Motiva
Enterprises’ 235,000-b/d Convent, La., refinery (cover), 30 miles
southeast of Baton Rouge.The company shut down the refinery
until after Gustav’s landfall in Louisiana on Sept. 1 and managed
to restart the plant without major difficulty, a spokesperson told
OGJ.The importance of maintenance procedures is the focus of
a series of three articles, Part 1 of which begins in this Oil &
Gas Journal special report on Process Plant Maintenance and
Turnaround that begins on p. 46. Photo from Motiva partner Shell
Oil Co., Houston.

Deutsche Bank: OPEC needs to cut output
With global oil and product inventories high and with demand
deteriorating, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
needs to further cut its crude output, according to Deutsche Bank
analyst Adam Sieminski.
Despite this, Sieminski writes in a new report that OPEC is unlikely to lower its exports because prices have been rising. For the
week ending May 1, US demand for motor gasoline climbed less
than 5% from a year earlier, while for the preceding week demand
was up 8%, and a month ago it was up over 10% from a year
earlier, indicating the onset of a downward trend in the demand
growth rate, Sieminski wrote.
Momentum in the demand rate for distillate fuels as reported by
the US Energy Information Administration also decreased during
the latest reporting week.
Although gasoline inventories, measured in terms of days of
forward cover, look relatively normal, oil and gasoline inventories
are very full, Sieminski said.
He added that crude prices recently have been driven higher by
a combination of rising expectations for a faster economic recovery, increased funds flow into commodities, and higher utilization
at US refineries, which were up 2.6% this week to 85.3%—the first
rise since January. This rise in utilization shows refineries are gearing up for the US driving season, which begins on May 25.
Sieminski believes that gasoline cracks are holding on tertiary
stocking and could come under pressure when that stocking runs
its course.
“Eventually, in our view, refiners will have to scale back, and this
will force crude oil back to $50/bbl,” Sieminski said.
Deutsche Bank estimates that WTI will average $47/bbl for
2009, rising to average $55/bbl next year.
Meanwhile, the Deutsche Bank US natural gas forecast calls for
an average of $4.50/MMbtu this year, rising to $6.50/MMbtu next
year.

said Mark Myers with the Alaska Department of Natural Resources.
Other countries such as China and Japan that have fewer supply options likely will snap up LNG, Myers said. LNG will go there
because it will bring higher value than in North America.
Alaska has 85 tcf of unconventional gas resources on top of its
vast conventional endowment, Myers said.
Infrastructure is in place except for the proposed 4.5 bcfd, 48in. pipeline to northern Alberta, he noted.
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said Washington policymakers don’t realize that delaying exploitation of Alaska’s onshore gas and putting
off exploration for offshore gas will result in greater greenhouse
gas emissions in the interim until more renewable energy sources
can be brought into play.

Two Dallas promoters named in SEC complaint

Two Dallas promoters raised $10 million from 300 investors
nationwide through fraudulent offers and sales of oil and gas joint
venture interests, the US Securities and Exchange Commission
charged.
SEC filed a civil injunctive action in US District Court in Dallas alleging that Hartmut T. (Hardy) Rose and James Patrick Reedy
acted through Geo Cos. of North America Inc., Geo Natural Resources Inc., and Geo Securities Inc. between August 2003 and August 2005.
SEC’s complaint said the pair made numerous false and misleading representations and omissions in connection with the offers
and sales of the interests, including Reedy’s touting Geo’s successful track record when, in reality, the firm had very few wells producing commercial quantities.
It also charged in several instances Rose and Reedy solicited
funds from investors to complete wells without disclosing that
Geo’s geologists advised against completing them. Finally, the
complaint alleged Rose and Reedy sought additional money from
investors by falsely portraying prior wells as successful when they

is 13,907 ft.
Total said the discovery “confirms the existence of significant
Albian resources in the northern part of the Moho-Bilondo license,
in addition to the already recognized Tertiary and Albian A and B
resources.”
Total said this and the Mono Nord Marine-1 and 2 finds in
2007 and the positive delineation well Moho Nord Marine-3 in
2008 “reinforce Total’s confidence in the emergence of a development pole” in the northern part of the license. Preliminary development studies have begun.
The company started production in the Phase 1 development
of Moho-Bilondo field in the southern part of the license in April
2008. It is drilling more wells and building production to an expected plateau of 90,000 b/d of oil equivalent from 14 wells in
2010.
License interests are Total E&P Congo 53.5%, Chevron Overseas Congo Ltd. 31.5%, and Soc. Nationale des Petroles du Congo
15%.
Total noted that it has drilled half of all exploration wells in
Congo, begun production on 15 fields covering 9 of the 28 existing permits or concessions, and discovered 65% of initial listed
reserves in the country.
It is operator with 53% interest at Nkossa field, where work
undertaken since 2005 arrested a decline and stabilized production
at 50,000 b/d.
In October 2008, Total began developing Libondo, a satellite of
Yanga field, where it is operator with 65% interest.
The company continues to explore the Mer Tres Profonde Sud
permit, on which it has made five discoveries. Total is operator
with 40% interest.

Tullow discovers more oil in Uganda
Tullow Oil PLC said its Nsoga-1 exploration well, which was

MMS, NPD sign cooperative exploration agreement
The US Minerals Management Service signed a memorandum
of understanding with the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, MMS
announced on May 6.
The agreement’s objectives are to establish and build relationships; promote cooperative resource management activities in exploration and production; promote the sharing of scientific and
technical information, exploration, and production strategies as
well as technical solutions; and conduct cooperative research studies, MMS and NPD officials said.
MMS acting director Walter D. Cruickshank and NPD director
general Bente Nyland signed the MOU. They said the agreement
will adhere to applicable US and Norwegian laws.
It complements an existing MOU between MMS and Norway’s
Petroleum Safety Authority, Cruickshank noted. ✦

Production

Reliance starts gas production from Dhirubhai ﬁnds
Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) started natural gas production
from the Dhirubhai 1 and 3 discoveries on the KG-D6 block off
India in early April.
This was a major discovery for India because it provided an
increase in domestic energy supplies that raised questions whether
the nation’s energy import plans make sense. At peak production,
the KG-D6 facility is expected to produce 550,000 boe/d. It was
brought into production 61⁄2 years from discovery.
The block is in the Krishna Godavari basin in the Bay of Bengal.
The gas is received at the Gadimoga onshore facility and delivered
to the East West pipeline. Wells, are connected by flow lines and
production risers to a control and riser platform and are tied back
to the terminal about 60 km from the gas fields—one of the longest tie backs in the world.

cored, logged, and sampled.
The total net Kasamene-type reservoir is 43 m thick, of which
the top 3 m are oil-bearing at this location. “At the crest of the trap,
which is 160 m vertically up-dip, the entire reservoir should be oil
filled,” the firm said.
Tullow said in a separate low net-to-gross section, immediately
above this Kasamene-type reservoir, “12 m of thin-bedded oilbearing sands were also encountered and are likely to have deeper
oil water contacts based on seismic amplitudes and pressures.”
“This latest result further extends the play and derisks several
adjacent prospects located in Blocks 1 and 2, which are scheduled
for drilling later in the year,” Tullow said of Nsoga-1, which is the
seventh successful test of the Victoria Nile Delta play fairway within
the Lake Albert Rift basin.
The well is now being suspended as a future oil producer and
on completion of operations the rig will move to test the Awaka
prospect with drilling operations scheduled to commence this
month.
Tullow has interests in three licenses in the Lake Albert Rift basin in Uganda. Tullow operates Block 2 with a 100% interest and
has a 50% interest in Blocks 1 and 3A, which are operated by Heritage Oil 50%.

“At the seabed, equipment equivalent to over 110,000 tonnes
of steel weight and over 2,400 line-km of flowlines and umbilicals
have been installed to construct a deepwater production system.
Subsea installations were carried out by remotely operated vehicles
at sea bed depths ranging from 600-1,200 m, well beyond diver
depths,” said RIL.
This was a challenging project because of the harsh weather apart
from a window of 4 months every year. Other difficulties included supply chain challenges and manpower shortages against tight schedules.
RIL will sell gas produced from its KG-D6 block off east India
to several companies for power generation under a gas sales and
purchase agreement (GSPA).
Buyers will take 11 million standard cu m/day of gas at 11 different power stations for 5 years, which will be delivered through

RIL expects to sign GSPAs with other power companies shortly,
which is anticipated to increase the contracted quantity of gas for
the power sector to 18 million standard cu m/day.
The power companies also signed a gas transportation agreement (GTA) with RGTIL.
PMS Prasad, RIL president and chief executive officer of petroleum, said the expected supply of 18 million standard cu m/day
of gas to the power sector would largely eliminate their gas supply
deficit and would result in generation of 4,000 Mw of power, providing welcome relief in many parts of the country.

Telemark, Clipper Corridor development advances
Development of the ATP Oil & Gas Corp.-operated Telemark
and Clipper Corridor discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico
advanced with the awarding by Bluewater Industries Inc. of two
lumpsum contracts to Technip.
Bluewater is managing the two development projects. ATP owns
100% of Telemark, and 55% of Clipper Corridor.
Telemark lies on Atwater Valley Block 63 in 4,450 ft of water
and will be tied back to ATP’s Titan Mini DOC deep-draft floating
drilling and production platform scheduled for installation in midyear in Mirage and Morgus fields on Mississippi Canyon blocks 941
and 942, respectively.
The Telemark contract to Technip includes the design and manufacturing of one high-pressure, 2-mile long flexible riser, engineering for installation and welding of one 13-mile oil and gas
production flowline, installation of the flowline and associated riser
with an option to install an umbilical, fabrication and installation
of subsea structures and a jumper, and precommissioning work.
Clipper Corridor lies on Green Canyon Block 299 in 3,460 ft of
water and will be tied back to the Front Runner spar, operated by
Murphy Oil Corp., on Green Canyon Block 338.
The Clipper Corridor contract covers design and manufacture
of two 11⁄2-mile high-pressure flexible risers; engineering for the
installation and welding of one 151⁄2-mile pipe-in-pipe oil production flowline and one 151⁄2-mile gas line; installation of the
flowlines, risers, and umbilical; fabrication and installation of four
subsea structures and associated jumpers and flying leads; and precommissioning work.
Technip’s operating center in Houston will execute these contracts, with riser fabrication in Le Trait, France, and flowline welding in Mobile, Ala.
Technip says offshore installation is scheduled for late 2009 to
early 2010 for the Telemark project and for second quarter 2010
for the Clipper Corridor project, using the Deep Blue, Technip’s
deepwater pipelay vessel.

Technip will use also its Deep Pioneer deepwater construction
vessel on the Telemark project.

Kurdistan plans Taq Taq oil exports
Addax Petroleum Corp., Calgary, has received notification from
the Kurdistan Regional Government of plans to export crude oil
from Taq Taq field in northern Iraq.
Addax and Genel Energy International Ltd., partners in Taq Taq Operating Co., submitted a field development plan in March envisioning peak
production of as much as 180,000 b/d (OGJ Online, Mar. 18, 2009).
The government has requested that the companies prepare to
carry oil by truck from the field to the Khurmala export station
about June 1. At Khurmala, oil will enter Iraq’s export pipeline
transiting Turkey with a terminal at Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
The joint venture currently is expanding Taq Taq production capacity to 70,000 b/d from its present level of as much as 40,000
b/d. Full field development will require construction of a pipeline.
The State Oil Marketing Organization will sell the oil. Taq Taq

Anadarko agrees to pay penalty for oil spills
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and two of its units will pay $1.05 million in fines and upgrade their spill-prevention plans as part of a settlement for oil spills in Wyoming, according to US government agencies.
The US Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection
Agency said Anadarko and units Howell Corp. and Howell Petroleum Corp. also will spend more than $8 million to implement
plans to resolve violations of the Clean Water Act.
According to the consent decree, filed in US District Court in
Cheyenne, Wyo., Anadarko and its Howell units will pay the fine
and also will upgrade and implement appropriate spill-prevention
plans and develop and implement facility response plans.
DOJ and EPA said the consent decree also requires the three
companies to implement “a multiphased integrity and mitigation
plan that incorporates inspection, monitoring, testing, data collection, and failure analysis activities.”
According to a complaint filed at the same time as the consent decree, Anadarko and the two other firms allegedly discharged
harmful quantities of oil from its facility in Wyoming on more
than 35 occasions between Jan. 26, 2003, and Oct. 19, 2008.
The complaint alleges that more than 31,300 bbl of oily water
and oil were released during the spills and resulted in an observable film, sheen or discoloration on the surface of the impacted
water or shoreline.
The spills occurred on oil production fields in Park, Johnson,
and Natrona counties and resulted in the pollutants being discharged into the tributaries or drainages of Silver Tip Creek and
Salt Creek, which are tributaries to the Clarks Fork and Powder
rivers, respectively. ✦

QSN gas line starts ﬂow in Australia
A natural gas link between Queensland, South Australia, and
New South Wales has finally been completed with the opening this
week of two new lines and compression facilities in Queensland.
Epic Energy built the 180-km, 400-mm high-pressure gas line,
known as the Queensland-South Australia-New South Wales (QSN)
line, which will transport gas from the Wallumbilla gas hub in eastern Queensland through the company’s Southwest Queensland line
to connect with the Moomba-Adelaide and Moomba-Sydney lines.
A second, 113-km, 400-mm line, commissioned by AGL Energy,
will transport gas from a point about 81⁄2 km east of Miles near the
Condamine electric power station in central-eastern Queensland to
the Wallumbilla hub.
Epic has increased the flow capacity of its Southwest Queensland line with construction of a midline compressor facility, while
AGL designed and built a Wallumbilla compressor station to enable
gas from AGL’s Berwyndale coalseam methane field to enter the
high pressure Southwest Queensland line.
Completion of all this work means there is an interconnected eastern Australian pipeline network that will provide a level of security of
gas supply to customers in New South Wales and South Australia.

built near Manzanillo on Mexico’s Pacific Coast to Guadalajara. The
30-in. OD pipeline will have capacity to ship 500 MMcfd of natural
gas, with a targeted in-service date of 2011.
Mexico’s state-owned electric power utility Comision Federal
de Electricidad (CFE) has a 25-year contract for all gas shipped
through the line, which will be used to serve power generation
load in both Manzanillo and Guadalajara as well as connecting to
an existing Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) line near Guadalajara. Peruvian LNG will supply most of the gas for the pipeline.
The pipeline’s 2011 in-service target coincides with the planned
2011 startup of the Manzanillo LNG terminal. Mexico already has
two LNG regasification plants in operation—at Altamira on the Gulf
of Mexico and Ensenada on the Pacific Coast—part of Ministry of
Energy plans to increase LNG imports to 1.99 bcfd by 2017 from

The Guadalajara Pipeline will cost an estimated $320 million.

Skanled partners place gas line plans on hold
ExxonMobil signs Gorgon LNG deal

The Skanled partners have suspended the pipeline project that
was to deliver Norwegian gas to Sweden and Denmark because of
the global economic uncertainty and increased commercial risk.
The pipeline was scheduled to start operations in 2012 and
Gassco AS, the leader of the consortium, said it was unclear on
what future gas demand would be.
“Despite strong efforts by many stakeholders to succeed with
the project, it is Gassco’s view that the current economic environment and also subsequent uncertainties related to timing of new
field developments on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, have
weakened the basis for the project,” said Thor Otto Lohne, Gassco
executive vice-president.
“The project might be relaunched if the commercial conditions
become more favorable in the future,” Lohne said.
It has been difficult for the partners to secure gas volumes to
underpin the project as the shippers have not been able to reach
the gas sales agreements. They planned to submit installation and
operation plans to the authorities in April.
Skanled, which will cost an estimated 10 billion kroner, was

ExxonMobil Corp., one of three joint venture partners in the
proposed development of the Gorgon-Jansz gas fields, agreed to
sell some of its LNG production to Petronet LNG of India.
ExxonMobil will supply 1.5 million tonnes/year of LNG to the
Indian company for 20 years. This represents 10% of the three-train
project’s total planned capacity of 15 million tonnes/year of LNG.
ExxonMobil has a 25% share in the project and its production.
ExxonMobil and Petronet will work to conclude a sale and purchase deal in June.
Petronet intends to ship its LNG from the proposed Barrrow
Island plant to a new receiving terminal in the port city of Kochi,
which will have a total capacity of 2.5 million tonnes/year of LNG.
The terminal is scheduled to begin operations in 2011.
This is the latest move to develop the Gorgon-Jansz project, the
most recent being the conditional environmental approval by the
Western Australian EPA last week for a third LNG train to be added
to the development plans on Barrow Island.

CO2 challenge urged
A strong legal challenge needs to
be made to the EPA finding that CO2 is
harmful. The grounds would be that they
have exceeded their authority and that
they have misapplied science. A vigorous presentation needs to made in a
fair court of the true science and a cross
examination done on the junk science.
The recent facts are that the sun has
changed from global warming to global
cooling and that for about 10 years
world temperatures are down as the sun
spot cycle produces less radiation heat.
Historical data shows that increases in
atmospheric CO2 come AFTER the earth
warms slightly and therefore cannot
be considered a cause. Data shows that
modest earth temperature-change cycles
are normal and not related to man. The
models predicting catastrophe are too
simplistic and biased to be believable or
relied on.
There are plenty of facts for a strong
legal challenge, and a successful one
would be of great benefit to the country
and to many industries.

Lessons from biofuels
As markets balk, the US government recommits
itself to the care and feeding of renewable fuels.
Lavish subsidies and volumetric mandates haven’t
been enough. The administration of Barack Obama
could save itself trouble and the US money by
learning that subsidies and mandates never will be
enough.
Setting the leading renewable fuels back onto
their feet won’t be easy. Fuel ethanol and biodiesel are now flat on their backs. Producers of both
politically pampered fuels are struggling if not
already bankrupt. Part of the reason is that recession has made business tough for everyone. But
that’s far from the only problem.

Dependent energy
Energy sources dependent on governmental
favoritism live or die by bureaucratic assessments of
future business conditions and politically motivated
dispensation of third-party funds. That means they
die. Governments do no better than anyone else at
predicting energy markets and worse than everyone
else at reacting to market surprises. Political fuel
choice is at best erroneous, at worst corrupt, and
too frequently both.
Few in Washington, DC, will admit it, but the
American biofuels program is a rapidly degenerating fiasco. Ill-considered energy laws require the
use of biofuels in amounts that the market soon
may not be able to absorb and that producers later
may not be able to supply.
The immediate problem is escalation of biofuel
mandates in a market for transportation fuels that
has stagnated. Within a few years, the US gasoline
market won’t need all the ethanol required by law
at the 10% blending level. Consumer resistance
and distribution-system limits probably will keep
85% ethanol blends in gasoline—E85—from
making up the difference. Seeing trouble ahead,
ethanol promoters want Congress to raise the cap
on ethanol concentrations in fuel burned in conventional engines. Automakers and manufacturers
of small engines fear the extra alcohol would damage their products.
Beyond the immediate problem of the market’s
ability to absorb ethanol at required rates lie concerns about longer-term supply. The law requires
escalating sales of fuel ethanol made from cellulose. There is no commercial production of such
material at present, although reports of techni16

cal progress appear frequently. Even if cellulosic
ethanol crosses the commercial threshold soon,
the ability of the industry to expand production
fast enough to satisfy future mandates remains in
doubt.
Meanwhile, the heavily subsidized industries
that produce conventional ethanol and biodiesel are retrenching. Both expanded too rapidly
in response to government boosterism and now
reel from excess capacity and feedstock costs
uncompensated by fuel prices in a tepid market.
Their government sponsors didn’t foresee such a
squeeze. The future thus looks cloudy for the economics of conventional ethanol and the technology of its cellulosic successor. Biodiesel, which is
far less important to energy supply than ethanol,
teeters on the economic brink.
On May 5, therefore, the same day the Environmental Protection Agency proposed regulations
implementing an RFS expanded by the Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007, Obama
crooned to the rescue. He directed the agriculture
secretary to “aggressively accelerate the investment
in and production of biofuels” with financial help,
interagency collaboration, and market enhancements. In other words, he ordered his administration to compound an enormous and very expensive mistake.
Economic health won’t come to biofuels by
presidential decree. It can come only through
survival of the rigors of commercial competition. Aggressive political support has put biofuels on a downhill path toward economic ruin,
missed targets, and—at some point—political
revulsion.

Political pressures
Obama and Congress should be discussing at
least the relaxation of mandates and subsidies and
a quick end to tariffs on imported ethanol. It’s too
much to ask, but they also should take a critical
look at price supports for corn.
That they’re not doing any of this testifies to the
political pressures that have shoved these growing
burdens onto the economic shoulders of American
taxpayers and fuel consumers. Politics will keep
politicians from genuinely fixing biofuels. But
lessons from this latest misadventure with market
intrusion should lead them to resolve not to make
the same mistakes with other energy forms. ✦

Uruguay, with no current oil and
gas production, has completed the
qualification step of its first offshore
bid round, offering 11 continental
shelf blocks that drew interest from six
operators.
The Administracion Nacional de

last year and adjusted terms in March
to reflect the slump
in global oil and gas
prices.

and continues studying its feasibility

Safe haven

In comparison with some of its
neighbors, Uruguay represents a safe
haven for international investments.
International oil companies (IOCs)
venturing into Latin America are justifiably concerned about contract stability
and creeping expropriation, having witnessed, or fallen victims to, resurgent
resource nationalism.
A wave of nationalistic moves started
in 2006 when the administration of
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
required the conversion of operating
service agreements, executed by IOCs
with previous governments under the
Apertura (opening), into mixed companies majority-owned and controlled by
the Corporacion Venezolana del Petroleo
(CVP), an affiliate of PDVSA. The companies now must sell all hydrocarbon
production exclusively to PDVSA.

ground in Colombia, Peru, Brazil, or
Chile, which continue to offer attractive
terms and contract stability to foreign
oil investors.
Chile, in fact, shows how a country
with no history of hydrocarbon production and heavily reliant on imports
(98% of the crude oil it needs, 96% of
the coal, and 75% of the natural gas)
has been able to attract foreign investment to exploratory opportunities.3 The
country’s last bid round, held in June
2008 for the Magallanes basin, resulted
in the award of eight blocks. Three of
the blocks involve participation of stateowned Empresa Nacional del Petroleo
(ENAP) in 50-50 joint ventures with
the selected contractors—Pan American
Energy, Greymouth, and Apache. Blocks
with no ENAP participation went to IPR
Mans, Apache, and Greymouth Petroleum (two).
Uruguay thus is trying to join
the safe-haven list of Latin American
countries with its offshore bid round
offering attractive commercial and fiscal
terms to IOCs.
From the standpoint of political
stability, Uruguay ranks in the top 7590 percentile range, according to World
Bank Governance Indicators.4 It ranks
first in Latin America for lowest corruption, first for judicial independence, and
second in South America for protection
of property rights.5 6
Uruguay also has a solid track record
of respecting foreign investment, with
not a single case filed against it before
the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes. It is a
party to numerous bilateral investment
treaties (BITs), affording protection
to foreign investment in the form of
national treatment, most favored nation
treatment, and restrictions on expropriation or nationalization requiring
prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. It has signed 29 BITs with
countries including the US, Canada, the
UK, France, and Spain.7

production-sharing contracts for 11
blocks comprising a total surface area
of 74,000 sq km in the Punta del Este,
Pelotas, and Oriental del Plata basins.
The areas have been the subject of
geological, geophysical, and geochemical study through surveys commissioned by ANCAP. According to ANCAP’s
technicians, many leads and plays have
been identified in shallow to ultradeep
water, some of them analogous to
productive systems elsewhere in the
Atlantic.8 Seismic records include bright
spots—amplitude patterns that may
indicate the presence of natural gas.9
Prospective bidders had to prequalify
by Apr. 30, producing evidence of compliance with legal, financial, and technical criteria. Prequalified companies
may then bid for any number of areas
provided an independent bid is submitted for each. The term for submission of bids by prequalified companies
is scheduled for June 14-July 1. The
blocks will be awarded according to the
following factors:

• Minimum work program.
• Economic terms, including: (a)
the maximum percentage of production requested for cost recovery, (b) the
profit-sharing percentages per type of
hydrocarbon and levels of accumulated
production, and (c) the increase of ANCAP’s sharing percentage for hydrocarbons price increments.
• Maximum participation allowed
for ANCAP in any exploitation lot of
20-40%.

Main ﬁscal terms
The Uruguayan PSC provides for an
exploration period of 4 years, during which the contractor must carry
out the minimum work program. The
contractor has the option to extend the
exploration period by 2 years.
The exploitation period is 25 years,
subject to a maximum PSC term of 30
years. The contractor may request a 10year extension.
As in many PSCs, the contractor’s
remuneration under the Uruguayan

agreement includes cost-recovery and
profit-sharing elements.
The cost recovery portion reimburses
exploration, development, and production costs incurred by the contractor.
The basic profit-sharing split, with
the stipulated range of 20-40% for
ANCAP, depends on the contractor’s bid.
ANCAP’s share is subject to an increase
linked to increases in the prices of oil
and gas over base levels, the percentages
being matters of bidding.
Contractors may export their shares
of production, subject to a preferential right of ANCAP to purchase all or
part of the hydrocarbons as necessary
to satisfy domestic needs. ANCAP may
request that the contractor sell its share
of hydrocarbons.
The government charges no royalties
and exempts PSC contractors from taxes
and levies other than the tax on the
income from business activities (TIBA).
Further, acknowledging the decline
of international crude prices and consequent cuts by IOCs to exploration budgets, ANCAP eased the terms in March,
eliminating the requirement for the
drilling of at least one well during the
exploratory period for certain blocks
and leveling the exploration guarantee
at 10% of the minimum exploration
program.10

Other terms
The PSC attempts to assure the
contractor of fiscal stability through a
cost-reimbursement mechanism. Under
this provision, any new taxes and lev-

ies taking effect after signing of the
PSC and any changes to the TIBA that
increase the contractor’s burden can be
treated as recoverable costs.
If a PSC yields a discovery warranting
development, ANCAP has the right to
participate in the exploitation phase. If
it decides to participate, its notice to the
contractor must include the percentage
it will acquire, ranging between 20%
and the maximum percentage indicated
by the contractor in its bid.
ANCAP’s participation is subject
to its payment to the contractor of
an amount equal to its interest in the
direct drilling and completion costs of
the exploration wells in production.
For appraisal wells, ANCAP must pay
the contractor its participating-interest
share of all direct expenses plus 15% to
cover indirect expenses. However, no
costs are reimbursed for appraisal wells
less than 25% productive.

Effect of slump
Given the country’s history of political and legal stability, Uruguay may be
an attractive destination for foreign
investment in energy ventures.
ANCAP has been actively promoting
the 2009 Uruguay Round, including
road shows in Houston and London.
A major challenge for the 2009
Uruguay Round stems from global
economic problems and budget cuts

in oil and gas prices. However, in

times of crisis, companies that take advantage of good investment opportunities can position themselves to fare
better than their competitors in the

Venezuela’s Chavez nationalizes oil services ﬁrms
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,
attempting to bolster his socialist
spending programs, has nationalized
nearly 40 domestic and international
oil services companies operating in his
country, with another 20 still under
threat.

“This is a revolutionary offensive,”
Chavez said on national television,
adding, “These spaces are now for
the people, we have freed them from
capitalism, they are for the creation of a
new country.”
The property seized includes at least
13 oil rigs, 39 terminals, 300 boats, and
other installations, including two major

gas operations. The seizures come just 2
months after Chavez sent troops to take
over key oil ports in the country (OGJ
Online, Mar. 17, 2009).

‘Poor signals’ to investors
Apart from adversely affecting current operations, however, Chavez’s
recent seizure of the oil service com-

panies also is likely to have an adverse
effect on future investment, not least,
the country’s planned Carabobo licensing round.
“This sends very poor signals to
prospective investors in the Carabobo
block,” said Patrick Esteruelas, an
analyst with the Eurasia Group in New
York.
“Service companies were seen as
relatively safe given their critical role,
and now [state-run oil firm Petroleos de
Venezuela SA (PDVSA)] is sending shots
across the bow to the entire services
sector,” Esteruelas told OGJ.
The takeovers occurred on May 8,
a day after their authorization by the
Chavez-controlled National Assembly,
which said the government will pay
book value for the assets or provide
bonds in lieu of cash as compensation.
The contractors all operate in the
Maracaibo Lake area of Zulia state, a

began suspending payments of fees
to domestic and foreign oil service
contractors, with estimates of the debt
ranging $8-14 billion.
According to Venezuela’s El Universal
newspaper, which cited a yearend report sent to the National Assembly, PD-

VSA owed local and foreign contractors
nearly $14 billion by yearend 2008.
At the time, contractors began to
respond to the problem in a variety of
ways: some wrote off the debt, others suspended work, and others began
negotiating with PDVSA, which sought

Chavez’s power struggle
Chavez, newly emboldened by victory in a Feb. 15 referendum that allows
him to run for office indefinitely, has
since embarked on an aggressive campaign against his political opponents,
aiming to consolidate power in his own
hands.
Manuel Rosales, the mayor of Maracaibo and the opposition’s candidate in
the 2006 presidential election, suffered
harassment at the hands of the Venezuelan secret police and was recently
granted political asylum in Peru, while
the National Assembly recently reduced
the powers of Antonio Ledezma, the opposition mayor of Caracas.
Apart from wresting power from his
opponents, however, Chavez’s takeovers
also reflect his desire to assume complete control of Venezuela’s oil and gas
industry, which finances the central
government as well as social spending
programs that keep Chavez in power.
Faced with the need to maintain
spending on those programs, the
Chavez government in August 2008

he Sultanate of Brunei has long
had a certain cache among
members of the international oil and
gas industry. After all, who would not
like to work on a South Pacific island
with a lot of oil and gas?
A year ago, things were not looking very bright. Industry analysts
were estimating that Brunei’s reserves
would run dry in about 12 years,
while problems were mounting with
Malaysia over maritime boundaries.
Brunei’s Minister of Energy Pehin
Dato Haji Yahya tried to put a positive
spin on the situation. “You’ll never
know—technology can change a lot
of things,” he said, suggesting that
new technology could discover and
reach new deposits.
As for the troubles with Malaysia,
they came to a head 5-6 years ago
when both countries awarded similar
acreages to two different consortia. Tensions rose when a Total SA
exploration vessel, working under a
Bruneian contract, was chased off by
a Malaysian gunboat.

tion might have received the horselaugh from cynics, but in fact it
was borne out in March when the
two nations reached an agreement
over their long-disputed maritime
boundary.
It came about when, among other
things, the two sides established a
“commercial arrangement area” under which oil and gas revenues in the
formerly disputed area will be shared
between the two nations.
There’s no telling what got the
two countries to reach an agreement
after so many years of failing. But it
may have something to do with a
statement by David Blevins, chief operating officer of Nations Petroleum
Sdn. Bhd.

Polo Club perk

At a dinner in October 2008 at
Brunei’s Jerudong Park Polo Club,
Blevins said the “first shot” of the

discounts of as much as 40%, saying
that falling oil prices had slashed the
value of contracts along with revenues.

Companies seized
Among the companies seized by
Chavez is the Simco consortium, 49.5%
owned by the Houston-based Wood
Group, which had a 16-year contract
with PDVSA for operations and maintenance of water-injection facilities on
Lake Maracaibo.
“Simco consortium disappears
today,” said Chavez, adding, “Now,
it belongs to PDVSA.” Wood Group
confirmed the seizure, saying that that
PDVSA took over its operations earlier
this year after the consortium submitted
a notice of default due to nonpayment
and other contractual disputes.
Tulsa-based Williams Cos. Inc.,
which last month wrote off $241 million in unpaid debt, also confirmed the
Venezuelan government seizure of its El
Furrial and PIGAP II gas compression
projects in eastern Venezuela.
Apart from companies, however,
Chavez’s takeover has adversely affected
Venezuela’s labor unions, with one
labor leader estimating that 22,000 oil
contractors stand to lose their jobs as a
result of his action.
“This law does not benefit us,” Bernardino Chirinos, leader of the Union
of Oil Workers in the western state of
Zulia, told El Nacional newspaper.
“There are 35,000 workers on the
east coast (of Zulia state) and only
8,000 will be absorbed” into PDVSA,
Chirinos said. “There are 22,000 workers without guarantees,” he said.
The takeovers could also have an
adverse effect on current drilling operations as drillers step up their efforts for
back payment, or lacking it, stop work.
Ensco International, which halted
drilling off Venezuela in January to
protest $36 million in unpaid bills, said
it would terminate its contract for the
rig Ensco 69 by the end of the month
unless PDVSA pays the back fees.
Meanwhile, PDVSA said there were

Baghdad approves Kurdish exports; contracts thought ‘illegal’
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
The Iraqi government, despite
recently approving the export of oil
from Kurdistan, still considers contracts
signed between the Kurdistan Regional
Government and international oil companies illegal.
“All we are saying is that these
contracts are illegal and illegitimate,”
said Oil Minister Hussein Al-Shahristani.
“The [Kurdistan] region does not have
the right, nor does any province or anyone else, to sign contracts on behalf of
Iraq without authorization,” Shahristani
told state television.
“Any contracts must be submitted to the ministry,” he said following
reports that his ministry had approved
exports of oil to begin from the Kurdish region.
On May 9, the KRG announced
exports of oil from fields in the Kurdish
region would start officially June 1 with

60,000 b/d from DNO International
ASA’s Tawke field. DNO confirmed it
received formal notice to commence
exports on that date.
The KRG said the Kurdish oil would
be marketed by Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organization, and the revenues
would be deposited into the Iraqi state
treasury “for the benefit of all Iraqi
people.”
In March, DNO was poised to begin
exports of oil, having connected the
Tawke oil field to Iraq’s northern pipeline system.
Hardly had DNO announced its
export plan than Addax Petroleum Corp.
also said it received notification from
the KRG of plans to export crude oil
from the Taq Taq field in the Kurdish
area of northern Iraq (OGJ Online, May
11, 2009).
Addax also will commence its exports June 1, but unlike DNO does not
have a pipeline in place. It will have to
truck its oil from the field to the Khur-

mala export station, where it will join
the Kirkuk-Ceyhan line.
The decision of the Iraqi government
was several months in the making and
is due to the country’s need for additional revenues amid the current economic downturn, according to industry
sources.
Regardless of the reasons for its
decision, however, Baghdad is likely to
come under increasing pressure to step
up exports as more discoveries come
online in the Kurdish region.
Earlier this month, Heritage Oil
Corp. reported the discovery of a giant
oil field in Iraqi Kurdistan with 2.3-4.2
billion bbl of oil in place, of which 5070% appears recoverable.
The company said it could start
trucking production from Miran West-1
by yearend, with individual flow rates
likely to be 10,000-15,000 b/d (OGJ
Online, May 6, 2009). ✦

OTC: Shtokman Phase 1 development tenders due out
Guntis Moritis
Production Editor
Shtokman Development AG plans to
send out soon tenders for developing
the giant Shtokman gas field in the Barents Sea, off Russia’s north coast, said
Philippe Rondy, Total SA’s Shtokman
planning manager. Speaking at a topical luncheon at the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston on May 6,
Rondy said once the bids are returned
by yearend, the company will have a
better idea on project costs.
Rondy said the front-end engineering and design on the project that com-

menced in December 2007 will finish
in November, with the company making an investment decision on Phase 1
at the beginning of 2010.
The field, which was discovered
in 1988, has an estimated 135 tcf of
recoverable gas and lies in 1,100 ft of
water near the edge of the winter sea
ice. To date, one exploration well and
six appraisal wells have delineated the
field.
The conceptional stage of Phase 1
has been completed, Rondy said. Phase
1 will involve the production of 2.4
bcfd of gas from three subsea templates

with 20 producing wells. The gas will

pipelines to a planned 7.5 million
tonne/year LNG plant at Teriberka in
the Murmansk Region with another
portion entering the North Stream
pipeline from Teribeka to Vyborg and
then to Germany.
Gazprom has announced that gas
deliveries will commence in 2013 with
LNG exports beginning in 2014.
Rondy said the large 1,200 ft long,
150 ft wide FPU will have topsides that
weigh more than 40,000 tonnes.

Seasoned hand
on Alaska gas line

D

eputy US Transportation Secretary Thomas J. Barrett will join
the office coordinating federal agencies’ responses to expedite construction of a natural gas pipeline from
Alaska to the Lower 48 as its deputy
coordinator on May 26.
His appointment will bring an
administrator to the office with
experience not only in Alaska, where
he was US Coast Guard Commander
from 1999 to 2002, but also as a
federal pipeline regulator.
Barrett, who is a retired US Coast
Guard vice admiral, was sworn in
as the first administrator of the US
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration on May 31,
2006. He became deputy Transportation secretary on Aug. 8, 2007, after
being named acting deputy secretary
on Mar. 3 of that year.
“I’ve had the pleasure of working
with Tom for nearly 20 years, both in
Alaska and the Lower 48. [He] brings
leadership, experience, and incredible
energy to this new challenge which
is so crucial to the long-term energy
security of the United States and to
the state of Alaska,” said Drue Pearce,
federal coordinator for Alaska natural
gas projects, as she announced Barrett’s selection on May 6.

Three decades of discussion
Construction of a gas line from
Alaska’s North Slope to the Lower 48
and in Alaska has been discussed for
30 years, Barrett noted.
“This pipeline is not just an
Alaska project but is a vital national
infrastructure project. Tens of thousands of good jobs will be created

through the life of the project and
clean energy will be delivered to
Americans,” he said. Barrett will
return to Alaska, where he lived for
14 years, to direct the ANGP federal
coordination and manage its field
office in Anchorage.
Salt Lake City-based Northwest
Energy Corp. originally proposed
the idea of building such a pipeline
in 1977, but dropped the plan soon
after it became a Williams Cos. Inc.
subsidiary.

Basic challenge
High gas prices in the late 1990s
led to its revival. Depressed prices
now, and the potential to produce
gas from more shale formations in
the Lower 48, have some observers
questioning whether so massive a
project would ever be economic. The
challenge for federal and Alaska state
government officials will be to keep
it moving.
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin welcomed Barrett’s appointment. “His
career has put him in positions to
protect Alaska’s people fisheries and
environment. We are fortunate to
have him watching over the development and construction of the
Alaska natural gas pipeline,” she
said on May 6.
“I look forward to working with
Federal Coordinator Pearce, Adm.
Barrett, and their entire staff. Having
this quality of individual involved in
moving the Alaska gas pipeline project forward is a benefit to Alaska and
the entire nation,” said Mark Myers,
the state’s Alaska Gas Inducement Act
coordinator. ✦

Saudi Arabia’s state oil company is
feeling the impact of lower prices, but
does not plan to change its spending
plans or production levels, its chief
executive officer said on May 6.
“We were expecting to produce
around 10 million b/d at this time and
now are producing about 8 million
b/d. We’re not seeing any imminent
increase in production because we’re
not seeing any imminent increase in demand, but we continue to invest along
the petroleum value chain because we
expect high demand to return,” said
Khalid A. al-Falih.
“We’re somewhat concerned because
other oil producing countries aren’t
continuing to invest at the same time
because prices are low. At the same
time, however, lower prices encourage
economic recovery,” he said during an
appearance at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies.
Al-Falih noted that Aramco will put
in place another 12 million b/d of
oil production capacity in a few more
weeks when it completes its Khurais oil
field program. Its goal is to raise proven
reserves within Saudi Arabia to 900
billion bbl from 700 billion bbl and its
average recovery rate from 50% to 70%.
The additional production will be both
light and heavy crudes, including one
onshore-offshore field, which it expects
to produce 900,000 b/d when it comes
on stream, he said.

‘World looks to us’
“When there is underinvestment in
other producing countries, the world
looks to us. There are plenty of resources outside of the Kingdom and we
believe they should be produced. We’re
technically capable of producing much

more, but the government will need
to decide if we need to go much above
12 million b/d. We think the optimum
would be to stretch our resources out
for as long as we can,” Al-Falih said.
Aramco’s investments include
developing an “intelligent” field to
maximize recovery; futuristic devices
such as “res-bots,” tiny robots inserted
into reservoirs to continuously report
conditions; carbon capture and storage;
and prerefining crude desulfurization,
he continued. “All of these efforts will
reduce environmental impacts while
building on our experience with proven
technologies and practices in a worldwide market,” he said.
With current low prices discouraging investments already, Al-Falih warned
that governments talking too much
about incentives for research and developing alternatives would only increase
uncertainty in capital markets. He said a
more pragmatic approach would be to
improve proven fuel sources, complemented by growing research and development on alternatives.
“I think it would be very risky to bet
the farm on unproven new energy technologies. Continuing to use conven-

tional energy resources does not mean
continuing to do business as we have,
however. Environmental issues must be
addressed, starting with carbon,” he
said.

Unrealistic targets
Al-Falih said he expects refining
to change as biofuels are developed.
“We don’t believe some biofuel targets
are realistic, but some gasoline crack
spreads have been affected. We believe new refining configurations will
emphasize distillates. We also expect
bunker fuels and heavier products to
be phased out gradually. Over time, the
industry will adjust,” he said.
Al-Falih said he believes it would be
more appropriate for US policy-makers
to talk less about energy independence
and more about energy security. “We
believe the US can increase its energy security by increasing its energy
interdependence. That may seem like
a contradiction, but the US already
has diverse sources. I also believe it’s
appropriate for the US to start developing alternative technologies now, but it
needs to be prudent because conven-

tional fuels still will be needed to meet
growing demand,” he said.
“Within the foreseeable future,
we’re not adjusting our investments
based on any discussions in Washington. Other producing countries might,
such as Canada with its oil sands. The
US will also need to consider producing more of its domestic resources,
although some of them are in parts of
the country where oil is viewed as evil.
That issue should be addressed because
all of us here know that oil is not evil,”
Al-Falih said.
He suggested that additional government regulation of financial markets
may be necessary after crude oil prices
spiked in 2008. “We’re in the minority on what happened, at least publicly.
We felt the market was well-supplied.
At the same time, we were on the
phone literally begging our customers
to take more barrels to reduce pressure
on prices. We continue to believe that
speculators drove the increase a perception that supplies were tight. We found
this odd since we had so much spare
inventories and production capacity,” he
said. ✦

FACTS: 2009-10 LNG demand ﬂat; supplies to glut markets
The 2009 LNG outlook is grim, according to a recently published review
of global LNG by FACTS Global Energy,
Singapore.
FGE authors Nelly Mikhaiel and
Siamak Adibi say that supply gluts, an
economic malaise depressing energy
demand, and plunging petroleum
prices characterize global markets.
In Asia, current LNG demand is
sluggish, while a year ago its markets
needed a steady supply of Atlantic Basin
LNG. This year, Asian cargoes are likely
to be seeking markets west of Suez.
Those markets, however, evince
“indifferent energy demand” as well as
a fresh new slug of LNG supply coming
online by yearend to exacerbate already
saturated global markets.

Demand
Weak economic growth in Asia will
depress LNG demand in the region to
112 million tonnes in 2009, nearly
5% off demand in 2008, says the FGE
report.
Japan, perennially the world’s largest
LNG importer, will lead the way. Japanese utility companies, says the analysis,
have all but eliminated all spot purchases for 2009. The country’s imports,
therefore, will be around 62 million
tonnes, down 10%, from 2008. Imports
for 2010 will recover to around 64 million tonnes.
For Korea, which traditionally comes
in second in global LNG imports, overall gas consumption will decrease by
about 6%. As a result, 2009 Korean LNG

imports will fall by an estimated 7%,
compared with 2008, to 25.6 million
tonnes.
Spot 2009 Korean imports will be
“virtually nil,” say the report’s authors,
until possibly autumn when the traditional storage filling season begins in
advance of winter.
In China, despite the effects of
financial recession, long-term contracts
will nonetheless bring more LNG into
the country. The 2.6-million tonnes/
year (tpy) Fujian LNG terminal will by
mid-year begin receiving shipments
from Indonesia’s much-delayed Tangguh project. A pipeline explosion at the
Shanghai terminal, China’s third, has
pushed commissioning back to at least
yearend 2009. Malaysia LNG (Tiga) is

EOG Resources Inc., Houston, is
emphasizing North American liquids
and natural gas plays as it develops and

Papa expects company-wide production of crude oil, condensate, and
natural gas liquids to grow to 75,000
b/d in 2009 and 90,000 b/d in 2010
compared with 61,000 b/d in 2008
and 43,000 b/d in 2007.
EOG, however, is also poised to capitalize when gas prices improve, Papa
said.
“Practically speaking, we can grow

A trend of increasing North American liquids production will continue for
several years as the company’s horizontal oil plays begin to have greater effect,
Papa said.
The company’s main liquids plays are

play in a tight siltstone at Waskada field

Papa said the company’s holding
of 500,000 net acres is industry’s best
position in the Bakken Trend.
Coming off of 2008’s service and
supply price spike, EOG Resources
restricted its Bakken oil production
for the first 6 months of 2009 due to
marketing issues. Initial potential of the
Bakken wells it completed in 2008 averaged 1,700 b/d.
The company shrank Bakken drilling to eight rigs from 10 last year and
deferred almost all completions until
mid-2009 when fracs can be performed

The company’s 2009 plan is to drill

activity might recover.
Baker Hughes Inc. reported a rig
count of 975 working rigs for the week
ended Apr. 17 compared with 1,743
rigs drilling during the same period a
year ago.
The weekly rig count released Apr.
17 marked the first time since Apr. 30,
2003, that fewer than 1,000 rotary rigs
were working in the US and its waters.
It also marked the lowest weekly rig
count since Apr. 2, 2003, when 972
rigs were drilling.
Halliburton Co. Chief Executive
Officer Dave Lesar called the drilling
decline “unprecedented” and said it’s
impossible to say when activity might
recover. He believes the downturn
came more quickly than in past drilling
slump cycles.

peake plans to limit production from
most newly completed wells in the
Barnett and Fayetteville shales to 2
MMcfd. Production in the Marcellus
shale will be limited to 5 MMcfd and
Haynesville shale production limited to
10 MMcfd.
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake’s
chief executive officer, blamed soft gas
prices on “recession-related reduced
demand and abundant US production.”
Lower drilling activity and natural reservoir depletion will rebalance the gas
market by early 2010, he said.
J. Marshall Adkins, analyst with Raymond James & Associates, said US gas
production rates have yet to reflect the
plummeting US drilling activity.
“Unfortunately, we still do not
believe the US gas supply rollover will
come soon enough or be large enough
to save the natural gas market from
further meltdown in 2009,” Adkins
said.
He expects the current slump in
drilling rig activity will hit bottom by
the end of second quarter.
Having slashed his US rig count forecast for 2009-10 since early February,
Adkins said Apr. 20 that he anticipates
the US rig count will bottom at around
700 rigs—down from his earlier February forecast of 800.

Range Resources had 15 rigs operating as of Apr.
16 compared with 33 rigs for the same
time last year.

“The US gas rig count will bottom
close to 500 rigs (down nearly 70%
from the peak), and year-over-year US
gas supply will be down about 6 bcfd
by late 2009,” he said.
Natural gas producers recently have
been drilling but not completing wells,
Adkins said. Based upon his conversations with industry, he estimates that as
many as 1,000 wells were drilled but
not completed during first quarter.
“This equates to roughly 10-20% of
the well count and could delay 10-20%
of expected new production,” or up
to 1.5 bcfd, he said. Operators delay
completions of newly drilled wells
because:
• They can save cash and eliminate
some well costs.
• They can hold leases by drilling
only a vertical well and producing only
a small portion of gas vs. drilling a
horizontal well
• They are waiting for oil and gas
prices to recover before they complete
wells.
• Limited take-away capacity has
prevented completion and production
of wells in some areas, particularly in
the Barnett shale recently.
The rig count in shale plays has held
up better than the total fleet average,
Adkins said, noting that the percentage of active rigs drilling shale plays

Oil drilling to recover ﬁrst
Pritchard Capital Partners LLC expects the rig count will bottom at 8001,000 rigs by June 30, said Pritchard
analysts in an Apr. 20 research note.
They suggested rigs drilling vertical
wells for oil will be among the first to
go back to work.
In April, Chesapeake said it had
resumed 7,000 b/d of production from
previously shut-in oil wells.
Barclays Capital analysts in New York
monitor the number of drilling permits
issued by 30 states. They report a “very
strong relationship” between drilling
permit issuance and US rig count.
In March, the 30 states issued 2,753
drilling permits, down 11.2% from
February and adjusted for comparable
number of filing days. The decline was
broad-based. California was down
99 permits, Montana was down 43
permits, and New Mexico was up 69
permits (see chart).
“We believe the ongoing weakness
in aggregate permitting activity points
to further erosion in drilling demand
during the second quarter,” Barclays
analyst James Crandell said. ✦

The pits and ponds that contained
tan or opaque water had moderate
concentrations of SRB (10-10,000 SRB/

and had the lowest concentration of
APB and SRB. The natural pond samples

The pit with black water was a mixture of flowback and fresh frac water.
This mixture provided the proper nutrient balance to stimulate SRB activity,
resulting in biogenic sulfide production
and black water.

The wellsite survey collected samples
from the water source well, the fracturing water pit, the production separator,
and the produced-water storage tanks
(Fig. 3).
Despite the lining of the frac pit, the
total bacteria count increased by 1.5 log
units if the source-well water was in an
open frac pit. The majority of frac pits
had measurable SRB concentrations.
The separator sample showed high
bacteria concentrations in the microscopic analysis, but bacterial culture
media indicated that the majority of the
bacteria observed by microscopy were
not viable, with only 100 viable APB/ml
recovered.

The survey evaluated several sites at
newly drilled and fractured gas wells. At
each wellsite without a nearby naturally
occurring pond, the operator drilled
freshwater source wells for supplying
water for the frac job. The job required
placing the water from the source well,
either pumped or hauled by truck, into
a lined pit near the well location.
Upon completion of the frac job, the
operator shut in the well from a few
days to several months while waiting
for installation of the surface equipment. Upon installation, flowback of

Microscopic analysis (Fig. 4) showed

Early Barnett shale operators experienced produced-water storage tank and
flowline failures because of the stagnant
conditions and solids deposition in the
storage tanks. The water sat relatively
stagnant in the storage tanks for weeks
to months before removal and transportation to a water-disposal facility.

how seasonal variations affect bacterial
activity and water quality.
These practices provide information
on the severity of bacterial contamination and solids loading in the frac water
sources, allowing for an adjustment of
the biocide loading rates.
When designing a biocide program,
one should consider several different factors. First, it is imperative that
biocide selection testing include waters
representing each type of frac water source. One should only consider
broad-spectrum biocides to ensure
control over the heterogeneous microorganism population present, such as
SRB, APB, algae, and fungi.
After the generation of a list of
products that perform well against the
frac water microbial populations, it is
important to assess if the frac water
contains components such as H2S, iron
sulfide, ammonia, or dissolved oxygen
that might degrade biocide performance. It is essential to assess compatibility of the biocides with the fracfluid additives, such as polymers and
any other chemicals including oxygen
scavengers, scale inhibitors, corrosion
inhibitors, and friction reducers.
Planktonic kill studies provide two
important pieces of information required for killing bacteria:
1. Concentration of biocide required
to kill the target microorganisms in the
water source.
2. The amount of contact time required for the biocide to kill the target
microorganisms.
Controlling bacteria in frac programs
requires storage and treatment of all
frac fluid at the predetermined biocide
dosage rate in frac tanks or application
of the biocide at the desired concentration continuously on the fly, as the frac
fluid is pumped downhole.
In frac-tank applications, the jobs
should retain the frac fluid in the tanks
for the required biocide contact before
the fluid is pumped downhole. In onthe-fly applications, one should ensure
that the biocide-treated fluid is shut in
downhole for the required amount of
contact time.
44

O D U C T I O N

For Barnett shale applications in
which the biocide is injected on the fly
at the blender, the operator should shut
in the wells for at least a 24-hr contact
time before bringing the well online.
The jobs should use EPA-registered
biocides according to the label specifications. For example, application of
an EPA-registered biocide into an open
pit is illegal because of the potential
for leaching into the groundwater and
other surface waters, aquatic organism
toxicity, and terrestrial hazards due to
animal consumption.
One needs to consider the biocide
half-life and recalcitrance to ensure
that the biocide will maintain bacterial
control in the frac waters throughout
fracturing, shut-in, and flowback.
An aggressive monitoring program
is instrumental in assessing the performance of the biocide program. Monitoring can allow an operator to verify
the merit of various costly operational
practices, such as lining of pits.
Monitoring can reveal issues with
sampling points. For this type of application, a sampling point at the production wellhead is necessary to assess
properly the biocide performance and
monitor product residuals. One should
use the information gained from the
monitoring program to optimize a biocide program and assess system conditions that would require an adjustment
of the biocide-loading rate.
When frac pits are filled at the last
minute, bacteria enumeration techniques are unable to provide information on bacterial activity before
proceeding with the frac job. When
flowback waters are reused and mixed
with fresh waters as the water source
for fracturing operations, a water chemistry check must be done first to insure
that the salinity of the culturing media
matches the salinity of the frac source
water.
Operators have used several different
biocides in the Barnett shale gas play.
They have incorporated the biocide
into slick-water fracturing packages to
reduce the chance of bacterial contamination downhole that could cause

microbial-influenced corrosion and
biogenic souring of the reservoir.
The risks associated with an ineffective microbiocide program reach across
all phases of production operations.

ging capability and new, more reliable
vertical inlet separators.
At Milne Point, poor separation performance of existing suction scrubbers
was predicted by computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) modeling and confirmed by laser isokinetic probe sampling to quantify liquid entrainment.
Analysis of operating data also indicated
condensation of liquids in suction piping downstream of the scrubbers.
A multifaceted solution was required, including:
• Reconfiguration of suction cooler
temperature control logic.
• Upgrades to suction scrubber level
control, alarm, and shutdown systems.

• Installation of in-line, axial flow
cyclonic demisters immediately upstream of compressor suction bottles.
• Heat tracing and insulation of
piping and suction pulsation bottles
downstream of the new demisters.
Other options were considered but
rejected for various reasons.
This three-part series will discuss
several noteworthy aspects of these two
repairs, including the role of changing operating conditions in leading to
compressor damage (Part 1), the validation of CFD modeling by on line laser
isokinetic probe sampling for liquid
entrainment and impact of NGL solubility in compressor lube oil (Part 2, May

25, 2009), and use of state-of-the-art
in-line cyclonic separation technology
to mitigate liquid entrainment (Conclusion, June 8, 2009).

Oklahoma incident
In late 2006, a field compression
facility in Oklahoma lost two reciprocating compressors when well fluids,
primarily produced water, flowed past
the inlet separator and the compressor scrubber and into the compressor
cylinders.
The incident damaged two pistons
from the first stages of one machine
and one piston from a second machine.

compressors (Big A and Big B) for bulk
compression and two small compressors (Little A and Little B) for handling
low-pressure secondary and tertiary
production-separator vapor and highpressure injection gas.
The remainder of this discussion will
focus entirely on the Big A/B compressors (Fig. 2).
Each of the Big A/B compressors
is a 327 rpm, four-throw Clark CLRA
compressor driven by a 3,450-hp
electric motor. Each unit compresses
18 MMscfd of produced gas to 1,320
psig from 110 psig inlet pressure for
delivery to field gas lift and gas injection systems.
During normal operation, both
compressors are running, with no spare
capacity. Suction scrubbers and coolers
are common to both compressors. Fig.
2 provides a simplified process flow

system; only the Big A unit is shown,
but the Big B unit has an identical configuration.

pressors were recylindered to increase
maximum gas capacity to 45 MMscfd
from 32 MMscfd, but no corresponding
changes were made to the compression
train’s piping.
The two original suction scrubbers,
V-5501 and V-5511, were not replaced,
but their original vane packs were, with
higher capacity vane pack assemblies.
The new vane pack units were equipped
with mesh pads on the inlet side to improve flow distribution into the vanes.
Compressor maintenance records
show that since the 1995 expansion,
the Big A/B compressors have experienced increased mechanical failures and
required more frequent maintenance.
Within the last few years, the failure
rate has accelerated, with more serious
damage including two Big A cracked
pistons on cylinder No. 3, damaged
cylinder linings, and a sheared wrist pin
on each compressor. Main and connecting rod bearings have failed within
a few weeks to months of installation
(Fig. 3).
In February 2007, Big A experienced

Initial attempts to resolve the increasing compressor problems focused
on reducing excessive vibration caused
by lack of adequate compressor support. Most low-speed reciprocating
compressors are mounted on massive
concrete bases to prevent compressor
movement by absorbing shaking forces
inherent in reciprocating compressors.
Big A/B compressors, however, are
secured to the base of an elevated steel
module with no underlying concrete
mass to dampen vibration. These early
efforts were only partially successful,
often resulting in shifting vibration and
shaking forces from one part of the
compressor module to another.
In response to the rapidly deteriorating mechanical integrity of these
machines, BP initiated a project in
early 2006 to design new compressors
to replace Big A/B. Concurrent with
the compressor replacement project
began an intensive effort to determine
whether the existing machines could
be adequately repaired and upgraded to
allow for safe, long-term operation.
This effort concluded that the main
driving forces responsible for the excessive mechanical failures were subframe flexibility (of the steel module),
inherent compressor weight imbalance,
and liquids ingestion. Specific recommendations were made to correct each

Special Report

Elevated knock-sensor activity also
occurred immediately after a large
manual increase of the discharge
temperature set points for the gas
coolers upstream of the suction scrubbers. This was later determined to
result from increased condensation of
liquids downstream of the scrubbers as
warmer, richer gas came into contact
with cooler suction piping and pulsation bottles.

Suction bottle drains
After discovering liquids in the
suction and discharge bottles of Big A,
operators installed manual drain lines
on all pulsation bottles on Big A and
Big B, with the exception of the Nos. 3
and 4 cylinder discharge bottles. These
drain lines were plumbed to the closed
hydrocarbon drain system but equipped
with connections for collecting samples
of the liquids drained from each bottle.
During the Big A rebuild, operators
drained liquids daily from the Big B
suction bottles to quantify volumes and
verify appearance of the drained liquids.
They repeated this experiment in November 2007 with both Big A and Big
B operating. In all instances, the liquids
drained from the Nos. 1 and 2 bottles
were clear and smelled like gasoline.
Likewise, all liquids drained from the
Nos. 3 and 4 bottles appeared as thin
lube oil.
These visual results were consistent
with earlier observations of liquids discovered during the Big A teardown. The
table shows the average daily volumes
of liquids drained from each suction
bottle during the April and November
tests.
A notable aspect of these results is
the larger quantity of liquids drained
from Big A than from Big B. The compressors are virtually identical and the
main suction line from each suction
scrubber tees into the compressor suction header right in the middle, at an
equal distance from each Nos. 1 and 2
suction bottle. Piping geometry directly
upstream of this tee is presumed to be
the cause of the preferential flow to the
A machine.

This difference in liquid volumes is
entirely consistent with both operating
data and historical mechanical failure
records. Bearing failures and cylinder
knocking related to liquids ingestion
are more frequent and severe on Big A
than on Big B.
Also, both of the No. 3 piston failures occurred on Big A. These failures
were most likely related to liquids ingestion, as described in the next article
in this series. ✦

ICDA region. This method achieves the
objectives of DG-ICDA while eliminating unnecessary digs and project
reporting, ultimately decreasing project
scope.
Evaluating the typical system operating conditions for an extended period
and evaluating the effects of changing
pipeline operating conditions on calculated critical angles can reduce error
in determining places along a pipeline
where fluid or other electrolyte may
reside.

Background
DG-ICDA identifies areas along the
pipeline where fluid or other electrolyte
introduced during normal operation
or by an upset condition may reside,
then focuses direct examination where
internal corrosion is most likely to exist.
ICDA seeks to identify the potential for
internal corrosion, allowing an operator
to prevent any discovered internal corrosion defects from growing to a size
that threatens the structural integrity

also reported no gas additions in South
Carolina and commingling of the gas
within the 4 mainlines.
Since gas in the mainlines is commingled and neither the supply gas
pipelines nor pipelines in the company’s system has a history of internal
corrosion, the system was evaluated as
one ICDA region.

Representative ﬂow
Technicians must establish flow
conditions that represent typical system
operation for each DC-ICDA region to
calculate critical angles. Corrosion’s
state as a time-based phenomenon
requires consideration of the days per
year a system operates at a given set of
conditions.
Selecting flow conditions based on
preestablished system conditions (i.e.,
maximum, minimum, or mean conditions) does not consider actual system
operation. Conditions such as maximum or minimum typically occur on
a few days each year. Observers would
not expect to find extensive internal
corrosion at sites determined by these
conditions.

54

A statistical analysis approach evaluating system operation for an extended
period serves as a preferred method for
determining representative operational
flow conditions. Such an analysis evaluates how long the system operates at a
given set of conditions and allows the
user to select conditions (maximum,
minimum, mean, etc.) based on duration and system operation rather than a
preestablished condition.
The company’s system underwent
a statistical analysis with daily average
flow rate information for 1 year at each
of the seven purchase points, creating
histograms plotting the daily average
flow rate data at each of the seven purchase points. This analysis identified the
characteristics (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, etc.) of the distributions as well
as determining the mean flow condition and establishing delta flow conditions at 1 standard deviation (σ).
Fig. 2 shows a sample daily average
flow rate histogram. During normal
operation of the system any liquid will
likely migrate to positions predicted by
the mean and mean+1σ flow conditions. Mean and mean+1σ flow rate
data provided the basis for calculating

Figs. 3 and 4 show plotting critical
angle vs. temperature results in the appearance of a linear relationship with a
slight parabolic trend for relatively high
critical angles. For a given set of operating conditions with critical inclination
angles less than 45°, the relationship is
roughly linear and the rate of change
in critical angle due to temperature
fluctuations can be considered constant.
For a given set of operating conditions,
therefore, a 20° F. temperature fluctua56

tion from 60° to 80° F. would result in
the same change in critical angle as a
fluctuation from 80° to 100° F. The arcsine function in the equation suggests
this relationship.
The rate of angular change is minimal at low critical angles and becomes
increasingly important approaching
90°.
Plotting the arcsine function (Fig.

100

110

5) yields a linear
trend for angles
up to about 45°.
Angles greater
than 45° have a
less linear relationship and a more
parabolic slope.
As the critical
angle decreases,
the rate of change
in critical angle
with respect to
temperature also
decreases (Figs.
3-4). Plotting the
arcsine function
from 0° to 30°
(Fig. 6) shows that
for critical angles
less than 30° the
slope increases by
3% between 10°
and 20° and 7%

from 20° to 30°.
Plotting critical angle vs. temperature for a range of operating pressures
shows that an increase in pressure results in a decrease in critical angle. Since
flow rate data are calculated in million
cubic feet per day, pressure is part of the
conversion to determine actual gas flow
and the resulting superficial gas velocity
(at operating temperature and pressure). For a fixed superficial gas velocity,
a change in pressure only affects the
density of the gas, and therefore critical
angle increases with pressure.
Similarly, plotting critical angle vs.
temperature for a range of operating
pressures shows that the change in angle with respect to temperature increases with a decrease in pressure. Fig. 3
shows at 300 psia a temperature change
of 1° F. results in a 0.28° change in
critical angle. At 800 psia, however, a
temperature change of 1° F. results in a
0.05° change in critical angle.
The derivative of the modified GRI
02/0057 equation with respect to
temperature not eliminating the effects
of pressure suggests this trend.2 3 The
change in critical angle with respect to
temperature depends on pressure.

Pressure, diam0

eter, and flow rate
are interdependent
variables with
nonlinear responses to temperature changes. An increase
in pressure has the greatest effect on
critical angles at low pressures. Fig. 4
shows that at 300 psia and 70° F., an
increase of 50 psi results in a change in
critical inclination angle of 2.7°. At 750
psia, however, the same shift results in
a change in critical inclination angle of
0.4°. The percentage change in pressure
partially explains this difference. The
shift from 300 to 350 psia results in a
17% pressure change. But the shift from
750 to 800 psia results in a 6% change.
A dependent effect is associated
with the relative inclination angle as a
function of pressure. At lower pressures,
the relative inclination angle is greater
and the corresponding rate of change
of critical angle greater than at higher
pressures, for the reasons discussed.

Detailed examination
The detailed examination site selection process used a combination of
regulatory required sites and additional
sites predicted by flow modeling to
have a potential for internal corrosion.
The company’s written DG-ICDA plan
requires a minimum of four sites be
selected for first-time assessment. When
multiple laterals originating from a
common trunkline are combined as a
single DG-ICDA region, it recommends

selecting detailed examination sites
on each of the laterals. This method
accounts for variability in gas velocity in each of the laterals and verifies
the definition of the entire system as a
single ICDA region.
Seven sites in the company’s system
were selected for detailed examination:
• The first inclination greater than
critical in the first HCA in the DG-ICDA
region.
• An inclination location greater
than critical in an HCA in the second
half of the DG-ICDA region.
• The first critical inclination angle
in the DG-ICDA region.
• A drip receiver at the end of line in
the first half of the DG-ICDA region.
• A 90° inclination inside the station
at a gas purchase point.
• The first inclination in an HCA
after a purchase point at the end of the
first half of the DG-ICDA region.
• A critical inclination angle near the
end of the DG-ICDA region.
Detailed examination at five of the
seven selected sites revealed no internal
corrosion. B-Scan inspection at Site 6
identified internal metal loss. Evaluation
of an additional detailed examination
site 50 ft upstream of the original dig
location occurred based on potential indications discovered during the
inspection screening process. This site
identified a field bend with no internal

corrosion on the upstream side of the
bend and internal metal loss on the
downstream side of the bend. B-Scan
inspection of the drip at Site 4 also
identified internal metal loss.
When metal loss is discovered at
detailed examination sites, additional
sites must be identified to assess the
extent of the affected area and confirm
the most severe damage has been found.
The project team reviewed the seven
sites where direct examination took
place and decided, based on internal
metal loss identified at Site 4 and Site
6, additional examination sites were
necessary.
Site 4 lies at an aboveground pressure vessel with a drip leg at the end of
the line. Inspection identified internal
metal loss and liquids in the drip leg
of the pressure vessel. Subject matter
experts noted that about 5 years before
inspection, the upstream gas supplier
notified the company of a slug of liquids traveling through its line. Station
maintenance personnel stated the drip
leg had not been drained following this
notification. Liquids and internal metal
loss identified here are believed to result
from a one-time liquid upset from the
gas supplier.
Further verification used an additional examination site at a low spot
immediately upstream of the pressure
vessel. The depth of the line at the

location and its proximity to a creek
rendered this work unsuccessful. The
company instead commissioned an inline inspection of the line to determine
if and to what extent additional metal
loss was present.
Site 6 lies at a pipeline inclination
angle greater than critical. This site has
three parallel lines (4-in., 6-in., and
12-in.) in the pipeline right-of-way.
Internal metal loss had occurred on
the oldest of the three lines, a 4.5-in
diameter line installed in 1952. Current
flow conditions made it unlikely liquids
would reach this location.
Subject matter experts verified that
before installation of the 12-in. line
(1970), flow was high enough to push

liquids to the inspection location. As
a result, internal metal loss identified
at this location is likely historical and
not active. Further verification used an
additional examination site upstream
of Site 6. This site lies immediately
after the gas purchase point at the first
pipeline inclination angle greater than
the calculated critical angle determined
by current system flow parameters. Detailed examination of all three parallel
lines found no internal metal loss.

New release of steady state simulation software
A new release of this firm’s steady state
simulation software—ProSimPlus—is now
available.
The software is used in design and
operation of existing plants for process
optimization, units troubleshooting or
debottlenecking, plants revamping, or for
performing front-end engineering analysis. It provides a thermodynamic module
and a comprehensive unit operations
library that allow the modeling of a variety
of processes. It’s suited for chemical,
petrochemical, refining, and gas treatment
operations.
Improvements to this new release focus
on its thermodynamic package, comprehensive set of unit operation models, and
convergence methods. Additionally, a new
an easy to use and learn graphical interface
helps ensure quick learning and optimize
access to simulation results.
Simulis Thermodynamics, the firm’s
thermodynamic server, is fully embedded in ProSimPlus. Beside flexibility in the

definition of thermodynamic profiles used
in the process, this module offers a full
set of functions for the detailed analysis of
the thermophysical phenomena that can
occur in a process. In particular, transport
or thermodynamic properties and phase
equilibria on streams can be calculated
in only a few clicks. The thermodynamic
model library was enriched with equations
of state PR78 and PR78BM and with several calculation services in particular for Reid
vapor pressure, equilibrium constants, and
surface tension or residue curves plotting.
Several unit operation modules such as
the pipe segment or the heat exchanger
were enhanced with additional configuration options or new calculation methods.
In particular, a new interface was built for
the optimization module allowing the user
to configure the calculation parameters
more easily.

New mass ﬂow controller
The B-Series mass flow controller is a
new family of mass flow products designed to be insensitive to fluctuations in
pressure and temperature.
Built on a standard 1.125-in. wide platform with a powerful user interface and
local digital display, the B-Series provides
a compact flow measurement and control
solution that the company says eliminates
the need for costly temperature and pressure control devices and systems.
The B-Series is designed to minimize
all sources of gas flow inaccuracy. It promises accuracy, fast response, stability, and
resistance to flow variation due to pressure
and temperature fluctuations.
The B-Series is a pressure and temperature-insensitive device. The mass flow
controller actively measures line pressure
and adjusts the control valve to virtually eliminate actual flow and flow signal
changes as a result of pressure fluctuations.

Chief executives
boost UN program
on corruption
An important United Nations ﬁght
against corruption received a boost this
month from the chief executives of 24 international companies.
The executives signed a letter to UN
Sec. Gen. Ban Ki-moon supporting the UN
Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)
and calling for action on a crucial but slowmoving program element.
Launched in December 2003, UNCAC

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

addresses prevention, criminalization,
international cooperation, and asset recovery. So far, 140 countries have signed the
convention, and 136 have ratiﬁed it.
The laggard UNCAC element is implementation review, which the ﬁrst Conference of States Parties (COSP), held in 2006,
described as “of paramount importance.”
According to the anticorruption group
Transparency International (TI), a UN working group has been trying to deﬁne the
review mechanism and will meet again on
May 11-13 and Aug. 31-Sept. 2. The issue
will be a priority agenda item at the third
COSP, in Doha the week of Nov. 9.
“Because of the complexity of a
decision-making process involving 140 governments,” TI says, “unless controversial
issues can be resolved well in advance, the
prospects for Doha are poor.”
Implementation became divisive at the
second COSP, held in Bali in January 2008.
Warning against the onset of “a holding
pattern,” a TI press release after that meeting said contentious issues included “the
form a country progress review program
should take” and “terms of the transparency of the process and the participation of
civil society.”
Companies probably see trouble in an
agreement with potential to compromise
their international contracts in any way. At
the same time, they must recognize how
corruption impedes economic development
and weakens the social foundations of
expatriate business.
Signatory companies in the letter calling
for action on an implementation review
mechanism are Anglo American PLC,
AngloGold Ashanti Co., BASF AG, Bhoruka
Power Corp. Ltd., EADS, Fluor Corp., Fuji
Xerox Co. Ltd., GDF Suez, General Electric Co., IKEA Group, Infosys Technologies
Ltd., Kanoria Chemicals & Industries Ltd.,
Li & Fung Group, Newmont Mining Corp.,
Novartis International AG, Petronas, Royal
Dutch Shell PLC, SAP AG, Sinosteel Corp.,

A May rally in energy prices
Energy prices rallied in early May with natural gas climbing above $4/MMbtu and
crude at one point topping $58/bbl—a new high for the year—as traders shrugged
off bearish inventory reports and focused instead on indications of a possible economic turnaround.
In Houston on May 8, analysts at Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, “Money
has been ﬂowing heavy into commodities this week, and it has helped prop up oil
prices as big funds are betting that the worst of the recession is over.” They noted
natural gas prices had rallied more than 30% in less than 2 weeks “despite a string of
bearish data points.” But they said it looked more like a “short squeeze” rather than
a real market bottom.
At KBC Market Services, a division of KBC Process Technology Ltd. in Surrey, UK,
analysts said, “Oil fundamentals do not support such a move [to $56-58/bbl] with
the year-on-year excess in US oil inventories…together with oil in ﬂoating storage amounting to 225 million bbl.” In the week ended May 1, US reﬁners ran more
crude and feedstock than in any week since Dec. 5, 2008. “However, total petroleum
demand on a 4-week basis was still the lowest since May 1999,” said analysts at
Pritchard Capital Partners LLC, New Orleans.
Unemployment numbers
Meanwhile, Automatic Data Processing Inc. reported US nonfarm private employment decreased by 491,000 in April on a seasonally adjusted basis, compared with
a revised drop of 708,000 in March. The US Department of Labor reported 601,000
new applications for jobless beneﬁts in the week ended May 1, the smallest increase
in 14 weeks and a possible indication that layoffs have peaked. Nonetheless, the
total number of people receiving unemployment beneﬁts climbed to 6.35 million.
In a separate report, the government said US productivity grew at an annual rate of
0.8%—better than economists expected—in this year’s ﬁrst quarter.
Pritchard Capital Partners said, “Recent economic data releases continue to show
an increase in economic activity and at some point…we should see an increase in
demand for both crude and gasoline.”
However, Raymond James analysts said, “We continue to think the fundamentals
look pretty poor in the domestic market and that many of the stocks could be getting
ahead of themselves.”
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, said, “On the fundamental side, a
crude oil price of $50-60/bbl should make about zero difference on the demand side
of the equation. Retailers have not been passing the entirety of the price drop to the
consumer, and Western governments have not been pushing them to do so in order
to preserve some of the energy efﬁciency gains. Hence there is some room for a
price increase in futures before the consumer gets hit on the retail side.”
Jakob said, “On the supply side a price of $60/bbl rather than $50/bbl could
provide some lower compliance [among members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries], but the main cheaters are already leaking at $50/bbl so the
net difference will be hard to immediately measure.” He said, “In the end, what will
make the sustainability of $60/bbl or of $50/bbl will be the size and the sustainability
of the crude oil contango.”
Natural gas rebound?
Meanwhile, Pritchard Capital Partners said conference calls by exploration and
production companies indicated industry executives expect natural gas will rebound
late this year or early in 2010. They reported, “Mark Papa, CEO of EOG Resources
Inc., said he sees US natural gas production down 4.5 bcfd [of gas equivalent] by the
end of 2009.” That, the analysts noted, is in contrast to PIRA [Petroleum Industry Research Associates] Energy Group’s estimated decline of 3 bcfed. “If Papa’s comments
are correct, the bottom for natural gas may be near,” said analysts.
They said Bob R. Simpson, founder and chief executive of XTO Energy Inc. in Fort
Worth, indicated he expects the price of natural gas to double by next May.
In other news, Raymond James analysts reported China approved a plan to set up
10 million tons of reﬁned fuel state reserves by 2011 as part of its economic stimulus
plan. At China’s current consumption, it would provide 2 weeks of gasoline, diesel,
and kerosine combined. Jakob said, “Early indications are that China in April printed
another record in car sales (according to our tracking that would amount to about
25% growth in April sales for all automobiles and 37% for passenger cars) and continues the recent trend of selling more cars than the US.”

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

REGISTER TODAY!

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.
Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil supply.
They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs during periods of lower oil prices, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling
air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions, mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to these challenges, the oil sands and heavy oil industry continues to develop unconventional
resources that are critical to meeting the world’s long-term needs for reliable hydrocarbon supplies.
Continued progress in oil sands and heavy oil producing technologies means progress in ensuring a dependable supply of
petroleum products at a time when traditional recovery methods are strained by additional demand from rapidly developing
industrial nations.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make this
innovation and progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience. Join the Oil & Gas
Journal and our conference attendees in Calgary this summer for the third annual Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies
Conference and Exhibition.

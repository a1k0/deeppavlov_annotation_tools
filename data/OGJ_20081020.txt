COVER
Government and industry believe US oil shale resources are vast,
but the volume that might eventually be classified as proved reserves
hinges upon demonstration of commercial production. Oil & Gas
Journal’s special report Untapped Hydrocarbon Resources, which
begins on p. 22, discusses oil shale research and testing by various
oil companies.The cover shows some early research by Shell Exploration & Production Co. Unconventional Gas at its Mahogany
Demonstration Project in the northern Piceance basin in northwest
Colorado. In both that project and subsequent testing, Shell inserts
electric heaters underground to convert kerogen in the shale to
producible hydrocarbons. Photo from Shell.

E&Y: Alternate energy investments could slow
The credit crunch and falling oil prices could dampen investment in alternate energy companies until stock markets again stabilize, said speakers at an Ernst & Young energy forum on Oct. 9.
Investment momentum for solar, wind, and other alternate
forms of energy could slow if oil prices continue to drop, said Dan
Pickering, head of research for Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
Before the credit crunch started, alternate energy was very popular in the US, he noted.
“The perception of the American public is alternative energy is
very sexy to fund and very cool to do,” Pickering said. “But don’t
forget about grandpa. Grandpa is conventional energy.”
Alternate energy still needs traditional fossil fuel as a backup
for days when the sun does not shine or the wind does not blow,
Pickering said.
Joseph Muscat, Ernst & Young Americas director of venture capital, said access to capital could become more difficult for alternate
energy companies. For instance, he noted that initial public offerings for such companies essentially stopped in July.
Venture capital funds are attracted to clean technology energy
companies, Muscat said, adding that only software companies get a
bigger share of global joint venture investment than clean technology energy companies.
On a US level, Muscat noted that government subsidies and tax
credits for renewals appear to be here to stay. The $700 billion federal bailout package recently approved by the US Congress renewed
subsidies and tax credits for wind, solar, and biofuels.
President George W. Bush signed an 8-year extension of tax
credits for investments into solar energy and a 1-year extension for
investments into wind energy.

IEA again trims global oil demand forecast
The International Energy Agency, Paris, has again trimmed its
global oil demand forecast.
In its monthly oil market report for October, IEA cut its outlook
for oil demand in 2008 by 240,000 b/d, and reduced the 2009
outlook by 440,000 b/d.
The new projections come as a result of weaker-than-expected
oil deliveries to member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development during July and August and
in light of the International Monetary Fund’s downward revisions
to 2009 global gross domestic product assumptions, which foresee

Exploration

no US economic growth in 2009.
IEA now expects world oil demand to average 86.5 million b/d
in 2008, up 400,000 b/d from last year, and 87.2 million b/d in
2009.
Oil demand in the OECD will average 48.1 million b/d in 2008,
down 2.2% vs. 2007, and 47.5 million b/d in 2009. Revisions
to both North America and Pacific data were significant, IEA said,
as rapidly weakening economic conditions, financial turmoil, and
high prices should have a marked impact upon OECD demand,
most notably in the US.
Meanwhile, oil demand outside the OECD is forecast to average
38.4 million b/d in 2008, up 4.2% from a year earlier, and 39.7
million b/d in 2009, or 40,000 b/d higher than projected in IEA’s
previous monthly report. This minor upward revision is related to
stronger-than-expected demand in almost all non-OECD regions.
Overall, non-OECD demand growth should continue to offset the
severe OECD demand contraction, IEA said.
Oil demand is forecast to post moderate growth next year in the
former Soviet Union, China, Latin America, and the Middle East.
IEA expects oil demand in other non-OECD Asian countries and
Africa to increase as well during 2009.

Barclays forecasts 2009 E&P spending
Investment bank Barclays Capital on Oct. 14 released estimates
for 2009 exploration and production spending and bases its findings on reduced oil and natural gas prices.
Barclays analysts James Crandell and James West in New York
reduced their forecast for oil next year to $75/bbl from a previous
forecast of $90/bbl. Their gas forecast now stands at $7/Mcf, down
from $8.50/Mcf.
Based on these average price levels, they estimate that E&P
spending in North America will drop 15% in 2009 vs. 2008 levels,
while E&P spending elsewhere will increase 20% next year.
The new oil price forecast remains above threshold pricing for
most international projects, both onshore and offshore.
“We had previously expected spending to increase in North
America during 2009; however, lower natural gas prices due to
supply growth, announced budget cuts, pressure on cash flows,
credit market issues, and concerns about demand growth have led
us to revise our forecast,” the analysts said. Crandell and West estimate that a 15% decline in E&P spending in the US will lead to a
drop in the rig count of about 400 rigs from today’s levels. ✦

BP lets development contract for In Salah ﬁelds
BP Exploration (El Djazair) Ltd. has let a front-end engineering
and design contract to Foster Wheeler Ltd. for development of the
southern fields of the In Salah project in Algeria.
The value of the contract was not disclosed.
Foster Wheeler’s contract underpins the second phase of the In
Salah gas (ISG) development, which is the largest dry gas joint
venture development in Algeria. It will update design; develop the
technical data, specifications, and requisitions; and provide a detailed cost estimate for the engineering, procurement, and construction scope of work.
Under the second phase, gas output will be maintained at plateau levels when production from the three northern fields starts
to drop. “It involves the development of the four fields to the south
of the current development, Garet el Befinat, Hassi Moumene, In
Salah and Gour Mahmoud, located near the town of In Salah in the
Walia of Tamanrasset,” Foster Wheeler said (see map, OGJ, Dec. 4,
2000, p. 45).
ISG currently produces 9 billion cu m/year from three northern
fields. Seven proved gas fields are under development in the southern Sahara, 1,200 km south of Algiers. ISG is also the world’s first
full-scale carbon dioxide capture project at an onshore gas field.
The partners in the ISG venture are Sonatrach, BP, and StatoilHydro.

BP has Freedom deepwater ﬁnd in Gulf of Mexico
BP America Inc. has discovered oil for the third time in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico and will appraise it to determine its size
and commerciality.
The Freedom discovery, 70 miles southeast of Louisiana, is on
Mississippi Canyon Block 948 in 6,100 ft of water. It follows BP
finds in nearby Tubular Bells and Kodiak fields. The well reached
29,280 ft TD and encountered more than 550 net ft of hydrocarbon-bearing sands in Middle and Lower Miocene reservoirs.
“We believe that Freedom straddles Mississippi Canyon Block
948 (BP, operator) and Mississippi Canyon Block 992 (BHP, operator 32.25% and BP 67.75%),” said Andy Inglis, BP chief executive,
E&P.
BP Exploration & Production Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
BP America Inc., operates the exploration well on Block 948 with
a 25% working interest. Its partners are Noble Energy Inc. with a
37.5% interest, Samson Offshore Co. 25%, and Marathon Oil Co.
12.5%.
Noble Energy and Samson Offshore acquired the lease at federal
OCS Lease Sale 198 in March 2006.

BP makes oil ﬁnd on Block 31 off Angola
BP Exploration (Angola) Ltd. has made an oil find with its
Dione exploration well, which was drilled in the ultradeep waters of Block 31 off Angola.
The Dione well, which tested more than 5,000 b/d of oil under
production conditions, lies on the southern portion of the block
and is the sixteenth discovery to date for BP off Angola. The well
lies 9 km southwest of the Juno-1 discovery, which tested at a mechanically restricted rate of 2,676 b/d of oil in 2005.
Dione reached 3,272 m TD and was drilled in 1,696 m of water
about 390 km northwest of Luanda.
Block 31 covers 5,349 sq km and lies in 1,500-2,500 m of
water.
Sonangol is the concessionaire of Block 31 with a 20% interest.
BP operates the block with a 26.67% stake. Other partners are Esso
Exploration & Production Angola (Block 31) Ltd. 25%, Statoil Angola AS 13.33%, Marathon International Petroleum Angola Block
31 Ltd. 10%, and Total SA unit TEPA (Block 31) Ltd. 5%.

Anadarko reports presalt discovery off Brazil
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. has reported a presalt discovery at
the Wahoo prospect in the Campos basin off Brazil.
The 1-APL-1-ESS discovery well on Block BM-C-30 lies in 4,650
ft of water 25 miles southeast of and syncline separated from Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s (Petrobras) previously announced presalt discoveries at giant Jubarte field off Espirito Santo state.
Preliminary Wahoo results, based on wireline logs, indicate at
least 195 ft of net pay with play characteristics similar to those
of the nearby Jubarte 1-ESS-103A well. It is Brazil’s first producing presalt field having recently achieved reported initial rates of
18,000 b/d of light oil (OGJ Online, Sept. 2, 2008).
“Our first operated presalt test in Brazil is a resounding success as we’re seeing data that mirrors other very significant presalt
discoveries in this prolific area,” said Bob Daniels, Anadarko senior
vice-president of worldwide exploration. “It’s still early in the process, and we plan to continue drilling toward additional targeted
objectives to a total depth of approximately 20,000 ft. The positive
results so far provide encouragement and validate our decision to
relocate the Transocean Deepwater Millennium drillship to Brazil
to execute our ongoing presalt exploration program, which includes at least four additional wells in the deepwater Campos and
Espirito Santo basins through the middle of next year.”
The Wahoo well is drilling at about 18,400 ft. To fulfill the work
program, the partners have run a full suite of wireline logs, including porosity tools. The partners plan to conduct additional logging,
including pressure and fluid sampling, once the well reaches total
depth, with the potential to conduct a drillstem test at a later date.
After completing operations at Wahoo, Anadarko plans to move
the Deepwater Millennium to the Serpa prospect, where it holds a
30% working interest, to reenter the BM-ES-24 well. The well initially encountered presalt hydrocarbon-bearing zones in secondary
objectives but did not reach the primary objective because of rig
limitations.
Anadarko, through a wholly owned subsidiary, holds a 30%
working interest in and is operator of BM-C-30. Devon Energy
Corp. holds 25%; EnCana Brasil Petroleo Ltd., a wholly owned

API: Third quarter US completions up 16%
US oil and gas drilling continued to outpace year-ago activity
during the third quarter and is nearly twice the levels seen during
the 1990s, the American Petroleum Institute said Oct. 10.
During the 3 months ended Sept. 30, an estimated 16,379 oil
wells, natural gas wells, and dry holes were completed—16% more
than the comparable 2007 period, API said in its latest quarterly
well completion report.
It said the estimates show that the resurgence in US oil well
drilling that began in 2000 has continued during 2008. An estimated 6,244 oil wells were completed this past quarter, 34% more
than in 2007’s third quarter and the highest third-quarter domestic
oil activity estimate in more than 2 decades, API indicated.
Gas continued to be the primary domestic drilling target. An estimated 8,467 wells were completed during the third quarter, 6%
more than in the same period a year earlier and more than double
the number 10 years ago, it continued.
Estimated exploratory well completions increased 8% year-toyear, while the estimated number of development wells drilled
climbed 17% year-to-year, largely because of a 36% surge in oil
development wells from 2007’s third quarter, according to API.

StatoilHydro to install Marulk production system
StatoilHydro will select the concept and install the production
system for Marulk gas-condensate field in the Norwegian Sea under an agreement signed with operator Eni Norge.
The field, which is estimated to hold 80-120 million boe, will
be tied in to the Norne vessel, utilizing idle capacity.
Oivind Dahl-Stamnes, vice-president for StatoilHydro’s partneroperated fields said StatoilHydro would realize synergies from the
agreement because it has worked on similar projects in the same
area, which will help to reduce costs.
Marulk, appraised in January, is on PL 122 about 21 km southwest of Norne field at Haltenbanken. Exploration well 6507/2-4

Petroperu again delays Talara reﬁnery upgrade bid news of alleged irregularities in the country’s latest bidding round,
Recent alleged irregularities at Peru’s state-owned Petroperu
have led the company to further extend to Oct. 30 its deadline
for bids on the front-end engineering design and the engineering,
procurement, and construction of facilities to modernize its Talara
refinery at Piura, 1,200 km north of the country’s capital Lima.
The delay, one of several in recent weeks, apparently stems from

which led to the resignation of Energy and Mines Minister Juan
Valdiva, along with Petroperu head Cesar Gutierrez.
Their resignations came after Pres. Alan Garcia fired Petroperu
board member Alberto Quimper Herrera, allegedly for participating in a kickback scheme with Discover Petroleum in the recent
bids for oil exploration licenses.
In September Petroperu extended the bidding deadline to Oct.

15 from Oct. 3. Petroperu said it intended to present the contract
on Oct. 29.
At the time, Gutierrez said the Talara modernization project was
part of a wider effort to double Peru’s production. To do so, he said,
Petroperu would have to modernize the Talara refinery at a cost of
$1 billion and start production from the 12 blocks where petroleum exploration is taking place (OGJ Online, Sept. 16, 2008).
Modernization of the Talara refinery will include revamping existing units and adding facilities for desulfurization of diesel and
gasoline, production of sulfuric acid, and electricity generation. According to the US Energy Administration, the capacity of the facility
is to be increased to 90,000-100,000 b/d from 62,000 b/d.

PDVSA breaks ground on Santa Ines reﬁnery
Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), aiming to process more of the country’s heavy oil at home, has begun
construction of the 100,000-b/d Santa Ines refinery, located in the
state of Barinas.
The refinery will help the country “achieve economic independence, financial independence as banks and stock markets in the US
and Europe sink,” said Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. “Latin
America has finally begun assuming its course,” he said.
The complex, valued at some $1.2 billion, is being developed in
two phases: the first is scheduled for completion in 2011 with an
initial capacity of 30,000 b/d, while the second will be reached in
2014, bringing the plant to full capacity.
The facility will refine crude oil from Barinas and Apure states,
as well as oil from the Orinoco heavy crude belt. It will produce
regular and high-octane gasoline, LPG, diesel, kerosine, fuel oil,
and asphalt.
Rafael Ramirez, who doubles as PDVSA president and Venezu-

elan energy minister, said the new refinery will refine mostly crude
oil for the domestic market.
Santa Ines is one of four domestic refineries either under way
or planned. The others include the 50,000-b/d Caripito refinery,
a 200,000-b/d refinery in the state of Zulia, and a 400,000-b/d
refinery at Cabruta.
In September, Chavez said his country and China plan to construct two refineries, one in each country. Chavez said the Venezuelan refinery will be built in the Orinoco basin (OGJ Online, Sept.
23, 2008).

FACTS: Asia ethylene capacity to rise 60% by 2015
The Asia-Pacific region is experiencing a massive expansion
during which it will increase its ethylene production capacity to
more than 64 million tonnes/year (tpy) from 40 million tpy by
2015, according to a report from FACTS Global Energy, Honolulu.
The report, “Asia’s Petrochemical Industry: Implications for Future Naphtha Demand,” said a wave of additions will take place
during 2009-11, with strong peaks in first-quarter and fourthquarter 2009.
Most of the new capacity will be added in China. The secondlargest global producer of ethylene, China will add 14 million tpy
by 2015 to its existing 10 million tpy of production capacity. “Firm
and likely additions” will occur mainly in 2009 (4.95 million tpy)
and 2011 (3.8 million tpy), according to the report.
China will increase its naphtha consumption from to about
825,000 by 2010 and more than 1.1 million b/d in 2015 from
600,000 b/d in 2007.Because most of the new ethylene production capacity is based on naphtha feedstocks, its consumption also
will increase greatly. China will become the largest naphtha consumer in Asia by 2011, according to the report. ✦

KMEP completes ethanol test, begins biodiesel
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP has successfully completed
tests to determine the commercial viability of moving batched
denatured ethanol between Tampa and Orlando in the 195-mile,
16-in. gasoline line on its Central Florida Pipeline (CFP) system.
It is finalizing mechanical modifications to the pipeline to offer
ethanol transportation services to its customers by mid-November
and is evaluating batched ethanol transport possibilities for other
parts of its pipeline system.
The company says the short length of the pipeline will limit
transmix.
CFP has segregated storage for the ethanol at the Orlando end of
the pipeline. Total storage capacity is 546,000 bbl, contained in 28
tanks of 8,190 gal—80,000 bbl each. Land is available for expansion (OGJ Online, Apr. 9, 2008).
Kinder Morgan has completed more than $60 million in ethanol projects including modifications to tanks, truck racks, and
related infrastructure for new or expanded ethanol service in the
Southeast US and Pacific Northwest and has approved an additional
$27 million for ethanol projects in the Southeast.
The company is also undertaking tests to assess commercial

B-5 biodiesel through a segment of its Plantation Pipe Line system
between Collins, Miss., and Spartanburg, SC. The company expects
test results by the end of October. It also is evaluating transporting
biodiesel on its Portland-Eugene, Ore., line to support Oregon’s
forthcoming biodiesel mandate.

Appalachian gas projects starting up
East Tennessee Natural Gas plans to have added 95 MMcfd of
contracted long-term, firm capacity on its pipeline system in the
Central Appalachian basin by yearend.
Spectra Energy Partners LP, Houston, said its ETNG affiliate has
placed the Glade Spring project into service in southwestern Virginia. With the improvements to the Glade Spring compressor station and related facilities, contracts associated with the project took
effect on Oct. 1. Glade Spring is just south of ETNG’s Saltville gas
storage field.
The CNX and Greenway/Nora projects, also in southwestern
Virginia, are expected to be available for service on Nov. 1 and Dec.
1, respectively.
Transportation services under the three contracts are slated to
increase to 134 MMcfd in 2010. ✦

and as a percentage of global GDP.
They examined how many barrels of
oil could be purchased with respect to
per capita income in the G7 countries
and found that in 1970, oil was about
$3.30/bbl and income averaged about
$3,700, sufficient to buy 1,000 bbl/
year of oil.
But in July, when crude futures
peaked above $145/bbl, affordability dropped such that incomes could
purchase only 307 bbl. So for crude oil
affordability to return to its long-run
average, the price would have to fall
to $45/bbl, which would allow the
average G7 consumer to buy just over
1,000 bbl of oil.
Deutsche Bank also looked at the oil
price required to balance budgets in
key oil exporting countries to provide
insight into how low oil prices could
go. Sensitivity of the oil price to government finances is different for every
country.
The analysts note that it’s no surprise that as oil prices have fallen below
$95/bbl, the price needed to balance
the budgets of Venezuela and Iran, the
rhetoric from those two countries has
grown louder in calling for action to
defend the price. The Deutsche Bank
report finds that Saudi Arabia requires
an oil price of $55/bbl to balance its
budget, while Russia’s balancing point
is $70/bbl.
As the table shows, given the various
price indicators, Sieminski and Lewis
determine that as long as economic
growth is anemic and demand destruction risks continue to drive commodity
prices lower, a price of about $60/bbl
could represent an arresting point for
crude. ✦

The crisis and capitalism
An extra hazard lurks in the turmoil that has
engulfed the global financial system. It’s the notion
that the crisis repudiates market capitalism. Governments everywhere must resist the political temptations of this misjudgment.
The idea that capitalism’s validity died along
with various financial luminaries sprouts from two
intellectual seeds. One of them is latent socialism.
The belief that the state should play a central role
in the economy, including outright ownership of

The quest for commercial viability
of oil shale ultimately could prove the

These five leases involve in situ
development in Colorado. BLM also
approved a lease in Utah for Oil Shale

companies are researching various heat
techniques. Chevron is focusing on
chemistry to unlock the oil from the
shale’s kerogen.

Avoiding the boom-bust
Companies have extracted oil shale

said leases are unlikely to be issued for
years (see sidebar).
Government reports suggest oil shale
development could add as much as 800
billion bbl of oil to US reserves. Worldwide, the oil shale resource base is
estimated at 2.6 trillion bbl total and is
found in more than 20 countries (OGJ,

Electricity would be conducted from
one end of the fracture to the other,
making the fracture a resistive heating element. Heat would flow from
the fracture into the oil shale formation, gradually converting kerogen, the
shale’s solid organic matter, into oil and
gas that could be produced by conventional methods.
Oil companies involved in ongoing
oil shale research emphasized the need
to avoid boom-bust cycles. Industry
spokesmen told OGJ that any successful
oil shale technology must be sustainable
throughout the ups and downs of oil
prices.
“The boom-bust cycle issue really
relates to the recovery cost of oil shale,”
said Robert Lestz, Chevron’s oil shale
technology manager. “We’ve taken a
slightly different approach than our
predecessors. We looked at this in a holistic process from the resources in the
ground to the transportation fuel in the
end. What is that energy balance you
get from the resource to the finished
product?”
He emphasizes the need to develop
and maintain a sense of cooperation
with the local community regarding
environmental, social, and economic
issues. Regional feedback helps Chevron develop its technical and business
perspectives, Lestz said.
“Chevron said we need to develop a
technology that will be much less energy intensive, environmentally responsible, and economically sustainable,” he
said. “If we can have a process that is
sustainable, then we alleviate the issues
of boom-bust.”
Tracy Boyd, communications and
sustainability manager for Shell’s
Mahogany Shale Project near Meeker,
Colo., agrees.
“The US has long known of this
significant hydrocarbon resource, but
past attempts have failed to develop the
resource in an economically viable and
environmentally and socially responsible manner,” Boyd said.
Previously, Shell said oil shale would
be economic if prices for conventional
oil were $30-35/bbl on the New York

Mercantile Exchange. But Boyd said the
company stopped making such forecasts.
There simply are too many unknowns today to accurately forecast the
economics of future commercial oil
shale projects, he said.
“You tell me what the economic
atmosphere is going to look like 15
years from now,” Boyd said. “What are
going to be the costs of construction,
services, and other oil field support?
What are going to be the environmental
requirements of the time? What will be
the status of global warming and carbon controls on projects? There are just
too many variables now to say at some
point in the future if oil price is X, we
can do it, and if it’s Y, we can’t.”

Shell runs freeze wall test
Shell has researched oil shale development methods for 27 years and
has run field tests on private land near
Meeker, Colo., since 1996.
“We envision that it will be at least

the middle of the next decade and possibly longer before we would be making a decision to move forward with a
commercial scale project,” Boyd said.
Shell’s patented In situ Conversion
Process was tested on an area measuring
30 ft by 40 ft. Shell recovered 1,700 bbl
of light oil plus associated gas, indicating its proprietary process generates
more oil from a smaller surface area
than previous oil shale processes.
Boyd said the in situ heating process
can recover 60% of hydrocarbons in the
shale compared with 28-30% recovered
using traditional mining and retort processes. In situ does not involve open-pit
mining.
Shell inserts electric heaters underground to convert kerogen in the shale
to producible hydrocarbons that can be
collected and pumped to the surface.
Rock is heated slowly to 650-750° F.

development.

Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer

Water, carbon balance

Oil companies researching oil shale
development are watching the unfolding of US leasing and environmental
regulatory policies that could inﬂuence
the economics of producing unconventional petroleum resources, said the
National Oil Shale Association.
GlennVawter, executive director of
National Oil Shale Association in Glenwood Springs, Colo., said technological
advances have sharply reduced possible negative environmental consequences of production processes.
Yet, questions still remain about
how much energy would be used and
how much carbon dioxide could be
emitted if commercial oil shale projects
are undertaken in the US.
“Oil shale developers are actively
engaged in research, development, and
planning for the best methods to manage the carbon that will be produced
during production,” Vawter said, adding
that sequestration technology could
contain the CO2 emitted.
He notes that “the means and cost
of disposing of or sequestering vast
amounts of CO2 poses a signiﬁcant
challenge. Lastly, the cost of meeting

delivery system for that chemistry.”
Researchers are looking at several
different types of chemical delivery
techniques. One possibility is injecting CO2 under high pressure underground.
“There are other things that we also
are evaluating at this time,” he said.
“CO2 has a lot of advantages, but CO2
by itself is not going to really solve
our problems. It’s the additives that we
add to the CO2 that creates the uniqueness.”
The idea is for the CO2 and additives to act as a solvent that will pull

The US Bureau of Land Management
issued a ﬁnal programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) on
Sept. 4 to guide the use of public land
containing oil shale and tar sands in
Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming.
The document, which BLM developed under Sec. 369[d] and [c] of the
2005 Energy Policy Act, amends 12
land-use plans to set aside 1.9 million
acres of public land for potential commercial oil shale development, the US
Department of the Interior agency said.
The PEIS identiﬁes the most promising areas on federal land in the three
states that would be open to applications for commercial leasing.
Multiple steps have yet to be completed before any oil shale lease sale
would happen, BLM has said. Spokesmen with oil companies suggest that it
could take 5-10 years to ﬁnalize regulations, and that leasing might start
toward the end of the next decade.
Vawter said that completion of oil
shale leasing regulations would give oil
companies “the ground rules on leases
and bonus payments, which would
help companies decide if they want to

“The interest in the CO2 for oil shale
again comes back to the environmental side knowing it’s a very clean, inert
type product to put into the ground
and there will be minimal invasiveness
from an environmental perspective,”
Lestz said.
He said it’s too early to discuss what

Researchers at the Sandia National
Laboratories in Albuquerque are analyzing the lifecycle carbon footprint
and the water required to fully extract
hydrocarbons from oil shale, they said
in comments prepared for a recent Oil
Shale Symposium in Golden, Colo.,
organized by the Colorado Energy
Research Institute and the Colorado
School of Mines.
“Extracting unconventional petroleum reserves can be relatively water
and energy intensive, which could
result in correspondingly greater environmental impacts when the process is
scaled up to the billions of gallons (and
trillions globally) of potential petroleum in place,” Sandia researchers said.
When considering the oil shale of
Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, it is estimated that production could require
3 gal of water or more for every barrel
produced, they said, noting this would
add to competition for the heavily used
water in the Colorado River basin.
Researchers said they are working to
develop metrics based on production
of unconventional oil, including the
cost per barrel, the volume of water per
barrel, and the volume of CO2 emitted per barrel depending upon which
process might be used.

other types of delivery techniques are
being considered because that research
still is in its early stages.
Lestz said commercial oil shale
production “is definitely many years
out… It’s not a short-term solution. It’s
an answer for tomorrow, not an answer
for today.”
He is encouraged by the fact that
many companies are approaching oil
shale research from many different
ways.
“The actual answer at the end of the
day may lie between all these technologies,” he said. ✦

The Tasnee ethylene plant in Al-Jubail, Saudi Arabia, achieved on-spec ethylene
production on August 23, 2008 following mechanical completion on July 15, 2008,
which is six weeks ahead of schedule.
The plant which was built for Saudi Ethylene and Polyethylene Company (SEPC) by
the consortium Linde Engineering and Samsung Engineering Co. Ltd., with Fluor as PMC,
has a capacity of 1 MM MTA.
This remarkable success was achieved due to outstanding execution by Linde and
Samsung in a difcult environment with a shortage of qualied manpower and tight
markets for material and equipment supply. The cracker of SEPC, a joint venture of
Tasnee, Sahara and Basell, is the rst cracker to come on stream several months ahead
of other cracker projects in Saudi Arabia which were also awarded in 2005.
With this success Linde and Samsung clearly demonstrate their leading position in
technology and project execution in the Middle East.

Brazil to offer fewer blocks for December auction
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Brazil’s National Petroleum Agency
(ANP), apparently bowing to pressure
from the government, has reduced the
number of exploration and production

concession blocks to be auctioned at
the 10th round, scheduled for Dec. 18.
ANP published a notice in the Federal
Register that 130 blocks in eight sectors
and seven sedimentary basins would be
auctioned, down from previous notification of 162 blocks in 11 sectors and

nine sedimentary basins.
ANP did not disclose its reasons for
reducing the acreage scheduled for the
auction. However, there has been concern in the country to restrict the availability of acreage in the presalt region

Tanker loading platform
The start-up of the P-51 platform
coincides with reports that Petrobras
also has begun operations at its new
$837 million tanker loading terminal in
the Campos basin. The loading terminal
is a facet of the company’s master plan
to export large quantities of oil from
Roncador and Marlim fields over the
next 2 decades.
The Brazilian firm has commissioned
the PRA-1 autonomous repumping
platform in waters east of Rio de Janeiro
and plans to begin oil exports through
the new system this month.
The repumping platform is designed
to receive crude from four deepwater
floating production systems: the P-51
platform in Marlim Sul field; the P-53
floating production, storage, and offloading vessel in Marlim Leste field;
and—once they are installed—the P-52
and P-55 production platforms in Roncador field.
The PRA-1 platform will offload the
crude to tankers via the Modec-owned
Cidade de Macae floating storage and
offloading vessel, starting with oil that
is coming from the P-52 platform.
Modec will operate for 20 years the
Cidade de Macae, which was converted
from a very large crude carrier and can
store as much as 2.1 million bbl of oil.
Next year, oil will also be loaded
onto tankers from two floating terminals near the PRA-1 platform, which
is designed to transfer as much as
810,000 b/d of oil when all four of the
deepwater production units operate at
peak rates. ✦

T

he Japanese government, aiming
to reduce the country’s dependence on oil and natural gas, has cast
its eyes far and wide for new sources
of energy.
Oil and gas are still playing a part
in Japan’s energy diplomacy as in
Mongolia, where a deal was struck
for a 44,000 b/d refinery—the nation’s first—to be built in Darhan
with Japanese assistance.
The aim of the refinery is to reduce Mongolia’s dependence on foreign oil products. That’s a step in the
right direction, perhaps, but it does
not change the fact that Mongolia so
far has no oil resources of its own.
As a result, Mongolia’s president
recently forged an agreement with
his counterpart in Kazakhstan for the
delivery of 1-1.5 million tonnes/year
of oil for processing in the planned
refinery.

“It is particularly important that new
uranium deposits are brought on
stream because reserves at deposits
currently in production are going to
run down by 2020.”
The rapid increase in uranium demand now expected follows a recent
decision by the Nuclear Supplier’s
Group and International Atomic Energy Agency that will allow India to
import nuclear fuel and technology.

Demand rising

Spurred by competition from
India, to say nothing of China, the
increased demand for uranium means
that Japan is keen to finalize supply
agreements with producers to meet
its own import requirements of 9,000
tpy. The Japanese visit to Ulaanbaatar
was clearly geared toward that end,
and the refinery—without putting
too cynical an edge on things—was

US House panel’s minority report disputes ﬁndings
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US House Natural Resources
Committee’s minority staff released
its own report on Oct. 9 challenging
one which the majority staff issued 6
months ago that has been the basis of
many 2008 Democratic candidates’
energy stands.
The new report, “Drilling for Truth
and Coming Up Empty,” highlights major flaws and inaccuracies in the committee majority staff’s document which
Democrats from House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi (Calif.) to presidential nominee
Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.) have cited,
according to Rep. Don Young (R-Alas.),
the NRC’s ranking minority member.
The majority’s report contained unsupported and undocumented extrapolations regarding oil and gas resources
contained in nonproducing federal
acreage that has already been leased, he
continued. It illustrates a lack of knowledge about the onshore and offshore
leasing process, costs to the lessee to
acquire acreage, the nature of oil and
gas deposits, and the time required to
explore and, if a discovery is made,
develop the lease, Young said.
“Our analysis pulls together all of
the facts about leases issued on federal
lands. These findings clearly outline the
numerous misrepresentations in the
majority’s report,” he maintained.
The minority staff’s report used
information from the US Department
of Energy, Department of the Interior,
Energy Information Administration,
Minerals Management Service, Bureau
of Land Management, US Geological
Survey, and other federal sources, Young
said.

Minority’s conclusions
Young said the report shows that
more domestic drilling yields more
domestic resources, that the federal
government profits from high oil and
32

gas prices, that drilling for more
domestic oil and gas will help lower
prices and reduce US dependence on
imports, and that only 4% of the total
2.46 billion-acre federal mineral estate
is leased for oil and gas exploration and
development.
The minority staff’s report said that
in 2007, committee chairman Nick
J. Rahall (D-W.Va.), held hearings “to
examine the rapid oil and gas development that has taken place on our nation’s land in recent years.” These were
used to justify legislation increasing
the drilling permit application process
timeline from 30 to 90 days, repealing
provisions in the 2005 Energy Policy
Act designed to help regulatory agencies coordinate and facilitate oil and gas
projects’ permits, and increasing costs
for producers to do business with the
government and DOI in leasing administration and royalty programs.
When gasoline prices doubled in
2008 and voters began to demand
more access to energy resources on
federal acreage, the majority blamed
“Big Oil” and claimed that the industry
was stockpiling drilling permits and
leases, the minority staff’s report said.
It challenged the majority staff report’s
conclusion that the increased number of
drilling permits (from 3,802 in 2005
to 7,561 in 2007) shows that “the
federal government has consistently
encouraged the development of its oil
and gas resources.”
In fact, said the new report, onshore
acres leased from the early 1990s to the
present are less than one-third the total
leased during the early 1980s, while
offshore acres lease dropped dramatically after Congress began to enact moratoriums in 1982.
It also challenged the majority
report’s conclusion that opening additional federal acreage to leasing is not
justified because producers can’t keep
pace with the rate of permits that are

being issued. The earlier report said that
BLM issued 28,776 permits to drill on
public land from 2004 through 2007,
but only 18,954 wells were actually
drilled. “That means that companies
have stockpiled nearly 10,000 extra
permits to drill that they are not using
to increase domestic production,” the
majority staff’s report said.

‘No incentive to stockpile’
But the minority staff’s study found
that before BLM issued revised Onshore
Order No. 1 in 2007, federal drilling
permits were good for only 1-2 years.
Consequently, any issued in 2004 and
2005 which were not utilized have
expired and those that were issued in
2006 will expire this year. “Anyone
who was unable to use [a drilling
permit] before it expired will have to
reapply and wait for BLM approval before proceeding with drilling. So the life
of [a drilling permit] is limited and oil
prices are high; there is no incentive or
ability to stockpile [drilling permits],”
it said.
Onshore drilling permits which BLM
issues now are good for 2-4 years, an
amount of time necessary to deal with
stipulations limiting when an area can
be drilled to accommodate wildlife
mating, nesting and migration, the minority staff’s report continued.
It also questioned the majority staff’s
conclusions that only about 13 million
of the 47.5 million onshore acres and
10.5 million of the 44 million offshore
acres which the oil and gas industry has
leased from the federal government are
actually producing. “Oil and gas companies would not buy leases to this land
without believing oil and gas can be
produced there, yet these same companies are not producing oil and gas from
those areas already under control,” the
earlier report said.
The report pointed out that the
leasing, exploration, and development
process goes through several stages

where permits are acquired, financing is obtained, and geophysical and
exploratory tests are conducted. “Any
one stage can take 6 months to 3-4
years to complete,” it indicated. Only 1
well in 10 is successful in new onshore
fields (compared with 9.5 wells in 10
in developed onshore fields), while the
success rate is 1 in 3 in offshore shallow
leases and 1 in 5 in deepwater tracts,
the report said.
“Once a field is discovered and is determined to be economic to develop, it
has to be put in production by drilling
additional wells, completing the wells
so they produce oil and/or gas, installing collection facilities, laying pipelines,
etc. It may take several years to bring a
new field into production,” it added.

Sound bites, talking points
Young said that since the majority
staff’s report was released, no hearings
were held to examine legislation which
resulted from it. Democrats “appear
unwilling to allow their report to be
examined and questioned in open hearings by federal agencies and members
of Congress,” he said, adding, “Instead,
the majority has relied on using it only
for sound bites and talking points to
defend their lack of action on our nation’s energy crisis.”
Young continued, “The majority’s document misleads members of
Congress and the American public. Our
report and the federal studies provide
context for questions and answers
raised in the majority’s report regarding
the federal onshore and offshore oil and
gas leasing program, outlines the complexity of the issue and, most importantly, explains why the United States is
now dependent on foreign nations for
more than 60% of its oil.”
Rahall, the committee’s chairman,
did not respond to the report but issued
a separate release noting that the committee has conducted more aggressive
oversight of federally controlled natural
resources and the agencies that manage them since he became chairman in
early 2007. ✦

he full-page, A-section advertisement in the Oct. 9 Washington
Post stood out from others; it was not
for a major commercial bank saying
how much it appreciated its depositors. But “The Unshaken Pillar” made
an important point, which has been
quietly spreading.
“When key pillars of our economy—housing, banking, autos—have
been shaken, one pillar stands unshaken and provides the stability that
our economy so desperately needs at
this critical time.... That pillar is energy,” said the open letter signed by
the chief executives of four large US
corporations: Chevron Corp.’s David
J. O’Reilly, American Electric Power
Co.’s Michael G. Morris, FedEx Corp.’s
Frederick W. Smith, and Dow Chemical Co.’s Andrew N. Lewis.
“Today, Americans understand that
a strong and diverse energy sector is
vital to our economic well-being and
prosperity. They know that energy
produced here at home creates goodpaying American jobs, reduces our
dependence on others, and spurs the
necessary investment and innovation needed to develop all forms of
energy,” it continued.
The letter called for exploring for
more oil and gas domestically, intensifying initiatives to develop alternative and renewal energy forms, and
continuing to improve efficiency and
conservation.

the current credit crisis; and reduce
our dependence on foreign energy
sources and the outflow of US capital
to foreign countries,” it stressed.
Candidates aren’t talking much
about it now, but oil and gas industry
leaders agree that energy remains a
major issue in the 2008 elections and
will loom large for Congress and the
next president.
“Public concern over prices hasn’t
been this high since the oil shocks of
the 1970s and with good reason. The
global energy market has been reshaped in ways that are deeply affecting our economy, and those effects
are intensifying. This renewed public
concern presents an opportunity,”
O’Reilly told a Washington audience
on Sept. 17.

Convincing lawmakers

The critical question, however, is
whether industry leaders can persuade federal lawmakers in the next
few weeks to consider the US oil and
gas business more a source of new
economic growth than a convenient
sector to tax. American Petroleum
Institute Pres. Red Cavaney thinks the
oil and gas business could help the
general economy recover. “It provides
well-paying jobs. We could be seen as
a growth industry again,” he told me
recently.

Modec FSO hits 1 billion bbl ofﬂoading mark
Modec Inc.’s ﬂoating storage and ofﬂoading unit Ta’Kuntah has reached a milestone in the
industry—ofﬂoading a total of 1 billion bbl of oil to 1,745 export tankers.
The FSO, owned and operated by Modec and leased to Petroleos Mexicanos Exploration
& Production, celebrated 10 years of continuous operation on Sept. 14. Other achievements
include its being the ﬁrst FSO in the Gulf of Mexico, having 100% uptime throughout its operation, and operating with no incidents of oil pollution.
Ta’Kuntah FSO is a converted ultralarge crude carrier capable of storing more than 2 million
bbl of oil. It is permanently moored in 80 m of water in Cantarell ﬁeld in the Bay of Campeche
off Mexico.
Sofec designed, engineered, and manufactured the mooring system, which consists of an
external bow-mounted turret capable of withstanding 100-year hurricane conditions. The ofﬂoading system, designed to handle 800,000 b/d of oil, allows export tankers to moor either in
tandem or side-by-side.

ponents, including Mohammed Anwar
al Sadat, former MP and spokesman for
the recently founded Popular Campaign
against Gas Exports. “The government
was finally embarrassed into partially
addressing our concerns,” Al Sadat said.
Since then, Israel has complained of
various problems with gas from Egypt
as in June when the state-owned Israel
Electric Corp. (IEC) said the quality
was substandard because the dew point
deviated from agreed levels.
In late August gas supplies from
Egypt to Israel were interrupted for
technical reasons, according to the IEC.
It marked the fourth time supplies had
been interrupted since their start in
May.
A certain level of animosity over the
agreement comes from political concerns among Egyptians.
“Exporting this energy only
strengthens their [Israel’s] military
machine,” said Yehya Al Gamal, a campaigner against the agreement, saying
that it “participates in suppressing the
Palestinian people.”
“It’s not about the price of gas,”
said Al Gamal, “it’s whether we should
export it to them in the first place.”
However, other Egyptians are more
concerned about the need to preserve
the nation’s natural resources for domestic uses or to obtain market rates
for it.
“Egyptian natural gas belongs to the
Egyptian people, not the government,”
said Al Sadat. “If they’re going to sell
it, they should at least sell it at international prices.”
Underlining that point, neighboring
Lebanon—a fellow Arab nation—has
also experienced delays and shortages in
its Egyptian gas supplies.
In September, Egypt announced a
delay in gas exports to Lebanon through
the Arab Gas Pipeline until at least
January 2009, after initially scheduling them to come on stream in July or
August (OGJ Online, Oct. 4, 2008). ✦

E.On secures stake in Yuzhno Russkoye gas project
Russia’s state-owned OAO Gazprom
has signed an asset swap agreement
granting German utility E.On AG a stake
in the Yuzhno-Russkoye natural gas
project.
In other recent company news:
• Total SA agreed to buy Talisman
Energy Inc. subsidiary Goal Petroleum
(Netherlands) BV for $480 million.
• Santos Ltd., Adelaide, has purchased a 100% interest in the offshore
Western Australian Carnarvon basin retention licence WA-4-R, which contains
most of the undeveloped Spar gas field.
• Harding Energy Partners LLC
(HEP), Dallas, reported that it acquired
all core Barnett shale assets held by DDJET Ltd. LLP and subsequently sold the
holdings to Chesapeake Energy Corp.
• EnCana Corp. has selected Cenovus
Energy Inc. as the name for a new, integrated oil company it is creating as part
of its split into two independent energy
companies—an integrated oil company
and a pure-play natural gas company.
The companies will focus on unconventional resources.

E.On-Gazprom swap
Under the agreement, E.On will
receive 25% minus one ordinary
registered share in the charter capital
of OAO Severneftegazprom (SNGP),
owner and operator of the YuzhnoRusskoye project in southern Russia
and will participate in development of
the field.
In return, Gazprom will receive
2.93% of its own shares, which were
held by E.On subsidiary E.On Ruhrgas
through the company ZAO Gerosgaz.
E.On Ruhrgas will retain a 3.5% stake in
Gazprom.
As a result of the agreement, Gazprom will hold a stake of just over
50% in SNGP, while E.On Ruhrgas and

BASF SA’s subsidiary Wintershall AG
will each have a stake of 25% minus
one share.
With this agreement, E.On aims to
obtain about 6 billion cu m/year from
the Russian field or some 60% of its
gas-production target of 10 billion cu
m/year. Yuzhno Russkoye field is considered one of the world’s largest and
has gas reserves of more than 600 bcm,
according to E.On.
In September, Rainer Steele, a member of the Wintershall board, said gas
production from Yuzhno-Russkoye field
is expected to reach 25 bcm next year.
Steele said production at the field
is being expanded “more quickly than
initially planned” and that output from
the field will reach the maximum 25
bcm/year in 2009, 2 years ahead of the
original targeted 2011 timetable.
In June, Gazprom Chief Executive
Alexei Miller said the firm increased
its natural gas production forecast for
2008 by 2 bcm of gas to 563 bcm, or
2.6% more than last year.
“In 2007, Gazprom commissioned
several large fields, which allows us to
secure the necessary level of production
a decade ahead,” said Miller, referring
to development of large new deposits at
Kharvutinskoye and Yuzhno-Russkoye
fields.

Total acquires Goal
Total’s acquisition of Goal Petroleum
remains subject to necessary government approvals. Goal’s assets predominantly are in permits that Total operates.
Total E&P Nederland expects the
acquisition will increase its production
by 8,000 boe/d by 2011.

Santos offshore
Santos has purchased retention
licence WA-4-R from the Chevron
Australia-led Gorgon project joint ven-

ture, which had decided that Spar was
unlikely to contribute to the proposed
Greater Gorgon LNG development.
The terms and conditions of the sale
are confidential, and the transaction is
subject to the usual approvals.
Spar field, originally found in 1976
by West Australian Petroleum, has an estimated gas resource of up to 600 petajoules along with some 8 million bbl of
condensate. It extends into production
licence WA-13-L in which Santos also
has a 45% interest.
Santos will now evaluate various
development options for the short to
medium-term production.
In related news, Santos as a participant in the Barrow Island oil field
joint venture, has agreed to an access
regime to facilitate the Gorgon JV plans
for LNG processing and export from
Barrow including a geosequestration
of reservoir carbon dioxide into the
Dupuy Formation under the island.

HEP-Chesapeake deal
DDJET is a partnership established
in late 2006 to develop natural gas
production in Tarrant, Johnson, Ellis,
Dallas, Denton, Navarro, Collin, and Hill
counties in Texas. ExxonMobil Corp.
subsidiary Metroplex Barnett Shale LLC
was the operator for DDJET.
The HEP-Metroplex partnership
came about after Harding Co. identified an underutilized pipeline owned
by Metroplex parent ExxonMobil. The
pipeline extends from Keller through
North Richland Hills, Arlington, Grand
Prairie, and Midlothian to Corsicana.
HEP made the decision to sell the
assets in order to more fully develop
its 146,000 net acres in the JamesLimestone and 65,000 net acres in the
Haynesville shale, both in East Texas.
The team also is exploring 50,000

EnCana spinoffs
Under the proposed split, announced
last May, the newly named Cenovus
will be a fully integrated North American oil company with in situ oil sands
properties, refineries, and an underlying
foundation of oil and gas resource plays
(OGJ, May 19, 2008, p. 33). The natural
gas company will continue as EnCana
Corp., the company said.
“Cenovus is the newest name in the
North American energy business. The
name Cenovus successfully captures the
essence of what we want our North
American integrated oil company to
be—a strong enterprise with a sustainable, innovative, and bright future,” said
Brian Ferguson, EnCana’s chief financial
officer, who is the designated president
and chief executive of Cenovus. Other
officers were announced this summer
(OGJ, July 14, 2008, p. 44).
The proposed corporate reorganization, expected to close in early 2009,
will be implemented through a “plan of
arrangement” and is subject to shareholder and court approval.
An information circular setting out
details of the plan of arrangement will
be mailed to EnCana shareholders in
mid-November, followed by a shareholders’ meeting planned for midDecember. ✦

The play falls in the midst of Atlas Energy’s historic acreage position.
It controls 580,000 acres, including
280,000 acres in a sweet spot in the

The initial 24-hr flow rate has
averaged 1 MMcfd, and the company
assigned average reserves of 1 bcf/

Mcfd to 3.6 MMcfd.
Atlas Energy, which claims to be
advanced in its understanding of the
Marcellus reservoir, said it has lately
eliminated many of the low-end wells.
It expects the play to be developed with

MMS plans central gulf sale for March 2009
The US Minerals Management Service has scheduled Lease Sale 208 for
the Central Planning Area (CPA) in the
Gulf of Mexico for Mar. 18, 2009.
MMS estimates the proposed
sale could result in production of
0.807-1.336 billion bbl of oil and
3.365-5.405 tcf of natural gas. The
acreage lies 3-230 miles offshore in
3-3,400 m of water.
The sale encompasses 6,200 unleased blocks covering more than 33.5
million acres off Louisiana, Mississippi,
and Alabama. This area includes 5.8 million acres in the southeastern part of

the CPA known as the 181 South Area,
which will be offered for lease for the
first time since 1988.
“What makes Sale 208 noteworthy
is the addition of the 181 South Area,”
said MMS director Randall Luthi. “The
states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas will share in all revenue
from leases in this new area.”
The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security
Act of 2006 mandates that the 181
South Area be offered for lease and that
the four gulf producing states share in
the revenues. ✦

Eni signs exploration deal with Papua New Guinea
Italy’s Eni SPA has signed an agreement with Papua New Guinea for a
long-term partnership to pursue sustainable development of the country’s
untouched hydrocarbon resources.
Eni will establish an office in that
country to run a detailed exploration
study and outline a data acquisition
program across all regions in the country that are either not currently under
permit or are completely unexplored
wildcat areas.
The aim of the program is to better
determine the country’s remaining
hydrocarbon potential. The data and
any subsequent outcome will be the

years of underinvestment,” he said. He
foresees continuing increased spending
on exploration worldwide.
“The number of exploration blocks
awarded has also been increasing
substantially. This part of the business is most influenced by geopolitics
and access to reserves,” he said. More
than 12,000 exploration licenses were
awarded during 2003-07 worldwide.
Meanwhile, the offshore drilling
fleet is growing. Current construction
plans will increase the existing fleet by
29% by 2012, he said, noting that a
significant share of the newbuilds are
designed for high-specification deepwater operations.
“Among these newbuild rigs are 44
new drillships, which will almost exclusively be involved in exploration and
delineation work,” Gould said. “In addition, there are 81 new semisubmersibles capable of drilling in ultradeep
water—defined as being deeper than
5,000 ft. These will probably double the
number of deepwater rigs involved in
exploration activity.” ✦

US into a net exporter of
Refining
gasoline by 2010.
An analysis by Booz &
Co. entitled “Refining Trends: The Golden Age or the Eye of the Storm? Part IV:
Tough Choices”
examines the
effect of rising
gasoline and
diesel demand
in Asia and
other countries,
biofuel mandates, and alternative fuel vehicles on
the global refining industry.
These factors create opposing forces
on worldwide refiners. The study says
that, in the short term (2008-13), overall margin levels have already topped
out and will move lower. In addition,
a recession could accelerate the downward trend in margins. Finally, trade
flows could shift margins to Asia.
In the long term, through 2025, the
study says that global demand for transportation fuels will continue to grow,
despite the emergence of alternativefuel vehicle technologies, due primarily
to increasing economic growth in Asia.
Long-term margin levels will depend

on economic growth in developing
economies. This is a shift from refining
margin cycles of the recent past, which
were solely a factor of how fast refining
capacity was added.
In addition, regulations on dieselization, high-efficiency vehicles, and biofuels will influence refining margins.

Short-term demand
Despite sustained high prices, demand for transportation fuels has continued to grow due to worldwide economic growth, according to the study.
Fig. 1 shows that US demand, however,
has started to decrease. High gasoline
prices and economic fears prompted US
consumers to use less gasoline in the
first 9 months of 2008.
The study’s analysis shows that gasoline consumption is correlated highly
with consumers’ personal disposable
income (PDI), which varies due to economic growth and inflation. Increases
in PDI raise gasoline consumption
overall and reduce individual sensitivity
to price changes.
In the last 3 decades, while gasoline
spending as a percentage of PDI has
dropped, the absolute price elasticity of
gasoline in the US has decreased by an
order of magnitude. This fact, until recently, dampened the effect on demand
of historically high real gasoline prices
in the US, according to the study.

to preserve some cash for consolidations if the industry hits bottom again.
US refiners must consider this if the
market forces margins down and presents acquisition opportunities.
Conversely, the study says, Asia and
emerging economies will increase
demand for transportation fuels; refiners
will need to establish a firm presence in
these regions to increase the likelihood
of solid returns. Currently, local refiners
are capturing most opportunities in Asia
to the degree that local price regimes
allow.
In addition, regardless of geography,
when refiners invest in capacity, they
should favor diesel instead of gasoline
production. Refiners should aim for
increasing operational flexibility, the
study says.
Refiners must also consider expanding their energy portfolios to include
biofuels; several of the skills required to
succeed in biofuels, such as process engineering, transportation, optimization,
and marketing, are core competencies
of refiners. ✦

Background

Fracture propagation control in natural gas pipelines requires high fracture
toughnesses as strength of steel pipe
increases, as diameter increases, as applied pressure increases, and as the gas
composition increases in richness.
Propagation control seeks to prevent
long fracture propagation in a ductile mode, which has occurred several
times, with fracture lengths up to 488

in predicting the CVN energy required
for arrest stems from essentially all

same gas composition decompressing
from two different pressure levels.
Gasdecom, based on the BWRS
equation of state, predicted the curves
shown.1 The 12.1 MPa (1,750 psig),
–1° C. (30° F.), and 10° C. (50° F.)
curves start decompressing from about
the same velocity, but the –18° C. (0°
F.) curve has a higher initial velocity.
The level of pressure decay in the
bottom portion of the decay after the
gas has penetrated into the two-phase
region stands as the important feature
of the three curves. The lowest-temperature curves on the 1,750 psig (12.1
MPa) plot have the highest pressures
available to drive a fracture. Comparing
the 1,944 and 1,750 psig curves at -1°
C. (30° F.) shows the higher-pressure
54

curve having a higher pressure in the
lower portion of the decay, as would be
expected.
These curves provide an example of
the sensitivity of gas decompression to
starting temperature and pressure and
how it affects the fracture toughness
required for fracture arrest. Predicting
fracture-arrest toughness with the Battelle Two Curve Model (TCM)1 shows
the higher the pressure the greater the
fracture toughness required for arrest.
The CVN arrest toughnesses predicted for arrest (with no correction
factor) are:
• 277 J for the 13.4 MPa, –1° C.
curve.
• 227 J for the 12.1 MPa, –18° C.
curve.

• 187 J for the 12.1 MPa, –1° C.
curve.
• 160 J for the 12.1 MPa, 10° C.
curve.
Arrest toughness is sensitive to the
initial temperature and pressure in a
pipeline.
• Gas composition. Gas composition also affects gas decompression. Fig.
2 shows two gas compositions, one
the same composition shown in Fig.
1 and the other 100% methane (C1),
decompressing from the same pressure
and temperature (12.1 MPa, –1° C.),
demonstrating the richer the gas the
higher the pressure driving the fracture
and the greater the toughness (187 J vs.
97 J) required for fracture arrest.
An attempt to assess the effect of
composition changes for all of the individual elements in natural gas sought to
develop a relative ranking of the significance of the composition effect on the
fracture-arrest toughness. Examination
of the effort, however, proved it to be
impossible.
Tables 1 and 2 show examples of the
assessments. Table 1 shows an attempt
to assess the effect of C1, C2, and C3 on
the arrest CVN for the gas examined in
Fig. 1 at 12.1 MPa (1,750 psig) and
10° C. (50° F.).
Comparing Gas 1 and 2, the decrease
of C1 to 89% from 90% and increase of
C2 to 6% from 5% did not change the
arrest CVN, suggesting 1% of C1 and C2
have an equal effect on arrest toughness. Comparing Gas 2 and 3, however,
shows decreasing methane to 86% from
89% and increasing ethane to 9% from
6%, keeping all other factors constant,
increased the arrest toughness to 242 J
from 225 J, illustrating the non-linear
effect of the composition. Holding C1
constant at 86% but decreasing C2 to
3% from 9% and increasing C3 to 9%
from 3% increased the arrest toughness
to 289 J from 242 J.
Table 2 shows the effect of changing
C4, C5, and C6 compositions. C1, C2, and
C3 stayed constant, along with pressure
and temperature. Normal levels of C4
through C6 are usually less than 0.2%,
but even changing the amounts to 0.4%

did not affect arrest toughness, with
CVN values of 220-222 J.
A second attempt to find an approximate predictor for the arrest toughness based on composition used the
ideal gas heating value shown in Fig. 3.
Equation 2 provides the basis of the gas
heating value.
Fig. 3 shows a roughly linear relationship between the ideal gas heating value and the arrest CVN energy,
providing perhaps one of the best ways
of assessing a given gas composition’s
effect on fracture-arrest energy. This approach needs further examination, but
appears promising.

Surrounding material
The type of backfill material (backfill) above and below the pipe, i.e.,
air, soil, or water, affects the required
fracture toughness for arrest. Rudland
and Wilkowski reported the results
of research studying the effect of soil
properties on fracture speed.2 The correlation in results of their small-scale
fracture propagation tests, plotting
fracture speed vs. soil density, suggests a
trend of fracture speed being lower for
higher density soils, but it is rough at
best and needs additional study.
56

Plotting fracture speed against
moisture content shows a clear trend
toward decreasing fracture speed with
increasing moisture content. The effect
of moisture content (as opposed to
soil type), however, is not clear as to
whether the increase in density or some
other parameter is responsible. Plotting
different soil types with the same moisture content would help clarify its role.
The data reinforce the need to study the
effect of different soil types, depths of
soil, moisture contents, and density to

help reduce scatter in future full-scale
fracture-arrest tests.
A pipe submerged underwater to
sufficient depth will arrest a fracture
at a lower CVN level than a similar
fracture backfilled with soil. Maxey
postulated releasing gas into the water
creates an external pressure on the pipe
reducing the effective driving pressure
in the pipe.3 Water transmits the exiting
gas pressure at a velocity of 1,463 m/
sec (4,800 fps), 3.7 times faster than
the gas pressure in the pipe can decay,
roughly 396 m/sec. The water has
sufficient mass to restrain temporarily
the exiting gas pressure, allowing it to
apply external pressure on the pipe for
a long enough time to assist in fracture
arrest.
No existing fracture-arrest prediction
method used to specify CVN fracturearrest toughness has incorporated the
effect of backfill in a way allowing
variations to be effective on the calculated arrest toughness. This area needs
additional research to accurately predict
arrest toughness levels and, one hopes,
reduce scatter in future correlations
with full-scale fracture-arrest tests.

X70 predictions
Most formulations for prediction
of fracture-arrest toughness emerged
1970-90 and are generally based on
X52-X65 grade pipe steels. These steels
characteristically had relatively low constant upper plateau energy levels and
most were relatively thin (6-12 mm),
prompting use of two-thirds thickness
CVN specimens to measure toughness
of the steels and develop arrest-prediction models for fracture toughness
assessments.
Newer steels, X70-X100, used at
higher operating pressures, 10.3-34.5
MPa (1,500 to 5,000 psig), have sufficient WT to allow use of full-thickness
CVN specimens for fracture toughness
assessment. Some of the X70 and X80
steels also exhibited rising upper shelf
energies and the interpretation of the
arrest toughness for these steels using
CVN specimens has not been defined.

present raw data from full-scale burst
fracture-arrest tests on X70 pipe, sorting the data by where arrest or propagation occurred and assessing it against
available prediction methodologies.
The X70 data consist of tests involving both lean gas and rich gas. The
rich-gas tests showed discontinuity in
58

the decompression curve, while the
lean-gas tests exhibited a continuous
decompression curve.
The X70 lean gas full-scale fracture
arrest data come from 12 tests encompassing 101 data points on individual
pipe lengths (Table 3). The tests cover
42-56 in. OD and 15.7-20 mm WT. The

Battelle TCM provided the basis for all
of the predicted fracture-arrest toughness values.2
Fig. 4 shows the X70 lean gas fracturearrest data. Measured CVN values from
the test pipe lie on the X axis and the
TCM-predicted arrest CVN values on the
Y axis. Thirty-nine percent of the propagate data lie on the right side of the 1:1
line, which are nonconservative propagate
points. Seventeen percent of the arrest
data lie on the left side of the 1:1 line,
which are conservative arrest points.
The TCM predictions are too low to
match the test results. Eliminating all
the nonconservative propagate points,
i.e., moving them above the 1:1 line,
would require a 43% increase in the
predictions or use of 1.43 multiplier
factor.
Fig. 5 shows similar data from rich
gas tests on X70 pipe (Table 4), representing nine fracture-arrest tests with
75 individual pipe lengths.
Fig. 5 shows 54% of the propagate
data on the right side of the 1:1 line
(nonconservative) and 6% of the arrest data on the left side of the 1:1 line
(conservative). TCM predictions are
even further in error for the X70 richgas test results. Eliminating the nonconservative propagate points would
require applying a 2.6 multiplier factor
to the predicted toughness levels, raising a question as to why such a stark
difference between the lean-gas and
rich-gas data points exists.
Examination of the data revealed one
outlying rich gas data set as controlling the 2.6 factor. These data, shown
in Fig. 6, represent tests conducted in
the 1980s with results well outside the
scatter of the other data points. These
tests could have used rising upper shelf
CVN energy steels, the type of X70 steel
produced at the time, but this is speculation. A lack of knowledge regarding
how to assess the toughness of rising
upper shelf steel CVN energies requires
full-scale tests to define their fracturearrest characteristics.
Removing the earlier data shown in
Fig. 6 from Fig. 5 reduces the 2.6 factor
to the 1.43 shown in Fig. 4.

Three correction equations have
been proposed to eliminate the error
identified in Figs. 4 and 5. Equation 3
shows the Leis correction equation.
Wilkowski developed another equation (Equation 4), using the same terms
used in Equation 2.
CFER proposed the third correction factor of 1.7 times the CVN TCM
prediction.4
Equation 3 appears to provide the
most reasonable approach for X70
steels. This is also suggested for application to high CVN-energy (>70 ft-lb)
X65 steels. ✦

strong programming, mathematical modeling and
engineering skills, and understanding of petroleum
geology, well-test analysis, and reservoir engineering
to work on research projects and field studies related
to improved oil recovery and reservoir modeling.
Develop tools that reservoir engineers can use to
determine how well the simulation model predictions match field production data like pressures and
flow rates at wells, and decide how to best adjust
simulation model properties to obtain a history
match. Apply statistics and uncertainty analysis to
reservoir modeling. Develop code and workflows
for assisted history match software to speed up the
process of iterating on geologic descriptions. Carry
out history match research studies using scripts and
programs to develop new tools and processes that
are specific to the real reservoir in question. Build,
modify and run simulation models, interacting with
other engineers and geoscientists to gather necessary
data for the models. Evaluate and analyze reservoir
performance using full-field simulations and
troubleshoot simulation models. Prepare specifications for new features in the simulator, rigorously
test the in-house simulator and added features, work
with software developers to ensure that new features
are properly implemented and develop training
materials for and train other engineers on new
simulator features. Requires a PhD in Petroleum Engineering or related field plus 2 years of experience
in modeling transport phenomena or multiphase
fluid flow in porous media. Experience must include
utilization of applied scientific computing and
computational mathematics. Experience must also
include the use of statistics and uncertainty analysis

Repsol, together with 3DGeo, a Houston-based imaging company formed by
Stanford University professor and seismic imaging pioneer, Biondo Biondi, and
the Spanish government-owned Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC), have
created The Kaleidoscope Project. The Kaleidoscope Project is a “dream
team” partnership of top geophysicists, computer scientists and organizations
from around the world that are creating a major advance in computerized
techniques for seismic imaging.
The Kaleidoscope Project now makes possible the full realization of the next
generation seismic imaging technology, including a specialized technique
called Reverse Time Migration (RTM), that accelerates and streamlines oil and
gas exploration by several orders of magnitude compared to current industry
standards.
On Tuesday, October 21, Francisco Ortigosa will present, in an exclusive
Offshore webcast, an overview of this exciting new program that promises to
change the future of oil and gas exploration. The webcast will be moderated
by Offshore Managing Editor David Paganie.

Oil industry helps
ease the new load
on US taxpayers
Congress has allowed the oil and gas
business to ease the extra load taxpayers
will assume from the vote-winning part of
the economic rescue package signed into
law Oct. 3.
That’s one way for an industry to look at
being singled out for tax increases.
The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, providing for the public

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e

purchase of hundreds of billions of dollars’
worth of distressed loans, didn’t pass until
Congress packed it with vote bait.
It added, for example, the Energy
Improvement and Extension Act of 2008
(EIEA), an array of energy gifts President
Bush threatened to veto when it ﬁrst appeared in May. Having latched onto a bill
widely seen as the last defense against
ﬁnancial-system collapse, however, this
monument to the corruption of US energy
policy is now law.
The Joint Committee on Taxation of
Congress estimated the costs.
During 2009-18, it said on Oct. 1, “energy production incentives” will cost the
national treasury $10.9 billion. These are
new and extended tax breaks for exotic
energy forms such as wind and geothermal
and for conservation and carbon-mitigation
projects. “Transportation and domestic fuel
security provisions,” including help for biofuel and cellulosic-ethanol plants, electric
vehicles, and alternative-fuel service stations, will cost $2.6 billion over 10 years.
And the 10-year price of the EIEA’s
“energy conservation and efﬁciency provisions” will be a tidy $3.5 billion.
Part of what Congress takes from taxpayers to make producers of uneconomic
energy happy, the oil industry will give
back.
When the manufacturer’s tax deduction
rises to 9% for most American businesses
in 2010, it will stay at 6% for oil and gas
companies. The 10-year take for taxpayers
(and cost to shareholders of the companies
involved): $4.9 billion.
Adjustments in rules about tax treatment of non-US oil and gas production will
cost the industry $2.2 billion. And an increase in the excise tax rate for the Oil Spill
Liability Trust Fund will cost $1.7 billion.
On balance, the EIEA will cost taxpayers
$61 billion through 2018. The whole package added to the emergency measure to
win passage will cost $110.4 billion.
But who’s counting?

Crude prices lowest in a year
The November contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes hit new lows for
the year, trading as low as $77.09/bbl Oct. 10 before closing at $77.70/bbl, down $8.89
for the day on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
That market ﬁnished its ﬁrst full October week with a 17% loss as international
equity markets reeled in the current ﬁnancial crisis and energy prices were undercut
by indications of ﬂagging demand.
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, said Oct. 10: “The volatility on
equities is currently higher than on crude oil, and the stock markets remain the
greater input into the current ﬂat price ﬂuctuations on West Texas Intermediate. There
is blood on the street, and the stampede continues with equities currently in a selfperpetuating corrective cycle linked to the higher volatility. The sentiment is driven
by the main equity indices, but most of them (such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average) have too few companies making the index. As the result of the historically high
volatility, the attack on just one company will bring the whole index sharply lower
and then panic selling comes in.”
At Barclays Capital Inc. in London, analyst Paul Horsnell said, “The worsening in
conditions over the past few weeks has been so acute and so dramatic that the situation has now led to a widespread, sudden, and severe downwards lurch in growth
expectations. The corporate bond market is not functioning in anything like a normal
way, and credit in all forms has become much more expensive. We have begun to
see the impact of these ﬁnancing constraints in the ﬂow of [energy] data. Given
these developments, we think the corporate sector is set to pull back on investment
spending and hiring more signiﬁcantly than has occurred so far in this cycle.”
Economic growth reduced
As a result, Barclays Capital reduced its economic growth projection for the US
to 1.6% for 2008, down from 2.1% previously, and to 0.8% for 2009, down from 2.5%.
Growth forecasts for other key regions also are being cut; Barclays Capital reduced
its 2009 growth forecast for China’s gross domestic product to 9% from 9.5% previously.
The company’s projection for global demand growth in 2008 is just barely
positive at 150,000 b/d—the weakest annual growth rate since 1993 when energy
demand collapsed in the former Soviet Union.
Horsnell said, “There are many different ways of putting this, but one way to think
of it is that outside the Middle East, oil demand is set to fall this year. Our oil market
balances now show year-over-year declines in global demand in both the third quarter and the current quarter, the ﬁrst consecutive quarters of global demand decline
since the fourth quarter of 2001 and the ﬁrst quarter of 2002.”
He said, “In terms of 2009 oil demand, following the GDP forecast downgrades,
our projection is now for growth of just 330,000 b/d.” Demand is expected to be
down only slightly from year-ago levels in the ﬁrst quarter of 2009, with weather
likely determining whether quarterly declines in oil demand continue.
There have been sharp reductions in other consensus views of a possibly more
severe economic slowdown, with the US Energy Information Administration making
large downward revisions to both 2009 demand and non-OPEC supply.
US inventories
Meanwhile, US crude inventories have continued rising and were close to their
5-year average in early October, while oil product inventories remained extremely
stretched. “The US system has started to show some more meaningful hurricane
recovery, with runs starting to pick up and with delayed imports starting to arrive,”
Horsnell said.
He reported Oct. 10: “Crude imports into the Gulf Coast have rebounded back to a
more normal 6.2 million b/d from the extreme low of 2.7 million b/d hit 2 weeks ago,
as the delayed cargoes continue to work their way back into the data. Further up the
pipelines, crude inventories at Cushing, Okla., remain low, reaching a new low for
the year in the latest data [through Oct. 3]. The gasoline supply system is returning
to normal, with pipelines being reﬁlled…. Gasoline imports reached 1.4 million b/d in
the [Oct. 3] data, as a small armada arrived in the south to bring the system back to a
more even keel. All we need to know about demand is that it is very weak.” September may have been the month of weakest US demand for oil so far this year, providing “the ﬁrst very tentative measure” of “a severe 5.9%” decline in US oil demand
across the third quarter.

the worldwide demand for energy

forecasted to more than double over the

firm, most prognosticators agree that everincreasing demand and the higher prices
accompanying it will eventually force
consumers to look outside traditional
energy sources.

Royalty, GHG levy helps
fuel booming economy

environmentally suspect enterprise, the
provincial government and industry have
joined forces to make Alberta a vanguard
for efficient and clean energy production.
The provincial government is quick to
point out that complementary to its
enormous resources and industry-leading
environmental technologies, Alberta is the
continent’s most attractive investment
opportunity. They say companies looking
to expand will find the only debt-free
jurisdiction in North America and one with
no sales tax and the continent’s lowest
income and corporate taxes. Furthermore,
while its attractive conventional and
unconventional fossil fuel reserves will
remain at the forefront for the foreseeable
future, Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach
acknowledges that rising commodity prices
will make clean alternative energy sources
more attractive. Accordingly, the province is
taking a lead in the development of clean
alternative energy sources.
“With increasing oil prices, we are seeing
solar, geothermal, biomass, ethanol and
biodiesel become more competitive in the
overall energy mix” he said in an exclusive
interview.
In the meantime, with proven fossil fuel
reserves totaling an estimated 1.5 billion
bbl of conventional oil, 41 tcf of natural
gas, as much as 500 tcf of coalbed methane
and another 34 gigatonnes of coal, which
represents 70% of Canada’s resource, it
appears that the province will have little
difficulty financing aggressive research and
social enhancement programs.
Those numbers become even more
staggering when considering the 1.73 trillion

bbl the Oil & Gas Journal estimates are in
place in the oil sands of the northeast.
Second only to the heavy oil deposits of
Venezuela’s Orinoco Basin in worldwide
unconventional reserves, the Alberta oil
sands in 2007 produced nearly 1.2 million
bbl/day, according to the Canadian
Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)
of the potential 1.184 million bbl/day
marketable production estimated by the Oil
& Gas Journal. The oil sands were the
highest contributor to Canada replacing
Saudi Arabia in 2007 as the number one
exporter of crude oil and refined products to
the U.S.
On top of that, Alberta is also Canada’s
largest developer of petrochemicals while
simultaneously becoming the first jurisdiction
in North America to legislate greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions at oil sands, refineries
and other large industrial facilities.

Global Energy Demand

Creebum Lake is located immediately west of the Muskeg River Mine.

Alberta’s booming resource-rich economy is
expected to expand appreciably early next
year, thanks in no small part to a revised
Royalty Framework unveiled in October
2007. The new royalty scheme, which is
scheduled to take effect in January 2009, is
expected to pump an additional $1.74
billion into Alberta’s revenue base in this
fiscal year alone.
Energy Minister Mel Knight said the
revision was long overdue. The new
framework replaces an archaic two-tier
structure that existed untouched for about
15 years and was based on oil and gas prices
that have long gone the way of the
dinosaurs, never to return. He explained
that the new framework comprises sliding
scales for oil and gas, based on more
realistic commodity prices.
“In the days the royalty regime was
formulated, there were very few people
thinking about $100, $120, or $130 oil.
Generally speaking, I think even industry
players understand that you need to
readjust to set yourself on different levels as
you go ahead,” he said.
Since its introduction, the royalty
program has been amended to include
incentives for operators of gas and oil wells
2,500 m and 2,000 m deep, respectively,
and other cost-intensive developments.
“As the government we are the trustee
on behalf of all Albertans and it is our
responsibility to get a return on the province’s
resources.” adds Premier Stelmach.
Led by the oil sands, those resources
most definitely are seeing the return he
envisioned and have helped fuel a thriving

the most palatable results. Oil sands production
today accounts for 5% of Canada’s GHG

economy that shows no sign of cooling
anytime soon. In its 2008 mid-year update
on the province’s economic outlook, the
Alberta Ministry of Finance and Enterprise
said that with strong commodity prices,
economic growth is forecast at 3.1%,
second only to Saskatchewan. In addition,
the Alberta unemployment rate was 3.6% in
May 2008, near its lowest level in 30 years.
“Alberta essentially is at full employment,”
the report concluded. Thanks in large part
to the soaring energy prices the Alberta
economy is poised for a near-record $8.5
billion surplus this fiscal year. The provincial
government says increased revenues from
the new royalty regime and the carbon levy,
which goes into an environmental technology
fund, are being allocated to improve the
lives of Albertans. While enhancing the
infrastructure, diversifying the economy and
increasing multi-disciplinary research have
received widespread attention, priority is being
given to reducing the footprint of its energy
production and improving environmental
quality on all fronts.
During a recent meeting in Jackson Hole,
WY with the state’s governor and other officials,
the premier said they appeared surprised to
learn that Alberta holds the distinction of
being the first jurisdiction in North America to
put a price on the disproportionate generation
of carbon dioxide (CO2 ). “I came back with
the definite feeling that with respect to what
we are doing with greenhouse gas emissions,
our work on alternative energy sources, our
water for life policy and air quality policy, that
Alberta is far ahead of all other jurisdictions
in North America.”

year reduce the amount by 12% or pay a
$15/ton levy.
The province has a strict air quality
monitoring mandate and has enhanced its
long-standing commitment to reduce
industrial water usage, both of which are well
ahead of other North American programs. In
addition, its stringent land reclamation
legislation is designed to reclaim property
used for industrial purposes and transform it
to beneficial reuse.
The province has also committed itself
financially to the North America climate
change initiative to the tune of an
unprecedented $2 billion investment in a
comprehensive Carbon Capture and Storage
(CCS) program.
In addition, the government says it aims
to take the equivalent of thousands of
Alberta vehicles off the streets and highways
through an additional $2 billion investment
in public transit investments. The Green
Transit Incentives Program (Green TRIP) will
promote the use of local, regional and intercity public transit. Funds for the two initiatives
will come from this year’s surplus, which the
province expects will be significantly larger
than predicted.
Further, the government has joined forces
with private industry to invest more than $1
billion to continue to improve the efficiency
and environmental footprint of oil sands

Diverse, Abundant Resources

Alberta: A Region of Diverse,
Abundant Resources:
Conventional, CBM, shallow gas, renewables
comprise wide-ranging energy mix

W

ith considerable oil and gas
resources putting Alberta squarely
in the global limelight, investing in alternative
energy sources may appear to be an
unwarranted enterprise. Alberta Premier Ed
Stelmach, however, says doing so is both a
necessity and an obligation. “If there is a
jurisdiction in North America that should do it,
it is Alberta because we have the resources for
the research,” he says.
As the province continues to take the lead
in alternative energy, the focus on exploiting
Alberta’s conventional and unconventional
reserves remains strong. Taking into account
conventional and oil sands, the Canadian
Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)
reports that total western Canada crude
production was 2.4 million bbl/d last year and
by 2020 is expected to increase anywhere
between 4.4 to 5.0 million bbl/d.
Much of that will come from the Alberta
oil sands, which CAPP said last year accounted
for nearly 1.2 million bbl/day. In 2006, oil
sands production for the first time exceeded
conventional oil, which has been declining
steadily since the late 1990s.
Western Canada, likewise, is the principal
contributor to Canada’s ranking as the world’s
third largest natural gas producer. With its
2006 acquisition of Burlington Resources,
ConocoPhillips became a top-three natural
gas producer in Canada more than doubling
its reserves, wells and production in the
region, it says.
Like conventional oil, drilling for traditional
sources of natural gas also has declined in
recent years. However, 2008 promises to be
the exception as many operators, facing the
impending inauguration of the new royalty
regime, attempt to drill and produce as quickly
as possible to generate peak production before
the new royalties take effect. Consequently,
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, in its 2008 Canadian
Energy Survey, said the gas prospects for the
remainder of this year “is very positive.”

Minister of Energy Mel Knight said revisions
to the framework awarding incentives to highinvestment projects have helped put the
industry and government on the same page.
“We have had very good discussions with
industry and other interested parties who are
stakeholders in Alberta. I think we have arrived
at a situation that is positive in all directions,”
he said.

Unconventional activity strong
From all indications, operators concentrating
on shallow gas campaigns in the southeast
are doing their part to offset the decline in
conventional gas drilling. Harold Wilson,
Executive Director of the Economic Development
Alliance of Southeast Alberta, said exploration

in an area rich in low permeability shallow gas
sands is expected to expand considerably.
New drilling activity in tandem with
workovers and increased use of infield drilling
technology is helping southeast Alberta “enjoy
record oil and gas activity levels,” adds Randy
Humphrey, President of the Medicine Hat
Oilmen’s Association.
Another non-traditional fuel source with a
growing fan base is the bright prospects for
methane deposited within coal seams,
principally throughout southern and central
Alberta. The Alberta Geological Survey (AGS)
estimates there could be as much as 14 trillion
cubic meters, or about 500 tcf, of coalbed
methane (CBM) trapped in Alberta’s vast coal
seams. A joint study by the Energy Resources
Conservation Board (ERCB) and the National
Energy Board (NEB) in 2006 estimated the
ultimate potential of marketable CBM in
Alberta to be between 205 and 253 tcf with an
additional 101 tcf estimated for the remaining
ultimate potential.
Western Canadian companies are also
increasing their interests in the flourishing
Bakken oil shale that reaches from neighboring
Saskatchewan to across the border, into
Montana and North Dakota. Heralded by
some as the second coming of the Alaskan
North Slope, the Bakken is estimated to hold
upwards of 400 billion bbl of crude. Petrobank
Energy and Resources Ltd. President and CEO
John D. Wright said his company, which
holds 137,000 net acres in southeastern
Saskatchewan will operate or participate in
drilling more than 150 prospects this year,
making it “the most active driller on the play.”
With its 2006 and 2007 acquisitions of
major Bakken operators Mission Oil and Gas
Inc. and Innova Exploration Ltd., respectively,
Crescent Point Energy Trust became the
second largest producer in the play. More
than 75% of Crescent Point’s production is in
southern Saskatchewan and in December
2007 the operator reported its holdings in the

Bakken may contain up to 3 billion bbl of
original oil in place.
Despite the maturity of the region, Alberta
Minister of Finance and Enterprise Iris Evans
said opportunities for securing promising
acreage remains. “There are many possibilities,
for example, with conventional deep oil well
drilling. There are other opportunities also
available for various players to get involved,”
she said.

Renewable energy
Concurrent with the industry’s emphasis in
tapping into known traditional and nontraditional energy sources is the province’s
leadership role in developing alternative
energy technologies. Alberta leads Canada and

Many international operators with global
alternative energy research programs, likewise,
have brought their expertise to the province.
Shell Canada said its worldwide renewable
energy effort extends to Alberta, where the
operator focuses primarily on wind power
generation. President and Country Chair Dave
Collyer, the incoming 2008 CAPP President,
said the company is also heavily involved in
biofuels research. “Shell globally is focused on
wind and biofuels. Both of those are
represented in terms of our business activity in
Canada” he said.
Nexen Inc., likewise, is heavily involved in
the renewable energy effort, focusing on wind
power with a 50% interest in the Soderglen
project and plans to commit to a second
project southeast of Calgary, said President and
CEO Charles Fischer. “When we look at all the
renewables, we think wind is the most costeffective,” he said.
The hydropower industry also is gaining
steam with the Canadian Hydropower Association
estimating that water power already delivers
two-thirds of the electricity generated in the
nation with more projects on the boards. Of

Oil Sands Development
Continuing at Brisk Pace
Oil Sands

Bitumen production increases with major
expansions, emerging technologies

N

How it is produced
Naturally occurring bitumen is the prime
feed stock for the synthetic crude produced
from the oil sands. A mixture of organic
liquids that are highly viscous and composed
of highly condensed polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, bitumen is so thick that it
must be heated or diluted before it will flow.
In its infancy, oil sand production was
dominated by near-surface mining, which
remains cost-effective with an 80% to 90%
recovery rate. With the identification of
deposits too deep for conventional mining,
the advent of in-situ extraction techniques
opened the door for cost-effective production
of deeper reserves while removing many of
the environmental concerns of surface
extraction. Today, only 20% of the known
reserves in Alberta are recoverable through
mining with the remaining 80% is produced

ot that long ago, Fort McMurray
was a bucolic trapping outpost of
7,000 residents at the confluence of the
Clearwater and Athabasca Rivers. Today, it is
a genuine boomtown with a population
exceeding 80,000 stretching an infrastructure
ill-equipped to accommodate the invasion.
All because of a substance seeping into the
river beds that trappers used to mix with
resin to caulk their canoes.
Today, the majority of the Canadian oil
sands, which were first investigated in 1875,
are situated in the Athabasca-Wabiskaw,
Cold Lake and Peace River deposits in
northern Alberta. The trio holds a combined
resource base estimated at 1.73 trillion bbl
of crude oil.
While commercial production of the oil
sands first began in 1967 with the nowSuncor mine, it was not until this decade that
improving technical efficiencies and sky
rocketing oil prices turned the sands into a
thriving undertaking.

TRADES IN MOTION
With more than $28 billion expected to be spent over
the next decade on new oil sand developments,
industry is taking the initiative to secure a stable
future workforce, while improving the marketable
potential of Alberta’s Aboriginal peoples.
Kicked off in 2005, the Trades in Motion initiative
was developed specifically for the Métis Nation of
Alberta and is designed to improve employability
and academic skills enabling them to broaden their
future prospects.
Trades in Motion is a partnership between the
Métis Nation, the Northern Alberta Institute of
Technology (NAIT), Keyano College, Devon Canada
Corporation and other industry representatives.
Unique to the venture is the NAIT education mobile
unit that comprises a lab and 53-ft shop equipped
with welders, drill presses and a variety of power and
hand-held tools.
This year, Devon is moving forward with a “take the
training to the community concept” through sponsorship of portable trades trailers for both the Swan
Hills and Lloydminster areas. These local school
boards are working in conjunction with the provincial
government and several industry partners to make the
concept a widely used reality.

by Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD),
Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) or other insitu methods.
The SAGD enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
technology is an advanced form of steam
stimulation where CO2 is injected into
existing reservoirs to extract more resource.
In SAGD a pair of horizontal wells is drilled
into the reservoir, one just above the other.
Low pressure gas-generated steam is injected
continually into the upper wellbore to heat
the bitumen, thus reducing its viscosity. The
heated oil is drained into the lower wellbore,
where it is pumped out and transported to
an upgrader for refinement into commercial
oil. Though employed considerably over the
past 25 years, SAGD is an inherently water
and gas-intensive technology.
Prior to the development of SAGD,
Imperial Oil developed the CSS technology
that still accounts for the majority of its Cold
Lake production. A multi-step process, CSS
begins with steam injection, followed by a
waiting period of up to several weeks while
the steam soaks the heavy oil, which precedes
a recovery phase before the crude can be sent
to an upgrader.
Theoretically, the ability to produce
continually would appear to make SAGD a
much more viable option, but Imperial says
the older CSS technology is more efficient in
zones with good horizontal permeability.
One of the newest in-situ technologies is
the toe-to-heel air injection (THAI™) process,
owned by Petrobank Energy and Resources
Ltd. and its wholly-owned Whitesands
Insitu Inc. subsidiary. Petrobank President
and CEO John D. Wright said the new
technology, will be employed to produce the
estimated 2.6 billion bbl of bitumen-in-place
at the Whitesands May River Project in the
Conklin region.
Petrobank is also awaiting regulatory
approval for an additional three wells to test

both THAI™ and its complementary CAPRI™ technology, which uses
chemical catalysts to lower the viscosity and improve the quality and
flow characteristics of the produced oil. Mr. Wright said the CAPRI™
expansion is expected to come on-stream by the end of the year.
“Combining these two processes in a typical heavy oil opportunity
gives us the chance to significantly increase the amount of oil we
expect to recover from a given project and through the chemical
reactions that occur in the reservoir, we are actually able to enhance
the quality of the crude oil that is produced,” he said.
Other emerging in-situ technologies include pulse technology
and vapor recovery extraction (VAPEX).

is welcomed desperately at a time when rising costs and demand
coupled with concerns of future supplies being held by less stable
regimes, combine for a nervous market. Closer to home, the intensity
of oil sands development is offsetting the continual decline in western
Canadian conventional drilling activity.
The Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors predicts
38% fewer conventional wells will be drilled between 2006 and 2008.
However, the outlook is far brighter for the Alberta oil sands with the

Processing challenges
Along with extraction, processing bitumen and heavy oil into a
commercial commodity poses a host of technical and design challenges,
says Aker Solutions, which handles an estimated 700.000 bbl/day of oil
sands production. Vice President of Business Development Matthew
Hamer said the acquisition of a company that had been processing
heavy crude in Kern County, CA since the 1950s gives Aker Solutions a
unique position in the oil sands.
“We have a great deal of experience in processing upstream heavy
oil. We also have technologies for taking care of some of the effluent
streams that are produced as part of the treatment process that is
necessary to clean up the water so it can be reinjected into the well or
recirculated into the facility,” he explained.
Basically, Aker Solutions’ responsibility is to take unusable bitumen
or heavy oil and convert it into a sellable product. This requires removing
an array of contaminants, including gas, H2S, water, sand and other
sediments. Mr. Hamer said it is critical that operators engage heavy oil
processing experts early in the development of an oil sands project.
“This is especially true with SAGD operations,” adds President and
Canada Country Manager Michael Hambly. “These projects normally
start out very small and build up over time. What we really want to
emphasize to the client is to work with us early, so that we can design
a plant that develops with the evolution of their business.”

daily production to jump to 2.8 million bbl
by 2015.
The portfolio of investments in the oil
sands suggests there will be no downturn in
activity anytime soon. Between 2000 and
2007, an estimated $67 billion was invested
in oil sands projects with another $170
billion earmarked for projects already in the
planning stages. Of that, contracts valued at
$2.6 billion were awarded to aboriginalowned companies between 1998 and 2007,
says Don Thompson, President of the Oil
Sands Developers Group.
“The growth continues to be in the oil
sands, which is very welcomed when you
look at the decline in conventional light oil
supply. North America needs to have a stable
source of future supplies and clearly the oil
sands play an important role in that,” said
Pierre Alvarez, outgoing CAPP President.
“In my mind, heavy oil is the future of the
oil and gas industry. Most of the easily
accessible conventional reserves simply are
not there anymore. So, we have to look at
more challenging and unconventional sources
and heavy oil definitely is one of the answers,”
adds Aker Solutions President Hambly.
Prospects for the oil sands are even more
promising when the carbonate play for heavy
crude trapped in rocks is taken into account.
Many have called it one of the world’s next
giant plays and Osum Oil Corp., a 100%
privately held firm, is already laying the
groundwork for developing the so-called
Saleski carbonates in the Wabasca region.
The operator plans production trials this year

north of Fort McMurray, the field produces
about 155,000 bbl/d and is integrated with
the upgrader located adjacent to the Shell
refinery at Scotford, east of Fort Saskatchewan.
The integrated process produces the bitumen
at Fort McMurray, where it is mixed with
diluents and shipped via pipeline to Scotford.
Expansion 1 of the Athabasca Oil Sands
Project (AOSP) now under construction
will increase capacity at the Albian Sands
mining operation and Scotford Upgrader by
100,000 bbl/day by 2010, Shell says.
“We upgraded the Scotford facility so it is
an integrated package. The expansion we
currently have underway will expand that
project by about 100,000 bbl/day bringing it
to 255,000 bbl/day,” said says Dave Collyer,
President and Country Chair of Shell Canada,
which owns 60% of the Albian operation.
Regulatory applications have also been filed
to expand both the mine and upgraders that
could bring production up to 700,000 bbl/day.

Long Lake
Up-front engineering is underway for the
Phase 2 upgrader expansion at the Long Lake
Project in the Athabasca oil sands of northern
Alberta. Operated in a 50/50 joint venture
between Opti Canada Inc. and Nexen Inc.,
Long Lake became the fourth major integrated
oil sands project in western Canada when it
began production of 58,500 bbl/day of 39º
API sweet crude from 81 SAGD well pairs.
Long Lake holds an estimated 2 billion bbl of
recoverable reserves.
Opti Canada President and CEO Sid
Dykstra said Long Lake was the first to combine
SAGD with the company’s proprietary
OrCrude™ hydrocracking and gasification
technology to produce, what he termed, ”one
of the highest quality synthetic crude oils
ever produced from the Canadian oil sands
with very low operating costs.”
Dykstra said Phase 2 of the integrated
project, which includes a new upgrader, has
the potential to be sanctioned later this year.

Christina Lake and Foster Creek
Expansions underway at the Foster Creek and
Christina Lake projects in northeast Alberta
promise to increase bitumen production to
200,000 bbl/day, says Operator EnCana and
partner ConocoPhillips.
Expansion at Foster Creek, completed in
2007, raised production by 60,000 bbl/d,
while the next two phases will add an
additional 60,000 bbl/day. The twin-expansions
will come on line this year and in 2015,
respectively.
Productive capacity at Christina Lake is
expected to grow to 18,000 bbl/day this year,

while development is underway for an
additional 40,000 bbl/day expansion planned
to come on stream by 2011.
ConocoPhillips significantly increased
its stake in the Foster Creek and Christina Lake
properties with the January 2007 completion
of the FCCL Oil Sands Partnership agreement
with EnCana. In addition to the company’s
interest in Syncrude, the Surmont joint
venture and undeveloped resources in the
Saleski, Thornbury and Clyden areas, this
new partnership significantly increases the
company’s Canadian oil sands resource
holdings.
EnCana Executive Vice President of
Corporate Relations Gerry Protti said the
twin expansion will further reinforce
EnCana’s position as a leader in conserving
water used in oil sands development. “We
have the lowest steam-oil ratio of all the
operators in Alberta and we have the lowest
use of natural gas to produce a barrel of
bitumen. With our Weyburn project in
Saskatchewan, we also have the world largest
carbon CO2 sequestration facility”.

Petrobank’s President Wright said the use of
THAI™ and CAPRI™ technologies at the

project, which will be completed in stages,
will have the initial capacity to produce
10,000 to 15,000 bbl/d of partially upgraded
bitumen.
Unlike SAGD, the THAI™/CAPRI™
technologies, which require only one
horizontal well and one vertical well,
essentially eliminates the need for bulky steam
generators, large water handling and clean up
facilities and settling tanks. “Our footprint is
reduced dramatically because our process
requires none of those facilities. We simply
install an oil battery at one end and in the
vertical wells we put a conventional, off- theshelf air compressor and inject atmospheric
air,” said Mr. Wright.
“We plan to rapidly increase productive
capacity and it will look nothing like a
traditional oil sands operation. More
importantly, we consume no water or natural
gas, in fact, we are a net producer of usable
water,” he added.

THAI ™ / CAPRI ™ IN-SITU TECHNOLOGY

Petrobank Energy and Resources Ltd. holds a unique place in the
industry with its patented and field-proven THAI™ toe-to-heel air
injection technology, which has created a paradigm shift in the
extraction of bitumen from the oil sands.
Today, THAI™ is being combined with the complementary
CAPRI™ technology, which is designed for partial catalytic
upgrading of the bitumen in-situ. This combination essentially
creates a cost-effective and environmentally sound in-situ extraction
process that partially upgrades the bitumen.
In the extraction process, THAI™ combines a vertical air injection
well with a horizontal production well. Air is injected continuously
into the injection well, thus initiating combustion in the oil sands
formation. At the leading edge of the combustion front, partial
upgrading of the bitumen occurs. The heavy portion of the bitumen
remains in the reservoir, providing the fuel to support the advancing

combustion front. The now-mobile bitumen and the combustion
gases, including light hydrocarbons, drain to the horizontal well by
gravity and the pressure differential between the reservoir and
production well, where hot bitumen and vaporized reservoir water
are collected and flow to the surface.
Benefits:
- Higher Resource recoveries
- Lower Capital Costs
- Lower Operating Costs
- Partially Upgraded Product
- Lower greenhouse gas emissions
- Sulphur and Heavy metals reduced
- No water or gas fuel required during production
- Net water production of industrial quality
- Much smaller surface footprint

for improvement in this area,” said President

of StatoilHydro Canada Geir Jøssang. That is
precisely the reason, he said, that the local
entity has established a Heavy Oil Technology
Centre in western Canada. “This is the first
time we have located an arm of our research
centre based in Trondheim, Norway outside
of Norway. We are in the early stages of the
establishment of the center, but it is already
operative and we have started to recruit local
experts to supplement those relocated from
Norway,” he said.
StatoilHydro and other oil sands
operators say they are also heavily involved
in the province’s proposed Integrated CO2
Network ( ICO2N ). The initiative would
further development in the capture,
transport and storage of carbon dioxide.
Its membership comprises a wide group of
industry representatives.
In its environmental update, CAPP said
the industry is constantly researching new
technologies to reduce GHG emissions
further.
Along with impressive results from the
carbon capture and levy programs, industry
leaders also point to other revolutionary
legislative and on-the-ground measures to
protect the air, land and water during
production of this essential natural resource.

Oil Sands

Minimal effect on the environment and
responsible development are the catch words
for everyone engaged in the Alberta oil sands.
While acknowledging the synthetic crude
produced from oil sands has a higher carbon
content than traditional sources, insiders
point to the government-mandated carbon
capture and storage program and other
unprecedented industry initiatives as proof
positive of their environmental commitment.
“I think a lot of the environmental
community wants to use oil sands as the
poster image of an off-oil campaign because
they want to see the end of oil. But we have
absolute transparency, unlike many parts
of the world, so the public can see and have
input into what the industry and government
are doing to safeguard the environment.
We all report on our own performance,” said
Mr. Alvarez.
Advanced technologies are critical in not
only improving operational efficiency and
increasing production, but also in optimizing
environmental performance, say operators
and government officials.
“Developing oil sands is technologyintensive. This means there is what we call
a technological upside. In other words, there

ention “dirty oil” in Alberta and
be prepared for a lecture on the
ground-breaking government and industry
initiatives, they claim, have made the province
a global leader in environmental stewardship.
As evidence, they point to the one-of-a-kind
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) program
enacted earlier this year that is only one
component of a multi-pronged effort to fight
climate change. The province has earmarked a
$4-billion investment in controlling climate
change, but government and industry efforts
to date have effectively reduced oil sands
exploration-related emissions by 45% per
barrel produced since 1990. With much of
the criticism, especially from the U.S., leveled
at the carbon-intensive Alberta oil sands,
regulators and industry alike say the worldclass technologies being employed to slash
carbon emission and water use, along with
transforming once-industrial acreage to
pastoral recreational areas, clearly nullifies
the protests.
“This issue of dirty oil is a myth,” Alberta
Premier Ed Stelmach says matter-of-factly.
“The fact is, we have reduced carbon (emissions)
by 45% per barrel and with further
technologies we would like it to be next to
zero. We will continue to take a leadership role
in the environment and we would like to be
the world’s cleanest energy producer. Our goal
is to reduce the carbon from the oil sands to
lower than conventional oil and gas.”
“It is very interesting to me what is dirty,”
questions Pierre Alvarez, outgoing President of
the CAPP. “If you look at the emissions from
California heavy crude, it is exactly the same
as the emissions profile of oil sands production.”
Alberta remains the only jurisdiction in
North America and much of the world to enact
a formal CCS program for harnessing and
permanently storing greenhouse gas emissions
of carbon dioxide (CO2). In July 2008, the
government, through its sanctioned Alberta
Carbon Capture and Storage Development

THE BEAHR PROGRAM
In early 2008, Shell sponsored the Environmental
Monitor Training Program in Fort Chipewyan.
This program was designed and developed
through Building Environmental Aboriginal
Human Resources (BEAHR), an initiative to
increase Aboriginal employment in the environmental sector.The company worked with Northern
Lakes College to help fly in instructors to this
remote northern Alberta Aboriginal community.
The program consisted of seven weeks of training
focused on environmental monitoring, covering
health and safety, technical skills, local knowledge, basic ecology and monitoring effects. The
overall goal was to provide graduates with the
skills to participate in community-based environmental monitoring programs, or to further their
studies through accredited environmental programs at schools like Keyano College in Fort
McMurray. Nine students from Fort Chipewyan
completed the program.
A key success factor was the program's "in the
community" delivery so students had family and
community support during their studies. Local
community Elders also helped train the students
ensuring traditional knowledge was shared and
incorporated into the program curriculum.

Council, contributed $2 billion to new CCS
projects as part of the province’s sweeping
2008 Climate Change Strategy.
Particularly relevant to the carbon-intensive
oil sands, the CCS process entails separating
the harmful CO2 from other emissions.
Afterwards, it is dehydrated, compressed and
transported to one of the many impervious
salt caverns scattered throughout the province,
many of which are abandoned mining sites.
Once the salt is pumped out, the captured
CO2 will be injected safely and permanently
deep into the porous rock.
Transporting captured carbon is a key
element of the Integrated CO2 Network
(ICO2N) now in the developmental stage.
One proposal is to develop an integrated CO2
capture and storage pipeline network that
would link multiple capture facilities and enduse applications. Under the scheme, the
pipeline would consist of a large main line
connecting the Swan Hills/Pembina/Red Deer
market and storage locations, which would
be connected to CO2 supply lines from Fort
McMurray, Fort Saskatchewan and Red Deer.
While the CCS process is being employed
successfully elsewhere in the world, Alberta is
somewhat unique in that it possesses abundant
storage capacity. To increase the capacity even
more, the Alberta Saline Aquifer Project
(ASAP), a broad-based initiative comprising a
Who’s Who of the province’s energy industry,
in early 2008 announced a broad-based
project to identify even more locations suitable
for long-term sequestration.
In conjunction with the CCS program,
Alberta also holds the distinction of being the
only region, at least in North America, to
impose a levy on excessive CO2 emissions.
Under the program, industrial complexes
emitting more than 100,000 tons of greenhouse
gases annually must reduce intensity by 12%.
Companies failing to do so have the option of
buying a carbon set-off or pay an emissions
levy of $15/ton that goes directly into an

Continuous environmental monitoring.

Association (WBEA) shows that since 1999
emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen
dioxide, ozone, fine particulate matter and
sulphur dioxide – the five pollutants used to
calculate an air quality index – have either
dropped or showed no change. In early 2007,
the WBEA augmented its 24 hours-a-day,
365 days a year monitoring program by
signing a three-year contract with Earth Tech
of Long Beach, CA to provide real-time
information on ambient air quality at the
Athabasca oil sands.
In its 2007 Stewardship Report, which
annually measures progress on a number of
environmental, safety and social fronts, CAPP
said the emphasis on continuous improvement
has shown marked progress, particularly in air
quality. For instance, the analysis revealed that

environmental technology fund to support
GHG-reducing research in the province.
Geir Jøssang, President of StatoilHydro
Canada, for one, is no stranger to CCS
operations. His global company operates two
of the world’s four largest CCS projects at its
Sleipner and Snøhvit platforms in the North
Sea and that experience will see benefits in
Alberta. “We are a world leader in CCS and
we participate in several industry initiatives
in Canada, such as the ICO2N, which is
aimed at advancing CCS technology and
infrastructure,” he said.
ConocoPhillips contributed to the reduction
with a then-pilot program in 2006 to locate
and eliminate so-called “fugitive gases” at its
Alberta and Canadian processing facilities
missed by conventional cameras. Using newly
developed infrared video technology, the
operator located 144 fugitive emissions,
resulting in an 18% reduction in GHG
emissions at its local facilities.
According to the industry, the CCS
program also opens the door for even further
advancement of technology for improving
air quality. “Research is being done on
biological treatment of CO2, but I think what
the CCS does in the short term is to allow us
to take some initial first steps to push the
limits of technology and begin to establish
CO2 management as a day-to-day priority
within companies.” says Mr. Alvarez.
Today, around-the-clock monitoring of air
quality through the Wood Buffalo Environmental

sulphur recovery rates were the highest since
reporting began in 1999, while benzene
emissions from glycol dehydrators dropped
25% compared to 2001 levels.
“We are firmly of the view that carbon
capture and storage is going to be a significant
part of the solution and we are very supportive
of the Alberta initiative,” says President and
Shell Canada Country Chair Dave Collyer.
Though it may be the most visible, the CCS
strategy is only one component of a multifaceted government, industry and academia
environmental strategy that addresses
everything from virtually eliminating the
tailings ponds from oil sands operations to
protecting the province’s precious water supply.
Owing to its emphasis on transparency, the
province has engaged a host of non-government
organizations, including end consumers, who
everyone agrees has a stake in the process.
“I think what most people forget is that
80% of the emissions related to a barrel of oil
comes from end-use consumption, the jet
engine, the car, the truck, you name it,” says
Mr. Alvarez.
One element of the comprehensive
environmental strategy directly impacting oil
sands production is the government-enacted
water conservation strategy.

Provincial Water Strategy

far-reaching water strategy with the release
of “Water for Life: Alberta’s Strategy for

Tailings ponds
In June, the Energy Resources Conservation
Board of Alberta (ERCB) released its draft
“Tailings Performance Criteria and Requirements
for Oil Sands Mining Scheme” that sets forth a
number of objectives for managing the residue
from production operations. According to
ERCB Chairman Dan McFadyen, the directive
establishes new requirements for mineable oil
sands tailings operations and is only one

Sustainability.” With the aim of reducing water
usage, the multi-faceted strategy mandates
that all existing or approved oil sands projects
may withdraw less than 3% over the average
annual flow of the Athabasca River. CAPP and
others point out that going back to 2006
withdrawal has averaged a scant 0.4% and
emerging technologies promise to lower the
volume even more.
The new-generation THAI™ in-situ
extraction process, for instance, uses air
injection, rather than steam to create an
automatic process in the well, thereby
generating negligible water use. Devon says a
uniquely engineered steaming operation at
its Jackfish development gives Devon Energy
the distinction of being the only SAGD
operator to use no fresh water in the process.
Rather, Devon designed the facility to employ
otherwise-unusable saline water from an
aquifer in the Grand Rapids formation. The
saline water used has a total dissolved solids
(TDS) count of 6,000 to 8,000 ppm, well
above the 4,000 ppm minimum for water
suitable for drinking, livestock or irrigation
and meets Devon’s objective of using no fresh
water in its steaming operation, says Devon
Canada President Chris Seasons.
“Devon Energy is committed to the
responsible management of water in its daily
operations. Working under the principals of
minimization of use, conservation and
recycling, the company actively seeks new
and more effective ways to approach water
use,” he said.
The same with Shell Canada, which says it
recycles about 90% of the water it uses.
A 2007 update of monitoring undertaken
by the Regional Aquatics Monitoring Program
(RAMP) encompassing the entire Regional
Municipality of Wood Buffalo showed “no
detectable changes in aquatic resources
related to oil sands development,” it reported.

component of a larger initiative to regulate
tailings management.
Similar in appearance to the reserve waste
pits that dot much of the western U.S. drilling
landscape, tailing ponds comprise a mixture
of water, clay, sand and residual bitumen
produced through the extraction process. The
compounds are stored in large ponds where
the clay/water mixture is left to settle. Over the
life of an oil sands operation, the tailing ponds,
many of which are discontinued mining pits,
are used to continually recycle water.
A key component of the ERCB directive is
not only to minimize, but eventually “eliminate,
the long-term storage of fluid tailings in the
reclamation landscape,” which many outside
critics allude to in their critiques of the oil sands.
In its “Environmental Challenges and Progress
in Canada’s Oil Sands,” published last April,
CAPP said industry and academia alike have
joined forces to address the issue from
developing technologies to eliminate them
altogether to converting the material into
beneficial re-use. For example, ongoing
research at the Canadian Oil Sands Network
for Research and Development (CONRAD)
examines new methods for accelerated
separation of water and fine silts, faster
recycling of water and new reclamation
processes. For another, chemical engineer
Pedro Pereira Almao, co-director of the
University of Calgary’s Alberta Ingenuity
Centre for In-Situ Energy (AICSE), developed
a nano-catalyst, he believes, holds the
potential to upgrade bitumen in its natural
underground reservoir, thus eliminating the
need for tailing ponds.

Land reclamation, Gateway Hill.

The management of tailings is an integral
constituent of the Alberta Environmental
Protection and Enhancement Act – Conservation
and Reclamation Regulation that mandates
all industrial land must be returned to its
native condition, or better, after the operation
ceases. Addressing both in-situ and mining
operations in and around the 3.2-million km2
Boreal Forest region, the revised act takes
effect this fall.
“We have world standards with respect to
air quality, water quality and now with a new
land use framework coming into play this
fall, it will pretty much close the loop,” said
Alberta Minister of Finance and Enterprise
Iris Evans.
Under Alberta’s policy, the province must
approve a reclamation plan before a producer
can get the go-ahead to begin operations.
Once the land has been restored, it is returned
to the province under a reclamation certificate.

Injury rates slashed
In a related development, CAPP’s Stewardship
Report also reported a marked decline in
injuries, despite the massive influx of energy
workers and more hours on the job. It reported
that the total recordable injury frequency for
Alberta energy workers in the previous year
was at its lowest rate since 1999, when the

McMurray became the first reclaimed area to
receive government certification. The longtime mine has since been converted into a
rolling forested area replete with hiking trails
and lookout points.
As part of its in-situ reclamation program,
EnCana initiated a number of pilot projects to
determine the most effective way of reforesting
its oil sands well sites and access roads. Use of
a natural regeneration process, the company
says helps it ensure indigenous plant species
remain in the area.
Be it improving the air and water quality or
reclaiming land, Mr. Seasons of Devon Canada
said all Albertans have a personal investment
in optimizing environmental quality.

Drilling Technology

Drilling Technology:
Unlocking the Potential
Automated drilling rigs, stacked fracs
improving drilling efficiency, costs

W

hile the technological advances in
the oil sands grab most of the
attention, industry leaders are quick to point
out the technologies developed in the
province to improve overall drilling efficiency.
Improvements in horizontal well construction,
which made the drilling of SAGD wells in
the oil sands possible, and optimized fracture
stimulation, including the Packers Plus
“StackFRAC” technology used extensively in
the Bakken Shale play, is evidence of the
innovative technical developments engineered
by Alberta companies.
Chief among those is the automated
drilling rig (ADR™) developed by Ensign
Energy Services, the largest oilfield services
company in Canada. The ADR™ is defined by
a four-point philosophy: automated computercontrolled driller’s console; automated safe
and efficient tubular handling; drilling torque
applied via top drive and fast and efficient rig
moves. Ensign Energy Services President and
COO Bob Geddes said one of the biggest
advantages of the ADR™ is reducing the time
and costs associated with moving the rig from
one location to another.
“These units rig up in arguably a quarter of
the time it takes a lot of our competitors. We
spend a great deal of time on the design and
construction phases, using smart ideas like
PLC cables that control different parts of the
rig. These rigs self-move, by using our Ensign
jack pads that move the rig in a four-foot stroke.
Therefore, we can move it in any direction
without the need for any truck. With the mast
standing with the entire pipe, we just move
over and we are ready to drill right away, as all
the pipe is still in the mast,” said Mr. Geddes.
Today, 54 ADRs are working worldwide
with 30 operating in Western Canada. Mr.
Geddes said the units also are unique in that
they were the first to employ the Tesco portable
top-drive system, adding Ensign will unveil
an ADR™ next year capable of drilling to
6,000 m (19,680 ft).

Automated, safe handling.

Precision Drilling Trust, meanwhile, says
its Super Series Rigs, likewise, are designed to
reduce the time required to rig down and rig
up. With 240 single, double and triple rigs,
along with coiled tubing units, Precision is
Canada’s largest drilling contractor. In August
2008 with approval of a definitive agreement
to acquire giant U.S. contractor Grey Wolf Inc.,
giving the company a presence in virtually

every drilling basin the U.S. and Canada, said
CEO Kevin Neveu. With its Super Series
units, Mr. Neveu said a full rig move can be
accomplished in less than two hours. “Our
Super Series rigs offer the industry leading
mobility with significantly fewer loads. Since
no cranes are required, drilling can commence
much faster.”
Complementing the technical advances in
drilling rig efficiency, is improved fracture
stimulation being employed extensively in the
booming Bakken play that reaches from
southern Saskatchewan to Montana and
North Dakota and is said to hold upwards of
400 billion bbl of recoverable oil. Much of the
horizontal and frac enhancements in the
Bakken were developed by giant Halliburton
Energy Services, but until its acquisition by
Crescent Point Energy Trust in 2006, Mission
Oil & Gas was credited with playing a
substantial role in pioneering the use of
fracture-stimulated horizontal wells.
In 2006, Petrobank Energy and Resources
was one of the first to focus on sequential
fracturing technologies to improve production
rates and enhance recoveries. By modifying
the application of existing fracture stimulation
techniques, the operator said it “achieved
production results that exceeded expectations
by a wide margin.”
The Petrobank approach involves sequential
fracturing in isolated high quality portions of
the reservoir and allows improved concentration
and containment of the frac within the
formation. Historically, previous frac techniques
intruded the zone, causing an immediate
influx of water from surrounding formations
and a rapid decline in production rates.
Terry Gomke, in his role as Chair of the AEDA,
is a prime spokesman for the technologies
developed in the province.
“I have traveled the world with Canadian
technologies and they are second to none. I
am a firm believer that our technologies will
continue to lead the world,” he said.

eflecting the increase in global
consumption, refiners of western
Canada petroleum, likewise, are steadily
increasing their demands, prompting a
frenzied rush to develop more pipeline
capacity out of the province.
The most extensive projects currently in
various stages of construction are expansions
of the giant Enbridge inter-provincial pipeline
and TransCanada Keystone systems. Expansions
of these two networks, both of which are
planned for completion in 2010 and 2009,
respectively, will increase cumulative capacity
by 1 million bbl/d, CAPP said in its June 2008
Crude Oil Forecast, Markets & Pipeline Expansions.
These two networks and the Kinder Morgan
Trans Mountain pipeline comprise the three
primary trunklines delivering Alberta crude
throughout Canada and the US.
With the expansions now underway to
deliver more Alberta crude, CAPP reports
approximately 1.1 million bbl/d of pipeline
capacity is being added through the end of
2010.
As President and CEO of multi-faceted
Gibson Energy, Terry Gomke says the growth
prospects of his company directly reflect the
diversity and continual growth of the Alberta
energy sector. The largest midstream company
in Canada, each year delivering millions of
barrels of crude oil and other energy supplies
to Canadian and US markets, Gibson was
acquired in August 2008 by Riverstone
Holdings, which manages a group of energyfocused private equity funds. Shortly after the
acquisition, the company announced a growth
projection nothing short of remarkable.
“Clearly, Riverstone’s goal is to double or
triple the size of Gibson over the next three to
five years,” said Mr. Gomke. “The opportunities
are there and if we continue to provide good
service and competitive skills, I think we have
the opportunity to achieve this.”
With all the expansions on the boards to
increase carrying capacity, there is little doubt

RESPONSIBLE CARE® PROGRAM
Responsible Care® exemplifies the
philosophy of ‘doing the right
thing’. Nexen began a series of oil
and gas industry “firsts” when it
introduced Responsible Care® at its
Balzac, Alberta Gas plant in 2002. In
2006, they decided to adopt the
Responsible Care® program across
the balance of their Canadian operations. It is a voluntary global initiative established to improve health,
safety, social and environmental
performance which is confirmed
through an external verification
process. The initiative concentrates
on morals and principles rather than
regulations. Formally introduced in
1985, Responsible Care® focused on
improvements in the chemicals
industry. Now the initiative has been
adopted in 57 countries.

that everyone involved with moving production
from the wellhead to increasingly thirsty
refineries will have ample opportunities.
By far, the most extensive expansion is
centered around the Enbridge network that
transports liquid hydrocarbons from Edmonton
to the Midwestern U.S. and eastern Canada.
With a number of expansions over the years,
the Enbridge network now runs 13,500 km
(8,500 miles), making it the world’s longest
pipeline system. Enbridge’s Alberta Clipper, a
new 36-in. pipeline running from Alberta to
Wisconsin, initially will increase capacity of
the system by 450,000 bbl/day, eventually
increasing to 800,000 bbl/day. Enbridge
explained the pipeline will include both new
construction and the conversion of existing
pipe currently used to transport natural gas.
The pipeliner has also proposed a twophase program to increase western Canadian
crude to eastern US refineries. When it begins
operation in the fourth quarter of 2010, Phase
1 would increase capacity to 120,000 bbl/d to
address growing demand by Marathon’s
refinery in Detroit, while the second phase,
which could be operational by 2013, would
serve Toledo and Lima, Ohio refineries with
capacity increasing to 430,000 bbl/day.
Enbridge added that its Waupisoo Pipeline,
which began operation this year, now links
oil sands producers to their upgraders and
refineries in the Edmonton area as well as
connecting with Canada’s interprovincial oil
pipeline systems. The company is also
looking at delivering to the refinery-rich U.S.
Gulf Coast.
In August, Enbridge and BP Pipelines
(North America) Inc. entered into an
agreement to develop a new delivery system to
transport Canadian heavy crude oil from
Illinois to Houston and Texas City, TX. The new
system is expected to be in service by late 2012
with an initial capacity of 250,000 bbl/day.
“This proposed project offers timely and
economic access for shippers to the U.S. Gulf

Coast market,” said Enbridge Executive Vice
President, Liquids Pipelines Steve Wuor. “The
new system would be a continuation of our
phased approach to Gulf Coast market access,
which has the objectives of minimizing capital
cost and financial commitments required of
shippers, maximizing use of existing pipelines
and rights-of-way and ensuring attractive
producer netbacks.”
Enbridge is far from alone in expanding
capacity to help move Alberta petroleum into
the market.
The TransCanada Keystone pipeline project
will create a new link from Hardesty to
terminals in Wood River and Patoka when it is
expected to enter service in December 2009
with an initial capacity of 435,000 bbl/d.
Gibson’s original facility with a then2,000-bbl capacity, Hardesty now surpasses
Edmonton as the largest hub in the Enbridge
network. Hardesty remains the primary hub
for oil sands production, connecting with
lines running south from Fort McMurray
and branching into the U.S. through the
Enbridge or Kinder Morgan network. Upon
its completion, the TransCanada’s Keystone
Pipeline Project will provide Hardesty access
to three different routes into the U.S.

The 3,456-km Keystone Pipeline will
transport crude from Hardesty and into
Illinois and Oklahoma. In July, 2008, 110year-old Canadian mechanical construction
contractor Lockerbie & Hole was awarded a
$53 million contract to construct eight
pumping stations for the
pipeline. In addition to
providing ample product
to feed pipelines, the
exploding unconventional
oil sand and Bakken Shale
plays are also creating
booming activity for
marketers and distributors of well site fluids.
“With the new technology being developed
for horizontal fracturing and horizontal
drilling, this business became very interesting
and we have grown to be one of the largest
well site fluid producers and distributors in
the country. We have achieved around 50% of
the market and we are continuing to develop
that business, not only in fracturing fluids,
but recycling as well,” said Mr. Gomke. “We
recycle and reprocess some of the fluids as
they come back from the wells and turn them
into an environmentally acceptable product
so that they can be reused.”

Downstream and Marketing

Bitumen is transported to the Scotford Upgrader, near Fort Saskatchewan.

From its origins as an independent marketing
company in 1953, Gibson Energy Services has
matured to become the premier midstream
company in Canada. For 55 years, Gibson has
played a significant role in the country’s
petroleum industry by linking upstream
producers with downstream refiners.
Gibson’s inter-related business divisions
produce synergies between its services,
including marketing and transportation, as
well as distribution and processing of energy
products. Gibson also provides wholesale and
retail propane service through its affiliate
Canwest Propane and is now the second
largest distributor in Canada.
The company annually moves millions of
barrels of energy products to market through
a continually expanded network of facilities
and infrastructure that include terminals,
pipelines, tank storage and more than 1,000
trucks. At its Edmonton facility, for instance,
Gibson handles all the rail car transport of
PetroCanada’s diesel refinery.
Its Moose Jaw Refinery is a major producer
of road asphalt, roofing flux, well site fluids
and light products which are distributed
across Canada and the US. In addition,
Gibson has become a leading specialist in the
blending and handling of heavy oil, including
the processing of diluents required for oil
sands and other heavy crude.
With its focus on diversity, Gibson’s
Edmonton terminal has been transformed
into a multi-products facility, distributing
asphalt, heavy crude, propane, distillates,
natural gas liquids, butane. The terminal is
easily accessible to all the major pipelines
running through the Edmonton hub.

“Clearly, Riverstone’s goal is
to double or triple the size of
Gibson over the next three to
five years.”
Terry Gomke, President and CEO of Gibson Energy

The interconnection with the company’s
marketing, transportation and tourmaline
businesses provide synergies that give Gibson
unprecedented advantages for the Alberta
market. In the future, Gibson will continue to
develop its advantages into new opportunities
for future developments, both from the oil
sands and new markets, while investigating
ways it can help meet the province’s sweeping
environmental strategy.
The company’s unique position and
strategic location gives it the capability of
responding effectively to a wide range of client
requests from blending to distribution.

Alberta Securing Tomorrow’s
Prosperity Today
The Future

Pro-business province a model for global
energy investment

W

ith worldwide oil and gas demand
ever rising, Canada, led by resourcerich and investment friendly Alberta, has
positioned itself as one of the worlds most
stable and bountiful future energy suppliers.
While the province leads the way in
investments for alternative energy research,
global energy experts agree the world will
have to depend on fossil fuels for decades
to come. With global supplies becoming
increasingly controlled by unpredictable and
often unstable governments, the world’s
consumers can look to Alberta and Canada
as a plentiful, transparent, democratic and
politically stable energy supplier.
The Alberta oil sands, whose proven
reserves are the second largest in the world,
have become the fuel for the thriving
Canadian economy, creating thousands of
jobs throughout Alberta and Canada,
generating record revenue and spurring
technology, innovation and research. At a
time where global reserves of light and easily
accessible supplies are dwindling rapidly, the
enormous heavy reserves of the oil sands have
given Alberta a predominate role on the
world’s energy stage.
Attracted by the oil sands, nearly all of the
major oil and gas operators have a presence
in Alberta, bringing their international
experience to the province. More importantly,
the technological advancements created by
Albertan and Canadian companies, such as
their innovations in hydraulic fracturing for
horizontal well developed for the booming
Bakken Oil Shale campaign, are now finding
applications around the world.
Alberta also has evolved into a center of
excellence when it comes to developing
technologies for clean production of the oil
sands. Revolutionary in-situ extraction
techniques and engineering designs to
dramatically reduce water consumption have
served to minimize the environmental
footprint of the oil sands, while helping

The road ahead is promising.

increase production and optimize operational
efficiency. Many of those innovations focus
on balancing economic prosperity with
world-leading environmental stewardship.
The provincial government, working handin-hand with industry and citizens alike, has
invested heavily in the development of
global-leading environmental technologies
and programs, many of which are applicable
to developing nations. The unique Carbon
Capture and Storage (CCS) program, which
is only one component of the province’s allinclusive Climate Change Strategy, has the
ambitious goal of capturing and safely
sequestering 100% of the CO2 emitted into
the atmosphere from the oil sands and other
Alberta industrial facilities. While some may
see this as an overly ambitious target, the
government and industry say they are
committed to working together to someday
make Alberta a zero emitter of carbon.
Complementing the CCS program are
comprehensive initiatives to protect the
province’s water supplies and return onceindustrial land to a pristine landscape,
effectively debunking what those in the
administration and industry proclaim as the
“myth of dirty oil.”
For companies locating bases in Alberta,
the province offers its employees one of the
most desirable living environments the world
has to offer. From unsurpassed natural beauty

and a host of outdoor recreational opportunities,
including nearby Banff National Park, the
province boasts one of the finest educational
and medical systems in North America.
On top of all that, Alberta, the only debtfree jurisdiction in North America, offers
investors a completely transparent and businessfriendly environment with the lowest income
and corporate tax rates on the continent.
But, Alberta is not resting on its past and
present successes. Rather, the province is
working tirelessly to ensure the prosperity of
today is secured for tomorrow. Its $22-billion
infrastructure plan, by far the highest such
investment in North America, is earmarked to
improve housing, roads and municipal
services. Much of that investment is being
destined for Fort McMurray to enhance an
infrastructure affected by the rush to the oil
sands. Furthermore, the province, through
its Ministry of Aboriginal Relations, has
undertaken a host of initiatives to protect the
rights of its indigenous people.
Even as the province strives to secure its
future prosperity, Premier Ed Stelmach says it
will never do so by compromising its deeply
held commitments to the environment and
its people.
“While we work to expand trade and
investment opportunities, we remain committed
to being good stewards of the environment
and that will never change.”

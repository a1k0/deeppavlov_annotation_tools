New AquaStim Water Frac
Service with GasPerm 1000™
Technology Helps Major
Independent Operator Boost
Gas Production.
SM

The Challenge:
Texas Panhandle—Recently, Halliburton introduced
its specially formulated SandWedge® enhancer and
OptiKleen-WF™ agent to the Operator’s normal
four-stage water frac completions in the Granite Wash
play in the Texas Panhandle. The results were a major
uplift in efficiency and total well productivity,with less
sand production, improved fluid recovery and fewer
post-stimulation completion issues. To build on this
success, the company asked Halliburton for new ideas
to further enhance the economics of the company’s
prospects in the area.

In ultra-tight formations,
water imbibition and phase trapping can greatly
reduce gas production. GasPerm 1000 surfactant helps reduce this damage.

The Solution:
After a review of existing conditions, Halliburton recommended the new AquaStim
water frac service which includes the breakthrough GasPerm 1000 technology.
GasPerm 1000 service helps control fracture face damage and boost production
from unconventional gas wells, including tight gas, shale and coalbed methane.

The Results:
The average initial production of gas had been 2,472 mcf/d, with the total for the
first 30 days averaging 55,380 mcf. The introduction of AquaStim service with
GasPerm 1000 technology resulted in initial production of 4,084 mcf/d and a 30
day average total of 92,100 mcf. The average 30-day increase was 36,720 mcf,
creating an economic value of approximately $782,000. Based on these results,
Halliburton’s AquaStim service has been integrated into the Operator’s
completion process for use on other unconventional gas wells.

Halliburton has the energy to help. For more information about how AquaStim water frac service can help make
unconventional gas assets more profitable, e-mail stimulation@halliburton.com.

UK N. Sea operators eye international markets

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

A growing number of UK North Sea operators are focusing on
building their businesses in international markets, which could
threaten future investment in the UK North Sea, according to a
survey published Jan. 30 by the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber
of Commerce.
The survey found that 65% of operators are looking to invest
their money elsewhere, in North and West Africa, Russia, and Australia, for example. High UK petroleum taxation, soaring technical
and resource costs to develop mature areas in the UK North Sea,
and a lack of long-term legislative policies are the main reasons
operators give for expanding into international markets.
The UK Offshore Operators Association estimates that the oil
services and goods export market in the UK is worth £6 billion.
Chamber Chief Executive Geoff Runcie welcomed the opportunity
for Aberdeen-based companies to grow their businesses internationally but stressed, “We need continued investment at home in
exploration levels and both our offshore and onshore infrastructure
to ensure the longevity of our indigenous oil and gas industry.”
About 87% of North Sea operators and contractors are working
at or above optimum levels, indicating strong investment in the
mature UK North Sea, the survey said. In 2005 the UK sourced
3 million boe/d from the North Sea for its energy needs. The UK
produces over 90% of its own gas and nearly 100% of its oil from
the UK Continental Shelf.
Companies in the supply chain are moving towards having
longer and collaborative contracts and have reduced their focus in
2004-06 on cost reduction, risk sharing, and penalty clauses in
their contracts. The survey said operators and contractors continue
to be concerned about safety and environmental issues.
According to the survey, 44% of contractors said UKCS exploration-related activity levels rose over the last 4 months, and 39%
expect this trend to continue over the next year. However, last year
oil prices hit a high of $75/bbl and have now fallen to $50/bbl.
The survey looked at North Sea activities from September 2006
to January of this year.

The country has the second-largest natural gas reserves in South
America after Venezuela.
Ortiz previously worked for foreign energy companies, including Brazil’s state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), the biggest investor in Bolivia’s gas and oil industry, analysts said.
It is thought that Ortiz was given the task of smoothing relations with the country’s largest gas customer, Brazil, which imports
26 million cu m/day of gas from Bolivia via the 3,150-km BoliviaBrazil gas pipeline. Morales wants to increase the cost of gas to
$5/MMbtu from $4.
Petrobras officials, speaking under the condition of anonymity,
told OGJ that Ortiz was trying to convince Morales to limit the
price increase of gas exported to Brazil to $4.50/MMbtu.
Last year Bolivia negotiated a price hike to $5/MMbtu for the 5
million cu m/day of gas it exports to Argentina. Meanwhile, it sells
gas for $1.09 to a thermoelectric plant in Cuiaba, western Brazil,
delivered via a 267-km pipeline in which Royal Dutch Shell PLC
holds a 38% stake.
Morales omitted, however, that gas volumes supplied to the
Cuiaba plant usually average little more than 1 million cu m/day.
Morales recently said that Bolivia “can no longer continue subsidizing natural gas to Brazil.” He began nationalizing Bolivia’s energy industry in May 2006 after winning an election campaign
pledging to increase state control of natural resources.
Ortiz’s resignation comes after Morales suspended key parts of
the role of YPFB in the state takeover of Bolivia’s oil and gas resources in a move analysts said highlighted the company’s lack of
money and technical expertise.
The implementation of the energy nationalization has been delayed, while a cash-strapped YPFB struggles to assume control of
the sector.
As part of the nationalization, Bolivia also hiked taxes to as
much as 82% from 18% on some multinational companies and
ordered YPFB to hold a majority stake in several foreign-owned
refineries. The additional revenue is expected to breathe fresh financial life into YPFB.

Ortiz, head of Bolivia’s YPFB, resigns

Georgia chooses Azerbaijan as main gas supplier

Juan Carlos Ortiz, head of Bolivia’s state-owned Yacimientos
Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), has resigned over disagreements with the government.
Ortiz said he had resigned because of differences with the government of President Evo Morales over its oil and gas nationalization policies.
Ortiz is the second head of the company to resign since Morales
nationalized Bolivia’s gas industry on May 1, 2006 (OGJ Online,
May 2, 2006).

Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has announced that
neighboring Azerbaijan will be his country’s main supplier of natural gas, but that he would still like to keep Russia as a supplier to
ensure diversity.
About one third of Georgia’s gas is already on its way from
Azerbaijan, and by February-March, about 80% will be coming
from that country, Saakashvili told Russia’s Ekho Moskvy radio station.
He said, “It is not good to have just one channel, even if it is
a very friendly one, as there may be many technical and other”

channel” but that it is “hard to predict, and prices there are completely crazy.”
Azerbaijan’s Azarigaz began exporting gas Jan. 11 along the
Haciqabul-Qazax-Tbilisi trunkline to Georgia, which is seeking to
reduce its dependence on increasingly expensive Russian supplies
(OGJ Online, Jan. 11, 2007).

EPA issues state underground tank guidelines
Underground storage tank manufacturers and installers must
have financial resources to clean up a site if a leak or spill occurs
due to improper manufacturing or installation, the US Environmental Protection Agency said as it issued two final grant guidelines for states on Jan. 24.
The guidelines, which implement key underground storage
tank provisions in the 2005 Energy Policy Act (EPACT), also require a state’s public record to include the number, sources, and
causes of releases; tank compliance records; and data on equipment
failures, EPA said.

Exploration

&

The first set of guidelines describes the minimum financial responsibility and installer certification provision requirements for
states to comply with EPACT. These include definitions, requirements, criteria, and options for states in implementing the provision.
By Feb. 8, states receiving federal funds under Subtitle I of the
Waste Disposal Act must implement either these guidelines or the
second containment grant guidelines that EPA issued in November
2006, the federal agency said.
EPA will assist states as they implement programs in appropriate cases if the states demonstrate good faith and progress toward
meeting the requirements.
The public record guidelines describe minimum requirements
for states meeting the public record provision under EPACT. They
include developing and updating the public record, making it
available, describing the minimum public record content, ensuring data quality, and demonstrating and ensuring compliance with
guidelines, EPA said. ✦

Development

Chevron unit ﬁnds oil on Block 14 off Angola
Chevron Corp. subsidiary Cabinda Gulf Oil Co. Ltd. (Cabgoc)
and its partners reported an oil discovery on deepwater Block 14
off Angola. The well, Lucapa-1, found more than 280 net ft of oil
in Miocene-age sands.
Lucapa-1 was drilled in October 2006 in 3,940 ft of water to
a 10,958 ft TVD. The well, which was tested in November 2006,
flowed 24° gravity oil from high-permeability sand in the main
target interval.
The discovery is the 10th exploration well drilled on Block 14
since 1997.
Also under development on Block 14 is the $2.3 billion Benguela Belize-Lobito Tomboco (BBLT) project, which started up in
January 2006. Once fully developed, BBLT will produce an estimated 200,000 b/d of oil in 2008.
Also, in June 2006, Chevron began production from the Landana
North reservoir in the Tombua-Landana development area of Block
14 by producing through the BBLT facility. When developed, Tombua-Landana is expected to achieve peak production of 100,000
b/d of oil by 2010 through its own facility.
Cabgoc, with 31% interest, serves as operator of the Block 14
contractor group, which includes Total E&P Angola 20%, Sonangol
20%, Eni Angola Exploration BV 20%, and GALP 9%.

BP discovers gas with Egypt’s Giza North-1 well

BP has found an estimated 1 tcf of natural gas with its Giza
North-1 exploratory well in the North Alexandria concession off
Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea. The well encountered a significant
gas accumulation as part of a large channel complex, BP said.
The partners, BP, RWE Dae AG, and EGPC/EGAS, will drill an
appraisal well to evaluate the large complex in April.
Sameh Fahmi, the Egyptian petroleum minister, said that the
well penetrated an 80 m gas-bearing layer that was a Pliocene formation. BP has made three previous discoveries in that formation:
Taurus, Libra, and Fayoum. The company also drilled the Raven
discovery well in the deeper pre-Pliocene formation.
The group will move the rig to the next appraisal well site in the
Taurus field as part of a planned four-well appraisal program in the
North Alexandria concession.

The two Ton Chan area wells are on Block 16 in the Bongkot
concession, 5 km from each other and 15 km southeast of the
Bongkot Central Complex (BCC).
Ton Chan-1X found gas-bearing reservoirs with a total of 143
m net pay thickness, while Ton Chan-2X found gas with a total of
44 m net pay thickness.
Ton Rang-2X is on Block 15 of the Bongkot concession, 5 km
south of the Ton Rang-1X discovery and 20 km northwest of the
BCC. Ton Rang-2X found gas-bearing sand of 72 m.
Total said a development plan for the three discoveries is under
study and that production could start in 2009. Bongkot produces
600 MMcfd of gas and 18,000 b/d of condensate. Member companies of the Bongkot joint venture are Total 33.33%, Thailand’s
PTT E&P (operator) 44.45%, and BG Group 22.22%.

Ecopetrol sets $2 billion E&P budget for 2007
Colombia’s state-owned Ecopetrol plans to invest $2 billion this
year to explore for and produce oil and gas. Ecopetrol spent $1.3
billion in 2006, the company reported.
Colombia will produce 520,000 b/d of oil in 2007. Ecopetrol
and other companies must invest to sustain that level of production
in the future, said Ecopetrol Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla.
The investment is needed to recover the country’s proved reserves that topped 3 billion bbl in years’ past, dropped to 1.5 bil-

Drilling

&

lion bbl in 2004, remained at that level in 2005, and increased a bit
in 2006, Carrasquilla said.
Ecopetrol target is to invest $12.5 billion over the next 5 years
to sustain the country’s output levels. Oil is currently Colombia’s
leading export and source of foreign income, constituting one
third of the country’s foreign revenues.
All oil production is undertaken by Ecopetrol in contracts of
association with foreign companies.
Most of the Colombian oil industry runs through joint ventures
between Ecopetrol and international companies, some of which
have heavily financed the construction of pipelines. Investment
from these multinational corporations has led to the creation of
the oil infrastructure that exists in Colombia today. BP PLC and Occidental Petroleum Corp. are among the largest international companies in the Colombian oil sector.
Colombia has become a hot spot for oil and gas exploration in
Latin America as energy multinationals face increasing hostile business conditions elsewhere in the region, industry experts say. Key
attractions include a steep, sustained fall in guerrilla attacks under
President Alvaro Uribe—now in his second 4-year term—and a
reduction of taxes.
The government has drawn up incentives to attract oil companies, including cutting Ecopetrol’s mandatory stake to 50-55% in
any exploration contract with a private-sector company. This compares with the 70% required over the past 30 years. ✦

Production

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Shell inks deal with NIOC, Repsol YPF for LNG

Eni: Kashagan ﬁeld more ‘generous’ than thought

Royal Dutch Shell PLC has signed an upstream services agreement with National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC), the Iranian stateowned oil company, and Repsol YPF SA to further investigate the
feasibility of the upstream element of their proposed Persian LNG
project.
A Shell spokesman told OGJ that Shell would look at constructing gas production facilities, hand them over to NIOC, and recoup
its expenditure once gas production has started under a buyback
contract.
The consortium hopes to build an 8.1 million-tonne/year liquefaction plant that could be expanded with a second train to target markets in India, the Far East, and Europe.
Shell emphasized that this was not a final investment decision
to go ahead with Persian LNG and that Shell is about a year or so
away from taking that step. Persian LNG covers Phases 13 and 14
of South Pars gas field.
The services agreement will help to inform the final investment
on Persian LNG. According to Iranian reports, the deal is worth $10
billion for both upstream work and the LNG infrastructure.
Shell’s move defies pressure from Washington, DC, on non-US
companies to stop investment in Iran because of its uranium enriching activities, which Washington fears is the basis for nuclear
weapon development.
Iran only offers buyback contracts to attract energy investment
in the country, but many western companies have found the terms
limiting and have not invested.

Kashagan oil field in Kazakhstan is more “generous” than expected, said Eni SPA’s Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni Jan. 25, indicating that Kashagan may have higher production rates than originally anticipated.
The Eni-led project in the North Caspian Sea has been delayed
by environmental problems and technical challenges. Production,
planned to start in 2005, has been postponed to 2009.
Kazakh state-owned energy company KazMunaiGaz is investigating the project to determine why higher costs and delays have
occurred. Scaroni said audits are normal, and Eni is not worried by
the checks. Within coming weeks, it will publish a schedule and
cost structure for starting commercial oil extraction at Kashagan,
he added.
Eni in 2004 estimated field development at $29 billion over 15
years. Last March, Eni increased costs for Kashagan by $4-5 billion
because of a weakened dollar and higher equipment costs.
The Caspian Sea is shallow and freezes from November-February, posing access problems for the consortium. Meeting stringent
environmental standards is proving costly and time-consuming,
and the field’s high pressures and levels of hydrogen sulfide are
complicating field development.
Kashagan has recoverable reserves of 13 billion bbl. It will be
developed in multiple phases: Under Phase I, production will reach
75,000 b/d and gradually increase to 450,000 b/d. Production
will increase during the following stages at an expected plateau of
1.2 million b/d. ✦

Processing
Irving starts ﬁlings for second St. John reﬁnery
Irving Oil Ltd., St. John, NB, started the permitting process with
provincial and federal authorities to build a second refinery at St.
John.
A filing was made to initiate the necessary environmental impact assessments, Irving said Jan. 25.
The proposed $5-7 billion facility, to be built near the Irving
Canaport deepwater crude receiving terminal, would have a designed capacity of as much as 300,000 b/d.
It would be the first major refinery built in North America in
nearly a quarter century (OGJ, Oct. 23, 2006, Newsletter).
A review by authorities under the New Brunswick Environmental Impact Assessment Regulation and the Canadian Environmental
Assessment Act could take as long as 24 months.
Irving continues to invest in its existing, 250,000 b/d refinery
at St. John. That refinery, Canada’s largest, supplies more than 75%
of Canada’s gasoline exports to the US and 19% of all US gasoline
imports.

Oryx plant produces GTL products for ﬁrst time
The Oryx GTL plant in Qatar has produced its first gas-to-liquids products under its start-up plan, and its products will be ready
for international markets by the end of March.
Sasol Ltd., a major partner in the $950 million project, said in
January that the plant was producing waxy synthetic crude, the
intermediate result of the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process in creating GTL products, and it would move on to testing the product
workup unit. This is the world’s first GTL plant on a commercial
scale using the proprietary, low-temperature Sasol slurry phase

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
distillate process based on F-T technology (OGJ, Mar. 14, 2005,
p. 18).
The plant will convert 330 MMcfd of lean gas from Qatar’s vast
North gas field into 34,000 b/d of ultralow-sulfur diesel: 24,000
b/d of diesel, 9,000 b/d of naphtha, and 1,000 b/d of liquid petroleum gas. Diesels will be sent to Europe and naphtha to the Far
East. LPG will be used for local consumption.
The plant was officially inaugurated in June last year and has
undergone a sequential plan to test the processes. The partners have
proposed expanding capacity at Oryx to 100,000 b/d in the future.
Oryx GTL is a joint venture of state-owned Qatar Petroleum Co.
51%, and Sasol 49%.

Contract let for Songo Songo plant expansion
Globeleq, an operating power company and operator of the
Songas gas-to-electricity project, has let an engineering and project management consultancy contract to Foster Wheeler South Africa (Pty.) Ltd. for the expansion of the Songo Songo Island gas
processing facility in Tanzania. The value of the contract was not
disclosed.
The Songo Songo Island gas processing facility is part of the
Songas integrated gas-to-electricity facility. With the planned expansion of the gas processing plant, capacity will double to 140
MMscfd.
The processing plant processes gas from Songo Songo Island
gas fields. The gas is then transported via a 225-km subsea and
onshore pipeline to the Ubungo electric power station in Dar es
Salaam and to other industrial users (OGJ Online, July 26, 2004,
Newsletter). ✦

Gassco plans Nordic gas pipeline
Norwegian gas pipeline operator Gassco AS has submitted a
plan to the Norwegian energy ministry to develop a 3 billion cu
m/year gas pipeline from Kårstø in western Norway to eastern
Norway, western Sweden, and Denmark.
Plans call for 463 km of 24-in. pipeline to be laid from Kårstø
to the Grenland industrial region in eastern Norway and a 270-km,
18-in. section to be laid from Grenland to Sweden. From Sweden
to Denmark an existing pipeline operated by Nova Naturgas will
be used.
After carrying out a feasibility study for the past 2 years, Gassco
has received interests from seven companies to own 70% of the
proposed pipeline, while another nine have committed to pay for
the right to use it.
A Gassco spokesman told OGJ that 14 companies—from Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish industry and energy sectors—will
spend $23.6 million on the preengineering phase that will continue until 2009.
For the project to continue, Gassco needs to secure binding

purchase contracts before June 30. “The investing companies can
renounce their transport undertakings if such contracts are not in
place by then,” Gassco said.
Norwegian Minister of Petroleum and Energy Odd Roger Enoksen said the government will discuss how it can contribute to the
project. “I will shortly have meetings with my Scandinavian colleagues to discuss the gas pipeline project,” he said.
Gassco plans to make a final development decision in 2009 and
start operations in 2012.

Lukoil lets pipelay contract for Yuri Korchagin ﬁeld
OAO Lukoil unit Lukoil-Nizhnevolzhskneft LLC has let a subsea
pipeline installation contract to a unit of J. Ray McDermott SA for
the Yuri Korchagin oil field pipeline project, 180 km off Russia in
the Caspian Sea.
Under the contract J. Ray will install 58 km of 12-in. pipe connecting the ice-resistant fixed platform No. 1 (LSP-1) to a singlepoint mooring buoy south of Yuri Korchagin field.
J. Ray also will provide design engineering, procurement, installation, and testing of the line. ✦

transportation fuel.
“There are about 25,000 NGVs [natural gas vehicles] in the greater Bangkok area,” Bunsumpun said. According
to government plans, the number will
reach 500,000 by 2011. “The number
of NGV fueling stations will need to

Gas still is a major fuel of power

demand in Thailand. Through aggressive development of combined-cycle
gas-turbine capacity, gas represents
about 70% of the total generation fuel
mix—the highest levels of gas penetration in the world, Bunsumpun said.

Maintaining sustainability
“Given limited growth potential of
our domestic gas reserves,” Bunsumpun
said, “we need to look beyond our own
indigenous resources to ensure sustainable supply.” Among its other projects,
PTT is developing an LNG project that
will have an import facility with a
capacity of 5 million tonnes/year, expandable to 10 million tonnes/year.
The facility is scheduled to distribute LNG to existing and new pipeline
networks by 2011. PTT is securing LNG
from suppliers in the Middle East, Asia,
and Australia.
Bunsumpun said PTT’s gas development plan will involve more than $13
billion of investment in the next 5
years.

access to clean energy, increased national competitiveness, and contributes to

Why expand the SPR?
A plan to double capacity of the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve typifies the cascading misjudgment driving US energy policy. In his state-ofthe-union address Jan. 23, President George W.
Bush announced plans to raise capacity of the SPR
to 1.5 billion bbl by 2027. In the same speech,
he proposed that the mandate for renewable fuel
sold with gasoline, now set to grow to 7.5 billion
gal/year by 2012, be expanded to 35 billion gal/
year by 2027. In conjunction with an unspecified
toughening of fuel-economy standards for new
vehicles, this is supposed to cut US consumption
of gasoline over the next 10 years by 20% from
projected levels.
The administration’s rationale for expanding
the SPR illustrates recklessly incomplete thinking. A
White House fact sheet accompanying the president’s address notes that the 691 million bbl of
crude oil now in the SPR would cover net imports
for “only” 55 days. This it compares with the 118
days of calculated import coverage of 1985, when
the SPR contained 493 million bbl. The arithmetic
does not establish that 118 days is an optimum
level of import coverage. It does not account for
changes that the oil market has undergone since
1985. And it does not explain why import coverage should determine how much oil the government holds in noncommercial inventory or—most
importantly—would be willing to pay for.

‘Insurance policy’
The administration’s fact sheet redundantly
calls the SPR “an insurance policy in the event of
a severe supply disruption, such as from a natural
disaster or a terrorist attack, in the energy supply
chain.” The US has sustained natural disasters and
terrorist attacks, not one of which has come close
to testing the drawdown rate or duration limits of
the SPR at its current size. To argue that the inventory needs to grow on these bases is specious.
The SPR’s main historic value in fact has been
to discourage major exporters from manipulating
oil supply to influence global politics. In the decade or so after the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74,
the argument for hoarding crude oil as a geopolitical counterbalance carried weight. If anything,

subsequent market changes have weakened the
case.
Development and population growth have
made exporters more dependent on oil sales than
they were in the 1970s. Furthermore, the market
is much more flexible than it was then and better
able to accommodate disruption. The oil export
weapon, therefore, isn’t what it used to be. The
energy policies of major importing nations should
have adapted to these changes long ago.
A new look at the SPR, not a random expansion, is in order. The government should assess
drawdown capacities against supply disruptions of
the size and nature that might really occur. Then
it should examine the costs of buying oil that no
one can do anything with except under extreme
conditions. Those costs are considerable. A realistic
assessment might well conclude that the US has
more protection than it needs against probable
supply jolts and that the SPR should shrink. The
willy-nilly assertion that the strategic inventory
needs to double looks like a fiscally irresponsible
distraction from serious energy policy-making.

Raising costs
But cost receives little attention in Bush’s energy
plan. The government can’t lower consumption of
gasoline without raising costs through new taxes
or substitution of something more expensive.
Bush has chosen the latter, politically easier course,
which camouflages the costs. In case anyone has
forgotten, the Energy Information Administration
has calculated that ethanol, at the substance’s current level of subsidy, deprives the federal treasury
of 44.9¢/gal. Ethanol production is raising the
price of corn. And ethanol distribution will keep
pressure on the price of diesel. Expanding the
mandate will multiply the economic damage.
The US enjoyed a couple of good decades during which markets set fuel prices and the main
government intrusions were government-imposed
limits on supply. To the peril of consumers and
taxpayers, the government is reentering the energy
business, raising costs needlessly under several
dangerous pretenses, prominent among which
is the assertion that political leaders know how
much energy people should use. ✦

Solarmine is a collaboration of Chevron and an Energy Conversion Devices

Texaco merged with Chevron.
An array of 4,800 amorphous-silicon
solar panels, each about 1.3 ft by 18 ft,
are mounted on metal frames facing
south. The panels are arranged into
400 strings with each string having 12
panel modules. The array area covers
2.8 acres, and the entire Solarmine
complex covers 6 acres.
The project cost, excluding the land,
was $4.86 million. Chevron recouped
half of that expense with a $2.43 million

said energy efﬁciency and reliability
are important to Chevron because
energy is one of the biggest expenses
in oil and gas operations.
“Chevron has achieved a 27% improvement in energy efﬁciency since
1992 to present,” Stone said. “That is
about $1 billion/year out of our average cost structure. We lowered energy
costs through energy efﬁciency.”
CES works on upstream, downstream, and midstream projects for
Chevron and other clients. Customers
include federal government agencies,
universities, and others.
“We design and build projects,
both energy-efﬁciency and renewablepower projects, for customers as well
as for our own facilities,” Stone said.
“To our knowledge, none of the other
oil and gas companies have a business that looks like Chevron Energy
Solutions.”
CES estimates that in 2005 it saved
its customers more than 177 kw-hr of
electricity and 1.185 tcf of natural gas,
equivalent to avoiding 97,000 tonnes of
CO2 emissions.
Stone said CES is technology-neutral
and product-neutral because it does
not have any of its own proprietary
technology or equipment that it’s trying
to sell.
“We are familiar with all state-ofthe-art best technologies, whether it is
alternative energy, renewable power,

It has been suggested that some

when the CRP contracts expire. Of the
34.8 million acres currently under CRP
contracts, 13.3 million acres, or almost
40% of the total, are in North Dakota,

amounts to just 0.3% of current US

It is worth noting that any conversion of CRP land back to crop production would have serious erosion
implications. On a silt-loam soil with
12% slope in Ohio, the soil loss from a
field of wheat was 57 times the soil loss
from a field of second-year grass. The
soil loss from a field seeded with canola

Bush seeks lower gasoline use, expands SPR
US President George W. Bush has set
ambitious goals for displacing gasoline
with renewable fuels and has announced plans to double capacity of the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).
In his state-of-the-union address Jan.
23, Bush called for a 20% reduction in
gasoline use against projected levels by
2017.
According to a fact sheet accompanying his address, 15 percentage points
of the reduction would come from an
increase in the federal mandate for use
of renewable fuels to 35 billion gal/
year by 2017.
A renewable-fuels mandate imposed
by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 will
reach 7.5 billion gal/year by 2012. The
mandate has stimulated an expansion in
the US capacity to produce fuel ethanol
from corn. Fuel ethanol and corn both
receive federal tax subsidies.
Bush proposed to broaden the mandate to include other renewable energy
sources, including cellulosic ethanol,
biodiesel, methanol, butanol, and
hydrogen, plus unspecified “alternative
fuels.”
He said the other 5 percentage
points to be shaved off projected gasoline consumption would come from
changes to the corporate average fuel
economy (CAFE) program for new vehicles. His plan would give the secretary
of transportation authority to set CAFE
standards.

Under Bush’s SPR expansion, US
capacity to store crude oil as a buffer
against supply disruptions will reach
1.5 billion bbl by 2027. The SPR currently holds 691 million bbl of crude.
“For too long our nation has been
dependent on foreign oil,” the president said. “And this dependence leaves
us more vulnerable to hostile regimes
and to terrorists—who could cause
huge disruptions of oil shipments and
raise the price of oil and do great harm
to our economy.”

Industry reaction
Among industry responses to the
energy portions of Bush’s address, Mike
Linn, chairman of the Independent
Petroleum Association of America, said,
“Our best defense against foreign oil
dependency is the vast oil and natural
gas resources we have here in America.
This energy is our true strategic petroleum reserve, and government policies
should encourage its development.
Linn, who also is chairman, president, and chief executive of Linn
Energy, expressed regret that “the
majority of the nation’s oil and natural gas remains off-limits” and said,
“Any discussion of federal research and
development should also include new
technologies that help us recover more
American oil and natural gas.”
While the US “must embrace conservation, efficiency, and all forms of

American energy for the future,” he
said, “The fact remains that for the foreseeable future, oil and natural gas will
be our main fuel source.”
Charles T. Drevna, executive vicepresident of the National Petrochemical
& Refiners Association, also stressed the
continuing contributions of oil and gas
to US energy supply.
“US energy policy must continue
to encourage domestic production of
petroleum products and natural gas
supplies and the efficient usage of these
fuels while maintaining environmental progress,” Drevna said. “It is also
important that mandates, price controls,
and other punitive measures not be
adopted as energy policy.”
He said biofuels “are not a panacea
for America’s supply problems, nor can
they deliver on the much-touted promise of energy independence.” NPRA
doesn’t oppose ethanol or other alternative fuels, he said, “provided their use
is based upon market pricing and not
mandates and subsidies, which we do
not support.”
In a statement, the American Petroleum Institute said ethanol and other
biofuels “have an important role in our
nation’s present and future energy mix.”
It added, “Attaining the full volumes included in the administration’s proposal
will require additional technological
breakthroughs.” ✦

hen the 110th Congress begins
to examine the US Department of Interior’s proposed budget
for fiscal 2008 in a few weeks, it will
evaluate programs in DOI agencies. One apparent success is the US
Bureau of Land Management’s pilot
program to improve drilling permit
application processing and environmental enforcement.
Section 365 of the 2005 Energy
Policy Act (EPACT) directed the
interior secretary to establish “oil and
gas streamlining projects” at seven
BLM offices in Rawlins and Buffalo,
Wyo.; Miles City, Mont.; Farmington
and Carlsbad, NM; Grand JunctionGlenwood Springs, Colo., and Vernal,
Utah. The projects were established in
October 2005. BLM’s Colorado office
hosted two public listening sessions
on Nov. 14, 2006, to discuss the
effort’s first full year of operation.
Several people who testified said
the program is making a difference.
Marc W. Smith, executive director of
the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States in Denver,
noted that one of its purposes was
to coordinate activities by agencies
enforcing environmental regulations.
“When government agencies work
more efficiently, everyone wins,” he
observed.

other key federal agencies in October
2005 helped.”
Kesterke said about 125 employees
have come into the BLM offices from
many other federal agencies. One result has been to make an Army Corps
of Engineers specialist more readily
available to deal with Section 104
permits under the Clean Water Act, or
have a Fish and Wildlife Service employee on hand to deal with Section
7 clearances under the Endangered
Species Act.
Jim Stovall, associate field manager
in BLM’s Carlsbad, NM, office, said
such local coordination has been important. “Here, the Bureau of Reclamation is based out of Albuquerque,
5 hr away, as is the Fish and Wildlife
Service,” he pointed out.

Extends to states

Interagency cooperation has
extended to states, Kesterke said. Employees from Montana’s Department
of Environmental Quality and Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks are
working in BLM’s Miles City office.
“All the agencies have been trying
to identify ways to more effectively
permit oil and gas development and
monitor compliance after development occurs,” Kesterke said.
And the results? “Our average

Robust lease revenues
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Federal officials recognized the
possibility that increasing royalty rates
could reduce future initial deepwater
oil and gas bonus bids, a Department
of the Interior official told the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee Jan. 25.
“We try to determine what will be
attractive and produce the most revenue
for the US. The first is the bonus bid,
which produces immediate income.
The second is the royalty rate. If you
raise that, you probably will get less on
the bonus bid. That was what we were
looking at when the president decided
to increase the royalty rate to 162⁄3%,”
said C. Stephen Allred, deputy secretary
for land and minerals at DOI.
Nevertheless, the federal government
anticipates that it will receive significant
leasing income in coming years because
it expects oil and gas to account for the
bulk of US energy through 2030, he
said. “Much of the new energy growth
will have to be met from the Outer
Continental Shelf, especially new areas
in the Gulf of Mexico and areas off
Alaska,” Allred said.
His observations came as the committee examined potential US OCS oil
and gas development and issues surrounding it. Other witnesses included
Marjorie A. McKeithen, Louisiana Dept.
of Natural Resources assistant secretary
in charge of mineral resources; Lisa P.
Jackson, commissioner of New Jersey’s
Dept. of Environmental Protection; J.
Larry Nichols, chairman, president,
and chief executive of Devon Energy
Corp.; Paul K. Siegele, vice-president
of deepwater exploration and projects
for Chevron North America Exploration
& Production Co., and Athan Manuel,
director of lands protection programs at
the Sierra Club.

expected despite higher royalty rates
Estimated potential
Allred said that after DOI assessed potentially recoverable
quantities of oil and gas on the OCS as required under the
2005 Energy Policy Act (EPACT), it determined a mean level of
86 billion bbl of oil and 420 tcf of gas.
The estimates represent about 65% for oil and 40% for gas
within the total estimated US inventory of remaining economically recoverable oil and gas resources, he said. They do not
include areas in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska’s coast that
were opened for leasing in late 2006, Allred added.
“There is great uncertainty regarding the resource potential
in areas where leasing has been prohibited and where the last
geophysical surveys and drilling exploration occurred more
than 25 years ago. Using the information available to us, we
estimate that nearly 17.8 billion bbl of oil and 76.5 tcf of technically recoverable gas remain unavailable for leasing consideration,” he said.
Nichols said more-current resource estimates are needed to
make OCS policy decisions. “As more information is gained,
resource estimates can grow substantially. In the 1970s, the
original estimate of natural gas in [the central and western
Gulf of Mexico] was 50 tcf. We already have produced 150 tcf.”
Nichols said that if a hearing had been held 5-7 years ago,
people opposed to developing [deepwater] offshore resources
would have said there was no evidence of oil and gas resources
in these waters. “If you look at it today, however, we do have
drilling rigs that can work in 10,000 ft of water, seismic that
can determine if the resources are there, and wells that are
producing.”
Siegele said the deepwater gulf is critical to a diverse energy
portfolio because it can produce large volumes of oil and gas.
“However, it is a high-cost area that requires new technology
and major investments,” he noted.

Projects, costs
Siegele said Chevron Corp. is participating in three new offshore projects involving investments of more than $1 billion
each, but they are expected to yield about 300,000 b/d of oil
within the next 4 years. Two of these projects—Tahiti and Blind
Faith, which Chevron operates—represent more than $4.5
billion in capital outlays and are designed to produce 165,000
b/d. The third, the ultradeep Perdido regional development
project, is expected to be producing 130,000 b/d of oil near
the end of the decade.
“Deepwater exploration and production is risky, and success
cannot be guaranteed. Exploratory wells can cost $100 million
each and may result in dry holes,” Siegele said. “The process
of bringing new energy supplies to the marketplace—from
leasing through exploration, development, and construction—can take a decade or more. Companies invest billions of

dollars before there is any income from
production, and assume all this risk.
The Deepwater Royalty Relief Act was
successful. Production from the gulf
will dramatically increase in the next
decade,” he said.
McKeithen said Louisiana is looking
forward to royalty increases because the
state now will receive a share of federal
OCS leasing revenues to help it absorb
the impact. About 34% of the nation’s
total gas supply and almost 30% of its
crude oil supply is either produced in
or off Louisiana or moves through the
state, she pointed out.
“We believe oil and gas production and environmental protection can
coexist, but we know we can’t continue
doing it without learning some hard
lessons,” McKeithen told the committee.
“The good news is scientists know how
to restore our wetlands and protect our
barrier islands. What has been lacking
in the past hasn’t been the will, but the
resources. We have those resources now
and look forward to using them.”

Garden State goals
Jackson expressed a different view.
“Our coast helps drive our tourism
economy, which brings in more than
$36 billion/year.” She said $4.5 billion comes from commercial fishing
and aquaculture alone and that coastal
revenues represent the state’s largest
economic sector.
Instead of supporting offshore oil
and gas activity, Jackson said, the administration of New Jersey Gov. Jon S.
Corzine is proceeding with a commitment to have 22.5% of the electricity
consumed within the state come from
renewable resources and to reduce total
projected electricity demand by 20% by
2020 through conservation, improved
building standards, and alternatives.
Virginia officials have expressed
some interest in allowing offshore
oil and gas development, but Jackson
said: “I would prefer to avoid potential environmental impacts rather than
learn how to mitigate them.” She said
Virginia may seem distant from New

Jersey but its potential lease area is only
75 miles away.
Virginia has been included in the
5-year OCS plan currently being developed by MMS, and discussions are
continuing, but Allred noted that no
leasing would occur unless Congress
lifts a moratorium currently in place.

“As we look at the results, it’s amazing. All of the shut-in valves performed
as intended. There were no reports of
spills from them, although there were
spills that reached the ocean from onshore facilities,” Allred said.

Potential spills discussed

US House passes repeal of oil, gas incentives
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
US House members on Jan. 18
passed HR 6, which would repeal
selected oil and gas federal tax incentives, pressure holders of deepwater
leases issued without price thresholds
to renegotiate, and redirect revenues to
a new energy efficiency and alternatives
research and development fund.
The measure, which passed 264163, was the last of six bills designated
for consideration by House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during the first
100 hr of business in 2007.
Democrats called it an important

initial step in reordering national
energy priorities. Republican opponents said it would punish oil and gas
producers and refiners with additional
taxes and redirect revenues into a
vaguely structured slush fund (OGJ
Online, Jan. 15, 2007).
Opponents objected to the bill’s
coming to the floor under a closed
rule, which prevented amendments.
Chief Minority Leader John A. Boehner
(R-Ohio) protested with a motion to
adjourn, delaying proceedings for half
an hour while a vote was taken and the
motion was defeated. Minority Whip
Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said the bill does
not seriously address US energy issues.

Thirty-six Republicans voted for the
measure.
Rep. James P. McGovern (D-Mass.)
introduced the enabling resolution, saying oil companies received $7.3 billion
in tax breaks in the 2005 Energy Policy
Act. He called the breaks “kickbacks to
corporations like Big Oil.”
Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) countered, “[This bill] penalizes domestic
producers and does nothing to foreign
suppliers.”
Rep. Judy Biggert (R-Ill.) said she
would support HR 6 because she
wanted to see more money spent on
energy alternatives research, but she opposed the rule bringing it to the floor.
“We should know where this money is
going to go,” she said.
Rep. Steve Pearce (R-NM) questioned
the bill’s provision that would pressure
holders of federal deepwater leases issued in 1998-99 without price thresholds to renegotiate terms. He said the
bill could undermine the integrity of
government contracts.
Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall (D-W.Va.), who
introduced HR 6 with Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Charles B. Rangel
(D-NY) on Jan. 12, said deepwater
royalty relief was “a giveaway to oil
companies to do something they would
have done anyway.” He said the new bill
would not violate contract law because
the original Deepwater Royalty Relief
Act allows the government to impose
additional conditions.
Resources Committee Chief Minority
Member Don Young (R-Alas.) disagreed.
“This bill is a taking, and it will go to
court if it becomes law,” he said, adding
that he would have tried to amend it to
tax imports instead. ✦

Asian doubts
about Russia

A

deputy speaker of Russia’s upper
house of parliament last month
said his country is a guarantor of
energy stability and energy security
for Asia-Pacific countries.
“We should do everything possible to prevent any political speculation, misrepresentation, and distorted
scale of assessment of the actions of
Russia,” said Federation Council Dep.
Chairman Dmitry Mezentsev at the
15th session of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum.
Later, in presenting a report to the
session, Mezentsev said Russia would
build up its oil exports to Asian
countries within the next few years.
“After construction of the Eastern
Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline
is over, up to 30 million tonnes of
Russian oil will be supplied to the
Asian market per year and up to 80
million tonnes in the long term,” he
said.

If the Japanese thought they could
rely on Russia as a main energy

radically when the Russian government started pressuring the Sakhalin2 partners—two of them Japanese—
for a stake in the venture.

China’s main challenges in developing both bioethanol gasoline and

the government created tax incentives,

subsidies are being reduced as China
encourages a wider range of nongrain

fuel would be produced by biomass
materials, such as sugarcane, cassava,
and corn and wheat stalks.
Although both bioethanol fuel and
biodiesel in China can continue to
expect benefits from preferred governmental policies and loan approvals, such
incentives may not guarantee success
in meeting the official goals. Feedstock
crops require too much land and are
at odds with agriculture, and “some
projects may fail due to the competition
of capital, technologies, and product
quality,” Wang said. ✦

Most E&P companies have turned to
seismic surveys to map rock structure
in an attempt to select the optimum
position for a drill site, especially in
offshore exploration. Even with the use
of 3D data, dry holes frequently occur,
and the presence of hydrocarbons at
depth can only be proven by use of the
drill bit.
Much time and effort are spent on
seismic surveys over regions that have
little probability for oil and gas discovery. Placing seismic surveys above
future oil and gas field areas rather than
over barren areas saves large amounts
of exploration resources and is highly
desirable.
An airborne method exists for locating hydrocarbon reservoir areas that
does not depend on whether the reservoir is a structural or stratigraphic trap,
onshore or offshore.
The method is based on surface
detection of magnetic field effects that
result from anomalous increases in
magnetic properties of certain semishallow rock strata above the reservoir
area. The magnetic properties of these
strata beyond the reservoir area are not
altered.
Rapid advancement of an exploration
program is made possible by analysis of
airborne magnetic data. Results indicate
only the hydrocarbon reservoir area and
not depth to oil or gas.

If no MS anomaly results from accurate sample capture and subsequent

decision can be made to terminate the
drilling operation and select a new drill

In any new area, a sample library

shallow cuttings. Such cuttings MS measurements will provide (1) anomalous

Operators committed to drilling at least 35
new exploration wells
under successful bids in
Libya’s third round.
Libya has the largDrilling
est oil reserves in Africa
(39 billion bbl) and is
the eighth-largest oil producer among
the members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
Libya wants to increase oil production
to 2 million b/d by 2008-10 and to 3
million b/d by 2015, from 1.6 million
b/d today.
Since 1961, Libya has produced high
quality, low-sulfur, sweet crude oil, primarily sold into the European market.
The country is now the second-largest
oil supplier to Europe. Libya’s National
Oil Corp. (NOC) set up subsidiaries
with offices in Europe:
• Umm Al-Jawaby Oil Service Co.
Ltd. in London, 1983.
• Mediterranean Oil Services GMBH
in Düsseldorf, 1988.
Since the US lifted economic sanctions against Libya in 2004, NOC
has reinstituted lease sales, which
are again attracting the attention of
many international players as well
as national oil companies looking to
diversify assets abroad.

O D U C T I O N

A single mobile offshore rig, the
Pride North Sea, a second-generation
semisub, was drilling off Libya but
moved west, to Tunisia to drill for British Gas Tunisia Ltd., the largest producer
of gas in Tunisia. The Pride Venezuela, a
third-generation semisub, had previously drilled off Libya for Eni SPA.
There are three noncompetitive
platform rigs busy with workovers in
Libya’s offshore
Bouri field, all managed by KCA Deutag
and owned by Agip:
Bouri DP-3, DP-4A,
and DP-4B.

Operators plan more drilling
after third Libyan bid round

EPSA IV
Libya’s National Oil Corp. recently
announced results of the third bid
round in the country’s EPSA 4 (exploration and production-sharing agreement) program.
Unlike the EPSA 3 program, which
required negotiations with the Libyan
government, EPSA 4 is based only on
competitive bidding.

Rig counts
From 1982 to mid 1986, there
were 18-34 land rigs and as many
as 2 offshore rigs drilling in Libya
(Fig. 1). Drilling began to tail off in
the mid-1980s, and rig counts have
hovered between 10-15 over the last
20 years. The majority of the drilling has focused on oil, rather than on
natural gas.
According to Baker Hughes International rotary rig count, there were
12 land rigs drilling in Libya in December 2006, up from 11 in November 2006 and 9 in December 2005.
The BHI count is a snapshot that
includes only rigs actually drilling
(“turning to the right”) as opposed
to the total number of rigs on site and
under contract.

Various international service companies have used some of their newest
technologies in Libyan fields.
Weatherford Libya Ltd. successfully
used its MetalSkin solid expandable
system to isolate a casing leak on a producing oil well in Messla, Libya. It successfully ran a noncemented cased hole
liner without losing internal diameter.
According to Weatherford’s Hani
Qutobl and Anass Al-Chalabi, the company has also provided underbalanced
reservoir drilling and controlled pressure air drilling services in Libya.
Weatherford’s completion and production services group has a long-term
supply and service agreement with
Compagnie des Petroles Total Libye
(CPTL) for electric submersible pump
(ESP) installations.
Weatherford also set an extendedreach setting depth record to 15,569
ft offshore Libya using the Revolution
rotary steerable system for CPTL.
In April 2006, BJ Tubular Services Co.
announced its first contract to work in
Libya providing services on a number
of offshore wells for CPTL. BJ is providing hammer conductor-driving services
and conductor cold-cutting services on
the BD1 platform in Al Jurf field. BJ is
using Zone 1 cold-cutting equipment
and its S90 Hydrohammer hydraulic
pile driving system to drive conductors.

Discoveries
Germany’s RWE Dea AG is committed to drilling at least 10 exploration
wells on 6 license areas, following an
extensive seismic acquisition program.
The company discovered 35° gravity
oil in its first well, the A1-NC-193, it
announced in late October 2006. RWE
used the Adwoc Rig 2 to drill the 4,214

ft well in the Sirte basin, about 500 km
southeast of Tripoli (OGJ, Nov. 6, 2006,
p. 8).
Total has been active in Libya since
the 1950s, operating the offshore Al
Jurf field and Mabruk field in the Sirte
basin. Totla also has a working interest
in the consortium operating El Sharara
field in the Murzuq basin. In July 2006,
Total announced a new discovery at the
D1 well in Area NC 191 of the southern
Murzuq basin, about 800 km south of
Tripoli.
In late December 2006, Verenex announced that it had completed drilling
its first Libyan well, under a three-well
commitment for the Contract Area 47
license. The A1-47/02 well reached TD
at 11,550 ft and showed oil and gas in
the Lower Acacus formation (9,01010,062 ft) and Memountiat formation
(near TD). Completion and production
testing began in January.

Going forward
We can expect to see new contracts
for seismic acquisition in Libya, data
processing, and new drilling required
under the 5-year EPSA 4 licenses issued
in bid rounds 1, 2, and 3. Round 4 will
be announced in February or March
2007.
Meanwhile, operators continue
work in older fields they have recently
regained. ConocoPhillips plans ongoing
development of its Waha concession.
Statoil inaugurated its office in Tripoli
on Dec. 11, 2006.
Peter Mellbye, executive vice-president for Statoil’s international exploration and production business area, said
in 2006, “The Libyan government’s approval of our contracts [Dec. 10, 2005]
represented a milestone. This marked
the start of Statoil’s operatorship of a
5-year exploration program in two
licenses. The goal is to discover oil and
gas resources which can form the basis
for a long-term presence in Libya.” ✦

Gulf Oil Co. operates the

For drilling most of the
wells, the company used
rigs with a limited 19-24
ft substructure height. The
work required a 4-ft cellar,
dug prior to spudding the
wells, to accommodate the
blowout preventer stack.

The cellar houses Section

The 133⁄8-in. surface casing, cemented to surface,
serves as pile anchor to support the landing weights of
subsequent casing and liner
strings. Because of insufficient cement slurry volume, slurry channeling, or
cement deterioration over
time, the casing can become

• Horizontal movement

subsidence was 2 ft and would
increase if not stopped.
These wells produce with

After calculating ABP, one needs to
determine the optimum shape (circular,
rectangular, or square) of the baseplate (Fig. 2). The available surface area
around Section A allows for an annular
shape circumscribing the surface casing.

the wing plates are welded to Section
A, while the other side is welded on the
top side of the baseplate (Fig. 4).
The welding procedure of the wing
plates should be such that it prevents
damage from excessive localized heating to Section A and its internal parts,
such as the casing hanger. ✦

Baseplate installation
Installation of the baseplate involves
digging around the wellhead down
to just below Section A (Fig. 3). The
excavation needs to expose the surface
casing and the ground around it so that
the soil just below Section A can be
carefully leveled and compacted.
After determining ABP, one can start
preparing the plate with an inside cut
slightly larger than the casing (OD +
1 in.) before cutting it into two equal
halves, with a bevel for welding. The
plate then can be installed around the
wellhead, just below Section A.
Welding the two halves together
again forms one solid plate. The welding beads should be sufficiently thick
and applied carefully so that the plate
will not bend upwards during the
welding. This plate must remain floating
relative to the surface casing.
Six support wings welded to Section
A allow for load transfer. One side of

The absence of hurricanes during
third-quarter 2006 created problems
for US olefin producers in the fourth
quarter. These problems, however, were
minor compared with problems caused
by the fires and hurricanes during
third-quarter 2005.
After the disruptions to plant operations and loss of supply in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in
2005, many
petrochemical company
buyers decided
to be better
prepared for
the expected
instant replay
during the 2006 hurricane season.
Many olefins producers reported that
customers were prebuying and accumulating inventory during the second and
third-quarter 2006 to ensure adequate
supplies to offset expected supply disruptions due to hurricanes.
The 2006 hurricane season, however,
proved to be nearly nonexistent and the
Gulf of Mexico saw no hurricanes at
all. For those petrochemical buyers that
stockpiled in anticipation of hurricanes,
accumulated surplus inventories had
to be liquidated. The absence of any
hurricane-related disruptions, therefore,
resulted in a slump in demand during
fourth-quarter 2006.
The olefin industry, however, was
buffeted by the economic storm caused
by the refining industry’s abrupt
conversion from methyl tertiary butyl

ether to ethanol. During second and
third quarter, ethanol supply was tight,
some areas experienced ethanol supply
allocations, and octane values remained
extraordinarily strong through yearend
2006.
The sustained strength in octane
values directly affected spot prices for
propylene and aromatics. The strength
in propylene and aromatics prices, in
turn, influenced olefin plant feedslate
decisions.

Oleﬁn plant feed slates
Ethylene producers increased consumption of ethane and propane to
1.12 million b/d in May 2006. Feedstock demand for ethane and propane
in May proved to be the high for 2006.
When the value of octane rose and
coproduct prices strengthened, feedstock economics for naphthas and other
heavy feeds became more favorable after
May. Feedstock demand for ethane and
propane, therefore, in third-quarter
2006 declined 93,000 b/d and averaged 1.07 million b/d vs. 1.16 million
b/d in the second quarter. Demand for

ethane and propane declined again in
the fourth quarter, averaging 1.02 million b/d.
Table 1 shows recent trends in olefin
plants’ feed slates.
Ethane and propane accounted for
69% of the industry’s total consumption of fresh feed in second-quarter
2006 but accounted for only 62% in
third-quarter 2006 and 63% in fourthquarter 2006. Ethane’s share of fresh
feed declined to 42% in third-quarter
2006 but rebounded to about 46% in
the fourth quarter.
Propane’s share of fresh feed is usually at its highest level for the year dur-

ing third quarter but generally declines
in fourth quarter. In 2006, propane’s
share of fresh feed averaged 22% in second quarter and 20% in third quarter.
Consistent with the historic seasonal
pattern, propane’s share of fresh feed
declined to 19% in fourth-quarter
2006.
Because the value of coproducts
increased and cracking economics for
naphthas improved, demand for naphthas and other heavy feeds rebounded
in third-quarter 2006. Consumption
of heavy feeds averaged 528,000 b/d
in third-quarter 2006 vs. 432,000 b/d
in second-quarter 2006. Even though

total demand for fresh feed declined in
fourth-quarter 2006, demand for heavy
feeds was nearly constant and averaged
523,000 b/d.
Olefin producers did not operate at
full capacity at any time in 2006. Total
demand for fresh feed was its highest
level during third-quarter 2006; consumption averaged 1.71 million b/d vs.
1.78 million b/d in first-quarter 2005
(the high quarter for 2005).
In response to demand weakness for
various olefin derivatives, total demand
for fresh feed declined in fourth-quarter
2006 and averaged only 1.61 million
b/d.

Ethylene plants will run at 90-92%
of available capacity during first-half
2007, and total demand for feedstocks
will increase to 1.65 million b/d during that period. Retail demand for
propane generally declines after January
and availability for US Gulf Coast feedstock market improves.
Similarly, refinery demand for
normal butane will fall sharply during
first quarter and will reach its seasonal
50

low during second quarter. Feedstock
demand for propane and normal butane
will increase during first-half 2007.
The outlook for ethane demand,
however, is somewhat more complicated. For the first time in several years,
ethane availability may likely constrain
feedstock demand during the first half
of 2007.

Finally, a turnaround in April and
May reduced available capacity by 1.9

Table 3 shows ethylene production
from plants in Texas and Louisiana.

US propylene production
Spot prices for chemical-grade propylene averaged 47¢/lb in second-quarter 2006 and 48¢/lb in third-quarter
2006. Spot prices for chemical-grade
propylene were 3.8¢/lb higher than in
first-quarter 2006. Despite the increase
of almost 4¢/lb in second quarter, propylene price relationships vs. unleaded
regular gasoline and alkylate weakened in second quarter but rebounded
sharply in third-quarter 2006.
Spot prices for aromatics (especially
benzene and xylenes) also increased in
second and third quarters. Total coproduct credits for light naphthas increased
5¢/lb in second-quarter 2006 and
2.3¢/lb in third quarter.
Increases in coproduct credits contributed to significant improvements
in economic incentives for propane
and light naphthas. Feedstock demand,
therefore, for propane and heavy feedstocks increased and coproduct propylene production from olefin plants
increased in second and third quarters.
52

Propylene from steam crackers
totaled 3.1 billion lb in second-quarter 2006 or 150 million lb more than
in first-quarter 2006. In third quarter,
coproduct propylene production totaled
3.5 billion lb or 377 million lb more
than in second-quarter 2006.
Table 4 shows trends in coproduct
propylene production from LPG and
multifeed plants.
In second-quarter 2006, propylene
production from olefin plants in Texas
was 2.28 billion lb (Table 5), and the
propylene-ethylene production ratio averaged 24.1% vs. 24.7% in first-quarter
2006. In third-quarter 2006, propylene
production from olefin plants in Texas
increased 380 million lb and totaled
2.66 billion lb. The propylene-ethylene
production ratio averaged 27% in thirdquarter 2006.
Propylene production in Louisiana
totaled 0.74 billion lb in both second
and third-quarter 2006. The propylene-ethylene production ratio averaged
21.2% in second quarter and 22.1% in
third quarter.
Fig. 3 shows trends in coproduct
propylene production from olefin
plants in Texas and Louisiana.

2006

Reﬁnery propylene supply
Merchant sales of refinery-grade
propylene usually increase in second
and third quarters due to seasonal
factors. Refineries generally operate at
full capacity after April. Additionally,
refineries typically operate FCC units in
maximum gasoline mode. By-product
propylene yields from FCC units are
therefore usually somewhat higher in
second and third quarters vs. the first
and fourth quarters.
Consistent with typical seasonal
trends, merchant sales of refinery-grade
propylene totaled 4.06 billion lb in
second-quarter 2006, or 307 million
lb more than in first-quarter 2006. In
third-quarter 2006, however, merchant
sales of refinery propylene totaled 4.07
billion lb (Table 6) or almost the same
as in second-quarter 2006.
In fourth-quarter 2006, refinery
merchant sales of propylene will be
1.40-1.45 billion lb/month and production will total 4.00-4.25 billion lb.

averaged only 12.2¢/lb vs. 14.4¢/lb in
first quarter.
Spot prices for ethylene staged a
strong rally during third quarter and
averaged 48.8¢/lb. Spot prices reached
a 2006 peak of 50.5¢/lb in September.
The rally in spot ethylene prices and
the decline in production costs pushed
profit margins to 23.1¢/lb in September
vs. 11.8¢/lb in July. For third-quarter
2006, profit margins averaged 18.3¢/lb.
Although delayed by 2 months, spot
prices for ethylene succumbed to the
general decline in spot prices for petroleum products. The end was abrupt
and brutal and spot prices in October
fell to a low of 32¢/lb at month’s end.
For fourth-quarter 2006, spot prices for
ethylene averaged 34.4¢/lb or 14.4¢/lb
lower than the average for third-quarter
2006.
Profit margins based on spot prices
and total cash costs collapsed in fourth
quarter and averaged only 8.5¢/lb or almost 10¢/lb lower than in third quarter.
Figs. 6 and 7 show historic trends in
ethylene prices and profit margins.

Propylene economics, prices
Prices for all grades of propylene
move in tandem with each other, and
54

differentials between grades are generally constant within a narrow range. The
premium for polymer-grade propylene
covers operating costs and profit margins for various merchant propane-propylene splitters in Texas and Louisiana.
During third-quarter 2006, spot
prices for refinery-grade propylene
prices increased to a high of 48¢/lb in
August but weakened slightly in September and averaged about 47.75¢/lb.
Spot prices for refinery-grade propylene
moved higher even though spot prices
for unleaded regular gasoline fell by
26¢/gal in August and an additional
45¢/gal in September. Similarly, spot
prices for alkylate declined by 108.5¢/
gal or about 18¢/lb during third quarter.
The strength in spot prices for refinery-grade propylene was even more
surprising given the increase in total
propylene production during third
quarter.
Spot prices for refinery-grade propylene finally succumbed to bearish
economic and supply prices during
October and November. After contract
prices for refinery-grade propylene
settled at 45.5¢/lb, spot prices fell
abruptly and averaged about 36¢/lb or

almost 12¢/lb lower than in September.
Spot prices continued to decline in November and averaged about 33.5¢/lb.
Contract prices followed suit and
settled at 34.5¢/lb in November or
9¢/lb lower than in October. The market for refinery-grade propylene found
a temporary equilibrium in December.
Contract prices settled at 35¢/lb and
spot prices averaged 34.5¢/lb.
Polymer-grade propylene prices usually command a premium of 4-5¢/lb vs.
refinery-grade propylene. During third
quarter, the premium for polymergrade propylene (contract-price basis)
was 5.5¢/lb in July, narrowed to 4.0¢/
lb in August, and recovered to 4.75¢/lb
in September. For third quarter, the contract-price premium for polymer-grade
propylene averaged 4.75¢/lb.
In October, the contract price for
polymer-grade propylene declined
4¢/lb vs. a decline of only 3.25¢/lb for
refinery-grade propylene; the polymergrade premium narrowed to 4.0¢/lb.
Merchant splitters recouped the loss in
November when the contract premium
for polymer-grade propylene widened
to 6.0¢/lb. In December, the premium
narrowed slightly to 5.0¢/lb and averaged 5.2¢/lb for fourth-quarter 2006.

Octane values
We determine octane’s incremental
value using the differential between unleaded premium and unleaded regular
gasoline prices divided by the difference in octane (87 octane for unleaded
regular gasoline and 93 octane for
unleaded premium gasoline).
During second quarter, incremental
octane values increased to 3.2¢/octanegal in June vs. 1.3¢/octane-gal in April.
The rally in octane values continued
into third-quarter 2006 and peaked in
August at 4.3¢/octane-gal (about four
times greater than the historic average).
In September, however, incremental
octane values dipped to 2.6¢/octanegal. Octane values were nearly constant
in October but rebounded to 3.2¢/octane-gal in November and December.
We can evaluate the relative strength
in refinery-grade propylene prices by
tracking differentials vs. US Gulf Coast
spot prices for unleaded regular gasoline, spot prices for unleaded regular
gasoline in the Chicago pipeline market,
and by comparison with Gulf Coast
spot alkylate prices.
Fig. 8 shows trends in spot prices for
refinery-grade propylene and alkylate.
During second-quarter 2006, price
premiums for refinery-grade propylene
vs. spot alkylate weakened significantly
and averaged 2.6¢/lb. Premiums ranged
from a low of 0.3¢/lb in April to 5.3¢/
lb in May.
Differentials between refinery-grade
propylene and alkylate were dramatically more volatile during third quarter. Alkylate prices reached a high of
about 47¢/lb in July but refinery-grade
propylene prices dipped to 43.3¢/lb;
therefore, spot prices for refinery-grade
propylene averaged 3.8¢/lb less than
alkylate in July.
By September, alkylate prices fell to
29.5¢/lb but refinery-grade propylene prices rallied to 47.8¢/lb and the
premium surged to 18.3¢/lb. For third
quarter, refinery-grade propylene premiums averaged 7.7¢/lb.

Outlook

lion bbl during third-quarter 2006 and
2-4 million bbl during fourth quarter.
Crude inventories totaled 320 million
bbl at yearend and were about the same
as year-earlier volumes.
Unless crude producers in the
Middle East experience a substantial
supply disruption or voluntarily reduce
production by 1 million b/d and
maintain strict discipline on voluntary
production cuts, continued growth
in crude production from non-OPEC
sources will increase bearish pressures

on prices throughout 2007.
Octane values, however, will average 2.25-2.50¢/octane-gal during
first-half 2007 vs. 2.95¢/octane-gal in
fourth-quarter 2006. In summary, price
forecasts for ethylene, propylene, and
ethylene feedstocks are based on spot
prices for West Texas Intermediate crude
in the range of $58-62/bbl during
first-quarter 2007 and $55-58/bbl in
second-quarter 2007.
The projected decline in WTI prices
during second-quarter 2007 will de-

Completion of China’s
West-East Pipeline Project
(WEPP) and its successful operation during the
past 2 years has provided
Pipelines
valuable experience that
China is applying to future natural gas pipelines as the country
strives to use more gas in the future.
WEPP is modern China’s secondlargest infrastructure project after the
Three Gorges Dam. It began operations
in January 2005, moving natural gas
from the Tarim basin in the Xinjiang
Autonomous Region of far western
China to the eastern China cities of
Zhengzhou and Nanjing, with the
mainline terminating in Shanghai and
lateral pipelines terminating in Hangzhou, Wuhu, and Hefei (OGJ, Mar. 17,
2003, p. 68).

Complicated conditions

Planners redirected the pipeline to avoid
damaging natural reserves and places of
historical importance. According to the
regional Xinjiang Environmental Protection Bureau, the project added 150
million yuan ($18 million) to its cost
to take a camel-friendly route through
northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

Pipeline

China applies WEPP lessons
as natural gas demand grows

Encouraged
by the WEPP,
and to satisfy
rising demand
for natural gas,
China has built
or plans to build more gas pipelines,
including:
• A second Shaanxi-to-Beijing line.
• A 900-km bridge pipeline from
Beijing to Shandong province.
• East China Sea Xihu Gas Field Consortium transmission lines.
China National Petroleum Corp.
(CNPC) also plans to invest 4.3 billion
yuan to boost capacity of the WEPP
itself to 17 billion cu m/year from 12
billion cu m/year. The capacity-boosting project will raise the number of
pumping stations along the line to 22
from 10.
Bigger than any of these projects,
however, China plans to build the
second west-east pipeline by 2010.
The draft of Guidelines for the “Eleventh Five-Year Development Plan for
National Economic and Social Devel-

The WEPP crosses topographical
features that created construction difficulties.
• Crossings of the three largest rivers
in China (Yellow, Yangtze, and Huai),
including a more than 7-km crossing of
the Yellow River in Zhengzhou.
• Tunnels through three mountains.
• Crossing of the vast loess plateau
in central China. Loess soils are extremely complex, exist in just a few
areas of the world, and are easily eroded
once disturbed.
• Crossing of wetlands in eastern
China (OGJ, July 21, 2003, p. 58).
Work in the wetlands had to balance the
pipe’s tendency to
float in some areas C HUANHU PIPELINE SCHEMATIC

and government
officials were also

opment (2006-2010)” submitted for
examination and approval by the ongoing fourth session of the 10th National
People’s Congress (NPC) included a
proposal for the second WEPP.
The NPC is still researching the
project’s feasibility, with no timetable
yet set for its construction. The fate,
timing, and route of a second WEPP
depend directly on supply and demand
in China’s natural gas market. But an
official with CNPC said that the second
pipeline would have a larger diameter
than the first west-east pipeline and will
cost much more than the 46 billion
yuan spent on the first one.

The network
China’s natural gas pipeline network
delivers from three separate resources.
Development during the next 20 years
will continue to focus on these resources.
• Domestic inland gas. With China’s
major inland gas fields located in the
western part of the country, most do58

mestic gas flows from west to east. Gas
arteries following this path include the
WEPP, the Shaanxi-Beijing pipeline, and
the Zhongwu line, with the Chuanhu
line planned to pipe gas out of Sichuan
province.
Zhongwu has one 711-mm OD
trunkline from Zhong county, Chongqing municipality to Wuhan city, Hubei
province. Three branch lines run from
Jingzhou to Xiangfan (406.4-mm OD),
Qianjiang to Xiangtan (610 and 508mm), and Wuhan to Huangshi (323.9mm). The total system extends 1,347.3
km, 718.9 km of which is trunkline,
and has a design capacity of 3 billion cu
m/year.
Authorities are still considering the
Chuanhu project (Fig. 1). As proposed, it would include one 1,674-km
trunkline from Pugang, Sichuan, to
Shanghai (1,016-mm OD from Pugang
to Xuancheng, Anhui; 864 mm from
Xuancheng to Shanghai), one 842-km
sub-trunkline from Yichang, Hubei, to
Poyang, Henan (813 mm from Yichang

to Xinzheng, Henan; 711 mm from
Xinzheng to Poyang), and three branch
lines: 154 km from Liangping to
Changshou, Chongqing (559-mm OD),
45 km from Tiansheng pumping station to Dazhou station, Sichuan (323.9
mm), and 148 km from Xuanchang to
Nanjing (813 mm).
• Imported gas. China’s planners are
also considering several cross-border
pipelines from Russia and Central Asian
nations Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and
Uzbekistan (Fig. 2).
Gas from Russia will be transported
along two routes, a west pipeline will
enter China’s Xinjiang through Siberia
and Altai, before connecting with the
WEPP to bring natural gas to China’s
coastal areas. An east pipeline, yet to
be confirmed, might transport natural
gas from the Kovykta or Sakhalin and
Chayandinskoye gas fields located in
Yakut.
Gas pipelines from Central Asia will
join the WEPP directly.
The furthest advanced of these is the

proposed Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline, which would traverse nearly 4,400
miles of Kazakh territory before reaching the border with China. Mussabek
Issayevich Issayev, managing director of
KazMunaiGaz for Kazakh gas projects,
disclosed recently that the first phase of
the proposed pipeline would enter service in 2009 at an initial rate of 10 billion cu m/year. The second phase, slated
to become operational in 2012, will
boost capacity 30 billion cu m/year.
• Domestic offshore gas. China plans
to develop a coastal pipeline network to
transport gas from offshore gas fields in
the East China Sea and the South China
Sea.
Although a full picture of this
network has yet to emerge, some sections are already under construction. In
late October 2006 work started on an
813-mm OD gas pipeline crossing the
Qiantang River near Hangzhou. This
pipeline, including a 2,450-m riverbed crossing, will be part of the coastal
pipeline network. ✦

Separator designed for reﬁnery waste water treatment
Enviro Voraxial Technology Inc., Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., has delivered a Voraxial
2000 separator to Resource Environmental
Group Services LLC (REGS), Commerce
City, Colo., for use in refinery waste water
stream treatment.
One of the initial applications REGS will
focus on with the Voraxial is to improve
waste water systems, specifically ahead of
API separators. REGS is working with a
refinery customer and several engineering
firms to develop a water treatment system
built around the Voraxial separator.
The continuous flow separator simultaneously separates liquid/liquid, liquid/
solid, or liquid/liquid/solid mixtures at
high flow rates while achieving high levels
of purity, the company says. The separator
produces a real-time, high “g” centrifugal

Heavy-duty bull ring rotating mandrel
Here’s a rotating mandrel with a selection of interchangeable bull rings from
5 in. to 54 in. in diameter. The company
says its centering device is engineered to
handle the turning, threading, and grinding of thick-walled downhole/throughhole shafts used in the energy industry.
The product is available live for conventional tail stocks, and also in a dead center
configuration for live tail stocks. The rings
can be changed out without removing the
mandrel from the tail stock. Extra heavy
duty bearings and robust spindle design

A new arc welding safety CD (MC06209), yours free for the asking, features
industry and product news, including
the new US Occupational Safety & Health
Administration hexavalent chromium standards and OSHA’s small entity compliance
for hexavalent chromium standard. Visit
www.lincolnelectric.com for the CD.
The new standard lowers OSHA’s permissible exposure limit (PEL) for hexavalent chromium, and for all Cr(VI) compounds, to 5 µg of Cr(VI) per cubic meter
of air as an 8-hr time-weighted average.
The new standard requires industries to
control worker exposures to Cr(VI) so the
new PEL is not exceeded.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Identical forces
move prices of
oil and oranges
The price of oranges is about to triple in
the US, and nobody’s complaining.
After all, complaining can’t change anything. Freezing weather in California and
other citrus-growing areas has damaged
winter crops. Shortage looms.
According to a marketer of Californian
citrus products quoted in the Houston
Chronicle, an orange that recently cost 50¢
soon may cost $1.49.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

There will be no howls about “pricegouging,” however. Congress will summon
no citrus growers to accusatory hearings.
Newspapers will not write stories about
some past conversion of orange-producing
land to other use and call it price manipulation.
Americans reserve their vicious suspicion for oil.
They threw a ﬁt when gasoline prices
jumped after the twin Gulf Coast hurricanes
of summer 2005 idled 30% of US reﬁning
capacity.
Seldom is petroleum shortage as visible
as it was when reﬁneries were under water,
producing platforms were listing, drilling
units were adrift, and marine pipelines
were dislocated.
Seldom is the reason for prices of crude
oil, gas, and petroleum products to rise
as evident as it was then. Yet Americans
thought they were being gypped.
The oil price spurt of late 2005 and early
2006 was as much a product of cataclysmic
weather as the leap of orange prices will
be. Yet Americans will continue to believe
that some cabal of oil company executives
“gouged” them on gasoline prices. And
they’ll have nothing but well-justiﬁed sympathy for citrus growers.
The proﬁts oil companies reported after
the gasoline-price jump supposedly explain
American pique. Why? Margins rise for any
commodity in short supply, lifting proﬁts of
producers able to sustain output.
Margins will rise for crops not destroyed
by the recent US freeze, as will proﬁts for
growers in warmer areas. That’s no scandal.
It’s an incentive to keep oranges moving to
market. Similarly, oil margins elevated after
the hurricanes attracted foreign products
to the US and kept a treacherous supply
disruption from becoming disaster.
The orange-oil analogy can be carried
too far. But prices of the commodities rise
and fall for identical reasons: supply and
demand. It’s way past time for Americans to
understand that.

US gas production, Canadian exports fall
Supply and demand balance reports issued by Bentek Energy LLC, an energy analyst
based in Golden, Colo., have indicated in recent weeks a signiﬁcant drop in North American natural gas production.
“Total US production declined 5% in a 1-week period, from 51 bcf on Jan. 10 to only
48.3 bcf on Jan. 17. This is the lowest production level indicated by our pipeline ﬂow
database since October 2005 when the gulf region was still recovering from [Hurricanes]
Katrina and Rita,” Bentek Energy reported Jan. 25.
“In the past week, production has recovered back to about 49 bcf as of Jan. 25. However, this level remains 2.6 bcf below the average production rate in January 2006.”
Meanwhile, analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc. (FBR), Arlington, Va., said
in a separate report that Canadian gas exports to the US are expected to decline by 4%, or
400 MMcfd in 2007, following a similar drop in 2006. “We expect exports to decline...as a
result of reduced drilling outlook for 2007 and increasing oil sands consumption as existing projects ramp back up and new projects come on line,” said FBR researchers.
The weather factor
Based on its canvass of various market participants, Bentek said weather was one of
the factors contributing to the current steep decline in US production. Although media
coverage has been unusually muted, Bentek analysts said individual operators reported
sizeable shut-ins of gas wells because of sustained freezing temperatures, particularly in
the Rockies region. “Unusually large snowfalls have disrupted operations. In addition,
there is an expected dip in production that occurs about this time each year due to environmental constraints on producing activities,” said Bentek analysts. “The Gulf [of Mexico]
region started to decline a few days before cold weather set in due to maintenance and
operational curtailments on several pipeline systems.”
The result is “a double-whammy” for the natural gas supply-demand balance: a
huge increase in demand combined with a signiﬁcant decrease in supply. “Since winter
weather ﬁnally appeared 2 weeks ago, 352 bcf has been withdrawn from storage. The
recent storage withdrawals have resulted in an abrupt shift in market expectations for
end-of-season storage inventories. In early January, most market participants expected a
large storage overhang to depress prices in the spring. The large storage withdrawals over
the past 2 weeks have eased that expectation,” analysts said. Bentek’s latest weekly market
study projected another large withdrawal—195 bcf—for the week ended Jan. 26.
Canadian outlook
Canadian drilling and completion activity is expected to drop 10-15% in 2007 as a
result of higher drilling costs, lower crew productivity, lower and more volatile commodity
prices, and widening market differentials. “The drop in fourth quarter 2006 drilling activity
combined with less drilling activity outlook for 2007 will result in 2007 production declining by 300 MMcfd, according to our estimate. This compares [with] our previous estimate
of ﬂat production,” said FBR analysts.
“The key demand growth in 2007 will be increasing natural gas consumption in the
oil sands as existing projects ramp back up and new projects come on line. We estimate
that this will increase gas consumption by another 100 MMcfd, in line with our previous
estimate,” they said.
Canadian gas exports declined an estimated 400 MMcfd in 2006, with 100 MMcfd
accounted for by increased oil sands consumption. Canadian well completions totaled
15,362 in 2006 vs. 15,355 in 2005. However, gas completions dropped signiﬁcantly in the
fourth quarter, down 8% from the previous year’s level. “The decreased gas well completion activity was mostly due to fewer shallow gas wells being drilled. The fourth quarter
reduced completion activity will be felt in the next few months,” FBR analysts said.
Energy prices
Despite volatile trading with seesawing prices, the benchmark US crudes contract
climbed back above $55/bbl, jumping by $1.19 to $55.42/bbl Jan. 26 on the New York market, a 4% gain for the week as cold weather rallied heating oil demand in the Northeast.
The front month natural gas contract also climbed back above $7/MMbtu to $7.18/
MMbtu as temperatures dropped to 9º F. Jan. 26 in New York City, the lowest level in 2
years. Meanwhile, the FBR group forecast “a 10% decline in reﬁned product inventories
over the next 2 months.” Analysts said, “Strong gasoline and diesel demand in the ﬁrst
few weeks of 2007, coupled with reﬁnery maintenance and a negative Europe-US
East Coast arbitrage spread (limiting imports), indicate that inventories could fall
10% over the next 2 months.”

COVER
Europe’s first LNG export plant (cover) will begin operations by
December 2007 from Melkøya Island outside Hammerfest in
northern Norway. Gas for the plant flows from Snøhvit, Askeladd,
and Albatross fields, comprising the first hydrocarbon reserves to be
developed in the Norwegian part of the Barents Sea. A wealth of
information on worldwide LNG issues is available in this issue’s
special report that begins on p. 20 with an analysis of opportunities
and challenges defined by European regulatory and market factors
unique to each LNG terminal project’s location. A later article (p.
48) presents an overview of Snøhvit’s Hammerfest LNG plant, and
another introduces a new OGJ series that will track world LNG
netback prices. A final article (p. 62) provides a comprehensive look
at the current and future trends in LNG shipping. Cover photograph

Treasury asked to implement tax exemption
US Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson (R-Tex.) urged US Sec. of the
Treasury Henry M. Paulson to promptly implement a provision of
the 2005 Energy Policy Act (EPACT) allowing refiners to deduct
50% of plant expansion costs if such an expansion increases capacity by at least 5%.
Noting that US President George W. Bush signed EPACT into law
on Aug. 8, 2005, Hutchinson said some companies have not yet
received regulations from the Internal Revenue Service to implement the decision some 20 months later. “Companies are prepared
to invest billions in projects that take years to plan, engineer, and
design, but without this guidance, refineries are unable to determine future investments in additional capacity. The lack of a final
regulation for this provision is hampering company decisions to
proceed in expanding capacity to provide needed products to our
US market,” she wrote Paulson in an Apr. 2 letter.

lease two drilling platforms. Peregrino field, a shallow-water field
with reserves pegged at 300-600 million bbl, is Hydro’s first oil
and gas commitment in Brazil.
Hydro has submitted development plans for the field to Brazil’s
National Petroleum and Biofuels Agency. Plans include the drilling
of 30 horizontal wells and seven water-injection wells. The aim is
to produce 100,000 b/d of oil by 2010.
The company plans to expand in Brazil and will invest in three
Santos basin exploration blocks, in which it acquired working interest during the eighth ANP licensing round in November 2006.
Norsk Hydro is operator in one block and holds non-operating interest in the other two blocks, which are operated by Spain’s
Repsol-YPF SA and Brazil’s state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA. In
addition, Norsk Hydro will continue to look for farm-in opportunities.

UK project to assess CO2 storage in coal
Federal judge suspends forest management rules
A federal judge in San Francisco has ruled the US Forest Service
failed to conduct mandatory environmental impact reviews or take
public comment on plans by the Bush administration to change
rules governing forest land management.
US Northern District Judge Phyllis Hamilton ruled Mar. 30 that
the forest service’s new policies should be invalidated. Opponents
said the rule changes would expedite oil and gas exploration on
forest land while weakening wildlife protection and preventing
public comment regarding forest management.
The agency must conduct environmental reviews before implementing the “clear controversial” changes, she said.
The rules were changed in 2005 in what forest officials called a
move to streamline paperwork and respond faster to evolving forest conditions and scientific research. The rule changes invalidated
1982 federal forest agency rules.

Hydro, Anadarko to invest $2.5 billion in Brazil
Norway’s Norsk Hydro ASA and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. reported they will invest $2.5 billion to 2010 to develop Peregrino
heavy crude oil field on BM-C-7 block in the Campos basin off
Brazil. Hydro’s joint venture with Anadarko is 50-50.
The partners will lease a floating production, storage, and
offloading vessel from Norway’s AP Møller-Maersk. They will also

Composite Energy (CE), a Scottish company developing coalbed
methane production in the UK, commissioned a 2-year study to
evaluate carbon dioxide storage in coal. The £300,000 project is
being financed by BG Group, Scottish Power, and Royal Bank of
Scotland. It will focus on the potential of enhancing methane recovery through storing CO2 in coal. CE, which is in the process of
developing methane production from deep coal beds in Scotland,
will provide horizontal drilling expertise required for the long extended-reach boreholes required for the storage project.
CE believes CBM trapped in deep coal seams will provide an
untapped long-term source of UK gas.
Strathclyde University in Glasgow will assess the coal’s gas adsorption and desorption properties. Imperial College of London
will assess the coal’s mechanical properties to model and predict
the performance of a pilot scheme. The project will evaluate the
ability of CO2 to bond to coal. CE said the study will evaluate the
potential of CO2 storage in the interest of increasing methane recovery and also in reducing CO2 emissions.
“Coal can typically absorb five times more CO2 than the methane it releases,” CE said. “This may be a very real solution for reducing greenhouse gases.” The program will involve the direct injection of flue gas from the 2,400 Mw Longannet power station
into unminable coal seams in the central belt of Scotland. Scottish
Power owns and operates Longannet station. ✦

Processing
Shipments resume after French strike ends
The strike that crippled the ports of Fos and Lavéra since Mar.
14 ended when 62 tankers and LPG and chemical carriers waiting
outside the harbors began unloading operations Mar. 31.
The immediate deliveries have enabled Esso to return to almostnormal production at its Fos-sur-Mer refinery and Total at its La
Mède and Feyzin refineries, the refiners told OGJ Apr. 2. They had
slowed production last week by one third and would have gradually been forced to shut down had the strike continued.
The oil companies trade group Union Française des Industries
Pétrolières believed it would take at least 2 weeks for business to
return to normal. It is engaged in working out the full cost of the
strike to industry, so far estimated at €25 million.
The 18-day strike had seemed deadlocked by Gaz de France’s refusal to allow CGT port agents to handle branching and unbranching of the LNG carriers due to dock at its Fos-Cavaou LNG terminal
when it comes on stream at yearend.

Chinese agency okays petrochemical project
China’s National Development and Reform Commission
(NDRC) has granted permission to China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. (Sinopec) for the construction of an 800,000-tonne/year
ethylene plant and downstream petrochemical facilities in Wuhan,
Hebei Province (OGJ, July 10, 2006, Newsletter).
The NDRC, which regulates China’s industries and approves
projects, said capacities of the downstream plants will include
300,000 tpy of linear low density polyethylene, 300,000 tpy
of high-density polyethylene, and 400,000 tpy of polypropylene.
In 2005, China produced 7.55 million tonnes of ethylene. By
2010 the government plans to raise the country’s ethylene capacity
by 4.38 million tpy through expansion and upgrading of existing
plants and by a further 6.2 million tpy through the construction
of new facilities.
A Sinopec spokesman said Wuhan’s new petrochemical project

will be integrated with a 3 million-tpy refinery being expanded to
8 million tpy.

JV formed to expand Chinese reﬁning, retail
ExxonMobil Corp., Saudi Aramco, and Sinopec Mar. 30 announced two joint ventures aimed at expanding a Chinese petrochemical refinery and operating a chain of 750 retail outlets in
China’s Fujian Province.
The Fujian Refining & Ethylene JV Project and the Fujian Fuels
Marketing JV, valued at a total $5 billion in investment, represent
the first fully integrated refining, petrochemicals, and fuels marketing project with foreign participation in China.
The Fujian Refining JV, which will be headquartered in Quanzhou, will triple the existing refinery’s capacity to 240,000 b/d
from 80,000 b/d when it starts up in early 2009. The upgraded
refinery will primarily refine and process sour Arabian crude.
In addition, the project will cover construction of an 800,000
tonne/year ethylene steam cracker, an 800,000 tpy polyethylene
unit, a 400,000 tpy polypropylene unit, and an aromatics complex
to produce 700,000 tpy of paraxylene.
Support facilities including a 300,000-tonne crude berth and
power cogeneration also will be built.
The venture, to be called Fujian Refining & Petrochemical Co.
Ltd., will be owned by Fujian Petrochemical Co. Ltd. 50%, ExxonMobil China Petroleum & Petrochemical Co. Ltd. 25%, and Saudi
Aramco Sino Co. Ltd. 25%. The project is expected to start up in
early 2009.
The Fujian Fuels JV, formally registered as Sinopec SenMei (Fujian) Petroleum Co. Ltd., will manage and operate 750 retail outlets
and a network of terminals in Fujian Province under the ownership
of Sinopec 55%, ExxonMobil 22.5%, and Aramco 22.5%. ✦

Shell drops plans for Gulf Landing LNG terminal
Shell US Gas & Power LLC has decided to drop plans for its proposed gravity-based Gulf Landing LNG receiving and regasification
terminal off Louisiana.
“Shell has determined that the development of LNG regasification facilities currently under construction or planned in the Gulf
Coast region can meet regional LNG requirements,” Shell said in
an Apr. 1 statement to OGJ. “For this reason, Shell has discontinued
its plans to develop the Gulf Landing LNG terminal project,” the
company said.
Shell had gained approval of the US Maritime Administration
for its Gulf Landing LNG terminal in the Gulf of Mexico (OGJ, Aug.
15, 2005, Newsletter). The proposed Gulf Landing facility would
have had capacity to deliver 1 bcfd of natural gas to the US interstate pipeline network (OGJ Online, Nov. 14, 2003). Plans called

It’s important to remember that both
products must, by their natures, present
simplistic, highly positive messages.
Both, however, can be useful in the
right situations with the right audiences.
At the same time, other tools that
employ other media are available to
make LNG’s case. Worth noting is Oil &
Gas Journal’s highly accessible, technically accurate wall poster, published
in 2005, that depicts a typical North
American LNG terminal. A complementary narrative explains unloading and
regasification processes.
All these tools can combat the ignorance that breed the fear that leads to
poor energy policy decisions. Industry
should make use of them. ✦

SUSTAINABLE ENERGY—2

The energy system
Sustainable development, as was argued here
last week, has to represent more than mandatory
consumption of fuels containing no hydrocarbon.
Development depends on economics. Sustainable
development therefore must accommodate hydrocarbon fuels in some environmentally sensible
combination with others (OGJ, Apr. 2, 2007, p. 17).
Yet what’s sensible? Environmental goals derive
from politics and sometimes make no sense at all.
The framework for decision-making, however, can
be sensible, even sustainable, if consistently aligned
with markets. History is clear about this. Politics in
conflict with markets always fails.

tion has roared back into fashion. For Persian Gulf
producers, it never went out of style. Yet not so long
ago, some of them, including Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia, hinted at encouraging international companies to participate in oil production investments.
But times—and oil prices—change, and the talk has
subsided. Venezuela and Russia are renationalizing
their oil industries following years—decades in the
case of the Latin American producer—of reliance on
private capital. Both countries have raised taxes on
and expropriated assets of international companies.
Both use oil and gas to influence politics of international customers.

oping LNG facilities. The prospects for
individual projects will be shaped and
influenced by many factors, including
availability of supply, siting and permitting processes, gas-industry regulation,
and numerous market considerations,
including the need to manage multiple
users.
The importance of these factors varies among European markets. Gas-supply constraints, for example, are more
acute in the UK and Spain because pipeline networks are more limited there
than they are in Germany and Italy and
provide less access to gas supplies from
Norway and Northern Africa.

erations, permitting requirements, and
national regulations.
The contrast between Italy and
France, on the one hand, and Spain
on the other is most illustrative. While
LNG regasification projects in Spain are
driven mostly by supply constraints,
developments in Italy and France are
driven more by the desire to diversify
energy sources and encourage supply
competition.
Italy and France are relatively well
situated, with mature gas transmission
networks and good access to North
African, Russian, and Scandinavian gas

as it is in Italy and France or indeed
many other countries in continental
Europe. Spain has experienced harmful shortfalls in gas supply and storage
capacity in recent years, to such extent
that gas-fired power plants have been
idled for lack of fuel. As a result, supply
constraints are a major driver for development of new LNG capacity in Spain.
National regulatory policies affecting LNG stakeholders are likewise
influenced by these market drivers. For
example, Italian regulations require
20% of the LNG regasification capacity
at the existing Panigaglia terminal to be
set aside for third-party access (TPA).
However, the government has granted
exemptions from TPA obligations for
two new terminal projects in construction, at Rovigo and Brindisi.
Spanish regulators, on the other
hand, closely regulate LNG facilities in
the country, enforcing strict tariffs and
capacity-allocation protocols and requiring TPA for all LNG import capacity.
Specifically, 75% of terminal capacity

(more than 2 years), with 25% reserved
for shorter-term contracts.
Other European regions have reacted
to their own unique political and
market imperatives. While the UK gas
market is characterized by increasingly constrained supplies, the UK
enjoys large volumes of domestic gas
resources and expanding pipeline access
to European and Scandinavian supplies.
UK regulators apply a system of TPA
requirements, extending conditional
exemptions that allow 100% of new
terminal capacity to be subscribed with
long-term contracts but prohibiting
capacity hoarding and encouraging
interruptible and spot-market use of
facilities.5
Northern European markets present
yet another set of market conditions
and regulatory provisions. Northern
Europe represents a crossroads for gas
supplies, with major pipelines moving
22

North Sea gas southward and Russian
gas westward. Northern Europe also
features the continent’s only LNG hub,
the important gas hub at Zeebrugge in
Belgium.
For more than 20 years Tractebel
subsidiary Distrigas, under a contract
with Sonatrach, had full use of the
Zeebrugge facility to bring Algerian gas
into Northern Europe. But when the
Distrigas contract expired in late 2006,
Fluxys began operating the terminal
under a new tariff and TPA structure.
Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil are
now using Zeebrugge to import gas
from Qatar, and Distrigas this year will
begin importing LNG from RasGas II in
Qatar under a 20-year agreement.
To accommodate additional users,
Fluxys plans to double the capacity
of the Zeebrugge terminal and add
nitrogen-blending facilities to enable
regasified LNG to be sold in more European markets.

Third-party access
Despite variations in market drivers
and regulatory frameworks, the trade
policies of the European Union affect
all regions and countries in Europe.
For gas, they are embodied in the EU’s
Second Gas Directive, aimed at harmonizing regulation of European gas
industries and creating a competitive
wholesale gas market across European
state borders—while also encouraging
infrastructure investment.6
As energy-security tensions continue affecting Europe’s gas markets,
regulators likely will seek to ensure
maximum and open use of terminal and pipeline capacity. Indeed,
the European Commission itself has
promised to promulgate stronger
regulations as a result of shortcomings
identified in its recent inquiry into the
state of competition in European gas
and electricity markets.7

Spain’s terminals operate
under a similar regime.
Beginning this year, at
Belgium’s Zebrugge terminal, the capacity holder must
inform the terminal operator, Fluxys LNG, about any

2 months in advance of the

In Italy, if 20% of exempted capacity is unused

in the Italian gas sector may
hold more than a 20% stake

networks.
These requirements can affect operational logistics and costs as shippers
seek to maximize terminal usage, obtain
maximum market access, and avoid antihoarding penalties. To the degree LNG
terminals prevent third parties from
accessing spare capacity during times of
short supply, terminal capacity holders
could face investigations and potentially harsh sanctions from government
agencies. EU antitrust laws authorize
the European Commission to impose
large fines (up to 10% of global annual
turnover) and far-reaching structural
remedies against companies found to
violate EU antitrust rules.11

Multiuser challenges
As a result of TPA and antihoarding
policies, many European regasification
terminals will be used by multiple shippers—some operating under long-term
agreements and others carrying LNG
cargoes on a spot or short-term contract
basis. This reality will affect the commercial performance of many terminals.

are not addressed early in the development and contracting process.12
These issues include physical constraints such as the maximum capabilities of terminal berths, navigational
concerns such as tides and bridge clearances, and regulatory concerns such
as environmental limitations on vessel
transit.
In addition to these physical constraints, capacity holders and other
terminal users face contractual and operational issues that affect their ability
to use the facility. For example, bringing LNG to market requires access not
only to terminal berths and regasification capacity but also to other terminal
services and pipeline access. Users at
multiple-user terminals must consider
available aggregate storage capacity because at some terminals capacity is limited to only one LNG vessel at a time. As
a result, importers should ensure that
their terminal use agreements (TUAs)
appropriately define their access to the
services they will need.
However, the most critical issue arising at multiuser terminals is the need to
coordinate shipping schedules to synchronize vessel arrivals and unloading
windows. Delays and failures in coordination can expose importers to burdensome financial costs and penalties.
To avoid shipping conflicts, terminal
operators must impose a strict regime
that establishes firm unloading windows, while also providing flexibility to
accommodate uncertainties and assign
unused unloading windows. TUAs likewise should specify scheduling regimes
and contingencies to ensure that all importers understand their access rights,
performance obligations, and financial
risks.

age tanks. Capacity holders in Italy and
Spain can face penalties if they contract
for import capacity and then fail to supply expected volumes of gas. And in the
UK, the Office of the Gas and Electricity
Markets (Ofgem), the national energy
regulator, is considering implementing
a rule that would require LNG terminal operators to regularly publish LNG
storage data to help market participants
“reach more informed commercial
decisions and therefore facilitat[e] the
efficient operation of the [UK] gas
market.”13
Such obligations and penalties
represent additional potential costs and
can affect commercial arrangements
between LNG suppliers, project developers, and capacity holders. Moreover,
not all market participants are equally
suited to manage these factors.
In European markets LNG import capacity is held largely by gas and power

of participants. Oil and gas companies, whose profitability depends on
their ability to leverage their resource

electric and gas utilities, which can
more readily manage such obligations
and pass the costs along to ratepayers.
This dynamic may create an important commercial consideration for LNG
stakeholders—the need to effectively
disaggregate LNG suppliers from importers, marketers, and distributors. In
some cases LNG suppliers investing in
a terminal might allocate their capacity
to a different company—a gas importer
or national utility, which will accept
the LNG at the terminal entrance and
manage downstream obligations from
that point.

Siting and permitting
Just as market-access requirements
are driven by market conditions, regulatory approaches to facility siting and
permitting in Europe have evolved from
a combination of energy-security, competitive market, and environmental considerations. These approaches present
different challenges to project sponsors
in different countries, depending on the
efficiency of government bureaucracies
dedicated to these processes.

governments seek to encourage the
development of LNG terminals and
therefore provide relatively streamlined regulatory processes. Government
agencies often are directly involved in
selecting project sites and encouraging
development as part of national policies
focused on improving energy security.
Indeed, many of the companies
involved with LNG terminals are partly
or wholly government-owned, which
means governments have a direct stake
in project development.
This situation contrasts starkly with
that in the US, where federal and state
agencies play no role in selecting sites
or encouraging the development of
individual projects but only review
project applications for regulatory compliance purposes.
As a result, European permitting
processes tend to be less challenging
than US processes are. At the same time,
however, European policies are closely
focused on minimizing environmental
impacts, and project reviews are exhaustive and time-consuming. Also they
can be affected greatly by environmental advocacy movements. For example:
• The Brindisi project, being developed by BG in Italy, has been set
back by significant local opposition.
Court battles challenging the project’s
environmental permits have delayed
construction by months or years, added
more than €100 million to the total
cost, and caused BG’s development partner Enel SPA to drop out of the project.14 Most recently, criminal allegations
of bribes have brought construction to
a halt.15
• After international protests in July
2006 drew negative attention to two
LNG terminals being developed near
the Italian Adriatic port of Trieste, the
city council rejected the applications of
both projects on “environmental compatibility” grounds.16
• At the South Hook LNG project in
Wales, protestors repeatedly disrupted
construction in late 2006 and early
2007. In January, for example, 13 protestors broke into the site and chained

28

themselves together to a large pipe, requiring a brief construction delay while
police arrested the demonstrators.17
Coastal Europe’s relatively high
population density and sensitivity to
environmental issues exposes LNG projects to intense public scrutiny. Paying
careful attention to public sentiment
and conducting siting and permitting
processes in a transparent and forthcoming manner can help developers
avoid siting difficulties and the delays
and added costs that result.

US projects. However, LNG projects in
Europe are subject to careful scrutiny
for safety and security, and projects will
proceed only if their sponsors satisfy
national standards.

As more LNG terminals come online
and new pipeline infrastructure projects
are built in Europe, importers face an
increasing need to ensure that diverse

A refinery turnaround’s size and
complexity leaves little flexibility for
changing plans, even when market
conditions favor leaving the refinery
running, EIA continued. A major fluid
catalytic cracking turnaround might require increasing outside labor by more
than three times the labor force usually
present in the refinery, and long lead
times are needed for some materials
and equipment, it indicated.

Labor shortage
Another important factor is that
skilled labor for turnarounds is in
short supply, preventing refiners from
conducting simultaneous turnarounds,
EIA’s report said.
Citing a recent survey of operating
experiences for 28 FCC units by the
newsletter Octane Week, it said that
while 22 of the units targeted 4-5 years
between turnarounds, only 16 stayed
on that schedule. “Turnaround times
also tended to be longer than planned,
with the average slippage being 5 days.
Some companies indicated that in recent years, the slippages were the result
of a lack of skilled labor, creating the
need for longer outages,” EIA’s report
said.
Such planned maintenance normally
occurs during the first and fourth quarters of each year since this normally
is the time when product demand is
seasonably low and weather conditions
are favorable, it said.
“Unplanned outages can be very
disruptive since they allow for little, if
any, lead time to plan for the shutdown.
Some unplanned outages can be postponed for several weeks while material,
equipment, and labor are ordered. Others may require immediate shutdowns,”
the report continued.
Volumes lost from an unplanned
outage are usually less than from
planned turnarounds, but unplanned
outages can occur during high demand
periods when markets are more sensiOil & Gas Journal / Apr. 9, 2007

tive to lost barrels of product, it said.
In the California situation, which it
reviewed in an earlier report, EIA said
that one or more large outages occurred
during a peak demand period in an
area where alternative supplies were not
available, which significantly affected
prices.
Spring, when refiners are switching from winter to summer gasoline
grades, can be another vulnerable pe-

riod, it continued. Prices can be initially
depressed as suppliers draw down their
winter-grade gasoline—which cannot
be used during summer months—
while they produce and store their
summer-grade motor fuel. Prices then
increase seasonally as the summer-grade
gasoline season begins and demand
rises toward its summer peak.
If refineries are slow to ramp up
summer-grade gasoline production

because they are having difficulty coming back from turnarounds, extra price
pressure can occur, EIA said in its latest
report. “This was the case in the spring
of 2006, when a number of refineries
were still trying to recover from the
hurricanes in fall 2005. While gasoline
imports increased to offset some of
the refinery supply loss, the volumes
of affected capacity were unusual,” it
said. ✦

from two labor unions joined representatives of wildlife preservation groups
in saying hunting and fishing access and
quality are endangered. “It was an interesting alignment,” IPAMS Pres. Logan
Magruder observed.
Andrew Bremner, IPAMS’ government affairs director, pointed out
that the oil and gas industry is one
of the largest employers in the Rockies, accounting for more than 77,000
jobs with an average annual salary of
$51,022.
“Our industry provides billions
of dollars in taxes and royalties that
provide quality schools, equipment and

Supreme Court gives EPA authority to limit CO2 emissions
The US Supreme Court ruled Apr. 2
that the US Environmental Protection
Agency has the authority, under the
Clean Air Act, to enact limits on carbon
dioxide emissions.
The lawsuit was filed by Massachusetts along with several other states, US
cities, and environmental groups.
“Because greenhouse gases fit well
within the act’s capacious definition of
air pollutant, EPA has statutory authority to regulate emissions of such gases
from new motor vehicles,” Justice John
Paul Stevens wrote in the majority ruling. “The statutory question is whether
sufficient information exists to make an
endangerment finding. In short, EPA has
offered no reasoned explanation for its
refusal to decide whether greenhouse
gases cause or contribute to climate
change. Its action was therefore arbitrary, capricious,...or otherwise not in
accordance with law.”
The justices ruled five to four in
favor of the group led by Massachusetts
in reversing a court of appeals ruling.
Chief Justice John G. Roberts wrote a
dissenting opinion.
“Global warming may be a ‘crisis,’
even ‘the most pressing environmental
problem of our time,’” Roberts said.
“It is not a problem, however, that has
escaped the attention of policymakers
in the executive and legislative branches
of our government, who continue to
consider regulatory, legislative, and
treaty-based means of addressing global
climate change.”
Patrick Michaels, Cato Institute
senior fellow in environmental studies,
said, “The implications may be quite
staggering. The decision means that CO2
qualifies as a pollutant, something that
causes net harm. This surely will open
up a massive number of subsidiary
cases.” The Cato Institute is a think-tank
based in Washington, DC.
Michaels questions what levels of
CO2, if any, are to be allowed without
being considered to be pollutants.

“There is very little in our society
that does not have some relationship to
the production of CO2,” Michaels said.

“We have now entered the era where
the courts will enter into almost every
aspect of our lives.” ✦

Iran-US row
rattles pawns

T

hese days oil and gas are being
used like pawns in the game of
brinkmanship between the US and
Iran—a game that is hurting business. In this game, even the pawns
must hold a grudge.
Last week, oil prices slipped after
Iran’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that his country
would free 15 British naval personnel
it had captured in the Persian Gulf
more than a week before, pardoning
and releasing them as a pre-Easter
gift to Britain.
The “pardon” came as commodities trade was winding down for the
long Easter weekend, with exchanges
in London and New York preparing
to close for Good Friday.
In London, the reaction was swift:
By midafternoon on Apr. 4, West
Texas Intermediate for May delivery
on the New York Mercantile Exchange
was down 43¢ at $64.21/bbl, while
May Intercontinental Exchange Brent
crude was 31¢ lower at $67.52/bbl.

Wall Street drops
As one analyst noted, the capture
of British sailors by Iran had created
nervousness in oil markets—a point
underlined by the $5 surge in oil
prices on Mar. 27 after rumors that a
conflict had started between Iran and
the US.
When the rumors were shown to
be false, prices eased. But they still
moved higher over the rest of the
week as people everywhere—and
traders among them—kept their eyes
on the unfolding drama.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 index
dropped to 1,417.05 from 1,426.2.
The Iranians are an old trading

nation, and they know perfectly well
how markets react to any threat to
supply—especially any threat to the
supply of a commodity as important
as oil.
The Iranians’ seizure of the British
sailors and marines was carefully
planned. It was done with enough
time to rattle stock markets but also
timed to fit as neatly as possible into
the Christian holiday calendar.

Petrobras threatened
The Iranians lost no face by
promising to release the captives
before Easter. Indeed, they may even
have looked more humane—as they
hoped to look—by the gesture, an
especially strong one coming from a
Muslim nation on the approach of a
key Christian holiday.
So the Iranians were able to score
a hit. They showed the world how a
bit of saber-rattling can affect markets
up and down the supply chain, and
they got away with the gesture unscathed. Behind all this, of course, is
the Iranians’ desire to have their way
regarding the development of nuclear
power.
But the power struggle also works
the other way. Clifford Sobel, the US
ambassador in Brasília, reportedly
told Sérgio Gabrielli, president of
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras),
that the US was concerned over the
company’s increasing activities in
Iran.
According to the newspaper Valor
Econômico, Sobel said such activities might “create complications” for
Petrobras’s operations in the Gulf of
Mexico.

noncompliant facilities. It said it will
conduct site inspections and security
audits to validate submissions, and
provide technical assistance when it’s
needed.
Security standards will be designed
to meet specific protection goals. These
include securing each high-risk plant’s
perimeter and critical targets, controlling access, deterring theft of potentially dangerous chemicals, and preventing
sabotage, according to DHS.
DHS said affected facilities contacted
by the federal department will have 120
days from the regulations’ publication
in the Federal Register to provide information for the risk assessment process
and meet other requirements under the
new rule.
DHS said it prepared the regulations
following consultations with state and
local governments, Congress, plant
owners and operators, and the public to
develop consistent guidelines that use a
risk-based approach.
The new regulations preempt only
those state and local regulations that
conflict or interfere with the new federal rule. DHS said it currently has no
reason to believe that any existing state
laws are applied in a manner which will
impede the federal regulation.
It said that it met an aggressive timeline imposed by Congress in proposing
the interim final rule for comment and
then publishing it before Apr. 4. “The
safety and security measures we take
need to be tough and balanced. We will
significantly reduce vulnerability at
high-consequence chemical facilities,
taking into account significant efforts
in certain states,” DHS Sec. Michael
Chertoff said.
The National Petrochemical & Refiners Association said it was pleased that
the rule’s initial phase encompasses
a broad range of facilities possessing
chemicals in quantities that might present a high level of risk, and that it then
permits each covered facility to select
appropriate measures to meet the standards set by DHS. ✦

This is the second part of a two-part
article that lists world giant oil and
gas discoveries by decade and analyses
related trends.
Table 1 summarizes the decade-bydecade changes in oil and gas giant field
discoveries. A familiar pattern can be
seen of major increases that occurred
in the 1960s and 1970s, followed by a
dropoff in the last 2.6 decades (decade
2000 consists of a partial record from
year 2000 through year 2006).
Another trend shown in Tables 1 and
2 is that since the 1990s, giant field gas

discoveries.
The basic picture combines the oil
and gas giants and superimposes a second-order trend line (Fig. 2). The total
number of 938 giant fields includes
555 oil fields and 383 gas fields.
In Fig. 2, we predict the number of
giant discoveries in decade 2000 based
upon the record through year 2006.
Since Jan. 1, 2000, 72 giant fields have
been discovered. This averages to 10.28
discoveries/
year; therefore
the extrapolation to the end
of decade 2000
is 103 discoveries. If this prediction
holds up, the current decade will surpass the 100 discovery number for the
first time since decade 1970.

fold-thrust belt, in the mature Sichuan
basin of southwestern China. A structural-stratigraphic trap, which is closed
by lateral depositional change and dip
closure, defines the field.
After drilling four appraisal wells,
Sinopec assessed Puguang as one of
China’s largest gas fields, with estimated
reserves of 4 tcf of gas in the lowerTriassic Feixianguan limestone. The
rocks consist primarily of mudstones,
siltstone, and shale sequences above the
productive carbonate reef zone.
Following the four discovery and
appraisal wells, a first-phase development program was approved in 2005
to exploit the field. Sinopec now plans
to drill and complete 54 wells from 17
pads by 2009. By early 2007, about 10
wells had been drilled from seven pads.
Development of this field is considered
strategic to the development of the
country (Fig. 1).

by applying pressure inside the hole
and is likely to have a significant effect

above 3,600 m, well control cannot be
maintained. Concern for fracturing the
formations at the shoe preclude the feasibility of closing in the well (Fig. 6).
4. Lost circulation. In the upper formations of the Shaximiao, lost circulation was very common. Puguang wells
typically encountered lost circulation in
the 89-154 m interval, with total losses
of 224 cu m and average fluid losses of
1.3-8.0 cu m/hr. Adding lost-circulation material was the most common
response, limiting fluid loss.
5. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide
(CO2). The reservoir is highly sour (15%
H2S) and corrosive (8% CO2). Table
1 shows the gas composition in the
reservoir.
6. Water influx. During the candidateevaluation phase, the wellbore-stability
study concluded that water influx could
be a major issue in the Shaximiao series
between 1,500 and 2,000 m. Five additional zones above 1,500 m were also
predicted to be potential water-influx
zones.

Weatherford assesses MPD complexity through an analysis that determines
a risk-assessment value. The risk matrix
is designed to reduce operations engineering turnaround time and costs. It
provides a way to capture and disseminate global learnings, reduces client
learning curves, and provides a means
for technical education. The matrix also
provides a system for effective management change and identifying quality, health, safety, and environmental
(QHSE) hazards.

shale instability as a result of the waterwetting of the claystones.

Deviation control
Although hammer drilling is extremely effective at reducing deviation
because of the low weight on bit and
low speed, close attention to deviation
control is still required. This is especially important in pad drilling of multiple
wells to avoid collisions.

Project management
The remote location of this project presented another set of concerns.
QHSE issues regarding well control,
avian flu, close proximity of civilian
population and housing to the rig site,
accommodation, hygiene, and medical
care were all required close cooperation
between Sinopec and Weatherford.
Although all these concerns were
generally solved to mutual satisfaction, questions about rig-site decision
making and well-control philosophy
still remain. They are continually being
addressed and as confidence develops
on both sides, trust is beginning to
build. ✦

tanks (two for LNG, one for LPG and
one for condensate).
In view of the Arctic location and
limited regional infrastructure and
resources, a construction policy of
maximum prefabrication was adopted.
In particular it was decided that process
equipment and power-generation facilities would be assembled on a barge
that would be installed in a specially
prepared dry dock at Melkøya.
All major modules were built at sites
on mainland Europe, including the process plant at the Dragados yard in Spain.
Heerema in Holland and Fabricom in
Belgium were responsible for several of
the process and utility modules. Heerema also built the slug-catcher and MEG
regeneration units and Fabricom the
pipe racks and electricity substations.
Most of the modules were shipped
to Melkøya during 2005. Key deliveries
were a shipment containing two MEG
reclamation units and three electricity substations that arrived in February 2005, the cold-box assembly that
arrived the following May (Fig. 7), and
the process barge, which arrived on the
Dockwise heavy-lift vessel Blue Marlin
after an 11-day journey in July 2005.
The total weight of the barge, which
measures 154 x 54 m and supports
equipment structures up to 50 m high,
is 35,000 tonnes (topsides 25,000
tonnes, base 10,000 tonnes). On arrival
at Melkøya, it was floated off the heavylift vessel and, after a couple of days’
wait for suitable weather, winched into
the dock. Water was drained and the
barge concreted into place.
The cold-box assembly, which stands
60 m tall and weighs 2,625 tonnes, is
located alongside the barge.

Cost, schedule overruns
LNG deliveries had originally been
scheduled to start in October 2006, but
in September 2005 Statoil announced
that the schedule was to be extended
to December 2007 and the budget
increased. The budget, which covers
both LNG plant and offshore development, including future drilling phases,

taken place for some
of the modules. In
particular the weight
of the plant to be

become too great,
so that it had already

Another consequence of these
developments was
that it became impossible to perform

first system, the air-separation unit,
was commissioned. In the remaining
months of 2006, the other utility systems were commissioned and brought
into operation.
Important milestones were reached
in December 2006, first with the
change in the status of the Melkøya
plant from construction site to gas processing facility and, just before yearend,
with import of gas for commissioning.
This came as a 140,000-cu m cargo of
LNG delivered by Arctic Princess (Fig.
8), one of the carriers built to serve the
project.
The cargo was used to cool the storage tanks. In mid February, it was regasified for use as fuel gas to bring the
power-generation plant into operation,
generating about 100 Mw. Next follows
commissioning of the process plant,
starting with the cooling compressors.
The slug catcher, MEG-regeneration
system, and CO2 extraction system will
be commissioned and ready for operation ahead of first gas on May 1. In early
July, gas is to be fed into the process
plant, opening the way to the start-up
of this plant in the following months.
The first LNG shipments are to take
place during fourth quarter, ahead of
start of contractual deliveries on Dec. 1.

Operations
The knowledge acquired in developing and qualifying the MFC process and
SWHE will also be applied to optimize
operations of the Snøhvit plant. For the
first time in an LNG plant, a rigorous model of the main SWHE will be
used, incorporated in a comprehensive
dynamic simulator.
Special scientific instruments will
also be used to check performance of
the heat exchangers and validate tools
used in their original design. Instrumentation data will be combined with
simulations to optimize plant performance.
Another approach to optimization
is based on detailed SWHE models
that are used as modules in flow-sheet
programs, thus enabling parameters
such as flow rates, temperatures, pres-

sures, and refrigerant composition to be
fine-tuned in order to maximize LNG
production.
Control room operators will also use
a virtual model of the Snøhvit value
chain, from reservoir to LNG process, in
order to visualize operations and facilitate decision-making when deviations
from normal operational patterns occur.
The technology will be the first such
visualization tool in the world.
About 180 personnel will be involved in running operations, including
a small number responsible for controlling offshore facilities. There is an
operations organization of around 100,
including control room staff and various sets of crews for carrying out either
planned or unscheduled maintenance.
There is also an operations support
staff of around 70, including engineers,
laboratory staff and the harbor crew,
project personnel, management, and
administration.

Snøhvit LNG ﬂeet
Statoil, Petoro, Hess, and RWE-Dea
have sold their share of production,
about 70%, to Statoil North America
and the Spanish company Iberdrola.

Under these agreements, 1.8 million

Md., terminal on the US East Coast,
which is partly owned by Statoil, and
1.2 million tpy to Bilbao in northern
Spain. Gaz de France and Total will lift
their 1.3-million tpy shares separately.
LNG shipments numbering around
70 LNG/year will be made. Four
140,000-cu m newbuild LNG carriers,
two by Mitsubishi and one each by Kawasaki and Mitsui, will serve the Snøhvit trade. Three (Arctic Discoverer, Arctic

contracts; Statoil is a part-owner of all
three. The fourth, Arctic Lady, has been
jointly chartered by Gaz de France and
Total.

Future
The next step in the Snøhvit story
will be to add another processing train.
First, additional gas quantities must be
proven up, either in the Snøhvit field
or elsewhere in the region. Layout and
other technical studies have already

join the project for a second train when
they are demobilized.
Meanwhile the Statoil/Linde alliance,
which has been extended to 2008, has
been working to develop the LNG technology further. One main avenue has
been application of the MFC process to
high baseload projects, taking advantage
of the flexibility provided by use of different refrigerant mixes for each cycle.
Engineering studies have shown that
production of 9-12 million tpy from a
single train is achievable.
Work has also been carried out to
apply the technology to floating LNG
production. For this application, Aker
Kvaerner has joined the alliance, bringing its expertise in floating technology and project execution. Linde has
qualified the SWHE for use in a floating
environment. The possible use of CO2 as
a refrigerant has been studied.
The Linde SWHE has proven attractive to other LNG projects, and units
have been sold to a number of new
projects, including Shell’s Sakhalin

analysis1 suggests that the LNG import
requirement will be at the top end of
the ranges quoted with imports of 58
million tonnes forecast for 2010 and
118 million tonnes in 2020.
The US is not the only country or region, however, for which the LNG import outlook is strong. Europe imported
35 million tonnes of LNG in 2005; this
import requirement is forecast to grow
to 50-60 million tonnes in 2010 and
80-100 million tonnes in 2020. A similarly robust outlook exists for Asia-Pacific where imports are forecast to grow
to 105-125 million tonnes in 2010 and
140-180 million tonnes in 2020 from
91 million tonnes in 2005.
The outlook for the global LNG
market is therefore strong with total
demand forecast to grow to 200-245
million tonnes in 2010 and 300-400
million tonnes in 2020 from 140
million tonnes in 2005; the US will become the largest single market for LNG
sometime after 2010.
While the outlook for LNG imports into the US exhibits considerable
growth, actual imports during the last
couple of years have failed to match
expectations. Imports peaked in 2004
at slightly less than 14 million tonnes
but declined in 2005 to 13.3 million tonnes and shrank again in 2006
to 12.3 million tonnes. Current LNG
import terminal receiving and gas
send-out capacity is nearly 40 million
tonnes/year (tpy; equating to a capacity
of 3.3 million tonnes/month). It can be
seen that capacity utilization has been
low, in the range 30-40%, since 2003

Much of this volume has been sold
into Spain where a combination of
strong domestic demand growth and
low rainfall (more than 10% of Spain’s
electricity generation being from hydroelectric plants) has contributed to an
increasing requirement for imported gas.
Consequently buyers have been willing
to offer higher prices to attract cargoes
away from the US with the result that
the country’s LNG imports have grown
rapidly in recent years (Fig. 2).
Despite LNG imports into Spain

Spanish LNG import capacity is underutilized. With a current LNG import
capacity of around 31 million tpy (2.6
million tonnes/month), actual imports
of 19 million tonnes in 2006 represent
an average capacity utilization of around
60%
Contrary to the situation in these
two countries, LNG import capacity utilization in the UK has been far
higher. The Isle of Grain LNG import
terminal commenced operations in July
2005 with a capacity of 3.3 million tpy

(0.27 million tonnes/month). After a
slow start, 2.5 million tonnes of LNG
was imported in the first full year of
operation representing 75% utilization.
In fact, during winter months capacity
utilization has approached 100% (Fig.
3).
The global LNG market is currently
experiencing a significant transformation.
From the rigid structure that existed
to the end of the last decade, the market
has evolved to one in which considerable more flexibility prevails. Gas
liquefaction projects are now being
developed before all the output has
been sold, and players are investing
along the value chain to give them the
opportunity to exploit price-arbitrage
opportunities.
Even in Asia where the long-term
contract has prevailed, contract renewals
have been for shorter periods with buyers seeking to purchase LNG on a FOB
(free on board) basis, thereby enabling
them to move surplus volumes into
alternative markets if domestic demand
fails to develop as planned. Thus a more

the cargo being loaded. As an example,
if it is mid month (m) and a deal is
concluded that would result in the
cargo being loaded, delivered, and regasified in the following month (m+1),
then the m+1 futures price or Purvin
& Gertz’s estimate of the m+1 contract
price would be used as a price basis.
In comparison, if the seller is looking to sell the cargo into a more remote
market that would result in half the
cargo being regasified in the following month (m+1) and the remainder
in the ensuing month (m+2), then the
netback would be based on the average
of the m+1 and m+2 prices. Thus, the
published netback prices that can be
realized by sales from each supply point
will reflect the proximity of that supply
point to the market of interest
The seasonal factors used to determine gas sendout rates have been based
on published historical LNG import
terminal utilization data or, when not
available, on Purvin & Gertz’s assessment of the likely sendout rate based
on the seasonal characteristics of the
market concerned.
These seasonal factors are also used
in calculation of LNG regasification
tariffs, where appropriate, as it is assumed that sendout capacity is reserved
to accommodate the maximum annual sendout rate with the result that a
cargo may take longer to move into the
market in the summer than in the peak
demand months of the winter.
The amount of sendout capacity
reserved is deemed to be in proportion
to the amount of storage required to accept a full cargo as a percentage of total
LNG storage capacity at the receiving
terminal. In the calculation of LNG regasification tariffs, any LNG/gas used as
fuel is priced at the appropriate market
price for gas.
Waterborne freight rates are based
on a standard 145,000 cu m LNG carrier with the cost of bunker fuel and
boil-off LNG used as fuel reflecting
prevailing oil prices and the appropriate price of LNG in the value chain,

The LNG shipping
business is changing
rapidly.
As recently as 2004,
its history may be briefly
described as follows:
Tankers
It has evolved over the
past 4 or 5 decades. A
few owners, mainly fully integrated
operations, have been the core of
LNG shipping
history and
developed this
highly specialized business
steadily in close
cooperation
with charterers.
LNG vessels have mainly been operated in fixed trades and enjoyed attractive long-term contracts. Development
of new technical solutions has been
limited.
The competence of those involved
in LNG shipping has been indisputable.

easily derail confidence in the business
or at least damage public confidence.
This safety record has thus far
prevented LNG carriers being directly
subjected to the “regulation by disaster” principle, unlike the oil tanker
industry that has seen new regulations
after accidents involving the Amoco
Cadiz (1978), Exxon Valdez (1989),
Sea Empress (1996), Erika (1999), and
Prestige (2002), just to mention a few.
Now, however, the LNG shipping
scene is changing rapidly.
As of January 2007, 220 LNG carriers were operating and about 130 were
on order, corresponding to 59 % of
the existing fleet, based on number of
ships.
The cargo-carrying capacity of
the world’s LNG fleet will more than
double within a few years. The size of
the vessels has suddenly leapt to around
266,000 cu m, which are the biggest
ones on order currently, from around
145,000 cu m, which used to be the
standard size only a couple of
years ago.
Construction of the first LNG
carriers as we know them today
started less than 40 years ago. And
so far scrapping of LNG carriers is
practically nonexistent.

Recent, current
developments

LNG carriers typically exhibit good
technical and operational standards.
Vessels’ safety records have so far been
among the best in the shipping industry.
After about 43,000 commercial
shipments of LNG or more than 110
million of loaded miles, no accidents
with major release of cargo have ever
occurred. There have been, however,
enough minor incidents to suggest that
statistically a major mishap could occur.
Despite the industry’s frequent references to its exceptionally good safety
record, a single major accident could
62

New technical solutions are
being applied to LNG carriers,
although most of these solutions
are proven technology. To the
present, for example, vessels have been
almost exclusively powered by steam
propulsion; most carriers currently on
order will employ dual fuel, diesel-electric (DFDE) propulsion.
Megacarriers (>200,000 cu m) on
order will employ slow-speed diesel
engines running on heavy fuel oil and
feature reliquefaction plants aboard to
handle cargo boil-off. Twin propeller
arrangement is the preferred alternative
for these megacarriers. There may be
different motives for these changes, but
higher thermal efficiency and insufficient availability of competent steam

engineers are among them.
Gas-turbine propulsion is an interesting alternative, but to date only a
single carrier 29,000 cu m has been
ordered with this technology. This vessel was delivered in 1974 and was later
converted to diesel-engine propulsion.
For any LNG carrier, design life expectancy of up to 40 years has become
an industry standard. This has created a
need for higher material-fatigue standards, increased corrosion margins, and
more comprehensive corrosion protection and maintenance strategies.
New trades in less-benign waters
that include cold climate and icy conditions, as in the North Atlantic, Barents
Sea, and the Sakhalin area, are opening
for LNG shipping.
Rougher seas and larger cargo tanks
combined with membrane cargo-containment systems are increasing the
focus on liquid motions and sloshing
forces inside cargo tanks in order to
prevent damage.
And now an LNG spot market is
emerging and multiport discharge is
expected to develop. Markets for shipto-ship transfer (STS), floating storage
regas units, and floating terminals are
also emerging. In late 2006 in the Gulf
of Mexico, Excelerate Energy demonstrated the feasibility of STS and
performed the first commercial STS off
Teesside, UK, while commissioning its
second offshore LNG terminal.
Many new owners, ship managers,
charterers, port and flag authorities,
shipbuilding yards, docking-yards, terminals and operators, superintendents,
officers and crew have entered the LNG
shipping business in only a few years.
There is now a general shortage of most
categories of experienced LNG personnel. The competition is increasing for
qualified crew, with significant upward
pressure on cost as one result. At the
same time, charter rates have been
dropping during the last few years.
Competition within the mainstream
of the LNG carriers is hardening as a result. Pressure on cost and lower charter
rates compared to previous years will
require discipline by vessel operators to

maintain industry’s established safety
level.

LNG shipping is different
Despite many similarities with other
shipping segments, oil and LPG in particular, LNG shipping has specialties of
its own. Fundamental differences exist
from early specification stages of new
LNG carriers through construction and
operations.
Most owners hold a long-term view
for their LNG operations, based on
charter contracts of typically 15-20
years, and operational life spans of up
to 40 years for their vessels. Each LNG
carrier is in most cases an essential and
integrated part of a transportation chain
requiring continuous flow of LNG.
Should anything go wrong with the
ship and cause serious delay or off-hire,
it may be difficult to find and employ
other ships as substitutes within a reasonable time frame, mainly due to compatibility issues and availability of ships.
In the worst case, the LNG production
plant or the receiving terminal and the
related supply and demand chains may
be affected.
This differs from oil shipping in
which several vessels operate in the
spot market and are normally available
around the world on short notice. Interruptions of the LNG supply chain may
therefore have dramatic practical and
economic consequences.
For this shipping segment, where
standards and expectations are high,
there may be a higher and continuous need for brand management (i.e.,
building and protecting a reputation
for success in the market) particularly
among owners, not least for newcomers who have long-term ambitions and
want to strengthen their market positions but also charterers that may want
to protect themselves against negative
publicity.
It was said, for example, that Exxon
lost revenue in the range of $9 billion after the Valdez accident because
consumers did not want to buy from a
company that had caused such damage
to the environment.

Organization, competence
Given vessel management’s responsibility to ensure efficient and safe operational practices aboard, what follows
describes an increasing challenge to the
continued success of LNG shipping.
Behind incidents and accidents
aboard any LNG carrier frequently lies a
strong human element. Eighty percent
is the acknowledged figure frequently
to indicate the share of maritime accidents caused by human error.
The human element aboard vessels
includes:
• Competence of and decisions (including budgets) made by those who
define the content of the newbuilding
specification.
• Company practice (including budgets) regarding maintenance policy and
spare parts.
• Management procedures, including interface between a ship and its
owner’s land-based organization.
• Manning policy, including number of people aboard and competence
management.
• Operational routines aboard and
ashore and the interface between the
two, including emergency preparedness
procedures and training.
It is important to recognize that
competence and training issues also apply to shore staff and that how a vessel
is operated reflects to some extent the
shore organization.
The International Maritime Organization’s International Safety Management (ISM) code certification will
generally cover many of these subjects.
It is, however, important to note that
ISM is a general code, developed and
implemented as a minimum standard
for all applicable shipping segments.
Owners and ship managers involved
in LNG shipping are strongly advised
to go beyond minimum requirements
and consider in detail what they need
for long-term success, keeping 40 years’
vessel-life expectancy and high demand
for uninterrupted service, reliability,
and safety in mind.
Availability of LNG competence is
now receiving increasing attention and

frequently mentioned as a bottleneck
for the LNG industry. The main focus
is on shipboard people, even if the
increasing demand is general for the
whole LNG shipping industry. Given
that a ship is carefully designed, built,
and maintained, statistical evidence
shows that the weakest link in the chain
is human error by crew and pilots; this
could be assumed to be equally applicable to LNG carriers.
Rapid expansion in any sector of the
industry implies poor quality control,
lack of supervision due to shortage
of experienced teachers and trainers,
shortage of qualified labor, and possible
falling standards of services.
Additionally as a result of the shortage, increasing wages for experienced
LNG personnel force owners to be
prepared to pay more now to secure the
services of competent staff.
It is claimed that even if the number
of LNG carriers remained constant with
no newbuilds, the industry would still
have to struggle to replace seafarers
retiring or leaving the sea. The International Association of Maritime Universities has estimated that almost 1,500
senior officers and nearly 750 senior
engineers will be required by 2008.
The lack of qualified crew is not
going to stop newbuilds from sailing.
What are the consequences for the
safety record of the industry? There
64

is no quick fix here and the situation
requires serious management attention
and specific actions from all parties
involved.
Some people seem to believe that
seagoing personnel fully trained in
compliance with Standards of Training Certification and Watch keeping for
Seafarers (STCW95) are fully qualified
for LNG ships.
It is important to remember that
STCW95 sets standards for classroom
cargo handling training for all gas
carriers, not differentiating between
LPG and LNG carriers. The basic formal
training must be extended by further
on-the-job aboard LNG carriers. It is
up to the owner to decide its additional
requirements for training beyond what
is formally required for the different
ranks.
Again the high demands the industry
places on both availability and safety
characteristic demands of LNG carriers
must be kept in mind.
DNV Standard of Competence
SEASKILL includes standards for LNG
competence for some categories of
onboard personnel and the Society of
International Gas Tanker and Terminal
Operators Ltd. (SIGTTO) has developed
a complete set of standards for LNG operations. DNV is now as an independent
third party, certifying training courses

and simulators according to SIGTTO
standards.
One good opportunity for training
and competence building which should
not be underestimated is the newbuild
process, all the way from owners’
approval of plans and specifications,
throughout the construction period,
and final testing and commissioning in
connection with delivery. Active participation here is a practical hands-on
approach that represents a lost opportunity if subcontracted to others.
It should also be emphasized that the
need for LNG competence and updating
of such shore-based personnel as superintendents and other technical staff is
also very important. Owners should not
underestimate this and allocate funds
accordingly for necessary training of
this category of personnel as well.

Alternative propulsion
Almost all LNG carriers delivered
until recently have been powered by
steam-turbine propulsion. They use
boil-off from the liquid cargo as fuel in
combination with bunker oil.
Very high reliability and low vibration levels together with a convenient
way of handling boil-off gas are the
main reasons for the widespread use of
this arrangement.
At present, however, most LNG carriers are on order with diesel electric
propulsion, while the megacarriers on
order all have slow-speed diesel engines
based on heavy fuel oil as the only fuel.
This arrangement is supplemented by
onboard reliquefaction plants to take
care of cargo boil-off.
Reasons behind this development
include the following:
• The efficiency of a traditional
steam propulsion is the lowest (~30%)
among the alternatives.
• A service speed of 19-20 knots for
LNG carriers with more than 200,000
cu m cargo capacity will require more
power than is available from single
steam turbine installations (>61,000
kw).
• The supply of experienced steam
engineers is insufficient.

increase for HTS.
The following points may be useful
when considering fatigue life:
• Fatigue life for vessels operating in
North Atlantic trade is about half that of
those employed in a worldwide trade.
• Fatigue life of steel structures in
corrosive environments (exposed to
seawater, for example) can be roughly
reduced to half when compared to steel
that is protected. This is one reason that
coating standards and coating maintenance in ballast tanks are such important issues.
• The quality of workmanship during construction is essential for vessel

For membrane-containment systems,
the complete insulation system is then
modeled and results obtained from the
model tests used as input for the loading of the membrane system. The capacity of the membrane systems to sustain
the maximum expected loads can then
be confirmed.
There are currently a number of
uncertainties in the analysis when set
against the reality of liquid motions in
LNG prismatic cargo tanks. These uncertainties include the compressibility of
the entrapped gas, the actual loading on
the containment system (whether point
or distributed load), and the extent
to which actual
impacts with the
tank surfaces are
cushioned.

ing tests with a small (model scale
1:70) and large tank (1:20). Identical
motion tests were done with both tanks
with variations of ullage pressure and
ullage gas density. The study indicated
that Froude Scaling is currently the
most appropriate scaling law and does
not in fact provide large over-predictions, as had been suggested previously.
In order to understand applicable
scaling laws, DNV and industry partners
have prepared the necessary technology and are now in the process of
instrumenting an LNG carrier under
construction and obtaining full-scale
measurements of pressures exerted by
LNG motion in prismatic cargo tanks.
This will provide scaling factors in
measured external conditions that can
then be simulated at model scale to
obtain scaling factors at the filling levels
measured.
Although the exact contributors to
the measured loads at full scale will be
difficult to differentiate at certain filling
levels and in certain conditions, it will
nonetheless provide scaling factors that
incorporate these elements and remove
much of the current uncertainty. ✦

Hostage crisis
highlights roles
in geopolitics
While it’s difﬁcult to predict how the new
Iranian hostage crisis will end, responses
by other countries say much about modern
geopolitics.
The eternal problem with the Iranian
government is, of course, that it is difﬁcult
to predict. Internal conﬂicts explain why.
The president is a ranting apocalypticist
who serves as the puppet of ruling mullahs
but who was elected, albeit in questionable

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

voting, by people who despise the mullahs.
So was the Mar. 23 abduction of 15 British sailors and marines a planned act of the
theocracy, the work of rogue members of
the mullahs’ Revolutionary Guards, or the
result of some internal clash that got out
of control? If planned, was it an attempt to
retaliate for the UK’s anticipated support
for toughened sanctions against nuclearambitious Iran in the United Nations? Was
it indirect retaliation for the US capture of
Iranian provocateurs in Iraq? Or did the
theocracy need an external crisis to quell
seething domestic political pressure?
The rogue-mercenary theory weakened
after Tehran ﬁrst insisted that the Brits had
boated into Iranian territory then ludicrously changed the incident’s alleged location
when the UK government showed the
original cite to have been well within Iraqi
waters. At this writing, the Iranian leadership seemed determined to raise tension.
Iranian expansionism has drawn an
obviously worried Saudi Arabia out of its
normal reticence. At an Arab League meeting Mar. 28 in Riyadh, Saudi King Abdullah
scolded colleagues for crises in Lebanon,
Iraq, and Sudan.
“The real blame should be directed
at us, the leaders of the Arab nation,” he
said, blaming “our constant disagreements
and rejection of unity.” The purpose of the
meeting was to reconsider a 2002 Saudi
proposal—itself an uncharacteristically bold
move—for Israeli-Palestinian peace.
In Europe, the UK seems expected to
handle the crisis on its own. The European
Union has acted more like the Saudi Arabia
of old—quiet and, from all outward appearances, unresponsive—than the center of
solidarity it celebrated in its 50th anniversary as 15 Europeans became victims of
international kidnapping.
Meanwhile, the US increased naval
activity in the Persian Gulf.

Crude futures tally $5 price jump
In overnight electronic trading Mar. 27, crude futures prices jumped more than $5
to $68.09/bbl in New York and to $69/bbl for North Sea Brent in London, marking the
biggest 1-day price change since December 2001.
That intraday price spike was only temporary, of course, with the May contract
closing at $62.93/bbl Mar. 27 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Yet escalation of
Middle East tensions helped boost May crude prices through seven consecutive sessions to a 6-month high of $66.03/bbl Mar. 29 from a Mar. 20 closing of $59.25/bbl.
The price spike initially was attributed to false rumors of an Iranian missile attack
on a US ship and of a UK attempt to free 15 British sailors and marines seized Mar.
23 by naval units of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. The US Navy had two carrier groups
in the Persian Gulf in the greatest display of strength since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
However, there were subsequent reports that an electronic error or unusually
large purchase had stimulated a price escalation prior to the rumors. Nevertheless,
benchmark US crude was trading as high as $66.50/bbl Mar. 29 in New York, with
North Sea Brent up to $68.33/bbl in London—“this time during normal market conditions,” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. He insisted Iran
will continue to spook world oil markets in coming months.
Because of the price spike, Jakob said, “Risk managers will be forced to rerun
their stress test scenario, and they will need to use something more aggressive than
a $5/bbl overnight increase.” He said, “This should force the shorts [futures traders
with a net excess of open sales over open purchases] into some rethink on their
margin call provisions. The combination of current military activity and current tensions in the Persian Gulf leaves little risk-reward [beneﬁts] in keeping an overnight
short position, and this should for now lead to stronger short covering towards close
of business.”
Jakob warned, “Even if all the sailors were to be released, one needs to question
what would be the rule of engagement now in the region; the two sides are likely to
test each other again, and the risk of future military engagement between the two
has increased signiﬁcantly on the back of this incident.”
Positions harden
Iran formally asked UK ofﬁcials to guarantee British forces will not enter Iranian
territory in the future. The Iranians claim the British were 0.5 km inside Iranian waters
when they boarded a merchant ship to inspect for possible smuggled goods near the
Shatt al-Arab waterway dividing Iraq and Iran.
However, UK ofﬁcials said a position-tracking satellite proves British personnel
were 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi waters when seized. Even the coordinates ﬁrst
given by Iran following that incident put the British forces inside Iraqi waters. The UK
is permitted by United Nations mandates to operate in Iraqi territory.
UK Prime Minister Tony Blair said his government won’t negotiate for the captives. The UK froze bilateral activity with Iran after Iran refused consular access to the
UK personnel. Meanwhile, Iran showed on television videos of two of the sailors,
including the lone woman in the group, apologizing for violating Iranian territory.
There was talk among some Iranian ofﬁcials of putting the group on trial.
The UN Security Council expressed “grave concern” and supported calls for the
British crew’s release. Earlier, the Security Council voted unanimously to tighten
sanctions on Iran for its refusal to stop uranium enrichment for its nuclear program.
The latest resolution embargoed all sales by Iran of conventional weapons and froze
the foreign assets of 28 Iranian individuals, institutions, and companies, including
Bank Sepah. It called for nations and international ﬁnancial institutions to restrict
new grants, credits, and loans to Iran. It was a follow-up to a Dec. 23 resolution banning trade with Iran in sensitive nuclear materials and ballistic missiles.
“It has not yet been widely publicized, but we understand that the US aircraft
carrier USS Nimitz and its strike group (including one guided-missile cruiser and
four guided-missile destroyers) will depart San Diego Apr. 1 and head to the Persian
Gulf,” Jakob reported. That would put three US aircraft carrier strike groups in the
gulf—“a major escalation and a needed one if air strikes against Iran are seriously
considered, as most neighboring Arab states would not allow such a strike to be
launched from their soil,” said Jakob. Since the US cannot maintain three carriers
in those waters “forever,” he said, “The strike risk will be at its peak in the next 60
days.”

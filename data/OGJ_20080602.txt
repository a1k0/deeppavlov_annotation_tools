COVER
Differences in the clarity of the two cover images of the same
seismic profile from the Gulf of Mexico are due to differences in
the velocity model.The message is to sample and smooth seismic
velocities carefully, because the process affects image resolution and
may discard valid subsurface information.The interpreter must
look at both depth and time-based measurements. In general, timebased measurements are now disregarded for expediency, a flawed
strategy because the time-migrated measurements already have
the information, can be viewed faster, and the processing is less
expensive than the depth migration process where errors cannot be
repaired easily. An article starting on p. 36 of OGJ’s New Views of
the Subsurface special report explains the method. Images courtesy

US Senate questions oil executives on prices
A US Senate committee brought five major oil company executives back to Congress for the second time in less than 2 months
so it could ask what’s causing record high oil and gasoline prices
(See Editorial, p. 19).
The nationwide average retail gasoline price has more than
doubled since George W. Bush became president, Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy said as he opened a hearing
on oil prices. “The president once boasted that with his pals in the
oil industry, he would be able to keep prices low, and consumers
would benefit. Instead, it is his pals in the oil industry who have
benefited. American consumers, and the American economy, have
suffered immensely,” Leahy charged.
He said he wanted to hear from the witnesses about forces
beyond supply and demand which have driven crude oil prices
higher, whether to give the US Department of Justice authority to
prosecute foreign oil supplies for violating US antitrust laws, and
methods to reduce speculation in oil futures.
“This committee and the Congress need answers so that we can
act in a way the administration will not: for the benefit of consumers, for American families and small businesses. We need to get
prices under control and back to competitive levels, and we need
to do it now,” Leahy declared.
Robert A. Malone, chairman and president of BP America Inc.;
John D. Hofmeister, president of Shell Oil Co.; Peter J. Robertson,
vice-chairman of Chevron Corp.; John E. Lowe, executive vicepresident of ConocoPhillips Co., and J. Stephen Simon, executive
vice-president of ExxonMobil Corp., submitted written testimony
similar to their submissions to the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming on Apr. 1.

Mexico’s oil output continues to recede
State-owned Petroleos Mexicanos said the country’s production
and exports of crude oil fell sharply in the first quarter as output
continues to recede at Cantarell, the country’s main oil field.
Pemex said average oil production decreased by 9% to 2.875
million b/d from 3.164 million b/d produced in 2007, while exports fell 13% to 1.484 million b/d and imports of gasoline rose
by 18% to 317,000 b/d.
The country’s six refineries produced 1.52 million b/d of petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, and others.
Pemex said production of nonassociated gas increased 3% over
the same period last year to 2.643 bcfd, as a result of higher vol-

umes provided by the North.
Cantarell production has fallen by 416,000 b/d from 2007. It
produced 1.15 million b/d in March, down 5.7% from February,
the seventh straight month of waning production at the field.
Oil decline at Cantarell was partially offset by a 40% increase in
the production of Ku-Maloob Zaap to 670,000 b/d from 476,000
b/d. The results are not up to the expectations of Pemex officials,
with falls at Cantarell and other fields greater than anticipated. In
April, Pemex E&P Director Carlos Morales Gil predicted that 2008
output at Cantarell would be 1.2-1.3 million b/d, compared with
an average of 1.5 million b/d in 2007.
Morales said that Pemex nonetheless would deliver the same
volume of oil production in 2008 as in 2007 because other fields
would compensate for the decline at Cantarell.
So far, however, Pemex has been unable to do that, and the
country has had to increase its imports of oil products such as gasoline. In March, Mexico’s gasoline imports rose to 360,700 b/d,
the highest level since November 2007, largely due to the declining output from traditional fields (OGJ, May 5, 2008, p. 40).
Analyst BMI has forecast Mexican production as averaging 3.45
million b/d in 2008, falling to 3.15 million b/d by 2012.

EC: VAT adjustment would send ‘bad signal’
The European Commission has warned that French President
Nicolas Sarkozy’s proposal to adjust value-added taxes (VAT) on oil
would send a “bad signal” to producers.
“Modifying the fiscality of fuel to fight the rise in oil prices
would send a very bad signal to oil-producing countries,” an EC
spokesman said. “We would be saying that we can raise oil prices,
and this will be paid for by the taxes of Europeans,” he said.
A month before taking over presidency of the European Union,
Sarkozy said he wanted to put “the question to our European partners: if oil continues to increase, should we not suspend the VAT
taxation on the price of oil?”
Saying that it was necessary to have “the courage to tell the
French” that fuel prices were going to continue to rise, Sarkozy
also suggested allocating additional VAT income resulting from the
price rise to a fund intended to reduce the bill of the poorest.
His proposals came as French fishermen kept up protests over
high fuel costs by blocking ports and shipping, while other protestors
blocked oil tankers from entering or leaving refineries operated by
Total SA at Dunkirk and Gonfreville on the English Channel. French
consumers currently pay about 19.6% VAT on the price of fuel. ✦

reservoir. The well was drilled to 5,850 m TD in 62 m of water
about 50 km offshore.
Total said new gas compartments in the Maharaja Lela/Jamalulalam field have been detected and will require further appraisal
work to evaluate them. The new well is expected to come on stream
before yearend.
Total operates the block with a 37.5% stake. Other participants
are Royal Dutch Shell PLC (35%) and local partners (27.5%).
Total has been present in Brunei since 1986, where it operates the Maharaja Lela/Jamalulalam field, which produced 28,500
boe/d in 2007. The gas is delivered to the Brunei LNG liquefaction
plant.

ana, and Texas and their coastal communities and counties (or, in
Louisiana’s case, parishes).
The first sale with immediate revenue-sharing leases, OCS Lease
Sale 224, was held Mar. 19, according to MMS. Based on the actual
location of tracts bid in the sale, it said it calculates bonuses and
first-year rentals for fiscal 2008 would be 30% for Alabama, 27%
for Mississippi, 32% for Louisiana, and 11% for Texas.
Qualified OCS revenues are allocated among the gulf producing
states based on a formula which incorporates a state’s proximity to
certain tracts in the gulf’s Eastern Planning Area and a small section
in the Central Planning Area, MMS said.

Shell plans more Tucumcari exploration
A Shell Oil Co. affiliate plans to mount an exploratory drilling program for tight gas in eastern New Mexico’s nonproducing
Tucumcari basin.
SWEPI LP, an affiliate of Shell Exploration & Production Co., in
mid-May staked three locations in northeastern Guadalupe County
to be drilled back-to-back starting in early June.
The locations are Webb 3-23, in 23-11n-23e; Latigo Ranch
2-34, in 34-11n-23e; and Latigo 3-5, in 5-10n-23e. All are permitted to 13,150-13,500 ft or Mississippian and are thought to
be aimed at low-permeability Pennsylvanian objectives. The area’s
Pennsylvanian rocks are in the Atoka, Strawn, and Canyon formations.
Shell has been conducting tests since late 2007 but has released
no results from the Webb CD-1 well, in 25-11n-23e, in the Cuervo
subbasin (see map, OGJ, Sept. 17, 2001, p. 36). It was drilled to TD
10,910 ft earlier as part of a multiwell exploration program by Cuervo Exploration LLC, an affiliate of Gunn Oil Co., a private Wichita
Falls, Tex., independent. Shell in January won state approval for an
extended flow-test period at the well.
Shell’s locations are 6-8 miles north of Latigo Ranch, a gas accumulation discovered in 1982 and never produced. Latigo Ranch
tested gas from Strawn sandstones at 6,658-6,764 ft.
Shell asked the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division to keep
confidential all information relating to the proposed wells for 1
year after drilling and completion, but state regulations provide for
such treatment only for well completion or recompletion reports
and logs.

The US Bureau of Land Management released a supplemental
final plan for leasing in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska’s
northeast portion.
It said that the land could yield nearly 3 billion bbl of crude,
or about a quarter of the oil produced over the last 31 years at
Prudhoe Bay. The area also could provide trillions of cubic feet of
natural gas for shipment through currently planned pipelines, the
US Department of Interior agency said.
BLM will not open 219,000 acres of Teshepuk Lake and its island
to oil and gas activity under the preferred alternative it selected in
its supplemental final integrated activity plan and environmental
impact statement. The plan’s preferred alternative also would defer
leasing for 10 years on 430,000 acres north and east of the lake
that currently are not available for leasing.
The plan includes protections for polar bears, including requirements to consider impacts on areas the animals use for their
dens, according to BLM. It said that with the polar bear’s listing as
a threatened species, it will continue to work with the US Fish and
Wildlife Service on future oil and gas activities.
BLM said it expects to hold a lease sale this fall for available
portions of NPR-A’s northeast area as well as part of the reserve’s
northwest planning area. It said that it will publish a notice of availability regarding the plan’s release in the Federal Register later this Norwood logs second pay zone in Nicaragua

Porosities are 10% to more than 30%.
Log results will be further calibrated to 60 ft of retrieved wholecore sample being analyzed in Houston.
The Masachapa hydrocarbons had not previously been recognized in the San Bartolo well due to the effects of flushing of nearwellbore hydrocarbons by overweight drilling fluids, the company
said. Norwood is re-entering the well to run cased-hole logs and
determine the need for frac jobs and retesting.
“The company is now moving forward with an extensive testing program to determine the sustained productivity potential and
commerciality of these hydrocarbon-bearing formations,” Norwood said.
The wells are on the updip margin of the Sandino basin on the
845,000-acre Indoklanicsa Concession, only one third of which is
covered by seismic. The other two-thirds is considered prospective,
the company said.
Norwood’s first two wells tested gas and 34° gravity oil. It plans
to select and drill a fourth location later in 2008. The company
has found operations to be slower and more costly than expected
because of the lack of infrastructure and services.
Nicaragua has 35 wells drilled all time and does not as yet produce hydrocarbons.

sate reserves at 527 million bbl, putting the field in the top five gas
fields in Australia in terms of reserves.
In 2000 the company’s subsidiary Inpex Browse Ltd. drilled
three exploration wells, Dinichthys 1, Gorgonichthys 1, and Titanichthys 1 (the Ichthys complex), on WA-285-P permit and discovered the giant gas and condensate structure. Gas in place at that
time was estimated at 10 tcf and condensate in place at 500 million
bbl (see map OGJ, Oct 17, 2005, p. 34).
Inpex and partner Total SA of France are assessing LNG development plans, with a first cargo target now likely to be 2013.

Woodford a horizontal Anadarko basin target

Cimarex Energy Co., Denver, is pursuing gas and oil in Devonian Woodford shale with horizontal wells in the Anadarko basin
in western Oklahoma.
The company said in late April it had five wells in various stages
of completion and evaluation and was drilling three more wells.
Cimarex is evaluating use of 4,000-ft laterals, while early wells
went to 13,000 ft true vertical depth and had 2,500 ft laterals.
Cimarex’s 1H-27 Jameson, in 27-14n-10w, near Geary in
Canadian County, is the basin’s first reported horizontal Woodford completion, said IHS Inc. It flowed 2.76 MMcfd of gas and

Production

China gas wells back on stream after earthquake
China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) said 97% of its
natural gas wells in Sichuan Province have resumed production after the earthquake 2 weeks ago.
Some 208 wells out of the total 218 have resumed production,
according to Chen Ge, secretary to the board of governors.
Last week Sinopec’s giant Chuanxi gas field in Sichuan was reported to be producing at 20% of capacity after many chemical
plants were closed, up from only 10% earlier when 1,000 gas wells
were shut in (OGJ Online, May 23, 2008).

Transocean drills record extended well off Qatar
Transocean Inc. claimed its GSF Rig 127 jack up drilled a record
length extended-reach well off Qatar for Maersk Oil Qatar AS.
GSF Rig 127 drilled Well BD-04a to 40,320 ft measured depth
with a 35,770-ft lateral section in 36 days in Al-Shaheen field. The
record of 7.6 miles also is the first well in the history of offshore
drilling to exceed 40,000 ft, Transocean claimed.
The well, in 200 ft of water in the Perisn Gulf, bottomed at a
true vertical depth of 3,500 ft subsea. Inclination of its horizontal
section was 89° to just over 91°, Maersk Oil Qatar said.
The extended-reach portion surpassed by 2,000 ft the previous world extended-reach record of 38,322 ft MD set by Parker
Drilling Co. working for ExxonMobil Corp. The ExxonMobil well
was drilled by a land rig at Sakhalin-1 under the Sea of Okhotsk

in Far East Russia to a target area in Chayvo field 7 miles offshore
(OGJ, Feb. 18, 2008, p. 33). That well was drilled with the customdesigned Yastreb land rig.
Transocean said its GSF Rig 127 crew dealt with high torque in
the well’s extended-reach section. The crew used extensive deckmanagement planning and a supply boat to hold additional drill
pipe so that the rig stayed within its variable deck-load rating.
OGJ archives indicate that Well DB-04a may be the world’s
longest well bore. The former Soviet Union claimed it drilled the
vertical SG-3 research hole well to 40,228 ft in the 1970s-90s on
the Kola Peninsula near the Norwegian border west of Murmansk
(OGJ, Dec. 7, 1992, p. 32).

Bakken play gets Three Forks/Sanish producer
A well on the Williston basin Nesson anticline in Dunn County,
ND, was completed flowing oil, gas, and water from the Devonian
Three Forks/Sanish formation.
Only 52 wells have produced from little-known Three Forks/
Sanish in the US part of the basin. Continental Resources Inc., Enid,
Okla., and other operators are attempting such completions to determine whether the Three Forks/Sanish formation may be a separate reservoir not drained by a horizontal completion in the more
heavily drilled Middle Bakken zone above it.
Another consideration is whether a horizontal well bore in the
Three Forks/Sanish might recover oil by gravity drainage from the

Middle Bakken, necessitating fewer overall wells.
The US Geological Survey (USGS) included the Three Forks/
Sanish interval in its April 2008 assessment as part of the “Bakken composite continuous fractured reservoir.” The USGS used
estimated ultimate recoveries (EUR) from the basin’s Bakken/
Sanish completions to estimate the undiscovered resource in the
Nesson-Little Knife Structural Assessment Unit (see map, OGJ, Apr.
21, 2008, p. 37).
Vertical wells perforated in the Bakken and Sanish had high EUR
relative to vertical wells that only produced from the Bakken, so
matrix contribution from the porous Sanish is extremely favorable,
said Richard Pollastro, USGS geologist and Bakken formation task
leader.
Sanish wells “certainly had a resulting effect on the final mean
volume of 909 million bbl assessed” for the Nesson-Little Knife

unit, Pollastro said.
Continental Resources reported a 7-day average flow of 618 b/d
of oil, 543 Mcfd of gas, and 662 b/d of load water with 1,352
psi through a 24⁄64-in. choke at the Bice 1-29H well, in 29 and
32-146n-95w, Dunn County, ND.
The distance between a horizontal wellbore in the Middle Bakken, if drilled, and the horizontal lateral in the Three Forks/Sanish
in the Bice 1-29H is 60 ft, Continental Resources said.
Almost all of the Three Forks/Sanish completions are in Antelope field in McKenzie County, the USGS said.
The Bice well is in an undrilled spacing unit. To learn whether
the two formations are in communication, Continental would need
stabilized production from a Three Forks/Sanish lateral followed by
drilling a Middle Bakken lateral and running a frac job. Some models show that a frac will not penetrate the Middle Bakken. ✦

Pipeline to shorten West Coast deliveries
BP Products North America signed an agreement with Petroterminal de Panama SA (PTP) to ship oil to its US West Coast refineries
through the Trans-Panama Pipeline (TPP).
The 81-mile TPP originally carried crude through Panama from
the Pacific to the Atlantic. PTP will modernize the pipeline and
reverse the flow, significantly reducing delivery times and transportation costs to the US West Coast. Previously, crude cargoes sailing
from east to west took an additional 30 days to travel thousands of
miles around Cape Horn at the tip of South America.
Upon completion of the project, very large crude carriers with
2 million bbl of capacity will be able to transport Angolan and
other crudes to the port of Chiriqui Grande, Bocas del Toro, on the
Caribbean for the journey across the isthmus of Panama. Crude
will be piped to the port of Charco Azul on the Pacific coast where
it will be received by tankers for the journey to refineries on the US
West Coast. Construction is expected to take about 2 years.
The change will greatly reduce transportation time, lowering
logistic costs, and increasing flexibility of supply to US West Coast
refineries, said Bob Malone, chairman and president of BP America.
Under the 7-year agreement, BP will acquire 5 million bbl of
storage and commit to pipeline shipments of 65,000 b/d. PTP has
transported over 3 billion bbl of petroleum, mostly for BP.

Sonatrach receives EPC bids for Arzew LNG train
Algeria’s Sonatrach aims to increase its LNG export capacity by
some 20% after it constructs a new 4 million-tonne/year liquefaction train at Arzew.
Four groups submitted bids on May 18 for the engineering, procurement, and construction contract to build the train: Snamprogetti
and Chiyoda Corp.; Petrofac International and Inti Karya Persada Tehnik of Indonesia; Technip; and KBR. Commercial bids are due July
21 or possibly later in the summer, with an award to be made soon
afterwards. The train is expected on stream by 2012.
In March, Sonatrach decided to move ahead on its own with
the Arzew LNG project, as well as development of Gassi Touil gas
field, after canceling an earlier agreement with Repsol YPF and

Gas Natural of Spain.
The three firms had agreed to form El Andalous LNG, a joint
venture of Sonatrach 20% and Repsol YPF-Gas Natural 80% to invest $3 billion in the new Arzew train.
Last September, Algeria canceled the project, including Gassi
Touil gas field development, after the two Spanish companies delayed the start of work due to what they claimed was the sharp rise
of costs in the LNG industry.

Papua New Guinea LNG project gets under way
The ExxonMobil-led Papua New Guinea LNG joint venture has
signed a gas agreement with Papua New Guinea, paving the way
for an LNG project in the country.
The agreement outlines fiscal terms and legal obligations under
which the JV will operate. These terms include a 30% tax rate and an
additional profits tax that would apply after a certain level of return
has been achieved. The signing means that ExxonMobil can begin
front-end engineering and design work for the project, a process
expected to take about 16 months to complete. During this period
the JV will be pursuing LNG sales agreements and securing project
debt funding plus all permits and licenses needed.
On this basis, a final investment decision for the project is expected late in 2009 with first LNG cargoes planned for 2013.
Interest holders are ExxonMobil 41.6%, Oil Search 34.1%, Santos 17.7%, AGL Energy 3.6% and Nippon Oil 1.8%. Landholder
interests have 1.2%.

Total lets pipeline, platform contracts off Angola
Total E&P Angola has contracted Saipem SPA to install a natural
gas pipeline and injection platform off Angola.
The pipeline will extend from Block 17 to Block 2, where the
gas will be injected into two oil-depleted reservoirs. The blocks are
about 230 km northwest of Luanda. Saipem will carry out engineering, procurement, fabrication, transportation, and installation
of the 1,500-ton injection platform—the Single Central Platform—
to be installed in water 38 m deep on Block 2.
The marine activities will be carried out by the Saipem 3000
vessel in second half 2009. ✦

Global warming risks
The present news and governmentsponsored furor about global warming
has ignored all facts that do not follow
their desires blindly (OGJ, May 5, 2008,
Newsletter). The earth has been warming for the last 10,000 years. Between
10,000 and 12,000 years ago continental glaciers in North America extended
into Kansas and Nebraska. Most of the
retreat of the ice sheets occurred before
man started burning hydrocarbons and
generating CO2. Warming of the earth is
completely dependant on the amount of
energy captured by the earth from the
sun. Granted, pollution has increased,
but the major problem is unoxidized
hydrocarbon molecules present in high
population areas.
Carbon dioxide is turned into plant
material by green vegetation. More CO2
is captured and converted by trees and
grasses than is generated by man. Glaciation has occurred during earth history
more than the recent Ice Age. The global
warming furor has as a major purpose to
thwart our economic success.
It has been a fact that research institutions slant their studies to comply
with the political stances of the funding sources. All other facts that dispute
the political stances are ignored or
denigrated. The year 2007-08 has seen
a decline in solar heating with temperatures below normal in many portions of
the earth.
Another fallacy is that the rise of
oceans will wreck industry when the ice
caps on the polar areas melt. A careful
study of the amount of water present as
ice enters the oceans of the world shows
that the rise of the oceans of the world
would be less than a couple feet if not
less than 1 ft. With higher temperatures,
water from the oceans would increase
and rainfall would consequently increase
also. Therefore, desert regions would
become better watered. Major desert
regions of the earth would then have the
ability to support increased plant growth,
which in turn would increase the capture
of CO2 by plants and reduction of this
substance in the earth’s atmosphere.
A study of the last 1,000 years in
the desert regions of the southwestern

Salaries as bludgeons
For their latest trek to Capitol Hill May 21 to
absorb empty-headed insults from politicians, oil
company executives merit little pity. They’re paid
well for their work. On this point, the politicians
left no room for doubt.
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, unabashedly asked his five
industry witnesses how much money they make.
When ConocoPhillips Executive Vice-Pres. John
E. Lowe, who was under oath, said he couldn’t
respond precisely, Leahy blurted, “I wish I made
enough money that I didn’t even have to know
how much I make.” It was a moment made for
television.

What’s illuminated
As usual at these appalling inquests, what the
inquisitors illuminated most clearly was their own
misapprehension. In an opening statement, Leahy
asked the executives how they “justify exorbitant
profits on the backs of middle class, hard-working
families.” Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said, “I think
the president should be calling you all before his
little meeting place, the White House, and talking about what you are doing to the American
economy.” Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) scolded the
executives because their companies make money
and told them they “apparently have no ethical
compass about the price of gasoline.”
And so it went, senators aggrandizing themselves with questions for which they wanted no
answers, fuming about a world that doesn’t exist
in which oil company executives set the price of
gasoline and where profits attest to misbehavior.
They’ll never learn. They refuse to learn. Ignorance
serves them too well, even as it breeds policy errors damaging to their country.
In the oil industry, the temptation is strong to
ignore these indignities as misguided wastes of
time and money. The industry nevertheless must
acknowledge the body blow it sustained in the
exchange about compensation.
While the pay of top corporate executives is
public knowledge, it’s not something Congress
can or should want to do anything about. It is the
business only of corporate owners, the shareholders. Within that group, regal pay for executives has
become an issue—and not just in the oil and gas
industry. Feeling the pressure, the Securities and

Exchange Commission recently tightened disclosure requirements for the compensation of top
executives.
Pay for US chief executives has in fact climbed
beyond the cloud tops. The AFL-CIO cites a
Corporate Library study showing that the chief
executives of Standard & Poor’s 500 companies
drew average total compensation last year of $14.2
million each. The median compensation for this
group: $8.8 million. Most American workers can’t
dream in amounts that high.
Oil executives don’t dominate the upper
stratum of this aristocracy. In a ranking by the
consulting firm Equilar Inc. published Apr. 6 in
the New York Times, financial executives hold that
distinction. But lavish executive pay is a bigger
problem for oil companies than it is for others.
The Judiciary Committee hearing shows why.
Calling attention to multimillion-dollar salaries of
specific executives puts a face on popular assumptions about oil-company greed. Leahy knew this.
It didn’t matter where the numbers he elicited
ranked among high-level executives in other industries. Leahy wasn’t addressing high-level executives. He was addressing people with no prospects
for million-dollar compensation packages, people
hurt by and angry about high oil prices, people
suspicious about large profit numbers, people who
therefore derive visceral pleasure from hating oil
companies.

Old melodrama
So the stage is set for an old melodrama.
Congress will seek revenge on behalf of fabricated victims. It will impose a windfall profit tax,
outlaw “price-gouging,” reimpose price controls,
or simply keep blocking access by producers to
promising federal land. It will, in the eyes of the
vengeful, make oil companies pay for their greed.
The costs, however, will fall on shareholders and
energy consumers.
Lavish executive salaries don’t explain all or
even most of the enmity toward oil companies. As
easy targets, though, they aggravate the problem.
To the extent of their contributions to wayward
energy policy, they hurt people who don’t earn
nearly as much. Leahy has made them an energy
issue. Oil company executives and shareholders
need to respond. ✦

two US refineries—compared to $35.7
million a year ago.
Chevron Corp.’s revenues were up
37% from first quarter 2007, and its
net income climbed 9.6%. The company said while its first-quarter 2008
upstream earnings of $5.1 billion benefited from the increase in crude prices
from a year ago, its US downstream
results were essentially break-even at
$252 million.
ExxonMobil Corp.’s first-quarter
earnings set a record at $10.89 billion,
up 17% from the first quarter of 2007.
Revenues were $117 billion, up 34%.

Lower refining and chemical margins
and higher operating costs partly offset
higher commodity realizations. Also,
the company reported lower production
volumes for the recent quarter, down
5.6% worldwide from a year earlier.

US independents

Anadarko Petroleum Corp. reported
declines to first-quarter revenues and
earnings from a year earlier. Although
the company’s oil, gas, and natural gas
liquids sales were up, revenues from
gathering, processing, and marketing
were down from first quarter 2007.

incurred a hedging loss of $26 million.
This resulted in negative revenues for
Abraxas for the quarter.
The company said this unrealized
hedge loss was incurred by Abraxas
Energy Partners LP, of which Abraxas
Petroleum owns 47%.
Abraxas Petroleum said that on a
stand-alone basis, it has zero debt and
no hedges in place, which allows it
“to fully participate in the run-up in
commodity prices over the past several
months.”

Reﬁners
The US-based refiners in the sample
of companies reported weaker results
for the first 3 months of 2008. High
crude costs, especially for light crudes,
crushed refining margins.
While Frontier Oil Co., Holly Corp.,
and Valero Energy Corp. recorded net
earnings for the quarter, Sunoco Inc.
and Tesoro Corp. each posted a net loss
for the period.
Sunoco’s refining loss was larger than
expected, said analyst Eitan Bernstein of
Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc.
“Operating losses of $123 million were
larger than our expectation,” Bernstein
said. “Gross margins averaged $3.45/
bbl, 50% below comparable year-ago
levels, primarily due to rapidly rising
sweet crude oil prices. More importantly, we estimate Sunoco’s cash costs
at a high $5.50/bbl, reflecting lower
throughput volumes and higher fixed
costs,” the analyst said.
Valero’s net income declined 77% to
$261 million for the most recent quarter. Bernstein said the company’s operating earnings of $517 million were
above forecast, primarily due to higherthan-expected Gulf Coast margins.
Valero recorded relatively strong
margins on the Gulf Coast at $9.51/bbl,
partially offset by pronounced weakness
in West Coast margins at $7.89/bbl and
in the Northeast at $6/bbl.

combined revenues grew 31%.
Nexen Inc. posted the largest earnings gain in the first quarter, as its
first-quarter net income increased to a
record $630 million (Can.) from $121
million (Can.) in the first quarter of
last year. The climb was led by a 12%
increase in production volumes before
royalties as well as by higher commodity prices and high operating margins.
Although it recorded a 20% increase
in first-quarter revenues, EnCana Corp.
posted an 81% earnings decline to
$95.6 million (Can.).
EnCana reported increased production volumes, but the Calgary-based
company incurred higher operating
and administrative costs compared with
a year earlier, and its refining margins
were weaker. EnCana said the primary
reason its earnings declined, though, is
that it incurred an after-tax unrealized

mark-to-market
loss on risk management activities
of $737 million
(US).

Global Industries Inc., which announced
revenues of $301.5 million in the first
quarter, up 9% from a year earlier. Net
income was down 51% to $26.8 million.
A Houston-based offshore oil and
gas services company, Global Industries
said its net income in this year’s first
quarter was negatively impacted by
low activity in the Gulf of Mexico due
primarily to adverse weather conditions, nonrecovered vessel costs, and

delayed mobilization of vessels in West
Africa due to security and logistical
issues. Earnings in first quarter 2007
included higher margin work from
post-hurricane projects in the Gulf of
Mexico and from Pemex projects in
Latin America. Global Industries said
during the first quarter, profitability
was lower than what it could have been
in the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, and
in its Asia-Pacific and Indian operations due to the unavailability of certain
vessels undergoing drydocking activity. Nonrecovered vessel costs incurred
during these regulatory drydockings
were about $11.3 million, the company

Indonesia leaves OPEC, unhappy with inﬂuential power
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
The Indonesian government, reportedly registering a protest at high global
oil prices, has decided to terminate its
membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, effective
yearend.
22

“We are pulling out of OPEC,” said
Energy Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro.
“If our production comes back again
to a level that gives us the status of a
net oil exporter, then I think we can go
back to OPEC,” he said.
The decision to leave OPEC was
mooted earlier in May when President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said

Indonesia was struggling to boost oil
production to reach a level where “we
deserve to be a member of the organization (OGJ Online, May 8, 2008).”
At the time, the president said
Indonesia’s oil production was “below
1 million b/d because of aging wells
and that it needed about 2 or 3 years to
increase production.”

Price hawks drive
Indonesia away

While such remarks were widely
circulated as the reason for Indonesia’s
departure, Yusgiantoro suggested that
his country was unhappy with its inability to influence the organization.

Not much inﬂuence

I

ndonesia’s decision to leave the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is thought to have been
a long time in coming, and due to its
inability to cast much influence over
the group (see story, p. 22).
Bill Farren-Price, director of energy at Medley Global Advisors, said
it has been in the cards for some time
that Indonesia is no longer playing a
full part in the organization and that
its loss underlines the growing powers of what he called “price hawks”
within OPEC.
In fact, one might even argue that
Indonesia has become a victim of the
so-called price hawks in the organization.
How so? The price hawks within
OPEC were said to be hard of hearing when it came to the pleas of the
Indonesian government for increased
output of oil to ensure lower world
prices.

“The sharp rise in oil prices in
the wake of the Iranian revolution in
1979, for instance, brought a windfall profit for Indonesia and enabled
the country to carry out a wide range
of economic development programs
throughout the 1980s,” said Simbolon.

...As exports decline

But things have changed, and the
biggest change lies in Indonesia’s falling production of oil. In the 1990s,
Indonesia’s oil output was close to
1.7 million b/d, but will average just
927,000 b/d this year. That means
exports are down, while imports are
up.
The resulting financial squeeze
played into Indonesia’s decision to
leave OPEC, with Energy Minister
Purnomo Yusgiantoro saying, “There
is also one rationale—that we are not
happy with the high oil prices.”

Despite paying its annual €2 million membership fee, Indonesia has
apparently not had much influence
within the organization, but highpriced imported oil has had a decidedly adverse effect on the Indonesian
government.
For much of the past year, the Indonesian government has been struggling to bridge the increasing gap in
price between the international market
and its heavily subsidized domestic
market.
Last week, the government announced it would have to raise domestic prices by 28.7% for oil products
such as gasoline, diesel, and kerosine
due to its inability to maintain the subsidies for the domestic market.
Since then, the government has faced

further problems when the Organization of Land Transport Businessmen said
it would call a nation-wide strike by its
members if the government rejected its
proposal to be allowed to continue buying fuel oil at the old subsidized price.

Decision criticized
Former OPEC Secretary General Subroto, an Indonesian national, criticized

the government’s decision, stating that
there was no benefit to Indonesia from
leaving the organization.
Victor Shum, an energy analyst
with Purvin & Gertz Inc. in Singapore,
however, saw no substantive downside
for Indonesia’s decision to leave OPEC,
apart from a loss of prestige in no longer being a member.
OPEC itself declined to comment

on Indonesia’s departure, but a source
at OPEC-member Kuwait’s oil ministry
downplayed the move.
“Production from Indonesia is not
large and represents a small amount of
OPEC’s production,” the source said.
“OPEC will remain strong with its supplies to the world and would welcome
any country with a reasonable production level to join.” ✦

These arrangements resulted in the
government’s gaining revenues from
first production, many years before
the project had recovered costs. This is
in contrast to the current petroleum
resource rent tax (PRRT) regime where
tax is paid only after a project has recovered capital costs, Voelte said.
It is a quirk of history that since the
NWS project was granted its exemption, the tax regime for other offshore
developments such as Bass Strait has
changed to the payment of a PRRT
on production rather than a crude oil
excise.
However, while it is true that the
NWS partners were better off relative
to PRRT, it is unclear whether they will
remain in front under the excise regime
now that the condensate exemption has
been removed.
Despite the NWS group’s complaint
over the budget decision, perhaps the
most valid criticism is that the government’s decision was made without
any consultation with the companies
concerned or the industry in general
through the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association.
Such lack of consultation sends ‘danger’ signals to industry, they say, even if
in this case the ultimate outcome may
later prove beneficial. ✦

‘Coherent and clear’
Over a longer period, alternative and
renewable energy resources will need to
play a growing role, Rice continued. “To
that end, we are designing a boiler that
can burn any kind of biofuel. The US
will need to draw equally from government, business, and nongovernment
organizations to create an energy and
environmental policy that is coherent
and clear,” he said.
He noted that GE moved into wind
power when it bought Enron Corp.’s
operations after the Houston diversified
energy company went into bankruptcy.
The business has become profitable but
probably wouldn’t have been if European countries hadn’t offered major
subsidies during the 1990s, he continued. Solar power today is where wind
power was 10 years ago, he said.
But government incentives will
need to last longer than a year or two,

principal for tax policy in Deloitte Tax

these circumstances,” he said during the
press briefing.
“The investment community is very
plugged in to the uncertainty about
how carbon will be regulated. Energy
investment decisions far exceed politicians’ views. They involve two or three
election cycles at least,” observed James
A. Slutz, acting principal deputy assistant US energy secretary and director
of the US Department of Energy’s fossil
energy office.
Stretch said budget gridlock has
made federal tax policies fall behind, so
politicians are responding by finding
someone to blame. Record high crude
oil prices have increased oil companies’
profits, making them an easy and obvious target, but the Deloitte national tax
specialist does not expect this “policy of
shifting responsibility to work, because
President [George W.] Bush will veto
any tax increase in a minute.” He also
anticipates that the US Senate will cut
the House’s 6-year alternative and renewable energy tax incentives to 1 year.

Best opportunity now
Branko Terzik, energy and resources
regulatory policy leader at Deloitte
Services LP in McLean, Va., said a recent
survey of public attitudes which the
company commissioned found apprehension when coal entered alternative
energy discussions. “Carbon sequestration is very far away. A utility can’t call
a manufacturer and order a system yet.
That leaves energy efficiency as the best
immediate opportunity,” he told reporters at the press briefing.
Alternative and renewable energy
research projects need tax credits to
proceed, he continued. It also will take
time for manufacturers and consumers
to fully react to higher energy prices,
he said. “People don’t use energy.
Their devices do. It will take time for
more efficient models to come into the
fleet, but it will happen. Automakers
are beginning to react.” Hyundai, for
example, announced that it no longer
plans to build a US plant to produce V8
trucks that it earlier had announced,
Terzik said.

Addressing climate change and
energy security together will accelerate instead of limit economic growth,”
Stanislaw said.
Gregory E. Aliff, vice-chairman for
US energy and resources leader at Deloitte LLP, is anticipating “high prices,
followed by higher prices, followed
by an inevitable consumer backlash.”
Producers and regulators understand

the situation, he said during the press
briefing, but consumers “don’t see the
train coming at them regardless of the
alternatives because none of the alternatives are free.”
McLarty was more optimistic. “I
think the people are ahead of the politicians. They’re ready for clear, sensible
policies and ready to move ahead,” he
maintained. ✦

The worst time
for a bad image

I

t’s not often that a message from
a break-out session at a financial
service company’s energy conference
is dramatically illustrated within a
few days. But it happened the week
of May 19.
The May 20 oil and gas break-out
session during the 2008 Deloitte Energy Conference focused on the public’s perception of the industry. It’s
not good, panelists quickly agreed.
“There’s an urgent and ongoing
need to educate people about the
fundamentals of energy, whether
members of Congress or the general
public,” suggested James A. Slutz,
acting principal deputy assistant US
energy secretary.
Just how urgent and ongoing
became obvious when five major oil
company executives testified before
the US Senate Judiciary Committee
on May 21 and the House Judiciary
Committee’s antitrust task force on
May 22.
Several federal lawmakers said they
simply wanted answers. “I hear most
from my constituents that gasoline
prices are too high. They’re looking
for explanations and so am I,” said
Rep. Betty S. Sutton (D-Ohio) during
the House committee’s hearing.

ing the Deloitte conference session.
But the real wake-up call came after
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005
when several were called before Congress and accused of manipulating
supplies and markets, Cavaney said.
API and its members have been
working hard to make sure they are
part of the growing US discussions
on energy and the environment ever
since, he continued. “We have seen
some very modest changes in the
conversation, but we still have a lot of
work to do,” he said.

‘Politically disenfranchised’

But Jim Cox, a senior vice-president and oil, gas, and chemicals
specialist at Hill & Knowlton, said
that a survey by that firm found that
87% of the respondents ranked the
oil industry as the worst, and 86%
said that they don’t trust it to solve
the nation’s energy problems.
“There’s an enormous amount of
information the oil industry has that
should be part of the national discussion, but it’s politically disenfranchised. It has been a sporadic communicator. It has to engage motorists
and environmentalists. It needs to
own the issue and not tolerate having
a bad reputation,” he maintained.

Campaign aides:
Motor fuel transition
may be starting
Record high crude oil and gasoline
prices may be starting a transition to
clean fuels from renewable and alternative resources, energy advisors from the
three leading US presidential campaigns
said.
“I believe we’ll see a demand
response to higher prices,” said Elgie
Holstein, an advisor to the campaign of
US Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.). “That
said, I also think commodity markets
are responding to uncertain policies. So
while we’re not in an emergency situation, we are in a transition. There are
several areas where we can start working,” Holstein said. “Energy efficiency is
the low hanging fruit.”
Rebecca Jensen Tallent—emphasizing
that it was her personal opinion and not
that of her boss, US Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.)—said Americans tend to make
dramatic energy changes when their
pocketbooks are hit hard. “We may be
at a point where we’re ready to move
away from oil-based transportation
fuels and conventional coal-fired power
plants. We’re at the brink,” she said.
Dan Utech, who advises US Sen.
Hillary R. Clinton’s (D-NY) presidential
campaign, said, “We’re beginning to see
a transition, but with a growing awareness of global warming. The question
now is how quickly the federal government will begin to play a role. The states
have had to take the lead up until now,”
he said.
The trio, who spoke at an energy
forum at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington,
DC, said their candidates do not favor
authorizing oil and gas leasing within
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The
candidates’ outlooks toward leasing
more of the Outer Continental Shelf

ranged from Clinton and Obama’s
opposition (with Clinton saying more
leasing may be appropriate in Gulf of
Mexico areas where an immediately
adjacent state wants it) to McCain’s support for giving a coastal state authority
to seek an end to federal leasing bans
off its coast.

Environmental emphasis
While they agreed that the issues are
closely related, the three presidential
campaign advisors spoke more about
the environment than about energy. Tallent said that she was taking care not to
say much about energy because McCain
plans to do “a fairly massive energy
rollout” within the next few weeks. But
she added that the Arizona Republican’s
stance on climate change has been
stronger “than many other members of
his party, including the current administration, to be frank.”
McCain proposes returning US
carbon emissions to 2005 levels by
2012 and to 1990 levels by 2020, she
continued. “He believes that a capand-trade system must harness human
ingenuity in pursuit of market-based
alternatives to carbon-based fuels. He
also believes that an effective climate
policy must support rapid, sustained

economic growth. This probably will be
a key issue in the upcoming debates,”
Tallent said.
Clinton considers heavy US dependence on foreign oil and global climate
change to be two of the biggest issues
in the 2008 presidential campaign,
according to Utech. She would back
a repeal of tax breaks for major oil
companies and support a basic cap-andtrade framework similar to Obama’s and
McCain’s, he said. Her approach differs
from the other two candidates by using
complementary programs in other areas
to achieve climate change goals, the
advisor said. For example, she thinks a
national Renewable Portfolio Standard
(RPS) could keep carbon allowance
trading from producing windfall profits
for some companies, he indicated.
Obama’s climate plan includes a
cap-and-trade program with auctions,
an 80% reduction in carbon emissions
by 2050, a low-carbon fuel standard,
a 25% RPS by 2005, a ban on new
coal-fired power plants using traditional
designs, support of verifiable international offsets and emissions reporting,
an effort to reduce deforestation, and
re-engagement with other countries
in efforts to reduce global warming,
Holstein said.

Oil import dependence
The Illinois Democrat also sees
heavy US dependence on foreign oil
producers, growing imports, and
tightening global supplies as a major
2008 campaign issue, his advisor said.
He said that Obama would propose
an alliance of oil-importing nations,
including China and India, to work
together for reduced demand; treat
oil dependence as a national security
threat, and “involve the American
people in the fight.”
The advisors were vague on their
candidates’ stances toward congressional proposals to give the US Department of Justice authority to prosecute
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for violating US antitrust
laws. “Sen. Clinton believes OPEC is a
cartel and we should use the tools we
have to influence,” Utech said.
Obama has not spoken out on this
issue, Holstein indicated. “But I believe
one pillar of the argument toward more
aggressive action toward OPEC is its
collusive behavior in setting production
levels. This collusive, or should I say collaborative, behavior is in contrast to the
traditional free market approach which
America favors,” he said. ✦

BLM: Most remaining federal onshore oil, gas off-limits
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US onshore public lands contain an
estimated 31 billion bbl of crude oil
and 231 tcf of natural gas, reported the
US Bureau of Land Management in its
latest inventory.
It also found that 60% of the onshore federal acreage with oil and gas
potential is closed to leasing, effectively
making 62% of the oil and 41% of the
gas inaccessible.
Another 30% of federal onshore oil
and 49% of federal onshore gas may be
developed subject to seasonal timing
and other restrictions over and above

standard lease terms, according to the
inventory, which the Energy and Policy
Conservation Act of 2000 requires.
In the 279 million acres that the
inventory covered, 8% of the crude and
10% of the gas was accessible under
standard lease terms, officials of BLM
and the US Department of the Interior
said. The land includes acreage managed
by BLM and other DOI agencies, and by
the US Forest Service, which is part of
the US Department of Agriculture.
“The report itself does not make
recommendations. However, a normal
person could ask why 61% of available
onshore oil resources are not available
when prices are about $130/bbl. Our

hope is not to give the solution but
begin the discussion of what to do with
our domestic resources,” said assistant
Interior secretary for land and resources
C. Stephen Allred in a teleconference
with reporters.
Remaining onshore natural gas on
federal land is most heavily concentrated in southwestern Wyoming while
the biggest concentrations of remaining
onshore oil are along Alaska’s North
Slope, according to Richard Watson, a
senior physical scientist at BLM who
also participated in the teleconference.

now has to do with gasoline and motor
fuel prices, I have a great concern about
what’s happening to the price of natural
gas. Its price has doubled in a very short
period. If you look at its relationship to
oil prices, you can see that the natural
gas price has not appreciated to the
level it might be. That has huge implications for the economy,” Allred said.
He conceded that deciding to lease
more federal acreage won’t bring more
oil or gas to the market immediately,
but added that it could have a psychological impact. “A commitment for
more domestic production may well
have an impact on price beyond what it
could contribute to supplies. We’re not
talking about ignoring environmental

and other issues. What we are encouraging, and what I think this report allows
us to start, is considering whether we
are better able now than we were in the
1980s to protect important environmental values and still develop oil and
gas,” he said.
BLM issued similar reports in 2003
and 2006 as required by EPCA but expanded the inventory’s scope to include
conditions of approval, such as seasonal
restrictions, under a requirement of the
2005 Energy Policy Act. Six study areas
were added, and barriers to development were assessed for the first time,
Watson said.
Allred said that while constraints on
additional development may exist due

Maari ﬁeld FPSO completed at Jurong shipyard
Sembcorp Marine Inc.’s Jurong shipyard
delivered the Raroa floating production, storage,
and offloading (FPSO) vessel to Tanker Pacific
Offshore Terminals Pte. Ltd. in early April
2008.
Tanker Pacific is leasing the Raroa FPSO
to OMV New Zealand Ltd. for installation in
Maari field, off New Zealand’s South Taranaki
coast (OGJ, Apr. 28, 2008, p. 30).
The shipyard converted the 92,802 dwt
tanker MT Andaman Sea into the Raroa FPSO.
The conversion included:
• Installing an internal turret.
• Installing three boilers on deck to generate 24 Mw of power.
• Renewing the entire piping and electrical
systems.
• Installing process facilities for crude
separation, water injection, and chemical
injection.
The FPSO has a designed capacity to
process 40,000 bo/d and to store 646,548
bbl of oil. Maari field, discovered in 1983, is in
100 m of water about 80 km from the South
Taranaki coast.
OMV estimated that cost of developing the
field would be about $360 million and that
the field would recover about 50 million bbl of
oil during its life of more than 10 years.
The FPSO will receive production from
wells completed from a not-normally manned
wellhead platform.
On the fixed platform, OMV plans to have

to rig and oilfield supply capacity, he
believes the oil and gas industry would
be capable of producing more domestic
energy. He also questioned concerns
raised by Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee Chairman Jeff
Bingaman (D-NM) over whether lessees
are moving quickly enough to develop
their holdings. “Those leases are offered
for a specific period. No one can sit on
them. The question is whether they are
worth developing. That’s a matter for
the leaseholder to decide. He pays the
federal government rentals and bonuses
whether he moves ahead or not. Our
goal is to make sure the government
and public get a fair return,” Allred said.
He said that any discussion of
whether to lease more acreage should
reflect improvements in technology that
would allow oil and gas to be produced
with substantially fewer environmental
impacts.
“I’m not being critical of what’s
been done in the past,” Allred said.
“Given what’s happening to oil and gas
prices, however, I think we need to look
at the choices we’ve made and ask if
they are still appropriate. This report can
provide a basis for serious discussions,”
he said. ✦

the Senate Judiciary Committee a day
earlier (OGJ Online, May 22, 2008).
The other four echoed Hofmeister’s
call for increased access to domestic
oil and gas resources. “This is the only
government in the world that denies its
citizens access to known domestic oil and
gas reserves,” Simon said. “There’s plenty
of evidence that the companies represented here are starved for access to more
prospective acreage,” Lowe observed.

SUBSURFACE MAPS

DE-MYSTIFIED

The key to effectively using subsurface maps is
to know what you are investigating and what
map types are most appropriate. Doing this
will allow you to visualize various geologic
and hydrologic features in any dimension
from a one-dimensional cross section to a 4-D
production map.
Jonathan C. Evenick’s Introduction to Well
Logs and Subsurface Maps is a must-have for
professionals like geologists, geophysicists,
and environmental consultants. It introduces
different types of geophysical logs and

basic well data, and subsurface problems
that can be solved using geophysical logs and
subsurface maps.

Kempthorne says polar bear threatened, not endangered
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The polar bear will be listed as a
threatened species under the federal
Endangered Species Act (ESA), announced US Interior Secretary Dirk A.
Kempthorne on May 14.
He said his decision follows US Fish
and Wildlife Service Director Dale A.
Hall’s recommendation and is based on
the best available science, which shows
that loss of sea ice, and not oil and gas
development or native populations’
subsistence activities, threatens and
likely will continue to threaten polar
bear habitat.
“Because polar bears are vulnerable
to this loss of habitat, they are, in my
judgment, likely to become endangered
in the foreseeable future—in this case,
45 years,” the secretary said during a
press conference, which included Hall
and US Geological Survey Director Mark
Myers. He noted that polar bears already
are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which has provisions that are more stringent than those
in the ESA. “The oil and gas industry
has been operating in the Arctic for decades in compliance with these stricter
provisions. The Fish and Wildlife Service
says no polar bears have been killed due
to encounters with oil and gas operations,” he said.
He also said listing the polar bear as
threatened should not open the door to
using the ESA to regulate greenhouse
gas emissions from automobiles, power
plants, or other sources. “That would be
wholly inappropriate. The ESA is not the
right tool to set US climate policy,” he
maintained.
32

Alaskan ofﬁcials concerned
The announcement produced
expressions of concern from Alaskan
officials. US Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alas.)
said he was disappointed and disturbed
because scientists have observed there
now are three times as many polar bears
in the Arctic as there were in the 1970s.
“Never before has a species been listed
as endangered or threatened while occupying its entire geographic range,”
he said.
He said DOI’s action opens the door
for many other Arctic species to be
listed, which would hamper Alaska’s
ability to tap its natural resources.
“Reinterpreting the ESA in this way
is an unequivocal victory for extreme
environmentalists who want to block all
development in our state,” he declared.
Canada, which has the world’s largest polar bear population, has chosen
not to list the animal as threatened or
endangered but as a species of “special
concern,” according to US Sen. Lisa
Murkowski (R-Alas.). She suggested
that FWS and DOI erred in their decision because it is too soon to determine
the impacts of the loss of sea ice on the
present polar bear population.
“I am concerned that a threatened
listing could have serious ramifications
for Alaska and the development of all of
our natural resources. I certainly don’t
believe a threatened listing should affect
the construction of an Alaskan natural
gas pipeline, or of any other oil and
gas projects, since there is zero evidence that any such project has harmed
bear populations in the least. Clearly
we want to promote the use of cleanburning natural gas to reduce carbon
emissions,” Murkowski said.

Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said that
while the state was disappointed with
the decision, it will assist FWS to ensure
that polar bear populations remain
viable for decades to come. She also
said that she hopes federal actions do
not threaten the North Slope’s oil and
gas industry, which she described as
viable, productive, and environmentally
responsible.

Congressional reactions
Kempthorne’s decision displeased
leaders of the US Senate Environmental
and Public Works Committee, but for
different reasons. Chairman Barbara
Boxer (D-Calif.) said that while the
listing was welcome news and long
overdue, she was deeply concerned
that the administration’s plan will deny
the polar bear some key protections
under the ESA. “The plight of the polar
bear is a stark reminder that the planet
is already experiencing the ravages of
global warming. Today’s announcement
underscores how important it is for the
Senate to pass national legislation to cut
global warming pollution and avert the
dangerous effects of climate change,”
she said.
James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), the
committee’s ranking minority, said
that the decision apparently was based
more on politics than science. He said
that FWS estimates that there now are
20,000-25,000 polar bears, up substantially from levels of 5,000-10,000
during 1950-60. “Credit should be
given to protection already provided

Protection Act, the several international
conservation treaties, including the

Polar Bears and the US-Russia Polar Bear

2006, as well as conservation education
and outreach agreements with native
peoples,” he suggested.
“The regulatory tools of the ESA
function best when at-risk species are
faced with local, tangible threats. Greenhouse gas emissions are not local. The
implications of today’s decision, therefore, will undoubtedly lead to a drastic
increase in litigation and eager lawyers
ready to use this listing to do exactly
what they have intended to do all along:
shut down energy production,” Inhofe
warned.
US Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.),
who chairs the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global
Warming, said the Bush administration
finally acknowledged that the polar bear
needs to be listed under the ESA after

The critical role played by accurate seismic velocity measurements in
imaging is well documented. Optimal
summing of prestack time migrated
(PSTM) data depends on accurate
seismic velocity measurements, and the
PSTM image quality is degraded when
suboptimal velocity measurements are
used in stacking the data.
Seismic interval velocity models are
needed for prestack depth migration (PSDM), and substandard
velocity models yield substandard
depth images. In both processing
strategies, flat offset gathers are
used to gauge the validity of the
velocity used.

L O P M E N T

Seismic velocities are also used to
generate pore pressure and stress volumes for well planning and subsurface
interpretation. Accurate PSTM velocity measurements and PSDM models,
calibrated to wells, are critical to success
in these areas.
Examples of costly well failures
traced to incorrect velocity measurements can be found in the literature,

The effect of smoothing is illustrated by superimposing the interval velocity slice of Fig. 1
with the seismic interval velocity computed over a coarser time interval (500 ms) outlined
by the dashed polygon. In essence, we compare the interval velocity computed at 100 ms
sampled intervals with a coarser, average interval velocity computed between two horizons
that bracket the slice. The channel pattern is preserved. The smoothing produces less
resolution while reducing noise.

O NSHORE WILCOX DELTA SYSTEM

In the following examples from the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the data are
processed through standard time migration templates, but processing velocities were chosen from tightly sampled
semblance measurements made with
an auto volume picker. In many standard templates, semblances are often
sampled coarsely and then smoothed,
resulting in a loss of valid information and resolution. Consequently, the
information illustrated in the following examples is often unavailable to the
interpreter.
It is important to note that the
choice of sampling interval dictates
subsurface sampling and is in itself a
smoothing process.

though they are not numerous. Preventable, costly failures caused by errors in
velocity are preferably forgotten, rather
than documented.
In this article we discuss the use of
seismic velocity trends in subsurface
interpretation. Specifically, we discuss
measuring accurate velocity trends
for lithology prediction and examine
time and depth velocity trends near
hydrocarbon accumulations. We use
data examples to illustrate the effects of
sampling and smoothing of subsurface
velocity information in preserving valid
trends. Finally, we illustrate the impact
of oversmoothing of the velocity trends
on the interpretation of subsurface
depth structures.
Time migration seismic velocities
discussed in this article are measured
using the standard semblance method.
These velocities are the maximum coherency seismic velocities from which
interval velocities are computed using
the well known Dix formulation.1
Our semblance measurements are
sampled densely, 300 ft by 300 ft by
100 milliseconds, unless otherwise
noted. Depth models are generated
from interval velocities obtained from
travel time tomography measurements;
however, these velocities are more
coarsely sampled and smoothed than
the PSTM seismic velocities.

The Dix interval velocity is shown in color; darker colors correspond to a sandier section. The yellow outline is an interpretation
of the downdip extent of the sand packages; the white arrow indicates direction away from the sand source and loss of
reservoir targets, which has been conﬁrmed by well control. Note the local low velocity zones downthrown to the expander,
which correlate to the Picaroon gas ﬁeld complex. The deep low velocity zone feature on the lower right of the ﬁgure has not
been tested. The lighter, yellow colors upthrown to the expander have been penetrated by a few wells that failed to ﬁnd
reservoir sands.

Direct detection
Velocity measurements may be
mapped and the mapped features correlated directly to lithologic features. As in
any mapping, the degree of confidence
in the features and associated correlation will depend on the density of the
mapped data set. The first example is a
channel feature about 3,000 ft below
the mud line. The channel is easily rec-

ognized using seismic interval velocities
(Figs. 1 and 2).
Fig. 1 shows an interval velocity slice
calculated from high density maximum
coherency seismic velocities displayed
in color; the darker colors represent
faster velocities. Depth contours generated from vertical depth conversion
using a time map of the channel and
the PSTM seismic velocities are superimposed on the interval velocity slice.

From Fig. 5, a correlation between

tion or extraction of lithologic information by integration of velocity data
and prestack time migrated data. In
this section we compare PSTM and
PSDM velocity trends. Generally, PSDM
velocities are smoother and sampled on
a coarser grid than the 300 ft by 300 ft
by 100 ms grid typically used for our
PSTM measurements.
The area of investigation is a deepwater field in the Gulf of Mexico; a salt
rimmed minibasin with calibration
provided by well control in oil bearing Pliocene-Miocene age sands. Our
discussion focuses on seismic velocity
measurements in the sedimentary por-

tion of the basin, although the approach
may be extended under “well-behaved”
salt. Two substantially orthogonal
8,000-m cable 3D surveys were acquired over the field and are the source
of the data. It is important to note that
the surveys were processed in time and
depth and that the velocity trends for
each survey were derived independently
of one another. The surveys will be
labeled A and B, and acquisition directions are indicated in the map display
of Fig. 7.
Fig. 6 shows a profile through the
field with a color overlay of the maximum coherency prestack time migration velocities. Note the low velocity
zone to the right of the figure which
is the focus of our discussion. The low
velocity zone to the left correlates to

differ; however, our focus is the velocity trend near the pay horizon.
The PSDM profile from survey A is
shown on Fig. 9 with the PSDM interval
velocities overlaid in color. The comparable PSTM profile from survey A is
shown in Fig. 10, with the PSTM Dix
interval velocity in color. Both time and
depth velocities indicate a low seismic
interval velocity zone near the pay. The
PSTM Dix interval velocities are more
densely sampled and have little smoothing and hence are noisier than the
PSDM velocities, but the low velocity
zone is still present in these hands-off
semblance based measurements.
The low velocity zone that accompanies the strong amplitude response of
the producing reservoir is highlighted
with the ellipse; the PSDM interval
velocity cuts across the white depth
contours of Fig. 8. The low velocity
zone on the left is associated with other
field pays and is not the subject of the
present discussion. The interval velocity
trend has not been discarded by undersampling and oversmoothing when
building the depth migration velocity
model of survey A.
Fig. 10 is the same profile extracted
from the 3D PSTM volume of survey A;
high density, semblance based, seismic velocity measurements were used
to compute the Dix interval velocity,
shown in color. The PSTM velocity measurements have little smoothing, and
the noise is apparent. The low velocity
trend is preserved in the time-based
processing, serving as quality control
for the PSDM velocity model. The presence of very different trends between
the time and depth processes serves as
a powerful diagnostic. The PSTM and
PSDM trends are related; if valid PSTM
velocity trends are not preserved in
the depth model because of improper
sampling or oversmoothing, the depth
model will result in poor image quality or invalid pore pressure prediction, if the latter is based on the overly
smoothed depth velocity model.
Figs. 11 and 12 show comparable
PSTM and PSDM profiles taken from

PSTM seismic interval velocity trends,
derived from densely sampled semblances, retain the low velocity zone
in the high amplitude area of pay (Fig.
11). However, the low velocity region is
not present in the PSDM velocity model
used in survey B (Fig. 12). A comparison of Figs. 9 and 12 indicates that the
smoothed velocities used in survey B’s
PSDM also produces a poorer, less crisp
depth image of the producing horizon
from that obtained from survey A.
The gridded PSTM maximum coherency seismic velocity measurements
from both surveys were compared near
the level of the pay horizon. Although

not displayed, this difference is about
50 m/sec between surveys A and B in
the sedimentary basin; larger variations
are reflected by measurements in and
around salt. However, the difference is
nearly uniform over the area of interest; the PSTM seismic velocity trends are
similar and the low velocity zone near
the pay is recorded by both surveys.
This example demonstrates the need
to carefully consider the sampling and
smoothing operators used in constructing the PSDM velocity model. The
failure to preserve the low velocity zone
in survey B’s PSDM velocity model is
attributed to undersampling or over-

The depth model of Survey B effectively discards the low velocity response over the pay horizon due to coarse sampling and
excessive smoothing. This depth velocity model is not useful to the velocity interpreter. Important “details” have been left out
of the model and image quality deteriorates because of the incorrect velocity model.

smoothing, and such errors adversely
impact subsurface interpretation.
Although the depth contours are not
significantly affected in this case, the
omission of the low velocity zone near
the pay horizon can be a detail important to the interpreter attempting to
integrate seismic velocities into evaluation of the subsurface.
The example also demonstrates the
possible use of seismic time-migrated
velocity measurements for quality control by the geophysical processor and
subsurface interpreter prior to implementing the more resource intensive
depth migration process. The quality

of semblance measurements depends
on data conditioning; we would have
obtained better results if the processing workflow had been optimized to
make the best semblance measurements. Comparison of the unbiased
time migration measurements between
orthogonal surveys was a goal secondary to our PSDM effort; we routinely
skip the time processing and associated
velocity measurements as a matter of
expediency.

new fleet of rigs.
Southwestern is an
integrated energy company primarily
focused on exploration and production
of natural gas in the US. It’s engaged
in natural gas and crude oil exploration and production in the Arkoma
basin, East Texas, Permian basin, and the
onshore Gulf Coast. The company also
has natural gas distribution activities
in northern Arkansas and midstream
activities.

DeSoto Drilling
In 2005, Southwestern Energy
formed DeSoto Drilling Inc., located
primarily in Conway, Ark., to conduct
some of its drilling operations in the
area. By late 2006, the new company
took possession of 15 new, purposebuilt land rigs, said Alan Stubblefield,
senior vice-president at Southwestern,
who oversees DeSoto Drilling. The fleet
drills exclusively for Southwestern,
Stubblefield told OGJ (Fig. 1).
DeSoto Drilling operates two NOV
IDEAL 1500 rigs working in East Texas
and 13 rigs working in the Fayetteville
shale:
• Ten, Cowan MD-500 super singles.
• One NOV Rapid Rig (automated
single).
• Two Atlas Copco RD 20 truckmounted rigs.

outside-operated wells.
The company plans a multiyear
development drilling program in East
Texas that it categorizes as “low-risk.”
In 2008, it plans to invest about $152
million in East Texas, where it expects
to drill about 55 wells, including 21 net
wells in the Angelina River trend area.

Pennsylvania
In 2008, Southwestern expects to invest $26 million in
various exploration and new ventures projects, including drilling
as many as three vertical wells
targeting the Marcellus shale in
Pennsylvania.
The Marcellus shale lies in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
Other operators in the play include Rex
Energy, Denver-based Energy Corp. of
America, and XTO (OGJ Online, Apr.

wells were stimulated with hydraulic
fracturing with slickwater and some
crosslinked gel stimulation treatments.
Southwestern said that microseismic
data from multistage hydraulic fracs in
the Fayetteville shale can “help demonstrate the productivity along the length
of a horizontal lateral as long as the
data show a consistent pattern that the
stimulations treated the entire lateral
length” (OGJ, Apr. 14, 2008, p. 19).

Fayetteville wells

DeSoto Drilling Inc. has 10 Cowan MD-500 super single rigs drilling the Fayetteville shale for Southwestern Energy.This rig was drilling in 2007 (Fig. 2, photo from Southwestern Energy Co.).

Southwestern has drilled and completed 142 wells with lateral lengths of
more than 3,000 ft through Mar. 31,
2008.
During this first quarter, Southwestern’s typical horizontal well had an
average completed well cost of $2.9
million/well, an average horizontal lateral length of 3,285 ft, and average time
to drill to total depth of 15 days from
reentry to reentry.1
As the company continues to drill
wells with longer laterals in some of its
pilot areas, the number of drilling days
and well costs may increase, Southwestern says.
Southwestern forecasts that the average gross ultimate recovery from wells
with horizontal laterals greater than
3,000 ft will range from 2.0 to 2.5 bcf/
well with an average completed well
cost of about $3.0 million/well.

West said he can run the RD20 with
a three-man crew; the work isn’t physically demanding because all the systems
are hydraulic—“the hoists and winches

at a new location. They drill for 31⁄2 days
and then spend 4-6 hr to cap the well
and tear down the rig. Then they move
on to one of more than 100 site pads in
the area waiting for a DeSoto rig.
“Drilling can get tough” in the
sands, he said, especially when they hit
a “ratty” formation.

Fayetteville production
In 2007, Southwestern’s Fayetteville
reserves were 716 bcf of natural gas
(49% of total proved reserves) and
produced 53.5 bcf of gas (47% of total
production) the same year.
As of mid-April 2008, the company’s
gross operated production rate from the
Fayetteville shale play was about 400
MMcfd, including about 11 MMcfd
from 12 wells producing from conventional reservoirs. This is a fourfold
increase from gross production of about
100 MMcfd at yearend 2006.
Under an assumption that half the
acreage is developed at 80-acre spacing
and produces 1.4 bcf/well, the play has
a potential for 11 tcf of gross ultimate
gas recovery, according to Southwestern

NMR logs

A new approach for evaluating neutron magnetic resonance (NMR) logs
can determine permeability in tight
gas reservoirs. The bulk gas-magnetic
resonance permeability (BGMRK) has
the same value in oil-based (OBM) and
water-based (WBM) muds because it
depends on gas reentry to the flushed
zone after a mud cake is formed and
mud invasion stops.
Analysis of tight gas sand reservoirs
is difficult. Many tight formations are
complex, producing from multiple
layers with different permeabilities that

NMR logs differ from conventional
neutron, density, sonic, and resistivity
logs because the NMR measurements
provide mainly lithology independent
detailed porosity and are a good hydrocarbon potential indicator. NMR logs
also can determine formation permeability and capillary pressure.
Evaluators have used these NMR applications in a gas sand reservoir with
different facies and permeability variations from less than 0.1 md to more
than 100 md. Evaluation techniques
include:
• Combining NMR and bulk density

data to reduce uncertainty in porosity.
• BGMRK approach that provides
a simple facies independent model to
calculate permeability.

Gas-condensate reservoir
The example that shows the use
of the BGMRK approach is for a gas
-condensate field producing from a
Lower-Mesozoic reservoir. The reservoir
is a tight heterogeneous gas shaly sand
reservoir. It suffers from lateral and
vertical heterogeneity due to diagenesis
effect (kaolinite and illite) and variations in grain size distribution.
The petrophysical analysis indicates a
narrow 8-12% porosity range while permeability ranges from 0.01 to 100 md.
Fig.1 shows core porosity-permeability cross plot of the entire reservoir
section including all facies in different
wells. The core data indicate a cloud of
points with an undefined trend, so that

The densityNMR cross plot
is superior to the
density-neutron
cross plot for detection and evaluation of gas shaly
sands. This superiority is due to the
effect of thermal
neutron absorbers
in shaly sands on
neutron porosities
that cause too high
neutron porosity
readings. As a result, neutron-density logs can miss
gas zones in shaly
sands.7 On the
other hand, NMR
porosities are unaffected by shale
or rock mineralogy and therefore
the density-NMR
(DMR) technique
is more reliable
for indicating and
evaluating gas
shaly sands.

Fluid density for apparent a ϕD

is a combination between formationwater density and mud-filtrate density

Figs. 3-5 show that the results of the
ϕDMR transform applications in three
wells (A, B and C) have good matches
between ϕDMR and core porosities. As
a result, it is considered as an independent facies porosity model. These
corrected porosities can be used in conjunction with Timur-Coates equation to
estimate accurate permeabilities in gas
bearing formations.
Figs. 3-5 well logs show ϕD and
ϕDMR. Gamma ray and caliper curves are
in the first track (GR and CALI). The
second track shows depth in meters and
the third is resistivity. The fourth track
has the neutron-density logs, the fifth
track compares core, density, and ϕDMR,
the sixth track compares ϕDMR and core
porosity, the seventh track shows gas
saturations (green shadow) and water
(blue shadow), and the last track shows
core permeability in md.
The DMR method has the advantage
of avoiding the use of fluid density and

and NMR data were available over the
same reservoir interval. If we assume
core porosities equal ϕDMR, which is the
gas corrected porosity, Equation 5 can
be written as Equation 6.
The equation is linear with an intercept at B and the slope equal to A (Fig.
2).
Note that at Sgxo = 0, the pores are
completely filled with liquid (mud
filtrate and irreducible water) so that
the NMR porosity reading and densityporosity should be correct and both
should equal the core porosity. As a
result, the trend line should intersect at
a control point, where
ϕcore/ϕNMR = ϕD/ϕNMR = 1

The model is a dynamic concept of
gas movement behind the mud cake as
a result of formation permeability, gas
mobility, capillarity, and gravity forces.
Because gravity forces are constant, capillarity depends mainly on permeability
and mobility depends on permeability
and fluid viscosity that is constant for
gas. The gas reentry volume is directly a
function of permeability.

A recent prefeasibility study explored wood

significant, ready source
of second-generation
biofuels, as well as the
Alternate Fuels
opportunities for refiners
and marketers to participate with pulp and paper mills in these
biofuels projects.
The material
presented in this article derives from a
prefeasibility study
recently completed for
owners of a pulp and
paper mill. These are
the major conclusions
reached in that study:
• Cellulosic ethanol plants currently
being built are technically and economically viable.
• Partial integration of the proposed
cellulosic ethanol plant with the pulp
and paper mill was technically feasible.
• The proposed integration should
offer synergies that would reduce ethanol production costs while providing
project owners a valuable new product
stream.
• Oil industry participation in projects of this type should offer refiners
opportunities for a stable ethanol supply and ethanol price certainty while
earning a high return on investment.
• The proposed cellulosic ethanol
plant in Southeast US should compete
in the growing market for ethanol in
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast US.
The study presented many arguments
for considering partial integration of
cellulosic ethanol plants with pulp and
paper mills, 10 of which are listed in
this article:
1. Continued increasing demand for
ethanol and higher ethanol prices are
expected.
2. An adequate supply of wood
waste exists and can be used for making
ethanol.
3. Cellulosic ethanol offers advantages over corn ethanol and other
second-generation biofuels.
4. Viable cellulosic ethanol technolo-

gies exist and will shortly be available
on a commercial scale.
5. Significant synergies exist with
partial integration.
6. New government support is now
becoming available for cellulosic biofuels projects.
7. There are inherent advantages
in the use of wood waste to produce
biofuels.
8. Mills now have new opportunities for obtaining a much-needed value
stream.
9. Leading companies in the paper
industry are already undertaking biofuels initiatives.
10. The prefeasibility study findings
are positive.
This article also presents advantages
for oil companies to form joint ventures
with paper mills in cellulosic ethanol
plant projects. The three main arguments for oil industry participation in
cellulosic ethanol plant joint ventures
are:
• Investment required to fund cellulosic ethanol plants is significant; pulp
and paper mill owners will often need
equity partners.
• Petroleum refiners make good affinity partners because they have experience in liquid fuels technologies; refining process operations; and handling,
storage, and distribution of fuels.
• Petroleum products marketers
make good affinity partners because
they have an immediate and ongoing
need for ethanol, they have the infrastructure for blending and distributing 10 vol % ethanol (E10) gasoline,
and are in a better position to market
and distribute more advanced secondgeneration biofuels, if and when they
are produced.

Ethanol mandate
The Energy Independence and
Security Act of 2007, Renewable Fuels
Standards mandates production of 36
billion gal/year of renewable fuels by
2022.
A recent article (OGJ, Mar. 17, 2008,
p. 24) concluded that this mandate
would not be met. The article discussed

many obstacles that would more than
likely “bedevil” attainment of the mandate; it cites, in particular, the 21-billion gal/year of cellulosic biofuels that
will be required. It also pointed out
that wood waste could be a significant
untapped source of second-generation
biofuels raw material.

Supply of wood waste
Most of the 50 pulp and paper mills
in the US use wood waste to supplement natural gas or coal used to fuel
their boilers. They could easily divert
this wood waste to make a high-value
product such as ethanol. Many of these
mills have local access to abundant
untapped sources of wood waste that
could be used to produce cellulosic
biofuels.
These mills also have the infrastructure needed for on site preprocessing,
storage, and handling of wood waste.
All are in a position to provide supplies
of wood chips and wood waste that a

nol plants. These could produce 3.432
billion gal/year of cellulosic ethanol
(Table 1). This is quite an untapped
potential.

most biowaste feedstocks are 50%
cheaper than corn.
In addition, corn ethanol is becoming politically unsustainable. Inefficiencies in conversion of corn to fuel
have already upset other markets. The
widespread use of corn to produce
ethanol has pushed up food prices and
ethanol subsidies have again become a
political issue. Furthermore, processes
used to produce corn ethanol consume
significant amounts of water and, in
many water short corn-producing areas,
new corn ethanol plants are no longer
welcome because the public views them
as having an adverse environmental
impact.
Why not produce other advanced
biofuels?
Cellulosic ethanol has two primary
advantages over other advanced cellulosic biofuels such as methanol,
butanol, and DME.
First, there is an immediate and
growing market for ethanol; increased
demand for E10 will continue with
rising demand for gasoline. Second,
no additional investment is needed
for marketing or distribution—even
though other biofuels have higher carbon content and produce more power
than ethanol, they will require capital
investment in separate storage, transportation, and delivery infrastructure.
In addition, added investment will
be required for supporting marketing
efforts needed to obtain consumer acceptance of advanced cellulosic biofuels.
Additional investment will be needed
for making engine modifications and
for subsidies to keep advanced cellulosic
biofuels prices competitive with E10
gasoline. More importantly, there is an
increasing short-term demand for E10.
Are there better profit opportunities
in making cellulosic ethanol?
Production and sale of cellulosic
ethanol offers great potential profit opportunities. Ethanol prices are high and
are rising because they track gasoline
prices and not prices paid for feedstock
or cost of producing ethanol. The margins ethanol producers are earning are
therefore reduced by the prices paid for
56

corn by food and animal-feed producers.
In contrast, cellulosic ethanol margins will be higher and less volatile than
corn ethanol margins. First, cellulosic
ethanol yields are improving due to
technology advancements. Second,
the revenues for biowastes converted
into cellulosic ethanol are substantially
higher than revenues from converting
the same biowaste into fuel, fertilizer,
or animal feed.
Cellulosic ethanol margins could
still vary, depending on the cost of the
biowaste used, the ethanol yield from
various biowastes, and the process used
to convert biowaste into ethanol.

Viable technologies exist
Cellulosic ethanol technologies
have advanced to the point where

many are nearing commercial viability
and are available through a few existing technology providers. Two basic
technologies are effective in converting
cellulosic material into renewable liquid
transportation fuels.
The first is “two-staged thermal with
gasification”; the other is “two-staged
concentrated acid hydrolysis.” There are
many variants for each technology.
In the two-stage thermal with
gasification process, devolatization of
the wood waste occurs with controlled
high temperature and pressure in a
partial steam-reforming gasifier. Syngas
is then catalytically converted into
alcohols in distillation towers, using the

entire waste stream to produce a high
yield of biofuels, little waste, and low
levels of greenhouse gases. This process
also has a favorable (3:1) energy-balance ratio.
The two-stage concentrated acid
hydrolysis process is designed specifically to convert cellulosic feedstock into
ethanol. One version of this process was
perfected on a commercial scale and is
patented under the name Arkenol. This
process can separate cellulosic wastes
into sugar-bearing and nonsugar-bearing components to extract the sugars
and obtain ethanol using fermentation.
The Arkenol process is most efficient
when the cellulose content of the cellulosic material is at least 75%, allowing
for a high recovery of the sugar-bearing
cellulose and hemicellulose components, leaving behind less nonsugarbearing lignin. This technology is
proven and has been used in making
ethanol from municipal solid waste,
agricultural waste, and, on a limited
scale, wood waste. Better enzymes are
now being developed to improve the
sugar fermentation process and increase
ethanol yield.
In addition, there appears to be significant economies of scale associated
with Arkenol processes (Table 2). Our
feasibility study findings showed that
the most economical partially integrated Arkenol plant would be medium
sized because the feedstock requirement
could be met using 100% wood waste
(Table 3).

Partial-integration synergies
Our prefeasibility study showed
that partial integration could reduce
the direct cost of producing ethanol by
about 8¢/gal. These direct cost savings
are attributable to:
• Using the mill’s infrastructure to
procure pulping wood and wood waste,
to preprocess it into chips, and to store
and handle it before processing.
• Using the mill’s procurement
department to obtain and an additional
wood waste stream at a lower cost.
• Using an ethanol plant site that
was provided to plant operators on a

rent-free basis by the mills’ owners.
• Obtaining environmental permitting through the mill owners at no cost.
• Using other mill infrastructure,
such as storage areas for liquid and dry
bulk, rail sidings, and port access, at no
cost.
• Accessing and using mill wastetreatment facilities without cost.
• Low-cost electric power provided
from the mill’s cogeneration facilities.
• Using the mill’s excess steam at no
cost.
The partial-integration scheme
required mill owners to provide a
limited up-front investment of about $1
million, and ongoing partial integration support at a low cost or no cost for
at least 5 years. This partial-integration
support was worth $2.1 million/year
for a midsized plant and was capitalized
over 5 years, giving mill owners a 27%
equity interest in the project.
The prefeasibility study indicated
that a value stream from a mid-sized
plant would substantially supplement
mill earnings, allowing mill owners to
recover $2/year for every $1 invested
(Table 3).

New government support
The DOE’s Renewable Fuels Loan
Guarantee Program offers low-cost
federal loans, coguaranteed by DOE, to
developers of cellulosic ethanol plants.
Eligible borrowers can borrow up to
$250 million for each qualified “Renewable Fuel Facility.”
The project must however also use
“new or significantly improved technology,” and the project design must
be “validated through operation of a
continuous process pilot facility with
annual output of at least 50,000 gal of
ethanol (or other advanced biofuels).”
Assuming that the mill owner and
other equity partners in a joint venture
could qualify as eligible borrowers, a
project involving the partial integration
of a pulp and paper mill to a cellulosic
ethanol plant would qualify for DOE
loan guarantees, because such a project
would offer a significant improvement
in technology.

Those participating in partially
integrated ethanol plants are eligible
for Section 126 grants. These grants
are available to project contractors for
equipment used in gathering, preprocessing, and transporting biomass
to cellulosic ethanol plants. The grant
should help offset added costs of obtaining forest residue and other wood
wastes that are often too costly to
gather, separate, clean, and grind for delivery to the mill as an auxiliary boiler
fuel. With such grants, such wood
waste could be specifically obtained as
an economic feedstock.

ethanol is wood waste and wood chips,
not municipal solid waste (MSW) or
agricultural waste. MSW has its own set
of problems—one is the assumption
that cellulosic ethanol plants can obtain
MSW from landfill operators at no cost.
Cellulosic ethanol plant operators
often have to pay for presorting and
preprocessing before the MSW can be
used as a feedstock. Furthermore, the
cellulosic content of MSW is not always

uniform, nor are continuous supplies
guaranteed, which could create operating problems.
Likewise, although agriwaste is a
good source of cellulosic material, it
also has problems. First, outside of the
Corn Belt, only a few cellulosic ethanol
plants are being designed to use these
materials because collection, storage,
and preprocessing is costly.
Agriwastes are more costly if they
have to be gathered and transported
over long distances to an ethanol plant.
There is a lack of infrastructure for
efficiently collecting and processing
large quantities of wheat straw, switch
grass, and rice straw, so that they can
be efficiently transported in sufficient
quantities to cellulosic ethanol plants.
Furthermore, much of this agriwaste is
now used in farming as a natural fertilizer, or as an animal feed, making its
availability sometimes limited and more
expensive.
Conversely, there is an abundant
supply of wood waste to exploit; pulp
and paper mills are already set up to
acquire additional supplies of wood
waste. These waste materials are logging
residue, such as treetops, thinnings
(precommercial biomass), as well as
sawmill and lumberyard wastes; they
can supply “resident” cellulosic ethanol
plants with their cellulosic feedstock
requirements (Table 1).
Because they represent materials that
mills do not currently use, their acquisition should not push up prices mills
pay for their wood basket.

New value stream
Participation in cellulosic ethanol
projects by the US paper industry may
be critical to survival of many of their
pulp and paper mills, particularly those
that face direct competition from paper
product imports. This has increased the
volatility and erosion of profit margins
earned by many US pulp and paper
manufacturers.
There are only a few ways to stop
this erosion. Mill owners must keep
their pulping and paper manufacturing processes going because it is much

more costly to shut down than it is to
build up inventories, or liquidate excess
inventory at discounts. Mills that shut
down also run the risk of losing reliable
supplies of pulpwood and they may
have to buy their way back into the
wood supply chain when supplies are
again needed.
Curtailment in pulping and papermaking is not a good short-term
option. Increasing pulping and papermaking capacity to meet short-term
pulp and paper demand will not work
either, because this is a longer-term
option.
Our prefeasibility study showed that
earnings and cash flows that a mill can
earn by participating in a resident cellulosic ethanol plant, would go a long
way to offset erosion in profit margins
in cyclical downturns and will significantly improve profits when margins
from mill operations are at sustainable
levels (Table 3).

Paper company initiatives
Many major paper companies have
initiated programs to make biofuels
from wood waste. Several paper companies are developing the capability to
make cellulosic ethanol and view such
participation as an immediate business
opportunity. They are willing to bet that
available technology is commercially
viable.
There are some who are taking a
longer-term view and are not starting
cellulosic ethanol projects. Instead, they
are investing in research and development, often in joint-venture partnerships with major energy companies, to
develop technologies to make a wide
range of advanced biofuels.
There are other mill owners that are
still taking a wait-and-see approach
because they are uncertain if they have
mills that could host resident biofuels
plants. And there are those that are still
uncertain as to the future of biofuels
and their ability to participate successfully in producing and marketing
biofuels.

Prefeasibility study ﬁndings
We conducted our prefeasibility
study at the request of a struggling
pulp and paper mill. The mill manager
was specifically interested in determining whether significant additional cash
flows could be generated through partial integration of the mill to a resident
cellulosic ethanol plant. The prefeasibility study findings identified significant
additional cash flows.
We expected favorable study results
for the proposed project because:
• The mill was near a port with rail
access and close to abundant untapped
supplies of wood waste.
• The proposed resident plant was
strategically located to serve Petroleum
Administration for Defense District
(PADD) 1 markets.
• The mill site was big enough to
accommodate the ethanol plant.
• Mill owners agreed to provide
timely environmental permitting.
• Mill engineers validated the fact
that there was enough excess boiler
capacity to supply steam to the ethanol
plant at a low cost.
• Mill owners agreed to provide the
ethanol plant with waste treatment,
water, and cogenerated power needs at
little or no cost.
Furthermore, the mill’s wood-procurement department confirmed that
they could deliver at least 1,000 dry
tons/day of preprocessed wood waste
to the ethanol plant at a low cost, while
providing storage and handling. Mill
owners were also willing to consider a
$1 million investment in infrastructure
upgrades to provide partial-integration
support during a 5-year period valued
at $10.4 million, in return for 27%
equity in the ethanol plant.
Mill owners were also willing to
coguarantee ethanol plant debt, or
provide direct debt financing, if needed.
The major conclusion of the prefeasibility study was that the proposed resident cellulosic ethanol plant would be
economically viable based on expectations that ethanol prices would be high
enough, the demand for ethanol strong
enough, and the costs in making etha-

nol low enough to assure high earnings, cash flows, and return on invested
capital (Table 3).

Oil industry participation
A medium (1,000 dry tons/day) cellulosic ethanol plant based on Arkenol
technology can produce 22.1 million
gal/year of ethanol and costs about
$142 million, or $6.41/gal. Assuming
70% debt financing, $42.5 million in
equity financing is needed.
If the mill agreed to acquire 27%
of the equity in the project for $11.5
million, given the proposed partial-integration scheme used in the study, only
$1.1 million is left as a direct investment and the rest is contributed as the
value for partial-integration support
during the first 5 years.
In this case, the host mill would have
to seek a partner willing to contribute
the remaining $31 million for a 73%
interest in the plant. Most mills are not
in a position to make large cash investments in facilities that are not part of
their core business (Tables 2 and 3).
Clearly, if the partial-integration approach to developing cellulosic biofuels
plants is exploited to its fullest, many
affinity investors in cellulosic ethanol
plants will be needed. In particular, refiners and marketers should make good
affinity investors because they have
experience in liquid fuels technologies
and in refining process operations. Their
personnel already possess the skills
needed to operate processes similar to
those used for cellulosic ethanol.
Refinery workers are trained in quality-control procedures and in storage,
transportation, and blending operations.
With respect to producing advanced
cellulosic biofuels, the technology is
similar to those in petroleum refining, and that knowledge can be used
if cellulosic ethanol plants are to be
upgraded to produce synthetic motor
fuels such as DME.
Refined products marketers that
are not refiners would also make ideal
affinity investors because they have
an immediate and ongoing need for
ethanol and have the infrastructure for

blending and distributing E10 gasoline.
They are often in a better position to
market and distribute more advanced
second-generation biofuels, if and
when they are produced.
When refiners and marketers partner
with owners of a pulp and paper mill
in projects of this type, the combined
attributes of these partners reduces each
participant’s equity requirements, increases return on investment potential,
and spreads project risk.
Such partnerships can also be
profitable. In our prefeasibility study,
we determined that the direct cost to
produce ethanol was less than $1/
gal and that after-tax income could be
more than 50¢/gal. The project would
also generate more than $24 million/

year in cash flow on a revenue stream of
$50 million.
The affinity investor’s 73% share of
cash flow is more than $18 million/
year, resulting in an average return on
its $31 million equity of 58%/year.

Participating in such a project could
benefit refiners and marketers of ethanol blends. And resale of other secondgeneration biofuels may offer even
more promising returns (Table 3). ✦

Digital data and computing technology already address a wide range
of issues in pipeline construction and
inspection. These include mapping of
the pipeline route, tracking material
inventory, monitoring pipelay progress,
organization of quality control data
(including weld inspection), and generation of periodic project-monitoring
and management reports. Removing test
personnel from near the pipeline being
tested will also reduce the possibility
of accidental injury should the pipeline
fail.
The immediate technological,
data-quality, and economic effects of
monitoring hydrotest parameters in the
same manner manifest themselves in a
number of ways. The pipeline operator
no longer needs to rely on field representatives who may or may not have the
authority to accept the measurements as
accurate. Direct transmission of digital
data to a centralized control center also

SUBSEA TIEBACK FORUM & EXHIBITION

THE DEEPEST SHOW ON EARTH
March 3 - 5, 2009
Henry B. Gonzales Convention Center | San Antonio, TX

SUBSEA TIEBACK
FORUM & EXHIBITION

PennWell invites you to the 9th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition. SSTB has become the premier
event for one of the fastest growing field development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March
3 – 5, 2009 in San Antonio, TX at the Henry B. Gonzales Convention Center. Over 2,000 people and 150
exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference. You can’t afford to miss it.
This year’s theme is “The Deepest Show On Earth.” As our industry changes, the sharing of knowledge and
collective experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety, and economics of the
subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by industry leaders. As in the
past, only by participating in this conference will you be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will
not be published and no Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room stays inside the conference
room. We hope you will join us.

though the world had just now begun running out of oil, which it has been doing for
a long time. The problem is wide variation
in interpretation of the phrase “running out
of oil.”
Serious and learned observers believe
global oil production soon will peak and
quickly begin a steep decline.
Others, equally serious and learned
except to those holding opposing views,
see a peak and decline of less-alarming imminence and rate.
There’s enough uncertainty here to
suggest that peak oil, whatever that means,
should not move markets on any given day.
What’s certain, by virtue of price trends,
is that supply can’t rise as fast as demand
seems inclined to expand. Less certain is
whether the constraint is mostly geologic
or mostly logistical.
Geologic constraint is evident in shrinking average sizes of oil discoveries and
growth in production from high-cost realms
such as very deep water and unconventional resources.
Migration to increasingly troublesome
geology and operating environments is not
the same as resource exhaustion, which
is the legitimately alarming though hardly
imminent interpretation some observers
give peak oil. Global reserves are, by most
estimates, increasing.
Logistical constraint is manifest in industry operating rates near capacity levels
and project starts delayed by shortages of
workers and materials. Both types of constraint raise ﬁnding and production costs.
Inevitably, the higher costs raise prices of
oil products in a process that can make
politics an impediment to supply.
Assertive supply limits deserve concern,
not panic. The end of oil production isn’t
near—just nearer than it was yesterday.

Politicians ponder price peak
The July contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes traded above $135/bbl
on the New York Mercantile Exchange just prior to the May 26 Memorial Day holiday
that marked the unofﬁcial start of the summer driving season in the US.
With oil prices setting record highs almost daily, some developing countries
such as Indonesia and India are having trouble maintaining fuel subsidies for their
citizens. As a result, gasoline prices were expected to increase 20% in India and up to
30% in Indonesia. In an election year in the US, however, politicians are pressuring
everyone from US oil companies to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production, which they hope will lower retail prices for gasoline,
diesel, and fuel oil, thereby encouraging US consumers to consume more.
In an attempt to show constituents they are taking action against rising prices,
the US House passed legislation to stretch US antitrust laws to include members of
OPEC. Critics claim targeting OPEC investments in the US as a source of damage
awards in such cases could trigger an embargo of oil to the US.
Meanwhile, the Senate Judiciary Committee rounded up the “usual suspects”—
executives from ExxonMobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Shell Oil Co., BP America, and
ConocoPhillips—for a televised verbal ﬂogging. The next day, a House panel took its
turn at berating oil executives. But even as the public and politicians bashed the “excess proﬁts” of oil companies, Jacques H. Rousseau, an analyst at Soleil-Back Bay
Research, noted per-share prices of many publicly traded reﬁning ﬁrms have fallen
by an average of 50% since mid-2007 (vs. a 7% decline in the S&P 500) due primary
to weak demand for gasoline and other reﬁned products. “Poor fundamentals have
reduced earnings and cash ﬂow for all reﬁners, especially the companies that cannot
process a signiﬁcant amount of heavy and sour crude oils,” Rousseau said.
Industry representatives and some politicians are pushing a reluctant Congress
to open areas of the US now off-limits for oil and gas drilling. “Democrats argue
that drilling the potential reserves on and offshore won’t necessarily ease pressure
on prices,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
“New technology and drilling techniques have made the process much more environmentally friendly, but other critics would rather push alternative fuel usage.”
Certainly the escalation of oil prices did not halt after Saudi Arabia said it is
increasing its oil production a “sufﬁcient” 300,000 b/d to 9.45 million b/d in June in
response to customers’ requests. That’s largely because demand is still growing in
China, which reported an eight-fold year-over-year increase in April diesel imports.
In the wake of the recent severe earthquake, China’s demand for diesel for electricity generation has escalated sharply, boosting energy prices and causing a global
shortage.
Market factors
Disagreements over the cause of the energy price spikes continue. Former oilman T. Boone Pickens—now chairman of BP Capital LLC in Dallas—predicted crude
futures will hit $150/bbl this year because producers are running out of oil. (Goldman Sachs Group Inc. earlier said crude costs could escalate to $150-200/bbl within 2
years. Such predictions are “more like bull’s-eyes than forecasts,” giving the “herd”
of traders new targets to aim for, said analysts with Pritchard Capital Partners LLC,
New Orleans).
In a televised interview, Jeroen van der Veer Royal, chief executive of Royal
Dutch Shell PLC, said market perceptions rather than short supplies are pushing
prices. “There are no tankers waiting in the Middle East, there are no cars waiting at
gasoline stations because they are out of stock. This has to do with psychology in the
markets, and you cannot forecast psychology,” he said. US Treasury Secretary Henry
Paulson blamed both tight supplies and growing global demand, rather than market
speculators.
The International Energy Agency is attempting an independent assessment of the
world’s 400 largest oil ﬁelds by November. But it’s already indicating crude supplies
may be tighter than currently expected, especially in coming years. The Paris-based
agency sees a likely shortfall of 12.5 million b/d between capacity additions and
incremental demand by 2015.
Meanwhile, there are growing signs that high oil prices are affecting the US
economy. Ford Motor Co. said it likely will not return to proﬁtability in 2009 with the
sharp drop in sales of gas-guzzling pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. The US
Federal Highway Administration reported trafﬁc volume on all US roads and streets
in February, the latest available ﬁgures, was at the lowest level since 2004.

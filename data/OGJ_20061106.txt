Students battle simulated process-plant fires as part of extensive
training at the Brayton Fire Training Field at the Texas Engineering
Extension Service, College Station.TEEX is one of the best-equipped
and staffed facilities in the US for such training, according to
one of the articles in Oil & Gas Journal’s exclusive HSE Report
that begins on p. 37. Another article reports on a US government
survey of off site commercial disposal practices, methods, and costs
in major oil and gas producing states; a third reports on a plan to
lower automotive accident rates and associated losses for a service
company’s Qatar oil field operations. (Photograph from TEEX)

100% Compliance

You aim for full compliance with the
newly modified specifications of the EPA
regulations? You expect outstanding
performance from your drilling fluids?
You prefer safer drilling in the interest of
people, equipment and the environment?

The answer: Vegetable esters.
Unique ecological and toxicological
properties make the difference: Vegetable
esters have dramatically reduced the
impact of drilling fluids on the marine
environment. They allow the oil and gas
exploration industry to comply with
regulatory directions. Vegetable esters
are obtained from renewable resources.
So they ensure excellent biodegradability

of drilling fluids, both aerobically and
anaerobically. Seafloor surveys and
ongoing toxicity testing with various
marine species have confirmed the
esters’ environmentally benign properties. This enables companies to avoid
long-term environmental liabilities and
promote their corporate image.
Ester-based drilling fluids demonstrate
high reliability under extreme conditions. They perform perfectly in the
harshest environments. Formulated
ester-based drilling fluids remain fully
pumpable during drilling operations in
very deep and cold water. At the other
end of the scale, specially designed
vegetable ester fluids will remain stable

even at temperatures above 350° F.
Ester-based drilling fluids can be tailormade to satisfy your most demanding
needs. They can be used straight and
in a broad spectrum of blends at any
ratio, thus meeting technical specifications while complying with local permit
requirements.

You can recognize ester-based
drilling fluids by the EQ Emblem.
The original Ester Quality standards are a benchmark for future
drilling fluids.

Shell platforms siege ended in Niger Delta
Nigerian villagers who took over three Royal Dutch Shell PLC
oil platforms in the Niger Delta Oct. 25 agreed to end their siege
and allow operations to resume.
Shell said members of the Kula community living near the
Ekulama 1, Ekulama 2, and Belema oil pumping stations invaded the facilities, accusing Shell of failing to meet the terms of an
agreement to provide them aid.
The villagers were persuaded to leave the facilities after intervention by the Rivers State government in charge of the area. Shell
officials also confirmed that an agreement was reached with the
protesters to quit the facilities.
Shell said the company planned to reopen the platforms immediately following the departure of the villagers. The spokesman said
no hostages had been taken.

ExxonMobil, CNPC ink Sakhalin-1 gas preaccord
ExxonMobil Corp. has signed a preliminary agreement on principles with China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) for the supply
of natural gas from the Russian Sakhalin-1 project.
An ExxonMobil spokesman said the agreement, which defines the
obligations of both parties and the principles of price formation, calls
for gas to be delivered to northeastern China, but he did not identify
the quantities involved, pricing, or when deliveries would begin.
The deal resulted from a November 2004 memorandum of understanding, and the representative said the preliminary document
is expected to lead to an official agreement.
Earlier, ExxonMobil said it is ready to deliver 8 billion cu m/
year of gas to China.
Currently, gas is delivered in small amounts, as much as 1 billion cu m, to enterprises in Russia’s Khabarovsk territory.

ratify the Energy Charter on cooperation with Europe, which his
country entered 10 years ago.
At a press conference after an informal dinner with the heads
of the 25 European Union states in Lahti, Finland, Putin called for
changes to parts of the charter involving access to gas and oil pipelines. He voiced concern about spot deliveries.
Putin said he wants Russia to become integral to the European
gas market and advocated interdependence between his country
and the EU as the only way to secure “demand security.”
Russia raised alarms in Europe about supply security last winter
when it curtailed deliveries to Ukraine, a transit country for pipeline supplies to Europe, in a price dispute.
“Russia is more dependent on the EU today than the other way
around,” Putin said.
On Russia’s decision to develop Shtokman gas-condensate field
in the Barents Sea alone, Putin said, “Gazprom had analyzed the
proposals of foreign companies and decided it was not happy with
them. But it does not mean Russia rejects cooperation with foreign
partners (OGJ, Oct. 16, 2006, p. 20).” He said foreign companies
could be involved as “coexecutives, to solve management issues as
well as technical implementation.”

FERC streamlines rules on gas from LNG

The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission broadened its
rules on natural gas projects eligible to proceed without a specific,
case-by-case FERC authorization.
On Oct. 19, FERC approved a final rule expanding blanket certificate eligibility for projects at storage facilities, pipelines, and facilities to transport gas from LNG receiving terminals.
Blanket certificates are granted to companies already having
FERC project approval. These certificates allow companies to improve or upgrade facilities or build new facilities without case-bySakhalin-2 status decision due in late November case certificate authorization.
Russia’s Natural Resources Minister Yuri Trutnev said Nov. 1 that

Development

Spar planned for Perdido ﬁelds in deep gulf
Shell Offshore Inc. and partners will install a production spar in
what Shell says will be a world record water depth to develop three
oil fields along the Perdido fold belt in the Gulf of Mexico.
It will moor the regional direct-vertical-access spar in 8,000 ft
of water to handle production from Great White, Tobago, and Silvertip fields in the Alaminos Canyon area (see map, OGJ, Sept. 25,
2006, p. 36). Production from other fields in the region can be tied
in as processing capacity becomes available.
The spar will be able to handle production of 100,000 b/d of
oil and 200 MMscfd of gas, expected to begin “at the turn of the
decade,” according to Shell. It will have subsea lifting or boosting
to move produced fluids from the seafloor to topsides.
The common processing hub, on Alaminos Canyon Block 857
near the Great White discovery, will have a drilling and completion
rig and will gather, process, and transport production from wet
trees as far away as 30 miles. Pipelines from the facility will connect
to undisclosed locations in Texas.
The area has water depths of 7,500-10,000 ft and a rugged
seabed. Marvin Odum, Shell executive vice-president, EP Americas, said the project will initiate production from the gulf’s Lower
Tertiary play.
Shell will operate the hub, called Perdido Regional Host, with
a 35% interest. Other interests are Chevron Corp., 37.5%, and BP
PLC, 27.5%.
Shell also operates the fields identified for development, none of
which have had production tests. The reservoirs have temperatures
of 150-200º F. and pressures of 5,000-9,000 psi. They produce oil
of 20-40º gravity.
Shell has drilled five wells in Great White field, discovered in
2002 by a well that reached 14,405 ft TVD in 8,009 ft of water. The
most recent Great White well was spudded in March 2004.
Shell holds 33.34% interest in Great White, which is on Alaminos Canyon Blocks 812, 813, 814, 857, 900, and 901. Chevron
and BP hold 33.33% each.
Tobago field lies in 9,600 ft of water on Alaminos Canyon
859. Unocal Corp. discovered it in 2004 with a well that reached
18,510 ft TD (OGJ, May 10, 2004, Newsletter). A sidetrack reached
18,425 ft. Tobago interests are Shell 32.5%, Chevron 57.5%, and
Nexen 10%.
Chevron made the Silvertip discovery on Alaminos Canyon Block
815 with the AC 815 No. 1 well, drilled to 14,778 ft TD in 9,200 ft
of water in August 2004. Chevron holds 60% and Shell, 40%.

BP has 11th oil strike on Angola Block 31
BP Exploration (Angola) PLC and state-owned Sonangol have
discovered oil for the 11th time in ultradeepwater Block 31 off
Angola.
The GlobalSantaFe Corp. Jack Ryan drillship drilled the Titania
well in 2,152 m of water 23 km northwest of the Hebe oil discovery, announced in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Titania reached a TD of 5,339 m below sea level, penetrating
Oligo-Miocene sands. It’s Block 31’s second subsalt discovery.
Titania flowed on test at the rate of 2,045 b/d through a 20⁄64-in.
choke.
A BP spokesman told OGJ that a front-end engineering and design contract might be let by yearend for development of Block
31’s first four discoveries, which are in the northeast part. “We
don’t know when production would begin,” he added.
The other seven discoveries, including Titania, are in the southeast part of the block. BP is considering development options.
Block 31 covers 5,349 sq km and lies in 1,500-2,500 m of
water.
BP is the operator with a 26.67% interest. Other interests are
Sonangol 20%, Esso Exploration & Production Angola (Block 31)
Ltd. 25%, Statoil Angola AS 13.33%, Marathon International Petroleum Angola Block 31 Ltd. 10%, and TEPA (Block 31) Ltd., a
subsidiary of Total SA, 5%.

RWE Dea makes oil ﬁnd in Libya
Germany’s RWE Dea AG made an oil discovery with its A1-NC
193 well drilled in Libya’s Sirte basin 500 km southeast of Tripoli.
The well, drilled to 4,214 ft with the Arab Drilling & Workover
Co. Adwoc Rig 2, intersected the Paleocene Dahra formation and,
on test, flowed 35º gravity oil at 410 b/d through a 32⁄64-in. choke.
The A1-NC-193 well is the first in a 10-well minimum drilling
campaign in six RWE Dea licenses—NC 193, 194, 195, 196, 197,
and 198. The drilling program, which will use as many as three
drilling rigs, follows a comprehensive seismic acquisition campaign in which 3,200 line-km of 2D and 2,400 sq km of 3D data
were acquired in the identified licenses.
The rig is being moved to drill the next location—B1-NC 193.

Saudi Aramco has let a front-end engineering and design (FEED)
and project management services contract to two units of Foster
Wheeler Ltd. for development of offshore Manifa oil and gas field.
The field will produce 900,000 b/d of Arab Heavy crude (OGJ,
Oct. 16, 2006, Newsletter).

Energen Corp., Birmingham, Ala., sold to Chesapeake Energy
Corp., Oklahoma City, a 50% interest in its lease position in various
shale plays in Alabama for cash and a carried drilling interest.
The two companies also agreed to form an area of mutual interest to focus on the further exploration and development of the
shale plays throughout Alabama.
Energen Resources received $75 million cash from Chesapeake
for half interest in Energen’s existing 200,000 net acre shale lease
position. Chesapeake will pay the first $15 million of Energen’s
share of drilling costs.
The companies will partner 50-50 on new lease acquisitions,
development, and operations in the AMI for at least the next 10
years.
Energen said it is Alabama’s largest producer of onshore gas, has
extensive knowledge of coalbed methane and other tight formations, and has extensive geological expertise in the state.
Chesapeake said the deal “accomplishes our goal of building a
significant leasehold position in every major shale play east of the
Rockies.”
The Oklahoma City company owns 4.25 million net acres of
prospective shale leasehold onshore in the US, which it believes is

industry’s largest shale leasehold position.

Barnett shale play to grow in Arlington
Two Fort Worth independent operators reached agreement with
the city council of Arlington, Tex., on lease terms covering acreage
under Lake Arlington and other tracts in the vicinity.
The agreement with Quicksilver Resources Inc. and private Marshall R.Young Oil Co. call for the city to receive a 27.7% royalty and
$11,777/acre bonus payment.
The lease covers 1,442.6 net acres of city-owned minerals under Lake Arlington, which overlies 2,250 surface acres in Tarrant
County between Fort Worth and Arlington.
When added to acreage the companies previously acquired,
Quicksilver and Young will hold 4,800 net acres at 75% average
net revenue interest and $5,400/acre average bonus. The acreage
could provide as many as 75 development locations that Quicksilver said enhance its plans “for increasing natural gas production
and reserves from the Barnett shale in the Fort Worth basin.”
Quicksilver will operate the lease and own 75% working interest. The city adopted a gas drilling and production ordinance on
Dec. 20, 2005. ✦

Production

Contractors work to stem mud ﬂow in East Java
Santos Ltd. reported that Boots & Coots International Well Control Inc. has started drilling a relief well near the Banja-Panji-1 gas
well in Sidoarjo, East Java.
Mud began flowing on May 29 about 200 m from the Banjaa
Panji 1 well, drilled to 2,833 m. The mud continues to flow at an
estimated 100,000 cu m/day.
The mud flow, which involves hydrogen sulfide, has inundated at least eight villages, displaced thousands of villagers, ruined
crops, and cut off roads.
Banjar Panji 1 targets Miocene Kujung formation reefal carbonates on the eastern margin of Wunut gas field, which produces
from Pleistocene volcaniclastic sand.
The underground blowout occurred at about 2,700 m, just
above a high-pressure water zone. A total of 1,000 acres reportedly
was under several meters of mud.
A group of international contractors, including Boots & Coots,
spudded a relief well about 500 m south-southwest of the Banjar
Panji. A second relief well is planned from the north-northwest.
Santos refuses to discuss the possible cause of the well’s blowout
because of an investigation being conducted by BPMigas, Indonesia’s oil and gas regulator.
Well operator Lapindo Brantas Inc. initially blamed the mud
flow on an earthquake in central Java, but the National Disaster
Study Centre reported the earthquake barely affected east Java.
Lapindo estimates the total costs for drilling relief wells and
mud management to be $180 million, which “includes assumptions and may require further adjustment when estimates relating
to the cost of long-term mud disposal options, proposed cost of infrastructure relocation, and costs relating to unrealized third-party
claims are known,” Lapindo said in a statement.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

“With the [mud] flow continuing, the complexity of the event,
and the dynamic nature of the ongoing work, it is not possible to
accurately estimate a total rectification cost at this time,” the company said.
Lapindo has 50% interest in the Brantas production-sharing
contract. Partners are PT Medco E&P Brantas, with 32% interest,
and Santos Brantas Pty. Ltd., 18% interest.

Statoil begins production via new subsea template
Statoil ASA on Oct. 18 began production from one of the two
wells tied in to the subsea K Template recently installed in Norne
oil field in the Norwegian Sea.
The four-slot seabed K template is a typical subsea satellite development tied in to existing infrastructure (OGJ, July 18, 2005,
p. 42).
Terje Overvik, executive vice-president for exploration and production Norway, said production from the new subsea template
will prolong the field’s life and help Statoil achieve its production
target of 1 million boe/d until 2015 from the Norwegian continental shelf.
With the 750 million kroner investment in the Norne improved
recovery project, which includes installation of the K template and
the drilling and completion of two wells, Statoil expects to recover
10 million bbl of oil.
Production from the other well, which is to be commissioned
by Transocean Inc.’s Transocean Arctic semisubmersible drilling rig,
is expected to begin at the end of the same month.
The field’s development solution allows for the drilling of yet
two more wells from the K template. ✦

Processing
Lurgi building 31 biodiesel plants worldwide

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Lurgi AG reports that it currently is engineering and building
31 biodiesel plants with total capacity of more than 4.2 million
tonnes/year.
The company, a global leader in biodiesel plant construction,
received orders for seven plants during the third quarter.
Those plants, in Argentina, Malaysia, France, and Indonesia, will have
individual capacities of 100,000-250,000 tonnes/year. Their feedstocks
will be rapeseed, soybean, and palm oil, depending on location.

Research will focus on four areas:
• Understanding existing California biofuel feedstock characteristics.
• Developing additional feedstocks optimized for such features
as drought tolerance, minimal land requirements, harvesting technology.
• Production of cellulosic biofuels.
• Design and construction of a demonstration facility for biochemical and thermochemical production processes.

Chevron, UC Davis team up in biofuels research

Chevron taps Praxair for large hydrogen plant

Chevron Technology Ventures LLC plans to provide as much as
$25 million to scientists and engineers at the University of California, Davis, to develop technology for converting cellulosic biomass
into transportation fuels.
The 5-year program, which calls for research in biochemical
and thermochemical conversion, seeks to develop commercially
viable processes for the production of transportation fuels from
forest and agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, and other
renewable resources, said parent company Chevron Corp. The joint
research effort will coordinate with the California Biomass Collaborative (CBC) to focus on California’s renewable feedstocks such as
rice straw, an agricultural waste.
It also proposes a demonstration facility to test the commercial
readiness of the technologies.

Chevron Products Co. has completed an agreement with Praxair
Inc. for a hydrogen plant at its 240,000-b/d Richmond, Calif., refinery
that the technology provider says will be the largest it has ever built.
Praxair, Danbury, Conn., will use reformer technology and engineering and construction services of Lurgi AG for the two-train,
260-MMcfd complex.
Lurgi has engineered and built more than 25 hydrogen plants
worldwide and more than 100 steam reforming units for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or synthesis gas.
The Richmond hydrogen plant is due on stream in 2008. Praxair
will operate the facility. It will build a pipeline network to connect
the plant with the Chevron refinery and other refineries in northern California. ✦

Paul Liberato, president of Billy Pugh
since 1989, acknowledges the sparseness of numbers on crane-transfer
incidents. He doubts, however, that the
data ever will be as complete as those
covering helicopter transfers, where accidents tend to be catastrophic.
In the last 3-4 years, Liberato says,
industry interest in the safety of offshore personnel transfers has increased.
“It’s really becoming a priority,” he
notes. “We need to be serious about it.”
Liberato thinks accidents may have
increased along with interest because of
a recent surge in the number of inexperienced offshore workers.

New basket
Billy Pugh has introduced a collapsible carrier that provides some of the
protection of rigid frames such as the
Frog. Called the X-904, the new device
allows riders to stand and hold onto
ropes. But it adds protection against falling objects with an overhead shield and
against side impacts with outer cables
that stiffen when tension is applied to
a central pole. Riders attach themselves
to the X-904 with quick-release safety
clips. The bottom has springs.
Billy Pugh wanted its follow-on
design to “look and perform much
like a personnel net” because offshore
workers “like the current personnel net
and don’t want to change.” The web site
points out, however, that many large oil
companies are trying to reduce the human factor in safety management.
Without question, the human factor
figures prominently in any system—
whatever its safety record—whose
defining feature is the need to hold on
for dear life. ✦

Energy and US elections
Yes, Nancy Pelosi has argued for a windfall
profit tax on oil companies. Yes, that position
reflects misunderstanding of US energy needs.
And, yes, the California Democrat will become
speaker if her party wins control of the House of
Representatives in this week’s general election. But
no, Democratic takeover of the House and, maybe,
Senate wouldn’t mean ruin for US energy.
Republicans have controlled the House since
1995 and the Senate most of the time since then.
They’ve controlled the White House since 2001.
Has Congress approved leasing of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain? No. Has it
dismantled hurdles to leasing of the Outer Continental Shelf off the East and West Coasts and in the
Gulf of Mexico off Florida? No. Although proposals have come and go, there’s still no leasing. So
Republicans have dominated US politics to varying
degrees for a decade but haven’t managed to
implement either of the two most important steps
the US government can take on energy supply.

Supply steps?
It hasn’t been all bad with Republicans. There
have been some improvements to taxation of
domestic producers and to leasing and permitting
of onshore federal acreage. And the Republican
administration has tried to clarify the confusion
into which its predecessor threw refiners by retrospectively reinterpreting the Clean Air Act’s New
Source Review program.
But the need for big energy-supply steps and
the inescapably large involvement of hydrocarbons should have become clear. With one qualified
exception, no such step has been taken.
The exception is passage of the Deepwater Royalty Relief Act of 1995, which fostered an industry
that now represents the principal growth area for
US oil and gas supply. While enactment came after
Republicans claimed Congress, the political work
got done before the power change. Without the
sponsorship of former Democratic Sen. J. Bennett
Johnston of Louisiana and support—which took a
while to materialize—of the Democratic Clinton
administration, this most important energy-supply
move since price decontrol wouldn’t have occurred.
Republicans can claim no such triumph of their
own. In fact, under the Republicans, energy policy
has degenerated into a competition for taxpayer

funding of marginal energy forms.
Bush has set the regrettable tone for this with
his optimistic push for hydrogen vehicle fuel,
declaration that his country is addicted to oil,
and repeated calls to move the US away from oil.
Sensible Republicans in the congressional leadership could have given these ambitions helpful
perspective by asking how much it all might cost.
But House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and
Senate Majority Bill Frist of Tennessee have been
too busy calling, hand-in-hand with their Democratic colleagues, for investigations into gasoline
“price-gouging.”
With energy, Republicans have renounced
markets. They have abandoned the only ideological
platform from which they can do legitimate battle
with the state-centered energy fantasies normally
associated with the other party. So energy policy
has become a catalog of political wishes, marketed
under the delusion of energy independence.
Democratic takeover of at least the House
would help clarify beliefs about what’s sensible
and what’s not in energy policy. And it would
force the oil and gas industry, acting in self-defense, to withdraw from the cannibalistic power
cycle of political incumbency and embrace a new
constituency.
The industry’s constituency should be energy consumers. As has been argued here before,
that group gets little attention when politicians
and regulators begin promoting—which means
throwing public money at—exotic fuels for gauzy
reasons. When this happens, consumers, who also
are taxpayers, get stuck with sneaky bills for hopeless energy programs.

Limiting damage
The oil and gas industry can limit the damage
by making consumer interests its political priority. It should support no energy proposal and
accept no political compromise that raises private
or public costs without producing certain and
measurable benefit. Consumer protection is a void
in modern energy politics. Filling it represents an
opportunity.
So here’s a practice question: If Pelosi becomes
speaker of the House, why should energy consumers resist the proposal she probably will make for a
windfall profit tax on oil? ✦

There were two leaders in Soviet
history who were strongly influenced
by specific national achievements. For
Joseph Stalin, it was the victory over
Nazi Germany in 1945 and the first test
of a nuclear bomb in 1949. For Nikita
Khrushchev, success came with the
launch of Sputnik in 1957 and the first
human space flight by Yuri Gagarin in
1961.

also criticized Stalin’s obsession with
the military industry and his disregard
for the miserable state of the Soviet
economy and standard of living.
Khrushchev, however, would later
follow Stalin’s lead. The launch of Sputnik I, the world’s first artificial satellite,
in 1957 explained why, despite Russia’s
weak economy, he challenged the US
by installing missile bases in Cuba in
1961, setting the world on the brink of
nuclear war. As in Stalin’s case, as soon
as the members of the Politburo ousted
Khrushchev in 1964, they criticized his
foreign and economic policies.

was emboldened to take control of
Eastern Europe in 1946-47, triggering
the Cold War. The same assertiveness
fueled the dangerous Berlin crisis in
1948 when American and Soviet tanks
squared off. A few years later in June
1950, Stalin encouraged or at least
permitted Kim Il-sung to trigger a “hot
war” in Korea.
After Stalin’s death in 1953, members of his Politburo, who had watched
helplessly as the country moved toward
a major conflict in the last years of
Stalin’s rule, signaled to the West that

was based, not on advancements in
technology or industry, as was the case
in Soviet Russia, but on the growing
world demand for and price of oil.
In 2006, oil and gas made up 71%
of Russia’s total exports. All prognoses about the future of the Russian
economy were based on forecasts of the
price of oil. Experts have ascribed the
slackening of economic growth in the
last 2 years to the decline in the rate of
oil industry growth, which declined to
2.5% in 2006 from 11% in 2003.
What is more, nobody wanted to

living that had existed in 1991. There
was some growth in real income in the
country, but the population was mostly
dissatisfied with the standard of living.
According to data released in May from
Moscow’s nongovernmental public
opinion-market research firm Levada
Analytical Center, half the population
saw “poverty and social inequality” as
major national problems, and almost as
many did not believe that “the leadership can improve life in the country in
the near future.”
Recently “deindustrialization”—the
decline of industries based on contemporary technology—became a key
subject in the discussion on Russia’s
economic future. The term was used by
Russian Alliance of Entrepreneurs Chairman Alexander Shokhin and several
other major Russian business people, as
well as by foreign experts.1
Businesses and individuals increasingly have refused to buy Russian
durable goods. As famous Russian
economist Nikolai Petrakov suggested
in June: “Everything in Russia—roads,
communication, and big enterprises—
was built in Soviet times.” Petrakov also
suggested that the obsolescence of industrial equipment is growing. Roughly
50% of Russia’s air industry equipment
is obsolete, as is
about 70% of its
oil industry infrastructure.
Igor Gorynin, another highly regarded expert and a member of the
Russian Academy of Sciences, wrote:
“In the sphere of technological innovations, Russia is catastrophically behind
developed nations and uncompetitive in
international markets.” In addition, the
country’s agricultural industry has stagnated, and food imports during 2000-05
more than doubled. And, although the
Russian state itself has diminished its
foreign debt, corporations, including
oil and gas companies, increased their
financial obligations to foreigners by
more than six times.
By the end of Putin’s first term, the
mood in the Kremlin was subdued. Although the Kremlin could boast about

instrument that would allow Russia to
be a great power again and release it
from its inferiority complex. Inspired
by the new perspective, Narochnitskaia
suggested that Russia could serve as a
model for the world.4 The author of an
article in Komsomolskaia Pravda declared, “Russia is becoming an energy
empire” and said it has returned to
“great politics through the pipeline.”
Some Russian authors contend that
the aggressive policy of the US against
Russia is dictated exclusively by the
desire to take control of the country’s
oil resources.
Obsessed with the restoration of the
Russian empire, the notorious nationalist Alexander Prokhanov talked about
oil as the main strategic resource of the
21st Century and praised Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez, a “Russian
friend,” whose policy is also based on
oil.5 As a typical element of the political
landscape, a member of the St. Petersburg legislature rudely rejected attempts
to criticize the regular murders of nonwhite foreigners in the city by claiming
that, with the price of oil at $80/bbl,
the Russians can do what they please.
Among the 80 legislators, only one
publicly denounced those comments.
A content analysis of 50 national
newspapers produced remarkable results: Between February and July, 2005,
the press mentioned “oil” in 7,285
articles and mentioned “gas” in 8,313
articles, while other important subjects
were mentioned less often, including
“inflation” (3,565 articles), “corruption” (3,354 articles), and “crime”
(1,569 articles).
With the idea that oil has provided
them with an advantage over their
enemies, Russian nationalists are inebriated with thoughts of revenge. In their
dreams, they see the US crawling before
the Russian oil giant, begging for a few
drops of oil. With almost sadistic pleasure, some Russian journalists, such as

lose a sober perspective of reality.
Mesmerized by his clout, Putin may
accept “the invitation” of the Russians
to stay in power after 2008. Today, 51%
of the Russians would vote for him if he
decided to try for a third term, which
he promised not to do. In the foreign
arena, Putin has already shown less
willingness to cooperate with the West
and the US in particular. His foreign
policy may harden even more. However,
it is unlikely that Moscow will demonstrate direct hostility toward the West in
the near future.
The post-Soviet space is another
story, however. The idea that oil will allow Russia to take control over Ukraine,
Georgia, and Belorussia is deeply
engrained in the minds of Kremlin
politicians. We can expect an exacerbation of the political developments in the
post-Soviet space, which will undoubtedly complicate relations with the West.
Aside from the damage to Russia’s
international relations, the oil delirium
is more problematic to the country’s
long-term national interests. The overconfidence in oil revenues may lead to
a decline in the spirit of entrepreneurship, to a refusal to modernize industry,
or even to an acceptance of deindustrialization. The obsession with high oil
prices explains why the Kremlin sees
few obstacles to the country’s continued
move toward an authoritative regime. It

also explains the Kremlin’s conspicuous
disregard for the growing problem of
corruption in society. With the vision
of the Russian leadership blurred, it
may become increasingly insensitive to
various destructive tendencies in the
country. The impact of the price of oil
on political decision-making in Russia
is crucially important to the world and
should be closely monitored.

Federal probe cites budget cuts for BP plant blast
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Years of budget reductions contributed to conditions leading up to the
Mar. 23, 2005, explosion at BP America
Inc.’s 460,000-b/d Texas City, Tex.,
refinery, which killed 15 workers and
injured 180 others, the US Chemical
Safety Board said Oct. 30.
Investigators also found that BP was
aware of problems at the facility but
implemented reforms aimed at improving compliance with procedures and
24

reducing occupational injuries while
ignoring potentially catastrophic safety
risks, the CSB said as it released preliminary findings of its investigation.
It was the first significant update of
the board’s investigation since Oct. 27,
2005, when the first set of findings was
released at a public meeting of Texas
City residents and refinery employees.
The CSB scheduled an additional news
conference for Oct. 31 in Houston but
said it probably would not issue a final
report before March 2007 because the
investigation is so complex.

“Unsafe and antiquated equipment designs were left in place, and
unacceptable deficiencies in preventive maintenance were tolerated,” CSB
Chairman Carolyn W. Merritt said.
Previously, the board indicated that
the equipment involved in the explosion of an isomerization unit was of an
obsolete design that had been phased
out at most other refineries and that
supervisors at the Texas City plant knew
key instruments did not work or were
unreliable (OGJ, Nov. 21, 2005, p. 32).
BP spokesman Ronnie Chappell said

the company agrees with the CSB’s
conclusions that the accident could have
been prevented. He said the findings of
its own investigation are generally consistent with those of the CSB’s inquiry
(OGJ, Jan. 23, 2006, p. 51).
“We do not understand the basis
for some of the comments made by
the CSB,” he said by e-mail on Oct. 31.
“We have and will continue to discuss
our concerns with the board. We are
not going to comment publicly on the
statement of the CSB until the board issues a final written report that we hope
will explain in more detail the basis for
some of their preliminary findings.”

Budget cuts

Large majorities of the survey respondents reported significant maintenance
backlogs that were harming safety.
Disturbingly, most employees agreed
that ‘production and budget compliance
gets recognized before anything else at
Texas City.’”
Economic pressures were apparent in
many decisions that contributed to the
explosion, the CSB said. In 2002, the refinery undertook an environmental initiative known as Clean Streams, which
led to plans to eliminate the isomerization unit blowdown drum involved in
the March 2005 explosion.
“To economize, a decision was made
not to replace the blowdown drum
with a flare system,” said Don Holmstrom, CSB lead investigator. “The refinery did not conduct federally required
safety reviews that likely would have
taken into account BP’s own existing
policy recommending the elimination
of blowdown drums.”
A required study of the isomerization unit’s relief valve system was never
completed, although the need was first
identified in 1993, the CSB added.
It also found that the refinery’s central training staff was reduced from 30
employees in 1997 to 8 in 2004, and
the training department budget was cut
in half from 1998 to 2004. Trainers also
were given other duties so that some
spent little time actually training other
employees, it said. The isomerization
trainer spent only 5% of his time on
training, the CSB said.
The control board operations staff
also was shrunk, and workloads were
increased, the investigators found. Four
open-process safety coordinator positions for the isomerization and other
area units were not filled prior to the
explosion, the CSB said. Its earlier preliminary findings cited operator fatigue
and a lack of effective training and
supervision.

Stringent budget cuts across BP PLC’s
worldwide operations caused safety at
the Texas City refinery to deteriorate,
Merritt said. “BP implemented a 25%
cut on fixed costs from 1998 to 2000
that adversely impacted maintenance
expenditures and infrastructure at the
refinery,” she said.
Maintenance spending had fallen
through the 1990s when Amoco Corp.
owned the refinery, according to Merritt. Additional cuts were imposed after
BP acquired Amoco, she said.
“Every successful corporation must
contain its costs. But at an aging facility
like Texas City, it is not responsible to
cut budgets related to safety and maintenance without thoroughly examining
the impact on the risk of a catastrophic
accident,” she maintained.
CSB found that, by 2002, an internal
BP report had identified cost reductions
as a contributor to eroding infrastructure at the refinery that would take a
large investment to correct.
These findings were corroborated in
a 2005 survey of the refinery’s safety
culture known as the Telos study just
prior to the accident, the federal investigators found. They said the survey’s
interview with the refinery’s manager
identified a history of reduced budgets Culture problems

and a culture of “things not getting

was aware of infrastructure and safety
Merritt said: “The refinery manager
was not alone in this candid assessment. culture problems at the refinery before

the explosion and fire, found that the
problems were “many years in the making.”
It also notes that BP was working
to address the problems before the
accident by spending more money on
operations, maintenance, and plant
integrity and through efforts to reduce
the number of workplace accidents and
injuries, Chappell said.
The company held discussions of
previous fatal accidents at the refinery
and put in place a new “control of
work” audit team to ensure compliance
with safety rules during maintenance
and other activities at the plant, he
added.
Chappell said that while BP achieved
a 70% reduction in workplace injury
rates at Texas City, the CSB’s investigators
“determined these efforts were not sufficient because they focused on personal
safety rather than process safety.” He
said the lower workplace injury rates
led the company “to believe that conditions at the refinery were improving.”
He also said BP’s own investigation did not identify previous budget
decisions or lack of expenditures as a
critical factor or immediate cause of the
accident.
“Indeed, the [BP] report points
out that maintenance and turnaround
spending in the years prior to the incident had increased as Texas City staff
addressed the safety and plant integrity
issues of greatest concern. Maintenance
spending had increased 40% over
the previous 5 years and was higher
than the industry average per barrel of
throughput,” Chappell said.
He said BP is eliminating the use
of blowdown stacks in heavier-thanair light hydrocarbon service and will
eliminate their use at Texas City when it
recommissions the refinery and at other
BP facilities in the US by 2008.
The company also has adopted a new
engineering technical practice governing the use of temporary buildings
in refineries and other plants and has
moved more than 200 such buildings
out of the Texas City refinery or emptied and locked them, he said. ✦

Congressional panel says OPEC manipulates oil prices

Washington Correspondent

intermittently when the price began
to recede,” the report continued.

The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, whose members
regularly call for stable oil markets,
actually has been the greatest source of
recent price volatility, a US congressional committee charged on Oct. 31.
“OPEC is anything but blameless in
the oil price surge of the last 2 years. The
cartel is the single greatest cause of market instability as it fans market fears with
intermittent quota and output cuts to extend the price surge,” the Joint Economic
Committee said in a research report.
It said OPEC has exploited worldwide oil demand growth, which has
been driven largely by improving Asian
economies since 2003. China’s crude
oil consumption alone has increased by
1.76 million b/d in the last 3 years as
of 2006’s second quarter, it indicated,
citing the US Energy Information Administration data.
“In response, OPEC abandoned its
price range of $22-28/bbl and allowed
the price to nearly triple from the
midpoint of the range it set in March
2000. The price increase has resulted in
a cumulative increment to the cartel’s
oil revenues of about $720 billion over
3 years,” JEC’s report said.
It said that as the price for OPEC’s
crude decreased from a peak of
$72.68/bbl on Aug. 8 to $55/bbl on
Oct. 20, the cartel announced that it
would cut output by 1.2 million b/d
effective Nov. 1, with possible further
reductions to follow.
“The market did not anticipate the
price rise, but OPEC’s reaction to the
increase clearly indicates its active
support of higher prices,” the report
said.
It said that OPEC had held back
about 2 million b/d of production in
December 2003 to protect the $2228/bbl price band. “In the face of
rising demand, OPEC activated its idle
capacity sparingly and even cut output

Undeveloped reserves
The cartel eventually ran into capac-

ity constraints and eventually suspended
its quotas, according to JEC. But it also
holds enormous oil reserves, which it
keeps undeveloped, it added.

China parries
price claims

T

he Chinese are becoming defensive over claims that they are responsible for the rising cost of crude
oil. Indeed, they recently trotted out a
senior official to deny the claims.
Ma Kai, Director of China’s
National Development and Reform
Commission (NDRC), commented
on the subject in Qiushi magazine, a
publication of the Communist Party.
“The argument saying China’s
surging demand for oil is a key factor
in driving up oil prices is groundless. China will never pose a threat
to global energy security,” Ma Kai
wrote.
He said China’s net oil imports
accounted for 5.5% of global trade

US’s 25% and Japan’s 10%.

But it would be disingenuous of
anyone to say that Chinese demand
has not contributed to the higher
prices. That’s something Ma Kai
needed to address.

Demand increases

Evidence of that demand emerged
last week when more than 40 African
heads of state were in Beijing for
the China-Africa forum. Of the 40
states, four of them—Angola, Sudan,
Congo-Brazzaville, and Equatorial
Guinea—were among the top 10 oil
exporters to China in 2005.
Altogether, China imported 38.34
million tonnes of crude oil from Africa in 2005, accounting for 30% of
its oil imports, another NRDC official

only about 2,000 exploration wells have
been drilled since the inception of its
activity, compared to more than 1 million in the United States. Saudi Arabia
has just over 1,500 producing wells
compared to more than 560,000 in
the United States,” it said, citing figures
from a 2006 book, The Age of Oil, by
Leonard Maugeri.
The JEC said OPEC’s cost per barrel
is about one third to one fifth of the
price range it had set and one ninth to
one eighteenth of the recent price peak.
One of its earlier reports placed crude
production costs at less than $5/bbl in
the Persian Gulf and less than $9/bbl in
the rest of the cartel.
“Thus, increased Asian oil demand
had been met by OPEC’s manipulation
of its short-run pumping capacity and
scores of oil reserves kept locked away
in the ground. While investment in
capacity expansion is now under way,
the cartel’s renewed decision to cut
production when the price has barely
fallen below $60[/bbl] demonstrates
its intent to exploit the market further,”
the congressional committee said.
The report estimated that in 2006,
OPEC’s total oil revenues will approach
$600 billion, up from $200 million/
year before 2003.
“Even assuming that OPEC was
surprised by increased Asian oil demand and initially hesitant to view the
increase as permanent, the cartel has
had plenty of time to exercise market
leadership. Instead, OPEC refuses to endorse a long-term price band and seeks
to extract as much revenue from the
market as feasible,” it declared.

resources to increasing energy efficiency and developing alternate fuels.
“For the short term, we must have
responsible access to more domestic
resources, and we must have streamlined regulatory requirements that will
allow us to deliver new projects much
faster,” he told the National Press Club.
“For the longer term, however, we must
continue to develop new technologies
such as those we are currently using
to help extract more oil and gas from
existing wells and those we are developing to tap unconventional sources such
as oil shale in Colorado and oil sands in
Canada.”
He said that, unlike other major oil
companies that dropped their oil shale
programs in the early 1980s, Shell Oil
has remained active and is currently trying to develop an in-situ process. This
may include freeze-wall technology,
which would freeze and contain produced water underground (OGJ, July

If Democrats
win control...

A

n Oct. 16 letter from Independent
Petroleum Association of America
Pres. Barry Russell to producers who
are not IPAA members did not mince
words.
“Your business and the entire industry are under attack from antidevelopment groups, federal regulators,
policymakers, and the news media!” it
began. Then it neatly summarized five
ways in which federal laws and regulations affecting US producers could
change unless producers speak out.
Several possible changes will
become likelier if control of the US
House or Senate moves to the Democrats in the Nov. 7 elections. So I asked
IPAA’s Vice-Pres. of Government Relations Lee O. Fuller for details, starting
with a possible reimposition of the
crude oil windfall profits tax (WPT).
“We’ve seen about 15 or more bills
introduced,” he replied. “Many came
when prices were high, with anger
directed at big oil companies. But if
revenues became involved, it would
affect independents directly because
most big oil companies’ revenues
come from outside the United States.”
Fuller added that in the House Ways
and Means Committee, where such a
bill would originate, “clearly there’s
a big difference when the chairman
comes from New York City.” Charles B.
Rangel of New York is the committee’s
chief minority member.
In the Senate, Max Baucus of Montana would become chairman of the
Finance Committee, where a WPT bill
probably would land if the Democrats won control. Fuller said IPAA
has worked well with him before.

Key differences
In fact, several producing-state
32

Democrats led key congressional
committees before control swung to
the Republicans in 1994. There are
key differences now, Fuller told me:
First, more lawmakers from producing states are in the GOP. Second,
the Democrats’ leaders aren’t from
producing states and are less inclined
to be sympathetic.
Third, “We’ve seen the Republican
and Democratic agendas set by leadership caucuses instead of committees.” This gives oil and gas interests
less chance to explain their case.
“There are several centrist Democrats we’ve worked with on some
issues, but many of them are new,”
he said. Others with whom IPAA has
worked draw their primary support
from nonoil and gas sources which
command more attention.
There’s also the possible repeal of
tax provisions covering intangible
drilling and development costs, geological and geophysical expenditures,
enhanced oil recovery, and percentage depletion—particularly to finance
research and development of nonoil
and gas alternative fuels, Fuller said.

‘The whole strategy’
“It can be particularly troublesome
if someone believes the only way to
accomplish this is by penalizing oil
and gas. We also think that efforts to
get more oil and gas domestically
ought to be part of the whole strategy,” he told me.
Fuller said IPAA members at the
group’s recent annual meeting were
apprehensive about the election’s impact on Congress. “They continue to
find opportunities to produce oil and
gas. They also see that barriers need
to be overcome.” ✦

ship, Hofmeister said hydrogen can
become a commercial fuel for vans and
trucks in 5-10 years.
He also emphasized conservation
and energy efficiency. “We should teach
our children energy efficiency so they
grow up and design more efficient
buildings and motor vehicles,” he said.
“If they don’t, this mobility we have
enjoyed for the last 50 years cannot be
sustained.” ✦

ExxonMobil offers
Alaska development
dispute resolution
ExxonMobil Corp. proposed to pay
the state of Alaska $20 million and to
relinquish 20,000 acres to resolve unmet obligations to develop the 106,200
acre Point Thomson Unit (PTU) gascondensate leaseholding on Alaska’s
North Slope.
ExxonMobil, which is operator,
estimates PTU has reserves of more than
8 tcf of gas and 200 million bbl of condensate and oil (OGJ, Nov. 26, 2001,
Newsletter). Alaska state documents say
25 lessees hold working interest in PTU,
consisting of 45 state oil and gas leases.
There is no PTU production yet
because lessees are still trying to determine if they can commercially produce
the gas and condensate. Companies
suggest such production cannot begin
unless a gas pipeline will be built from
the North Slope to the Lower 48.
The pipeline remains uncertain
because the Alaska Legislature in special
sessions repeatedly refused to approve
a pipeline contract that Gov. Frank
Murkowski negotiated with North
Slope oil and gas producers.
The Alaska Department of Natural

P L O R A T I O N

The world has continued to discover
giant oil fields, says a report by the Centre for Global Energy Studies, London.
The finding torpedoes several holdings by the advocates of “peak oil”:
that the industry has not been finding
enough oil, has been relying on too
few aging oil fields, and has not been
discovering new giants.
CGES compiled figures that show 17
giant oil discoveries in the 1950s, 29 in
the 1960s, 24 in the 1970s, 15 in the
1980s, and 11 in the 1990s. Four of the
fields found in recent decades are supergiants, CGES points out.
Nevertheless, it reports that 20% of
global oil production comes from the
world’s largest 14 fields and that the
large fields found in the 1990s produce
only one-tenth of the oil produced by
36 giant fields discovered more than 40
years ago.
CGES counted 15 giant discoveries in
the 1990s (Table 1). Four of these are
in deep water off Angola, and two are
onshore in Iran.
The four relatively recent supergiant
discoveries are Cantarell off Mexico,
Tengiz and Kashagan in Kazakhstan, and
Azadegan in Iran.
Politics and bureaucratic red tape are
preventing the speedy development of
Iran’s Azadegan and Darkhovin fields,
CGES noted, and Kashagan, discovered
in 2000, has not been developed because of quarrels over who would act as

Kashagan still isn’t scheduled to start
producing until 2010.
A CGES list of large oil fields set to
come on stream in 2007-20 (Table
2) excludes the emerging prospects
of the Gulf of Mexico Lower Tertiary
Trend (see map, OGJ, Sept. 25, 2006, p.
36). Twelve confirmed Lower Tertiary
discoveries are thought to contain 3-15
billion bbl of recoverable reserves.
Output of 415,000
b/d at Mexico’s Ku
Maloob Zaap field in
the gulf is expected to
climb to 800,000 b/d
by 2010, partly offsetting Cantarell’s decline.
It is not correct to say that large
discoveries are becoming scarce, CGES
said.
Large fields discovered since 1976
are expected to have supplied 60% of
the 19.5 million b/d of incremental
demand in 1976-2010, it calculated.
“Another Saudi Arabian Ghawar field
(over 90 billion bbl of recoverable oil)
or a Kuwaiti Burgan (over 60 billion
bbl) may not have been discovered, but
the world has found many giant, and
some mammoth, fields that add up to a
massive amount of oil,” CGES said. ✦

Arkansas Fayetteville gas production
rising, two deeper shales explored

H cut 486 ft of gross Fayetteville pay
and is returning frac fluid. The 6-mile
northeast extension, Nicholson 1-16-H
in the Hammerhead pilot area, cut 562
ft of gross Fayetteville pay.

Gross production from Southwestern
Energy Co.’s wells in the eastern Arkoma
basin Fayetteville shale play has grown
to 70 MMcfd and looks to attain 100
MMcfd by the end of 2006, the company said.
The Houston operator is obtaining
better frac results and adding capital
spending, rigs, and completion crews
in the play, which it extended 6 miles
northeast in the third quarter and 20
miles to the east into White County in
the second quarter.
The company expects to have effectively tested a substantial portion of its
Fayetteville shale acreage by the end of
2006, and it is drilling and completing
its first wells in the deeper Moorefield
and Chattanooga shales. Southwestern
holds 887,000 net acres, including
125,000 net acres held by conventional
production.
Its 2006 operations have involved
eight counties centered on Cleburne,
Conway, Faulkner, Van Buren, and White
counties.
Southwestern’s Fayetteville production totaled 3.8 bcf in the third quarter,
up from 1.8 bcf in the second quarter.

97 other wells, including 46 drilled
through the vertical section with two
smaller rigs.
The company had 27 wells awaiting
completion and planned to add three
completion crews to the two already
working by Mar. 31, 2006.
Moving away from nitrogen foam
frac jobs since earlier this year, the
company had performed 49 slickwater
or crosslinked gel frac jobs through Oct.
19 on horizontal wells then on production. The 49 wells averaged initial flow
rates of 1.7 MMcfd.
Forty-two wells that had been
on production 30 days averaged 1.5
MMcfd, and 23 wells averaged 1.4
MMcfd after 90 days. The recently
completed slickwater frac wells cost
$2.2 million/well to drill, frac, and
complete.
The company’s average horizontal well goes to 3,700 ft true vertical
depth, and the lateral takes 10-15 days
to drill and averages 2,350 ft.
Hefley 1-12-H, the 20-mile east
extension well in White County, went
on line in late August at 1.6 MMcfd. Six
miles to its northwest, Johnson 1-16-

Three state energy companies will

110 miles southeast of Dhaka, press
reports said.
The field, discovered in 1977, has
proved reserves of 32 bcf but is thought
to have a potential about 12 times that
amount with further drilling (see map,
OGJ, Apr. 22, 2002, p. 48).
Undertaking the $45 million development are Bangladesh Petroleum
Exploration & Production Co. Ltd.
(Bapex), Bangladesh Gas Fields Co. Ltd.,
and Sylhet Gas Fields.

Pacific Stratus Energy Ltd., Toronto,
reported a possible gas discovery on the
97,279-acre La Creciente block in the
Lower Magdalena basin in Sucre Department 100 miles south of Cartagena,
Colombia.
The 100% owned La Creciente-1
well went to TD 11,557 ft and encountered gas shows across a gross 642 ft in
the Tertiary Cienaga de Oro formation.
The company planned to deepen to
11,600 ft, run logs, and conduct tests.
The well is on Pacific Stratus’s
Prospect A west of Guepaje gas field,

Southwestern is completing its first
horizontal well in the Moorefield shale,
in which it holds 130,000 net undeveloped acres that could be prospective.
The Arkansas Oil & Gas Commission
approved statewide field rules in the
third quarter designating Fayetteville,
Moorefield, and Chattanooga shales as
unconventional sources of supply. Each
drilling unit consists of 640 acres, and
as many as 16 wells are permitted per
unit for each formation.
Southwestern expects drainage from
its horizontal wells to be less than 80
acres/well based on existing microseismic data and reservoir simulation
modeling.
Carter 2-35-H, the company’s first
horizontal Moorefield well, found 221
ft of gross Fayetteville shale pay and
an estimated 85 ft of gross Moorefield
shale pay based on the offsetting vertical well.
The company in February 2006
said it had tested gas from two vertical
Moorefield and Chattanooga wells. It is
evaluating possible future Chattanooga
horizontal development. ✦

Fayetteville operations
Southwestern boosted capital outlays
11% to $925 million, with the increase
of almost $95 million totally attributable to the Fayetteville shale play.
The company attributed the increase
to the frac changes, higher service costs,
more wells operated by others, and the
previously reported purchases of customized land rigs.
The yearend rig count is expected to
be 19, up from 14 at present and 10 on
July 31.
Through Oct. 19, 2006, Southwestern had drilled and completed 128 Fayetteville wells, of which 76 are designated horizontal (71 producing), in 25
pilot areas. It was drilling or completing

A new government
study provides a unique,
national survey of off

practices, methods, and
Drilling
costs in the major oil and
gas producing states of
the US.
In September 2006, Argonne National Laboratory published the report, “Off
site Commercial Disposal of Oil and
Gas Exploration and Production Waste:
Availability, Options, and Costs.” The
study was sponsored by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Fossil
Energy and National Energy Technology
Laboratory.
In addition to identifying commercial disposal facilities for exploration
and production (E&P) wastes, the report
provides data on methods and costs. The
study, along with a searchable database
containing records for more than 200
facilities, can be accessed through the
website of the Argonne’s environmental
science division (www.evs.anl.gov).

In the US, most E&P wastes generated at onshore oil and gas wells are
disposed of or otherwise managed at
the well site. Under certain circumstances, operators will select off site
management options. Some types
of wastes are not suitable for on site
management because of locations in
sensitive environments. Likewise, some
types of offshore drilling wastes cannot

injected underground at the platform
(which is not yet common in most
parts of the US) or they are hauled back
to shore for disposal.

Commercial disposal facilities are off
site businesses that accept and manage
E&P wastes for a fee. Typically, they are
independent of oil and gas companies.
Commercial disposal facilities charge
for a variety of services, including
disposal and management of waste,
transportation, cleaning of vehicles and
tanks, disposal of wash water, and, in
some cases, laboratory analysis. They
use various methods for waste disposal
and management.

States without oil and gas production

API study did not include data on the
large market segment of Gulf of Mexico
offshore waste materials hauled back to
shore for further management.
Oil and gas companies use commercial disposal facilities for various
reasons. Compliance with all applicable
regulatory requirements is paramount.
Several major federal laws govern waste
materials and management activities:
• Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs generation,
transportation, storage, treatment, and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes–
unless excluded or exempted.
• Clean Water Act (CWA) governs
surface discharge of pollutants.
• Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)
governs underground injection of fluids
and slurries.
Federal laws and regulations generally establish minimum federal standards,
while states have the lead role in the
regulation of E&P and general industrial
waste disposal. Most states (except Cali38

fornia) follow the federal exemption
of E&P wastes from federal hazardous
waste management requirements.
Programs for regulating E&P waste
management vary from state to state,
reflecting the geological, climatological, ecological, topographic, economic,
geographic, and age differences among
oil and gas drilling and production
sites across the country. In this light, a
regulatory agency may not allow on site
disposal for a certain type of drilling
waste or a specific location within its
jurisdiction.
Examples of wastes not appropriate
for on site disposal include saltwater
muds and very oily cuttings. Examples
of sensitive environments not suitable for on site burial or land application include areas with high seasonal
water tables, marshy environments, and
tundra.
A second reason for sending waste to
commercial facilities involves cost-effectiveness. If an operator has a relatively small volume of waste, it may make

sense to send it off site rather than
constructing, operating, and closing an
on site facility.
Another conceivable motivation is
that some operators may not want the
responsibility of managing their waste
and prefer to send the waste to a third
party. Although this practice appears to
shift the burden of responsibility and
liability to the third party, the generator
may still be faced with liability under
the US Superfund law.
It is therefore crucial to review the
business practices and compliance
history of an off site commercial disposal company to minimize the risk
of future liability.
Data collection occurred in two
phases. In the first phase, state oil and
gas regulatory officials were contacted
to determine whether their agency
maintained a list of permitted commercial disposal companies dedicated to oil
and gas E&P waste. In the second phase,
representatives of individual commercial disposal companies were interOil & Gas Journal / Nov. 6, 2006

The situation
North Sea storms often prevented the Platform Supply
Vessel (PSV) from sitting alongside this operator’s rig for taking
on spent mud and cuttings. The
operator wanted a contingency
plan for the bulk storage of fluids
and interfaces while carrying
out well displacements to and from oilbase mud, especially during bad weather.

North Sea:

CLEANCUT ISO-PUMP
units provide temporary
mud storage; save valuable
rig time in heavy seas
The solution and results
Already onboard the rig were eight CLEANCUT* ISO-PUMP*
units, used for temporary bulk storage of Oil-Base Mud
(OBM) drill cuttings prior to transferring them to the PSV
for transport to the onshore treatment plant. M-I SWACO*
helped configure a system that would allow OBM to be transferred to the ISO-PUMP system for temporary storage prior to the
well being displaced, and then pumped back to the pits. Now the
operator could keep the extra fluid onboard during displacement
and then continue drilling with no downtime.
While drilling the very first well, adverse weather was forecast, and the
ISO-PUMP units temporarily stored 642 bbl of oil-base mud. Without this extra
capacity, there would have been insufficient mud on the rig for drilling to
recommence. Over the first two wells, 1,782 bbl of oil-base mud were successfully stored within the ISO-PUMP units prior to being transferred to the PSV.
In the completion phase of the second well, the rig was able to carry out the
displacement of the well from OBM to brine without the PSV alongside the
rig, as had been the case in previous wells. The ISO-PUMP units provided the
extra capacity to allow the displacement to be carried out in one complete
operation during adverse weather conditions.

See for yourself how M-I SWACO Drilling Waste Management
prevents costly problems for operators worldwide.

“The use of the ISO-PUMP system was

company plans to open one in Louisiana. All waste streams are amenable to
being managed by cavern disposal. One
company accepts NORM.

(POTW) is occasionally used for treating and disposing produced water.
Evaporation can be used to dispose
oil and gas E&P wastes in semi-arid
regions of the western and southwestern US. Successful use of the technique
requires that evaporation exceed the
total influent to the evaporation system
(including precipitation). The main
evaporation technology involves the use

of surface ponds.
Injection is a process in which liquids
(mainly produced
water) are pumped
into a well and
injected into porous,
subsurface rock or
sand formations. The
fluids can include
water, wastewater,
or water mixed with
chemicals. Oil field
practices across the
US have established
underground injection as a viable alternative method for
the disposal of these
types of industrial
wastes. The variant
of solids injection is
offered for all waste
streams by one of
the big commercial
companies operating
in Louisiana.
Land application
or land farming involves the controlled
and repeated application of wastes to
the soil surface and
use of microorganisms in the soil to
biodegrade hydrocarbon constituents
naturally, dilute and
attenuate metals,
and transform and
assimilate waste constituents. It is offered
in the western and
southwestern parts

of the country.
Recycling turns materials that would
otherwise become waste into valuable
resources. It is mainly offered in the
case of tank bottoms reclamation.
Thermal treatments (incineration
and thermal desorption) use high
temperatures to reclaim or destroy
hydrocarbon-contaminated material.
This technology is the most efficient

Offshore West Africa is forecasted to lead the world in annual spending for operations at $13
billion per year by 2010, according to energy analysts Douglas-Westwood. At the same time,
the offshore industry is experiencing growth constraints because of the increasing demand for
equipment and people. The experienced personnel needed to design, build, and operate drilling
and production equipment are difficult to find and command a growing premium. These offshore
market forces are directing the industry toward new cost-cutting technology and other commercial
innovations to overcome resource constraints.
The Offshore West Africa (OWA) Conference & Exhibition remains the leading source of
information on new technology and operating expertise for this growing deepwater and
subsea market. This year OWA will be held on 20 – 22 March 2007 and changes venue to the
spacious International Conference Centre in Abuja, Nigeria. Over 1,500 attendees and 100 exhibitors from the energy centers of Nigeria, Angola, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, United Kingdom,
UAE, United States, France, Italy, Norway, The Netherlands, Niger, Russia, Australia, and Asia.

Severity

Driving accidents are a leading cause
of fatalities in the oil and gas industry.
Industry approaches to driving-accident
prevention traditionally have involved
policies and standards, defensive driving training, maintenance systems,
journey management procedures, and
performance monitoring.
Mitigation measures generally have
focused on seat-belt use, vehicle condition, rollover-protection devices, air
bags, braking systems, and emergency
response plans. These measures usually
control risk until the program reaches a
performance plateau level.
To move toward zero-loss from
vehicular events, management must
critically analyze risk factors of a specific location and tailor plans further to
reduce risk to acceptable levels.
Key to the site-specific plan addresses
the attitude of the drivers. Experience
has proven the value of generic preventive and mitigation measures. In the
Qatar oil field operation, however, traditional risk-prevention measures were

cluding light crashes.
Worldwide experience has shown
that whenever a location is facing
this trend, the probability of having a
fatality increases considerably unless
management takes steps to control the
root causes.
The unacceptable performance
coupled with the exposure increase
represented a challenge. Schlumberger’s
local management realized that, despite
the preventive measures in place, the
risk associated with driving was not
controlled fully and that they had to
carry out a proper root-cause analysis
and devise an effective remedial work
plan.
Management assigned a loss-prevention team to prepare a risk-based

solutions while taking into account
both operational and personal needs
better to ensure long-term sustained
improvement. The loss-prevention team
was a representative employee group
whose focus was to:
• Assess the initial risk.
• Create a set of driver considerations.
• Identify common root causes.
• Generate a proposal for an action
plan.
• Assess the residual risk to verify
effectiveness.

Initial risk assessment
The risk-based improvement plan
began with an initial risk assessment
based on the location’s crash history

(frequency and severity) and the riskcontrol measures in place at the time.
The loss-prevention team first conducted a hazard analysis and risk-control exercise that identified the current
preventive and mitigation measures and
further actions needed to improve the
critical situation faced.
Because no major, serious, or highpotential accidents involved heavy
transportation, the team focused on
light vehicles, most of which were rentals in good condition and in compliance with the corporate standard.
To assess initial risk, the team applied
a corporate risk matrix (Fig. 2) with the
following worst-case scenario:
“A major accident, such as a rollover,
causing severe injuries to more than
one passenger. No death is considered
because of the mitigation measures in
place.”
The initial risk-assessment results
were:
• Likelihood—Likely; occurs a few
times/month at most locations. In
2004, an average of two vehicular accidents/month occurred.
• Potential severity—Major; six CMS
and three light crashes occurred during
the last 2 years. Mitigation measures
reduced the severity and prevented
injuries.
• Initial risk—Intolerable; do not
take this risk.

Driver considerations
The team analyzed driving profiles,
fleet movement trends, and the needs
and preferences of the drivers, employees, and expatriate families with a
survey that provided key conclusions
for the loss-prevention team to formulate improvement actions.
Categories in the accident profile for
driver type included manager, engineer,
staff, field employee, and professional
driver.
The data showed that the professional drivers had accidents in lower
numbers and potential severity than any
other type of driver. It also found that
they generally have better concentration
and thus improved practical application

An in-depth analysis of the nearmisses and actual accidents determined
common root causes, with three main
factors found:
1. External factors of the local driving environment.
2. Driver attitudes and skills.
3. Large exposure because of miles
driven.
This country had increasing accident
rates and auto fatalities. For example, in
2004, the fatality rate/10,000 vehicles
was 8.9, compared to 2.0 in the US
and 1.5 in the UK. Since 2002, auto
accident deaths have increased steadily,
with local authorities reporting a 15%
increase compared to the previous 3
years.
The situation will likely worsen with
projects under development. Also, the

expected behavior.
The survey included the distribution of miles driven by the hour of the
day and vehicle occupancy, finding that
most driving involved a single occupant
traveling to and from work during peak
hours. This increased exposure unnecessarily.
Improvement actions considered
a driver’s type of work because some
jobs such as operations and marketing
required flexibility and mobility for
day-to-day relations with clients and
suppliers. Personal considerations also
were factored in to support employee
morale.
One finding was that the poor local
public transportation system restricted
employee mobility and jeopardized
morale, both of singles and those with
families.
Developing and implementing the
plan included active interaction with
all involved, including expatriate family
members, to seek employee feedback
further to reduce risk, gain driver buyin to improve behavior; and ensure
management commitment to provide
needed resources.

White arrow indicates decreasing risk

accidents involving company vehicles
had occurred in the previous 2 years.
During the same period, third parties
caused three of the six CMS company
crashes.
Investigations (2003-05) indicated
that, in this location, 70% of the accidents were attributed to driver lack
of skill as a personal factor. The data
showed that company drivers lacked a
mature crash-free attitude and neglected
to apply defensive driving principles in
about half the accidents.
While drivers could recite readily
the principles, the gap was with their
willingness to apply them. Moreover,
instructors did not effectively address
this behavioral issue.
Before 2004, all driving instruc-

tors were field operators and foremen who dedicated only part of their
time to defensive-driving training and
practical “commentary drives.” With
the increased activity, training lacked
the personal commitment to address
behavior as well as basic knowledge of
driving skills.
The survey clearly showed that drivers as the only occupants drove 75% of
the miles, with about 30% of the miles
being driven to and from work during
peak hours. This meant that drivers were
unnecessarily exposing themselves.
In this location, the number of miles
driven increased to 1.2 million in 2005
from 600,000 in 2003. Options were
needed to reduce the miles driven.

Devised plan
The analysis led to a plan with the
following five “must have” elements.
1. Management commitment:
Managers lead plan implementation and
oversee enforcement.
2. Risk reduction (likelihood): Initiate monthly tracking, reduce exposure
(miles driven), and increase professional driver use.
3. Addressing employee and driver
behavior: Recognize good performance
and apply accountability concept. Emphasize the importance of attitude in
training sessions, commentary drives,
and employee and driver meetings. To
support morale, consider public transportation limitations.
4. Operational needs accommodations: Revaluate actions to avoid negative impact on activities.
5. Segment-specific needs accommodations: Allow individual business

O D U C T I O N

segments to develop tailored plans.
Reference 1 includes the specific
actions taken and a detailed description
of the management-approved action
plan presented to the work force. Most
of the action items focused on reducing
exposure and improving driver behavior and skills.
The main indicator of driver performance used was the driving score taken
from the driver improvement monitor. An equation calculates the score by
combining three factors:
1. Top speed factor (TSF) that includes maximum speed and cumulative
time greater than the set speed limit.
2. Harsh acceleration factor (HAF),
or the acceleration greater than a set
threshold divided by miles driven.
3. Harsh deceleration factor (HDF),
or the braking greater than the speed
limit divided by the miles driven.

Driver score = TFS + HAF + HDF
The analysis normalizes the scoring
into three categories of skill level:
1. Green driver: Score between 0
and 2, good skills.
2. Yellow driver: Score between 2
and 5, requires direction for continuing
improvement.
3. Red driver: Score greater than
5, requires immediate coaching and
improvement.
The lower the score, the better the
driver’s performance, with the average
score used to assess trends for different
areas. This location achieved a sustained
improvement from an average score of
1.75 in first-quarter 2004 to 0.9 in lastquarter 2005 (Fig. 3). Since October
2004, management has presented regular awards to the best drivers as well
as enforcing accountability for drivers
with poor performance.

HSE Report

The AARm depicted in Fig. 4 is the
main lagging performance indicator for
both CMS and CMSL accidents during
2004 and 2005. No CMS accidents occurred during the last 15 months of the
study.
The AARm (CMSL) trend, also improved, falling by 2006 to a lower level
than in the previous 4 years.
Using the same worst-case scenario
as in the initial risk evaluation, described previously, the residual risk (Fig.
5) is as follows:
• Likelihood—Possible; will occur a
few times/year in most areas. The plan
has achieved good results, with no CMS
accidents occurring in the past year and
reduced light accident numbers and
potential severity for most. Moreover,
driver performance and reduced exposure improved by 20%.
• Potential severity—Major; maintained mainly because of the environmental factors.
• Residual risk—Undesirable; demonstrate risk to be ALARP, “as low as
reasonably practicable,” before proceeding.

Future plans
This risk-based improvement plan
effectively demonstrated that factors
causing accidents can be determined
and specific actions addressing their
root causes can be defined. Management commitment, however, is needed
to provide the resources and to gain
work-force buy-in. Without this element, a plan is destined to fail.
The management team will continue
to review the plan, define specific actions and outline initiatives to sustain
the performance achievements, and further improve the risk control measures
for the long term. ✦

US PROPANE

SECOND-THIRD
QUARTERS 2006

Since January 2006, US gas plants
have enjoyed record high profit margins.
Furthermore, propane prices in all regional markets have been strong enough
to encourage refineries to maximize sales
into the merchant market.
Despite these economic incentives,
gas-plant production (even after adjusting
for ongoing problems in Louisiana) and
net production from refineries failed to
reach their historic full-recovery volumes.
During
2000-02, US
producers and
consumers
could count on
900,000-925,000 b/d propane production from gas plants and refineries, when
gas plants operated at full recovery. Since
2002, however, “full recovery” gradually declined but the decline went largely
unnoticed because a variety of economic
and weather-related factors held production below the historic full-recovery
volumes.

Gas plants

Historically, at full recovery, gas-plant
production would normally average
545,000-560,000 b/d. In second-quarter
2006, however, propane production from
gas plants averaged only 501,000 b/d, or
45,000-60,000 b/d below full recovery. Production in second-quarter 2006
increased 13,000 b/d from first-quarter
2006 but was 22,000 b/d lower than
year-earlier volumes.
Although production in Louisiana had
not recovered from losses due to Hurricane Katrina, these losses had narrowed
to about 20,000 b/d in second-quarter
2006. Gas-plant production in thirdquarter 2006 was an estimated 500,000Propane supply
515,000 b/d—again below demonstrated
historic full-recovery production.
Before 2005, full propane production

Reﬁneries
Historically, full-recovery propane
production from refineries was about
370,000-380,000 b/d. Net production
from refineries was most recently at this
level in second-quarter 2001. Since 2001,
however, net production from refineries
has never been higher than 340,000360,000 b/d and was most recently at
this level in second-quarter 2005.
In second-quarter 2006, net propane
production from refineries averaged only
301,000 b/d—despite very strong economic incentives to maximize purchases
of natural gas and minimize the use of
propane in refinery fuel systems. Notably,
net propane production from refineries in
PADD I and PADD III failed to rebound to
historic full-recovery volumes in secondquarter 2006.
Production in PADD I in the secondquarter 2006 averaged only 26,000 b/d
and was 7,000 b/d below year-earlier
volumes. Production in PADD III in second-quarter 2006 averaged only 144,000
b/d and was 32,000 b/d lower than yearearlier volumes.

Fuel switching
Net propane production from refineries in PADD I typically averaged 3035,000 b/d before the surge in natural
gas prices in fourth-quarter 2005. Net
propane production declined to 25,000
b/d in fourth-quarter 2005 and averaged only 22,000 b/d in the first-quarter
2006.
In second-quarter 2006, however, net
propane production increased to 26,000
b/d. Refineries in PADD I experienced the
full impact of the sharp spike in natural
gas prices following Hurricane Katrina
and were logical candidates for fuel
switching. The decline in merchant sales
of propane from refineries in PADD I was
fully reasonable.
Furthermore, a lag of 3-6 months is

also reasonable before the effects of fuel
switching and adjustments to refinery fuel
systems are fully reversed. Net propane
production from refineries in PADD I is
likely to be 5,000-10,000 b/d higher
in fourth-quarter 2006 compared with
fourth-quarter 2005.
Net propane production from refineries in PADD III typically averaged
165,000-175,000 b/d before fourthquarter 2005. In first-quarter 2006,
net propane production averaged only
132,000 b/d but increased to 144,000
b/d in second-quarter 2006. Even though
almost every refinery in PADD III had
returned to full production and normal
operations, net propane production
remained 20,000-30,000 b/d below
prehurricane levels.
The average net production in secondquarter 2006, however, was skewed by
an unusual decline in June. In April and
May 2006, net production in PADD III
averaged 154,000 b/d, or only 10,00020,000 b/d below prehurricane volumes.
Net propane production will continue to
recover to full prehurricane volumes during third and fourth quarters 2006.

Heating-season outlook
We expect propane supply from
refineries to average 300,000-320,000
b/d in fourth-quarter 2006 and 325,000350,000 b/d in first-quarter 2007.
Recovery and reversal of fuel switching
could occur faster and net propane production in fourth-quarter 2006 may be as
high as 330,000-340,000 b/d.
Fig. 2 illustrates trends in total propane

production (gas plants and refineries).

Imports
In second-quarter 2006, total propane
imports into the US averaged 204,000
b/d. Imports were 22,000 b/d higher
than in second-quarter 2005 but were
15,000 b/d lower than in first-quarter
2006. The decline in imports in secondquarter 2006 was consistent with normal
seasonal trends.
Significantly, waterborne shipments to
terminals on the East Coast and Gulf Coast
posted a year-to-year increase of 32,000
b/d in second-quarter 2006, but shipments from Canada declined by 10,000
b/d.
Imports into the US during thirdquarter 2006 were an estimated 200,000210,000 b/d, or about the same as in
2005. Based on normal seasonal patterns,
total imports into the US will increase to
210,000-220,000 b/d in fourth-quarter
2006 and 220,000-230,000 b/d in firstquarter 2007.
Imports in fourth-quarter 2006 will
be about 115,000-125,000 b/d lower
than in fourth-quarter 2005. The surge of
waterborne shipments in the aftermath
of hurricanes Katrina and Rita pushed
the volume of imports in fourth-quarter
2005 abnormally high.

1999 was 22.3%. During 1996-2005,
propane’s share of fresh feed was equal to
or exceeded 23% only 6.7% of the time.
In third-quarter 2006, feedstock demand for propane was 360,000-370,000
b/d and propane’s share of total fresh
feed was 21- 22% (Table 2).
Ethylene plants will operate at 88-92%
of capacity rates during fourth-quarter 2006 and first-quarter 2007. Total
feedstock demand will average 1.65-1.75
million b/d. On the basis of the strong
seasonal pattern in feedstock demand,
propane consumption in the ethylenefeedstock market will average 300,000325,000 b/d in fourth-quarter 2006 and
325,000-350,000 b/d in first-quarter
2007. Fig. 4 illustrates historic trends in
ethylene feedstock demand.

Retail demand
Retail propane end uses include
sales to residential-commercial, motor
fuel, agriculture, and industrial sectors.
Consumption in the residential-commercial sector usually accounts for 50-70%
of total retail demand during second
and third quarters and 70-80% of total
retail demand during the winter heating season. Sales into the various retail
end-use sectors are determined annually
by the American Petroleum Institute on
the industry’s behalf. Petral Consulting
Co. used heating-degree-day statistics to
develop estimates of monthly consumption in the residential-commercial and
agriculture sectors.
Propane demand in the residentialcommercial sector (space heating, cooking, and water heating) tracked normal

seasonal patterns and declined during
second and third-quarter 2006. Demand
averaged 270,000-300,000 b/d in second-quarter 2006 and 100,000-115,000
b/d in third-quarter 2006. These volumes
represent actual propane consumption,
not 100% of retail sales.
In addition to estimated consumption, a small percentage of customers in
the residential-commercial sector began
to refill their storage tanks in May. More
customers in the residential-commercial
sector began to refill their storage tanks
during third-quarter 2006. The estimated
transfers of propane to secondary or tertiary storage averaged 200,000-225,000
b/d during third-quarter 2006. Propane
transfers into secondary or tertiary storage
during third-quarter 2006 were 40,000150,000 b/d below volumes transferred
to secondary or tertiary storage during
2001-05.
Based on estimated actual consumption in the residential-commercial sector
and consumption in the motor fuel, agriculture, and industrial sectors, propane
sales into retail end-use markets averaged
350,000-375,000 b/d in second-quarter 2006 and 150,000-175,000 b/d in
third-quarter 2006.
Including transfers to secondary or
tertiary storage, total propane sales into the
retail markets were 350,000-400,000 b/d
in third-quarter 2006. In 2005, total retail
propane sales plus transfers to secondary or
tertiary storage averaged 490,000 b/d.
Residential-commercial propane
demand began to increase during
September-October and will reach peak
consumption during December-January.

Based on average heating-degree days for
the previous 10 years, residential-commercial propane consumption in all retail
end uses will be 750,000-800,000 b/d
in fourth-quarter 2006 and 975,000-1.1
million b/d in first-quarter 2007. Residential-commercial demand will average
1.1-1.2 million b/d during December
through February.
Total propane demand in all retail
end-use sectors will average 925,000975,000 b/d during fourth-quarter 2006
and 1.2-1.3 million b/d during firstquarter 2007. Forecasts for retail propane
demand during winter 2006-07 are
50,000-100,000 b/d higher than in the
winter 2005-06. During winter 200506, heating-degree days in the East Coast
and Midcontinent were 6-7% below the
1994-2004 average. Forecasts are based
on the 10-year average number of heating-degree days.

Pricing, economics
Propane prices in Mont Belvieu averaged 93.2¢/gal in March 2006. During
second-quarter 2006, Mont Belvieu prices
rode the coattails of the strong rally in
WTI prices. Spot propane prices increased
to 109.7¢/gal in June, or 17.8% higher
than in March. Propane prices in Mont
Belvieu rose to 116.3¢/gal in July but
declined to 113.7¢/gal in August and
103¢/gal in September.
During second-quarter 2006, the
ratio of propane to WTI averaged 62.8%.

third quarters. This comparison indicates
that propane prices were weaker during
second and third-quarter 2006 vs. the historic average. The propane-WTI ratio was
also weaker than in second-quarter 2005.
In third-quarter 2006, the propane-WTI
ratio increased to 66.2%—still weaker
than the historic average but stronger than
in third-quarter 2005 (64.6%).
From the perspective of influences on
supply-demand balances, ethylene feedstock price-value relationships are more
important than WTI price ratios. In the
second quarter, propane prices in Mont
Belvieu averaged only 0.8¢/gal less than
average substitution values vs. ethane and
natural gasoline.

In third-quarter 2006, propane prices
in Mont Belvieu averaged 3.3¢/gal higher
than average substitution values vs. ethane
and natural gasoline. These comparisons
indicate that propane in Mont Belvieu
was fairly priced in second-quarter 2006.
Prices in the third-quarter 2006 were
somewhat stronger but remained within
the normal variability in price-value
relationships.

to train their employees
to detailed standards.
Pipelines
Several training options and credentialing
or accreditation factors may come into
play. The difficulty faced by industrial
and emergency services personnel is to
sort through applicable standards and
available training curricula and determine the levels of training employees
need.
Understanding the different levels of
training is crucial. Handling hazardous
materials and responding to incidents
require a variety of personnel responsibilities. People must understand that
their response role is limited by the
level of training they’ve received. In
short, they must operate
within and according to
their levels of training and
competencies.
One facility that leads
in providing both emergency-response training
and technical expertise
to prepare responders for
potential emergency is the
Texas Engineering Extension
Service (TEEX), Brayton Fire
Training Field, College Station, Tex. It is one of the best equipped
and staffed facilities in the US for such

ronment, surrounding communities,
and company assets.
Working with flammable materials, either as part of day-to-day operations or as an emergency response, is
always risky; mistakes may be sudden
and complications and hazards can be
masked.
Once a problem emerges, the dangers to health, property, and life can
escalate rapidly. Even the newest and
best-equipped facility is vulnerable to a
potential fire. There is no better defense
against fire than to plan, staff, and train
a response team.

Emergency brigades
Four options are available when
evaluating fire protection:
• Mass evacuation: Train only to
report fires via the 911 system.
• Train only selected personnel for
incipient fires; i.e., fire extinguisher use
or use of hand lines of 125 gpm or less;
no “turnout” (i.e., standard fire-fighting) gear.
• Train everyone for incipient fires.
• Train an emergency-response team
for response in all areas of facility.

option is exercised for what should be
obvious reasons.
Industrial emergency-response brigades or teams are groups of employees
who are knowledgeable, trained, and
skilled sufficiently to perform basic
fire fighting. The size of the emergency
organization depends on the type of
brigade, number of employees working
in a facility, size of the facility, number
and type of hazards, and availability of
emergency equipment on site.
The brigade can consist of volunteers
or assigned personnel. The trend in the
industry is toward volunteer brigades
with few paid members. The brigade
should have members from every work
shift and department.
This latter factor is important during
emergencies when affected areas or
equipment such as tanks, process lines,
and towers must be quickly identified.
A brigade with a member whose daily
job involves working in a given area
makes it much easier to identify isolation points and obtain product-specific
information.
Employers who choose to have an
industrial fire brigade are mandated by
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA; 29 CFR1910.156)
to prepare and maintain a statement
or written policy that establishes the
existence of an industrial fire brigade.
This document will outline employee
responsibilities and actions during
emergencies.
A basic organizational structure must
be site specific and assign responsibilities to functional positions. This will
help establish operational limitations
for brigade members. The organizational statement will show how the
brigade fits into the company’s emergency-response plan and the limits to
the brigade’s responsibilities.
Another important function of the
organizational statement is to describe
the relationship between the industrial
fire brigade and other response organizations, including municipalities, mutual-aid organizations, and contractors.

Transportation emergencies involving railcar and highway containers are designed to simulate situations
that could occur during the movement phase of the production process. Fire and spill problems include
open dome fires, overfills, line leaks, or separations. Both liquid hydrocarbon spills and propane leaks add to
the complexity of the extinguishment.

Regulatory factors
How companies go about protecting assets will vary from site to site and
company to company. A company must
decide the how, what, when, and where
of its fire-fighting plan.
The main factors behind fire-brigade
training can be found in OSHA 29 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.156,
which requires annual hands-on training on the duties brigades are expected
to perform and the hazards they may
encounter.
This training includes live-fire training. If the company produces, distributes, stores, or processes flammable
liquids, the brigade would be required
to train with a flammable liquid. The
same holds true for flammable gases.
It would be inappropriate to use hay,
wood, or other less volatile fuel sources
for training.
The same holds true if teams will be
expected to carry out search and rescue
and interior fire fighting. These are all
considerations in fire-training plan.
Three National Fire Protection As-

sociation (NFPA) standards support
29CFR1910.156:
• NFPA 600—Standard for Industrial
Fire Brigades.
• NFPA 1081—Standard for Industrial Fire Brigade Member Professional
Qualifications (Interior/Exterior).
NFPA 1081 ensures basic firefighting
needs are covered; i.e., life safety issues.
This standard is then broken out into
chapters (incipient, interior, exterior,
and leadership). Seen as a “road map”
of best practices, NFPA 1081 is designed to ensure minimum training
requirements and uniformity.
• NFPA 1041—Standard for Fire
Instructor Certification. This standard
assists in the development of skills that
are necessary for instruction of adults.
Companies must train emergency
responders to perform required tasks
as set forth under the companies’
emergency action plans. An EAP must
describe in detail how the company
will respond to the specific hazards and
the protocols that will be followed. It is
critical that fire brigades train with the
guidelines set forth under the EAP and

The functional elements of the brigade are further outlined in NFPA 600
and 1081, which detail expected functions of a brigade and discuss organizational duties.
The current trend in emergency-response training programs is certification-based training. Certification means
that an individual has been tested by an
accredited examining agency against a
body of clearly delineated material and
found to meet or exceed the minimum
standard.
Certification provides the individual
with the opportunity to test skills and
knowledge against peers from all types
of fire departments and fire-service
agencies. Examinations are based on

TEEX has also announced the offering of a new pipeline-emergencies
course. The course is held in cooperation with the US Department of Transportation and the National Association
of State Fire Marshals. This course relied
heavily upon recognized industry leaders in the pipeline business for course
development and prop design.
These industry representatives deal
daily with pipeline operations and
response and are in tune with the
pipeline industries’ constantly growing infrastructure. It is the goal of this
course to provide emergency responders, local officials, command staff, and
other potentially involved parties with
the knowledge and tools to manage and
mitigate pipeline emergencies successfully.
The pipeline-emergencies course
is designed in a modular format. The
entire course consists of a 40-hr program that addresses pipeline awareness
(8 hr), pipeline operations (16 hr),
and pipeline-emergency response (16
hr). During the awareness module of
this course, regulatory factors will be
addressed as well as causes of pipeline
incidents, prevention of pipeline emergencies, and team-based exercise.
The second module of this course is
designed to inform participants about
both gas and liquid pipeline operations. This includes both transmission
and distribution systems and addresses
below and aboveground equipment.
Also covered in this section are pipeline
safety programs, inspection, mapping
systems, equipment identification, pipeline markings, and many other critical
factors involved in pipeline operations.
The third and final module of this
course covers pipeline emergency
response. Participants will use the Incident Command System (ICS) operating under guidelines of the National
Incident Management System (NIMS),
develop Incident Action Plans, manage
resources and manpower, and—above
all—bring all this knowledge together
during responses with real-world pipeline training props.
The TEEX pipeline project consists

of a 2,300-ft belowground pipeline
with multiple aboveground connections
where training props have been constructed. There are seven aboveground
stand-alone pipeline training props
designed to enhance the responders’
abilities to deal with emergencies they
may encounter during daily activities.
These training props have the ability
to leak both liquid and gas. This flexibility to have material-specific leaks
is a very important in the training for
potential emergencies and products.
These training props consist of
metering stations, dewatering tanks,
pig launching and receiving stations,
mainline closures, creek crossing, and
a soon-to-be-constructed multiuse
chemical complex with a truck-loading
terminal. These props aid in developing both recognition skills that pipeline
responders must posses and response
endeavors to pipeline emergencies.
Pipeline-response training is a
much-needed training tool that will be
useful, especially considering the age of
the nation’s pipelines. ✦

California oil
tax would fund
energy spending
“Senseless” half describes a ballot
initiative on which Californians will vote in
November calling for a tax on oil to pay for
state-sponsored energy.
The aim of the Clean Alternative Energy
Act is to accumulate $4 billion for 10 years
of spending on programs to replace oil.
The money would come from a tax on
oil production, the rate of which would vary
with the price of crude. At $10-25/bbl, the

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

rate would be 1.5% of the gross value of
oil. The top rate, 6%, would apply when the
crude price exceeded $60/bbl.
Proponents of the initiative, known as
Proposition 87, include former President
Bill Clinton, former Vice-President Al Gore,
movie stars, and wealthy Hollywood executive Stephen Bing, who is reported to have
contributed $40 million to the glitz blitz.
Prop 87’s supporters say the measure
would cut oil use, improve the environment, and make oil companies pay for
clean energy.
They betray their shallow understanding of the issues by including in Prop 87 a
prohibition against pass-through of the oil
tax to consumers. They don’t say how a tax
on raw material is supposed to not ﬁnd its
way to consumers of the ﬁnished product.
But this is the land of fantasy and deception, after all.
In the real world, Prop 87 would cut oil
production in California, raise imports, and
squander proceeds of the production tax on
a political beauty contest among uneconomic fuels. It would yield little in the way
of useful energy; only markets can do that.
By putting large amounts of money up for
grabs outside the reach of market discipline
and beyond the limits of popular understanding, it also would invite corruption.
Among US states, California ranks
ﬁrst in gasoline consumption and third in
distillate use, mostly diesel. If a majority of
Californians really want to stop using oil,
nothing is stopping them.
To do so by way of a punishing tax on
oil production would be beyond senseless,
however. In view of the measure’s effect on
producers of something for which Californians display a consistently strong need, it
also would be hypocritical.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Reaction slow to OPEC cut
Energy markets were slow to show conﬁdence that members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries would follow through on an agreement to reduce
production by Nov. 1.
The November contract for benchmark US crudes gained 85¢ to $58.50/bbl Oct. 19
in New York as Saudi Arabia endorsed a counterseasonal proposal to reduce production by 1 million b/d at the group’s meeting in Qatar. But it expired at a 16-month low
of $56.82/bbl Oct. 20 after OPEC voted to cut actual production by 1.2 million b/d to
26.3 million b/d, well below the 28 million b/d ceiling set 2 years ago.
Cold weather and a bigger-than-expected reduction of US petroleum inventories
helped boost the new front-month crude contract to $60.75/bbl on the New York
Mercantile Exchange by Oct. 27, however.
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said OPEC
likely would curtail only 765,000 b/d in its effort to keep oil prices above $60/bbl on
NYMEX. Saudi Arabia immediately agreed to cut 380,000 b/d. Iran subsequently
agreed to throttle back by 176,000 b/d, while UAE ofﬁcials notiﬁed customers of a 5%
reduction.
“We believe that the Saudis did not like the way this cut was more or less
imposed by Nigeria and Venezuela without preliminary discussion with the other
members, probably expecting to make good deals by forcing the organization to
announce a cut based on ofﬁcial quotas,” said analysts at the Societe Generale
corporate investment-banking group. “After all, both Nigeria and Venezuela have
long been producing less than their ofﬁcial quotas: 120,000 b/d less for Nigeria and
680,000 b/d less for Venezuela. Therefore, if OPEC decided on pro-rata quota cuts
totaling 1 million b/d, Nigeria and Venezuela could each have complied with its new
ofﬁcial quota by maintaining production and not cutting a single barrel.”
With the OPEC basket at $55.53/bbl on Oct. 27, members still have strong incentive to produce at high levels, said Rick Mueller, senior analyst at Energy Security
Analysis Inc., Boston. “Beyond the potential public relations nightmare of cutting
output in the face of high prices, there is a strong economic incentive for countries
to maximize their revenue while prices remain strong,” Mueller said. However, he
expects the Saudis “will act quickly to raise production to snuff out any sharp price
spike.”
At the Centre for Global Energy Studies, London, analysts thought it “questionable whether prices are low enough to persuade OPEC’s African members to cut
production while demand for their light, sweet crudes remains robust.” The OPEC
agreement lacks “explicit starting points for individual output cuts” necessary for
“real credibility,” said CGES analysts. “The quota system—at least in its present
form—is dead,” they concluded. “Quotas were a useful system to adopt when OPEC
was attempting to manage the market during a period of high excess production
capacity, but they have little relevance at a time when most member-countries are
producing at or close to capacity.”
Weather moves prices
The new December front-month contract for benchmark US sweet, light crudes
lost 52¢ to $58.81/bbl Oct. 23 on NYMEX but rebounded to $59.35/bbl Oct. 24 as US
forecasts of cold weather triggered speculation of reduced heating oil inventories. It
jumped to $61.40/bbl Oct. 25 when the Energy Information Administration reported
US crude inventories plunged by 3.3 million bbl to 332.3 million bbl in the week
ended Oct. 20. US oil imports fell 936,000 b/d to 9.5 million b/d with the Louisiana
Offshore Oil Port—the largest US oil importing facility—closed for 3 days during that
week. US gasoline stocks fell by 2.8 million bbl to 207.4 million bbl, while distillate
fuel inventories declined by 1.4 million bbl to 144 million bbl. It was “the biggest
weekly decline in petroleum inventories since the week that Hurricane Katrina made
landfall [in Louisiana Aug. 29, 2005], ﬂying in the face of expected increases for oil
and gasoline,” Raymond James analysts said.
Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland, said
crude prices essentially bottomed out in October and would likely climb for the rest
of this year. “We expect volatility to remain as we are still in the shoulder period
where the winter demand is not fully set in and there is still strong disagreement in
the market over the impact of the OPEC oil cuts,” he said.

E&P industry utilizes every available tactic for
recruitment and retention of scarce employees
The global oil and gas industry is facing a severe shortage of employees, today
and in the future. David Preng with Preng & Associates Energy Search Specialists,
notes that more than 154,000 employees will be required by the worldwide oil
and gas industry by 2020. He says there are more than 121,000 people in the
industry presently, so it would seem that “only” 33,000 additional employees will
be required during the next 14 years.
That’s not exactly correct, according to Preng. About 51,000 of today’s 121,000
workers will retire by 2020 based upon current age, leaving less than half the
required 154,000 workers and resulting in more than 83,000 new professionals
needed by 2020.
The severe shortage becomes even more apparent, according to Preng, when
examining the number of petroleum engineering and related
sciences graduates available by 2020. There will be an estimated
51,750 English speaking graduates by 2020, according to Preng, but
that still leaves a shortfall of new hires of nearly 32,000.
During a recent presentation about HR trends in the E&P industry,
he noted that company tactics to help alleviate that shortfall include
industry promotion, scholarships and internships. Recruiting and
retention tactics aimed at experienced professionals include increased
compensation, retention bonuses, perks and other programs.
E&P companies today are aware of similar ﬁgures and have already
established and implemented recruiting and retention strategies.
Many oil and gas companies are increasing their ranks of engineers
via intern programs, hiring a vast majority of graduating seniors that
have been fortunate enough to have been through various companies’ internship
programs, some for multiple years with the same company.
Dominion E&P, for example, says it hires 80–90% of graduating seniors that have
been in its intern programs. Schlumberger says it has little problem meeting its
required engineers in North America mainly because of its intern program. Baker
Hughes has had a successful internship program for many years that includes
participation of many of its international locations as well as the U.S. These
companies also recruit mid-career professionals when necessary, depending upon
the level of position to be ﬁlled.
Scorpion Offshore, which is in the position of having to hire crews for its ﬁve
new rigs under construction, is utilizing an online recruitment service that
will cull through the responses to its recruitment advertisements and then
present the best qualiﬁed candidates to Scorpion for additional screening and
then interviews.
While there are thousands of website-based recruiting services around the
world, many that claim millions of available jobs in virtually every occupation, it
is an advantage to anyone in the oil and gas industry, employers and job seekers
alike, to register with industry speciﬁc online services that understand the industry
and can offer more than just a portal to post resumes and job openings. ◊

Dominion E&P’s internship program
helps ease future labor shortages
“There is a severe labor shortage across all segments of our industry,” Duane
Radtke emphasized. Radtke, President and CEO of Dominion E&P in Houston,
explained that small independents, majors, large service companies and drilling
contractors are all facing the same issues and challenges. When asked if the
industry is making progress in alleviating the labor shortage in the future by
encouraging new students to study the geosciences with the aim of entering the
industry, he answers, “Personally, I think we are not.”
However,
Radtke
is
encouraged by a few of the
signs he is seeing. For example,
more young people are
entering universities to study
the geosciences, encouraged
by high school counselors and
university professors. And not
all are students from families
with oilﬁeld backgrounds.
“A lot of our new hires in 2005
and 2006 were from families
with older brothers or fathers
in the industry, as you would
expect,” Radtke said, “but
we are beginning to see more
young adults and professionals
whose backgrounds are not
from oil and gas families.
“That is a very good trend,” he continued, “because the word is spreading
that this is a great industry with great chances for advancement.”
Additionally, he is beginning to see this change across all of the disciplines
in which Dominion is interested, geologists, geophysicists and engineers. The
onshore segment of the industry is one of the most active presently but the
company is seeing interest in all of the support systems as well.
Competition is ﬁerce among companies for fewer experienced people. The
majors, small and large independents, service companies and contractors
historically had not needed to approach colleges and universities to attract
talent. Now, however, virtually all companies are being forced to take that tactic
as the present work force continues to age, with a majority reaching retirement
age during the next ﬁve years or so.
Radtke noted that the leading edge of the Baby Boom generation turns 60
years old in 2006, and as they retire, so do their years of experience and expertise
in the industry. On the ﬂip side is the so-called “Generation Y”, the teens,
college students and twenty-somethings, with too few interested in becoming
professionals in the petroleum industry.

Dominion E&P provides
college interns hands-on
experience, both onshore
and offshore.

Dominion believes there will be a great deal of stability in the oil and gas
marketplace going forward. “Prices may vary but I don’t think anybody sees
anything that will keep the fundamentals for natural gas below $5 or $6,”
Radtke said. “We are going to have a long period of stability.”

Another challenge is that many people consider oil and gas to be a dirty
industry, less glamorous than other professions. Talk with some of the students
at colleges and universities and there are issues about the use of fossil fuels
versus conservation. “Those are important issues,” Radtke said.
“I tell them that they have made great points, why don’t you come in and
help us solve the problem? It’s easy to be on the outside and talk about the
problems. Come in and be a part of the solution.
“On a macro basis we have so many things that are coming together and
have come together during the past few years that provide young people with
a tremendous opportunity and a tremendous challenge,” Radtke said.

Recruitment strategies pay off
Dominion utilizes a variety of recruiting and retention strategies that result
in not only attracting and retaining experienced industry employees but new
hires as well. The programs also help reduce turnover. They include internships,
mentoring, and recruiting and retaining people from outside the E&P business
but who have engineering skills and experience from other areas of the energy

oil and gas business.
The company had 54 interns during the summer of 2006. Historically, about
80% of the interns in their senior year were offered employment at Dominion.
“Eighty percent is a remarkable ﬁgure,” Radtke said, “but we try to have a
culture here that they are part of building something and not just generating
numbers in an ofﬁce. And that is the approach we take with our interns as well
as our young engineers and geologists.”
Dominion’s interns are placed in projects where they receive hands-on
experience and where they can recommend ﬁeld and development projects,
“real programs where they have a sense of participation rather than just
working for the summer,” Radtke explained.
“It’s expensive to have an intern program, but we believe we have paid for
that program by the incremental oil and gas that we found from the hands-on
work that they do.”
Interns at Dominion are primarily undergraduate students, however, there
are a few graduate students as well. The program includes college freshmen
students and in some cases students are chosen and nurtured while they are
in high school.
For example, Dominion was alerted to three students by their high school
advisors that they were interested in the industry, although they had not
previously been exposed to the business. Dominion followed through, worked
with them and now they are working toward petroleum engineering degrees
at the Colorado School of Mines, University of Oklahoma and University
of Houston.
“We went to their schools, worked with them, and now we have some
outstanding young people interested in the industry,” Radtke said.
Reaching even further, a grant program sponsored by the Dominion
Foundation works to strengthen math and science education in grades K-12 in

public schools in Texas and ﬁve other states where the company operates.
Additionally, Dominion encourages its multi-year interns to work with the
company’s different business segments. This results in the interns experiencing
the different programs and people and to become more comfortable with the
company’s overall operations should they eventually receive an offer from
the company.

Other recruiting programs
Dominion’s recruiting efforts cover the entire gambit, from newspaper and
magazine advertisements, posting job openings internally, headhunters and
other agencies, and friends of present employees. In one case, a geophysicist
in Indonesia that Radtke had known and worked with previously was interested
in coming to the U.S. Dominion helped work out the logistics for the person
to work in the U.S. “He is a top notch geophysicist with a lot of deepwater
experience,” Radtke said.
Attracting professionals with several years of experience in the industry
could become a zero sum game in some ways. The company ﬁnds people from
majors who want to work for Dominion due to the smaller size of the company,
although Dominion is one of the larger independents with a CAPEX budget of
nearly $2 billion.
The company is one of the most active onshore drillers and one of the
premiere deepwater operators in the Gulf of Mexico, enabling the company to
offer a diversity of opportunities. As a result, numerous employees at Dominion
formerly worked for large majors.
Dominion also increased its participation in technical conferences such as
the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) and other technical symposiums.
They provide a mechanism not only for presenting technical papers but also
provide exposure and a forum to present advice and expertise to the industry
generally, resulting in higher awareness by other operators and partners.
Additionally, Dominion seeks engineers from other disciplines although not
necessarily from other industries. As an integrated company, Dominion has
ready access to a great talent pool from which to recruit and retain employees
that may not have direct E&P experience but have a solid engineering
background from other areas of the energy industry.
“We have looked at mechanical engineers that can move over to the E&P
side to work on designing facilities,” Radtke explained, “as well as chemical
engineers and occasionally a mining engineer.”

Mentoring interns and young professionals
Dominion’s interns are also mentored by seasoned professionals in the
company. A number of the company’s senior professionals work with the interns
in the program, providing guidance and experience for projects on which the
interns are involved. The mentors help coordinate the project and the interns
review the project with the mentors while exchanging ideas.
“It is important that we choose the right mentors for the interns,” Radtke
noted. “If you have a mentor who is 60 years old working with someone who
is 20 years old, they have to be able to relate to the young people. That is
very important.
“For us, we not only look at the technical expertise but the personalities as
well to work with young people.”

In addition to using present Dominion employees as mentors, the company
has given thought to seeking retired industry personnel that might be interested
in providing some time, a week per month, for example, for mentoring. They
could include people who have retired from other companies as well as
from Dominion.
“I think the industry is moving toward that type of solution to ﬁll in mentors,”
Radtke said.

Retention incentives reduce turnover
In the present tight labor market, companies are doing almost everything to
retain its brightest employees. Retention begins with an overall competitive
salary and beneﬁts package, including a 401K program offered by Dominion.
“You certainly have to have the competitive salaries and some kind of retention
package occasionally,” Radtke said.
“Salaries
will
increase
and there will be people
attracted to companies for
that,” he continued. “It’s
going to be a larger part of
our management problem
each year going forward.”
One
way
to
retain
employees is to structure
an incentive program that
is not front-end loaded but
tied more to the longevity
and/or performance of the
employee. If an employee is
at the company in two or three
years, for example, he or she
would receive an additional
incentive or bonus.
Radtke talks to the interns
and young professionals at Dominion to encourage and reinforce their
decisions not only to be a part of the industry but to be with Dominion E&P
as well. He mentions that they couldn’t be entering the industry at a more
opportune time, with great opportunities for advancement professionally
and personally.
“Technology advancements of the industry have been tremendous, and,
notwithstanding a lot of things people read,” Radtke said, “we have a
tremendous environmental and safety record.”
Part of the industry’s challenge is to impart that message and attract more
young people to the industry. But Radtke does see a positive change over
the past few years in the number of students taking an interest in the oil and
gas industry.
“It will be fascinating to have this same conversation in two or three years if
we continue to see the improvements,” he concluded. ◊

Dominion E&P provides a
diversity of opportunities for
its interns.

Schlumberger
hires
its
engineers as new graduates
from colleges and universities,
with some select positions
ﬁlled from the talent pool of
mid-career engineers. Midcareer professionals are hired
on a limited basis depending
upon the expertise they
possess and the company’s
requirements.
“Mid-career level professionals are limited in number,”
Alcoser
explained.
“We
certainly value our mid-career
hires and we are looking
to add them in different
functions.”
However, Alcoser estimates that between 80-90% of the company’s new hires
are recent university or college graduates.
“As such, nearly everyone starts straight out of a university and usually through
a ﬁeld engineer or R&D position,” he said. “We certainly value the experience
(of mid-career employees) but primarily Schlumberger promotes from within.”

For the most part,
Schlumberger hires
its engineers as new
graduates from colleges
and universities.

Recruiting at universities fills Schlumberger’s positions
Schlumberger has relationships with and visits numerous universities in the U.S.
during its recruiting efforts. “It’s all about having a presence at the universities
and communicating our message to the students,” Alcoser said, “and educating
them about Schlumberger and the opportunities we have to offer.”
While the company offers certain scholarships, the primary method for reaching
students and establishing long-term relationships with the universities is through
internships. This not only results in some of the brightest students interning for
the company, but it also continues to build the foundation and relationships the
company has with the various universities and professors.

While not giving away any hard ﬁgures, Alcoser said that the company “does
extremely well” in converting interns to new hires.
Also attracting new hires, as well
as some mid-career professionals,
is a competitive wage environment
in the industry, particularly for
engineering and hard sciences
(geology and physics, for example)
backgrounds.
The
company
believes it offers competitive
salaries but also says it’s the career
opportunities that go along with the competitive salaries that attract new hires.
“Certainly compensation plays a major role, but it is also about ensuring
the students understand all of the different aspects that we can offer them,”
Alcoser said.

Schlumberger is focused and well
positioned in its quest to fill its
required engineering positions
presently and in the future.

Training, career path development go hand-in-hand

Schlumberger trains its
new hires internally in its
schools worldwide.

14

Once a student is offered a position with Schlumberger he or she begins
a multi-year training program leading to a career path. When a new hire
completes the 30 to 36 month structured career development plan, depending
upon the segment or service they are entering, they will possess the level of
expertise for that particular
service. Schlumberger trains
its new hires internally in its
schools worldwide.
Additionally, the company
utilizes mentors for its interns
and new hires to assure that
the interns and new employees
are provided the necessary
support at the district level,
according to Alcoser.
Generally an employee
with a four-year degree in
an
engineering
program
who wants to become a ﬁeld
engineer will begin their careers
working for a client at the
wellsite, delivering a particular
service. “The engineer is given
enormous responsibility and autonomy early on in their career,” Alcoser said. “It
is extremely appealing to many of our prospective employees.”
The engineers would work in the ﬁeld for several years until they reach
a certain level of expertise. At that time, they would have opportunities to
move within different company functions and segments as well as various
geographic locations.
“The engineer’s future is based upon his performance, and that really
appeals to and challenges the individual to make the future what they can,”
Alcoser explained.

Educational background for various positions
The academic background of Schlumberger’s new hires depends, of course, on
the type of positions the company
needs to ﬁll. For example, with
ﬁeld engineers, the company
requires at least a four-year
degree. The actual curriculum
studies can vary as long as it leans
toward engineering and the hard
sciences. However, whether the
student has a mechanical, chemical or other background doesn’t matter as much
to Schlumberger as the company will provide its own training in preparation for
the individual to succeed in his endeavor.
The company also has positions in its research and development area,
which will generally require a Masters or Ph. D. These new hires will usually be
working in the company’s research setting, developing new technologies to be
implemented in the ﬁeld.
Schlumberger also hires what it calls ﬁeld specialists that work in the district
level. They remain in the ﬁeld longer than ﬁeld engineers in order to provide
additional continuity. The company usually hires qualiﬁed individuals with a twoyear technical degree to ﬁll those positions. ◊

Between 80–90% of Schlumberger’s
new hires are recent university or
college graduates.

Scorpion Offshore has certain advantages
in hiring the right people

“We are in a time where the growing demand for people is clearly going
to outstrip the current supply,” said Travis G. Fitts, Jr., Vice President, Human
Resources, Health, Safety & Environment for Scorpion Offshore in Houston.
Scorpion, ofﬁcially formed in April 2005 with ﬁve state-of-the-art jackup drilling
rigs under construction or on order in Brownsville, Texas, is in somewhat of a
unique position by having to acquire complete rigs crews for its new rigs right
out of the box.
“We realize that in order to satisfy the long-term requirements of the
company we are not going to be able to continue to go out into the market and
selectively recruit the people
that we need and want,” Fitts
explained. “We are going to
very quickly have to shift our
short term recruitment initiative
into a longer term people
development commitment.
“I believe the current
industry standard for required
experience is going to have to
be shortened,” he continued.
“If it is not, then we are not
going to be able to satisfy
future demand.”
The company is marketing all
of its rigs in international areas,
which presents international
labor issues and challenges.

Recruiting from the drilling industry
As a start-up company, Scorpion will be forced to recruit from the existing
labor market to establish its own employee foundation. The company says it
will be extremely selective regarding the people it brings into the organization,
realizing that this will be its best opportunity to establish its core culture
going forward.
The company says it should be able to satisfy part of its requirements for people
through recruitment from other industries with similar maintenance skill sets
(mechanical, electrical, hydraulic and maritime). For the drill crew compliment,
however, it’s a zero sum gain. “There are a ﬁnite number of people with drilling
industry experience, not enough to satisfy the future demand from the current
supply,” Fitts explained.
Scorpion will require around 80 people per rig, resulting in approximately 400
rig hands for its initial ﬁve rigs. Approximately 25% of the new rig crews are going

Offshore Jackups under

to require drilling experience to ﬁll the positions of Offshore Installation Manager
(OIM), Toolpusher, Driller, Assistant Driller, etc. Unlike Scorpion’s efforts to ﬁll
maintenance discipline positions, there is no other industry that the company
can turn to in order to ﬁll the senior level drill crew positions. The company
emphasizes that it must ﬁnd the right people in the beginning to perpetuate
its commitment to safety, personnel development, operational excellence, and
client satisfaction.
“There are many industries that we can draw from to bring in the required
skill sets and then teach them our systems,” he said, “but that’s not possible on
the drilling side of the business. There are no industries with similar skill sets to
draw from.
“The land rig business is booming as well and they are in the same boat as
ourselves. We are all ﬁshing from the same pond,” Fitts concluded.

Attracting and recruiting the right people
The company will utilize the services of Rigzone.com’s online employment
system in order to receive resumes. Scorpion will establish a site at the
online service’s website to post openings and positions available in order to
communicate them to the industry. While Scorpion will advertise and market
via other publications and media, the online service will be its primary means of
identifying possible candidates for ﬁlling positions.
The online service, in conjunction with third party consultant Performance
Enhancement Group, will sift the responses through various ﬁlters to assess
potential candidates and provide Scorpion with the best of the potential
employees. Scorpion will make ﬁnal selections from the culled list and invite
them to their Houston ofﬁce for interviewing and further screening.
Scorpion will also post ads and positions on its own website and through its
advertising efforts in trade press and other venues. However, those advertisements
for employment will direct the potential candidate to the online service as the
ﬁrst step in the lengthy hiring process.
“The requirement for people is an industry issue” Fitts said, “not just a
Scorpion issue. If Scorpion does not have the right opportunity for someone who
is interested in the offshore drilling industry, perhaps they can ﬁll a requirement
for one of our competitors.”
While the company will not directly recruit from high schools, it does have
hopes of being able to draw from them. The company will require a minimum
of a high school graduate or GED, preferably someone who has some heavy
industry background or experience, as well as people with a technical degree
from a junior college. Scorpion also hopes to establish relationships with several
technical schools for its longer term entry-level positions.
Recruitment will likely take place outside the contract drilling industry as well.
Former military personnel could be a good source for persons with technical
experience. Other potential candidates could include someone who has worked
in mechanical, hydraulics, or electrical positions on ships or other vessels.
Maritime academy graduates are also good potential employees.
“Certainly salary is one way to draw interest from prospective employees,” said
Anthony Gallegos, Scorpion’s Vice President, Business Development. “However,
if salary is the primary motivation for someone coming into an organization, then
that person may not be the best ﬁt for Scorpion.”
Gallegos noted that there appears to be less interest today in careers offshore

compared to 25 or 30 years ago. In order to draw attention to careers in the
industry, the industry will need to address the “premium” a worker receives for
entering the business (relative to other occupational options).
“Work in our industry requires much of people and often includes hardships
and sacriﬁces,” Gallegos said. “We cannot expect to attract and retain people if
we provide compensation and beneﬁts that are on par with what they can earn
while working near home and not enduring sacriﬁces and hardships.”
Higher wages should draw more people to the industry. “Our ability to grow
as an organization and satisfy the requirement for people will be a function of
where we draw the people from, their commitment and ability to learn, and how
quickly we can mentor and develop their competence and ability to take on
increasing levels of responsibility,” Fitts said.

Training, development will reduce turnover
While the company would prefer that potential employees possess
certain training certiﬁcations prior to joining the company, some of the
requirements are company speciﬁc, with training to be conducted to certain
Scorpion requirements.
The company sees itself as
fortunate to have the luxury
of being able to train its crews
prior to the new rigs’ delivery
from the shipyard. This not
only includes training for rig
operations but also orientation
about the company, its safety
expectations and culture.
Senior management will visit
the rig construction site and
participate in the orientation/
training sessions with the new
crews to assure those messages
are communicated clearly.
Scorpion intends to utilize
third party training and schools
for certain rig operations and
technical training. These will likely include rig moving, well control, mechanical
and electrical speciﬁc training as well as certain marine licensing requirements.
To a large degree, Scorpion’s success in training and development is dependent
on their ability to select the right people who are capable of coaching, mentoring,
and developing other crew members. This is particularly true for international
operations where non-supervisory rig hands have not been processed through
Scorpion’s screening procedures.
“Much like the rest of the industry, we will use third party contractors
internationally for our non-supervisory entry level positions,” Fitts said. “That
shouldn’t present a problem as long as we have the right supervisors that are
able to communicate our expectations to them and provide training and develop
competence to an acceptable level.
“We believe we can do that through our training and development process
incorporating our on-the-job training program.”

Scorpion Offshore estimates
it will require 400 new
employees to crew its ﬁve
rigs under construction.

Offering careers is only one retention tool
The quick answer to retaining employees is to have a competitive compensation
and beneﬁt package. “More importantly, the key to success is to focus on people
and their development,” Fitts explained.
“If all we are doing is providing more money than another company, we would
be passively recruiting people,” he continued. “I would much rather actively
recruit people to join the company that want a career and not just a job.
“If you ﬁnd people that want a career they are going to be less likely to leave
the company as long as we fulﬁll our commitment to them with regards to
training, development and advancement opportunities,” Fitts concluded.
Internationally, rig supervisors will have a responsibility to bring national rig
hands to the company’s standard from a technical and HSE standpoint but they
should also work on developing their career as far as moving to the next level of
responsibility on the rig.
“If we begin expanding our ﬂeet and operations in those (international) areas,
we want to be able to promote and develop from within,” Fitts said.
As a new company, Scorpion believes it will be able to provide new crew
members with a great number of opportunities. And as long as the company
provides the training and resources to meet career ambitions, and the company
is competitive from a compensation standpoint, employees should be motivated
to stay with the company.
“We think that personnel development, which we know we will have to have
in order to be successful, is also going to act as a great incentive for retaining
people if we get it right, and we will get it right,” Fitts emphasized. ◊

Recent graduates, professionals fulfill
Baker Hughes’ engineering requirements

Baker Hughes recruits recent university graduates and mid-career
professionals to bring engineering talent into the company. Extensive training
and development programs, as well as varied job assignments, are part of the
company’s strategy to provide career advancement opportunities and retain top
performing employees.

University programs include internships, research programs
University recruiting at Baker Hughes not only includes traditional campus
interviews and participation in career fairs, but also involves signiﬁcant programs
to build relationships with technical colleges and universities in 30 countries
around the world.
The company sponsors internships, scholarships and endowments as well as
partnering with the universities to conduct industry-related research projects. The
research projects provide students with an opportunity to study their technical
discipline while also conducting research on elements of the E&P business.
“You can’t have a strong university program based entirely on summer
internships,” said Diana Rose-Schilling, Human Resources Manager for Baker
Hughes in Houston. “For the remainder of the year we want to be sure they are
getting experience that would be beneﬁcial to the industry and Baker Hughes.
“Assuring they have a background in the industry and some research project
experience will only help them as they begin their career,” she added.
The company works with engineering professors and college deans at
several universities to support industry-related research projects. Baker Hughes
suggests project topics that would be mutually beneﬁcial to the company, the
students and the universities, and then meets with the faculty to discuss putting
the research project into the curriculum.
In addition to working with engineering departments at U.S. universities, the
company partners with universities in Europe, Russia, Asia, the Middle East,
Africa and Latin America to develop local engineering talent in major oil and
gas producing regions.
In 2006, Baker Hughes sponsored 365 internships for students from universities
in the U.S., Canada, Venezuela, Brazil, Norway, Ecuador, the U.K., Germany and
Nigeria. The company is currently creating an internship program in the Middle
East. Students typically intern in countries where they are attending college.
During the internship each student works with a mentor, who ensures that the
intern has the opportunity to work with experienced service company personnel
and helps guide the student during the work and research program.
Engineering design interns work primarily with the company’s technology
developers and work on research projects where they apply what they have
learned in the classroom.
Interns at the company’s ﬁeld locations learn about and work with various drilling,
logging and completion technologies and can assist during operations at the well site.

Opportunities for mid-career engineers
Baker Hughes also recruits mid-career engineers and scientists with
backgrounds in mechanical, electrical, chemical, reservoir and petroleum
engineering, as well as geology and petrophysics.
“We offer these technical experts the opportunity to develop and apply
advanced technology,” Rose-Schilling says. “They also are attracted by the
opportunity to perform work assignments throughout the world.
“The company has increased
its efforts to attract technical
professionals in the Eastern
Hemisphere to support growing
activity there.”

Investment in training
and development

substantial investment in training

programs. Baker Hughes delivers
technical training at major education
centers in the U.S., Europe and Latin
America. A new training complex is
being built in Dubai to serve as the company’s education hub for the Eastern
Hemisphere. The company also offers more than 3,000 courses on its online
training resource.
Baker Hughes engineers also develop their career through non-technical
instruction, including its new Cornerstone Program that prepares qualiﬁed
men and women for management and leadership positions. Baker Hughes
also empowers its employees to continue their education, according to RoseSchilling. This could include certiﬁcations or advanced degrees, supported by
the company’s tuition reimbursement program.
Perhaps the most important aspect of career development at Baker Hughes is
the opportunity to take on new job assignments in different functions, different
operating divisions, and different countries. “Young engineers can learn a lot
with a variety of challenging assignments,” Rose-Schilling said, “and they can
advance quickly.”
“This is a key factor in retaining employees,” she continued. “Employees who
see opportunities for advancement are more likely to stay with Baker Hughes.”

Corporate culture fosters employee retention
Baker Hughes works to provide a competitive compensation package including
salaries, beneﬁts and incentive pay. “Just as important as compensation,” RoseSchilling said, “is a corporate culture that values employees and encourages
their development. Our corporate culture is based on shared core values and
the belief that every employee can make a difference.
“Our CEO and COO are committed to the people in our organization,” she
said. “We believe that valuing our employees, providing growth opportunities,
and recognizing their contributions are important ways to make them want to
stay with the company.” ◊

PennEnergyJOBS aids job seekers and employers

There are literally hundreds if not thousands of online job banks and recruiting
services that cover virtually any and all occupations. Many of these online services
are considered to be generalist job sites which provide employer job listings
worldwide and for virtually all occupations, from burger
ﬂippers to petroleum engineers. One online job board
boasted more than 2 million jobs available across virtually all
occupational categories. Additionally, most state and local
governments in the U.S. also operate their own employment
sites online.
One problem with such vast online job sites is that they
require the job seeker to cull through thousands of jobs in
numerous industries in order to ﬁnd the right one for them.
For example, someone seeking an accounting position might
be overwhelmed by the amount of opportunities available
around the world listed on some of the websites. Spending
time on generalist job boards is not a very productive
approach to managing one’s career.

Industry specific online services
for career management
Industry speciﬁc online job boards, often referred to as
niche job boards, tend to focus on only one industry rather
than trying to be everything to everyone. Niche job boards
typically provide better services and information to manage
a career and stay abreast of new job opportunities and career
issues in the speciﬁc industry that it serves. They also have
a deeper understanding of their industry than a generalist
job board, and as such can tailor their services and provide
better research, database and career information to their
target audience.
“Employers are constantly faced with a signiﬁcant challenge
of ﬁnding good, qualiﬁed talent,” said Jamie Matlin, Director
of Recruitment advertising for PennEnergyJOBS, a niche job board speciﬁcally
for the energy industry. “It is this common issue that is fueling the recruitment
industries’ need to develop better recruitment tools.
“One of our core advantages is the size and demographics of the PennWell
readership, which enables PennEnergyJOBS to reach a large audience of both
industry employers and job seekers,” he said. “It is our three-pronged approach
of online, in-person and in-print that sets us apart from our competitors.
“We are focused around career management and development,” he
continued, and emphasized that even if a professional is not actively seeking a
job presently, it is still strategic from a career management perspective to have
a proﬁle and resume online.

PennEnergyJOBS serves petroleum employers and professionals by providing
an exchange and information service that includes job postings, resume
searching, advertising, electronic newsletters, targeted email campaigns and
career fairs. The service is free for industry professionals
and allows them to search through thousands of jobs, post
their resumes (with various levels of discretion) and apply to
opportunities that interest them with a click of the mouse.
Industry professionals can also stay current with the latest
job postings by setting up job alerts that provide instant
notiﬁcation through email when new positions become
available. The number of job postings by employers varies
between 2,000 and 3,000 worldwide.
PennEnergyJOBS’ targeted industry segments in the
petroleum industry include:
• Drilling;
• Exploration;
• Gas processing;
• Petrochemicals;
• Pipelines and transportation;
• Production;
• Reﬁning.

Job seekers can search positions offered
Job seekers can enter the website and search for job
openings in the various industry segments, post their resume
and proﬁle online and apply to job postings online directly
to the employers seeking personnel. The service sees itself
as a medium that facilitates the resume submission process
to the employers.
If the job seeker wishes, his or her contact information can
be blocked on their resume to offer the highest levels of
discretion in their job search. In this case, if a prospective
employer is interested in the candidate, the employer
would contact them through the PennEnergyJOBS system via email. It is then
up to the job seeker to decide whether he wants to reply back to the employer.
This prevents someone’s present employer from knowing that he is actively or
passively seeking another job.
Job seekers can locate positions within desired areas, for example, within a
certain radius of the job site or ofﬁce. Job seekers can also search for postings
by job categories and work type, including full or part time or contract work. The
database can also be searched chronologically by the date of the job posting
and whether the job was posted directly by the employer or a stafﬁng ﬁrm,
among other ﬁlters. Search results are ﬁrst displayed by relevancy to the search
and then in chronological order by the most recent job posting.
Job seekers can also set up email job alerts whereby they can be notiﬁed
immediately when a new job is posted that meets their criteria, eliminating
the need to search through the database on a daily or weekly basis. The alerts
can be set up to be sent daily, weekly or monthly. When a new job is posted
that meets the seekers’ criteria, he or she will automatically be alerted by an
email that contains the job title, the company posting the new job opening, the

resume is already posted to the system, all the job seeker need do if he is
interested in the job opening is to click the apply button.

Significant system features
The PennEnergyJOBS’ advanced search capabilities contain several features
that aid in the employers’ or job seekers’ search. The software enabling the
searches uses matching technology to search for similar words. For example,
an employer may be seeking a Professional Engineer, so his search will seek
candidates by those speciﬁc words as well as “PE”. This matching technology
is also available for the job seeker. Additionally, the software builds on this
intelligent database and continually adds synonyms.
PennEnergyJOBS is also fully compliant with the latest ruling put forth by
the Ofﬁce of Federal Contract Compliance Program (OFCCP) pertaining to the
deﬁnition of an online candidate. The system facilitates the entire process of
tracking and retaining resumes that were considered or viewed by the employer.
The OFCCP compliance capability in the system’s software tracks all searches
by an employer and retains copies of the resumes resulting from the searches.
At any given time, according to Matlin, PennEnergyJOBS can provide member
employers with the documentation required to prove compliance with OFCCP
standards as they relate to being an Equal Opportunity Employer (EOE). ◊

Some people spend their whole
life looking for the perfect job.
You don’t have to wait that long.
If you’re a creative self-starter who thrives on seeing your concepts and ideas developed
and drilled, you’d fit right in at EOG. We reward the contributions of individuals who make
things happen in our fast-paced, teamwork-oriented, decentralized environment.
Our company is small enough to be personal and large enough to pursue an extensive
annual drilling program. In fact, EOG’s dynamic production growth through the drillbit has
earned us the reputation as an industry leader. We’re one of the largest and most
successful oil and gas companies in the United States, based in Houston, with operations
also in Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom.

ideas to the test:

SPAIN SEARCHES FOR ALTERNATIVE
ENERGY SOURCES

A

Spanish companies set the pace with new
technologies in the race to find
alternative solutions to the traditional
practice of burning coal and fossil fuels
for energy consumption in Europe

As Spain and Europe face the rising demand for energy and the high
costs of fuel, plans that call for a diverse and stable supply of energy
are a top priority. One such project is that of Elcogas, which is a
Power Station of 335 MW based on coal gasification integration in
a combined cycle plant that reduces atmospheric emissions.
Elcogas President Mr. José Damian Bogas Gálvez states “The plant
has demonstrated its technical and economic viability while
completing the required objectives of capacity and output using a
diverse range of fuel.”
Its technology has had the most favourable results for the capture
of carbon dioxide and the benefits for the environment are
obvious. Elcogas proposes a more than reasonable alternative to
diversify risk, improve the environment and maintain profitability.

The integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant in the
Spanish city of Puertollano.

Mr. Bogas continues, “Without a doubt this technology will form
a part of the energy solution “mix” of this century. Coal exists in
abundance but we must make plants that respect the
environment, I am convinced that an effort must be made for the
diversification of supply and the consumer will choose to pay for
this cleaner energy.”

Interview with Mr. Carlos Pérez de BricIo, chairman & ceo of cepsa

H

Q: How would you define the philosophy of CEPSA as one of the
leading Spanish brands?
A: CEPSA is the oldest petroleum company in
Spain and last year we were proud to celebrate
our 75th anniversary. As you may know, CEPSA
began in the Canary Islands because at that time
there was a monopoly held by the state oil
company CAMPSA in the Peninsula and Balearic
Islands. But over time, with the eradication of the
Spanish monopoly, CEPSA finally found itself
in a market where it could expand its activities Mr. Carlos Pérez de
and hence, took advantage of the situation and Bricio, Chairman &
launched a massive campaign, which included the CEO of Cepsa
expansion of our refining capacity. CEPSA´s
refineries throughout the years have always been noted for their profitability
and are equipped with petrochemicals processes in order to maximize the
efficiency of each plant. What started out as a single refinery ended up being
the largest private Spanish oil company. This expansion proved to be the
national phenomenon that CEPSA is today. The fact that CEPSA was born in
the Canaries, and had to supply a significant amount of fuel to the airlines and
maritime sectors, also had a large influence on the development of its
bunkering business.

requirements that European organizations have demanded from oil,
energy, and petrochemical companies with regards to the environmental
specifications of refined oil products has also contributed to major
investments. This new investment will be allocated towards increasing the
diesel production capacity of the Huelva Refinery by 2.7 million tons.

Q: CEPSA has announced an investment of more than 1 billion Euros
into its refining capacity. What does such a large investment represent
for the company?
A: It is an important subject for us, but it should not be overly-emphasized.
Large investments have been a constant part of CEPSA’s development. The
fact that CEPSA has had to adapt its facilities and processes to the different

Q: Due to the liberalization of the market many Spanish energy
companies have expanded their activities, what about CEPSA?
A: CEPSA, as a private company, was not a gas importer but this activity
was always something we considered. Finally, five years ago, along with
the Chairman of the Algerian company Sonatrach, we launched the
construction of another gas pipeline and it was a project that only 10 years
ago would have been unprecedented. In the
Mediterranean there is only one gas pipeline
feeding Spain. Therefore, building the pipeline
that we were actually planning, one that would
consist of about 200 km, was at that time an
authentic adventure! Obviously by today’s
standards such an undertaking would not be
considered such an “adventure”, mainly due to
the great depth of the gas pipeline layout on
the sea bottom. The Medgaz pipeline will
actually start operations in 2009 and initially
will fulfil the same necessities as the existing Algerian pipelines.
one, but with some additional advantages: it
will have direct access to Spain without passing through a third country,
and it will double the quantity of gas. CEPSA will import approximately
1,600,000 cubic meters of gas through this Medgaz pipeline, which
represents 5% of the entire Spanish market.

Paving the Way in LNG

Bunkering in Ceuta

Considering the significant projected increase in the world demand,
Repsol YPF has identified the area of LNG as one of the pillars of the
company's future growth and as new technological developments
lead to continued discoveries, Repsol YPF is investing heavily in the
sector in order to reap the benefits in the medium and long-term.
As a leader in the global LNG field, Repsol YPF currently has projects
underway in Canada, Algeria, Peru, Mexico and the Middle East, and
significant LNG-related investments in Trinidad and Tobago which
are classified as being a “core business area”. The stream joint venture
between Repsol YPF and Gas Natural is ranked third in the global
LNG trade in terms of signed LNG contracts, and the companies are
leaders in the Atlantic Basin.
In addition to the above, Repsol YPF has said that it is in talks with
Gazprom regarding the possibility of entering an LNG project in
Russia, and is also involved in projects in Mexico.

Atlantic LNG, Trinidad and Tobago.

Enlargement of the Port of Ceuta.
The entire economy of Ceuta depends directly or indirectly on the
Port and its activities and due to the geographical location of Ceuta,
the Port continues to be the only way to reach the rest of Spain. It is
also the entry and exit point for most goods and provides the
foundation for most commercial activities.
The existing infrastructure is excellent for
the bunkering of ships and is a proud
reflection of the importance that this
activity represents for the Port.
The competitive advantages that the Port
of Ceuta offers, with respect to its
competitors, is the quality service that
can be found throughout the facility in all
Mr. José Torrado López,
areas such as: infrastructure, machinery,
President of Ceuta Port
and labour force. The Port’s objective is
Authority
to attract and meet the needs of the small
and medium tankers that use intermediate
fuels. This unique specialization in the servicing and supplying of
small moored boats has no equivalent in the Straight of Gibraltar
and the Port is considered to be the least congested in the Straight.

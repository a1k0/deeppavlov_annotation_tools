API, NPRA question EPA’s proposed ozone limits oil spilled after a tanker-barge collision Jan. 23 (OGJ Online, Jan.
Two witnesses from oil industry trade associations separately
questioned the US Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to significantly toughen ground-level ozone emission limits as they testified at EPA hearings in Houston and Arlington, Va.
EPA’s own science does not even support such a move, according to Ted Steichen, a policy advisor at the American Petroleum
Institute, and David Friedman, environmental affairs director at
the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association.
Neither EPA’s review in 2008 nor more recent studies justify
lowering the standard based on the health effects of exposure,
Friedman continued in his prepared statement at the hearing in
Arlington. “The science…during the 2008 review and the latest
studies have not changed the earlier conclusion. In fact, in the
current reconsideration, EPA indicates that it will rely only on the
previous record and not consider any new evidence,” he said.
Testifying in Houston, Steichen emphasized progress that has
been made improving the nation’s air quality in large part through
oil and gas industry efforts. More efforts will follow under the
existing ozone standards because of pollution controls which are
in place or which soon will be implemented, he said.
Cleaner fuels brought to market now and in the future will
result in cleaner air for decades to come as cleaner engines are put
in place, Friedman said in his prepared statement. “We will see
cars and trucks producing significantly lower emissions. In addition, emissions from power plants will be cut in half by 2015. The
current National Ambient Air Quality ozone standard is working,”
he said.
Moving forward with significantly lower ozone limits if there
are no demonstrable benefits could unnecessarily increase energy
costs, cut jobs, and reduce domestic energy development and energy security, he continued. “These rules represent a stop sign on
the road to economic recovery, and will lead to further loss of
American manufacturing jobs and increased reliance on imported
gasoline and diesel fuel,” Friedman warned.

26, 2009).
Closure of the waterway caused minor disruption of refinery
operations at Port Arthur and nearby Beaumont.
About 462,000 gal of crude entered the water when a barge
being pushed by the Dixie Vengeance towing vessel punctured the
hull of the 95,660-dwt Eagle Otome tanker.
Cause of the collision remained unclear after the US Coast
Guard raised doubts about earlier reports that the tanker had lost
power. USCG said three tugs escorted the damaged tanker to the
Sunoco Inc. terminal at Beaumont for discharge of the remaining
cargo.
“We are doing everything we can to provide much-needed
relief to the region’s four large refineries,” said USCG Capt. J.J.
Plunkett, captain of the port and federal on-scene coordinator for
the response.

House bill reintroduced to recover royalties

Two US House members reintroduced legislation that they said
could recover as much as $54 billion in federal offshore royalty
payments that were mistakenly exempt in the late 1990s.
The measure would require producers that hold such leases
to renegotiate terms before being able to bid on newly offered
tracts. The leases originally were issued without a requirement to
pay federal royalties to stimulate Gulf of Mexico deepwater exploration and development. They were erroneously exempted from
royalty payments when price thresholds were omitted from 1996
to 2000.
“Instead of oil companies drilling for free on public land, we
should be drilling for deficit dollars by fixing this taxpayer ripoff,” said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who chairs the House
Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.
“Half of our trade deficit in 2008 was from buying foreign oil,
and $54 billion of our national budget deficit could be solved by
keeping oil companies honest.”
The bill’s cosponsor, Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who coSabine Neches Waterway reopens after spill
chairs the bipartisan Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency
The Sabine Neches Waterway at Port Arthur, Tex., has been re- Caucus, said that the bill would close what he termed a “costly,
opened to limited tanker traffic while clean-up continues of crude special interest loophole.” ✦

Gulfsands to develop Syria’s Yousefieh oil field
European unconventional gas attracts firms
The Ukraine unit of EuroGas Inc., New York, acquired three
unconventional gas concessions in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas basin
and increased activities in the Lublin basin that extends from Poland into western Ukraine.
The acquisition brings to five the number of shale gas and coalbed methane concessions held by EuroGas Ukraine Ltd. in eastern Ukraine under a joint activity agreement with Nadra Luganshchiny Ltd.
The five concessions total 512 sq km, and the largest, Marijewvskogo Poligon, covers 251 sq km. Horizontal drilling is to start
this year.
Meanwhile, EuroGas GMBH signed a memorandum of understanding to explore for unconventional gas, such as shale and CBM
gas, in the Lublin basin where it was the first foreign company to
successfully drill a CBM well in the Ukrainian sector in the late
1990s.
Meanwhile, Realm Energy International Corp., Vancouver, BC,
said it applied for oil and gas rights in eight undisclosed basins in

Gulfsands Petroleum PLC expects to bring Syria’s Yousefieh oil
field on stream in early April. Gulfsands holds 50% interest and is
the operator.
Recently, Syrian authorities granted Gulfsands a 25-year production license and a 10-year extension option. Yousefieh is 3 km
east of Khurbet East field.
Production of 23º gravity oil is expected from two wells,
Yousefieh 1 and Yousefieh 3, at an initial combined rate of up to
1,000 b/d.
Planning is under way to install permanent down-hole artificial lift equipment in both Yousefieh wells this year.
Yousefieh, on Block 26, was discovered in November 2008
(OGJ, Nov. 24, 2008, Newsletter).
At yearend 2008, Yousefieh was estimated to contain 11 million bbl of proved plus probable reserves. Gulfsands plans to issue a reserves update during the second quarter 2010. Another
development well on Yousefieh is planned for 2010. Gulfsands
anticipates Yousefieh production will reach about 6,000 b/d by
2012. ✦

The Papa Terra Joint Venture has let contracts for construction
and installation of the P-61 tension-leg wellhead platform (TLWP)
in the deepwater oil field for which it recently revived development off Brazil (OGJ, Feb. 1, 2010, Newsletter).
The TLWP, to be installed in 3,900 ft of water 70 miles offshore
in the southern Campos basin, will be the first facility of its kind
off Brazil. It will produce 14-17° gravity crude into a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel with production capacity
of 140,000 b/d.
Partners Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), operator, and Chevron Corp. had suspended Papa Terra development in early 2009
because of business conditions.
J. Ray McDermott SA reported the contract award as part of a

Guara pilot production FPSO chartered
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) along with partners BG
Group and Repsol YPF SA signed a letter of intent with the Schahin Group and Modec Inc. for a 20-year charter and operation of
a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel that will be
used for the Guara pilot production.
Guara is a presalt oil discovery in the Santos basin on Block
BM-S-9 off Brazil.
The FPSO will have 65% Brazilian content and be capable of
handling 120,000 bo/d and 5 million cu m/day of gas. Conversion
work on the hull will take place outside of Brazil while several
modules will be integrated in Brazil.
Petrobras expects Guara to go on stream in late 2012.
Flow tests, limited by equipment capacity, on the Guara presalt
discovery well 1-SPS-55 (1-BRSA-594), in 2,141 m of water, produced at about 7,000 bo/d and Petrobras estimates that the well
initially could produce at about 50,000 bo/d (OGJ, Sept. 14, 2009,
Newsletter). Petrobras believes that the area contains about 1.1-2
billion bbl of recoverable 30° gravity oil.
Operator Petrobras holds a 45% interest in the block. The remaining interest is held by BG 30% and Repsol YPF 25%.

Tullow plans Ugandan oil production this year
Tullow Oil PLC plans to begin oil production from its Uganda
fields this year, starting at 500-1,000 b/d and rising to 10,000 b/d
next year before reaching 150,000 b/d in 2015.
Initial production at midyear will not be “economically significant, but it is a great step forward for Ugandans to know that their
oil is being used for industrial use,” said Tullow Chief Operations
Officer Paul McDade.
“We would like to produce oil on a test basis to see how the oil
wells behave and how the crude can be transported by truck since
it is waxy. We will have to heat the oil to keep it flowing,” said
McDade. The oil will be produced from Block 2, which is 100%
owned by Tullow.
McDade said Tullow plans to invest $300-400 million in the
initial phase, rising to $5 billion to reach the 150,000 b/d level. He
said initial production will be used for local industry and power
generation.
In addition to Block 2, Tullow has a 50% stake in Block 1 and in
Block 3A. Tullow Uganda Ltd. recently entered into an agreement
with Heritage Oil & Gas Ltd. and Heritage Oil PLC to purchase
their entire interest in Blocks 1 and 3A (OGJ Online, Jan. 28, 2010)
Anticipating its takeover of the Heritage blocks, Tullow is con-

Processing

sidering farm outs. According to McDade, the two companies
that Tullow prefers to work with are China National Offshore Oil
Corp. and Total SA. “The Chinese are best in building refineries,
and they move fast. CNOOC has just built a big refinery in China
[that] can refine the same quality of oil as in Uganda. They built it
in a period of 2 years.”
Tullow recently announced plans to sell more than 80 million
shares, equivalent to 10% of the outstanding equity in the company, to accelerate plans to develop huge oil discoveries in the Lake
Albert Rift basin. Tullow Chief Financial Officer Ian Springett said
the cash would also be used to help to buy out Heritage Oil’s stake.

Production rising at Mangala field in India
Oil production from Mangala field in Rajasthan, India, has
reached 20,000 b/d from five wells as work progresses to expand
capacity of a processing terminal, reports Cairn Energy PLC.
The field, part of a complex that includes nearby Bhagyam and
Aishwariya fields, started up last August and averaged 15,430 b/d
in fourth quarter 2009 (OGJ, Sept. 7, 2009, Newsletter).
A 30,000-b/d train is on line at the Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT), which eventually will have four trains with total capacity of 205,000 b/d and room for expansion. Approved plateau
production for the complex is 175,000 b/d.
Start-up of two more trains will expand MPT capacity to
125,000 b/d by the end of June.
Production now moves by truck to the Gujarat coast for shipment in heated tankers to refineries operated by Reliance Industries Ltd. and Mangalore Refining & Petrochemicals Ltd.
Cairn India is commissioning a 590-km, 32-in. insulated pipeline between the MPT and Salaya, near RIL’s 660,000-b/d and
580,000-b/d refineries at Jamnagar, heated to keep the crude oil
temperature above 65° C.
At Mangala, the company has drilled 45 producing wells, of
which 33 have been completed in the Paleocene Fatehgarh formation and are producing or awaiting start-up. Three of the wells
are horizontal. The company has been operating two rigs and a
completion unit in the Mangala development area and soon will
add a third rig.
Cairn also has drilled eight wells in Raageshwari Deep gas
field, production from which combines with Mangala associated
gas to fuel steam turbine generators at the MPT and heaters for the
crude pipeline. The company said one Raageshwari well, Raag-14,
tested gas at a field-high rate of 15.7 MMscfd after a hydraulic frac.
Construction is complete on the Raageshwari gas terminal,
about 80 km south-southeast of the MPT, and facilities 20 km
southeast of the MPT to produce water for secondary recovery.
Cairn has a pilot project testing enhanced recovery with polymer and alkaline-surfactant-polymer injection, which the company estimates might boost recovery from the Mangala complex
by 300 million bbl. ✦

Foster Wheeler to study Ugandan refinery
The Ugandan government has let contract to Foster Wheeler
AG’s Global Engineering & Construction Group for a feasibility
study of a 150,000-b/d refinery, which would be Uganda’s first.
The Ministry of Energy and Minerals Development last year
disclosed plans to study a 50,000-b/d refinery, saying production
from recent Ugandan discoveries might reach 100,000 b/d (OGJ,

Aug. 10, 2009, Newsletter). The country produces no crude oil at
present.
The Foster Wheeler study will cover location and configuration
of a refinery and options for oil-field development, crude transportation, and evaluation of alternatives to refinery construction
such as pipeline export. Completion is due in midyear.

QP awards NGL control system contract
Qatar Petroleum has let a contract to Cegelec of Paris to replace,
over the next 18 months the turbine and compressor control system for two NGL production trains in Mesaieed, Qatar.
Under the $15 million contract, an integrated GE-Mark VI system will replace the existing pneumatic control system for Trains
1 and 2, the Cegelec announcement said. In addition, the existing
fire-protection system will be replaced with a water-mist system
interfaced with the new control system.
This contract follows an earlier $40 million turnkey contract
awarded to Cegelec to design and build a blast-proof control
building at the QAPCO petrochemical complex, also in Mesaieed.
Cegelec has also provided technical assistance and commissioning for Phase 2 of the common water-cooling system in Ras
Laffan, where the end customer was QP. ✦

Golar, PTTEP cancel FLNG project off Australia
Golar LNG Energy, Bermuda, and Thailand’s PTTEP have cancelled their heads of agreement and joint study agreement signed
last year to develop a floating LNG (FLNG) project off northwest
Australia.
At the same time, the two companies also announced termination of a memorandum of understanding for the global cooperation to identify and develop other FLNG projects.
The Australian part of the agreement to enter into front-end
engineering and design studies for the FLNG project on a 50-50
basis was signed in July 2009.
The plan was to develop stranded gas reserves in the Timor
Sea originally found by BHP Petroleum Ltd. in the 1980s and then
bought by Coogee Resources before PTTEP took over Coogee in
late 2008. The main gas fields are Cash, Maple, Biliara, Tahbilk,
Pathaway, and Montara.
The companies have not revealed a reason for the split, but
Golar LNG says it will continue to pursue FLNG projects that fit
its financial objectives and technical capabilities. The company
added it still believes highly cost-efficient approaches to gas development based on FLNG are the key to substantial additional
growth opportunities.

Alaska Pipeline Project files for open season
The Alaska Pipeline Project (APP) filed its plan with the US
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval to conduct
its open season on a potential pipeline to move natural gas from
the Alaskan North Slope to Alberta and on to the US. Members of
the public can provide comment through the month of February.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Pending approval, APP will finalize its open season and provide
it to potential shippers at the end of April for assessment through
July.
Two options will be submitted for shipper assessment in the
open season. The first option is a 1,700-mile pipeline from ANS to
Alberta, from where the gas could be delivered on existing pipeline systems to the US. The second option would transport gas 800
miles from ANS to Valdez, Alas., where it would be converted to
LNG in a facility to be built by others and then delivered by ship
to North American and other international markets.
Both options would allow off-take by Alaskan customers. Both
also would include a gas treatment plant and a 58-mile pipeline
from Point Thomson fields to the plant and main transmission
line.
The results of the open season will determine the preferred
development option. The open season process initiated with
FERC applies to the US portion of the project. A separate but
coordinated open season will occur for the Canadian portion of
the project.
Updated cost estimates for the project are $32-41 billion for the
ANS-to-Alberta option, and $20-26 billion for the Valdez option.
Both options have an expected in-service date of 2020 and would
provide capacity of either 4.5 bcfd (Alberta) or 3 bcfd (Valdez).
The project is a joint effort among TransCanada Corp. and ExxonMobil Corp. under the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act. ExxonMobil reaffirmed its commitment to this project, despite recent
North American unconventional gas acquisitions, earlier this
week (OGJ Online, Jan. 25, 2009).
Denali—a consortium of BP PLC and ConocoPhillips—will
submit its open season package to FERC in April. ✦

Obama’s message
President Barack Obama to the US oil and gas
industry: Get out of town. That’s the message in
the president’s budget proposal for fiscal 2011.
Obama doesn’t like fossil energy. He thinks
anything that encourages production of fossil
energy impedes development of what his budget
narrative hails as the “clean energy economy.” So
he wants to tax away oil and gas.
Obama proposes the same errors on oil and
gas that he offered in his fiscal 2010 offering but
failed to push through Congress. The repetition
is portentous. It means last year’s menu of economic poison represented more than bumbling by
beginners. Obama and his team have had a year
to learn. Yet they reject any lesson that challenges
their activist agenda. Obama proved his recalcitrance by promising, in his state-of-the-union
speech Jan. 27, to keep promoting an unpopular,
state-centered, and now politically disastrous program for health care reform.

Their elimination would hurt small producers,

The big companies take their spankings elsewhere. Obama’s proposal would repeal the manufacturer’s tax credit for oil and gas companies
while leaving it intact for other industries. And
the proposal assumes passage of cap-and-trade
legislation to limit greenhouse-gas emissions, the
version of which the House passed last year would

Chinese oil and gas companies have
boosted their investments abroad since
2008 despite the global economic
downturn, having committed billions
of dollars into developing large fields in
the Middle East and elsewhere.
“Looking ahead, the Chinese oil
and gas companies will undoubtedly
continue their aggressive investments
in oversea oil and gas assets, either
through corporate acquisitions
or bidding rounds,” said a January brief from FACTS Global
Energy, based in Singapore.
Liutong Zhang and Kang
Wu wrote the brief entitled
“China’s Overseas Oil and Gas
Investment.”
They said China’s equity (net) oil
production from its overseas operations
in 2008 was 900,000 b/d. Although
less that half of that actually reached
China, the overseas production volume accounted for 25% of China’s total
crude oil imports, 23% of domestic oil
production, and 12.5% of oil consumption.
Chinese companies’ net oil production abroad is expected to reach
1.2 million b/d this year. The FACTS
analysts forecast China’s net overseas oil
production at 1.7 million b/d by 2015
and 2 million b/d by 2020.
“With a flat domestic production, by
2020 the overseas equity oil could account [for] half of China’s domestic oil
production,” they said.

companies since late 2008. CNPC and
its subsidiary, PetroChina Co. Ltd.,
currently are involved in more than 90
overseas projects, of which 65 involve
oil or gas production and development.
Their 2008 net oil production from
production outside China was 612,000
b/d of oil and 450 MMscfd of gas.
CNPC also has invested to build
pipelines to import oil and gas from
overseas, and it moved toward its goal
of becoming an international company
by buying Singapore Petroleum Co. (see
Table 1).
The company and its subsidiaries
hold stakes in oil and gas assets in 27
countries and provide field services,
engineering, and construction in 49
countries worldwide.
CNPC-PetroChina concentrated their
overseas investments in Africa, central
Asia, Latin America, and the Middle
East.
China National Offshore Oil Corp.
(CNOOC) follows CNPC-PetroChina
in its overseas investment while China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec)
is third among Chinese companies in
its international holdings.
In addition, state oil trading company Sinochem Group has begun
investing abroad. Separately, the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange
and China Investment Corp. (CIC)
also are acquiring interests in overseas
ventures.
“There is no doubt that CNPC-Petrochina, CNOOC, Sinopec, and Sinochem
have become important players in the
global merger and acquisition market,”
FACTS said. “Nonetheless, the Chinese
oil companies suffered a series of setbacks in 2009.”
The Libyan government blocked
CNPC International Ltd.’s proposed
$499 million (Can.) takeover of
Verenex Energy Inc. of Calgary. Instead,
the Libyan Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund, acquired Verenex
for $316 million (Can.).
Elsewhere, Angola’s Sonangol reportedly moved to block Sinopec and
CNOOC from obtaining deepwater
acreage, FACTS analysts said.

Diverse investments
China’s oil and gas companies,
particularly CNPC-PetroChina, have
signed several preliminary agreements
and memorandums of understanding
outlining billions of dollars in future
investments (see Table 2).
CNPC is heavily involved in Iran and
Iraq. FACTS attributed CNPC’s ability to
invest in Iran to the US sanctions keeping US-based oil companies away from
investing there.
On Jan. 14, 2009, CNPC signed a
buyback binding contract with National
Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) to develop onshore North Azadegan oil field. Duration of the agreement is 25 years. CNPC
also has an MOU with NIOC to develop
South Azadegan oil field.
Under the MOU, CNPC will take a
70% interest in South Azadegan while
NIOC keeps a 20% share and Japan’s
Inpex owns 10%.
FACTS said the project reportedly
will need up to $2.5 billion worth of
investments, of which CNPC is expected to pay $2.25 billion and Inpex is to
pay the rest.
“If the deal is successfully concluded, it will consolidate CNPC’s interest
in developing the Azadegan structure,”
FACTS said. “Azadegan is Iran’s largest
oil discovery in 30 years with estimated
reserves of more than 30 million bbl.”
Azadegan is close to the Iraqi border
and has a complex geological formation, making the project both a strategic priority and an enormous technical
challenge for Iran, FACTS said.

$4 billion oil-backed loan for energy,
infrastructure, and other projects.
Subsequently, China made a series of
loans to Angola, which exports about
40% of its crude production to China.
China also has made loans to companies in Venezuela, Russia, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Turkmenistan, Bolivia, and
Ecuador in exchange for long-term oil
and gas supplies.
“Those countries could repay the
loan through revenues from oil sales by
selling upstream assets to Chinese oil
and gas companies or through supplying crudes to China,” FACTS said. “It is
very likely that Chinese leaders will be
able to negotiate a good return on their
investment in future loans for oil and
gas deals.”
China also is building goodwill by
providing capital to producing countries, analysts said.
The motivation for Chinese oil and
gas companies to expand abroad is to
take advantage of the Chinese government’s concerns about security of

oil pipeline from East Siberia to China.
On Apr. 27, 2009, Transneft launched
construction of an offshore section
from the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean to
the Chinese border, just under 43½
miles. CNPC will build the remaining
609-mile stretch of pipeline.
Although not officially confirmed by
the companies, FACTS said the estimated cost of the pipeline is $800 million.
Russia and China also plan cooperative gas pipeline projects. FACTS
analysts said Russia reportedly reached
an initial agreement in 2009 to supply China 6.76 bscfd, “which seems on
the high end, given the capacity of the
planned gas pipeline,” adding, “It is
expected that the gas fields in Siberia
could be put into operation after 2015.”

on this.”
Committee member Mary L.
Landrieu (D-La.) applauded Obama for
promoting safe, clean nuclear power
and for being open to offshore exploration. She said any energy bill should
make the most of domestic resources
“and our unmatched skill and innovation to reduce our dependence on
foreign oil.”
Republicans on the committee were
critical. Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.) said
that in order for the US economy to
improve, the administration should
stop pursuing job-killing policies. “It
should shelve the cap-and-trade scheme
that would increase taxes on the American people and employers. It should
ditch its bureaucratic, secretive plan to
regulate carbon from small businesses.
It should end the burdensome oil and
gas regulations that will kill more red,
white, and blue jobs,” he said.
GOP energy leaders in the House
also criticized Obama’s remarks. “If
the president really wants to spur job
creation and economic growth, he will
stop blocking American energy production and allow us to develop our
own resources in an environmentally
responsible way,” said Doc Hastings
(Wash.), the Natural Resources Committee’s ranking minority member. “In
addition to creating millions of jobs, it
will create an influx of new revenue to
the federal government that will help
pay down the trillion dollar deficit.”
“Countless energy-related jobs have
been lost or prevented by the Obama
administration,” said Rep. Rob Bishop
(R-Utah), a Natural Resources committee member and chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus. “Though
‘green’ jobs sound nice in speeches,
the reality is that we need all jobs, not
just those that fit with a special interest
agenda.” ✦

adding, “In fact, it accomplishes the
opposite and puts our members at a
precarious disadvantage with foreign

Russell said contrary to what the
White House’s budget request implies,
the US oil and gas industry pays more
taxes and royalties than any other US
business. “Very few industries have the
potential to create as many high-wage
jobs in our current economic climate
as quickly and effectively as we do,” he
said, adding, “While efforts to impede
that work may produce short-sighted
budget relief in the near term, they will
result in far less revenue, investment,
and activity in American resource development in the long term.”

‘Knockout blow’
“For our members—the small businessmen and women of our nation’s oil
and gas industry—this is a knockout
blow,” Somerlyn Cothran, executive
director of the National Stripper Well
Association in Tulsa, said on Feb. 2.
“Implementation of this budget proposal would mean a significant loss of
jobs and a dramatic loss of tax revenues
for each of the 35 states where our
members are productive, contributing
businesses. Plus, the resulting decrease
in oil production will serve only to
make America even more dependent
upon foreign oil.”
Cothran noted that while a marginal, or stripper, well produces 15 b/d
or less of oil, US stripper wells collectively produce 20% of the country’s oil
or 1.2 million b/d—as much as the US
imports from Saudi Arabia.

“There should absolutely be a structural
and financial difference in relation to
tax subsidies between the large-scale,
international oil companies and small,
independent operators. This is the
only way to ensure the survival of our
industry’s small businesses.”
Marc W. Smith, executive director of
the Independent Petroleum Association
of Mountain States in Denver, said on
Feb. 2, “I understand the temptation to
go after ‘Big Oil,’ but the truth is that
these punitive tax and fee increases
will be most harmful to small businesses struggling to survive our current
economic crisis. This administration
continues to assure us that they are not
‘anti oil and gas,’ and yet every week
brings some counterproductive new
policy to make developing American
energy even more burdensome.”
Smith said the proposed tax hikes
came in addition to proposed inspection fees, a nonproducing acreage fee,
and a royalty rate increase in the US
Department of the Interior’s fiscal
2011 budget request. “Every day, I hear
concerns from our members about
whether they will be able to continue
developing energy in the West,” Smith
said, adding, “I have to wonder if shutting down all energy production on
public lands is the ultimate goal of this
administration. They are forgetting that
these are vital energy resources that
belong to all Americans.”

Other terminations
The proposed budget also calls for
termination of US Department of Energy oil and gas research and development programs, which the 2005 Energy
Policy Act had authorized. OMB said in

Rendell’s plans
in Pennsylvania

P

ennsylvania Gov. Edward G.
Rendell gets it. His state is on the
verge of a natural gas development
boom, so he has ordered the Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP) to hire 68 new inspectors and
other employees. He also plans to ask
the Keystone State’s general assembly
to enact a severance tax.
“Interest in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale formation is greater than
ever before and as natural gas prices
continue to rise, that interest will
only increase,” Rendell said. “In fact,
the industry has told us that they
expect to apply for 5,200 permits
to drill in the Marcellus shale this
year—nearly three times the number
of permits we issued in all of 2009.”
Rendell said, “Given these conditions, an extraction tax is gaining
widespread support across our state
and I will again ask the general assembly to enact such a levy. It is fair
and affordable to drillers. They know
it, and so do members of the House
of Representatives who voted for it
last year.”
Stephen Rhoads, president of the
Pennsylvania Oil & Gas Association,
indicated that the group opposes
the proposal, which state lawmakers
rejected in 2009. The Marcellus shale
gas industry’s maturity is at least a
decade away, he told the Harrisburg
Patriot News.

Exempt from freeze
DEP’s new employees will be exempt from a hiring freeze instituted
last year, Rendell said. Their salaries would come from higher well
permitting fees which the general
assembly put in place in 2009 with
industry and environmental groups’

support. It was the first such increase
since 1984, he said.
“We were able to hire 37 additional inspectors and permitting staff
in 2009, but the industry’s projected
growth in 2010 means that we need
additional inspectors to ensure oil
and gas companies follow environmental laws and regulations,”
the governor added. DEP inspected
14,544 wells and took 678 enforcement actions in 2009, he said.
Rendell said the state also will
amend its regulations to strengthen
well construction standards and
define an operator’s responsibility to
respond to gas migration issues.

Specific provisions
Specifically, the new standards
will require well casings of Marcellus
shale and other high-pressure wells
to be tested and constructed of specific oilfield grade cement. They will
clarify a producer’s responsibility
to restore or replace water supplies
which are used.
They also will establish procedures for operators to identify and
correct gas migration problems without waiting for DEP’s direction, and
require them to notify the agency
immediately in such cases. Operators
also will be required to inspect each
well quarterly, report the results to
DEP annually, and notify the agency
promptly if problems such as overpressured wells and defective casings
are found.
The new regulations were offered for public comment on Jan. 29.
Rendell said that they would make
Pennsylvania’s standards comparable
with other gas-producing states’ or,
for well casings, more rigorous. ✦

said, a recent Government Accountability Office report said DOE oil and
gas programs are dwarfed by industry
R&D ($20 billion for 1997-2006), and
DOE has often conducted research in
areas which already received private
sector funding, especially for evolution
advances and incremental improvements.
“The program is primarily operated
by a private sector consortium; only
25% of the funding is spent through
the National Energy Technology Laboratory,” it indicated.
The White House also proposed

ending the ultradeepwater research
program at DOE, which it said would
save $50 million from fiscal 2010 funding levels, and unconventional fossil
technology R&D, which it estimated
would save $20 million. It also recommended canceling the planned expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,
which it said would save $71 million,
and ending DOE’s gas technology
research support, which it said would
save $18 million.
Responding to a reporter’s question
at the US Department of the Interior’s

budget briefing, Interior Sec. Ken
Salazar noted that EPACT tax incentives
he supported in 2005 as a US senator from Colorado have accomplished
their purpose. “They were designed to
provide incentives to explore the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We know what’s
out there now, and that the oil and gas
industry is interested,” he said.
Salazar added that a proposal in the
fiscal 2010 budget request to impose a
severance tax on new gulf production
is gone from the latest proposal. The
money it would have raised has been
made up elsewhere, he said. ✦

get presentation, BLM Director Robert
V. Abbey said a pilot program designed
to facilitate drilling permit application
processing will be retained. “We’ve
learned a lot from it, particularly the
benefit of involving other government
agencies and stakeholders before the
final decisions are made,” he told OGJ.
He also said new onshore leasing
guidelines that he and Salazar announced on Jan. 6 were a response to
an increasing number of protests and
their resulting delays. Protests were
filed against half of BLM’s proposed oil
and gas leases during 2009, he pointed
out. “We’re not naive. We realize our
reforms won’t satisfy everybody,” Abbey added. “But by proceeding more
carefully, we’ll be better able to defend
our decisions if they’re challenged in
court.”
DOI’s fiscal 2011 budget request
anticipated a nearly 45% increase
in receipts to an estimated $13.98
billion from fiscal 2010’s projected
$9.65 billion from coal and hard-rock
mineral as well as oil and gas activity.
US Outer Continental Shelf receipts
were expected to jump $3.69 billion
year-to-year, or 102%, to $7.23 billion. Onshore receipts were budgeted
to climb by $651 million, or 16%, to
$4.04 billion.
Salazar said he expected to make
announcements soon that he hopes
will clarify uncertainties surrounding the department’s offshore oil and
gas leasing program. But he added that
DOI and MMS have had to address two
5-year OCS programs simultaneously,
which has caused delays.
The proposed budget said that the
OCS program for 2007-12 includes six
lease sales in fiscal 2011, including two
in the Gulf of Mexico and one in the
Beaufort Sea off Alaska. It said that a
“special interest” sale in Alaska’s Cook
Inlet also could be held. “However, the
resolution of ongoing litigation and
the level of industry interest in certain
frontier areas may affect the number of
sales actually held,” it continued.

Royalty management
MMS would receive $364.8 million under the proposed budget, $16.5
million more than the enacted level for
fiscal 2010. The money includes $10
million to terminate the royalty-in-kind
(RIK) program and move back to the
more traditional cash-based royalty-invalue program, MMS officials said.
A reduction in outlays from royalty
receipts previously used to fund RIK activities will offset a requested appropriations increase to enhance compliance
activities and increase audit capacity,
they indicated.
“This budget request will enable us
to effectively terminate the RIK program without any net increase in the
cost of our royalty management work,”
MMS Director S. Elizabeth Birnbaum
said in a statement. “It reflects our
commitment to ensuring that our
federal and American Indian energy
and minerals revenues are accurately
reported and paid in compliance with

laws, regulations, and lease terms.”
The request also contains $4.4 million to fund technology to assess oil
and gas potential and fair market value
of OCS tracts offered for lease, according to MMS. It said that the money
would be used to fund inspections,
which have increased because of the
number of new deepwater facilities on
the OCS. Additional resources totaling
$3.7 million will be used to improve
royalty compliance and ensure companies are paying proper royalties on
processed and transported gas, it added.
MMS and BLM also would receive
more money for renewable energy
projects under the proposed budget, reflecting a major Obama administration
priority. “We’re very aware of climate
change and the need to consider potential impacts,” Abbey said. “We also
recognize that there’s still a lot of oil
and gas left to develop—responsibly—
on our public lands.” ✦

said Webb.

to and integrated with its initial 10,000
b/d Blackgold project. KNOC holds
100% working interest in the leases
and has identified sufficient reserves
to support an additional 20,000 b/d
of bitumen production over 25 years
(2015-40).
KNOC initially plans to drill 28
steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)
well pairs from three pads, together
with some modification of the central
processing facility (CPF) and associated
infrastructure to facilitate bitumen re-

covery on the site and its export off the
site either by pipeline or truck. It plans
additional production wells and well
pads as required to maintain production during the project’s life.
Osum’s EIA is on its proposed Taiga
project about 20 km north of Cold
Lake. The project calls for using SAGD
for extracting bitumen for much of the
development with cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) starting later in the project’s
life.
Osum plans to install a 35,000 b/d
bitumen processing facility and have a
30-year project production life. Pending regulatory approval, Osum expects
construction to start in third-quarter
2011 with production starting in
second-quarter 2013.
Shell’s EIA concerns the Peace River
in situ expansion of the Carmon Creek
project. Shell continues to evaluate development of its in situ oil sands leases
40 km northeast of Peace River. Shell’s

Peace River complex is licensed to
produce 12,500 b/d of crude bitumen
using thermal techniques.
The company initiated development
of its Peace River leases in the 1970s
and expanded the in situ project in
1985 to its current operating capacity.
Based on its resource delineation and
recovery evaluation programs, Shell
proposes to increase thermal bitumen
production from its Peace River leases
to about 80,000 b/d.
It plans to use vertical steam drive
thermal enhanced recovery methods to
produce the bitumen. The project also
may include new central processing
facilities, cogeneration of power and
steam, multiple well pads, and a steam
distribution and bitumen gathering
system as wells as additional infrastructure such as roads, natural gas and
condensate supply pipelines, a diluted
bitumen sales pipeline, and electrical
power lines. ✦

suade Tehran from pursuing nuclear
weapons and cracking down on internal dissent.
“We have all watched the Iranian
regime oppress its own people on the
streets of Iran and continue to defy the
international community on nuclear issues,” said Democratic Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid (Nev.). “That is why
it is so important that we move this
legislation forward quickly.”

Gasoline prices rising
This week’s Senate measure coincided with reports that Middle East
gasoline prices rose this week due to
slightly higher demand in the region—
especially from Iran, one of the region’s
main consumer markets.
“What we are seeing is that demand
has been picking up as Iran starts its
stockbuild exercise in anticipation of
stricter sanctions from the US,” said
one Asian-based trader.
Earlier this month, traders said Iran’s
January gasoline imports were expected
to rise by 23% over December, as the
Islamic republic continued to build
stocks as the threat of stricter sanctions
loomed.
They said Tehran was likely to import as much as 128,000 b/d of gasoline from the international spot market
or about 15 cargoes. The increase
amounted to 25,000 b/d over the
103,609 b/d of gasoline Iran imported
in December.
“There was a flurry of activities
towards the end of the month. It looks
like they are now building inventories,”
said one Middle East-based trader at the
time.
That buildup came after the US
House of Representatives passed legislation in December authorizing President Barack Obama to levy sanctions
on companies that directly provide
gasoline to Iran, along with firms that
provide insurance and tankers to facilitate fuel shipments (OGJ Online, Dec.
16, 2009).
At that time, reports said Iran was

already storing about 1.45 million
bbl of gasoline on tankers as it slowly
built inventories in anticipation of the
tougher sanctions regime.
Traders said the fuel was being
stored on at least six oil tankers anchored in Iranian waters, a buildup that

had been steadily taking place since
September, traders said.
“They are definitely in a bit of a
bind, they want to build inventories but
at the same time they are struggling to
find the money to buy surplus product,” a trader said. ✦

Indonesia seeks to purchase LNG carriers
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Indonesia’s state-owned PT Pertamina said it will open a bidding round
to procure ocean-going vessels to be
converted into floating LNG-receiving
terminals in East and West Java.
“We expect to hold the bidding by
the end of February,” said Pertamina
Pres. Director Karen Agustiawan.
“There are about two or three vessels
that meet our criteria, but I cannot
disclose that now,” she said.
Regasification facilities would be
constructed aboard the vessels once
they are ready, Karen said. “The work
will take about 9 months,” she said,
adding that the floating LNG terminals
would require other facilities, including deepwater pipelines.
“The LNG terminals are expected to
be in full operation by September,” said
Karen, referring to plans of Pertamina
to construct two LNG terminals in
West and East Java, each able to store
500 MMcf of gas. She said the facilities
would cost $200 million each.
Indonesia has no LNG receiving terminal but is seeking supplies of gas and
coal to meet rising domestic demand
for power and to reduce consumption
of oil as its reserves dwindle and production falls.
Karen said Pertamina would invite
selected vessel owners to participate in
the joint venture operating the terminals. She said Pertamina “must” hold
majority interest in the JV because “we
don’t want the vessels to be leased; we
want to own them.”
Pertamina and state gas distributor
PT Perusahaan Gas Negara have been
ordered by the government to construct
the LNG-receiving terminals to help
state-owned power utility PT Perusa32

haan Listrik Negara secure gas supply
for its power plants.
The proposed bidding for LNG
carriers follows an announcement last
month that Pertamina plans to buy 12
small-capacity gas tankers at a cost of
$333 million this year, with the order
expected to be finalized in 2012-13.
Four of the vessels are to carry LPG,
two with a capacity of 3,500 cu m and
the two with a capacity of 23,000 cu
m. Suhartoko, Pertamina’s senior vice-

president of shipping, said a tender for
the four vessels was already under way,
and “will require a total investment of
$128 million.”
Suhartoko said Pertamina was waiting for shareholder approval to procure
the remaining eight small-capacity
tankers, which he estimated would
cost a total of $205 million. He said the
ships, all to be used in Indonesian waters, would range from 3,500 to 17,500

IADC/SPE: BP changes training, development focus
Guntis Moritis
Production Editor
To meet the increasing complexity of
drilling and completing wells in higher
pressure and temperature environments
that are deeper and have longer deviations, Scott Sigurdson, vice-president
of drilling and completions for BP PLC
said the company’s focus now is on
training and development of engineers
as specialists rather than its previous
emphasis on generalists.
Sigurdson gave his remarks Feb. 2 at
the International Association of Drilling
Contractors and Society of Petroleum
Engineers Drilling Conference & Exhibition in New Orleans during a plenary
session to discuss the topic: Is technology outpacing competency?
He said wells now are being planned
or drilled with bottomhole temperatures of 500° F. and wellhead pressures of 25,000 psi. Well deviations are
also greater such as in the case of BP’s
planned development of the Liberty
field off Alaska’s North Slope.

The wells drilled from an existing island will have step-outs of up to
40,000 ft and 10,000-ft true vertical
depths. Parker Drilling designed and
constructed the rig, which arrived on
ANS in July 2009 (OGJ Online, Nov.
23, 2009).
A BP predecessor discovered and appraised the field, an eastern satellite of
Prudhoe Bay oil field, in 1997. Liberty
is in federal waters 5 miles off the coast
and 11 miles southeast of giant Endicott
oil field (OGJ, Nov. 7, 2005, Newsletter).
Sigurdson said that BP will no longer
assume competency but will require
testing which is already being done for
entry level engineers and is also being
developed for engineers with 3-10
years of experience.
BP has developed specific roadmaps
for personnel advancement, he said. For
example drilling engineers have 15 elements while completion engineers have
18 elements.
The roadmap includes job experience, formal training, and assessment
elements that still need to be finalized,
Sigurdson said. ✦

is 10 months, and the average is 14-15
months.
The first year of production is typified by increasing monthly production.
It is identified as “year 1,” and it presumably culminates with the month of
maximum production. The 12 months
of production after the peak month
constitutes production of “year 2,” the
following 12 months constitute “year
3,” etc.
A production decline percentage can
be calculated for year 3 by the conventional method of comparing its production to that of year 2 by the formula:
(VYear2–VYear3)/VYear2 × 100

and technology will certainly change
with time. The slow economic situation
today may drastically change for worse
or better, and all this will affect the
number of wells drilled.
The number of producing CBM
wells added for 2008 (688) is largely
compiled by now, but the number of
new CBM wells for 2009 was difficult
to predict even at this writing in the
last quarter of the year, for there is several months lag time before these data
are finalized.
The crash in gas prices from the
high recorded in mid-2008 also likely
changes the way companies marshal
their capital. Company resources do
not necessarily dry up for new drilling during hard times, but they can be
redirected in other ways. For example,
instead of contracting rigs for drilling
new wells, companies may decide it is
more politic to employ workover rigs to
maximize production in their existing
wells.
Similarly, aggressive economizing
may result in shutting-in or abandonment of marginal wells, thus the average and median well productivity could
actually increase in coming years. This
may be occurring for many leases in
2008 that were producing less than 8
Mcfd, with declining production, and
have not had any production reported
in 2009.
Are 360 and 200 new producing
wells respectively projected for 2009
and 2010 realistic? Anemic rates of
drilling in late 2009 indicate that fewer
gas wells will be completed, but the
final number depends on economic,
technologic, and even political events.
Upon query by the author, geologists from the three primary CBM
companies producing in southeastern
Kansas (Quest, Dart, and Layne) stated
that their companies were drastically
scaling back developmental drilling in
2009, so the educated guess that 360
new producing wells will have been
drilled in 2009 may be even wildly
optimistic.
Some feedback on what can be expected for 2009 is available though, for
40

& DEVE

L O P M E N T

20.6 bcf of gas production is reported
through May 2009 for the counties
shown in Fig. 1. This is proportional to
49.4 bcf for the entire year. This hints
that the two methods presented for
predicting future production are pessimistic, but the point still stands that
the impressive production increases of
previous years due to development of
CBM in this region cannot be expected
even in the near future.
The predicted drop in production
does not mean the CBM resource in
this region is being depleted. More
accurately, the resource simply cannot
be offered to the market given low gas
prices in late 2009.
Many drilling locations in southeastern Kansas are still available. For
example, Quest Energy reports on its
website that it had in 2008 an inventory
of more than 2,100 drilling locations
on its leased acreage, and that its CBM
wells have a life of about 15 years.8
If a sufficient number of remaining locations are drilled and put on
production in coming years by Quest
and other Cherokee basin CBM operators, then annual gas production can
conceivably rise by several billion cubic
feet from the 49.1 bcf recorded in 2008.
The prediction of declining production is not to say that “the bloom is off
the rose” (i.e., what was once attractive
is no longer), but rather, even if production economics and technology do
not radically change, CBM production
will still be a vital part of the regional
economy for many years.
The production-by-year graph will
not be a symmetric bell-shaped curve
with a decline as steep as its rise; it will
likely resemble the positive-skewed
curve characteristic of a CBM well (Fig.
3). Fortunes can still be made, and the
economic impact of CBM in Kansas
and the Midcontinent is and will be
substantial.

can use several practical
equations for calculating
flow rates of natural gas
through venturi gas-lift
valves.
Production
For critical flow, this
analysis derived such
equations from a rigorous theoretical
model for gas isentropic evolution that
uses real-gas calculations not restricted
to density but encompassing also other
relevant thermodynamic properties.
This rigorous model is complex and
requires a computational algorithm and
relatively much computer time.
For expeditious hand calculations
or using simple spreadsheets, the
equations presented in this article are
within the accuracy needed and require
much less computational effort.
For subcritical flow, this article suggests an approximate approach because
venturi gas-lift valves should always be
operated in critical flow.
Operators are installing more venturi nozzle, or simply venturi, gas-lift
valves in continuous gas-lift wells
worldwide. Various articles1-4 describe
field applications and the resulting
benefits.
In Brazil, about 200 wells, mostly
offshore, now have these valves.

In experimental terms, a reference

constant.
The figure compares experimental
dynamic performance of a venturi valve

Practical equations calculate gas
flow rates through venturi valves
with that of a conventional squareedged orifice valve. The most important difference relates to critical flow,
the region of the curve where the gas
flow rate through the valve is constant,
irrespective of downstream pressure.
This happens when downstream
pressure is less than a certain fraction
of the upstream pressure. This fraction
is about 0.5 for an orifice valve and 0.9
for a venturi valve.
Thus, in view of the usual pressure
differentials between casing (injection
pressure) and tubing (production pressure), orifice valves operate in subcritical flow and venturi valves in critical
flow.

The traditional approach in gas-lift
literature for modeling valve dynamic
performance uses the ThornhillCraver equation.6 The equation is for
compressible, one-dimensional, and
isentropic flow of a perfect gas through
a restriction, with the addition of a correction factor (discharge coefficient) to
account for deviations encountered in
real cases.
To partially correct the equation due
to real-gas behavior, the compressibility
factor is generally shown in the classical form of that equation, which then
becomes Equation 1 in the equation
box.
Cs is a factor that depends on the
units used and on the reference conditions for volumes, for example, standard conditions.
Using English units (pressures in
psia, flow rates in MMscfd, areas in sq
in., temperatures in °R, and standard
conditions of 60° F. and 14.70 psia), it
has a value of 0.1549.
In this case, it is necessary to include
the factor 32.17 (lbm-ft)/(lbf-sec2) for
multiplying the numerator of Equation
1.
For the standard conditions usually
adopted in Brazil (20° C. and 1.01325
bar), pressures (absolute) in bar, areas
in mm2, temperatures in K, and flow
rates in cu m/day, the constant Cs has a
value of 423.5.
If one reduces the ratio between
absolute pressures at position 2 and
upstream of the venturi (Ψp2 = P2/P1)
continuously, for example if the pressure at the restriction P2 is continuously
decreased with a constant upstream
pressure P1, the flow rate increases until
Ψp2 reaches the critical ratio, Ψp2c = P2c/
P1, at which the velocity at the restriction is sonic and any further reduction
in Ψp2 does not change the flow rate.
Thus, if Ψp2 < Ψp2c, Ψp2c replaces Ψp in
Equation 1.
One can obtain the critical ratio
Ψp by differentiating Equation 1 with
respect to Ψp2 and equating it to zero
(since Ψp is the Ψp2 ratio for which the
flow rate is maximum). For example,

Options
Average qualities for three options
were calculated from a detailed gas
chromatograph analysis of a reformer
feed sample, along with octane and
cetane numbers for individual hydrocarbons:
1. If a 300-400° F. cut were taken
from the crude unit and hydrodesulfurized to less than the 15-ppm spec
for low-sulfur diesel fuel, the average
cetane number would be 41.
2. Extracting aromatics from the
300-400° F. leaves a premium diesel
fuel blending component of 53 cetane number. The extracted aromatics
could be a petrochemical feed or a 104
(R+M)/2 gasoline blending component.
In either case, the economic advantage
might be appreciable, depending upon
the refinery’s situation.
3. If paraffins were extracted
separately, they would be only two
cetane numbers better than the paraf46

three paraffins.3 The well-known
negative relationship between cetane
and octane was used to estimate cetane
numbers (OGJ, Dec. 3, 2007, p. 58).
Because published correlations did not
seem satisfactory, a correlation was
developed from data on lower boiling
hydrocarbons shown in Table 3 and the
accompanying figure.

The author is very knowledgeable
about gasoline blending but less so
about process technology or economics.4 This article should be considered
as a basis for deciding whether to
evaluate a new process scheme or an alteration to the present process scheme.
Obviously, the exact cut points in
gas chromatography do not apply to
refinery operations. This is pertinent
for the 4.7% normal nonane (303° F.
boiling point) in the reformer feed.
Elimination of the normal nonane
would result in a 1.4 cetane decrease
in the calculated cetane number for
Option 2.
The linear calculations in this
analysis do not take into account octane
interactions between the hydrocarbons.5 Their effects are economically
significant but small in comparison
with the differences between paraffins
and aromatics in this analysis.
The (R+M/2) interactions range
from barely negative for some hydrocarbon combinations to significantly
positive for aromatics with low-octane
paraffins. Data are not available for
cetane interactions, but they are likely
to be opposite in sign to octane interactions, in view of the negative correlation between octane numbers and
cetane numbers.
In view of the large differences in
octane and cetane numbers between
paraffins and aromatics, limitations
in the accuracy of these estimates are
probably not serious. ✦

between the area rolled and not rolled
by a road roller (Fig. 1).
Two 30-40 mm samples of line

the pipe sample
with the cracked

microstructures were at the crack
position, demonstrating large vertical
structural stress at the cracked weld.
Accumulated structural stress on a
pipeline can increase any cracking tendency. The girth weld’s position at 10
o’clock-1 o’clock is consistent with the
direction of structural stress, suggesting the structural stress accelerated the
crack extension.
The road roller compacted the
ground after the pipeline was buried,
and the crack position lay just at the
edge of roll area. Sinking of the ground
as it was being rolled would cause the
compressive load on the underground

from internal pressure acted on the
girth weld, Equation 1 calculates the
axial load.
The actual axial load from internal
pressure, however, measured far less
than the 1,176 kilonewton (118 tons)
calculated in Equation 1 because the
pipeline was buried 3 m under ground
compacted by a road roller and stratum
restricted the pipeline.
Equation 2 calculates joint capability of the girth weld according to weld
tension strength and pipe cross area.
Calculations show axial load of only

specification. Severe offset and undercut will reduce the efficient section,
concentrate stress, and reduce pipeline
capability. Equation 3 calculates stress
concentration from offset and undercut.7
Equation 3 shows the stress at the
weld measures 2.47 times the average
stress because of offset and undercut.
Cracks at the bottom of the undercut
may cause the real stress concentration
coefficient to be more than 2.47.
The crack began at the inner weld
surface, where both toe cracks and
weld flaws were present. The toe crack
depth is 13% of the pipe WT. Not only
do the toe cracks reduce the section,
but they also produce severe stress
concentration and result in cracks easily
extending during service.
A fitness-for-service assessment us-

ing TGRC-AFSP software considered
both simultaneously and separately
the effect of cracks, undercuts, and
offsets according to the weld flaws and
test pressure. Fig. 10 shows the result,
indicating the girth weld is unsafe in
the presence of cracks, undercuts, and
offsets.
Toughness plays a key role in
evaluating weld quality. The higher the
toughness, the more resistant to crack
initiating and extending the weld seam
is. The lower the toughness, the less
resistant.8 Weld-seam toughness is only
6.9% of pipe body according to test
results.

Obama’s speech
raises tax alarm
for oil industry
For the oil and gas industry, President
Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech
on Jan. 27 contained one carrot and two
heavy sticks.
The carrot: “Making tough decisions
about opening new offshore areas for oil
and gas development.”
The first heavy stick: “Passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s

the profitable kind of energy in America.”
The second heavy stick: “At a time of
record deficits, we will not continue tax
cuts for oil companies, for investment
fund managers, and for those making over
$250,000 a year.”
Although any hint of new offshore leasing from the Obama camp might seem like
a healthy turn, no one should be fooled.
This administration has consistently
trimmed lease sales and tightened restrictions on what leasing it has allowed.
And if it did try to open more than
isolated pieces of now-closed areas of
the federal offshore to resource development, Congress under current leadership
wouldn’t fund the lease sales.
The sticks are what matter.
The cap-and-trade system proposed
for climate-change mitigation would be
disastrous for the industry, especially
refiners. Even after Obama’s prodding,
however, the Senate probably won’t ratify
the House’s misjudgment by passing it.
Most senators won’t misread the
national mood as badly as Obama has.
Most can draw sound conclusions from
a recent survey, conducted for the Pew
Center for the People and the Press, of
public opinions about “top priorities for
2010.” Among 21 national concerns, global
warming ranked last.
The greater worry must be Obama’s
allusion to “tax cuts for oil companies,”
embedded in a list of populist villains.
This can mean only new wheels on the
wagon of horrors Obama rolled out in his
budget proposal last year, with its repeal
of percentage depletion for independent
producers, new taxation of Gulf of Mexico
production, and exclusion of oil companies from a tax credit available to competitors in other businesses, among other
things.
Obama has made clear he’s not retreating from the predilections evident in his
first year in office. For the industry, this is
reason to worry.

Floating inventories fall
The volume of crude in storage on supertankers at sea has fallen well below 40
million bbl from a peak of 100 million bbl last May.
Some say it may have fallen as low as 20 million bbl. “If that is right, and land
stocks also reduce, the market could easily see prompt oil regain its premium to
futures as demand recovers,” said analysts at KBC Market Services, a division of
KBC Process Technology Ltd. in Surrey, UK, on Feb. 1. “The contango in the market
has already become much narrower, down to just 50-60¢/bbl on [North Sea] Brent
compared [with] around $2/bbl towards the end of last year.”
Some of the middle distillate held in floating storage off Europe also was drawn
down in the recent cold wave in the Northern Hemisphere. KBC analysts said 70-90
million bbl of distillate are estimated to be still in floating storage, however.
US net exports of distillates were “on the high side” at 425,000 b/d during
November, “which means that on a distillate yield of 27.3%, the US refineries are
running about 1.6 million b/d of crude oil to export distillates,” said Olivier Jakob
at Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland. “Those are contra-economics, since these
exports [were] sold into the floating stocks, which then pressure other European
refineries to reduce runs as well. The bottom line is that the Atlantic Basin refineries were still burning about 1.6 million b/d too much crude oil in November.”
Ethanol production
US refineries are taking a “double-whammy” from low post-crisis demand and
continued growth in ethanol blending that is taking market share from refined
petroleum products.
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC,
said it’s possible even a strong recovery in global gross domestic product might
be accompanied by a “fuel-less” or tepid resurgence in oil demand. “Oil demand
growth in Asia is likely to be one of the most important drivers for the crude oil
markets over the next few years. India and China are growing strongly as new car
registrations have performed strongly,” he said.
“The US is now producing about as much ethanol as it is importing crude oil
from Saudi Arabia, and on the current trend we would expect the US ethanol production to be over the US import of Saudi crude oil in 2010,” Jacob said. “This is
good news from a perspective of US internal politics, but the growing use of ethanol in a peak oil demand environment (in the US) should continue to be a strong
pressure point on the US refining system.”
He noted, “Saudi Arabia is not fighting the trend, and it is abandoning its storage installations in the Caribbean to focus instead on storage installations in Japan
to better service ‘Chindia.’ With the 1 million b/d addition of Canadian pipeline
capacity in the second quarter and the continued increase in ethanol production
and blending, the US is cutting its dependency on oil that costs $5/bbl to produce
(Middle East) and increasing its dependency on oil that cost $70/bbl to produce
(Canada and ethanol).”
Enbridge Inc.’s Alberta Clipper pipeline from Canada to the Midwest will start
operating in April rather than the third quarter as previously projected. “Combined with the start-up of the Keystone pipeline this means that we suddenly have
900,000 b/d of additional pipeline capacity from Canada to the US Midwest starting in the second quarter,” Jakob said (OGJ Online, Jan. 25, 2010).
The China factor
Jakob said, “China is increasing its dependency on the cheap Middle-Eastern
crude and would be shooting itself in the foot by allowing sanctions on Iran that
would be too harsh and that would push Iran in a geopolitical escalation.”
France assumed the rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council at the end of January, prompting speculation of UN sanctions against Iran.
However, the US proposed a $6.4 billion sale of military equipment to Taiwan, and
China reacted by suspending military exchanges. Chinese officials said they also
will impose sanctions on companies selling arms and will review cooperation with
the US on “major issues.” So it’s doubtful “that the Chinese will provide a helpful
hand over Iran,” Jakob said. They also may not help the US confront North Korea
over its nuclear program or with currency and trade issues.
In other news, at the end of January in the first test of the US military’s ability
to respond to a simulated Iranian missile attack, the US missile defense failed to
intercept the test missile launched from the Marshall Islands.

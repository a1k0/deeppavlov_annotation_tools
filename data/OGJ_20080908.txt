Taking the Next Leap Forward
with Real Time Operating Centers
Dr. Eric van Oort Planning & Business
Improvement Manager, Shell E&P Americas
Dr. Eric van Oort joined Shell EP Americas in New Orleans
in 2000 as a staff drilling engineer and deepwater drilling
advisor. His responsibilities at the time included leading
Shell EP Americas’ ﬂuids and cement team and real-time
operations center (RTOC) hubs in the Americas. As RTOC
team leader, he played a leading role in establishing the
current global network of RTOC hubs and satellites across the Shell Group. Dr.
van Oort currently serves on the Regional Wells Leadership Team in Houston as
Planning and Business Improvement (PBI) manager, with ownership of various
performance improvement initiatives including RTOCs.

Douwe Franssens Global Real Time Technology
Manager – Halliburton Sperry Drilling Services
After spending 3 years as the Real Time Solutions Manager
for Asia Paciﬁc working with all major clients to design
and implement Real Time Solutions for all aspects of the
Well Planning, Construction and Production Phases, he
is currently the Global Real Time Technology Manager
for Sperry Drilling Services responsible for the successful
implementation of Real Time projects in all their aspects.

With appreciation to our sponsor:

The webcast speakers will explore how oil & gas
operators can use real-time operations centers to
increase production and accelerate well delivery
for all types of wells, but particularly for high cost
deepwater wells. The speakers will discuss how
operating centers can be used for a variety of purposes,
including effectively leveraging subject-matter experts,
non-productive time reduction, drilling performance
optimization, centralization of key well delivery data,
and other optimization techniques.

Speakers will give special attention to newer operating
center applications (including real-time rig activity
detection), as well as possible future directions for
operating center technology.
The presentations will explore what Real Time means
for the operator, service company, and technical
staff, with emphasis on the ﬁnancial, technical and
organizational beneﬁts in deploying and developing
Real Time systems and centers.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

CFTC seeks comment on NGX registration request zil was asked to attend a meeting of oil producer and consumer
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission is requesting
public comments on Natural Gas Exchange Inc.’s (NGX’s) application to register as a US derivatives clearing organization. Its US
office is in Houston.
The Calgary-based exchange, which has been operating since
February 2004, is owned by the Toronto Stock Exchange’s parent
company, TSX Group. NGX began an operating alliance earlier this
year with the InterContinental Exchange in which NGX uses ICE’s
front end trading technology and provides clearing services for
ICE’s US physical gas products, according to information at NGX’s
website.
It says it lists more than 60 physical and forward gas contracts—
which can be delivered at 30 Canadian and US hubs—more than
80 financial gas swaps and options, more than 20 electricity swaps
and more than 10 physical gas transport (location) swaps. NGX
said an average 2,700 contracts are traded each month on its platform.
Comments should be submitted by Sept. 17 and will be posted
at the commission’s website, the CFTC said.

Brazil, asked to join OPEC, declines
Iran has invited Brazil to join the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, according to a Brazilian senior government
official.
Brazilian oil minister Edison Lobao, in an interview with Brazil’s Folha newspaper, said OPEC members believe Brazil will in the
future be one of the largest oil producers worldwide.
But Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, accompanied by
Lobao Sept. 2 at the inaugural ceremony for the first oil production
in presalt rocks off Espirito Santo state, demurred, saying that Brazil
has been investing in its refining capacity in order to become an
exporter of fuel, not crude oil.
In June, Lobao made similar claims based on the fact that Bra-

nations in Jeddah. “The simple fact that we were invited for an
emergency meeting means, in my view, OPEC intends to invite us
to join, if not now, then in the short run,” Lobao had said.

Diesel fuel sales decline at US truck stops
Diesel fuel sales have declined at US truck stops in response to
higher prices, a national association of truck stop and travel plaza
operators reported.
A survey of its 1,100 members also showed that gasoline purchases increased slightly, with a huge shift from premium and
midgrade to regular, NATSO said. The Alexandria, Va.,-based trade
association was founded in 1960 as the National Association of
Truck Stop Operators.
NATSO said the survey found that the average monthly diesel
sales volume fell 5.2% year-to-year to 906,700 gal in June and
4.5% to 898,109 gal in July. During that period, it noted, data
compiled by Oil Price Information Service showed that truckers
paid an average $1.74/gal more in June and $1.76/gal more in
July than a year earlier.
The declines began after volumes began 2008 with strong
growth, NATSO said. Sales were 6% higher year-to-year in January
and February, 2.5% lower in March and 2% higher in April before
falling sharply (5.8%) in May, it indicated.
Meanwhile, NATSO members reported that gasoline sales volumes at their truck stops grew an average 1.5% year-to-year in June
and 1.8% in July. Premium gasoline sales fell 17% in June and 19%
in July, while mid-grade gasoline sales declined nearly 13% in June
and 16% in July, the association said.
It said OPIS data show gasoline prices were $1.03/gal higher
year-to-year in June and $1.09/gal higher in July.
The US Energy Information Administration reported Aug. 25
that retail diesel fuel prices fell for a sixth consecutive week to an
average $4.145/gal nationwide but remained $1.282/gal higher
than their level a year earlier. ✦

OMV begins Austrian gas production
To boost Austria’s energy supply, OMV AG has started natural gas
production from Strasshof and Ebenthal fields in the Vienna basin.
The company’s domestic production will increase by
20%—about 40,000 boe/d—until 2010. OMG said it cost €210
million to bring the fields on stream.
Strasshof, which holds an estimated 4 billion cu m of reserves,
was discovered in 2005. OMV has since drilled four additional
wells and spent €175 million to construct gas processing facilities
and expand the existing sour gas treatment plant at Aderklaa. At

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

the first expansion stage, Strasshof’s maximum production will be
4,000 boe/d—20% of the company’s overall production.
Ebenthal, which has gas reserves of 1.5 billion cu m, cost €35
million to develop. OMV built gas treatment facilities and revamped the Auersthal compressor station. A 16-km pipeline will
link the field to the compressor station. Ebenthal output will hit
3,000 boe/d in September, which will represent 15% of OMV’s
domestic gas production.
OMV will invest €250 million in 2008 and again in 2009 to
boost Austrian oil and gas production for long-term supply secu-

rity by optimizing production of its mature oil fields as well as
exploring for new reserves.
“Environmentally sound production technologies and low
emissions are particularly important for OMV,” a company spokesperson said. “With Baumgarten becoming an increasingly important Central European gas hub, additional gas storage opportunities
are being investigated.”
At the end of 2007, OMV’s Austrian reserves were 143 million
boe, with natural gas reserves of 14.8 billion cu m and crude oil
reserves of 56 million bbl.

Total seeks Syrian oil block PSA extension
Total SA Chief Executive Christophe de Margerie will accompany French president Nicolas Sarkozy on a recent state visit to Syria
aiming to negotiate the extension of an oil block agreement.
A spokesperson for the French firm said De Margerie wants
Syria to extend the existing production-sharing agreement for the
Deir Ezzor area in the northwestern part of the country by 10 years
to 2021 from 2011.
Discussions between the two sides began in early April over the
current agreement, signed in 1988, which allows Total to produce
some 30,000 b/d of oil at Deir Ezzor.
At the time, Syrian Oil Minister Sufian Al Alao said the government wanted to boost oil production levels by awarding exploration contracts to international companies.
His statement came just days after Syria signed an agreement
with China National Petroleum Corp. to build a 100,000-b/d refinery in the same region as the Total concession.
“The refinery would process heavy crude oil produced in Deir
Ezzor area,” the oil minister told a news conference on the sidelines
of an oil and gas show in Damascus.
CNPC would own 85% of the refinery, while Syria would own
the rest, he said. Syria would buy products from the refinery, he
added without saying how much the refinery would cost.
Al Alao also said plans were proceeding on another refinery at
Deir Ezzor having a processing capacity of 140,000 b/d. It is set to
be built jointly with Kuwait’s Noor Investment Group.

Delaware basin shales strain for economics
The Mississippian Barnett shale has the potential to be a prolific
gas producer in the Delaware basin, write geoscientists in the AAPG
Bulletin.
One well is reported to have an estimated ultimate recovery of 9
bcf, said Travis J. Kinley of Texas Christian University and fellow authors. Drilling and stimulation costs to as deep as 18,000 ft began at
more than $18 million and have been reduced to about $8 million.
Interval A at the top of the Lower Barnett typically has resistivities of 50-100 ohm-m and “is believed to be a significant zone of
gas saturation within the Barnett,” they reported.
For the most part, however, shale gas plays in the basin have
resisted efforts for viable economic development.
Both the Barnett and Devonian Woodford shales should be evaluated, but silica content is less than in the Fort Worth basin. Shale is
brittle and will not fracture as well, and proppant embedment may
be a problem, the authors wrote.
8

Shales can slough in horizontal wells, and the high pressures
challenge frac pumping equipment.
Even so, a few wells have made initial flow rates of up to 3
MMcfd, and IP at the best well was 5 MMcfd, but decline rates are
steep. Chesapeake Energy Corp. and Hallwood Energy Corp. have
commercial gas sales.
Using logs from 150 wells in a study area of 500 sq miles in
the northern part of the basin in West Texas and Southeast New
Mexico, Kinley el al. said that areas for future exploration focus can
be delineated by mapping a net resistivity greater than 50 ohm-m.
No core was available, but the group studied mud logs and cuttings
from five wells.
They noted that the first Delaware basin shale gas wells were
drilled in southwestern Reeves County in 2002, and shale gas activity in West Texas has waxed and waned over the last 5 years.
They also noted that it took years to discover the correct combination of drilling and completion techniques to tap gas in the
Barnett shale in the Fort Worth basin.

Talisman encouraged by Utica shale test
Talisman Energy Inc. announced what it calls encouraging results for its Quebec unconventional program following a Utica
shale test.
The Gentilly vertical well, a reentry to a previously drilled Trenton-Black River well, flowed 800 Mcfd from one completed interval on a sustained basis on test for 18 days.
At the time of the shutin, the well was still cleaning up, and
pressures and flow rates were constant.
Talisman, holding a 75% interest, operates the Gentilly well,
which is on the south side of the St. Lawrence River about 100 km
south of Quebec City.
John A. Manzoni, Talisman president and chief executive officer, said additional testing is planned for the well, including zones
within the Basal Lorraine and Lorraine shale formation.
The Lorraine shale sits on top of the Utica and can be up to
6,500 ft thick. The Utica shale is 300-1,000 ft thick.
Early indications show both the Lorraine and Utica rocks are
thick, porous, and appear brittle and over pressured, all of which
are conducive to artificial fracture stimulation.

Gassco lets seabed surveys contract
Gassco AS has let a contract to Sweden’s Marine Matteknikk AB
to start seabed surveys in September for potential carbon dioxide
pipelines.
The company will shoot 636 km of seabed surveys over 19 days.
Data will be collected to determine transport routes to be further
developed during the preengineering phase in first quarter 2009.
The work underpins Gassco’s investigation to transport captured
CO2 from flue gas emitted by Naturkraft’s 420-Mw gas-fired power
plant at Karsto and the thermal power plant under development at
Mongstad. Gassco is working with Gassnova SF and the Norwegian
Petroleum Directorate to develop technical solutions.
“Suitable locations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf shall
be evaluated for the sequestration of the captured CO2,” Gassco
said. ✦

Sevan orders drilling equipment for deepwater rigs
Sevan Marine ASA has let a $240 million contract to Aker Solutions to provide two drilling equipment packages and possibly a
third for deepwater drilling rigs that are under construction.
“The contracts will cover delivery of complete drilling packages
consisting of engineering and equipment deliveries,” Sevan said.
Aker Solutions will deliver equipment for Sevan’s first drilling
rig in 2009. A spokesman from Sevan Marine told OGJ that both
rigs were deepwater floaters based on the cylindrical Sevan 650 design. The rigs are capable of operating in 10,000 ft of water. “One
rig will drill off Brazil and the other [off] India.”
The rig for Brazil will start operations in mid-2009 in the Santos presalt cluster basin. The other, for India’s Oil & Natural Gas
Corp. Ltd., will be delivered in 2010.

Petrobras begins Jubarte presalt oil production
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, aboard platform JK
P-34, has launched oil extraction from the presalt layer of Jubarte
field in the Campos basin off the state of Espirito Santo.
Petrobras will use the P-34 platform, which has been producing
from other undersea wells since December 2006, to produce the
first presalt crude, estimated at 18,000 b/d at full capacity.
The firm also said that production from the well will provide
knowledge that will help it develop the presalt reserves in Espirito
Santo and in other areas off the Brazilian coast.
“This is the fundamental data that will be used to develop these
new areas,” said Petrobras E&P director Guilherme Estrella, who
added that Jubarte field will accelerate the learning process needed
to bring online other large presalt fields such as Tupi.

West Don field in the UK North Sea, which is expected to start production in second-quarter 2009, along with Don Southwest field.
The company is using the Transocean John Shaw semisubmersible
drilling rig.
The fields, 150-km northeast of the Shetland Islands, are in 170
m of water. West Don is on Blocks 211/13b and 211/18a. Petrofac
will drill seven wells on the fields over the next year, with three
sequential wells on West Don prior to moving across to Don Southwest early in 2009.
Petrofac has begun laying the infield pipelines and export infrastructure for the fields’ development. Pipeline trenching is also
complete. The installation of the subsea structures and diving tieins is scheduled to start at the end of August.
Initially oil will be exported by offshore tanker loading for 6
months and then will switch to pipeline export via a subsea line to
Lundin Petroleum’s Thistle platform and the Brent pipeline system.
Terms have now been agreed with Lundin Petroleum for the export
service.
Don Southwest’s oil production is expected to hit 12,000 b/d at
peak rate and will decline over 10 years. It will cost £200 million
to bring on stream.
Petrofac will invest £200 million to drill two production wells
and one water injection well in West Don, where Petrofac hopes to
produce 20,000 b/d of oil at peak rate.
“The project remains on target for first oil production during the first half of 2009, delivering significant value for Petrofac
and the field’s joint venture partners,” said Bill Dunnett, executive
vice-president, project development, for Petrofac Energy Developments.
Petrofac Energy Developments operates both Don Southwest,
with a 60% working interest, and West Don 27.7% working interest. ✦

Chevron plans base oil plant at Pascagoula, Miss.

Napesa to build Saenz Pena, Argentina, reﬁnery

Chevron Corp. has applied to the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality for an environmental permit to build a premium base oil facility at the company’s 330,000 b/d refinery in
Pascagoula, Miss. The refinery produces gasoline, jet fuel, diesel,
and other products.
The base oil facility is expected to produce about 25,000 b/d
of premium base oil for use in manufacturing high-performance
lubricants such as motor oils for consumer and commercial uses.
The facility will use Chevron’s proprietary isodewaxing technology, which results in higher yields and enables use of a broader
range of crude oil feedstocks.
Chevron expects to begin construction in early 2009 and to
complete in 2011.
“These oils are the primary ingredients in the production of
top-tier motor oils needed to improve fuel economy, lower tailpipe emissions, and extend the period between oil changes,” said
Dale Walsh, president, Chevron global lubricants.

Argentina’s Chaco province, which recently announced plans
to promote oil exploration, has signed a letter of intent with local
firm Empresa Nacional de Petroleo SA (Napesa) for the construction of an oil refinery in Saenz Pena.
The provincial government said the refinery, to be built with a
combination of public and private investment, is slated to begin
operating in March or April 2009 and will produce gasoline, fuel
oil, asphalt, and diesel.
Napesa has agreed to provide the materials and services to construct and start up the refinery, while the provincial government
will create a fund to guarantee the supply of crude oil for the operations.
The announcement follows reports in July that the Chaco government passed Decree 1884, which authorizes the provincial
Ministerio de Infraestructura, Obras, Servicios Publicos y Medio
Ambiente to award permits and contracts for the exploration and
production of oil and gas.

Colombian oil line to link Rubiales ﬁeld

Woodside puts North West Shelf Train 5 online

A contract has been awarded for construction of a 24-in.,
235-km pipeline to connect Rubiales heavy oil field in east-central
Colombia to the OCENSA pipeline.
Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp., Toronto, and Ecopetrol SA awarded the contract to Consorcio Rubiales-Monterrey, a joint venture of
Spiecapag and Ismocol. The pipeline is to be called Oleoducto de
los Llanos Orientales.
The line will extend from Rubiales field on the Rubiales and
Piriri association contract areas in Meta Province to the OCENSA
Monterrey station in Casanare Province. Completion is set for Sept.
30, 2009.
Capital commitments for the project so far include $320 million, including $190 million for the lump-sum fixed-price contract, the pipe, and procurement of long lead time items. Contract
for the Rubiales pump station is to be awarded separately.
The local partner Ismocol de Columbia has 20 years of experience in the Colombia oil and gas industry.
Pacific Rubiales, which will own 35% of the pipeline, said the
project will “leverage the future development of the very prospective Los Llanos heavy oil basin.”

The North West Shelf gas project’s fifth LNG train at the Woodside Petroleum-operated facilities on the Burrup Peninsula near
Karratha in Western Australia has been brought on stream.
The Train 5 project, built at a cost of $2.6 billion (Aus.), includes the fifth train, a jetty extension, and a second LNG loadout
berth. In addition the Burrup plant has been provided with two
more power generation units, a third LPG fractionation unit, a new
fuel-gas compressor, an acid gas removal unit, and a third boil-off
gas compressor.
The new train has increased the gas project’s capacity by 4.4
million tonnes/year to a total output of 16.3 million tonnes/
year.
Woodside operates the new infrastructure for a consortium
consisting of itself, BHP Billiton, BP Developments Australia, Chevron Australia, Japan Australia (MiMi) and Shell Australia. All have a
one-sixth interest.

WBI to expand Grasslands pipeline capacity
Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co., (WBI) the wholly owned
natural gas transmission pipeline subsidiary of MDU Resources
Group Inc., reported it will expand firm transportation capacity
on its existing Grasslands Pipeline to 213 MMcfd from the current
138 MMcfd—a 54% increase. Project cost is expected to be about
$28 million.
The 253-mile Grasslands pipeline extends from the Powder
River basin in northeastern Wyoming to western North Dakota,
where it connects with the Northern Border pipeline.
The project will include the construction of two new compressor stations; one in western North Dakota near Golva, the other in
the far corner of southeastern Montana near the Wyoming border. Additional horsepower also will be added to an existing compressor station near Manning, ND. The targeted in-service date is
August 2009, pending timely receipt of the necessary regulatory
approvals.
Williston Basin conducted an open season on the expansion
project in early July, seeking customer commitment for the additional capacity, and the resulting strong customer demand resulted
in the expansion project. The Grasslands pipeline held an initial
capacity of 80 MMcfd when it was placed in service in late 2003.
Since installation, the pipeline has been incrementally expanded,
bringing firm transportation capacity to its current total.

Enterprise books Barnett shale shipping
Affiliates of Enterprise Products Partners LP have signed longterm agreements with major Barnett shale natural gas producers
for about 900 MMcfd on its 1.1 bcfd-capacity Sherman Extension pipeline. Enterprise also will construct a pipeline to move gas
supplies produced from Barnett shale wells in Tarrant and Denton
Counties, Tex., to the Sherman Extension pipeline.
The 178-mile Sherman Extension runs from an interconnect
with Enterprise’s Texas intrastate system in Erath County, Tex., to
Grayson County, Tex., where it will connect to Boardwalk’s Gulf
Crossing interstate pipeline. Devon had been the primary capacity holder on the Sherman Extension under previous agreements.
Enterprise has the option to acquire as much as a 49% interest in
Gulf Crossing (OGJ, May 12, 2008, p. 55).
Enterprise also will build a 40-mile supply lateral from the Trinity River basin north of Arlington to an interconnect with the Sherman Extension near Justin, Tex. The new pipeline will consist of
30-in. and 36-in. pipe designed to provide as much as 1 bcfd of gas
takeaway capacity for producers in Tarrant and Denton counties.
The line also will have a lateral for gas produced from the Newark
East field in Wise County. Long-term agreements with major producers are in place to anchor these lines, which are expected to be
in service in third quarter 2009.
Enterprise completed a 42-mile section of the Sherman Extension from Erath County to Parker County, Tex., in August and commenced interim transportation service on it to markets utilizing
Enterprise’s Texas intrastate system. ✦

Warming letter questioned

______________

12

I note the letter from David Archibald
(Aug. 11, 2008, p. 12). As a chemical
engineer I found this objectionable for
its misuse of specific research data and
its general attempt to cloud the issue of
global warming with misleading and
spurious arguments. Let us examine the
following:
a) A search on the web leads us to
find that Archibald is on the board of
a business interest group, The Lavoisier
Group, established by the coal industry
in Australia, with the goal of protecting
that industry.1
b) Archibald starts with a statement
designed to confuse, about the logarithmic relationship of carbon dioxide to
global warming. Why do I say confuse?
Environmental scientists and modelers
know about this relationship, and this
effect is indeed included in the climate
models, so pointing it out does not
change the forecast in the slightest and
serves only as a distraction.
c) Archibald uses the University of
Chicago Modtran facility2 (Modtran is a
self-contained program which models
the physical atmosphere and computes
the effect that the atmosphere has on
propagated electromagnetic radiation,
e.g. visible light and thermal infrared)
to estimate the consequences of changes
in carbon dioxide. The University of
Chicago responded that Archibald makes
an error in using their program, as he
“multiplies the radiative forcing by
an absurdly low value of the climate
sensitivity parameter,” which renders his
results meaningless.3
d) In Archibald’s previous presentations, which are not peer-checked or
published in learned journals and on
which his letter appeared to be based,
he has been extremely selective with
the data used to come to his conclusions. “To undertake his computations,
which are supposed to indicate a strong
correlation of surface temperature to the
solar cycle, rather then use worldwide
temperature estimates (GISS, HadCRU,
etc.), he uses five stations, all from the
southeast continental US, all within
several hundred kilometers of each
other.” This same source continues, “In

order to make his ‘predictions’ of global
temperature response Archibald uses not
five stations but one station’s data (De
Bilt in Holland). One data point. Of the
thousands available. Strangely enough,
each station shows a cooling trend.”3
e) Archibald comes out with a strong
statement—“Atmospheric temperature
rose 0.7° in the 20th century; it has also
fallen by the same amount in the last 18
months”—but offers no basis to support
this claim. Another distraction. In fact,
real world data indicates that the warming up to 2007 is occurring at the upper
end of the projection.4
f) As for the sun’s activities, we have
many learned sources which contradict
Archibald flatly and say that the sun
cannot be responsible for present global
warming, such as from the British Royal
Society: “Direct satellite measurements
of solar activity show it has been declin-

I am not a climate scientist and do
not pretend to be one. However, a review
of published literature where articles
and papers are normally subject to peer
review and criticism, before as well
as after publication, far, far outweigh
anything Mr. Archibald and his fellow
skeptics may have to say on the subject.
It is my belief that letters of the nature
submitted by Mr. Archibald are intended
to create a sense of doubt and hesitation
for the lay public. Frankly, the message from Mr. Archibald sheds no new
light on the topic, and goes against the
consensus. The case for global warming
has been accepted by the vast majority
of global scientists and by governments,
and we need to act and to act now.

‘Fuelish’ gas savers
David N. Nakamura
Refining/Petrochemical
Editor
During the course of a normal work
day, OGJ editors typically receive many
press releases via e-mail publicizing
new products of technological developments. These announcements can be
anything from “breakthrough” technologies to incremental upgrades of older
technologies.
With the higher fuel prices the past
few summers, the number of e-mails
touting “gasoline-saving” devices seems
to increase in direct proportion to the
price of gasoline. This summer was no
exception.
And with the record-high prices this
past summer in the US, it is more likely
that consumers will fall for this gassaving silliness. Unfortunately, none of
these devices live up to the hype.

enhance the mixing or vaporization of
the air-fuel mixture.
Some products claim to “align” the
fuel molecules before entering the
engine. The manufacturers claim that
this alignment resulted in an optimum
burn, without describing how this actually worked.
One manufacturer even claims
that—using common materials available
at any hardware store and using their
conversion guide (for a low price of
$50, normally a $397 value)—one can
easily convert a car to run on a mixture
of water and gas. Reading the claims
on the product websites can be quite
entertaining.

enhancers (under the carburetor), mixture enhancers (others), internal engine
modifiers, accessory drive modifiers,
fuels and fuel additives, oils and oil
additives, driving habit modifiers, and
miscellaneous.
Of the more than 100 devices tested,
EPA found that four gave a small improvement in fuel economy; however,
these devices increased exhaust emissions. Installing them, according to
federal regulations, could be considered
illegal tampering.
Another six gave very small improvements in fuel economy, but would have
to be evaluated by the consumer for
cost effectiveness.

False claims

Tried-and-true methods

Sadly, there are probably a few
consumers that fall for these products
every year. Luckily for consumers, the
US Environmental Protection Agency
conducts regular testing of these products under its “Gas Saving and Emission
Reduction Devices Evaluation” program
(www.epa.gov/oms/consumer/reports.

increase gas mileage. It is jointly maintained by EPA and the US Department
of Energy.
The web site also features: comparisons of new and used vehicles in terms
of mileage, emissions, and safety; a

vehicles.
Its gas mileage tips include triedand-true methods such as: driving
more efficiently by observing speed
limits, reducing extra weight, and using
cruise control; maintaining a vehicles’
engine, air filter, and tire pressure; and
combining trips when possible.
Anyone tempted to try a gas-saving
product with outlandish claims should
remember the old adage: “If it sounds
too good to be true, it usually is.” ✦

Gustav a solid test
The oil and gas story from Hurricane Gustav is
that the disruption could have been worse. Part of
the reason it could have been worse is a bundle of
lessons taught by the storm’s nastier predecessors of
2005.
Gustav’s center made landfall near Morgan City,
La., in the late morning of Sept. 1 as a Category 2
hurricane, with maximum sustained wind speeds
near 110 mph. En route to Louisiana it crossed
much of the oil and gas producing area of the
Gulf of Mexico. It also idled a major segment of
the Gulf Coast refining, petrochemical, and gas
processing industry with personnel evacuations,
power outages, and the threat of physical damage.
According to the US Minerals Management,
the storm forced the shut-in of all Gulf of Mexico
oil production, 1.3 million b/d, and 95% of the
gulf’s gas production, 7 bcfd. The US Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity Delivery and
Energy Reliability reported 14 refineries closed
on Sept. 1, with total distillation capacity of 2.7
million b/d. That’s 15% of Oil & Gas Journal’s
estimate of total US refining capacity as of Jan. 1.
The DOE office said 10 other Gulf Coast refineries, with capacities totaling 3 million b/d, had
trimmed operations.
In preparation for Gustav, most oil and gas
pipelines suspended operations. Ports, including
the deepwater Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, closed.
Thirty-one major gas processing plants, representing a combined 16.1 bcfd of capacity, shut down.

prove to have been much less damaging than Hurricanes Katrina and Rita 3 years ago. That double
punch destroyed 115 platforms, damaged 52 others,
and hurt 535 pipeline segments. Combined, the two
storms set 19 mobile rigs adrift and at one point held
4.9 million b/d of refining capacity offline.
Katrina and Rita were stronger storms than
Gustav. They were Category 5 hurricanes while
over the gulf, with sustained wind speeds exceeding 155 mph. They came ashore as Category
3 storms, with winds speeds of 111-130 mph.
Gustav was a Category 3 hurricane during most of
its time over the gulf.
Still, Gustav was a major storm that slammed
the nexus of US hydrocarbon production and
processing. If it proves to have done little damage, a big part of the reason will be preparations
improved by the lessons of Katrina and Rita.

Tougher standards

After those hurricanes, the Minerals Management Service, American Petroleum Institute, and
company representatives collaborated on toughened design and assessment criteria aimed at
improving the abilities of offshore structures to
handle wind, waves, currents, and surge. MMS
published a rule adopting the new standards
before the start of the current hurricane season. An
area of major improvement since the 2005 storms,
API says, is the mooring of mobile drilling units.
Refiners and pipeline operators also fortified
their hurricane preparations in response to the
Gustav damage minimal
earlier storms, according to API. They have, for exAt this writing, on Sept. 3, companies were

beginning to inspect facilities. According to early
restoration of power after a storm and expanded
reports, damage was minimal. DOE said, for

contributing factors.
One early, urgent CSB recommendation was for BP to establish an independent panel to evaluate the corporate
safety culture at the company’s five US
refineries.
The panel, chaired by former US Sec.
of State James A. Baker III, made extensive recommendations for improved
safety leadership at BP’s corporate level.
The Baker Panel report was completed
in January 2007.

Industry reacts

Many oil companies launched voluntary, internal process safety management
(PSM) audits based on the Baker Panel
report and also CSB’s overall recommendations. Some have even conducted
process safety culture evaluations. The
Baker Panel concluded BP emphasized
personal safety to the detriment of process safety (OGJ, Jan. 28, 2008, p. 60).
John S. Bresland, CSB chairman and
chief executive officer, said, “The Baker
Panel report is one of the more significant reports written on the refining inPECIAL
dustry in the last 10-15 years. Much of
the refining industry is taking to heart
the recommendations.”
He added that oil companies and
chemical

OSHA audits reﬁneries
CSB said OSHA conducted only one
planned PSM inspection at the BP Texas
City refinery in 1998 despite numerous
fatal accidents during 1985 to 2005.
Other unplanned inspections, typically
narrower in scope, did occur.
OSHA fined BP more than $21 million on Sept. 22, 2005, for what CSB
called “more than 300 egregious and
willful violations” at the plant.
CSB recommended that OSHA
implement a national emphasis program (NEP) involving detailed refinery inspections. The refining NEP was
launched in June 2007. OSHA’s NEP
audits are scheduled to be finished
by June 2009, but some consultants
believe that deadline probably will be
extended in some regions with many
refineries.
Mike Marshall, PSM coordinator
in OSHA’s directorate of enforcement
programs, said Aug. 28 that OSHA
inspectors completed audits at 37 of 81
refineries subject to the NEP audits.
“Of those 37 refineries, we’ve issued
citations in 26,” Marshall said. “We’re
finding more deficiencies than we
expected.”

How reﬁners can prepare for NEP inspections by OSHA
Inspection teams from the US
Department of Occupational Safety
& Health Administration are visiting
reﬁneries as part of the National Emphasis Program (NEP).
Steve Arendt, a vicepresident with ABS
Consulting, said NEP
inspectors work from
two lists of questions.
An already published
list involves more than
90 “static” questions
Arendt
covering process
safety management (PSM) elements.
The other list includes “dynamic
questions,” which are undisclosed
in advance. During an audit, OSHA
inspectors randomly select 15-20 from
a list of 700 possible questions.
Arendt said NEP has its pros and
cons.
He said the audits will improve
process safety for companies that
might not already have been serious
about their obligations under the PSM
standard.
But he believes most reﬁners already strive for improved performance
and efﬁciency as deﬁned by the Center
for Chemical Process Safety’s riskbased process safety guideline.
“The NEP will create a tendency for
these companies to divert attention
and resources away from a good and
continuously improving job in process
safety in order to deal with, get ready
for, and protect themselves from the
NEP,” Arendt said.

tors as well as refiners. Counting both
refiners and contractors, OSHA has
completed 86 NEP inspections. As of
June 11, a total of 344 PSM citations
were issued, including proposed penalties of $2.15 million.

Citations issued
The most frequent NEP refining
citations involve mechanical integrity,

Mike Marshall, PSM Coordinator in
OSHA’s Directorate of Enforcement Programs agrees. “It would not be a good
situation if employers diverted attention and resources away from continually improving PSM systems to prepare
for an NEP inspection.”

Costs to reﬁners
The NEP program could prove costly
for reﬁners and could disrupt reﬁnery
operations by requiring the full-time
attention of certain reﬁnery employees
for a period of a few weeks to several
months or more.
“The major cost for a reﬁnery is
not necessarily the preparation, but
the time spent when OSHA is on site,”
Arendt said. “The inspectors are in
there with ﬁve or six people for weeks
to months. Then there is the cost of ﬁxing things, although many ﬁxes usually
are more analysis and paperwork than
capital.”
He estimates the NEP cost could
amount to “several million dollars” for a medium-size reﬁnery
(100,000-200,000 b/d). This includes
preparation time, the time to escort
OSHA inspectors around the reﬁnery
and answer questions, and the amount
of time needed for the company to
respond after the inspection.
Arendt recommends the following
steps before the OSHA NEP team arrives:
• Decide how to prepare, and
coordinate that preparation within the
company and reﬁnery.

process hazards analysis, operating procedures, and process safety information,
OSHA told participants of the Global
Congress on Process Safety.
The US has 151 refineries, but many
are exempt from NEP because they are

the OSHA standards. Other refineries are exempt because they are in the

counsel to address potential issues.
• Develop responses to OSHA’s
questions before the inspection team
arrives.
• Find and organize the records that
OSHA inspectors will request.
• Review the status of all process

and cost-analysis action items.
• Conduct limited compliance reviews for areas of concern.
• Develop a communication package for the NEP program by preparing
employees, supervisors, and management.
• Identify the reﬁnery subject matter
experts and personnel for liaising with
OSHA.
• Identify the process for satisfying
OSHA requests for documents, tours,
interviews, and photographs.
• Consider coordination and
information-sharing with other refineries in the company and with industry
groups.
Upon arrival of the OSHA NEP team,
Arendt recommends that a company:
• Assign a companion to accompany
inspectors and scheduled interviews.
• Coordinate OSHA’s document
requests and logistical needs.
• Conduct daily close-out meetings
with OSHA.
• Arrange for experts to be available to explain the reﬁnery’s “thought
process” on compliance with the NEP
inspection questions.

Bresland told OGJ that he hopes

are selected in part because of low injury and illness rates.

IPAMS Executive Director Marc W.
Smith said, adding that US House
Democrats—from Speaker Nancy Pelosi
(Calif.) to Chief Deputy Whip Diana
DeGette (Colo.)—continued repeating
the false allegation as their party held its
national convention in Denver.
House Natural Resources Committee
Chairman Nick J. Rahall (D-W.Va.) originally used the 68 million-acre figure
on June 12 to justify his proposed “Use
it or lose it” bill which would bar leaseholders from bidding on new tracts
unless they demonstrated that they were
diligently developing what they already
held (OGJ July 28, 2008, p. 25).
Republicans have charged that the
number came directly from environmental organizations. The Wilderness
Society said on May 29 that oil and gas
producers were only drilling 11.6 mil-

lion acres, or 25%, of the nearly 44.5
million acres leased from the US Bureau
of Land Management, but the figure did
not include offshore leases.
“Companies are doing all they can to
develop federal energy resources, but a
lease is not a green light to drill: It’s the
first step in a long, expensive process
that is fraught with bureaucratic red
tape and protests and lawsuits by environmental groups determined to stop
domestic energy development. In fact,
this year 100% of BLM lease sales in our
region have been protested,” Smith said
on Aug. 28.
He called a federal oil and gas lease
“no more than a definite maybe” because a producer “might” get through
environmental analyses and clear regulatory hurdles, “might” get permission

to drill, and “might not” see the project
delayed by lawsuits.
“Industry is in a classic Catch-22
situation whereby the government has
created a cumbersome process that
takes years to complete, environmental
groups exploit the process to throw up
legal roadblocks at every stage, and then
Congress and the environmental lobby
turn around and blame the industry for
not ‘diligently drilling,’” the IPAMS official continued.
“If Congress is really concerned
about undeveloped leases, it should
pass regulatory reforms that ensure
government agencies issue permits and
environmental analyses within reasonable timeframes and curb the abuses of
frivolous lawsuits and protests designed
to slow natural gas development,” he
maintained. ✦

will begin sending its energy resources
through Russia instead of Georgia, and
this question will be one of the main
points of Cheney’s visit.

While Cheney will doubtlessly
express concern over existing oil and

Azerbaijan is seen as the key potential supplier for the project, a 3,300-km
pipeline that would run via Turkey and
the Balkan states to Austria. Construction

completion set for 2013.
In competition with Nabucco, Russia backs the rival South Stream gas

BP, Chesapeake establish Fayetteville shale JV
BP America and Chesapeake Energy
Corp. plan to establish a joint venture
that will produce 180 MMcfd of gas
equivalent from shale assets in Arkansas.
According to a letter of intent signed
Sept. 2, BP will pay $1.9 billion for a
25% interest in Chesapeake’s Fayetteville
shale assets. The assets cover 540,000
net acres, which the companies believe
could support the drilling of as many as
6,700 future horizontal wells. Following the deal’s completion, BP will own
135,000 net acres and Chesapeake will
own 405,000 net acres.

said TNK-BP Chief Operating Officer
Tim Summers, who added that Considine’s work had improved the company’s
bottom line.

The Iraqi Ministry of Oil, renegotiating an agreement first signed more than
a decade ago, has approved arrangements that will allow state-owned China
National Petroleum Co. to develop
Ahdab oil field.
The agreement, which restores a
project that was cancelled after the
2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, was
signed by Chinese officials and Iraqi Oil
Minister Hussain al-Shahristani.
Under the contract,
which still requires approval of the Iraqi and Chinese
governments, CNPC will
provide technical advisers,
oil workers, and equipment to increase production at the field,
which is in Wasit province, about 160
km southeast of Baghdad.
Shahristani said the two sides agreed
to renegotiated terms of a deal signed
in 1997. He said the contract has been
changed to a set-fee service deal from
the oil production-sharing agreement
signed earlier.
CNPC will help Ahdab produce
110,000 b/d, up from the originally
agreed 90,000 b/d, with first output
expected in 3 years. According to Shahristani, the field should have an active
life of some 20 years.
Ahdab field is estimated to contain
about 4.54 billion bbl of original oil in
place, of which 955 million bbl is believed to be recoverable (see map, OGJ,
Mar. 24, 2003, p. 43). Iraq National Oil
Co. drilled four wells in Ahdab field in
the late 1970s and early 1980s (OGJ,
Apr. 14, 1997, p. 21).
CNPC will own 75% of the joint
venture, with Iraq’s state-owned Northern Oil Co. owning the remaining 25%.
Shahristani said the contract, currently
valued at some $3 billion, would be
reviewed every quarter over its 22-year
term.
Analysts saw the agreement as a
breakthrough for China and CNPC over
other countries and international oil
companies.

it has become more and more difficult
to obtain equity and exploit rights in
oil fields, said it is good for China to
participate in the development through
a service contract.
Alex Munton, an analyst with
consultant Wood Mackenzie, said the
biggest significance of the agreement is
that CNPC will benefit as the first international oil company to be developing
one of the giant discovered oil fields in
Iraq in the new era.
According to Munton, CNPC will be
the first with people on the ground and
the first to develop a working relationship with Iraq’s Oil Ministry.

IOC deals rejected
Iraqi oil ministry officials earlier
expressed hopes of signing contracts
with international oil companies by the
end of June. Now, according to ministry
spokespersons, those talks with such
firms as Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC,
and ExxonMobil Corp. are unlikely to
proceed.
Last week, a top Iraqi official criticized international oil companies for
trying to overcharge the war-torn nation and for ignoring what he referred
to as their “humanitarian” duty to help
develop Iraq’s battered oil industry.
The charge came after Iraq delayed
the signing of short-term oil service
contracts with oil majors due to disagreements over payment terms and
their duration.
“The invitations to take part in these
projects have not only an economic but
a humanitarian character,” said Iraq’s
electricity minister Karim Waheed after
meetings with Russian energy minister
Sergei Shmatko and the heads of Russian energy service firms.
“Some companies in those cases
demanded sky-high prices for their
services, thinking Iraq does not have a
grasp of international financial markets.
They were unpleasantly surprised when
they found out we fully understand
global commodity markets and global
stock markets,” Waheed said. ✦

Woodside-led JV starts oil output from Vincent ﬁeld
Oil production has started from
Vincent field in the Carnarvon basin
production license WA-28-L off Western
Australia, reported Woodside Petroleum Ltd., the field’s lead joint venture
partner.
The company says that hookup, testing, and commissioning of the Maersk Ngujima-Yin floating production,
storage, and offloading vessel has been
completed and that the field is now on
stream. The vessel has a storage capacity
of 1.2 million bbl.
Initial field production is from
six subsea wells and the flow rate is
expected to increase steadily to 50,000

b/d within the next few weeks before a
natural decline to about 40,000 b/d by
yearend.
This first stage of development has
cost $1 billion (Aus.).
The second stage will begin early in
2009 to bring at least two additional
wells on line to maintain a steady flow.
Vincent field, discovered by Woodside in 1998, has estimated reserves of
about 73 million bbl. The field lies 50
km northwest of Exmouth in 350 m of
water.
Woodside, operator, holds 60%
interest. Mitsui E&P Australia holds the
remaining 40%. ✦

Falcon buys into PetroHunter US, Australia assets
Falcon Oil & Gas Ltd., Denver, has
approved binding agreements with
PetroHunter Energy Corp. to acquire
shares in two PetroHunter projects in
the US and Australia.
Falcon will pay $7 million for a 25%
working interest in five wells in PetroHunter’s 20,000-acre Buckskin Mesa
unconventional gas project in Colorado’s Piceance basin.
The funds will be used to complete
and test the wells, and if testing is successful, Falcon has the option to acquire
an additional 25% working interest in
the wells and a 50% working interest in
the overall Buckskin Mesa project.
The Buckskin Mesa option requires
Falcon to pay an additional $18 million
in spending commitments for a drilling
and development program, and $25
million in cash or convertible Falcon
shares. In addition, Falcon would have
an option to become operator of the
Buckskin Mesa project, in which case it
would pay an additional $3.5 million
in cash or securities convertible into
Falcon shares.

Beetaloo basin
The second agreement is to acquire a
50% working interest in PetroHunter’s

7-million-acre Beetaloo basin prospect
in Northern Territory, Australia, for $5
million in cash and $20 million of securities convertible into Falcon shares.
PetroHunter will remain operator of
the Beetaloo basin (see map, OGJ, June
27, 1994, p. 60).
The agreements, however, provide
for a joint operating committee and direct involvement by Falcon managerial,
technical, and financial personnel.
The transactions are subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals, and the Buckskin Mesa transaction
is subject to settlement of an outstanding PetroHunter litigation regarding the
Buckskin Mesa project.
Because Marc A. Bruner, Falcon’s
chairman, chief executive, and president, is a major PetroHunter shareholder, the Falcon board formed a committee of independent directors to evaluate
and approve the transactions.
Buckskin Mesa is in Rio Blanco
County 5 miles west of Meeker,

Los Aceites-1 encountered the same
sand package, with better log characteristics, as in the Primavera-1 well 3.3 km
north. Primavera-1 tested 650 b/d of
oil from the C-7.
Solana operates the Guachiria block
with 100% working interest, and Lewis
Energy Colombia holds a 30% beneficial interest in the block.

Ghana
The overall capital expenditure for
first phase development of Jubilee field
off Ghana is estimated at $3.1 billion,
excluding the cost of leasing the FPSO,
said Tullow Oil PLC.
The field is to start up in 2010 with
17 producing and injection wells and
facilities capable of processing more
than 120,000 b/d of oil and 160
MMcfd of gas and injecting more than
230,000 b/d of water. The port of Takoradi is being upgraded to support the
field’s development.
Produced gas initially is to be split
between reinjection to improve oil recovery and shipment to shore for power
generation.

New Zealand
Cue Energy Resources Ltd., Melbourne, acquired a 20% interest in the
5,341 sq km PEP 38494 in the southern
Taranaki basin of New Zealand.
Cue Energy will earn the interest
under a farmout from Todd Exploration by funding 30% of the cost of the
Matariki-1 well.
The block is 50 km offshore in
70-100 m of water. Besides the Matariki
prospect, it contains the Paua and Pike
leads.

Shell Exploration &
Production Co. launched
the truss spar for the
Perdido regional development on Aug. 8,
2008. After a 21⁄2-day
Drilling
sail, it reached location at
Alaminos Canyon Block
857, about 200 miles south of Freeport,
Tex., about 8 miles north of the international maritime border with Mexico.
The spar was upended and attached
to three of nine mooring lines (Fig. 1).
The regional spar with DVA (direct
vertical access) wells is moored in about
8,000 ft of water and will gather, process, and export production from three
fields: Great White, Tobago, and Silvertip, in a 15-km radius (Fig. 2).
Called the “Perdido Regional Host,”
it will serve as a common processing
hub; the topsides will include a rig for
additional drilling and completions.
There will be 22 DVA wells from
the spar, with an additional eight
tiebacks from subsea completions. The
spar is designed to process as much as
130,000 boe/d (100,000
bo/d and 200 MMcfd of
natural gas) from wettree production systems.
Perdido is the first Gulf of
Mexico spar to have hydrocarbon storage tanks for
flow assurance.
Shell is the designated
operator of the Perdido
development and has 35%
working interest in the
regional spar, along with
Chevron USA Inc. (37.5%)
and BP Exploration & Production Inc. (27.5%).
Russell Ford, Shell’s vice-

O D U C T I O N

president, Technical of E&P Americas,
declined to provide the total estimated
cost for the project but said about half
the expenses are allocated for drilling
and half for facilities.
This is the first development to reach
production in the Lower Tertiary play in
the Gulf of Mexico.
Water depths range 7,500-10,000 ft,
and the seafloor topography is rugged
along the Perdido Fold Belt.

Shell’s Bert Ulbricht, Perdido offshore coordination manager, told OGJ
that the team planned to move the spar
at 4-5 knots/hr in open water. “This is
the most risky phase for the spar,” said
Dale Snyder, Perdido project manager.
After a 21⁄2-day sail across 160 km,
Heerema Marine Contractors upended
the spar in Alaminos Canyon Block 857,
rotating it to vertical from its horizontal tow position. It took about an hour
for the initial flooding to get the spar
within 15º of vertical but about 20 hr
to pump ballast water into the spar and
get it vertical.
Heerema’s DCV Balder was already
on location in Alaminos Canyon when
the spar left Kiewit’s yard. It would connect the spar to the first three moorings
over 10-13 days, in order to be “stormsafe,” Ulbricht said.
DCV Balder had preinstalled three
polyester/chain mooring lines to
seafloor anchor piles.
Shell’s Curtis Lohr, responsible for
conception and design of the Perdido
spar, told OGJ that this is Shell’s first
use of a polyester mooring system on a
production platform. The mooring lines
have a 20-year design life. Incorporating polyester takes weight off the spar,
reducing the vertical loading. This is one
of the weight reductions that allowed
Shell to use a smaller spar for the project. Lohr also said oil storage in the spar

reduces the topsides weight, keeping it
to a single lift.
The topsides will be completed and
will sail out in February 2009, aboard
the OC 4126, the largest US-flagged
deck barge, and towed by Candies vessels. The topsides will be mated with
the spar in a single lift using Heerema’s
DCV Thialf.
Once completed, Shell says the steel
spar structure will be 882 ft from the
keel to the top of the drilling derrick,
nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower.

Construction
Shell chose a spar after considering FPSO and semisubmersible designs
because the project needed a stable
floating platform to support a platform
rig in deep water. This is the first Lower
Tertiary production and the Perdido
reservoirs may be difficult to produce
because they are highly fractured and
are low-pressure. The company anticipates that a lot of well work may
be required, such as sidetracks and
interventions. Shell’s BC-10’s FPSO in
Brazil, by comparison, has no drilling
and completions rig.
Shell awarded Technip SA an engineering, procurement, and construction
(EPC) contract for the Perdido production spar, umbilicals, and mooring
system (OGJ, Nov. 27, 2006, p. 9). The
contract covered spar and mooring system design and fabrication, which was
managed through Technip’s operations
and engineering center in Houston;
load out onto the heavy transport vessel; transportation and quayside delivery
to Kiewit’s Gulf of Mexico yard; and
design of the steel catenary risers, top
tension risers, and umbilicals.
Shell’s Lohr said the company ordered
steel in July 2006, although the contract
with Technip was not formalized until
November 2006. Technip began building the spar in November 2006 at its
construction yard in Pori, Finland.
The spar sailed from Finland on May
27, 2008, aboard Dockwise Shipping
BV’s Mighty Servant I (Fig. 3). MS1 is
a 29,000-tonne, 190-m long, heavy
transport vessel.

The Perdido spar sails from Finland in May 2008 in a dry lift aboard Dockwise Shipping BV’s Mighty
Servant I.The tops of the six risers will attach to the bottom of the spar’s soft tank, shown above (Fig. 3;
photo from Shell).
On June 19, after a 8,200-mile sea
voyage, the spar arrived at Kiewit Offshore Services 400-acre fabrication yard
in Ingleside along the La Quinta shipping channel in Corpus Christi Bay.
Shell, Technip, and Kiewit completed
the final outfitting in preparation for
offshore installation. This included floating the spar off the Mighty Servant I,
removing the seafastenings and flotation tanks, and installing the remaining
strakes, anodes, and installation aids
(Fig. 4).
The Perdido spar weighs 20,956
tonnes and has a total height of 173.3
m (555 ft) and a diameter of 35.97 m
(118 ft).
Kiewit began building the topsides

in March 2007 and will finish by February 2009. Topsides includes production equipment, drilling rig, and living
quarters for 150. Snyder told OGJ the
quarters are rated as a temporary refuge
with fire and blast-resistant firewalls;
water and foam fire-extinguishing systems cover the entire deck.
The topsides will include an Astech
aluminum helideck, designed by Houston-based Zentech Inc. and supplied
to Delta Engineering Corp. The helideck has an automatic fire-suppression
system and a grooved surface to carry
away any flammable fluids and can accommodate two long-range Sikorsky
S92 helicopters simultaneously, each
capable of holding up to 24 passengers

semisubmersibles are all potential
platforms for deepwater developments.
Spars are distinct from semisubs and
TLPs in that the center of gravity of a
spar is always lower than the center of
buoyancy, which guarantees a positive gravitational moment, making it
very stable. Spars also have a different
motion-control mechanism.
Spars derive no stability from their
mooring systems and should not list or
capsize even when completely disconnected from the moorings.
The earliest spar design had a solid
caisson hull, exemplified by Neptune
(1997), Genesis (1999), and HooverDiana (2000).
This evolved into the truss spar
by replacing the lower section of the
caisson hull with a truss, beginning
in 2002 with spars for Boomvang,
Nansen, and Horn Mountain, and followed by nine others, 2003-06.
Kikeh was the first spar installed
outside the Gulf of Mexico; Murphy Oil
Corp. installed it off Malaysia in 2007.
Anadarko installed a cell spar on Red
Hawk in 2004, in 5,300 ft water depth.

The goal was met by installing a
surge bottle and sending vapors from
the surge bottle directly to the second
stage of the compressor. This reduced
the load on the first stage in two ways.
First, the low-pressure gas from the
HLP that would have gone to the storage tank and then to Stage 1 now went
from the surge bottle directly to Stage 2.
Secondly, lower pressure liquid drained
from the surge bottle to the storage
tank, so that flashing the oil to the storage tank generated fewer vapors.

Singh, et al., developed a correlation
that predicts viscosity of unrefined bitumen and heavy oils.3 Equations 1 and
2 in the attached equation box show
Singh’s correlation.
We tested this correlation using four
residual heavy oils obtained from the
Lukoil Neftochim Bulgaria (LNB) vacuum distillation and visbreaking units.
Table 1 shows measured and calculated values of the viscosity of the virgin
vacuum residues and unconverted

the range 208° C. to 443° C., and the
aromatics content varied from 21% to
87%. Olefins content varied between 0
vol % and 32 vol %.
This wide variation allowed us to
determine the effect of the gas oil’s distillation (molecular weight) and chemical nature on the viscosity-temperature
dependence.

Testing correlations
Our study tested these correlations:
1. Equations 5 and 6. Kinematic
viscosity correlation of Singh et al.6
2. Equations 7-9. Correlation of
Amin and Maddox as cited by Singh.6
3. Equations 10 and 11. Correlation
used in the software simulator ChemCAD.7 Viscosity is computed on the
basis of the gas oil’s distillation properties and density.
4. Equations 12-18 that predict
parameters a and b for each gas oil
investigated in this study (Table 3). We
used Goossens’ correlations for molecu48

lar weight and hydrogen content.8 9
Table 4 shows the relative deviation
between measured and calculated values
using the four correlations. The relative
deviation is different for all fractions
and all correlations. All the correlations
exhibited the highest relative deviation
for the FCC slurry although there was
a significant difference between the accuracy of the tested correlations.
Accuracy of the correlations was, in
diminishing order: Singh’s correlation,
regression, ChemCAD, correlation of
Amin and Maddox.
Singh’s correlation is also the most
appropriate because it requires only one
viscosity test at an arbitrary temperature. This study used data of viscosity
of the middle distillates at 20° C. and
viscosity of heavy gas oils at 50° C.
The correlation of Amin and Maddox
was not applicable to HVGOs. ✦

TERMINAL SITING—1

Establishing critical
parameters in screening
for siting LNG terminals
helps focus eventual
development on the objectives of the principal
LNG
stakeholders: developer,
supplier, and end users.
Proper site selection and design can
determine whether a site is acceptable
for further consideration and study. Further
study may reveal additional site deficiencies,
but high-level initial
screening focuses work
on the most viable sites.
This first of two
articles assesses the factors leading to
onshore or offshore terminal location and the influence of LNG vessels
on potential marine terminal siting.
The concluding article, next week, will
consider land requirements for onshore

Setting parameters early

locations, including soil and seismic
conditions and site elevations.
Parameters discussed in the two
articles include:
• LNG import-export facility physical
criteria. These include population density, plant area, maximum-minimum
distance from loading-unloading to
storage, type of storage, site elevation
relative to 100-year flood elevation,
approach channel width and depth,
any constraints on ship passage (such
as bridges or overhead power lines),
maneuvering area and depth, required
underkeel clearance, environmental
limitations (wind, wave, current), need
for breakwater, allowable downtime,
and availability of tugs.
• LNG vessel characteristics. Vessel type
(membrane, spherical, or barge), vessel
capacity, length overall, beam, depth,
loaded, and draft air draft.
• LNG pipeline. Pipeline capacity, proximity to regasification site, commercial
requirements, gas quality, and proximity to end users.
Identification of potential sites
for development into export-import
terminals is an essential first step in
predevelopment of any LNG project.
Setting critical parameters to be used
in the screening process helps focus a
project on the principal stakeholders’
objectives.

Background
Good site selection can eliminate
or minimize many of the hazards and
risks associated with shipping, storage,
and sendout from terminals.1 It is in
the best interests of the industry that its
safety record remains clean.
As of May 2008 five import terminals and one export plant were operating in the US, with many more being
designed or constructed. Terminals
operating as of May 2008 were:2

• Kenai, Alas. (the only export
plant). Kenai exports LNG to Japan.
Fig. 1 shows terminals under jurisdiction of the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Gulf Gateway Energy
Bridge is under US Maritime Administration jurisdiction. Several terminals have
planned commissioning dates in 2008.
FERC lists 47 North American proposed
or expanded terminals.3
At the beginning of 2008, worldwide there were 26 liquefaction plants
in 15 countries. In contrast, there were
60 import, or regasification, marine
terminals, on or offshore, spread across
18 different countries. More than 270
LNG tankers deliver LNG to more than
40 ports around the world.
In addition to these terminals, about
73 liquefaction projects and 182 regasification projects are either proposed or
under construction around the world.
Proposed terminals will likely not all
be constructed. Table 1 lists countries
having present or future export and
import terminals.4 The locations display a
wide variety of likely design conditions.
Some of the countries lie in high seismic
zones, some in areas where typhoons or
hurricanes could affect operations.
Rigorous siting reviews coupled with
separation and distance requirements
found in US safety codes can reduce
risk to the public. Other countries have
similar requirements. Dangers to the
public from a catastrophic event can
also be reduced or eliminated by establishing appropriate separation distances
early in a project.

Design guidelines
The LNG industry has established an
excellent safety record over the years.
Since Sept. 11, 2001, however, the public has become increasingly concerned
about vulnerability to terrorist attacks.
The LNG industry has not escaped
resulting heightened public scrutiny.
Some of the concern stems from public
misconceptions about the properties
of LNG. The industry has tried to ease
these concerns with factual documents

Onshore LNG import terminals might require a breakwater such as used by Sempra at its Costa Azul
terminal in Baja California, Mexico.The absence of a breakwater could lead to manifold motions extending beyond the working range of the arms unloading the ship (Fig. 2).

providing information in an understandable form. Public agencies have
also implemented measures to further
reduce public risk. In Boston Harbor,
the US Coast Guard has put the waters
near any LNG ship off limits to small
boats or any kind of shipping.
The US Department of Energy says
LNG tankers are unlikely to explode.
LNG only becomes flammable if it
vaporizes and mixes with air in the
correct proportions. LNG is not transported under pressure but in cryogenic
liquid form under normal atmospheric

pressure. Finally, the tankers are built to
withstand incidents such as collisions or
bad weather and their multihull design
has proven to be robust. Eight incidents
involving LNG tankers spilling their
cargoes have occurred over the last few
decades and in no case was there an
explosion or fire. Released LNG typically
regasifies and disperses, rising harmlessly
into the atmosphere, according to DOE.5

ity to gas markets or production areas,
respectively. Once a general location
has been identified, establishing critical parameters a site must meet allows
evaluation of alternative sites within
that area.
These parameters include land area
and use, existing marine facilities, adjacent and nearby property use, population density, maximum-minimum
distance from loading-unloading to
storage, type of storage, site elevation
relative to 100-year flood elevation,
approach channel width and depth, any
constraints on ship passage (bridges,
overhead power lines, etc.), maneuvering area and depth, required underkeel
clearance, environmental limitations
(wind, wave, current), need for breakwater, allowable downtime, and availability of tugs.
Pipeline capacity, proximity to
regasification site, commercial requirements, gas quality, and location relative
to end users also stand as important
considerations. The ultimate goal of site
selection is to reduce transportation and
storage costs. A preferred terminal site
allows freedom of choice in design of
the facilities and lets the operator safely
carry out its activities.

Offshore facilities
Insufficient or inappropriate available
land areas, densely populated or recreational areas, and shallow or narrow
waterways can each prompt offshore
siting instead. An offshore facility may
also prove desirable if the shoreline
is sensitive to nearshore development
affecting marine life or ecosystems.
Environmental conditions such as wind,
waves, and current will influence the
detail design and layout of an offshore
terminal. Political hurdles such as per52

The World LNG Market Report 2008-2012

The World Onshore Pipelines Report 2008-2012

This new report examines the current and future prospects,
technologies and markets for the Liqueﬁed Natural Gas
sector. Gas currently accounts for nearly a quarter of all
energy consumption, and the IEA have forecast that gas
demand will grow at a faster rate than oil over the ﬁrst
quarter of this century. With many regions facing future gas
shortages, LNG offers an increasingly important method of
bringing gas from remote reserves to the market.

This report presents a comprehensive view of the historic market from 2003-2007 and forecast period from
2008-2012. The report also reviews all aspects of onshore
oil & gas pipelines from design, materials, techniques and
components through to construction, operations and maintenance and transportation. Geared to the needs of the
senior executive and assumes no previous reader knowledge of the subject area.

SUBSEA TIEBACK
FORUM & EXHIBITION

PennWell invites you to the 9th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition. SSTB has become the premier
event for one of the fastest growing field development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March
3 – 5, 2009 in San Antonio, TX at the Henry B. Gonzales Convention Center. Over 2,000 people and 150
exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference. You can’t afford to miss it.
This year’s theme is “The Deepest Show On Earth.” As our industry changes, the sharing of knowledge and
collective experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety, and economics of the
subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by industry leaders. As in the
past, only by participating in this conference will you be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will
not be published and no Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room stays inside the conference
room. We hope you will join us.

SUCCEEDING In A Changing Environment
As the industry shifts to deeper water, the environment in
which we work becomes more complex, hazardous and
expensive. Successful companies recognize early the
changing conditions and environmental challenges facing
the industry. At the Deepwater Operations Conference &
Exhibition in 2008, participants and attendees will discuss
how to succeed under these extreme conditions.
The seventh Deepwater Operations Conference & Exhibition
will be held on November 4 – 6, 2008 in Galveston, Texas

and will see a return to the luxurious Moody Gardens Hotel
and Conference Center.
Plan to attend, sponsor and exhibit at the 2008 conference
and exhibition as the technical focus shifts to “Succeeding
in a Changing Environment.” As with our past conferences,
proceedings will not be published and the press will not be
invited to assure conﬁdentiality between the attendees and
the speakers allowing the most up–to–date information to
be shared.

Russian leaders
act intoxicated
by oil revenue
If, as some say, America is addicted to
oil, Russia is stumbling drunk on the stuff.
Moscow’s bullying of Georgia is the
geopolitical equivalent of saloon behavior. And its leaders are saying things that
bespeak the grave need for a collective
blood test.
An example comes from Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, deputy chief of the Russian General
Staff. On Aug. 15 he told the Russian news

agency Interfax that nuclear attack would
be a legitimate response to Poland’s participation in a US-sponsored missile shield
against a potential nuclear threat from Iran.
More seemingly intoxicant blather
spewed from Vitaly Churkin, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Aug. 28 in
response to US criticism of Moscow’s recognition of independence for the Georgian
states of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
According to Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty, Churkin said: “I really liked the
statement of the US permanent representative, who was reminding to the members
of the Security Council that states must
refrain from the use of force or from the
threat of use of force. I would like to ask
the honorable representative of the United
States: Have you found weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq, or are you still looking
for them?”
Now Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin blames the US for his country’s Georgian adventure.
In an Aug. 28 interview with CNN,
Putin said the US encouraged Georgia to
attack South Ossetia to help a presidential
candidate.
“US citizens were indeed in the area
of conﬂict,” he said. “They were acting in
implementing those orders, doing as they
were ordered, and the only one who can
give such orders is their leader.”
The same day, Putin announced a ban
on imports of poultry products from 19
US companies for supposed violations of
health standards. International oil companies operating in Russia will recognize this
drill.
Feeding Russian bravado, of course, is
an economy heady from oil revenue but
resistant to diversiﬁcation and increasingly
repellent to outside capital.
The day after Moscow’s bender ends—
and it will—won’t feel good. Other countries must wonder how many Russian
bottles will break over innocent heads in
the meantime.

Gustav menaces Gulf Coast
On Aug. 29, just 3 years to the day after Hurricane Katrina came ashore in Louisiana and devastated New Orleans, Tropical Storm Gustav was over open waters of
the Caribbean and predicted to intensify into a hurricane and make landfall west of
that same city, possibly Labor Day, Sept. 1.
Although downgraded from a Category 1 hurricane by its passage over Haiti,
Gustav remained the most menacing storm and ﬁrst major threat to US offshore and
Gulf Coast reﬁning since 2005, pushing up energy prices Aug. 26-27 and reversing a
2-month downward trend. Yet the October natural gas contract led a drop in energy
prices Aug. 28 in New York as a bigger-than-expected injection of gas into US underground storage grabbed traders’ attention.
The Energy Information Administration reported injection of 102 bcf of gas into
US underground storage in the week ended Aug. 22. That put gas storage near 2.7
tcf, 200 bcf less than in the same period a year ago but 71 bcf above the 5-year
average. In New Orleans, analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC said, “Even with
Tropical Storm Gustav’s path likely targeting oil and gas infrastructure in the Gulf of
Mexico, not to mention the 2-3 other [pressure] systems that are forming behind it,
traders were unable to ignore such a large injection this late in the summer.”
With benchmark US crudes only $1/bbl higher Aug. 28 than the Aug. 22 close
on NYMEX, there had been “so far a very limited premium for Gustav,” said Olivier
Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland. “While the destructive potential of Gustav
cannot be ignored, the current state of demand destruction makes it more difﬁcult
than in previous years to adequately price a premium for that potential.”
He said, “In 2005 when Katrina hit the US Gulf, US reﬁneries were running at 97%
of capacity; today they are at 87%.” With US demand 1.6 million b/d lower than when
Katrina struck, the country is less exposed to the potential destructive impact of a
hurricane. “However, we must also recognize that volatility and speculative sensitivity is higher today than in 2005; hence we are not ready to ignore the price impact
that Gustav could have,” Jakob said.
Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London, predicted Gustav would be “fairly
critical” in “setting the tone of the market” through early September and “also plays
into the dynamics” of the scheduled Sept. 9 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Demand declines
Meanwhile, an EIA report Aug. 26 revised downward US oil demand, dropping
June demand by 793,000 b/d to 19.55 million b/d, “the lowest June reading since
1998 and [representing] a year-over-year decline of 1.17 million b/d (5.6%),” said
Horsnell.
Jakob said, “Gasoline sales in June were 4.4% lower than a year ago, and sales of
middle distillates were down an impressive 9.4%.” He said, “Looking at the demand
of main products (excluding LPG), not only is demand continuously lower than
previous years but has been dropping from April to June while it usually seasonally
does the opposite. The US might be dependent on foreign crude oil to run its reﬁneries, but the same reﬁneries have now turned fully dependent on exports to maintain
their operating margins.”
The Russian factor
Of “longer-term importance” than the potential impact of Gustav are that the
“changes in Russia’s external political relations has created barely a ripple [in world
markets] nor has the new fog around Caspian energy development or Russia’s external energy relations attracted much more than a glance,” Horsnell said. “Likewise,
some striking (or at least fog generating), fundamental data on both the supply and
demand side has emerged...without getting much more than minimal attention.”
In the week ended Aug. 29, China joined the US and other Western nations in
opposing Russia’s formal recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent
states, a move that would redraw the borders of Georgia. Horsnell said, “The recasting of relations between Russia and the US in recent weeks, and the question marks
put on the pace of Caspian development and its reliability following pipeline attacks
in Turkey and the Georgian conﬂict represent a set of issues that are likely to take
a while to fully play out. They are, however...signiﬁcant as drivers of the eventual
shape of the oil market. A signiﬁcant portion of consensus outlooks for non-OPEC
supply in coming years still rests on Russia and the Caspian. Indeed, those areas
have been central in many outlooks in the short run as well.”

It took us 125 years to use
the first trillion barrels of oil.
We’ll use the next trillion in 30.
So why should you care?

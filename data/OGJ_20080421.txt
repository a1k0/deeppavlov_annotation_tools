other unpredictable situations
that have damaged internals,
resulting in diluent losses and
high vacuum unit overhead condensable oil. Diluent is neither
cheap nor plentiful, and high

Canadian bitumen production
currently runs about 1 MMbpd,
with some being sold as Synbit
and Dilbit. Over the next 10-12
years output is expected to
increase to 3.5 MMbpd and more
refiners will begin investing to
process it and come to depend
on the Synbit and Dilbit for a
significant part of their supply.
Few today, however, have ever
processed these feeds at high
blend ratios, and are unaware
that conventional process and

feedstocks are extremely hard
to desalt, difficult to vaporize,
thermally unstable, corrosive, and
produce high di-olefin product
from the coker. If you intend to
lock into a long-term supply,
therefore, it is imperative that you
consider reliability and run length
from a particular design.
Too low tube velocity in the
vacuum heater tubes will lead to
precipitation of asphaltenes. Too
fast a flow rate will erode the
tube bends. If coil layout, burner
configuration and steam rate are
not correct, run length will be
measured in months, not years.

What all this means is that
special process and equipment
designs are needed to satisfy
the special demands of processing oil sands crudes. Such
processes are not generated by
computer based designers who
have little or no experience and
never leave the office. They are
developed only by engineers
with know-how who have real
experience wearing Nomex® suits
and measuring true unit performance in Northern Alberta.
Shouldn’t this be kept in mind
by those considering long term

involved in designing refinery units
to process difficult oil sands feedstocks, ask for Technical Papers

Alberta adjusts ‘New Royalty Framework’
The Alberta government, citing “unintended consequences” of
its “New Royalty Framework,” is easing terms for production from
deep oil and gas wells.
Energy Minister Mel Knight said the government introduced
two programs “to develop those oil and gas resources that are the
most costly to access but offer the greatest potential.”
As published last year, the New Royalty Framework will take
effect next year and raise royalty receipts by 20% above the level
projected under the previous regime in 2010 (OGJ, Nov. 5, 2007,
p. 34).
Producers and analysts have warned that the increase will discourage drilling, especially for natural gas (OGJ, Mar. 17, 2008,
p. 30). One of two new adjustments to the framework will offer
exploratory wells deeper than 2,000 m as much as $1 million or
12 months of royalty offsets for oil production, whichever occurs
first.
The other adjustment, for gas wells, applies to wells deeper than
2,500 m. Royalty relief will be applied on a sliding scale by depth,
up to $3,750/m.
In other changes, the province will apply four par prices instead
of two in calculations of oil royalties. Gas royalties will be calculated according to the sum of vertical drill depth and all laterals
in an effort to encourage development of coalbed methane with
lateral completions.

EU assured of Turkmen natural gas supplies
On a recent visit to Turkmenistan, European Union External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner received assurances
from Turkmenistan President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow that
10 billion cu m of natural gas would be available for EU members
every year, beginning in 2009, the commissioner’s spokeswoman
Christiane Hohlmann told OGJ.
Hohlmann said this was the first time the president has given “a
specific volume for these supplies, and such a ‘political assurance’
from one of the Central Asia’s gas producers was very important.”
The assurance of new gas supplies bolsters the EU’s efforts to
diversify its gas sources away from Russia’s dominant position for
reasons of both political security and safe supplies.
In a “Viewpoint” published in France’s economic daily La Tribune, Ferrero-Waldner said the commission is “working with oth-

er partners” to enhance its gas supply security.
Agreements have been confirmed with Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
and Ukraine. Besides Algeria in the south, “with whom we are negotiating a strategic partnership,” she said, agreements had been
finalized with Egypt, Morocco, and Jordan and when finalized with
Libya “would open up serious prospects” of supply reinforcements
from that country.
The commission, she said, is also studying new interconnections
with the Middle East and North Africa, and an energy partnership
is being discussed with Iraq. She said she would soon travel to Gulf
Cooperation Council countries (Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman,
Saudi Arabia, and the UAE) to deepen the partnership with them.

UK farmin wells require $2 billion by 2010
Operators will need to invest over $2 billion over the next few
years to develop 70 exploration prospects in the UK North Sea
under farmin agreements, according to a new report published by
consultancy Hannon Westwood LLP.
High rig rates have increased the level of investment, and the
report said that more than 180 wells are scheduled to be drilled by
2010. Over the past 6 months, operators have moved towards discovery appraisal drilling. The UKCS holds a total future production
potential of about 24 billion boe, including current production,
existing development projects and discoveries, and exploration potential.
Other details in the report were:
• 25 wells are to be fully funded through farmin agreements.
• 12 wells are to be partially funded through farmin agreements to date.
• 70 wells are estimated to be partially or fully available for
farm out by independent operators.
Chris Bulley, executive director at Hannon Westwood, said there
was “a 25% plus turnover in farmin opportunities since the November 2007 report.”
The UK government recently launched its 25th offshore licensing round with 2,297 blocks up for grabs.
Operators are seeking help for 35 of the farmin wells in the
central North Sea. This has fallen from 50 in mid-2006 and 83 in
late 2007. The southern North Sea has 18 farmin opportunities,
while the northern North Sea and west of Britain have 9 and 8
respectively. ✦

The Environmental Defense Center (EDC), Get Oil Out, and Citizens Planning Association of Santa Barbara negotiated the agreement.
The agreement remains subject to approval from regulators. The
Santa Barbara County Planning Commission was scheduled to consider the agreement at an Apr. 21 meeting in Santa Maria.
If county officials approve the agreement, then it will go before
the California Lands Commission, the California Coastal Commission, and the US Minerals Management Service.
Assuming all approvals are granted, Plains believes it could drill
a well in the fourth quarter, a company spokesman told OGJ.
Terms call for curtailing production of existing oil and gas operations off Lompoc and Gaviota coast. Plains also agreed to donate
land for parks.
EDC secured what it calls “an unprecedented agreement” from
an oil company for zero net greenhouse gas emissions from the
project. Plains agreed to contribute $1.5 million to a local fund for
the purchase of hybrid buses.
Linda Krop, EDC spokeswoman, said the agreement stipulates
that oil and gas development in both Tranquillon Ridge and Point
Pedernales fields end Dec. 31, 2022.
The agreement followed Plains’s proposal to expand its existing
production from Platform Irene in federal waters (see Fig. 2, OGJ,
Aug. 7, 2006, p. 20).
The proposed expansion would involve directional drilling
from Irene into Tranquillon Ridge field in state tidelands between
Plains’s existing federal lease and the shore. Irene is in 242 ft of
water 4.7 miles from land.
Santa Barbara County officials rejected a similar proposal in
2002 from Nuevo Energy Co. to develop Tranquillon Ridge field.
Environmental groups opposed Nuevo’s proposal.
To win the support of environmental groups, Plains offered to
shut existing and new development operations in phases, all to be
ended by or in 2022.This applies to the existing Point Pedernales
project, Lompoc onshore oil fields, and the Point Arguello project,
including platforms Hidalgo, Harvest, and Hermosa, and the Gaviota processing site.

Tofkat-1 awaits evaluation to determine its commerciality. Log
analysis confirmed an interval of 10 ft of gross pay and 6 ft of net
pay.
No oil-water contact was observed, and no production test was
attempted. Brooks Range Petroleum Corp., the operator, drilled
two sidetrack appraisal wells.
Tofkat-1 was suspended for possible re-entry as a future production well. The well is east of the Colville River (OGJ, Jan. 28,
2008, p. 42).
Partners are acquiring 210 sq miles of 3D seismic survey to be
analyzed by late 2008 in preparation for an appraisal drilling program in the 2009 winter drilling season.
The 3D seismic will also be used to evaluate uphole potential in
the Brookian formations.
Joint venture partners are Brooks Range Petroleum, TG World
Energy Inc., Bow Valley Alaska Corp., and Ramshorn Investments
Inc.

Apache lets contract for Devil Creek development

Apache Energy in Perth awarded the $260 million (Aus.) Devil Creek Development Project to Perth-based engineering firm
Clough Ltd.
The work involves establishment of a shore plant to process gas
from Apache’s Reindeer gas field off Western Australia. Devil Creek
is 65 km southwest of Karratha in the Pilbara region.
Clough will provide engineering, procurement, and construction for onshore facilities that will include gas processing trains,
compressors, and accommodation facilities.
The plant will treat and dehydrate the gas, stabilize condensate
content, provide storage and road load-out facilities for the liquids
as well as gas compression and metering. The site will be connected
by a short pipeline to the main natural gas trunkline from Dampier
to Bunbury.
Apache said Devil Creek will be built for a capacity of 300 terajoules/day of gas. Phase 1 of the project will source gas from Reindeer at about 110 terajoules/day. The gas will be used for domestic
supply in Western Australia.
Phase 2 expansion will come with the sanction of the Julimar

StatoilHydro drills long horizontal Gulltopp well
StatoilHydro drilled and completed the 9,910 m-long horizontal Gulltopp well from the Gullfaks-A platform, in 439 ft of water.
Drilling began in April 2005. Gulltopp began producing this
month from the shallow Brent reservoir at 2,430 m subsea. Platform rig contractor Seawell Ltd. drilled most of the wellpath at an
inclination of 7º. In order to counteract the friction, Seawell filled
the 8-km casing with air, instead of drilling mud, and “floated” the
casing in the nearly horizontal well. “This was the key to success,”
said StatoilHydro.
The company had to upgrade the brake system on the drilling

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

rig and the power supply for the platform in order to complete
the well. StatoilHydro initially estimated the cost of drilling the
extended reach well at $43.9 million, about 25% of the cost it estimated necessary to develop Gulltopp using a subsea template and
dedicated multiphase flowlines (OGJ, Feb. 9, 2004, Newsletter).
StatoilHydro said in an Apr. 14 press release that the well was
“considerably more expensive than initially assumed.”
Gulltopp is in the Tampen area of the northern Norwegian
North Sea, 5 km north of Gullfaks satellite fields Gullveig and Rimfaks. It’s operated by majority owner StatoilHydro 70%, on behalf
of license partner Petoro AS 30%.

Petrofac gets Syrian contracts worth $1 billion

Petrobras inks contract for Gulf of Mexico FPSO

Oil and gas facilities service provider Petrofac announced two
major gas field development contracts with Syria worth a total $1
billion.
The first contract, worth $454 million, calls for construction
of a plant to treat 4 million cu m/day of gas from Jihar field near
Palmyra. The field is operated by Hayan Petroleum, which is a joint
venture of Croatia’s INA-Naftaplin and Syrian Petroleum Co. The
plant is scheduled for completion in 2011.
Petrofac’s scope of work includes engineering, design, and construction of gas processing facilities, an LPG recovery system, LPG
storage and loading facility, gas gathering and collection systems,
satellite gathering station, well sites, flow lines, utilities and offsite
facilities, gathering pipelines, and living quarters.
The second contract, worth $477 million, was awarded by
Petro-Canada for the processing of gas and liquids from the AlShaer and Cherrife fields in central Syria, which are expected to
produce some 2.5 million cu m/day of sales gas and 150 tonnes/
day of LPG from 2010. Sales gas and condensate will be fed into
the Syrian pipeline grid, and LPG will be transported via tankers.
Petrofac’s work scope includes engineering, design, and construction of a gas treatment plant, pipelines, gas gathering station
flow lines, and well sites.

Petrobras America Inc. signed a certified verification agent
(CVA) contract with Det Norske Veritas (DNV) to ensure that the
Gulf of Mexico’s first floating production, storage, and offloading
vessel meets US regulations.
The FPSO is expected to be installed in deepwater Chinook and
Cascade fields in early 2010 with production scheduled to start
during first-quarter 2010. The FPSO will have a storage capacity
of 600,000 bbl of oil, a processing capacity of 80,000 b/d of oil,
and natural gas export facilities of 16 MMscfd (OGJ, Jan. 14, 2008,
Newsletter). Petrobras will build a pipeline to transport the gas to
shore.
The FPSO will be installed in 2,600 m of water, which DNV said
is among the deepest waters in which an FPSO has been installed.
Both Chinook and Cascade fields are on Block 425 of the Walter
Ridge area.
As the CVA, DNV will ensure that the project complies with US
Minerals Management Services requirements. DNV is an independent foundation offering technology expertise to help safeguard
life, property, and the environment.
Petrobras last fall hired BW Offshore Ltd. to convert, install, and
operate the FPSO. The project also includes delivery and installation
of a disconnectable submerged turret production buoy, including
fluid swivel and an appurtenant mooring system to be supplied by
BW Offshore’s subsidiary Advanced Production and Loading AS. In
the event of a hurricane, the turret and swivel will enable the FPSO
to disconnect from its moorings and seek sheltered waters with
minimum disruption to operations.
Technip was selected to provide engineering, procurement, construction, and installation of subsea facilities to develop the fields
(OGJ, Jan. 28, 2008, Newsletter). Its Deep Blue and Constructor
vessels will install five free-standing offshore hybrid riser systems
for both fields along with infield flowlines and the gas export pipeline to shore. Work includes welding and installation of about 120
km of 6-in. and 9-in. steel pipelines, design and fabrication of 10
pipeline end termination, and 2 inline tees.
Petrobras is the fields’ operator with 50% of Cascade and
66.67% of Chinook. Devon Energy Corp. owns the remaining 50%
of Cascade, and Total E&P USA Inc. owns 33.33% of Chinook. ✦

Iraq confers with majors to boost oil production
The Iraqi ministry of oil said it is in discussions with BP PLC,
Chevron Corp., ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, and Total
SA to increase production at several oil fields in the country.
Chevron and Total confirmed that their discussions were aimed
at finalizing a 2-year technical support agreement to boost production at the West Qurna Stage 1 oil field near Basra. West Qurna has
reserves estimated at 15-21 billion bbl.
The oil ministry intends to add 100,000 b/d to the field’s current capacity of 180,000 b/d. Prior to the outbreak of war in Iraq
in 2003, West Qurna had an estimated production capacity of
250,000 b/d. In December, Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, and Chevron
submitted technical and financial proposals to develop five fields in
southern and northern Iraq.
In addition to West Qurna, other areas include Rumaila and
Zubair fields near Basra, Kirkuk oil field in the north, and Akkas
natural gas field in the west.

UK launches 2.5% biofuels transport requirement
Environmentalists and charities have criticized the UK government’s requirement that all fuels must have 2.5% of biofuels,
claiming the measure is raising food prices and damaging the environment through land conversion and increased usage of chemical
fertilizers.
The new policy became effective Apr. 15 under the government’s Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO) to ensure
that it meets European Union regulations. By 2010 the share will
reach 5% and is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by
2.5 million tonnes.
A spokesperson for the Environmental Transport Association
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
said: “This initiative may be well intentioned, but it is highly
flawed. Loopholes allow subsidized fuel from unsustainable sources to be certified. Companies are entitled to answer ‘unknown’ to
the question of what the previous land use was and still be eligible
for [an RTFO] certificate.”
The Department for Transport will publish a report in June reviewing the use of biofuels, after which ministers may postpone or
drop plans to increase the amount of biofuel in petrol and diesel
to 10% by 2020.
Oxfam International warned that millions of indigenous people
in Asia, Africa, and South America would lose their homes as land
is cleared to build biofuel plantations such as palm oil.

But Jeremy Woods, leader of the biofuels working group at the
Royal Society, said the RTFO could succeed if it promotes the best
biofuels. This would be achieved by changing the RTFO to support
the fuels with the lowest emissions by including a greenhouse reduction target.
“The RTFO helps send a message to industry that it is worth
their while to significantly invest in improving existing biofuels
and accelerate the development of new ones,” he commented.
Soaring food prices have led India to curb rice exports, and
higher fuel prices have also seen uprisings in Indonesia and Ivory
Coast among other places. According to Oxfam, about 30% of recent food price inflation is due to biofuel production.
A survey commissioned by Friends of the Earth found that 9
out of 10 people did not know that their vehicles would now use
renewable fuels.

Nippon Oil to shutter Toyama reﬁnery
Nippon Oil Corp., Japan’s largest refiner, will shutter its smallest refinery, the 60,000 b/d Toyama facility operated by subsidiary
Nihonkai Oil Co. Ltd., according to press reports. The facility will
be converted to a site for importing oil products from other Nippon refineries in Japan.
When the 40-year-old refinery on Japan’s west coast is shut
down by the end of March 2009, it will become the first Japanese
refinery to be mothballed since 2003. The reasons for its closure
include high costs, overcapacity, and diminished demand in the
world’s third-largest oil-consuming nation.
Closure was first considered last year because the refinery cannot process heavier grades of crude. The subsequent spike in crude
prices has since reduced its profitability even more. ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

TransCanada hoping to work with ANS producers TransCanada’s project to the legislature. “We expect to receive the
TransCanada Corp. said it will seek alignment with Alaska North
Slope natural gas producers to build an Alaska natural gas pipeline,
adding that it is unclear how a proposed joint pipeline by ConocoPhillips and BP PLC fits into requirements outlined by the state
of Alaska.
TransCanada said it was “encouraged that two of the three producers are ready to advance the project and get Alaskan gas to markets in the Lower 48 states.” ExxonMobil Corp. is the other ANS
producer.
ConocoPhillips and BP announced Apr. 8 plans to build a 4 bcfd
gas pipeline called Denali that would extend from ANS to Canada
and potentially on to the US (OGJ, Apr. 14, 2008, p. 30).
BP and ConocoPhillips called the proposed Alaskan gas line the
“largest private-sector construction project ever built in North
America.” They plan to spend $600 million over the next 36
months on an open season, which is slated to begin before yearend 2010.
TransCanada spokeswoman Cecily Dobson told OGJ Apr. 10 that
TransCanada has sought for several years and continues to seek
alignment with the three ANS gas producers and the state of Alaska.
“We continue to believe that the alignment of these five parties is
the best and fastest way to get the project completed,” Dobson said.
“If alignment with producers does not occur, this could turn out to
be a competitive environment.”
The TransCanada project is the only proposal sanctioned by
Alaska’s state government. TransCanada retains Canadian rights to
an Alaska pipeline from approvals granted 30 years ago when the
line was first proposed.
Alaska earlier this year adopted the Alaska Gasline Inducement
Act (AGIA), legislation designed to advance construction of a gas
pipeline from ANS. It requires a pipeline project builder to meet
certain requirements that will advance the project, in exchange for
a license that provides up to $500 million in matching funds.
These funds would help reduce the financial risks that such a
huge project faces in its early stages.
Dobson said TransCanada is at stage two of the process and
awaits Gov. Sarah Palin’s decision whether or not to recommend

decision the week of May 19,” Dobson said. “If recommended, our
application would go to the legislature for approval. At this point,
it’s unclear on where [the] BP and ConocoPhillips proposal fits.”

TransCanada gauges Pathﬁnder Pipeline support
TransCanada Corp. started a binding open season process to
gauge support for a proposed pipeline that would move natural
gas from US Rocky Mountains basins to Midwest markets.
The proposed 500-mile, 42-in. Pathfinder Pipeline will extend
northeastward from Wamsutter, Wyo., through Montana and North
Dakota to the Northern Border Pipeline Co. “at a location commercially attractive for delivery into the Ventura and Chicago area
markets,” officials said. Initial capacity is to be 1.2 bcfd, with an
ultimate capacity of 2 bcfd. The project includes an option to build
a 140-mile supply zone spur connecting Meeker, Colo., to Wamsutter. It is anticipated to be in service in late 2010.
To meet further growth in Rockies gas supply, TransCanada
proposes later to extend Pathfinder 275 miles from the Northern
Border Pipeline to Noyes, Minn., and Emerson, Man., where gas
can be shipped to eastern markets or storage facilities using the
Great Lakes Gas Transmission system and TransCanada’s Canadian
Mainline system.
“TransCanada is evaluating different options to move an increasing supply of natural gas from the Rocky Mountains,” says
Hal Kvisle, president and chief executive.
TransCanada will accept through May 22 binding bids for firm
gas transportation capacity from Meeker and from Wamsutter to
Northern Border Pipeline. TransCanada also is seeking nonbinding
expressions of interests for the future extension of the pipeline to
Minnesota and Manitoba.
A segment of the proposed line follows the same route as the
proposed Bison Pipeline project. TransCanada is a partial owner in
the Bison project through its interest in TC PipeLines LP. The two
projects are coordinating preliminary field activities as they develop commercial support. Final design and location of Pathfinder
will reflect the commercial support obtained, input of stakeholders, and the federal regulatory process. ✦

Managing a skills shortage

Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
For professional workers considering
transfer into the oil and gas industry,
conditions cannot be better.
An acute skills shortage is increasing
operating costs and delaying project development. The slump of the oil and gas
business and related job cuts in the late
1980s and early 1990s steered students
away from petroleum disciplines. The
industry now faces recruiting problems
as its workload climbs and its workforce
ages.
In the US, the number of enrolling
undergraduate petroleum engineers
hovered at 3,057 in 2007. Countries like
China and the former Soviet Union continue to produce petroleum engineers,
but importing talent from these countries creates cultural and linguistic issues.
The Global Talent Index by executive
search firm Heidrick & Struggles warns
that the US status as the world’s biggest
talent hotspot is under threat from the
UK and China.
“Overall, the survey confirms that
talent follows where money leads,” the
firm said. “After the US and UK, the
next best countries for attracting and
developing talent are relatively small but
open economies of Canada, the Netherlands, and Sweden.”

Big questions
According to the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the average age of the
group’s members worldwide is 47. The
big questions are: Where will replacements come from? How can they be

attracted and retained?
Rhys Jones, commercial director
at headhunters Elliot Marsh Ltd., told
OGJ that operators are conscious that
their people are integral to success,
particularly as the market has become
so competitive. “They need to be more
imaginative in their packages.”
But finding new mid-level to senior
managerial and technical staff was described by one headhunter as “absolute
chaos.” Finding and hiring staff can take
months. “The demands are very high,
and this varies depending on where
you are and where you are going to.
Salaries are jumping as an engineer
can get £600/day for a job in Russia. If
something goes wrong, he leaves to go
to the next highest bidder, and turnover
is high.”
Brian Martin, founder of industry
specialist search firm Opus Executive Partners, says oil companies must
recruit talent from other industries such
as aerospace, automotive, and utility to
relieve the crisis.
“Professionals do exist, and you can
mentor and technically train them to
help their understanding,” Martin says.
“Historically, the industry feels its skills
are unique and can be easily exported
but not imported; this is no longer the
case. Some technologies are genuinely
proprietary to the industry. However,
these are often developed in conjunction with external universities, further
confirming that all kinds of intellect can
and [are] being used by the industry.”
Over the last 24 months, salaries for
senior management and board appointments have risen by as much as 100%,
according to Opus. Some companies
recruiting new talent are shocked by the
minimum salaries they are expected to
pay before other benefits, such as pension plans, bonuses, stock options, and
expenses are factored in.

According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, engagement
metrics and measures for employers are
important. In some cases, investors are
using employee engagement levels to
gauge a company’s financial health and
sustainability.
Research by PwC also shows that
companies are willing to pay expatriate
engineers from developing countries
more than what they might expect from
their country of origin by giving them
a designated country rate. The disadvantage to employees is that they are
denied pensions, share plans, mobility
allowances, and other benefits so they
can be moved on short notice. Some
therefore may be cash-rich but lifestylepoor—a trend not sustainable in the
long term if employees are to be fully
engaged.
According to Jones, one independent
operator uses a points-based benefits
system in which employees can create
their own packages. “Each year, the
employee will tick what they want to
suit them at that stage: more holidays,
higher pension contributions, gym
membership, share options etc.”

Phantom shares
Some public oil companies are
experimentally offering phantom share
options, in which an employee can
receive cash equivalent to an increase in
the value of a block of stock. Employees
don’t actually own the stock and can’t
exercise phantom options immediately.
To date there has been no requirement
to disclose such schemes in annual
reports where senior management normally share extra earnings from stock
options.
Oil companies are hungry for new
technical employees, but can these
trends of record salaries and slick benefits be sustainable in the long term? ✦

Attention to future supply
Reports of major oil discoveries get quick attention from the general media these days, even
when the discoveries aren’t really news or, for
that matter, discoveries. While the attention can
be misleading, it shows welcome recognition that
new quantities of hydrocarbons are important,
especially when large. Yet some governments miss
the message.
Remarks by a Brazilian official last week
showed how eager the world seems to be for word
of the next proverbial elephant. Haroldo Lima,
general director of the National Oil, Natural Gas,
and Biofuels Agency, told reporters Petrobras may
have found “reserves” of 33 billion bbl in deep
water off Rio de Janeiro. The price of Petrobras
stock jumped. At least one analyst said the report
disproved “peak-oil” pessimism.

‘Reserves’ premature
Trouble is, the discovery wasn’t exactly news,
and discussion of “reserves” is premature. Petrobras issued a clarification pointing out that its
report of the discovery, in the Carioca area of the
Santos basin, asserted the need for further assessment. It made that report last September (OGJ,
Oct. 1, 2007, Newsletter). Only one well has been
spudded since the discovery, and it hasn’t reached
target depth.
Without question, Petrobras and its partners
have something important under way around Carioca and the earlier Tupi discovery nearby (OGJ,
Nov. 20, 2006, p. 43). But it’s too soon to suggest
that this one area has reserves almost as large as all
of Nigeria’s.
In the ambiguous realm of oil and gas reserves,
confusion is understandable. The industry that
finds and produces fluid hydrocarbons, after all,
has yet to agree even on a definition of the term.
Enthusiastic officials and news reporters can be
forgiven their occasional mishandling of the numbers.
It’s the enthusiasm on display that’s important
here. Until recently, growth in volumes of recoverable oil, no matter how large, seldom made news
outside the regional and trade press. Yet when
the US Geological Survey raised its estimate of
technically recoverable oil and gas in an expansive
formation of the Williston basin this month, the

headline “Billions of Barrels of Oil May Lie Under
Northern Plains” showed up in, of all places, the
New York Times.
The headline writer did justice to uncertainty.
USGS assessed the undiscovered part of a specific
resource, not reserves. Someone still must find the
3.7 billion bbl of crude oil, 1.85 tcf of natural gas,
and 148 million bbl of gas liquids that USGS said
might be technically recoverable from the Devonian-Mississippian Bakken shale in Montana and
North Dakota. Quantities don’t become reserves
until the hydrocarbons are not only discovered but
also determined to be technically and economically recoverable. Even then, they remain estimates.
The USGS assessment thus speaks probabilistically to the size of an exploratory target rather
than to volumes relevant to immediate oil and gas
supply. To supply years and decades from now,
however, the assessment is crucial. The numbers
are large. And the 25-fold increase they represent
over a 1995 assessment of the Bakken shale testifies to the power of technology. The USGS report
was indeed newsworthy, even if it had nothing to
do with the general media’s usual obsession: the
price of gasoline.
Can it be that public attention has finally found
its way to the connection between today’s work
and tomorrow’s energy supply (and, therefore,
price of gasoline)? If so, news organizations would
perform a service by brushing the dust off estimates published by the US Minerals Management
Service in November 2006 and promptly forgotten. The estimates are of technically recoverable
resources in federal land inaccessible to oil and gas
operators: 10.8 billion bbl of oil and 50.1 tcf of
gas.

Potential supply
Those values equate to half of US oil reserves
and a quarter of US gas reserves. They represent
potential future energy supply, domestic and
therefore secure, that the US deliberately shuns.
They also represent possible income that the US
denies Americans and receipts it denies governments.
Official foreclosure of these benefits, especially
in the face of a faltering economy, deserves the attention of a vigorous press. It is, in fact, a scandal. ✦

The accumulation of large oil
revenues, particularly since the early
2000s, has placed oil exporting countries among the world’s largest sources
of capital. The bulk of these assets are
invested by government-owned and
government-managed oil funds, which
constitute a large component of broader
sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). A
recent Morgan Stanley study estimates
that by 2015 the financial assets of oil
funds and other SWFs will be about $6
trillion each.1
McKinsey Global Institute estimates
that at the end of 2006, oil exporters
collectively owned $3.4-3.8 trillion in
foreign financial assets.

In addition to older funds such
as Kuwait’s Future Generations Fund
(1976), the UAE’s Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (1976), and Norway’s

and Venezuela’s

Fund (2005).
The general justification
for these funds is that “some share of
government revenues derived from the
exploitation of a nonrenewable resource
should be put aside for when these
revenues decline” either from price
fluctuations or resources depletion.4
Thus oil funds generally are classified

Oil funds: threat
or opportunity?

18

into two categories:
• Stabilization funds. These are designed
to reduce the impact of volatile revenue
on the government and the economy.
When oil prices are high, the fund
receives resources, and when prices are
low, the fund pays out to the budget.
Stabilization funds are also meant
to protect the economy from the socalled “Dutch disease.” This term refers
to Holland’s experience in the 1970s,
when a strengthening currency made
it impossible for local manufacturers to
compete. A flood of petrodollars may
push up the value of the currency and
undermine manufacturing competitiveness.
• Savings funds. These are designed to
expand the benefits of oil wealth to the
upcoming generations. The presumption is that oil revenues belong to all
citizens of the exporting country, both
current and future generations. Saving
and investing a proportion of oil revenues would allow future generations
to share oil wealth with the current one.
In most cases oil funds seek to
achieve both stabilization and saving
simultaneously.

Transparency concerns
In recent years, oil funds have injected billions of dollars into some of
the world’s biggest investment banks.
Their high-profile activities include
Abu Dhabi’s acquisition of a stake in
Citigroup and Kuwait’s capital injection
into Merrill Lynch. These investments
are supposed to help stabilize financial
markets.
In theory, international investment is
welcome. However, when the source of
the investment is a foreign governmentowned fund, suspicions can arise. There
are concerns that oil funds’ investments
might be driven more by political and
strategic interests than solely by commercial benefits.
The huge and growing size of oil
funds, the general lack of comprehensive investment strategies, and the low
levels of transparency and accountability have further heightened these
concerns.

Persian Gulf oil funds
In 2006 the Persian Gulf region
held 61.1% of the world’s proved oil reserves. Its share of global oil production
was 30.1%, while its share of consumption was only 5.4%. The large gap
between production and consumption
and the massive proved reserves underscore the region’s current and future oil
revenues potential.
In the first half of this decade an
estimated $542 billion of GCC international assets had been injected into
global capital markets, mostly through
investments by oil funds.5

Kuwait
Kuwait was one of the first countries
in the world to set up an oil fund. In
1953, some 8 years before its independence from the UK, Kuwait founded an
Investment Board Fund (IBF) in London
to invest its surplus oil revenue.6
Shortly after oil discovery, the role
of the state as the provider of basic
services such as education and health
care considerably expanded to meet the
needs of a rapidly growing population.
In an effort to organize public finance,
the General Reserve Fund (GRF) was established in 1960 as the main treasurer
for the government. The GRF received
all revenues, including all oil revenues,
from which all the state’s budgetary
expenditures were paid.7
In 1976 Crown Prince Jaber alAhmed al-Jaber al-Sabah, the deputy
emir of Kuwait, issued Law No.106, under which the Future Generation Fund
(FGF) was established. Article 2 stated,
“A special account shall be opened for
creating a reserve which would be a
substitute to the oil wealth. An amount
of 50% of the available state’s general
fund is to be added to this account.” Article 1 stated, “An amount of 10% shall
be allocated from the state’s general
revenues every year.”8
In 1982 the government established
the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA)
to manage the growing increase in oil
revenues it allocated for investment. KIA
assumed responsibility for managing

In 2005 the SPF was renamed the
Government Pension Fund (GPF). It was
set up to manage Norway’s petroleum
wealth in a sustainable manner and to
meet many of its rising pension and
health expenditures. In 2008 the fund is
valued at more than $350 billion.28
The ministry of finance delegated
operational management of the fund to
Norges Bank, a unit of the Norwegian
Central Bank. A management agreement,
which further defines the relationship
between the ministry of finance as
delegating authority and Norges Bank
as operational manager, also has been
drawn up.29

Russian Federation fund
Since the late 1990s Russia has
emerged as one of the world’s primary
energy suppliers. Currently Russia is the
world’s largest natural gas producer and
exporter and the world’s second largest
oil producer and exporter after Saudi
Arabia. The prominent, growing role of
the energy sector in Russia’s economy
raises concern about the most effective
way to utilize the massive oil revenues
that have accumulated since the early
2000s.
Addressing these concerns, the Russian government established a Stabilization Fund (SF) in 2004.
Three important developments laid
the groundwork for the SF’s creation:
• Although the state sold several
major oil companies to oligarchs under
Boris Yeltsin’s administration, in Vladimir Putin’s administration, the main
emphasis was on restoring state power
and ownership in energy assets—the
so-called renationalization or deprivatization.
• The more-assertive Putin administration enjoyed substantial oil revenues
due to soaring and sustained oil prices.
• Several Russian economists voiced
concern that the deepening dependence on energy wealth is transforming
the country into a mere raw material
provider for the rest of the world and
is hurting the competitiveness of other
economic industries, particularly manufacturing, raising the threat of Dutch
disease.
Following lengthy debates, the law
establishing the SF was approved in
December 2003 to resolve the challenge
of how to manage the expanding pool
of oil revenues.33 Several sources contribute to the fund’s revenues: a portion
of the export duty on oil and petroleum
products, part of the revenues from the
severance tax on mineral resources, and
a portion of the federal budget surplus
at the beginning of the fiscal year. The
law also set the base price at $20/bbl
for Urals oil, above which revenues
start accumulating in the SF. The fund
is managed by the ministry of finance.

In 2008, the SF’s assets are about $157
billion.34

already have mechanisms to regulate
foreign investments and prevent abuse
by investors.
Anxieties are based less on actions
than on suspicion amid such secrecy.
Unlike Norway and a few other oil
exporters, most oil funds continue to
exhibit a low level of transparency and
accountability. Despite this secrecy, no
credible evidence exists that oil funds
have pursued political or strategic gains.
Excessive regulations and a broad
politicized hostility to oil funds would
come at a high price—further deepening mistrust among oil exporters and
Western markets. Instead, confidencebuilding measures and a free flow of
capital, trade, and technology would
benefit both sides and the overall global
financial markets. ✦

Consumer responses
Most consumers in 16 Midcontinent
states are responding to higher motor
fuel prices by driving less, according to
Vincent F. Orza, dean of the Meinders
School of Business at Oklahoma City
University. The school’s regular regional
consumer sentiment survey also found
in March that they were less inclined
to buy durable household goods, while
more believed their financial situation
is worse than a year ago, he told an Apr.
9 hearing of the House Small Business
Committee’s Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee.
“At $3/gal, consumer discretionary
income declines enough to impact the
frequency of eating at quick service and
casual theme restaurants, which alone
are reported to have lost more than 10%
of their customers. Soft good purchases
at chain stores (many operating as small
business franchises) and thousands of
independent merchants are down along
with ticket sales at movie theaters. This
is a consequence of higher [gasoline]
prices reducing the number of discretionary dollars,” Orza explained.
Both major and independent retailers
are closing outlets as a result, he continued. “Liz Claiborne is shuttering 54
Sigrid Olsen stores. Ann Taylor is closing
117 of its 921 stores. Talbot’s has closed
all of its men’s and children’s clothing
stores along with 22 women’s stores.
Even Target and Starbucks are seeing
a slowdown. Each of these chains are
served by countless small businesses
that provide window washing and
custodial services, paper products,
deliveries, alterations and many other
services,” he said.

Trouble lurks
in climate bill

A

climate change bill that could
reach the US Senate floor in June
is already generating its own heat.
Critics of S. 2191, which Sens. Joseph
I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) and John W.
Warner (R-Va.) introduced last year,
warn that its provisions could lead
to serious problems because it was
pushed quickly through the Environment and Public Works Committee.
“It was not written until late October and was then rushed through
the legislative process, when the oil
and gas industry was included. The
majority did not provide a summary of changes. Each time a new
hearing was held, you had to read
all 300 pages of the bill to find out
what words had been changed,” one
insider told me.
Industry groups have been concerned about impacts of the bill’s
carbon cap-and-trade program. Some
are worried that a provision involving
natural gas carbon collection points
could reduce domestic production.
“This has eclipsed all our other
issues. If Congress makes the wrong
choice for climate change and natural
gas, the impacts could be devastating not only for our sector but for
the general economy,” said William F.
Whitsitt, president of the American
Exploration & Production Council.

gas processing level.
Producers would need to spend
billions of dollars already to buy
carbon allowances, Whitsitt said. The
amount could jump if processors
build additional cap-and-trade costs
into their rates, which would bite
into producers’ budgets, he told me.
Since most of its members are
utilities, AGA’s main concern is that
the provision will increase costs for
commercial and residential customers who already have made major
progress in using gas more efficiently,
Wilkinson said.

AGA proposal

AGA has proposed moving
carbon-allowance collections back to
their original point and not involving
residential and commercial customers
before 2020. At that time, the Environmental Protection Agency would
analyze availability of other technologies and further efficiency gains by
residential and commercial customers. “This also would solve upstream
entities’ problems with the point of
regulation,” Wilkinson noted.
“Increasingly, the senators and
staff people we explain this problem
to say this wasn’t their intent,” said
Whitsitt. “So the question is whether
they have the political will to do a
90º, if not 180º, turn now that this

holds reported in March that their
financial situation had grown worse
than at any time since 1991, and more
consumers cited high fuel and food
prices as the main cause of their financial distress than at any time since 1982.
“Unlike the more widely shared
experiences of a quarter century ago,
lower income households have reported
financial distress due to high fuel and
food prices twice as frequently as upper
income households,” said Richard T.
Curtin, who directs the monthly survey.
Orza told the House subcommittee that there is no short-term or easy
solution to high gasoline prices. More
exploration and refinery capacity
would help, but government regulations and prohibitions make both more
difficult, he said. “There is one quick
fix that would benefit consumers and
small business owners,” he continued.
“Congress could reduce federal fuel
taxes, which would have an immediate positive impact of about 50¢/gal
and would be quicker and easier than
mailing rebate checks to 700 million
households.” ✦

US Senate adds
renewable energy tax
credit to housing bill
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Senate approved an extension of renewable and alternative energy financial incentives as an amendment to a housing bill, HR 3221, by
88 to 8 votes on Apr. 10. The provision
contains language identical to a bill
that Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.)
and John Ensign (R-Nev.) introduced
earlier that week.
The provision differs from one in HR
5351, which the House approved on
Feb. 27, because it would not be paid
for by denying $18 billion of tax relief
to major oil companies.

McCain calls for suspension of federal gasoline tax
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the
presumed 2008 Republican presidential
nominee, called for a suspension of
federal gasoline taxes from Memorial Day to Labor Day as an economic
improvement measure.
“The effect will be an immediate
economic stimulus, taking a few dollars
off the price of a tank of gas every time
a family, a farmer, or a trucker stops to
ﬁll up,” he said in remarks scheduled
for delivery Apr. 15 as part of a larger
economic address at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh.
Suspending federal excise taxes
would reduce retail gasoline prices
by 18.4¢/gal and diesel fuel prices by
24.4¢/gal, according to the US Energy
Information Administration.
The federal government should also
suspend crude oil purchases for the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve during
that same period, he continued. “This
measure, combined with the summerlong gas tax holiday, will bring a timely
reduction in the price of gasoline. And
because the cost of gas affects the
price of food, packaging, and just about
everything else, these immediate steps
will help to spread relief across the
American economy,” McCain said.
But an environmental lobby-

three major presidential candidates
now support the bill introduced Feb. 5
by Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND) that
would suspend SPR purchases for the
rest of this year, or until oil prices fell to
$50/bbl or below.
Dorgan said Sens. Hillary R. Clinton
(D-NY) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.),
the two remaining major Democratic
presidential candidates, expressed their
support with other Senate Democratic
Caucus members on Mar. 11 in a letter to Bush. McCain’s backing “could
encourage additional bipartisan support
30

Following McCain’s proposal, two
leading Democrats on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
said suspending federal gasoline taxes
this summer would do little good but
cause signiﬁcant harm.
The proposal would save most drivers less than $30 for the entire season
while costing states $12 billion in
highway construction, highway safety,
and public transit funding, Chairman
James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.) and Peter
A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the
committee’s Highways and Transit Subcommittee.
“This shortfall will have very real,

devastating effects for hundreds of
thousands of American families. McCain’s proposal will eliminate approximately 300,000 family-wage, highway
construction-related jobs. It comes at a
time when, according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, 1.2 million construction workers are already unemployed.
In fact, the construction sector has the
highest unemployment rate (12%) of
any industrial sector,” they said in a
joint statement issued by the committee.
Suspending the taxes of 18.4¢/gal
on gasoline and 24.4¢/gal on diesel
fuel from Memorial Day to Labor Day,
as McCain proposed, also would harm
efforts to reduce highway congestion
by eliminating necessary infrastructure
improvement investments, Oberstar
and DeFazio said.
“Despite its stated purpose, the
proposal would actually do little for
consumers. Instead, it is likely to turn
into just another multibillion windfall
proﬁt for the oil companies,” they said.
This essentially happened in 2001,
when Illinois and Indiana suspended
their motor fuel sales taxes, they said.
“The McCain proposal is nothing
more than an attempt to ﬁnd a simple
sound bit instead of a realistic solution,” Oberstar and DeFazio maintained.
“It brings to mind the words of H.L.
Mencken: ‘There is always an easy solution to every human problem—neat,
plausible, and wrong.’”

for my legislation,” Dorgan said.
“All three presidential candidates
now oppose the Bush administration
program of putting nearly 70,000 bbl
of oil underground every day,” Dorgan
said, adding, “The current policy puts
upward pressure on [gasoline] prices
and is not in the nation’s interest. With
oil prices at record highs and the SPR
nearly full, it makes no sense.”
McCain’s announcement came a day
after House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel (D-Ill.) and two
other House Democrats joined their

Senate colleagues as they urged Bush to
suspend SPR purchases when oil prices
hit a record high.
“Today, oil and [gasoline] prices
each hit record levels. The price of oil
traded above $112[/bbl] on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and the price
of gas has now risen to a nationwide
average above $3.34/gal,” Emanuel
said in an Apr. 9 letter, which also was
signed by Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.),
chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global
Warming, and Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.).

ing group said that the proposal to
suspend motor fuel taxes raises more
questions than answers. McCain’s plan
would cut $11 billion in highway funding that is critically needed, the League
of Conservation Voters said.
“If Sen. McCain wants to save
money for American taxpayers, he
should get to the root of the problem:
massive taxpayer-funded subsidies to
huge oil companies that are already
making tens of billions of dollars each
year. The answer to the high cost of gas
is not temporary tax maneuvering; it is
a fundamental shift away from oil and
towards clean, renewable energy,” LCV
President Gene Karpinski said.

this year, Freeport LNG Development
(FLNG) will have nominal sendout
capacity of 1.5 bcfd with peak capacity
of 1.75 bcfd.
Unlike the four existing US land
terminals—at Everett, Mass.; Cove Point,
Md.; Elba Island, Ga.; and Lake Charles,
La.—that use submerged-combustion vaporization, FLNG employs an
ambient-air system designed to draw
heat from the air to regasify LNG. The
process employs towers that consist
of seven vaporizers with one installed
spare employing vertical shell-and-tube
exchangers of 250 MMcfd each.
The technology, says FLNG, allows the plant to operate within the
Houston-Galveston nonattainment
area because the towers emit no NOx.
During cooler weather, FLNG converts
its vaporization process to heaters
similar to those used at other LNG
terminals.
Phase 1 has installed two, 160,000-cu
m LNG storage tanks (3 bcf of gas
equivalent in each tank) and an LNG
carrier berth that can accommodate the
largest carrier envisioned, according to
the company. Phase 2, if decided upon,
would add a third 160,000-cu m tank
and separate berthing for a second carrier.
FLNG is managed by a general partner owned 50% by Michael S. Smith

“It is time to move” towards “a new

demand “because of the risk of supply
and demand crossing sooner than expected” if OPEC fails to see the need for
more oil; to improve dialogue and cooperation with host countries; and deal
with technical and financial challenges
but also to work to help oil-producing
countries reduce their carbon footprint
from oil production.
For De Margerie “dialogue and
cooperation with host countries is more
than ever necessary, but the message has
only been partially received.” There are
still 45% proved oil reserves in “closed”

expectations in those countries through

“We must go further and open a

For IFP Pres. Olivier Appert, “the
scene is changing, and the way to cooperate depends on the many different

said.

International Energy Agency’s chief
economist, saw them opening up “a
new world order” as he put the crucial
question: “What role for prices?” IEA,
he said, is working on a study it will
release in November linking thoughts
on the oil price to oil and gas supply in
the years to come.
The point of departure, he said, is
the declining price elasticity of supply

Declining demand elasticity is
matched by declining supply price

propensity to invest among major resource holders. “Price may increasingly
play a ‘clearing’ role indirectly through
its impact on the pace of economic
growth,” he concluded.
For the present, said IEA Executive
Director Nobuo Tanaka, there is no
single explanation for higher oil prices,
which he persisted in seeing as “too
high.” Are they due to the large increase
in money flows, higher costs of materials, the short-term influence of a weak
dollar (even though oil prices are high
in all currencies, he pointed out), or
lack of data on stocks, which aggravate
volatility?

Questions loom
over ESPO line

H

ow long have we been hearing
about Russia’s East Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline project?
The debate has been interminable.
Even as far back as 2005, Russian
officials were fuming about lack of
progress.
That’s when Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov, in an effort to
speed implementation of the project, directed relevant ministries and
departments to prepare a detailed
proposal by Nov. 10 of that year.
Fradkov had signed a resolution on Dec. 31, 2004, to construct
the pipeline, with state-run OAO
Transneft as its designer and builder.

Stages planned
The first stage of the project called
for a 2,400-km oil pipeline from
Taishet to Skovorodino, near the
border with China, along with a rail
oil terminal on Perevoznaya Bay. The
second stage involved construction
of pipeline from Skovorodino on to
Nakhodkha on the Pacific Coast.
Back in August 2005, Boris Govorin, governor of the Irkutsk Region,
even said Russia would soon begin
construction of the first phase of the
pipeline from Taishet (OGJ Online,
Aug. 10, 2005).
Later that year, though, Fradkov
seems to have lost patience. “The setting up of the Eastern Siberia-Pacific
Ocean pipeline system has dragged
out without good reason,” he said.
“One of the priority projects for the
country’s economic development is
practically not being implemented.”
Where are we now? It’s 2008, and
on Apr. 16 government sources said
Russia’s Federal Tariff Service (FTS)

36

would have to approve the highest
possible tariff for pumping oil along
the ESPO line due to the “apparent
unprofitability” of the project.

Unproﬁtable project?
Huh? Can anyone imagine that
the line would be unprofitable in
these days of rising prices around
the globe? Well, believe it or not, the
Russians are actually suggesting that
no tariff proposed by Transneft or the
tariff service will cover the expenses
because delivery volumes will be
limited.
“Given the estimates produced by
Transneft any figure will be unprofitable in relation to this project. If all
current expenses are divided by the
volumes, the figure may come to
$1,000 for a tonne; therefore, FTS
will have to set the highest possible
rate,” a government source said.
Significantly, those rates coincide
with the latest round of discussions
between the Russians and Chinese
regarding the ESPO project. The two
sides Apr. 15 decided to develop project documentation for the construction of a pipeline spur from the main
ESPO line to China.
“For now, all project work has
practically been concluded,” said
Russia’s Deputy Industry and Energy Minister Andrei Dementyev. “If
China agrees with Russian partners
on supplies and on the volume of oil,
then they will make a decision on
the beginning of construction of this
branch,” said Dementyev. “Neither
Transneft nor China seeks to build
the pipeline so that it should be idle.”
Practically concluded? It’s just the
small matter of a large financial guarantee that is stopping the work. ✦

“At the IEA, he elaborated, we do
believe that the many explanations stem
from the coming together of different
factors, including the low level of spare
oil capacity and the continuing mismatch of refining capacity.”
The final oil summit session featured
service companies, whose challenges
were a fitting cap for the whole oil
industry’s growing problems.
One problem they did not have,
however, was a scarcity of projects.
Technip’s president Thierry Pilenko
mentioned having to cope with 170
“megaprojects” of increasing complexity and size during 2007-10. These
billion-dollar projects, he specified,
required specific skills and new frontier
technologies.
As Schlumberger’s EAF Pres. Satish
Pai summed up: access to reservesresources required experienced people
and innovative technology, while
decline and reservoir complexity is
driving technology development.
All to be achieved with rising costs
and—a key challenge for the industry—lack of skilled “human capital,”
especially in the area of strong project
management capabilities, said Technip’s
Pilenko, while Saipem’s Pres. PietroFranco Tali explained that these challenges must be overcome through “a
global approach.”
For instance, Schlumberger has
recruited over 6,000 engineers from
200 universities in 80 countries, and
training them will form a “major part
of the 400,000 training days targeted in
2008.”
Saipem for its part is adding 1,000
people in Malaysia and adding another
1,000 in India, where another Saipem
is being replicated for added value, acting on the assumption that “companies
should invest in central hubs where you
put experienced people.” Also crucial is
large investment in “the right type of
assets” for the future.
And central to all these policies
lies the commitment to “sustainable
growth” and dealing with environmental problems right from the early
project design stage and beyond. ✦

CATSKILL DEPOSITION

Geologic setting
The Catskill Delta of the northern
Appalachian basin is composed of a
complex of predeltaic and deltaic sedimentary rocks of Devonian age.
Lower Devonian rocks are generally
considered to be pre-Catskill Delta. They
consist of interbedded limestone and
sandstone reservoirs; the most famous
of these reservoirs is the Oriskany formation. The Oriskany has gone through
numerous phases of development and
most recently has been developed for
natural gas storage.
Traditionally, the Catskill Delta con38

New York is found. Van Tyne1 provides
a detailed discussion of the potential of
Devonian reservoirs in New York.
Most recent developments in Pennsylvania (and West Virginia) involve
the Marcellus member of the Hamilton Group. In these areas, erosion or
nondeposition has caused much of the
Upper Hamilton Group (or equivalent) to be lost; only the Marcellus
member remains to be successfully
developed.
The core of the Catskill Delta (and its
Pennsylvania coequivalent) is found in
the eastern third of the respective states.
The members of each depositional
pulse are thicker and more developed
as one travels eastward, increasing the
potential for source rock and reservoir
horizons to form.
Recent work by Linsley2 and others
has suggested that there is a cyclical
nature to each pulse of deposition (Fig.
2). Each general cycle includes organic
shale overlain or interbedded with
siltstones and sandstones; this coincides
geologically with the types of sediments
that should be found with an emerging
delta.
It also suggests that sandstones and
siltstones (with reservoir potential?)
lie in proximity to organic shale source
rock. This is dissimilar to the lithology
and sedimentology of the Barnett shale.
It implies that different reservoirs will
be found in the Devonian of the AppalaOil & Gas Journal / Apr. 21, 2008

new carbon dioxide floods mostly account for the increase in projects.
Outside of the US, the number of
projects continues to increase, although
operators for some of these projects did
not update information listed in the
previous survey (OGJ, Apr. 17, 2006, p.
37).

Survey description
OGJ published its first EOR survey in
May 3, 1971, and the survey has been a
biennial OGJ feature since 1974.
Tables A through
E (pp. 47-59) list
the projects in the
2008 EOR survey.
Projects listed
are those that
involve injecting
fluids, other than
water or methane,
into a reservoir to
improve or enhance oil recovery.
Operators use the
injectants during
the initial production stage, after the
primary depletion
stage, or after the
secondary production stage, which also is known as
tertiary recovery.
The most common injectants include:
• Steam in heavy oil fields at shallower depths.
• Air for in situ combustion projects.
• Carbon dioxide in lighter oil fields.
• Hydrocarbon miscible gas in
lighter oil fields.

O D U C T I O N

• Chemicals and polymer in lighter
oil fields.
Acid gas, a concentrated stream of
hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, is
a new type of injectant seeing applications in EOR. Apache Canada Ltd. has
a pilot in the Zama field in northwestern Alberta that produces about 1,000
bo/d.
Chevron Corp. also injects sour gas
as part
of its
secondgeneration
project
in the
Tengiz
field in Kazakhstan. A Chevron Mar. 13,
2008, presentation to analysts said that
this expansion has increased production
by 250,000 bo/d.
Petroleum Development Oman also
has under development the $1 billion
Harweel sour-gas injection project in

US projects
OGJ’s survey shows EOR contributing 643,000 b/d to US oil production (Tables 1 and 2), a 9,700-bo/d
decrease from the 2006 survey. The
production numbers represent the
estimated production at the beginning
of the year.
The survey includes 184 active projects, an increase of 32 compared with
the 2006 survey.
Oil production decline in the mature
thermal heavy-oil projects, mostly in
California, is the main explanation for
production decreasing. Production from
US projects using thermal methods
peaked in 1986 at 480,000 bo/d and
has declined to the current 292,000
bo/d, or 12,000 bo/d less than shown
in the 2006 survey.
Chevron Corp.’s operated Kern River
field remains the largest single EOR
project in the US, producing about
83,000 b/d, based on California Conservation Department statistics. Updated
EOR statistics from Chevron were not
42

available at press time.
Aera Energy LLC, a venture of ExxonMobil Corp. and Shell Inc., produces
95,000 bo/d from 17 projects, but this
is a decrease from the 107,000 bo/d
listed in the 2006 survey.
Oil production from in situ combustion has increased to 17,000 bo/d
or 4,000 bo/d more than in the last
survey. Encore Acquisition Co. has three
projects while Continental Resources
Inc. has 12 in fields in North and South
Dakota as well as in Montana.
The combustion project with the
most production is Continental Resources’ Ceder Hill North Unit in
Bowman County, ND. The company says
the unit produces 11,500 bo/d or an
increase of 3,400 bo/d from the last
survey.
Thermal projects typically have
long lives. For instance, the fire flood
in Louisiana’s Bellevue field started in
1970 and the field still produces 280
bo/d, while steam injection started in
California’s Belridge field, now operated

by Aera, in 1961; the field currently
produces 33,000 bo/d.
Steam injection projects outside of
California also include a TXCO pilot in
the Maverick basin of South Texas and
MegaWest Energy’s planned pilot in
Vernon County, Mo.
In the US, the number of CO2 miscible injection projects for enhancing
oil recovery has increased (Table 1).
The survey lists 100 ongoing projects
compared with the 79 in the 2006 survey. Enhanced oil recovered from these
projects also has increased to 240,000
b/d from the 235,000 b/d shown in
the previous survey.
Units of Occidental Petroleum Corp.
continue to add CO2 projects. Oxy now
operates 28 projects compared with 27
listed in the 2006 survey.
Denbury Resources Inc. also has
added CO2 floods. It now has 13 active
floods compared with 7 listed in the
previous survey. All of its CO2 floods are
in Mississippi except for one in Louisiana. Fig. 1 shows Denbury’s existing

and planned fields.
Oxy’s Wasson Denver Unit is the field
with the most CO2 EOR production,
producing 26,850 bo/d. CO2 injection
in the field started in 1983.
Most US hydrocarbon miscible projects are on the North Slope of Alaska
with the largest in the Prudhoe Bay and
44

Kuparuk River fields.
The survey does not include any US
EOR projects that involve injecting surfactants, polymers, or other chemicals.
These projects tend to be smaller and
with shorter lives, and operators chose
not to respond to the survey.
One recent announcement on a

chemical flood is Rex Energy’s plan for
starting two alkali-surfactant-polymer
(ASP) pilots in an old oil field in the
Illinois basin in second-quarter 2008.
(OGJ, Feb. 11, 2008, p. 39).
The pilots will be on 1-acre spacing

oil field in the basin and for some
other targeted
fields.
If both company’s meet their
Antrim
obligations, EOR
gas
Inc. expects the
plant
pipeline to be
built by late 2010.
Denbury has
plans to increase
its CO2 pipeline,
with one possible
line transporting CO2 into East
Texas. The company also has signed
CO2 purchase contracts with three
planned chemical
plants. In a January presentation,
Denbury said,
contingent on the plants being built, it
expects to obtain:
• 190-225 MMcfd from the Faustina
petroleum coke gasification plant, Donaldsonville, La., starting in 2010.
• 190-225 MMcfd from the USTransCarbon gasification plant, Beaumont, Tex., starting in 2011.
• 350-400 MMcfd from the Rentech
gasification plant, Natchez, Miss., starting in 2011-12.
In Wyoming, Anadarko Corp. has
plans to extend to the Linch-Sussex
area its 125-mile pipeline that currently
transports CO2 to the Salt Creek and
Monell fields. The La Barge gas plant is
the source for this CO2.

The future in CO2, January 2008

produces about 1,800 bo/d from 1,000
wells and Rex Energy says initial oil in
place in the field, the largest in the Illinois basin, was an estimated 1 billion
bbl of which about 400 million bbl has
been produced
Another chemical flood is Cano
Petroleum Inc. alkaline-surfactant-polymer pilot consisting of four wells on
2.5 acres in the Nowata field. ASP injection started toward the end of 2007 and
Cano expects incremental oil production in 2008.

CO2 availability
Availability of CO2 limits industry’s
ability to expand CO2 EOR flooding
in the US (Fig. 2). Charles Fox, vicepresident of Kinder Morgan Carbon
Dioxide Co., told OGJ that the company
had completed its DOE canyon gas
plant in southwestern Colorado in early
2008, thereby adding 107 MMcfd of
CO2 availability to the Permian basin of
West Texas and New Mexico. He added
that expansion in McElmo dome, also
in Colorado, by mid-2008 will add
another 200 MMcfd of CO2 production
capacity. The addition CO2 form McElmo dome and DOE canyon has been

Gas plants

already sold to existing projects and
to the North Ward Estes EOR project,
which is the anchor field for deliveries
from DOE canyon, Fox said.
In 2007, Fox noted that the average
amount of CO2 deliveries to the Permian basin was 1.371 bcf/day, broken
down as 966 MMcfd from McElmo
dome, 290 MMcfd from Bravo dome,
40 MMcfd from Sheep Mountain, and
75 MMcfd from Val Verde gas plants.
These deliveries were slightly less than
the 1.388 bcf/day delivered in 2006.
Fox explains that the lower deliveries
were due to an imbalance in demand
and supply during summer 2007. He
expects CO2 deliveries to the Permian
basin during 2008 will set a record.
Enhanced Oil Resources Inc. recently announce a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) for developing a
pipeline with SunCoast Energy Corp. to
carry CO2 350 miles from its St. Johns,
Ariz., helium and CO2 field to the Permian basin. The company’s initial plans
are to transport 350 MMcfd of CO2 into
the Permian basin. The pipeline design
capacity will be 500 MMcfd.
EOR Inc. has reserved the right to the
first 175 MMcfd of capacity for its own

Other countries
Chevron Corp.’s operated Duri field
on Sumatra Island in Indonesia remains
the largest single EOR project in the
world, producing about 190,000 bo/d.
In 2007, Chevron announced the
start of surfactant-polymer pilot in Minas field, the largest field in Indonesia,
with about 4 billion bbl of oil initially

in place. The company expects to start
chemical injection in early 2011 and
expects results in 2012.
Chevron also has under construction
the North Duri steamflood that will
start producing in 2008 and is expected
to attain 70,000 bo/d of production.
Another steamflood Chevron has
under construction is in the Neutral
Zone between Suadi Arabia and Kuwait.
Production started in 2007 and Chevron expects production to reach 10,000
bo/d in 2008.
Other countries with active EOR
projects include China and Venezuela,
although the operators did not update
the statistics for these projects.
Petroleos Mexicanos had good
success in increasing oil production
with nitrogen injection in the offshore
Cantarell field , where oil production
increased to more than 2 million b/d in
2004 from the 1 million b/d in 1996.
Currently Cantarell produces about 1.8
million b/d.
Pemex also has started nitrogen
injection in the Ku-Maloob-Zapp, and
Jujo Tecominoacan fields.
Bankers Petroleum Ltd. began a
steam injection pilot in the Patos Marinza in Albania. The Company expects
to drill eight new wells in its thermal
steam project in the fourth quarter of
2008.
Petroleum Development Oman
besides its Harweel sour-gas injection
project, in 2007 started injected steam
in the Amal West field pilot (OGJ, Nov.
5, 2007, pp. 56-65). In 2008, it has
plans to start steam injection pilots in
Amal East and Thayfut fields in 2008.
Other PDO EOR projects under construction are steam projects in Qarn
Alam and Fahud fields, as wells as
a polymer flood in Marmul field. It
expects Qarn Alam to come on stream
in 2010 and produce about 30,000
bo/d and to start in 2008 steam injection in Fahud and polymer injection in
Marmul. In Oman, Occidental is also
developing the Mukhalza steam injection project. ✦

O C E S S I N G
Saudi Aramco was
experiencing serious
fouling and corrosion
in the second preheat
train in the crude unit
Refining
in its Yanbu refinery. The
problems were due to
underdeposit, inorganic deposit, and
high-temperature sulfide corrosion,
which led to pressure buildup and tube
leaks in the
crude unit.
Relocating the
caustic injection point
to upstream
of the crude
heater allowed the refiner to overcome
heat exchanger fouling and solve maintenance problems.
On average, this project is saving
$80,000/year in maintenance costs. The
cost avoidance of dumping diesel to
fuel oil is about $1.5 million/year.
This article discusses the problems
faced after the relocating project and
lessons learned.

heaters. After the first preheat stage,
water is added to the preheated crude
before it enters the desalters.
A 3°Baume (Be) caustic solution is
injected upstream of the desalters to
neutralize acids formed. Also, a 3°Be
caustic is injected downstream of the
desalters for corrosion control.
Since Yanbu started up in 1983, the
second preheat stage exchangers had a
history of active corrosion and fouling
problems. Aramco’s Consultant Services
Department (CSD) strongly recommended implementing a best practice,
which was to relocate the downstream
caustic injection to upstream of the
crude heaters from downstream of the
desalters to eliminate corrosion and
fouling in the second preheat exchangers.

Process overview

The crude distillation process (Unit
V04) involves the crude charge flowing
through preheating, desalting, charge
heating, crude column distillation, and
naphtha fractionation. The crude unit
consists of two identical preheat trains
(A and B).

After the first preheat train, crude
flows to the desalters at about 120-125°
C. and is mixed with wash water before
entering the desalters. From the desalters, crude passes through the secondstage preheat train that heats the crude
to its flash temperature in a series of
three heat exchangers:
• E-5. Desalted crude-circulating

• E-6. Desalted crude-heavy diesel

pumped in the flash drum bottoms
pump, P2, to the final preheat section:
• E-8. Desalted crude-circulating

• E-9. Desalted crude-hot reduced
crude exchanger.
Preheated crude finally enters crude
charge heaters, H-1A and B, where it is
heated to crude column flash-zone requirements. The heater outlet temperature is controlled at 375° C.

The 3°Be caustic is injected upstream of the desalters to neutralize
acids formed during the hydrolysis
of salt. Caustic injection is controlled
to maintain a pH value of 6-7 in the

Fouling, corrosion problems
Aramco had observed, since the
refinery started up in 1983, that the
middle preheat exchangers V04-E5, E6,
and E7 had active corrosion and fouling
problems, caused by underdeposit, inorganic deposits, and high-temperature
sulfide corrosion, which lead to pressure buildup and tube leaks.
Underdeposit corrosion products
are activated mainly by elevated temperatures on the inlet shell-sides of the
exchangers, which lead to underdeposit
corrosion due to partial vaporization of
the water and light ends in the crude.
The high temperature of the crude passing through the second preheat train
is another factor that can
accelerate such fouling.

train was designed to minimize salt in
the feed. The outlet design for salt is less
than 1 lb/1,000 bbl. This target was not
attainable due to low desalter efficiency,
caused by an inadequate water wash
rate and a low desalter residence time.
The water wash injection, according
to industrial best practices, should be
3-5 vol % to assure that the required
salts are dissolved compared with the
existing injection rate, which is around
2.9 vol %. A correct desalter residence
time is also important in ensuring that
no water carryover occurs. The calculated residence time of the Aramco
desalter was 11.5 min at 235,000 b/d,
which is less than the design rate of 15
min at 170,000 b/d.
We concluded that downstream
caustic injection acts as a catalyst for
fouling and underdeposit corrosion,
which increases the pressure drop and
leakage in the middle preheat exchangers.

Caustic injection relocation
CSD recommended relocating the
downstream caustic injection to 66
m upstream of the V04H1A/B heater
from its previous location downstream
of the desalters. This would enhance
overhead corrosion control of chlorides
and would eliminate the corrosion and
fouling problem in the second preheat
exchangers.
The design included adding a crude
slipstream to the caustic stream before
it is injected in the 14-in. heater charge
line to eliminate water vaporization
and caustic deposition. In addition, an
interlock system would trip the caustic
pumps if the crude slipstream flow is
low.
The premixed caustic injection point
is 66 m upstream of the crude charge
heater passes. This is to allow the premixed caustic to mix well with the bulk
crude.
In addition, Monel 400 was used to
construct the piping downstream of the
crude slipstream-caustic mixing point.
The quill and the static mixer were also
constructed of Monel 400. The new
caustic injection point was started up
on May 2006.
Fig. 4 shows the new caustic injection configuration.

Furthermore, this project prevented
the frequent isolation of V04-E6 A/B.
The isolation of this exchanger resulted
in the dumping of HDO product to the
fuel oil stream, reducing the production
of diesel (Table 1).
On average, the V04-E6 isolation

Post relocation project
Aramco observed that frequent fouling of the second preheat exchangers
was eliminated. Testing and inspection
of eight desalted crude heat exchangers V04-E5 and E6 were completed on
July 2007. An initial visual inspection
revealed that all components were in
good condition without any significant
mechanical damage.
A 100% magnetic particle inspection, conducted on the internal weld
seems of the shells, channel box, and
covers, did not reveal any defects. All
exchangers passed initial and final hydrostatic tests.
Aramco experienced major savings
due to this project. Before, on average,
10 exchangers/year were fouled and
leaked. Mechanical cleaning, hydrotesting, and maintenance labor cost

Possible leak location due to a burn-through
of the 1 ½-in. pipe during welding or
cracking of the weld due to fatigue

occurred 10 times annually, with an
average of 3 days of maintenance work.
The cost of dumping HDO to fuel oil is
$1.5 million/year (Table 2).
On average, this relocation project is
saving $1.8 million/year.

Corrosion
After relocating the caustic injection
on May 2006, inspection data at the
new caustic injection locations revealed unacceptable corrosion rates in
the 14-in. crude lines upstream of the
heaters for Trains A and B.
Table 3 and Fig. 5 show that the
estimated localized corrosion rates were
0.6 mm/5 months for Train A (at the
bottom) and 0.4 mm/5 months for
Train B (at the top).
CSD, P&CSD, and Yanbu plant personnel conducted a root-cause analysis to
focus on potential causes and actions
necessary to minimize corrosion. This
included examining the detailed inspection data (ultrasonic testing, radiographs, scans, and infrared), as well
as design, fabrication, and operational
parameters.
The parties concluded that the damage mechanisms for each train were
different and most likely scenario for
the attack was:
• Metal losses in the 14-in. crude
lines were due to general corrosion
attack from the caustic, which attacked
the pipe wall before it was diluted with
crude. This would explain the highly
localized corrosion seen immediately
downstream of the injection point in
the 6 o’clock position for Train A and in
the 12 o’clock position for Train B.
• For Train A, the parties suspected
that there are leaks of partially undiluted caustic on the 14-in. carbon steel
line from the root of fillet welds of the
quill end plate that is causing corrosion
(Fig. 6). Infrared surveys showed localized areas of much lower temperatures.
• For Train B, the parties suspected
that improper mixing was allowing
some of the caustic to drift upwards to
the crude piping, leading to localized
attack. The end plate weld in this case
appeared to be solid and intact. Also,

we cannot be certain if there could be a
small leak in the flange weld that could
allow top of the line corrosion (Fig. 7).

Further work
The investigation team believes that
the leak on the quill plugged itself. In
the meantime, Aramco is conducting
biweekly ultrasonic testing scanning
on the new injection points to ensure
integrity of the crude line. Furthermore,
Aramco will take the first coming shutdown opportunity to visually inspect
the injection quill for replacement or
upgrade. ✦

This article details both the static
and dynamic tests conducted at Fujiang
crossing in an effort to find a scientific
basis for drafting vibration absorbing
measures.
Static tests demonstrated little difference between horizontal and vertical
damping ratios and the higher the
frequency, the smaller the damping
ratio. Dynamic tests showed that the
maximum vibration displacement of
the Fujiang pipeline crossing did not
occur at the middle of the main span,
but instead somewhere between the
1
⁄4-mark and the middle.

Dynamic characteristics
Pigs drive the fluid in front of them,
formng slack two-phase flow. Flow
patterns and liquid content change
dynamically, creating continuous loading change when pigging is under way.
Introducing a slack factor determines
dynamic loading of the crossing during
pigging. Similarity principle and laboratory experiments determined the slack
factor (Equation 1).
The change in flow direction at the
vertical temperature compensator (Fig.
2a) creates an impact load at the elbow.
Momentum theory guides development of a mechanical balance equation
(Equation 2), allowing calculation of
the impact load.
Friction of the pig and pressure
differences between the flow preceding it and the flow following it create
changes of velocity in straight-line
segments (Fig. 2b). The Hamilton principle guides deduction of the straightline axial flow, which in turn informs
construction of a mechanical balance
equation (Equation 3).
As a pig drives the slack fluid
through the crossing, it will create an
active force and deform the pipe. The
deformation will change fluid flow parameters such as liquid-containing rate,
speed, and pressure. The change of flow
parameters will in turn affect the crossing’s vibration properties, displacing the
crossing and creating large vibrations.
These factors prompted application
of a large displacement, minor-strain

nonlinearity finite element method to
analyze the dynamic characteristics of
crossing during pigging.
Ascertaining dynamic characteristics
of the crossing during pigging requires
prior establishment of basic differential
equations regarding the pipeline, cables,
and towers. Geometry required assessment of nonlinear factors such as initial
internal force at the crossing, rope sag,
and equivalent variable cross-section
beam dynamics. Analysis assumed that
ropes were tensional, not based on
compression. The special finite element
method guided the setup of basic differential equations.
Boundary constraints of the main

components of the crossing structure
followed establishment of the fundamental equations of the pipeline, ropes,
and towers. These included:
• Anchored block. The displacement
and angle deformation of the pipeline at each anchoring block direction
equals 0.
• Junction between tower, cables.
The Fujiang pipeline crossing featured
cable element nodes and tower element nodes with identical displacement
and angle deformation, caused by an
inability to separate slides between the
dragline and the tower top.
• Junction between cables, pipeline.

junction blocks gave the cable element
node and pipeline element node identical displacement and angle deformation.
The crossing’s structural properties,
geometric nonlinearity, and dynamic
loading characteristics allow building a
nonlinear finite element model. Equation 4 expresses basic node displacement. Equation 5 shows the finite
element’s relationship between stress
and strain.
The d-Alembert principle allows
building the elements’ fundamental

kinetics equation (Equation 6).
Analyzing the dynamic characteristics of a pipeline bridge suspended by
diagonal cable required initial definition
of the crossing’s incremental kinetics
using the Lagrange UL column (Equation 7).
These matrices are typically implicit

Field testing
Static and dynamic tests measured
the Sichuan Jiangyou pipeline bridge’s
properties. The static test first measured
the crossing’s self-vibration frequency,
amplitude, damping ratio, and the
cables’ inner force using the environment random stimulation method.
Table 1 shows select results of static
testing.
Dynamic tests then measured acceleration and vibration parameters at each
position. Devices set up at each end of the
crossing for compression, water injection,
and pig launch and receiving controlled
water quantity and pig speed during
testing. Testing measured displacement,
pipeline inner strain, and cable inner
strain in varied operating conditions at
each 1⁄8 increment of the crossing is main
span, at the gantry, and at the temperature
compensators. Tables 2 and 3 show select
dynamic testing results.

Results, analysis
Combined theoretical analysis and
field testing simplified the complicated
flow in the vertical temperature compensator, yielding slack factor n, which
provided a basis to evaluate dynamic
loading near the compensator. UsCABLE INTERNAL FORCE*

Study: Biofuels
impeding struggle
against poverty
Burning food for fuel is hurting hungry
people.
This will surprise no one except, perhaps, politicians hawking biofuels. Some
still think biofuels ﬁght global warning and
ensure energy security.
They’re not just incorrect but also—
in view of how their mistakes affect the
impoverished—wrong.
“Poor people are suffering daily from

the impact of high food prices, especially in
urban areas and in low-income countries,”
said World Bank Group Pres. Robert B.
Zoellick on Apr. 9.
He was commenting on a new World
Bank study of the recent spurt in food
prices and appealing for an international
response. “In some countries,” he said,
“hard-won gains in overcoming poverty
may now be reversed.”
The study says global wheat prices
increased by 181% during the 36 months
leading up to February. Overall global food
prices were up 83%.
Increased biofuel production accounts
for much of the increase, the study says.
As though anticipating responses typical of
biofuel fans, the study points out droughts
in Australia and poor crops in Europe and
Ukraine in 2006-07 were offset by good
crops and increased exports elsewhere.
And only about 15% of the increase in
food production prices, the study says, can
be attributed directly to increased energy
and fertilizer costs.
Relief will take a while.
“Food crop prices are expected to remain high in 2008 and 2009 and then begin
to decline as supply and demand respond
to high prices,” the study says. “However,
they are likely to remain well above the
2004 levels through 2015 for most food
crops.”
The World Bank study diplomatically
points out that governments have been
pushing biofuels out of concern about
global warming and energy supply. It
doesn’t address the extent to which those
supposed beneﬁts have been oversold.
Its central message is that the biofuels
surge is impeding the struggle against poverty. Last year, an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development “round
table” challenged the environmental and
supply extension claims made on behalf of
biofuels (OGJ, Sept. 24, 2007, p. 17). It predicted the food-price jumps documented by
the World Bank study.
When will the biofuels nonsense stop?

Energy prices climb
The front-month contract for benchmark US crudes jumped past $112/bbl Apr. 9
following a report that inventories of crude, gasoline, and distillate fuel fell to unexpectedly low levels in the week ended Apr. 4.
The May contract for US sweet, light crudes hit an intraday high of $112.21/bbl
before closing at a record $110.87/bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Heating
oil and the May IPE contract for North Sea Brent crude also hit new highs in intraday
trade as did the April gas oil contract in London.
Prices slipped in the Apr. 10 session but remained near record highs, with markets still concerned about tight supplies and the weak US dollar. Crude prices were
essentially ﬂat Apr. 11 but managed a gain for the week as the International Energy
Agency in Paris again reduced its estimate of global crude demand for 2008.
The May contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes increased 3¢ to $110.14/
bbl Apr. 11 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. West Texas Intermediate gained
$3.91/bbl during the calendar week, set a new record high, but fell 7¢ short of
registering the highest weekly close, said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland. “Brent gains were at par at [an increase of] $3.85/bbl. Heating oil made much
stronger gains, [up] $8.41/bbl while reformulated blend stock for oxygenate blending
(RBOB) was adding only $2.12/bbl. Natural gas was up 6.2%,” he said.
Jakob said: “WTI continues to be tightly correlated to the movements of the dollar
index. However, while in the previous week WTI had spent the week slightly below
the correlation, this last week it was slightly above. The main reason why the correlation is so strong is that it has become a self-fulﬁlling trade with very few volunteers
to trade against it until it is proven broken. Gold, which had also been strongly correlated to the dollar, has not followed the correlation as strongly as oil, and the gold to
crude ratio continues to come off. For the oil to dollar correlation to be broken would
require a set of fundamental numbers bearish enough to be a no-brainer.”
IEA’s demand estimate
In its Apr. 11 report, IEA reduced its estimate of global crude demand for 2008 by
310,000 b/d to 87.2 million b/d on the downgrading of global gross domestic product prospects by the United Nation’s International Monetary Fund, coupled with “a
change in former Soviet Union methodology and baseline data revisions,” ofﬁcials
said.
On the other hand, IEA increased its estimate of 2007 demand, up 140,000 b/d to
86 million b/d. “As a result of these divergent shifts, demand growth in 2008 is now
expected at almost 1.3 million b/d, or 1.5% over 2007,” the agency reported.
Its estimate of global oil supply fell by 100,000 b/d in March to 87.3 million b/d,
due to reduced supplies from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the
North Sea, and non-OPEC Africa. “Non-OPEC supply growth in 2008 is trimmed to
815,000 b/d on a broad swathe of adjustments in the Americas, Africa, and Europe,”
IEA said.
It said, “OPEC crude supply fell by 265,000 b/d in March to 32.1 million b/d, on
ﬁeld maintenance in the UAE, Nigeria, and Venezuela. Pipeline and power outages
highlighted ongoing risks to production in Iraq and Nigeria amid effective spare
capacity of just 2.3 million b/d. Weaker economic growth cuts the 2008 call on OPEC
by 300,000 b/d to 31.6 million b/d.”
Global reﬁnery throughput weakened in March, as poor margins curbed crude
runs in all regions of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
IEA’s estimated ﬁrst quarter 2008 global throughput remained unchanged at 74 million b/d. However, it reduced second quarter estimates by 200,000 b/d to 73.7 million
b/d, in line with weaker demand.
IEA’s reduction of its world demand outlook was “actually the largest revisions
made since [the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the US], and the total lack of
immediate market response is showing to the IEA what OPEC has been saying all
along, and that is that the oil futures market is currently not trading the oil fundamentals,” said Jakob. “At the time of the IEA release, the dollar was trending lower,
and there are just not any volunteers ready to trade a bearish IEA report against the
dollar.” Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, “We
continue to believe that both the IEA’s demand and non-OPEC supply numbers are
too high.”
The US dollar fell against most major currencies as ﬁnance ministers of the
Group of Seven leading nations met in Washington, D.C., Apr. 11-13.

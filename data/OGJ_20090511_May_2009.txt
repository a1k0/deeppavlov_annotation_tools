In troubled times fierce global
competition for premium crudes
means that refinery units must
have the flexibility to handle
heavy, viscous, dirty crudes that
increasingly threaten to dominate
markets. And flexibility must
extend to products as well as
crudes, for refinery product
demand has become more and
more subject to violent economic
and political swings. Thus refiners must have the greatest flexibility in determining yields of
naphtha, jet fuel, diesel and vacuum gas oil products.

Why Do Many
Crude/Vacuum
Units Perform
Poorly?
In many cases it’s because the
original design was based more
on virtual than actual reality.
There is no question: computer
simulations have a key role
to play but it’s equally true
that process design needs to be
based on what works in the field
and not on the ideals of the
process simulator. Nor should the
designer simply base the equipment selection on vendor-stated
performance. The design engineer needs to have actual refinery
process engineering experience,
not just expertise in office-based

PROCESS

CONSULTING
SERVICES,INC.

modeling. Refinery hands-on
experience teaches that fouling,
corrosion, asphaltene precipitation, crude variability, and crude
thermal instability, and many
other non-ideals are the reality.
Theoretical outputs of process or
equipment models are not. In this
era of slick colorful PowerPoint®
presentations by well-spoken
engineers in Saville Row suits,
it’s no wonder that units don’t
work. Shouldn’t engineers wearing Nomex® coveralls who have
worked with operators and taken
field measurements be accorded
greater credibility?
Today more than ever before this
is important. Gone are the days
when a refiner could rely on
uninterrupted supplies of light,
sweet, easy-to-process crudes.
3400 Bissonnet
Suite 130
Houston, Texas 77005
USA

Rather than a single point process
model, the crude/vacuum unit
design must provide continuous
flexibility to operate reliably over
long periods of time. Simply
meeting the process guarantee 90
days after start-up is very different than having a unit still operating well after 5 years. Sadly few
refiners actually achieve this—no
matter all the slick presentations
by engineers in business suits!

If you want to explore these issues
in technical detail ask for
Technical Papers 267 and 268.

Work begins on Calabar Energy City in Nigeria
Work has begun to create an energy city in Calabar, Nigeria, that
will allow oil companies to fabricate some of their required material and ease their logistic and infrastructure issues.
Eyo Ekpo, special adviser on projects in Cross River, told OGJ that
the 376 hectares of land in Cross River state will be funded and managed through public-private partnership. The land is swamped and the
government has begun to reclaim the site at Ekorinim Peninsula for the
industrial area and a portion of Pamol Rubber Estate for residential.
Ekpo said, “We have been doing modeling for the past 6-9
months [and] we’re ready to go next year.” He said he was holding
discussions with the Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority to acquire tax
breaks for companies that would establish operations in the park.
Calabar Energy City (CEC) is an initiative launched by Sen. Liyel Imoke, the governor of Cross River state. Ekpo told OGJ that there would
be a 25-hectare tank farm complex with a loading jetty, a river parts
complex, a heliport, a medical center, and a hotel and business complex.
He said a private company would manage the park and he expects there
to be strong interest from companies in using its resources.
For the first phase, oil companies will be able to secure 220-hectare plots under leases on the ecoindustrial park to carry out infrastructure and facilities. The second phase, covering 500 hectares
north of Calabar, will focus on zones for residential, sporting, religious, and commercial uses. The industrial area is key to CEC,
but both parts will be served by utility and infrastructure services
delivered to high standards.
Cross River state is within the Niger Delta, and the project will
position Calabar as a secure and viable location for the oil industry,
Ekpo told OGJ. It will also create job opportunities in the region
and beyond.
CEC will take advantage of the federal government’s policy that
requires 60% of man-hours be carried out within the operating
region. This has been difficult to meet in the Niger Delta due to the
violence and attacks by militants.

Salazar, Locke restore ESA consultation requirement
The US Interior and Commerce departments are revoking a
George W. Bush administration order and requiring consultations
with their two agencies that administer the Endangered Species Act
(ESA), the two departments’ secretaries announced.
Federal agencies will once again have to consult with wildlife experts at the US Fish and Wildlife Service at DOI and the National

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at Commerce before taking
any action which might affect threatened species, Interior Secretary
Ken Salazar and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said on Apr. 28.
The action rolls back an order that Salazar’s predecessor, Dirk A.
Kempthorne, said would simplify regulations at the two agencies
by not making them review every action involving the ESA unless
they considered it necessary. Kempthorne said this would make
operations more efficient and let the agencies give more attention
to truly pressing matters.
Salazar characterized it as another Bush administration 11th
hour regulation. “By rolling [it] back, we are ensuring that threatened and endangered species continue to receive the full protection of the law. Because science must serve as the foundation for
decisions we make, federal agencies proposing to take actions that
might affect threatened or endangered species have to consult with
biologists at the two departments,” he said.
“For decades, the [ESA] has protected threatened species and
their habitats. Our decision affirms the administration’s commitment to using sound science to promote conservation and protect
the environment,” Locke said.
The two secretaries said that US President Barack H. Obama directed them in March to review the previous administration’s Section 7 regulation in the ESA, which covers consultation. Congress,
in the 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, authorized them to revoke the regulation, they added.
Locke and Salazar said the two departments would jointly review the 1986 consultation regulations to determine if any improvements are needed.
Environmental organizations applauded the move. “The Bush rules
would have allowed agencies with little or no wildlife expertise to
make decisions that could mean life or death for animals like the polar bear. Today’s decision restores the important protections for species
and their habitats offered by one of our nation’s most fundamental
environmental laws,” said Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope.
“For decades, the [ESA] has used sound science as the guide to
protect America’s most vulnerable plants and animals. Today, the
Obama administration reaffirmed that politics should not be the
driver of these protections. Our nation needs to start investing in
new and better infrastructure projects, and restoring this law will
make sure we do so without harming our endangered plants and
animals,” said Rebecca Riley, a lawyer with the Natural Resources
Defense Council’s Endangered Species Project. ✦

Tooth Unit about 20 miles southwest of the Colville River Unit
development on the North Slope of Alaska.
Test production rates for these wells ranged from 500 b/d to
1,300 b/d of high-gravity oil. Gas production rates averaged 1.5
MMcfd for each well, the companies said.
“No further delineation drilling is planned for Pioneer or Rendezvous at this time,” the companies said. These two accumulations
will be pursued as possible satellite developments with processing
at the Alpine facilities in the Colville River Unit.
Operator ConocoPhillips holds 78% interest in the Greater
Mooses Tooth Unit, while Anadarko holds 22%.

rig to drill the Canon prospect, which lies 11 km west of Veslefrikk
field in the North Sea. The well was drilled to prove petroleum in
a fault block between the Huldra and Oseberg fields, said StatoilHydro.
The rig’s charter with StatoilHydro will terminate once the well
is completed.
This is the second well to be tested in the Canon structure. An
exploration well drilled in 2000 provided inconclusive results
about the economic potential of the structure.
StatoilHydro operates production license 052 with an 18%
share. Other parters include Petoro 37%, RWE Dea Norge 13.5%,
Revus Energy 4.5%, and Talisman Resources Norge 27%.

Barrett probing two eastern Utah gas shales
Bill Barrett Corp., Denver, expects to learn the outcome by mid2009 at a horizontal well spud late in the first quarter of 2009
seeking gas in Upper Mississippian Manning Canyon shale at 8,000
ft true vertical depth.
The prospect lies in northern Emery County southeast of Price,
Utah, along the San Rafael Swell on the Uinta basin southwestern flank. Numerous wells as far west as Drunkards Wash coalbed
methane field in Carbon County have had gas shows in Manning
Canyon.
The horizontal well offsets an initial vertical well drilled in
2008 that indicated good gas shows and high gas content in core.
Bill Barrett holds 50% working interest in the deep prospect.
The company has also drilled two vertical wells to 3,900 ft in
the fractured Juana Lopez shale member of the Upper Cretaceous
Mancos formation, in which it has 100% working interest. It plans
to complete testing those wells in 2010.

StatoilHydro deems Canon ﬁnd noncommercial
StatoilHydro will permanently plug and abandon its exploration
well on the Canon prospect in the Norwegian North Sea after making a gas-condensate discovery that was deemed noncommercial.
The well tested the upper Brent reservoir and the deeper Statfjord sandstone level, producing gas and condensate in the former
and penetrating tight sands in the latter that was probably full of
water.
Tom Dreyer, StatoilHydro’s vice-president, infrastructure exploration in the North Sea, said the Brent reservoir was thinner than
expected.
The exploration well 30/3-10 S reached a TVD of 3,962 m in
122 m of water. StatoilHydro used the West Alpha semisubmersible

Heritage Oil Corp. has reported the discovery of a giant oil field
in Iraqi Kurdistan with 2.3-4.2 billion bbl of oil in place, of which
50-70% appears recoverable.
Exploration risk of an adjacent structure of similar size is greatly
reduced, Heritage Oil said.
The company said it could start trucking production from Miran
West-1 by the end of 2009, with individual flow rates likely to be
10,000-15,000 b/d/well.
A fractured gross oil-bearing interval of 710 m produced 27°
gravity oil with low sulfur, no water, and a low gas-oil ratio.
The company drillstem tested Miran West-1, the first well ever
drilled on the license, over a 500-m gross interval in the Shiranish, Kometan, and Qamchuqua formations. High reservoir pressures that characterize the region were not encountered in the well,
Heritage said.
“Testing was severely constrained by the limitations of the
downhole and surface testing equipment and the loss of over
100,000 bbl of drilling fluid and lost circulation material due to
the highly fractured nature of the reservoirs,” the company said.
More equipment to carry out longer term tests is expected
within 6-8 weeks. Further drilling on the license is set for later in
2009.
The Miran West and East structures total 330 sq km.
Heritage Energy Middle East operates the Miran license with
75% interest, and Genel Energy International Ltd. has 25%. Heritage mapped the structures from 332 line-km of seismic shot between April and June 2008. ✦

Production

Tupi pilot begins production off Brazil
The extended production test of the giant presalt Tupi discovery
in the Santos basin off Brazil has begun to the BW Cidade de Sao
Vicente FPSO, according to Galp Energia SGPS SA, Lisbon, Portugal.
The FPSO, with a 30,000 bo/d processing capability, is moored
in 2,170-m of water in Block BM-S-11, about 280 km off Rio de
Janeiro’s coast.
Galp Energia says that production will not exceed 14,000 bo/d during the 15-month production test of the Tupi Sul and Tupi-1 wells.
The Tupi field, discovered in October 2006, contains an esti8

Tahiti field, discovered in 2002, is
one of the largest in the gulf and contains 400-500 million boe of recoverable resources, according to Chevron.
The first phase of the project cost $2.7
billion.
Tahiti lies on Green Canyon Blocks
596, 597, 640, and 641 in 4,100 ft of
water about 190 miles south of New
Orleans.
Primary pay sands are Lower to
Middle Miocene at 23,000-28,000 ft
that lie below a 8,000-15,000 ft thick
salt canopy.
The deepest producing well has a
depth of more than 26,700 ft, a record

Cased laterals pay in Mississippi Selma chalk
Penn Virginia Corp., Radnor, Pa., is producing 13 MMcfed from 20
horizontal Cretaceous Selma chalk wells in Mississippi.
The 20 wells averaged initial 30-day rates of 815 Mcfed compared
with 272 Mcfed for vertical wells.
Production in the quarter ended Mar. 31 averaged 23.3 MMcfed,
up 14% from the fourth quarter and 17% from the first quarter of
2008.
Results to date indicate that one horizontal well replaces two to
three vertical wells and recovers four to five times the reserves of a vertical well. Laterals average 3,000 ft and have seven to eight frac stages.

Processing

Penn Virginia plans to cement casing and perforate all future
completions. The first 15 wells are open-hole completion and the
last five have cemented casing and perforations.
Open-hole completions averaged 761 Mcfed after 30 days and
804 Mcfed after 60 days, while cased-perforated completions averaged 1 MMcfed after 30 days and 1.2 MMcfed after 60 days.
Spud to sales averaged 41 days for the three wells drilled in the
2009 first quarter compared with 49 days for the first 17 horizontal wells. Drilling and completion cost has fallen to $2.5 million/
well from $3 million. ✦

ently set for construction on the island.
“The crude oil will be from the Middle East,” said Evita Legowo,
director general for oil and gas at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral

a permit for the development of the planned refinery, and could release no further details.
Meanwhile, other reports have emerged that Gulf Petroleum Ltd.,

other Southeast Asian nations.
Meanwhile, reports said that a $1.5 billion refinery joint venture between Indonesia’s state-owned PT Pertamina and Japan’s
Mitsui & Co. may stall because the Indonesian government wants
an increased stake in the project.
Agreement had been reached to build a residue fluid catalytic
cracking unit with a capacity of 60,000 b/d of gasoline in Per-

tamina’s existing refinery at Cilacap in Central Java, with Mitsui
holding an 80% stake and Pertamina 20%.
But the Indonesian government has advised Pertamina to review
the project and seek a higher stake, a request that could sink the
project altogether according to one source, who said financing for
the refinery already has been approved by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. ✦

EOG to rail Bakken crude to Cushing
EOG Resources Inc., Houston, is implementing a plan to use rail
car unit trains to ship crude produced from the Bakken formation
in North Dakota to the Cushing, Okla., terminal.
EOG Resources has finalized a strategic transportation arrangement with Burlington Northern Santa Fe railway and expects to
have the rail facility operational by February 2010, said Mark Papa,
chairman and chief executive officer.
The deal will afford sharply better long-term oil netbacks than
it is receiving by shipping its oil by pipeline through the hub at
Clearbrook, Minn., Papa said.
The company, which restricted its Bakken oil production for the
first 6 months of 2009 due to marketing issues, expects to resume
full production in Parshall field in North Dakota by July.
In the Williston basin, EOG Resources is running eight rigs
compared with 10 in 2008, and the company has deferred almost
all well completions until summer 2009 when fracs can be performed more economically and road conditions improve.
With natural gas prices languishing, EOG Resources’s $3.1 billion capital budget for 2009 is directed toward liquids investments,
Papa said.
The company raised its 2009 overall oil and gas production
growth target to 5½% from 3%, driven by a 22% increase in liquids output. Most of the increase is to come from its Bakken and
Fort Worth basin Barnett shale plays.

Changes sought in gas line ﬂow posting rules
Calling it a small, but important, adjustment, the Natural Gas
Supply Association asked the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to slightly change gas pipeline flow-posting requirements.
In an Apr. 30 filing, NGSA asked FERC to consider adopting a
“sole-feed” exclusion. This would exempt major noninterstate gas
pipelines from reporting if the pipeline has no, or very small volume
endusers with total receipts of less than 15,000 million BTUs/day, or
if the pipeline feeds into another major pipeline, NGSA said.
Taking this step would reduce the burden and cost of compliance
for small-volume pipelines while continuing to provide clear information to regulators and the public, the trade association added.
NGSA said FERC issued in November Order No. 720, which
requires certain noninterstate and interstate gas lines to post design capacity and daily scheduled gas flow information. The rule
also imposed posting requirements on interstate gas pipelines that
provide no-notice service.
Jenny Fordham, NGSA’s energy markets and government affairs

director, said the association believes FERC got the new reporting
process “about 98% right” when it changed the pipeline reporting
requirements last year.
“Our ‘sole-feed’ proposal would further simply the process and
capture the same data, just a few miles further downstream. A sole-feed
exclusion is consistent with the commission’s desire to establish rules
that will increase transparency without additional cost,” she said.

Paciﬁc Connector line moves closer to fruition
The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a final
environmental impact statement (FEIS) on Pacific Connector Gas
Pipeline LP’s proposed 36-in. OD sendout pipeline, moving the
project one step closer to fruition.
The proposed line would extend from Jordan Cove’s LNG terminal—which was issued its FEIS as part of the same proceeding—
about 234 miles southeast across Coos, Douglas, Jackson, and Klamath counties in Oregon to a terminus near Malin, Ore. From there
the proposed line would interconnect with the existing pipeline
systems of Gas Transmission Northwest Corp., Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co., and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
The 1-bcfd Pacific Connector pipeline would include 1 compressor station, 4 meter stations, 4 pig launchers-receivers, 16
mainline block valves, 5 communication towers, and additional
communications equipment at 8 existing towers.
Pacific Connector has entered into agreements with seven customers who have requested 1.49 bcfd through the proposed line.
Upon finalization of LNG supply commitments at the Jordan Cove
terminal, Pacific Connector will allocate, if needed, the available 1
bcfd amongst the seven customers.
Its route crosses 218 waterbodies (some multiple times) within
6 hydrological subbasins. Installation under 3 major rivers (Coos,
Rogue, and Klamath) will use horizontal directional drilling, while
3 waterbodies (Kentuck Slough, Catching Slough, and the Medford
Aqueduct) will be bored, 1 river (South Umpqua) will have diverted
crossings, and the remainder of the waterbodies will be dry crossed,
except for the open cut wet crossing of a portion of Coos Bay.
Pacific Connector’s current proposed route reduced the crossing
of the Coos Bay estuary to less than 21⁄2 miles. ✦

Correction
The story “LNG supply, fuel competition pose major concerns in US” incorrectly identiﬁed the speaker for Poten
& Partners (OGJ, May 4, 2009, p. 49). Speaking was Jim
Briggs.

A biodiesel trade ﬁght
The US has evoked trade retaliation from Europe with a program most Americans would be
shocked to learn involved international commerce.
The affair shows how governmental meddling
in energy markets yields perverse consequences.
There will be other such lessons.
US taxpayers US subsidize biodiesel—a methyl ester made from agricultural materials—with a tax credit
of $1/gal and mandates. They believe doing so supplements fuel supply and helps the environment. Those
who bother to check the numbers probably derive
satisfaction from reports that their country produced
700 million gal of biodiesel last year, tiny though that
volume is relative to total diesel consumption.
But how many Americans know that their tax
generosity has largely benefited biodiesel produced and used elsewhere?

gency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which
extended the subsidy through the end of this year.
But biodiesel produced in the US and exported
still receives the benefit.
Europe, where countries subsidize their own
biodiesel businesses, is fighting back. In March,
the European Commission imposed temporary
countervailing duties on US biodiesel. “This decision was taken on the basis of clear evidence that
unfair subsidization and dumping of US biodiesel
has taken place and that this is harming otherwise
competitive European industry with potentially
dire long-term effects,” it said.
The temporary duties will be in effect for 4
months and can be followed by definitive duties,
which normally last 5 years. An EC investigation
found that US biodiesel accounted for 17% of the
European market during April 2007-March 2008.

The oil and gas industry continues
to develop new technologies to explore
for, develop, and produce the energy
resources needed for growing global
demand. Speakers at the 40th Offshore
Technology Conference in Houston
May 4-7 highlighted these technologies against a backdrop of worldwide
economic uncertainty and changing governmental and environmental policies.

Despite oil prices hovering in the

Outer Continental Shelf at OTC May 5.
In prepared remarks, Gary P. Luquette, president of Chevron North

America Exploration & Production Co.,
said, “There are people in positions of
power that want the US to move off oil
as quickly as possible, and they want us
to pay for it through increased taxes and
fees.”
Luquette noted Obama’s “aggressive
agenda” that could drastically reduce
the industry’s ability to explore, develop, and produce oil and natural gas in
the US. He said, “This administration—
and for that matter, a large sector of the
population—think we must abandon
traditional oil and gas development
for the sake of the environment. This is
simply not true.”
Larry Nichols, chairman and chief
executive officer of Devon Energy
Corp., derided the myth that environmentally friendly and renewable energy
sources are imminent. He questioned
Obama’s goal of having renewable
energy resources provide 20% of US
energy production by 2030. Even the
Department of Energy’s estimate is for
only 11%.
Tim Cejka, president of ExxonMobil
Exploration Co., said in prepared remarks, “Oil and gas are indeed finite resources. And alternative energy sources,
such as wind, nuclear power, and biofuels, play an important and growing
role in meeting global energy needs.
But although oil and gas resources are
finite, they are far from finished.”
The US Geological Survey estimates
more than 3 trillion bbl of conventional
oil is ultimately recoverable worldwide.
On top of that are huge unconventional
resources such as heavy oil and shale
oil yet to be developed. By comparison,
an estimated 1 trillion bbl of crude has
been produced to date in all of human
history.
Based on surveys conducted by the
US Minerals Management Service, the
OCS holds an estimated 85 billion
bbl of recoverable oil and 419 tcf of
recoverable gas, with almost 18 billion
bbl of oil and 76 tcf of gas in the areas

less than one one-thousandth percent
of oil produced in federal waters has

that want to see oil and gas operations

them anything to work with.”
The oil executives emphasized their
industry repeatedly has proven over the
last 25 years it has the technical capability and procedures to minimize adverse
risks to the natural environment. “We
can operate in an environmentally
responsible manner and in a way that
accommodates joint use of federal lands
and waters for other activities,” Luquette said.
Cejka said, “To consumers of our
products, the importance of innovation
to the oil industry is often not readily
apparent. Gasoline may not appear as
technically sophisticated as many consumer electronic goods, for example.
But…technology is the lifeblood of our
industry. Technology infuses the entire
supply chain, from the producing reservoirs to the service station. If you just
walk around the exhibit floor here at
OTC, you can see the incredible depth
and breadth of the technology found in
the oil and gas industry.”
Major and independent producers
have long supported a sustained energy
policy that combines conservation and
development of alternative and renewable fuels along with expansion of
traditional energy sources such as oil
and gas.
Luquette defended the Deepwater
Royalties Relief Act (DWRRA) that has
been attacked as a mere subsidy to
offshore oil and gas producers. He said,
“Not only was DWRR a success, it was
a home run that revitalized production
from the Gulf of Mexico. It was passed
at a time of historically low crude oil
prices as a means to increase domestic production and sustain jobs in a
struggling industry.” Because DWRRA
provided near-term royalty relief for
long-term production, more than 3,000
leases were issued in 1996-2000 in wa-

delegates said May 4 during an OTC

The panelists, who represented
energy consumers, academia, oil companies, and government, debated the
challenges facing the energy industry
and its stakeholders.
Consumers, in particular, are underrepresented in the energy policy debate,
some delegates said, and with consumers worried about energy prices and
security, politicians are finding it difficult to build an overarching framework
for a comprehensive, balanced national
energy policy.

president of Green Strategies Inc.
Jack Gerard, president and chief
executive officer of the American Petroleum Institute, said it was important to
establish with the public the perceived
role that industry would play in supplying future energy resources. He said
consumers had failed to understand certain realities: For example, when polled,
67% of the public felt the nation’s energy problems could be solved through
conservation and energy efficiency, but
when consumers suffered $4/gal gasoline last year, their attitude changed.
After the gasoline price spike, 67% of
the public then called for development
of the country’s resources on the OCS.
“We don’t want the government to
pick winners and losers in the power
and fuel debate,” said Bill Graves, president of American Trucking Associations.
“We need to appreciate the complexity
of the transition to different fuels.”
Although there is increasing public pressure to move to renewables to
address climate change and sustainability, this alone will not fill the gap in
meeting energy demand, delegates said.
Different forms of energy are discussed
within vacuums, which ignores their
interconnectivity. Delegates agreed that
expanding US oil and gas production,
alternative energy, and nuclear power
were the necessary steps over the next 8
years to increase energy supplies.
Grumet said, “We’re in the midst
of a transition, and we all want to get
there, but the challenge is that we
don’t have a long-term goal articulated.
Climate change [mitigation] is a step in
the right direction, but people are not
sure what energy independence means;
what does the transition look like? We
need to identify goals to have productive dialogue.”

Oil ﬁrms’ long-term strategies
Oil and gas companies are becoming
more adept at maintaining long-term
business strategy in the face of shortterm uncertainty stemming from oil
price cycles, OTC panelists said May 4.
During a general session entitled

it affect major capital projects,” executives discussed cost-cutting measures
that include lowering capital budgets
and renegotiating contracts.
“We are getting better at going
through these cycles,” said Luc Messier,
ConocoPhillips senior vice-president.
“We must keep our options open as
far as assets and properties to develop.
We’ve adjusted our operational expenses to…remain competitive.”
Messier said current oil prices remind him of 2004 levels, but he noted
that operating costs have doubled since
2004. Consequently, ConocoPhillips
reduced drilling in the US Lower 48 as
well as Western Canada.
Matthias Bichsel, executive vicepresident of Royal Dutch Shell PLC, said
the company quietly renegotiated some
contracts with suppliers.
A presentation by Petroleo Brasilerio
SA (Petrobras) mentioned renegotiating 360 exploration and production
contracts. Solange Guedes, Petrobras
executive director, prepared the talk but
did not attend OTC. Cesar Palagi, Walker
Ridge production asset manager with
Petrobras America Inc. of Houston, was
a substitute speaker for Guedes.
Patrick Pouyanne, Total senior vicepresident of business development, said
Total’s solid balance sheet enables it to
sustain a long-term investment strategy
throughout price cycles.
“We want to avoid a stop-and-go
policy,” Pouyanne said in reference to
massive layoffs that the industry experienced during previous oil-price slumps.
“The basics of markets are changing,
but it does not affect long-term trends.”
Total is becoming increasingly more
internally cost disciplined as it controls
daily expenses, Pouyanne said. “We
have to continue to believe that cost
reduction will come from technology.”
Dominique de Soras of Technip’s
subsea division was the only panelists
representing an engineering firm. He
briefly discussed the cost evolution of
floating production, storage, and offloading vessels as well as subsea projects.
FPSO costs last year were twice as
high as in 2003, largely because of “es-

calating raw material” costs, De Soras
said. On subsea expenses, he attributed
cost increases “very much on the installation side.”
Technip remains committed to quality and continues to invest in research
and development, De Soras said. The
company boosted its payroll 34% during 2005-08, largely to hire young
engineers, he said.

Reforms in Nigeria
Nigeria’s operators are urging that
the major industry reforms proposed
under the country’s latest petroleum
industry bill to be quickly implemented
to ensure regulatory certainty.
Speaking May 5 at an OTC topical
lunch, Adewale Tinbu, group chief executive of Nigerian oil company Oando
PLC, told attendees: “The reforms are
good. We want to see more companies
like ours being involved in the process
as the focus tends to be on the international oil companies and national oil
companies.”
Nigeria announced plans in 2004 to
break up its national oil company, Nigeria National Petroleum Corp. (NNPC),
into smaller separate and autonomous
units to end its conflicting roles of
operator, regulator, and national assets
management. With aspirations to have a
similar model to Norway’s StatoilHydro
or Brazil’s Petroleo Brasilerio SA (Petrobras), a new, integrated IOC, Nigerian
National Petroleum Co. Ltd., will be
created. Currently, NNPC has been unable to contribute its share of funding
for joint venture projects as the government has not provided enough money.
Tinbu noted that NNPC should give
assets to local oil companies under the
reforms to help them develop. “We
want community relations to be improved in the delta and as a hangover, I
believe from colonialism, people look
at [IOCs] as ‘pseudogovernments.’ There
is a lack of local companies in the area,
and we need to see wealth transfer in
the area.”
Tinbu said Oando has struggled to
secure gas from IOCs in Nigeria for local distribution despite spending $300

million to build domestic pipelines and
called on them to allocate it as their
contribution to the country.
Faithful Abiyesorhu, NNPC group
executive director of engineering and
technology, urged industry players to
be patient with the restructuring. “We
hope to get it right. It will come with
pains and gains, but the pains will be
transient.”
Mark Ward, lead country manager of
ExxonMobil Corp. subsidiary companies in Nigeria, said that technology
transfer and developing local people
were important in its relationship with
NNPC. “We spend $1 billion/year on
[research and development] on technology,” he said. “We have done work
on 3D seismic; directional, horizontal,
and extended-reach drilling; subsea
technology; and multizone simulation.”
But during this downturn, it was critical to recognize that both parties had a
long-term relationship, he said, adding,
“National content must be realistic and
achievable. We have workforce development, supplier development, and
strategic community investment.”
Eyo Ekpo, special advisor on projects
in the Cross Rivers state, said it was crucial that the reform process was handled
efficiently. “The new agencies need
boundaries, resources, and capital and
we need to make sure that the reform is
not slowed down during the transition
process to keep away people who have
vested interests.”
Emmanuel Egbogah, special advisor
to the president on petroleum matters,
told delegates that public hearings are
scheduled for the petroleum industry
bill in May. The National Assembly has
passed the legislation in its first and
second hearings.
“The reform also provides for the
conversion of all the existing joint ventures into incorporation joint ventures
(IJVs). Each IJV will be a corporate entity to be incorporated under the laws of
Federal Republic of Nigeria,” Egbogah
said. “The incorporation process including capitalization and restructuring will
be carried out through negotiations
with the respective IOCs during the

reform transition period.”
Other highlights of the bill include
creation of the following:
• National Petroleum Directorate, a
policy body that will initiate, formulate,
and develop policy and be a secretariat
for the petroleum minister.
• National Petroleum Inspectorate,
an autonomous technical regulator that
will replace the Department of Petroleum Resources.
• National Petroleum Assets Management Agency, to manage petroleum
assets and commercial regulation of
the industry to ensure Nigeria derives
maximum value from its oil and gas
resources. (Will replace NAPIMS).
• Petroleum Products Regulatory
Authority, to focus on the commercial
downstream sector (Will replace PPPRA).
• A research and development center,
to focus on capacity-building.
• Petroleum Training Institute.
• Establishment of fund organizations, including Petroleum Equalization
Fund and Petroleum Technology Development Fund.
• Frontier Exploration Services, to
regulate and stimulate exploration in
frontier areas, including the Anambra,
Benue Trough, Bida, Chad, Dahomey,
and Sokoto basins.

reaching 8.27 bcfd in 2018.
MMS’s forecast depends on the successful development of announced and
undiscovered resources in the gulf.
The forecast shows a continued
decrease in shallow-water oil production, reaching 82,000 b/d in 2018
compared with 313,000 b/d in 2008.
Likewise, shallow-water gas production
decreases to 900 MMcfd in 2018 compared with 3.84 bcfd in 2008.
In 2008, oil and gas operators announced 15 deepwater discoveries in
the gulf and seven new projects started
production in water deeper than 1,000
ft (see table).
MMS also notes that in 2008, 57% of
all gulf leases were in water deeper than
1,000 ft and the gulf had 141 projects
producing from deepwater. Additionally,
73% of the tracts receiving bids in the
three lease sales held in 2008 were in
deepwater areas of the gulf.

The company has been particularly

of 35%. Oil recovery from the field is
expected to increase to 70% without

produces 5 million b/d of oil, he said.
“Horizontal wells and equalizers to

Natural gas development is also a
major issue in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom wants to boost gas processing

2015, which will meet local demand
and serve the petrochemicals industry.

OTC Spotlight on Technology recognizes 14 technologies
Guntis Moritis
Production Editor
The 2009 Offshore Technology Conference in its Spotlight on New Technology
awards recognized 14 innovations that
provide beneﬁts beyond existing technologies. To qualify for the award, companies have to have proved out the technology through either full-scale applications
or successful prototype testing.
Award recipients included:
• 2H Offshore for the INTEGRistick
dynamic curvature sensor to monitor the condition of deepwater subsea
structures.
• Schlumberger Ltd. for the subsea
subC-strip and subC-collar to monitor
the condition of subsea ﬂowlines.
• GE Oil & Gas Co. for the VetcoGray
SemStar5 subsea electronics module to
control subsea production.
• Baker Hughes Inc. for the TORXS
expandable liner hanger system.
• Baker Hughes for the Frac-Hook
multilateral system to facilite hydraulic
fracturing.
• Weatherford International Ltd.
for the OneTrip StarBurst multilateral
system.
• Cameron-Nautronix for the NASMUX acoustic system to control subsea
blowout preventers.
• Reelwell AS for the Reelwell Drilling Method (RDM) to facilitate managed pressure drilling.
• US Synthetic Bearings for poly-

Khurais is about 90 miles east of
Riyadh. The field will produce 1.2 million b/d and is the largest increment
delivered in the world, Nasser said.
“We have increased capacity by 20% by
bringing on major increments onstream
between 2004-09.” By yearend, Aramco
will have 12 million b/d of production
capacity after it has completed all of its
major development projects. Khurais,
in addition to the 1.2 million b/d, is
expected to produce 420 MMcfd of
26

crystalline diamond radial bearings for
installation in mud motors, turbines,
power generation, and rotary steerable
tools.
• Welltec AS for the Well Cleaner PST
power suction tool for cleaning sand
from wells.
• ProPure AS for the compact oneshot ProSalt mixer system, used in
desalting crude.
• Technip for the amplitude-LNG
loading system.
• Schlumberger’s WesternGeco unit
for coil shooting that acquires fullazimuth marine seismic data continuously with a circular geometry, using
one vessel.
• Specialized Products Co. for pulse
technology-battery maintenance, conditioning and charging.

Structure, ﬂowline
monitoring
Two awards went to technologies for
monitoring the state of offshore structures and ﬂowlines.
2H Offshore’s INTEGRistick dynamic
curvature sensor incorporates several
strain gauges inside a corrosion-resistant metal housing to measure biplanar
curvature changes to subsea structures
to a resolution of 1 μstrain, creep free.
The company says it can be used as
a standalone battery-powered unit or
as a permanent online system, such as
deployed on the Chevron Corp. Tahiti

natural gas and 70,000 b/d of condensate (OGJ, May 8, 2006, p. 19).
The project has been challenging
because during the boom period when
oil prices were soaring; there was a
shortage of labor and materials. Now,
however, the field will start production in a very different market with
oil prices in the $50/bbl range and
shrinking demand because of the global
recession.
Saudi officials have said Khurais,

steel-catenary-riser (SCR) monitoring
system.
Schlumberger’s subsea subC-strip
and subrC-collar is another technology
deployed on Chevron’s Tahiti project.
The 600-ft optical sensors continuously monitor the ﬂowline for buckle
shape, pipe axial, and hoop strain and
temperature, providing a picture of
buckle response to operational production cycles.
Data transfer is via a ﬁeld umbilical
using a low-power optical modem communication system to the topsides data
acquisition system.

Subsea production
control
One award went to VetcoGray, a GE
Oil & Gas Co., for its SemStar5, a subsea electronics module for controlling
subsea production. The SEM has an
open architecture IP enabled communication capabilities, a modular design,
and subsea plug-and-play capabilities.
The SEM supports industry-standard
interfaces SIIS 1-3 and IWIS as well as
full sensor interface capability.

Well completions
Three awards went to technologies
to facilitate well completions.
The Baker Hughes TORXS expandable liner hanger system has a variable-diameter swage and enables the
running tool to expand the liner hanger
before displacing cement. Expansion

with at least 12 billion bbl of recoverable oil, is only 1.8% depleted (OGJ,
Apr. 5, 2004, p. 18). This is the country’s
second-largest oil field and requires
310 wells to deliver the production. The
drilling program was expected to take 3
years, but was finished 10 months ahead
of schedule on Feb. 10 due to improvements in engineering and operations. It
will typically use single horizontal lateral
wells equipped with inflow control devices for water production management.

of the hanger does not reduce the system’s annular ﬂow area. Packer setting
occurs after displacing cement and is
not dependent on plug bump. The company says the liner hanger uses balanced hydraulics so that one can safely
rotate the liner and circulate down,
without risk of premature activations.
Baker Hughes’s other award was
for the Frac-Hook multilateral system
that allows operators to pinpoint the
placement of hydraulic fracturing jobs,
providing greater access and control of
laterals, according to the company.
Weatherford International Ltd.
received an award for its OneTrip StarBurst multilateral system, which the
company claims is the industry’s ﬁrst
one-trip Level 4 multilateral system.
It says the system because of the
faster installation time is particularly
well suited for wells in mature ﬁelds
with declining production rates.

Drilling
Four awards concerned drilling
technologies.
Cameron-Nautronix’s NASMUX
is an acoustic system for controlling
subsea blowout preventers (BOPs) and
is an alternative to multiplexed control
systems. The system replaces the command, control, and monitoring aspects
of a control umbilical with an acoustic
system that minimizes topsides equipment, the company says.
The Reelwell Drilling Method (RDM)
allows accurate pressure management
and improved well control through

Smart electrical submersible pumps also
will be installed.
Aramco originally planned to use 16
rigs run by three divisions over 3 years,
but this was changed to 12 rigs in two
divisions over a 2-year schedule. Drilling days were cut from 40 days to 25
days because of strong communication
between the company and its contractors and working alongside each other
in the same office.
In November 2008, Aramco inau-

closed loop ﬂuid circulation, making it
especially attractive for managed pressure drilling, according to Reelwell.
US Synthetic Bearings says its
diamond radial bearings lengthen the
bearing life of drilling mud motors
and turbines compared with tungsten
carbide or other hard metal bearings.
The company uses its patent process to
form and machine the polycrystalline
diamond pads.
These bearings are for bit bearing
applications such as in mud motors,
turbines, power generation, and rotary
steerable tools.
Welltec says its Well Cleaner PST
power suction tool is for cleaning out
sand from wells and can replace coiled
tubing or slickline bailer sand cleanouts
in high angle wells. The StatoilHydro
and Royal Dutch Shell Group sponsored technology, run on electric-line,
can lift sand into long bailer sections
and has a 1 tonne/run bailing capacity
compared with a 4-9 l./run capacity of
slickline bailers, the company says.

Processing
One award went to a new crude
desalting process.
ProPure AS’s compact one-shot ProSalt mixer system combines freshwater
injection and crude-fresh water mixing
by imposing a homogeneous shear
stress of the dispersed fresh-crude ﬂow.
The company says that this desalting process provides a homogeneous
freshwater droplet size distribution,
resulting in a more separable freshwa-

pumps increase the pressure at Ain Dar

the 60-in. Ain Dar Khurais-1 pipeline.

ter-crude mixture and correspondingly
better use of injected fresh water.

LNG
Technip received an award for its
amplitude-LNG loading system that
allows the transfer of LNG in dynamic
offshore conditions and involved the
development and qualiﬁcation of a
new heavy-duty cryogenic ﬂexible pipe
systems.
The company says the ﬂexible pipe
is the key component of the loading
system and expands the methods for
transfer of LNG in offshore and near
shore marine conditions.

Seismic
One award went to a seismic acquisition process. The WesternGeco coil
shooting method acquires full-azimuth
marine seismic data continuously with
a circular geometry with a single seismic vessel.
Coil Shooting enhances current
multi and wide-azimuth acquisition
techniques that are used in complex
geological areas, the company says.

Batteries
Specialized Products received an
award for its pulse technology-battery
maintenance, conditioning and charging that helps prevent battery failure
caused by battery plate sulfation and
related failure modes.
The company says that it has proved
that the technology extends battery life
by up to 5 times.

The Khurais project will use five WIP
trains that will inject 2.1 million b/d of
treated seawater into Khurais, Abu Jifan,
and Mazalij fields to maintain reservoir
pressure.
Discovered 65 miles west of supergiant Ghawar field in 1957, Khurais
began production in 1970 and had
yielded 111 million bbl by mid-1979,
when output averaged 33,000 b/d. It
was later shut in, and the project to
restart it began in 2005. ✦

House members revive
bill to expand OCS activity
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US House members who tried to
legislatively repeal offshore drilling
bans in previous sessions introduced a
bill on May 4 to restore a 5-year Outer
Continental Shelf plan, which US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has delayed.
Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) sponsored
the bill, HR 2227, with Neil Abercrombie (D-Ha.). Cosponsors are Shelley
Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Jim Costa
(D-Calif.), Joe Wilson (R-SC), Timothy
J. Walz (D-Minn.), and Lee Terry (RNeb.). It was immediately referred to
the Natural Resources Committee.
On Feb. 10 Salazar announced that
he would delay implementation for
6 months of a 5-year OCS plan for
2010-15 that his predecessor, Dirk A.
Kempthorne, had launched the previous summer in response to record retail
gasoline prices.

Iran’s trade
sanctions

US

trade sanctions have applied
to Iran since 1996. One goal
of denying that country’s national oil
company access to American goods,
services, and technology has been to
punish its government for allegedly
trying to gain nuclear weapons.
Several members of Congress now
want the US to be ready to turn up
the heat. They’ve introduced bills in
the House and Senate that would bar
foreign suppliers of refined products
to Iran from effectively doing business in the US.
HR 2194, which Rep. Howard L.
Berman (D-Calif.) introduced on Apr.
30, also would apply to any non-US
firm which finances, brokers, underwrites, or provides ships to help
Iran import refined products. It also
would apply to any foreign entity
that provides goods and services for
Iran’s refining industry.
The country’s limited refining
capacity makes it necessary for it
to import 25% of the products it
consumes, according to Berman,
who chairs the House Foreign Affairs
Committee. Without these imports,
much of the country’s economy
would grind to a halt, he said.

that could truly cripple the Iranian
economy,” he said.
Berman introduced his bill a day
after Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) introduced a similar measure on the other
side of the Capitol. Bayh said his bill,
S. 908, was designed to give Obama
another diplomatic tool to keep Iran
from getting nuclear weapons.
“This bill gives the president
the express authority to target the
regime’s Achilles heel,” said Minority Whip Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), one of
S. 908’s 24 Democratic and Republican cosponsors.

‘Give them a choice’

“We know who these companies
are (Shell, Vito, BP, and Reliance) and
we need to give them a choice: You
can do business with Iran’s $250
billion economy or our $13 trillion
economy, but not both,” Kyl said.
On May 1, Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for
Defense of Democracies in Washington, said the bills sent a strong
message that Iran’s nuclear weapons
program won’t be tolerated.

newable energy sources. He ordered the
US Geological Survey and US Minerals Management Service to prepare an
evaluation of US offshore conventional
and alternative resource potential, and
held four public meetings to receive additional comments.
HR 2227’s proposed offshore leasing
provisions also provide jurisdiction for
state royalty payments over a wider area
by extending coastal states’ boundaries to
a uniform 12 miles from 3 miles. It also
would repeal the 125-mile moratorium
on oil and gas production in the eastern
Gulf of Mexico, establish an expedited inventory of offshore energy resources, and
mandate procedures to expedite judicial
reviews of oil and gas leases.

Other provisions
The bill also would prohibit surface
occupancy within 10 miles of the shoreline and permanent surface occupancy
within 20 miles. It would open offshore
resources 20 miles and further out, and
mandate mitigation of offshore facilities
on coastal vistas. It would mandate federal agency coordination with adjacent
states on construction of pipelines to
move oil and gas from the OCS. Interior
also would have to coordinate leasing
with the US Department of Defense and
refer any unresolved issues to the president for an immediate decision.

T E R E S T
The bill also contains provisions to
share OCS oil and gas revenues, including 30% to states directly affected
by activity, 20% to pay for alternative
energy and conservation tax incentives,
10% for clean coal technology development, 10% for environmental restoration, 10% for the general federal treasury, 8% for conservation programs, 5%
for carbon-free technology including
nuclear power, 5% for water programs,
and 2% for low-income home energy
assistance.
The bill’s second title would modify
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to
reflect current refining capabilities by
exchanging 70 million bbl, or 10% of
its content, and dedicating the projected
$400 million of proceeds to existing
conservation, assistance, and energy
research and development programs.
The bill’s third title would extend
alternative and renewable energy tax
credits to 2019, while its fourth title
would encourage development of
electric-powered motor vehicles.
The bill’s sponsors, Murphy and Abercrombie, said they met regularly with
other cosponsors over several weeks
to develop a comprehensive energy
bill. “This legislation will be paid for:
developing our own resource will bring
an estimated $2.2-3.7 trillion in federal
revenue,” he said on May 5.

‘Begin the path’
“With this bill, we truly begin the
path toward a clean-energy future by
investing in clean energy, creating US
jobs immediately and long into the future, and cleaning the environment, all
without raising taxes,” Murphy said.
Wilson said the bill was particularly
important to South Carolina because
it contains provisions to expand and
develop nuclear power. Additionally,
a sizable portion of the royalties and
revenues garnered from offshore oil and
natural gas exploration will be returned
to the coastal states; and the tourism
and hospitality industry that is so vital
to coastal communities will not be
adversely affected because all offshore
activity will take place far beyond the
line of sight, he said.
American Petroleum Institute Pres.
Jack N. Gerard reacted favorably to the
bill’s introduction, calling it a step in
the right direction.
“This bipartisan bill recognizes the
importance of increased access to offshore oil and natural gas resources not
only to our nation’s economy, in terms
of generating federal, state, and local
revenues and new well-paying jobs, but
also to America’s energy security,” he
said. ✦

for the Brazilian state of Rio Grande
do Norte, said Brazil’s model for the
development and marketing of traditional hydrocarbons will be “completely different from that of traditional
oil exporters, like the Arab countries or
Venezuela.
“It will be a model oriented toward
domestic consumption, to satisfy our
energy needs first, and then export the
surplus. And it will still generate wealth
for the country,” Prates told IPS.

Renewable energy
In addition to traditional hydrocarbons, the government of President
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will invest
more heavily in other renewable energy
sources including biodiesel and ethanol
made from sugarcane.
The Sugarcane Industry Association
(UNICA) reports 46% of the Brazilian
energy mix already is based on renewable sources. Ethanol accounts for 16%.
In Brazil, 90% of new vehicles have
flex-fuel engines that can run on gasoline and ethanol. New vehicles account
for 25% of all cars in the country.
UNICA reports this has cut Brazil’s
emissions of carbon dioxide, the main
greenhouse gas, by 50 million tonnes
since 2003.

Ethanol production
UNICA’s promotion of ethanol, however, has drawn criticism from those
concerned about competition between
planting crops for energy or food.
Others question the benefits of
biofuels for the environment. The International Council for Science (ICSU)
reported that biofuel production may
even increase, rather than decrease,
global warming.
ICSU said the process of farming
crops like sugarcane in Brazil and corn
in the US releases amounts of nitrous
oxide, another greenhouse gas, that
more than counteract the benefit of
lowering emissions of CO2 generated by
burning ethanol instead of gasoline.

the interests of his province’s oil

He’s right to do so, given Alberta’s
parlous state of employment.
Alberta is experiencing enormous
layoffs province-wide as the development of new supplies of oil and
gas—conventional and oil sands—all
but grinds to a halt, according to a
recent report by the Calgary Herald.
“Thousands of oil field workers
have lost their jobs and most of the
survivors are taking pay cuts to sustain theirs,” the paper said, adding,
“Many of the smaller drilling, service,
and oil companies are experiencing
severe financial difficulty.”
Not surprisingly, the Calgary newspaper asked a highly pertinent question:
“What will Ed Stelmach’s response be to
Alberta’s economic meltdown?”
Well, one of his responses—and
he may well have others we don’t

interests with our international partners—but during these challenging
economic times it’s not only important, it’s vital,” the premier said.
On May 4, Stelmach delivered
the keynote address at the Alberta
Economic Forum in Geneva, telling
his audience that his province “has
the good fortune to be sitting on a
tremendous energy treasure.”
Stelmach referred to the oil sands
of Northeast Alberta, which “contain
proven reserves of more than 173 billion bbl of oil” and could hold “as much
as 334 billion bbl” of recoverable oil.

Commitment and expertise

Not least, Stelmach said, “We have
the commitment and expertise to
ensure that Alberta energy is clean

manner and employing the best science and technology available.”
Stelmach also carried that message

1% of the land suitable for agriculture

Petrobras has three new biodiesel
plants and plans to produce 640 million
l./year by 2013. Including ethanol, the
company plans to spend $2.8 billion on
biofuels up to 2013.
Gabrielli said it’s important to increase exports to make Brazil one of the
top players in the world ethanol market.
“Forty years of experience with
ethanol in this country shows that this

biofuel is not a threat to food security;
on the contrary, food production has
increased,” Gabrielli told IPS.
Production capacity on land “appropriate for ethanol cultivation” has
increased, and labor conditions for sugarcane workers have improved, Gabrielli
said. “We believe it is possible to increase
production of crops for biofuels in
degraded areas, on land that is not being

Scotland identiﬁes potential UK North Sea CCS sites
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
The UK North Sea could hold millions of tonnes of carbon emissions in
saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas
fields, but government must support
carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology development, a report said.
The report, entitled Opportunities
for Carbon Dioxide Storage Around
Scotland, was prepared by the Scottish
Centre for Carbon Storage, the Scottish
government, and industry partners.
Similar reports have been prepared by
others for regions elsewhere around the
world.
Scotland could play a pivotal role
in the CCS sector with the creation of
10,000 jobs, and the CO2 storage capacity is comparable with Norway and
greater than the Netherlands, Denmark,
and Germany combined, the study said.
It found industrial emissions, including those from electric power plants,
could be injected into the northern and
central North Sea, opening storage op-

tions for continental Europe. The report
mentioned 10 saline aquifers and 29
hydrocarbon fields.
More than 90% of storage capacity lies within large saline aquifers
positioned at several different levels
and typically 1-3 km deep beneath the
seabed, and often close to oil and gas
fields.
Pressure is growing on member states
to meet the European Union’s requirement that by 2015 there are 12 demonstration sites with CCS on full-sized
electric power plants. The next steps
involve more detailed mapping and
evaluation of specific saline aquifers.

Industry response
Experts say it is unlikely that CCS
technology would be developed unless
it was supported by the government.
Cost estimates range from £750 million
to more than £1 billion.
Utility company Scottish Power
hopes to start capturing carbon within
5 years in Scotland. E.On UK plans to
build a £1.5 billion coal-fired electric

power station at Kingsnorth, Kent—the
first in the country in more than 30
years.
Paul Golby, chief executive of E.On
UK, said the company was committed
to fit capture technology at the plant as
long as it was properly funded. E.On
hopes to send CO2 to Hewett gas field
in the southern North Sea by pipeline
and is looking at different routes.
E.On proposes several fossil-fired
electric power stations and other industrial sites be linked to the same carbon
transportation system.
Jeff Chapman, chief executive of the
Carbon Capture and Storage Association,
urged government to move quickly
if it wants the UK to be a pioneer. He
said government must ensure that any
funding mechanism is sustainable for
long-term technology development.
The UK launched a competition
in 2007 to support a CCS demonstration. The winner is expected to be
announced at midyear. Contenders
are E.On UK, Peel Power, and Scottish
Power. ✦

UK chancellor offers incentives for challenging ﬁelds
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Operators focused on small and
challenging projects in the UK North
Sea that are offered investment incentives by Chancellor Alastair Darling in
his 2009 budget to unlock 2 billion bbl
and enhance indigenous production.
As oil prices have fallen from $147/
bbl last July to a range around $50/bbl

today, Darling has come under intense
pressure to offer tax breaks to the industry. Recently published data by Deloitte
LLP showed there was a 78% fall in exploration drilling in this year’s first quarter
compared with a year ago due to low oil
prices, high costs, and financing difficulties. According to Deloitte, the government’s tax receipts from the North Sea is
expected to almost halve in 2009-10.
Darling will introduce a new “field

allowance” to offset against the supplementary charge (reducing the tax rate
to 30% from 50%) whereby operators
would have a variable limit on tax-free
income, with anything above that limit
to be taxed. This measure would apply to
small, and high-pressure, high-temperature, and heavy-oil fields that now can be
economically developed at low oil prices.
It is effective for qualifying fields given
development consent on or after Apr. 22.

Jim Hannon, managing director of
North Sea consultancy firm Hannon
Westwood LLP, said the proposal has the
“potential not only to sustain drilling
on the current stock of over 300 discoveries but would have an indirect benefit
on exploration drilling.” Even if oil
prices increase in the coming months,
Hannon claimed the “field allowance
scheme remained valid and capable of
driving a more sustained level of investment, particularly so in a competitive
world of oil and gas exploration, in
which the UK has to maintain its attractiveness.”
Highlights of the budget for UK
North Sea operators included:
• Removing any income from
change-of-use activities from the scope
of the petroleum revenue tax and allowing relief against corporation tax and the
petroleum revenue tax for decommissioning costs for change-of-use assets.
• Capital allowances available for
cushion gas in gas storage projects.
• Chargeable gains on North Sea
asset disposals to be exempt if proceeds
are reinvested in the UKCS or licenses
of the same value are swapped, effective
from Apr. 22.
• Measures to reduce the administrative burden of the petroleum revenue
tax and repeal of obsolete associated
legislation.

Responses
KPMG said the tax changes will
provide incentives to change the use of
fields and provide for capital gains on
license swap deals. But it raised concerns about the modified decommissioning rules where Darling pledged to
“...ensure companies cannot access tax
relief for decommissioning oil and gas
infrastructure years in advance of the
decommissioning actually being carried
out.” This approach is to stop tax avoidance schemes.
Derrick Parkes, an energy tax partner with KPMG, said: “Other detailed
changes regarding change of use of existing field assets, capital gains on license
swaps, and sales provide welcome clarity
and relief, but the countering of arrange34

T E R E S T
ments to advance North Sea decommissioning relief will disappoint some.”
Andrew Ogram, oil and gas tax
partner at Deloitte, said although the
announcements were welcome, the
chancellor missed the opportunity to
introduce additional incentives for exploration in the UK given the low prices
and declining exploration activity.
Meanwhile, trade association Oil
& Gas UK (OGUK), which has been
lobbying for tax changes to stimulate
investment, cautiously welcomed the
package (OGJ Online, Apr. 23, 2009).
Malcolm Webb, OGUK chief executive, said the measures were a positive
step for those companies trying to
develop small and challenging fields
in this mature, high-cost province.
“However, we now need to direct our
attention to sustaining and promoting investment in and around many of
our older fields to prolong their lives,
to stimulating exploration activity and
to opening up the frontier areas west
of Shetland and in that regard, we
welcome the government’s offer of a
continued dialogue.”
But OGUK was disappointed that
there was no improvement for small
companies to access equity markets,
which is making it nearly impossible
for them to continue exploration.
The government plans discussions
with the industry to ensure the fiscal
regime is attractive for the future of the
UK North Sea. Full details on minor
amendments in the budget will be
explained in the finance bill, which was
published on Apr. 27.

Environment issues
Darling has committed the UK to
cutting carbon emissions by 34% by
2020 and offered £1.4 billion to address climate change by supporting
low-carbon industries.
Darling wants the North Sea to become a hub for energy of the future—
gas storage, carbon capture, and
offshore wind. He proposes to achieve
this by removing fiscal barriers and offering £405 million of new funding for
low carbon energy and advanced green

manufacturing in Britain—to drive
the application of new technology and
invest in small scale projects.
Some environmental and business
groups dismissed the package as not
going far enough to combat climate
change. Adrian Wilkes, chief executive of the Environmental Industries
Commission, which represents 200
environmental technology and services
companies, said the budget “was timid
and inadequate.”
Friends of the Earth’s director Andy
Atkins said the targets were too weak to
enable the UK to play its part in avoiding
dangerous climate change. It is calling
upon rich nations to cut their emissions
40% by 2020 through action at home,
not offsetting: “The government has
squandered a historic opportunity to
kick-start a green industrial revolution
and slash UK carbon dioxide emissions.”
The chancellor announced support
for as many as four demonstration carbon capture and storage projects instead
of one. He has dedicated £90 million to
pay for more research into the technology, with the European Commission
likely to fund demonstration sites and
a “new funding mechanism,” Darling
said. This is expected to be a levy on
consumers’ bills.
Analysts welcomed the support but
warned that the government should
not delay its selection of winners for
the funding. Otherwise, other countries
such as Germany and China would have
a head start and create jobs in the sector.
Key questions remain on how quickly
and efficiently this funding can be made
available and the conditions to secure it.
Public borrowing in the UK is to increase to £175 billion this year alone, and
Darling said that he expected the economy to shrink by 3.5%. But business and
economic commentators have criticized
as “optimistic” his forecast of 1.25% on
economic growth in 2010 and 3.5%/year
of annual growth from 2011. This was
because figures revealed on Apr. 24 that
there was a 1.9% fall in GDP in the first
quarter of this year. This was worse than
analysts expected: in the fourth quarter of
2008, there was a 1.6% decline. ✦

Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. said that
new oil and gas regulations would
allow the industry to grow in a sustainable way compatible with the state’s
economy as he signed them into law on
Apr. 22. Producers remain concerned
that the rules will simply create more
delays and expenses.
“These rules were shaped with valuable input from people all across the
state and unanimously adopted by
the Colorado Oil
& Gas Conservation Commission
[COGCC]. They

industry and the importance of healthy

“In 1999, Colorado issued 1,000
drilling permits. Last year, the state
issued more than 8,000. These new,
modern rules recognize this increase in
drilling activity as well as the technological changes that have occurred
within the industry over the

Energy,” he said.
The regulations took effect May 1 on
federal lands and began to apply Apr. 1
on all other lands in the state.
Several producers with operations
in the state did not want to comment
for attribution. “We’ve handed this off
to the Colorado Oil & Gas Association
[COGA] because we’re going to have
work under these new rules. I could
speak for a good half hour if this was

might be more comfortable to Louisiana or Texas,” said Nate Strauch, COGA
communications coordinator.

‘Second bite of the apple’
Strauch said, “Colorado’s permitting
already takes longer than the national
average.
“Under the new rules, after the
permit has been approved, different
entities can come in and challenge the
action. Surface owners can come in and
second-guess the decision. So can the
Department of Public Health and the
Division of Wildlife. This gives them
a second bite of the apple after being
involved in the process already if they
don’t like the results,” he told OGJ.
Strauch and Jack Ekstrom, a COGA
board member, separately expressed
concern about the new regulations’
impacts on smaller producers.
“The investment in compliance
involves whether you can afford to do
it. The delays and difficulties in getting
a rig and having to restart the clock because of some minor hiccup remain to
be seen,” said Ekstrom, who is executive director of investor relations and
corporate communications at Whiting
Petroleum Corp., Denver.
“You probably won’t see evidence
during this downturn because there are
plenty of rigs available. But once there’s
an uptick, a company’s difficulty in timing and contracting for services may be
complicated by having to wait or stand
by if it hasn’t jumped through all the
hoops perfectly,” he said.
COGCC Director Dave Neslin said the
agency received a wide range of input
as the regulations were developed.
“We incorporated a lot of input from
both large and small operators, and we
will continue to work with operators
to help them comply successfully with
these requirements,” he said.
“We intend to implement these
changes in a reasonable and responsible
manner. If there are issues we didn’t
anticipate or if further changes are
needed, the commission will consider

Downhole chemicals
The new regulations contain several
significant provisions. Under Section
205, operators will be required to
keep an inventory by wellsite of each
chemical used downhole or stored for
use downhole during drilling, completion, and workover operations, including fracture stimulation, in an amount
exceeding 500 lb during any quarterly
reporting period. They also will maintain an inventory of fuel stored at the
well site in an amount exceeding 500 lb
in a quarter.
When the composition of a chemical
product is considered a trade secret by
its vendor, operators will be required
only to maintain the product’s identity.
The vendor or service provider will be
required to supply COGCC with a list of
a trade secret chemical product’s ingredients when the commission’s director
notifies them in writing that the information is necessary to respond to a spill
or release, or a property owner registers
a complaint about such a release.
COGCC’s director or designee may
disclose such information to other staff
members, but only to the extent that it
is necessary for spill response assistance.
The director also may disclose this
information to relevant county public
health directors or emergency managers, and the Colorado Department
of Public Health and Environment’s
environmental programs director.
These individuals may then share this
information with staff members under
similar terms.
Vendors or service providers will also
be required to provide a trade secret

request, also executes a confidentiality

This concluding part of a two-part
series of articles discusses the scenarios
and their results.
Part 1 (OGJ, May 4, 2009, p. 58)
covered the software components of
the optimization process that includes
a library of well models (PROSPER),
steady-state field model and optimizer
(HYSYS), Excel applications (TFO interface), a data historian (PI), and a BPTT
proprietary database (MIRS).
BPTT currently has 11 offshore
production platforms feeding into three
offshore gas and condensate processing
hubs with a 3.75-bscfd capacity.
Four gas pipelines with a
3.525-bscfd combined capacity and
one liquid pipeline link the offshore
platforms to Trinidad’s east coast.
BPTT has contracts for supplying
2.7-bscfd natural gas to National Gas
Co. of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC) and
to the Liquefied Natural Gas Co. (Atlantic LNG).

reasons, the process transforms the

expressions that relate gas flow rate
with wellhead pressure. This involves
the running of case studies with each

are valid operating scenarios, and in
fact a field optimizer will demonstrate
its value by providing fast and reliable
answers on how to operate under those
circumstances.
Equipment mechanical degradation
is another factor that will affect operations. One cannot model this factor
with enough rigor with first-principle
engineering models.
For these reasons, equipment models
typically include ad hoc adjustable parameters that one can tune to match the
actual process performance. The design
assumes that these parameters are fixed
over a wide range of operating conditions. First-principle model equations
continue being valid, but the model
results are shifted with an offset calculation to mirror reality.
The values of these calibration factors have themselves an intrinsic value,
as they indicate how far the operation is
from the physical principles that govern
its behavior. An oscillatory pressure
drop offset in a gas pipeline may indicate the presence of significant pipeline
dynamic effects.
In a gas operation such as BPTT’s, the
system hydraulics governed by the gas
transportation network from offshore
to the coast line and to the processing
terminals onshore have a major influ40

ence in the operation of the individual
platforms as well as in the overall operating margins.
The design takes special care in modeling the pipe networks as accurately
as possible and in providing calibration mechanisms that can adjust those
models to reflect actual system pressure
drops in most scenarios. Fig. 3 shows
the model’s adjustable parameters for
calibration.
The modeling of the pipeline segments used the Aspen HYSYS built-in
pressure drop correlation. The process
designers compared and checked these
results against field data extracted for
prolonged periods of time-on-stream.
They used this information to develop
empirical models that best fit all data.
Each pipeline model has an offset factor
that allows fine-tuning of predictions to
match actual pipeline pressure readings.
Fig. 4 shows a model’s predictions
(black) vs. field data for a main gas
pipeline in two different operating situations.
The steady-state field model and optimizer (TFOM) automatically calculates
all pipe pressure drop offsets together
with other process tuning factors during a calibration step to match field
data with the minimal degree of model
adjustment.

Pipeline tuning factor values were
calculated at relatively different sets of
actual process conditions during the
testing phase, and important discrepancies were not observed. This indicates
that the modeling and calibration approaches employed allow a correct representation of reality within the allowed
operating envelopes.

Optimization
As discussed in Part 1, the BPTT gas
system operation is constrained and
driven by the need of producing the gas
quantities contracted with the various
gas consumers. Gas deliverability is
therefore the key element for BPTT. A
multitude of engineering and commercial issues positively or negatively
affects deliverability, such as:
• Maintenance activities in platforms.
• Well testing.
• Pipelines pigging.
• Valve failures in pipes.
• Renegotiation of transportation
contracts.
• Availability of new gas transportation routes.
The common factor of all these
situations is that the asset must keep
gas deliverability at required levels in

the best possible way with the available
system capacity, as well as to react to
unexpected events to recover normal
production as quickly as possible.
The TFO is a:
• A day-to-day optimizer to guide
the operation towards the most profitable way, for example, delivering
required gas flow rates while getting
the most value out of the associated
condensate streams.
• As a what-if optimization system
that allows finding the optimum operating strategies when major events occur.
To do so, the HYSYS optimizer’s
configuration has enough flexibility to
allow operators to specify well status
on or off, well pressure and flow rate
limits, fixed and swing wells, pipeline
availability, and separation equipment
availability.
The optimizer also allows for defining the market and commercial information (gas nominations for each
consumer, gas values), and the optimization target among a set of preconfigured scenarios.
The set of business scenarios that
TFO can execute include:
• Meeting gas nominations while
maximizing condensates recovery.
• Finding the maximum attainable
operation revenue.
• Finding the maximum attainable
gas production.
• Maximizing the value obtained
from gas.
• Maximizing the condensates
recovery.
• Finding the maximum attainable
LNG gas production.
• Finding the maximum attainable
gas production for domestic consumption.
Fig. 5 shows the TFO results page that
compares field values with optimum set
points.
This provides a great level of flexibility to the tool and allows it to address
virtually all business concerns and questions that the asset typically faces. It also
provides a solid engineering baseline to

is its ability quickly to spot the areas of
the production system where it deviates from the governing engineering
principles.
The TFO was used to analyze several
real operational scenarios that included:
• Meeting gas demands while maximizing condensates production.
• Unplanned shutdowns of Atlantic
LNG trains and optimum strategies to
best accommodate the operation to a
lower gas demand situation.
• Planned shutdowns of Kapok
and Mango wells and the effect on gas
deliverability.
• Bringing on a new high yield
well, such as in Mango or in Cashima,
and analyzing the extra gas production
potential.
• Analyzing the extra gas production
attained with the Cassia-B Immortelle
bypass.
• Simulating a pig blockage of the
40-in. subsea pipeline and its impact on
overall gas deliverability.
• Effect of capacity restriction in the
12-in. condensate line on meeting gas
market demand.
• Maximum gas deliverability as a
function of Atlantic LNG terminal pressure requirements.

Typical use scenario
The main objective of TFO is in
helping to meet gas market demands
with the maximum associated condensates revenue.
In the most common optimization scenario, the TFO is configured
to produce a given set of gas volumes
for delivery to multiple gas consumers.
The model is first initialized with actual
field data, which includes factors such
as wellhead pressures, platform pressures, pipeline flows, separator temperatures and pressures, among others.
Upon checking the accuracy of
model predictions vs. actual field data
or validating the model, the TFO runs
will serve to find alternatives for improving how the gas nominations were
met during that particular day. TFO will
find the optimal gas production distribution among available fixed and swing
wells, taking into account the quality
and capacity constraints affecting the
associated condensate production as
well as the back-pressure effects on the
gas transportation network that make
the operation of the various offshore
platforms interdependent.
Preliminary results indicate a potential of 7% more condensate production,
equivalent to 1,900 bo/d.

• Having high-level management
support.
• Willingness of production engineers and gas dispatchers to adopt it as
way for improving existing operating
procedures.
BPTT fully endorses both and has set
up the necessary frameworks to embed
TFO into the production optimization
team processes.
Field trial experiments will be used
to benchmark the TFO results before the
tool is transferred to the gas dispatch
team as a control room application.

Using an oblique

pipeline construction can
protect the environment,
overcome difficulties
related to slope stability,
Pipelines

costs. Based on slope
stability analysis, this article will present a new method to determine design
parameters for
oblique
shafts
traversing soil
slopes, establishing
all designed parameters for an inclined
shaft crossing a simple homogeneous
slope and discussing design parameters
for a complex slope.
Cases will show that the new design
method is practical and concise and will
allow the inclined shaft to avoid the
most dangerous sliding zone of a gully
or slope during the design phase and
for excavation to occur without obvious impact on slope stability. The design
method could effectively avoid the
stress concentration of pipelines caused
by landslides.
The China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Corp. has widely used inclined
shaft crossings and their parameter

the second West-East natural gas pipeline, currently under construction.

Background
Long-distance oil and gas pipelines in China often cross through
loess gullies, loess plateaus, and other
complicated and varied topographies.1
The Lan-Zheng-Chang pipeline is the
longest oil line in China and has more
than 40 slopes just in the 97.4-km
section in Zhengzhou district, Henan
province.
Conventional burial in a loess slope
environment destroys sensitive surface
vegetation and causes soil erosion of
the slope. Conventional burial in a loess
slope is also prone to landslides, requiring advanced monitoring and integrity
measures (OGJ, May 21, 2001, p. 62,
and Feb. 17, 1986, p. 68). Even with
such measures, however, landslides still
cause heavy losses in loess slope environments engineering.
Contractors often use directional
drilling to traverse high, steep slopes,
but using this method in loess areas
depends on topography and geological
conditions. Drilling fluid can leak along
cracks to the slope surface and unexpected releases of drilling mud can also
damage the environment. Loess soil’s
sensitivity to water can collapse the
loess and reduces the stability of slopes
or gullies.
A manually excavated oblique shaft
can address these issues while gradually crossing large and medium-sized

Finished pipe slides into the
shaft entrance once excavation
is complete (Fig. 2).

Examples
The inclined shaft
crossing method
traversed 105 slopes
and gullies in the
11th, 12th, and
13th sections of the
Lan-Zheng-Chang oil transport pipeline
in Henan province. The longest inclined
shaft length measured 140 m. Two
slopes crossed illustrate the parameter
design method of the inclined shaft.
Table 1 shows the slope geometry
and mechanical parameters7 of the two
slopes, with analysis results shown in
Fig. 5 and Table 2 for an inclined-shaft
cross section height of 1.5 m.
Because the cross-section height,
h, of the inclined shaft is 1.5 m, the
vertical distance hv between the inclined
shaft exit and slope toe can be determined as 3.0 m (>(3~5)h/2). Keeping
the inclined shaft route osculate with
the critical surface allows calculation

of the inclined shaft’s position and the
horizontal distance, hs, between the
inclined shaft and slope toe.
The slope’s safety factors are close
to 1.0, which is in a limit equilibrium
state. The inclined pipeline shaft must
therefore lie outside the potential sliding surface, and its design parameters
should be adjusted with Equation 7. The
safety distance between wellhead and
slope shoulder increases by hv m, and
the inclined shaft overall moves parallel
to the stable soil in hv m.
Verifying the rationality of the acquired design parameters used numerical simulation analysis on Slope 1 for

inclined shaft traversing engineering.
The Duncan-Chang model reasonably reflects the non-linear deformation characteristics of soil masses.9 The
Mohr-Coulomb reflects the yield degree
of soil mass (Equation 8).
The limit designing dip angle of
the inclined shaft measures 34°; other
design parameters are shown in Table 2.
The geometry model is fixed at the base
and horizontal direction of the lateral
face. Table 3 lists the main physical and
mechanical parameter domains of the
loess soil in the numerical simulations.
Fig. 6 shows the yield distribution of
the slope after the inclined shaft crossing. The pipeline well lays safely outside

New telemetry platform
The new Orion II telemetry platform

enables reliable communication with bottomhole assemblies whether drilling at
high penetration rates or longer boreholes.
With Orion II, more quality data and
higher resolution images can be transmitted, at greater depths, enabling better drilling decisions to be made in real time, the
company notes.
The new generation telemetry platform
combines new data compression technology housed in the measurement-whiledrilling/logging-while-drilling tool with
new surface and downhole sensors that
modulate and demodulate signals and
overcome interference from drilling and
rig noise, even in harsh environments.
Downlink commands are sent in real time
while drilling without affecting delivery of
measurement data to surface.

This holeopening solution
promises to eliminate chronic reamer problems. The reamer
remains closed until triggered, opens on
command, reams an in-gauge hole, and
closes and comes out of the hole properly.
With the pilot bit design synchronized to
the expandable reamer in a fit-for-purpose
drilling assembly, operators are achieving
an exceptional downhole operating environment, the company says. The patented
drop-ball method triggers an expandable
reamer, eliminating premature triggering

‘Pollutant’s’ new
meaning threatens
hydrogen vehicles
If applied consistently, the logic that
treats carbon dioxide as air pollution would
end whatever hope remains for hydrogenpowered vehicles.
Last month the US Environmental Protection Agency proposed to ﬁnd that CO2
and ﬁve other greenhouse gases contribute
to air pollution and might endanger public
health or welfare.
The agency acted under a 2007 Su-

T h e

preme Court ruling that greenhouse gases
ﬁt the Clean Air Act’s deﬁnition of “pollutant.” It didn’t matter that CO2 governs
breathing of animals and sustains plants,
among other things.
The ruling addressed legal wording, not
scientiﬁc questions about human inﬂuence on global average temperature. But it
means that if EPA makes an endangerment
ﬁnding, the agency has to regulate emissions of them from motor vehicles.
So a gas essential to life plus methane,
nitrous oxide, hydroﬂuorocarbons, perﬂuorocarbons, and sulfur hexaﬂuoride are “pollutants” by court order because they are
greenhouse gases, regardless of the degree
to which human emissions of them may
have contributed to the uneven warming
observed over the past 150 years.
By extension, this contortion of the
meaning of “pollutant” bodes ill for hydrogen as a vehicle fuel.
The administration of former President
George W. Bush feverishly promoted hydrogen as a vehicle fuel in direct combustion or through use as the energy carrier in
onboard fuel cells.
Since then, hydrogen seems to have
fallen from favor, partly for technical reasons overlooked in the initial hubbub but
also because biofuels have broader political
support.
But the initial appeal was strong. Hydrogen was said to be a zero-pollution vehicle
fuel. Its combustion emits only water.
But wait: Water vapor’s greenhouse inﬂuence is far stronger than CO2’s. Especially
if the rise in global average temperature
resumes after an apparent 10-year pause,
more water in the environment should
mean more water vapor in the atmosphere
and hence more warming.
By the legal reasoning of the day, blind
as it is to technicalities such as how much
extra water vapor is really at stake here,
that’s pollution. If CO2 endangers life, water
vapor must do so many times over.
A ban on hydrogen-powered vehicles
thus seems only logical.

Possible shift in gas fundamentals
Analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC in New Orleans reported a pending shift
in the bearish fundamentals of the natural gas market with US production expected
to drop because of a 57% decline in the US rig count and sizeable production shutins so far this year.
The US rig count was down to 955 rigs as of May 1. “The net declines have
decelerated from 38 rigs 4 weeks ago to 30, 20, and 10 rigs over the past 3 weeks,”
Raymond James analysts said on May 4. “Since the 2,031 rig peak in early September, the rig count has been cut by 53%, or 1,086 rigs. The 53% rig count decline after
the ﬁrst 33 weeks since the peak in the 2008-09 cycle compares to a 42% drop in
the 1983 cycle, a 15% fall in the 1997-98 cycle, and a 40% retracement in the 2001-02
cycle.”
The June gas contract jumped 5.1% to $3.55/MMbtu on May 1 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, far outstripping combined losses from the previous two sessions. The price increase was stimulated by the Institute for Supply Management,
a trade group of purchasing executives, whose manufacturing index rose to 40.1
in April from 36.3 in March. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction, and this
marked the 15th consecutive month of contractions in manufacturing. However, the
pace in April was slower than expected due to a rise in new orders. The private trade
group’s ﬁgures suggested the economic decline may be moderating, analysts said.
Crude outlook
Meanwhile, US crude inventories were at all-time highs while oil demand
remained depressed, down 5.4% from year-ago levels in February. In Houston,
analysts at Raymond James & Associates Inc. said oil production among members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries apparently peaked in the ﬁrst
quarter of 2008, with non-OPEC production having topped out in 2007.
“Of course, we cannot deﬁnitively prove that this marks the all-time peak (that
is, that global oil production will never again surpass the 79.3 million b/d mark),”
the analysts conceded. “That is something that will only become clear with the
beneﬁt of years of hindsight as was the case with the US in the 1970s. However,
it is entirely intuitive to conclude that if both OPEC and non-OPEC production
posted declines against the backdrop of $100/bbl oil—when the obvious economic
incentive was to pump at full blast—those declines had to have come for involuntary reasons such as the inherent geological limits of oil ﬁelds. To summarize, we
believe that the oil market has already crossed over to the downward-sloping side
of Hubbert’s Peak [based on the production curve model developed by geophysicist M. King Hubbert].”
Raymond James analysts said, “With demand as weak as it is now, of course,
inadequate future supply is hardly what the oil market is worrying about these days.
Nonetheless, reaching peak oil still represents a transformative moment in the history of the oil market, and, if we’re right that this moment is already behind us, it is
only a matter of time before prices begin to reﬂect the reality that oil scarcity may
become a fact of life in the not-too-distant future.”
Pritchard Capital Partners said total crude production from all OPEC members
slipped 75,000 b/d, or 0.3%, to 27.58 million b/d in April, compared with March. The
11 OPEC members under quota restrictions—all except Iraq—produced 25.25 million
b/d, 410,000 b/d more than their ofﬁcial target of 24.84 million b/d. Nevertheless,
OPEC members generally are “staying tight and abiding by their quotas,” said Pritchard Capital analysts.
They reported Saudi Arabia reduced its production by 25,000 b/d to 7.92 million
b/d, under its ofﬁcial target of 8 million b/d. UAE cut production 40,000 b/d to 2.16
million b/d in April, 63,000 b/d lower than its target. According to industry reports,
Abu Dhabi’s export allocation of its Murban, Lower Zakum, and Umm Shaif crudes
to customers in Asia will stay 15% below contract volumes through May—10% less
of Upper Zakum crude than contracted this month and 18% less in June of Umm
Shaif, Lower Zakum, and Murban crude.
Kuwaiti production fell 20,000 b/d to 2.09 million b/d, the lowest production level
since August 2003, and 127,000 b/d lower than its quota, said Pritchard Capital Partners. On the other hand, they reported Nigeria raised production 50,000 b/d to 1.84
million b/d. Angola increased its output by 10,000 b/d to 1.63 million b/d. Algeria and
Iran also increased crude production an unspeciﬁed amount last month, analysts
said.

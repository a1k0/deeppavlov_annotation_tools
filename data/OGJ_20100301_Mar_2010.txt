— Q u i c k Ta k e s

NARUC cites need to retain access to OTC markets tors and continue to target leaseholders that have been identified
Financial reform legislation should ensure natural gas and electric power utilities have continued access to over-the-counter riskmanagement products to keep prices more predictable and less
volatile, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commission (NARUC) said during its 2010 winter meeting.
Proposed federal legislation would give the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight of all OTC products, including mandatory centralized clearing and exchange trading for all
OTC products, according to the resolution. This would increase
hedging costs and, ultimately, consumer prices because margin
requirements would be increased, it warned.
Any new legislation addressing OTC risk management products
should exempt legitimate gas and electric hedging activity from
mandatory clearing requirements, it recommended. The exemption should be narrowly tailored to prevent excessive speculation
in gas and electricity markets, the resolution continued.
Independent oil and gas producers have also said that higher
margin requirements required by regulated exchanges would severely restrict their ability to manage cash flow and obtain financing. The resolution which NARUC directors approved during the
Feb. 14-17 meeting noted that a report by the Joint Association of
End-Users found that such requirements would make less money
available for utility infrastructure and for exploration and production.
“The laudable goals of reform that ensure market transparency
and adequate regulatory oversight can be accomplished by means
other than mandatory clearing of OTC risk management contracts
and the anticipated extra expense,” it continued. Requiring gas
and electric market participants using legitimate OTC hedges to
report them to the CFTC would make markets sufficiently transparent without additional costs associated with mandatory clearing, for example, NARUC’s resolution said.

as high-risk, MMS Director S. Elizabeth Birnbaum said as the US
Department of the Interior agency announced its auditing plan for
2010 on Feb. 17.
“MMS auditors will also be taking a closer look at smaller energy producers that may not have been audited as frequently in
the past,” she said. Audits and other compliance activities which
the agency performs can range from limited scope reviews that
examine one or more specific areas to full-scale audits that review
all aspects of a company’s reports and payments over several years,
she noted.
The agency, which manages federal land on the US Outer Continental Shelf and is responsible for oil and gas leasing there, collects royalties from mineral and energy producers with onshore
leases on federal and American Indian lands as well as operations
offshore on the OCS.
MMS said it receives monthly royalty payments from 2,000
companies and individuals covering nearly 30,000 producing
leases. It uses specific criteria to identify leaseholders and properties which are more likely not to be in compliance. Properties may
range from a single lease to a unit including numerous leases, the
agency said.
During fiscal 2008 and 2009, MMS audited or reviewed more
than 900 companies and more than 6,300 producing federal
properties, it added. In 2009, it collected more than $157 of additional royalties, interest, and civil penalties, including $65 million
in audit and other enforcement activities; $34 million through
sophisticated automated detection systems, including interest due
on late payments, and $54 million through follow-up enforcement actions including civil penalties and negotiated settlements.
“Our goal for 2010 is to cover 86% of high-risk companies and
43% of high-risk mineral producing properties,” Birnbaum said.
By comparison, the US Internal Revenue Service generally audits
1-5% of individual income tax returns, based on income, and 11MMS will increase staff as part of audit strategy 27% of larger companies and corporations, depending on comThe US Minerals Management Service will add 19 new audi- pany assets, she noted. ✦

Range Resources plots expansion in Marcellus
Range Resources Corp., Fort Worth, plans to exit 2010 at a net
180-200 MMcfd of gas equivalent from the Marcellus shale and
2011 at 360-400 MMcfed compared with just above 115 MMcfed
at present.
The company looks to add three Marcellus rigs in the last
quarter of 2010 to the 13 it will keep busy from now until
then, drilling and casing 150 horizontal wells this year. The

end-2011 rig count will be 24.
Range drilled and completed its first two horizontal wells in
the northeast part of the play in Lycoming County, Pa., in the 2009
fourth quarter. Average 7-day test rates were 13.3 MMcfed and
13.6 MMcfed. Hookup will take until late 2010 and early 2011,
respectively.
The company is testing its first horizontal Upper Devonian shale
well and its first horizontal Utica shale well awaits completion.

In the northeast part of the play, the company has drilled 31
horizontal wells, of which 26 await completion and five await
hookup.
Most of the company’s wells are in the play’s southwest portion, where Range has been accumulating data for 2.5 years. The
company said estimated ultimate recovery for a Marcellus horizontal well there averages 4.4 bcfe.
Before August 2009, a typical Range Marcellus well had a
2,200-2,800-ft lateral and eight frac stages. Since then laterals are
2,900-5,000 ft with 9-17 fracs, the company said.
“As has been demonstrated in other shale plays, it appears that
the longer laterals result in higher initial production rates, higher
EURs and improved economics,” Range said.
Range has aggregated 900,000 net acres in the high-quality
part of the Marcellus play, and a considerable share of the company’s $190 million leasehold budget for 2010 will go to block up
its Marcellus acreage position.
As of yearend 2009, for each of its proved developed wells in
the Marcellus shale play, Range recorded on average 1.2 offset
drilling locations as proved undeveloped reserves under new federal rules.

initial high-rate testing may have led to wax deposition near the
well bore.
Early results of a xylene soak-squeeze in the L-38 well indicate
the treatment may not be effective, and Corridor is considering restricting flow rates to stem wax deposition in this part of the field.
Corridor also plans to drill the L-37 horizontal well using an
oil base mud to minimize formation damage. The company expects that a horizontal well in this part of the reservoir may be
free of bitumen and productive without hydraulic fracs. It also
may not experience decline rates similar to those at L-38 and P-47.
The company will defer the second 2010 McCully well fracs are

Based on 2009 exploration success in and around the newly
extended concessions, Apache has accelerated 3D seismic surveying and planned a full slate of exploratory drilling.
The most recent discovery, West Kanayes E-1X in the Matruh
basin on a concession adjacent to Khalda Offset, tested a combined
17 MMcfd of gas and 1,960 b/d of condensate from 80 ft of net pay
in three zones in the Jurassic Alam el Buieb (AEB-6) formation.
The discovery extends AEB production eastward about 4 miles
from production in Khalda Offset and into the sparsely drilled
West Kanayes concession, said Tom Voytovich, vice-president of
Apache’s Egypt region.

Production

ADCO lets contract to boost Bab oil flow
Abu Dhabi Co. for Onshore Operations (ADCO) has let contract
to National Petroleum Construction Co. (NPCC) of Abu Dhabi for
work that will increase oil production from onshore Northeast
Bab field by 80,000 b/d.
The $683 million engineering, procurement, and construction
contract covers development of Lower Cretaceous Habshan-2 and
Thamama G zones. Bab field, on production since the 1960s and
an important source of natural gas, is 150 km southwest of Abu
Dhabi city (see map, OGJ, Aug. 3, 2009, p. 32).
Expansion of Bab oil production is part of an effort by ADCO
to raise its output to 1.8 million b/d of oil from 1.4 million b/d.
Abu Dhabi accounts for nearly all production by the United Arab
Emirates of about 2.27 million b/d.
ADCO also plans to start production from Bida Al Qemzan and
Qusahwira fields and from elsewhere in Bab.
NPCC’s work will include well tie-ins and flowlines connecting production wells to four new remote degassing stations, tieins of 54 water injection wells, pipelines totaling about 950 km,
and associated equipment.

Repsol to develop satellite fields off Spain
Repsol Investigaciones Petroliferas SA has let a lump-sum contract to Technip for subsea work to develop two Casablanca satellite oil fields 50 km off the eastern coast of Spain in the Mediterranean Sea, Technip reported.
A Repsol group made the Montanazo D-5 and Lubina-1 discoveries northeast of Casablanca and off Tarragona in mid-2009.
Montanazo, drilled to 2,354 m in 736 m of water, tested at
3,800 b/d of 32° gravity oil. Lubina, drilled to 2,439 m in 663
m of water 4 km north of Montanazo, made 3,700 b/d of 31.5°
gravity oil. Repsol said each could produce 5-7 years, quadrupling
Spain’s then-existing 2,000 b/d of oil production.
Technip’s scope includes engineering, supply, installation, and
precommissioning of an 11-km flexible pipeline system to connect two production wells to the Casablanca platform, installed
in 1981, which already handles oil from Boqueron, Rodaballo,
Chipiron, and Casablanca fields.
Offshore installation is scheduled for first-half 2011 using the
Deep Constructor, a Technip deepwater construction vessels.
This pipeline system will include a riser, a flowline, and two

“With the high oil rate encountered in the upper zone, this
well will be produced to maximize liquids production during the
time when our gas-handling capacity is facilities-constrained,”
Voytovich said.
Apache, operator of West Kanayes with 100% contractor interest, plans two more exploratory wells in 2010.
Khalda Offset and East Bahariya are among 22 concessions operated by Apache in joint ventures with Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. Apache, the largest producer and most active explorer
in the Western Desert, had gross production of 175,000 b/d of oil
and 752 MMcfd of gas in the last quarter of 2009. Net production
was 96,000 b/d and 383 MMcfd. ✦

short sections of pipe to connect subsea structures.
In addition, Technip will install a pumping manifold and umbilicals. The flexible pipelines and umbilicals will be trenched to
protect fishing lines, Technip said.
All flexible pipelines will be fabricated at Technip’s plant in Le
Trait, France.

BPZ updates Peru Corvina, Albacora operations
BPZ Resources Inc., Houston, placed on long-term test its seventh oil well in Corvina field on Block Z-1 off Peru as it worked
toward a transition to commercial production around May 31.
The company also received approval to restart long-term tests at
the A-14XD well in Albacora field, in Peru near the marine boundary with Ecuador 16 miles north of Corvina field, and resumed
drilling the A-15D well, expected on line by the end of April.
The CX11-17D well in Corvina was making an initial 2,000 b/d
of oil with normal gas-oil ratio and no formation water.
BPZ perforated 80 ft in two sets of sands within the well’s 225
ft of estimated net oil pay. It first opened lower sands that had
not been tested before in prior wells before adding the second set
of sands, thus allowing the company to gather data to update its
geologic and reservoir models.
The company is collecting data to determine the field’s drive
mechanism and has ordered equipment to reinject produced gas
and water.
BPZ has spud the CX11-22D, projected to 10,000 ft measured
depth, and expects to place it on line near the end of April.
The clearance to resume tests at A-14XD, BPZ’s first well in
Albacora, came as it positioned extended well test equipment at
the Albacora platform. BPZ hasn’t determined what production
declines may occur at Albacora.

ERCB reports on Joslyn Creek steam release
The Energy Resources Conservation Board of Alberta (ERCB)
released an incident report on the May 18, 2006, steam release at
Total E&P Canada Ltd.’s Joslyn Creek steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) oil sands project as well as Total’s report on the incident to ERCB.
ERCB’s report notes that the Joslyn Creek project, 60 km north of
Fort McMurray, was the shallowest SAGD development in Alberta,
with horizontal steam injection wells at less than a 100-m depth.

The report said the steam release breached the caprock and affected a 125 m by 75 m surface area. The release caused rock projectiles to travel up to 300 m from the main crater and produced a
1-km dust plume. The report notes that there was no loss of life or
injury and the incident did not emit any harmful gas.
After the incident, ERCB imposed pressure restrictions on
steam injection for the project and in June 12, 2009, approved the
suspension of the project. Recently Total has submitted an application for abandoning the project.
ERCB concluded that Total was noncompliant with its approved
development scheme by operating at bottomhole pressures higher

ExxonMobil to use NRU in Texas field work
ExxonMobil Corp. will employ nitrogen recovery and cryogenic gas processing equipment from Air Products, Lehigh Valley,
Pa., for work to extend the producing life of Hawkins field in
northeast Texas.
Air Products will deliver the NRU plant equipment later this
year.
ExxonMobil will operate the new NRU plant to process about
140 MMscfd of natural gas, said the company in an announcement
last month (OGJ, Jan. 18, 2010, p. 10). Recovered nitrogen will be

failing to shut-in wells that exceeded a 1,800 kPa (absolute) bottomhole pressure.
The Joslyn Creek incident is the only time that a SAGD operation in Alberta has had a caprock breach that released steam to
surface, ERCB said.
ERCB also said it began to implement changes in March 2007
in its application processes. The changes require thermal project
applications to provide more detailed geological information for
determining the caprock competency as wells as provide an outline for monitoring caprock integrity during steam injection. ✦

expects to recover an additional 40 million boe at Hawkins field.
Construction was to begin this quarter with project start-up
expected in late 2011, said an ExxonMobil statement in January.
The project will extend by 25 years the life of the field, which was
discovered in 1940.
Hawkins field lies in Wood County, Tex., about 100 miles east
of Dallas. The company said that over 70 years it has produced
more than 800 million bbl and is one of the largest ever discovered in the state. ✦

RasGas 3 starts up LNG Train 7
Ras Laffan LNG Co. Ltd. 3 (RasGas 3) has started up its 7.8-million-tonnes/year Train 7 at Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar.
Plant capacity matches that of RasGas Train 6, inaugurated last
year (OGJ Online, Aug. 12, 2009), and expands total LNG production from the site to more than 60 million tpy, according to OGJ
figures. Qatar’s North field, estimated to hold more than 900 tcf,
supplies all trains.
The announcement from ExxonMobil Corp. said RasGas 3
Train 7 is the fourth 7.8-million-tpy LNG plant brought online
in the past 12 months by its joint venture with Qatar Petroleum.
“These mega facilities have sufficient scale to competitively reach
markets around the globe,” it said.
RasGas 3 is part of an investment in natural gas production
and liquefaction by affiliates of QP and ExxonMobil that includes
12 new, 210,000-cu m Q-Flex LNG vessels and one 260,000-cu m
Q-Max LNG vessel, said ExxonMobil. The final component of the
investment is the Golden Pass LNG terminal, under construction
near Sabine Pass, Tex. It will be able to regasify 15.6 million tpy
when it starts up later this year.

El Paso to sell Mexican pipeline assets to Sempra
El Paso Corp. agreed to sell its interest in Mexican pipeline and
compression assets to Sempra Pipelines & Storage, a unit of Sempra Energy. The sale includes El Paso’s 50% interest in a joint venture with Mexico’s state owned Petroleos Mexicanos consisting of
the 15,000-hp Gloria a Dios compression station, the 23.4-mile
Samalayuca pipeline, the 70.8-mile San Fernando pipeline (and
75,000 hp of accompanying compression), and the 117.4-mile

Burgos LPG pipeline (with 1,200 hp of pumping), all near the
Mexico-Texas border. The 12.75-in. OD, 30,000 b/d Burgos LPG
pipeline extends from Pemex’s Burgos gas processing center to
Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.
The sale also includes El Paso’s wholly owned 14,000-hp Naco
compression station and 7.8-mile Agua Prieta pipeline, originating
at the Arizona border. El Paso expects the $300 million transaction
to close in the second quarter.
The sale did not include El Paso’s interest in the proposed 1.3bcfd Sonora LNG terminal, covered by a separate joint venture
with Houston’s DKRW Energy LLC. Sonora Terminal and Pipeline
would deliver natural gas to northern Mexico and the southwestern US from the terminal site in Puerto Libertad, Sonora, Mexico.
El Paso says the project has received permits to develop the
terminal and associated pipelines but is still in the process of securing Pacific Rim LNG supplies. It anticipates commercial operations by 2014-15, pending supplier agreements. ✦

Correction
The headline “NARUC study lists adverse impacts for ongoing OCS ban” (OGJ, Feb. 22, 2010, p. 26) incorrectly suggests
that the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners conducted the study. NARUC authorized the study and hired
Science Applications International Corp. to conduct it. The same
article also erroneously identified O’Neal Hamilton as a former
NARUC chairman. He formerly chaired South Carolina’s Public
Service Commission and currently chairs NARUC’s committee
on gas.

‘Climategate’ revisited
Skewed data

Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
Peabody Energy Co. has petitioned
the US Environmental Protection
Agency to reconsider its endangerment
finding on greenhouse gases because
of recent evidence of faulty scientific
research and review in the “Climategate” scandal involving the University
of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit
(CRU). The Texas government, the US
Chamber of Commerce, and a coalition
of eight trade associations are mounting
legal challenges on the same grounds
(OGJ Online, Feb. 17, 2010).
New evidence in the wake of that
scandal “undermines a number of the
central pillars” on which EPA based its
finding that an atmospheric mix of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons,
and sulfur hexafluoride constitutes “air
pollution” that threatens public health
and welfare via climate change.
“Given the seriousness of the flaws
that the CRU material reveals in the development of the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] reports,
and given EPA’s extensive reliance on
those reports, the agency has no legal
option but to reexamine the endangerment finding in light of this new information. Indeed, the analytical process
in which EPA engaged in reaching its endangerment finding is so tainted by the
flaws now revealed in the IPCC reports
that the agency must take the unusual
step of convening full evidentiary hearings in order to provide an open and fair
reconsideration process,” said Peabody.
20

The company provided EPA with a
computer disk of Climategate material
indicating CRU scientists skewed their
supporting data while effectively shutting
out opposing viewpoints. That represents
“new material that was not available
during the comment period and which is
central to the outcome that EPA reached
in promulgating its endangerment finding,” said company officials.
Peabody further accused EPA of failing “to properly exercise its judgment
as required by the Clean Air Act” and
acting “in an arbitrary and capricious
fashion by relying almost exclusively
on flawed reports of the IPCC in attributing climate change to anthropogenic GHG emissions.” The IPCC
reports have since been shown to be
“not the product of a rigorous, transparent, and neutral scientific process,”
Peabody said.
Peabody claimed that EPA “largely
ceded its obligation” to determine GHG
risks “to the IPCC, an international
body that is not subject to US data
quality and transparency standards and
whose reports were prepared in direct
disregard of those standards.”
EPA therefore should reconsider
its endangerment finding “in light of
the recently discovered defects” in the
IPCC’s procedures and convene full
evidentiary hearings “to provide an
open and fair reconsideration process,”
they said.
In December, EPA published its
landmark GHG endangerment finding,
claiming “scientific evidence is compelling that elevated concentrations of
heat-trapping gases are the root cause
of recently observed climate change.”
EPA also claimed a 90-99% probability
that most of the observed increase in
global average temperatures since the
mid-20th century is due to an increase

in anthropogenic GHG concentrations
and is already detrimental to US health
and safety and is likely to get worse.

Science vs. advocacy
Yet just weeks before EPA issued its
finding, someone hacked into the CRU
files and flooded the internet with secret
e-mails revealing many of the principal
scientists who authored key chapters
of the IPCC scientific assessments were
driven by a policy agenda that caused
them to cross the line from neutral science to advocacy. Peabody officials said,
“Indeed, they went far beyond even
what is acceptable as advocacy, as they
actively suppressed information that was
contrary to the ‘nice, tidy story’ that they
wished to present.”
Officials said, “EPA believes that
it has broad discretion in making its
endangerment finding. Although the
extent of EPA’s discretion is debatable,
what is not debatable is EPA’s obligation
to justify the particular choices it made
in exercising that discretion.” Based on
faulty data from the IPCC, they said,
“EPA decided that such emissions were
almost certainly already causing dangerous climate effects, with the danger
almost certainly likely to worsen in the
future. This is an important distinction
because obviously the degree of endangerment that EPA finds will guide the
nature and extent of regulation that EPA
will now promulgate.”
Given the seriousness of the flaws
that the CRU material and other information reveal in the development of the
IPCC reports, EPA now “has no choice
but to conclude that the endangerment
finding itself is now tainted and must
be reconsidered,” they charged. Since
85% of all US energy comes from fossil
fuels, EPA should also consider the economic benefits along with the environmental risks, they said. ✦

Addressing budget blunders
Under rhetorical assault from a government
hunting taxable prey, the oil and gas industry
must sharpen its arguments for stability of the US
fiscal regime.
While introducing his budget proposal for fiscal 2011, President Barack Obama declared, “We
will not continue costly tax cuts for oil companies, investment fund managers, and those making over $250,000 a year. We just can’t afford it.”
The budget itself attacks a series of important tax
preferences in a section labeled, “Other Revenue
Changes and Loophole Closers.”
The propaganda tricks at work here make two
politically potent implications. One is that the industry enjoys great relief in its overall tax burden.
The other is that relief principally benefits large
oil companies, in the scorned class of investment
fund managers and wealthy individuals. Both
implications link to small truths but deceptively
ignore larger contexts.

accelerated amortization of geological and geophysical (G&G) costs. With minor exceptions, they, like
IDC expensing, only defer tax liability.
Percentage depletion can result in a true reduction in tax liability over the life of a property. This
happens when accumulated charges to depletion exceed the total investment in a property.
Percentage depletion is so limited, however, that
the amount of reduced tax liability overall is
small. The same can be said for another so-called
loophole under fire: the deduction for tertiaryrecovery injectants.
In fact, the limits on percentage depletion
refute Obama’s implication that he’s cutting
tax breaks for fat cats. Only small independent
producers can use percentage depletion, subject
to income and production limits. Similarly, only
independent producers can make full use of IDC
expensing. And the proposed G&G provisions

OGJ’s annual capital spending report
shows that capital spending for all oil
and gas projects in the US will decline
5% this year to $220 billion. Greater
efficiency, slightly lower costs, and a
rationalization of refining capacity will
drive this decline.
Upstream spending will dominate
all outlays this year, but by a larger
margin than is typical. Many integrated
companies plan to
shrink their downstream spending from
2009, while some plan
to increase their exploration and production expenditures.
Total spending for
projects in Canada will climb 10% to
$44 billion (Can.) this year. In Mexico,

for commodities like steel and copper,
as well as strong demand for skilled
workers. As demand for these inputs
declined as the global economic slowdown took hold, the costs of inputs
eased, reducing the cost per oil and
gas well drilled in 2009. OGJ forecasts
that the cost per well drilled in the US
will slide by a small margin this year,
leading to a minimal hike in upstream
spending for 2010.
Also, in shale plays and in nonshale
plays, the number of days it takes some
independent producers to drill a well
has fallen dramatically, thereby reducing their costs per well and their total
capital expenditures.
In the Bakken shale in North Dakota,
for example, Enid, Okla.-based independent Continental Resources Inc.

SPECIAL

Capital Spending Outlook

spending is set to increase about 5%
from last year. Capital spending for oil
and gas projects outside North America
will grow this year as well.

US upstream spending
Spending in the US for upstream
projects this year will total $195.667
billion, up from $193.5 billion a year
ago. Included in this total are outlays
for exploration, drilling, production,
and offshore lease payments to the US
Minerals Management Service.
Upstream costs peaked in 2008,

reduced its time to drill each well to 28
days in the first half of 2009 from 45
days in 2008. This led to a savings in
cost per well since many input costs are
leased by the day. Continental said that
its drilling efficiency further improved
for the second half of 2009, averaging
about 24 days from spud to rig release.
OGJ’s upstream spending outlook
is based on its annual drilling forecast.
The most recent drilling forecast called
this year’s US well completions to total
38,238 (OGJ, Jan. 18, 2010, p. 30). The
number of well completions for 2009

Integrated firms’ budgets targeting upstream projects
Marilyn Radler
Senior Editor-Economics
US-based integrated firms are
shifting more of their capital spending
dollars toward upstream projects and
away from their downstream operations that manufacture, transport, and
market refined products.
Marathon Oil Corp. announced that
while its 2010 capital budget of $5.1
billion is down 17% from last year’s
outlays, downstream spending will
contract by 53%.
Marathon plans to spend $1.1 billion
this year on refining, marketing, and
transportation.
Meanwhile, Marathon’s worldwide
exploration and production budget is
set to jump 24% from a year ago. In the
US, the firm’s plans call for $1.656 billion in upstream outlays. This compares
to a preliminary estimate of $1.488
billion in US E&P spending last year.
Outside the US, Marathon’s upstream

completions was 52,097.
Based on a lower cost structure but
greater number of well completions,
drilling and exploration capital expenditures in the US this year are forecast to climb by almost 1% to $162.7
billion. Capital outlays for oil and gas
production are forecast to increase at
the same rate, totaling $30.9 billion.
Bonus payments that the MMS collects from lease sales for tracts on the
Outer Continental Shelf comprise the
third and final component of US upstream spending. OGJ projects that the
total bonus on leased tracts this year
will be $2 billion. Two Gulf of Mexico
sales during 2009 generated $801 million in bonus payments, while four
sales in 2008 generated $6.9 billion in
payments to the MMS.

Marathon reported that its plans
call for $668 million in spending for
oil sands mining this year, down from
$987 million last year, as expansion of

second half.
ConocoPhillip’s capital budget calls
for an overall 10% reduction from 2009
to $11.2 billion. About 86% of this will
target E&P operations, and 12% will be
spent on the company’s refining and
marketing segment.
Meanwhile, Chevron Corp. has
announced that its 2010 capital and
exploratory spending program will
total $21.6 billion, a 5% decline from its
2009 outlays. About 80% of this year’s
budget is planned for upstream projects, and 16% is set for downstream
projects.

ExxonMobil Corp. reported that its
2009 capital and exploration expenditures climbed for worldwide upstream
operations and for its non-US chemical business, but that the company’s
worldwide downstream capital spending declined from 2008.
Last December, ExxonMobil announced that it agreed to buy XTO
Energy Inc. as part of its strengthened
focus on unconventional resources
(OGJ Online, Dec. 14, 2009). Founded
in 1986, XTO holds large interests in
major US shale, tight gas, and coalbed
methane plays as well as the Bakken
oil shale.
After the transaction closes, ExxonMobil plans to create an upstream organization to manage global development and production of unconventional
resources. Outside the US, the company holds interests in unconventional
resources in Canada, Germany, Poland,
Hungary, and Argentina.

$450 million (Can.), will focus on
engineering and maintenance work
at its refineries in Lima, Ohio, and
the BP PLC-Husky refinery in Toledo,
Ohio. Husky also said that some of this
amount will go toward continuous improvement and maintenance work that
has been planned for its ethanol, refining, and retail operations in Canada.

Pipelines, other US outlays
Capital spending for pipelines and
compressor stations in the US is set to
drop this year following an increase in
2009. Pipeline construction will contract for both crude and products lines
and gas lines, according to OGJ’s most
26

recent Worldwide Pipeline Construction report (OGJ, Feb. 15, 2010, p. 39).
This report revealed that plans call
for a total of 926 miles of natural gas
pipelines to be completed in the US
this year, down from 4,000 miles of
construction completed last year. OGJ
estimates that capital spending for
this year’s gas lines will total $2.58
billion.
Plans also call for a total of almost
2,600 miles of crude and products
pipelines to be completed during 2010,
compared to last year’s 3,045 miles.

Spending for the lines this year will
decline 15% to $7.7 billion.
Capital expenditures this year for
other transportation projects in the US
will rebound 13% after dropping 30%
last year. Marketing outlays also will
climb following a down year in 2009.
LNG project spending will be little
changed from last year.

E&P, Canadian oil sands
Much of the growth in capital
expenditures in Canada this year will
be in outlays for oil sands, although
upstream and downstream spending
also will climb from last year.
Capital outlays for conventional oil
and gas exploration, drilling, and production in Canada will increase 8% this
year. OGJ’s drilling forecast calls for a
total of 8,618 oil and gas wells to be
completed this year in Canada.
This follows a 39% contraction in
spending a year ago, as the number
of well completions sank to just fewer
than 8,000. This was down sharply
from 2008 when the number of well
completions totaled 13,118, according
to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
OGJ forecasts that oil sands capital
expenditures, including outlays for
in-situ, mining, and upgrading, will
increase by 10%, rebounding from last
year’s 17% decline. The most recent
figures from CAPP reported that oil
sands spending in 2008 totaled $18.113
billion (Can.).
After last year’s pullback, a handful
of large oil sands projects are getting
the go-ahead this year. Alberta’s Energy
Resources and Conservation Board
has approved the Husky-BP Sunrise oil
sands project. Also, ConocoPhillips will
start construction this year of the second phase of its steam-assisted gravity
drainage Surmont project.
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.,
Calgary, announced that its total 2010
capital budget will increase 26% over
2009, with more than 80% allocated to
the development of its crude oil assets.

Congressmen query service firms about frac fluid contents
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US House Energy and Commerce
Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) and Energy and Environment Subcommittee Chairman
Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) sent letters
to eight oil field service companies
requesting information about chemicals
used in hydraulic fracturing fluids on
Feb. 18.
“Hydraulic fracturing could help us
unlock vast domestic natural gas reserves
once though unattainable, strengthening America’s energy independence and
reducing carbon emissions,” Waxman
said. “As we use this technology in more
parts of the country on a much larger
scale, we must ensure that we are not
creating new environmental and public
health problems.”
Markey noted, “Gas can play a very
important role in our clean energy
future, provided that it is produced in
a safe and sustainable way. By getting
more information from the industry
about hydraulic fracturing practices,
Congress can help ensure that development of this important resource moves
forward in a manner that does not
harm the environment.”
An oil and gas lobbyist, meanwhile,
told OGJ, “We’re aware of the request.
The technology is proven and it’s safe.
I’m aware that [US Environmental
Protection Agency] officials have even
said so recently. States have done a very
good job regulating this since its first
use. We’ll work and review the request
from Mr. Waxman and Mr. Markey and
respond as best as we can.”
Fracing fluid is more than 98%
water and sand, the lobbyist noted.
Since 2003, under a voluntary agreement with EPA, companies have not
used diesel fuel as a carrier fluid when
working with coalbed methane wells
in association with underground
drinking water sources, he said.
28

‘Continuing effort’
“It’s difficult to know exactly where
they’re going,” said Lee O. Fuller,
vice-president of government relations at the Independent Petroleum
Association of America. “I think it
shows a continuing effort to respond
to antidevelopment groups who want
to make chemicals an issue, whether
used in fracing or other aspects of production.”
States have regulated casing and well
bores for decades to protect drinking
water supplies before fracing became
practical, Fuller pointed out. “Raising
a chemicals issue in connection with
fracing is an effort to create anxiety
among people around production areas
that is not founded in fact,” Fuller told
OGJ.
Waxman noted that when he
chaired the Oversight and Government Reform Committee in the 110th
Congress, he requested and received
information from BJ Services Co., Halliburton Co., and Schlumberger Ltd.—
the three largest well-stimulation
companies—on chemicals they used
in their fluids.
He said data provided by the companies showed that two of them used
diesel in their fluids during 2005-07,
potentially violating the voluntary
agreement with EPA. Halliburton
reported using more than 870,000
gal of seven diesel-based fluids, while
BJ Services said that it used 2,500 gal
of diesel-based fluids in several frac
jobs, he said. The two companies also
indicated that they used chemicals such
as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and
xylene, which Waxman said could pose
environmental risks in their fracing
fluids.
“The information provided to the
Oversight Committee did not specify
whether these fluids were injected in or
near underground sources of drinking
water,” Waxman and Markey said in a
Feb. 18 memorandum to Energy and

Environment Subcommittee members.
“This is an important issue because
injecting the chemicals in or near
sources of drinking water could create
contamination risks.”

Other questions
The congressmen added that the
Safe Drinking Water Act could have
been violated if the fluids contained
diesel. The responses also did not address how the companies dispose of
fracing fluids and whether it was done
in an environmentally safe manner,
they said.
“Another set of questions involves
the practices of smaller companies,” the
memorandum continued. “When Halliburton, BJ Services, and Schlumberger
signed the diesel [memorandum of
agreement] in 2003, the three companies performed 95% of the hydraulic
fracturing jobs in the United States
each year. Since that time, smaller
companies have increased their market
share…. Little is known about [their]
practices.”
To answer these questions, Waxman and Markey said they sent letters
on Feb. 18 not only to Halliburton, BJ
Services, and Schlumberger, but also
to Frac Tech Services in Cisco, Tex.;
Superior Well Services in Indiana, Pa.,
Universal Well Services in Meadville,
Pa.; and Sanjel Corp. and Calfrac Well
Services in Calgary. The eight companies have until Mar. 5 to supply the
information.
Concerns also have been raised
about how producers and service
companies dispose of fracing fluid and
produced water extracted from wells,
the memorandum continued. The
Oversight Committee did not request
this information at the time. Waxman
and Markey said more information is
needed to assess the wastes’ chemical
contents and determine how it can be
disposed of in an environmentally safe
manner.

Congress passed funding for EPA to
study fracing, and the agency apparently is looking hard at how water will
be handled in New York and Pennsyl-

vania where geologic formations favorable for underground disposal are not
readily available. “We as an industry
are stepping up and trying to deal with

this, looking at ways to handle surface
impoundment and storage,” the oil and
gas lobbyist said. “I’m sure we can deal
with it.” ✦

EPA may raise GHG control threshold, Jackson says
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Environmental Protection Agency is considering raising
the threshold at which refineries and
other large industrial plants would be
required to control greenhouse gases
(GHGs) beyond the 25,000 tons/year
originally proposed.
Responding to a Feb. 19 letter from
John D. Rockefeller IV (W.Va.) and
seven other Senate Democrats, EPA

Administrator Lisa P. Jackson did not
specify what the new threshold might
be. She said she expects EPA to begin
regulating GHG emissions at refineries,
chemical plants, and other large industrial facilities next year under the Clean
Air Act. No regulations are planned for
2010.
“In the first half of 2011, only those
facilities that must apply for [CAA] permits as a result of their non-greenhouse
gas emissions will need to address their
[GHG] emissions in their permit appli-

cations,” Jackson said, adding that she
expects EPA to begin regulating GHGs
from other large industrial sites during
next year’s final six months.
“Between the latter half of 2011
and 2013, I expect that the threshold
for permitting will be substantially
higher than the 25,000-ton limit that
EPA originally proposed,” Jackson said.
“In any event, EPA does not intend to
subject the smallest sources to [CAA]
permitting for [GHG] emissions any
sooner than 2016.”

When tax ‘reform’
turns personal

I

t has become a rite of Washington’s spring. As the snow and ice
begin to melt (with the piles particularly high this year following two
major snowstorms within a week in
mid-February), independent producers descend on the nation’s capital
to explain why administration tax
proposals would be so devastating.
What the White House Office of
Management and Budget considers outdated federal tax loopholes
needing to be closed are lifelines
that independents say are needed to
continue operating. The Independent
Petroleum Association of America
and several regional groups are coordinating these “member call-ups”
to discuss other issues as well. But
OMB’s punitive tax proposals lead
the list of grievances.
Trade associations effectively
explain contributions a healthy
independent oil and gas community
makes to national, regional, and local
economies. They draw attention to
the domestic production that would
be lost if, for example, operators of
wells producing less than 15 b/d lost
their federal tax exemption.
The numbers add up. They also
might obscure the fact that many
who would be hurt are small businesses.

has five employees and is a secondary producer that would not remain
profitable if Congress approves the
proposed oil tax changes.
Terry Sternbridge, who founded
SW Operating Inc. in Kilgore, Tex.,
in 1983, was more specific. “Not to
be able to have intangible drilling
expensed in the current year would
make it virtually impossible to amass
capital to drill risk-laden wells, which
are the lifeblood of small exploration
companies like mine,” he said.

A heavy load

The percentage depletion allowance
“at least offers some relief” to already

EPA proposed regulating GHGs
under the CAA in response to a 2007
US Supreme Court ruling that GHGs
are air pollution and subject to regulation under the CAA if EPA determined
that emissions of them endanger public
health. The agency issued such a finding on Dec. 7.
The endangerment finding obligates
the agency to regulate GHG emissions
from motor vehicles, Jackson said. EPA
will begin that process in late March
when it issues GHG emission standards
for 2012-16 model year light-duty vehicles. Simultaneously, the US Department of Transportation will issue a
rule raising fuel economy standards for
those vehicles.
Senate approval of a resolution by
Lisa Murkowski (R-Alas.) expressing
disapproval of EPA’s GHG endangerment finding would keep EPA from
issuing GHG standards for light-duty
vehicles while undoing what Jackson
termed “an historic agreement among
states, automakers, and other stakeholders” and leave automakers “without the
explicit nationwide uniformity” they
consider vital to their business, the letter said.
“Moreover, a vote to vitiate the
[GHG] endangerment finding would be
a vote to reject the work of the 13 US
government departments that contribute to the US Global Change Research
Program,” it continued. “It also would
be viewed by many as a vote to move
the United States to a position behind
that of China on the issue of climate
change, and more in line with that of
Saudi Arabia.” ✦

EXCO-BG ramps up Haynesville gas output
EXCO Resources Inc. has hiked
gross production to 340 MMcfd in its
Haynesville shale 50-50 joint venture
with BG Group PLC and has begun
horizontal drilling in the Marcellus
shale.
The Haynesville output, tallied on
Feb. 7, came from 34 operated wells
drilled with an average of seven operated rigs and compared with 7 MMcfd
in the 2008 fourth quarter. EXCO-BG
holds 107,800 net acres, up 22,800 net
core area acres since forming the joint
venture.
Net Haynesville production was 96
MMcfd as of Feb. 7 compared with 47
MMcfd in the fourth quarter of 2009
and 6 MMcfd in the fourth quarter of
2008.
Capital spending for 2010 is budgeted at $255 million net to EXCO to drill
115 operated and 23 nonoperated wells.
The operated wells include 95 Haynesville shale horizontals, seven Bossier
shale horizontals, six Cotton Valley
horizontals, and seven wells in the
Vernon, La., area. In the EXCO-BG area
of mutual interest, spending will total
$741 million net to the joint venture.
TGGT Holdings LLC, a 50-50 joint
venture with a BG Group affiliate, had
averaged throughput of more than 850
MMcfd. In the 2009 fourth quarter
TGGT completed the first of four stages
of a 29-mile, 36-in. header system
through the Holly field area to gather
and deliver the companies’ Haynesville
gas to interstate pipelines.
Operations began Nov. 30, 2009, on
the system, which will eventually have
a capacity of 1.5 bcfd. TGGT averaged
474 MMcfd in 2009, and throughput
now exceeds 850 MMcfd.
EXCO-BG increased the operated horizontal rig count to 13 in the
Haynesville and plans to raise that to
at least 14 for the rest of the year. It
also plans to run at least one operated
horizontal rig in Appalachia throughout
2010. Current companywide rig counts
are 17 operated and four nonoperated.

As EXCO sold assets and reorganized around the shale plays in 2009, it
added 242 bcf of gas equivalent (bcfe)
of proved reserves through the drill bit
and produced 128 bcfe. The majority
of the new reserves resulted from 2009
Haynesville horizontal development
where the company ran an average of
six operated rigs for the year and completed 25 operated wells.
EXCO cut the average gross cost of
an operated Haynesville horizontal
well 25% to $9.5 million in 2009 and
expects 2010 well costs to continue at
or below that level. Drilling days were
cut nearly in half from 72 days for the
early wells.
Under new Securities and Exchange
Commission rules, EXCO added an
average of 2.5 offsetting proved undeveloped locations with average gross
reserves of 6.6 bcf for each producing
well drilled. Under the former rules, it
would have added an average of 1.6 offsetting proved undeveloped locations.
EXCO-BG is investing in two major
water projects. One will enable it to
use discharge water from an industrial
plant as a key water source for hydraulic fracturing. This will lessen the
impact on local water supplies, reduce
truck traffic, and provide an environmentally safe option for water procurement.
The joint venture also has a salt
water management project to transport
service water and gather produced
water across its acreage, reducing truck

traffic and handling water much more
efficiently and more cost effectively.
EXCO-BG’s first horizontal Haynesville
well, Oden-30H6 in DeSoto Parish, La.,
has sold 3.2 bcf in its first year on production. The JV’s average operated well IP
in the DeSoto area is 22.8 MMcfd.
EXCO is encouraged by Bossier test
results in four vertical Haynesville wells
from 2008 and is drilling its first horizontal Bossier well with seven Bossier
horizontals planned in East Texas and
North Louisiana in 2010.
It has greatly reduced activity in the
Cotton Valley, Hosston, Travis Peak,
and Pettet conventional horizons but
does plan a six-well horizontal testing
program in Cotton Valley in DeSoto
and Caddo parishes to check the feasibility of a larger program in 2011 and
beyond. It plans 28 mainly Hosston
recompletions in DeSoto.
EXCO holds more than 654,000 net
acres in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, of which 343,000 are believed prospective for Marcellus and Huron shale
gas and 186,000 are in the overpressured Marcellus fairway. Negotiations
are under way for a further 42,000 net
acres.
The 2010 capital budget is $154
million for drilling, land, seismic,
midstream expansion, and operations.
About 70% of the fairway acreage
is held by shallower production in
Clinton-Medina and stacked Devonian
sandstone, Devonian shale, Berea shale,

Obama reaffirms pledge of ‘tough
decisions’ on new OCS areas
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Repeating a point that he made in
his State of the Union address on Jan.
27, US President Barack Obama told

business executives that his administration is willing to make tough decisions
on opening new offshore areas for oil
and gas development.

policy,” the president said in a Feb.
24 address to the Business Roundtable
in Washington. “We know there’s no
silver bullet here. We understand that
to reduce our dependence on oil and
the damage caused by climate change,
we’re going to need more production
in the short term, we’re going to need
more efficiency, and we need more
incentives for clean energy.”
He said that funding under the
2009 Economic Recovery Act already
has helped jump-start the US clean
energy industry with an investment
which will lead to 720,000 jobs in that
business by 2012. He also cited administration efforts to make homes and
businesses more energy-efficient, loan
guarantees to construct the first new
US nuclear power plant in decades,

and support for three of the world’s
largest solar plants.
“And I’ve said that we’re willing to
make tough decisions about opening
up new offshore areas for oil and gas
development,” Obama continued. “So
what we’re looking at is a comprehensive strategy, not an either/or strategy
but a both/and strategy, when it comes
to energy.” But to actually make the
transition to a clean energy economy,
it will be necessary to put a price on
carbon pollution, he added.
Bills including imposition of a
cap-and-trade system which passed
the full US House and the US Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee in 2009 have drawn criticism for
their treatment of oil refiners, chemi-

cal plants, and other large industries,
which Obama acknowledged. “I am
sympathetic to those companies that
face significant potential transition
costs, and I want to work with this
organization and others like this to help
with those costs and to get our policies
right,” he said.
“What we can’t do is stand still,”
the president maintained. “The only
certainty of the status quo is that the
price and supply of oil will become
increasingly volatile, [and] that the
use of fossil fuels will wreak havoc on
weather patterns and air quality. But
if we decide now that we’re putting a
price on this pollution in a few years,
it will give businesses the certainty of
knowing they have the time to plan for
the transition.” ✦

Va. lawmakers earmark future offshore energy revenue
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Approval by Virginia’s senate and
house of a bill allocating future offshore energy royalties and revenues to
transportation and alternative energy
research signals that the state is ready
for environmentally responsible development off its coast, Gov. Robert F.
McDonnell said.
“There is bipartisan consensus on
this issue,” the governor said on Feb.
22 after the Senate, by 21 to 19 votes,
approved a proposal by Del. Chris
Stolle (R-Virginia Beach) which passed
the state’s house of delegates on Feb.
8. “Offshore energy development has
the support of this administration, the
Democratic state senate, the Republican
house of delegates, and US Sens. Mark
Warner (D) and Jim Webb (D).”
The measure’s approval was more
symbolic than substantive because it
would be years before Virginia began to receive a share of revenue and
royalties from new federal offshore
energy development. McDonnell, who

32

campaigned for election in 2008 on
a platform that supported developing
Virginia’s offshore energy resources to
create jobs, said that the bill nevertheless ensures that the money will be
directed to two crucial areas.
Stolle’s bill earmarks 70% of those
revenues and royalties to the state’s
road and rail fund, 10% to local
transportation projects, and 20% to
the Virginia Coastal Energy Research
Consortium, which McDonnell said
studies and develops renewable energy
solutions.
“When we move forward in the
years ahead, we will create thousands
of new jobs for our citizens, produce
hundreds of millions of dollars in

new state revenue, and spur billions in
investment in our commonwealth,” the
governor said. “Virginia is ready to take
the lead in helping move our nation
closer toward energy independence
while creating new, good-paying jobs
for our citizens.”
The National Ocean Industries Association also applauded the Virginia state
senate’s action. “The vote, backed by
Gov. McDonnell, demonstrates a strong
bipartisan commitment to allow OCS
exploration off its coast and actively
work with Congress and the Obama
administration to move forward with
[Outer Continental Shelf] Lease Sale

Purchasers lining up for Russia’s new ESPO blend
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
ExxonMobil Corp. and Mitsui &
Co.—each said to be buying 730,000
bbl—are the latest in a growing list of
purchasers of crude oil delivered by

Russia’s Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean
(ESPO) pipeline.

have already bought supplies of the
new crude, which started flowing from

Eastern Siberia in late December.
This week’s purchase will arrive in
Japan in early March and be processed
at two ExxonMobil-affiliated refineries
after being carried along the ESPO line
to Skovorodino and then by rail to Russia’s Pacific Coast port of Kozmino.
According to industry observers, the
supplies of East Siberian crude oil will
aid Japan in reducing its heavy dependence on Middle Eastern oil, which
currently stands at 90%.
Russian crude costs less to transport
than oil from the Mideast nations, taking just 3-4 days sailing time to reach
Japan, compared with 20 days from the
Middle East.
Apart from quicker shipping and
lower transport costs, East Siberian

crude also has a lower specific gravity
than oil from the Middle East, which
enables production of more gasoline
and kerosine.
Last October, officials at Russia’s energy ministry said the new ESPO-brand
crude would be light and mediumsour, superior to Urals export blend but
inferior to Siberian Light (OGJ Online,
Oct. 12, 2009).
As a result, other Japanese oil distributors, such as Nippon Oil Corp., are
considering the idea of sourcing supplies of the ESPO blend.
Japanese and Korean firms are not
alone in seeking the new Russian oil as
the Asia-Pacific crude market last week
saw the first sale of ESPO to a Chinese

buyer, a move analysts said may set a
new phase in trading of the new Russian stream.
The purchase was made by Unipec,
which bought a 730,000-bbl cargo of
ESPO crude from Rosneft. The oil will
be shipped out of the Kozmino terminal on Mar. 17-18.
Increasing demand in Asia for the
new Russian blend confirms Moscow’s
vision of the long-awaited ESPO pipeline.
“It is a strategic project, which enables us to enter the growing markets
of the Asia-Pacific region,” said Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in a
ceremony to launch the new line at the
port of Kozmino (OGJ Online, Dec. 29,
2009). ✦

Chavez advises
the queen

T

he oil and gas industry is well
aware of Venezuela’s President
Hugo Chavez and his antics. Now,
the Latin American dictator has become an advisor of sorts to Britain’s
Queen Elizabeth II.
“Queen of England, I’m talking to
you,” Chavez said in a recent radio
broadcast. “The time for empires is
over, haven’t you noticed? Return the
Malvinas to the Argentine people.”
Las Malvinas, of course, is the
name used throughout Latin America
for the Falkland Islands—a name
which actually derives from the
French, who called the archipelago
Les îles Malouines, after early settlers
from the French port of Saint Malo.
So, returning the islands to Argentina might be more difficult than
Chavez imagines, even if the queen
had the power to meet the Venezuelan dictator’s demands. But what’s
Chavez really up to here?

To be sure, the dispute with
Buenos Aires over sovereignty is
expected to make exploitation of any
oil found more expensive than otherwise since supplies and equipment
cannot be imported from Argentina,
which recently imposed its own
restrictions (OGJ Online, Feb. 17,
2010).
The spat also means any gas discoveries will need to be very large to
be commercially viable as the island’s
population of around 2,500 is a
limited market and the gas cannot be
piped to the mainland.

Investors undaunted

“Only if a gas discovery was very
large would it justify the construction of an LNG terminal from which
the gas could be exported,” one analyst said, noting: “LNG facilities cost
billions of dollars to build.”
Undaunted, British investors clearly are backing the effort to find oil

a contract between the Iraqi Ministry of
Oil and Iraqi Ministry of Industry and
Minerals.
By late 2008 it was only 60% complete. The Kurdistan Regional then
privatized the refinery and transferred
the construction project to KAR Oil, a
unit of the Kurdish KAR Group, with a
target to commission the facility by last
July.
KAR Oil calls the Erbil facility the
first major refinery in Kurdistan and
the first private-sector refinery in Iraq.
Khurmala Dome, covering an area of
20 km by 8 km, is on the northern end
of giant Kirkuk oil field. Its development to supply the Erbil refinery is
covered by a November 2008 agreement between the Kurdistan Regional
Government and Iraqi oil ministry.
KAR Oil has worked on Khurmala
Dome development since 2004. Last
year it installed a 200,000-sq-m central
process facility and is building production capacity to 150,000 b/d of oil and
100 MMscfd of natural gas.

Marcellus E&P, transportation programs ramp up
Focus on the Appalachian basin
Marcellus shale gas play deepens.
Ultra Petroleum Corp., Houston,
plans to drill more than 110 Marcellus
wells in 2010 compared with 37 gross
(22.5 net) wells in 2009.
Mitsui E&P USA LLC will earn a
32.5% interest in 100,000 net acres held
by Anadarko Petroleum Corp. in the
play in north-central Pennsylvania for
$1.4 billion.
And Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., a
wholly owned unit of El Paso Corp.,
Houston, executed binding, 20-year
term agreements with Chesapeake Energy Marketing Inc. and Statoil Natural
Gas LLC for 100% capacity on its Northeast Upgrade Project in the Marcellus
shale.

2010, capacity is expected to exceed
560 MMcfd.
The company began 2009 with
288,000 gross (152,000 net) acres in
the Marcellus. Through a combination
of land acquisitions, trades, and swaps,
Ultra increased its holdings to 326,000
gross (169,000 net) acres by yearend
2009.
An acquisition announced in late
2009 and to have been completed in
late February will expand its holdings
to 486,000 gross (249,000 net) acres.
To its core position in Tioga, Bradford, Lycoming, and Potter counties in
north-central Pennsylvania, Ultra will
add acreage in Lycoming, Clinton, and
Centre counties.

Ultra Marcellus outlook

Mitsui will earn the interest by
funding all of Anadarko’s share of
Marcellus development costs in 2010
and 90% of costs after that, completing
its funding obligation by about 2013.
The agreement, subject to regulatory
approvals, is to close on Mar. 15 and is
effective Jan. 1.
Mitsui will also have the option to
buy 32.5% of Anadarko’s existing wells
and additional acreage acquisitions by
reimbursing a proportionate share of
Anadarko’s prior expenditures, currently estimated at $100 million.
Anadarko said its fairway position
in the Marcellus has a gross unrisked
resource potential of more than 30 tcf

Ultra had placed 13 wells on production by the end of 2009 at rates averaging 7.5 MMcfd. Laterals at those wells
average slightly more than 3,800 ft.
Initial production rates at the
horizontal wells completed so far have
ranged from more than 3.4 MMcfd to
10.4 MMcfd, including two wells that
are exceeding 7.5 MMcfd after 30 days.
First 30 days’ production averaged
more than 3 MMcfd at the company’s
first six wells and more than 5.7
MMcfd at its next seven wells. The
company’s first production in the Marcellus program began in July 2009.
Preliminary estimated ultimate
recoveries affirm Ultra’s 3.75 bcf of
gas equivalent type-curve, and some
preliminary EURs exceed 6 bcf of
gad equivalent. The cost to drill and
complete a horizontal Marcellus well in
2009 was $3.5 million.
Ultra’s four interconnects to major
interstate pipelines remain well ahead
of the drilling campaign. By midyear
38

Mitsui joins Anadarko

and spans more than 715,000 gross
acres. The companies said more than
4,500 wells are likely to be drilled
within 10 years.
Mitsui projected net peak production at 360-460 MMcfd, $3-4 billion in
project costs, and a 60-year production
life.
Anadarko’s acreage extends from
Bradford and Sullivan counties on the
northeast across Tioga, Lycoming,
Potter, Clinton, Centre, and Clearfield
counties to the southwest.

Pipeline expansion
The Tennessee gas project will provide 636 MMcfd of incremental firm
transportation capacity from TGP’s 300
Line in Pennsylvania to an interconnect
in New Jersey for shipment to Northeast markets.
El Paso expects to file its Northeast
Upgrade plans with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in spring
2011 to meet a scheduled Nov. 1, 2013,
in-service date. El Paso held an open
season in February to gauge additional
shipper interest with final capacity to
be awarded in March 2010.
The project will cost about $400
million.
Williams Cos. Inc. entered joint
ventures in 2009 with both Rex Energy
Corp. and Atlas Pipeline Partners LP

IGas to exploit shale gas resource off Wales
IGas Energy PLC said it has identified
a “significant” shale resource as potentially extending beneath more than
1,195 sq km of its acreage in northwest
England with an expected average

thickness of 250 m.
“These shales are understood to be
hydrocarbon-bearing as they have been

Bay area,” IGas said.
The firm said that total organic carbon in the Holywell shales of Namurian age has been measured to range
from below 0.7% to more than 5%
with an average of around 2.1%.
IGas has identified independent consultants to review the hydrocarbon potential of the shales and their potential
to produce gas. It said the consultants
will be reporting on the results “once
this work is complete.”
Meanwhile, IGas Chief Executive
Officer Andrew Austin said the continuing work on understanding the full
potential of the acreage to deliver gas
once again gives the firm “greater confidence” in the resources it holds.
“The potential of delivering shale
gas is particularly exciting, as this
sector has seen significant growth in
North America and increased interest
across continental Europe,” Austin said.
The UK is one of several countries
in Europe where exploration for shale
gas is being carried out by international

oil and gas companies. Others include
Sweden, France, Germany, Austria,
Poland, and Hungary.
In addition to work by Royal Dutch
Shell PLC in Sweden, ExxonMobil Corp.
is exploring Lower Saxony, while OMV
AG is testing formations near Vienna.
By yearend, ConocoPhillips and 3 Legs
Resources are expected to have test
results from northern Poland (OGJ
Online, Sept. 21, 2009).
IGas’s latest announcement coincided
with reports that IGas increased its estimates of gas at its Point Of Ayr project
by 7.5% to 3,823 bcf. IGas is operator
with 75% interest and Nexen Inc. has
25% in four licenses mostly offshore
near Prestatyn on Wales’s north coast
on the eastern margin of the East Irish
Sea basin.
According to recent reports, IGas
currently has enough reserves to power
about 7% of Britain’s homes for the
next 15 years and is targeting net production of 8,000 boe/d by the end of
2014 on 20-50 sites. ✦

Shell, HP seek high-res wireless land seismic
Royal Dutch Shell PLC and HewlettPackard Development Co. LP plan to
develop a wireless sensing system to acquire extremely high-resolution seismic
data on land.
The new system promises to vastly
improve the quality of land seismic
data by delivering a much higher channel count and a broader sensor frequency range than are currently available,
the companies said.
One key to the system is a digital
fluidic microelectromechanical systems
accelerometer that is up to 1,000 times
more sensitive than high-volume products currently available, HP said. The
accelerometer, which measures vibration, shock, or change in velocity, is
considered a breakthrough in nanosensing research.
Sensors based on this technology
can achieve noise density performance
in the sub-100 nano-g per square root
Hz range, HP said.

Shell and HP will use their complementary knowledge and experience to
produce a groundbreaking solution to
sense, collect, and store geophysical
data. The system is designed to integrate seamlessly with Shell’s high-performance computing and seismic imaging environment and to be deployed
safely and more cost-effectively than
current systems, they said.
Gerald Schotman, Shell executive
vice-president, innovation/research
and development, said, “We think this
will represent a leap forward in seismic
data quality that will provide Shell with
a competitive advantage in exploring
difficult oil and gas reservoirs, such as
subsalt plays in the Middle East or unconventional gas in North America. As
a result of this exciting collaboration,
we expect to fully realize the potential
of Shell’s processing and imaging technology on land.” ✦

Kenya
Platform Resources Inc., a subsidiary of Alberta Oilsands Inc., agreed
to assign a 100% interest in Kenya
blocks 12A and 13T to Africa Oil Corp.,
Vancouver, BC, in return for Africa Oil
stock and warrants, subject to regulatory approvals.
The contract areas are next to Africa
Oil’s Block 10BB, where the 2009
Loperot-1 discovery is judged to have a
best estimate of 15 million bbl of oil in
place (OGJ Online, Sept. 15, 2009). The
block has at least five other prospects
and 17 leads.
Existing gravity data on blocks 12A
and 13T suggest that the proven Lokichar basin and other prospective subbasins and known strong leads in Block
10BB may extend onto blocks 12A and
13T. Africa Oil plans to shoot seismic
on the new blocks within months.
The PSCs on blocks 12A and 13T
are for 3 years from September 2008.
Initial minimum exploration expenditures are $3.65 million on 13T and $3.6
million on 12A. The initial exploration
work program includes 500 line-km of
2D seismic or 100 sq km of 3D seismic
on each block or a combination thereof.

Sao Tome & Principe
Sao Tome & Principe’s National
Petroleum Agency confirmed the award
to ERHC Energy Inc., Houston, of 100%
working interests in blocks 4 and 11 of
the Sao Tome & Principe Exclusive Economic Zone in the Gulf of Guinea.
The confirmation follows ERHC’s
exercise of rights arising from prior
agreements between ERHC and STP.
The agency indicated that it expects to
invite ERHC to negotiate production
sharing contracts on the blocks.
The EEZ covers 160,000 sq km south
and east of the Nigeria-Sao Tome &
Principe Joint Development Zone. Block
4 is east of Principe, and Block 11 is
east of Sao Tome.
ERHC also has rights to acquire up
to a 15% paid working interest in two
more blocks of its choice in the EEZ.

Horizontal laterals
After determination of the withdrawal rate allocations and required
well number, as discussed in Part 1,
the next step in optimizing the field
development was to evaluate well attributes, such as well length, placement,
and horizontal lateral orientation. This
involved numerous studies for assessing the type of wells and configurations, surface facilities, and processing
requirements to minimize the development cost.

vantageous than vertical wells in terms
of productivity, sweep, and recovery.
They also maintained an edge in costeffectiveness.
The two criteria used for determining horizontal length were the productivity index (PI), which determined the
well rate, and pressure drawdown.
As discussed in Part 1, multiobjective function and experimental design
simulation models determined the desired production rate for each area and
each well. Knowing the PI relationship
of vertical to horizontal well performance made possible the calculation of
the length of the lateral.
This length was in turn optimized
by making sure it is long enough to
provide a drawdown that inhibits
coning either through the matrix or
through heterogeneities, such as fractures or high permeability thief zones
connected to fractures.
After the determination of the horizontal length, the next step determined
the placement of this lateral. For this
both analogy and simulation modeling
played major roles in the decision.
A neighboring field with reservoir
fluid, rock properties, and depositional, as well as migration settings
similar to Khurais has a bottoms-up
reservoir sweep. This sweep pattern
was reproduced in the Khurais dual
porosity-permeability reservoir simulation models and provided the basis for
placing the horizontal laterals in the
top pay interval of Khurais reservoirs.
Real-time geosteering made sure that
the horizontal laterals went through
the best pay possible.
The design optimized the orientation of the azimuth of the horizontal
laterals along the maximum stress
direction of North 80o East. This is
the optimum orientation to avoid
the majority of the open fractures as
observed in both production performance (in terms of PI and well rates),
and in numerous image log runs in
neighboring fields.
Because well rates can be met

is field testing a technology application of SC with wet-connect ESPs for
long-term performance in a well that
had a successful initial completion and

While Saudi Aramco completed most
wells as smart-ready for the application of this technology, as needed, field
tests continue for the purpose of future
optimization.
In the case of dual-reservoir commingled production, a field test is under way of a horizontal well for longterm performance. The well already
had a successful initial completion and
installation with individual laterals
placed in each reservoir (Fig. 3). The
well has ESPs and smart control in each
lateral to provide the means to balance flow contribution from individual
reservoirs and avoid interreservoir cross
flow.
As discussed extensively in Reference 2, the new completion is different
from other systems used previously
in the industry. It uses a redesigned
hydraulic disconnect tool (wet-connect)
to make the connection between the
upper completion with the ESP and the
lower completion that has the SC. This
system ensures that routine ESP repair
can be made without retrieval of the
SC.

area, the reservoir has a lower PI and
flatter structural relief with underlying
water. In this area, multilateral MRC
wells (Fig. 4) provide the necessary
production rates with low-pressure
drawdown, mitigating any water
coning, either through the matrix or
heterogeneities.
The area also has a smart-completion
field test. The other MRC wells have
the mother bores completed in smartready mode with in-place 7-in. liners
to ensure the wellbore configurations
are adequate for next-generation smart
equipment with wet-connects.

Intelligent field initiative
All technology applications in the
Khurais complex that satisfy both immediate needs or long-term visions
operate in the intelligent field (I-Field)
mode with all producing wells either
equipped with smart sensors as part
of the SC or as part of downhole smart
ESP.
A central operating command center
houses all of the controls for these producing wells, as well as injection wells.
The center regulates oil withdrawals
and water injection rates in real time.
For mitigating water coning or cusping in producing wells, it is important
to monitor and control through the
variable-speed ESP the pressure drawdown for individual wells.
For an injection well, it is vital that
injection rates be distributed to ensure
the flood front conformance through
proper injection-production allocation.
Monitoring reservoir behavior
through an I-Field is not only through
the producers and injectors, but also
through a network of dedicated observation wells as part of a master surveillance plan. These wells are placed
strategically to yield vital information
in real time, needed for quick response
as part of the production-injection
strategy.
The master surveillance system, as
its name implies, is proving its worth
before the commissioning of the field
production facilities because the system
provides in real time, at the time of this

article, information on the reservoir
behavior during the field-wide interference tests. These tests provide a oncein-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire
pulsing data for evaluating reservoir
performance and for updating production-injection strategies after the field’s
commissioning.
It is also interesting to note that,
at the time of this article, well tests
indicate productivities of the horizontal wells are three to five times more
than those of the current few existing
vertical wells in the fields. The complex
would have had a higher development
cost if it had vertical wells.
Field-wide interference tests in
Khurais indicate an excellent reservoir
connectivity and pressure propagation
from peripheral injection to in-field
producers, setting the stage to ensure
that the Khurais complex will produce
efficiently, safely, and economically.

Pipelines

A back-propagation neural network
can easily predict the energy consumption of a pipeline system with fewer
mathematical statistics than other
methods and a simple pretreatment of
the original data.
The energy consumption prediction uses different nonlinear influence
factors by learning the operation data
of a certain pipeline via the BP neural
network. Calculated results show a
prediction error within 5%, capable of

satisfying engineering demand.
No uniform selection criterion
exists for the number of nodes in the
latent layer. The selection of a latent
layer and its number of nodes, however, do influence the degree of nonlinear error and therefore need further
study.
The prediction uses actual pipeline
operation data and therefore will only
improve as more data are monitored
and recorded and more influence factors emerge.

Background
Fuel oil and electricity consumption
account for most of pipeline operating
costs. Improving efficiency requires
analysis of energy consumption trends
and identification of the weak links in

energy utilization. Energy consumption
prediction for pipeline systems remains
an immature science despite considerable research.
One proposed energy-consumption
prediction model applies regression
treatment to a pipeline’s operation
data.1 Computations using the regression method, however, are lengthy
and its prediction accuracy is low. It
also is incapable of predicting energy
consumption at any chosen throughput
point.
The gray theory method needs fewer
samples, simple calculations, and has
a wide range of application. Its accuracy, however, is not ideal because it
only considers throughput even though
many factors can affect a pipeline’s
energy consumption.2
An artificial neural network (ANN)
model belongs to a latent-formula
model and is capable of self-organizing,
self-adaptability, and self-learning.3-4 BP
neural network is a supervised training,
multi-layer back-propagation neural
network. It can perform discretionary
nonlinear mapping.
The relation between a pipeline system’s energy consumption, its facilities,
and operating scheme is complicated.5-9
This article describes the mapping relation between energy consumption and
different factors, including throughput,
as simulated by BP neural network for
the Zhong-Luo oil pipeline.

Equation 1 defines effective heat
load at an oil transport station. Equation 1 shows the energy needed to heat

BP network
Kolmogorov theory states a threelayer BP network can approach discretionary continuous nonlinear mapping.10 The three layers consist of an
input layer, latent layer, and output
layer.
The input layer receives the external data, the latent layer processes and
converts the input data, and the output
layer produces the output. Interconnection occurs among layers and the nodes
in the same layer have no connection. The number of variables, such as
energy consumption influence factors
and energy consumption indicators,
determines the number of nodes in
the input and output layers. The node
quantity of the latent layer is confirmed
by trial and error.
The essential step in BP neural network modeling therefore is determining how to confirm the node number.
The latent layer nodes express the nonlinearity between the network’s input
and output. Selection of a latent layer
and its number of nodes influences the
nonlinear error between the predictive
and actual values.
Increasing the number of latent
layer nodes can increase the adjustable
parameters of the nonlinear optimizing problem, strengthen the memory of
the network, and yield a more accurate
result, but it debases the study speed of
the network. Too few latent layer nodes
can cause the network to converge to
its partial minimum. Experiment and
experience yield the correct number of
latent layer nodes.
Throughput, STDBOS, STDBIO, and
SPDBIO act as the target output for
constructing the three-layer BP neural
network’s energy-consumption prediction models: OCUOPTTV, ECUOPTTV,
and CECUOPTTV. Fig. 1 shows the
prediction model of OCUOPTTV having three layers of input—throughput,
STDBOS, and STDBIO—and one of output, OCUOPTTV. The prediction model
of the ECUOPTTV (Fig. 2) has the same
structure, with SPDBIO replacing STDBOS as the input layer and ECUOPTTV
replacing OCUOPTTV as the output

forward-propagation and error signal
back-propagation. In forward-propagation, the input signal moves from input
layer to output layer, layer by layer. The
neurons in the output layer respond to
the input mode.
Adaptive learning requires changes
in the training procedure used by
trainlm. These include first calculating
the initial network output and error.
At each epoch the current learning
rate calculates new weights and biases,
which it then uses to calculate new outputs and errors. If new errors are fewer
than in the previous iteration, calculation ceases. If new errors expand, backpropagation occurs until new errors are
less than old errors.
Network testing must follow training. The test uses a simulated function
to obtain network output and check
whether the deviation between the
predicted value and the actual value
meets requirements. The tested samples
in Table 2 trained the BP network after
initialization treatment, producing corresponding output values from the now
trained network.
The system compared the predicted
value and the actual value. If errors
are within required levels the network
is available if not it must be trained
again.6
The previously discussed network
predictive models forecast pipeline
energy consumption. Tables 3-5 show
the calculated results. The tables show
the average relative deviation range
between predicted and actual values
as <5% in all cases: 1.49%, 2.74%, and
4.28% respectively.
Fig. 4 shows the contrast curves between predicted and actual values. The
units of OCUOPTTV, ECUOPTTV, and
CECUOPTTV are kg/(104 tonne∙km),
kW∙hr/(104 tonnne∙km), and kg coal
equivalent/(104 tonne∙km), respectively.
This method indirectly considers almost all the influence factors affecting
the pipeline’s energy consumption.

Deviation analysis
Three factors cause the deviation between predicted value and actual value.

Energy consumption data cannot reflect
actual operating conditions exactly.
Using only the four available influence
factors reduces the model’s abilities.
Determining the number of latent layer
nodes by repeated testing led to some
systematic errors. ✦

With the turn of the
year, Barclays Capital
analysts reviewed major
developments in global
LNG trade for 2009 and
offered insights for 2010
LNG
in a research note published in late January.
In 2009, said James Crandell, Biliana
Pehilvanova, and Michael Zenker, weak
Asian demand and growing global
supply pushed a large number of spot
LNG cargoes toward the Atlantic Basin.
Rather than flooding US markets, as
was feared, however, Europe absorbed
most of the excess, as the continent
rejected pipeline imports and filled
storage to accommodate record LNG.
European markets maintained a small
price premium to the US.
Global oversupply last year pushed
natural gas prices in Europe, the
Americas, and Asia into convergence.
In third-quarter 2009, spot LNG traded
for $3.10-4.60/MMbtu around the
world, said the analysts, the “tightest
price range for spot global LNG in some
time.”
Supply growth could accelerate in
2010 as liquefaction plants that started
up last year ramp towards full capacities this year and a few new plants
begin operation.
Despite recovering global LNG
demand, the size of expected supply increases again threatens to flood

the world with LNG well more than
potential growth in demand. And, barring extended cold weather, a global
oversupply would promote greater
interdependence for global gas prices
this year.

Global supply
Natural gas prices in 2009 in
Europe, the Americas, and Asia converged, thanks to a global glut of LNG
(Fig. 1), and represented perhaps “the

tightest connection of global gas prices
ever.”
The glut occurred despite underperforming supply. Global liquefaction
capacity added a record 5.8 bcfd in
nameplate capacity in 2009 (Fig. 2),
but much of this came on in secondhalf 2009. Start-up problems delayed
production from several new trains and
lost production from existing plants
offset much of the new additions.
Consequently, global LNG supply

Mexican consumers could contribute
5-7 MMcfd growth in global demand.
With an estimated increase of global
LNG supply next year of 5 bcfd, this
would leave more than 2 bcfd of LNG
aimed at US and European markets in
2010.
Last year, most excess spot LNG
sailed to Europe. In 2010, however,
European markets could struggle to
expand LNG receipts. Although regas
capacity allows for further gains, record
inventories and already-low pipeline
imports afford little flexibility for
Europe to absorb LNG more than for
immediate needs.
Nevertheless, LNG demand is
“poised for recovery,” and import
demand (by pipe or boat) and stocks
should grow in 2010. Ultimately, the
need for LNG in Europe will depend
not only on demand growth, but also
on the interplay between pipeline
imports, LNG, and storage change, all
of which will influence the strength of
European prices relative to the rest of
the world.
North American markets face a glut
of gas as well.

sources have transformed the North
American market to one in which
demand is failing to match potential for
supply additions. The US and Canada
started this winter season with record
gas in storage. Although balances will
likely tighten this year, production continues to outpace expectations, while
the recovery of demand marginally lags
Barclays Capital’s earlier projections.
The US and North America have
already in 2010 received more LNG imports than for the same period in 2009.
Even greater flows could result if European needs drop more than expected or
global demand falters.
Weather could alter the outlook not
only for North America, but also for
global gas (and LNG) markets this year,
as Europe and parts of Asia have also
been unusually cold, said the analysts.
Most global LNG consumption is in

the northern hemisphere and is, therefore, exposed to cold weather in many
markets simultaneously. In Europe, UK
demand jumped to daily records in
January, pushing deliverability infrastructure and causing some shortages.
China in December and January was
struggling to meet heating load in its
northern provinces, as the country was
hit by extended extreme cold. Such
cold already helped reduce the inventory surplus around the world, said the
analysis, although not yet enough to
ensure a balanced market.
The cold could prove to be transient,
but a continuation of below-normal
temperatures across the globe over the
course of the northern hemisphere’s
winter could substantially affect balances, potentially alleviating much of
the oversupply and resetting regional
balances and price differentials. ✦

New mobile evaporator for shale gas operations
Newly launched MoVap is a mobile
evaporator system specifically designed
for the frac and produced waste water
treatment needs of the Marcellus gas shale
region in the US East.
The unit is designed to reduce the
volume of high total dissolved solids laden
waste waters from the gas well frac operation directly at the wellhead. The advantages of carrying out the operation are
recovery of waste for reuse and reduction
of waste discharge, the company notes.
Versatility of the MoVap design and its
mobility allow the unit to be effective in
other oil and gas shale regions of the US
such as Barnett, Haynesville, Fayetteville,
and Antrim.

nondamaging. It can be used for matrix
and fracture stimulation in carbonate
reservoirs with permeability contrasts or
natural fractures.
The system is designed to be used in
oil or gas wells in openhole and casedhole intervals, regardless of deviation.
Treatment design, execution, and evaluation are optimized using this firm’s proprietary software applications.
Treatments can be bullheaded or
pumped through coiled tubing, batchmixed for small volume jobs, or mixed on
the fly for larger treatments. The treatment works effectively at low treatment
rates and continues to stimulate as it
degrades.

From the Subscribers Only area of

BP, ConocoPhillips
show opinions vary
on climate change
It should be clear now if it wasn’t before that the oil and gas industry does not
represent uniform opposition to policies
addressing climate change.
Even Big Oil, that monolith of popular
villainy, is divided on important questions
about the issue.
Popular mythology, contrived by environmental propagandists and reinforced
by gullible media, won’t acknowledge

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

that serious adults and the companies
they work for can disagree over serious
questions about climate change. In the
mythological view, oil companies all see
response to climate change as a threat to
profits and therefore resist it in defiance of
clear and urgent reasons to act.
In fact, companies vary in their corporate opinions about the extent and nature
of the threat of climate change, about
causes and the need to respond, about
costs, and about what responses—if any
are in order—would be best. Disagreement has been demonstrated anew by the
withdrawal of two major oil and gas companies from a group called the US Climate
Action Program (USCAP), formed to create
a framework for policy-making.
BP and ConocoPhillips support action
on climate change but became disaffected
when USCAP supported cap-and-trade
legislation threatening to penalize refiners
and raise fuel costs.
Why it took them this long to see
problems with membership in a coalition that includes the antioil likes of the
Environmental Defense Fund and Natural
Resources Defense Council is anyone’s
guess. But right choices are right choices,
whenever they occur.
Erosion of the scientific case for urgent
action, spun out of the scandal-ridden Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
must have influenced their decisions.
As IPCC lapses come to light, alarm
over climate change increasingly seems
driven by the political usurpation of science. Now the lone remaining oil company
in UNCAP is Shell, whose executives have
been heard to describe climate-change
science as “settled.”
That banality comes from the chapter
of popular mythology entitled, “Oil Companies All Think Alike on Climate Change.”
As credibility of the IPCC, the supposed
science settler, melts away, it’s a proposition worth reconsideration of the type BP
and ConocoPhillips gave UNCAP membership.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Futures price contango compresses
There has been a gradual compression this year of the futures price contango
for key benchmark crudes, with the narrowing most evident at the front of the
North Sea Brent curve.
As to when the market will tighten enough to remove the front-month contango
completely, Paul Horsnell, managing director and head of commodities research at
Barclays Capital in London, said Feb. 18, “An aggressive timing would be as early
as next month, although that would require a run of particularly strong data. The
slowest likely timing would be June, but we see the current dynamics as favoring a
slight flirtation with backwardation by the end of April.”
He said, “The flattening of the very front of the curve seems to have some more
urgent momentum.” The fall of commercial crude inventories at Cushing, Okla., in
the week ended Feb. 12, “even as overall US crude inventories rose, is one source
of support for that transition in West Texas Intermediate, but the process has some
broader base beyond just the constructive pattern of Midwest dynamics,” Horsnell
said.
The Energy Information Administration said US crude stocks jumped by 3.1
million bbl to 334.5 million bbl in that week, well above Wall Street’s consensus of
a 1.7 million bbl gain. Gasoline stocks advanced 1.7 million bbl to 232.1 million bbl,
also exceeding a consensus for a 1.5 million bbl increase. Distillate fuel inventories
fell 2.9 million bbl to 153.3 million bbl, exceeding analysts’ expectations of a 1.5
million bbl decline but still above average for this time of year (OGJ Online, Feb.
18, 2010).
Crude prices climbed in eight out of nine sessions on the New York Mercantile
Exchange Feb. 8-19, falling only in the Feb. 12 session. The front-month crude contract closed at $79.81/bbl Feb. 19, after climbing a total 8% through that shortened
week with the New York market closed for the Presidents Day holiday on Feb. 15.
Horsnell said, “We expect to see the low point of the range shift upwards in the
transition towards a dominant $80-90/bbl range.
Crude prices were relatively flat in early trading Feb. 22. However, natural gas
was down more than 2% despite the National Weather Service’s 8-14-day prediction of a “high probability” of unseasonably cold temperatures in the Southeast
and Southern Plains in March.
Air, truck freight increases
Horsnell cited a recent Barclays Capital report of a steady rise in the absolute
level and year-over-year profile in air freight traffic volumes “that has recovered
sharply from a 1% fall in October to a 10% increase in November and a 24% increase in December.”
He said, “With the overall recovery in global distillate demand waiting on a
sustained increase in freight volumes and a normalization in final goods inventory
to goods sales ratios, the air freight recovery seems to augur well for the path of
overall freight volumes.”
He said, “What has been lacking to date is evidence of a sustained uptick in
road (and rail) freight. The latest trucking data do, however, seem to suggest that
there has been something of a turning point, or to be more precise that the low
point for US truck movements is more clearly in the rear-view mirror. The latest
American Trucking Association data show a slight month-over-month uptick in
trucking mileages for December in the raw data, and a slight month-over-month
fall in the seasonally adjusted data. However, it also shows the first year-over-year
increase in trucking mileage since June 2008. Using the seasonally adjusted data,
the year-over-year increase of 5.9% contrasts with the decline of 16.9% for 2009 as
a whole.”
Overall, trucking dynamics “appear to be continuing their gradual improvement,
and we are confident enough in that data flow to declare that the low point for US
truck freight was indeed reached and passed as long ago as April 2009,” Horsnell
said. “It may be apparent in the trucking data, but the evidence of the watershed
having been reached has been slower in the weekly oil data. Diesel inventories are
at least moving closer to their 5-year average in a constructive manner.”
He added, “The latest weekly reading on distillate demand is, at 3.787 million
b/d, the highest of the year so far, but as a herald of better things to come it seems
rather muted. The overall overhang of inventories above the 5-year average ticked
up by a mild 1.4 million bbl in the latest data, made up of 900,000 bbl of crude and
500,000 bbl of products.

Cameroonian soil as one of the richest of the continent with many
mining layers. Experts are forecasting a bright future to the country.

Huge potential of natural
resources under the ground

T

he already existing exploitation and some
recent researches are
very promising; it
could consolidate the
overall economy of the country.
Indeed, current geological facts reveals
that six to seven mineral layers are now
beyond the stage of research; certain minerals are already in a production such
as iron, bauxite, and nickel/cobalt.
The Ministry for industry, mines and
technological development, ensures
that the government encourages strategic partnership between companies
that already have a good know how and
other operators conducting researches,
in order to boost the sector and move to
production as soon as possible.

conﬁrm the enormous potential of the
country.
More precisely, the potential is so important in many different ﬁelds that
it’s important here to outline each and
every one of them;
For the oil sector the potentialities are
estimated at 250 million barrels,
* Natural gas 187 billion m3,
* Bauxite 1000 million tons,
* Iron 1000 million tons,
* Cobalt/nickel/manganese for
225 million tons,
* Diamond layer of 736 million carats.
The cumulated value of these resources
quoted above would be higher than 100
billion dollars; it could lead to the creation
of 200.000 jobs directly and indirectly.

Local transformation
From studies to action
In his speech addressed to the Nation,
at the end of the year on December 31,
2009, H.E President Paul Biya, stressed
out the importance of the mining potentialities and conﬁrmed that certain
projects were very encouraging and
already showing some great results.
During 2010, special attention will be
given to “the construction of the cobalt,
nickel, and manganese mine located in
Nkamouna, the government will follow
closely the diamond mine exploitation of
Mobilong and the rehabilitation of the site
of the ex-Cellucam for the starting of the
activities of the Edéatech technopolis.
We will accelerate the process for bauxite exploitation in Minim-MartapNgaoundal and iron in Mballam. As per
the gold in Bétaré-Oya, its industrial exploitation has already started in 2009”.
The different studies made recently

To consolidate these assets, the
Cameroonian authorities are counting on
an increased transformation process of
the raw materials, a local transformation,
likely to multiply by ten the receipts and to
reinforce the development of the country.
The massive export of rough minerals
does not allow the country to beneﬁt
from the real revenue of minerals.
Therefore, “we need to tackle the different
issues starting with the lack of infrastructures, the lack of qualiﬁed personnel and
the ignorance of the mining potential of the
countries by the investors. These problems
need to be solved,” insist the ministry.
According to reliable studies form the
Ministry for industry, mines and technological development, a production of
2,5 million tons of bauxite dedicated to
export, is traded at 62,5 million dollars.
If this same quantity were to be trans-

formed on Cameroonian soil into aluminum, the proﬁt would be of 1000 million dollars, sixteen times higher than
the current trading (you need six tons of
bauxite to obtain a ton of aluminum).

Good Governance in the mining
sector
Cameroon is now asking for more transparency and good governance from the
companies.
The country has ratiﬁed the “Extractive
Industry Transparency International
(EITI)”, and came up with a very precise
mining Code of non-discriminatory
measures for granting and managing of
the mining titles and the distribution of
income of mining taxation, as well as
the effective application of the process
of Kimberley for the sale of minerals.

oil and gas

Research and explorations are in
progress; the perspectives are encouraging for a higher production
in the oil and gas sector.
It will change the face of industry
in Cameroon and will allow the
country to be a stronger player in
the current international market.

Cameroon is
not yet part of
the largest oil producers of the continent. However, many explorations and
research in progress clearly demonstrate
that the potential is very important.
The reasons are geographical, indeed
Cameroon, being located at the center of
Africa, offers the possibility of a diverse
production.
It shares the same basin as certain large producer countries, for example
Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea, whom
are among the ﬁrst ﬁve-oil producer
in Africa, but also, Gabon, Congo and
Chad, which are average producers.
Currently, explorations continue in several parts of the country, from the basin of Logone Birni, frontier to Chad
and Nigeria, as those of Rio del Rey, the
Atlantic and the littoral next to Gabon,
Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria.

Biofuels

Even if the production is still at
a domestic scale, the initiatives
for the production of biofuels in
Cameroon is in everyone’s mind.
However, this technology is not
very welcomed by local NGO’s.

Cameroon! Initially supervised by Elf,
then Total, the delivery of this crude

oil was done at the price traded on
the international market. Therefore,
when the crude would sky rock on the
worldwide market, Sonara had to pay
the high price, a non-sense, when the
majority of the refiners of oil-producing countries were making substantial dividends.
When the crude reached the price of 60
dollars/barrel in 2005, the Cameroonian
model showed its limits.
The company started its reorganization
and started to tackle historical issues and
mismanagement. Consequently, an operation of voluntary departures would

Why Cameroon would not be
able to refine its oil?
This paradoxical situation is explained
by historical mismanagement. Indeed,
the reﬁnery of Limbe does not answer
speciﬁcities of Cameroonian oil, which
explains its dependence from Nigerian
oil mainly, and Total, leading vendor.
The modernization program should
correct this anachronism. Conceived at
the beginning to treat light crude, Sonara

crease signiﬁcantly.
Beyond the national market, Sonara intends to become a stronger player at the
regional scale.
Currently, with production of 2,1 million tons of crude, 51% are devoted to
the national market, the remaining is
being traded within CEMAC countries
(Economic and monetary community
of the States of Central Africa).
The increase in capacity for treatment of
3,5 million per annum should reinforce
its regional presence. Sonara would then
meet the needs estimated at 1,2 million
tons per annum, of all central Africa as
well as Nigeria.
Modernization will be done in two
stages, with, initially, the change of the
plates of the principal fractionating column to increase production capacity. In
the second phase, Sonara will start the
transformation of heavy fuel.

Rising oil income

8

The oil income continues to
support the growth in the
CEMAC region, which balances with the drop of other
commodities due to economical downturn.

The CEMAC zone is surfing
on oil Revenues

T

he hydrocarbon that
contributes for 45%
of the gross domestic product of the
Economic community and monetarist of central Africa
(CEMAC) remain the pillar of its economical growth. Their production
dropped certainly by 1,2%, passing
from 52,2 million tons in 2007 to 51,6
million tons in 2008. But this retreat is
less than the -4,4% decrease that occurred between 2006 and 2007. It was
largely compensated by an increase of
24,4% of the average costs from export
of oil products.
The economy being based on the increase of oil incomes, the growth of the
real GDP for the CEMAC zone was established at 4%, against 4,6% in 2007,
as indicated in the report of Banque de
France 2008 on the Free zone. The nonoil sector with 3.9 contributions is certainly responsible for the current ﬁgure.
However, the contribution of the hydrocarbons sector of is even more substantial with 4.1.
The national growth rate of the
GDP is higher in Equatorial Guinea
with (16,8%), in Congo (5,2%) and
Cameroon (3,5%) where volumes of
extracted hydrocarbons increased or
remained stable. It is weaker in Gabon
(1,9%), where the production of oil
contracted, and it became negative in
Chad (-0,8%) where, political instability is seen as the major problem for
higher production. ”stated the report
of Banque de France.
The growth rate of the Central African
Republic, which is rather an importer of
oil products, signiﬁcantly regressed, passing from 3,6% in 2007 to 2% in 2008.

Investments
The industry sector recorded a growth
of 2.2 within the CEMAC in 2008, which
is the same ﬁgure as 2007.
It reﬂects the importance of the investment plans implemented by companies
who decided to extend their production,
mainly in the oil sector.
The contribution of the construction
sector was established to 0.6, mainly due
to the upgrade of the highway networks
and railways systems. In the service sector, the good performances recorded by
the marketing activities, in the transport
and telecommunications ﬁelds, allowed
the sector to grow by 1.9.
This sector particularly beneﬁted from
a strong local demand especially in the

mobile development.
On the other hand, the contribution of
the agricultural sector remained modest
in 2008, mostly due to important decline in demand in cotton harvests (-3,8%
after -15,4% in 2007) and a fall of the
coffee production (-11,1%), slightly attenuated by the increase in the production of cocoa (+1,8%), mentions the
report of the Banque de France.
Except hydrocarbons, the Zone suffered
from a decrease of world demand for
raw materials.

Drop of incomes
The drop of incomes in the CEMAC
Zone in the export of basic commodities
was largely compensated by the increase

The CEMAC
zone sees higher
investments

in manganese exports (134%), in
addition to those of hydrocarbons.
The trade balance for 2008, ended
up with a surplus of +23,6%.
The oil revenues account for 85,8%
of the total of exports of the CEMAC
zone evaluated at 19 2003,2 billion
FCFA in 2008, against 15 643,4 billion
FCFA in 2007.
This financial surplus contributed
to keep the level of investment rate
in the CEMAC zone where it accounted for (28,8% of the GDP in
2008 compared to 29,5% in 2007),
“primarily thanks to the dynamism
of the private sector investments,
in particular in the oil sector (investments of exploration and development), telecommunication and
agro-business”, added the Banque
de France manager.
Thanks to the oil sector which represents 74% of the national budgets,
public ﬁnances have also improved
with an increase of 33,1% of their
total revenues and a budget surplus
of 11,5% of the GDP, against 8,2%
in 2007.
In general, the CEMAC States
made use of this money to reimburse foreign debts (1 501 billion
FCFA) and interiors debts (2 383
billion FCFA), to increase the salaries and wages (+16,6%), to invest
in the infrastructures sector and
to attenuate the impact of the increase of food prices; However the
consumer price index has been rising to 5,9% in 2008, against 1,8%
in 2007.

T

he investment
rate in the monetary area has
recorded a 10%
increase in 2008,
while rising to 38% in 2009 against 29%
last year, indicated the CEMAC Zone
committee.
The CEMAC Zone has come as long a way
in terms of investment. Indeed, during
the Eighties and the Nineties, the CEMAC
showed a preoccupying withdrawal of
investment rather than incoming investment. Flows of FDI had become negative. The tendency started to be reversed
timidly in 2000. Cameroon, for example, had recorded a retreat of 16 million
dollars between 1985 and1991, however
saw an increase of 83,1 million dollars in
2002. Central Africa had investment for a
little less than 10 million dollars in 1993
dropped to 4,3 million dollars in 2002.
The most spectacular ﬂow of investment
goes to Chad, thanks to newly found oil
reserves. According to the ﬁgures of the
UNCTAD, in 1992, its investments had retracted to 2,3 million dollars.
In 2002, more than 900 million dollars
ﬂowed into the country.

Significant progress
To reverse the tendency, the region needed,
to improve its infrastructures, to upgrade
its means of communication, to provide a
more attractive business environment, and
install good governance, indicated Joseph
Djaowe in an article in the African Review
for Integration published last January.
The report stated some signiﬁcant progresses in ﬁelds considered to be the most
sensitive for the FDI.
Indeed, the creation of a special banking
commission for central Africa allowed the

sector to have a better visibility and got rid
off past problems.
At the same time, the macro-economic indicators of the region evolved in a positive
way. The privatization of several state enterprises (National company of Electricity,
Control of the Railroads of Cameroon) in
Cameroon, the leading economy of the region, shows great progress in the zone.
The oil discoveries are not taken into account in this indication. The conjunction
of theses efforts and measures explains the
ﬂow of investment.
The measures taken by the CEMAC ZONE
Commission could justify the growth rate,
which appears to be less affected than predicted due to economical downturn.
The Economy grew to +2,4% against a forecast of +2,1%. Nevertheless, it shows a
Net retreat compared to 2008, with +4,1%.
The renewal of the investments and the
growth did not involve any inﬂationary
push. The rate is in fold, approximately 4%, against 5,9% in 2008.External
Deposit rate should remain around 100%.
The central bank maintained the directing
rate with 4,25%.
On the other hand, monetary reserves
got hit by the international ﬁnancial crisis, while falling from 6839 billion FCFA
(10,43 billion euros) in 2008 to 6344
billion FCFA. Equatorial Guinea is the ﬁrst
contributor with 1671 billion FCFA, followed closely by Congo with 1619 Billion
and Cameroon with 1526 Billion.
The only disappointment comes from the
emission of public titles, initially scheduled
for last October, has once again to be deferred to the ﬁrst quarter of the next year.
The BEAC estimated that the tests revealed some problems and additional reforms
would be implemented.

The Cameroon maintains with its main
ﬁnancial backers, trusting relationships.
Whether with international monetary
institutions, the multilateral and bilateral
cooperation, the serenity has returned.

Thanks to financial backers,
the serenity has returned

Yaoundé is the capital city of
Cameroon and the second largest
city in the country after Douala.

“T

he analysis of debt
sustainability
in
low-income (DSA)
conducted jointly
by the IMF and the
World Bank shows that the risk of debt
distress remains low in Cameroon. All external debt ratios remain well below thresholds associated with policy implementation, included in the baseline scenario and
stress tests; indicators of public debt also
remain at comfortable levels. The building
practices of debt management, improving
the mobilization of non-oil revenue and
broadening the export base remains desirable, given the expected decline in oil revenues over the long term.” The common
position of the Bretton Woods reﬂected
in the latest IMF report, released in late

2009, gives an outline of the relations
between Cameroon and major ﬁnancial
backers. Distrust observed in the past
has turned into a relationship of trust,
although improvements should be made
to both sides so that people ﬁnally feel
the positive effects of this cooperation.
Indeed, the Cameroonian authorities are
to be commended for their recent economic achievements. Prudent management
of oil windfalls under the recently completed PRGF-supported program has allowed
the authorities to accumulate government
deposits at the BEAC and contribute to the
regional pool of foreign exchange reserves.
These savings now provide some welcome
buffers that can be used to alleviate the
impact of the global crisis.
Economic analysts describe the success

of Cameroon’s completion point under the Initiative Highly Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) in 2006, as the start of
a new relationship between Cameroon
and its ﬁnancial backers. Apart from the
IMF and World Bank, Cameroon reaching the completion point has allowed
other backers, multilateral and bilateral
agencies, including the London Club and
Paris Club, to give ﬂexibility to the national economy. The consequences, namely
a cancellation of Cameroon’s debt to just
over 1,000 billion CFA francs, conﬁrm
these good reciprocal relationships.

Completion point under
the HIPC initiative
On the basis of relevant studies, it is
proved that Cameroon has adequate

means to repay the IMF. Access to 50%
of the share (about 0.6% of GDP) does
not jeopardize debt sustainability. The
stock of external debt is small and the
analysis of debt sustainability shows
that the country presents a low risk of
debt distress.
Thanks to the debt relief obtained under
the HIPC Initiative and Relief (MDRI),
the stock of public debt Cameroon fell
about 10% of GDP external debt to about
6% of GDP at the end of 2008, while the
NPV of external debt (NPV) was equal to
10.2% of exports. Despite adverse international economic crisis “the staff welcomed
the accelerated implementation of structural reforms to make the economy more resilient to shocks”.
After the last phase of the three-year
facility of poverty reduction and
growth Facility (PRGF) last year, the
Cameroonian authorities have clearly
expressed their option to withdraw from
the mentoring IMF because, unlike past
two decades when the country’s economic policy was virtually defined by donors, international financial institutions
of Bretton Woods would play a more advisory role. In this regard, instead of the
regular three-year program, a normal
cycle of a year was suggested.
On the occasion of the annual greeting to
the diplomatic corps on January 6, 2010,
Cameroon President Paul Biya emphasized relations with ﬁnancial backers, where he particularly welcomed the consolidation of this cooperation. “We also
maintained a dialogue with our multilateral and bilateral partners, maintained
dialogue with the European Union, which
remains our main partner in development
assistance with whom we appreciate the
continued support. Finally, we maintained
dialogue with the IMF and World Bank
whose role, I repeat, will be crucial for the
economic recovery of our country”, said
the Head of State of Cameroon.

What is
reliability worth?
Overcoming
flow-convergence issues
with maximum
near-wellbore
conductivity.

Industry Challenge
• Improve sustained production
• Consistently create fractures in cased and cemented horizontal wellbores
• Optimize frac design
• Overcome flow-convergence issues, especially in near-wellbore region
Halliburton Solution
CobraMax® H fracturing service (with Hydra-JetSM service through coiled
tubing for perforating) uses a proppant pack as the final stage of each
fracture treatment. Major benefits include:
• Performing multiple-interval treatments individually
• Eliminating the need for packers or separate trips in the hole
• Providing diversion for successive treatments up the hole
Operator Benefit
Halliburton’s CobraMax H service achieved maximum conductivity in the
near-wellbore region. With this service, risk was lowered and completion
costs per BOE reduced (up to 50% lower when compared with
conventionally fractured horizontal wells).
To learn more about how Halliburton puts reliability in action,

General

Interest

Marathon unit to pay ﬁne in oil-price case
Marathon Petroleum Co. LLC agreed to pay a $1 million civil
fine to settle a US Commodity Futures Trading Commission charge
that it tried to manipulate crude oil markets.
CFTC alleged that Marathon tried to manipulate the spot cash
price for West Texas Intermediate crude delivered at Cushing, Okla,
on Nov. 26, 2003, by attempting to influence downward the market assessment for the crude that day by Platts, McGraw-Hill Co.’s
energy news and price-reporting service.
Platts derives its WTI market assessment, which is used as a
benchmark price in some transactions, from trading activity during a particular 30-min period of the physical trading day. CFTC
said Marathon priced about 7.3 million bbl/month of physical
crude off the assessment at the time in question.
CFTC charged that on Nov. 26, 2003, Marathon purchased WTI
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange with the intention
of selling physical WTI during the Platts window at prices intended
to drive the reporting service’s WTI spot cash assessment downward. The company also offered WTI through the prevailing bid at
a price level aimed at driving the Platts WTI assessment lower, the
regulator said.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

with 878 leases, he said.
“Due to a combination of incentives such as deepwater royalty
relief, robust oil and gas prices, and technological advances,” he
said, “companies leased more than they were physically able to
explore. A rig conundrum followed as a result of higher oil prices,
increased production commitments, and frontier plays becoming
more feasible; companies could not even drill potentially exciting
blocks in order to get a lease term extension.”
Now 10 years later, he pointed out that these leases are “expiring and up for grabs.”
Jurecky said the WoodMac analysis identifies 594 deepwater
blocks within Minerals Management Service deadlines for inclusion in the 2007 lease sales, compared with 245—the average
number of newly expired blocks offered for lease in 1997-2006.
“Many of these deepwater blocks are located in plays which
could lead to impressive finds,” he added.
He said the area likely to draw most attention is the Lower Tertiary, which covers areas in Alaminos Canyon, Keathley Canyon,
and Walker Ridge. The report indicates that 41% of the blocks
Wood Mackenzie identified are in this area, and interest is likely to
be fueled by the successful flow test carried out last year at Chevron
Corp.’s Jack well.

WoodMac: 2007 lease sales forecast at $1 billion
Edinburgh consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. forecasts that proceeds from this year’s Gulf of Mexico lease sales 204 and 205,
based on past total winning bids, could reach $1 billion.
The estimate represents a high not seen in the region for a decade, WoodMac said in its recent report, “GOM Lease Sales 204 and
205 exposed.”
Also in that report, WoodMac identifies 594 deepwater blocks
that may be included—double the annual average number of leases
offered between 1997 and 2006, the report said.
WoodMac warned, however, that the anticipated higher bid totals and more leased acreage will not necessarily lead to a proportional increase in exploration and production.
According to Matthew Jurecky, Americas upstream analyst for
Wood Mackenzie, “Tightness in the deepwater oil field services
market, especially in drilling rigs, is likely to limit the benefits of
accumulating a mass of blocks as happened a decade ago.”
In 1997 a record 1,242 deepwater blocks were leased, representing 255% more than the 10-year average for 1997-2006. That
record amount was followed by a further wave of blocks in 1998

Complaints dismissed against Chevron in Ecuador
The US District Court for the Northern District of California
dismissed complaints Aug. 3 against Chevron Corp. filed on behalf
of three Ecuadorians.
The court said the plaintiffs had fabricated claims that they or
their relative had cancer caused by the former operations of Chevron subsidiary Texaco Petroleum Co. in Ecuador.
The three plaintiffs, Gloria Chamba, Luisa Gonzales, and Gonzales’s husband, Nixon Rodriguez Crespo, were among a group of
seven Ecuadorians who brought personal injury claims against the
US major.
According to the lawsuits filed against Chevron, Chamba
claimed her son was diagnosed with leukemia, Gonzales claimed
to have been diagnosed with breast cancer, and Crespo’s claim was
for “loss of consortium” related to his wife’s cancer claim.
Judge William Alsup dismissed the personal injury claims by the
three plaintiffs finding that the two women had admitted during
cross-examination at sworn depositions that their cancer claims
were false, and thus Crespo’s claim was also without merit. ✦

The well, the eleventh exploration well on the block, was drilled
in 1,700 m of water and hit Upper Oligocene oil-bearing reservoirs.
The partners are carrying out technical studies to fully evaluate the drilling results, and they plan to carry out extra drilling
across the acreage. The consortium wants to assess the feasibility of
a first development zone in the eastern part of the block. Studies
will evaluate the development potential of the other 10 discoveries made on the block since 2003, all of which indicate its major
potential. In May Total and its partners reported the last two oil
discoveries on the block (OGJ Online, May 21, 2007).
Total holds a 30% interest in the block, and Sonangol is the concessionaire. Other partners in Block 32 are Marathon Oil Co. 30%,
Sonangol EP 20%, Esso Exploration & Production Angola (Overseas) Ltd. 15%, and Petrogal 5%.

Western Desert-Nile Delta discoveries grow
Chile’s Sipetrol International SA and Oil Search Ltd., Sydney,
are testing a third exploratory well after two oil discoveries in
the northeastern part of Egypt’s Western Desert. They plan to start
production in the third quarter of 2007. The companies’ Shahd
and Ghard discoveries 80 miles west of Cairo have proven that the
Western Desert petroleum system extends into the East Ras Qattara
concession. The companies hope to start production before the end
of 2007. Adjacent concessions have production facilities.
The Shahd-1 discovery well went to TD 3,479 m in the southwestern part of the block in late 2006 and drillstem tested 7001,000 b/d from Cretaceous Lower Bahariya and 360-600 b/d of
39-41° gravity oil from Upper Bahariya on artificial lift.
The Ghard-ST1 discovery well, 12 km northeast of Shahd-1,
flowed 2,026 b/d of 40° gravity oil and gas at the rate of 2.6
MMcfd in 2 hr on a 3⁄4-in. choke from Lower Bahariya at 3,341-47

Brunei, Total unit to spud well off Borneo
The government of Brunei and Total E&P Borneo are preparing
to spud the MLJ2-06 well 50 km off the island of Borneo.
The MLJ2-06 well is about 25 km from Champion oil field,
where Brunei Shell Petroleum Co. Sdn. Bhd. (BSP) last year reported the start of a third phase of oil production (OGJ, Jan. 16, 2007,
Newsletter).
Brunei Energy Minister Pehin Dato Awang Haji Yahya said the
MLJ2-06 well could be “one of the most challenging” ever drilled
in Southeast Asia because of high temperatures and pressures and
environmental controls.
Total’s drilling manager, Yannick Marcillat, said the MLJ2-06 is
one of Total’s most challenging wells in the region because it is
deeper and has greater pressure than the firm’s other wells.
“This particular well has a very high pressure with 17,000 psi,
and we have to be very careful when the pressure comes to the
surface,” Marcillat said. “Besides, it is hotter at 170° C. so it is a bit
complicated when we run electronic equipment as the temperature is very high for the equipment.”
The Maersk Completer jack up rig, built in Singapore and towed
to Brunei, will drill the well. It has been prepared for high-pressure, high-temperature drilling.
According to Marcillat, the rig is under a 1-year contract, with
170 days scheduled for the MLJ2-06 well and the remainder of the
time for other projects in the region. The MLJ2-06 is to be drilled
to 22,000 ft. ✦

Tui area ﬁelds start ﬂow off New Zealand
The Tui Area Development in the offshore Taranaki basin of New
Zealand has come on stream 19 months after the final investment
decision and some 3 years after discovery.
The development encompasses three adjacent oil fields about 50
km offshore. It includes production from four subsea wells incorporating extended horizontal sections in the reservoirs and connected to the Umuroa floating production, storage, and offloading
vessel.
Project operator Australian Worldwide Exploration Ltd. (AWE),
Sydney, says the production will be ramped up to a peak rate of
50,000 b/d during August and is expected to total around 10 million bbl in the first year.
Proved and probable reserves are estimated at 28 million bbl.
When fully commissioned, Tui will be New Zealand’s largest oil
producing operation.
The final cost stands at $269 million, 10% more than the previous estimate. Much of the overrun has been due to bad weather

Processing
Shell agrees to sell three French reﬁneries
Royal Dutch Shell has signed deals to sell three French refineries with a combined capacity of more than 300,000 b/d to Basell
Polyolefins, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands, and Petroplus Holdings
AG, Zug, Switzerland.
The refineries are among Shell’s smallest and oldest. Shell said
earlier this year that it was carrying out a review of nonstrategic
assets (OGJ Online, Jan. 15, 2007).
Basell has agreed to pay $700 million to Societe des Petroles
Shell to buy the 80,000 b/d Berre-l’Etang refinery site complex
and associated infrastructure in France. The deal should be completed in early 2008.
The refinery produces naphtha, LPG, fuels, bitumen, and heating oil. Basell has a steam cracker, a butadiene extraction unit, and
polypropylene and polyethylene plants adjacent to the refinery and
a polyethylene plant at nearby Fos sur Mer.
Petroplus Holdings has signed separate letters of intent with
Shell International Petroleum Co. Ltd. to acquire the Petit Couronne
and Reichstett Vendenheim refineries in France. Petroplus will pay
$875 million, including working capital of $400 million.
The parties hope to reach agreement on a sale in 2008.
The 164,000-b/cd Petit Couronne refinery, 130 km northwest
of Paris on the River Seine, produces 40% middle distillates and
20% gasoline. Its major units include crude and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, visbreaking, hydrotreating, reforming, lubricant production, and bitumen production. It receives
crude via a 70-km pipeline from the port at Le Havre. The crude
slate is about 70% high-sulfur.
The 80,000-b/cd Reichstett Vendenheim refinery is in Alsace,
France, near Strasbourg, about 5 km from the River Rhine. It produces 45% middle distillates and 20% gasoline. Major units are
crude and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, visbreaking,
hydrotreating, reforming, and bitumen production. Crude arrives
via a pipeline from Fos. The crude slate is about 45% high-sulfur.

In addition to the ProJet retail stations, Shell is looking to add
another 30 new stations by yearend.
With its existing stations, Shell expects to have about 900 Shell
retail sites throughout Malaysia by yearend, said Mohzani.

Woodside gives formal nod to Pluto LNG project
Perth-based Woodside Petroleum Ltd. has agreed to spend $11.2
billion (Aus.) to develop an LNG project using gas from its wholly
owned Pluto and Xena fields in Western Australia’s Carnarvon basin, 190 km off Karratha.
The timetable calls for first gas to be delivered by yearend
2010.
The initial phase will involve a single LNG production train having a 4.3 million tonne/year capacity on the Burrup Peninsula and
a 180 km, 36-in. subsea pipeline from the fields.
A field platform at Pluto, moored in 85 m of water, will be
connected to five subsea wells. A second phase, which will require
additional funding approval, will include compression on the platform and a tie-in to the smaller Xena field. Onshore facilities will
also include storage tanks and a marine loading terminal.
The company said that reservoir studies indicate the combined
dry gas content for Pluto and Xena has increased to 5 tcf from 4.5
tcf.
Woodside has spent about $800 million (Aus.) on preliminary
studies at the field and preparatory work at the LNG site. The additional funding just approved is higher than Woodside’s earlier
estimates of $6-10 billion.
Funding will be provided by cash flow from the company’s Australian operations along with a fully underwritten dividend reinvestment plan and the issuance of corporate debt.
The company had already preapproved $1.4 billion for longlead items and LNG plant site preparation. Earthworks began in
January.
Woodside received provisional environmental approval in June
despite its earlier having failed marine standards set by the Western Australian Environment Protection Authority. The EPA said the

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Greece, Turkey, Italy sign pact on gas pipelines
After months of negotiations, Greek, Turkish, and Italian officials
have signed an agreement to build a pipeline system to transport
natural gas from the Caucasus to Western Europe through Turkey
and Greece by 2011.
Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Hilmi Guler said
the agreement will allow Turkey to buy at a cheaper price 15% of
the gas passing through the Turkish sector of the proposed pipeline. Greece’s Minister of Development Dimitris Sioufas described
the project as “a work of strategic importance.”
The project is a system of three pipelines: one linking Greece
and Turkey that is already nearing completion, a 217-km underwater pipeline from Greece to Italy, estimated to cost €300 million;
and a 590-km pipeline connecting the western terminus of the
Greece-Turkey pipeline, in Komotini, Greece, to the eastern terminus of the Greece-Italy pipeline near the Greek port of Igoumenitsa
at a cost of more than €600 million. Total investment earlier was
estimated to exceed €1 billion and will be partly funded through
the European Union’s Fourth Community Support Framework
(2007-13).
The Turkey-Greece pipeline will have a transport capacity of 11.5
billion cu m/year of natural gas. The Greece-Italy subsea pipeline is
to have a capacity of 8-8.8 billion cu m/year. The difference is to
be channeled into the Greek gas market, as well as Albania and the
former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, officials said. Bulgaria
also has expressed interest in obtaining natural gas from Greece.
The Turkey-Greece link initially was scheduled to be completed
in June but is now expected to begin operations in late August.
Construction of the subsea Interconnector Greece-Italy (IGI) link
is to start next June with completion slated for 2011.

WestPac plans Texada Island LNG terminal
WestPac LNG Corp., Calgary, plans to invest $2 billion to build
an LNG terminal combined with a natural gas-fired electric power
generation plant on Texada Island, 120 km northwest of Vancouver,
BC. The project is expected to be operational in 2013.
Facilities will include a marine jetty and berthing facility capable of unloading and loading ships of 20,000 cu m to 165,000
cu m; possibly two onshore LNG storage tanks, each with a capacity of 165,000 cu m; a gas-fired power generation facility with a

capacity of 1,200 Mw from two trains; and an on-site interconnection with the existing Terasen gas pipeline from the mainland to
Vancouver Island.
Project design is still being finalized and could entail only one
storage tank with capacity of 200 million cu m, a WestPac spokesman told OGJ.
The company intends to file a project description with regulatory agencies later this year. Construction is scheduled to start in
2009 and continue for 3 years.
WestPac has acquired a long-term lease at Kiddie Point at the
north end of Texada Island. This proposed Texada LNG site is in an
industrial area and the site is a secure source for natural gas with
minimal environmental impact, WestPac said.
WestPac said the Texada Island project also could enhance air
quality in the Fraser Valley by allowing BC Hydro to decommission
its Burrard thermal power generator, which it currently depends
on for peak-demand power supply.
Separately, WestPac has been conducting environmental assessment work for a proposed LNG receipt and transshipment terminal at Ridley Island near Prince Rupert. The Ridley facility will not
proceed immediately, but the location could play a future role as a
second terminus to serve the north coast when gas demand reaches
new levels, WestPac said.

Sonatrach, EDP partner for Iberian gas supply
EDP Energias de Portugal SA in a public filing said a natural
gas and power generation partnership with Algeria’s state-run
Sonatrach will be in place by Oct. 31. The partnership will jointly
supply and market gas in Portugal and Spain and partner in combined-cycle gas turbine plants.
Sonatrach, keen to increase natural gas sales to Europe, will provide as much as 2 billion cu m/year of gas to EDP while taking a
25% minimum stake in the gas supply projects. It also will have
one representative on EDP’s board when the deal is formalized,
EDP said.
Other talks are said to include EDP’s possible participation in
gas plants in Algeria. Earlier this year Algeria announced a tender
of about €2.5 billion for five natural gas plants and an underwater
cable to Spain. EDP, Iberdrola SA, Enel SPA, and Endesa SA are interested in the bidding. ✦

Oil market divergences

Marilyn Radler
Senior EditorEconomics
There have been a couple of interesting divergences concerning the oil
market recently. First, two high-profile
forecasts of worldwide demand for oil
are receiving a bit of attention from
market analysts. The recent outlooks
differ as to how much oil the world
will need in the next few years. What
lies behind these differences are the assumptions of economic growth.
Also, there recently has been a divergence in the price of crude oil and the
price of gasoline at US pumps. Retail
prices of the fuel fell in late July at the
peak of driving season in the US, while
crude prices rallied above $70/bbl.
What lies behind these differences is the
same problem that has been the bottleneck in the market for about 2 years
now: refining. Also, anticipated and real
oil production disruptions and a fair
amount of speculation in the futures
markets have elevated the crude price.

Future demand
Last month the International Energy
Agency released its Medium-Term Oil
Market Report. IEA’s estimates call for
worldwide demand for oil products to
average almost 92 million b/d in 2010
and nearly 96 million b/d in 2012.
And the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries released its latest
World Oil Outlook in June. The group
looks for global oil demand in 2010 to

be just 89.7 million b/d.
This difference in forecasts deserves
noting. With the more conservative
outlook, OPEC is being cautious, keeping an eye on refinery operations and
not wanting to see prices sink as it puts
what it would consider too much oil
on the market. If the organization is
correct, then prices may be more stable
than if it is wrong. In the case that the
world does need much more oil, then
prices will spike in a very tight crude
market.
How strong the global economy is
during the next 3-5 years will heavily affect the amount of oil the world
consumes. And especially important to
demand growth will be the strength
of the economies in large developing
countries, including China and India.
Even the two groups’ forecasts for
2008 are quite different. IEA forecasts demand next year will average
2.18 million b/d more than this year.
Meanwhile, OPEC projects a 1.34 million b/d climb from this year’s average worldwide demand, as economic
growth slows.
IEA assumes that the global economy
will be strong enough to sustain oil
demand growth and that weather will
play a role. The agency expects global
oil product demand to rise by a robust
2.5% in 2008, largely due to a weatherrelated rebound in the member countries of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development and to
strong demand in non-OECD countries.
In its forecast for next year, OPEC
says that on the supply side we need to
look at the entire supply chain, as the
downstream sector is a key element for
market stability.
“Any easing in refining tightness will

depend on the evolution of refinery
capacity expansion and demand growth.
In this regard, however, more needs to
be done to make sure the downstream
sector does not lag behind, particularly
given recent announcements indicating policy pushes for an expanded use
of biofuels, furthering unease amongst
downstream investors,” OPEC said.
But OPEC is likely to continue to
protect its crude export revenues by
holding the reins on output.

Price differences
Crude and product prices typically
move in the same direction, but this
was not so over the past 2 months.
Crude reached an all-time high on
the New York Mercantile Exchange last
month. On July 31, the front-month
contract closed at $78.21/bbl for September delivery.
Retail gasoline prices were headed
lower, though. This decline came with a
long-awaited uptick in refinery utilization, which surpassed 92% by the end
of July after hovering below 90% for
most of 2007. Refinery outages indeed
have been responsible for bolstering
prices throughout 2006 and 2007.
The average regular unleaded selfservice pump price in the US on Aug.
1, 2007, was $2.918/gal. This is the
lowest since late-April, according to
OGJ statistics. Pump prices peaked at
an average of $3.176/gal on May 30,
2007, OGJ statistics show.
At the start of this month, crude
futures began to dip only after fears
grew that economic growth was slowing more than previously expected, as
equities markets weakened, and lending
activity, especially mortgages, continued
to deteriorate. ✦

(webcast section)

The webcast will discuss highlights of Oil & Gas Journal’s annual Midyear Forecast, a
special report that appeared in the July 2 edition. The Midyear Forecast uses ﬁrst-half data
to update projections that appeared in OGJ’s Annual Forecast and Review this past January.
Both reports project oil and gas markets through the end of the year worldwide, analyze
demand product by product in the US, and forecast drilling activity in the US and Canada.
The webcast, to be presented by OGJ Editor Bob Tippee, will summarize the Midyear
Forecast projections in key categories, note important changes from January’s forecasts,
and examine reasons for the adjustments. Marilyn Radler, Senior Editor-Economics, and
G. Alan Petzet, Chief Editor-Exploration, will be on hand for questions. Marilyn compiles
and writes the Midyear Forecast market projections. Alan assembles the drilling forecast.

House energy mischief
The Democrat-controlled House has given Republicans the chance to act once again as though
they believe in the fundamentals of their party. It
has passed two energy bills so breathtakingly at
odds with US needs that the job of discrediting
the nonsense should be easy. But are Republicans
up to it?
The gasoline price increases that have agitated
US energy politics into near hysteria send a simple
message that federal officials must heed: The US
needs a strong increase in its supply of affordable
energy. The country is part of a world in which
rising demand has encountered physical limits on
systems—natural and mechanical—that deliver
energy in useful forms. The strains have been aggravated by geopolitical tension, by long-standing
political limits in the US on supply-enhancing activities such as drilling and refinery construction,
and by natural disasters.

Popular demons
These are sufficient and evident reasons for
prices of petroleum products to have risen these
past few years. The popular demons that motivate
energy politics have not driven up prices. As has
been proven repeatedly, oil companies are not manipulating prices. The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries isn’t levitating crude prices,
either. Notwithstanding OPEC’s controversial
production restraint, the ability of the group’s key
members to raise output of the light, sweet crude
the market needs in fact remains limited.
Prices will ease, as they always do, when supply increases and consumption subsides. Given
the chance, the market will recreate both conditions the cheapest way possible. High prices do
not demonstrate the need for government action,
which inevitably interferes with the market’s selfcorrecting mechanisms.
Yet action by government, in deliberate subversion of the market and in direct conflict with
national need, is what the House has just passed.
The bills raise taxes on providers of oil and gas
in order to subsidize much costlier energy forms
with far less potential to boost total energy supply.
They treat as a pariah the industry that should be
investing heavily in production, refining capacity,

and pipelines if future US energy needs are to be
met. And they mandate sales of politically favored
energy types, assigning government the role of
telling individuals what to buy and producers
what to sell.
“The House propelled America’s energy policy
into the future,” crowed House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.) after the bills passed. Wrong. The
House repeated past mistakes. At enormous cost
to Americans, its mischief would keep the energy
market from evolving as it should: as an economic
process that summons into affordable use renewable and other new energy forms as essential
supplements to traditional supply, which must be
allowed to grow.
Democrats have played their ludicrous hand.
Someone now needs to remind a strangely frenzied national capital that the best energy policies
are those that rely on the free interplay of supply,
demand, and price. It’s up to Republicans, if any
of them will do it, to assert the market principles
they once claimed to believe.

President’s role
President George W. Bush should take the lead.
Nothing constructive can come from reconciliation of the House mess with a little-better energy
bill passed earlier by the Senate. Bush should
promise a veto. And he should anchor his reasons
in arguments steeped in a recommitment to a free
energy market.
This will require some backtracking. Bush set
the country on a federally charted energy course
in his 2006 state-of-union address, in which he
groaned about the country’s being “addicted to
oil” and took aim at the impossible target of ending US dependence on oil from the Middle East.
Since then, US energy policy-making has been a
mad rush after energy fantasies and federal dollars.
Bush was wrong to deploy the addiction analogy. He has erred since with his hop-scotching
mandates for ethanol and other renewable boondoggles. But he doesn’t have to say so or express
regret. He just needs to use his veto to stop a
Congress that has lost all sense on energy and to
explain himself within a market perspective that
the nation can only hope he hasn’t forgotten. ✦

The extent of methane emissions
worldwide is significant and indisputable. The economic benefits from
containing such emissions are equally
compelling. These include higher revenue from additional gas sales and labor
savings, carbon credits, and greater
process efficiency.
This article summarizes a number
of proven methods to identify, measure, and reduce
methane emissions
from a wide range

Technology drives methane
emissions down, proﬁts up

Methane emissions mitigation is of
interest not only to operators but also
to service providers, investment banks,
corporate shareholders, and the public.
Methane mitigation work has increased
as a result of a collaborative effort by
this diverse set of stakeholders.

Global emissions
While methane is a source of clean
energy, it also is a very potent greenhouse gas. Lost into the atmosphere
each year from oil and gas operations
worldwide is nearly 82 billion cu m
of methane, which equates to a loss of
about $20 billion in revenue.1 Moreover, these emissions have an equivalent
annual greenhouse gas effect comparable to adding more than 200 million
vehicles to the roadways.

Methane emissions resulting from oil
and gas production, processing, transmission, and distribution operations
can take the form of unintentional leaks
as well as venting from operational
processes. Such practices include venting from well cleanups or workovers,
reciprocating and centrifugal compressor operation, crude oil and condensate
storage tanks, and pipeline repairs. Table
1 indicates methane emission trends in
several key countries with established or
growing oil and gas infrastructures.
The US Environmental Protection
Agency projects that global methane
emissions will grow by more than
33% during 2005-15. These emissions
represent a compelling opportunity to
generate considerable additional revenue with the technologies discussed in
the balance of this article.

Mitigation options
Profitable methane emission reduction projects exist throughout the entire
gas infrastructure, from wellhead to
burner tip. Methane emission reduction
strategies generally fall into one of three
categories:
• Employing new technologies or
upgrading equipment to reduce venting
or fugitive emissions.
• Improving operational procedures.
• Enhancing management practices.
The information presented here
updates and expands on analyses previously published in OGJ on cost-effective
technologies to cut methane emissions
globally.2
Various project options such as
upgrading compressors, replacing
pneumatic devices, and conducting leak
surveys have broad applicability globally
and across the industry.
Based on EPA emissions estimates
and Energy Information Administration production estimates,3 more than
2.8% of net worldwide dry gas production is emitted to the atmosphere. Each
emissions source represents unrealized
revenue. Table 2 provides information
on proven, cost-effective technologies
and practices that have broad applicability in addressing major sources of
methane emissions from oil and gas
operations. Investment costs for these
technologies and processes range from
$0 to $324,000, with payback periods
ranging from immediate to 21 months.
Operators can recover their investments
through a number of economic channels, including gas sales revenue, carbon
credit revenue, on-site fuel use, reduced
labor costs, reduced capital replacement
costs, lower environmental permitting costs, and reduced environmental
impact. Project examples were selected
from representative successful field
implementations for specific emissions
sources. In each case, operators identify
emissions sources, quantify the product
loss, and apply off-the-shelf, mature
solutions to recover methane.

Tanks
Crude oil and gas condensate
production field tanks hold petroleum
liquids briefly to stabilize flow or for
trucking or pipeline transportation to
processing and refinery sites. During
storage, light hydrocarbons dissolved in
the crude oil—including methane—vaporize or “flash” and vent to the atmosphere from fixed-roof field production
tanks. When uncontrolled, these tanks
vent 0.2-1.2 cu m/year of methane/bbl
of crude oil and condensate.
One way to capture tank emissions
is to install vapor recovery units (VRUs)
on oil and condensate storage tanks.
VRUs are relatively simple compression

systems that can recover about 95% of
tank vapors for sale or for use on site
as fuel. Since tank vapors also include
hydrocarbons heavier than methane, on
a volumetric basis, the recovered vapors
can be more valuable than methane
alone. A VRU project under way by Occidental de Colombia (Oxy) illustrates
how methane and nonmethane tank
vapors can represent economic opportunity.
Oxy’s Cano Limon facilities in Colombia produce 35 million bbl/year of
crude oil that flows through production
site tanks, emitting about 166,000 cu
m/year of methane. Oxy identified this
product loss and is now modifying its

facilities to include VRU and booster
compressors to boost vapors to a high
pressure (Fig. 1).
Following compression, existing air
coolers lower the stream temperature to
ambient temperature. The compressed
vapor then expands through a valve into
a scrubber, which reduces the stream to
subambient temperature and condenses
the heavier components. Condensed
liquids are blended with the crude oil,
and noncondensable vapor, including

methane, is flared.
The feasibility study estimates vapor
recovery and booster compressor
investments of about $1.57 million for
equipment costs. Operating and maintenance costs are estimated at $805,000/
year. For its investment, Oxy will benefit
from an estimated incremental 360,000
bbl/year of condensate blended into the
crude, worth about $18 million/year
at a nominal $50/bbl. The project also
eliminates methane venting from tanks.

Compressors are a logical focus
area for methane emissions due to the
variety of emissions encountered with
operation of these units. Both reciprocating and centrifugal compressors potentially vent methane when taken out
of service. Both compressor types also
lose methane through the seal between
the driver shaft and compression case.
Many centrifugal compressors are
configured with oil seals, called “wet
seals,” at the point where the rotating
driver shaft exits the high pressure case.
Wet seal systems circulate oil across
the seals to create a barrier between
compressed gas and the atmosphere.
Although these are very good seals, the
seal oil absorbs methane and must be
degassed to maintain viscosity and lubricity. The methane-rich gas is normally vented to the atmosphere at remote
field locations. A single wet seal centrifugal compressor can vent as much as
1.8 million cu m/year of methane.
Wet seals can be replaced with “dry”
seals, which provide the same barrier
to high pressure gas leakage with lower
operating and maintenance costs and
lower methane emissions. Each dry seal
upgrade reduces methane emissions by

METHANE LEAK RATES FOR
DIFFERENT FACILITY TYPES

25

Component leaks
All valves, flanges, connections,
open-ended lines, and other components in the gas infrastructure are
potential sources of methane emissions
(Table 3). Unintended component
leaks develop over time in response
to temperature fluctuations, pressure,
corrosion, mechanical vibration, defective installation, and wear. These leaks
are usually invisible and odorless and
therefore go unnoticed. The very large
number of components with individually small leaks compound into significant methane losses.
One proven solution for addressing
these leaks is implementing a directed
inspection and maintenance (DI&M)
program. DI&M is a proven, cost-effective way to detect, measure, prioritize,
and repair equipment leaks to reduce
methane emissions. A DI&M program begins with a baseline survey to
identify and quantify leaks. Subsequent
surveys are based on data from previous
surveys, allowing operators to concentrate on the components that are most
likely to leak and are profitable to repair.
Several leak screening techniques are
commercially available, ranging from
a soap solution to infrared leak imaging cameras (Table 4). Baseline survey
results typically show that the large majority of fugitive methane emissions are
from a relatively small number of leaking components that can be targeted for
monitoring. A simple investment in labor yields benefits of increased production or throughput, reduced emissions,
and potential carbon credits.
With these DI&M concepts in mind,

Washington Correspondent
The US House of Representatives
passed a pair of energy bills Aug. 4 that
Democrats said would greatly accelerate
energy efficiency and alternative development efforts. Republicans charged
that the measures are mislabeled because they would place additional limits
on currently available resources, drive
energy costs higher, and produce no
new domestic supplies.
“Plainly put, the so-called energy
bills before us tonight contain not a
single watt of new energy—and worse,
actually seek to lock away the scarce
resources we have available right now,”
maintained Republican Whip Roy Blunt
(Mo.). HR 3221 passed by 241 to 172
votes and heads to conference with
the Senate. A companion measure, HR
2776, which contains taxes and other
revenue-raising actions to fund new
energy initiatives, was passed by 221
to 189 votes separately and combined
with the larger bill.
The administration immediately announced that senior advisers would recommend that President George W. Bush

domestic oil and gas production and
increase dependence on imported oil.”
House Republicans indicated they
have enough votes to sustain a veto.
“This bill isn’t going anywhere,” said
Joe Barton (R-Tex.), the Energy Committee’s ranking minority member, who
added that he was not even sure there
would be an attempt to conference the
bill with the other body.
Floor debate was delayed by a day
on Aug. 3 as Republicans protested the
manner in which a vote to recommit
the farm bill was handled the night
before and technicians tried to repair a
vote display system malfunction. Members returned ready to tackle the energy
bills on Aug. 4.

Roan Plateau language
HR 3221 retained language that Colorado Democrats John Salazar and Mark
Udall persuaded the Rules Committee
to insert that would prohibit surface
activity on the Roan Plateau near Grand
Junction if the US Bureau of Land
Management issues leases there. They
said this was a compromise because it
did not ban leasing entirely, but other
members and oil and gas and consuming industry groups said it effectively
would lock up 9 tcf of natural gas.
The bill also kept provisions that
Udall promoted from HR 2337 that
would impose new requirements for
handling produced water, delay oil

shale leasing authorized under the 2005
Energy Policy Act, and expand surface
land holders’ rights in split-estate situations involving the federal government.
Also retained in the main bill were
provisions requiring the US Minerals
Management Service to conduct at least
550 oil and gas lease audits annually
and requiring holders of Gulf of Mexico
deepwater leases erroneously issued
without price thresholds in 1998-99
to renegotiate terms or be barred from
future lease sales.
The final bill also contained provisions from HR 2776 that would deny a
general manufacturing tax deduction to
oil and gas companies, move geological
and geophysical cost amortization for
certain major oil companies back to 7
from 5 years, and rewrite the foreign
tax credit for US oil and gas companies.
As Democrats emphasized the bills’
provisions dealing with alternatives and
efficiency, Republicans said the measures would unfairly penalize traditional
energy sources.
“There’s a war going on against fossil fuels and I don’t know why,” said
Ralph M. Hall (D-Tex.), chief minority
member of the Science and Technology
Committee. He said it makes no sense to
punish the oil and gas industry, hinder
the nuclear power industry, and refuse to
develop clean coal. “We need to develop
new technologies, but it’s not going to
happen next year or in 10 years.”

Industry reactions
Oil and gas industry associations
immediately condemned the legislation.
The American Petroleum Institute called
it “the wrong prescription for a secure
energy future. It would discourage production of the energy Americans must
have to maintain a thriving economy
with strong job creation and improving
living standards.”
Independent Petroleum Association
of America Pres. Barry Russell said, “The
House energy bill ignores the stark
reality that by 2030, oil and gas are
projected to account for more than 60%
of America’s total energy mix.”
Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States spokesman Jon
Bargas added, “It’s especially harmful
to the thousands of small, independent
energy producers who drill 90% of the
wells in the US and produce 82% of the
nation’s natural gas.”
National Petrochemical & Refiners Association Executive Vice-Pres.
Charles T. Drevna warned, “These bills
turn back the clock by raising taxes on
America’s oil and gas industry, imposing onerous fees and additional restrictions on domestic energy production,
and threatening to halt domestic production by nullifying existing contracts.
Such policies will drive energy production and petrochemical businesses
overseas.” ✦

Analyst sees end to Iranian gasoline crisis by 2012
Iran’s potentially destabilizing
shortage of gasoline will ease by 2012,
according to a veteran observer of the
country’s oil industry.
Fereidun Fesharaki, chairman and
chief executive officer of FACTS Global
Energy, says additions to refining capacity totaling 705,000 b/d during 200812 will eliminate Iran’s strong reliance
on imported gasoline. The capacity
additions include three condensate
splitters with 55% gasoline yield at
Bandar Abbas.
30

With demand for gasoline, which is
heavily subsidized, rising at 10-11%/year
recently, the Iranian government in May
increased prices of the product by 25%
and in late June imposed rationing. The
latter move caused riots in major cities
(OGJ, July 9, 2007, p. 17).
In a report this month, Fesharaki says
the government is under pressure to
raise the price of gasoline sold beyond
ration limits to international levels,
about five times the current price, by
September.

Following the government crackdown in May and June, he adds, smuggling of about 40,000 b/d of gasoline
out of the country ceased. Iranian gasoline now is being smuggled to Iraq.
Last year, the Islamic republic imported about 192,000 b/d of gasoline.
In the first week of May, Iranian gasoline demand averaged 496,000 b/d.
Fesharaki expects Iran eventually
to export 100,000-250,000 b/d of
gasoline while fuel oil exports drop to
50,000 b/d in 2012 from 250,000 b/d

in 2006 once planned refinery projects
are complete.
The analyst projects additions to
crude distillation capacity by 2012 of
80,000 b/d at Arak, a total of 420,000
b/d at Bandar Abbas, 120,000 b/d at
Isfahan, 50,000 b/d at Tabriz, 21,000
b/d at Lavan, and 14,000 b/d at Shiraz.
He forecasts additions of processing
capacities related to gasoline, such as
catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming,
and pentane-hexane isomerization, at
those and other refineries.

Upstream work
Fesharaki notes a series of delays and
cost overruns in major oil field development projects related to the buyback
contracts under which foreign partners
must work and to inefficiencies in the
Iranian regulatory system.
Despite modest changes to the buyback contracts, he says, terms remain
unattractive by international standards.
Furthermore, because of US pressure and political instability, international banks won’t back Iranian energy
projects. Last year, Iran produced 4.07
million b/d of crude and condensate
from capacity estimated at 4.3 million b/d. Recent production gains have
mostly been condensate from offshore
South Pars field.
Production-decline rates are about
8%/year onshore and as high as 13%/year
offshore. Despite the steep production
declines and problems with oil field
development, Fesharaki expects crude
and condensate production capacity to
reach 4.7 million b/d by 2012, almost
all from South Pars.
Although Iran’s gas reserves estimate
of 993 tcf is second only to Russia’s, the
analyst sees a ceiling of 20-30 million
tonnes/year on Iranian gas exports via
LNG and pipeline.
He cites domestic demand kept high
by subsidy pricing, oil field needs for
gas injection of about 10 bcfd, large
gas-based petrochemical projects, the
use of compressed natural gas to supplement gasoline supplies, and political
opposition to gas exports (OGJ, May 9,
2004, p. 34). ✦

BP to revamp company after disappointing earnings
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
BP PLC must improve its operational
performance to boost its profits, said
BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward, at a
press conference in London to present
the company’s second-quarter results.
Hayward, who was appointed to
the role in May, admitted that BP’s
operational performance “is not good
enough.” He said, “The absolute numbers are large, but on most key measures our competitive performance in
32

the first half was disappointing.”
Hayward is determined to enforce
change by yearend and build on the
momentum in 2008. The company
has suffered delays in major projects
coming on stream and outages at its US
refineries, which have contributed to
poor performance.
BP produced 3.8 million boe/d in
this year’s second quarter, which was
5% lower than last year. The E&P segment made $6.5 billion in profit compared with $7.3 billion for the same
period in 2005. BP attributed the fall to

lower production volumes, increased
integrity spend, and higher costs.
No change was made to the production guidance which remains at 3.8-3.9
million boe/d for 2007.

New Hayward agenda
Hayward is keen to turn around
the company’s safety culture following
the critical report issued by the Baker
Panel, which investigated the fire and
explosion at its 460,000 b/d Texas
City, Tex., refinery that killed 15 people
and injured 180 others (OGJ Online,

Mar. 26, 2007). “We are implementing the Baker Panel recommendations,”
Hayward said. Furthermore, he said, the
company will implement a group-wide
operating management system that will
improve the capability and consistency
of its operations.
The benefit of the training program
is to establish a common management

system across the group, he explained.
BP’s previous internal program ‘Getting
HSE right’ is being revamped to address
process safety, which had been identified as a major omission in BP’s safety
culture under the Baker Panel report.
Developing people is also another
priority under Hayward’s tenure. He has

people—25% of BP’s staff in its London headquarters—redeployed in the
field. These will be planners who will
go back to petroleum engineering. The
emphasis, for BP, is to “have the right
people in the right place—and keeping
those people in position longer.”
Hayward admitted that a lack of
in-house engineering experience was a
major reason behind the problems with
Thunder Horse field in deepwater Gulf
of Mexico.
BP is retrieving and rebuilding all
seabed production equipment after
tests showed metallurgical failure (OGJ
Online, Sept. 16, 2006).
Andy Inglis, head of exploration and
production, said Thunder Horse is on
track to start up by yearend 2008. “We
are making good progress against this
target,” he said.
The semisubmersible platform
weighs more than 50,000 tons and is
designed to process 250,000 b/d of oil
and 200 MMscfd of gas.

Revenues will be restored by bringing the refineries in the US back to
capacity and starting up major projects,
Hayward said.
The 405,000 b/d Whiting refinery
is expected to return to full capacity
in the first half of next year, BP said.
“Repairs are ongoing and we expect to
resume sour crude processing in the
fourth quarter of 2007.” BP refineries at
Carson City, Texas City, and Toledo also
had unplanned maintenance stoppages
and production problems, causing the
company to lose out on refining opportunities when margins are at an all-time
high for the industry.
BP’s refining and marketing section
increased profits by 48% to $2.7 billion
this quarter, including a gain of $770
million for nonoperating items, mainly
related to Coryton disposal gains, said
Chief Financial Officer Byron Grote.
The company said it is confident it can
improve the performance of its refinery
portfolio.

Rising industry costs
However, Hayward added that
increasing industry costs in the supply
chain and higher depreciation charges
will likely lessen BP’s earnings. Industry
costs are rising at 10%/year “with expenses a bit less and capital a bit more,”
according to Hayward. BP will manage

industry costs through standardization
of designs, standardized equipment
lists, and a focus on continuity and
consistency.
“We want to take standardized
designs that are repeatable,” he said.
“We have done this in Azerbaijan and
Trinidad and want to do this in Egypt

and Angola.” Hayward explained that
building a standardized equipment list
meant using a limited number of components that could fit into its design. As
for continuity and consistency, he said
the company had seen a dramatic learning curve in handling key infrastructure

CRE sees no massive shift to open natural gas markets
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
The July 1 opening of gas and electricity markets in Europe jumped to 12
million from 680,000 the number of
French customers who can select their
gas suppliers, but the Energy Regulatory
Commission (CRE) foresees no massive
shift to the open market.
CRE Pres. Philippe de Ladoucette
said expansion will be slow because
the market is concentrated in the hands
of historic suppliers Gaz de France,
Total SA, and Electricite de France. In
addition, government regulated tariffs
available to all consumers compete successfully with market prices.
France imports 98% of the gas it
consumes, mainly under long-term
supply contracts hitched to the price
of oil products. For consumers to fully
benefit from an open market, more
efficient and transparent price signals
are needed that reflect the medium
and long-term investments required
to increase production and network
infrastructures.
CRE insists development of interconnections and new points of entry
for gas imports are indispensable to
help new entrants gain access to the
French market. New tariff proposals
that became effective at the start of this
year are providing inducements for
investment in the transport network.
These tariffs are adapted to the specific
features of two network operators,
GDF’s subsidiary GRTgaz (Gestionnaire
de Reseau de Transport) and Total’s TIGF
(Total Infrastructure Gaz France) that

together control 89% of gas imports
into France, 83% for GDF and 6% for
Total.
CRE said LNG could become a significant alternative with five methane
terminals to be commissioned by 201112 by competitors of GDF and Total.

European cooperation

CRE and its German counterpart
Bundesnetzagentur together chair the
working group dealing with interconnections and primary gas transport
capacities. Priority is given to Taisnieres

Its oil income, nefariously out of

militarism, and that, in turn, is being
used to acquire even more oil wealth.
Recent reports say Russia is ready
to start production of a new submarine-based intercontinental ballistic
missile that will form the core of the
country’s seaborne nuclear arsenal.

Besides the Pearsall shale, TXCO

3D seismic guides Arkoma basin Fayetteville play
Drilling and 3D seismic surveying
are ramping up in the Arkoma basin
Fayetteville shale gas play in Arkansas.
Southwestern Energy Co., Houston,
which held 1,400 sq miles of net acreage in the play as of June 30, has shot
145 sq miles of 3D surveys and expects
to have 400 sq miles of 3D surveys by
yearend.
The company, which plans capital
spending of $950 million in the play
this year, including gathering systems,
will focus most of its development
drilling in areas identified as “better
performing” and with 3D seismic coverage. It also is forming a preference for
slickwater fracs.
Southwestern’s net Fayetteville shale
production averaged 105 MMcfd in
the first 6 months of 2007, and its
gross operated production reached 200
MMcfd on July 28. That included 10
MMcfd from five wells producing from
conventional reservoirs in four pilot
areas.
As of June 30, Southwestern had
drilled and completed 303 operated
wells, 246 of which are horizontal. Of
the horizontal wells, 219 were fracturestimulated with slickwater or crosslinked gel fluids.
The wells are in 33 pilot areas in
eight counties from Franklin County
east to northwestern White County,
largely east of the traditional Arkoma
basin gas producing fairway. The company runs 19 rigs, including 15 capable
40

of drilling horizontal sections.
Southwestern drilled and completed
62 operated Fayetteville wells in the
quarter ended June 30. Excluding wells
drilled vertically in new areas to gather
reservoir data before horizontal drilling, they averaged $2.9 million/well,
2,550-ft laterals, and 18 drilling days.
Costs may increase as the company
drills longer laterals, Southwestern said.
Ten of the second quarter wells had
laterals longer than 3,000 ft.
One well, Bartlett 2-27 in the South
Rainbow pilot area, had a 3,700-ft
lateral, flowed 4.4 MMcfd after an
eight-stage slickwater frac, and was

making 4 MMcfd on July 21 after being
on production 25 days.
The last 10 wells Southwestern
completed using slickwater fluids have
averaged initial rates of 2.6 MMcfd, and
three exceeded 4 MMcfd. One of those,
Reaper 1-12 in the Bull pilot area,
which had a 2,000-ft lateral and a fourstage completion, made 4.6 MMcfd, the
company’s highest daily rate to date.
Southwestern’s Fayetteville play position includes 699,000 undeveloped
acres, 76,000 net acres held by Fayetteville shale production, and 125,000
net acres held by conventional production. ✦

Using indices to
Drilling
describe and compare
drilling complexity and
analyzing the efficiency of the energy
applied to formations while drilling can
improve performance.
The first part of this series reviewed
the two main predictive models used
to evaluate drilling costs in the US Gulf
of Mexico: the joint association survey
(JAS) and the mechanical risk index
(MRI; OGJ, Aug. 6, 2007, p. 39).
This second part of the survey on
drilling cost and complexity estimation
models reviews the indices used to
characterize the complexity of drilling
directional and extended-reach wells:
the directional difficulty index (DDI)
and difficulty index (DI).
This article reviews the structural
basis of the models and their underlying assumptions.
Recently, use of the concept of
mechanical specific energy (MSE) in
drilling workflows has improved bit efficiency and performance by identifying
specific limiters and then reengineering the process. This article highlights
advances in use of the MSE to manage
and quantify the drilling process.
46

The final part of this series will
present a new approach to estimating
drilling costs that combines regressionbased techniques as employed in the
JAS with the multidimensional attributes of drilling, as incorporated in the
MRI, DDI, and DI models.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

measure it may be useful to compare
the various factors that impact drilling.
Unfortunately, there is no basis to
the weight assessment beyond subjective reasoning. The weight functions
vary with one or more factors and may
be more robust than the drilling factors
employed in the MRI, but the weights
are not calibrated with empirically
derived data.
The DI weight functions are userdefined, similar to the DDI and MRI
metrics, and this limits the application
of the formula since the weights are not
supported by empirical analysis.
It is possible in theory to discriminate among wells on the basis of the
tactics employed in drilling, since some
of these tactics may be observable, but
frequently, most of the tactics are not
reported or available for analysis.

MSE history
The concept of mechanical specific
energy was defined by Simon7 and Teal8
to quantify the efficiency of the energy
used to destroy a given volume of rock.
MSE has been used to evaluate the efficiency of drill bits,9 postwell performance analysis,10 and most recently, as
a real-time tool to maximize the rate of
penetration and obtain a more objective
assessment of drilling efficiency.11-14
Drilling rates are often constrained
by factors that the driller does not
control and in ways that cannot be
documented. Dupriest13 classifies factors
that determine ROP into two categories: factors that create inefficiency or
“founder,” and factors that limit energy
input. The three causes of founder are
bit balling, bottomhole balling, and
vibrations.
Bit balling occurs when material accumulation within the cutting structure
interferes with the transfer of energy to
the rock. Bottomhole balling is a condition in which the build up of material
on the bottom of the hole interferes
with the transfer of energy from the bit
to the rock beneath it.
Both conditions inhibit transfer of
a portion of the WOB to the cutting
structure, lower the depth of cut, and

loses cutting efficiency. Whirl refers
to lateral vibrations, stick slip refers
to torsional vibration, and bit bounce

Other factors may also limit energy

ence the performance measures. Several
methods exist to quantify drilling cost
and complexity, which attempt to
balance the variability involved in the
operation with the uncertainty of selecting relevant factors in constructing a
descriptive model.
The JAS and MRI are commonly employed in the Gulf of Mexico but relatively little attention has been devoted
to the structural basis of the procedures
or reliability of the assessment. There
have been recent advances, however, in
using the MSE to manage and quantify
the drilling process. ✦

Operations personnel study the performance of successful wells to identify
success factors and to duplicate the
success. The tendency has developed to
use the bit, bottomhole assembly, and
directional steering system in offset or
similar wells.14

Now that fieldbus is used in virtually
all new refineries, oil and gas companies are looking beyond the older,
established products and their problems
to more modern fieldbus hardware
solutions that promise to make installations even more reliable, productive,
and efficient. This article discusses the
advantages and problems with new
developments in fieldbus.

Fieldbus developments improve
process control system operations
Harry Wilson
MooreHawke
North Hills, Calif.

Ten years ago, the oil and gas industry pioneered fieldbus installations
and helped in development and testing
of fieldbus hardware and software. Its
participation paid off in that fieldbus
moved beyond demonstration and

end result of a fieldbus installation had
so many benefits.
Typical benefits of projects using
fieldbus are faster start-ups, higher
sustained operating levels, and fewer
unscheduled outages. Additionally,
planned outages are rarer and take less
time.
Most of these benefits result from effective use of the information available
from the intelligent fieldbus devices
and systems. Fieldbus technology also
provides the ability to put control in
the field and to run unattended operations, such as oil platforms. Some
fieldbus-based oil platforms connect to
a land-based central control system via
wireless and run completely unattended
for weeks at a time.
Fieldbus also eliminates the need to
adjust, tune, and calibrate instruments
in the field. Instead, maintenance personnel can perform instrument calibrations and diagnostics from the control

where virtually all new operations are

During the initial phases of fieldbus,

Vendors were more concerned with
ironing out the bugs and making the
systems work than they were in pushing
fieldbus technology. Users and vendors
alike learned to live with the drawbacks
and difficulties of fieldbus because the

Problems
Fieldbus systems based on
10-year-old technology often cause
several operations
and maintenance
headaches, including:
• Installation
and start-up.
• Surviving
short circuits.
• Removing
and replacing
instruments.
• Operating in
hazardous environments.
• Redundancy
in critical loops.
One of the
most baffling operational problems
over the past 10
years occurred
during start-ups,
when technicians couldn’t get
the instruments
to work over the
fieldbus connection. In many
cases, it was a
simple installation
problem: The segment was over- or
underterminated.
All fieldbus segments must be
properly terminated to prevent
communications
errors through signal reflections.

The problem was eliminated with
development of device couplers with
automatic segment terminators. The
automatic segment terminator greatly
assists in segment commissioning by
eliminating the issue of over or underterminating.
If multiple field device couplers
are used, the autoterminator is always
activated at the farthest unit, and automatically migrates up the segment if a
coupler is disconnected.

Nicosia, Cyprus
While plants continually become
more complex, chemical engineers,
with the advent of computers and
commercial off-the-shelf simulation
software, can now successfully redesign
processes and control systems much
faster and better than in the past.
Technology used to optimize material flows and increase plant throughput, maximize equipment efficiency,
review resource use, and enhance
planning and logistics, is now mature.
Furthermore, access to experimental
data, integrated solutions and “what-if”
scenarios is easier and more valuable
than ever before.
This article explores some of the
process modeling techniques used with
emphasis on dynamic simulation.
Chemical engineers can perform
difficult calculations in a short time and

and accuracy of results are paramount,
the following questions constantly arise:
• Are the thermodynamics and the
reactor kinetics correct?
• Are the data correct? Do we understand the control scheme?
• Are there any smart methods to
perform the allocated tasks in less time?
Understanding unit operations,
questioning the model-obtained results,
and asking questions to the more
experienced engineers are the strongest requirements for success in using
dynamic simulations for process control
and design.

Process modeling
Using first principle, rigorous
models allows engineers to simulate
any process in great detail and analyze
scenarios and situations that, in the real
plant, would be difficult to monitor or
are dangerous. For plants that are being
designed, one must:
• Demonstrate overall controllability, safe operability, reliability, and the
adequacy of process for all start-up,
operating, transient, and shutdown
conditions.
• Meet regulatory demands for
emissions and depressurizing.
• Test and accept the plant’s DCS and
emergency shutdown schemes.
• Develop operating procedures and
train the operators to maximize production and quickly react to abnormal
situations.
Conversely, for existing plants, engineers are typically required to:

• Maximize production and debottleneck specific plant areas.
• Verify that a planned DCS update
will be smooth with minimal process
disruptions and ensure that new automations and sequences will operate as
intended.
• Improve control strategies and
implement advanced control.
• Financially optimize the costs to
the added-value balance.
In this article, we first review the
process modeling requirements for
some of these obstacles. This article
also examines the differences between
standard steady-state process simulation
and dynamic modeling.
Finally, the article also reviews special
requirements of modeling for dynamic
studies or a detailed checkout of the
DCS logic and control loops.

Steady-state,
dynamic modeling
Steady-state modeling means that
the modeled process is solved only for a
specific set of operating conditions. This
is like a snapshot of the unit operation.
Any change in the plant conditions
requires solving the model again. After
converging, the model should predict
where the process will settle.
On the other hand, dynamic modeling provides information about the
unit operation over time. All variables
are solved at each time step and at any
specific time that the process conditions
are monitored. Compared to the steadystate “snapshot” equivalent, dynamic

that provide the ability to model and
optimize the plant (engineering suites,
point solutions) or the whole enterprise
(supply chain, demand planning, etc.).
These products have matured; they are
not “engineering tools” any more, but
commercial off-the-shelf products,
ready to be used.
Currently:
• The main driving force behind major product development is model reuse
and its ability to be used for the plant’s
entire life.
• Interactions of the major engineering suites with the “environment”
become standardized.
• Upward product compatibility is
maintained.
• Connectivity with external or client-delivered models and applications is
achievable using a variety of tools (Dll,
OPC, MS Excel, VBA, Fortran, C++, C#)
is provided.
• Windows-based systems take up
the space previously reserved exclusively by UNIX.
• Rival products exploit standard
connectivity. Using the proper API calls
or the proper model export and import
facilities (text, xml) and some programming or scripting, one may use models
under a competing product suite.
• Modeling is becoming a commodity. Only web-based technologies
supported by major groups seem to
be those that will survive in the longer
term. ✦

A new method for
determining the maximum shutdown time of
a waxy crude oil pipeline
is not only more accurate
and flexible, but can also
Pipelines
yield substantial savings
in heating costs compared to the subjective methods employed before a pipeline enters service.
Pipeline operators often heat waxy
crude lines to ensure safe and economic transport.1 Shutdowns may occur
regularly for operational reasons and
occasionally for such emergencies as
pipe ruptures.2 Shutdowns lower the
temperature of the oil, increasing its
viscosity and strengthening its thixotropic tendencies,3 the combination of
which requires a large start-up pressure.
Start-up pressure exceeding the capacity
of the pipe could lead to pipe failure,
resulting in potentially large economic
losses.4
Increasing heating temperature
before a planned shutdown can help
ensure a successful restart. An accidental
shutdown, however, requires that restart
occur before a predetermined maximum shutdown time has elapsed. This
time can be increased by heating the
line after the shutdown has occurred.
The operator must, however, return the
pipeline to service before reaching the
MST, even if it means incurring such associated risks as soil contamination.
For large-throughput hot oil pipelines, however, reducing the heating
temperature even slightly may save a
great amount of fuel,4 creating a potential conflict with the desire to maximize
MST. How to save fuel while ensuring
reliable and safe operations therefore
becomes an important question.

Background
China has subjectively established
different MSTs for different seasons for
different hot waxy crude pipelines,5 6
with little attention given to the MST’s
rationality. Subjective determination is
necessary and practical for a new pipeline. Continued use of the same MST
for many years, however, exposes the

pipeline to both potential inefficiencies
and potential safety concerns.
New developments in emergency
tools and technology have also greatly
reduced the time required to deal with
an accident, further increasing the need
to reevaluate MST for hot waxy crude
pipelines.
This article accounts for the uncertain duration of an accidental shutdown
and proposes an accident
response reliability index
to assess how individual
accidents are handled.
Simple methods use this
index to determine and
evaluate the MST of hot
waxy oil pipelines in
operation for a few years. A case study
then illustrates these methods and the
results are analyzed. Results show that
the proposed methods can both save
fuel and ensure effective response to accidents during pipeline operation.

Waxy crude shutdown
method yields savings

Accident index
The longer the time available to deal
with an accident, the more likely it is
to be addressed successfully, with the
reverse also holding true. The relationship between the required time and the
available time to deal with accidents can
therefore characterize the success with
which pipeline accidents are addressed,
yielding an accident response reliability
index.
Equation 1 defines and calculates the
index, R, which in turn represents the
probability of successfully addressing
a pipeline accident. A large R means a
high probability that the accident will
be effectively addressed.

Determining MST
Many factors influence the time
required to deal with an accident: its
location, type, etc.7 Most of these factors are uncertain and stochastic. It is
very complex, perhaps even impossible,
quantitatively to investigate the relationship between the time required to deal
with an accident and its factors. But

heating consumptions for both a 21
and 30-hr MST. The 5 30-hr MST
months represented two groups,
divided according to environmental
conditions. Group A includes June and
October. Group B includes July, August,
and September. The pressure at restart
determined safe pumping temperature,
replacing the more conventional pourpoint temperature method of reaching
this determination.9 10
Reducing MST to 21 hr from 30
hr can save 341.8 GJ/day of heating
consumption in June and October at a
throughput of 19,200 tons/day (Table
5). Heat supplied by oil with a heating value of 44.1 × 106 J/kg would
therefore save 7.75 tons/day of oil in
June and October, for a total saving during the 2 months of 472 tons. A similar
reduction of MST for July, August, and
September would save 200.3 GJ/day; or
4.54 tons/day of oil, for a total savings
of about 417 tons of oil.
Reducing MST to 21 hr from 30 hr
would save a total of 889 tons of oil
over the 5 months studied, demonstrating that the 30-hr MST in place was
uneconomical.

null hypothesis H0; the actual accidental shutdown time meets the normal
distribution.
Equation 5 can calculate the ARRI
for the studied pipeline with a given
shutdown time.
Iterative calculation yielded a 21-hr
shutdown time based on the safety requirement of 0.999 and the accidental
shutdown time records.
The safety requirements of a pipeline
operator also affect the length of MST
determined by the proposed method.
Different MSTs for the pipeline studied
in this article satisfied different safety
requirement levels of the operator (Table 3). A safety requirement of 0.9999
needed a 23-hr MST, while only 18 hr
were needed to meet a safety requirement of 0.99.

MST rationality
Shutdowns of 20 hr MST occurred
68

on the pipeline in January, February,
March, April, May, November, and December; 30-hr MST shutdowns in June,
July, August, September, and October.6
Table 4 lists the ARRI for the MSTs.
An ARRI of 0.998 existed for the
20-hr MST, a deviation of only 0.001
from the objective value of 0.999. The
20-hr MST therefore satisfied basic
safety requirements and was reasonable
in terms of fuel economy. The fact that
no accidents had failed to be properly
resolved due to a lack of time in the
past 33 years further proved that a 20hr MST was sufficient.
An ARRI of 1.000 existed for the 30hr MST. Although it had the same deviation of 0.001, a 21-hr MST was proven
by further calculations to be enough to
realize the safety requirement of 0.999,
making a 30-hr MST unnecessary.

New wireless integrated pressure switch, receiver
The Meriam/ADALET wireless integrated pressure switch and receiver has
been added to this firm’s line of electrical
enclosure, instrumentation, and accessory
products.
The wireless system is suited for pressure measurement applications such as
tank levels, power generation, process control, flow monitoring, and pipelines. The
system utilizes license-free frequency hopping spread spectrum technology, as well
as AES encryption, to protect data integrity
with a secure and accurate signal.
The integrated pressure switch’s transmitter, contained in a transparent polycarbonate antenna dome, provides unhindered data transmission as far as 3,000 ft.
With as much as 500 mW of transmission
power available, the switch is powerful
enough for applications that require constant monitoring, the company says.

Real heroes
make their own
fuel choices
Why can’t movie stars at least try to live
up to their on-screen heroism?
Matt Damon is good, really good, as
Jason Bourne in the movie series named
for his character—an amnesiac government
assassin trying to reconstruct his life while
former comrades with nasty secrets chase
him from continent to continent.
Damon has a vexed scowl that ﬁts the
part like a 9 mm pistol and fake passports

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

ﬁt that safety deposit box in Zurich his
character somehow doesn’t forget in The
Bourne Identity, ﬁrst in the series. It says,
“I know I’m about to remember something
important about myself, but ﬁrst I need to
outrun, outsmart, outﬁght, and eventually
blow to public smithereens the killer chasing me, from whose twisted and bloodied
corpse I’ll stalk away wondering if I should
know his name.”
Bourne has more humanity than you
expect in someone who once sneaked up
on people at night with murderous intent.
Damon ﬂourishes in the contradiction.
So why does he—just before the third
thriller in the series opens—spoil the illusion by acting in real life like a helpless
wimp?
Damon and fellow actor Ben Afﬂeck
appear in video clips produced recently by
the Center for American Progress Action
Fund summoning government to action on
energy against villainous “big oil.”
Dressed as a gasoline pump, Damon
calls on Congress and big oil to “mandate
cleaner cars and cleaner fuel.” Very unBourne-like, he says: “A little bit of corn and
a pinch of can-do attitude is all it takes. And
kids love it, too. Yippee!”
Afﬂeck, playing an ear of corn, promises
to bring down big oil, portrayed with astonishing inaccuracy as bullying ethanol out of
the fuel market.
As Bourne, Damon is independence personiﬁed, ever able, for example, to make a
time bomb just when he needs one out of a
toaster and magazine.
As himself, Damon invests his reputation in a pitiful plea for governance entitled
Clean My Ride, Flex My Fuel.
This is no reason to skip The Bourne
Ultimatum, of course. But Bourne will have
to be extra self-reliant to overcome what
Damon has done to him.

Loss followed record high prices
The front-month crude contract ended the trading week through Aug. 3 with a 2%
loss after setting record highs in earlier sessions on the New York market.
The September contract for US light, sweet crudes hit an intraday high of $78.28/
bbl July 31 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, buoyed by news that US consumer conﬁdence hit a 6-year high in the second quarter. It closed at a record high of
$78.21/bbl, up $1.38 for the same day. The previous record closing for a front-month
crude contract was $77.03/bbl on July 14, 2006, the same day that the intraday trading set a record of $77.95/bbl.
The crude contract continued climbing in early trade Aug. 1, setting an all-time
high of $78.77/bbl on NYMEX. That surpassed the previous high of $78.40/bbl in electronic trading prior to a regular NYMEX session in mid-July of last year. But then the
Energy Information Administration reported Aug. 1 a larger-than-expected draw of
US crude inventories and large builds in gasoline and distillate fuel stocks during the
week ended July 27. That triggered a sell-off that wiped out gains from the July 31
session, with benchmark September crude down to $76.53/bbl by the end of the day.
The contract rebounded to close at $76.86/bbl on Aug. 2 when members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reiterated that they see no need to
produce more oil when US inventories are 12% above the 5-year average and US reﬁning capacity remains constrained. On Aug. 3, the contract had declined to $75.48/
bbl at closing, amid rising fears on Wall Street of a downturn in economic growth.
The front-month crude contract “managed to print a new historical high but it
was followed by a quick reversal that brought West Texas Intermediate down for the
ﬁrst week of the last 8” on the New York market, said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. At the end of the week, the crude contract was down $1.54/bbl, reversing the gains of the previous week, while North Sea
Brent crude was down a second week in a row, losing $1.51/bbl during the week. The
front-month contract for reformulated blend stock for oxygenate blending (RBOB)
was down for the fourth consecutive week, and heating oil posted a loss for the third
week in a row, Jakob reported.

Energy inventories
US gasoline inventories rose by 600,000 bbl to 204.7 million bbl in the week
ended July 27, bigger than Wall Street’s expectation for a 100,000 bbl build. Distillate
inventories rose by 2.8 million bbl to 126.5 million bbl, compared with a consensus
expectation for a 1.3 million bbl build. Crude oil inventories fell by 6.5 million bbl to
344.5 million bbl, well beyond the consensus expectation for a 1.1 million bbl drawdown.
Imports of crude into the US declined by 213,000 b/d to 10.2 million b/d in the
week ended July 27. Gasoline imports dropped to 1.2 million b/d from the prior
week’s record 1.7 million b/d. Distillate fuel imports averaged 339,000 b/d. The input
of crude into US reﬁneries increased by 388,000 b/d to 16.2 million b/d in the week
ended July 27, the largest input since the week ended Aug. 26, 2005, EIA said.
Analysts at Raymond James & Associates Inc. see signs that OPEC ministers may
increase production at their Sept. 11 meeting if crude prices rise too high. If OPEC
maintains its current production quota, however, that could result in a fourth-quarter
decline in supplies, driving prices up. Raymond James said OPEC production actually increased in July by 850,000 b/d, including a 150,000 b/d hike in Nigeria and an
800,000 b/d decrease in Iran.
At the time of EIA’s Aug. 1 report, crude inventories at the key pipeline delivery
center in Cushing, Okla., had fallen for 10 consecutive weeks. Jakob said, “The
weekly statistics were a reminder that, if underlying demand is not strong enough,
a crude oil draw translates into a product build. In July for total products and crude
combined, there was a build of 8 million bbl. Gasoline production reached a new
record high and is 400,000 b/d higher than the same week last year, while middle
distillate production is higher by 490,000 b/d. Reﬁnery runs have [increased] and
at the current levels of runs and of imports would cause further severe crude draw
downs.”
However, he cautioned, “We are starting from US crude stock levels at multiyear
highs, and it remains to be seen how long runs can be maintained at the levels of
last week when margins are at fall levels and product demand remains moribund.”

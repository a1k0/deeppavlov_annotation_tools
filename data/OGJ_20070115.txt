COVER
Oil production began in December 2006 from the Okume complex off Equatorial Guinea, operator Hess Corp. and its partners,
Tullow Oil and GEPetrol, announced. Production will grow during
2007, as infield drilling progresses to peak production of 60,000
b/d during 2008.The Okume complex, 150 miles south of Bioko
Island in the Gulf of Guinea, employs two tension-leg platforms,
three satellite platforms, and a central processing platform. Central
processing facilities are tied back to the Sendje Ceiba floating
production, storage, and offloading vessel. Photo courtesy of Hess.

Interest

Tepco seeking more stable LNG sources
Tokyo Electric Power Co. (Tepco) will not renew long-term
agreements to purchase LNG from projects in Alaska and Indonesia
when they expire in 2009.
Reports said Tepco is seeking to obtain stable long-term supplies while diversifying its geographical risk. In 2005, Tepco purchased 30% of Japan’s imports of LNG, with more than 6% of those
supplies coming from Alaska and Indonesia.
Under existing contracts Tepco receives 920,000 tonnes of Alaska LNG from Phillips Alaska Natural Gas and Marathon Oil, along
with an additional 130,000 tonnes of LNG from the Arun facility
of Indonesia’s state-run PT Pertamina.
Indonesia had trouble meeting its commitments to Japanese
LNG buyers due to demand growth for domestic gas supplies. In
Alaska, moreover, there are questions about long-term LNG prospects, given proposals for gas pipelines to feed growing US needs.
Tepco has had other uncertainties over the security of its supplies. In November 2004 the company signed a contract with
Sakhalin Energy Investment, operator of the Sakhalin-2 project, to
buy 1.5 million tonnes/year of LNG for 22 years from April 2007.
Those supplies are now in question due to the sale of a 50% stake
in the project to Russia’s OAO Gazprom.
In an apparent effort to begin redressing the situation, Tepco
last December concluded a heads of agreement on the purchase of
300,000 tonnes/year of LNG from six sellers of Australia’s North
West Shelf LNG from April 2009 to March 2017.
The contract volume is about one fourth of the 1.18 million
tonnes/year that Tepco buys from NWS LNG based on a 20-year
agreement that will expire at the end of March 2009.

FERC issues ﬁnal EIS for Mississippi LNG project
US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission staff released a final
environmental impact statement favoring Bayou Casotte Energy LLP’s
proposed LNG terminal and pipeline on Bayou Casotte adjacent to
parent Chevron Corp.’s refinery near Pascagoula, Miss.
FERC said commissioners will take the EIS into consideration
when they make a final decision on the project. FERC found the
project environmentally acceptable for several reasons:
• The site adjoining Chevron’s refinery would provide “numerous
synergies and environmental benefits, including use of existing services for security and safety, minimization of landowner impacts, and
use of waste heat from the refinery to accomplish LNG vaporization.”

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

• Only short lengths of pipeline are needed to tie into an existing
natural gas pipeline grid.
• The project would not likely affect threatened or endangered
species.
• No residences are near construction areas.
• Bayou Casotte Energy plans to implement a modified version of
FERC’s plans and procedures to minimize impacts on soils, wetlands,
and bodies of water.
• No noise-sensitive areas are located near the proposed project.
• Before construction could begin, appropriate consultations would
be required with the US Army Corps of Engineers, US Environmental
Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
State Historic Preservation Office, and Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.
• Safety features would be incorporated into the design of the terminal and LNG vessels that use it.
• Local pilots and the US Coast Guard would impose operational
controls to direct the movement of LNG ships, and security provisions
would be put in place to deter possible terrorist attacks.
• The project’s environmental and engineering inspection and mitigation monitoring program would ensure compliance with all mitigation measures, which would be conditions of FERC’s authorization.

McMoRan’s Main Pass Energy Hub project approved
McMoRan Exploration Co. reported it has received approval
from the US Maritime Administration for its Main Pass Energy Hub
project on Main Pass Block 299 in 210 ft of water off Louisiana in
the Gulf of Mexico.
Marad concluded that construction and operation of the MPEH
deepwater port would be consistent with national objectives such
as energy sufficiency and environmental quality. It also said the
project will fill a vital role in meeting national energy requirements
for many years and that the port’s offshore deepwater location will
help reduce congestion and enhance safety in receiving LNG cargoes to the US.
As approved, the MPEH facility will be able to regasify LNG at a
peak rate of 1.6 bcfd, store 28 bcf of gas in salt caverns, and deliver
3.1 bcfd of gas, including gas from storage, to the US.
Unique advantages of the project include use of existing offshore structures, onsite gas cavern storage capabilities, logistical
savings associated with the offshore location, and premium markets available from its eastern gulf location. ✦

at 13,328-13,400 ft was tested through a 3⁄4-in. choke with 2,000
psi of wellhead pressure.
Separately, the Zasr 36 well flowed 2,945 b/d of oil and 2.1
MMcfd of gas. The well was a new Alam El Bueib (AEB) discovery
in the field. Apache drilled the well to 12,424 ft in AEB 3G sands
and targeted AEB 3D and 3E sands. Log analysis showed 58 ft of net
pay in the AEB 3D and 3E sands.
The Hathor Deep 1X well on the Khalda Offset concession tested 12 MMcfd of gas in the AEB 6 formation and 1,237 b/d of oil
from the AEB 3D formation. Apache will proceed with developing
the Hathor Deep 1X having received approval from state-owned
Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. It has installed surface equipment and needs the petroleum minister’s approval before it can
begin production.
The Qasr 40 well logged 60 ft of net oil pay in the AEB 3E sands
and in secondary pay intervals in the AEB 3A and 3C. The new well
is a step-out northwest from the Qasr 31, which currently produces 2,005 b/d.
The Kenz 35 well will be completed in the AEB 3E formation
as a gas and condensate producer. Apache said it was drilled 1 km
northwest of the nearest producing well in the Kenz field on the
Khalda Ridge. Kenz 35 logged 140 ft of AEB net pay as well as 18 ft
of net pay in the Upper Bahariya.

Vermilion to drill wildcat off southwest France
Vermilion REP, a subsidiary of Calgary-based Vermilion Resources Ltd. and Vermilion Exploration SAS, is planning to drill an
exploration well on the Aquitaine maritime permit which covers a
1,211 sq km area in the northern part of offshore Aquitaine basin
in southwest France.
Following 2D and 3D seismic surveys carried out in September and October 2005 at a cost of $6 million, with final processing completed in February 2006, Vermilion is planning an
exploratory well in this year’s third quarter at a cost of $25-30
million.
Six large structural leads have been mapped at the primary
Lower Cretaceous reservoir target. In addition, a large structural
lead has been identified at the Upper Cretaceous-Lower Tertiary level, and a location for the hole is being selected, said Paul
Beique, director of investor relations for parent firm Vermilion
Energy Trust.
“A well depth of 3,000 m would be sufficient to penetrate the
entire Lower Cretaceous sequence,” Beique said, adding that it
would take 30-40 days to drill. “The big question,” he said, “is the
quality of the reservoir, whether the rock is porous and permeable.”
Although it is an extension of the onshore oil-prone Parentis
subbasin, and its distance to shore varies at 20-80 km in 50-200 m
of water, the 22 exploration wells drilled over time by Esso, Shell,
or Elf have never so far yielded commercial results. Esso, which
never found a partner to share the development costs, drilled the
most recent well, Pegasus, in 1998.

Petroceltic makes gas ﬁnd in eastern Algeria
Petroceltic International PLC, Dublin, said two wells have confirmed the potential to commercially exploit shallow, laterally extensive hydrocarbon reservoirs on part of the 10,872 sq km Isarene
permit in the Illizi basin in eastern Algeria.
The company is reviewing options with respect to appraisal and
development.
ISAS-1, the permit’s obligation well, tested 360 Mcfd of wet
gas on a 40⁄64-in. choke at 41 psi stabilized wellhead pressure from
Devonian F2 at 851-856 m and 861-865 m. Formation damage
was indicated. The well also tested 850 Mcfd of wet gas on a 56⁄64-in.
choke with 36 psi stabilized wellhead pressure from Carboniferous
Visean B at 558-564 m.
The well produced small amounts of gas from Ordovician open
hole.
About 40 km west, Hassi Tab Tab-2 flowed 12.56 MMcfd of
wet gas on a 56⁄65-in. choke with 590 psi stabilized wellhead pressure from Devonian F2 at 907-921 m and 939.5-943 m. It flowed
2.44 MMcfd of wet gas on a 44⁄64-in. choke with 231 psi stabilized
wellhead pressure from Carboniferous Tournaisian at 677-681 m.
And it flowed 440 Mcfd of wet gas on a 32⁄64-in. choke with 84 psi
stabilized wellhead pressure from Carboniferous Visean B at 436.5441.5 m.
The Devonian F2 flow rate at HTT-2 is one of the highest for
this horizon in the basin, said Petroceltic, which holds 75% of the
block. Sonatrach holds the other 25%.
Isarene is 120 km south of In Amenas, Algeria’s largest wet gas
project. It is just southwest of another permit on which Rosneft
has drilled two oil discoveries and one gas-condensate discovery in
Ordovician and Devonian F6 reservoirs. And it is less than 15 km
from Repsol YPF-operated Tifernine field, where processing facilities have spare capacity (OGJ, May 17, 1993, p. 26).

Well off Vietnam gauges high oil ﬂow rate
A new appraisal well in Te Giac Trang on Block 16-1 off Vietnam
has flowed oil at high rates on a drillstem test.
The TGT-5X well, drilled to a TD of 3,405 m, gauged 7,000 b/d,
said Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production PLC, which holds
a 28.5% interest in Block 16-1 through subsidiary PTTEP Hoang
Long Co.
PTTEP said a second drillstem test, in progress at the time of the
report, recorded an initial flow rate of 7,300 b/d.
Drillstem test flows of other appraisal wells on the same structure are 600 b/d from TGT-4X, 9,432 b/d from TGT-1X, and 9,908
b/d from TGT-3X (OGJ Online, Apr. 28, 2006).

Trinidad and Tobago round gets one bidder
The latest bid round for the Trinidad Deep Atlantic Area received

Production

BP suspends production at Shah Deniz project
BP PLC has halted gas and condensate production from its first
production well at the Shah Deniz project because of a technical
fault.
The $4.5 billion project, in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian
Sea, has encountered some unexpected problems with gas pressures in the well, the company said. Shah Deniz came on stream
in mid-December and was shut down just before the end of that
month.
“We hope to bring the project back on as soon as possible,” a BP
spokesman said, but declined to give a specific time frame.
Shah Deniz holds 25-35 tcf of gas and in Stage 1 is expected to
produce 8.6 billion cu m/year of gas and 37,000 b/d of condensate, which will be shipped to Ceyhan, Turkey, for processing (OGJ,
Aug. 21, 2000, p. 68).
Gas will be exported to Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey via the
$1.3 billion, 700 MMcfd South Caucasian Pipeline. The line, also
operated by BP, extends 430 miles from Baku to Tbilisi, Georgia,
and Erzurum in eastern Turkey, paralleling the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
oil pipeline.

UK Buzzard oil-gas ﬁeld starts production
Buzzard oil and gas field in the UK Central North Sea has come
on stream and will bring an additional 200,000 b/d of oil to international markets later this year and 60 MMcfd of gas.
Buzzard, which is operated by Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd., has
reserves of more than 500 million boe and the potential to deliver
about 10% of the UK’s annual forecast oil demand at peak rates. It
is the largest North Sea discovery to be developed in more than a
decade.
Buzzard production will be processed through a 12,000-tonne
production deck (OGJ Online, June 29, 2006). So far nine production and five injection wells have been drilled. Buzzard will be
developed with 27 production wells and 11 water injection wells.
Buzzard lies in 317 ft of water about 100 km northeast of Ab-

pipeline on the UK Frigg pipeline to the St. Fergus gas terminal.
Dave Thomas, an oil analyst at Citigroup, told OGJ that the $2.9
billion invested to develop the field was “very competitive” bearing in mind rising industry costs. “However, there is still the question on how BG Group will deal with handling high sulfur levels
in Buzzard oil,” he added. Installing an amine unit offshore to strip
sulfur from the oil could cost an additional estimated $200-300
million.
A BG Group spokesman told OGJ that the sulfur was contained
in some parts of the reservoir and production would go ahead as
planned.

Shell lets contracts for deepwater ESP systems
Units of Royal Dutch Shell PLC have awarded contracts to Centrilift, Claremore, Okla., to provide electrical submersible pumping
(ESP) systems in deepwater seabed production-boosting systems
for projects in the Gulf of Mexico and off Brazil.
It will be gulf’s first ESP system using seabed vertical booster
stations, said Centrilift, a division of Baker Hughes Inc.
Shell Offshore Inc.’s Perdido development will include five enhanced run life ESP vertical booster stations. Centrilift will supply
the ESP equipment, provide engineering design, qualification, and
testing services. Each installation will include a liquid-gas separator
to maximize ESP performance.
The vertical booster stations will handle production from Great
White, Silvertip, and Tobago satellite fields tied back to the Perdido
spar, moored in 8,000 ft of water (OGJ, Nov. 27, 2006, Newsletter).
The booster stations will be under the spar and tied to the
platform via top tensioned risers. First production is expected in
2010. ✦

Chubu-Toho JV to expand LNG terminals
Japan’s Chubu Electric Power Co. and Toho Gas Co. plan to expand their LNG facilities by constructing two natural gas pipelines
and further developing the jointly owned Chita LNG import terminal in Aichi prefecture.
To maintain a steady LNG supply for Japan, especially from
Qatar, Chubu and Toho will build the pipelines to connect Chita
terminal to Chubu’s Kawagoe thermal power plant and to Toho’s
regasification plant. The pipelines are scheduled for completion in
2013.
The Chita terminal, one of the largest in Japan, receives about
6.5 million tonnes/year of LNG in about 110 tankers. By 2009, the
JV plans to refit and expand the terminal to receive tankers that can
carry 200,000 cu m of LNG. Chita currently receives vessels with
capacities of as much as 170,000 cu m of LNG.
Hirotaka Iwase, spokesman for Chubu Electric, said more suppliers are using larger-scaled vessels, and the ability to accept the
new ships will contribute to securing a stable LNG supply.
In addition to the changes at Chita, Chubu Electric has separate
plans to refit by 2010 another LNG terminal near the Kawagoe
thermal power plant to accept tankers that can carry as much as
200,000 cu m of LNG.
LNG supplies could come primarily from Qatar Liquefied Gas
Co. (Qatargas), which has been a main supplier to Chubu since
December 1996 when its first LNG cargo departed Ras Laffan and
was delivered to the Kawagoe terminal.
In June, Qatargas said that by 2010 it would add more than 50
tankers, each capable of carrying more than 200,000 cu m of LNG
to markets in Asia, the US, and Europe.

GDF seeks partners for LNG terminal expansion
To cope with LNG growth in France and Europe, Gaz de France
has issued an invitation to new players to participate in development of new regasification capacity at its Montoir-de-Bretagne ter10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

minal on the Atlantic coast.
Capacity enhancement would occur in two stages:
• An initial addition of 2.5 billion cu m, scheduled for commissioning in 2011, will bring current delivery capacity to 12.5
billion cu m/year.
• In the second stage, construction of a fourth large-capacity
LNG tank and the additional boosting of regasification and emission facilities would add an additional 4 billion cu m/year, increasing capacity to 16.5 billion cu m/year from 2014 onwards.
The extension will be built on the basis of long-term ship-orpay contracts.
On stream since 1980, the Montoir-de-Bretagne terminal can
handle LNG carriers with a capacity of up to 200,000 cu m. It
currently receives LNG from Algeria, Nigeria, and Egypt and has a
storage capacity of 360,000 cu m.
GDF sees the development of LNG imports worldwide reaching
300 billion cu m of gas (in gaseous state) by 2010, up from 176
billion cu m in 2005. ✦

US terminal sees two LNG tankers at once
In mid-December 2006 two LNG tankers were at Southern LNG’s Elba
Island regasiﬁcation terminal near Savannah, Ga. This is the ﬁrst time a US
LNG import terminal has had two LNG tankers simultaneously. Docked at
the Elba Island terminal North Dock was the 138,000 cu m British Trader
while the 127,500 cu m Edouard LD was moored at the facility’s South
Dock. Photo from El Paso Corp.

Stocks represent immediately accessible supply and serve important operational functions. A refinery that receives
intermittent deliveries of crude by
tanker, for example, must use storage to
stabilize flows into distillation columns.
But stocks also provide buffers
against supply disruptions—for individual refiners, for other positions
along the distribution chain such as
pipelines and terminals, and for the
whole market. It’s in US oil markets that
the new EIA data on days of supply will
be valuable.
A stock level of x might represent
an adequate—or at least historically
normal—cushion at consumption level

perilously so. It covers proportionally
more days of consumption at level y
than at 1.5y.
So an observer might see inventory
levels of crude oil holding steady over
several years and think conditions are
normal. But if demand, measured as input to refineries, rises steadily over the
same period, the actual supply buffer
actually is shrinking. The effect, not evident in stock volumes, would show up
as a shrinking days-of-supply number.
Those are simple illustrations of the
much more-sophisticated analyses that
are possible with the new data series,
which will appear weekly. ✦

Democrats in control
Misunderstanding typical of past energy mistakes is pushing triumphant congressional Democrats to the brink of new error. Americans do not
need to worry about this unless they use modern
forms of energy or pay taxes.
Giddy as they are with their recovery of power,
Democrats can be forgiven a few days of rhetorical
excess. But they really should try to be correct.
“For too long, our country’s energy policy
has had only one concern: oil company profits,”
declared new Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
of Nevada (OGJ Online, Jan. 8, 2006). This is quite
a condemnation of energy policy. Until extraordinary events—strikes in major producing countries,
wars, hurricanes—combined with relentlessly
rising demand to push up prices for crude oil and
natural gas in the past 4 years, oil industry profitability languished well below levels of most other
industries for at least a decade and a half. If energy
policy really were as concerned about oil company
profits as Reid alleged, it failed spectacularly.

2. Diversify and expand the use of “secure,
efficient, and environmentally friendly”—which
means congressionally specified—energy forms.
3. Reduce the burdens of rising energy costs
on consumers.
4. Eliminate “tax give-aways” to large energy
companies.
5. Prevent energy “price-gouging, profiteering,
and market manipulation.”
This list contains striking contradictions. While
addressing the build-up of greenhouse gases is a
righteous aim, requiring emissions reductions as
called for in item 1 would raise energy costs in
conflict with item 3. Whatever hope item 1 leaves
for the achievement of item 3 will be dashed by
item 2. To win market acceptance of its favorite
energy types, the government must resort to subsidies and mandates, which are very expensive. An
example is EPACT’s fuel ethanol program, a breathtaking tax give-away unlikely to receive much
attention in item 4. And item 5 just shows how

US energy demand will increase
this year as the economy grows at a
tempered pace. Winter weather will
be milder than normal, requiring less
heating, but temperatures in the summer are also expected to be higher than
usual, requiring more cooling.

needed in the US in 2007. OGJ forecasts

sate will move up nearly 2% this year
after declining in 2006. Oil production
will increase worldwide.
US natural gas supply will be up just
1% from 2006. Gas demand will be
up by less than that, though, despite
the need for more electricity generated
from gas. Inventories will decline a bit
on stronger demand in the summer.

Economy, energy
OGJ forecasts that the US economy
will grow in 2007 but that the pace will
be down from last year.
Many factors are weighing on the
economy, including the cooled housing
market. But energy prices will be lower
this year. Additionally, personal income
has been rising steadily for the past few
years, according to the US Bureau of
Economic Analysis.

US energy demand this year will
grow 1.1%. Consumption of all forms
of energy, including oil, gas, coal,
nuclear, and renewable energy, will total
101.95 quadrillion btu (quads).
Energy efficiency will barely improve
this year. Energy use will decline to
8,750 btu/$ of GDP from 8,840 btu/$
a year ago.
In 2006, total US energy demand
increased an estimated 0.4%. Consumption of oil and gas declined a bit, while
coal demand was unchanged, and
consumption of nuclear and renewable
energy grew.

Energy sources
While this year’s growth rates for
all types of energy will be modest, the
largest percentage of growth will be
for renewable energies. Included in this
group are wind and solar energy and
hydroelectric power generation.
OGJ expects energy from renewable sources to climb 5% this year.
This group will still account for the
smallest share of total US energy used:
6.7%.
Total US energy consumption for renewable energy will be 6.85 quads this
year. In 2006, demand for renewable
energy sources increased 8%, mostly as
a result of an increase in hydroelectric
power generation. Hydro is the largest
component of the group of renewable
energy sources.
But oil will remain the largest of all
energy sources in the US this year. Representing 40.2% of US energy demand,
oil consumption in 2007 will total 41
quads. This is up 1.1% from last year,
when oil demand contracted 0.3% on
strong crude and product prices.
Natural gas consumption will be
22.67 quads, inching up from last year.
In 2006, demand for gas in the US
recorded a negligible decline.
Total US coal demand will be 23.1
quads this year, up 1.4%. Coal demand was stagnant last year, as total
electric power plant demand for all
forms of energy was little changed
from 2005.

Inventories
Volumes of crude and oil products
in storage will finish 2007 lower than a
year earlier. OGJ forecasts that at yearend the amount of crude in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve also will climb,
reaching 700 million bbl.
Total industry stocks of crude and
products will decline almost 3% this
year. Crude in industry stocks will be
320 million bbl, and products will total
676 million bbl.
Inventories of crude and products
ended 2006 near their end-2005 levels,
with total stocks staying above normal
throughout the year. Crude stocks increased to 330 million bbl last year from
324 million bbl, and product stocks
were up about 1% to 695 million bbl.

Reﬁning
Processing at refineries will remain
strong in 2007, with throughputs, operable capacity, and utilization up a bit
from last year.

Preliminary. Includes Missouri, South Dakota, and Tennessee.

OGJ expects US refining capacity to
increase marginally to 17.5 million b/d
this year. Total inputs will average 15.7
million b/d, resulting in 89.7% utilization.
For 2006, the utilization rate declined to 89.5% from 90.6% a year
earlier. That drop was caused by refinery
and pipeline outages in the first half of
2006 following Hurricanes Katrina and
Rita in 2005.
Average refining margins generally
were strong last year compared with
2005, although the average East Coast
margin declined 11% from year to year,
according to Muse, Stancil & Co. The
West Coast refining margin remained
the strongest, averaging $24.57/bbl and
gaining 17% for the year.

*Preliminary.

delivery price for oil on the New York
Mercantile Exchange plunged more
than $5/bbl.
In 2006, average oil prices were
strong on the expectation of continued
worldwide demand growth and limited
spare production capacity. The average
US landed cost of imported crude was
an estimated $59/bbl last year, an annual increase of 20%.
In the US this year, demand for oil
products will increase 1.1%, with consumption of each product type growing
or being unchanged from 2006.
Total US demand for oil products
will average 20.96 million b/d this

year. US exports of products and crude
oil will decline 5% to 1.25 million b/d,
bringing total demand for oil in the US
to 22.21 million b/d.
Last year demand for motor gasoline, distillate, liquefied petroleum gas,
and ethane increased, but demand for
jet fuel, residual fuel oil, and other
products declined, resulting in a small
overall decline for oil product demand.
Consumption of these products
depends on economic growth, travel,
weather, fuel-switching capabilities, petrochemical production, and transport. A
factor gaining importance is the growth
of ethanol in the US energy mix.

Distillate
Demand for distillate will increase
1% this year. With heating-oil demand
unchanged from last year due to mild
weather, all distillate demand growth
will be the result of increased demand
for diesel fuel.
This growth in diesel demand is
spurred by the need to transport more
ethanol to US gasoline outlets. The ethanol, used as an oxygenate and volume
extender in gasoline, needs to move
to markets from many plants, mostly
located in the Midwest.
Because ethanol is not transportable with gasoline via pipeline,

ultralow-sulfur diesel.
For the first 9 months of 2006, the
average wholesale price for diesel was
26

$2.058/gal. Diesel prices have climbed
every year since 2002, when the No.

Motor gasoline demand will grow
1% this year, too, the same pace at
which it grew in 2006, as pump prices

summer 2006 highs.
OGJ estimates that the pump price
for regular unleaded gasoline in the US
averaged $2.58/gal last year. The average monthly price peaked at $2.999/gal
for July, according to EIA. For November the average price had dipped to
$2.241/gal.
Preliminary EIA data for 2005 indicate an improvement in passenger-car
fuel-consumption mileage to 22.9 mpg.
The rate for vans, pickup trucks, and
sport utility vehicles remained at 16.2
28

mpg, its level of the prior 2 years, which
was down from 17.5 mpg in 2002.

Jet fuel
OGJ forecasts that US demand for jet
fuel in 2007 will average 1.64 million
b/d, up from 1.63 million b/d last year.
The small change is due to consolidation in the airline industry and greater
efficiencies in passenger travel, as well as
moderate economic growth. In 2005, jet
fuel demand averaged 1.68 million b/d.
US airlines carried 561.9 million

scheduled domestic and international
passengers on their systems during the
first 9 months of 2006, up just 0.3%
from the same period in 2005, the US
Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)
reported.
BTS said US airlines carried 0.4%
fewer domestic passengers and 5.6%
more international passengers during
the first 9 months of 2006 than during
the same 2005 period.
US carriers operated 4.2% fewer doOil & Gas Journal / Jan. 15, 2007

LNG imports plunged 10% in 2006.
US gas exports this year will increase

680 bcf from 729 bcf in 2005.
OGJ forecasts that US consumption
of gas this year will total 22.288 tcf, up
0.3% from last year.
While the amount of gas consumed
in the US over the past few years has
been fairly steady, there has been a shift
in demand by type of consumer. Since
2003, the volume of gas consumed by
electric power plants has increased. At
the same time, gas demand by residential, commercial, and industrial consumers has declined. ✦

Growth expected for global oil demand, production
Marilyn Radler
Senior Editor-Economics
Worldwide demand for oil will
climb 1.4 million b/d in 2007, following growth of just 900,000 b/d
last year.
Production will grow enough
this year in countries outside the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to enable OPEC producers to
hold exports near 2006 levels.
At its Dec. 14, 2006, meeting in
Abuja, Nigeria, OPEC admitted Angola
as the 12th member of the organization,
effective Jan. 1, 2007. For figures in this
article, Angola is considered non-OPEC.

Global oil demand
Demand by member countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will post a small
increase this year.
OECD demand will average 49.6
million b/d vs. 49.4 million b/d last
year, according to the latest figures from
the International Energy Agency. All of
this growth will be in North America.
Demand will contract slightly in the European and Asian countries of the OECD.
Non-OECD countries will account for
most of the world’s oil demand growth
in 2007, according to IEA. The Parisbased agency forecasts that non-OECD
demand will average 36.3 million b/d,
up from 35.1 million b/d last year.
Among these countries China will
lead demand growth. Oil demand in
China this year will be 7.4 million b/d,
according to IEA.
Last year China’s oil demand averaged
7 million b/d, compared to 6.6 million
b/d a year earlier. In 2004, Chinese demand jumped to 6.4 million b/d from
5.5 million b/d the prior year.
Demand this year in other Asian
countries will climb to average 9.1
million b/d from the 2006 average of
8.9 million b/d. And IEA expects oil
demand in the Middle East to average

12.5 million b/d, up from 12.1 million b/d last year. IEA warns, though,
that the Russian government’s attempts
to reinstate control and influence over
regional energy assets and infrastructure
may impede supply growth.
“Future access to Russian reserves and
the legal operating framework remain
uncertain. Geopolitical and infrastructure issues, not below-ground risks, may
limit the FSU contribution to mediumterm non-OPEC growth,” IEA said.
Among the remaining non-OPEC,
non-OECD regions, the only supply
growth areas are Latin America and
Africa. Brazil will drive the increase in
Latin America, with nearly 200,000
b/d of incremental crude and ethanol
supply this year. The expected average
supply boost to 4.5 million b/d from 4
million b/d last year in Africa includes

of 29.7 million b/d last year, plus NGL
supply of 4.7 million b/d. OPEC will
supply the market with an average of
4.9 million b/d of NGL this year, according to IEA.

rigs/week this year, up from 1,649 in
2006 and 1,383 in 2005.
• Operators will drill 22,150 wells
in western Canada, down from an estimated 24,105 wells in 2006.

State estimates
OGJ forecasts a 5% increase in Texas
drilling in 2007 to 14,160 wells.
Wyoming, the next largest state in
terms of numbers of wells, should see
4,425 wells drilled, including about
3,000 in the Powder River basin coalbeds alone.
The outlook is for 3,590 wells to be

Democrats put global warming at center of energy plans
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
In their first day back in charge,
US Senate Democrats said they intend
to aggressively address global climate

change by developing energy alternatives to oil, gas, and coal; by improving energy efficiency; and by shifting
tax incentives from traditional energy
sources to emerging technologies.
“For too long, our country’s energy

policy has had only one concern: oil
company profits,” Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) said on Jan.
4 as he described S. 6, one of 10 bills
Democrats introduced on a range of
issues.

Officially designated the National
Energy and Environmental Security
Act of 2007, S. 6 calls for reducing
US dependence on foreign oil and the
risks of global warming by “requiring
reductions in emissions of greenhouse
gases; diversifying and expanding the
use of secure, efficient, and environmentally friendly energy supplies and
technologies; reducing the burdens
on consumers of rising energy prices;
eliminating tax giveaways to large energy companies; and preventing energy
price-gouging, profiteering, and market
manipulation.”
Reid noted that the bill aims to
promote US energy independence
and enhance domestic security so the
country “can begin to deal with the
threat—the threat—of global warming.”
He said he and five other senators were
reminded of this during recent visits to
several South American countries when
they were told that Ecuador’s glaciers
are melting.
“So in an effort to begin to solve
this energy crisis, our sixth bill takes
an aggressive approach to reducing
America’s dependence on oil, especially foreign oil, and putting more
advanced technologies in the hands
of consumers,” he said. “It will boost
production of electricity from solar,
geothermal, and other renewable
resources that are abundant in states
such as Nevada, and it will grow our
nation’s renewable energy jobs and
manufacturing base.”

house gas emissions will be addressed
by Senate committees other than his.
But he added that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee expects to play
a major part because “over 95% of the
US carbon dioxide emissions and nearly
85% of all US greenhouse gas emissions
come from energy production, distribution, and use.”
The legislation also will include
measures to encourage the use of energy-efficient light bulbs and to assure
full funding of energy-relief programs
for low-income families.
On oil and gas taxation, Bingaman
asserted that the US offers one of the
world’s most favorable fiscal regime
for oil and gas production and pointed
to “big problems” in federal royalty
management. He was referring to offshore leases issued in 1998-99 without
price thresholds, which cap deepwater
royalty relief in leases issued in other
years.
“We will be examining how to
rebalance the system, both from the
perspective of having fair and effective royalty and tax policies for oil and
gas and from the perspective of having effective tax and other incentives
to promote other forms of energy,
such as production of electricity from
wind solar, geothermal, and renewable
sources,” Bingaman said.
He said energy and environmental
issues probably will be addressed in
multiple bills.

problems such as health care.
“The only thing lacking, really,
has been the will of the leadership of
America to move forward to get us to
that energy independence,” he said.
“We ought not to be in a position
where the national sovereignty and
security of this nation is held hostage
to the whims of the Middle East and
those who happen to have oil wealth
under their sands,” Salazar declared.
On another topic he said, “We will find
economic opportunity, including economic opportunity for rural America,
to help us grow our way to energy
independence.”

House approach
In the House, Democrats also signaled some of their energy and environmental approaches for the months
ahead.
Jay Inslee (Wash.) said Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), in earlier remarks,
“made a commitment to the country
that our nation would start a titanic
and historic shift from old technologies associated with fossil fuels that are
now putting massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and
towards the use of new technologies
that can produce our mode of power
for our cars and our planes and our
buses and our homes and our computers and even our hair dryers in a
way that does not contribute to global
warming.”
Achieving these results, he said,
will require repealing “some of the
less prudent activities of the former Congress that gave $7 billion of
taxpayer money to the oil and gas
industry, a very imprudent move, an
industry that is in tip-top form financially.”
Inslee said incentives that the industry received could be moved to “a pool
of funds that will be used to develop
new high-tech, clean energy sources
that we can go forward to build energy
independence and reduce our contributions of carbon dioxide and other gases
that are contributing to global warming.” ✦

Bush lifts leasing bans
on two OCS areas
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
US President George W. Bush has
opened two Outer Continental Shelf
areas for new oil and gas leasing after
removing tracts in Alaska’s North Aleutian basin (more commonly known
as Bristol Bay) and the Central Gulf of
Mexico from the presidential withdrawal list.
Bush announced the action in a
memorandum to Department of the
Interior Sec. Dirk A. Kempthorne, who
immediately said the areas would receive thorough environmental reviews.
“There will be significant opportunities for study and public comment before
any oil and gas development could take
place in these areas,” Kempthorne said.
Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Ak.) said Bush’s
action was welcome news to people
who live and work in the Bristol Bay
region. He said he originally requested
a moratorium on leasing there during
fiscal 1990 after the tanker Exxon Valdez
ran aground in 1989 in Prince William
Sound farther south. President George
H.W. Bush subsequently issued an
executive order prohibiting leasing in
Bristol Bay, which President Bill Clinton
extended through 2012, Stevens said.
Congress also continued to impose
moratoria on oil and gas activities in
Bristol Bay from fiscal 1990 through
1993 before discontinuing them in fiscal 1994 at Stevens’ request, he said. But
the moratorium’s removal did not clear
the way for leasing, Stevens noted. That
required a presidential order, which
George W. Bush issued on Jan. 9.
Stevens said imported farmed salmon, high energy costs, and the area’s
remoteness have limited economic
growth and contributed to poverty in
the Bristol Bay region.

EIA hikes oil
ﬂow outlook

T

he US Energy Information
Administration won’t present
its 2007 Annual Energy Outlook
(AEO) for a few more weeks. But
the reference case that it released in
early December provided at least one
intriguing preview.
We’ll use EIA’s own words to explain: “The projections for US crude
oil production in the AEO 2007 reference case are significantly different
from those in the AEO 2006 reference case.” Different, as in higher.
In the 2007 reference case, EIA
projected a US crude production
increase from 5.2 million b/d in
2005 to 5.9 million b/d in 2017 as
a result of more offshore production,
primarily from the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico, followed by a decline to 5.4
million b/d in 2030.
A year earlier, its reference case predicted “a much steeper decline in production from 2017 to 2030” (from
5.8 million to 4.6 million b/d).
The reasons for the 800,000
b/d difference? Primarily, says EIA, a
slower decline for Lower 48 onshore
production in the 2007 reference
case, “mostly as a result of increased
production from enhanced oil recovery technology and, to a lesser extent,
significantly higher resource assumptions for the Bakken shale formation
in the Williston basin.”

primarily from higher oil prices. “We
also looked more closely at our past
assumptions. Given what we found in
recent studies, we decided to increase
our projections,” he said.
EIA raised its resource assumption for the Bakken formation on the
basis of a study by Advance Resources
International, McAllister said.
While the estimated future offshore volumes may have changed
somewhat from 2006 to 2007, the
trend essentially is the same in both
years’ reference cases, according to
Dana Van Wagner, another EIA analyst
who handled that modeling. “Higher
prices are contributing to more drilling offshore and in deeper waters.
More cash flow is available,” she said.

Price sensitivity

Large discoveries expected to
come on line in the next 2 years
depend less on high world oil prices
than those where development economics have not been determined,
Van Wagner explained.
“Some fields have been delayed
due to technical issues. A couple
were supposed to start producing at
the end of 2006 or the beginning
of 2007. But they’re still expected to
come on line. That’s why both years’
projections show a bump upward,
followed by a flattening out,” she
said.

safeguards, using the most advanced
technology available to help ensure our
fisheries are protected,” he said.
“This is not the end of the public process, but rather the start of a
dialogue that could lead to important
energy development in our state. It is
vital for Alaskans to express their views
on the upcoming Environmental Impact
Statement regarding the 5-year schedule, as well as take advantage of future
public comment periods,” added US
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Ak.).
She said she had spoken with Kempthorne about Bristol Bay’s environmental
sensitivities and its world-leading sockeye salmon runs. “During those conversations, I received an assurance from
the secretary that if leasing is ultimately
proposed for the waters, that it will only
be conducted with stringent environmental safeguards to protect not just
salmon, but also any crab, cod, Pollock
and whales, marine mammals, and birdlife that live and pass through the Bristol
Bay region waters,” Murkowski said.
Last year then-Alaska Gov. Frank H.
Murkowski and other local government and Alaska Native leaders said they
would support modifying the presidential withdrawal, according to DOI.
Consequently, the 2007-12 OCS oil
and gas leasing program, which the US
Minerals Management Service is preparing, contains options for one or two
lease sales in about 5.6 million acres of

It said MMS previously offered leases
in that part of Bristol Bay in OCS Lease

no oil and gas leases there.

MMS is expected to release the final
OCS program and environmental impact statement this spring, DOI said.
Kempthorne also announced on Jan.
9 that he has increased the royalty rate
for most new offshore deepwater federal oil and gas leases to 16.7% (1⁄6 from
the present 1⁄8). The new rate, which
excludes Alaska, will take effect with
the first 2007 Gulf of Mexico lease sale

scheduled for late August.
Most federal oil and gas is leased at
a 12.5% royalty rate both onshore and
offshore, according to DOI. The Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act grants the
secretary discretion to establish a higher
royalty rate, it said.
It said MMS estimates the increased
royalty rate for new deepwater offshore
leases in the gulf will increase revenue

from royalty payments by $4.5 billion
over 20 years. MMS estimates that, by
2017, this increased revenue would
offset any decline in bonus and rental
revenues and any revenue losses from a
decline in production.
MMS estimates a decline of bonus
and rental revenues at $820 million
over 20 years and decline in production at 5%, or 110 million boe, over 20
years, according to DOI. ✦

and the so-called Rossport Five, who
are again in the limelight (OGJ, July

This time, the Five are out of jail
and promoting their new book, Our
Story, telling of their time in prison
for protesting against the gas project
undertaken by Royal Dutch Shell
PLC.
The five men were advised by
prison wardens not to mix with

O’Seighin said otherwise: “One of

That point was echoed by Corduff, who said the 208-page book
would give people an insight into the
dispute.
“We want to tell what we were
going through and our suffering—
for no gains,” said Corduff. “But if
we hadn’t done it, we’d probably
be a lot worse off like in Nigeria,
where 300 people were killed on

Contradictory signals
Leverett said some NOCs have
begun to act independently of their
governments, which US policymakers
should encourage. Noting the response
by some US politicians to Chinese National Offshore Oil Corp.’s interest in
buying Unocal Corp. a few years ago,
he noted, “We encourage the Chinese

hand and discourage their initiative on
the other.”
Many witnesses and committee
members agreed that US development

vital. “I believe in the free market. But if
it becomes a national security issue, I’m
prepared to consider spending money
to develop alternatives which would
reduce our dependence on oil from
countries whose interests are different from ours,” said Sen. Jeff Sessions
(R-Ala.).
Hormats said incentives to develop
alternatives need to last long enough
to complete projects, particularly the
tax credit for investing in renewable
resources. “Certain kinds of institutional
and other investors can’t put money
into the business because the time
spans aren’t long enough. We have the
technological ability on the supply side,
with this country’s entrepreneurial traditions and vitality, to use new sources
as well as conventional sources,” he
said.
Witnesses generally agreed that every
option should be pursued. “None of
these things are silver bullets. We have
to do all of them. But if we were to do
everything that was mentioned today
before this panel, it would still take us
10-15 years during which we would
still be vulnerable,” said Wald. ✦

IEA: EU copes with Russian oil export delays
The International Energy Agency Jan.
9 said European oil markets would cope
with the halt of Russian oil exports via the
Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline across Belarus, but it nonetheless called for a quick

and clear resolution to the problem (OGJ
Online, Jan. 8, 2007).
“There is apparently no immediate impact to any of the refineries in the
countries involved, as they all have working

stocks of several days. So there is no threat
that product supplies to the end users will
be disrupted,” IEA said.
It said if the disruption should prove
more prolonged, the refineries could
source crude from alternative routes. Some
already are organizing alternative supplies
through Baltic Sea ports or through other
pipelines.
The affected countries on the Northern branch of the Druzhba pipeline are
Poland and Germany. Ukraine, the Slovak
Republic, Hungary, and the Czech Republic
are affected on the southern part of the
pipeline.
In an effort to end the problem, a
delegation led by Belarusan Vice-Premier
Andrei Kobyakov flew to Moscow Jan. 9,
but there was no immediate indication
that supplies would resume, as Russian
President Vladimir Putin ordered his
Cabinet to consider a possible reduction
in oil output.
Putin ordered ministers to discuss with
Russian companies the possibility of reducing oil output in connection to problems
linked to oil transit through Belarus. Analysts said Russia has a limited capacity for
refining oil and would have to cut crude
output if its exports suddenly decreased.
Concerned about the implications of
the disruption on energy security, EU
Commission Pres. Jose Manuel Barroso
and German Chancellor Angela Merkel
criticized Russia and Belarus, saying it is
unacceptable for energy transit or supplier countries to halt deliveries without
consultation.
“That always destroys trust, and no
trusting, undisturbed cooperation can be
built on that,” Merkel said after talks with
Barroso in Berlin.
Merkel said consultations are the minimum when there are such problems, and
[consultations] must become normal.
As the EU called for a rapid resumption
of oil deliveries, EU Energy Chief Andris
Piebalgs said he may convene a meeting
of the bloc’s Oil Supply Group to evaluate
the situation. ✦

This is the second of two parts on
the exploration and production outlook for the West African countries that
border the Gulf of Guinea and Congo
Delta.
In the period 2001-05, West Africa’s
oil production (excluding Nigeria) increased 130,000 b/d/year, while total
non-OPEC oil supply increased 800,000
b/d/year. The rate of growth in nonOPEC production is the strongest in the
last 20 years and is underpinned by the
expansion of E&P activity worldwide
due to two key reasons.
First, rising oil prices have resulted
in a twofold increase in global E&P
investments since 2000.
Second, the benefits of political
stability and reforms in the Former
Soviet Union, the start of large and
challenging projects in deep water,
unconventional oil projects, and the
exploitation of marginal opportunities
made a significant contribution to nonOPEC supply. The West African region
has been a key beneficiary of rising E&P
activity, and not surprisingly it was the
second most important contributor to
non-OPEC after the FSU (Fig. 4).
The main source of growth has been
deepwater fields. In 2005, all of the

risen more if not for the destruction of
some oil facilities in parts of the Niger
Delta in 2003. During this time two
deepwater fields made small contributions—Abo, which started in 2003, and
Bonga, which started in 2005.
At the end of 2005 these two fields
had combined capacity of 130,000 b/d;
however, in late 2005 Bonga was ramping up to its design capacity of 200,000
b/d. The rest of the increase came from
offshore fields in shallow water.

countries (excluding Nigeria), most of
which are in deep water.
The cumulative capital investment is
$39 billion, which is 50% higher than
the cumulative E&P investment in oil
and gas in 2001-05. In Nigeria are over
15 large developing oil projects with
an estimated combined capital investment of $35 billion, the majority of
which are also deepwater projects. The
cumulative investment of these projects
is also 60% higher than the cumulative
E&P investment seen in the 2001-05
period.
Roughly 15 billion bbl of total oil
reserves are under development. Based
on the estimated capex for projects
and comparing it with those in other
regions on a dollars per barrel of oil
equivalent of reserves basis, it is clear
that the future projects in West Africa
are capital intensive. This is because
many of the projects require the drilling
of expensive wells and installation of
complex infrastructure.
We estimate that future development
costs for new projects average $5.70/
boe in Congo (Brazzaville), $5.20/boe
in Angola, $4.80/boe in Nigeria, and
$3.80/boe in Equatorial Guinea (Fig.
6).
In terms of timing, most of the projects that have a start year before 2009
appear to be broadly on track. However,
beyond 2010 the start year of most
projects is less certain, and there is no
method to predict potential delays, but
they will come on stream. In fact, over
95% of the projects with a start year
before 2008 are under construction,
but this falls to around 30% and less for
the following years.
In the current environment this appears to be normal given that services
are limited, and the industry generally
starts actual construction of projects 4
years ahead of the expected production
start year. Having said that, some operators have signed contracts for deepwater
drilling units to 2015 and even to build
new rigs, which shows the industry’s
long-term commitment to bringing
West Africa’s field’s on stream.

In Cameroon, renewed offshore activity and tiebacks will slow the decline
trend of the last few years. E&P activity is taking place in deep water, and a
recent discovery might be commercial.
In Mauritania, oil discoveries have
been made in deep water, and one field
(Chinguetti) began producing in the
second quarter of 2006. However, the
performance of the reservoir has been
poor, and this has resulted in lower
production than expected from the
field; we understand that until more
studies are completed and wells drilled,
the field’s production will remain below
capacity.
A second deepwater field (Tiof,
50,000 b/d) is expected to come on
stream in 2009 using an early production scheme or as a tieback to Chinguetti. Beyond Tiof, no more potential

Removing nitrogen
from natural gas increases production potential
and may spur drilling
in the Yates formation,
Permian basin.
Production
Midland’s BCCK Engineering Inc. is building
new nitrogen removal units in Texas and
Oklahoma that will help capture the
value of nitrogen-rich natural gas.
The company initially developed a
low-volume nitrogen-removal process
that was installed at the Mist gas field,
northwestern Oregon in 1994 (OGJ,
Mar. 13, 1995, p. 92).
BCCK’s Nitech process cryogenically
separates nitrogen from methane in a
single column, but does not employ
a cryogenic pump or any rotating
cryogenic equipment. The basic Nitech
equipment includes a molecular-sieve
gas dehydrator, regeneration gas heater,
aluminum plate-fin heat exchanger, and
a single distillation column with integral patented reflux condenser.
The company installed a Nitech system in Gaines County, Tex., in 2004. In
April 2005, BCCK Engineering received
the Hearst Energy Award for Technology in Midland for its improved Nitech
process.

Beginnings
The introduction of the 10 MMcfd
capacity nitrogen rejection unit (NRU)
at the Mist gas field created salable gas
from low btu natural gas containing
30-50% nitrogen. The Mist NRU was
moved to Denver City, Tex., in 1996
and adapted to handle a different inlet
stream, traditional gas containing 1040% nitrogen.
In 2002, BCCK built a 24 MMcfd
NRU in Grand Junction, Colo., to
handle produced gas containing 1550% nitrogen.
To date, NRUs have been installed at
production facilities in nine states: Oregon, Texas, Colorado, Alabama, Kansas,
Wyoming, California, North Dakota,
and Oklahoma. BCCK’s original Nitech
nitrogen removal process handles flow
rates as low as 1 MMcfd and has been

O D U C T I O N

suitable for small fields.
The Nitech process is also used to
remove natural gas liquids and helium,
both of which can generate separate
revenue streams. It’s suitable for capturing coal mine methane (CMM) and
BCCK has installed CMM units in Pennsylvania, Alabama, and Illinois.
More recently, BCCK has implemented a new technology that enables the
process
to handle
flow of
250 Mcfd
or higher.
The company
recently
modified the reflux (knock-back)
condenser so that it would be more
efficient at higher inlet gas flow rates.
The older design could recover 9899% of the hydrocarbons; the new
design recovers up to 99.9%, nearly 2%
improvement. The new condensor was
implemented in five NRU facilities in
2006.
The enhanced Nitech units are now
being implemented in West Texas, enabling operators to produce natural gas
from the shallow Yates reservoir, long
ignored because its high nitrogen content prevented it from being accepted in
regional pipelines.

Nina M. Rach
Drilling Editor

West Texas
The Permian basin has historically
been an oil province but strong prices
for natural gas have inspired gas-focused drilling. The Yates formation is a
natural gas reservoir with some condensate, found in northern Ector and
Midland counties and running north
through Gaines and Yoakum counties,
Tex. The natural gas found in the Yates
is often low-pressure, containing 1520% nitrogen, causing it to be sold at a
discount.1
Yates sediments are the product of
cyclic marine flooding—dolomites, anhydrites, and halites—with a “regional
trend of increasingly more open marine
facies...to the south and west in the
Permian basin.”1

generally have higher production rates
and greater recoveries. Lower unit development and operating costs also are
key drivers for installing this technology.
Solid expandable tubulars combined
with intelligent-well technology allows
for reentry into laterals for remedial
work and to obtain real-time pressures, temperatures, and flows without
the need for well intervention. Intelligent-well components allow for quick
identification of water-producing zones
and provide a means for shutting off
water production without the need for
well intervention.

Integrating technology
Completion reliability and the potential for higher sustainable production
rates are two major drivers that have
led to the acceptance of intelligent-well
technology. Combined with solid expandable tubulars, operators can install
the technology during workovers in
wells previously unable to benefit from
intelligent completions.

the wellbore is another positive factor
in helping ensure that the expandable
liner reaches the planned depth.

Field development
Installation of the solid expandable
tubulars combined with intelligent-well
technology occurred in a field located
in a desert terrain consisting of salt flat
areas and mountainous sand dunes up
to 600 ft high. Because of rugged terrain, initial field development was from
a limited number of flat areas so that
the wells required highly accurate directional drilling to reach their targets.
The field, developed in the mid1990s, produces 42° gravity oil and
includes 1-km long, single-lateral
horizontal wellbores. The field went on
production in 1998.

Drilling the second lateral involved
running a retrievable plug and setting it

the plug had a 55° right orientation.
A 51⁄2-in. assembly also drilled the
second lateral. This lateral achieved a

The final step in the workover operation involved installing the intelligent

• Three control valves (Fig. 5).
• Required encapsulated hydraulic

A detailed analysis of
the US gasoline market
shows that a market rebalancing will be under
way by 2010, when additional refining capacity
Refining
will reduce the imbalance between demand
and supply. The US need for gasoline
imports, one of the key market factors
that has supported the refining
boom, will have less of an influence by then.
Internationally, this outlook
suggests that while Europe and
Latin America will continue
to have an outlet for surplus
gasoline production into the
next decade, market volatility seen since
2004 is likely to decline and margin
peaks will also fall.
The window of opportunity for
export refiners (e.g., in Latin America
and the Middle East or Asia) building capacity to target the US gasoline
market could also diminish by 2010.

As more projects come on stream, there
will be increasing competition between
these refiners to export gasoline to the
US market.
The early investors will see the best
returns. Some projects being planned
today may not find a market and it will
become increasingly diffcult for developers beyond 2010.
In the longer term, the successful
importers will be those investors with
the best partners, economic crude supplies, optimal configuration in the right
location, and those that can exploit
multiple opportunities in the global
marketplace.
Other market forces must emerge
to ensure that the balance does not
tip completely and the refining boom
lasts into the next decade. Although we
have restricted our analysis to the US
gasoline market, it only accounts for
42% of total oil product consumption
in the US.
Supply-demand dynamics for other
products such as LPG, naphtha, jetkerosine, diesel, gas oil, low-sulfur fuel
oil, and high-sulfur fuel oil combined
will have an effect on future industry
prospects and the longevity of the refining boom.
It is likely that the middle of the barrel will become increasingly important
for refinery profitability into the next
decade.
Moreover, supply-demand dynamics in other regions will also have a
crucial influence on the US. It is possible, for example, that demand growth
in Asia-Pacific could exceed increases
in regional product supply. If so, Asia
could pick up a large proportion of any
future slack in the global market, and it
could be the key region that prolongs
the boom. Indeed, Asia could supplant
the US as the key region for the global
refining market.
An alternative scenario would be
a global gasoline surplus due to new
build capacity in Asia; this is a particularly gloomy long-term prospect for
the industry. Although gasoline in the
US remains the most influential single
refined-product market and can provide

Growth, %/year

Refining has been transformed into
an industry that is once again attracting significant investment. Many factors
have converged to improve dramatically
the industry’s profitability, especially in
the US:
• Growth. Oil demand has increased
significantly.
• Historic underinvestment. Refinery
capacity and supply growth have lagged
demand.
• Oil prices. High crude prices and
widening light-heavy crude price differentials have provided a significant
margin boost for highly upgraded
facilities.
Hurricanes, growing deficits, and
recent specification changes have further stoked the US boom. New capacity,
however, will hit the market in the next
few years.
Based on our Global Products’ Outlook service, we conclude that demand
will outstrip capacity additions for the
next 2 years, thus maintaining the current sustained period of strong refining
margins. In the medium term, however,
the market may begin to rebalance by
around 2010 as more capacity is added.
A critical market to watch as a
bellwether for any correction is the US
gasoline market. Consumption there
represents more than 40% of total
global gasoline demand, and the US
is home to about 20% of total world
refining capacity (Fig. 1).
By year 2020, the US gasoline deficit—a key factor underpinning margins
in the Atlantic Basin—could be significantly lower than it is today because
domestic gasoline supply will increase.
There could be fierce international
competition, therefore, to supply the US
market, and potential major implications for global trade flows.

stimulating a market response for both
demand and supply.
In the short term, oil product consumption has remained surprisingly
inelastic to price fluctuations. Wood
Mackenzie maintains, however, that in
the medium to long term, consumers
will begin to respond.
This response will take the form of
improved automobile energy efficiency
and the greater use of alternative energy
products. The key questions concern the
degree of the response and the ultimate
impact that it will have on refinedproduct demand.
On the supply side, there has been a
wave of refinery investment announcements caused by the prospect of attractive returns. The primary questions are:
How much of this new capacity will be
built? Where and when will it be built?
And what will be the impact upon oil
product supply?

Response to high oil prices

US gasoline demand has grown
at 1.6%/year during the past decade
because car ownership and travel have
increased, while vehicle fleet efficiency
has changed very little. Passenger car
ownership has grown only slightly
during the past 20 years; much of the
incremental growth was in sales of light
trucks, such as sport utility vehicles
(SUVs) and multi-purpose vehicles.
These light trucks have less stringent mandatory fuel-efficiency standards than cars. Indeed, the average
fuel efficiency of the light-truck fleet
has remained largely unchanged since
1990, although the passenger car fleet
efficiency has improved somewhat.
There were 780 cars/1,000 people

Our analysis includes all known
and realistic capacity expansions and
upgrading projects, and allows for the
effects of capacity creep. We believe that
the high number of refinery investments being implemented in the US
will have an effect on the country’s
utilization rates. Shut-downs to tie in
new infrastructure will prevent US
utilization rates from rising above 90%
in 2010.
Although the 2005 deficit was inflated due to hurricane disruptions, the
US gasoline deficit is forecast to drop
markedly by 2010, back to levels seen
in 2001-02 level (Fig. 3). After 2010,
this deficit is expected to reduce even
more because incremental refining supply will outpace ever-slower demand
growth.

construction costs also have an effect.
Although the effect of delivery delays
on some long lead items, such as large
pressure vessels needed for hydrocrackers, can be minimized by smart projectmanagement strategies, rising costs have
already caused some postponements
and even project cancellations.
In addition to the large number of
small expansions totaling slightly more
than 700,000 b/d, there are three major crude expansion projects in the US:
• The 325,000-b/d expansion of
Motiva’s Port Arthur, Tex., refinery.
• The 180,000-b/d expansion of
Marathon Oil Co’s. Garyville, La., refinery.
• Chevron is evaluating expanding
its Pascagoula, Miss., refinery to become
the second largest in the US. This would
involve adding at least 200,000 b/d of
capacity to the existing 325,000 b/d.
We expect all of these major expansions to proceed, although not all of
them will start up by 2010. There is one
new grassroots refinery proposed, the
150,000-b/d Arizona Clean Fuels refinery in Yuma. We do not believe, however, that this refinery will be constructed
within the next decade, if ever.
The total additional crude capacity
currently announced in the US, and
which Wood Mackenzie believes to be
realistic, is about 1.1 million b/d added
by 2010.

on stream and the effects of increasing biofuels use, particularly in Brazil.
Much of the crude capacity in Latin
America is being developed primarily
as a means of monetizing extra-heavy
crude reserves.
These findings have some fundamental long-term implications. Refiners in
Europe and Latin America that currently
rely on exporting products to the US
could find competition for this market becoming increasingly fierce. New
capacity being built in Latin America,
which will push this region further into
surplus, will need to find alternatives
to the US markets, possibly as distant as
Asia.
Although this may be an opportunity
for shipping companies, it does not
bode well for long-term refining profitability in Latin America. Moreover, any
additional new crude capacity in the region beyond that which Wood Mackenzie is already forecasting could further
increase the risk of a capacity overbuilds
and depressed refining profitability in
the long term.

Americas—overall outlook

This article draws upon an in-depth
analysis that Wood Mackenzie has
completed for North America and Latin
America. This analysis forms part of
our newly developed Global Products’
Outlook service, which analyzes the
fundamental market issues facing refiners. ✦

The analysis from our Global Products’ Outlook service shows that, in
overall terms, North America currently
has a large deficit of oil products supply
vs. demand. Wood Mackenzie’s view is
that this region’s deficit of oil products
could fall significantly by 2020 as a result of increased crude capacity (mainly
in the US) outpacing growth in oil
product demand.

sisted of either groupings of limestone
boulders or prefabricated reef modules (Fig. 1), both of which served as
substrate for live bottom community
development.
The boulder sites consisted of
limestone boulders spread across the
mitigation area. The limestone used to
construct the limestone boulder sites
had specific gravity of 2.1 to 2.6 and
median diameter of 3 ft. These specifications ensured that the boulders maintained their integrity when exposed to
salt water dissolution. The module sites
consisted of simulated reef modules
arranged in a nonlinear fashion. The
modules contained a minimum of 75%
exposed limestone,
with the remain-

ing exposed concrete surface brushed to
expose the limestone aggregate.
The spatial arrangements used in
habitat placement were chosen to increase the overall benefit of the habitat.
The sites selected for habitat placement
were located in the vicinity of the pipeline trench, near natural live bottom
areas and on sand bottom that did not
exceed 0.6 m thick. Gulfstream established three limestone boulder sites
(150 m × 150 m) within each of three
depth zones (12-21 m, 24-30 m, and
30-60 m).
The prefabricated reef modules consisted of limestone in a concrete matrix
and were also placed in 150-m × 150m areas. A total of 153 reef modules
formed three groupings of 17 modules
within each of the three reef module
areas (Fig. 2).
Part 2 of this article (OGJ, Jan. 8,
2007, p. 52) discussed the findings of
Gulfstream’s postconstruction monitoring program, focusing on epiflora and
epifauna. Part 3 of this article, presented
here, evaluates the success of the habitat
replacement sites in terms of both
colonization by sessile epifauna, and
habitat use by reef fishes. This evaluation includes:
• Comparison of epifaunal-epifloral
abundance and community structure at
the habitat replacement sites with unaffected live bottom reference habitat.

Gulfstream used prefabricated reefs such as this (left) to provide seafloor replacement environments (right) for epiflora, epifauna, and fish disturbed by its
pipeline construction (Fig. 1).

Methodology
Video documentation surveys
delineated live bottom areas close to
the pipeline route before construction
began. Entering the live bottom polygons and pipeline corridor route into
a geographic information system (GIS)
randomly established the reference
habitat stations for biological comparisons. Unaffected live bottom polygons
near the habitat replacement sites and
outside of the pipeline corridor served
as potential reference habitat station
locations.

Epifauna-epiﬂora sampling
Two different types of sampling,
transects and photostations, estimated
the percent cover of sessile epifauna and
epiflora within the habitat replacement
areas and reference habitat. Transect
coordinates were provided to the field
survey crews, which entered them into
the vessel’s navigation system before
deployment. The survey vessel navigated
to the coordinate locations, where divers were deployed.
In the shallowest depth zone, survey
divers navigated to each transect coordinate end point and established a transect end point marker. After establishing
the transect end points, survey divers
measured the transect with a weighted
tape measure to verify the transect
length.
In the two deeper zones, survey crews
provided divers with one end point
coordinate and a defined azimuth for
each transect. After navigating to the end
point, survey divers extended a weighted
tape measure 25 m along the defined
azimuth and established the second transect end point.
Divers used an Olympus Camedia C5060 wide-angle digital camera with 5.1
megapixel capacity to collect the transect

affixed to the bottom held the camera.
The retractable rod allowed divers to accurately maintain a fixed distance from
the seafloor during photograph collection, providing a fixed scale for each
photograph.
Divers photographed the entire
length of each transect using sequential,
overlapping photographs that contained
a clear view of the tape measure within

each frame. Survey crews established
three random 25-m transects inside
each habitat replacement site and reference habitat (Fig. 2).
Gulfstream established permanent
photostations on three limestone
boulders, two reef modules, and nine
reference sites in the shallowest depth
zone. Each photostation collected four
photographs that were later combined
as a mosaic capturing 0.707 sq m of
habitat.

Photostation information collection
happened in May 2005, with transect
information collected in August 2005.
Analysis of the photographs focused
on percent biotic cover, species richness, and species diversity. Gulfstream
analyzed all photostation images and 45
randomly selected photographs from
each transect.
Photographic analysis followed
random point analysis as described by
Bohnsack. This method electronically
transposes 100 random dots onto each
image. It then determines percent biotal
cover for a given taxon by tabulating
the percentage of dots touching organisms of each individual taxon. Averaging
data from individual images produces
a mean for the entire photostation or
transect.

survey as rugosity. The ratio of linear
distance traversed by a fixed length
of chain yielded the rugosity at each
station. The 9.6-m chain traversed less
distance in areas with a high degree
of topographic relief, showing greater
rugosity.

A series of statistical tests compared
epifaunal-epifloral and fish abundance
and community assemblage at the habitat replacement stations to that found at
unaffected hard-live bottom reference
stations. Specifically, T-tests or one-way
ANOVA tests addressed differences in
abundance values. A nonparametric
Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis
ANOVA on Ranks mitigated circumstances when assumptions of normality
and heterogeneity of variances could
not be satisfied with standard transformation.
If ANOVA results showed a significant p-value, a Student-Newman-Keuls
(SNK) or Dunn’s multiple comparisons test was performed (α = 0.05). A
Spearman rank correlation test determined if a relationship exists between
fish abundance and habitat complexity
(e.g., rugosity). Analysis of similarities
(ANOSIM), a PRIMER v5 multivariate
analysis technique, assessed differences
in the community assemblage between
habitat replacement types and reference
stations. If ANOSIM results showed a
significant difference between groups, a
similarity percentages (SIMPER) analysis
(another PRIMER v5 multivariate analysis technique) was run to determine
which groups were most influential in
creating the differences.
The SIMPER technique examines
not just the average similarity within a
group, but also the average dissimilarity
between groups. Analysts square roottransformed the data prior to applying
ANOSIM or SIMPER. Clarke and Warwick recommend the use of Bray-Curtis
similarity matrices as well.

The four diversity indices calculated
include:
• Margalef’s Species Richness (d).
• Pielou’s Evenness Index (J).
• Shannon-Wiener (H’).
• Simpson’s (1-Lambda’).
Margalef’s and Pielou’s indices bias
toward rare species, while the Simpson
index is biased toward dominant species. Shannon-Wiener is generally the
most balanced index of the four, but it
is still sensitive to rare species.
Some analyses classified fish species
according to their predominant habitat:
pelagic or demersal. Specifically, Peterson Field Guides: Atlantic Coast Fishes,
Fishes of the Gulf of Mexico, Volume
1, and Fishbase provided the bases for
habitat classification.
If a habitat use description was not
given for an individual species, the description given at the next higher taxonomic level, usually family, classified
the species. The following guidelines
governed assigning each fish species to
Oil & Gas Journal / Jan. 15, 2007

one of the two categories:
1. Demersal (Benthic)—bottomdwelling; occurring on the seafloor,
whether shallow or deep water.
2. Pelagic—living in open waters
away from the bottom or a demersal
species that commonly preys upon benthic organisms.
For example, filefishes (Aluterus sp.),
are not considered demersal, but they
feed on benthic organisms such as softbodied invertebrates and sponges.
Recognizing the presence of pelagic
species is important as many tend to
be schooling fishes, which can skew
statistical analyses.

analysis of commercially important species. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council’s Commercial Fishing

Worldwide, over 50% of all pipelines coated use
materials which shield (block) cathodic
protection currents if disbondment occures.
Even the best corrosion coatings will develop
disbonded areas over time. Solid backed
polymeric coatings (such as shrink sleeves,
tapes, and most multilayer systems) often
perform well as coatings, but when they
disbond, they are proven to prevent your
cathodic protection system from working.
Cathodic shielding is a serious problem and a
documented problem. Since the late 80’s there
is a large body of published research on
shielding. Much of this research can be seen on
our website.
Corrosion coatings which permit the passage of
cathodic protection currents to water under
disbonded areas are called “fail/safe” coatings.
In other words, if the coating fails, your
cathodic protection current can keep you safe.
There are two types of corrosion coatings which
are proven to allow the passage of protective CP
currents. One of these proven “fail/safe”
coatings is fusion bond epoxy.
The other proven “fail/safe” corrosion coating is
Polyguard RD-6. We have sold RD-6 since
1988, so there are many hundreds of
installations. We know of no project where
serious corrosion or SCC has been found under
the rarely seen disbonded areas of RD-6.
With a track record like this, it’s time for
some serious advertising of Polyguard RD-6.

ment to the following management
plans of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM),
determined which species were of commercial interest.

Results
The transect information showed

that a diversity of fauna was found
within the habitat replacement areas
(Fig. 3) and that biotic cover was 10
times greater in habitat replacement
stations than at reference habitat stations (Table 1). Percent biotic cover was
also significantly greater in the habitat

replacement areas than in the reference
habitat for all of the dominant taxonomic categories except gorgonians
(Fig. 4).
Photostation information also
showed that mean biotic cover in
habitat replacement areas (93.9, 1.0%)
was more than 25 times greater than
in the reference habitat (3.3, 1.8%).
The difference in cover was significant
for habitat replacement areas as compared to reference habitat photostations
but not between habitat replacement
types (one-way ANOVA, F = 440.3, P
= *0.001, SNK multiple comparison
results) which were almost identical for
the limestone boulder (mean = 94.6,
1.4%) and reef module (93.6, 1.4%)
stations.
The transect information showed
the dominance of turf algae, macroalgae, and coralline algae at the habitat
replacement stations (Fig. 4). This coincided with the photostation information showing that cover was dominated
by turf algae along with Cladocora
arbuscula (coral) and Halisarca sp.
(sponge). Taxonomic diversity in the
habitat replacement sites varied significantly from that of the reference habitat
(Table 2). The community structure in
the habitat replacement sites also varied
significantly from the natural hard-live
bottom reference habitat using PRIMER.
SIMPER analysis showed a greater number of algal species (including coralline
algae) contributing to the difference in
community composition (Table 3).

From the Subscribers Only area of

Corruption ﬁght
should target
government excess
Democrats deserve applause for making
ethics reform the ﬁrst legislative thrust of
the 110th Congress.
That Congress needs cleansing is part
of the reason that Democrats now control
both houses. They inherit the role of sanitizer even though members of their party
contributed to the mess.
On the ﬁrst day of the new congressional session, the House passed a series

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

of rule changes prohibiting representatives
and their employees from accepting gifts or
travel from lobbyists and from traveling in
corporate aircraft.
In the stench lingering behind favors
spread around Washington by imprisoned lobbyist Jack Abramoff, the crackdown is refreshing. But it doesn’t address the core problem.
Corruption happens when people in
positions of authority have too much of
other people’s money to spend. It results,
in other words, from oversized, overactive
government. The Democrats don’t seem on
track to solve that problem. They seem, in
fact, determined to aggravate it.
On a calendar for the Democratic
agenda published by the ofﬁce of new
Senate Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of
Maryland, the date Jan. 18 has this entry:
“End subsidies for Big Oil and invest in
renewable energy.”
Comment on the ﬁrst part of that
item must await clariﬁcation of what the
Democrats mean by “subsidies for Big Oil.”
But the intention to “invest in renewable
energy” is clear enough.
The Democrats plan to increase the expenditure of public money on political—;
meaning uneconomic—;energy. They will
commit other people’s money to popular
ideals such as lower reliance on foreign oil
if not outright—and unattainable—energy
independence.
All that money dedicated to all that
high purpose won’t go to projects able to
fulﬁll energy needs most efﬁciently, which
would be projects able to compete without
government help.
It will go to uncompetitive projects with
sponsors best able to inﬂuence ofﬁcial
decisions, at least some of whom will know
that airplane rides aren’t the only way to
practice persuasion.
A political party hoping to ﬁght corruption should be seeking ways to lower the
amount of other people’s money in play. It
can’t do this while pretending to “invest” in
energy, renewable or otherwise.

Crude suffers severe 2-day loss
The February contract price for benchmark US crude fell 9% Jan. 3-4 to near
18-month lows in the ﬁrst two trading sessions of 2007 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
The front-month contract dropped a total of $5.46 over those 2 days to close at
$55.59/bbl on Jan. 4. “We have to go back to early December 2004 to ﬁnd a 2-day
loss that was greater than the loss of this week,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. The market was closed Jan. 1 for the
New Year’s holiday and Jan. 2 for the funeral of former US President Gerald Ford.
“El Niño is taking a toll on the energy complex as it brings a warm Northern
Hemisphere winter. We believe this fact has already been reﬂected in natural gas
markets and is now showing up in oil,” said Adam Sieminski of Deutsche Bank AG,
New York. “Although the oil price could have further downside, we believe the drop
so far combined with dollar weakness will prompt the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries into further action to defend the oil price, which, in an environment of still robust world growth, we believe will eventually push the oil price back
up above $60/bbl in 2007.”
Adjusted for the euro’s increased value against the US dollar, a $55/bbl price for
benchmark US crude becomes the equivalent of just $42/bbl for that crude and $38/
bbl for the OPEC basket. That fact is “not lost on the OPEC ministers” who are paid
for their oil in dollars while trading with Europe in euros, Sieminski noted.
Estimates adjusted
The US Energy Information Administration lowered its estimate of US crude
demand by 567,000 b/d to 20.8 million b/d in October; its preliminary estimate of 21.3
million b/d would have represented a 5.3% gain from a year earlier to the highest
level ever recorded for October. But even if the US economy slows in 2007, rising
economic activity in Europe and Asia may easily offset the lost US demand, said
analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
“Finally, the real and existing threat of geopolitical wildcards such as Iran, Iraq,
Nigeria, and Venezuela continue to hang over the oil markets, and they most likely
won’t disappear anytime soon,” Raymond James analysts said. “Clearly, there are
more fundamental and concrete reasons to support the bulls over the bears.”
Nonetheless, Raymond James lowered its 2007 oil price forecast to $67/bbl from
$70/bbl previously and its natural gas price estimate for the new year to $7.50/Mcf
from $10/Mcf. “We still expect oil prices to ﬁrm as we move through 2007,” the analysts said. “On the North American gas front, however, our 2007 natural gas outlook
has deteriorated substantially from what we were expecting just a few months ago.
The change to our outlook is strictly weather-related.”
Raymond James analysts said, “We still look for gas prices to ramp up in the second half of the year as gas supplies begin to fall off; however, we now do not foresee
gas prices reaching a more normal 7:1 ratio with oil prices until 2008.”
As for 2006 price estimates, Raymond James analysts said, “For the ﬁrst time
in years, our natural gas forecast of $10.50/Mcf was actually too high. In fact, our
estimate was more than 30% higher than the actual full-year average of $7.24. For
the fourth year in a row, however, our bullish call on oil still proved too conservative,
due in part to escalating concerns about Iran in the ﬁrst half of the year. Even though
our original $58/bbl oil forecast for 2006 was more than $2 (or 4%) ahead of Wall
Street consensus at the time, it ended up falling short of the actual average by $7 (or
11%).”
Phil McPherson at C.K. Cooper & Co. in Irvine, Calif., noted that the February
natural gas contract ended 2006 at $6.30/MMbtu Dec. 29 on NYMEX. That was “lower
than last year’s closing price for the ﬁrst time in 5 years and a 37% decline yearover-year for the sector,” he reported. With a glut of gas supplies and continued mild
weather across most of the US, the price for natural gas is likely to average a modest
$7/Mcf for 2007 and could even touch $5/Mcf this year if warm weather persists,
McPherson said. He said the front-month crude futures price on NYMEX could fall as
low as $55/bbl by the end of the ﬁrst quarter of 2007 if a mild winter continues.

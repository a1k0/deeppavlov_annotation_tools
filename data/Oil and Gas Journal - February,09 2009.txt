CAUTION CAUTION
Is your company
ignoring this
guidance?
CONSIDER: If you use solid film
backed corrosion coatings, you may
be crippling your CP investment.

NACE Standard
SP0169-2007 states:
“Materials....that create
electrical shielding
should not be used
on the pipeline” 1.

There is a common sense reason for this. CP systems protect
pipelines by delivering electrical current to the steel surface.
Solid film back corrosion coatings have the property of high
dielectric strength, which means they block electrical
current. This blocking effect is called cathodic shielding.
Cathodic shielding has been the subject of dozens of
technical papers since the mid 1980’s.
Two corrosion coatings are proven to be non-shielding,
and allow passage of protective CP currents. One of these
coatings is FBE. The other is Polyguard RD-6.
If you are concerned that your organization is behind this
curve, visit polyguardproducts.com/failsafecoating.htm
and review the large body of information about shielding
problems.

Phone: (1) 214.515.5000

Polyguard has been ISO 9000 certified since 1996.
Current certifications are:
- American Natl. Standards Institute
- Dutch Council for Certification
- Deutscher Akkreditierungs Rat

COVER
Saipem’s Crawler completed tie-in of the 24-in. OD Medgaz
pipeline between Algeria and Spain 1.6 km off Beni Saf, Algeria, in
December 2008. Crawler raised the pipe left by Saipem’s Castoro
Sei in July 2008 and Saipem 7000 in November 2008, performed the final welds, and returned the completed structure to the
bottom. Castoro Sei lay pipe from both coasts to a depth of 550
m, with Saipem 7000 completing the deepwater section of the lay
(to 2,160 m) between the two shore-approach sections. Medgaz
will complete hydraulic testing of the line by the end of March,
with plans to put it into service in the second half. Medgaz will
deliver 8 billion cu m/year of Algerian natural gas to Spain and
Europe, adding both volume and diversity to European supplies. Oil
& Gas Journal’s special report on Worldwide Pipeline Construction,
beginning on p. 52, provides information on construction trends
and projects for both 2009 and into the future. Photograph from
Medgaz SA.

Interest

Indonesia places domestic gas sales over exports
Indonesian Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, on a state visit to Japan,
has reaffirmed the need for his country to prioritize its domestic
gas market over exports.
“I have spoken to the Japan Bank for International Cooperation
(JBIC) that we will help Japan (meet their gas demand) as long as
(the transactions) are under a win-win solution,” Kalla said.
“We need gas for domestic consumption, but we also need to
export gas for foreign exchange reserves,” said Kalla who did not
detail Indonesia’s plans to export gas to Japan this year.
“We have abundant natural resources. Japan is dependent on
us, particularly on energy,” said Kalla, who hinted that Japan, via
JBIC, would increase funding to Indonesia if it could secure gas
supplies.
Kalla also said, “It is better for Japan to put its money into Indonesia” than to invest it domestically. Kulla explained that, “domestically, Japan will receive interest of only 0.1%, while it will get a 3%
return from lending money to us.”
The Indonesian government recently urged gas producers in
the country to maintain production or produce more gas to meet
rising demand from domestic and overseas markets. Earlier, Indonesia’s acting coordinating minister for the economy Sri Mulyani
Indrawati said the government has put higher priority on the domestic market than on exports (OGJ Online, Jan. 25, 2009).

Inpex president upbeat about LNG developments
Inpex Pres. Naoki Kuroda, in an interview with Japan’s Nikkei
Business Daily, remains upbeat on his company’s prospects regarding the development of two LNG projects despite the current economic downturn.
Kuroda said Inpex is making a huge investment in LNG at the
moment because the lead time for natural resources development
is long. “We cannot do anything if we look at only short-term
trends.”
He acknowledged that demand for resources is falling amid the
economic slowdown but the Japanese firm nevertheless plans to
start production in Australia in 2015 and in Indonesia the following year.

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

“We expect that the economy will have recovered and demand
for LNG will have increased by then,” he said, adding: “It’s necessary to continue active investments from medium and long-term
perspectives.”
Kuroda noted that Inpex expects its two projects to produce
12-13 million tonnes/year, which accounts for about 20% of domestic demand. “The projects will contribute to a stable energy
supply and become a major revenue source for us,” he said.
Referring to the amount of investment for each project—$20
billion in Australia and $11.2 billion in Indonesia—Kuroda said
Inpex will “sort out the details of the plants before finalizing the
amounts.”
In fact, Kuroda said the actual costs would be lower than the
estimates because equipment prices are falling.
“We will also draw up the best combination of loans and bonds
to procure funds,” he said, adding: “We can make the projects
profitable and keep our finances sound with cautious risk management.”
Kuorda said Inpex has yet to start formal sales negotiations, but
large-lot customers are showing strong interest. Since LNG releases
less carbon dioxide than oil, it is attracting more demand.
Asked if Royal Dutch Shell Group is interested in participating
in the Indonesian project, Kuroda said: “More than 10 companies
have expressed interest, though we haven’t entered into tie-up talks
with any of them.”
“We have a 100% stake in the project and may consider letting
other companies take partial interests,” he said.
However, Kuroda downplayed any talk of a shakeout among resource development companies.
“We have no plans for a merger,” he said. “What’s necessary for
growth is to increase our stakes in overseas natural resource projects. We will consider tie-ups with Japanese and foreign competitors on large-scale oil and gas development projects that would be
difficult to handle on our own.”
Concluding, Kuroda expressed his company’s goal, saying that,
“Inpex has a daily output equivalent to 400,000 bbl of crude oil at
present, and we aim to increase that figure to 800,000-to-1 million bbl and join the ranks of the semimajors in the future.” ✦

Moosebar shale test drilling in British Columbia
Canada Energy Partners Inc., Vancouver, BC, spudded a horizontal exploration well to Lower Cretaceous Moosebar shale in northeast British Columbia.
The wellsite, near Hudson’s Hope west of Dawson Creek, was
chosen near the site of an unstimulated natural gas flow that occurred from the Moosebar shale during the drilling of a deeper
well for coalbed methane in the Lower Cretaceous Gething formation (OGJ Online, Jan. 5, 2009). Canada Energy is drilling the well,
expected to take 2 weeks, in a joint venture with GeoMet Inc.,
Houston. It is the first horizontal well to target the Moosebar shale
on Canada Energy’s 50,000-acre Peace River project. Under the
joint venture agreement, Canada Energy is operator of the Moosebar shale rights.
In addition to the 50% working interest it already owns, Canada
Energy has the right or option to earn an aggregate 75-87.5% interest in the Moosebar shale rights under the acreage subject to certain drilling obligations and elections by the joint venture partner.

BLM sale proceeds; eight tracts deferred
US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Feb. 2 ordered the Bureau
of Land Management to remove eight tracts from a Feb. 3 oil and
gas lease sale after Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal expressed concerns about them.
Salazar said his decision was a response to Freudenthal’s Feb. 2
letter to BLM Wyoming State Director Don Simpson concerning
three parcels near Shoshone National Forest and five parcels adjacent to the Jack Morrow Hills Coordinated Activity Plan boundary.
The lease sale of 137 remaining parcels totaling 163,526.4
acres proceeded as planned, raising nearly $2.4 million from the
sale of leasing rights and from rental fees on 112 parcels totaling
121,706.36 acres, BLM’s Wyoming state office said on Feb. 3.
It said that 74.43% of the total acres and 81.75% of the total
parcels offered were sold. Bids totaling nearly $2.2 million ranged
from the federally mandated minimum of $2/acre to a high bid of
$230/acre on one tract.
Successful bidders also pay a one-time administrative fee of
$140/parcel and yearly rental of $1.50/acre for the first 5 years
and $2/acre for the remaining 5 years of the 10-year leases, said
the Wyoming BLM office.
It said its next oil and gas lease sale is scheduled for Apr. 7.

Petrohawk’s Haynesville output hits 160 MMcfd
Petrohawk Energy Corp., Houston, is producing a gross 160
MMcfd of gas equivalent (MMcfed) from 16 operated Jurassic
Haynesville shale wells in North Louisiana.
The company’s budget is $690 million for Haynesville drilling
in 2009, when it expects to average 12 rigs and complete 75-80
gross wells. Petrohawk is targeting laterals of 4,300-4,600 ft with
as many as 15 frac stages spaced 325 ft apart to improve drainage and minimize the number of wells. While laterals at its first
four completions averaged 3,339 ft with 10 frac stages, the last 12
completions averaged 3,958 ft and 12 stages except one well that
had mechanical problems and only six frac stages.
The four wells turned to sales most recently are:
• Mack Hogan-4, in 3-16n-11w, Bossier Parish, initial rate of
13.4 MMcfed on a 24⁄64-in. choke with 6,350 psi flowing casing
pressure.
• Osborne 8-3H, 8-16n-11w, Bossier, 18.8 MMcfed, 24⁄64-in.
choke, 6,800 psi FCP.
• Roos A-5, 3-16n-11w, Bossier, 15.1 MMcfed, 24⁄64-in. choke,
6,100 psi FCP.
• Griffith 11-1, 11-13n-14w, DeSoto, 23.3 MMcfed, 28⁄64-in.,
7,550 psi FCP. Griffith is a long southwest step-out.
Two wells, Sample 4-1 and R.E. Smith Jr. 32-1, had mechanical
problems and lower than average production rates.
Of the 16 operated wells on production, 11 have been on production 30 days or more and averaged 15.2 MMcfed in their first
30 days. Eight have been on production 60 days or more and averaged 13.2 MMcfed in the first 60 days. The four wells on line more
than 90 days have averaged 8.8 MMcfed in the first 90 days.
All operated wells to date have been produced utilizing similar
production practices. Petrohawk will conduct a pilot program on
certain wells in 2009 by altering practices to restrict production
by using smaller chokes. It will monitor these wells for effects on
decline rate and mechanical operation.

Gazprom to explore Algeria’s El Assel license
Gazprom Netherlands BV has secured from Sonatrach the rights
to explore the onshore El Assel concession in the Berkine basin in
Algeria. Gazprom will have a 49% stake.
“According to provisional estimates, the recoverable oil reserves
of the said area amount to some 30 million tons. El Assel includes
three blocks covering a total of 3,083 sq km,” Gazprom said.
This, the company’s first project in Algeria, underpins its strategy to build a presence in Africa.
In 2006 Gazprom and Sonatrach pledged to cooperate under a
memorandum of understanding in Algeria, Russia, and overseas on
exploration, production, transportation, and asset swaps.
Algeria’s proved natural gas reserves total 4.58 trillion cu m,
with the majority of these in the central and eastern areas of the
country. Its proved oil reserves amount to 1.58 billion tonnes. ✦

Lindsey reﬁnery workers near job offers victory
Workers participating in an unofficial strike at Total UK Ltd.’s
Lindsey refinery in England have been told there will be 102 jobs
made available for British workers if they end their protest about
the employment of foreign workers.
Union representatives will present the offer for staff to vote on
Feb. 5 and if accepted will end the week-long dispute that gained
sympathy walkouts at refineries and electric power stations all over
the country.
This is a revised proposal after workers rejected a deal where
only 60 jobs out of the 200 available would have been created
for British employees. Total, the unions, and Acas, the employment
mediation service, have been in talks for 3 days to resolve the issue
that has been discussed in parliament and that triggered debates on
xenophobia and antiprotectionism.
The British workers complained about discrimination after Total
contracted Italian firm Irem SPA to build a diesel hydrodesulfurization unit (OGJ Online, Jan. 30, 2009). Total insisted that it has not
and will not discriminate against British companies and workers.
Irem was using Italian and Portuguese employees and had provided a floating hotel as accommodation for them. According to
the deal, none of them will lose their jobs.
Derek Simpson, joint secretary for Unite union, said: “The
problem is not workers from other European countries working in
the UK, nor is it about foreign contractors winning contracts in the
UK. The problem is that employers are excluding UK workers from
even applying for work on these contracts.”
The issue of contracting foreign workers for major projects in
the UK has led the Construction and Engineering Association to
recommend that companies first always consider whether there are
competent local workers. According to the guidelines published
Feb. 4, if there are, non-UK contractors should consider any applications.
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown described them as “the
common sense way of dealing in practical terms with the difficulties we face.”
The controversy’s political dimension is acute because the UK
will require at least 60% of its power stations to be replaced, according to Unite’s estimates. It is keen to see that British employees
have a sizeable amount of work.
There also been have different responses from the ruling Labor
party. John Mann, a Labor Member of Parliament, congratulated
unions for “exposing this exploitation and the absence of equal
opportunities to apply for all jobs.” He called for primarily British
labor to build new power stations. In contrast, Peter Mandelson,

project areas of North Dakota. Several wells in Elm Coulee field
in Montana sustained higher production after refrac, the company said. The 2008 refracs averaged 85 boe/d of incremental production and 80,000 boe of incremental reserves for an estimated
$500,000/well.
Refracs are applied 9-18 months after initial production, and
other operators are starting refrac programs, Encore said. ✦

the business secretary, has warned that stopping foreign competition from participating in local industries would turn the recession
into depression.
Brown’s phrase ‘British jobs for British workers,’ which was used
in 2007, has been a rallying cry for the strikers as fears about job
losses intensify during the recession. During the Prime Minister’s
Question Time in parliament, Brown defended the remark despite
accusations by David Cameron, leader of the Conservative party, of
a grave error of judgment and pandering to protectionist fears.

Midor awards contract for coking unit
Middle East Oil Refinery has awarded a €43 million engineering, procurement, and construction contract to Technip for the expansion of the delayed coking unit at its refinery in Alexandria,
Egypt.
The unit, which will have 30,000 b/d production capacity and
will be based on ConocoPhillips’s technology, is scheduled for
completion by third quarter 2010.

California reﬁnery temporarily shutting down
Big West LLC said its Flying J subsidiary, which filed for reorganizational bankruptcy last year, temporarily is shutting down its
Bakersfield, Calif., refinery for lack of cash with which to buy oil.
Flying J, which is based in Ogden, Utah, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy on Dec. 22. The refinery, which has a 65,000 b/cd capacity, supplies diesel and gasoline to California. The closure will
not affect Flying J’s refinery in Salt Lake City, Utah, the company
said. The Salt Lake refinery has a 30,000 b/cd capacity.
“For now, we will be winding down refining operations at the
facility,” Fred Greener, Big West executive vice-president, said of
the Bakersfield refinery in a Jan. 28 news release. “We hope that this
suspension will be short lived, and are working very hard to find
a solution that will allow resumption of the operations. We cannot
predict when that might occur.”
He said Big West contacted the United Steelworkers Local 219
to begin discussions about the future of its contract with union
employees at the Bakersfield refinery.

Total budgets Donges reﬁnery upgrades
Total SA has earmarked €120 million for the scheduled 5-year

on the Loire estuary. Donges is the group’s second largest refinery
in France. Work will be carried out between Feb. 22 and Apr. 20,
with 200 companies engaged on site.

around, but the refinery’s spokesperson told OGJ that products
have been stored, and customers will be fully provided with all
products during the down time.
The change of convection and radiation equipment of the three
atmospheric distillation furnaces will involve the largest expendi-

ture, €20 million. A further €60 million will provide a new amine
unit for gas desulfurization, a new torch, construction of double
lining for the troughs bordering the Loire River, and a laboratory.
In addition, €10 million will be spent for a thorough evaluation
of the 30,000 km of pipes at the refinery. ✦

Putin says ESPO may have parallel gas line
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said a natural gas pipeline might be laid alongside the Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean
(ESPO) oil pipeline and would carry gas toward China and the
Pacific Ocean.
“The project for the first section of the ESPO [oil] pipeline system is in its final phase,” Putin said, adding, “In the long term, a
gas pipe may be laid in the direction of the Pacific Ocean and China
parallel to the oil pipeline.” Russia’s state-owned pipeline monopoly OAO Transeft plans to commission the first section of the ESPO
oil line in December. The section, with a throughput capacity of
30 million tonnes/year, will extend from Taishet in East Siberia to
Skovorodino near the border with China.
The second section of the ESPO, which is scheduled to be completed by yearend 2013 or the beginning of 2014, will extend from
Skovorodino to the port of Kozmino on Russia’s Pacific coast.
Russia’s transport Minister Igor Levitin said last month construction of the export terminal in Kozmino, as well as the port’s
approach railways, will be completed in 2010.
On completion of the ESPO’s first section, up to 15 million
tonnes of oil will be delivered by railway to the port of Kozmino
for further shipment to Asia Pacific states, including Japan. An additional 50 million tonnes of crude will reach the port of Kozmino
on completion of the ESPO’s second section.
Meanwhile, Russia’s subsoil use agency Rosnedra has set a starting bid price of $50.3 million at an auction for the rights to the
East Talakan field in Eastern Siberia.
Russia’s Vedomosti business daily reported that Surgutneftegaz,
which is developing the adjacent Talakan field, is likely to get the
rights to East Talakan, although Gazprom is also a leading candidate. The paper reported that East Talakan field holds proved and
probable reserves of 9.9 million bbl of oil, 22.9 billion cu m of gas,
and 0.2 million tonnes of gas condensate.
According to analyst BMI, future development of oil from the
East Talakan field “is likely to contribute to planned throughput for
the ESPO line.” This year, BMI said, Surgutneftegaz is expecting to
boost initial Talakan production to 40,000 b/d, with output expected to reach 120,000 b/d by 2015.

Tokyo Gas to build fourth LNG terminal in Japan
Tokyo Gas Co., which currently operates three LNG regasification terminals in Japan, has selected the coastal city of Hitachi in
Ibaraki prefecture as the site for its fourth facility, the firm’s first in
20 years.
Tokyo Gas, which operates two LNG receiving facilities in the
Yokohama area and one in Sodegaura, will spend some 100 billion
yen on the Hitachi facility, which will include docks for tankers,
storage tanks, and regasification equipment.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The new terminal is scheduled to start operations in 2017-18,
but the firm released no information on its size or its sources of
supply.
Generally, the new terminal is expected to help meet the longterm growth in demand from industry as Tokyo Gas’ industrial gas
sales have been rising at an average of 7%/year since 2003-04 and
now account for about 40% of all its gas sales.
More precisely, the decision—announced by Tokyo Gas president Mitsunori Torihara—follows earlier efforts by the firm to increase its supply of gas to the Hitachi region.
In 2007, Tokyo Gas said it would supply Hitachi Ltd.’s power
station in the city with natural gas from July through a new satellite
LNG terminal in Ibaraki prefecture—a move aimed at expanding
the company’s natural gas user base to include areas that lack gas
pipelines. A Tokyo Gas spokesman said the firm would deliver LNG
to the satellite terminal by truck from its main Sodegaura LNG
terminal in adjacent Chiba prefecture before regasifying the LNG
and selling it in Hitachi.
Tokyo Gas plans to provide 50,000 tonnes/year of gas to the
power station and expects to double the volume by developing
new customers in the area, the spokesman said.
The Ibaraki satellite terminal, which has a 2,400-kl tank and
three 7.5-tonne/hr regasification units, is the company’s second
satellite LNG terminal—the first was also built in Ibaraki prefecture
in April 2006, with two 400-kl tanks.
This week’s announcement of the new regasification terminal at
Hitachi comes despite figures announced by Tokyo Gas this month
showing a slight dip in its recent sales of natural gas.
Total gas sales volume by Tokyo Gas for December 2008 came
to about 1.169 billion cu m, down 112.08 million cu m from the
same period last year.
Sales of residential gas totaled 326.9 million cu m, down 8.7%
from December 2007 due to fewer counted days and higher temperatures, which caused a heating and boiling water demand decrease.
Commercial, public, and medical use volumes totaled 210.3
million cu m, down 7.4% from last year due to fewer counted days
and higher temperature days from that of the previous year, which
caused heating demand decrease.
Although industrial use represents a larger percentage of Tokyo
Gas’ sales, recent demand totaled about 442.95 million cu m, down
11.5% from last year as existing customers use less.
Volumes for wholesale supply to other gas companies totaled
189.3 million cu m, down 3.5% from last year. Wholesale gas suppliers sold less to high-volume customers.
On a cumulative basis, Tokyo Gas said, gas volumes from April
through December 2008 totaled 986.2 million cu m, a decrease of
0.1% vs. the same period in 2007. ✦

The case for hydrogen
This is a response to the letter from
Thomas Wyman entitled “Hydrogen and
thermodynamics” (OGJ, Jan. 19, 2009,
p. 14).
Mr. Wyman bemoans the fact that it
takes more energy to make hydrogen
than is contained in that hydrogen. True,
but what about other energy carriers?
It’s a good thing that this thinking didn’t
prevail in the 18th century when inventors were developing a new energy carrier that could transmit large quantities of
energy nearly instantaneously over long
distances. This new energy carrier could
economically power homes, factories,
and buildings without producing any
pollution. But there was a major roadblock: It would take two to three times
more energy to generate this carrier than
it contained.
Fortunately, the likes of Faraday, Tesla,
Edison, Westinghouse, et al. were not
impeded by this take on thermodynamics as they developed electricity as
a practical energy carrier. Today a coal
plant might produce electricity at 36%
efficiency. Adding 8% loss in transmission, the overall efficiency might be
33%. Thus it takes over 300 MJ of coal
to make 100 MJ of electricity. Advanced
natural gas combined cycle power plants
might reach 60% efficiency for a net
55% system efficiency, but it still takes
more energy to make electricity than is
embodied in that electricity. Is this justification to renounce electricity?
Hydrogen is routinely produced by
reforming natural gas at 75% efficiency.
It takes 133 MJ of natural gas to make
100 MJ of hydrogen. Given that a fuel
cell vehicle burning hydrogen is at least
twice as efficient as a conventional car
burning natural gas, 100 MJ of natural
gas converted to hydrogen will propel a
fuel cell car 50% farther than that same
100 MJ of natural gas in a conventional
car. Furthermore, the fuel cell vehicle
will produce no urban air pollution, and
hydrogen, like electricity, can be made
from virtually any fuel.

Local
These federal initiatives come at the
same time that local resistance to new
pipeline projects is emerging, particularly in areas surrounding the Barnett
and Haynesville shales. Republican
legislators in Texas—one from Burleson,
just south of Fort Worth, and the other
from Houston—have introduced two
bills increasing landowner rights when
faced by condemnation for a pipeline
right of way.
The city council of Lewisville, Tex.,
also in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, is one
of 30 Texas municipalities, including Fort
Worth itself, to have passed a resolution
asking the Texas legislature to give cities
more authority in pipeline matters.
The resolution urges the legislature
to revisit the continued appropriateness of preempting municipalities from
regulating the practices of midstream
gas utilities and requests it confer additional authority upon municipalities
to “safeguard the interests of the public
and the long-term economic viability of
private property.”
From the president down to the city
council of 95,000 person towns like
Lewisville, everyone is trying to make
sure domestic energy development
doesn’t just happen, but happens in a
way congruent with the country’s overall needs and wants.
A large circle is formed. The development of the Barnett shale near Fort Worth
is one of the factors weighing against
prompt development of a pipeline to
bring gas from Alaska to the Lower 48. At
the same time, efforts to restrict pipeline
infrastructure inside and from the Barnett
shale may slow its growth, refocusing
attention on the need to develop as many
different resources as possible.
Obama, his cabinet, and the pipeline
industry itself all have their work cut
out for them. ✦

Deepwater investment
Oil and gas producers should expect a political
fight after a US appeals court ruled in their favor
about royalties from deepwater leases. They also
should prepare for wild claims about associated
“costs.”
Deepwater royalty relief, one of the most effective energy programs in US history, elicited outrage in 2006 when the New York Times reported
that the federal budget lacked estimates of royalty
income for deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases issued
in 1998 and 1999. The leases didn’t reinstate royalty, as did those issued in similarly administered
years, when oil and gas prices exceeded statutory
“thresholds.”
Courts, meanwhile, have been addressing the
question whether the Department of the Interior’s
Minerals Management Service had authority to
limit royalty relief on the basis of price for leases
issued in the five years from 1996 through 2000.
So far, the consistent answer is no.
In a case filed in 2006 by the former KerrMcGee Oil & Gas Corp., now part of Anadarko
Petroleum Corp., a federal appeals court on Jan.
12 unanimously upheld a lower-court ruling that
Congress did not empower Interior to impose
price thresholds during the years in question
(OGJ, Jan. 19, 2009, p. 39). The Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995, according to the courts,
stipulated volume but not price limits for leases
issued in 1996-2000.
Now, therefore, the federal government
might receive no royalty payments, until volume
thresholds are met, from deepwater leases of that
vintage. It also might have to repay $1.5 billion
collected from leases in which MMS improperly
inserted price thresholds. To a heavily indebted
government thinking it must spend feverishly to
stimulate economic activity, both prospects will
seem unbearable.

Economic perspective
If nothing else, this issue illuminates the
power of economic perspective. In the 1995 law,
Congress yielded future royalty revenue in order
to start a business promising national benefits.
At the time, oil and gas prices were depressed.
Royalty relief looked like a promising investment
in domestic energy supply, technology, jobs, and
18

nonroyalty government revenue. By 2006, oil and
gas prices were high and rising, and the forgone
royalty came to be viewed solely as cost.
About that, politicians soon will have much to
say. In 2006, the government was said to be facing
a $60 billion “loss” if it lost the Kerr-McGee-Anadarko case. That number came from a 2004 MMS
estimate subsequently found to have been based
on overestimated production.
Since then, the Government Accountability
Office has made two estimates of the value of forgone royalty on future production from deepwater leases. These estimates naturally vary with oil
and gas prices. In fact, GAO published its second
estimate last June to accommodate its forecasts to
the unprecedented prices prevailing at the time.
Since then, off course, crude has lost two thirds of
its value.
The GAO estimates provide a framework against
which to gauge “cost” complaints likely soon to
emanate from Congress. For the threshold-free
1998 and 1999 leases, GAO estimates the total value of forgone future royalty at $4.3-14.7 billion,
depending on commodity prices and production. The price ranges assumed for these years are
$50-100/bbl for oil and $6.50-8/Mcf for natural
gas. To project forgone future royalty for leases
issued in 1996-97 and 2000, GAO uses a different
price range: $70-100/bbl for oil and $6.50-8/
Mcf for gas. It estimates forgone royalty from these
leases at $15.1-38.3 billion.

Royalties in ﬂux
Depending on future prices and production,
then, the value of royalty relief for future production from deepwater leases issued in 1996-2000
could be as low as $19.4 billion or as high as $53
billion. These are totals spread over production
lives assumed by GAO to be about 25 years. Over a
quarter-century, these “costs” aren’t extreme.
Against the 1 million b/d of oil and nearly
3.5 bcfd of gas now produced in deep water by
an industry that would be nowhere close to its
current level of development without past royalty
relief, the cost, which involves no real expenditure
of public money, looks a lot like investment. Some
might even call it stimulus. ✦

The world has always held risks for
upstream oil and gas companies, and
it certainly shows no signs of becoming less risky in the near future. In fact,
many would argue quite the reverse
based on the prevailing dynamic environment of political tensions, price
volatility, fiscal instability, resource
nationalism, strong competition from
cash-rich national companies and
sovereign wealth
funds, and riskaverse financial
institutions.
Without a
healthy tolerance for risk and
the vision to see
the substantial resource opportunities
that exist internationally in the oil and
gas business, few companies venture
far into international exploration and
development activities. International
oil companies (IOCs) have accepted
this fact for many decades, and for the
past decade, so have some of the less
resource-rich national oil companies
(NOCs).
Opportunity and risk, which go
hand-in-hand, are two facets of uncertainty. There are good reasons why oil

and gas companies more rigorously
evaluate and, where possible, quantify
the risks to which their operations,
physical assets, and financial resources
are exposed.
They also are keen to calculate their
potential financial exposure to extreme
risk events that occur infrequently but
could have devastating effects. This
recognition and pressure from tightening regulation have together prompted
companies to develop enterprise risk
management (ERM) systems to integrate such issues rigorously and systematically.

4-high.
5-very high (extreme).
If a score of 1-5 is assigned to each
attribute and the scores of all five attributes of opportunity and risk are added
separately to yield two scores, those
scores can vary between 5 and 25.
By subtracting 5 from the sum of
the five attribute scores and multiplying
that sum by 5, the total risk and opportunity scores are simply manipulated
into an index scale of 0-100, which is

oil recovery technologies that might
recover substantial residual resources
from conventionally depleted giant
reservoirs in which large volumes of
petroleum remain in situ.
This illustrates a limited vision that
peak oil advocates continue to promote
as implying that the oil and gas industry
is already in irreversible decline.
The world envisioned in Fig. 4 is
one in which some 50% of the world’s
energy must come from renewables
and nuclear by 2100 because fossil fuel
resources would be in an advanced state
of depletion.
In contrast, Fig. 5 is a forecast based
on a high-priced petroleum environment with a vision of many opportunities for unconventional petroleum
resources. Indeed the resource base,
high prices, and the political will to
back the development of innovative, but
high-cost, technologies to exploit the
unconventional petroleum resources
suggests that fossil fuels may be supplying similar absolute volumes in 2100 as
they were in 2000.

fies the ethics standards to which all
employees are bound. There will be no
exceptions,” he said.
In a separate letter to MMS employees, Acting Director Walter D. Cruickshank asked them to keep ethics at the
forefront of everything they do as they
work in a conscientious and professional manner. He encouraged them to
report it if they see anything wrong,
and to contact the DOI agency’s ethics
office if they have any questions.

Gifts are prohibited
The code specifically states that MMS
employees are prohibited from soliciting or accepting gifts or other items of
monetary value from any prohibited
source or that are given because of the
employee’s official position.
“A prohibited source includes any
person or entity that is seeking official
action by MMS, does business or seeks
to do business with MMS, conducts activities regulated by MMS, has interests
that may be substantially affected by
the performance or nonperformance of
the employee, or is an organization the
majority of whose members” fit these
descriptions, it says.
The prohibition applies to any gift,
regardless of its value or nature, the
code emphasizes. It includes gratuities,
favors, discounts, entertainment, hospitality, loan, forbearance or any other
item having monetary value. It also includes services as well as gifts of training, transportation, local travel, lodging
and meals, “whether provided in-kind,
by purchase of a ticket, payment in advance, or reimbursement after expenses
have been incurred.” Receipt of a gift
is not made acceptable by comparable
reciprocation such as that which might
occur at a social event, the code says.
“In addition, even if a regulatory
exclusion or exception may apply, it
is never inappropriate and frequently
prudent for an employee to decline a
gift offered by a prohibited source or
because of his official position,” it adds.
The code also states that MMS
employees will act impartially and not
give preferential treatment to any pri-

vate organization or individual. “If an
employee’s actions become the subject
of scrutiny, they will be viewed afterthe-fact with the benefit of hindsight.
Therefore, an employee should consider
how others might view their actions.
Employees must always strive to maintain transparency of operations,” it says.
It says that MMS employees also will

not use federal property for unauthorized purposes. “Limited personal use of
certain office equipment is authorized
as long as it occurs on nonduty time,
does not interfere with official business,
is not a commercial gain activity or otherwise prohibited (e.g., gambling or the
viewing of sexually explicit material), is
of negligible expense, and is in compliance with applicable policy,” it says.

Arctic offshore
gets busier

E

quipment for responding to arctic
maritime accidents could prove
inadequate as polar sea ice declines,
energy demand grows, and vessel
traffic increases, according to a report
released Jan. 29 by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of New
Hampshire.
The Coastal Response Research
Center (CRRC), a UNH and NOAA
partnership on the university’s
Durham, NH, campus, produced the
report after a panel from arctic nation
governments, industries, and indigenous communities assessed potential
threats from maritime accidents in
the Arctic.
“The reduction of polar sea ice
and the increasing worldwide demand for energy will likely result in
a dramatic increase in the number
of vessels that travel arctic waters.
As vessel traffic increases, disaster
scenarios are going to become more
of a reality,” said Nancy E. Kinner,
UNH codirector of the CRRC and a
professor of civil and environmental
engineering.
Recommendations included studying the behavior of oil in cold water
and improving technologies for spill
response in arctic conditions. They
were based on the panel’s examination of five potential arctic emergency
response scenarios. Two of these
directly involved oil: an explosion on
a fixed drilling rig north of Alaska, and
a large spill resulting from a collision
between a tanker and fishing vessel.

Coldwater environments
Since 2005, CRRC “has been
investing in research on spill-response techniques and know-how in
28

coldwater environments,” the report
noted. It said the center is a collaborating partner with the Joint Industry
Project (JIP) on Oil in Ice coordinated by SINTEF, a leading Scandinavian research organization based in
Trondheim, Norway.
“The JIP is validating chemical
and physical behavior of oils and
response techniques (mechanical,
in situ burning, and dispersant use)
and developing best practices for spill
contingency plans for a variety of sea
ice conditions. CRRC’s contribution
to the project examines the potential
for exposure to biological resources
associated with first-year sea ice,” the
report said. Its other recommendations were to strengthen multinational plans and agreements for all types
of responses, improve logistical support capabilities for disaster response
entities, update arctic weather data
and navigational charts, and designate potential ports where damaged
vessels could be taken.

Sea ice declines
Sea ice coverage in the Arctic
reached record lows during the summers of 2006 and 2007, and recent
modeling by the US National Snow
and Ice Data Center suggests that the
Arctic will be consistently ice-free
during the summer as soon as 2030,
the report said.
“The decline of arctic sea ice has
resulted in increased activities such
as oil and gas exploration, mineral
speculation and exploration, northern moving fisheries, and tourism in
subarctic and arctic waters. Some of
these previously unnavigable waters
are becoming more available to vessel
traffic,” it noted. ✦

Outside employment
Employees also are barred from
holding or seeking outside jobs which
conflict with their official duties and
responsibilities. They must obtain prior
written approval to engage in activities,
whether for compensation or not, that
is related to their official duties with
MMS, or is related to DOI’s mission, or
is performed for a prohibited source.
“An MMS employee seeking outside
employment is responsible for ensuring that no real or apparent conflict
of interest exists and that a reasonable
person with knowledge of the relevant
facts would have no cause to question
the integrity of the bureau’s programs,”
the code of conduct says.
MMS employees also are expected
to disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and
corruption to appropriate employees, it continues. Notifications may be
anonymous but should contain as much
specific information as possible to allow
the matter to be adequately investigated.
MMS is committed to complying with
the Whistleblower Protection Act, which
safeguards the rights of anyone coming
forward in this manner, it says.
Employees also will avoid creating
the appearance that they are violating
the law or ethical standards, the code
indicates. “Often, even the appearance of impropriety is as significant
and damaging to the reputation of the
employee and to the MMS as an actual
infraction. Employees must be mindful of their responsibility to ensure that
their high level of ethical standards is
clearly evident to the American people,”
it says.
Salazar told the MMS employees in
Colorado that in a memorandum to all
DOI personnel, the department would
thoroughly review its own ethics policies and guidelines. He said that this
review would build on US President
Barack H. Obama’s order to the Office
of Government Ethics to develop rules
and regulations consistent with the
ethics pledge for all Executive Branch
employees.

a fundamental restructuring of MMS’s
royalty program so that taxpayers can

All ideas for reform will be on the
table,” he said. ✦

Murkowski: Interim Point Thomson
ruling good for Alaska gas line
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Alaska Natural Resources Commissioner Thomas E. Irwin’s interim
conditional decision to let leaseholders
drill on two expired tracts this winter
is good news for the Alaska natural gas
pipeline project, US Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alas.) said on Jan. 28.
Point Thomson field holds about
25% of the Alaskan North Slope’s 35 tcf
of proved gas reserves and is significant
to plans for a large-diameter pipeline
to the Lower 48 states, Murkowski said.
Disagreements between lessees and the
state on how best to produce the estimated 9 tcf of gas there have complicated negotiations to build the pipeline,
Murkowski explained.
“Now that we are seeing positive
steps toward resolving these issues,
it is my hope that we can quickly see

renewed commitment to those leases
results in speedy development of the
state’s resources,” she said.
The field covers 106,201 coastal
acres west of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, according to Murkowski.
ExxonMobil is operator and holds 53%,
with BP PLC holding 30%, Chevron
Corp. 14%, ConocoPhillips Co. 3%, and

other partners 1%, she said. A statecommissioned study last year found
that in addition to the gas, the field
holds 490-600 million bbl of natural
gas liquids and 580-950 million bbl of
oil, she said.
“Alaska natural gas is key to meeting
our national energy needs and reducing carbon emissions, but we cannot
afford further delay. We need to get our
gas to markets in the Lower 48 before
the country becomes dependent on
foreign gas, just as we are dependent
on oil from overseas,” said Murkowski,
who is the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee’s ranking minority member.

Basis of decision
In his Jan. 27 interim conditional
decision, Irwin said the lessees testified
earlier in the month—in an appeal of
his Aug. 4, 2008, decision that 31 leases
in the field had expired—that their
plans to drill two of the leases could
go forward if the Alaska Department
of Natural Resources gave them an ice
road permit before the end of January
and authorized drilling activities on two
of the leases.
“Appellants have testified that this
project provided for the drilling and
producing from wells by 2014. Appellants have specifically testified that they
are unconditionally committed to the
initiation and continuation of drilling

during this 2008 and 2009 winter season,” Irwin said. This includes “drilling
a well out of the conductors with a rig
capable of drilling through the Thomson Sands on that lease, and completing
the drilling of two wells, both penetrating the Thomson Sands reservoir, by
2010,” he said.
The lessees also testified that they
have mobilized equipment and materials to the ANS and hired subcontractors
to support the operation, modified a
drilling rig to make it suitable for the
high-pressure Thomson Sands reservoir,
and applied for and pursued all necessary permits, Irwin said.
He said he would reinstate Leases
ADL 47559 and ADL 47471 if the
appellants abide by the unconditional
commitments they made for the record, obtain Alaska Oil & Gas Conservation Commission and DNR approval
for the precise location and bottom
hole of each well and DNR approval of
the wells’ operating plans, and diligently pursue all necessary permits.
The appellants also will need to supply
him with drilling plans for the wells,
including rig contracts, and other
relevant documents within 2 weeks, he
said.
“This conditional interim decision
is intended to effect more expeditious production of state oil and gas
resources. However, I would remind
[the] appellants that, under the terms
of these two leases, the failure to diligently pursue drilling operations for
the purpose of production will result
in the automatic termination of these
leases,” Irwin indicated. The ruling
does not apply to the other 29 leases,
he said. ✦

Pirates seize another
tanker off Yemen

A job for
Global Hawk

Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Pirates operating in the Gulf of Aden,
shrugging off recent military and political developments aimed at curbing their
activities, hijacked the MV Longchamp, a
German tanker bound from Europe to the
Far East with a cargo of LPG. The tanker
was seized before dawn on Jan. 29 by
seven pirates in a corridor patrolled by EU
naval forces off southern Yemen, about 95
km from the port of al-Mukalla.
German firm Bernhard Schulte
Shipmanagement, which manages the
Bahamas-flagged vessel, reported that
crew members—12 Filipinos and an
Indonesian—were safe and that no ransom demands have yet been made.
This month there have been 15 attacks on vessels and three ships seized,
said Noel Choong, who heads the
International Maritime Bureau’s piracy
reporting center. More than a dozen
warships from the US, UK, France,
Germany, and Iran now patrol Somali
waters, and China and South Korea
have ordered warships to the region to
protect their vessels and crews.
In addition, Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada on Jan. 28 ordered
the Japanese navy to prepare ships to
join the international fight, as the island
nation depends on shipping for oil and
other imports. Hamada said his dispatch
order was an interim measure until Parliament passes a formal law outlining
the ships’ activities in their mission.
The decline in successful attacks since
foreign navies rushed to the busy sea
lane had raised optimism that piracy was
being curbed, but the outlaws are finding ways to evade the warships. They pay
“partners” in other countries for inside
information on ships’ routes, timetables,
guards, and other information, and thus
know which vessels are unguarded and
when and where to strike them. Success
has made them bolder. ✦

T

he oil and gas industry is concerned about maritime affairs,
especially piracy in the Gulf of
Aden. Besides disrupting the supply
chain, piracy sends insurance costs
soaring.
So far, the pirates have been getting the better of warships sent by
23 countries, including the US, the
UK, France, Russia, China, Japan,
Malaysia, and Sweden, to patrol the
region.
The explanation for the pirates’
success is simple: The area they work
in is far too large for the number of
available warships. Even naval commanders tasked with the job of deterring the pirates say that.
“It’s not an easy challenge, thousands of square miles of sea with
the air-space above. We could have
a force of hundreds and hundreds
of ships and still have gaps in our
patrol area,” said the UK’s Rear Adm.
Phillip Jones.

to reports, there are only a handful

This sounds like the right time

Hawk, the UAV of all UAVs. In case
you have not heard of it, Global
Hawk is produced by the Los Angeles-based Northrop Grumman Corp.
and, in effect, is an unmanned U-2

To cut to the chase, the highflying Global Hawk is a drone capable
of collecting intelligence from above
60,000 ft altitude for a day or more
at a time. Thus far, it has turned in
nothing but stellar performances,
largely for the US Air Force.

Natural gas is the world’s fastest
growing fossil energy source, contributing 287 bcfd or roughly 50 million b/d
of oil equivalent oil. Natural gas liquids
and condensate contribute another 10.5
million b/d of liquids to the oil supply
stream.
Global supply-demand of natural gas
has grown a sizzling 30% in the last 10
years, and according to the latest IEA
outlook is
expected
to further
increase
50% to
425 bcfd
by 2030.
Over the
last decade, new discoveries of natural
gas have averaged 103 tcf/year; in contrast, production-depletion of existing
reserves averaged 79 tcf/year.
Since 2000, 521 gas and gas-condensate fields have been discovered
worldwide with reserves totaling 897
tcf.
The top 29 “fields,” with reserves
varying from 265 tcf—supergiant
Osman-South Yolotan (Iolotan) field
in southern Turkmenistan—to 3.5 tcf,
account for three-quarters of the total
discoveries. Thirteen of these giant fields
are offshore (Table 1).
This select list also includes five

Woodford, and Deep Bossier--with
combined reserves of 185 tcf. Although
they were not technically discovered
during the 2000s, field-scale development did begin during this period.
Globally, there is a vast potential of
unconventionals–tight sands gas, coalbed methane, and shale gas–waiting to
be tapped. Together these represent an
estimated in-place volume of nearly 12
qcf (quadrillion cu ft) worldwide versus 18.4 qcf of conventional resources
discovered so far.1
Unconventionals have always been
considered second-rate targets because current production technologies
permit only modest recoveries on the
order of 1-10%. Conventionals on the
other hand have recoveries of 75% and
higher.
The US is the only country that has
implemented large-scale production of
unconventionals. These plays provided
24 bcfd or 47% of total US gas supply and 43% of ultimate recovery as of
2006.
Production of unconventionals in the
US has grown 71% in the last decade.
Worldwide, unconventionals presently
account for barely 9% of the total natural gas output, but their contribution is
expected to grow sharply in the future.
New discoveries always require a
comprehensive production evaluation
before a development plan for the field
can be made. The evaluation period can

Just 20% of the 521 new

Consequently, it is of

vital to supply analysts and
for the design of production

vide an early estimate of the production
capacity of newly discovered gas fields.
The model is intended to be applied
as soon as a wildcat is confirmed to be
a gas discovery. Establishing the real
potential of a gas field may take several
years after discovery, following a costly
appraisal drilling program.
The predictive algorithm, Equation
2, is simple and only requires a geologic approximation of the recoverable
reserves of the target field at the time of
discovery. It covers a wide range of field
sizes and is applicable to conventional
and unconventional gas fields. ✦

Goodbody analyst Gerry Hennigan
said Tullow and partners should be able
to extract “more than the 300-350 mbo
originally proposed” during Phase 1 of
Jubilee, which is to be developed with
17 wells.3
The Bedford Dolphin moved off site
in January to drill a Mahogany development well, after which it will drillstem
test Mahogany-1, according to Kosmos.
The partners will also spud a well on
the Tweneboa prospect this quarter, in
Deep Tano Block, with the Eirik Raude
semisubmersible, and an exploration
well on Teak prospect later in the year.

Tullow said on Jan. 8 that it’s targeting about 4 billion bbl of oil and gas
resources in the Gulf of Guinea off
Ghana and Ivory Coast. It plans to invest
€2.3 billion to develop the Jubilee field
and has other interests in shallow water.
Kosmos is targeting first production

Adjacent drilling
Hess recently finished drilling the
Ankobra-1 well in 1,732 m water to
3,963 m TD. It did not encounter commercially significant hydrocarbons. Hess
is currently acquiring 1,619 sq km of
new 3D seismic data and will drill a
well in the unexplored western half of
the license area (OGJ Online, Dec. 17,
2008).

Gas market
At the time of the Jubilee discovery in 2007, Ghana was working out
technical and economic details related
to new Nigerian natural gas expected
to reach Tema and Takoradi, Ghana’s
two international seaports via the West
Africa Gas Pipeline (OGJ, Aug. 27,
2007, p. 68). Ghana was to take 75% of
the line’s 134 MMcfd start-up volume,
expected to begin at the end of 2007.
West African Gas Pipeline Co. completed construction of the 1,033 kmWAGP pipeline in April 2008, but water

The extraction

temperatures and
control technologies employed.

Depending on the process used, the
released gases from retorting oil shale
include oxides of sulfur and nitrogen,
particulate matter, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons. The
potential also exists for the release of
other hazardous trace materials into the
atmosphere.
Fig. 1 displays the gases along with
potential uses for captured gases.

Air pollutants
Federal regulations cover many
emitted gases under the Clean Air Act
of 1963 (which was amended, most
substantially in 1990). As currently
written, the act sets limits for emissions
on particulate matter, ground-level
ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides,
nitrogen oxides, and lead.1
The oil shale industry will have access to commercial stack-gas cleanup
technologies for controlling emissions to within permitted quantities.
Some beneficial uses for these captured
hydrocarbon gases with these technologies include use in plant operations or
sales for conventional energy use.
The industry can control nitrous
oxides and sulfur oxides with commercially proven technologies developed
for petroleum refining and coal-fired
power generation.

CO2 emissions

According to the Department of
Interior Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) Programmatic Environmental
Impact Statement (PEIS) of December
2007, an oil shale project that processes
1.5 million tons/year of oil shale with
a surface retorting plant would emit
802,061 tons of carbon dioxide.2
The retorting process produces the
majority of these emissions. Other processes emitting carbon are the start-up

The barrier protects groundwater
from contamination with products
liberated from the kerogen while at the
same time keeping water out of the
heated area. Once pyrolysis is completed, the area is sufficiently cleaned
and the freeze wall is melted to allow
groundwater to flow through this area
once more.

Land disturbance
The estimated maximum cumulative land needed for a 1 million b/d oil
shale industry is 80,000 acres during
40 years.6 Of this total, the industry
needs about 50,000 acres for mine development, storage of overburden, storage of raw and processed shale, surface
facilities, off-site land for access roads,
power and transmission facilities, water
lines, and natural gas and oil pipelines.
It will require up to 20,000 acres
for urban development, and need the
remaining 10,000 acres for utility
rights-of-way.
The entire Green River formation
covers about 11 million acres, so that
the surface area impacted by development is about 1% of the total land area
of the oil shale region (Fig. 4).

Spent shale disposal

True in situ processes do not have the
problem of spent shale disposal; however, other subsurface effects, including
potential groundwater contamination,
are possible and must be controlled.
While the surface requirements are
relatively small, oil shale processing will
affect the local and regional environment. The actual affect on the land will
vary from process to process.
Mining and surface retorting processes create more land disturbance, but
existing reclamation regulations require
oil shale developers to restore the land

price increase compared

these recent trends in product demand,
a situation that calls for significant investment.
These are
the conclusions
of a December
2008 report
from Energy
Policy Research
Foundation Inc.
(EPRINC) entitled “The US Refining
Industry: Background and Perspective
for Policy Makers.”
Diesel fuel, which historically sells
at a discount to gasoline, now sells
at a premium, the report reminds us.
And because gasoline margins are now
resulting in negative crack spreads,
middle distillates are the only significant source of positive margins.
The recent increases in middle distillate prices are largely due to short-run
constraints in the global refining industry to adjust its product output to meet
adequately rising demand.
Existing US refineries are, “for the
most part, technically constrained to
relatively small yield shifts, although at
some facilities the shift to higher distillate yields has been impressive,” the
report said. “New investment in basic

capacity expansion might help rebalance the slate of products produced,
but most investment has gone to capital
equipment for making the existing
product slate cleaner and for using
lower-quality crudes. As investment
takes place in new refineries and/or
configuration adjustments are made at
existing refineries, we would expect the
large price differential between gasoline
and distillate to narrow.”
US refining returns on investment
are highly volatile but have historically lagged all US manufacturing, the
report said. EPRINC examined a sample
of refiner stock prices and preliminary
data of recent refinery margins and
concluded that higher margins and
ROIs prevalent for some refiners during
2005-07 are likely over.
Historically, US refinery capacity
has increased despite a decline in the
number of refineries since petroleum
price controls were removed in the late
1970s. Investments have resulted in
more robust and efficient operations in
fewer but larger plants; refinery complexity has increased substantially.
“As US refining became more complex and capacity more streamlined, the
global oil market changed as well,” the
report said. “Consumers’ demand for
fuels began to outstrip both the supply
of produced crude and global refining
capacity, creating a tight supply-demand
balance where supply was unable to
respond to increased demand or accommodate a supply outage without a price
spike.”

Reﬁning realignment
The report summarized historical trends in the US refining industry,
including the trend towards larger
refineries, consolidations, and a shift in
the refinery geographies.
The trend toward larger plants began
during World War II due to economies
of scale. In 1960, the average refinery
was about 32,000 b/d; by 1981, that
figure nearly doubled to 57,000 b/d;
and doubled again by 2007, when the
average plant was about 117,000 b/d,
the report said.
In the 1970s, US refiners began
increasing refinery complexity and
consolidating refinery sites in order to

control air emissions, produce 100%
unleaded gasoline, handle more foreign
crude due to reduced domestic output,
receive more waterborne crude, and use
more natural gas as a refinery input.
According to the report, refining
capacity growth in the US has gravitated
toward such coastal locations as the
Texas-Louisiana coast, West Coast, and
the Mid-Atlantic. Waterborne imports
now fulfill most US petroleum needs.
Refinery expansions have therefore centered on existing units with waterborne
transport accessibility and good crude
and product pipeline connections.
Exceptions to this general rule, the
report said, are landlocked midwestern
refineries that receive Canadian crude
via pipeline and from Gulf Coast supply
points. Some refineries in the Midwest
have been consistently upgraded, therefore, and are now receiving feed from
Alberta oil sands.

US reﬁnery upgrades
According to the report, investments
in US refineries have not led to a barrelfor-barrel increase in refinery throughput. It, however, allows refiners to make
products to greater specifications and
make them from crudes of decreasing
quality.
Some of the added capacity—notably hydrotreating for sulfur reduction—represents “staying in business”
investment, replacing “old” products
with low or ultralow-sulfur versions,
the report said. These investments
include coking, FCC, and hydrotreating
capacity.
Fig. 1 shows that US refiners have
increased coking capacity 1 million b/d
since 1991, a 63% increase.
“To some extent, more coking capability has increased product output;
more importantly, it has helped maximize the yield of gasoline and distillates
from heavier crudes,” the report said.

Growth in gasoline imports to the
US began in the late 1990s from about
500,000 b/d, reaching a peak of 1.6
million b/d during some high-demand
periods in recent years. In September
2008, US gasoline imports averaged
about 1.1 million b/d, which was more
than 10% of consumption.
In the US gasoline market, competition from international refiners plays a
key role in determining prices. Outside
US refiners are so entrenched in the US
gasoline market that they are regular
competitors, adding often-overlooked
competitive increment volumes of
products, the report said.
Distillate imports are as important
50

in the US as gasoline imports. But the
distillate picture is much more complicated than gasoline because exports are
also significant, the report said. In some
months, net imports are as high as
600,000 b/d, typically peaking during
the heating season.
Fig. 5 shows distillate imports and
exports. Until recent months, when
extremely strong global demand has
taken supplies from the US market, the
US imported about 7% of its distillate needs. But distillate exports grew
during 2008, peaking at 849,000 b/d
in August 2008, before declining to
313,000 b/d in September, according
to the report. The US has been a net

distillate exporter since late 2007.
According to US Energy Information Administration data, all distillate
exports in 2008 had a sulfur content of
15 ppm or greater; no ultralow-sulfur
diesel was exported. Furthermore,
refiners managed to increase distillate
production from the average barrel
of crude. This continues a trend that
started in 2002; its most recent effect
was in 2008, when refiners increased
distillate yields about 5% of the barrel,
mostly reducing gasoline production,
the report said.
Increased diesel demand for transportation of all types has caused the
middle of the barrel to be the highgrowth component of petroleum
consumption, the report said. Global
economic growth since 2004 resulted
in a 3 million b/d increase in distillate
consumption.
“Economic development in China, a
continued trend toward diesel passenger
cars in Europe, and trend growth in a
strong US economy all contributed,” the
report said. “The growth increment here
was the equivalent of two thirds of the
increase in refining capacity globally.”

Reﬁner proﬁtability
EPRINC feels that the true measure
of profitability is ROI, which is highly
correlated with but differs from, refiner
margins. EPRINC uses EIA data from
“Performance Profiles of Major Energy
Producers” to analyze the refining and
marketing segment.
EPRINC calculated US refining ROI
for 26 companies in EIA’s Financial Reporting System (FRS) database during
1980-2006. The US refining industry
has historically underperformed the
entire US manufacturing sector.
During the 1980s and 1990s, refining and marketing ROI averaged 5.2%.
For 12 of those years, ROI was less than
5%, according to the report. Returns
underperformed the manufacturing
sector until 2004, when for the first
time in recent history, refining and marketing ROI exceeded 10%.
Because EIA’s FRS data end in 2007,
EPRINC extrapolated using quarterly

data for the 11-firm FRS subset that
reported US net income through
second-quarter 2008 in EIA’s publication, “Financial News for Major Energy
Companies.”
Fig. 6 shows a large drop in net
income of the reporting companies
starting with third-quarter 2007 and
continuing through second-quarter
2008, when earnings were only 17% of
year-earlier levels. Earnings increased in
third-quarter 2008 but started eroding
before the quarter ended. Fig. 6 shows
the year-over-year change at the top of
each bar.
EPRINC’s analysis indicates that margin improvements in “recent years have
dissipated, and profitability has reverted
to historic levels, which are lower than
US manufacturing. Recent volatility in
oil markets makes generalization difficult, but it appears as if refining profitability—along with crude and product
prices—collapsed in late 2008.”

meaning total production costs for the
comprehensive refinery product slate
were subtracted from revenues realized
from the sale of all products. This gives
an overview of industry profitability,
while not detailing the role of products
individually, according to the report.
In 2007, average margin on refined
products was $4.78/bbl (11.3¢/gal), a
decrease from $4.85 (11.5¢) in 2006.
These are historically high margins and
coincident with high ROIs, 21.6% and
25.6%, respectively.
Margins, however, are volatile. As
recently as 2002, margins were $0.21/
bbl (0.5¢/gal). That corresponded to an
accounting ROI of –1.7%.

Lower utilization

Refinery utilization rates influence
profitability that is unrelated to refined
product prices, according to the report.
Individual product margins are calculated without accounting for operating
costs; that can give an oversimplified

declining since 2005, when ROI and
Margin data in Fig. 7 are net margins, refinery utilization both peaked (Fig. 8).

During some periods in 2005, capacity
utilization exceeded 96%, a very high
rate. For 2005 as a whole, utilization
averaged 90.5% despite outages from
Hurricanes Rita and Katrina.
Fig. 8 also shows a downward trend
in utilization—it has fallen to 88.8% in
2007, from 89.3% in 2006 and 90.5%
in 2005. Utilization for the first 8
months of 2008 is only 86.4%.
The factors lowering utilization are
falling petroleum product demand,
greater use of ethanol, and more
gasoline imports. The latter is due
to a surplus in Europe, with significant amounts of discounted gasoline
exported to the US, according to the
report. ✦

crisis and lower commodity prices
begin to affect infrastructure development plans..
Global demand for natural gas drove
a number of the large pipeline projects
set for completion in 2009. Long-term
natural gas pipeline plans (2009 and
beyond), however, seem to already
reflect the slowing in demand forecast
52

since, with fewer plans for pipelines
from producing regions such as Canada
and the Middle East leading the downward trend.
Fewer crude plans in both the AsiaPacific and Africa keyed an 18% 2009
slide in miles expected to be completed
in that sector from global totals the
previous year.
Plans for construction of product
pipelines in 2009 rose globally, driven
by the continued construction of ethanol pipelines in Brazil and new clean
products pipelines in Africa.
As 2008 began, operators had announced plans to build nearly 78,000
miles of crude oil, product, and natural
gas pipelines beginning this year and
extending into the next decade (Fig.
1), a 9% decrease from data reported
last year (OGJ, Feb. 18, 2008, p. 47) in
this report. The vast majority (nearly
75%) of these plans is for natural gas
pipelines, an increase from the previous
year.

Outlook
The downturn in worldwide pipeline
construction trends reflects the current
economic unrest but run counter to US
Energy Information Administration’s
energy consumption forecasts, which
show continued growth, even if more
slowly than predictions from a year ago.
EIA forecast world marketed energy consumption to increase by 50%
through 2030 (using a 2005 baseline),
a period that encompasses the longterm pipeline construction projections
stated here.
Energy demand growth will be
strongest, according to mid-year 2008
analysis, among countries outside the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This non-OECD
growth will be led by China and India,
whose combined energy use will more
that double over the projection period to one-quarter of world energy
consumption. US demand share will
contract during the same period from
22% to 17%.
Fuelling this energy demand growth

growth in non-OECD Asia of 5.8%/year
through 2030—led by China at 6.4%/
year, the highest projected growth
rate in the world—compared with 4%
worldwide. Each of these levels are flat
or slightly lower than EIA projections
from a year earlier, reflecting US-led
economic uncertainty and ending recent expansion in the projected rate of
GDP growth.
Structural issues that have implications for medium to long-term growth
in China include the pace of reform
affecting inefficient state-owned companies and a banking system carrying a
large number of nonperforming loans,
according to the EIA. Development of
domestic capital markets to help macroeconomic stability and ensure China’s
large savings are used efficiently supports medium-term growth projections,
according to the EIA.
EIA described the medium-term
prospects for India’s economy as positive, as it continues to privatize state
enterprises and increasingly adopt freemarket policies. EIA projects 5.8%/year
demand growth in India 2005-30.
In December 2008, EIA reduced
projected US energy consumption in
2030 to 113.35 quadrillion btu from
123.8 quadrillion btu, 10.45 quadrillion btu lower than the previous year’s
projection. This 8.4% drop in energy
consumption, combined with projected
increases in domestic supply, are projected to reduce net liquids imports by
2030 from the 54% projected in 2008
to 41% in the 2009 outlook.2
EIA projects domestic natural gas
production in 2030 of 24.28 tcf/year,
compared with the 19.9 tcf/year projected a year earlier. The increased production is more than enough to counter
the increase in projected consumption
also made by EIA. Pegged in 2008
at 23.4 tcf/year by 2030, this year’s
projections place 2030 consumption at
25.08 tcf/year, reducing net imports to
just 3% vs. the 14% projected in 2008.
Unconventional production will make
up the bulk of the supply increase.
The 2009 outlook projects the US
will be a net pipeline exporter by 2030.

Net pipeline imports of natural gas
from Canada and Mexico will fall from
2.94 tcf in 2006 to -0.16 tcf in 2030,
according to the EIA, which last year
pegged 2030 net pipeline imports at
0.5 tcf. EIA once again also sharply reduced the amount of LNG it expects the
US to be importing annually in 2030,
from 2.9 tcf in its 2008 annual outlook
to 0.84 tcf in this year’s publication.
Current pipeline construction plans
reflect the landscape described by EIA,
with the bulk of US work both this
year and looking forward centered on
moving new domestic production to
market.
OGJ has for more than 50 years
tracked applications for gas pipeline
construction to what is now called the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Applications filed in the 12 months
ending June 30, 2008 (the most recent
1-year period surveyed) reflect the
expected slowdown in US interstate
pipeline construction.
• Nearly 900 miles of pipeline were
proposed for land construction and no
miles for offshore work. For the earlier
12-month period ending June 30,
2007, 2,032 miles were proposed for
land construction.
• FERC applications for new or additional horsepower at the end of June
2008 fell even more sharply, reaching
more than 238,500 hp, all onshore,
compared with 713,000 hp of new or
additional compression applied for a
year earlier and 583,000 hp the year
before that.

Bases, costs
For 2009 only (Table 1), operators
plan to build more than 15,250 miles
of oil and gas pipelines worldwide at a
cost of nearly $61.5 billion. For 2008
only, companies had planned nearly
13,500 miles at a cost of more than
$37.6 billion.
For projects completed after 2009
(Table 2), companies plan to lay more
than 62,500 miles of line and spend
roughly $225.5 billion. When these
companies looked beyond 2008 last
year, they anticipated spending more

than $201 billion to lay more than
72,000 miles of line.
• Projections for 2009 pipeline
mileage reflect only projects likely to be
completed by yearend 2009, including
construction in progress at the start of
the year or set to begin during it.
• Projections for mileage in 2009
and beyond include construction that
might begin in 2009 and be completed
in 2009 or later.
Also included are some long-term
projects judged as probable, even if they
will not break ground until after 2009.
US average cost-per-mile for onshore
pipeline construction (Table 4, OGJ,
Sept. 1, 2008, p. 58) on FERC applications submitted by June 30, 2008, was
$3.38 million. There were no offshore
applications submitted.
US average cost-per-mile for offshore
construction (Table 7, OGJ, Sept. 1,
2008, p. 62) on projects completed in
the 12 months ending June 30, 2008,
was $15.17 million.
Based on historical analysis and a few
exceptions and variations notwithstanding, these projections assume that 90%
of all construction will be onshore and
10% offshore and that pipelines 32 in.
OD or larger are onshore projects.
Following is a breakdown of projected costs, using these assumptions and
OGJ pipeline-cost data:
• Total onshore construction
(14,428 miles) for 2009 only will cost
almost $48.8 billion:
—$3.4 billion for 4-10 in.
—$13 billion for 12-20 in.
—$9 billion for 22-30 in.
—$23.4 billion for 32 in. and larger.
• Total offshore construction (836

$12.7 billion:
—$1.7 billion for 4-10 in.
—$6.5 billion for 12-20 in.
—$4.5 billion for 22-30 in.
• Total onshore construction
(61,411 miles) for beyond 2009 will
cost nearly $208 billion:
—$1.5 billion for 4-10 in.
—$14.6 billion for 12-20 in.
—$19.7 billion for 22-30 in.

Colonial Pipeline Co. is proposing
an additional pipeline from Jackson,
La., to Austell, Ga., running alongside
the two current main lines to the extent
possible. The 460-mile Project ExCEL,
prompted by announced Gulf Coast
refinery expansions, represents a more
than $2 billion investment.
Colonial is currently conducting

to follow once the route is finalized. The
company hopes to begin construction in
2010, targeting a 2012 completion date.

pipeline from Colton, Calif., to Las Vegas,
Nev., and will increase the system’s capacity to 200,000 b/d, transporting products
for the military at Nellis Air Force Base.
A further capacity increase to more than
300,000 b/d is possible with the addition
of pump stations.
The new pipeline will parallel existing utility corridors between Colton
and Las Vegas. Following its completion,
the existing 14-in. line will be transferred to commercial jet fuel service
for McCarran International Airport and
any future airports planned in Las Vegas,
with the 8-in. pipeline that currently
serves the airport purged and held for
future service.

Start-up of the line is scheduled for
late 2009 or early 2010.
Holly Corp. and Sinclair Transportation Co. plan to jointly build a products
pipeline extending from Wood Cross,
Utah, refineries to a terminal north of
Las Vegas. The UNEV Pipeline project
includes construction of associated terminal facilities in Cedar City, Utah, and
northern Las Vegas.
The US Bureau of Land Management
issued a draft environmental impact
statement in December 2008.
The 400 mile, 12-in. line will cost
about $300 million and have an initial
capacity of 62,000 b/d, expandable to
120,000 b/d. It will serve refineries
and shippers along its route and interconnect to the Pioneer Pipeline.
The system is slated for completion
by the end of this year.

Special Report

Gazprom and Eni SPA agreed in
December 2007 to build the 560-mile
South Stream gas pipeline under the
Black Sea and through Bulgaria. Bulgaria and Russia reached agreement
in January 2008. On completion, the
$10-billion line could distribute gas to
northern and southern Europe, with an
estimated capacity of 30 billion cu m/
year. Participants plan to deliver first gas
through South Stream by 2013.
Gazprom Vice-President Alexander
Medvedev said in December 2008 that
work on both Nord Stream and South
Stream would continue despite the
financial and economic crises.
Plans to export Algerian gas via Italy
also progressed. Galsi SPA and Snam
Rete Gas SPA signed a memorandum
of understanding in November 2007
to construct the Italian section of the
planned 8 billion cu m/year Galsi
natural gas pipeline, which will deliver
Algerian gas to Italy via Sardinia.
Gasli shareholders are Sonatrach,

Edison SPA, Enel SPA, Hera Trading, Regione Sardegna, and Wintershall AG.
The project envisions four pipeline
segments: 640 km onshore between
Hassi R’mel gas field in Algeria and
El Kala on the Algerian coast; 310 km
between El Kala and Cagliari on Sardinia
in water as deep as 2,850 m; 300 km
between Cagliari and Olbia on the
northern Sardinian coast; and 220 km
between Olbia and Pescaia, southeast of
Florence, in water as deep as 900 m.
Sonatrach will deliver 3 billion cu
m/year into the system, Enel, 2 billion
cu m/year, and Hera Trading, 1 billion
cu m/year.
Work on the line was under way in
January 2009, with Snam Rete Gas CEO
Carlo Malacarne having said in October
2008 the line would enter service in
2012-2013
Austria’s OMV AG continues to
advance the 56-in. Nabucco pipeline,
which will bring some combination of
Central Asian, Caspian, and Middle East-

ern gas to the Baumgarten hub in Austria near the Slovakian border at a rate
of 31 billion cu m/year, before moving
it on to Western Europe. The $6.5-billion pipeline, spanning 3,300 km, is
expected to be completed by 2013.
Feasibility studies have led to a twostage construction plan. The first phase,
starting next year calls for 2,000 km of
pipe between Ankara, Turkey, and Baumgarten, allowing 8 billion cu m/year of
gas from the existing Turkish pipeline
network to be transported through the
line by 2012. Second-stage construction would begin in 2012 and build
eastward from Ankara to the Iranian and
Georgian borders (Fig. 2).
The US supports construction of
Nabucco, citing the need to move gas
into Europe though economically viable
and secure routes.
To deliver gas from Bovanenkovo
field—projected production 115 billion
cu m/year—Russia is building a multiline gas transmission system connecting

Construction calls for 1,420-mm OD
pipes designed to work at higher pressures than existing Russian lines.
Total pipeline length will exceed
2,400 km, consisting of the Bovanenkovo-Ukhta pipeline (1,100 km, 140 billion cu m/year) and the Ukhta-Torzhok
gas pipeline (1,300 km, 81.5 billion cu
m/year).
Gazprom began building the 72 km
subsea section of the BovanenkovoUktha line, crossing Baidarate Bay, in
August 2008. Construction of the main
trunkline began in December 2008.

Middle East
Iran, Pakistan, and India continued
discussions toward building the longcontemplated gas export line from Iran
to India during 2008. The $7 billion
project would transport as much as 2.2
bcfd of natural gas from the South Pars
field in the Persian Gulf through 2,100
km of 56-in. OD line. (Iran, 1,100
km; Pakistan, 750 km; India, 250 km).
Pakistan’s share of gas from the pipeline would be 1.05 bcfd. If India does
not participate, Pakistan would take the
entire volume.

stan, but India’s status remains uncertain and as of December 2008 pricing
disputes had reemerged between Iran
and Pakistan. In addition to difficulties reaching economic terms, India is
under US pressure to not participate in
the project and has security concerns
regarding having such a major energy
artery running through Pakistan.
Pakistan says it will require $1 billion to build underground storage
for gas to be imported from Iran and
Turkmenistan, according to the country’s petroleum ministry and the Asian
Development Bank in a joint study with
Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Ltd. (SNGPL)
and Sui Southern Gas Co. Ltd. (SSGCL).
Four stages of the 56-in. OD Iranian
Gas Trunkline (IGAT) system are still
under development. IGAT VI will transfer gas produced by South Pars phases
6-10 from Asalouyeh across 492 km to
Khuzestan province for consumption
and injection. Construction is expected
to be complete in 2009.
IGAT VII will move South Pars 9-10 gas
from Asalouyeh 878 km to Hormozgan
province and the Shar-Khoon refinery. Part
of the gas will be shipped onward to Sistan and Baluchistan provinces, with some
also potentially used for export. Completion is expected 2010-2011.

AFGHANISTAN

IGAT VIII, scheduled for completion
in 2009, will transport South Pars gas
across 1,050 km from Asalouyeh to the
Parsian gas plant and Tehran.
IGAT IX, slated for 2011 completion
and also termed the Europe Gas Export
Line, will move South Pars 9-10 gas
1,863 km from Asalouyeh to the Turkish border. Construction on the stretch
from Asalouyeh to Bidbolyand was
completed as of June 2008.
Iran expressed interest later in 2008
in finding an international partner on
a build-own-operate basis for the balance of IGAT IX, which could link with
either the proposed Trans-Adriatic pipeline or the proposed Nabucco pipeline
for exports further west.
Iran is also building a 2,163-km ethylene pipeline from Asalouyeh in southern Iran to the country’s northwestern
provinces. The pipeline will transport
ethylene to meet the feed requirements
of new petrochemical complexes in
Gachsaran, Khoramabad, Kermanshah,
Sanandaj, and Mahabad.
Construction of the pipeline began
in 2003 and is targeted for completion
in 2009-10. The West Ethylene Pipeline
was initially to transport 1.5 million tonnes for 1,500 km to feed five
planned petrochemical complexes. The

Special Report

Iranian Parliament, however, instructed
the Petroleum Ministry to build five
more complexes in the cities of Andimeshk, Dehdasht, Hamedan, Kermanshah, and Miyandoab as a means to
boost production in the less-developed
parts of the country. The pipeline’s
length, therefore, was extended to
2,163 km and capacity increased to 2.8
million tonnes.
An eleventh plant was added to the
plan in June 2008 with construction of
the pipeline roughly 50% complete at
that time, raising doubts that the balance will be completed on schedule.
Olefin plants in Asalouyeh and the
Bandar Imam special economic petrochemical zone in Mahshahr City will
supply the ethylene; one set for completion in 2010 and the other in 2013.

generation, but the country has expressed its continued commitment to
the project as recently as January 2009.
Nigeria and Russia have held talks
regarding the latter’s involvement in the
project, which both countries appear
to desire. India’s GAIL has also voiced
interest in participating in the project.
South Africa’s New Multi-Products

diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel from an
import terminal in Durban roughly 525
km northwest to the inland Gauteng
region. Transnet Ltd. received the final
environmental impact report for NMPP
in November 2008, with the report
submitted at the same time to the Department of Environmental Affairs and

Wellhead outlet reengineered for high-heat wells

New, nonmetallic valve for highly corrosive processes

The reengineered wellhead outlet
shown on the left promises to operate
safely in higher temperatures typically
generated by the majority of high pressure, high temperature wells.
The unit is used to connect downhole
cable to the surface telemetry system. The
downhole cable terminates in a pressure
bulkhead and then connects to the surface
cable. This ensures that if, for any reason,
the downhole cable is flooded, the integrity of the wellhead is maintained. It is used
in permanent completions where pressure
and temperature must be continuously
monitored.

Centre, Airport Business Park, Exeter, England, UK EX5 2UL.

A nonmetallic valve designed for highly
corrosive processes is on the market.
Constructed of nonmetallic, corrosionresistant materials, the company says
its valves will operate in highly caustic
environments not suitable for metal and
fiberglass. The all-polymer internal construction enables the valves to operate in
harsh chemicals, suiting them for use with
chlorine, ethylene dichloride, and hydrochloric acid.
Polymer valves operate in a similar fashion to their metal and fiberglass
counterparts, the firm notes. Valves protect
low-pressure atmospheric storage tanks
from excessive pressure and-or vacuum
and limit fugitive emissions by preventing
constant tank breathing to atmosphere. The
relief valve is available in vent to atmosphere or pipe-away configurations.

Relief from tax law
complexity would
help US economy
The new Treasury secretary’s tax embarrassment highlights a lever that he and
Congress proﬁtably might pull to repair a
broken economy.
Alas, no one is talking about ﬁxing a
misshapen and abused tax code.
The $42,702 that Timothy Geithner paid
in back income tax and ﬁnes didn’t keep
the former New York Federal Reserve Bank
chief from becoming head of the Treasury

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Department.
Americans, after all, know how difﬁcult
it can be to comply with serpentine tax
laws and raised scant fuss about Geithner.
Most of them over a certain age have made
honest tax mistakes, too, and amiably put
Geithner’s misstep in that benign category.
If someone with his ﬁnancial acumen
can get caught overlooking self-employment taxation for 4 years while employed
by the International Monetary Fund, other
taxpayers who’ve received dunning notices
from the Internal Revenue Service needn’t
feel stupid.
On the other hand, many American taxpayers do routinely cheat, trusting statutory
complexity to obscure their malfeasance
and probably smirking over the Geithner
affair.
Use by lawmakers for the political management of human behavior has made the
tax code scandalously incomprehensible.
The legislative juggernaut marketed as a
stimulus package is just the latest example.
Amid hundreds of billions of dollars’
worth of claims against future prosperity
now barreling toward an economy in crisis
lurk countless tax favors for people who act
in accordance with governmental wishes.
Producers, dispensers, and users of
alternative and renewable forms of energy,
for example, will beneﬁt even more than
they already do from these goodies.
Somehow, the subsidized use of noncompetitive energy is supposed to stimulate the economy. “Green jobs,” and all that.
In fact, the strategy makes as much
sense as further complicating a tax code
too confusing even for someone qualiﬁed
to be Treasury secretary.
A strong step toward economic restoration would be replacement of a corrupt tax
system with something simpler and less
politically vulnerable, such as a ﬂat tax or
consumption tax.
But Geithner will be loath to bestir the
tax snake that bit him. And Congress won’t
surrender its insidious implement of manipulation without a ﬁght.

Crude prices may be bottoming
As February opened, crude prices appeared to be “in the early stages of a bottoming process” amid growing speculation that production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might ﬁnally be catching up to the demand
destruction from the international ﬁnancial crisis.
In New Orleans, analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC said OPEC is “moving
forward diligently” with reductions below its 24.8 million b/d target. The 11 participating OPEC members, aside from Iraq, are expected to produce 23.6 million b/d in the
4 weeks ending Feb. 14, down from 23.7 million b/d in the 4 weeks through Jan. 17.
Furthermore, ﬂattening of the forward price curve as the 12-month strip contango
narrowed to $11/bbl from $27/bbl was seen by Pritchard Capital Partners as “a clear
signal that OPEC production cuts are having an impact on the crude oil market.”
During the last week of January, the March contract for benchmark US light,
sweet crudes ﬂuctuated between $41.44-45.73/bbl before closing at $41.68/bbl Jan.
30 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In the ﬁrst trading session of 2009 on Jan.
2, the March contract closed at $50.21/bbl, while the then front-month February contract was at $46.34/bbl.
At EnVantage Inc., a Houston advisory and energy investment ﬁrm, analysts said,
“It is highly probable that the March WTI contract will follow the same track as the
February contact and go back into the $30/bbl range, but we continue to see WTI
prices trading between $35/bbl as a bottom and $50/bbl as a ceiling.”
North Sea Brent historically has traded at a 3-5% discount to US benchmark West
Texas Intermediate. However, analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James &
Associates Inc. reported, “Since the beginning of 2009, this trend has reversed, with
Brent oil…trading 10% higher than WTI [on Jan. 30]. We believe this is largely driven
by higher than average inventory levels in the US, including at Cushing, Okla., the
hub from which WTI is sold. In addition, the current contango forward strip is exacerbating the situation with a contract for WTI delivery in August 2009 trading at $52.07/
bbl…thereby encouraging storage. We do not expect this differential to narrow materially as long as US inventories remain high.”
The two benchmark crudes were moving “in diverging trends,” with the WTI
contango widening and the Brent contango narrowing, said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland. “But given that the widening of the WTI futures contango is
immediately offset by a rise in [US Gulf market] physical cash differentials,” he said,
“…Brent [is] a better benchmark of the world crude oil supply and demand.”
Natural gas outlook
Although Raymond James analysts refrained from trying to predict winter weather Feb. 2 on Groundhog Day, they said, “We do foresee 6 more months, not weeks,
of deteriorating natural gas prices.”
Pritchard Capital Partners said, “Natural gas prices have declined sharply to
multi-year lows as demand destruction appears to be outpacing any slowdown in
domestic supply growth.” However, with the US land rig count down 28% over the
last 5 months, they expect declining demand and reduced drilling activity to result in
a supply-demand balance by mid-year.
Raymond James analysts expect a 60% drop in the US rig count this year, compared with a 40% prediction just 2 months ago. The bigger reduction will include
a 65% roll-back in the number of rigs drilling for gas and a 50% cut in the number
drilling for oil.
However, they said US production likely will not fall “as fast or as far” as the rig
count.
“Producers will stop drilling their least productive, least economic wells ﬁrst,”
Raymond James analysts observed. “When we account for the highly productive shale wells and consider that horizontally drilled wells (the most productive)
are being dropped from drilling programs at a much slower rate, we ﬁnd that gas
production will probably not fall as fast or as far as the rig count (in percentage
terms).”
Meanwhile, they said, “We do not think a 60% decline in the rig count is priced
into the stocks for North American gas-driven companies. Likewise, we still do not
believe the magnitude of the gas markets supply and demand problem is priced
into US natural gas prices. While we think a late 2009 gas price and stock price rally
may still be in the cards, asset utilization rates and North American service company
earnings should be down year over year in both 2009 and 2010.”

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.
Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil supply.
They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs during periods of lower oil prices, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling
air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions, mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to these challenges, the oil sands and heavy oil industry continues to develop unconventional
resources that are critical to meeting the world’s long-term needs for reliable hydrocarbon supplies.
Continued progress in oil sands and heavy oil producing technologies means progress in ensuring a dependable supply of
petroleum products at a time when traditional recovery methods are strained by additional demand from rapidly developing
industrial nations.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make this
innovation and progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience. Join the Oil & Gas
Journal and our conference attendees in Calgary this summer for the third annual Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies
Conference and Exhibition.

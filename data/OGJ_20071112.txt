We’re Taking Pipeline Inspection in New Directions

Pipeline operators have discovered the value and ability of V-LINE™ Inspection Services
from Baker Hughes PMG to access and assess un-piggable pipelines.

1. Practical: Specially designed high resolution MFL tools inspect non-piggable pipelines
with or without pig traps. V-LINE tools are bi-directional and allow for a single point of
entry into difficult-to-access pipeline segments.

2. Thorough: V-LINE Services offer a full picture of the pipeline’s internal and external
metal loss. Our complete, quantified assessment allows integrity decision-making with
confidence, promotes pipeline safety, and facilitates regulatory compliance.

3. Non-destructive: V-LINE Inspection Services is the lower cost, comprehensive
alternative to hydrostatic testing. Costly environmental issues and integrity-affecting
pressure cycles are eliminated. And your pipeline stays dry!

4. Precise application: Target the inspection where you need it! Critical crossings,
short segment HCAs, transfer lines, lines with non-passable fittings, lines with no traps.

COVER
Safe and environmentally benign disposal of produced water is a
major concern for Petroleum Development Oman (PDO). Started
up in 1999, its reed-bed pilot near Nimr field in Oman treats
about 20,000 bw/d and has demonstrated that reeds can reduce
inorganic and organic contaminant concentration. Planted with
a common reed known to tolerate a wide range of water conditions, the beds have reduced average hydrocarbon concentration by
an average 96%. OGJ’s exclusive special report on health, safety,
and environmental issues in oil and natural gas operations begins
on p. 18 and includes discussions of Shell’s spill-response effort in
its Beaufort Sea work, the first satellite-based estimates of flaring
from industry operations, and a method to improve containment
of pipeline-spread silt. Cover photo by Guntis Moritis. In the
photo above, a large, over-the-side, five-brush system, developed in
Finland, skims 1,290 bbl/hr from the surface (photo from Lamor
Corp. AB).

Kuwaiti oil minister quits after 8-day tenure
Bader Mishari al-Humaidhi, Kuwait’s oil minister, has resigned
after only 8 days in office because opposition members of parliament continuously attacked his suitability for the role.
Kuwait’s state news agency said the cabinet accepted his resignation. His departure is not expected to affect oil policy, which is
set by a supreme council. Humaidhi was given the job following a
cabinet reshuffle, leaving his previous role as finance minister for
the past 2 years.
Several politicians strongly criticized Humaidhi’s appointment
saying they felt he was escaping scrutiny in parliament over allegations of financial and administrative irregularities.
Humaidhi’s predecessor was Sheikh Ali al-Jarrah al-Sabah, who
left the post in June after carrying out the duties for a year. He had
little support, and opponents were about to push forward a noconfidence vote.
Kuwait wants to establish 4 million b/d of oil capacity by 2020,
but this goal is being thwarted by continuous changes in leadership at the oil ministry and domestic political struggles. Presently,
the country produces 2.4 million b/d of oil.

Court backs Anadarko in deepwater lease case
A federal judge in Louisiana has supported Anadarko Petroleum
Corp.’s claim that the US Minerals Management Service lacked
authority to collect royalty on deepwater leases issued in 19962000.
The leases were issued under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act
of 1995, which provides an exclusion from royalty, subject to various limits, for production from leases with specified water depths.
The law made royalty relief automatic for leases issued during
1996-2000 and gave MMS more latitude to change the program
for leases issued after 2000.
To ensure collection of federal royalty during periods of elevated oil and gas prices, MMS imposed price thresholds, above which
royalty relief expires, for deepwater Outer Continental Shelf leases,
including those issued in 1996, 1997, and 2000.
In January 2006, the Department of the Interior, of which MMS
is part, ordered Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Corp., now part of Anadarko, to pay royalty and interest for eight deepwater leases issued in
those 3 years.
Kerr-McGee challenged the agency’s authority to suspend royalty relief because of high oil and gas prices, citing statutory language about the years prior to 2000.
The US District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, Lake
Charles Division, supported the Kerr-McGee-Anadarko claim, saying Interior “exceeded its congressional authority” by requiring Kerr-McGee
to pay royalty based on price threshold in the years under dispute.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Deepwater leases issued during 1998 and 1999 contained no
price thresholds. The omissions have been controversial.
According to press reports, the MMS might appeal the Louisiana ruling, which throws into question royalties collected on all
deepwater leases with price thresholds in the 3 years covered by
the Anadarko case.

Diesel spill in Veracruz sparks threat of Pemex ban
Mexico’s Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) has been warned it may
no longer be allowed to operate in the state of Veracruz following
criticism for its poor response to recent accidents and oil spills.
Veracruz State Governor Fidel Herrera Beltran launched the criticism, saying Pemex’s various accidents this year have caused losses
in the state estimated at 8 billion pesos ($750 million).
His remarks followed a pipeline break on Oct. 30 that sent
420,000 gal of diesel fuel into three rivers in the Gulf Coast state,
threatening the supply of drinking water for some 600,000 people
in the region.
The state’s deputy secretary for civil defense, Ranulfo Marquez,
said water wells and springs had been polluted by the fuel that
spilled late last week into the Coatzacoalcos River and its tributaries, the Jaltepec and the Chiquito.
The rupture occurred Oct. 25 on a subterranean pipeline, but
diesel rose to the surface of a creek feeding into the Jaltepec River
and from there flowed into the Chiquito and the Coatzacoalcos.
Marquez said some 1,200 people were working to clean up the
fuel which, he said, formed a 200 km strip down the three affected
rivers. He also said some of the barriers deployed to contain the
fuel broke and allowed at least 21,000 gal of diesel to flow into
the gulf.
According to a statement by Mexico’s environmental enforcement office, Profepa, the spill was brought under control when Pemex stopped pumping fuel through the pipeline 30 minutes after
the accident occurred.
Pemex later issued a statement saying it had recovered 80% of
the fuel spilled, that the Gulf of Mexico was not contaminated,
and that the fuel slick along the rivers was about 12 km long.
It said the damaged pipeline had been repaired and that it expected to complete work on the environmental damage by Nov.

uled for completion in 2008. Plans call for the plant to produce
more than 100 million gal/year in about 2011.
US Sec. of Energy Samuel W. Bodman and Georgia Gov. Sonny
Perdue attended the groundbreaking. Range Fuels was one of six
companies selected by the US Department of Energy for financial
support in building a commercial cellulosic ethanol plant.
As part of its $76 million technology investment agreement
with DOE, Range Fuels will receive $50 million based upon firstphase construction. The other $26 million will be provided for
construction in the project’s next phase.
Range Fuels uses a two-step, thermochemical conversion process to turn wood chips, municipal waste, paper pulp, olive pits,
and other waste materials into ethanol.

Devon’s Paktoa a giant Beaufort oil ﬁnd
Devon Canada Corp. discovered 240 million bbl of recoverable
oil at the Paktoa C-60 wildcat while exploring for natural gas in the
Canadian Beaufort Sea in 2006, the company has revealed.
The well, the Canadian Beaufort’s first wildcat in 20 years, won
the company a 37,000-acre Significant Discovery License designation from the National Energy Board.
Paktoa C-60 is in EL 411 in 40 ft of water west of Beluga Bay
(see map, OGJ, Nov. 3, 2003, p. 42). Devon’s interest is 100%.
Devon, with more than 1.3 million net acres, is the largest exploratory leaseholder in the Beaufort Sea-Mackenzie Delta. Affiliates of ExxonMobil Corp. made a work bid earlier this year of $585
million for 507,000-acre EL 446 just north of Paktoa, and Chevron
Canada Ltd. bid $1 million in work commitments for 267,000acre EL 448 just west of Paktoa (OGJ Online, July 19, 2007).

Aurelian discovers gas in Romanian well
Aurelian Oil & Gas PLC, London, has discovered gas in thin Sarmatian (Middle to Upper Miocene) sands in its Boistea 1 well on
the Cuejdiu Block in Romania.
Boistea reached a TD of 2,295 m on the eastern part of the block
and encountered the gas in an interval of 1,700-1,800 m.
“After electric logging and a series of pressure measurements,
it has been decided to complete the well to allow a long term flow
test of the interval 1,783-85 m,” Aurelian said.

Mexico’s state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos said it has restored
all but about 300,000 bbl of oil production halted last weekend
when storms hit the Gulf of Mexico.
Pemex had suspended as much as 1.1 million b/d of output on
Oct. 30 after oil completely filled storage tanks at three ports—Dos
Bocas, Cayo Arcas, and Pajaritos—where inclement weather prevented ships from loading.
Dos Bocas and Cayo Arcas have since reopened, allowing ships

This was the first well drilled on the block.
Aurelian plans to drill deeper targets on the western part of the
block following a seismic survey to be shot in 2008.
Partners in the Cuejdiu joint venture are Aurelian 40%, SNGN
Romgaz SA 37.5%, Europa Oil & Gas SRL 17.5%, and Millennium
International Resources Corp., wholly owned by Aurelian, 5%.

Paciﬁc tests gas in Lower Magdalena basin
The La Creciente-3 well in the Lower Magdalena basin tested
gas at extrapolated rates as high as 25 MMcfd and indicated a production potential similar to that measured at the La Creciente-1
discovery well, said Pacific Stratus Energy Ltd., Toronto.
The LCA-3 well, deviated southwest from the discovery well
pad on Prospect A of the La Creciente Block, went to TD 12,950 ft
MD (10,977 ft TVD subsea). The maximum rate was obtained on a
32
⁄64-in. choke with 4,453 psi wellhead flowing pressure.
The company cemented production liner and plans to run a
vertical seismic profile log and a second drillstem test. It will also
compare production results between the two wells.
The Cienaga de Oro reservoir consists of 630 ft (true thickness)
of well-sorted coarse to fine-grain sandstones, of which the upper zone consists of 257 ft of gas-bearing sandstones. The interval
has 219 ft of net reservoir sandstones, 15.5% average porosity, and
27.3% average water saturation.
The rig moved to Prospect D to spud the LCD-1 well 5.5 km
north of the discovery well on Oct. 26. ✦

Production

Pemex resumes production as gulf storms end

The company is privately held and funded by Khosla Ventures LLC.
Mitch Mandich, Range Fuels chief executive officer, said the
company’s process for producing cellulosic ethanol will use 25%
of the average amount of water required by corn-based ethanol
plants.
Grain-based ethanol is produced through fermentation of sugars, distillation, and drying. Corn is low in sugar, but high in carbohydrate cellulose that must be turned into fermentable sugar (OGJ,
Aug. 6, 2007, p. 20).
Researchers are working on methods to more efficiently convert cellulose to sugar. Many chemists see biobutanol as a potential
game changer for biofuels because of its potential to integrate better than ethanol into the refining and gasoline distribution infrastructure. ✦

Pemex director Jesus Reyes Heroles.
Meanwhile, Pemex expected to reopen wells Oct. 31 and resume normal production of about 3.1 million b/d, including 1.7
million b/d for export, according to Pemex E&P Director Carlos
Morales.
A week of heavy rains caused widespread flooding in southeastern Mexico, killing at least one person and forcing tens of thousands to flee rising waters in Tabasco and Chiapas states.
The flooding was thought to have caused a leak in a 10-in. natuOil & Gas Journal / Nov. 12, 2007

Marathon to upgrade, expand Detroit reﬁnery
Marathon Oil Corp. has approved a projected $1.9 billion expansion and heavy oil upgrade project at its 100,000 b/cd refinery
in Detroit.
The project will increase the refinery’s heavy oil processing capacity, including Canadian bitumen blends, by about 80,000 b/d
and will increase its total refining capacity by about 15%, to 115,000
b/d.
When completed in late 2010, the project will add more than
400,000 gpd of clean transportation fuels to the market. Construction is expected to begin in late 2007 or early 2008, subject to
regulatory approvals.
The Detroit heavy oil upgrade project will include a 28,000
b/d delayed coker, a 280 tonne/day sulfur recovery complex, and
a 33,000 b/d distillate hydrotreater.
In addition, an associated pipeline will be built. Construction
on the 29-mile pipeline segment is expected to begin in mid-2009
with completion in 2010.
Marathon completed an expansion at the Detroit refinery in
late 2005 that increased crude capacity to its current capacity from
74,000 b/d (OGJ, Online, Sept. 30, 2005).

Gas plants to aid Utah Natural Buttes growth
Anadarko Petroleum Corp.’s midstream unit plans to start up
around Dec. 1 the 250 MMcfd Chapita gas processing plant west
of Bonanza in giant Natural Buttes gas field in Uintah County in
northeastern Utah.
A lateral under construction will transport liquids that the new
refrigeration plant extracts from the field’s gas to the Mapco natural gas liquids pipeline in western Colorado for shipment to Mont

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
Belvieu, Tex., for fractionation.
Anadarko currently delivers 300 MMcfd from the Uinta basin
into various dew point control facilities and plants operated by
others. Most of this will be diverted to Chapita when the new plant
starts up.
A second 250 MMcfd plant has been ordered. It is in early stages
of fabrication and scheduled for delivery in mid-2008 and start-up
in first quarter 2009. A third train with a capacity of 250 MMcfd
or larger is being considered. The second and third trains will be
cryogenic units.
Processed gas from the Chapita plant will move through the
400 MMcfd Kanda lateral, operated by El Paso Western Pipelines
and owned by Wyoming Interstate Co., to the Colorado Interstate
Gas mainline for transport out of the Rockies, Anadarko said.
Anadarko also is optimizing its Natural Buttes gas gathering system, which consists of 750 miles of pipe with 40 compressors totaling 47,000 hp at 23 sites. More than 1,400 wells are connected,
and more than 200/year are being hooked up.
Anadarko’s 2007 drilling program alone called for the drilling
of 280 development wells in Natural Buttes field, where the company holds 225,000 net acres, has eight operated and three nonoperated rigs running, and has identified nearly 5,000 drillsites.
Drilling exploits Cretaceous Mesaverde zones and explores deeper
potential.
The Natural Buttes gathering system handled 280 MMcfd of
Anadarko gas and 20 MMcfd of third party gas in 2006, and its
expansion will allow Anadarko Midstream to aggressively pursue
adding third party volumes.

CNPC plans to build reﬁnery in Costa Rica

Jurong Aromatics lets contract for Singapore plant

China National Petroleum Corp. plans to build a refinery in Costa Rica to supply Central American markets, according to Chinese
state media.
The official Shanghai Securities News, citing CNPC sources, said
the agreement was concluded during a visit of Costa Rica President
Oscar Arias Sanchez to China.
Before his trip, Arias told Costa Rica’s La Nacion newspaper that
one of the most important goals of his visit would be to reach an
agreement to a refinery.
Arias said the refinery proposal would allow Costa Rica to meet
its own fuel needs and to export products.
The Shanghai Securities News report said the proposed refinery
will process heavy oil from Venezuela.
In August 2006, CNPC agreed with Petroleos de Venezuela SA
to establish a joint venture to develop a block in the Junin area
of the Orinoco heavy oil belt.

Jurong Aromatics Corp. Pte. Ltd. has let a contract to UOP LLC,
Des Plaines, Ill., for the technology and basic engineering services
and equipment for an aromatics plant to be built on Jurong Island
in Singapore.
UOP already is performing basic engineering design, and commissioning of the complex is slated for 2011. When completed,
the plant will be one of the largest privately owned petrochemical
facilities in Singapore.
Plans call for the plant to produce 800,000 tonnes/year of
paraxylene, 200,000 tonnes/year of orthoxylene, and 450,000
tonnes/year of benzene.
The new facility will feature various UOP technologies for removing sulfur and for upgrading distillate materials for the production of clean fuels. ✦

SEIC to boost Sakhalin-2 liquefaction capacity
The annual capacity of the Sakhalin-2 liquefaction plant under construction on Sakhalin Island will be increased by 7 million
tonnes, said a state official Oct. 18.
Regional Gov. Alexander Khoroshavin said the working group
of project operator Sakhalin Energy Investment Co. has begun to
draft a plan for the plant’s third stage.
The plant currently has two units with a total capacity of 9.6
million tonnes/year of LNG. It is due to be commissioned in 2008
after completion of start-up operations now under way.
SEIC said it received a second shipment of LNG for use in testing
and start-up operations at the plant (OGJ Online, Oct. 17, 2007).
Sakhalin-2 is designed to produce LNG at two fields in southern
Sakhalin, and the bulk of the LNG has been purchased in advance
by US, Japanese, and South Korean companies.
Russia’s OAO Gazprom bought a 50% stake plus one share in
the project for $7.45 billion in late 2006, leaving Royal Dutch Shell
PLC, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi respective stakes of 27.5%, 12.5%, and
10% in the project.

BG Group to submit EIA for Brindisi terminal
BG Group PLC will prepare an environmental impact assessment for its proposed Brindisi regasification terminal to meet the
Italian government’s new requirements.
Earlier this month the government suspended its decree allowing BG to construct the $720.6 million terminal until the EIA was
completed. BG said it was committed to developing the 8 billion cu
m/year Brindisi terminal and the authorization given in 2003 was
full and valid and did not require an EIA at the time. BG described
its change in stance as “a gesture of good faith.” It has already invested €200 million in the project.
BG said it was committed to completing the project. “We have
reached our decision quickly and have already begun work on the
EIA,” the company said.
The terminal is expected to begin operating by 2010.

China to start second phase of West-East pipeline Spectra to build Bronco gas pipeline from Rockies
China is likely to start the second phase of the West-East natural
gas pipeline project around yearend or early 2008, according to a
senior government official.
Chen Deming, vice-chairman of the State Development and
Reform Commission, said gas from Xinjiang, the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region and Shaanxi Province will be transported to
the Pearl River Delta through the country’s pipeline network after
completion of the West-East project.
Chen said more than 12 billion cu m of gas will be supplied to
the Yangtze River Delta in 2 years’ time, due to increased imports
of gas and large-scale gas exploitation in Chongqing Municipality
and Sichuan Province.
By then, he said, the urban gas and transportation systems in
half the regions of China will gradually have access to clean gas.
Over the last 4 years, China has seen a 62% increase in the

Spectra Energy is proposing to build a 650-mile natural gas
pipeline to connect Rocky Mountain natural gas supplies to Western US markets.
The proposed Bronco Pipeline, with estimated construction
costs exceeding $3 billion, will have an initial capacity of more
than 1 bcfd.
The pipeline will access existing and growing supply basins in
Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado and extend westward, interconnecting with several pipelines en route to its terminus near Malin, Ore.
Based on preliminary market need and assessments, the project
is currently planned to be in-service as early as 2011, with completion in 2012.
Spectra said it will hold an open season in the next 3 months
to determine final project parameters including route, market, and
timing. ✦

A money game
Eighty-five dollar crude oil is obscene! The traders on the New York
Mercantile Exchange are gambling with
the economic health of the US and the
world.
Crude oil production worldwide is
in balance with refining capacity. The
Saudis expressed their belief a couple of
years ago that the price of crude should
be in a range of $28-34/bbl.
When the Department of Energy
announces on Wednesday each week
inventory at refineries the traders react
immediately. Recently, inventories fell
by 3.5 million bbl. The market rose
to $80/bbl. This is actually a modest
amount of crude, about the cargo of two
large tankers.
What can the government do in this
emergency? We hold approximately 700
million bbl of crude in storage for emergencies. This is an emergency!
When the weekly crude in refining
storage falls by say 3.5 million bbl the
DOE should release this amount from
storage to refiners, keeping the balance
at refineries even. This should cool off
the enthusiasm of the traders who are
making profits and costing the American
public unduly.
Most of the traders formerly dealt in
pork bellies or soybeans with little or
no knowledge of the oil industry. With
them it’s a money game.

Wildcats making a comeback
Bob Tippee
Editor
You don’t encounter “wildcat” much
anymore.
The word appears hardly at all in reports
from oil and gas companies, especially the
small producers that once loved it.
And “rank wildcat”? Forget about it.
Producers still have to explore for oil
and gas, of course. But when they drill
wells out where the wildcats prowl they
call the holes they make “exploratory
wells.”
So an activity that the oil and gas
industry once enshrined with jargon it
now hides behind euphemism.
The reason for this retreat from
decoration is, of course, risk. Everyone knows exploration is risky. It also
requires money in large amounts.
Big companies supply their own
drilling capital. Small and mediumsize companies, however, must raise
capital from outsiders, many of whom
find delicious comfort in an aphorism
popular since, oh, the oil-price collapse
of 1986: The best place to find oil is in
an oil field. Investors entranced by this
view treat self-proclaimed wildcatters as
reckless throwbacks.

Financial metrics
On balance, the industry is surely
better for this change. It’s oriented
more than before to essential financial
metrics calibrated to risk and less to
finding hydrocarbons every fifth hole
or so. Alas, the financial metrics have for
many years drawn capital toward acquisitions and development plays at some
expense to exploration.
The money migration has solidified

the upstream petroleum business financially but deprived it of a certain zest.
Without its wildcats and wildcatters,
the oil and gas industry lacks something, like a barbeque platter without
jalepeno peppers.
Spice, though, might be returning to
the menu.
At least one investment analyst sees
exploration as—gasp!—emergent opportunity for small producers and their
investors.
Edison Investment Research, London,
even uses the word “wildcat” in an October report calling exploration “where
the upside is today.”
Especially in the late 1990s, the firm
says, success for small independent
producers “was built on acquiring
small-sized, low-risk assets in mature
areas (generally from majors seeking
larger discoveries in frontier regions),
developing those assets efficiently, and
subsequently benefiting from the increasing oil price.”
Uncertain oil prices in that period
justified low asset valuations at high
discount rates. Investors could buy
producing assets and hope for growth
without incurring disproportionate risk.
Rising oil prices have especially rewarded production-oriented investments in
the past 3 years.
But Edison Investment doubts oil
prices will rise much more.
“The current stable, high-oil-price
environment has made this [production-focused] model difficult to
emulate,” it says. “Furthermore, the
current environment warrants a change
in strategy towards companies which
instead focus on organic growth via
capital-efficient, well-informed, highreward exploration.”
The firm identifies three types of
plays able to generate “material returns”
in a price regime it sees as dulling the
allure of production investments.
One is niche plays, such as heavy oil

and revitalization of abandoned fields—
relatively low-risk ventures on which
companies can profit from special
expertise. There’s not much exploratory
romance here, but Edison Research sees
these ventures as something beyond
what it calls “pure vanilla E&P plays.”
The firm’s second appealing play is
“high-impact, wildcat frontier exploration.” Now they’re talking. This area,
Edison Research says, “is where we
believe the greatest potential for value
creation and high returns exists.”
The third play on Edison Research’s
list encompasses high-impact opportunities in mature areas, the type of strategy that yielded EnCana Corp.’s 2001
discovery of 500 million boe Buzzard
oil and gas field now on production in
the UK North Sea.
The firm favors the “upside” provided by exploration in contrast to the producing and development investments
that probably have reached peak value.
“We instead believe that a high oil
price environment and the associated
potential for high reward have created the
ideal environment for investment in high
risk-high reward exploration,” it says.
Edison Research likes producers that
not only orient themselves to exploration but that also understand the subsurface, use capital efficiently, balance risk
and reward, and focus on drilling.

Managing risk
In Edison Research’s view, then, successful producers not only take but also
manage risk. They do so by employing
skillful geoscientists and engineers,
working through partnerships, keeping
exposure to the cost of failure below
rewards available from success, and
staying busy.
Edison Research calls all this “derisking.” Some might call it sensible caution,
a trait common to wildcatters who’ve
been in business long enough to reminisce about the good old days. ✦

The curse of $95 oil
For reasons that will prove to have been fleeting, the price of crude oil exceeds $95/bbl at
this writing and is flirting with the $100/bbl
landmark. While market fundamentals account
for some of the buoyancy, they don’t explain the
seeming imminence of a triple-digit crude price.
Neither will they explain a possibly sudden price
correction about which there can be only one
question: When?
For the oil and gas industry, the self-levitating
crude price is regrettable, as refiners already know.
Producers will regret it when they discover how
quickly extraordinary revenue can vanish but how
slowly, by comparison, swollen cost structures
react. If commercial costs, such as those of oil field
services and supplies, were all that had risen lately,
the problem would be manageable. Political costs
are another, troubling matter.

Unusual pressures
The potential for a price slump rests on two
unusual price pressures. One is historic weakness
of the US dollar. Some analysts say the puny dollar
accounts for $12-15/bbl of the crude price; some
say more. The price influence, whatever its measure, is amplified to some controversial degree by
the increased activity of nonphysical traders, some
of whom apparently see oil as a haven for money
fleeing turmoil in credit markets.
Market experts disagree over the net effects of
all this. What’s important for oil and gas companies is the work of unusual upward forces on the
price of crude—forces that will subside at some
point, perhaps suddenly, in response to changes
in markets related only indirectly to petroleum.
This is a prediction not of a price crash but rather
of a possibly quick correction when—not if—the
dollar recovers and credit markets stabilize. With
demand still growing, albeit at a diminishing rate,
and some inventories unseasonably low, oil won’t
shed all its dollar-denominated value anytime
soon—just, probably, some of it. The important
question for oil and gas companies is by how
much costs—commercial and political—will rise
in the meantime.
Predictably, the commercial costs of oil and gas
operations are rising as activity stimulated by rising

commodity prices intensifies competition for services, supplies, and equipment. Just as predictably,
governments are increasing their claims on wealth
generated by oil and gas production under their
jurisdictions. Government money grabs have been
as brazen as the asset expropriations of Russia and
Venezuela and as benign, by comparison, as royalty
increases by Alberta and the US Minerals Management Service. They haven’t run their course. Legislation in a US Congress embittered by high oil prices
and related profits would pummel oil companies
with taxes to fund government programs.
Governments raising royalties, taxes, or production shares always point to elevated oil prices and
insist oil companies can carry a greater load. But
load-carrying capacity depends not on prices but
on profits, which inevitably are eroding now as
competition raises operating costs. Cash-hungry
governments notice only the profit gains that immediately follow a spike in the crude price, never
the shrinking margins that follow as costs catch
up.
Oil and gas companies are by no means suffering hardship. Because costs are rising for both
competitive and political reasons, however, they
must confront an imminent crude-price downturn
with newly lifted thresholds of financial distress.
Just as cost bases shrunken by many years of
frugality leveraged profit jumps when oil prices
finally recovered, swelling costs of the present will
produce losses for some projects and some companies at oil prices that not long ago seemed high.

Uneven adjustments
The commercial dimension of the industry’s
new cost base will adjust to the coming price
correction as it always does, perhaps faster than
anyone expects. Adjustment of the political dimension will require much more time. Governments
don’t lower taxes and otherwise improve terms
of participation for operators in anticipation of
diminished activity; they wait until torpor makes
the need for fiscal relief painfully evident.
Crude prices above $95/bbl are destined not to
last. Political costs that rise with oil prices, however, will sully the industry’s fiscal landscape for
many years. ✦

Environmental stewardship and
employee safety ranked high among
issues major oil companies addressed in
the lengthy, nonfinancial disclosures for
2006 that some companies call sustainability reports and others, corporate
social responsibility reports.
Companies issue these reports in
response to demand for information on
corporate governance and risk-mitigation. Content
varies considerably between
companies and
also between
countries
(OGJ, Oct. 1,
2007, p. 20).
Nonfinancial reporting across much
of the world lacks the hard rules that
governments typically provide for
financial reports. Oil companies hire
outside auditing firms to provide assurance on the information.

and the American Petroleum Institute

The following summaries show the
variety of information major oil companies are reporting.

BP notes difﬁculties

John Brown, BP PLC chief executive
until May 1, 2007, wrote an introduction to the 2006 report in which he
said, “The past 2 years have been difficult for BP.”
He referred to the March 2005 blast
at the Texas City, Tex., refinery as well as
oil spills and pipeline corrosion problems in Prudhoe Bay, Alas.
“This year, BP’s performance on key
sustainability issues related to our operations has been under intense scrutiny
from governments, investors, civil society, and the media,” the report said.
During 2006, BP created two senior
management subcommittees: the group
operations risk committee and the
group financial risk committee. The
company also conducted a series of
“town hall” meetings throughout BP to
discuss its management framework.
“There is no sense of complacency
in BP,” Brown said. “The tragic events
of Texas City reminded us all of the
physical danger associated with the

and Environment
The company plans to invest an average of $1.7 billion/year on integrity
and reliability across its five US refineries during 2007-10, compared with
$1.2 billion in 2005.
In Alaska, BP committed to invest
more than $550 million on integrity

safeguards that chairman Henry A.
Waxman (D-Calif.) characterized as
loopholes.
“As children, we all learned about
basic fairness. We know that it’s not fair
when someone gets to play by different
rules than the rest of us. But as we will
learn today, there is one set of environmental rules for the oil and gas industry
and a different set of rules for the rest
of America,” he said in his opening
statement.
Specifically, said Waxman, the Safe
Drinking Water Act makes it illegal
to inject toxic chemicals into underground aquifers and the Clean Water
Act requires companies and individual
homeowners to control erosion while a
property is under construction. Neither
provision applies to oil and gas producers, he said.
“Even the Clean Air Act dropped a
key pollutant emitted by oil and gas
operations from the list of regulated,
hazardous air pollutants, though it did
give [the US Environmental Protection
Agency] authority to add the chemical
to the list,” Waxman said.

Theo Colburn, president of The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX) in
Paonia, Colo., said, “It is impossible to
provide quantitative information about
what is being used at any stage of developing natural gas because much of this
information is proprietary. For example,
in what quantities and mixtures are
the products being used? How much
water or other fluids are used to attain
the million gallons needed to fracture a
well?”
Asked by committee member
Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) if water
pollution is the single biggest problem,
Colburn replied, “Air emissions are
contributing too, particularly volatile
organic compounds released during
well operations.”
Amy Mall, a senior policy analyst at
the Natural Resources Defense Council,
said, “Decades of deal-making by the
industry, Congress, and regulatory offices have resulted in exemptions for the
oil and gas industry” from protections

“Make no mistake: We in the US
are the best-regulated oil and natural
gas regime in the world,” said David E.
Bolin, deputy director of Alabama’s state
oil and gas board, who testified on behalf of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. “No other country
operates under stricter environmental,
health, and safety regulatory oversight.
Elimination of Sections 327 and 382 of
EPACT would not make production of
oil and gas in the US one iota safer but
could substantially increase domestic oil
and gas production costs and thereby
decrease domestic supply.”
Asked by committee member Chris
Cannon (R-Utah) if coalbed methane
(CBM) operations, which are shallow
relative to other oil and gas activities, are likelier to jeopardize drinking
water supplies, Bolin replied, “Typically, drinking water wells are 50-100 ft
deep. We work to make sure hydraulic
fracturing fluids don’t make their way
to shallower levels.”
Benjamin H. Grumbles, assistant
administrator for water at EPA, said the
agency uses every tool available to do its
job. EPA also recognizes that environmental protection strategies must evolve
as characteristics of US industries and
their operations change, and it works
with regulated entities to improve
performance by addressing specific industries’ unique issues and challenges,

everal people in Washington, DC,
believe the oil and gas industry
should pay more taxes and royalties.
In one case, however, the industry
may have trouble simply giving its
money away.
As first reported Nov. 3 in the
Washington Post, two regents at the
Smithsonian Institution have questioned whether it would be appropriate for the national museum to accept
$5 million the American Petroleum
Institute has offered to become a
major underwriter of the Ocean
Initiative.
The program would include a $49
million Ocean Hall in the Museum
of American History and a web site
devoted to marine research.
Roger W. Sant, a cofounder of AES
Corp. and a former chairman of the
World Wildlife Fund, raised the point
at a Sept. 17 regents meeting and was
joined by another regent, US Sen. Patrick J. Leahey (D-Vt.). They objected
to the donation and requested more
information, which was delivered in
time for a conference call on Oct. 15.
At that time, the Post article continued, US Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts, who also is the
Smithsonian’s chancellor and presides
at regents meetings, requested a motion on the donation. When he did
not receive one, the matter was tabled
until the next meeting on Nov. 19.

self from the Nov. 19 regents’ vote.
“The oil and natural gas industry
has unparalleled experience working in the world’s oceans, and we
are looking forward to becoming
a partner with the Smithsonian in
this worthwhile project. The gift is
offered in the spirit of encouraging
education,” API spokeswoman Karen
Matusik said.
There’s at least one irony in all
this. AES, Sant’s former company, has
constructed several major electric
power projects overseas but currently
faces opposition to LNG terminals it
wants to build near Baltimore and in
New England. It’s also a member of
API.

Active in projects

Sant, online sources show, has
been interested in the ocean environment for some time. The Summit
Foundation, which he founded in
1991 and continues to chair, works
in reef preservation and other projects.
The Post article indicated that
while he thinks oil and gas industry
support may not be appropriate in
this case, it would be worthwhile in
other Smithsonian programs. It also
suggested that his concern may arise
more from oil tanker spills than from
offshore exploration and production.
Coincidentally, 2 weeks after the
Smithsonian regents delayed their

certain if it’s complete. “Based on information from this hearing, we’re going
to coordinate with state drinking water
councils, the IOGCC, and others to get
more information about components
besides BTEX [benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene] which could pose
health problems in drinking water,”
Grumbles said.

Categorical exclusions
Robert Anderson, deputy assistant
director for minerals, royalty, and
resource protection at the US Bureau
of Land Management, said categorical exclusions authorized under EPACT
have let the Department of the Interior
agency’s employees spend more time
inspecting operations and processing
drilling permit applications.
But Waxman complained that DOI
has not complied with an EPACT provision requiring a study of CBM production impacts on surface and ground
water in certain western states. “The
statutorily mandated study is now 14
months late and has not yet been started. Moreover, documents the Oversight
Committee has obtained from the BLM
indicate that . . . BLM is planning to ask
the National Academy [of Sciences] to
conduct a public meeting, not a study
as required by law,” he said in an Oct.
31 letter to US Interior Secretary Dirk A.
Kempthorne.
When the committee chairman
asked Anderson about it, the BLM official said the meeting next spring with
EPA and NAS will attempt to determine
if earlier studies produced information
that can be used. “There were 11 other
sections of EPACT that directed us to do
studies. None was funded by Congress,”
he pointed out.
“Congress passed a law requiring
this study. If you didn’t have funds, why
didn’t you ask us for them?” Waxman
said.
Some Republicans on the committee questioned the motives behind this
hearing and one scheduled next week

it appears pretty clearly that those on
the other side already have their minds
made up,” said ranking minority member Thomas M. Davis III (R-Va.) in his
opening statement.
Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Calif.) said
that while EPACT made minor changes
in federal environmental laws, “for the
most part, we are talking about prac-

tices that have been around and codified for decades. What the oil and gas
industry does not need is a congressional signal that the rules will be changed
retroactively.”
Davis suggested that a sensible energy policy should focus on both securing additional sources of domestically

produced energy and reducing carbon
emissions, while ensuring that environmental protection regulations are
sensible, complete, and enforceable.
“What we can’t do now is take
potential sources off the table. I worry
that this is the subtext of this hearing. I
worry again about poking small holes
in the bottom of the boat,” he said. ✦

Bingaman says energy bill needs more time
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) said he does not expect
to see a reworked 2007 federal energy
bill to appear before the Senate takes its
Thanksgiving recess in 2 weeks.
Bingaman said US House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate
Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.)
would make the final decision on bringing the bill back before Congress. “But
given the amount of time and competition from other issues, I don’t think it
looks likely,” he told reporters at a Nov.
5 breakfast briefing sponsored by Energy
Daily and the American Gas Association.
Committee chairs and majority staff
members have been meeting for weeks
to reconcile differences between energy
bills passed by the House and Senate
earlier this year. Bingaman said the
staffs have made progress in resolving
questions involving the bills’ energy efficiency and public lands provisions.
Resolution of tax questions is less
clear, but the Senate Finance and House
Ways and Means committees’ staffs
are working hard, he indicated. “The
House’s tax package was substantially
smaller than the Senate Finance Committee’s. I think both staffs are looking
at all possible offsets but haven’t settled
on which will be in the final bill,” Bingaman said.
He rejected the idea advanced by Republicans and some trade associations
that 2007 federal energy legislation will
28

have no provisions designed to increase
domestic production. “Most of those
charges have no basis in fact. There are
incentives to produce more biofuels. I
think most of this criticism is directed
toward provisions in the House bill. I
don’t think they’d have much impact,”
he said.
He also said he thinks enough
congressional Republicans will support
the reworked energy bill for it to pass
despite Senate Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell (R-Ky.) voting against the
earlier Senate bill. Bingaman said he
does not see President George W. Bush’s
veto threats as much of an obstacle but
added, “I don’t think there’s been a lot
of forward-leaning by the administration to get Republican members to
support energy legislation.”

Congressional Democrats also are
waiting to see how the Bush administration responds to last week’s federal
appeals court decision in Kerr-McGee’s
challenge of efforts to collect additional
deepwater royalties (OGJ Online, Nov.
1, 2007).
“It’s a case of a company asserting
its legal rights. But I think the government needs to get a reasonable return
on public resources. Some of the actions
we’ve seen by the administration suggest that it believes companies haven’t
been paying their fair share. I was
particularly encouraged last week when
the [US Minerals Management Service]
announced it will collect 18.75% in
royalties from new production in the
Gulf of Mexico,” Bingaman said (OGJ,

expected to rise by 6%/year until 2030. He told OGJ
that coal’s use in fuelling power plants was largely
responsible for its rise in the energy mix, and that not
all power plants being built are using technologies that
increase efficiency and reduce emissions. Domestic
incentives are needed to encourage developers to use
noncoal solutions that are more expensive, he added.
Birol said coal use is also growing in the US and
Europe because of high gas prices, which are linked to
oil prices.

All energy use rising
Total energy use will increase by 55% by 2030, led
by China, if alternative methods are not implemented.
In IEA’s reference scenario, oil will continue to be
the biggest fossil fuel in the primary energy mix, with
demand reaching 116 million b/d in 2030—a 32%
increase over 2006. Its share in demand, however, is expected to drop to 32% from 35%. Natural gas demand,
in contrast, will rise to 22% from 21% globally.
China and India are phasing out fuel subsidies, which
should dampen oil demand. The two countries spend
£15 billion on subsidies for oil products. “It will take
time to remove them,” said IEA Deputy Executive Director William Ramsey. He said the governments are aware
of the need to remove subsidies to ease the burden
on governmental budgets and to stimulate efficiency.
Ramsey said IEA would discuss with the governments
their schedules for reducing the subsidies.
Current energy policies of various governments are
not sustainable because oil and gas imports are set to
rise relentlessly to 2030, if not even faster than anticipated in the last WEO, IEA warned.

Oil production
The Middle East and Russia will dominate oil production, according to the WEO. But timely investment
is needed to guarantee that supplies come to market,
particularly if the world is to avoid a supply crunch by
2015, Birol emphasized. Investment needed for basic
energy facilities would need to increase to $22 trillion,
he said, because of cost inflation.
“We are not running out of energy or money, but
time,” Birol said. “It is the next 10 years that are very
important because of the implications this has for climate change.”
OPEC’s role as an oil supplier is critical, the report
emphasized, as its share of production is expected to
rise to 52% by 2030 from 42% today. Non-OPEC production rises only slowly to 2030, says the report, with
most of the increase coming from nonconventional
sources—primarily Canadian oil sands—as conventional
output levels off around 47 million b/d by mid-2010.

on offsetting declines from the fields,
Birol said.
“Although production capacity
at new fields is expected to increase
over the next 5 years, it is uncertain
whether it will be sufficient to compensate for the decline in output at
existing fields and meet the projected
increase in demand,” IEA stressed. “A

In its reference scenario, China and
India alone will have net oil imports

John Waterlow, principal analyst for

the consultancy does not expect oil
prices to hit $100/bbl because there
is too much speculation around the
factors underpinning that price. “The
supply and demand fundamentals don’t
show that,” he said.
According to Waterlow, global
demand has been resilient to high oil
prices for a number of reasons. One is
that developing economies have subsidized oil prices. Where governments
have reduced support and populations
have been exposed to market prices, oil
demand growth has slowed.
“In developed economies, companies can change to other fuels in power
plants when the prices become too
high,” he said. ✦

Keeping a grip
on Sudan’s oil

F

or the oil industry, the news
from Sudan is anything but
good. Indeed, while using the Darfur problem to keep his grip on the
country’s oil-rich south, Sudanese
President Omar al-Bashir blames
the US, the UK, and France for his
problems.
“What we suffer here and in Darfur in particular and the problems in
Sudan in general are caused by these
three powers: Britain, France, and
the United States,” al-Bashir said in
an interview with Britain’s Guardian
newspaper.
That’s more than a bit ironic since
the US Department of Justice at the
moment is applying Bush administration pressure on Congress to reject
legislation designed to slash US and
foreign investment in Sudan due to
the Darfur violence.
The law would punish US or
foreign entities for investing in Sudan
as long as militias aligned with alBashir’s government wage a terror
campaign in the Darfur region.

to the bill because it wants to ensure
that state and local governments
do not engage in divestment activity that, “however well-intentioned,
would jeopardize United States foreign policy on Sudan and potentially
other issues.”
People who want the law to be
passed point to the promises made
to southern Sudan which have yet to
be kept.
An example of that took place last
week, when a senior government of-

34

ficial said the Sudanese army has until
Dec. 15 to pull out from the oil-rich,
semiautonomous south after failing
to meet an initial July deadline.
According to some reports, the
new deadline came amid a crisis
sparked by the withdrawal of the
Sudan People’s Liberation Movement
from the unity government after it
accused al-Bashir’s government of
failing to implement a 2005 peace
deal.

Grip on oil
Sudan’s Ceasefire Political Committee, charged with overseeing the
pullout of troops under the 2005
agreement, last week gave the Sudanese army up to Dec. 15 to withdraw
from the southern region.
“And the [Southern People’s Liberation Army] has the same deadline
to redeploy from southern Kordofan,” said Major General Elias Waya, a
top SPLA commander in the committee.
Although the peace deal directed
both sides to redeploy from the
other’s territories, the Sudanese
army—citing fears of insecurity
posed by the Darfur conflict—has
vowed to remain in the oil fields.
That’s a wonderfully convenient
solution for the Khartoum regime,
especially when al-Bashir can also
blame the US, UK, and France for the
insecurity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, negotiations between
the Sudanese government and the
Darfur rebels have been postponed
until December—a convenient date
that coincides with the government’s
plan to hold on to the south’s oil.
Qui bono? Al-Bashir & Co., that’s
who. ✦

Producers urged to
double oil recovery
efﬁciency worldwide
Producers should seek to double oil
recovery efficiency worldwide and pursue the target through effective use of
technology and wise management, says
a former head of reservoir management
at Saudi Aramco.
Global cumulative production is 1
trillion bbl from a conventional resource
of 7-8 trillion bbl, noted Nansen Saleri,
now president and chief executive officer of Quantum Reservoir Impact. With
unconventional hydrocarbons, the total
resource is 14-17 trillion bbl.
“We have a lot more trillions to go,”
Nansen told the RMI Oilfield Breakfast
Forum in Houston Nov. 1
Saleri used experience with Saudi
Arabia’s Ghawar oil field, the world’s
largest, to show how technology improves reservoir performance.
In the field’s southern area, called
Haradh, Aramco raised production
in three increments starting in 1996.
The first step involved vertical wells;
the second, starting in 2003, involved
horizontal wells; and the third, starting
in 2006 involved maximum reservoir
contact wells, smart, completions, and
instrumentation.
The advance of technology, Saleri
said, yielded a five-fold increase in
added production between the first and
third increments.
In addition, real-time pressure monitoring helped Aramco keep several wells
from prematurely watering out. Haradh
production is 900,000 b/d.
Worldwide, Saleri said, recovery efficiency is 30-35% but could be 60-75%.
“That’s where the challenges lie,” he
said.
Saleri questioned the oil industry
assumption that production from oil
fields inevitably rises to a peak then
declines irreversibly.
“There’s no reason we can’t extend
the period of robustness for a long

He stressed the importance of understanding reservoir fundamentals, verifying

He said international and national

In other presentations at the forum:
• G. Allen Brooks, managing director
of the energy investment banker Parks

Paton Hoepfl & Brown, cited global
warming and peaking oil production
as two new variables that oil industry planners should consider in their
forecasts.
• Tim Probert, senior vice-president
of drilling and evaluation for Halliburton, presented a list of top technology
challenges: reduced uncertainty in
smaller, more complex hydrocarbon accumulations; well placement, drainage,
and control to improve recovery fac-

tors; making unconventional resources
conventional; reliable access to deeply
buried reservoirs; and competitive efficiency models.
• David Holt, executive director of
the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group
formed last year to encourage development of all US energy sources, said,
“The general tenor in Washington is not

Former US senator sees drawbacks in royalty measure
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
A former US senator who helped formulate federal deepwater leasing incentives in the early 1990s warned that imposing price thresholds now on 1998-99
Gulf of Mexico leases could create major
legal problems, delay further leasing, and
encourage other countries to break agreements with US producers.
“I hope that Congress will not adopt
punitive legislation and thus put existing production at risk, put US investment
abroad at risk, or create huge liabilities
from the government’s contract breach
and taking of property without just compensation,” said John B. Breaux in a Nov.
6 letter to current Senate Energy Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.)
and Ranking Minority Member Charles
E. Grassley (R-Iowa) on behalf of the Ad
Hoc Deep Water Exploration and Production Coalition.
Breaux, who became senior counsel in
Patton Boggs LLP’s Washington office in
2005 after three Senate terms as a Democrat from Louisiana, noted that a federal
district court confirmed last week in
Kerr-McGee Corp.’s lawsuit that for federal
deepwater leases issued during 19962000, “companies finding commercial
quantities of oil or gas could produce up
to a specified volume free of royalties.”
The court also ruled that Congress did
not authorize the US Department of the
Interior to make prices remaining below
36

“An adverse ruling could subject the
government to injunctive and declaratory relief, and billions of compensatory
damages. Given the court’s decision for
summary judgment in the Kerr-McGee
litigation, Congress should know that a
lawsuit is likely,” he said.
Punitive royalty recovery legislation
also could halt new leasing activity until
legal challenges are resolved, he continued. “Injunctive relief could block all
further leasing in the Gulf until the constitutional issues are resolved. Cessation of
leasing and the loss of future revenues is
not in our national interest now,” he said.
Range of consequences
Finally, Breaux said, enactment of such

explicit price thresholds for existing leases
a condition for royalty relief, he added.
Producers paid about $1.5 billion
in premiums as bonus bids for the
1998-99 deepwater leases because they
did not have price thresholds, according to Breaux. “In addition, companies
buying leases in the open market paid
substantially more to acquire them from
third parties,” he said in his letter. “The
industry has since invested tens of billions
of dollars in exploration and production
efforts based on economic models relying
on the availability of royalty relief.”

matters worse, Minority Whip Roy
Blunt (R-Mo.) said a day earlier.
“For the nearly 7 years of the Bush
administration, the rising cost of gas
and home heating oil has been a major
economic stress on millions of American families. The response from President Bush has been to promote new
benefits and tax breaks for an industry
already enjoying record profits. The

American people, not the oil industry,
need help from their government,”
Pelosi said.
Democrats are negotiating final
details in energy legislation to invest in
domestic biofuels to strengthen national
security, lower energy prices, create
jobs, promote energy efficiency, and
reduce the global warming threat, she
maintained. “We will vote soon to pass

this bill and send it to the president for
his signature,” she said.
Blunt said Americans want a bill that
makes use of already available resources
and technology to deliver affordable
energy. “That means unlocking new
supplies, encouraging conservation, and
promoting the research and innovation
we’ll need to adapt to the future,” he
said.
Instead, he continued, Democrats are
writing a bill in secret that could restrict
access to domestic supplies further
and impose more taxes on production,
which effectively would raise prices and
increase dependence on imports.
“For every 25¢ increase in the
price of gasoline, it’s estimated that
$100 million a day is taken out of our
economy. If you’re counting at home,
gas has gone up more than 70¢ since
Democrats took control in January.
And if they’re successful in passing
their no-energy bill this winter, it’ll go
up a whole lot more than that,” Blunt
said. ✦

Within a broad context, the applicability of the assortment of improved
oil recovery and enhanced oil recovery
technologies depends by and large on
two factors: the API gravity of the oils
and the depth of the reservoirs.
This second of two parts summarizes
the reserves classifications and discusses
EOR’s potential production growth.
In reality, the proper technical selection parameters are the oil viscosity and
the reservoir pressure. These, however,
are related empirically to oil gravity and
reservoir depth, respectively.
World oil reserves were sorted by
API gravity and depth. The gravity classifications are: light (>35°), medium
(26-35°), heavy (10°-<26°) and extraheavy (≤10°). The upper tiers for heavy
and medium gravity oils were changed
slightly from the official definitions to
better reflect limits of successful field
EOR projects.
The same is true for the depth classifications selected: shallow (<3,500
ft), intermediate (3,500-10,000 ft),
and deep (>10,000 ft). Tables 3 and
4 summarize the results of both sorts.
These groupings provide a convenient core for classifying the coupled
resource base.

gravity oils make up two thirds of the

overview of the general characteristics
of these field projects: number of projects by type, minimum and maximum

A 1% increase in global recovery
efficiency would bring forth 88 billion bbl of expanded conventional oil

The contribution of unconventional
resources is not included because these

countries that have strong NOCs and-or
policies with restrictive access to IOCs
which have some of the best EOR technologies.
Offshore, with a resource base of 2.7
trillion bbl, has its own complexities
that make difficult the application of
EOR techniques. Reservoirs can be deep
(wellbores as long as 40,000 ft), drilling infill wells is costly, and the number
of wells per platform is usually fixed. In
other words, EOR should be incorporated early in the master plan of offshore
fields for maximum results.
EOR’s role is primarily one of realizing the last technically extractable drop
of oil from the reservoir while extending the economic life of the abundant
mature oil fields. Its contribution will
be crucial for the continued expansion
of world oil production. EOR is quite
a challenge, both technologically and
economically, but it is worth pursuing. ✦

Designing contingency
measures for potential
accidents is particularly
important in remote environments.
Drilling
This article discusses
Shell’s oil spill response
planning for exploration in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, focusing on how the
company will protect the Arctic environment. With carefully planned operations,
properly equipped vessels, redundant
equipment sets, and numerous other
safeguards, Shell is prepared to handle any
potential spill.
More than 140 wells have been drilled
in the Canadian and US Beaufort and
Chukchi Seas, with no well blow-outs.
The US incident command system (ICS)
for emergency management organizes
spill plans according to a tiered response
system, progressing from Tier 1 (small,
locally significant), Tier 2 (medium,
regionally significant), to Tier 3 (large,
nationally significant). This article focuses
on strategies that can quickly remove
large volumes of oil if ice precludes an
effective Tier 3 worst-case discharge
response based solely on mechanical
recovery systems.
The scope of this discussion includes
technical, planning, and operational
considerations for implementing specific
offshore recovery and removal strategies in which ice dictates the appropriate
choice of spill-response tactics.
Many important response topics are
more fully described in Shell’s regional
exploration oil-discharge prevention and
contingency plan, submitted to the US
Dept. of Energy’s Minerals Management
Service in January 2007. That document
includes details of community and agency
notification, environmental impact assessment, wildlife rescue and rehabilitation,
shoreline protection, communications,
reporting, and spill-management systems.
Shell’s offshore drilling program involves two floating drilling systems (OGJ,
Oct. 1, 2007, p. 40) supported by nine
vessels (including four polar icebreakers).
The support vessels carry fuel and supplies, transport personnel and equipment,

ment, and oil spill response services,
including the ability to store recovered
products.
The plans include offshore activities
over 4 months, July-October, in water
about 100 ft deep, about 15 miles offshore
(Fig. 1). The drilling program is planned
to begin after the nearshore fast ice has
broken up and drilling will proceed in
predominantly open water conditions
from early August on. Because
of the possibility
of ice incursions
during the open
water period,
however, and the
natural variability of the timing and duration of freezeup, Shell’s oil spill response strategies and
tactics are designed to cover a wide range
of open water and ice conditions (Fig. 2).

Planning, resources
Based on previous exploration programs in the Chukchi and Beaufort Sea regions, Shell has the experience to drill in
extreme arctic conditions. Shell’s goals are
to prevent oil spills, protect the environment, and work with local communities
to understand and preserve their cultural
needs. Proper planning, selecting advanced ice-capable vessels and equipment,
continually training on location, and
relying on local knowledge help create a
reliable oil spill prevention and control
program for the Beaufort Sea.

stream of a blowout. One configuration
involves recovery of oil downstream of an
open-apex, oil-deflection system with one
oil-spill response vessel, while the other
vessel moves to a backup storage tanker to
unload its recovered oil emulsion (Fig. 4).
The presence of cold water and ice can
actually enhance response effectiveness
by limiting oil spreading and slowing
the weathering processes that can make
oil more difficult to recover or burn. By
working with the natural environment as
much as possible (e.g., allowing oil to be
contained by ice), responders can often
increase the response window-of-opportunity and improve the effectiveness of
mechanical recovery and in situ burning
techniques.
Deliberate ice management (breaking large floes and moving or deflecting
ice) can be used in some situations to
extend the operating window for booms
and skimmers (Fig. 5). The goal is to have
access to a range of response options that
provide the greatest flexibility in being
able to deal with rapidly changing offshore environments.
As ice concentrations progress from
open drift to heavier pack ice conditions,
mechanical recovery systems experience progressively lower oil encounter
rates (are less effective) because crews
must shift from large open-apex boom
configurations to individual, over-the-side
skimmers. Operating with smaller, more
maneuverable skimmers, responders can
reach pockets of oil trapped against or
between ice cakes and floes or in leads.
These pockets of oil may also be accessible with over-the-side skimmers deployed
from the larger response vessels.
As the effectiveness of mechanical
recovery declines in expanding ice coverage, Shell would work closely with the
unified command and the Alaska regional
response team to assess continually the
potential for controlled burning. Once
authorized, Shell would refocus the primary response effort toward burning the
oil contained naturally by the ice. Ignition
during such operations normally involves
use of a helitorch, an aerial ignition device hung from a helicopter, to set fire to
the oil safely and reliably.

Combustion may also play an important immediate role for safety reasons in
the unlikely case of a blowout. Because
of the potential for large quantities of
natural gas and vapors from the surfacing
oil directly over the blowout, it is likely
that a decision would be made to ignite
the gas as soon as the drilling rig moves
off location. This action would eliminate
the risk of a dangerous accidental ignition
when vessels are close to the blowout, and
under certain conditions the burning of
the gas cloud could eliminate a significant
percentage of the surfacing oil as well.
Because of the importance of controlled burning as a rapid and effective
means of eliminating large volumes of oil
quickly with and without ice, Shell has
purchased and trained with state-of-theart equipment (i.e., fire boom, helitorches, hand-held igniters, etc.) for the burning of oil in place under a wide range of
environmental conditions (Fig. 6).
If the oil is properly contained (by fire
booms or ice), burning even relatively
thin layers only a few millimeters thick
can be 50-70% efficient. Thicker oil layers
commonly achieved in booms or windherded against ice or a shoreline can easily support removal efficiencies exceeding
90%. With burns potentially eliminating
about 1,000 bbl oil/hr over a burn area
only 100 ft diameter, the combustion of
oil holds promise for a spill source that
has a fixed location, is relatively localized
on the sea surface, and consists of highly
flammable, fresh oil.
The burn strategies described in Shell’s
oil spill contingency plan include realistic
assessments of the constraints in burning
of oil on water. For example, many oils
that are emulsified beyond 25% (waterin-oil) are difficult to ignite; and, should
winds exceed about 20 knots, it may also
be difficult to burn. All burning must be
approved and carried out according to
key safety issues, including avoiding other
flammable slicks close to the controlled
burn, completing all burning safely away
from any vessels or facilities, and planning
the burn so that the products of combustion (primarily the visible smoke plume)
do not impact communities and other
sensitive resources downwind.

The controlled, in situ burning of oil,
especially during extreme operating conditions that could reduce the efficiency
or the safety associated with physical removal techniques, often provides a highly
effective alternative response option. Controlled burning, especially in cold climates
(with or without ice present) is a proven
method to eliminate large quantities of
oil with minimal logistics and without

the need to store massive quantities of
recovered oil.
By working closely with regulatory
agencies and carefully monitoring the
trajectory of the smoke, Shell can ensure
oil is burned with minimal environmental
impact. Oil burns can be limited to sites
that are a safe distance, generally 3 or
more miles downwind of people and carried out in full compliance with federal

sharply enough that response strategies
need to include burning of oil to achieve
high oil removal rates.
Controlled burning is a proven arctic
response strategy developed in more than
30 years of experience incorporating
extensive lab and tank testing, large-scale
field trials, and actual incidents. Established guidelines are in place to allow in
situ burning to take place with scientifically monitored safeguards to protect
responders, the environment, and local
populations.
The physical characteristics associated with Shell’s worst-case spill scenario (i.e., the nature of the release
and environmental conditions) support
the choice of burning as an effective
response option in any significant ice
cover. Key considerations in support of
this position include:
• The fresh nature of oil released to the
surface.
• Limited oil spreading due to reduced
temperatures.
• Slower weathering rates related to
thicker films and lower wave energy.
• A high potential for effective oil
containment with ice in any close pack
condition.
• Moderate sea states commonly associated with any significant ice cover.

At an operational level, by having
vessels and critical resources at or near
the drilling locations, responders are able
to access the oil quickly and implement
the most appropriate response strategy
according to conditions at the time. The
availability of four highly capable support
icebreakers, including the latest generation of vessels with azimuthing (rotating)
drives, provides an opportunity to effectively to manage the ice for spill response
through such measures as ice deflection,
flushing trapped oil from beneath small
floes, and breaking down large floes to
expose oil for burning or recovery.
Important issues and uncertainties
affecting the success of a spill response
in ice involve the unpredictable and
dynamic nature of the offshore environment and challenges of operating late in
the season with freezing temperatures
and darkness.
Fortunately, at that time the ice acts
as an effective containment mechanism,
minimizing the contaminated area and
maintaining thick oil films for burning
through aerial ignition (reducing the
exposure of responders on the surface to
extreme conditions). In the case of a lateseason incident, proven techniques are
available to track oiled ice for extended
periods and to take advantage of oppor-

tunities to access the oil with helicoptertransported crews as the ice develops. ✦

For the past several years, a study led
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has
developed procedures for independent
estimation of flared gas volumes worldwide using satellite remote sensing.
None of the currently available earth
observation sensors is designed or
flown specifically for observing gas flaring, although several satellite systems
can detect gas flares based on the radiative emissions from the flames.
Oil producers often flare associated
gas because an area has no infrastructure for marketing or using the gas.
Venting the gas, without combustion,
is another alternative used in these production areas without infrastructures.
50

While producers keep reasonable
records on the quantities of oil and
natural gas brought to market, the
quantities of natural gas flared are much
less known.
Gas flaring wastes an energy resource, is a source of local pollution
due to trace chemicals in the gas, and
adds to the carbon burden in the global
atmosphere.
In recent years many companies,
governments, and international groups
have sought to reduce gas flaring. The
World Bank’s global gas flaring reduction (GGFR) initiative has published gas
flaring estimates for 20 countries and
has worked with individual countries to
encourage alternatives to gas flaring.
Because there are no requirements
for reporting gas flaring volumes, it is
difficult to know whether these efforts
are succeeding in reducing gas flaring.

Satellite systems

acquired by the Digital Globe Corp. If
one knows where to look in GE, it is
possible to find active gas flares.
Fig. 1 shows a set of nine gas flares
at three closely spaced sites located in
GE. The Digital Globe imagery on the
left was collected on Aug. 21, 2003. As
a comparison, a newer image, on the
right, collected by Digital Globe on
Sept. 24, 2007, found only one of the
nine flares active.
The loss of eight gas flares could
indicate that gas flaring was reduced,
or it might be chance that the other
eight were not active at the time of the
second image collection. The observations clearly require a larger number of
observations to document a reduction
in gas flaring.
The slow revisit rate and high cost
of acquiring and analyzing high-resolution imagery makes it impractical to
consider global monitoring of gas flares
with these sources. The alternative is to
monitor gas flaring with meteorological
or environmental satellite data having
coarser spatial resolution, global coverageand higher temporal frequency.

Satellite systems vary substantially in
terms of their spatial resolution, repeat
cycle, and collection-processing cost.

OLS collects global cloud imagery
with a pair of broad spectral bands
placed in the visible and thermal ranges.
One benefit of working with data
sources such as OLS is that it collects
many observations every year.

The DMSP satellites are in polar
orbits and each collects images from
14 orbits/day. With a 3,000 km swath
width, each OLS can collect a complete
set of global nighttime images in 24 hr.
At night, a photomultiplier tube (PMT)
intensifies the visible band signal, enabling OLS to detect moonlit clouds.
The boost in gain enables the detection of lights present at the earth’s

surface. Most lights are from outdoor
lighting in cities and towns. The OLS
sensor can also detect wildfires and
agricultural burning, but these are
short-lived. It also can detect light from
gas flares, which can be identified easily
when they are offshore or in isolated
areas not affected by urban lighting.
The study involved the processing of
a time-series of annual cloud-free composites of OLS nighttime lights spanOil & Gas Journal / Nov. 12, 2007

Four major gas flaring regions of the world in a Mollweide 1-km equal area projection are the Gulf of Guinea region of Africa,Western Siberia, Persian Gulf
(third image), and North Africa.The images are color composites made with the annual data from 1992 (blue), 2000 (green), and 2006 (red) (Fig. 3).
ning 1992 through 2006. Gas flares
were identified visually in the nighttime lights composites based on three
characteristics:
1. Because gas flares are bright point
sources of light with no shielding to the
sky, they tend to form circular lighting
features with a bright center and wide
rims.
2. Most gas flares are active for a
period of years, but a few gas flares
persist with little change in intensity for
a decade. Thus many gas flares exhibit
color in color-composite images made
with data from the beginning, middle,
and end of the nighttime lights time
series.
3. Gas flares tend to be in remote
locations, outside of urban centers. Offshore gas flares are easy to identify. For
onshore gas flares, the study reviewed

a US Department of Energy population
density grid to evaluate lights identified
as potential gas flares. Vector polygons
were created to outline and identify gas
flares for individual countries. The study
found gas flaring in 60 countries.
By combining the polygons for all
of the countries, the study extracted a
global map of gas flaring as observed
by the OLS for each year from 1992
to 2006. Fig. 2 is a colorized version
of the global map of gas flaring made
with flaring from 1992 as blue, 2000 as
green and 2006 as red. This global map
is available at http://www.ngdc.noaa.

ares.html.
________________________
Areas with many gas flares include
the Gulf of Guinea, North Africa, Persian Gulf, and Western Siberia (Fig. 3).

Estimated volumes
The study developed a method for
estimating gas flaring volumes for individual countries based on a “sum-oflights index” and a set of reported gas
flaring volumes for countries (from the
GGFR) and individual flares.
The “sum-of-lights” index values
are the tallies of the digital number
values extracted for the gas flares of
a particular country or an individual
flare. The values are intercalibrated
so that the data from each year can
be pooled and quantitatively compared. Note that the study was unable
adequately to intercalibrate the data
from the early part of the OLS record
(1992-94).
The steps in developing the calibration included removal of outliers,
regression modeling, and establishing

Condensate coming into its own
Condensate, one of the two groups
deﬁned as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs),
is ﬁnally coming of age in world trade,
marketing, reﬁning and petrochemicals. Condensate sales are moving
from a niche marketing specialty to
a mainstream segment of crude and
products trade, and nowhere is this
more evident than in the Mideast Gulf
and Asia Paciﬁc.
This report explains how the protean
nature of condensate allows it to be
used in a wide range of sectors: as a
reﬁnery slate component; in specialized distillation towers called condensate splitters; in direct feed to ethylene crackers; in gasoline blending and
as a substitute for gas in turbine power generation. It can be deﬁned as a
base material, a blending component,
a feedstock or a boiler feed.

A company’s safety
performance and avoidance of catastrophic
events is a direct result of
the organization’s corpoRefining
rate culture, according to
Carolyn Merritt, Former
Chairman of the US Chemical Safety
Board (CSB).
Speaking at the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association Q&A
and Technology Forum, Oct. 10,
in Austin, Merritt discussed corporate safety cultures, and their
relation to catastrophic events,
including the BP Texas City explosion (OGJ, Jan. 23, 2006, p.
51), the space shuttle Columbia
disaster, and the Bhopal incident.
According to Merritt, a company’s
culture is really reflected in the bonus
and promotion structure.

short-term operating process becomes
your long-term process, that’s when
you have a problem.”

Layers of protection
Merritt discussed safety in the context of the “layers of protection” model.
Layers of protection between employees
and potential risk or harm will decrease
the risk of an accident.
“The problem is people are very
good at bypassing, or putting holes in
those layers of protection. If they put
enough [holes] in there, you’re going
to have a hit somewhere along the line,”
she said. “But there is another potential
removal of a layer of protection that
has a much greater risk than what the
individual can do. And that is a corporate culture.”
Downsizing, combining of departments, and budget cuts severely affect
the infrastructure, training, hiring, and
placement of people. This results in the
removal of whole layers, not just poking holes in them.
Merritt said that companies must pay
attention to the commonalities between
past catastrophic events.
“It’s the culture that...allowed these
accidents to happen. And that culture
exists in all the catastrophic accidents,”
she said.

maintaining cost levels, then there’s a
problem. If it’s only [based] on production and not worrying about quality, it’s
a problem,” she said. “There are some

know that there are times that you have
to operate under short term. When that

“Corporate cultures do not want to
address problems and therefore they
choose not to do the process safety

catastrophic events from

Merritt discussed the events and
investigation findings behind the space
shuttle Columbia disaster.
“The first thing that the accident
investigation board found was that this
accident was not an anomalous random
event,” she said. “That means that it was
predictable and preventable.”
The organizational findings that the
investigation board found, according to
Merritt, were:
• Management was rewarded for
budgeting and scheduling goals, and
ignored employee concerns.
• There were communication silos.
“If you have a culture where no bad
news is really wanted, then you have a
culture that sets the stage for a catastrophic event,” Merritt said.

The fourth DryTree & Riser Forum will be held in Houston, Texas this
year at the OMNI Hotel on November 28, 2007. This year’s theme,
“Deeper Water - Practical Solutions,” will present practical experiences
relating to choices when choosing drytree production systems
and deepwater riser systems. During this one-day forum, speakers
and delegates will explore the technology, tools, decision-making
processes, and functional requirements of the concept selection
and execution employing drytrees and various riser systems.

Additionally, the first six presentations are made available through a
live webcast from the conference floor and participants will be able to
attend and ask pertinent questions and share insight during the first
half of the conference. The final six presentations are closed to press
to ensure that the extremely topical discussions and timely nature of
the conference material is maintained.

Pipelines

Background
The configuration of pipeline and
other linear construction sites creates
erosion and sediment control problems
not typically seen on conventional rectangular building lots. The limited width
of right-of-ways limits the effectiveness
of sediment traps and basins generally,
forcing reliance on perimeter controls.
Linear configuration also virtually
eliminates any opportunity to install
perimeter controls on the contour to
increase their effectiveness.

Controlled field testing used this test bed and rainfall simulator to test extreme
conditions for silt fence deployed in the field (Fig. 1).
64

The US Environmental Protection
Agency consistently cites sediment
as the primary pollutant of concern
in runoff from construction sites.1
Increased sediment loads almost always
cause degradation of streams and are
also implicated in degradation of wetlands, estuaries, lakes, and reservoirs.2
The pipeline industry has responded
to increased regulatory and public
pressure in a variety of ways, including
encouraging use of best management
practices on pipeline construction sites.
An example of this is Reasonable and
Prudent Practices for Stabilization, promoted by the Independent Petroleum
Producers Association.3
The guidance document outlining
these practices presents decision trees
for erosion and sediment control based
on region of the US, slope, proximity to
water body, and vegetative cover. In every case where erosion-control practices
are deemed necessary, the document
lists perimeter controls, silt fence, and
straw bales as recommended practices.
The pipeline construction industry
clearly has a strong interest in effective
perimeter controls for pipeline construction sites. The nearly universal use
of silt fence has generally yielded poor
results. Improper installation, lack of
maintenance, or installation on unsuitable sites, particularly those with steep
or long slopes, has generally been the
cause of failures. Field inspections
conducted by Barfield and Hayes of
more than 50 construction sites in

Is your CP
worthless?
NACE Standard
RP0169-2002 states:
“Materials....that create
electrical shielding
should not be used
on the pipeline” 1.

CONSIDER: If you use solid film backed corrosion
coatings, you may be crippling your CP investment.
There is a common sense reason for
this. CP systems protect pipelines by
delivering electrical current to the steel
surface. Solid film back corrosion
coatings have the property of high
dielectric strength, which means they
block electrical current. This blocking
effect is called cathodic shielding.
Cathodic shielding has been the subject
of dozens of technical papers since the
mid 1980’s.

Phone: (011) 214.515.5000
www.polyguardproducts.com

Two corrosion coatings are proven to
be non-shielding, and allow passage of
protective CP currents. One othese
coatings is FBE. The other is Polyguard
RD-6.
If you are concerned that your
organization is behind this curve, visit
www.polyguardproducts.com/failsafeco
ating.htm and review the large body of
______
information about shielding problems.

Polyguard has been ISO 9000 certified since 1996.
Current certifications are:
- American Natl. Standards Institute
- Dutch Council for Certification
- Deutscher Akkreditierungs Rat

New offshore capsule holds as many as six persons
The Frog-6—a higher-capacity version
of the original, three-person Frog-3 (OGJ,
Apr. 9, 2007, p. 67)—is designed to move
as many as six persons at a time by crane.
This new Frog has been specifically de-

veloped to reduce the number of crane operations required and to decrease the time
taken for crew transfers. It appears similar
to the Frog-3, retaining its tetrahedral design, but with differences. The frame and
seating arrangement has been expanded to
accommodate six persons. The suspension
system has been enhanced—comprising
three peripheral springs, hydraulic dampers, and larger feet to cushion impacts and
protect passengers.
Balancing the space required for six
people and keeping the footprint compact
led to the introduction of bench-style
seating. As a result, the Frog-6 footprint
is only fractionally larger than that of the
Frog-3, allowing for ease of storage and
landing on vessel decks. The bench seating
also speeds up the process of securing a
stretcher into the Frog in the event of a
MedEvac scenario.
In “marine ambulance” mode, the
Frog-6 can carry a stretcher and as many
as two accompanying passengers. The
low-temperature version of the Frog-6 is

capable of transferring people in temperatures as low as –40° C.

New gasket creates own load
The newly launched MULTI-SWELL
gasket is a self-loading general service
type, creating its own load when it comes
into contact with hydrocarbons or water,
virtually eliminating what the maker says
is the most common cause of gasket failure
—insufficient load.
This new material performs equally
well in oil or water, does not degrade in
contact with oils, and adapts easily to all
types of flange designs, suiting it for pipelines as well as exploration and production
uses. Particularly well-suited for maintenance, repair, and operation applications,
the gasket seals flanges in less than perfect
condition, minimizing maintenance, the
firm notes.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Wailing begins
about ruling on
deepwater leases
“This is a sad day for the American
public,” wailed Senate Energy Committee
Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) about a
court decision favoring an oil company in a
royalty dispute with large implications.
In ofﬁce at passage of the Deep Water
Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (DWRRA),
Bingaman claims to know Congress never
intended “to allow royalty-free oil regardless of price.”

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Yet a federal judge in Louisiana has
upheld a challenge by Kerr-McGee Oil &
Gas Corp., now Anadarko Petroleum Corp.,
to the Department of Interior’s authority
to collect royalty on production from eight
deepwater leases issued in 1996, 1997, and
2000 (OGJ Online, Nov. 1, 2007).
At issue are oil and gas price thresholds
capping royalty relief for production in
200 m or more of water. Interior’s Minerals Management Service inserted no such
thresholds in leases it issued in 1998 and
1999. Before its merger into Anadarko,
Kerr-McGee ﬁled a lawsuit arguing Interior
lacked authority under DWRRA to impose
thresholds in the other 3 years.
A look at the statute raises questions
about the recollections of Bingaman and
several other similarly minded lawmakers
about congressional intent.
The law discusses price thresholds
only with regard to deepwater leases in
existence at DWRR enactment. Because
Congress didn’t want royalty relief for
leases granted after enactment to preclude
development in deepwater areas already
under lease, much of the statute, including
all elaboration about price thresholds, addresses new production on existing leases.
For leases issued in the 5 years after
enactment, DWRR refers to a general paragraph that says royalty can be suspended
for “a period, volume, or value of production” determined by Interior, with suspension subject to variation according to the
price of production.
But it adds, “[T]he suspension of royalties shall be set at a volume of not less
than” production totals calibrated to water
depth.
That this phrase begins with the words
“except that,” together with silence on price
thresholds in language related to leases
issued for 5 years after enactment of the
law, seems to mean Congress intended for
production volumes to be the only limits on
royalty relief.
A judge in Louisiana thinks so.

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Anticipating $100/bbl oil
Crude prices swung sharply during the trading week of Oct. 29-Nov. 2, ﬂuctuating
at record levels of $93-95/bbl that had many analysts anticipating $100/bbl oil within
weeks.
“It was a rollercoaster week for oil prices,” said Robert S. Morris, Banc of America
Securities LLC, New York. The market got a boost at midweek with a larger than
expected drop in crude inventories for the second straight week.
On Oct. 29, the December contract for benchmark US crudes climbed to record
highs for the ﬁfth consecutive trading session, setting new intraday and closing records above $93/bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange, due to a weak dollar and
stormy weather that shut in some of Mexico’s crude production the previous week.
But then prices tumbled to $90.38/bbl Oct 30 in the largest correction of the year
as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., New York, advised investors to take their proﬁts from
the recent rally. “Nowadays the price of oil is set not by a few countries in the Middle
East, but by a few banks on Wall Street,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of
Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. “The Goldman report will very surely push
some market participants to turn from buying the dips to selling the rallies,” he predicted at the time.
‘Mother of stock draws’
On Oct. 31, however, the crude contract rebounded to a record $94.53/bbl closing
then continued climbing to $95.28/bbl in after-hours electronic trading on NYMEX as
the US Department of Energy reported “the mother of all stock draws” from commercial crude storage at Cushing, Okla., instead of the slight build that traders were
expecting for the week ended Oct. 26.
“We thought the size of the [Oct. 30] correction had diminished the chances that
we would be able to open the $95/bbl doors to $100/bbl,” said Jakob. But with such
extreme volatility, he said, “It is impossible to exclude the reach of $100/bbl before
the end of the week.”
Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc. in London said, “Our conservative expectation is for [benchmark US crude] to average $90.70/bbl this quarter.”
Most of the drawdown was at the key Cushing, Okla., delivery point for NYMEX,
where oil stocks fell 3.1 million bbl to 15.1 million bbl. “The world economy is taken
hostage by a few million barrels in Cushing, and there is little that the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries can do about it,” Jakob said then.
The sharp drop in crude inventories “occurred without any uptick in reﬁnery runs,
following only a minor rise in imports,” Horsnell noted. “The overall build [of crude
and petroleum products] is down to its lowest since October 2005,” he said.
Record low dollar
The US dollar hit a record low against the euro Oct. 31 after the Federal Open
Market Committee cut the federal funds rate (the rate commercial banks charge on
overnight loans among themselves) by 0.25 percentage point to 4.5%. “The single
variable that exhibits the strongest correlation to the rise in oil prices over the past
year is the concurrent drop in the US dollar,” Morris said.
The December crude price fell to $93.49/bbl Nov. 1 on NYMEX, but not before
setting a new intraday price record of $96.24/bbl. Again the inﬂuencing factors were
outside the fundamentals of supply and demand for oil; instead, the value of the
dollar improved against the euro on Nov. 1. Oil usually moves in the opposite market
direction from the dollar, since a stronger dollar reduces the appeal of commodities
as a hedge against inﬂation.
On Nov. 2, the December crude price rebounded to a record closing of $95.93/bbl
amid indications of a stronger US economy and possible new United Nations sanctions against Iran over its nuclear power program. “The US government reported
twice as many new nonfarm jobs as expected were added in October, which alleviated fears of an economic downturn, at least for the moment,” Morris said. Meanwhile, the British Foreign Ofﬁce said the UN Security Council agreed to draft a new
sanctions resolution that could be passed in November unless Iran cooperates with
the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Reﬁnery problems contributed to the Nov. 2 price rise in crude prices. Petroplus
Holdings AG’s 172,000 b/d reﬁnery in England expects production to be limited for a
month due to a ﬁre. Chevron Corp. said its 330,000 b/d reﬁnery in Pascagoula, Miss.,
will operate at reduced rates until early next year because of a ﬁre in August.

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs
once considered economically and technically impossible. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds
now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy. But they’re still
unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them
are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional
reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires continuous rethinking
- the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 - Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by
editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight
innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and
learn from other professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.

COVER
ExxonMobil Corp.’s Baytown,Tex., refinery will undergo efforts to
increase supplies and reduce the sulfur content of motor gasoline
and diesel. ExxonMobil will invest more than $1 billion at its
refineries in Baytown, Baton Rouge, La., and Antwerp, Belgium.
This investment will increase the supply of cleaner burning diesel
by 6 million gpd. With a crude capacity of about 567,000 b/d,
the Baytown refinery is the largest in the US. OGJ’s special report

In troubled times fierce global
competition for premium crudes
means that refinery units must
have the flexibility to handle
heavy, viscous, dirty crudes that
increasingly threaten to dominate
markets. And flexibility must
extend to products as well as
crudes, for refinery product
demand has become more and
more subject to violent economic
and political swings. Thus refiners must have the greatest flexibility in determining yields of
naphtha, jet fuel, diesel and vacuum gas oil products.

Why Do Many
Crude/Vacuum
Units Perform
Poorly?
In many cases it’s because the
original design was based more
on virtual than actual reality.
There is no question: computer
simulations have a key role
to play but it’s equally true
that process design needs to be
based on what works in the field
and not on the ideals of the
process simulator. Nor should the
designer simply base the equipment selection on vendor-stated
performance. The design engineer needs to have actual refinery
process engineering experience,
not just expertise in office-based

PROCESS

CONSULTING
SERVICES,INC.

modeling. Refinery hands-on
experience teaches that fouling,
corrosion, asphaltene precipitation, crude variability, and crude
thermal instability, and many
other non-ideals are the reality.
Theoretical outputs of process or
equipment models are not. In this
era of slick colorful PowerPoint®
presentations by well-spoken
engineers in Saville Row suits,
it’s no wonder that units don’t
work. Shouldn’t engineers wearing Nomex® coveralls who have
worked with operators and taken
field measurements be accorded
greater credibility?
Today more than ever before this
is important. Gone are the days
when a refiner could rely on
uninterrupted supplies of light,
sweet, easy-to-process crudes.
3400 Bissonnet
Suite 130
Houston, Texas 77005
USA

Rather than a single point process
model, the crude/vacuum unit
design must provide continuous
flexibility to operate reliably over
long periods of time. Simply
meeting the process guarantee 90
days after start-up is very different than having a unit still operating well after 5 years. Sadly few
refiners actually achieve this—no
matter all the slick presentations
by engineers in business suits!

If you want to explore these issues
in technical detail ask for
Technical Papers 267 and 268.

Alaska lawmakers asked to fund in-state gas line
Alaska Gov. Sarah H. Palin urged state legislators Apr. 17 to approve $9 million in preparatory funding for pipeline work in an
effort to avoid delays in constructing an in-state natural gas pipeline system.
Her action came after some members of the state’s House Finance Committee expressed concern the preceding night that the
governor’s administration had not adequately communicated its
position on an in-state gas pipeline.
Originally proposed as part of the huge proposed project to
move gas from Alaska’s North Slope to markets in the Lower 48
states, a system to bring gas to the state’s widely scattered communities has attracted growing support as a stand-alone project from
several government officials in the state.
“My focus is Alaska, and this administration has not shifted
from our top priority: commercializing natural gas for Alaskans,”
Palin said. “This session we have been working diligently to address statewide energy needs, and the in-state gas pipeline project
is a critical component of that effort. I appreciate lawmakers’ assistance in moving this effort along.”
Members of her administration have testified before state legislative committees, and the proposed project’s manager, Harry Noah,
has conducted open working groups with legislators, she noted.
Palin said she also has met with Alaska House and Senate leaders to
discuss plans to jump-start an in-state gas pipeline development.
Palin said she introduced two in-state gas development bills,
HB 163/SB 135 and HB 164/SB 136, which have been heard in
House and Senate energy committees. The House and Senate have
passed several in-state gas resolutions, and the House amended HB
44 on Apr. 14 to include language for HB 163, the governor’s bill,
to expand the Alaska Natural Gas Development Authority’s powers,
she said.
The $9 million of funding would advance the proposed project
through the second phase of a four-phased plan to develop an instate gas pipeline, which her administration presented on Mar. 3,
Palin said. Her office distributed an overview of the plan to House
Finance Committee members Apr. 17, she said.

Texas wholesaler, ofﬁcials plead guilty to charges
A Texas oil wholesaler and two of its executives pleaded guilty
to violating the federal safe drinking-water law, the US Department
of Justice said Apr. 16.
Texas Oil & Gathering Inc., its owner John Kessel, and its operations manager Edgar Pettijohn pleaded guilty to violating the Safe
Drinking-Water Act for disposing of oil-contaminated waste water
from its refinery process at an underground injection well permitted to accept wastes only from exploration and production operations, DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division said.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

It said the Alvin, Tex.-based company also pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA) for disposing of waste at a facility that did not have a
permit. The crimes took place from January 2000 through January
2003, DOJ said.
The defendants misrepresented that the wastewater it was disposing at a Rosasharon, Tex., injection well came from an oil well
the company had leased and was developing when the waste water
actually came from various refinery and chemical liquids Texas Oil
& Gathering had reclaimed, federal prosecutors said.
The government began to investigate after the well exploded
and killed three workers. Although the defendants did not cause
the blast, a closer review of waste in the well led to their prosecution, DOJ said.
It said that Texas Oil & Gathering faces a maximum $500,000
fine or twice the monetary gain or loss for the conspiracy count,
and $50,000/day, twice the gain or loss, or $500,000, whichever
is higher, for the RCRA count. Kessel and Pettijohn face up to 8
years in prison and a fine as high as $500,000, it added.
The pleas were entered in US District Court for Texas’ Southern
District. Judge Keith P. Ellison scheduled sentencing for Sept. 15.

Producers settle air pollution charges in Utah
Six independent producers agreed to spend $6.4 million to
comply with the US Clean Air Act at their eastern Utah natural gas
production facilities, federal regulators said Apr. 17.
The three settlements with Bill Barrett Corp., Wind River Corp.,
XTO Energy Inc., Dominion Exploration & Production Inc., Whiting Oil & Gas Corp., and Miller Dyer & Co. mandate air pollution
reductions and conservation practices at the companies’ wellheads,
pipelines, and compressor stations, the US Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice said in a joint announcement.
They said the agreements cover operations on the Uintah and
Ouray Indian Reservation near Vernal. They were filed in federal
district court in Salt Lake City.
The $6.4 million of outlays include retrofitting pneumatic controls with lower emitted components, reviewing processes to increase gas recovery and reduce air emissions at compressor stations
and wellsites, installing low-bleed or no-bleed pneumatics, and
controlling emission sources such as large engines, gas dehydrators, and condensate tanks at all new facilities constructed in the
next 5 years, the federal agencies said.
It also includes shale-plating all future access roads, spending
$100,000 to fund two ambient air monitoring stations’ operation
and maintenance for a year, and using less polluting and more energy-efficient technologies in pilot programs, they added.

The companies also agreed to pay $632,000 in fines and to
spend $200,000 on supplemental environmental projects, EPA and
DOJ said. They said complaints, which were filed along with the
settlements, alleged that the producers violated hazardous air pollutant emissions standards; federal permitting, emissions monitoring, and reporting requirements; and other Clean Air Act provisions.

Exploration

EPA said Dominion E&P and Miller Dyer came forward and discussed their violations under the agency’s self-audit program. All of
the producers cooperated to resolve the violations, it noted.
The investments will reduce air pollution by more than 1,300
tonnes/year and conserve enough gas to heat 1,080 homes/year,
according to EPA. ✦

Development

ExxonMobil moving in rig at Point Thomson
ExxonMobil Production Co. has mobilized the drilling rig for
the Point Thomson Project.
The rig, owned by Nabors Alaska, has been upgraded to drill the
high pressure wells at Point Thomson. It was moved from Deadhorse to the drilling site in modules, some weighing more than 1
million lb.
No permanent roads exist to Point Thomson, so Fairweather
E&P Services Inc. and Nanuq/AFC constructed more than 30 miles
of ice road to enable the transport of heavy equipment and materials while protecting the North Slope environment. Most of the ice
road follows the Beaufort Sea shore.
The Alaska Department of Natural Resources authorized the ice
road permits on Jan. 27, 2009, allowing mobilization of the rig,
and provided guidance to other regulatory agencies to expedite
permitting to allow drilling to begin.
Craig Haymes, Alaska production manager for ExxonMobil,
said, “We are moving forward with drilling and development activities at Point Thomson, for the mutual benefit of Alaskans and
the Point Thomson Unit working interest owners. DNR staff and
other local, state, and federal agencies have worked tirelessly to
process permits necessary to allow drilling to begin.
“We are on schedule to begin production at Point Thomson by
yearend 2014 and look forward to working with the state to resolve the remaining Point Thomson issues to ensure the project
schedule is not impacted.
“Construction crews recently completed the final installation of
camps and support facilities at the existing gravel pad to accept the
rig. Over 250 people will work on these drilling operations, with
an average of over 500 people at yearend 2014, when we expect to
begin production,” Haymes said.
The initial phase of the project will process 200 MMcfd of Point
Thomson gas in order to produce 10,000 b/d of condensate into
the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System by the end of 2014. The remaining gas will be recycled into the Point Thomson reservoir.
The Point Thomson Unit working interest owners committed
$120 million to the drilling and development activities in 2008,
with additional investments of about $250 million expected in
2009.
In addition to ExxonMobil, the other major Point Thomson
owners participating in the current drilling and development activity include BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. and ConocoPhillips Alaska
Inc.

Haynesville shale gas wells in East Texas and North Louisiana in
2009.
The company reported encouraging results from its own drilling and those of other producers, and the 2009 program will enable it to improve its understanding of the play, further evaluate its
lands, and retain prospective acreage.
To facilitate unrestrained market access for its gas, the company
has committed to supply 150 MMcfd on the proposed Gulf South
pipeline expansion and 500 MMcfd on the proposed ETC Tiger
pipeline.
Meanwhile, EnCana chalked up a 50% production increase in
the Deep Bossier play in East Texas, where it averaged 409 MMcfd
of production in the first quarter compared with an average of 334
MMcfd for all of 2008.
EnCana drilled 15 wells in the first quarter and 78 in all of East
Texas in 2008.
Initial 30-day production rates in Amoruso field averaged more
than 19 MMcfd, and the Charlene-1 well completed in January
flowed at more than 50 MMcfd on initial tests.

Horn River drilling, gas plant take shape
EnCana Corp., Calgary, and its partner Apache Corp., Houston,
have adopted a more efficient way to develop gas in the Horn River
basin shales of Northeast British Columbia, EnCana said.
The companies hope to be able to drill fewer wells by increasing
the number of fracs per horizontal leg to as many as 14 from the
eight initially planned.
The companies will drill 12 wells in 2009, down from 20 originally planned.
EnCana is to build the Cabin gas processing plant 60 km northeast of Fort Nelson, BC, on behalf of industry co-owners that are
major landholders in the basin. Its first phase is due in service in the
third quarter of 2011. Initial capacity is 400 MMcfd, and the plant
will be expanded in stages as the basin’s gas production grows.

Salazar announces OCS revenue shares

Six US coastal states will share nearly $500 million from offshore oil and gas revenues in fiscal 2009 and 2010 to help restore

Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said on Apr. 20.
Salazar said Alabama, Alaska, California, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Texas, and their coastal local governments will have access to the

tions of the money will go directly to 67 coastal political subdivisions, DOI said.
It said that Alaska’s allocation rose more than 1,500% from
the minimum in 2007 and 2008 because of about $2.6 billion
of bonus payments in OCS Lease Sale No. 193 in the Chukchi Sea,
held in February 2008, and variability of production in the Gulf of
Mexico due to recent hurricanes. ✦

Production

BP ramps up Thunder Horse production
BP America has ramped up production by more than 100,000
boe/d from its Thunder Horse platform in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico through new wells.
Last month, the $1 billion platform produced more than
300,000 boe/d from seven wells. In December, production was
over 200,000 boe/d from the third and fourth wells, signaling
completion of commissioning and full operation. Thunder Horse
now accounts for 1 of every 6 bbl of oil produced in the US.
Another two wells are to be added later this year to Thunder
Horse, the gulf’s largest deepwater producing asset, which is 150
miles southeast of New Orleans. The additions are key to boosting
BP’s future production in the area.
Designed to process 250,000 b/d and 200 MMcfd of gas,
Thunder Horse produced its first shipment of oil last June. Operations with the technologically innovative project had been delayed
by years due to technical problems and hurricanes. The field was
originally discovered in 1999 in a reservoir 3 miles beneath mud,
rock, and salt with pressures of 13,000-18,000 psi and temperatures of 88-135º C.
The Thunder Horse semisubmersible platform is in 6,050 ft of
water on Mississippi Canyon Blocks 778 and 822. It has a deck load
capacity of 40,000 tonnes. Production-drilling-quarters (PDQ)
functions enable drilling subsea wells from the platform and processing production from the wells. Subsea wells are connected to
production manifolds on the seafloor and then to the PDQ via riser
flowlines.
Production is delivered to existing shelf and onshore pipelines
via the Proteus and Endymion oil pipeline systems and the Okeanos
gas pipeline system, which are part of the Mardi Gras Transportation System, the highest capacity deepwater pipeline system ever
built.
BP operates the asset with 75% ownership, and ExxonMobil
Corp. has 25%.

standing with Sevan Production UK Ltd. to use the floating production, storage, and offloading system.
Premier Oil is purchasing Oilexco North Sea Ltd. (OSNL), former operator of Shelley, which announced insolvency in January
after failing to secure finance for its development program (OGJ
Online, Mar. 27, 2009).
Shelley, now being drilled, is expected to produce more than
30,000 b/d starting in summer with the Sevan Voyageur FPSO,
which is already moored at the field.
Sevan expects to operate the FPSO and receive reimbursement
for the operating cost and a tariff payment based on actual monthly
revenue from oil production from the field. “Work will now commence towards conclusion of a fully termed agreement,” said Premier Oil.
Timing of Shelley’s production depends on the availability of
diving support vessels.
OSNL’s creditors approved a company voluntary arrangement
that will help in the $505 million sale of the company to Premier
Oil. It is awaiting approval from its shareholders, among other
measures, before the deal can be finalized.

Sevan Marine licenses FPSO technology

Sevan Marine ASA has agreed to license to Eni Norge AS the
technology required for its circular floating production, storage,
and offloading vessel that will process oil and gas from Goliat field
in the Barents Sea.
Sevan Marine’s 1000 FPSO will have an oil production capacity
of 100,000 b/d, gas production of 3.9 million cu m/day, and oil
storage capacity of 1 million bbl. Subsea wells will be linked to the
FPSO, with flowlines and risers scheduled to be installed in JuneJuly 2010 and May-August 2011. The field will start production in
2013 and is expected to produce for 15-20 years.
Eni in March awarded the postfeed engineering contract to Sevan for the FPSO, but it has not yet selected a contractor for the
engineering, procurement, and construction work (OGJ Online,

Crude oil port partners leave joint venture
A partnership to build a large offshore crude oil receiving terminal in the US Gulf of Mexico has dissolved.
Houston-based Enterprise Products Partners LP and TEPPCO
O/S Port System LLC, an affiliate of TEPPCO Partners LP, have jointly withdrawn from the Texas Offshore Port System partnership in
a disagreement with the third partner, an affiliate of Oiltanking
Holdings America Inc.
Enterprise announced its decision Apr. 21; TEPPCO on Apr. 16.
Enterprise and TEPPCO each relinquishes its one-third interest,
forfeits its initial investment, and has taken a one-time noncash
charge of $34 million against second-quarter 2009 earnings.
In August 2008, affiliates of Enterprise, TEPPCO, and Oiltanking
Holding Americas Inc. formed a joint venture to design, construct,
own, and operate a new Texas offshore crude oil port and pipeline
system for delivering waterborne crude to refining centers along
the upper Texas Gulf Coast.
TOPS was to include an offshore port, two onshore storage facilities with about 5.1 million bbl of crude storage capacity, and
an associated 160-mile, 1.8 million b/d pipeline. Total cost of the
project was estimated at $1.8 billion.
According to nearly identical press releases from both companies, Oiltanking has responded by alleging that the dissociation is
wrongful breach of the TOPS partnership agreement. Both companies say their actions “are permitted by, and in accordance with, the
terms of the TOPS partnership agreement,” and they will, “should
the need arise,…vigorously defend” their actions. At presstime Apr.
22, a promised statement from Oiltanking had not been issued.

Arrow’s CSM-LNG proposal gets approval
Brisbane-based Arrow Energy Ltd. and its partner Liquefied

Gladstone, Queensland. The approval completes the EIS process and
enables the partners to progress to development approvals stage.
Five specific approvals are now needed to enable a final investment decision to be taken on the project by yearend.
The group also is working with the Gladstone Ports Corp. to

obtain access to the site so that early preparation works can begin
in October. The overall plan involves construction of a 450 km
pipeline from Arrow’s CSM fields in the Surat basin of southeastern Queensland to Gladstone where LNG Ltd. will build the initial
1.5-million-tonne/year LNG plant at Fisherman’s Landing. A second train of similar capacity also is planned.
Arrow will have primary responsibility for the CSM development, while LNG Ltd. will focus on the plant development.
Arrow can acquire up to 20% interest in the Fisherman’s Landing facilities and also has an option to acquire a 50% stake in any
other CSM-LNG plants subsequently developed.
The scheduled on-stream date for the first train is 2012.

AGA Gas awards LNG terminal contract
AGA Gas AB plans to import LNG through a small scale terminal
55 km south of Stockholm by May 2011, a company spokesman
told OGJ. The terminal with capacity to process 300,000-400,000
tonnes/year of LNG will be at Brunnsviksholme outside Nynashamn. It will be supplied with LNG from the Skangass liquefaction plant in Stavanger, which has a capacity of 300,000 tonnes/
year, and other terminals in Europe.
“Our terminal will have 20,000 cu m of storage capacity,” said
the company representative. “We have awarded the construction
contract of the terminal to NCC Construction Sweden.”
A new LNG tank will be built in slip form 33 m high and 38
m in diameter. It is expected to be finished during the first half of
2010. The terminal and tank will cost 275 million Swedish Krona.
“The terminal…will be the first of its type in Sweden and will
facilitate the utilization of natural gas in Central Sweden. Fortum,
among others, will use the natural gas to replace petroleum for
city-gas production in Stockholm and the Nynas refinery will use
the natural gas in its production of hydrogen gas,” said NCC Construction. The harbor for the terminal will receive tankers 160 m
in length with a depth of 9 m. “These will be ships with a capacity
of 50,000 cu m,” the AGA Gas spokesman told OGJ.
A 100-m bridge will connect Brunnsviksholme with the mainland. The contract also includes construction of a service building,
an access road to Norviksvagen, a vehicle bay for receipt of LNG,
and some ground work. ✦

Wrong attitudes
The editorial “Stopping the juggernaut” to me highlighted all that is wrong
with attitudes in the oil and gas industry today (OGJ, Apr. 6, 2009, p. 20).
Instead of acknowledging the problems
with the failing US auto industry and its
unwillingness to adapt to consumers’
wants and needs by producing desirable
and fuel-efficient cars, the author turns
the argument to personal attacks on the
Obama administration using terms like
“radicalism”, “btu bankruptcy,” and “environmental extremism.” Exactly what is
extreme about building cleaner cars and
wanting to conserve a valuable and finite
resource for future generations?
The oil and gas business will continue
to thrive and provide society with the
resources it needs, regardless of government intervention or lack thereof. The
demand for oil and gas is not going to
decrease at any time in the foreseeable

future, and to suggest that producing more fuel-efficient cars will lead
to some sort of economic catastrophe
or steer fuel consumption away from
petroleum is both foolish and irresponsible. If the oil and gas industry cannot
adapt to changing markets by investing
in greener technologies and promoting
the efficient and responsible use of its
products then maybe the industry as a
whole needs to take a good look at itself.
Efforts by the petroleum industry should
be focused on staying relevant, being
innovative, and adapting to the changing marketplace, and this can only help
to diversify and strengthen the economy
over the longer term.

Somewhat belatedly I read your
splendid editorial about Barrack Obama’s
arrogant sacking of GM Chairman Rick
Wagoner and the dangers this portends
for the oil and gas industry (OGJ, Apr. 6,
2009, p. 20). Having spent most of my
professional life in the Detroit area, and
having done 450 metallurgical studies
for Ford Motor Co. and also 1,000 testing jobs on high-strength steels for sour
oil and gas wells, some of my comments
might be of interest.
Only the federal government had
the power to bring the world’s greatest and most successful corporation to
its knees. The existence of roughly 75
million GM cars and trucks on American
highways today should be testimony
enough to GM’s success. Americans
love their products. They’re functional,
long-lasting, beautifully styled, and part

of Americana. My wife and I couldn’t
be happier with our two Buicks. It was
GM that gave America the electric starter,
automatic transmission, and countless
dozens of other automotive innovations
copied by all the foreign competition.
More than any other companies, it was
GM and Ford that made the mountain
of vehicles, aircraft engines, planes, and
weapons that got us through World War
II.
If GM had simply grown with the
population and the economy since the
heady days of the ’50s and ’60s, its
market capitalization would be nearly
a trillion dollars today. Instead, it had
crashed to under $1 billion at the low
point about a month ago. Only the feds
could have brought about this thousandfold implosion. Though the news media
and Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) remain
totally ignorant of the government’s role
in bringing down this industrial colos-

sus, I can sum it up in a few key steps:
1. The Wagner Act of 1936. This put all
the bargaining power in the United Auto
Worker’s hands. At contract time the
union singles out Ford or GM and presents its extreme demands (pattern bargaining). Does the targeted auto company gleefully serve up super-high wages
for unskilled assembly jobs, gold-plated
health benefits, “30-and-out” retirement (at ages as low as 47 or 48), and
nearly full pay for not working during a
slowdown, simply out of the goodness
of its heart? Not at all. Every day that the
union is on strike, that company loses
customers to the other automakers. This
drives the company to its knees, leading
to the present exorbitant cost structure
of the Big 3. The Wagner Act prevents
the Big 3 from locking arms and saying,
“There won’t be another car made in
Detroit until this contract is settled.”
Such a position would lead to much
more reasonable wages and benefits,
competitive with those of the Japanese,
Korean, and German transplants.
2. Foreign competition. It was the genius
of our founding fathers, saying no to
imports from England and creating the
rights of private property and the ideas
of free enterprise, that brought on our
high standard of living and lucrative
markets. No other country had this.
Why then were the Japanese allowed to
waltz in and steal vast chunks of our rich
automotive market? Originally, foreign
imports were seen only as a way to help
Germany and Japan rebuild their broken
economies after World War II. That
thought was overlooked and forgotten
after their economies rebounded. The
Japanese had a great advantage because
their laws forced them to build small
cars for their narrow streets. Sadly, our
policymakers have zero loyalty to American workers, and the foreign competition closed Big 3 factories and squeezed
profits.
3. Excessive regulations. You could fill a
large room with all the costly regulations
that Congress has dumped on the auto
industry. Worst of all are the emission
regulations that have reached absurdly
low limits of hydrocarbons, NOx, and
carbon monoxide. Never mind the fact
that exhaust gases are vastly cleaner than

18

when I was a boy (and those don’t seem
to have hurt me), they continue to cut
the limits in half about every 5 years.
Cynically, I would describe this as job security for the Environmental Protection
Agency bureaucracy, for the EPA emissions laboratory located 1 mile from my
home, and for all the inspection stations.
It’s like jumping half way to a line: You
never get there. But an immense amount
of research and development has been
spent by the Big 3 to meet these unjustifiable limits. Furthermore, the rising
CAFE standards in themselves reduce
emissions, obviating the need for the
extremely low limits. Needless to say, the
very strict emission limits have added a
lot to the cost of cars and have reduced
fuel economy. Henry Ford would roll
over in his grave if he heard that we are
putting burnt gases back through the
engine.
4. Wall Street bankers—the coup de grace.
One year ago my son Ed, an engineer
at the Cadillac engine plant in Livonia,
Mich., told me that GM was going to
be just fine. They had the fabulous new
Chevrolet Malibu, the popular Cadillac
CTS, and other fine new products; gas
mileage and reliability were excellent;
they had fewer recalls than the Japanese;
and the stock price was about $25-40.
But recently the stock price was under
$2, and the market cap under $1 billion.
What happened? Gasoline at $4.50/gal
(partly caused by Wall Street speculators?) killed the markets for the only
vehicles (SUVs and pickup trucks) they
really made money on. But then, when
gas prices plunged, the banking collapse
brought on by greedy bankers (with
shockingly inept oversight by Congress,
of which Obama was a member) kept
potential car buyers from getting loans
on new cars. Plain and simple, it was
the utter greed and malfeasance of the
bankers that have suddenly brought the
Big 3 to their woeful state. With meager
inflow of money to meet their prodigious legacy costs, GM burned cash at
billions per month and was forced to
ask Washington for help. As you stated,
the feds became “emergency creditor” to GM, and Obama exploited the
situation, abusing his power to sack the

very competent Rick Wagoner. Imagine:
Obama, who never managed anything as
big as a hamburger stand or a car wash,
destroying the head of the world’s largest manufacturing company!
I know very many engineers that
work, or have worked for the auto
industry. With rare exceptions, they are
very intelligent, competent, and dedicated. I would stack them up against the
banking executives any day. How strange
that the bankers, earning obscene salaries and bonuses, get off scot-free while
shoving my engineering friends into
the unemployment line and millions of
other American workers into desperate
financial circumstances. Someone noted
that most of the 10 men on Barrack’s
automotive team drive foreign cars. How
much loyalty to the Detroit folks can we
expect from them?

Markey uses the d-word
US Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) deployed the
d-word as he opened subcommittee hearings on
legislation calling for aggressive action on climate
change. The d-word is denial—the political crime
of wondering out loud if human beings really
should try to reengineer the climate. Punishment
for this offense is ostracism.
“The time for delay and denial and inaction
has come to an end,” Markey declared Apr. 21
before his Energy and Environment Subcommittee
of the Energy and Commerce Committee began
hearing testimony on the American Clean Energy
and Security Act. Markey and Henry Waxman of
California, chairman of the full committee, sponsor the bill. They of course displaced John Dingell
of Michigan as committee chair and Rick Boucher
of Virginia as the subcommittee leader, whom
environmental extremists found too soft on global
warming. “It’s time,” Markey said, “to put Americans back to work in the jobs needed to bring
about the age of the clean energy economy.”

than overhaul of the US economy. And it leaves no
room for disagreement—or what some dismiss as
denial. The ruling elite has decided to manipulate
emissions of greenhouse gases, and there will be
no further discussion about the need for or wisdom of doing so.
Denial of a different type is fiercely at work
here. It relates to cost.
At this point, arguments over details are distractions. The central mechanism of climate adjustment almost surely will be a cap on emissions
accompanied by a system for trading emission
allowances. The allowances might be auctioned at
the start of the program or distributed at low or
no initial cost. The difference has to do more with
timing than with the existence or amount of cost.
Fundamentally, any system to control emissions
of greenhouse gases must lower use of cheap
energy and raise use of expensive substitutes. This
formula yields cost. And inevitable inefficiencies of
implementation, including the corruption certain

Oil and gas producers—slammed by
the worldwide economic downturn,
lower oil and gas prices, and tight credit
markets—have slashed their 2009 capital budget plans.
Capital expenditures for oil and gas
projects are set to shrink worldwide this
year, with outlays in the US especially
hard hit.
OGJ’s annual capital spending survey
shows that oil and gas
industry capital spending in the US will fall
26% this year to $242
billion.
Total Canadian
spending will decline
15% to $53 billion
(Can.), but spending plans indicate
an increase in Mexico. Outside North
America, upstream oil and gas capital
expenditures will decline from a year
ago.
In response to the worldwide economic downturn and resulting drop

Southeast Asia still growing, there will
be no precipitous decline in costs during this downturn.
Earlier this month the Conference
Board reported that real gross domestic
product in the US is forecast to have declined 5.9% during the first quarter of
this year, signaling a deep point in the
recession, and that the US may see real
GDP decline 2.6% in 2009; this would
be the largest decline since 1946.
“The Conference Board projects that
growth in the second quarter will stay
negative and will be very slow in the
third quarter as capital spending will
remain low and inventories will not be
depleted until year’s end. Overall industrial production is also unlikely to move
up before the fall. Even the recovery
in the fourth quarter will be held back

The larger operators mostly have

WHERE FUNDS WILL GO FOR US PROJECTS

US upstream spending
Spending in the US for upstream
operations will decline almost 29%
this year. This includes outlays for oil
and gas exploration, drilling, production, and offshore lease payments to the
Minerals Management Service.
This upstream outlook is based in
part on OGJ’s annual drilling forecast,
which predicted that the total number
of US well completions in 2009 would
be 43,384 (OGJ, Jan. 19, 2009, p. 35).
The 2008 well completion total is estimated at 52,097.
In the wake of soaring worldwide
demand for inputs such as labor, drilling rigs, steel, and copper, costs have
been reassessed since the last edition
of OGJ’s capital spending outlook
(OGJ, Apr. 28, 2008, p. 20). This led
to upward revisions of 2008 upstream
spending figures.
But 2009 drilling and exploration
capital expenditures in the US will
decline 27% from last year to $174.6
billion.
Low oil and gas prices have slowed
drilling and curtailed production in
most areas of the US. The American
Petroleum Institute this month reported
that first-quarter 2009 US oil and gas
drilling activity dipped to levels not
seen since 2004.
According to API’s latest Quarterly
Well Completion Report, an estimated
11,071 oil wells, gas wells, and dry
holes were completed in the first quarter of 2009, down 22% from a year
earlier and down 35% from last year’s
fourth quarter. The estimated number
of new exploratory wells fell 11% from
first-quarter 2008.
The API statistics show that gas
continues to be the primary target for
US drilling, with an estimated 5,735
gas wells completed in the first quarter, down 23% from a year earlier.
This decline represents the most severe
quarterly decline for gas drilling in this
decade, API said.

In December 2008, Sunoco Inc.
reported that it would focus on base
maintenance and the completion of
major compliance projects in 2009 and
2010, including completing a distillate
hydrotreater conversion in Philadelphia.
Through 2008, Sunoco spent $140
million on the Philadelphia ultralowsulfur diesel project. It plans to spend a
further $70 million on it this year.
Some integrated operators have indicated they will reduce capital outlays
at their refineries this year, including
Marathon Corp., which announced
plans to spend almost 35% less at its
refineries than last year. Chevron Corp.
said it will reduce this year’s capital
outlays at refineries to $2 billion from

The MMS has two lease sales scheduled for this year. One sale for tracts in
the Central Gulf of Mexico took place
in March and attracted $703 million in
high bids. Another lease sale for tracts
in the Western Gulf of Mexico is scheduled on Aug. 19.
Based on declining investment and
the fact that fewer tracts will be offered
in the upcoming sale, OGJ estimates
that a total of $1.08 million will be
generated by the two 2009 lease sales.
Last year MMS conducted four lease
sales and received $6.883 million in

slow down some of its refining projects
due to economic conditions.

Pipelines, other spending
Expenditures are set to climb this
year for crude and products pipelines
and for gas pipelines in the US. Construction activity for pipelines, especially new gas systems like the Midcontinent Express Pipeline between Texas and
Alabama, will push spending up 44%
from last year.
OGJ’s most recent Worldwide Pipeline Construction report identified plans
for the construction of nearly 4,000
miles of gas pipelines and just over
3,000 miles of crude and products lines
in the US this year (OGJ, Feb. 9, 2009,
p. 52).
OGJ forecasts that spending on these
gas lines, including compressor stations,
will climb 64% this year to $10.37 billion. Spending for crude and products
lines in the US will total $5.16 billion,
up 17%.
With no major projects taking place
this year, capital spending at US petrochemical plants is forecast to plunge to
$50 million from $1 billion last year.
Also, a slowdown in LNG project
development will suppress spending for
import terminals in the US, while cost
reductions brought on by the economic
recession will drive down marketing
and corporate expenditures from last
year’s levels.

Spending in Canada

Marathon has announced that it will
cut its 2009 oil sands spending to $887
million from 2008 outlays of $1 billion. The company said the year-on-year
decrease reflects not only a stronger US
dollar but also the expectation that nonessential projects will be deferred.
As in the US, midstream and downstream spending in Canada will decline
as a whole by 27% from last year.
Construction of crude and products
pipelines will be the only growth area
in this category in 2009.
Refining spending is set to decline
25% to $1.5 billion (Can.). Petrochemical outlays will drop 95% to just $10
million (Can.).
Late last year, Petro-Canada announced that its 2009 capital budget
included about $560 million (Can.)
for its downstream business, with the
majority allocated for new growth
project funding. This was to be directed
toward the 25,000 b/d delayed coker
at the company’s Montreal refinery and
additional reliability items associated
with its Edmonton refinery conversion
project. These plans were made before
Petro-Canada’s agreement to merge
with Suncor Energy was finalized (OGJ
Online, Mar. 24, 2009).
In announcing the merger, PetroCanada and Suncor said they expect to
achieve annual operating expenditure
reductions of $300 million (Can.) from
efficiencies in overlapping operations,
streamlining business practices, and
improved logistics. They also expect to
achieve annual capital efficiencies of $1
billion (Can.) through the elimination
of redundant spending and targeting
capital budgets to high-return, nearterm projects.
With plans for about 500 miles of
construction, spending this year for
crude and products pipelines will climb
47%. But plans call for only about 34
miles of new gas pipelines in Canada,
dropping such spending to $28 million
(Can.) for the year.

Cost-cutting will affect capital spending for projects in Canada this year as
well. Oil sands development outlays will
plunge more than conventional E&P
spending, and the total of all other capital expenditures in Canada will drop
from last year.
Capital expenditures for conventional
oil and gas exploration, drilling, and
production in Canada will decline 8%
to $34.94 billion (Can.), following last
year’s 20% jump.
OGJ’s drilling forecast earlier this
year called for well completions to
fall to 16,360 from last year’s total
of 17,802. There were 14,856 well
completions in Canada in 2007, according to the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers (CAPP).
Oil sands capital spending, which
includes funds for in-situ extraction,
mining, and upgraders, will slump 25%
from a year ago to $15 billion (Can.).
CAPP reported that oil sands capital
expenditures totaled $18 billion (Can.)
in 2007, the latest year for which the
association has reported such data.
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.
reported that competition for resources
during 2005-08 drove up costs for
the first phase of its Horizon oil sands
project 43% above the original estimate.
Spending elsewhere
Global demand for workers, steel, and
Capital spending outside the US and
copper surged along with oil prices
Canada this year also will slow, though
during the project.

to a much less extent.
In Mexico, Pemex announced that
its 2009 capital budget includes a 15%
total increase. The plan calls for 84% of
the new nearly 186 billion peso budget
to be allocated for exploration and
production, and 12% is to be spent on
refining projects. The remainder is set
for petrochemicals and other expenditures.
Upstream spending outside North
America is forecast to decline 6% from
a year ago, according to the most recent
Barclays Capital Original E&P Spending
Survey, released Dec. 19, 2008.
The Barclays survey said Russian
companies, after several years of worldleading spending growth, are now

Lukoil has reported that its 2009
capital budget will fall 40% but also
said that a drop in costs and ruble
devaluation will leave its investment ef-

fectively unchanged from last year.
Meanwhile, some US-based companies have also released details of their
capital budget plans outside North
America.
ConocoPhillips reported that in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East,
its E&P capital program this year will be
about $5.1 billion.
This funding will go to coalbed
methane projects in Australia, the
continued development of both Bohai
Bay in China and Gumusut oil field off
Malaysia, Ekofisk oil field in the North
Sea, Shah gas field in Abu Dhabi, and
Kashagan oil field in the Caspian Sea,
among other projects, ConocoPhillips
said.
ConocoPhillips’s non-US refining
and marketing spending plan was $600
million, with a focus on projects related
to reliability, safety, and the environ-

ment, plus an upgrade project at its
Wilhelmshaven, Germany, refinery.
In November 2008, ConocoPhillips and Saudi Aramco halted until the
second quarter of this year the bidding
for construction of a 400,000 b/d

citing uncertainties in the financial and

Tahiti platforms go into operation. EIA
forecast a 0.3% drop in US gas production for the year.

Different paths
“Natural gas and oil are taking
different paths,” said Frederick Lawrence, vice-president of economics and
international affairs at the Independent
Petroleum Association of America. “Oil
prices have gone up since Jan. 1, but
natural gas has not,” he said on Apr.
16. “So if a company’s operations are
gas-directed, it’s going to be hit harder,
especially if it’s full of more-expensive
gas plays.”
Some producers may have become
victims of their own success with the
stunning growth of deep shale gas
production, Lawrence told OGJ. “It
improves the country’s energy security,
but its economics aren’t favorable for
producers right now,” he said. “Producers with marginal wells face similar
problems. Higher prices probably will
return with demand, but it’s not clear
when that will happen. They need to
keep operating in the meantime.”
Felmy noted that gas prices have
dropped sharply year-to-year. “The
slower economy depressed demand, but
there also was robust production last
year, which could set a record. Combine
that with strong inventories and gas
producers face depressed prices right
now,” he said. EIA noted that Henry
Hub spot prices began April below $4/
Mcf, adding that it expects them to stay
around that level until seasonal space
heating demand revives next fall.
Producers also are responding to
lower prices and demand by reducing
their activity. “Several capital budgets
have been revised downward after starting the year lower than they were in
2008,” said Lawrence. “It’s a combination of lower oil and gas prices and, for
smaller firms, much tighter credit,” said
Felmy.

That apparently led to workforce
reductions during the first quarter.
Although they represented only part of
the US oil and gas industry, the latest
US Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly
employment figures showed that there
were an estimated 167,600 domestic
oil and gas extraction jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis in March, down
0.2% from 167,900 in February and
1.1% from 169,400 in December 2008.
Producers face other forces beyond
operating costs and low commodity
prices, Lawrence said. “They realize that
a host of political and general economic
issues could affect them. We know that
for a lot of companies, the Obama tax
proposals could add a lot more pressure
on their bottom lines at a particularly
bad time,” he said.

this past quarter from 14.9 million b/d
in 2008’s first 3 months, according to
API’s monthly statistical report. Utilization fell somewhat year-to-year to
82.3% from 84.6% although operable
capacity rose 0.3% to 17.63 million
b/d from 17.59 million b/d.

Felmy said inventories looked good
at the end of the first quarter, “but we
still need to get through the switch
from the summer to winter blend. We’ll
have to monitor that on a week-to-week
basis. The report for May 1 will provide
the best indication.” ✦

working on a comprehensive solution
to global warming, and I am committed
to moving clean energy legislation this
year that will include perspectives from
across our nation to create jobs, increase
our national security and reduce global
warming,” she said.
House Minority Leader John A.
Boehner (R-Ohio) said EPA’s action “is
nothing more than a backdoor attempt
to enact a national energy tax that will
have a crushing impact on consumers,
jobs, and our economy. The administration is abusing the regulatory process to
establish this tax because it knows there
are not enough votes in Congress to
force Americans to pay it.”
Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.),
who chairs the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global
Warming, said EPA’s proposed finding
now puts pressure on Congress to solve
the problem. To that end, he said the
House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Energy and Environment Subcommittee, which he also chairs, would
start to hold hearings next week. He
said there would be nine panels with
80 witnesses.

‘Fundamentally ill-suited’
Oil and gas and other industry
groups expressed concern. “The proposed endangerment finding poses
an endangerment to the American
economy and to every American family.
It could lead to GHG greenhouse gas
regulations under a law fundamentally
ill-suited to addressing the challenge
of global climate change. The Clean Air
Act was created to address local and
regional air pollution, not the emission of carbon dioxide and other global
greenhouse gases,” American Petroleum
Institute Pres. Jack N. Gerard said.

overnment policymakers are
often criticized for making the
wrong decisions about energy. Voters’
erroneous beliefs may be part of the
problem, a new study suggests.
The study, “Energy and the
Environment: Myths & Facts,” was
released Apr. 20 as a US House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
prepared to hold 3 days’ of hearings
on cap-and-trade proposals later in
the week. Three days earlier, the US
Environmental Protection Agency said
in a proposed endangerment finding
that greenhouse gases threaten public
health (OGJ Online, Apr. 20, 2009).
“We think this is important because policymakers are moving fast
and furious. I don’t care what the ultimate policy conclusions are as long
as they base their actions on facts and
consider all of the consequences,”
Drew Thornley, who conducted the
study for the Manhattan Institute for
Policy Research (MIPR), told me on
Apr. 17.
“Prudent, sound public policies

curate views on energy issues.
For instance, 49% of the respondents said that Saudi Arabia exports the most oil to the US, while
only 13% identified Canada as this
country’s top foreign supplier. “This
is Myth No. 1. We kept it from the
2006 survey because we felt it was so
deeply entrenched,” Thornley said.
More than 67% said they believed
the US could meet higher future
energy demand through conservation
and efficiency, he continued. Sixtythree percent said human activity is
the greatest source of greenhouse
gases. And less than 28% correctly
believe that US air quality has improved since 1970.

Offshore drilling

The survey’s single bright spot
came when 64.4% of the respondents
said they favored expanded domestic
offshore oil drilling while 31.8%
opposed it. In a follow-up question,
more than 42% of those expressing
opposition said it was because the US
uses too much oil.
“I think folks are beginning to
realize that we literally sit on top of a

our dependence on foreign oil. We
just can’t get to a lot of it, but we will
go to cartels and ask them to increase

mitted comments to EPA in December
2008 questioning models the agency
used as well as its acknowledged lack of
ability to characterize climate change
effects on health and welfare, which
significantly complicates understanding
the net effects.
Choosing to regulate GHG emissions
under the Clean Air Act would constitute EPA’s single largest and potentially
most complex assertion of authority
over the US economy and individuals’
lifestyles, Drevna said. “Before moving
forward with regulation, the United
States must ensure that other major
global contributors are similarly committed to reducing their ambient greenhouse gas concentrations. US efforts
would be fore naught if the administration fails to receive such commitments,
and American economic competitiveness would be compromised,” he said.
A final endangerment finding would
trigger GHG regulation under the Clean
Air Act and preempt congressional debate on the issue, the National Association of Manufacturers warned. Using
outdated programs under the law to
regulate GHG emissions would burden
an ailing economy while doing little or
nothing to improve the environment,
NAM Pres. John Engler said. “The clean
air laws were designed to focus on local
pollutants. GHG emissions, however,
are global in nature and require a new
framework,” he said.
American Chemistry Council Pres.
Cal Dooley said as that group reviews
the proposed finding and prepares to
comment, it will focus on the proposal’s scope and any implications for GHG
regulation from stationary sources.
“We believe that the Clean Air Act is

T E R E S T
not well-suited to address greenhouse
gas emissions from stationary sources.
Given the national implications of carbon dioxide regulation by EPA and the
interdependent nature of climate and
energy issues, climate policy should be
discussed and developed in Congress in
tandem with energy policy,” he said.

‘No longer a question’
Environmental organizations cheered
EPA’s announcement. David Bookbinder,
climate counsel for the Sierra Club,
said, “Where the Bush administration
lagged, the Obama administration is
now leading. There is no longer a question of if or even when the US will act
on global warming. We are doing so
now. President Obama is taking it to the
hoop when it comes to our most pressing problems. This step will allow the
administration to move forward while
continuing to work with Congress to
pass a strong clean energy jobs and
climate plan.”
David Moulton, climate policy
director at the Wilderness Society, said,
“Now that EPA is no longer going
to ignore the law, the howls we are
hearing are from the same folks who
have been busy blocking legislation in
Congress to modify the law. One way or
the other, the clear and present danger
of endlessly dumping pollutants into
the atmosphere must be confronted. We
will either find a way to build a future
for our children based on clean energy
and sustainable jobs, or we will face a
very unsentimental foe: a climate that
makes life unsustainable.”
Matt Vespa, a senior attorney with
the Center for Biological Diversity, said,
“The Clean Air Act is our best tool for

reducing greenhouse emissions from
cars, ships and airplanes. For four
decades, [it] has protected the air we
breathe, saved thousands of lives and
produced economic benefits at least 42
times the cost of regulation. EPA should
immediately implement its effective and
efficient mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas pollution.”
Other groups were critical. Institute for Energy Research Pres. Thomas
J. Pyle, said, “Carbon is lighter than
oxygen, more abundant than nitrogen
and forms the basis of all human, plant
and animal life on earth. At least it did
yesterday. Today, it’s a danger to human
health and, upon meeting air, a clear
and present threat to our existence. That
was the pronouncement made by EPA,
and it will be one this generation and
others that follow will not soon forget.”
A coalition of eight free-market
groups told Jackson in an Apr. 15 letter
that an endangerment finding “will set
the stage for an economic train wreck
and a constitutional crisis.” The groups,
which include the Competitive Enterprise Institute, American Conservative
Union, and Americans for Tax Reform,
said it also “would lead to destructive
regulatory schemes that Congress never
authorized.” They said, “Significant uncertainty persists with regard to climate
sensitivity, the core scientific issue.”
The groups maintained, “Despite the
ongoing increase in air’s [carbon dioxide] content, various measures of public
welfare (life expectancy, heat-related
mortality, weather-related mortality,
air quality, agricultural productivity)
continue to improve. Endangerment of
public health and welfare is not ‘reasonably anticipated.’” ✦

Gasoline prices and margins earlier

be in for a tough time if crude prices
rally but products demand remains
weak,” the analyst said.
“This is a recipe for ongoing margin
weakness, and refiners are preparing
themselves for the big squeeze,” BMI
said.
The start-up of new refineries in Asia
and the Middle East will provide an
ill-timed boost to global capacity that
would lead to reduced plant utilization
rates if demand remains weak, BMI
noted.

Quick rebound unlikely
Lower fuel prices may stimulate demand in certain markets but the trend
towards higher fuels taxation and the
overhaul of subsidies in some developing countries mean that a near-term
rebound is far from certain.
In spite of some evidence that US
drivers are migrating back to less fuelefficient vehicles, the major shifts in

patterns of consumption resulting from
vehicle ownership changes are unlikely
to be reversed simply because pump
prices are temporarily lower.
The move in Europe away from gasoline and towards diesel is expected to
continue for a while, despite steep price
differentials. However, advances in small
gasoline engine technology may mean
these more economical units could end
the love affair with diesel.
Over the longer term, expansion
of the refining system is still needed,
particularly as market growth will likely
accelerate as the world pulls clear of
recession-depression. However, refining
margins are likely to be under pressure for many months. The downturn
in refining profitability, coupled with
weaker upstream economics and modest profits in fuels retailing, could cause
international oil companies (IOCs) and
national oil companies (NOCs) to reexamine investment plans.

Downstream capacity
The downstream oil market needs to
see continued high-level spending in
new crude distillation capacity, improved plant upgrading capability, and
better storage and distribution logistics,
BMI said.
Inevitably there will be reduced capital expenditure if industry earnings and
cash flow remain under pressure. This
can only result in the market tightening
once again as demand picks up—with
a return to extreme price volatility and
generally higher fuel prices.
The continued weakness of refined
product prices has played into the
hands of those countries wishing to
revise or abandon regulated systems.
Many are seizing the opportunity and
making sweeping changes that should
bring prices more closely in line with
the wider market.
This will have an appreciable impact
on demand patterns over the medium-

Al-Bashir’s back

A

nyone in the oil and gas industry who thought that Sudanese
President Omar Al-Bashir would soon
be out of the picture may want to
think again.
Last week, Al-Bashir underscored
his role in Sudan by announcing that
the country’s reserves stand at 150
million bbl and that its average production is 500,000 b/d.
At the opening session of the new
parliament, Al-Bashir said work has
been finalized in Nargath oil field,
which “will produce some 60,000
b/d” and that production in the Fula
basin will hit “more than 40,000
b/d.”
Not least, Al-Bashir—whose arrest
is sought by the International Criminal Court (ICC) over alleged abuse
in Sudan’s Western Darfur region—
spoke of a plan to upgrade the
100,000-b/d refinery at Khartoum.
Such statements don’t suggest

his plans to travel.
“We came to this meeting to show
those who said we could not travel
outside Sudan that we can travel
outside Sudan,” said Al-Bashir who,
in addition to Ethiopia, has visited
Egypt, Eritrea, Libya, Qatar, and Saudi
Arabia since the ICC issued its arrest
warrant on Mar. 4.

Nor has the arrest warrant slowed
plans by the Chinese to exploit Sudan’s oil to the fullest. In fact, China
National Petroleum Corp. recently announced that its Dalian Petrochemical
processed 40,000 tonnes of high-acid oil imported from Sudan in March.
In a bid to reduce production cost,
according to Chinese press reports,
Dalian successfully blended Sudan’s
“cheap, low-quality, acid crude” with
normal crude to “pave the way for
upcoming large-scale processing.”

difficult to assess at such an early stage.
In first-quarter 2009, BMI said the
global wholesale price for premium
unleaded gasoline was estimated at
$50.63/bbl.
This compares with $56.37/bbl in
fourth-quarter 2008 and, during the
two quarters, the price has ranged from
a monthly low of $40.38 in December
2008 to the February 2009 level of
$53.29/bbl.

Gasoline’s downward trend
Gasoline prices in this year’s
first quarter are down 50.4% from
$102.15/bbl in the equivalent period
of 2008. For the second quarter, BMI is
forecasting an average global gasoline
price of $55.78/bbl, which represents a
rise of 10.2% over the previous quarter,
but a year-on-year decline of more than
56% from the impressive $127.92/bbl
seen a year ago.
For the whole of 2009, the BMI
assumption for gasoline is an average
$56.89/bbl, with the price peaking at a
forecast monthly average of $64.75 in
December 2009. The overall year-onyear fall in 2009 gasoline prices is put
at 44.1%.
Gas oil in the first quarter of 2009
averaged $56.83/bbl, based on a composite global price. This represents a
year-on-year fall of 51% over first-quarter 2008, illustrating a slight relative
weakening of diesel vs. gasoline.
During the second quarter, BMI’s
revised forecast is for global gasoil at an
average $66.81, representing a quarteron-quarter increase of 17.6%, but a
56.4% year-on-year decline.

Jet price declines
For 2009, BMI’s forecast is for an
average jet fuel price of $69.35/bbl,
assuming a monthly high of $94.48/
bbl in December. The full-year outturn
represents a 42.8% fall from the 2008
level.
Jet prices averaged $58.93/bbl in
the first quarter of this year, using the
composite for New York, Singapore, and
Rotterdam. The annual decrease was

50.4%, with jet matching the decline in
gasoline prices.
The monthly low during the previous 6 months was $60.34/bbl in December 2008, with the price reaching
$61.83/bbl in January.
Volatility has been low in the jet fuel
market compared with gasoline and
diesel. In second quarter, BMI assumes
an average global jet price of $68.22/
bbl, which represents a rise of 15.8%
quarter to quarter and a year-on-year
fall of 56.4%.
For 2009, the monthly average price

T E R E S T
is forecast to range from $53.75/bbl in
February to $96.76/bbl in December,
proving an annual level of $71.78/bbl.
This compares with $124.95/bbl in
2008.
Naphtha was the weakest performer
in 2008 among the major refined
products, gaining 31% to $87.40/
bbl during 2008. In the first quarter,
naphtha averaged an estimated $42.91/
bbl, compared with $93.70/bbl in firstquarter 2008 and $38.37 in fourthquarter 2008.
The 2009 average naphtha price is

put by BMI at $46.40/bbl, down 47%
from the previous year’s level.
Looking further ahead, BMI sees
gasoline prices recovering to $63.45/
bbl in 2010, rising further to $71.11/
bbl in 2011 and stabilizing at around
$76.58/bbl from 2012.
Gas oil is expected to rebound to
$77.35 in 2010, reaching a plateau
of $93.35/bbl from 2012. The price
of jet is forecast to average $80.06/
bbl in 2010 and $89.72/bbl in 2011,
before leveling out at $96.62/bbl from
2012. ✦

Indonesia changes rules for oil, gas cost recovery
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
The Indonesian government, responding to criticism of current cost
recovery procedures in the oil and gas
industry, has drafted new rules that will
reduce national expenditure by redefining some cost components as downstream instead of upstream.
“We hope that this will decrease
spending on cost recovery in our
state budget,” Indonesia’s energy and
mineral resources minister Purnomo
Yusgiantoro said of the new rules.
Among other changes, natural gas
transmission pipelines and LNG export
terminals will be redefined as downstream components and no longer
deductible as upstream expenditures.
Officials said the changes will become part of new regulations that have
been drafted for the oil and gas industry, which are being held up pending
“synchronization” with other regulations, including taxation laws.
The country’s cost of recovery
mechanism formerly allowed oil and
gas contractors to reclaim expenses on
certain upstream activities from the
government after the start of production. The changes come in response to
critics who questioned the program’s
transparency and said it was prone to
abuse.

In 2008, the government paid oil
and gas contractors around $9.35 billion under the scheme, up $650 million
from the $8.7 billion paid out in 2007.
The government and Indonesia’s
House of Representatives have agreed
to cap cost recovery spending at $12
billion this year, largely by redefining
upstream costs as downstream.
In March, six domestic and international oil companies operating in Indonesia paid up to $167 million to the
country’s upstream watchdog BPMigas
to settle cost-recovery claims.
The funds were paid as part of
efforts by the country’s Corruption
Eradication Commission (KPK) to help
prevent the possible abuse of cost-

recovery claims and are being held
in one of Indonesia’s national banks
pending official inquiries. ConocoPhillips paid $104.17 million, while several
Indonesian firms paid the remainder:
state-owned Pertamina, $45.52 million;
Medco Energi, $10.89 million; Kondur
Petroleum, $5.21 million; and Kalrez
Petroleum and Kangean Energy Indoensia each less than $1 million.
At the time, officials said the KPK
would continue giving recommendations on upstream oil and gas management, including cost recovery, asset
management, and investment credits
in a bid to prevent abuse and potential
financial losses to the government. ✦

Global drilling spend to increase by 32% by 2013
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
The global drilling market is expected to pick up by 2013 with deepwater
rigs driving the growth, according to
data from Douglas-Westwood Ltd. and
Energyfiles.
Although there will be reduced
spending in 2009 and 2010 due to
the global recession that has reduced
oil demand, operators are expected to
increase spending on offshore drilling

by 32% from 2009-13 compared with
2004-08.
Report author Michael R. Smith of
Energyfiles said, “Shallow water exploratory drilling levels are not expected to
ever return to their most recent 2007
peak but growth in deepwater drilling
has supported exploratory drilling over
the last 5 years—to reach 40% of all
exploratory wells by 2013. The steady
growth is a result of new ultra deepwater targets becoming increasingly
viable, as the capability of deepwater

In 2004-08, $278 billion was spent
on offshore global drilling. By 2013 this
is forecast to increase to $367 billion.
According to the report, operators
will see the number of wells being
drilled around the world rise by 7%
in 2009-13, despite a sharp decline in
2009 with Asia leading the trend followed by North American and Western
Europe. About 19,570 wells are expected to be drilled by 2013. The data

India seeks bids in eighth NELP licensing round
India has invited operators to bid
for 70 exploration blocks covering
163,535 sq km under its eighth New
Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP 8)
round.
India has 24 deepwater blocks, 28
shallow-water blocks, and 18 onshore
blocks on offer. Of the 24 deepwater
blocks, 18 are off western Andaman, an
area that is available for the first time.
Deepwater blocks also are available in
the Mumbai and Kerala-Konkan basins
off the west coast.
For the oil and gas blocks, operators
will have a 7-year exploration period
and are to complete their minimum
work program within 4 years.
Onshore acreage blocks are in the
northeastern states of Assam (2 blocks)
and Manipur (2), the eastern state of
West Bengal (2), the central state of
Madhya Pradesh (3), the western state
of Gujarat (8), and the northern state of
Haryana (1).
For coalbed methane acreage (CBM
IV), the government has offered 10
blocks covering 5,000 sq km. These are
in Assam (1 block), partly in Chhattisgarh and partly in Madhya Pradesh (1),
Jharkhand (1), Madhya Pradesh (2),
Maharashtra (2), Orissa (2), and Tamil
Nadu (1).
Bidding for both CBM IV and NELP
8 will end on Aug. 10, with productionsharing contracts to be signed within 4
months.
However operators are worried over
the lack of clarity on tax issues as the
finance ministry has stopped a 7-year
tax holiday for gas production from
40

blocks awarded under NELP. According
to reports from India, officials from the
petroleum ministry are in discussions
with the finance ministry to work out
a solution as oil and gas should have a
level playing field.
Oil Secretary RS Pandey said it was
better to proceed with the licensing
round amid the global economic slowdown to generate activity. He added,
however, that if there were little interest, India may hold onto the blocks. If
there is sufficient interest, another 3040 blocks would be offered in the next
phase, he said.
“This is the best time to get exploration assets,” said VK Sibal, India’s
upstream regulator. “It will be available
more easily. So, I think medium-toaggressive bidding [will be] there.”
India, however, has only offered one
block in the Krishna Godavari basin off
India’s east coast, where Reliance Industries discovered large gas reserves 61⁄2
years ago. Production started last week
from the Dhirubhai 1 and 3 discoveries
in the Bay of Bengal.

critical thickness, the productivity will
not increase as reservoir thickness increases but will remain stable as thickness increases.
In addition, initial gas production

tion. The study combines the equivalent
radius model and function of pseudopressure to take into effect diffusivity
and compressibility.
To solve the equations, the study
uses a finite difference method, after
which it establishes partial differential
equations and definite conditions that
describe the mechanism of coal gas and
water flow.

Objectives

At present, most coalbed methane
reservoir developments in China use
fractured vertical wells and herringbone
horizontal wells.
The cost of a fractured vertical well
is low but these wells have a limited
drainage area. The drainage area of
herringbone horizontal wells is greater
in comparison, but the wells have an
initial higher cost.
Although common for developing hydrocarbon reservoirs, horizontal
wells are much less common for CBM
reservoirs.
The CBM reservoirs in China always
have a low permeability, less than 1

is less than in other countries.2 These

• Validate the existence of critical

The characteristics of coalbeds in
China are the basis for the study’s geologic model. To develop the transport
equations for the water and gas phases,
the study uses assumptions such as:
• The coalbed is a double-porosity
medium composed of matrix and
fractures.
• The coalbed is compressible, heterogenic, and anisotropic.
• Water initially saturates the fractures with no free gas or dissolved gas
within. Gas is adsorbed in the matrix
pores that contain no water.
• Gas flow in fractures includes diffusivity and compressibility, in which
diffusion is in the pseudosteady-state
regime.
• The study considers the effects of
gravity and capillary pressure.
• Flow is isothermal.
• Methane is a real gas. Water is a

Mathematical model
Three steps describe the flow of
methane in the reservoir: desorption,
diffusion, and filtration.3 As a result
of the specific property of storage and
transport, the study incorporates synthetically the model of adsorption-desorption, the model of matrix diffusion,
and the model of Darcy filtration.
This study also incorporates gas and
water flow in the matrix, fractures, and
well. The Langmuir equation characterizes the gas adsorbing concentration in
the micropores of the coal matrix and
the exchange capacity between ad44

sorbed gas on the matrix face and free
gas in the fractures.4
The gas flow velocity in fractures
consists of the diffusion velocity and
Darcy velocity. The pseudosteady-state
diffusion equation reflects the character of diffusion.5 Recent mathematical
models have ignored the compressibility influence. As a result, the deliverability equation for a gas well is not
different from the equation for liquid,
which is inconsistent with the actual
conditions.
We have derived a real-gas deliverability equation for radial fluid flow by
taking into account a pseudopressure
function6 and equivalent radius model.
The accompanying equation box shows
the models.

Equation 8 has four unknowns: pg,
pw, Sg, and Sw. Only two are independent variables and one can express the
others as functions of the independent
ones. We selected gas pressure pg and
water saturation Sw as the independent
variables.
To solve the equations easily, we
solved for the real parameters in the iterative step k+1 not with pgk+1 and Swk+1
but with the increment δ‒pg and δ‒ Sw.
One should pay attention to the grids
that locate the well because one must
transform the pressure into real-gas
pseudopressure to calculate productivity.
In addition, one can evaluate the
productivity by introducing an equivalent radius model if the reservoir along
the horizontal well is heterogeneous.
We treat the components on the left
of the partial differential equations for
gas and water as dimensional difference
with block-centered grid and treat the
components on the right as time difference.
After the set of difference equations describing the gas and water flow
through coalbed is established, we treat
the Darcy term, desorption term, diffusion term, and well productivity term
implicitly. Then we obtain the nonlinear
fully implicit model of gas and water
flow through coalbed with Equations
9-11.
We adopted the Newton-Raphson
algorithm to linearize the nonlinear
equations. The matrix of coefficients is
a seven diagonal, blocky, and banded
sparse. Each block is a submatrix of two
series. We can transform the equations
into seven diagonals after we set initial
bottomhole pressure. Then we can solve
the model with an orthomin algorithm.

Table 1 summarizes the physical
properties of the coals used in the study.
The parameters are from No. 3 coalbed
Jinshi 1 well in Fanzhuang block of the
Qinshui basin.
Table 2 summarizes the gas well and
fluid characteristics. The study changed
the coalbed thickness to determine its
influence on gas production.
Fig. 1 indicates that peak production rate decreases as thickness
increases; however, thicker reservoirs
have longer flow periods. Production
from the 3-m thick coalbed would
still be 1,365 cu m/day after 3,000
days, while production from the 1-m
thick bed would be less than 1,000 cu
m/day after 1,000 days.
As expected with thinner coals, the
reservoir will dewater more effectively,
thereby lowering fracture pressure
sooner. This results in a higher initial
gas production as well as the peak gas
production rate occurring sooner than
in a thicker coalbed. The deep drop in
reservoir pressure, however, will cause
the thinner bed to suffer more from the
crustal stress that lowers the permeability, and therefore the production rate
will decline quickly after the peak gas
rate.
In thicker reservoirs it is different
because the effect of matrix shrinkage
will dominate as the pressure drops,
thereby enhancing the permeability.8
As a result, the production rate will stay
higher after the peak gas rate.
Fig. 2 shows simulated production
profiles for reservoir thicknesses greater
than 4 m. The figure indicates that as
reservoir thickness increases, the peak
gas rate increases, the time of peak
gas rate is delayed, and the production
period lengthens.
The production difference of the
two thicknesses, however, becomes
nearly the same as the well continues to
produce after the peak. The thinner coal
beds have less of a difference.

FCCU and emissions
The FCCU is typically the largest
emitter of airborne emissions in a crude
oil refinery. The FCCU’s flue-gas stack
emissions contain several environmental pollutants, including CO, nitrogen
oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and
particulates. In the US, beginning in
the 1990s with the amendment of the
Clean Air Act and subsequent consentdecree agreements, refiners have been
required by the EPA to minimize emissions of these compounds.
In Europe, several European Unionwide directives target reductions in
emissions of these compounds from the
FCC flue-gas stack. In other countries,
especially industrialized ones, limits
have been placed on flue-gas emissions
to minimize these pollutants, which are
normally contained in the uncontrolled
emission streams.
Several papers detail the terms of the
US consent decrees and the European

directives.1-4 Other papers have outlined
the complex chemistry of the numerous competing reactions that occur in
the FCC regenerator and described the
technical challenges of minimizing
these environmental pollutants while
maintaining an economically profitable
refining operation.5

To meet objectives of
a 2001 consent decree
with the US Environmental Protection Agency,
Marathon Petroleum
Refining
Co. LLC, a subsidiary of
Marathon Oil Co., agreed
to decrease NOx emissions from each
of its fluid catalytic cracking units at
seven midwestern US refineries.
In satisfying this agreement, Marathon employed a new, second-generation non-platinum combustion promoter, COP-NP, developed by Intercat Inc.,
Manasquan, NJ. This article describes a
series of successful trials of COP-NP in
Marathon’s FCCUs and gives relevant
side-by-side test results of COP-NP with
competitor additives.
Since signing its consent decree,
Marathon has worked closely with EPA
and other US refiners under similar
decrees to ensure the objectives are met
reliably and cost-effectively. In keeping with the spirit of these agreements,
Marathon has consistently pushed technology boundaries by being among the
first to implement many new emissioncontrol technologies.

FCC heatbalance control
The FCC unit operates
in heat balance, meaning
that the total energy coming into the FCC must
equal the energy going
out. The primary source
of energy in the FCC unit
is coke that forms on the
catalyst surface. Combustion of coke in the FCC
regenerator supplies the
energy to run the cracking process.
Total unit heat duty
will typically be in the
range of 500 to 1,000
btu/lb of feed to the unit. This process heat requirement establishes the
amount of heat that must be supplied
by combustion of coke. Because of

the process control schemes that are
normally employed in FCC, the unit
operation will automatically adjust itself
so that the energy produced via coke
combustion equals the heat requirements of the process.
If the balance is shifted by changes
to the feed quality or operating conditions, shifts in catalyst circulation rate
and regenerator temperature will occur
until a new equilibrium set of conditions is established.
The combustion of coke is considered to be a first-order reaction. Operating temperature is a prime variable in
setting the coke combustion rates. Since
the kinetics are first order, increasing or decreasing the temperature by
about 30° F. will double or halve the
combustion rate. This can be significant
when the coke or air distribution in the
regenerator is less than ideal.
The combustion of coke proceeds
via carbon oxidation to CO and then
CO combustion to CO2. The activation
energy for CO combustion is considerably higher than for carbon combustion, so that CO combustion is usually
the rate-limiting step in the process. At
temperatures less than 1,250° F., the
thermally driven reaction rate of CO to
CO2 is very slow.
To help speed up the process, CO
combustion promoter is added to the
unit to increase the CO combustion
rate. Because the heat release from CO
combustion is about three times greater
than the heat release from carbon to
CO, it is important that this combustion
occur in the dense bed of catalyst.
Without the catalyst bed to absorb
this heat of combustion, the flue-gas
temperature increases very rapidly—a
phenomenon called “afterburning”—
and represents an energy loss from the
regenerator and a decrease in the overall
thermal efficiency of the regenerator.
Use of promoter causes the CO
to burn in the catalyst bed so that
afterburning is controlled to acceptable levels. The benefits of this control
include extending the mechanical life
of downstream equipment, lower carbon on regenerated catalyst, improved

utilization of air, and decreased catalyst
deactivation.
In a typical fluid-bed regenerator,
the dense-phase catalyst particles are
well mixed by fluidization. Air entering
the bottom moves in plug flow up the
regenerator. As the combustion reactions progress to remove coke from the
catalyst, oxygen is consumed and the
combustion products (CO and CO2)
change in concentration along the
regenerator axis.
Changes in O2 and CO concentration
are of particular interest because NO
and NO2 are reduced in the presence
of CO. The magnitude of change is expected to be different with different regenerator configurations and cocurrent
vs. counter-current flow. In addition to
regenerator configuration and mode of
operation (partial vs. complete combustion), these compositions will also
change with the flue CO/CO2 ratio (in
partial combustion), excess oxygen (in
complete combustion), feed type, and
other parameters that affect the coke on
the catalyst.
Fig. 1 depicts the expected concentration profiles for CO and O2 with
regenerator elevation in a well mixed
bed, with data from the Marathon FCC
pilot plant.
An increase in excess oxygen would
result in less reduction potential in the
reducing zone. The relative concentrations of CO and O2 largely dictate the
emission chemistry. Thus, the above
profile underscores that the emissions
cannot be readily assessed from changes
in oxygen concentration at the entrance
(air grid) or exit (excess O2 in flue) of
the regenerator. Rather, it is important
to understand the axial variations and
their impact on emissions. Industry
experience has shown emissions chemistry in particular will be affected by
specific unit designs and bed hydrodynamics.

between the various chemical species.
Ultimately, all of the combustion chemistry revolves around the competition
for and the availability of oxygen in the
regenerator.
It has been shown that catalysts,
additives, or process conditions that
reduce one undesirable flue-gas component can inadvertently lead to an
increase in emissions of another. An
especially good example of one of the
interactions that occurs in the regeneraEffects of promoters

in NOx emissions from the FCCU.6 It
is important to be aware that when
attempting to minimize emissions of
these undesired chemical species in the
flue gas, care must be taken in design
and use of different emissions-control
technologies. Otherwise unintended
consequences and undesirable results
could occur.
For nearly 35 years, the preferred
method of controlling afterburn and
CO emissions has been use of a platinum-containing combustion promoter
to catalyze the oxidation of CO to CO2
in the regenerator dense bed. Histori-

cally these combustion promoters have
contained low concentrations of highly
dispersed platinum (Pt) on an inert
alumina support.
Pt is an excellent combustion promoter that, unlike many other oxidation
catalysts, can be used in low enough
concentrations to catalyze CO oxidation without also catalyzing undesirable
dehydrogenation reactions in the FCC
reactor. It has been discovered, however,
that while Pt is an effective oxidation
catalyst for conversion of CO to CO2, it
also catalyzes the oxidation of nitrogen
intermediate species (e.g., ammonia,
NH3; and hydrogen cyanide, HCN)
found in the regenerator. This results
in increased NOx emissions and runs
counter to the desire to minimize all of
these environmental pollutant emissions.
In recent years, a shift has occurred
away from Pt-containing CO combustion promoters to promoters containing
elements other than Pt. The desire is to
50

use elements that are still effective in
oxidizing CO to CO2 and preventing
afterburn, but which do not generate NOx in the process. Many of the
currently available non-Pt combustion
promoters have substituted palladium
(Pd) for Pt as one active component.
Commercial performance results,
however, show that the performance of
these materials varies widely and that
additives available from different suppliers are not all equivalent.

control as with a Pt promoter.
Intercat took a different approach
in developing its non-Pt combustion promoter, COP-NP. The company
completely redesigned the new non-Pt
combustion promoter, incorporating modifications to the base support
as well as to the catalytically active
components. This approach produced
a far more active, stable, and selective
combustion promoter than others on
the market.
In developing COP-NP, Intercat
recognized that the effectiveness of a
CO promoter in the FCCU depends on
several physical and chemical factors.
The support must be a highly attritionresistant material, have a high particle
density, and have a minimum amount
of particles smaller than 40μ. These
properties are necessary to minimize
first-cycle losses of the promoter and
promote high retention in the unit’s
inventory.
The support should also have a
moderately high surface area and a high
pore volume to provide ready access of
the reactants to the catalytically active
sites. The catalytically active components
must be uniformly dispersed on the
support for maximum effectiveness. The
chemical composition of the additive
should not be easily poisoned by other
components in the FCCU, nor should it
generate undesirable side reactions.
All of these requirements were
achieved in development of COP-NP by
use of Intercat’s proprietary formulation
and manufacturing techniques.

several times higher additive additions
than was desirable.
Following the demonstration period
and having agreed with EPA on final
flue-gas emissions limits, Marathon began searching for a second-generation
non-Pt combustion promoter, one with
better promotion activity and at least
equivalent NOx reduction capability. By
this time, performance results of COPNP at non-Marathon refineries were
just becoming available, some of which
appear in Table 1.
In these unit trials, conducted at
different US refineries, COP-NP proved
itself effective in controlling afterburn
and CO emissions while at the same
time producing much less NOx than
Pt-containing combustion promoters. These trials determined that CO
combustion promotion activity and
afterburn reduction capability of COPNP was roughly equivalent to that of
Intercat’s COP-375, a 375-ppm Pt-containing promoter. NOx generation by
COP-NP, however, was far less than with
the Pt-containing promoter.
Marathon agreed to conduct competitive trials at multiple sites to evaluate various non-Pt promoters, selecting
three different vendors for these trials.
Based upon the successful results at
several other refineries, Marathon first
started using COP-NP at its Garyville,
La., refinery FCCU in late 2006. After
analyzing the data from multiple trials
with multiple vendors, Marathon decided to extend use of COP-NP to three
additional units. Table 2 shows results
from these trials.
The changeover to COP-NP at each
location did not pass without incident, however. When Marathon first
began using COP-NP, the unusually
high promotion activity of this additive compared with competitive non-Pt
promoters was not well understood.
COP-NP was initially added at the same
rate as Vendor X’s product, the previous
non-Pt promoter. This resulted in a large
increase in promotion activity in the
unit and initially led to a small increase
in NOx emissions. Fig. 2a shows this
difference between the two additives

in effectiveness on NOx emissions and
afterburn control at constant addition
rates.
As soon as it was realized that COPNP was significantly more active than
Vendor X’s product, the addition rate of
COP-NP was gradually reduced. Additions were finally reduced to less than
half the rate required for use of Vendor
X’s product.
Even at this lower addition rate,
afterburn decreased by 48% and CO
emissions decreased by 47%. Fig. 2b
shows that at a constant degree of afterburn, the NOx emissions with COP-NP
were the same as with the previous
additive.

Fig. 2c shows an additional benefit of
COP-NP use at the Garyville refinery. It
was found that CO emissions could be
controlled at much lower excess oxygen
levels (~0.7%) with COP-NP compared
with the about 1.5% level previously
required. This was of major operational
benefit to the FCC in that it relaxed the
constraint on the main air blower.
In terms of economic value added,
the lower addition rate required with
COP-NP resulted in a large reduction
in operating expenses. This combined
with benefits of the reduced air blower
rate and the possibility of being able to
increase feed rate as a result provided
unanticipated economic benefits and

than the current average. In the worst
case scenario, only 124 billion cu m/
year of Russian gas will be available to
Europe, 18 billion cu m/year less than
the current average.
For simplicity, these estimates assumed exports to the FSU and non-EU
Europe would stay at current levels
and Russia would not further diversify
its pipeline and LNG export options
beyond Sakhalin, Shtokman, and a
pipeline to China. Any increase in these
alternatives would further reduce the
amount of gas available to the EU.
Predictions call for EU demand to increase roughly 20% by 2020 to 688 billion cu m/year according to a EuroGas
study,2 while indigenous production
falls to 198 billion cu m/year (Table 2).
The study projects a deficit of 151 billion cu m/year after domestic production and planned imports.
The same study projects an increase
in EU dependence on suppliers outside
Europe to 68% in 2020 from 41% in
2005. Gazprom’s share of EU gas imports could be reduced to 35% in 2020
from 51% in 2006, under the most
conservative case, and to 25% the least
conservative case.
According to the EuroGas study, 151
billion cu m/year of the needed 490
billion cu m/year of imports projected
in 2020 were not under long-term
agreements yet. Plausible options for
closing this shortfall include increasing pipeline supply from North Africa,
increasing LNG imports, signing new
contracts with Gazprom (and helping
with whatever infrastructure development might be necessary), or developing non-Gazprom supply routes from

54

the east, such as Nabucco.

Transportation routes
In its effort to diversify supply
sources, Europe has studied various
alternatives, including expanded LNG
receipt capacity and increased storage capacity (so that more natural gas,
particularly LNG could be stored for
winter months). The Nabucco pipeline
is another studied alternative. Although
the economics of the project are difficult, the recent shutoff of supplies by
Gazprom has reinvigorated the political
desire to complete this pipeline.
Nabucco is supposed to deliver 31
billion cu m/year of natural gas from
the Caspian region, potentially including Iraq and Iran, to Central Europe via
Turkey. Several potential problems, however, continue to surround the project.
Not only would the Nabucco
partners compete for supply against
Gazprom, China National Petroleum
Corp. (CNPC) and quite possibly India’s
Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC),
Nabucco’s value to Caspian producers has also been diminished by recent
long-term contracts between Gazprom
and Central Asian producers based on
netback pricing formulas.
The chances of filling Nabucco
with gas from Iran as an alternative are
limited. It remains politically difficult to
conduct long-term business with Iran.
The country also seems to lack not only
sufficient supply but also the necessary
upstream and transportation investment
to make connection to Nabucco viable.
Gazprom supports two other alternative pipelines: South Stream under the
Black Sea and Nord Stream through
the Baltic. Gazprom anticipates these

routes will protect it, and presumably European customers, from unauthorized withdrawal of gas by transit
countries such as Belarus and Ukraine
and delayed payments. Gazprom is also
using these pipelines (especially South
Stream) to preempt Nabucco or other
pipelines that would bring Caspian supplies to Europe.
The onshore portion of Nord Stream
is under construction in Russia, but the
project faces resistance from some EU
members. Germany and Sweden raised
ecological concerns regarding the project. Poland and the Baltic states, meanwhile, have voiced their preference for
an onshore pipeline instead.

Russian supply
Even if the Nord Stream, South
Stream, and the other routes are built,
can Gazprom fill Europe’s import gap?
The only two projects currently
under way are Sakhalin and Shtokman,
targeting Pacific and Atlantic markets,
respectively. In the Atlantic Basin, natural target markets for Shtokman LNG
include the Iberian Peninsula in Europe,
virtually disconnected from the broader
European natural gas network, and
LNG regasification terminals on North
America’s East Coast.
Gazprom affiliate Gazprom Marketing & Trading (GMT) has already
signed a preliminary memorandum of
understanding with Spain’s Gas Natural for LNG deliveries, expected to be
executed at first on a swap basis similar
to previous deliveries to the US, Japan,
and Korea.
In North America, Gazprom has secured sales to the Rabaska LNG terminal
in Canada. The North American LNG
market, however, has so far been lower
priced than those in Europe and Asia.
Uncertainty has also grown regarding the medium-term supply-demand
balance in the US and Canada. Unconventional gas plays in the region have
proven to be economically feasible, if
sensitive to lower price decks, and their
share of supply was growing rapidly
until the recent drop in prices. Produc-

tion of marketed natural gas in the US
in December 2008 was at its highest in
the past 24 years.
Changing supply-demand conditions
are probably the main reason developers of another regasification terminal in
Canada, Kitimat LNG, announced plans
instead to build a liquefaction plant targeting Asian markets. At the same time,
a joint venture between Teekay Corp.
and Merrill Lynch Commodities Inc.
wants to convert an LNG carrier into a
500,000 tonnes/year floating liquefaction plant near Kitimat by 2012.
Decreasing global energy consumption and the consequent drop in oil and
gas prices led to dramatic changes in
Gazprom’s development and production
plans. Gazprom officials have already
discussed a production cut of as much
as 7% in 2009. The company’s January
2009 production decreased 13.7% yearon-year, mostly due to reduced exports
through Ukraine, but also because of
reduced natural gas demand in Europe.
Domestic consumption, typically
about 65% of Gazprom’s sales (see
accompanying figure above), is also
rapidly declining, following a dramatic
drop in industrial production. Power
generation, which accounts for roughly
40% of domestic gas consumption,
slipped 7.3% year-to-year in January
2009. Export-oriented industries, the
major natural gas industrial consumers, proved even more vulnerable to
deteriorating market conditions. The
chemical industry experienced a 74.1%
dive between November 2008 and November 2007, while metallurgy was off
86.7%, wood processing 81.4%, and
pulp and paper 85%.3
Gazprom’s storage is practically full
due to continuous low demand in both
domestic and international markets. The
lack of storage capacity deprived the
company of any production flexibility and caused production to decline
further. Even some of the independents,
which can only export through Gazprom, started reducing their production.
Reduced demand by both domestic
and international customers, however,

should be a short-term phenomenon,
with demand picking up relatively
quickly, albeit at a slower pace. In the
long run, independents should provide
a level of comfort to both Gazprom and
its customers, including Europe.
Independent Russian companies
increased production in 2008 by 8.9%,
to 113.5 billion cu m/year. They are
continuing to invest, albeit at reduced
rates given current economic conditions. In the future, they may provide
a hedge against the risk Central Asian
supplies may move away from Gazprom, eastward to China, for example.
Gazprom has long-term contracts with
most domestic independent suppliers
but had to renegotiate contracts with
Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan multiple times.

Financial position
Lower natural gas prices will take
a toll on Gazprom in 2009 and, due
to the structure of export contracts,
restrict its 2010 finances as well. The
announced liberalization of domestic
prices, however, will likely go on as
planned, providing a counter to falling
export revenues. Natural gas tariffs for

nonresidential customers increased 25%
in 2008 and a further 15% in 2009
(reduced from an initially planned
28% hike). Despite the price increase,
domestic demand should not fall to
levels sufficient to erase the tariff gains
in Gazprom revenues.
It is also likely that lower demand
will slow development of capital-intensive projects such as Bovanenkovskoye
and Kharasavey fields in Yamal. These
natural gas fields stand as the major
resource to replace falling production
at the mature Yamburg, Urengoy, and
Zapolyarnoye fields.
Gazprom invested about $2 billion
in Bovanenkovskoye and Kharasavey
fields in 2008, in addition to another
$1 billion in infrastructure in the Yamal
peninsula. About a third of the investments were in non-Yamal exploration
and production activities, and another
third on transportation and storage
facilities outside Yamal. Current Yamal
investments remain at roughly $5.5
billion for the time being but will likely
be reduced.
Gazprom’s total 2009 investment
plans have already been reduced by
10%, to about $27 billion, two thirds of
which is capital expenditures. The final

effect of these new budget numbers on
major projects remains unclear. Part of
the 10% decrease in dollar terms can
be explained by the large devaluation
of the ruble in recent months. But at
the same time, materials and services
for infrastructure projects have become
cheaper.
The combination of low energy
prices and shrinking sales revenues,
however, could greatly affect Gazprom
over the next 2 years. With prices for
Urals at $35-45/bbl, Gazprom will have
to increase borrowing from the $2.5
billion budgeted for 2009 to continue
its investment program. Company officials have already visited Asian and
Middle Eastern financial centers seeking
funds.
Gazprom’s reaction to increased
excitement about Nabucco has been
to emphasize South Stream and Nord
Stream, but these are extremely capital
intensive projects. Gazprom recently
estimated South Stream’s cost as high
as $32.5 billion, while North Stream
would cost as much as $11.6 billion,
including $2.6 billion in 2009. South
Stream can be effective for the time being simply as a counter to Nabucco, but
Nord Stream construction has started
and needs continuous funding.
Gazprom may have no choice but to
ask the Russian government for support. But the government’s ability to
do so may be limited. The latest (Jan.
19, 2009) official budget forecast for
2009 stipulates an average Urals price
of $41/bbl, an exchange rate of 35.1
rubles/$, and a 6-8% federal budget
deficit in 2009 followed by 4-5% deficits in 2010 and 2011. These deficits
would be covered by reserve funds, but
would likely drain them by 2012.4 ✦

EIA use of JODI
data a step for
oil transparency
An international effort to improve transparency of oil and gas markets advanced a
step this month.
The International Energy Agency added
to its April Oil Market Report discrete demand assessments for 14 countries based
on data from the Joint Oil Data Initiative
(JODI). IEA is one of six international
organizations that launched JODI in 2000 in
response to concerns about rising volatility

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e

of oil markets and prices. The other groups
are Asia Paciﬁc Energy Cooperation (APEC),
the Statistical Ofﬁce of the European Communities (Eurostat), Latin American Energy
Organization (OLADE), Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, and United
Nations Statistical Division.
JODI seeks monthly oil statistics from
the 92 countries represented by those
groups. The International Energy Forum
Secretariat (IEFS) in Riyadh, which coordinates the work, opened the JODI database
to public access in November 2005.
The data categories are production, closing stocks, stock changes, demand, reﬁnery
intake, and reﬁnery output. The numbers
cover crude oil, LPG, gasoline, kerosene,
gas/diesel oil, heavy fuel, and total oil.
When JODI began, information like this
wasn’t routinely available on a monthly
basis in all countries. Data quality was and
remains anything but uniform.
IEFS applies a combination of training
and persuasion to improve the product. It
grades countries on reporting timeliness
and data quality—and publishes the results.
Last December, JODI reported that for
the ﬁrst time more than 70 participating
countries and economies were supplying
monthly data, covering about 95% of world
crude oil production in 2008 and 85% of
global demand.
This month, acknowledging JODI’s
“tangible improvements,” IEA began using numbers from the database to report
demand for Algeria, Libya, Nigeria, Hong
Kong, Philippines, Estonia, Chile, Colombia,
Peru, Kuwait, Qatar, Yemen, Bulgaria, and
Romania. IEA’s adoption of JODI demand
numbers represents progress in the effort
to improve statistical assessment of the
far-ﬂung, ever-changing, and economically
crucial oil market. And the progress itself is
evidence of cooperation between producing and consuming countries. The world
needs more of that. It also needs JODI to
expand its coverage to natural gas and—
this will be the ultimate achievement—
reserves, consistently deﬁned.

Tight April crude prices
For 5 consecutive weeks through Apr. 17, the front-month contract for benchmark
US light, sweet crudes ﬁnished each week “almost unchanged” from the close of
the previous week within a narrow price range above $50/bbl, said Olivier Jakob at
Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland.
During the ﬁrst months of 2009, crude prices increased 12%, trading in a tight
range of $48-54/bbl through most of April, with the soon-to-expire May contract
for benchmark US light, sweet crudes closing at $50.33/bbl Apr. 17, while the June
contract ﬁnished at $52.47/bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Jakob said,
“Stronger equities are providing support to crude oil, but the commodity is starting
to feel fatigued, pivoting around $50/bbl without any momentum.”
At KBC Market Services, a division of KBC Process Technology Ltd. in Surrey, UK,
analysts reported Apr. 20, “We remain conﬁdent that, although the US oil demand
picture remains disappointing, as long as there is no signiﬁcant deterioration [in
demand] and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries maintains production discipline oil prices will move gently upwards.” They expect prices possibly to
average $55/bbl in the second quarter, $60/bbl in the third quarter and $65/bbl in the
last quarter of this year.”
Meanwhile, they noted, “Once again [North Sea] Brent is lording it over WTI with
a $3/bbl premium that has been gradually increasing for just over a week.”
In mid-April, the Energy Information Administration reported imports of crude
into the US inched up 59,000 b/d to 9.4 million b/d in the week ended Apr. 10. Input
of crude into US reﬁneries dropped 300,000 b/d to 14 million b/d, however, with
units operating at 80.4% of capacity.
Although OPEC has curbed production, Jakob said, “The main US market is
receiving more crude oil, not less, than last year.” On the 4-week average through
Apr. 10, crude imports into the US Gulf Coast were 500,000 b/d higher than a year
ago, “despite the fact that OPEC production is supposed to have been 3.2 million b/d
lower than a year ago in the ﬁrst quarter,” he said.
As of Apr. 10, commercial crude in storage on the US Gulf Coast was within 7 million bbl of a record high. With oil arriving steadily, reﬁners will need to push barrels
up the pipeline to Cushing, Okla., to make room for more imports, Jakob said.
Pritchard Capital Partners analysts said, “Markets continue to ignore bearish
fundamentals and appear to be taking cues from other factors like inﬂation fears,
the weak dollar, or stock market strength.” The oil market was supported in mid-April
by an improvement in the US jobless rate, “indicating the pace of economic decline
may be slowing,” Pritchard Capital Partners said.
Repsol YPF said Apr. 15 it temporarily was shutting down its 100,000 b/d reﬁnery in Cartagena, Spain, due to poor demand and margins. Jakob noted, “The US
has been relying on Europe as an export pool and will probably need to shut more
reﬁnery units to clear the Atlantic Basin product overhang; that will in turn weigh on
crude oil.”
Natural gas outlook
Dissipating demand for natural gas indicates a strong injection season in an
already oversupplied market, possibly reaching record levels by the end of summer,
said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. in early
April.
In New Orleans, analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC expect lower-priced
natural gas to take market share from coal in the power generation sector over the
next 2 quarters as reﬁning and chemical sector demand “begins a gradual upturn.”
However, they said, “The strong dollar (14% above a year ago) will likely lure
incremental LNG imports in the spring and summer with imports rising from 1 bcfd
to 1.7 bcfd by July. This will offset declining Canadian imports. Even adjusting for as
much as 2 bcfd of switching from coal to gas in the power generation sector, industry will need to shut in as much as 1 bcfd” by Oct. 1.
Pritchard Capital Partners expect the rapidly falling North American rig count
“will lead to balanced market in 2010 with net deliverability to decline 3 bcfd by
yearend (assuming an average 900 rigs [drilling for gas] this year).” They said,
“With gas unlikely to see pricing much above $3/Mcf before October at most
points, we believe activity levels could be more severe than expected given
marginal industry drilling economics. Costs have fallen far more quickly than was
discussed on fourth-quarter conference calls. We believe costs are down nearly
20% since fourth quarter.”

BLS cites rising energy prices in latest PPI
Rising energy prices were a major influence as the Producer
Price Index for Finished Goods climbed 1.4% in January, the US
Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Feb.
18. Energy goods accounted for about 75% of the broad-based advance in the finished goods, intermediate goods, and crude goods
indexes, it said.
“The index for finished energy goods rose 5.1% in January, its
fourth consecutive monthly increase,” BLS said. About two thirds
of the advance can be attributed to an 11.5% jump in gasoline prices, it added. Increases in the liquefied petroleum gas and home
heating indexes also were major factors, it said.
The PPI for intermediate materials, supplies, and components
climbed 1.7% in January—its largest increase since a similar advance in August 2009, according to BLS. It noted that the index
for intermediate energy goods rose 6.9% in January, its biggest
increase since a 9.6% jump in November 2007. A 20.4% surge in
diesel fuel prices was a major factor in the January advance, with
gasoline and jet fuel indexes also making a major contribution.
BLS said its crude energy materials PPI jumped 16.8% in January. “From October through January, prices for crude energy materials climbed 27.5%, following a 9.4% gain for the 3 months
ended October 2009,” it added. Two thirds of January’s monthly
increase can be traced to a 25.5% surge in the natural gas index,
with oil prices also contributing, DOL’s statistical service said.
The latest PPI did not surprise American Petroleum Institute
Chief Economist John C. Felmy, who noted that other reports have
shown that oil prices rose from December to January. “Gasoline
prices also climbed. It shouldn’t be such a surprise, since retail
sales figures prices which have been released also were affected
by increased gasoline prices,” he told OGJ.
Felmy cautioned that BLS price indexes are a point-to-point index on a certain day each month. “If you were trying to compare
the average for the month, we’ve seen prices come down since the
end of January,” Felmy said.

Pertamina fails to clear environmental hurdles
The development of some 16 oil and gas blocks owned by Indonesia’s state-run PT Pertamina has been postponed due to the
company’s failure to obtain recommendation from the environmental office.
The Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry could not issue
the necessary permits for the development of the 16 oil and gas
blocks because a recommendation from the environmental office
had not been obtained.
“Eight of the required licenses have been proposed since 2008
but have not been issued so far,” said Sahala Lumbangaol, the
state-owned Enterprises Ministry’s deputy for mining and strate-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

gic industries, energy, and telecommunications.
Meanwhile, the Indonesian government drafted a regulation
that would grant Pertamina the right of first refusal for oil and gas
blocks when their existing contracts expire.
According to Edi Hermantoro, director of upstream oil and gas
at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Pertamina prior
to any decision to extend the contract with the existing operator
would have the chance to submit a proposal to develop the block,
which would then be evaluated by a government-formed team.
Under the proposed regulations, the government would earn
85% of production revenue from a block compared with the present 60%. The final draft of the new regulations is said to be awaiting the approval of Energy Minister Darwin Saleh.
Analyst BMI said the regulations will be “worrisome” for foreign investors hoping for long-term returns on their investments,
while “there are some doubts as to whether Pertamina’s increasing
upstream influence at the expense of IOCs will improve Indonesia’s ability to efficiently exploit its resource base.”

AED Oil acquires acreage in Indonesia
AED Oil Ltd. has agreed to purchase two wholly owned subsidiaries of Nations Petroleum Co. Ltd. that hold interests in oil and
gas contract areas in Indonesia.
AED said it will pay Calgary-based NPC $1.5 million and will
issue the firm 12 million shares of AED for 100% and 60% respective stakes in permits in West Papua and Madura Island.
The Rombebai area covers 5,795 sq km and lies in northern
coastal Papua, while the South Madura area is primarily onshore
and covers the southern part of Madura Island.
AED said four wells drilled in the Rombebai contract area in
the 1950’s by Royal Dutch Shell PLC encountered natural gas, but
the reserves were not developed as the firm was exploring for oil.
Further testing by NPC indicates that the permit’s Gesa reservoir could contain 5 tcf of gas, but an AED executive acknowledged that the firm faces a large range of uncertainties as the reservoir sands have yet to be drilled, AED said.
Analyst IHS Global Insight agreed, saying, “AED has high hopes
of building an LNG plant at Rombebai to monetize any reserves
discovered” but that, “significant uncertainties as to the potential
of the area remain, particularly as reservoir sands have not yet
been penetrated through drilling.”
Last November, AED signed a letter of intent with NPC to buy
its wholly owned subsidiary that holds a 50% operating interest
in the Brunei Block L oil and gas permit, which comprises a large
production-sharing agreement covering about 2,200 sq km both
onshore and offshore.
In the preceding 12 months, NPC had undertaken a $20 million 3D seismic program over a large part of Block L, delineat-

ing several drill-ready prospects. AED also said that planning had
reached “advanced stages” for a two-well drilling campaign for
early 2010.
At the time, AED managing director Pedro De Souza said the
firm was “also evaluating Asian assets held by other Nations’
wholly owned subsidiaries” and that “an exclusivity period has
been agreed over these assets.”

Exploration

&

Development

Mozambique Rovuma wildcat is gas discovery
The Windjammer deepwater exploration well in the frontier
Rovuma basin off Mozambique cut more than 480 net ft of natural
gas pay in high-quality reservoir sands with 4,100 ft remaining to
be drilled.
Anadarko Petroleum Corp., operator of the discovery, said the
net gas pay lies within a gross column of more than 1,200 ft. The
well is at intermediate casing point of about 14,000 ft and is projected to 18,100 ft.
So far, the well has tested one of the seven identified play types
in Anadarko’s operated acreage off Mozambique, and the results
are a strong indication of the basin’s potential, Anadarko said.
Windjammer is in Offshore Area 1 in 4,800 ft of water in the
Mozambique Channel 30 miles east of Mozambique’s coast and
slightly farther south of the border with Tanzania. After testing
deeper objectives, Anadarko plans to move the Bedford Dolphin
drillship to its Collier prospect about 50 miles south-southeast on
the block.
The Anadarko-led group will drill two to four more wildcats
in the basin this year. It will use results from Windjammer and
Collier to determine which prospects are drilled next.
Interests in the well are Anadarko 43%, BPRL Ventures Mozambique BV 11.75%, Cove Energy Mozambique Rovuma Offshore
Ltd. 10%, Mitsui E&P Mozambique Area 1 Ltd. 23.5%, Videocon
Mozambique Rovuma 1 Ltd. 11.75%. Mozambique’s Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos’ 15% interest was carried through the
exploration phase.

KOC to tap Shell nonassociated gas expertise
Kuwait Oil Co. has signed a 5-year service contract with Royal
Dutch Shell PLC to manage the further development of nonassociated gas-condensate fields in northern Kuwait.
Shell is expected to provide technical advisors because the
fields involve “unconventional geological formations, difficult
reservoir conditions, and complex gas compositions,” Shell said.
Geologic and engineering details were not immediately available.

Drilling

&

Around the same time, a leak was reported at Puffin field,
which had been suspended since May after Sinopec and AED terminated the charter contract of Sea Production for the use of the
Front Puffin floating production, storage, and offloading vessel at
the field for alleged breaches related to occupational health, safety,
and the environment (OGJ, Nov. 2, 2009). ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Deep gas exploration that started last decade has resulted in
production of 140 MMcfd of nonassociated gas, short of Kuwait’s
goal of 175 MMcfd by this time, officials said. The ultimate goal is
2.5 bcfd of nonassociated gas output by 2030.
Kuwaiti sources reported the country’s first nonassociated gas
discovery at the MU-12 well below Mutriba oil field, southwest of
Raudhatain (OGJ, May 10, 2004, p. 34). The well produced gascondensate from the Permo-Triassic Sudair formation at 19,000
ft. At least one Mutriba well has been drilled as deep as 23,000 ft.
Kuwait also has deep nonassociated gas production in Umm
Niga field and from the Lower Jurassic Marrat formation in Sabriyah field. Kuwait has claimed that 35 tcf is recoverable from those
two fields. Flows have also been reported from the Middle Jurassic
Sargelu formation in northern Kuwait.
The emirate hopes to boost nonassociated gas output to 1.5
bcfd by 2015. The original plan called for as few as 85-90 wells,
but lately officials have begun talking in terms of nearly 200 wells.
Associated gas production is also expected to rise to 1.5 bcfd
from the present 1 bcfd as Kuwait hikes oil output to a goal of 4
million b/d from 3.15 million b/d currently.

TransAtlantic to start Thrace basin gas sales
TransAtlantic Petroleum Ltd., Dallas, plans to begin gas sales
through a 30-km gathering system into the Botas pipeline by early
March from its Thrace basin Edirne license in northwestern Turkey.
TransAtlantic resumed drilling at Edirne in January and has
spud Yolboyu-1, third well in its five to seven-well campaign. Yolboyu-1 is a 6,500-ft exploratory well that targets deeper gas potential south of the existing 3D seismic survey.
The company logged and cased the first two wells, Kumluk-1
and Kartal-1, where logs indicate net pay. All wells will be completed in a batch. On western Edirne, the company shot a further
81 sq km of 3D seismic and has begun interpretation.
TransAtlantic is operator with 55% interest in more than
119,000 gross acres. ✦

Inpex Australia holds the remaining interest.
Apache also operates or has an interest in several other projects
in Western Australia.
Apache holds a 28.57% interest in the BHP Billiton Petroleum
Ltd. operated $1.7 billion Pyrenees project, scheduled to start producing in this year’s second half. The project includes the Crosby,
Ravensworth, and Stickle oil fields, which lie in 560-820 ft of
water on Block WA-12-R in the Exmouth basin (OGJ Online, July
3, 2007). BHP Billiton holds the remaining 71.43% interest in the
Pyrenees development.
In 2011, Apache expects to start production from its operated
Reindeer field through the Devil Creek processing plant—Western Australia’s first new domestic natural gas processing hub in
Western Australia in more than 15 years. Apache said Devil Creek
is forecast to increase Western Australia’s domestic gas production
capacity by as much as 20%. Apache holds 55% interest in Reindeer with the remaining interest held by Santos Ltd.
Apache also will supply gas from its Julimar and Brunello discoveries to Chevron Corp.’s Wheatstone LNG project and become
a foundation equity partner in the project. Apache said the fields
contain an estimated 2.1 tcf of gross gas reserves. Apache holds a
65% interest in the discoveries and plans to make a final investment decision on the first phase of Wheatstone in 2011. Kuwait
Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co. owns the remaining 35%.

Total to proceed with Shetlands project
Total SA has advanced a decision to invest in two UK gas fields
after the British government earlier this month introduced tax
breaks to encourage development in the area west of the Shetland
Islands.
Total’s director of North Sea operations Patrice de Vivies said he
expected to sanction the development of the Laggan and Tormore
gas fields, which will be brought on stream in March as a single
project.
Total’s decision follows a recent announcement by the British
government that it would give a £1 billion-plus tax boost to help
to jumpstart production in remote gas fields west of the Shetland
Islands.
“The legislation, if approved by the House, will extend the
field allowance, announced in Budget 2009, to remote deepwater

Paramount Petroleum to buy California refinery
Paramount Petroleum Corp. plans to buy a closed Bakersfield,
Calif., refinery from Flying J Inc., and its subsidiary Big West of
California LLC, for $40 million, subject to approval from a bankruptcy court.
The refinery, which has a 65,000 b/cd capacity, supplies diesel
and gasoline to California. It was shut down for lack of cash with
which to buy oil (OGJ, Feb. 9, 2009, Newsletter).
Paramount, a subsidiary of Alon Energy USA Inc., agreed to pay
$40 million plus the fair market value of inventory. Clean Fuels
project equipment and a 250-acre buffer property were excluded
from the transaction. The agreement also includes an assumption
of environmental clean up obligations.

gas fields, which are found in the west of Shetland area,” said
Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling (OGJ, Feb. 8, 2010,
p. 28).
“Approval of the legislation will be sought no later than the end
of March,” a Treasury spokesman said.
In December Total was holding talks with the British government on extending tax relief to its Laggan and Tormore fields in
the west of Shetland region. Total said the fields could be brought
on stream in 2014, depending on the tax break.
According to analyst BMI, Total has a “relatively large” exposure to the West of Shetland. It is the operator of the Laggan and
Tormore fields with a 50% interest, alongside partners DONG Energy 20%, Eni SPA 20%, and Chevron Corp. 10%.
“Total forecasts output from Laggan-Tormore to be 90,000 b/d
of condensate and 5.2 billion cu m/year of gas,” BMI said, adding
that “This would be a massive boost to Total’s UK production,
which has being falling steadily in recent years.”
BMI said Total’s liquids output has dropped from 135,000 b/d
in 2005 to just 91,000 b/d in 2008, while over the same period
its gas output has fallen to 6.7 billion cu m from 9.6 billion cu m.

Oil output rising in Turkey’s Selmo field
Production at Selmo, Turkey’s second-largest oil field by cumulative production, is expected to top 2,000 b/d of 34° gravity oil
as soon as three recently drilled wells are placed on production.
The field, in Turkey’s Southeast basin north of the Zagros fold
belt, averaged 1,715 b/d in the first half of February vs. 1,534 b/d
in fourth-quarter 2009.
TransAtlantic Petroleum Ltd., Dallas, with 100% interest in the
field, plans to drill at least 18 infill wells at Selmo in 2010. The underdeveloped field has produced 83 million bbl of the 600 million
bbl estimated in place. Spacing averages 188 acres/well.
In the past 90 days the company has reworked wells to reduce
water cut and acidized the upper producing intervals in several
wells. The MSD dolomite and Upper LSL limestone formations
have made good completions with low water cut.
A fourth pulling unit and the company’s own acid stimulation
equipment are to arrive in the second quarter of 2010, enabling
the company to pump higher-rate jobs. ✦

Montana gas storage, pipeline project planned
Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co. has launched a $100-130
million project to boost delivery capacity from its Baker natural
gas storage field in eastern Montana by April 2012.
Part of the project is an expansion of the company’s gas pipeline system that connects Baker, the largest gas storage field in the
US, with Northern Border Pipeline north of Dickinson, ND.
The company would add as much as 125 MMcfd to existing
firm storage deliverability capacity from Baker by drilling new
wells, adding compression, replacing and looping gathering lines,
and looping pipelines between Baker and Northern Border.
Withdrawal capacity of 115 MMcfd at Baker would be more
than doubled if shipper interest exists.
A binding open season for the project began Feb. 16 and ends
Mar. 18, 2010, said Steven L. Bietz, WBI president and chief executive officer.
“Usage of our storage facilities reached record levels in 2009
and we are currently sold out of firm storage capacity so this is
an excellent time to move forward with an enhancement of our
Baker storage field,” said Bietz.
Baker is one of three storage fields owned and operated by WBI
at which working gas capacity totals 193 bcf.
The other two are Elk Basin and Billy Creek fields in northern
Wyoming.

Arrow to buy Gladstone LNG plant
Arrow Energy Ltd., Brisbane, is to buy the proposed Fisherman’s Landing LNG plant to be built in Gladstone, Queensland,
from its project partner Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd., Perth, for $168
million (Aus.).
This figure includes an up-front payment of $51 million in
cash and options. The plant is to be fueled from Arrow’s coalseam
gas fields in the Surat-Bowen basins to the west.
The acquisition comes just a month after Arrow signed a deal
giving it ownership of the first LNG train at the plant and supersedes this earlier agreement.
Arrow says the new deal is a further simplification of the Fisherman’s Landing LNG development and the elimination of the
commercial agreements with LNG Ltd. It will improve the ability
to construct, finance, and ultimately allow for greater flexibility
in the operation of the plan.
The acquisition price includes $45 million for reimbursement
of project costs incurred to date, an initial $5.7 million licensing
fee for the use of LNG Ltd.’s trademarked optimized single-mixed
refrigerant (OSMR) liquefaction technology, and a grant of 12.5
million options exercisable at $3.50 each, which expire May 14.
Arrow will pay LNG Ltd. a minimum royalty of 0.7% calculated on the oil price differential above $60/bbl (US) for the first
train. A higher royalty of 0.9% will be payable if capital expendi-

ture for the project is materially lower than current estimates of
$2.1-2.2 billion (Aus.).
Further payments will be required to LNG Ltd. when certain
milestones in the project are reached. These include $24 million
(Aus.) at final investment decision, an additional $5 million (US)
licensing fee at FID, $24 million (Aus.) when the plant produces 1
million tonnes of LNG a year, and $63.5 million (Aus.) when the
plant reaches 3 million tonnes/year of LNG production through
a second train.
Arrow will now reassess the feasibility of the original Mar. 31
final investment decision date although first production is still
scheduled for late 2012.
For its part LNG Ltd. will come out of the completed deal with
$85 million (Aus.) cash, 12.5 million Arrow options, and no further commitments for Fisherman’s Landing work. This will allow the company to focus on marketing its OSMR technology and
other midscale LNG opportunities.

Peru LNG lets service, maintenance contract
Peru LNG has awarded a long-term service and maintenance
contract to Wood Group GTS, a unit of John Wood Group PLC.
The value of the contract is $150 million over 18 years, Wood
Group said.
Wood Group GTS will provide a service and maintenance
program to maximize machine availability of the gas turbines,
compressors, and generators at Peru LNG’s Pampa Melchorita site
south of Lima.
The agreement covers two GE Frame 7 (7EA DLN-1) gas turbine-driven compressor trains for the LNG process and three GE
LM2500 + DLE aeroderivative gas-turbine power generator sets.
Wood Group GTS will implement remote monitoring and
diagnostics, supply of spare parts, component repair, inventory
management, field service, and maintenance management to
maximize machine availability over the 18-year term.
Since 2007, Wood Group Production Services has supported
Peru LNG by supplying specialized and technical personnel to
Compania Operadora de LNG del Peru, the operating company
of Peru LNG.
COLP has been responsible for building the LNG plant and gas
supply pipeline and will be responsible for plant and pipeline operation and support. ✦

A Journally Speaking column entitled “Projection and
the Pipeline” misstated the units of Alberta oil sands production in terms of billion b/d, while actual production estimates should have been stated in million b/d (OGJ, Feb.

What bipartisanship means
Suddenly, bipartisanship is back in fashion in
Washington, DC. Since the general election of
November 2008, bipartisanship has been the runaway spaniel of politics—something missed and
longed for yet deemed unlikely to be encountered
again. Election victories in 2008 by the liberal
wing of the Democratic Party shooed the pooch.
It emboldened White House Chief of Staff Rahm
Emanuel to advise, soon after the election, “Never
let a serious crisis go to waste…it’s an opportunity
to do things you couldn’t do before.” It evoked
this famous slap-down by House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi to critics of $825 billion in “stimulus”
spending on a fat catalog of liberal causes: “We
won the election. We wrote the bill.”
Then, bipartisanship didn’t matter. Now, as the
liberal agenda implodes, it does. President Barack
Obama has invited congressional Republicans to
a “bipartisan summit” Feb. 25 to try to salvage
health care reform. In another bipartisan gesture,
he has offered to back construction of nuclear
power plants. All Republicans have to do to earn
this treat is agree to more support for economically hopeless renewable fuels and new taxation of
fossil energy.
No one in the oil and gas industry should be
fooled. Bipartisanship is bait-and-switch, a desperate tactic of the politically beleaguered.

Limitless cost
Indeed, bipartisanship set the US on its current
course toward limitless energy cost. It was the
core sales proposition of the Energy Policy Act of
2005 (EPACT). So smitten were energy interests,
including oil and gas, by the spirit of bipartisanship—not to mention the chance to score a tax
break here and there—that no one noticed the
historic pivot the US made when former President
George W. Bush signed the bill into law.
Because Democrats and Republicans had
worked together to pass comprehensive energy
legislation, it seemed not to matter that no one
understood everything or even much of what
the mammoth bill contained. What mattered
was that political rivals had made deals and
passed something not strictly the product of one
party or the other. There were hugs and kisses
all around. And when the party ended the US
government was solidly back in the business of
18

making fuel choices for Americans.
That was historic. Since then, energy policymaking has been a competition for public money,
which politicians happily have dispensed with
little regard for cost or proportionate contribution
to energy supply.
One of the biggest boondoggles was the firstever volumetric mandate for already-subsidized
agricultural ethanol in vehicle fuel. Congress
didn’t set required volumes by considering market
practicalities but rather by splitting the difference
between what the ethanol lobby demanded and
the American Petroleum Institute called acceptable. It naturally left to regulators the difficult
chore of prospectively apportioning mandated
volumes each year among numerous suppliers in
an unpredictable market.
After Democrats took control of Congress, lawmakers in 2007 set a mandate for total biofuels,
some not yet and maybe never commercial, more
than four times the size of the 2005 mistake and
much more complex and difficult to implement.
For technical and market reasons, the elevated
mandate will look increasingly unfeasible as it
ramps up unless vehicle fuel consumption makes
an unexpected growth spurt. But Democrats
wanted to outdo the mandate passed, in the spirit
of bipartisanship, while Republicans controlled
things. So they did. And statutory failure looms.
And Americans face increases in fuel costs and
taxes. And Democrats are in political trouble. So
they appeal to bipartisanship.

Arbitraging errors
With energy, Americans don’t need bipartisanship. They need continuous and affordable supply
of convenient and environmentally manageable
fuel. A sensible approach to the subject should not
be a defining position of one part or the other.
Both parties can learn enough about energy at
least to see that the government can’t make fuel
choices without creating unsustainable cost.
At present, because neither party approaches
energy that way, compromise means arbitraging
errors. Until Republicans and Democrats begin to
calibrate energy ambitions to physical, economic,
and market realities, bipartisanship will remain
a shroud hiding too much spending on too little
energy. ✦

Noting that Colorado was the first
US state to pass a renewable energy
standard, Ritter said that the use of
renewable energy doubled in 2007
and the state is now 5 years ahead of
schedule to meet the current 20% goal.
He urged lawmakers to “think bigger,
creating even larger markets for solar,
wind, biomass, hydro, and geothermal” and increase renewable energy’s
share of Colorado’s energy consumption to 30%.
“This session, we also have an opportunity to lead the nation in expanding the role of cleaner-burning
natural gas in our energy portfolio.
Gas has always been part of the New
Energy Economy, and this year we look
forward to solidifying its role for the
future,” Ritter added.
“Over the past few months, I’ve
been working closely with the natural
gas industry, with utilities, and with
other stakeholders. We’re looking at
ways to increase the use of Colorado
gas to generate electricity, reduce air
pollution, stabilize energy bills for consumers, and create jobs,” he said.
In his Feb. 9 budget address, Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell (D)
mentioned gas’s potential contribution
to his state in a different context: He
proposed taxing Marcellus shale production—as well as cigars and smokeless tobacco products. “Once again, it’s
simply not fair that Big Tobacco and
Big Oil and Gas are exempt from the
obligations the rest of us have to bear,”
Rendell stated. “The revenues raised by
these initiatives are overwhelmingly
supported by our fellow citizens, and
would provide a half a billion dollars

Fund.”

EIA said. “A portion of the decline in
pipeline imports this year is expected
to be offset by imports of [LNG], which
were double year-ago levels in January
as temperatures plummeted and prices
jumped,” it added.
EIA said very cold weather during
January’s first half, particularly in the
Southeast, contributed to an 8.4% jump
in its monthly estimate of demand to
generate electricity from its previous
forecast. “The latest estimate for electric
power consumption in January would
be a new record for the month,” it
indicated.
While demand for gas to produce
power has been strong so far this year,
EIA said an expected increase in coalfired generation capacity and higher gas
prices later in 2010 should reduce gas’s
share of the baseload power mix by
1.3% despite lower-than-normal snowpack in the Northwest which could
lower hydroelectric generation there by
8% and boost demand for gas.
It said that it anticipates stronger
residential, commercial, and industrial
demand to more than offset a drop
in consumption for power generation, leading to the 0.4% rise in overall
domestic gas demand. The strongest
growth is expected from industrial
customers as a result of improved economic conditions, EIA said.

Production outlook
According to EIA, the impact of continued lower drilling activity, following the number of working US gas rigs
hitting a low of 665 in mid-July 2009,
will contribute to the 2.6% production
decline it forecast for 2010. “While the
number of working gas rigs is currently
about 25% below the year-ago level, [it]
has increased during the last month by
about 100 rigs to a total of 861 at the
end of January,” it said.
Current 2010 futures prices of
$5.50-6.70/MMbtu “appear to provide
the necessary economic incentive to
expand drilling programs even further,” it added. “As a result, EIA expects
monthly gas production to begin to

tah was very much in the news
a year ago after US Interior
Secretary Ken Salazar ordered the
Bureau of Land Management to reject
77 successful bids from a December
2008 lease sale. Several members of
the state’s congressional delegation
angrily criticized the move.
Others reacted differently. Soon
after he became governor last year,
Gary R. Herbert, a Republican, contacted former Salt Lake City Mayor
Ted Wilson, a Democrat, and asked if
he could pick his brain about energy
and environmental issues. After
talking for several hours, Herbert
asked Wilson to lead a new Balanced
Resource Council.
“These are matters that have
become so polarized that progress
has become all but impossible,”
Herbert said during his Jan. 26 State

much-needed new ‘state of mind’ on
environmental issues.”

served on the group’s board.
“Bill Barrett has been very creative
talking to SUWA,” he added. “As an
environmental guy, I’m encouraged
when someone like him tells me
how drill sites can be smaller and
roads can be less intrusive.”
One issue the council is trying to
resolve involves roads across public
lands that producers need to reach
leases, he explained. Several state
and federal agencies can become
involved, creating delays.
Wilson said the council has proposed to the US Department of the
Interior that administration of such
roads be given to each county, and
that unresolved disputes be taken to
court as a group.

With environmentalists

“Basically, we are trying to make
oil and gas leases more accessible,”
he said. “We’re trying to do this
with environmentalists at the table.
They don’t like surprises. It gets their
dander up.”
What’s important is that people
are willing to meet and discuss issues, Wilson continued. “People are

Total gas in storage was 2,406 bcf on
Jan. 29, 150 bcf more than the previous
5-year average and 199 bcf higher than
the comparable 1999 week’s level, the
forecast noted. “Colder-than-normal
temperatures in the first half of January led to the largest consecutive-week

Withdrawals for the 2 weeks ended Jan.
15 were a combined 317 bcf above the
average withdrawal for the corresponding weeks over the previous 5 years, it
observed.
Considerably warmer temperatures
during January’s final 2 weeks led to
withdrawals totaling 201 bcf, compared
to the previous 5-year average of 357
bcf for the comparable period, EIA said.

It said that it anticipates working gas inventories will finish 2010’s first quarter

at $7.51/MMbtu on Jan. 7 as colder
weather tightened its grip on much of
the country, then fell to about $5.30/
MMbtu by the end of the month as
temperatures eased, it said.
EIA said that it expects the Henry

finding that GHGs from new motor
vehicles and engines contribute to air
pollution which poses a threat to public
health.
The group is focused first on significant impacts that the endangerment
finding will have on stationary sources
of GHGs, according to Matt Paulson,
a partner in Baker Botts LLP’s Austin
office who filed a petition in the DC
Circuit Court of Appeals on the coalition’s behalf.
“Specifically, because the [CAA]

like global climate change but rather
is intended to address local or regional
pollution such as smog, EPA’s endangerment finding will open the door to
what will be, as acknowledged by EPA,
burdensome and wholly unworkable
permitting requirements for stationary
sources,” Paulson said.
Paulson emphasized that the organizations are not disputing the science
behind the existence of global change
itself, but believe that EPA’s record supporting its endangerment finding is
inadequate. Four days earlier, when the

however, USCAP drew fire from

companies which were not members,
including several in the oil and gas

the House passed a bill cosponsored by
Reps. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) and
Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in late June
which several trade associations said
favored some industries over others.
“House climate legislation and

gas will remain off-limits to the American people, enough to meet our needs
for more than 12 years at current levels
of consumption.”
American Gas Association Pres. David N. Parker said, “It’s clear from this
report that the status quo on energy
production simply won’t suffice. We
encourage lawmakers to heed the results of this study and take a closer look
at the energy-rich areas in our country
that are currently off-limits.”

Congress removed oil and gas moratoriums on offshore public lands over a
year ago, but required actions to access
the energy resources there have not
been taken,” said O’Neal Hamilton, the
study group’s chairman and a former
chairman of both NARUC and the
South Carolina Public Service Commission.

Study’s purpose
Hamilton said, “Whether additional federal lands should be leased
for energy development, and under
what conditions leasing should occur,
is a matter for national energy policy
decision makers. Our research allows
policymakers to know the extent of the
resource base and the effects that maintaining the restrictions would have on
the country.”
GTI’s domestic resource assessment
for the study suggested that US gas resources would climb by 132 tcf onshore
and 154 tcf offshore, excluding parts of
Alaska, from 2009 to 2030. It estimated
that domestic crude resources could
grow by 36 billion bbl offshore and
by 6 billion bbl, all within the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge. It projected
no increase for onshore crude resources
in the Lower 48 states.
“With these additions, GTI estimates the current resource base [will]
increase from 1,748 tcf to 2,034 tcf for
gas and from 186 billion bbl to 229 bbl
for oil,” the study’s executive summary
said. “The increases are driven by two
primary factors: the increased shale gas
activity and development successes, and
an increase in resource estimates for the
currently restricted offshore areas to
better reflect the impact of new technology and successes in the currently
available and developed offshore areas.”
The study noted that if resources in
areas which previously were covered by
congressional moratoriums or presidential withdrawals are not developed,
there would be no new environmental
effects attributable to their development.

big changes

M

exico’s oil and gas industry is
in for some very big changes,
especially in the amount of LNG it
plans to import in the near future.
The Mexican government recently
unveiled that future with its annual
natural gas demand forecast, which
estimates that its LNG imports will
spiral by 60% in 2010 alone.
Altogether, Mexico’s imports of
LNG will average 586 MMcfd this
year, up from 367 MMcfd in 2009.
But the story does not stop there,
as government estimates see Mexico’s
gas demand rising to 11.2 bcfd in
2024 from 7.204 bcfd in 2008, while
the country’s production will rise to
8.7 bcfd in 2024.
What does Mexico plan to do
about the 2.5-bcfd shortfall? Experts
say that brings LNG imports into
play, and a number of international
firms have already positioned themselves for the expected business.

Plant market?

What is meant by the plant
market? Well, it’s a reminder of the
recent agreement by Mitsui and Tokyo Gas to buy five gas-fired power

Spain’s Gas Natural.

Argentina closes ports to ships visiting Falklands
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Argentina’s President Cristina Fernandez, intent on increasing tension
over oil exploration in the South Atlantic, has signed a government decree
restricting the movement of vessels
between the Argentine mainland and
the Falkland Islands, also known as Las
Malvinas.
“Every ship or vessel intending to
transit between ports located on the
Argentine mainland and ports located
in the Malvinas, South Georgia, and
South Sandwich Islands, or through
Argentine waters toward the latter,
and/or loading goods to be transported
directly or indirectly between these
ports must request prior authorization
by the competent national authority,”
the decree stated.
Fernandez’s decree follows last
week’s detention of a ship by Argentine
authorities, who claimed the vessel had
already visited the Falkland Islands and
was loading a fresh cargo of oil pipes
for a return visit—a claim rejected by
Techint, which said the steel tubes were
for customers in the Mediterranean
(OGJ Online, Feb. 12, 2010).
The president’s chief of staff Anibal
Fernandez said the government announcement was accompanied by the
creation of a new commission comprised of various ministries to oversee
and coordinate the actions needed to
fulfill the decree. The commission
includes officials from the foreign and
defense ministries, along with others
from Customs, and Ports and Waterways.
The aim of the commission is to
develop a registry with statistical data
of vessel movements in the area and
cross them with ship activities both in
28

the UK and the Falklands. The commission is also assessing the legal framework and the commercial impact of the
enforcement of such measures.
Respect for international law, said
Anibal Fernandez, “obliges us to defend
the interests of the Argentines, to take
such decisions that allow us to go to
a point that guarantees not only the
defense of sovereignty but of all the
resources that may exist” in the islands.
Apart from the new decree, the Argentine ministry of foreign affairs also
is reported to have adopted a strategy
aimed at creating a framework of insecurity for all of the so-called “illegal”
activities in the disputed area which are
geared to exploit what the Argentineans
refer to as “our” resources.

“Offshore oil drilling is a very high
risk operation and if a sense of insecurity can be injected, it should further
discourage the enterprise,” said one
Argentinean official.
Exploration operations are set to
begin next week with the arrival of the
Ocean Guardian oil rig. British authorities have already expressed concerns
that Buenos Aires will seek to disrupt
the movement of the vessel into the
waters surrounding the Falklands.
That idea took on further weight this
week as local media reported that the
Argentine defense ministry is tracking
the rig’s course and has supplied the
foreign ministry with pictures of the
“floating platform” being towed just
south of the Uruguayan coastline. ✦

UFIP: French refining industry situation ‘critical’
Doris Leblond
OGJ Correspondent
The French refining industry faces a
“critical” situation as part of a European system in which “between 10
to 15% of the 114 refineries should be
shut down to restore a demand-supply
balance,” says the leader of a trade
group.
Jean-Louis Schilansky, president of
Union Francaise des Industries Petrolieres (UFIP), gave that assessment at a
press conference Feb. 4 in Paris.
In an industry outlook, Schilansky
noted that demand for oil products in
France last year dropped by 2.8% in a
change he called “structural.”
Refinery runs for all of last year fell
to 72 million tonnes from 84 million

tonnes in 2008 as margins diminished.
Schilansky said gasoline exports fell
by 17% last year, while gas oil imports
grew by 38%. Average gross refining
margins fell to €15/tonne from $23/
tonne during 1995-2008.
Since March 2009, Schilansky added,
the French refining industry has lost
€150 million/month.
With a planned storage hub at the
Marseille-Fos port targeting capacity of
1.1 million cu m and 80,000 cu m becoming available at the Fos Oil Depot,
French refiners face growing competition from abroad.
As explained to OGJ by Esso SAF’s
Head of Communications and External
Relations Jean-Francois Dussoulier, this
means that the much cheaper products
from refineries abroad will be able to
compete with France’s more expensive
products.

Williams to restructure, enlarge partnership
Williams Cos. Inc., Tulsa, will
fold its natural gas pipeline and US
midstream businesses into Williams
Partners LP, along with its limited and
general-partner interests in Williams
Pipeline Partners LP, in a partnershiptransforming restructuring valued at
$12 billion.
In other recent company news:
• Enterra Energy Trust announced
that its board unanimously approved
the conversion of the trust to a corporation to be named Equal Energy Ltd.
In response to changes in Canada’s tax
laws regards trusts, effective Jan. 1,
2011.
• Heritage Oil PLC said Eni International BV has terminated “with immediate effect” its previous agreement to
buy with Heritage’s interest in Blocks 1
and 3A in Uganda.
• Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras)
exercised its preferential rights to acquire Devon Energy Corp.’s 50% interest in Gulf of Mexico’s Cascade field.
• Callon Petroleum Co., Natchez,
Miss., has added onshore and unconventional assets to its Gulf of Mexico
properties and set a $61.7 million capital budget for 2010.
• Niko Resources Ltd., Calgary, will
buy Voyager Energy Ltd., which has
interests in Trinidad onshore blocks.
Voyager’s board unanimously approved, and shareholder will be polled
in March.

Williams restructuring
Williams’ gas pipeline assets include
100% of Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Co., 65% of Northwest Pipeline GP, and
24.5% of Gulfstream Natural Gas System LLC. Williams also will contribute
its general-partner and limited-partner
interests in Williams Pipeline Partners,
which owns the remaining 35% of
Northwest Pipeline.
Williams will own about 80% of

new, much larger Williams Partners, up
from 24% of current partnership. The
company said it will be able to allocate
more capital to exploration and production for growth and diversification.
The midstream assets include Williams’ operations in Rocky Mountains
and Gulf Coast, as well as its recently
added business in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale. These assets encompass
seven processing trains totaling 2.3
bcfd of capacity in the Rockies and four
processing trains on the Gulf Coast.
The Gulf Coast processing trains
are integrated with five major deepwater oil and gas pipeline systems
and two platforms to handle production in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The
midstream assets also include various
equity investments in domestic processing and fractionation assets, said the
announcement.
For the asset contributions, Williams
will receive from Williams Partners
some $3.5 billion cash, less Williams
Partners’ transaction fees and expenses,
plus 203 million Williams Partners
limited-partner units, and will maintain its 2% general-partner interest, said
the announcement. Williams Partners
also will assume about $2 billion of
existing debt associated with the gas
pipeline assets.
The transaction will immediately
add to Williams Partners’ distributable cash flow/limited-partner unit.
Williams expects this restructuring to
increase recurring earnings and cash
flow and enable the company to pursue
a “greater number of investment and
growth opportunities.”
Upon completion of the transactions, Williams will continue to be an
integrated natural gas company but
with a simplified corporate structure,
said the announcement. Williams will
retain its full ownership and control of
general partner Williams Partners. The

restructuring will increase Williams’
combined general-partner and limitedpartner ownership interest in Williams
Partners to about 84%.
Williams will continue to focus
on the success of Williams Partners,
given its large ownership position and
preeminent exploration and production
business. Williams is the tenth largest
natural gas producer in the US, and its
primary production areas are in the
Piceance, Powder River, San Juan, and
Fort Worth basins. Williams also has
a growing position in the Marcellus
shale in the Appalachian basin where it
recently began operations.
Williams will retain the olefins and
Canadian midstream businesses and
will retain the remaining 25.5% interest in Gulfstream, in accordance with
certain limitations in Gulfstream’s governing documents. This interest would
be eligible for contribution to Williams
Partners in the future.

Enterra restructuring
Don Klapko, Enterra president and
chief executive officer, said, “We are
relaunching Enterra as Equal Energy to
create a new market brand with the conversion.” Canada changed its tax laws regarding trusts as that all Canadian trusts
must essentially pay taxes in the same
manner that corporations are taxed.
The conversion would be subject
to the approval of the trust’s unitholders as well as customary court and
regulatory approvals. The conversion is
expected by May 31.
Equal Energy will continue to pursue
the exploration and development of
Enterra Energy Trust, which involve the
Hunton natural gas and NGL play in
Oklahoma. The company also wants to
further develop its oil play in the westcentral Alberta Cardium formation, and
other Western Canadian Sedimentary
Basin oil and gas prospects.

HighMount Exploration & Production LLC, Houston, has named Jason
A. Garner as chief operating officer,
effective Mar. 1.
Garner will succeed James D. Abercrombie, who is retiring. Abercrombie
will remain with the company through
the end of March to ensure a smooth
transition.
Before becoming HighMount’s
western division vice-president,
Garner worked in various engineering,
planning, and management positions
for Dominion E&P in Richmond, Va.,
Houston, and Oklahoma City.
HighMount E&P is a subsidiary of
Loews Corp. It holds unconventional

Callon will drill two horizontal
wells starting in mid-2010 on a 577acre Haynesville shale unit in Bossier
Parish, La., on which it acquired a 70%
operated interest for $3 million. Offset

wells have flowed at initial rates of 20
MMcfd. As many as seven horizontal
wells are possible. Estimated gross
ultimate gas recovery is 6.4 bcf at $9
million/completed well.
Callon has 15% working interest in
Murphy Oil Corp.-operated Medusa
field, where eight wells averaged 2,000
boe/d net to Callon in 2009. Most wells
are producing from their primary
completion and have proved reserves
behind pipe. Medusa has a proved reserve life of 7 years and is 89% oil.
Callon has an 11.25% working interest in Shell Offshore-operated Habanero field, where two wells averaged
1,000 boe/d net to Callon in 2009. Callon believes important proved reserves
will be accessed by sidetracking updip
from the existing wells.
Callon’s gulf shelf assets averaged 14
MMcfd of net gas equivalent production
in 2009. The company is evaluating
options for monetizing the shelf assets
and may retain its shelf operations if no
viable alternative exists.
The company’s gulf operations will
generate the majority of Callon’s operating cash flow in 2010. With minimal
offshore capital requirements, this cash
flow will be used to fund the onshore
transition.

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
offered reassurances to international oil
companies after state-owned Petroleos
de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) signed agreements with two consortia to develop
oil fields in his country’s Orinoco belt.
“They say there’s no type of judicial
security here in Venezuela, and stuff
like this, but it’s not true,” said Chavez,
as he addressed senior executives from
Chevron Corp., Repsol
YPF SA, and other firms
involved in the auction.
“You have all the
guarantees for your
investments, your profits,
and the capital that you
want to repatriate,” said
Chavez, who added that his country has
too much oil for them to ignore. “You
need to be here.”
Underlining his country’s importance, Chavez cited a recent US Geological Survey report stating that the
Orinoco belt holds 513 billion bbl of
recoverable heavy crude. In its report,
USGS established a range of recoverable
oil of 380-652 billion bbl and determined a mean estimate of 513 billion
bbl (OGJ, Feb. 8, 2010, p. 16).

with a consortium comprised of Chevron 34% and Suelopetrol 1% along with
Mitsubishi, Jogmec, and Inpex sharing 5%. Ramirez said the group was
awarded the Carabobo 3 block after
agreeing to pay $500 million for drilling rights and a further $1 billion for
financing to PDVSA.
The Carabobo 3 project includes
development of three blocks: Carabobo
2 Sur, Carabobo 3 Norte, and Carabobo
5 (see map, OGJ, Nov. 21, 2005, p. 54).
The project also includes construction
of a heavy oil upgrader.
PDVSA’s other JV will be undertaken

and Petronas 11% together with Oil

3.5%. Ramirez said that group was
awarded the Carabobo 1 block after
agreeing to pay a $1.05 billion signing bonus and another $1.05 billion to
PDVSA for financing.
The Carabobo 1 project includes
development of two blocks: Carabobo
1 Centro and Carabobo 1 Norte. The
project also includes construction of a
heavy-oil upgrader.

wards told OGJ. “They could set one set
of rules to invite you in, then they can
change the rules. Venezuela has a history of doing exactly this. That’s what
makes this so risky.”
Nonetheless, Chevron Vice-Pres.
George Kirkland expressed optimism
over the new agreement, saying, “We
look forward to being part of this new
opportunity that will expand development of one of the world’s largest
known hydrocarbon resources.”
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade,

and Industry likewise said it welcomes
the choice of the Inpex-Mitsubishi
Corp. consortium as a developer, as it
will help the country to secure stable
energy supplies.
According to earlier reports, PDVSA’s
strategic plan calls for the investment
of about $15 billion during 2006-12 to
increase heavy oil production from the
Orinoco tar belt of Venezuela to 1.2
million b/d from the present level of
600,000 b/d. ✦

Three-company group

Advanced modeling
Concurrent with delineation and
reservoir evaluation (data acquisition)
efforts, optimization of the development plan needed to address several
key issues in terms of risk mitigation.
Although we faced a wide range of uncertainties in reservoir parameters, we
based some major decisions on deterministic solutions derived from analytical, simulation, or mental (engineering
judgment) models. These may prove
costly because some had very little consideration to the probability and what if
scenarios and resulted in actions taken
without proper exit strategies.
In these cases, an engineer would
build into the decision-making process
a safety factor, or cushion, to make
certain that failure is not an option.
Under certain conditions, it is prudent
to do so; however, this could carry a
high business cost. The need for an uncertainty analysis for making decision,
therefore, is a must.
For example, optimization of production offtake and associated requirements (such as number of injectors
and producers, injection production
ratio, depletion rates for different areas,
sweep and recovery) is difficult because
of the nonlinear nature of the optimization problem and the complex interactions between various operational
parameters.
In this case, the analysis included a
multiobjective function model. Another
technical paper discussed the details of
the methodology and its utility.4 This
article excerpts some of the detail to
clarify several points.
In field development, the most
important questions and constraints are
as follows:
• How much production offtake
is optimal from each of the fields and
reservoirs?
• What are the most optimal num-

bers of producers and injectors to be
drilled? And what is the optimum well
placement?
• How will producers and injectors
affect the injection production ratio
from each area?
• Does production from each area
satisfy its depletion requirement?
• Do we produce or inject too much
in areas that have a higher degree of
fractures that may cause premature
water breakthrough and thereby impair
the sweep?

Optimization of the development included determining a probability function for each reservoir
parameter (Fig. 7).

Optimizing these requirements is a
difficult task because there are diverging requirements. This means that
satisfying one requirement may be at
the expense of the others. For example,
a higher offtake rate from an area with
better reservoir quality means drilling
fewer producers for the same target
rate, resulting in better developmental economics. This may violate the
depletion criteria and may bring in
premature water breakthrough, which
can impair not only the reservoir sweep
and conformance but also hydrocarbon
recovery.
Another good example is producing at a depletion rate in an area with
insufficient peripheral injection well
locations, thereby potentially violating
the pressure support requirements and
consequently decreasing well productivity. This is where hard and soft
constraints come into play and one has
to assign weighted constraints.
The most important hard constraint,

• Govern the production-injection

to maximize the production plateau.
The multiobjective function
program must optimize all of these
constraints with regard to the soft
constraint of economics, which is
to reduce total development cost by
minimizing the number of injectors
and producers.
One can accomplished this by drilling wells on a priority basis in the
most prolific area first without jeopardizing all other constraints. The key
idea is establishment of hard and soft
constraints that provide the venue for
the optimization of all main requirements, including injection and producing well requirements, injection
production ratio, production offtake,
and depletion rate for individual areas.

New correlation predicts dewpoints
of acidic combustion gases
Bahman ZareNezhad
Ministry of Science, Research and Technology
Tehran
A newly developed general correlation accurately predicts acidic combustion gas dewpoints to mitigate corrosion potential in pollution control and
energy-recovery equipment.
Acidic combustion gases can cause
rapid corrosion when they condense on
the surfaces of heat recovery and fluegas-treatment equipment. This investigation considered the most important
acidic gases—SO3, SO2, NO2, hydro-

chloric acid, and hydrobromic acid.
The correlation can accurately
predict flue-gas acid dewpoint temperatures over wide ranges of acid and
water-vapor concentrations in oil and
gas operations.

Condensation, corrosion
Acid dewpoint corrosion results
from condensation of flue-gas acid
species on low temperature gas-path
surfaces. This kind of corrosion differs
from general atmospheric corrosion
and causes heavy corrosion not only of
ordinary steels but even stainless steels.1

Corrosion failures often occur because of condensing flue gases containing SO3, SO2, NO2, HCl, HBr, and H2O.
Dewpoint temperature is a function of
the water vapor concentration and the
concentration of acid species in the flue
gas.2 The condensed acids are corrosive
to steel and almost all plastics, as well
as hydraulic cement composites.
Further, gas cooling below this
dewpoint by radiation or convection
forms a mist of corrosive acid droplets
that is highly detrimental to the stack
and heat-recovery equipment.3 Many
of the processes for improving the
thermal efficiency of combined-cycle
plants can also result in lower flue-gas
temperatures leaving the heat-recovery
steam generators or increased flue-gas
moisture content. These conditions can
increase the potential for corrosion of
the low-temperature gas-path components.4
Fig. 1 shows sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid dewpoint corrosion occurring in a typical flue-gas treatment
system of a waste-incineration plant.
For a typical flue gas (SO3 = 3 ppm
(vol); HCl = 300 ppm (vol); H2O = 30
vol %), the H2SO4 and HCl dewpoints
are about 136° and 72° C., respectively
(Fig. 1).
At temperatures of 72-136° C., the
H2SO4 condensation is the main cause
of steel corrosion failure. Improvement
of the thermal efficiency of flue-gas
treatment equipment may need further
cooling to a temperature as low as 72°
C. As Fig. 1 shows, at flue-gas temperatures cooler than 72° C., HCl condensation is also an important influence in
corrosion failure.

halogenated or nitrated acid gases.
To overcome this shortcoming, Kiang proposed different correlations for
estimating NO2, HCl, and HBr dewpoints.6 There are usually significant
deviations, however, between predicted
and experimental dewpoints over the
concentrations prevailing in combustion gases.
It should be noted that there is some
disagreement between the experimental data and the Verhoff and Banchero
correlation, especially at low acid
concentrations and high H2O content.
Dewpoints predicted in the range of
120-140° C. have a positive deviation
of 4° C. and more. Also in the range of
100-121° C., the predicted dewpoints
are usually 4° C. low.
Okkes proposed a correlation (Equation 2) to overcome some of these
shortcomings.7 Although this correlation is more accurate at H2O concentrations higher than 25%, it significantly

tion of flue-gas acid dewpoints. A
set of 940 dewpoint temperatures is
determined for the most important
acidic gases—SO3, SO2, NO2, HCl,
and HBr—by using the most accurate
vapor-liquid equilibrium data.8-11 We
have found that this general correlation—Equation 3—can be used for
accurate prediction of the dewpoints
of acidic combustion gases.
It should be noted that Ai, Bi, Ci, and
Di parameters do not depend on acid
species and are always fixed. The parameter λ and molecular weight (Mw)
are given for the relevant condensed
acid. Tables 1 and 2 display the optimum values of all parameters determined by the genetic algorithm.12
With the parameters displayed in
Tables 1 and 2, Equation 3 yields the
smallest sum of the squared errors for
the entire range of acid dewpoint temperatures. The following section elaborates the performance of the proposed
correlation.

Comparisons
Fig. 2a shows results of comparing predicted flue-gas sulfuric acid
dewpoints by using Equation 3 with
experimental data at different acid and
moisture concentrations. Firing fossil
fuels that contain sulfur in heaters or
boilers yields sulfur dioxide and, to a
lesser extent, sulfur trioxide as well as
carbon dioxide and water vapor.
The SO3 combines with water vapor
in the flue gas to form sulfuric acid
and condenses on heat-transfer surfaces, a process that could lead to corrosion and destruction of the surfaces.
This condensation occurs on surfaces
that are at or below the dewpoint of
the acid gas.
As shown in Fig 2a, because the acid
dewpoint is very sensitive to the fluegas SO3 concentration, a small increase
in SO3 concentration leads to a large
increase in sulfuric acid dewpoint at a
given H2O concentration. The moisture
content is also an important influence. As the moisture concentration
increases, however, the effect of vapor

H2O on sulfuric acid dewpoint gradually reduces.
Since the sulfuric acid formed
through the reaction of SO3 and H2O in
the flue gas is usually condensed at relatively high temperatures, the corrosion
risk in the waste-heat-recovery system
is too high. As shown, the vapor-phase
sulfur trioxide concentration strongly
influences flue-gas dewpoint especially
at SO3 concentrations less than 100 ppm
(vol).
Thus the accurate prediction of
sulfuric-acid dewpoints at low SO3
concentrations prevailing in process industries is important in controlling the
corrosion problems in thermal wastetreatment plants and energy-recovery
equipment. In most installations, formation of sulfuric acid is prevented by
keeping the temperature above sulfuric
acid’s dewpoint as much as possible.
Fig. 2b compares predicted and
measured flue-gas sulfurous acid
dewpoints. The diagram shows sulfurous acid’s condensation temperature
is mainly influenced by water-vapor
concentration. Since sulfurous acid is
always formed through the dissolution
of SO2 in condensed water at lower
than the water dewpoint, the corrosion
risk in the stack is lower, compared
with that for sulfuric acid.
Sulfurous acid formation at temperatures around 60° C., however,
accelerates metallic corrosion in
heat-recovery systems. The trend of
dewpoint variation with respect to the
moisture content is similar to the case
of sulfuric acid in that the H2O content
is less influential at higher moisture
concentration. According to Fig. 2b, the
sulfurous acid dewpoint temperature
is always less than 70° C. as long as the
moisture concentration is no higher
than 30 vol %.

PHMSA committee adjusts incident reporting thresholds
Christopher E. Smith
Pipeline Editor
The US Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration
Pipelines
natural gas and hazardous liquids Technical
Pipeline Safety Standards Committee
voted in December 2009 regarding
PHMSA’s “One Rule” which addresses a
number of proposed reporting requirements for pipeline operators.
These requirements include changes
to the definition of natural gas pipeline
reportable incidents to include incidents involving any unintended fire or
explosion and replacing the $50,000
reporting threshold with a release
volume.
TPSSC is a congressionally mandated
committee consisting of government,
industry, and public pipeline safety
experts advising PHMSA as to whether
proposed rules are reasonable, practicable, and technically-feasible.
The committee voted against unintended fire and explosion as a trigger
for incident reporting and for a volume
of 10 MMcf as the new threshold for
incident reporting.

The “One Rule” proposal likewise
called on operators of hazardous liquids
pipelines to complete annual infrastructure reports for each operator and
commodity by state. Industry representatives discussed reporting burdens and
improvements to the reporting template
before the committee adopted a motion
supporting the PHMSA proposal.

Incident revision
This proposal would have changed
the definition of an incident in 49 CFR
191.3 to establish a new reporting category: an explosion or fire not intentionally set by the operator, consistent
with the accident reporting criteria of
49 CFR Part 195. PHMSA maintained
adding these events to the definition
of a reportable incident would allow
it to include additional incidents since
fires and explosions are major adverse
outcomes raising the risk of death or
injury from a pipeline failure (Fig. 1).
PHMSA’s analysis of its accident-incident database showed the risk of death
or injury increased by 4-5 times if
there was a fire or explosion, compared
to incidents without a fire or explosion.
The agency also said the revision would
make the natural gas pipeline incident

reporting requirement consistent with
the reporting requirement for hazardous liquid pipelines.
The committee noted that examples
of newly reportable events included
house fires in which the fire eventually involves the gas meter and minor ignitions during inspection and
maintenance. The American Public Gas
Association asserted the change would
have resulted in a huge increase in the
number of reportable incidents, giving
the appearance distribution pipeline
safety has deteriorated.
APGA said PHMSA should not revise
the definition of reportable incident.
In comments filed with PHMSA, APGA
pointed out that before 1984 such
fire-only events were reportable and
resulted, in PHMSA’s words, in an “unproductive paperwork burden.”
The American Gas Association maintained newly included incidents would
artificially inflate the number of natural gas distribution incidents reportable
to the US Department of Transportation. It cited PHMSA estimates that
incidents would rise to 300 from 210
while its own analysis estimated more
than 5,000 events would be reported
under the new criteria. AGA also said
PHMSA had underestimated the paperwork burden associated with collecting
the new information. PHMSA estimated
paperwork would increase by 1,140 hr.
AGA estimated an annual paperwork
increase of more than 27,000 hr.
AGA concluded it was unreasonable
for PHMSA to collect fire-related events
when these events were already collected by another government agency, are
primarily outside of PHMSA’s jurisdiction for distribution incidents, are not
within the control of the operator, and
would artificially and negatively affect
the natural gas industry’s safety record.

Correction
In the article “Black Sea region stands at energy crossroads,” by Vlad Popovici, Fig. 2 (OGJ, Dec. 7, 2009, p. 57) contained errors. The correct version of the
figure appears here. The corresponding figure has been updated in the electronic version of the story available at www.ogjonline.com.
An error also occurred in the text of the story. The correct version of the
affected text reads as follows: Ukrtransnafta, operator of the Ukrainian oil
pipeline system, stopped Russian oil shipments in one of its main pipelines in
October 2009 for several weeks, forcing Lukoil’s Black Sea Odessa refinery to
halt activity. Ukrainian press sources also claimed the country started to import
oil directly from Azerbaijan through its Black Sea ports.

Oil demand lift
from icy weather
not a sure thing
Shouldn’t a cold Northern Hemisphere
winter give oil demand, struggling to recover from recessionary doldrums, a huge
lift? Maybe not.
Yes, heating oil users have been burning more of the fuel than they would have
in warmer weather. But the effect on total
demand is muted.
The International Energy Agency’s Oil
Market Report for February points out

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

that heating oil consumption patterns are
changing in the developed nations of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD).
“The share of oil for heating and power
generation in the OECD has been shrinking
uninterruptedly over the past decade,” IEA
explains. “Other energy sources, notably natural gas, renewables, and nuclear
power, are becoming the fuels of choice
for both purposes, displacing both distillate and residual fuel oil.”
In the cold first quarter of last year,
heating oil represented 9% of total OECD
oil demand, IEA points out. In the early
1990s, the share was 15%. In the past 15
years, OECD first-quarter heating oil demand has fallen by a third.
“Even if first-quarter 2010 proves to be
as cold as first-quarter 2009,” IEA says,
“the heating oil surge—and the concomitant fall in distillate stocks—predicted by
many observers is unlikely to materialize.”
A distillate drawdown would lower oil
in inventory from unusually high levels,
easing a downward force on oil prices.
IEA projects average OECD heating oil
demand of 3.7 million b/d in the first quarter this year, 13% below the first quarter of
2009.
In its assessment of the trend underlying this outlook, IEA is not alone.
The Centre for Global Energy Studies,
London, in a Feb. 3 report notes difficulties
in isolating demand boosted by icy December and February from effects of the
global recession. It sees early indications
of a weather-related demand bump.
Overall, however, oil demand is becoming “less seasonal by the year,” CGES
says.
“Indeed, these days the hurricane
season in the western Atlantic can have a
more pronounced effect on oil prices than
a cold winter as a result of storm-induced
damage to the extensive oil and gas infrastructure in the US Gulf of Mexico.”

EIA may underestimate gas demand
The US Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration may be
underestimating natural gas demand with much of the US South and Northeast
enveloped in yet another round of cold weather that boosted gas and electricity
demand in January through early February, said Adam Sieminski, chief energy
economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC.
The March natural gas contract climbed 10.4¢ to $5.40/MMbtu Feb. 11 on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, “the largest 1-day gain since the beginning of
the month,” on “a drop in jobless claims, indicating industrial demand, which
accounts for 29% of US [gas] consumption, is likely improving, and cold temperatures across the US likely resulting in higher residential demand,” said analysts at
Pritchard Capital Partners LLC in New Orleans.
On the US spot market that same day, gas at Henry Hub, La., gained 3¢ to $5.51/
MMbtu. Gas prices continued rising to $5.47/MMbtu in the Feb. 12 session on
NYMEX and to $5.55/MMbtu at Henry Hub as continued snowfall buried parts of
the Northeastern US and the Mid-Atlantic states. Meanwhile, EIA reported January heating degree-days in the South Census Region—where 60% of households
use electricity as the primary space heating fuel—were 13% higher in January
than a year ago. Consequently, residential electricity sales in the South region also
increased by about 12% to an average of 2,250 Gw-hr/day, “and a good part of this
electricity was generated with natural gas,” Sieminski said.
He noted that EIA estimated gas consumption by the entire US electric power
sector jumped by more than 8% in January from the administration’s preliminary
estimate during that month. EIA’s short-term energy outlook published in the week
ended Feb. 12 estimated a new record for gas consumption by the electric power
sector for January. “However, the EIA is reluctant to give up on its view that an
increase in coal-fired generation capacity and higher natural gas prices through
the remainder of the year should reduce the share of natural gas-fired generation
in the baseload power mix in 2010.” Sieminski said.
Data indicate a minispike in electric utility gas use during January before dropping off in February and March. Similarly, residential use in the EIA forecast is
shown lower in this year’s first quarter than the similar period in 2009.
“Could the EIA be underestimating gas demand?” Sieminski asked. “News
reports this week show a severe and very unusual winter snowstorm across the
South from Dallas, Tex., to Atlanta, Ga. This appears to be the same type of weather pattern that caused the unusual rise in electric utility gas use in January. Other
parts of the US are also getting hit hard with cold, windy weather that boosts gas
use in home heating. March might also be exceptionally cold across a large section
of the central US.” Analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners said, “Land drilling activity both in the US and abroad continues to move higher. The outlook for natural
gas over the next 12 months, specifically in the US, is highly debatable.”
Colder March forecast
Deutsche Bank’s meteorologist Corey Lefkof is calling for unusually cold temperatures across much of the central US in March. His forecast is for another frigid
month in the US, with data suggesting a 15-20% colder March compared with
10-year average temperatures. He said the “major meteorological themes from the
winter so far” should extend into March as “the robust negative Arctic Oscillation
and negative North Atlantic Oscillation signatures hold into mid-March” along with
“a decaying El Nino in the Pacific that has traditionally lead to colder than normal
US conditions as the Pacific jet calms down and allows more Canadian and polar
air masses to influence the pattern.”
EIA reported the withdrawal of 191 bcf of natural gas from US underground
storage in the week ended Feb. 5. That reduced working gas in storage to 2.2 tcf,
up by 172 bcf from year-ago levels and 114 bcf above the 5-year average. “After
last week’s relatively colder weather, the blizzard that blanketed the Mid-Atlantic
this week, and forecasts for colder weather in late February, we could see significant withdrawals from [gas] storage over the next couple of week,” said analysts
in the Houston office of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
On the other hand, Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, said, “The
transportation fuel demand destruction that is associated with the record snowfall in the US East Coast should turn into greater-than-expected stock builds of
gasoline and diesel, which given the limited storage capacity available pressures
the cracks….”

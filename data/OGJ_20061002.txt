EU energy production drop forces higher imports
While the total amount of energy required to meet the demand
of the 25 European Union countries in 2005 remained the same
as in 2004 at 1,637 million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe), a 4.5%
fall in EU energy production from all sources pushed up its dependence on imports to 56% from 54%, according to Eurostat, the
EU’s statistical office, in its first 2005 estimates.
Crude oil production decreased by 9%, gas production by 5.8%,
coal by 5.7%, and nuclear energy by 1.3%. The UK accounted for
70% of the oil produced, followed by Denmark 15%, with production falling in both countries by 11.4% and 3.8%, respectively.
The UK also was the EU’s largest natural gas producer, with 44%
of total production, followed by the Netherlands at 32%. In both
countries production fell by 7.7% and 5.9%, respectively.
Oil accounted for about 60% of the EU’s net energy imports,
and gas for 25%. Net crude imports and products rose by 2.9%,
while net gas imports rose by 9.2%.
Eurostat has determined that energy consumption per capita in
the 25 EU member states was equivalent to 3.6 toe in 2005, compared with 7.8 toe/capita in the US and 4.1 toe/capita in Japan.
But consumption varies greatly from one member state to another,
reflecting economic development, the degree of industrialization,
and climates.

SEC, former Willbros exec settle bribery charges
The US Securities and Exchange Commission said it reached an
agreement on Sept. 14 with Jim Bob Brown, who formerly worked
for a Willbros Group Inc. subsidiary, to settle charges that he violated antibribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
In a civil action filed in Houston federal court, SEC also alleged
that Brown circumvented internal controls and falsified records
while he was a supervisor in Willbros’s Nigerian operations.
It said that Brown participated in three separate schemes to
bribe foreign officials in Nigeria and Ecuador.
The complaint alleged that in February and March of 2005,
Brown procured $1 million on behalf of a Willbros affiliate, which
he delivered as partial payment to Nigerian government officials
and to employees of a joint venture majority-owned by a Nigerian government division. It said he also assisted in paying another
$550,000 to satisfy earlier commitments.
Second, in return for Willbros receiving a $3 million contract,

Exploration

Brown allegedly assisted in a scheme to pay $300,000 to officials
of an oil and gas company owned by the Ecuadorian government,
according to the complaint.
Finally, it said, Brown knowingly assisted a long-running
scheme in which employees of Willbros affiliates fabricated invoices to procure cash from the company’s Houston headquarters for
bribing Nigerian tax and court officials and for other purposes.
Brown neither confirmed nor denied the allegations in the settlement. Pursuant to the judgment, the court will determine, at a
later date in response to an SEC motion, whether Brown will have
to pay a civil penalty, the federal agency said.

DOE to support CO2 EOR at Citronelle, Ala.
A project to inject carbon dioxide into Alabama’s largest oil field
to improve recovery and later store the greenhouse gas will have its
costs shared by the US Department of Energy.
DOE plans to provide nearly $3 million of the $6 million cost
of the enhanced oil recovery project in Citronelle field operated
by Plano, Tex.-based Denbury Resources Inc. in Mobile County 25
miles northwest of Mobile. The project could recover 64 million
bbl of oil, DOE said.
The University of Alabama-Birmingham proposed the project
to DOE. After economic oil production ceases, it calls for storage
in the reservoir and adjacent formations of CO2 produced from the
combustion of fossil fuels in power plants and other processes.
Southern Co., Atlanta, one of the country’s largest electricity
generators, is evaluating the capacity of such reservoirs as possible
locations for permanent sequestration of CO2 separated from coal
and natural gas combustion products in its power plants, DOE said.
Project goals are to provide oil field operators and CO2 producers
with improved estimates of the oil yields from EOR and the capacity of depleted reservoirs to sequester CO2. Another objective is to
improve reliability of computer simulations of the oil yield and
sequestration capacity of a given geologic formation and the rate at
which CO2 can be injected.
Other project participants are the University of Alabama-Tuscaloosa, Alabama A&M University, Huntsville; Geological Survey of
Alabama; and the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.
Denbury also plans CO2 EOR injection projects in Tinsley and
Eucutta fields in Mississippi. The natural CO2 to be injected will
originate in that state (OGJ Online, Nov. 28, 2005). ✦

Western Oil Sands exploring Kurdistan tract
A unit of Western Oil Sands, Calgary, has begun exploring a
914,000-acre block in Kurdistan southeast of Kirkuk under an exploration and production-sharing agreement with the Kurdistan
Regional Government Sulaymaniyah Administration.
WesternZagros Ltd., seeking conventional oil and gas in the Zagros fold belt, has identified three large structures from satellite
imagery and noted that the block has active oil seeps and oil shows
in water wells. The subsidiary ran a preliminary 2D seismic survey
in late 2005. The block lies 60 km southeast of and on trend with
the southeastern edge of supergiant Kirkuk oil and gas field. The
identified structures, Bawanoor, Kalar, and Shakal, are each more
than 25 km in length.
The agreement, to become law after passage by the unified government, requires a $45 million work commitment that includes
geological and geophysical programs and exploratory drilling.
Drilling could begin as soon as late 2007.
Western Oil Sands has assigned the block 1.7 billion bbl of riskadjusted potential. The company has a 20% interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Alberta, with Shell Canada Ltd. holding
60% and Chevron Canada Ltd. 20%.

Dana Petroleum logs gas pay with Babbage well
Dana Petroleum PLC, Aberdeen, has reported the successful

MMcfd of gas.
Each of the 17-18 wells drilled has produced or tested oil or
gas, but only two oil wells have been on sustained production because of the capacity of the 4-in. oil pipeline to Alberta.
The regulatory process has slowed the rate at which new wells
can be drilled, Paramount said, and the field is the company’s second lowest site for 2006 capital spending.
The company started producing gas in March 2002 and oil in
April 2003 and has seen practically no decline in the oil rate. It
placed a third well, J-74, on production last winter at 500 b/d.
Oil and gas are found in structural and stratigraphic traps in the
Middle Devonian age Slave Point, Sulphur Point, and Keg River formations (OGJ Online, June 18, 2004). The field lies just northeast
of the northwest corner of Alberta. ✦

BP gets DOT nod to restart Prudhoe Bay ﬁeld
BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. said Sept. 22 it will restart a portion
of the Eastern Operating Area (EOA) of Prudhoe Bay field in order
to run cleaning pigs and conduct an in-line, smart pig inspection
of the oil transit line.
DOT’s approval will allow BP to run the smart pig through a 5mile, 34-in. segment that carries oil from processing facilities on
the field’s eastern half.
The EOA was shut down Aug. 10 following the discovery of a
spill caused by isolated pitting corrosion on Aug. 6 (OGJ Online,
Aug. 10, 2006).
The company has determined that the line can be returned to
service. Three of the four flow stations currently on warm stand-by
will be returned to full production, the company said.
“This is an important milestone in returning all of Prudhoe Bay
to production many months in advance of our complete replacement of 16 miles of oil transit lines,” said David Peattie, BP Group
vice-president for existing profit centers.

The well, drilled vertically to more than 11,000 ft TD, was
spudded July 16 and found gas throughout a substantial Leman
sandstone section. The well flow-tested at 10.7 MMcfd of gas without stimulation. The well will be suspended at the seabed and kept
for use as a future gas producer.
Babbage, with as much as 390 bcf in place in Permian Rotliegend, could be tied back to Johnston 10 km north or Ravenspurn
North 12 km northwest (OGJ Online, Sept. 28, 2005).
Dana holds a 40% interest in Block 48/2a. Partners are operator E.ON Ruhrgas UK North Sea 47% and Centrica Resources Ltd.
13%. Dana called the well’s results “highly encouraging” and the
partnership has already secured a rig for further drilling. Dana said
Babbage field is now thought to be one of the largest undeveloped
gas fields in the UK North Sea.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Results of the smart pig inspection will aid BP and the US Department of Transportation to determine whether to continue operations through the transit oil line or to shift production through
a system of bypass lines currently under construction.
BP has performed tests on thousands of feet of the EOA pipeline
using ultrasonic and other imaging equipment. As added precaution, BP’s start-up plans include an enhanced spill-response contingency plan, in which crews and material will be positioned to
respond if any leak occurs, the company said.
BP said safely restarting the field will take about a week. Resuming full operation of eastern Prudhoe should add about 200,000
b/d of oil production from the Alaskan North Slope. Current production from the rest of Greater Prudhoe Bay is about 250,000
b/d.

Transocean’s Enterprise-class drillship, dedicated to Chevron’s use
for as long as 5 years.
Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. Ltd. will build
the $670 million dynamically positioned, double-hull drillship in
Okpo, South Korea. The rig will have a variable deckload of more
than 20,000 tons. It will allow for parallel drilling operations and
will have a larger, stronger, more efficient top drive than conventional rigs, enabling wells to be drilled to 40,000 ft TD in 12,000
ft of water, Transocean said.
Chevron has the right to convert the 5-year contract to 3 years if
declared by September 2007. Revenues generated during a 5-year
contract period are estimated at $862 million, or $609 million for
3 years.
The contract commencement date is scheduled for early 2010,
and Chevron will take delivery in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the
second drillship construction contract has Chevron awarded Transocean this year (OGJ, Mar. 6, 2006, Newsletter).

ReedHycalog: worldwide rig ﬂeets see growth
Due to improved market conditions influenced by high oil and
gas prices, the numbers of available rigs in the US, Canada, global
offshore mobile, and international land all rose this year, according
to Grant Prideco’s 53rd annual ReedHycalog Rig Census.
Also, “Not only has the market upswing encouraged contractors to reactivate or refurbish their inventory of older units, but rig
building programs have also been established and are now coming
to fruition,” said ReedHycalog Pres. John Deane.
The total number of US rig owners increased by 31 to 257 this
year, as more companies found it economically viable to enter the
market.
The US rig fleet realized a net gain of 13.5% over 2005 figures,
bringing the fleet size to 2,298. This increase includes 391 additions, of which 238 were newbuilds, and 119 deletions.
US fleet utilization levels maintained a record high of 96%, a
1% gain over last year.
The Canadian rig fleet reached a new record high of 799 units,
up from 741 in 2005. The increase included an addition of 63
newly manufactured rigs. The rig utilization for Canada, during the
spring census period, had climbed 10 percentage points to 84%.
For the global offshore mobile rig fleet, 29 additions were realized this year. The fleet rose by a net 13 units to 654. This total took
into account 20 reactivations and 9 new units, as well as losses
due to hurricane damage and retired units. Currently, more than
90 units are on order or under construction, estimates ODS-Petrodata.

Processing
Petrotrin to use UOP technology for upgrades
Petrotrin has launched a 3-year gasoline optimization program
at its 175,000 b/cd Pointe-a-Pierre refinery in South Trinidad.
The program involves constructing or revamping eight major
plants, along with associated utilities and supporting units.
Four of the eight plants will use the proprietary technology of
UOP LLC, Des Plaines, Ill.
UOP will provide technology for a CCR Platforming unit with

The international rig market saw a sharp increase in its overall
utilization rate, which climbed to 95% for land rigs from 83% in
2005. China, Russia, and the former Soviet Union, which were
excluded last year, have reentered the census with 100% utilization. This greatly increased Europe’s and Asia’s overall percentages.
Russia and the FSU added nearly 500 rigs and China added over
1,100 units.

Petro-Canada signs rigs for exploration projects
Petro-Canada has signed several drilling rig contracts over the
next 18 months for work associated with its international exploration program.
The company expects to begin a multiwell exploration and field
development program in the UK North Sea near yearend and plans
to begin drilling in Trinidad and Tobago in 2007, said Nick Maden,
vice-president of exploration.
Maden added, “Work in the Zotti Block in Algeria will start in
the fourth quarter of this year, and we now expect drilling on Block
II in Syria to commence early in the first quarter of 2007.”
Petro-Canada has secured the GlobalSantaFe Glomar Arctic III
semisubmersible to be used in its UK work program, which includes development of Saxon oil field, in-fill drilling in Guillemot
oil field, and three exploration wells, two of which recently were
awarded in the 23rd licensing round. This contract is for 1 year.
Another contract is for Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc.’s Ocean
Worker semisubmersible, which will start a 6-month, multiwell
program on Block 22 in Trinidad and Tobago in the second half of
2007. Also at that time, the Rowan Gorilla III jack up will arrive on
the Caribbean island for a 6-month, four-well program on Blocks
1a and 1b. This contract has an extension option to include an additional two wells.

Eurasia Drilling lets $65 million rig contract
Abbot Group PLC’s land rig design engineering and fabrication
subsidiary Bentec has been awarded a $65 million contract by Eurasia Drilling, formerly the drilling subsidiary of OAO Lukoil, for
four 250-tonne, fast-moving hybrid rigs, derived from Bentec’s
original HR5000 design.
Work is to start immediately, with the first rig slated for delivery in 12 months. The other three rigs are planned for delivery by
yearend 2007.
This latest contract brings to $200 million Bentec’s order intake
so far this year and to ten its number of rigs under construction
(OGJ, Aug. 14, 2006, p. 39). ✦

BP lets contract for coker at Spanish reﬁnery
BP Oil Refineria de Castellon SA awarded a detailed engineering, procurement, and construction supervision contract to Foster
Wheeler Iberia SA for a delayed coker at BP’s 104,500 b/cd Castellon, Spain, refinery.
Terms of the contract were not disclosed. The planned 20,000
b/sd coker will use Foster Wheeler’s proprietary delayed coking
technology. Foster Wheeler is based in Clinton, NJ.
The new coker, scheduled for completion during 2008, is part
of BP’s planned reconfiguration of the Castellon refinery to reduce
residual fuel oil production.
Details of the reconfiguration were not immediately available
for the refinery in Castellon de la Plana, Spain (OGJ Online, July
15, 2002).

Shell lets turbine contract for GTL project in Qatar
A unit of Royal Dutch Shell PLC has let a contract to GE Oil &
Gas for six 42-Mw gas turbines, equipped with dual fuel integrated
gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) combustion systems, for the
Pearl gas-to-liquids (GTL) project in Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar (OGJ, Aug. 7, 2006, Newsletter).
The contract scope includes IGCC combustion engineering,
combustion system lab testing, spare parts, and training.
The gas turbines are capable of burning a range of low-btu fuel
gasses, including a process off-gas derived from the core GTL reactors.
The turbines will be installed in the 140,000 b/d Pearl GTL
plant in a cogeneration configuration that will produce 180 Mw of
electric power for use in the facility.
Natural gas is the backup fuel, and will be used for plant startup.
Steam injection will be used to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.
The first gas turbine unit will be required to meet power requirements during the commissioning of the GTL facility, scheduled to begin commercial operation by 2009-10. The six units are
scheduled for shipment in late 2007 or early 2008. ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Terminal problems delay Sakhalin-1 oil exports
The head of Russia’s Federal Service for Ecological, Technological, and Nuclear Monitoring announced that Exxon Neftegas Ltd.,
operator of the Sakhalin-1 project, will not be able to start shipping
Sakhalin oil for export until it has satisfied objections regarding
construction of the oil terminal in the port of Dekastri.
“In violation of the law, the Dekastri oil terminal was being
built in accordance with adjustments and additions made in the
feasibility study before they were confirmed by experts in industrial safety,” said Konstantin Pulikovskiy. “There are problems. One
could open the terminal, but the problems must be resolved.”
Pulikovskiy said he hoped the consortium developing the
Sakhalin-1 project would correct the violations made during the
construction of the Dekastri oil terminal in Khabarovsk Territory
before the start of oil exports, scheduled for early October.
“We’ll work to keep up with the schedule. The project is in place
and must be implemented,” Pulikovsky said when asked whether
the problems could be resolved before the start of first exports. Two
100,000-tonne tanks in Dekastri are reported to have been filled
with crude oil ready for export.

China proposes LNG terminal in Rizhao
China and EurOrient Financial Group have signed an agreement
for construction of an LNG receiving terminal and related facilities
in Rizhao City in Shandong province.
The proposed terminal is one of only 10 LNG projects to be
commissioned in China along the coastal cities for the next 10
years by the state council.
The Rizhao terminal will have an initial capacity of 1.5 million
tonnes/year of LNG. It will include a transshipment terminal and
one or two storage tanks, pipelines, and gas distribution facilities. It
will supply gas to Rizhao City and the greater Qingdao territory.
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

With estimated cost of more than $965 million, the project will
be financed and developed in phases. The first phase will handle as
much as 500,000 tonnes of LNG. EurOrient is considering various countries as suppliers, including Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Qatar, Oman, and Russia.
Pending receipt of a construction permit by December 2007,
construction of the terminal is expected to start during first quarter
2008.
EurOrient said it is considering the Rizhao Lanshan Port as a
possible location for the terminal.

Second Iran-Armenia gas pipeline on the horizon
In a visit to the Armenian capital of Yerevan, Iran’s parliamentary speaker Gholam-Ali Hadad-Adel said his country wants to build
a second natural gas pipeline to Armenia, according to the news
service AFP.com.
This would augment a $220 million pipeline now in the last
stages of completion and due to start up in January to deliver about
36 billion cu m over a 20-year contract.
Earlier in 2006, Armenia maintained that the 140-km pipeline
was being built with an OD of 48 in., despite Russian pressure to
reduce its OD to 28 in. The pipeline covers 100 km in Iran, with
the balance traversing Armenia.
Until now Armenia has depended solely on Russian gas rather
than importing hydrocarbons from closer Azerbaijan. That trade is
prevented, said the news service, by the long-standing dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh enclave in Azerbaijan.
The report said Armenia will compensate Iran in part for the
costs of the first pipeline with deliveries of electricity from a Soviet-era nuclear power plant. ✦

Energy and tax reform
The US oil and gas industry can improve both
its standing with a hostile public and energy
policy by seeking reform in an area not directly
related to energy: tax policy.
The connection with energy is indirect but
strong. Congress implements energy policy largely
through the Tax Code. The Energy Policy Act of
2005, for example, created tax credits for purchases of hybrid vehicles, home energy-efficiency
improvements, small producers of biodiesel and
ethanol, and the manufacture of energy-efficient
appliances and hybrid and alternative-fuel vehicles.
It offered a deduction for fuel cells installed in
buildings. It created tax incentives for the production of various kinds of energy. It offered so many
tax incentives for so many kinds of energy and
behavior that it’s impossible to tell what it actually
did for energy, other than please people able to
profit from the gimmicks.

Tax complexity
Compounding the confusion is an altogether
incomprehensible and always-changing set of
tax statutes. In fact, complexity partly explains
why simplification efforts never progress very
far. Because most US taxpayers understand little
about how the government affixes its claims to
their wealth, they naturally fear that change might
deepen the bite. Meanwhile, special interests never
rest, so tax law becomes ever more complex and
opaque.
Energy policy implemented through tax incentives can only founder in tax law this messy. The
oil and gas industry has a chance to make things
better because the mess soon will worsen.
Since 1969, the US has operated a parallel income tax system to ensure that clever rich people
don’t escape the financial obligations of citizenship. Now enshrined in the alternative minimum
tax (AMT), the system is approaching an expansion likely to jolt many Americans out of their
ambivalence toward tax law.
The AMT applies taxation rates lower than
those of the normal income tax but allows fewer
deductions and exemptions. Taxpayers who might
be subject to AMT must calculate liabilities under
both systems and pay whichever is greater.

When enacted in 1978, the AMT was supposed to apply to a relatively small number of very
wealthy people. But that’s changing rapidly, reports
Alan D. Viard, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas senior
economist and research officer. From UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center data, Viard predicts in
the bank’s August Economic Letter that the number of Americans subject to AMT under current
law will jump to 4 million this year from 200,000
in 1990. In 2007, it will leap to 22 million.
Taxpayers newly susceptible to AMT aren’t
millionaires. According to Viard, taxpayers with incomes of $200,000-500,000/year are most likely
to pay AMT. In 2010 and 2015, the share of AMT
taxpayers with incomes of $100,000-200,000 will
become “quite high.”
Reasons are complicated for this rapid encroachment of taxation aimed at the very wealthy
into the upper middle class. Unlike those of the
regular income tax, the AMT’s brackets aren’t
indexed for inflation. And tax cuts of recent years
have caused AMT liability to exceed normal liability for growing numbers of taxpayers. That trend
will accelerate as AMT exclusions enacted with
some forms of tax relief expire. And in 2007 the
tax-free threshold on the AMT rate schedule will
drop.
In recent years, Congress has delayed the problem with short-term adjustments, many of which
are expiring. It can continue doing so, of course.
It also can repeal the AMT. But both options lower
government revenue. They both increase in fiscal
difficulty as AMT liability spreads.

Increasing discontent
Yet the spread continues, and growing numbers of taxpayers are finding themselves subject to
complexities and tax surprises designed for much
wealthier people. Discontent with the Tax Code
can only increase in the next couple of years, putting tax reform once again at the center of politics
in a presidential election.
For the oil and gas industry, that’s an opportunity. There’s no need to advocate one form of tax
reform over others. It would please a disaffected
public for the industry just to show shared interest
in the need for change. If the effort succeeded, it
also would improve energy policy. ✦

POINT

OF

VIEW

A set of techniques known as vector
seismics has migrated from research to
practice, changing how geophysicists
study the subsurface and improving
information about the physical characteristics of oil and gas reservoirs. Leon
Thomsen, who becomes president of
the Society of Exploration Geophysicists
at the group’s annual meeting this
week, has helped
this once-esoteric
idea become a
practical tool of
geophysics.
Twenty years
ago, Thomsen wrote an article in SEG’s
technical journal, Geophysics, that
proved to be fundamental to vector
seismics and that SEG identified last year
as the most frequently cited work in the
profession. Since then, the subject has

developed to the point that Thomsen,
principal geophysicist and senior advisor in the Exploration and Production
Technology unit of BP America Inc.,
now predicts, “In the future, all geophysicists will be vector seismologists.”
With experience in both research
and application of vector seismics,

geophysics.” Yet he holds a view of the
role of research in oil and gas companies that’s not wholly in line with pessimism often expressed on the subject.
An appreciation for Thomsen’s
perspective requires an understanding
of how vector seismics is influencing
geophysical work and how the concepts
have evolved.

Reshaping geophysics
Vector seismics advances a well-established trend in which seismic techniques provide information not only
about locations of boundaries between
subsurface rock layers but also about
physical characteristics of the rocks
themselves, such as lithology, fluids,
fracture content, and pore pressure.
The general trend progresses as
geophysicists learn to extract more and
more information from seismic reflection data. Vector seismics
treats a seismic wave as a
propagating package of
particle displacements,
with both magnitude and
direction, instead of as a
simple pressure pulse.
Conventional seismic
work focuses on the
compressional mode of
the seismic wavefield,
or “P-waves,” in which
material vibrates in a
direction parallel to the
direction of propagation.
Until recently, exploration
geophysicists have paid
much less attention to shear waves, in
which material vibration is perpendicular to the direction of propagation, and
to converted waves, which are shear
waves generated upon reflection of a
downward-moving P-wave.
Conventional P-wave analysis is scalar, depicting reflection time, location,
and signal strength without indicating
the vector direction of particle motion
within the wave. Scalar P-wave analyses
therefore omit important information
about the wavefield—and thus about

subsurface features.
Thomsen’s 1986 article
laid the foundation for work in this area
by clarifying the concept of anisotropy.
The traditional assumption, he explains,
had been that subsurface media are
isotropic for sonic propagation, meaning that the velocity at which sound
energy moves through them is the same
regardless of the direction of travel. Yet
velocity fundamentally is a vector (with
both magnitude and direction) rather
than a scalar, like pressure (with magnitude only).
“Casual inspection of any sedimentary outcrop reveals a layered sequence,
indicating that the velocity must be
different in different directions: that is,
that velocity is anisotropic,” Thomsen
says. On closer inspection, “one usually
finds joints and cracks, further indicating that the velocity must vary in all
directions.”
The crucial point: “Seismic waves
propagate as vectors. If we don’t take
full advantage of that in our acquisition practice and our theory and our
processing and our interpretation, then
we’re just missing out on some of the
information content that they’re bringing back.”
Vector concepts are both enriching the reservoir information available
from interpretation of seismic data and
improving established seismic tools.
One such tool is amplitude variation
with offset (AVO), in which interpreters infer rock type and other reservoir
characteristics from observations of
how reflection signal strength (amplitude) changes in relation to the distance
between seismic energy sources and
receivers (offset).
Until recently, most AVO has been
based on isotropic assumptions. But the
increasing use of wide-azimuth seismic surveys, in which source-receiver
offsets cover a wide range of directions,
has produced data that challenge the
isotropic view.
“We normally find that there is an
azimuthal variation with AVO, that the
AVO response changes with a change in

Crystals are all anisotropic. Maybe, he
thought, anisotropy, contrary to normal
assumptions, could be at work in subsurface media, too.
During the next couple of weeks,
Thomsen worked out the concept eventually published in his famous 1986
article.
“What we were seeing in these 2D
sections was an expression, in stacked
2D data, of what we now call AVO,” he
explains. Because the data were stacked,
with reflection values from recordings
at different offsets combined to improve signal-to-noise ratios, “We didn’t
see the angular variation with offset.
But we saw how that summed up in the
stack.”
The researchers also saw that the

t’s not a foregone conclusion. But
it is possible that the Democrats
will regain control of at least the US
House of Representatives in November’s election. The question then
would be the extent to which the
congressional energy agenda would
change.
Unlike many other issues, energy
can be bipartisan, particularly when
it comes to oil and gas. The division
more frequently is between producers and consumers than political parties. Republican Bobby Jindahl and
Democrat Charlie Melancon agree
that Louisiana should get a share of
revenue from federal leases off their
state.
Nevertheless, the emphasis would
change in the House because Democrats would schedule hearings and
move legislation if they became the
majority party. A bill to authorize oil
and gas leasing in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge obviously would face
more obstacles, for example.
But the House also might become
less aggressive in its Outer Continental Shelf leasing reform proposals and
accept the Senate’s more focused bill.
High storage levels may keep natural
gas prices from climbing very far before the election, while gasoline prices
have fallen so far since Labor Day that

crats introduced what they called the
“PROGRESS Act.”
The bill would establish a national energy security commission, to
develop national goals, a Manhattan
Project-style center to create an advanced vehicle efficiency consortium,
and a national biofuels infrastructure
development program.
It also would try to improve
biofuel transportation by stimulating
domestic freight railway investments
and require federal and state governments to use more biofuels, develop
biofuel plants across the country, and
speed development of standards to
promote alternatives to oil.

Products reserve

House Democrats also responded
to rapidly climbing gasoline prices
late last spring with a promise to revive their proposal to create a strategic products reserve as an alternative
to a Republican-backed bill to ease
refinery permitting, which eventually passed the full House and awaits
Senate action.
They also appear more likely to
propose moving investigations and
prosecutions of alleged oil product
price-gouging from the states to
the federal government. Bart Stupak

Venezuela, Iran sign
series of energy accords
Peter Howard Wertheim
OGJ Correspondent
Venezuelan and Iranian officials on
Sept. 17 signed a series of accords, including deals to develop oil fields, build
factories, and set up a $2 billion investment fund to finance the projects.
The agreement is part of Venezuela’s
24-year, heavy oil development plan
during 2006-30 centered within the
Orinoco Oil Belt, with an extension of
some 210 sq miles. The Orinoco Belt
is south of Guárico, Anzoátegui, and
Monagas states.
Petroleo de Venezuela SA estimates
that the 20,077 sq mile Orinoco Belt
area contains 235 billion bbl of crude,
which, added to the country’s current
81 billion bbl in proved reserves, could
elevate Venezuela’s reserves to 316
billion bbl. Proved Orinoco reserves
previously were estimated at only 36
billion bbl.
“We are in a program that should
wrap up in November 2008,” PDVSA
Pres. Rafael Ramirez Ramirez said.

field’s development on Ayacucho Block
7, which extends for 500 sq km. Initial
studies had indicated the existence of
31.2 million bbl of original oil in place,
of which Petropars expects to recover at
least 20%, or about 6 million bbl.
Petropars’s well MFK-4E is about 125
km from San Tomé. PDVSA has invested
$1 million in drilling well PDV No. 2,
which will quantify reserves. With the
drilling of these two first wells under
the Orinoco Magna Reserve Project,
Venezuela began the process of quantifying and certifying its Orinoco Belt oil
reserves on Sept. 21.

PDVSA partners
The extensive Orinoco Oil Belt is
divided into 27 blocks within four
areas—Carobobo, Ayacucho, Junin, and
Boyaca (see map, OGJ, Nov. 21, 2005,

p. 54). PDVSA is certifying these blocks
alone or in partnership with overseas
companies.
In contrast to past policy, the country
will exploit the Orinoco Belt oil in joint
ventures with many international oil
companies. Foreign oil companies currently working in the Orinoco Belt areas
include ExxonMobil Corp., ConocoPhillips, BP PLC, Total SA, Statoil ASA, and
Chevron Corp.
In participating in Venezuela’s energy
development, Petropars joins IOCs such
as Uruguay’s state oil firm Administration Nacional de Combustibles, Alcohol

Repsol YPF SA of Spain, Brazil’s stateowned Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Argentina’s Energía Argentina SA, China’s

state-owned China National Petroleum
Corp., India’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp.,
and Belorusneft Production Association
of Belarus.
Venezuela recently reassured foreign
oil firms that they could keep majority
stakes in projects refining heavy crude
from the Orinoco Belt, but reiterated
that the state would control upstream
work with a stake of at least 51%. ✦

A softer tone
on Sakhalin-2

N

o one would actually accuse
Russia of backtracking, but last
week its minister of natural resources
said his country had no intention of
removing an operating license from
Royal Dutch Shell PLC for the Sakhalin-2 development project.
To be sure, Yuri Trutnev said his
ministry would conduct a fresh
investigation of Shell’s compliance
with environmental regulations. But
he played down concerns that the
undertaking would halt the project.
“There is no question of removing the license because of the result
of the investigation,” Trutnev said.
“The inspection should only examine
whether the operator is abiding by
environmental protection legislation,
not the other aspects of resource use
in Sakhalin region or offshore.”

“Russia should realize that attempts
to politically manipulate international
energy projects could backfire by
causing serious harm to the world’s
trust in the country as a reliable supplier of energy,” the paper said.

Japanese politicians made themselves heard, too. Japanese Chief
Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe even

its approval of the development project might have an adverse effect on

Brazil to invest heavily in gas production, LNG imports
Peter Howard Wertheim
OGJ Correspondent
Heavy investment in Brazil’s natural
gas industry by state-owned Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) is resulting in
a growing use of gas in the country’s
energy mix, particularly in gas-fired
thermoelectric plants.
Gas use rose to 8.9% in 2004 from
7.7% in 2003 and underwent a further
hike to 9.3% in 2005. Projections are
that it will represent 11% in 2010 and
15% in 2015.
At the Rio Oil & Gas Expo in Rio de
Janeiro, Petrobras’s Gas and Energy Director Ildo Sauer affirmed that the company is the main investor in Brazil’s gas
industry and will continue to undertake
increasing investments—alone or in

partnership with private firms—to raise
domestic production and imports of gas
and to upgrade existing infrastructure.
According to Sauer, these investments and the importation of LNG will
prevent a gas supply shortfall, particularly since Bolivia in May nationalized
its gas sector, which exports 26-28 million cu m/day of gas to Brazil.

Supply, demand
Of the average 41.13 million cu
m/day of gas consumed during January-July of this year, 2.6 million cu
m/day was used for cogeneration, 24.1
million cu m/day was for the industrial sector, and 7 million cu m/day for
electric power generation. Another 5.99
million cu m/day was consumed in the
automotive sector, 625,000 cu m/day

in the residential sector, 539,000 cu
m/day in commercial establishments,
and 185,000 cu m/day for CNG.
During 2006, Petrobras’s average
gas production has been 49 million
cu m/day, of which 75% is associated
gas. Sauer pointed out, however, that
since 1995, the output of nonassociated
gas has increased by 7.5%/year. For
example, last year Petrobras produced
37.3 million cu m/day of associated gas
and 10.7 million cu m/day of nonassociated gas, compared with 16.1 million
cu m/day of associated gas and 6.1
million cu m/day of nonassociated gas
in 1995.
Sauer estimates that by 2010, some
63.5% of gas produced will be nonassociated.
Petrobras and its partners will invest

Upstream costs keeping pace with oil prices, study says
Oil and gas companies’ global upstream spending climbed to $277 billion in 2005, up 31% from 2004, said
the latest annual review of upstream
performance by John S. Herold Inc. and
Harrison Lovegrove & Co. Ltd.
Investment levels set a record for the
third consecutive year, yet capital investment still lagged cash flow for a fifth
consecutive year.
Cash flow increased 32% to $322

CNR to buy Anadarko Canada in $4.24 billion deal
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.
(CNR) plans to buy Anadarko Canada
Corp. (ACC) for $4.24 billion. Anadarko
is keeping its interests in the Mackenzie
Delta and other Canadian arctic frontier
properties.
In other recent company news:
• Tullow Oil PLC, London, has
agreed to acquire Hardman Resources

process.”
The CSEM method offers exploration companies the opportunity to
distinguish between water-filled and
hydrocarbon-filled formations, as well
as to determine the size and extent of
the hydrocarbon-bearing structure. It
can also provide extremely valuable
information on the level of gas saturation, overcoming a pitfall in the seismic
method that gives a seismic amplitude
response at even very low, noncommercial gas saturations.
OHM’s advanced processing techniques produce detailed images of the
location of resistive bodies than can
lead explorers to identify locations of
hydrocarbons. With CSEM, the subsurface geoelectric structure is revealed.

How CSEM works

of other resistive features, such as tight
limestones or volcanic structures, can
complicate the interpretation.
In all cases a presurvey assessment
is made to determine whether or not
a CSEM survey is appropriate, and the
design of the survey must take into account what that assessment reveals. The
data collection is relatively straightforward, and the real value comes in the
processing and interpretation.
34

Dr. Lucy MacGregor, chief scientific
officer with OHM, said, “This is not
a one-size fits all process. Each survey
must be carefully planned, taking into
account the survey objectives, to ensure
that the optimum dataset is collected.
Postsurvey, we take great care in the
analysis and interpretation to arrive at a
geoelectric section or volume, providing intuitive images that the client

A high powered electromagnetic
source is towed through the water
transmitting a low-frequency signal
to the seabed, and electromagnetic
receivers placed on the seabed detect
the resulting signal at offsets of up to
10-15 km.
Data are interpreted in one, two, and
three dimensions through a combination of geophysical inversion and
imaging, to provide geoelectric cross
sections and volumes, and hence to
map complex reservoir structures in
subsurface structures anywhere from a
few meters to several kilometres depth
(Fig. 1).
Traditionally, CSEM surveys were
limited to more than 300 m of water
because of the interaction of the transmitted signals with the air in shallow
water (the “airwave problem”). Research at OHM funded by a consortium
that included Total, BG, Shell, Eni, and
Chevron, with UK’s Industry Technology Facilitator has largely removed this
limitation.
This work culminated in a successful
trial on the Nuggets-1 reservoir in the
UK North Sea in summer 2005 in 116
m of water, demonstrating that CSEM
data could be collected in water shallower than previously thought possible.

New extended-reach
drilling projects are driving the development of
innovative technologies
and changing operating
Drilling
practices.
BP PLC is funding
the design of a new land rig that can
drill to 40,000 ft on the North Slope
and Statoil ASA is planning to overhaul
three platforms and begin extendedreach drilling at Gullfaks in 2007. Royal
Dutch/Shell will also drill an extendedreach development well in the UK
sector of the North Sea from one of its
existing platforms.
Technology-savvy operators have
used extended-reach drilling around
the world, beginning with BP’s successful Wytch Farm wells in 1995 (Table 1).
Other European ERD projects include:
RWE-DEA AG’s wells from the Mittelplatte rig in northern Germany; Maersk
Olie og Gas AS in the Dan field off Denmark; Statoil in the Sleipner field and
Norsk Hydro AS in the Oseberg field off
Norway.
In Asia, ERD successes have attracted
enough attention to warrant a separate
conference, in Kuala Lumpur in November 2005:
• Frank de Lange and Jack Pearse,
engineers from Shell Todd Oil Services
(STOS) discussed risks and best practices drilling New Zealand’s longest wells
at the Pohokura field, off the North
Taranaki coast.
• Magne Heggoe, drilling superintendent for ConocoPhillips China,
presented best practices for ERD in the
Xijiang field in the South China Sea.
ConocoPhillips has set records in the
Xijiang 24-3 field, and the successes are
particularly notable because some were
drilled before rotary steerable technology was commercially available.
• Tang Hai Xiong, drilling department manager, and Wei Hong An, technology supervisor for China National
Offshore Oil Corp. Ltd., explained how
ERD extended the life of CNOOC’s
Lihua field in the South China Sea (OGJ,

Woodside Energy Ltd. has used
ERD to develop the Goodwyn field in
Australia. The company switched from
invert-emulsion drilling muds to esterbased drilling muds for its extendedreach wells a few years ago because they
provided better lubrication to reduce torque and
drag.
ERD is not widespread in South America,
although Total, as operator of the Consortium
Cuenca Marina Austral,
drilled very long ERD wells in the Ara
and Kaus fields off Tierra del Fuego in
Argentina. In 1997-98, Total drilled six
extended-reach wells from the Alfa Sur
onshore base into the Ara West field, 610 km offshore. Halliburton assisted in
the Cullen Norte well, drilled in 1999,
with a 34,850-ft horizontal displacement.

Challenges
Operators choose ERD to reduce the
environmental impact and costs of installing additional platforms or building
artificial gravel islands.
But extended or extreme-reach wells
must be designed to overcome the drag
and friction on drill pipe and casing
posed by long, horizontal sections.
Drilling rigs must have the power
and hook-load capacity to handle the
weight of long drill strings and a robust
hydraulic system with sufficient pump
capacity to provide and process large
fluid volumes. Rigs drilling recordlength wells often have four, 1,600-hp
pumps.
Longer drilling times in ERD mean
that the borehole is exposed for a
longer time, leading to potential
hole instability. Drilling equipment
and operating procedures should be
modified to reduce drilling and openhole time.

Lars Christian Bacher said the company
plans to use ERD at Gullfaks.
Statoil will modify three platforms
and begin a 20-year exploration and
development program with four extended-reach exploration wells in 2007.
The wells are on the periphery of the
Gullfaks area, near the Epidot and Alun
discoveries.
Statoil, Halliburton Corp., and
Prosafe Offshore Ltd. have already been
successful using underbalanced techniques to improve drilling performance
from the Gullfaks C platform in summer 2004.
Bacher said Statoil expects the ERD
program to increase Gullfaks oil recovery to 69%.

Now BP is evaluating extendedreach drilling in the Liberty field from
a shore-based drilling site (OGJ, Nov. 7,
2005, p. 8).
Extended-reach wells planned from
a Liberty land site would greatly expand the BP “drilling envelope” with
equivalent departures beyond 40,000
ft and total vertical depth of about
11,500 ft.
BP’s record-length departure is currently the M-16Z well in the Wytch
Farm field, drilled to 37,001 ft MD
with a horizontal displacement of
35,196 ft in 1999 (Table 1). The well
had an ERD ratio (measured depth to
vertical depth) of 6.89; the highest ERD
well drilled to date, worldwide. (Recent
Chayvo wells approach the two longest
Wytch field wells in length, but the

In early August, Parker Drilling announced that it was selected by BP to
design a new drilling rig for the Liberty

the rig must be able to drill wells out

the uncertainties inherent in core and log data.
Elimination of these uncertainties will
help optimize the development of oil
and gas fields.1
Uncertainty means that a variety of
outcomes may occur. The final result
may be greater or less than expected. In
the petroleum industry, deviations from
expectation may have serious financial
consequences.
Despite its importance, considerable
confusion exists as to the best practice for calculating uncertainty. Making a decision on uncertain data alone
is insufficient. The decision requires
estimating all parameters contributing to the uncertainty and then adding
them together in a way that displays the
confidence level.

conformance to those requirements.

Total quality management is a business philosophy that seeks to release the
organization’s potential to identify and
eliminate customer problems, enhance
business processes, and increase customer satisfaction. Total quality management involves active participation of all
personnel including subcontractors and
is critical to the success of any business.3
Logging companies provide a concrete and specific product, information,
or data. A log is a product that needs
quality attributes. The product provides
measurements that differ from the true
value of the formation. This difference
is called accuracy (Fig. 1).
Logs cannot match completely the
user’s requirements at the design stage.
In addition, the product delivered in the
field does not fit strictly with the one

delivery of a “no-hassle” product.
The analysis must clearly define strategies for taking core plugs. Taking plugs
on a rigid statistical basis every foot
to avoid selection bias yields measurements on long sections of nonreservoir
rock and measurements on heterogeneous plugs having mixed lithologies
and crossbedding.
Cores provide an understanding of
the reservoir rock and can calibrate
the porosity derived from logs such
as density. One question is why spend
money to measure nonreservoir rock? It
is much better to cut good quality plugs
in potential reservoir rock. The average
properties are then correct for the net
column but not for the gross column.
The choice of a core analysis contractor is important because different laboratories will obtain different
answers for the same type of measurement on the same rock.
Steps taken by the industry to
standardize the results range from
recommended practices to test plugs
and more recently to the adoption and
accreditation of quality management.
A useful alternative to these steps
would be a more widespread use of
laboratory check plugs. These provide a
representative quality statement about
the laboratory.
A wide variety of related but different experiments derive the required
core parameters. Each test has both positive and negative attributes. Effective
communication of these attributes is
essential for making informed choices.
Before an analysis, a major factor in
acquiring good core data is a critical assessment of how representative are the
samples. For example, X-ray visualization techniques can ensure that plugs
are cut in the correct orientation and
are free of unrepresentative features or
misoriented permeability barriers that
can affect flow out of proportion to
their influence in the reservoir.
The assessment of X-ray images of
cores enables the nondestructive evaluation of intervals for subsequent core
analysis measurement. The technique
allows for the identification and avoid42

requirements, and the quantity required
at different stages of field life
Because every field is different,
fit-for-purpose data requirements vary
from field to field and even from reservoir to reservoir within a field. Fit-forpurpose data during a field’s life cannot
be put into a simple checklist of log,
core, and pressure, and flow tests on
specific wells on specific dates.
Adequate reservoir characterization
requires representative reservoir data.
A difficulty arises when it is unclear
whether a problem is a data-related

issue or whether the interpretation is
incomplete.
Sensitivity analyses can quantify the
impact of potential errors. A measurement of whether a valid interpretation
of good data has been made is the
comparison of predicted vs. actual production and pressure responses. When
they match, it is reasonable to conclude
that the analysis has provided a valid
reservoir description. Thus, the analysis
does not require any more of this type
of data.6
Aspects that frequently require attention for a successful development

Fit-for-purpose data
A successful development plan requires that attention
be paid to data coverage (x, y, z), dynamic and static data,
data quality, and integration and reconciliation of different
measurement scales.
Data coverage (x, y, z) and quantity involve knowing if the
data:
• Capture and describe reservoir heterogeneity and ﬂow
unit continuity.
• Are from crestal or downdip wells.
• Include aquifer data.
• Include wells with sufﬁcient spacing to ensure that
ﬁeld characteristics distinguish different scales (geologically, petrophysically, and hydraulically) and allow for the
construction of meaningful maps.
• Include 3D seismic.
• Solve the problems of geophysicists, reservoir geologist, and reservoir and simulation engineers.
• Indicate the validity of single-ﬁeld wide values for
cementation and saturation exponents.
• Provide sensitivity parameters for estimating reserves.
Dynamic, static data include:
• Acquiring data for reservoir management purposes
during the ﬁeld life to monitor such parameters as pressure
depletion, ﬂuid movement, water breakthrough.
• Determining if net cutoffs for one part of a ﬁeld are
relevant to other parts and ﬂow units in the ﬁeld.
• Verifying if spinner surveys evaluated the net-to-gross
pay cutoffs.
• Determining if net-to-gross cutoffs evolved based
on production data during ﬁeld life and their impact on
reserves estimates.

include data coverage (x, y, z) and
quantity; dynamic and static data; data
quantity (accuracy and precision); and
integration and reconciliation of different measurement scales.7
The accompanying box lists the
details.

Log interpretation uncertainties
In addition to the most likely value
of hydrocarbons in place, the reservoir
engineer needs to know the uncertainty
of this value.
Two methods for quantifying uncertainties propagated from log data

• Obtaining formation pressure data and determining if
some reservoir zones deplete faster than others and if this
was predicted.
• Determining if baseline pulsed-neutron decay logs
were obtained.
• Determining if permeability studies yield adequate
correlations with well-test results.
Data quality includes:
• Determining the precision and accuracy needed for different parameters.
• Forecasting the accuracy and precision needs (and
hence cost) during ﬁeld life. This may involve more expensive as well as cheaper techniques and data.
• Identifying any problems in early wells subsequently
solved by modifying data acquisition programs.
• Evaluating if the ﬁeld model is cohesive and reasonable.
Integration and reconciliation of different measurement
scales require:
• Determining if the value of the money spent for
integrating data types and the criteria for determining the
value.
• Reconciling the different scales of measurement.
• Determining if the vertical density and resolution of
data were considered, such as minipermeameter, core plug,
and well tests.
• Integrating ﬂowmeter surveys with data from image
logs, conventional openhole logs, core permeability for
evaluating such parameters as net-to-gross pay.
• Determining whether disagreements in datasets are a
problem of data quality or the quality of its interpretation.

the data so that the reservoir engineer
can take these into account in the evaluation. Uncertainties include:
• Uncertainties on the recorded logs.
Logging vendor information usually
does not permit quantification of these
uncertainties. This point may be taken
into account or might be negligible
compared with the other uncertainties
on the logs.
• Environmental corrections. Most
input parameters for environmental
corrections are rough estimates, and the
equations are often approximate, even
though the correction factors obtained
with equations might be large.

ity units (pu).
Another example is true formation resistivity (Rt) and flushed-zone
resistivity (Rxo) determined from a set
of resistivity logs with the assumption
of an invasion profile (generally a step
profile). The uncertainties of the volumetric log response and the invasion
profile approximation cause an uncertainty on saturations and also on the
porosity, which depends on Rxo.
• Investigation depths. The different
volumes of investigation by each tool
will create interpretation uncertainties. Log interpretation provides results
based on measurements with different

sophisticated program but has a short
computation time.
These analyses estimate the dispersion of the results caused by random
and sampling errors. The deviation from
the true value, caused possibly by systematic errors, is not considered.
A decision concerning a field appraisal or development process must account
for the economic risk connected to the
uncertainty of hydrocarbons in place.
Although most log interpretations
only provide the most likely petrophysical parameter values, the reservoir engineer also needs to know the uncertainty
for these values. A log interpretation
should therefore provide, in addition to
the usual results, the uncertainties for
these values.8 9
Three different ways of managing
uncertainties are:
1. Perform sensitivity tests on each
source of uncertainty to determine
those with the greatest effect and improve their determination and acquisition.
2. Interpret each option or at least
indicate the alternative options, when
the results indicate several possibilities.
3. Compute the final uncertainty

the required intervals, not for each log
sample.
This method uses a deterministic
interpretation algorithm (n equations, n
unknowns).
A log analyst can determine easily
the uncertainty on the input parameters; however, the uncertainty on the
log values must be estimated from
previous experience.
This computation does not include
the uncertainties in the log values.

Analytical method
The analytical method includes an
optimization interpretation algorithm
(n equations, m unknowns, n>m). As in
the Monte Carlo method, the set of the
most likely values of all interpretation
parameters defines the reference solution. A standard interpretation process
provides the results shown in Fig. 5.
An analytical solution computes a
continuous curve of standard deviation

Total drills ﬁrst North Sea well with RMR
Total E&P UK PLC recently used riserless mud
recovery (RMR) technology in a dual-gradient,
top-hole drilling system
to drill a well on the Jura
Drilling
West 3/15-10 prospect.
The recently completed well was drilled with the Sedco 714
semisubmersible rig in 113 m of water
and Total was the first to use the new
technology in the North Sea.
RMR technology was developed by
Ability Subsea AS as a means of recirculating and reusing drilling fluids. Benefits of the technology include cost savings from reduced operating time and
reduced environmental impact from
avoided discharges to the sea. RMR allows for more controlled handling and
disposal of drill cuttings.
Ability Subsea, part of Norway’s AGR
Ability Group AS, provides technology
and services that extend the boundaries of offshore drilling, especially in
geotechnically challenging and environmentally sensitive areas.
RMR technology was recognized
in 2005 with a spotlight award at the
Offshore Technology Conference (OGJ,
May 9, 2005, p. 28). Ability Subsea initially tested the system in the Troll field
off Norway and has been using it in the
Caspian Sea.
The Azerbaijan International Operating Co. (AIOC), operated by BP PLC,
was an early adopter of riserless, dualgradient technology. In early 2004, BP
gave AGR a 2-year, extendable contract
47

to use the system for top-hole drilling
in the Azeri field, to cope with shallow
gas hazards in the Caspian Sea. Wells
were predrilled for Phase 2 of the Azeri,
Chirag, and deepwater Gunashli (ACG)
field development plan, before the
Central Azeri (OGJ, Nov. 1, 2004, p. 9)
and East Azeri (OGJ, Aug. 21, 2006, p.
8) platform decks were installed.
In April 2006, Ability Subsea
presented the technology in China at
a drilling and well service workshop developed by INTSOK-the Norwegian oil
and gas partners and Petrad, a non-prof-

it Norwegian government foundation.
Ability had two RMR units operating in first-quarter 2006 and four units
during second-quarter in the Middle
East and in Russia. The company invested 50 million NOK in RMR equipment
during the first 6 months of the year.
Total E&P UK PLC acknowledged a
significant time savings over the previous technology used to drill similar
26-in. hole sections and regarded the
implementation as successful. The company plans further deployment of the
technology later this year.
Use of the RMR technology is
spreading. It was recently deployed off
Sahkalin Island and in the Barents Sea,
where no drilling discharge is permitted. Other applications have been in
areas of poor hole stability where an
engineered fluid system is required.
One of the main advantages of running
the system, says the company, is the
ability to push planned casing setting
depths deeper and hence simplify casing design.
RMR has been deployed in water
depths of up to 400 m and Ability Subsea has now commenced development
work with two leading oil corporations
to make the technology operational in
water as deep as 1,500 m. The company
plans field trials at these depths for next
year.
In July, Shell Australia contracted
with Ability Subsea to provide RMR
services for its upcoming western Australian exploration. ✦

This article reports
on development of a
methodology for the
back-allocation of natural gas and condensate
at natural gas processing Gas Processing
facilities. This methodology is based on energy
and weight balance equations that use
gas and condensate compositions in

production on points where accurate
measurements are not physically possible or economically practicable.
With natural gas production increasingly important to oil and gas
companies in recent years, the problems of back-allocations to determine
partners’ and owners’ shares of gas and
condensate in the producing reservoirs
have become more important. Several
gas-balancing agreements are currently in use in the industry. Many
of these agreements, however, fail
to address adequately practical engineering problems encountered
in balancing gas production.1-6
These problems include balancing of condensate production
vs. balancing of gas production, owner’s
imbalance at the time of acquisition or
sale, and nomination and allocation to
pipelines and purchasers.
Traditionally, allocation has been
done primarily on the basis of energy
content.7 8 This article, however, presents
another methodology for allocation of

the export pipeline, matching previously stated specifications.
Condensate collected from the
various processing steps is transferred
to the stabilization step before being stored in the three storage tanks.
Stabilization removes the light hydrocarbons to avoid release in the tanks
and to achieve the rvp specification.
This step is carried out in the stabilizer
tower. Condensate is then shipped from
the storage tanks via shipping pumps to
El-Hamra.

Back-allocation for Salam
The following actual example for
the Salam gas plant allocation illustrates
application of the allocation proce50

dure just described. Fig 2 presents the
material-balance block diagram for the
gas plant, showing every stream and
measuring point involved.
At the plant’s inlet (Fig. 2) are connected the feed streams of Qasr and
Salam wells. The gas or the condensate
production rates for each field (Salam
or Qasr) cannot be separately measured.
The total gas and condensate rates of
Salam and Qasr wells together, however,
can only be measured with totalizers
(198.225 MMscfd and 9,984 b/d).
Therefore, the first task in the calculations was to determine separately the
gas and condensate production rates of
Qasr and Salam at the inlet streams of
the Salam plant using the energy-bal-

ance equations as described below.
1. Table 1 shows the calculation for
the total energy of the gas and condensate produced from Qasr and Salam
wells at the inlet separators of Salam
plant. It is about 261,755 MMbtu.
2. Distribution of the gas and condensate production rates from natural
Salam wells can be estimated with the
results of the last production rate tests,
as shown in Table 2.
3. Total energy of the gas and condensate produced from Salam wells can
be calculated with the compositions
data of the Salam wells, as shown in

Costs for the five equipment items that
make up the Nelson-Farrar miscellaneous
equipment cost index were mixed during
2004-05. The miscellaneous equipment
index average rose to 1,073.5 from 959.8
in the 24-month period.

The greatest increase among the components making up the equipment average was that of heat exchangers, which
increased to 1,079.2 in December 2005
from 732.7 in January 2004.
Engines increased only slightly during
the period. Instruments gained 46.0 dur-

ing the 2004-05 period examined.
Electrical machinery dropped to 509.6
in December 2005 from 516.4 in January
2004.
The pumps and compressors average
increased to 1,721.8 in December 2005
from 1,557.3 in 2004. ✦

I TEMIZED REFINING COST INDEXES
The cost indexes may be used to convert prices at any date to prices at other dates by ratios to the cost indexes of the same
date. Item indexes are published each quarter (first week issue of January, April, July, and October). In addition the Nelson
Construction and Operating Cost Indexes are published in the first issue of each month of Oil and Gas Journal.

A N S P O R T A T I O N
Gasunie has utilized
external corrosion direct
assessment (ECDA) as
proposed by the
National Association of Corrosion
Pipelines
Engineers (NACE)
as a valuable
method of assessing the corrosion threat in unpiggable
pipelines.
Structural-reliability
analysis (SRA) combined
with Bayesian statistics
make it possible to quantify the results of an ECDA
process. This combined
method allows automatic
adjustment of the expected number
of both coating and corrosion defects
based on the results of two aboveground surveys (one for the detection of
each).
The method makes it possible to use
the results of excavations to adjust the
following variables:
• The probabilities of detection and
of false indication of each survey technique.
• The time of initiation of corrosion
defects and the defect density.
• The corrosion rate and the defect
depth.
Adjusting these variables allows
the probability of failure of the pipeline being inspected to be calculated
and updated on a per-kilometer basis.
This updating process can in turn be
performed after each (x) number of
excavations, until the system reaches
a sufficiently low probability of failure, allowing the integrity manager to
minimize the number of excavations
required.
Gasunie has been implementing this
approach as part of its pipeline integrity
management system, PIMSlider, during
2006. Gasunie intends the approach to
be an integral part of the system, providing access to all relevant data of both
the pipeline under investigation and

direct assessments performed on other
pipelines.

History

Gasunie owns roughly 12,000
km of high-pressure pipeline in the
Netherlands, most of which were built
between 1960 and 1980. Aging of the
grid has led increasingly to spots with
coating degeneration and reduced wall
thickness caused by both corrosion
and mechanical damage. Gasunie also
detected microbiologically influenced
corrosion (MIC) on the grid in 1999.
These circumstances led Gasunie’s
asset-management department to reexamine its pipeline management policy
in order to maintain a high standard on
risk and integrity control. Gasunie concluded that a change from verification
of preventive measures to verification
of the actual condition of the pipelines
was required.
This conclusion resulted in the introduction of two strategies:
• Integrity management: to comply
with prescribed governmental requirements and restrictions on the integrity
of the assets; to prioritize and perform
preventive activities; and to monitor the
actual condition of pipelines.
• Risk management: to realize and
preserve the environmental integrity
of the pipeline within acceptable (or
agreed) levels and to prioritize and
perform mitigating activities.
These strategies led to the intensification of Gasunie’s in-line inspection
(ILI) program to 5-10 ILI runs/year,
resulting in a significant increase in
the amount of inspection data needing
analysis.
Gasunie implemented a new IT solution (PIMSlider) to allow efficient and
reliable data processing and support all
pipeline integrity-management processes.
Since only 50% of Gasunie’s pipelines are conventionally piggable, it
decided in 2005 to develop a computerized direct-assessment module for
PIMSlider, enabling integrity analyses

described in NACE RP0502-2002.1
This first of two articles focuses
on the direct assessment module of
PIMSlider, currently being developed
by Gasunie in cooperation with Andrew Francis & Associates Ltd. (AFAA),
Derbyshire, UK, ATP Ltd., Hampshire,
UK, and ATP Neftegazsystema, Gomel,
Belarus. The concluding article will
detail the ECDA results for a section of
Gasunie line.

PIMSlider
The PIMSlider system consists of
a number of modules, the center of
which is Slider.2 The modules cover the
spectrum of data management (pipeline, environmental, and incident data),
CP system monitoring data, analyses of
ILI data, defect assessments, and quantitative risk calculations with consideration of the economics involved.
The Slider module stores all pipeline-related data concerning position,
equipment, crossings, operational data,
ILI data, maps, photographs, population
density along its route, etc. It mainly
provides information retrieval. The operator can track relationships between
various data points (Fig. 1) and schedule actions accordingly (surveys, repair,
maintenance, etc).
The CP Expert module allows the operator to analyze the effectiveness and
the efficiency of an existing CP system.
A modeling function supports the CP
engineer in the design of the CP system
in case of construction or modification of a pipeline. CP Expert uses data
from Slider. It also allows calculation of
the optimum operation mode for CP
stations, ensuring reliable and effective
protection of the pipeline.
The Gasunie Pipeline Incidents
Database (GDLI) contains all pipeline
incidents that have occurred on the Gasunie grid. The GDLI module analyzes
these incidents.
Inpipe enables the analysis of any
kind of pipeline defect or other feature
drawn from data provided by ILI tools.
This involves linking the features to
map coordinates and accurate positioning of the in-line data along a 3D

model of the pipeline. The software
calculates the remaining strength of the
pipeline using the methods of ASME
B31G and RSTRENG.
The Rehab Expert module allows
the operator to assess the significance
of defects in the pipeline and to define
the most appropriate repair program.
Either defect-geometry data, as reported
by the ILI contractor, or raw data from
inspection tools (such as individual
sensor signals) can provide the basis for
assessing defects. Using more than one
ILI program allows comparison of the
same defect at different stages of its lifetime, enabling the operator to optimize
the economics of inspection and repair.
The PSL module provides the core of

objects and the pipeline environment.
Operational experience, expert opinion,
and industry experience quantify the
likelihood of all threats, with calculations performed for all pipeline sections

substantially by applying statistics.
In practice, parameters concerning
the geometry of the pipeline (e.g., WT)
or material properties (e.g., flow stress)
are also associated with uncertainties,
especially in the case of older pipelines.
The DA module treats these quantities
as probability density functions as well,
rather than using constant values.
The model can also calculate the
probability that a single defect will fail,
depending on the age of the pipeline
and the uncertainties described earlier.
Guidelines from the Linepipe Corrosion Group-sponsored JIP, developed
through a combination of analysis and
full-scale testing, predict the failure

length of each ECDA region. Gasunie
indirect inspections for ECDA purposes
usually consist of:
• Direct Current Voltage Gradient
(DCVG) survey to detect and pinpoint
coating defects along the pipeline.
• Close Interval Potential Survey
(CIPS) to measure both the pipeline’s
on-off potentials and the on-off potential gradients to remote earth. These
measurements determine whether a
possible coating defect is sufficiently
protected by the CP system.
• Wenner measurements to measure
the soil resistivity at regular intervals
along the route.
• dGPS measurements to measure
the position of coating-defect indications, soil resistivity, and characteristic
features along the pipeline.
Fig. 3 shows a typical survey team.
In this approach, CIPS does not detect
coating defects but instead assesses
corrosion activity at possible anomaly
locations detected by DCVG. Francis
et al., however, produced complete
derivations for the use of 1 or 2 coating
surveys or 1 coating and 1 corrosion
survey.
The lack of a 100% reliable inspec-

tion technique requires that the performance of the inspection tools used is
also taken into account, including other
variables such as type of coating, soil
conditions, and depth of cover.
Two variables characterize tool performance:
• Probability of Detection (PoD):
the probability that a defect present is
detected by the survey technique.
• Probability of False Indication
(PoFI): the probability that the survey
technique gives an indication where no
actual defect is present.
Indirect inspection consists of:
• Data storage. The data from the
aboveground surveys are stored in a
database for processing and future
reference.
• Data processing, interpretation, and
visualization. If required, the data from
the surveys can be corrected for factors
such as the depth of cover and currents
through the pipeline.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Chavez employs
‘ﬁshing model’
of geopolitics
Call it the live-bait ﬁshing model of geopolitics: ﬁrst the gift, then the gaff.
Terrorist groups use the technique in
the Middle East, ingratiating themselves to
the hard-pressed with medical and other
services (the gift) even as they murder noncombatants they don’t like (the gaff).
The groups answer complaints about
the gaff by pointing to the gift.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

With a less deadly gaff, Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez is ﬁshing in the US.
State-owned—meaning Chavez-dominated—Petroleos de Venezuela SA is selling
heating oil at discounts through its Citgo
subsidiary to poor people in the US. The
program began last winter after Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita disrupted Gulf Coast reﬁning and raised fuel costs.
Citgo crows about it in a brochure on
its web site entitled “From the Venezuelan
Heart to the US Hearths” and featuring a
photo of a sympathetic Chavez with this
message: “We are all americanos, and
together we share the Bolivarian mission of
giving hope and a better life to the poorest
and most vulnerable, whether they live in
Venezuela or Vermont.”
Who can argue against aid to the poor?
But with the gift of cheap oil comes a gaff.
In a Sept. 15 speech at the United Nations, Chavez called US President George
W. Bush “the devil.” In a later speech in
New York, he said he hopes Americans elect
“an intelligent president” and insisted he’s
a friend of Americans other than those in
the government.
The Venezuelan president, of course, has
been wooing his country’s neighbors with
cut-rate oil and anti-Americanism for many
months.
Traveling to the US to spit the venom
was especially galling, however. If Chavez
hoped to co-opt political opponents of Bush
in the US, the ploy didn’t work. Democrats,
including House Majority Leader Nancy
Pelosi of California, greeted the UN gaff as
a gaffe. Pelosi called Chavez an “everyday
thug.”
Citgo, of course, is free to sell all the
cut-rate oil Chavez wants it to in the US.
Sensible Americans will take the gift and
ignore the politics behind it.
As long as the gaff is only bone-headed
rhetoric, they can afford to.

Crude prices test $60/bbl ﬂoor
The October contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes fell $2.14 to $61.66/bbl
Sept. 19, the lowest closing since Mar. 21 and the largest 1-day price drop since May
15 for a front-month contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The fall followed a speech to the United Nations in which US President George
W. Bush appeared to back away from trade sanctions against Iran over its uranium
enrichment program. However, Kevin Book at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc.
(FBR), Arlington, Va., cautioned against “relying exclusively on the public words of
a national leader trying to curry favor with a room full of diplomats; we saw a much
stronger tone [against Iran’s nuclear program] articulated by the Department of State
during a Senate hearing that took place immediately prior to the president’s UN address.”
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad “may have seemed less inﬂammatory”
in his response to Bush’s speech. “But it certainly was not suggestive of a truce,”
Book said. “It is too soon to dismiss the Iran risk premium to crude oil. We agree
that odds of an Iran-imposed embargo on its export oil appear to remain low (the
US may be addicted to using oil, but Iran’s government is addicted to selling it, and
Ahmadinejad will not win greater support from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei by
wrecking Iran’s economy). By the same token, we see several potential ﬂash points
for sanctions that could emerge from either multilateral (UN) negotiations or...the
US Congress, and either one could prompt an escalation of Iranian rhetoric.”
The October crude contract expired at $60.46/bbl Sept. 20. On that same date,
the November contract dropped $1.43 to $60.74/bbl, but it recovered to $61.59/bbl in
the next trading session on NYMEX. “Oil seems to be stabilizing amid speculation
that a $60 price may be the trigger-point for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to constrict supply,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James
& Associates Inc. on Sept. 22. The slight rebound in crude prices at the end of that
week also was fueled by market suspicions that low reﬁnery margins may induce
companies to undergo larger-scale maintenance projects. “This is sparked by reports
of multiple reﬁnery shutdowns in Texas,” the analysts said
OPEC no longer has a speciﬁed target range of prices for its crude. However,
Iran’s oil minister recently said he would like to see crude prices remain above $60/
bbl.
The Energy Information Administration said US crude inventories fell 2.8 million
bbl to 324.9 million bbl during the week ended Sept. 15. Gasoline stocks increased
by 600,000 bbl to 207.6 million bbl, while distillate fuel inventories jumped by 4.1
million bbl to 148.7 million bbl. The average US reﬁning margin “declined from a
high of $23.50/bbl on Aug. 2 to $7.40/bbl as of Sept. 19 (the 2003-05 average was
$10.70/bbl) due to rising inventories of reﬁned products, which have increased by 9%
since the beginning of May,” said Jacques Rousseau, senior energy analyst at FBR.
Gas prices retreat
Natural gas futures prices retreated on NYMEX through much of September because of a milder-than-expected hurricane season and a faster-than-normal build in
US gas storage to nearly full capacity. On Sept. 21, the EIA reported the injection of
93 bcf of natural gas into US underground storage facilities in the week ended Sept.
15. That was above the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts but down from
the previous week’s injection of 108 bcf, with total US storage at almost 3.2 tcf. The
October natural gas contract traded at $4.60-4.93/MMbtu Sept. 21 before closing at
$4.78/MMbtu, down 15¢ for the day on NYMEX.
Robert S. Morris, Banc of America Securities LLC, New York, said, “We continue to
believe that the near-term ﬂoor for natural gas prices will likely be set by parity with
coal prices wherein some utilities could scale back coal-ﬁred electric generation and
switch to natural gas-ﬁred units. Currently, a drop in natural gas prices to parity with
coal, speciﬁcally Central Appalachian coal in the Northeast, would put Northeast
prices at about $4.25-4.50/MMbtu, per our assessment, or a composite spot equivalent of $3.75-4/MMbtu.”
Some industry contacts indicated switching may have already occurred, with
some utilities—mostly in the Midwest—“‘turning off’ their oldest and least efﬁcient
coal-ﬁred plants in favor of starting up full-cycle natural gas-ﬁred plants or purchasing natural gas-ﬁred power generation on the open market, although the exact
amount is hard to quantify,” Morris said.
If demand for less expensive natural gas increases while production decreases as
US storage ﬁlls, gas supply may again tighten, analysts said.

“InnerArmor just changed the whole picture
in inside coating. Un-believable!”
New InnerArmor™
It’s an amazing new
way to coat the
inside of just
about everything...
From half-inch parts
to production pipes!
Exceptional corrosion protection
InnerArmor is an entire family of advanced
coatings. They are super-hard and
smooth— and also extremely resistant
to corrosion, erosion and wear. The
multi-layered coatings are amorphous,

pinhole-free and uniform—even across
extended lengths.
Excellent return on investment
InnerArmor protects your assets and
extends their life. So you can reduce
downtime significantly and cut
maintenance costs dramatically.
Plus, a reduced coefficient of
friction improves fluid dynamics
and reduces fouling. That means
less energy to pump product.

You’ve got to see this for yourself!
Sub-One Technology developed this new
patented technology and makes it available through a global network of licensed
coating providers.
If you’re a coating
provider seeking to
qualify, please call us.

Managing E&P Growth with Limited Resources
The 2nd annual Offshore Asia (OA) Conference & Exhibition is scheduled for 16 - 18 January 2007 at
the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Building on the success of last year’s
conference, Offshore Asia will feature presentations on the key issues affecting the Asia Pacific exploration
and production activity. Over 1,000 people and 60 exhibitors are expected from the energy centers of
the Asia Pacific area, including Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, China, Australia, New
Zealand, and India.
Offshore Asia Conference and Exhibition brings the latest advances in this rapidly expanding offshore
marketplace. The conference theme “Managing E&P Growth with Limited Resources” examines the latest
advances in deepwater exploration and production in this ever expanding, dynamic region.
Expanding economies in Malaysia, India, China, and all of Southeast Asia are creating enormous demand
for oil and gas. As a result, offshore exploration and development activity in the Asia Pacific arena is rapidly
increasing beyond all historical levels for the foreseeable future.

Offshore Asia Mission Statement
To facilitate the open exchange of technology, ideas, best practices, and lessons learned that impact
exploration and production activity in the greater Asia Pacific region.

Offshore Asia
2007 Exhibit Space Agreement

™

16-18 January 2007 ● Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre

1. Offer and Acceptance. Exhibitor’s submission of the 2007 Exhibit Space Agreement form, with or without a deposit, shall constitute an offer from Exhibitor to enter into such Agreement with
PennWell Corporation, acting through its PennWell UK Group (“PennWell”). Such offer can only be accepted by PennWell’s signing such Agreement at PennWell’s place of business in Tulsa,
OK, USA or Upshire, Essex, UK. After signing in Tulsa or Essex, PennWell will send to Exhibitor a fully signed copy of the one-page (front and back) Agreement document, which sending shall
constitute PennWell’s acceptance and cause the Agreement as a whole to become effective.
2. Arrangements of Exhibits. Exhibits shall be so arranged as not to obstruct the general view nor hide the exhibits of others. Plans for specially built displays not in accordance with these
Exhibition Rules and the regulations set forth in the Exhibitor Service Kit must be submitted to Show Management before construction is ordered and/or begun. The Exhibitor Service Kit
will be supplied to Exhibitor approximately four months before the Exhibition. With or without prior inspection, Exhibitor understands that by signing the 2007 Exhibit Space Agreement
form, Exhibitor agrees to be bound by the Exhibitor Service Kit, which shall form part of the Agreement.
3. Soliciting/Photographs. Exhibitor is prohibited from distributing (i) literature, souvenirs, or other items from outside the boundaries of Exhibitor's booth, and (ii) literature, souvenirs, or
other items that are other than Exhibitor's own materials; in each case, unless Exhibitor has obtained Show Management's prior written approval. These prohibitions apply before, after,
or during Exhibition hours. Canvassing in exhibit halls or distribution of advertising matter, souvenirs, or any other items whatsoever by anyone who is not a paid exhibitor is strictly
forbidden. Exhibitor is prohibited from taking photographs of other exhibits or other aspects of the Exhibition, without Show Management's prior written approval. Exhibitors may
photograph only their own booth(s).
4. Exhibitor Personnel and Others. Technical specialists, qualified to discuss engineering details of their products, must man booths at all times during Exhibition hours. Show Management reserves the right to prohibit an exhibit or part of an exhibit that, in Show Management’s sole discretion, may detract from the character or nature of the Exhibition.
5. Remedies. If Exhibitor fails to make any payment or otherwise breaches any provision of the Agreement, and fails to cure within a reasonable time (as defined in the next sentence)
after Exhibitor has received written notice from Show Management specifying the breach, Show Management shall have the right to exercise (without further notice) any one or more of
the following remedies at any time after such reasonable time has passed: (i) cancel the Agreement in whole or in part; (ii) evict Exhibitor from any or all of the space being rented by
Exhibitor; (iii) have any of the Agreement's violated provisions specifically enforced; and/or (iv) exercise any other remedy available by rule of law. "Reasonable time" means: (i) immediately in the case of any breach occurring during the Exhibition; (ii) 24 hours, in the case of any failed payment and (iii) 5 days, in the case of any other breach. In addition, Show Management may keep any and all monies received from Exhibitor as liquidated damages, it being understood that PennWell's losses and damages from Exhibitor's breach of the Agreement as
well as a precise value for services provided by PennWell prior to the conclusion of the Exhibition are difficult to ascertain and that the agreed liquidated damages are not intended and
may not be construed as a penalty. Upon cancellation of the Agreement, Show Management may (without prejudice to any other available remedy) rent Exhibitor's space to any other
exhibitor, or use such space in any other manner as Show Management deems necessary, in its sole discretion, without any obligation to Exhibitor.
6. Unoccupied Space. If any of Exhibitor's space remains unoccupied on opening day of the Exhibition, Exhibitor shall be deemed to have abandoned such space. Thereafter, Show
Management shall have the right to rent such space to any other exhibitor, or use such space in any other manner as Show Management deems necessary, in its sole discretion, without
any obligation to Exhibitor. This Section shall not be construed as affecting the obligation of Exhibitor to pay the full amount specified in the Agreement for space rental.
7. Liability. Neither Show Management nor its agents or representatives will be responsible for any injury, loss, or damage that may occur to Exhibitor or to Exhibitor's employees, invitees,
licensees, or guests, or Exhibitor's property, from any cause whatsoever. Under no circumstances shall Show Management or its agents or representatives be liable for (i) any special,
indirect, incidental, or consequential loss or damage whatsoever, or (ii) any loss of profit, loss of use, loss of opportunity, or any cost or damage resulting from any such loss. Exhibitor
acknowledges that the risk allocations of this Section are reasonable based on the understanding that Exhibitor shall obtain, at its own expense, adequate insurance against any such
injury, loss, or damage. Show Management shall not be liable for failure to perform its obligations under the Agreement as a result of strikes, riots, acts of God, or any other cause beyond
its control. Anyone visiting, viewing, or otherwise participating in Exhibitor's booth or exhibit is deemed to be the invitee, licensee, or guest of Exhibitor, and not the invitee, licensee, or
guest of Show Management. Exhibitor assumes full responsibility and liability for the actions of its agents, employees, independent contractors, or representatives, whether acting within
or without the scope of their authority, and agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold PennWell, the exhibition hall, and their respective privies, harmless from and against claims resulting
directly or indirectly from the actions or omissions of Exhibitor and/or Exhibitors agents, employees, independent contractors, or representatives, whether within or without the scope of
authority. There is no other agreement or warranty between Exhibitor and Show Management except as set forth in this document and the Exhibitor Service Kit. The rights of Show Management under the Agreement shall not be deemed waived except through writing signed by an authorized officer of Show Management.
8. Insurance. For the term of the Agreement, Exhibitor shall at all times maintain insurance sufficient to cover the liabilities of Exhibitor under the Agreement. The amount and scope of
such insurance shall be reasonably satisfactory to Show Management. Such insurance shall also provide coverage for Exhibitor's contractual obligations to defend, indemnify, and hold
harmless, as stated in the Agreement. Show Management shall be added as an additional insured to such insurance. Exhibitor's insurer shall confirm to Show Management that such
insurance cannot be cancelled or changed without thirty (30) days prior written notice to Show Management. Exhibitor agrees to provide Show Management a suitable certificate verifying
that the required insurance is and will remain in force for the duration of the Exhibition.
9. Force Majeure. In case the Exhibition hall is damaged or destroyed by fire, the elements, or any other cause, or if circumstances make it unreasonably difficult for Show Management to
permit Exhibitor to occupy the assigned space during any part or the whole of the Exhibition, then during such circumstances Show Management, the building management, and their
respective privies will be released and discharged from the obligation to supply space, and Exhibitor will be reimbursed a proportionate share of the booth rental previously received by Show
Management from Exhibitor. PennWell reserves the right to cancel, re-name, or relocate the Exhibition or change the dates on which it is held. If PennWell changes the name, relocates to
another facility within the same city, or changes the dates for the Exhibition to dates that are not more than 30 days earlier or later than the dates originally scheduled, no refund will be due
Exhibitor and PennWell shall assign to Exhibitor such other space as PennWell deems appropriate. In such case, Exhibitor agrees to use such space under the terms of the Agreement.
10. Jurisdiction and Attorney Fees. Should any legal action be commenced to resolve any dispute under the Agreement: (i) Exhibitor hereby consents to venue and jurisdiction in the
federal or state courts located in Tulsa, Oklahoma (headquarters of PennWell), and agrees that no such action may be brought in a forum not located in Tulsa, Oklahoma; and (ii) the
prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of litigation expenses, interest, and reasonable attorney fees, in addition to any other remedy obtained.
11. Taxes and Licenses. Exhibitor shall be responsible for obtaining any licenses, permits, or approvals required under local, city, state, or national law applicable to Exhibitor's activity at
the Exhibition. Exhibitor shall be responsible for obtaining any tax identification numbers and paying all taxes, license fees, use fees, or other charges that may become due to any
governmental authority concerning Exhibitor's activities related to the Exhibition.
12. Cancellations. In the event that Exhibitor wishes to cancel some or all of its allotted exhibit space, Exhibitor may request and Show Management may grant such cancellation, but only with the
following understandings; (i) all cancellations must be requested in writing and addressed to PennWell Petroleum Group at the address below; (ii) Show Management is not required to refund any
portion of moneys (the 50% deposit, full fee, or otherwise) previously paid by Exhibitor; (iii) if Exhibitor's cancellation request is received by Show Management after the Agreement has become
effective, Exhibitor nevertheless agrees to pay the full fee based on the original space requirements, before such cancellation will become effective. Show Management assumes no responsibility
for having included the name of Exhibitor in the Exhibition catalog, brochures, news releases, or other materials.
13. Changes. If Exhibitor requests an increase of its booth space after the Agreement has become effective, Show Management will use reasonable best efforts to accommodate such
request, subject to space availability, additional fee payment, and other circumstances then prevailing. If Exhibitor requests a change that leads to a net reduction of booth space from
original requirements, such request shall be covered by Section 12 above.
14. Other Matters. The Exhibition is owned and managed by PennWell Corporation, acting through its Petroleum Group whose main office is at PennWell 1700 West Loop South, Suite 1000;
Houston, TX 77027 USA. All matters not expressly covered in the Agreement are subject to the reasonable decision of the Show Management, which decision shall be final.
By initialling below, Signer signifies that Exhibitor has read, understands, and agrees to be bound by all the terms and conditions set forth above.

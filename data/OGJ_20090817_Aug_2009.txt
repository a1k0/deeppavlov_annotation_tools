In subsea separation
we’re doing what’s

Total’s Pazﬂor project off Angola represents yet another ﬁrst
for FMC Technologies: It’s the ﬁrst deepwater development
based on full-ﬁeld gas/liquid separation at the mudline.
Three vertical separation systems make it feasible to extract
heavy, highly viscous oil economically from deep Miocene
reservoirs. And that’s only the beginning. Explore the extraordinary potential of our subsea technology with a tour of
four FMC projects in four different deepwater basins. Visit
us now at www.fmctechnologies.com/subseaseparation

Ex-Im Bank to ﬁnance subsalt work off Brazil
Acting through the Export-Import Bank, the US agreed to increase financial support by $8 billion to $10 billion for development of subsalt oil reserves off Brazil.
Ex-Im Bank approved in May a $2 billion preliminary commitment to encourage purchase of US goods and services by Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), which plans to invest $174 billion in development over the next 5 years. Weeks later, Petrobras completed
negotiations with the China Development Bank for a 10-year, $10
billion bilateral credit line.
By the end of this month, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva is expected to present to congress several bills concerning
development of the country’s subsalt reserves, after an advisory
commission submitted its proposals to the president Aug. 5.
According to Energy Minister Edison Lobao, the report advises
designating Petrobras as operator of all new subsalt licenses, which
it would develop through partnerships with international oil companies. Another key measure includes formation of a state-run sub-

Injury rates rise for Canadian pipeline workers
More Canadian pipeline workers got hurt on the job during
2007 than in any other year since 2000, when officials started reporting safety performance indicators, Canada’s National Energy
Board reported Aug. 11.
NEB’s annual report, “Focus on Safety and Environment: A Comparative Analysis of Pipeline Performance 2000-07,” said nearly 2
out of every 100 pipeline workers suffered a serious workplace
injury in 2007. That was nearly double the 7-year average.
The report said possible causes for increased injuries include
employee experience levels, increasing pressure to meet deadlines, worker complacency, and increased pipeline construction
activity.
NEB said it is working to help improve pipeline worker safety,
including hosting safety forums where companies can share best
practices with one another. ✦

Shell’s plan for Beaufort Sea advances

Gulf Keystone ﬁnds oil in Iraq’s Kurdish region

The US Minerals Management Service has received Shell Offshore Inc.’s plan to explore two Beaufort Sea leases and deemed it
complete. The agency now will begin a 30-day review and analysis
of the plan.
The review will include an environmental assessment specific to
Shell Offshore’s exploration plan, the US Department of the Interior agency said. It will decide whether to approve, require modifications, or disapprove the plan once it completes the technical and
environmental review. MMS said Shell Offshore proposes activities
limited to the far western area of Camden Bay, including use of
one drillship with one tending ice-management vessel drilling two
wells over the course of 1 year. The two leases are about 16 and 23
miles north of Point Thompson, Alas.
Shell Offshore obtained the two leases in federal Outer Continental Shelf Lease Sale 195 in 2005 and Lease Sale 202 in 2007, according to MMS. It noted that the sales were included in the 200207 5-year OCS program and were not affected by the recent court
decision on the current leasing program, which sent the 2007-12
program back to MMS for additional environmental reviews.
It noted that Shell Offshore would have to meet Alaska’s coastal
zone management requirements, the US Environmental Protection
Agency’s air and water quality rules, and federal Marine Mammal
Protection Act requirements of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and
National Marine Fisheries Service before MMS would allow activity
to proceed.

Gulf Keystone Petroleum International Ltd. (GKP) reported its
Shaikan-1 well in Iraq’s Kurdish region on Shaikan Block, 85 km
northwest of Erbil, found oil in the Middle Jurassic Sargelu formation at a depth of 1,450-1,510 m.
GKP said preliminary test rates indicate 5,000-8,000 b/d of
21-22º gravity oil with wellhead pressures of 380-295 psi. The
company said the oil’s properties are comparable to oil produced
at Tawke field to the northwest of Shaikan Block.
Exports from Tawke field, operated by DNO, started on June 1
after approval by Iraq’s central government. Production in the first
quarter averaged 1,908 b/d and 5,965 b/d in the second quarter.
GKP plans to use information from Shaikan-1 along with seismic surveys and geological data to evaluate the formation. The
company said its preliminary estimate for the tested interval is
“300-500 million bbl of oil in place.”
In addition to the well test results, GKP said the primary zones
of interest for the Shaikan-1 are the Lower Jurassic Alan and Mus
formations.
GKP said indications are that “these formations will yield additional oil-bearing zones as we drill ahead to our next casing point
at approximately 2,500 m…before subsequently reaching final target depth at 3,200-3,500 m.”
Last month, GKP decided to focus its attention on Kurdistan
and announced plans to seek a buyer for its interest in the Hassi Ba
Hamou Permit in central Algeria.

Jacket, piles ﬁnished for Buzzard platform

Premier Oil brings Shelley ﬁeld on stream

Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd. is set to receive the jacket and piles
for the fourth platform on its Buzzard oil field in the UK North
Sea ahead of schedule. Early installation of the substructure components will reduce the installation and hook-up work when the
topsides and bridge are installed in 2010.
Heerema Vlissingen, one of the fabrication facilities of Heerema
Fabrication Group (HFG), has loaded the jacket and piles onto a
barge to sail to the field, which is 30 miles northeast of Peterhead
in Scotland.
The company won the engineering, procurement, and construction contract in March 2008 to deliver a 3,500-ton jacket and
eight piles that weigh 2,200 tons. The jacket measures 42 x 42 x
124 m and has eight 96-in. piles that weigh a total of 2,200 tons.
Heerema Vlissingen delivered the equipment early because it
had lined up timely procurement and there were no changes to
the design.
The new installation should be equipped to handle 200,000
b/d of crude with up to 500 ppm of hydrogen sulfide. It will also
have facilities for up to three tiebacks.
“In the meantime, HFG’s fabrication facility Heerema Hartlepool is fabricating the 6,000-ton process deck and 500-ton bridge,
due for load-out in March 2010,” said HFG.
Buzzard holds more than 1 billion bbl of oil in place. It is one of
the UK’s largest new North Sea developments of recent years (OGJ
Online, May 1, 2008). Nexen expects that the field will require 27
production wells. Reservoir pressure will be maintained by an active waterflood program using produced water supplemented by
treated seawater when necessary.

Premier PLC has begun producing 31° gravity oil at unspecified
rates from the Paleocene Forties reservoir at Shelley field in the UK
North Sea.
The field has two horizontal production wells completed subsea with downhole electric submersible pumps. The wells are connected via a short flowline and a control umbilical to the Sevan
Voyageur floating production, storage, and offloading vessel.
The company acquired a 100% interest in the field through its
takeover of Oilexco North Sea Ltd. (ONSL) in May this year.
Simon Lockett, chief executive officer at Premier Oil, said: “Prior to Premier’s acquisition of ONSL, the development of the Shelley field had been stopped, and the contract with Sevan had been
terminated. I am delighted that we have been able to negotiate a
new contract with Sevan and, with the support of our key suppliers, restart the development, achieving first production so soon.”
When it reported its new contract for the Sevan Voyageur, Premier said Shelly oil production would exceed 30,000 b/d (OGJ
Online, Apr. 21, 2009).
Shelley was discovered in 1984 by the 22/2-2 well. It is in 95
m of water about 40 km south of the Premier-operated Balmoral
complex.

Murphy Oil brings Azurite ﬁeld on stream

Ghana ports authority prepares for oil production
The Ghana Ports and Harbor Authority plans to begin construction of an oil service terminal at the Takoradi Port in September in
preparation for the start of oil production next year.
About $50 million is needed for phase one of the project, due
for completion in 18 months, which includes pipelay from offshore oil fields to the port. The project also includes construction
of a terminal space for the operations of 10-15 supply vessels.
In connection with the development, Takoradi port authorities
have put in place what they are calling an “immediate master plan”
to reclaim a portion of the sea to serve as a berthing area for the oil
service vessels, which have had to berth at a nearby naval base.
The plan also calls for the dredging of channels and berths to
accommodate larger vessels, as well as increasing warehouse space,
transit sheds, and space for trucks.
Earlier this month, Tullow Ghana Ltd. let a contract for subsea,
well test, and data acquisition services to Expro International Group
PLC for its deepwater Jubilee oil field offshore Ghana, which is due
to start production in 2010 (OGJ Online, Aug. 4, 2009).

Murphy Oil Corp. has started oil production from Azurite
field off Congo (Brazzaville) through what it says is the industry’s
first floating drilling, production, storage, and offloading facility
(FDPSO).
Azurite is on the Mer Profond Sud (MPS) block in 4,500 ft of
water. The FDPSO has storage capacity of 1.3 million bbl of oil and
can process 40,000 b/d of oil. Drilling and completion of production and injection wells continue as production ramps up.
Discovered in 2005, Azurite is Murphy Oil’s first operated development in West Africa.
Azurite, with about 75 million bbl of gross oil, was scheduled
to come on stream in the second quarter of 2009 (OGJ Online,

and the Argonne National Laboratory joined the project, managed
by DOE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, to develop the
software planning tool, which is available on line.
It said that researchers believe the 50-mile wide Fayetteville
shale play, underlying numerous central and eastern Arkansas
counties with more than 2 million acres leased, could become one
of the nation’s most active shale gas production areas.
The risk-management tool lets operators evaluate alternative
sites, identify sensitive areas, and minimize environmental impacts, according to DOE. It said the IPAS software accomplishes

this by providing a map of the intersection of drilling pads, roads,
gathering lines, and other proposed features with sensitive water
locations, existing transmission lines, soil data, and other features.
Operators who use the software can streamline well placement
and infrastructure development permitting, DOE said.
It said researchers estimate that the software can reduce the time
required to locate infrastructure elements by a day or more for at
least 10% of wellsites. Cost savings could approach $2.25 million/
year with a drilling rig day rate of up to $45,000 on 500 wells/
year, it indicated. ✦

Rockies, shale NGLs prompt work at Mont Belvieu 2013 after it gains approval from the country’s National DevelopEnterprise Products Partners LP announced recently plans to
build a 75,000-b/d NGL fractionator at its Mont Belvieu, Tex.,
complex east of Houston. The unit will provide additional capacity
to accommodate growing NGL volumes from producing areas in
the Rockies, the Barnett shale, and the emerging Eagle Ford shale
play in South Texas.
When completed in early 2011, the project will increase Enterprise’s NGL fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu to about 300,000
b/d and net system-wide capacity to about 600,000 b/d.
Enterprise said the project is supported by long-term processing contracts and will be based on the design of its 75,000-b/d
Hobbs fractionator in Gaines County, Tex., that started up in August
2007 (OGJ, June 18, 2007, p. 50; June 23, 2008, p. 50).
“Over the past 3 years,” said Jim Teague, Enterprise executive
vice-president, “our NGL fractionation volumes have increased by
46% to a record 449,000 b/d in second-quarter 2009.
“Our NGL fractionators are operating at or near their practical
limits and we have consistently contracted with third-party fractionators for additional capacity,” he said. With expected growth
in NGL production and demand for NGLs by the petrochemical
industry, “we have seen strong demand for NGL fractionation, storage, and distribution.”
The growing demand for fractionation services is indicated, he
said, by the fact that Enterprise’s Hobbs plant has been operating at
capacity since first-quarter 2008. In fact, “we have even been utilizing our fractionators in Louisiana to offload volumes that exceeded
our available capacity at Mont Belvieu in order to satisfy customer
demands.”

Sinopec, KPC select Zhanjiang for complex
China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) said its joint refining and chemical complex with Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC)
is to be constructed on Donghai Island in Zhanjiang city, near
Hainan.
“From this week, the two sides will start feasibility studies for
the new site and an evaluation report on environmental impact,”
said Sinopec, adding that the new site was chosen after several
months of screening by Sinopec and KPC as well as Chinese and
international consultants.
Sinopec said the $9 billion complex, which will have an annual
capacity of 15 million tonnes, is due for completion by yearend

ment and Reform Commission.
The two firms originally chose the Nansha District of Guangdong’s capital city Guangzhou as the location for the complex, but
local media said they changed plans due to environmental concerns.
Hong Kong’s RTHK Radio 3 said Sinopec and KPC agreed to
move the refinery project on the mainland further away from
Hong Kong after “strong opposition from local green groups and
lawmakers.”
In May, the Kuwait News Agency reported that the refinery project, which also includes a 1 million tonne/year ethylene cracker
unit, will be designed to solely process Kuwaiti crude supplied by
KPC.

HF release at Joliet reﬁnery investigated
The US Chemical Safety Board has sent an investigative team
to ExxonMobil Corp.’s 240,000-b/d Joliet, Ill., refinery following
an Aug. 6 propane and hydrogen fluoride release there. It was the
third HF release CSB has investigated this year, CSB Chairman John
S. Bresland said.
“We are concerned about the three apparent releases of hydrogen fluoride from refinery alkylation units in Pennsylvania, Texas,
and now Illinois that have been reported since March 2009. Because of its high toxicity, any loss of primary containment for hydrogen fluoride is a serious matter,” he said.
CSB has investigators examining a July 19 HF release at Citgo
Petroleum Corp.’s 156,800 b/d Corpus Christi, Tex., refinery. It said
that a similar incident occurred on Mar. 9 at Sunoco Inc.’s 330,000b/d Philadelphia refinery.
The incident at ExxonMobil’s Joliet plant occurred around
12:30 pm CDT when HF and propane suddenly leaked from the
refinery’s alkylation unit, according to CSB.
It said the leak did not ignite, but one operator was transported to the hospital suffering from what were described as serious,
HF-related chemical burns, and was initially reported in critical
condition. A second operator was examined at the hospital and
released.
CSB said the unit’s water deluge system, which is designed to
contain airborne HF releases, was activated, and the alkylation unit
was shut down as refinery employees sought shelter. ✦

Ras Laffan III LNG Train 6 starts production
Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Co. Ltd. III has started up
Train 6. The project, a joint venture of Qatar Petroleum (70%)
and ExxonMobil Ras Laffan (III) Ltd. (30%), expands existing
LNG production operated by RasGas Co. Ltd. at Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar.
Train 6 can produce 7.8 million tonnes/year, matching the capacity of the largest LNG train in the world, also in Qatar (OGJ Online, Apr. 6, 2009). These plants have “sufficient scale to competitively reach markets all around the globe,” said the announcement.
In addition, Ras Laffan III is also building its second 7.8-milliontpy train, Train 7, which the company expects to start up later this
year. Both trains will be supplied by natural gas from Qatar’s giant
North field, with estimated reserves of more than 900 tcf.
Ras Laffan III is part of an investment that includes natural gas
production and liquefaction facilities in Qatar and investments by
affiliates of Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil in 12 new Q-Flex
LNG carriers (210,000 cu m) and the Golden Pass LNG regasification terminal under construction near Sabine Pass, Tex.
Golden Pass is a joint venture among affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (70%), ExxonMobil (17.6%), and ConocoPhillips (12.4%).
Its planned start-up has slipped to 2010 from 2009, partly in response to market conditions and partly the result of damage sustained in September 2008 from Hurricane Ike (OGJ Online, June
18, 2009; July 31, 2009).
Qatar is the world’s largest LNG supplier. Through joint ventures
with Qatar Petroleum, ExxonMobil has an interest in 12 trains in
Qatar to supply LNG to markets in Asia, Europe, and North America.
Ras Laffan III Train 6 is the second 7.8-million-tpy LNG plant
brought online by Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil joint ventures
this year. Last spring, Qatargas inaugurated its two-train Qatargas 2
project (OGJ, Apr. 13, 2009, p. 10).

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

This week also saw closure of a deal between ExxonMobil and
Petronet announced last May for Petronet to purchase 1.5 million
tonnes/year of LNG over 20 years from the project. It marks Australia’s first long-term sale of LNG to India.
It could provide impetus for the other partners to finalize their
separate agreements that so far are nonbinding.
These include Chevron’s agreements with three Japanese utility
companies and GS Caltex in South Korea for about 70% of its share
of the LNG production, and Shell’s reported agreement to sell 2
million tpy over 20 years to PetroChina.
The Greater Gorgon project will produce 15 million tpy of LNG
from three trains on Barrow Island as well as 300 terajoules/day
from a domestic gas plant connected by pipeline to the mainland.

Kuwait Oil Co. wins approval for port plan
Kuwait City Municipality has agreed to grant Kuwait Oil Co.
(KOC) a location in Abu Halifa to establish sea port facilities, according to a senior official.
Municipality administrator Abdullah al-Naumis said the facilities will be built on a 28,300-sq-m area, noting that the request for
the port had been denied in May due to environmental concerns.
The municipality’s approval came after KOC reevaluated the
impact of its port project, taking into account the environmental
concerns, which included residential areas as well as a state-run
coffee shop.
The Abu Halifa location is east of Kuwait’s Al Maqwa oil field,
and just north of the country’s existing oil export facility at Mina
al Ahmadi.
The new port will be built about 300 m from the shore into
the sea and will stretch about 140 m along the shore line, according to al-Naumis, who said that KOC will keep a 30 m buffer zone
between its facilities and any residential areas.

Adriatic LNG receives ﬁrst cargo
Gorgon-Jansz LNG project gains approvals
The Chevron Australia-operated Gorgon-Jansz LNG and domestic gas project proposed for Barrow Island off Western Australia
has received a double boost by first securing final environmental
approval from the Western Australian government and then by receiving confirmation of India’s Petronet LNG as a foundation customer.
The project now only needs Australian federal government environmental approval before the Australian consortium of Chevron
Corp., ExxonMobil Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell PLC moves to a
final investment decision.
Western Australia government approval came after the group
agreed that conditions set by State Environment Minister Donna
Faragher last month will be met.
Consequently the group has earmarked an additional $30 million (Aus.) to the existing $32.5 million commitment to establish
a North West Shelf Flatback Turtle Conservation Program as well as
another $20 million to the $40 million Net Conservation Benefits
program. This brings the group’s total commitment in environmental pledges to $190 million.

ExxonMobil Corp. has delivered its first LNG cargo using the
Dukhan LNG carrier to the 8 billion cu m/year Adriatic LNG regasification terminal 10 miles off Porto Levante, Italy. Adriatic LNG is
the world’s first offshore gravity-based structure LNG regasification
terminal.
Adriatic LNG is designed around a large concrete structure
in 95 ft of water, which houses two LNG storage tanks, a regasification plant, and facilities for mooring and unloading LNG
vessels.
ExxonMobil has invested in proprietary technology in this major facility that will meet 10% of Italy’s natural gas requirements
when it reaches full operational capacity later this year. The terminal will be able to deliver 775 MMcfd of natural gas.
Neil Duffin, president of ExxonMobil Development Co., said,
“Through advanced technologies, project execution expertise, and
economies of scale, ExxonMobil is extending its ability to bring
global LNG supplies to Italy and elsewhere around the world.”
The project is jointly owned by Qatar Terminal Ltd., a Qatar Petroleum wholly owned subsidiary, with a 45% stake, ExxonMobil
Italiana Gas holds 45%, and Edison SPA holds 10%. ✦

Reﬁning capacity needed

________________

12

After reading the article “Reduction
in fuel use puts refiners in bind” referencing a study by Roger Ihne, Deloitte
LLP, “A Tsunami of Change Bearing
Down on the Refining Industry,” one
might think that investing in the future
of US refining would not be advisable
(OGJ Online, July 10, 2009). On the
other hand, without investment in US
refining now, the possibility of achieving
any level of independence from importing foreign oil and finished products is
unfeasible. Because the study by Deloitte
does not comprehend important global
factors affecting the US refining industry, some of its conclusions could be
misleading.
We heard much about “stricter fuel
economy standards” and more efficient
combustion engines in the 1970s and
1980s. Today we have larger family vehicles, the “two SUV’s in every
driveway” syndrome, cool Hummers,
and finally major automobile manufacturers in bankruptcy; so much for
“efficiency” reducing gasoline demand.
As for federal “mandates for blending
ethanol and other biofuels,” the sooner
we realize that unsubsidized production
of these “fuels” is neither efficient nor
economical, the sooner we will focus on
the critical issue of making every barrel
of oil more productive in its yield of
transportation fuels.
The US already imports gasoline—a
lot of gasoline. To project a reduction
in gasoline demand in the US over the
next 15-20 years based on assumptions of government-defined stricter
fuel economy standards and mandates
for the use of ethanol and biofuels lacks
global perspective. It should be more
evident today than ever before that the
economies of the world are deeply
intertwined. We must plan for the future
not only based on our nation’s needs but
on those of other economies. If refining
capacity is shut down and not replaced
by more efficient, complex refineries capable of processing heavy crude oil, tar
sands, and oil shale, the global shortage
of refined petroleum products, especially
transportation fuels, will cause a tsunami
of its own.

Today, over 75% of the world’s proven
recoverable oil reserves are owned by
members of OPEC. The vast majority of
this oil supply resides in the Middle East.
These sources of liquid hydrocarbon are
being depleted at astonishing rates.
The next great source of oil is actually
in the Western Hemisphere. A recent
USGS report estimates that there is 1.085
trillion bbl of recoverable heavy and
natural bitumen oil in known basins
around the world. According to the same
USGS report, over 75% (831.9 billion
bbl) of this next generation oil supply is
contained in basins of North and South
America. This geographic shift in the
location of future feedstock is another
reason to increase refining capacity in
the US.
The importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all sources
cannot be overlooked. Routine refinery
maintenance and periodic upgrades in
both capacity and complexity must include capture and sequestering of harmful emissions. This type of investment
is not new to the refining industry and
affects both the large, Gulf Coast refiners
and smaller boutique operations around
the US. Most refiners would agree that
process efficiency and a sharp eye on operating costs are more important when
trying to maintain or increase margins.
The “golden age” of the modern,
highly efficient refinery is just dawning
and is an essential part of the recovery from the current global recession.
Flexibility and the ability to quickly
respond to change are the trademarks
of the entire oil and gas industry from
the start of wildcat exploration through
the marketing and sale of petroleum
products. Refinery utilization has been
affected more by the increase of heavier,
high sulfur crude oils entering refineries than any economic cycle. Since the
“oil boom” of the late 1970s through
the “bust” and collapse of the industry
in the mid-1980s, the oil industry has
learned many lessons. The reduction in
the number of refineries from 319 in
1980 to 149 in 2000 did not reduce the
total refining capacity of the US. Refineries simply became larger. According to a

Faulty assumption
Analysts at the Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES), London, recently
reported, “The presumption that there
are regular suppliers of oil futures contracts (those oil producers who hedge)
and ‘investors’ who are eager to purchase these contracts, has led the CFTC,
under pressure from the politicians to
do something, to consider placing position limits on investor-speculators and
to review the exemptions from such
limits granted to firms specializing in
certain hedging operations.
“The hope is that the imposition of
such limits on the demand side of the
futures market will lead to lower oil
prices than otherwise would have been
the case—but this is wishful thinking,”
CGES said.
“Speculators, large and small, are
both buyers and sellers of oil futures, as
are the hedgers. Restricting the positions speculators can take when they
wish to go further short will keep
futures prices high. The CFTC’s plan
to provide information on the open
interest positions held by swaps dealers
and hedge funds, along with a close
examination of the efficacy of existing
firewalls between the investment banks’
trading floors and research groups,
seems to us a more sensible move than
interfering with the volumes of contracts held by any specific group of
futures players,” CGES said.
“The guiding principle should be
more transparency and less restraint. As
doctors are always taught: whatever you
do, first do not harm the patient.” ✦

A new deal for Ukraine
An international agreement to help Ukraine
fund its logistically crucial natural gas business is
encouraging but probably insufficient as protection against further interruptions of Russian gas
deliveries to Europe. Given the agreement’s tangled
context, encouraging may have to be enough for
now.
The European Commission on July 31 reported
a package of loans worth as much as $1.7 billion to help Ukraine buy, store, and move gas. The
loans would come from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, World Bank, and
European Investment Bank. EC Pres. Jose Manuel
Barroso said the agreement “should provide the
stability needed to significantly reduce the risk of
a further gas crisis between Ukraine and Russia
and therefore provide the security of supply that
member states and our consumers expect.”

earlier this year said it needs. And the package
won’t soothe the destabilizing rivalry between
President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister
Yulia Timoshenko.
Nor will it sweeten the bitter relations between
Ukraine and Russia. After the EC’s announcement of the funding agreement, in fact, Moscow
circulated word that it would not be making a $5
billion loan of its own to Ukraine, which had been
under discussion since a request by Tymoshenko in
February. The Russian loan was said to be contingent on the availability of funding from Europe,
but Russian officials now are reported to be saying
it isn’t needed.
To a Russian government openly disdainful of
the western-leaning Yushchenko, who is seeking
reelection in a vote scheduled for January, Gazprom is a useful lever. But Gazprom has its own

Europe, despite the growth of other
regions, remains one of the world’s
largest offshore producers. Nearly 600
offshore fields have been developed off
Europe, involving a similar number of
platforms, about 400 subsea wells, over
200 subsea templates, and some 1,000
pipelines.
During the past decade the corporate scene has changed dramatically as
declining production
and high costs have
forced the original
developers, the oil
majors, into other
regions. That exodus
opened the way for a

months to June 2009, 57% fewer than
last year, according to Deloitte.
Oil & Gas UK, the industry body,
has warned that oil and gas investment
could fall dramatically, stunting the supply chain and threatening future expansion. It is calling for a relaxation of “the
punitive tax regime” on the sector. Over
the same period a different tax regime
in Norway has meant that activity has
increased by 50%.
This article examines the state of
plays and prospects and highlights some
challenges ahead.

The global context

Douglas-Westwood expects 2009

UK’s ‘quadruple whammy’
In the words of the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee report on Offshore Oil & Gas of
June 17, “the UKCS currently faces a
quadruple whammy of high costs, low
prices, lack of affordable credit, and a
global recession…fiscal and regulatory
changes needed to maximize reserve
recovery. Ministers need to articulate
a strategy setting out how production
levels are to be maintained.”
And Oil & Gas UK claims that
50,000 jobs could be at risk.
Behind the rhetoric, what is certain is that the UK is past its production peak in both oil (1999) and gas
(2000)—the major fields of the 1970s
are now in decline, and the newer,
smaller fields that utilize modern extraction technologies are unable to
offset this decline.
Offshore oil production is set to decline from 1.6 million b/d in 2008 to
less than 1.1 million b/d by 2013—a
decline of around 35%. Likewise,
offshore gas production is expected to

The UK’s capital expenditure on fixed platforms totaled
$1.4 billion in 2004-08. Our 2009-13 forecast for expenditure totals just over $1 billion, and is expected to remain
relatively level year on year at around $200 million.
Buzzard (2010). Heerema has been awarded the contracts
to build both the deck and jacket for a $925 million fourth
platform on Nexen Inc.’s Buzzard oil field. Installation of the
platform is likely to take place in the third quarter of 2010,
with start-up forecast by the end of that year.
Jasmine (2011). A significant gas-condensate discovery in
the Judy area of the central North Sea, Jasmine was previously known as Shoei. Operator ConocoPhillips did not
release a reserve estimate, but partner BG suggested the field
could contain 100-275 million boe. Development could well
take the form of a wellhead platform tied back to Judy. But if
Jasmine is large enough, a standalone solution could be justified, perhaps with export through the Judy infrastructure.
LNG fixed platforms. Canatxx plans to build a 3 bcfd terminal in Amlwch on Anglesey, Wales, at the former Great Lakes
chemical site. LNG tankers will offload the LNG onto a fixed
platform 3 km from the port. The gas will be piped along a
113 km subsea pipeline to Nateby, Lancashire, where it will
join the National Grid system. This plant has been criticized
by locals who feel that, despite the creation of 60 full time
jobs and 300 construction jobs, the project is too much of a
safety and environmental risk.

Norway—the long view
Several new fields have begun production off Norway,
including Alvheim, Varg, Vilje, Volve, and Tyrihans and the
number of exploration wells being drilled has doubled compared with 2005.
However, oil production passed its peak in 2001 and is
expected to continue to decline as a result of markedly reduced output from the giant fields. Although the Norwegian
Sea, and to a lesser extent the Barents Sea, has some excellent
prospects and natural gas liquids output is increasing, we
believe that these will be unable to reverse overall oil production decline. It is forecast that Norway will be producing
around 1.6 million b/d by 2013.
Conversely to oil, gas production continues to increase.
The country is forecast to be producing over 158 bcm/year
by 2013, up from around 111 bcm/year currently. The main
increases will come from the Norwegian Sea, primarily Ormen Lange, and from the Barents Sea, mainly Snohvit.
MMO in the Norwegian sector has experienced relatively
steady growth to date, however, operational expenditure is
expected to decline during 2009 and 2010 before recovering
towards the end of the forecast. Despite this dip, total opex
for 2009-13 is expected to be $59 billion, 16% higher than
the $49.1 billion spent during the previous 5 years.
Norway is expected to see an increase in decommissioning expenditure during 2009-13. Total expenditure is
expected to be just over $1 billion, a growth of 40%, com-

Unconventional Gas:
New Methods. New Supply.

Change happens fast in this industry and keeping clients aware of new
technology and solutions is essential.
Over the last decade technology advancements improved our capabilities to
predict, drill and produce natural gas in areas previously thought impossible.
These more sophisticated technologies have led to new opportunities in
re-examining existing wells and bringing untapped on line reserves leading
to new supplies.
Plan today to exhibit and sponsor at the Unconventional Gas International
Conference & Exhibition, September 29 – October 1 at the Fort Worth
Convention Center. Come by and meet decision makers who are willing to
discuss their next project.

IEA revises global oil demand forecast

28

IEA has revised up its forecast for
non-OECD oil demand for both 2009
and 2010, largely following a reappraisal of Chinese demand prospects.
Non-OECD demand in 2010 is now
expected to average 40.1 million b/d,
up 1.3 million b/d from 2009 and
100,000 b/d higher than the agency’s
previous assessment.
IEA noted that even though energyintensive non-OECD countries will
largely drive global demand growth, the
rise expected next year will nonetheless
be below the 2004-08 average of 1.5
million b/d/year.
The Paris-based agency’s 2009
forecast of 38.8 million b/d puts nonOECD oil demand up 140,000 b/d
vs. 2008. IEA said that this estimate is
170,000 b/d higher than in its previous
oil market report due to much stronger direct crude burning for electric
power generation in Saudi Arabia and
a persistent drought in India. Lack of
normal seasonal monsoon rain in India
has boosted gas oil use in agricultural
activities for irrigation and in power
generation, since hydropower output
in June was almost 10% lower on an
annual basis.

Supply
IEA has raised its forecast for 2009
non-OPEC supply by 160,000 b/d,
largely due to stronger than expected

IEA raised by 200,000 b/d its 2010
forecast for non-OPEC supply, as many
of the same factors are carried forward
through the outlook, the agency said.
As a result, total non-OPEC supply is
now forecast at 51 million b/d in 2009,
and 51.4 million b/d in 2010. IEA’s

Fitch notes. Collapse of the value spread
between low and high-quality crudes
has eroded the feedstock-cost advantage
of high-conversion refineries.
“Fitch anticipates that overall refining sector credit metrics will remain

report says. In the first half, it adds,
crude prices have become “somewhat
decoupled from underlying product
demand in North America,” increasing
enough to represent a “rising threat” to
refiners.
Despite the weakening, which Fitch
expects to continue until global product
demand recovers, the firm calls the
credit quality of the US refining industry “reasonable.”
Fitch expects service companies and
drilling contractors to remain under
pressure to lower rates and therefore to
have to cut their own costs as contract
revenue backlogs shrink.
It expects firms with deepwater
drilling operations and international diversification to benefit because margins
for these businesses exceed those for
companies confined to US markets and
drilling contractors with “more commoditized” rigs. ✦

f anyone in the oil and gas industry assumed the al-Qaeda terrorist
organization had dried up and blown
away, check that assumption.
Just last week, a Kuwaiti security
official said detained members of a
group linked to al-Qaeda planned to
attack Kuwait’s 200,000-b/d Shuaiba
refinery during the Muslim month of
Ramadan, beginning on Aug. 22.
Kuwait’s al-Anbaa newspaper
reported that the al-Qaeda cell
even used Google Earth to acquire
images of the refinery, as well as
other targets, which included a US
military camp and a state security
building.
One Kuwaiti official played down
the news, saying, “This refinery is
very well protected. There is really
no way to approach it by land.” But
there are other ways to approach the
facility, and an attack—successful or
not—would have been hard on the
country.

appears to be trying to regroup
around its Yemeni wing, which announced plans earlier this year to
widen the scope of operations to
include the rest of what one of its
writers called the “agent regimes” on
the Arabian Peninsula.
Those plans were summed up in
an article by Misha’l al-Shadukhi,
entitled “Vision from the Inside: Why
do we fight in the Arabian Peninsula?” which predicts that al-Qaeda’s
“forthcoming fight is with the regime of Al-Sa’ud, which opened the
doors of the Arabian Peninsula to the
United States.”

A ‘puny regime’

In particular, al-Shadukhi says that
“the Al-Sa’ud regime remaining after
the withdrawal of the US is a crazy
notion, for they cannot live without
worshipping the infidels,” adding,
“It is a puny regime, for it was not

The threat is being considered
if Iran fails to respond to President
Barack Obama’s offer to negotiate on
its nuclear program by the opening of
the United Nations session in midSeptember.
In October 2008, Obama suggested imposing restrictions on Iranian
gasoline imports. Iran produces 4.2
million b/d of oil, but it imports about
one-third of its gasoline due to a lack of
refining capacity.
Khataibi’s dismissal of the threat
echoes earlier remarks by other Iranian
officials, most of them insisting that
their country could evade the proposed
ban in one way or another.

An analyst comments
Analyst IHS Global Insight said that
gasoline import sanctions are unlikely
to isolate Iran completely as smuggling
from its neighbors will “surely take
off.”
But it also said that “the vast market
would feel the pinch with potentially
damaging political fall-out domestically.”
Global Insight said Iran’s gasoline imports are set to remain steady
over August, changing little from the
256,000 b/d imported during July, as
inventories are built up ahead of the
holy month of Ramadan.
“Iran has already contracted deliveries of 128,000 b/d on average, with the
contracting of a number of additional
cargoes likely,” Global Insight said, citing the Singapore traders. ✦

“All of this said, however, Congress
apparently intended that the commission fashion a rule that goes beyond
the Sherman Act and that resembles SEC
Rule 10b-5. In exercising prosecutorial
discretion, however, I, for one, intend to
keep these misgivings in mind,” Rosch
said.
Liebowitz acknowledged that oil industry trade associations have expressed
concerns about the new rule. “They
argue that it will chill business conduct
in the service of stopping something
that they don’t believe is happening in
the first place. These industry advocates
have proposed several specific changes
that would weaken the rule, requiring
a higher scienter standard under the
general liability provision, requiring an
explicit market distortion element for
the entire rule, and entirely eliminating
liability for omissions,” he said.

Opposes suggestions
The FTC chairman said that he opposed such proposals because they
would effectively neuter the rule and
undermine congressional intent.
“For example, the proposed changes
would make it harder, if not impossible,
to prosecute those who manipulate
the market by intentionally omitting
critical information from their communications, even when those omissions distort market conditions and
raise gasoline prices for all Americans,”
Leibowitz said. “Such omissions can be
every bit as deceptive as any other type
of fraudulent conduct, so it is crucial
that we have the ability to prevent and
prosecute them. A rule that does not allow us to go after such conduct would
limit our ability to protect consumers.”
He said that the rule, as proposed,
already takes legitimate oil industry
concerns into account. “In fact, we
responded directly to those concerns by
modifying the more expansive proposal in the draft rule we released last
summer, originally based on SEC Rule
10b-5, to accommodate industry worries,” he said.

US Treasury sends derivatives proposal to Congress
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Department of the Treasury
sent legislative language to Congress on
Aug. 11 that would institute regulation
of all over-the-counter derivatives.
The proposal targets widely used, yet
largely unregulated, credit default swaps
and other OTC derivatives. Several federal
lawmakers have suggested that speculators used these unregulated instruments
to take major commodity positions and
push crude oil prices to record peaks in
2008’s first half. Independent oil and gas
producers and others that take commodity positions as price hedges have
warned that too much regulation could
harm their operations.
In its announcement, Treasury said,
“The legislation will provide for regulation and transparency for all OTC derivative transactions; strong prudential and
business conduct regulation of all OTC
derivative dealers and other major participants in the OTC derivative markets; and
improved regulatory and enforcement
tools to prevent manipulation, fraud, and
other abuses in these markets.”
The proposal generally followed
ideas US Treasury Secretary Timothy F.
Geithner described when he testified
on July 10 before a joint hearing of
two US House committees. Rep. Collin
E. Peterson (D-Minn.), who chairs the
Agriculture Committee, and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who chairs the
Financial Services Committee, jointly
outlined their proposal to regulate
OTC derivatives on July 31.
“Treasury’s legislative proposal is

a very important step toward muchneeded reform to protect the American
people by lowering risk, promoting
transparency, and protecting market
integrity,” US Commodity Futures
Trading Commission Chairman Gary G.
Gensler said on Aug. 11.

“I believe that all over-the-counter
derivatives and dealers should be
brought under comprehensive regulation. I look forward to working with
Congress to make sure that the law
covers the entire marketplace without
exception,” he said. ✦

Although the oil industry is important, the UK will best enhance its energy security through a variety of sources
including wind and other renewables,
nuclear, gas, and clean coal, according
to a report by former energy secretary
Malcolm Wicks.
Wicks has been appointed the Prime
Minister’s Special Representative on International Energy. His analysis concluded that an “interventionist” approach
by the government will be needed to
ensure security of energy supplies, a
move that was criticized by business
lobby group, the Confederation of Business Industry.
“The government is already shaping
the market through various low-carbon
targets and incentives, and more intervention is not necessarily the answer,”
said Dr. Neil Bentley, the CBI’s director
of business environment. “The role of
government should be to provide the
right policy and planning frameworks
to encourage the £150 billion of private
sector investment needed to bolster
energy security, cut emissions and keep
prices affordable.”
Wicks said the UK needs to foster
tight relationships with gas exporters,
Norway, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, while
tripling nuclear capacity and pushing
for renewable energy. He also suggested
strategic storage to stop companies
from diverting gas supplies to other
countries if there were a shortage.
Energy and Climate Change Sec. Ed
Miliband said that maximizing North
Sea production was a priority as well as
energy diversification.
The government is to consider carefully the report’s recommendations and
publish a formal response. ✦

MEOR literature survey
The survey of the literature provided the following points regarding MEOR:
• MEOR methods active during the past 10 years are environmentally safe, easy to operate, and
economical.
• Among the proposed MEOR mechanisms, ﬁeld observations indicate that selective plugging
may be the main contributor for better recovery. In practice, IFT reduction may be less effective than
shown in laboratory tests.
• For the selected MEOR ﬁeld cases in the past 10 years, more than 60% of wells treated by
bacteria increased oil production rates. Most treated reservoirs had temperatures below 85° C.
Moreover, most successful cases were for reservoirs below 55° C.
• The survey provided no clear relationship between the success of MEOR projects and reservoir permeability.
• Many ﬁeld cases indicate that MEOR reduced IFT, crude oil viscosity, and parafﬁn content, as
well as modiﬁed the injection proﬁle.
• MEOR methods are more suitable for low temperature, low production rate, and high water
cut wells.
• A better practice is to inject both bacteria and nutrient into the reservoir. Injection of nutrient
only is not very effective because the favorable indigenous bacteria may not compete effectively for
the nutrients with other existing bacteria colonies.
• The current MEOR success rate is not very satisfactory. Developments in biotechnology and
petroleum technology will, however, deepen the understanding of MEOR methods to lower project
costs and improve success rates.

the culture generated CO2. The measured crude oil viscosity after shut-in
tests indicated that
the culture reduced
crude viscosity to
less than 50 cp from
about 80 cp before
the test.
Clostridium
acetobutylicum also
effectively improved
oil recovery in the
flooding test. The
bacteria’s ability to
produce gas, however, is limited as
tested in laboratory.
It is unlikely that
bacteria can generate large quantities
of gas in underground reservoirs.

Biodegradation
rocks, they also tend to enter large
pores. Certain bacteria can generate
biopolymers that plug the high-permeability zones with large pores, thus
forcing injected water to sweep the oil
in low-permeability zones.
One study injected pseudomonas
aeruginosa strain into glass-bead packs
and Berea sandstone cores to investigate
the permeability reduction by bacteria
and their metabolic products.5
For the three bead packs with high
permeability about 1,400 md, the permeability reductions ranged from 20%
to 54% of the original permeabilities.
For the cores with low permeabilities
about 13 md, the reduction ranged
from 45% to 72%.
Another test injected bacteria solution into sandstone core and reduced by
80% the observed permeability.6
Most MEOR laboratory tests have
been in sandstone cores. Very few experiments involved fractured system.
One investigation etched fractures
inside a glass to imitate a fractured rock
and then injected leuconostoc mesenteroides and bacillus subtilis into this
40

micromodel to investigate their effects
in MEOR.7
Leuconostoc mesenteroides is a biopolymer producer, while bacillus subtilis produces biosurfactant. The results
showed that bacillus subtilis improved
recovery in a fractured system, while
leuconostoc mesenteroides was not as
effective.
This indicates that reduction in IFT is
more effective than selective plugging
in enhancing recovery for a fractured
system.

Viscosity reduction
Certain bacteria produce gas and
solvents in the reservoir, such as CO2.
Gas and solvents can dissolve in crude
oil and reduce crude oil viscosity, leading to an improved mobility ratio and
oil recovery.
The produced gas can also increase
reservoir pressure, which leads to
higher producing rates.
One test involved the mixing of
clostridium acetobutylicum with crude
oil in a sealed cell.8 The observed pressure in the cell started to rise because

Certain bacteria can degrade crude
oil, especially the paraffin contents in
crude oil.
When applied to reservoir, bacteria
can remove the paraffin deposit in the
near wellbore region, thus improving
permeability and production rate.9

Wettability alteration
Rock wettability greatly influences
the distribution of residual oil. In water-wet sandstones, water is in contact
with sand grains, and oil droplets are
in the center of the pore space. On the
other hand, for oil-wet rocks, oil is in
contact with grain surfaces and remains
in the small pores. In other words, water wettability is better for oil recovery.
The research on bacteria-induced
wettability change is limited. One study
treated Berea sandstone cores with rhodococcus sp. 094 solution.10 The study
used the Amott method11 to evaluate the
rock wettability before and after microbial treatments.
The study showed that after injection of bacteria solution the originally
water-wet cores became more water

Another test measured the contact
angle of water-wet limestone cores
submerged in bacillus solution.12 Observed was a reduction in contact angle,
indicating wettability alteration towards

low. Therefore, MEOR is unlikely to alter

molecular sieve (desiccant) to remove
water from sweet gas feeding the NGLrecovery area. NGL is recovered by cooling the sweet gas to a cryogenic –140°
F. At this low temperature, no water is
in the sweet gas. Otherwise, hydration
will form blockage in the downstream
equipment. The water content allowed
to NGL recovery area is 10 ppm or less.
The molecular sieve material consists
of zeolite and binders. The zeolite is
the active material on which the water
is adsorbed. Usually, the service life
of the desiccant is 750 regeneration
cycles, which is equal to almost 3 years
at normal loading of gas. Uthmaniyah
has successfully achieved 1,380 cycles
(7 years) with no decline in the desiccant. This article discusses the factors
in achieving this and the effects on the
market.

NGL-recovery area
The Uthmaniyah gas plant has
four identical NGL-recovery modules.
The main objective of each module is
to recover NGL from the sweetened
gas through a cascaded refrigeration
process that uses ethane and propane
as refrigerants. Each module consists of
three chill trains, which are basically a

series of chillers and heat exchangers.
The sweet wet gas is fed to the
module at 140° F. and 450 psig (Fig. 1).
The gas is cooled at the first chill train
to 65° F. After that, the feed is taken to a
three-phase separator to remove liquid
hydrocarbon and water from the feed
gas.
The separated gas is saturated with
water and fed to the gas dehydrators to
remove moisture and avoid hydrate formation in the downstream equipment.
At the same time the liquid hydrocarbon is sent to the liquid dehydrator to
remove the moisture from it. The dry
liquid hydrocarbon is sent to Tray 4 at
the demethanizer. The dry gas leaves
the dehydrators and continues to the
second chill train where it is cooled
to –35° F. At the end of the train the
liquids are separated from the gas in a
two-phase separator. The liquid hydrocarbon is sent to Tray 10 and the gas
continues to the third train for further
cooling.
The gas is cooled at the third chill
train to –98° F. and the liquid is separated from the gas in a two-phase separator. The liquid is fed to Tray 19 and
the gas is used to cool the feed in the
46

upstream heat exchangers. The demethanizer stabilizes the NGL and removes
the light ends. Then the product is
drawn from the bottom of the column
and sent to the shipping pumps.

Dehydration
The main objective of dehydration is
to remove water from the gas:
• To meet sales-gas pipeline specification. This does not require deep
dehydration. It can be achieved through
glycol dehydration process. An example
of this is Uthmaniyah and Shedgum gas
plants’ triethylene glycol units, where
TEG is used to dehydrate the sweetened
high-pressure gas and lower its water
content to meet Saudi Aramco Standard
A-120 of less than 7 lb/MMscfd water
specification in the sales gas.
• To prevent hydrate formation under cryogenic conditions. This requires
deep dehydration in which gas is dried
up to 1-ppm water content.
Hydrate is an ice shape substance
that forms under certain conditions in
the presence of hydrocarbon mixed
with free water. Hydrate formation de-

pends on the pressure, temperature,
and composition
of the mixture.
The temperatures
at the Uthmaniyah
liquid recovery
units reach as low
as –140 °F. This
leaves no room
to tolerate having
undried gas.
At the Uthmaniyah gas plant,
wet feed gas enters
the dehydrators
from the top and
flows down the
dehydrator where
all the water in the
gas is adsorbed
and the gas leaves
as dry gas from
the bottom of the

dehydrator (Fig. 2).
After some time, the gas dehydrator
becomes saturated with water and regeneration of the dehydrator is required
to remove the adsorbed water by the
desiccant. The dry regeneration gas
enters the dehydrator from the bottom
to remove water and dry the desiccant.
During normal operations, two dehydrators would be online and a third is
under regeneration.

Desiccant performance
The first performance parameter is
water adsorption capacity of the desiccant. The capacity started at about 19 lb
H2O/100 lb of desiccant and stabilized
after 400 regeneration cycles to around
10 lb H2O, which was above the minimum threshold of 8 lb H2O (Fig. 3).
The minimum capacity the desiccant
reached was 9.8 lb.
The second performance parameter
is the pressure drop across the dehydrator. The pressure drop started at about 9
psi and gradually increased to a maximum of 13 psi, which was significantly
below the maximum threshold of 25
psi.

Several factors helped extend desiccant service.

Two-step regeneration
The regeneration process removes
the water from the desiccant after it
has been online for some time. After
this process, the dehydrator is ready to
receive the gas again.

The description of the loading plan
will be from the bottom to top of the
dehydrator (Fig. 5). Typically the dehydrator has 6 in. of supporting balls,
between 0.5 in. and 0.25 in. in size.
Support balls help hold the desiccant
and avoid lifting it during the regeneration cycle.
At the same time, these balls even
out distribution of the regeneration
gas to the dehydrator. Support balls are
inert; therefore, they do not have any
water-adsorbing characteristics. After
that, there is a 3-in. layer of desiccant
sized of 2.5 mm to 5 mm. On top of
it, there is a 60-in. layer of smaller size
desiccant, 1.6 mm to 2.5 mm.
The fourth layer is the largest and
has a height of 149 in. of large desiccant, 2.5 mm to 5 mm. On top of the
molecular sieve, there is a 16-in. layer
of activated aluminum.
It is believed that the activated alumina layer is one of the most important layers in the dehydrator as it acts
as a sacrificial layer. This layer removes
any contaminants in the gas and avoids
poisoning the desiccant. Furthermore,
because of its strength characteristics compared to the desiccant, it
has higher resistance to the thermal
degradation that takes place during the
regen cycle.
Finally, there is a 6-in. layer of supporting balls. This layer evens out the
distribution of the inlet wet gas and
prevents desiccant migration during
regeneration. This loading plan also
reduces the pressure drop as the large
desiccant is loaded at the top of the
dehydrator.

Regen cycles

In the past, the regeneration process
occurred in one step and the regen
inlet-gas temperature was heated to
500° F. (Fig. 6). In 1998, however,
research conducted by the laboratory at
the Research and Development Center
at Saudi Aramco and work with the
desiccant vendors indicated that the
desiccant bed’s service life could be
extended if two stages of regeneration
process were used.
In addition, several molecular sieve
vendors recommended the two-stage
regeneration in order to minimize the
internal water-vapor condensation that

occurs during the regeneration cycle.
The process calls for regenerating
the desiccant in two stages. The first
involves preheating the bed at a higher
temperature, 250° F. for 90 min, while
the second involves heating the bed at a
higher temperature, 500° F. (Fig. 7).
The former drives off the adsorbed
hydrocarbons before they coke and will
prevent most of water from condensing. Water condensation causes sieve
particles to breakdown and clog the
desiccant bed leading to increased pressure drop across the gas dehydrators.
The latter drives off the adsorbed water.
Figs. 6 and 7 compare the two regeneration processes.

Considering the current shortage in
the desiccant market and the long leadtime—6 months—needed to receive a
shipment, this experience has created
the following effects:
• Improving desiccant quality by increasing competition among manufacturers. The competition to develop and
optimize loading plans and manufacturing processes has become more intense
than ever. The Uthmaniyah experience
was shared with different vendors, who
expressed amazement. Uthmaniyah
informed vendors that the loading plan
was a major contributor in extending desiccant life, and all vendors were
trying to improve their loading plan to
achieve a similarly long service life.
• Made more desiccant production

The energy industries in many
countries face the political risk of not

The framework conditions for CCS are

member countries have progressed over
the last few years with, for example,
the EU geological storage directive and
amendments to existing legislation.
Such developments will help reduce
long-term political unpredictability
when huge CCS investment decisions
are made in the near future in Europe,
North America, and Australia.
Besides political risk, CCS as a concept has other aspects requiring safe

Positive developments
DNV notes positive developments in
several places around the world.
Norway plans to build its first
full-scale CCS plant as early as 2012.
Europe hopes to develop demonstration
projects by 2015, followed by largescale industry plants by 2020. North
America and Australia are also active,
and the global community is discussing
how to incorporate CCS in a possible
global greenhouse gas emission trading
scheme, based on the goal of having a
strong, global CO2 price as one important incentive for the industry.
DNV is working together with
industry participants and governments
in developing CCS as a safe and reliable means of reducing CO2 emissions
by developing industry guidelines and
international regulations; qualifying
new capture technologies, pipelines
and storage sites; verifying new and
retrofitted CCS installations; certifying
CO2 credits; and helping industry and
authorities manage their increasingly
complex risk exposure.
In November 2008 DNV began
developing a standard methodology for
characterizing, selecting, and qualifying proper sites for geological storage
of CO2—both offshore and onshore—
working with Norwegian authorities
and more than 10 oil, gas, and coal
industry participants.
Many pilot-scale and demo-scale
projects are under way around the
world, and project developers are
considering taking the next step and
implementing large-scale CCS projects.
But for CCS to have a real effect on the
carbon balance, more than a thousand
large-scale projects must be implemented over the next couple of decades,
making speed of the essence.
DNV’s work addresses the lack of
publicly available and recognized bestpractice guidelines. Such guidelines
should explain how to efficiently implement legal and regulatory frameworks,
adopt concurrent best engineering

Europe, related industrial experience
and scientific knowledge serve as a
sound basis for appropriate risk management, including remediation.
The oil and gas industry has extensive experience with management of
uncertainties subsurface. Several relevant
industrial activities exist worldwide,
such as natural gas storage and acid gas
disposal, providing a basis for proper
management of risks and uncertainties
related to geological storage of CO2.
A new problem posed by geological
storage of CO2, however, is subjecting the results of site assessment and
associated risk evaluations to scrutiny
by regulators and other stakeholders as
part of the storage permit application
process.
It will also be important to document and communicate how individual
risks evolve and are effectively reduced
through the project lifecycle with
proper risk-based monitoring and verification programs. ✦

New user adds trading, risk management system
Symphony ETRM, an integrated liquid
hydrocarbons trading and risk management system, has added Sinclair Oil Corp.,
Salt Lake City, Utah, as one of its most
recent users.
Symphony’s straight-through-processing functionality helps improve work
flow within an organization, enabling
traders and risk managers to make betterinformed decisions faster, says the developer of the system. The software pinpoints
the value of a position in real time, tracks
the total risk position under any given
set of transaction variables, and manages all paper and physical transactions in
one system while eliminating data entry
duplication.

Underwater receiver helps detect hydrocarbons
This new ocean-bottom electromagnetic (EM) receiver is designed to detect
underwater oil and gas deposits with

improved operational efficiency, safety, and
more comprehensive data quality.
The QMax EM3 receiver is 1 m tall and
1 m wide and measures all six components
of the EM tensor. Each unit weighs about
150 kg in air (without an anchor), and
power consumption is about 1 w. The sensors, capable of 30-day deployments, may be used at depths as
great as 4,000 m. Long electricfield arms are not required for
industry standard signal-to-noise
performance, but arms can be
added for enhanced sensitivity.
The compact unit receives increased
safety, reliability, and operational efficiencies in a new commercial-grade turnkey
form designed for maximum deployment
and recovery speed, minimal redundancy
and redeployments, and more dense array
surveys with larger numbers of instrument deployments than is now possible,
the company says. The firm says its system
achieves data quality with a combination
of sensitivity, vertical axis data acquisition

for electric and magnetic fields, and survey
sampling enabled through denser surveys
and fewer missed data points-redrops.
The system features:
• Electrodes that are permanently connected to and stored within the instrument and are not affected by sunlight or
water chemistry (fresh, brackish,
or salt water), yet are up to10
times smaller than other electrodes, the firm points out.
• Electrodes that do not need
to be stored in water and have
no assembly required, thus eliminating deckside assembly processes and
associated potential failure points.
• Receiver size that makes units more
hydrodynamic, shortening the drop time
and leading to more accurate placement.

FTC oil market
rule will restrict
market activity
The US Federal Trade Commission’s rule
prohibiting oil-market manipulation culminates a witch hunt in a land of no witches.
It manages to be silly and dangerous at
the same time—silly because it bans nonexistent behavior and dangerous because it
subjects honest business people to whimsical enforcement.
The rule subjects manipulation of the
wholesale oil market through “fraud or de-

ceit” to stiff penalties. Except in rare cases
involving obvious crooks, such manipulation doesn’t exist.
Lawmakers and regulators ceremoniously launch investigations whenever oil
prices stirred political passions. They’ve
never found evidence of widespread manipulation or anything hinting of systemic
chicanery.
Oil, in fact, changes hands in the most
aggressively monitored market in the country. Yet the juvenile supposition persists that
when consumers feel stressed by oil prices
the reason must be that oil companies,
contrary to overwhelming evidence, are
cheating them.
So the FTC will, according to Chairman
Jon Leibowitz, “police the oil markets—and
if we ﬁnd companies that are manipulating
the markets, we will go after them.”
It would seem that all anyone has to do
to elude civil penalties of up to $1 million/
day/violation is to continue not manipulating the oil market.
But to show its heroic determination to
crush soap bubbles, FTC includes in its list
of potential offenses “omissions of material
information that are likely to distort petroleum markets.”
A reﬁner or jobber thus faces trouble for
“making an untrue statement of material
fact” that deceives someone as well as for
not making any statement at all. Furthermore, the commission excused itself from
having to prove that an enforcement target
intended manipulation or that the alleged
misbehavior affected prices.
Logical responses to these traps are to
limit commerce to transactions with trusted
customers unlikely to be—or claim to have
been—deceived and to communicate as
little as possible.
The effect can only be to limit market
activity. This is no way to protect oil consumers.
The new rule plays to the political
exploitation of American suspicion repeatedly shown by FTC and other investigatory
agencies to be unfounded. It’s more than
dangerous silliness. It’s hypocrisy.

EIA: US gas storage tops 3 tcf
The US Energy Information Administration reported natural gas in underground
storage topped 3 tcf with a 66 bcf injection in the week ended July 31. That was up
580 bcf from a year ago and 496 bcf above the 5-year level, with still time to reach
maximum capacity well ahead of the Nov. 1 start of the winter heating season.
Bearish gas market fundamentals and record-high storage are “why it is so
difﬁcult to explain the quick and signiﬁcant price move Aug. 3 that occurred in just
10 min,” said analysts at Energy Solutions Inc., Verona, Wis. On that date, at 9-9:10
a.m. EST, the September gas contract jumped to $4.162/MMbtu from $3.708/MMbtu
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, eventually closing at $4.03/MMbtu, up 37.8¢
for the day. “The rally has been chalked up to being a major play by a larger player
who either decided to get into the market quickly or get out quickly. There is also
‘speculation’ that this price move may have been caused by a player who decided
to exit the market rather than risk being subjected to potentially new contract
limitation restrictions that are being discussed by the government,” said Energy
Solutions analysts.
Either way, they said, the price jump was “a subtle reminder that no matter how
bearish things may be, the market can sometimes move in the opposite direction for
no reason at all.”
Analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC, New Orleans, noted at the time, “Natural gas has bounced off the $3.20/MMbtu level three times now, but always failed at
$4.30/MMbtu. The contract is inching towards the $4.30/MMbtu level but will need to
decisively break the $4.30/MMbtu level to sustain the current rally.”
Gulf of Mexico platform ﬁre
The gas contract declined 3¢ in the next session but rebounded 4.1¢ on Aug. 5
after Enterprise Products Partners LP shut in its 42-in. Gulf of Mexico pipeline due
to an explosion and ﬁre at a compressor plant on Platform 264 B of the High Island
Offshore System. The connecting pipeline was not damaged, but there was damage to Platform B, which houses compressors used to boost throughput on the line.
Platform A, which houses operational personnel, was not affected.
The system has the capacity to transport 1.8 bcfd of gas from the gulf to pipelines
off the Louisiana coast such as ANR Pipeline Co., Tennessee Gas Transmission Corp.,
and the UT Offshore System. But initial reports said it was transporting only 200-300
MMcfd recently due to last year’s hurricane damage.
Meanwhile, the Independence Hub platform in the gulf is expected to operate at
700-800 MMcfd vs. recent trends of 900 MMcfd through the rest of the third quarter
due to maintenance on separators. Each of the seven separators will require 1-2
weeks work, or 50-55 days of aggregate repair downtime.
However, traders shrugged off those disruptions, and the front-month gas contract plummeted 29.9¢ when the EIA reported the latest build in gas storage Aug.
6. It dropped another 6.9¢ to $3.67/MMbtu on Aug. 7, up a minimal 0.43% for the
week.
Upbeat US economic data on Aug. 7 helped strengthen the US dollar and undermined crude prices, “but provided no support for natural gas, which is surprising since unlike oil the natural gas price is primarily driven by the US economy
and not the global one, “ said Pritchard Partners. “The worst of the economic
downturn is behind us, but there is an abundance of natural gas as evidenced by
most [exploration and production companies] delivering higher production than
anticipated.”
In recent telephone brieﬁngs with analysts, they said, “Price-driven shut-ins were
mentioned as likely by XTO Energy Inc., Chesapeake Energy Corp., and EOG Resources Inc.” However, they reported, “Each company said it would exceed previous
production guidance. Signs that the consumer is strengthening will be the precursor
to higher industrial production numbers, which will drive higher industrial demand
for natural gas, the weakest element of demand year-to-date.”
Chesapeake earlier said it would shut in 400 MMcfd because of low prices and
large storage. However, the company apparently will now resume production.
Meanwhile, weather forecasters look for El Nino conditions to continue to develop and to last through the Northern Hemisphere into winter 2009-10. “It is well
accepted that El Nino reduces hurricane activity in the Atlantic Basin, so the possibility of a hurricane cutting off [gulf] natural gas production seems a less likely event as
hurricane season approaches,” Pritchard Capital analysts said.

Baker Hughes

Advancing Reservoir Performance

Deepwater:
Horizontal Openhole
Gravel-Pack Completions
First Successful Horizontal Openhole Gravel Pack
in Deepwater Stybarrow Field
The Stybarrow Field consists of slope turbidite sandstones of the
Macedon Formation in the Exmouth Sub-Basin offshore Western
Australia. It is one of two fields in Australia’s deepest water
development, in more than 800 m of water, and was developed
entirely by subsea wells connected to an FPSO.
Lateral Reservoir Quality, Sand/Shale Heterogeneities
Lateral reservoir quality variations, difficult sand/shale
heterogeneities, and limited in-country technical experience and
infrastructure were only some of the obstacles to completing four,
near-horizontal production wells in this field. Others included gravel
packing across much longer non-reservoir sections, gravel packing
out of a milled casing window, narrow pressure margin between
circulating pressures and formation fracture pressure, large
wellbore washouts, and gravel packing at wellbore inclinations
of up to 94°.
Gravel-Pack Design With Ceramic Proppant
To solve these problems, Baker Hughes helped develop an
optimized reservoir drilling fluid and gravel carrier fluid design. We
also created a gravel pack pumping design that used a 16/20 US
Mesh ceramic proppant. This combined with our EXCLUDER2000™
medium-weave premium screen to produce the optimal sandface
completion. Baker Hughes engineers sized the screens to retain
formation sand. This would ensure sand retention in case of
incomplete gravel packs. Slurry and conformance tests with
various screen types and a range of sand facies, along with various
proppant sizes and types, concluded that inclusion of proppant
drastically reduced pressure buildup across the screens as well

EXCLUDER2000 screens like those used in the Stybarrow wells have compiled
an outstanding performance record in the world’s most extreme conditions.

as the mass of sand particles produced through the screens. The
Baker Oil Tools gravel-pack design also contained contingencies
specific to this design in case of poor installation outcomes. Another
success factor in the project was continuity of key Baker Hughes
personnel and essential equipment from concept through execution.
Near-Record Australian Production Rates
Gravel-pack efficiency factors between 108% and 118% were
achieved despite several unforeseen geological and technical
challenges. All four Stybarrow production wells achieved
maximum sand-free rates per FPSO design capacity. Maximum
production rates from all four wells have exceeded 80,000 BOPD,
with one well producing at near-record Australian rates of 32,000
BOPD seven months after first oil.

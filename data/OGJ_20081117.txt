COVER
The Adriatic LNG terminal left its construction site in Algeciras,
Spain, on Aug. 30, for the 1,700-mile trip to its final destination, where it arrived Sept. 15.The terminal has been positioned
at about 10 miles offshore Porto Levante, Italy, in the Adriatic
Sea, in 95 ft of water and will be connected via pipeline to Italy’s
natural gas grid. It is designed to store and regasify LNG to deliver
775 MMcfd of clean-burning natural gas when it reaches full
operational capacity in 2009. It will receive gas produced from
Qatar’s North field, which has resources of more than 900 tcf of
gas, making it the largest nonassociated gas field in the world.The
terminal is owned by ExxonMobil Italiana Gas, Edison, and Qatar
Petroleum wholly owned subsidiary Qatar Terminal Ltd. Details
of other projects are in Oil & Gas Journal’s Worldwide Construction Update starting on p. 24 and in the survey tables at www.

Knowledge is power.
At URS, we believe that the more involved you are with
a process from beginning to end, the better equipped you
are to provide solutions. So when it comes to meeting
today’s increasing demand for oil and gas, we bring proven
experience with us. From oil sands, gas production, and
petroleum reﬁning to constructing a facility, maintaining
one, or developing an expansion plan. Which is why, in the
Industrial & Commercial sector, more people are turning
to us to get it done. We are the new URS.

Europe seeks alternatives to Russian energy supplies Nigeria to streamline energy ministry
The European Union should improve access to gas from the
Caspian region, coordinate supply problems among member states,
and keep a closer watch on oil stocks, according to a report by the
European Commission.
“A southern gas corridor must be developed for the supply of
gas from Caspian and Middle Eastern sources—this is identified as
one of the EU’s highest energy security priorities,” said a draft of
the EU’s Second Strategic Energy Review.
The 27-member bloc is seeking to reduce its reliance on Russian gas after pricing disputes between Russia and transit states
disrupted supplies in recent years and Russia’s invasion of Georgia
in August increased tensions.
Russia already supplies 42% of the EU’s gas, and Moscow—
seeking to increase its sway over the EU—is competing hard to buy
up volumes in North Africa and Central Asia.
European Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs last week visited Turkey and Azerbaijan, seeking to smooth the way for supplies
of Caspian and Central Asian gas to reach Europe directly instead of
passing through Russia (OGJ Online, Nov. 10, 2008).
The EC will seek firm gas supply commitments from Azerbaijan
and Turkmenistan, and will look at creating a consortium for buying Caspian gas, said the review, which will be published Nov. 13.
Although the EU has a variety of gas suppliers, including Russia, Norway, Algeria, and other countries, some individual member
states are particularly dependent on a single supplier, such as the
Baltic countries’ dependence on Russia.
“Strategies to share and spread risk and to make the best use of
the combined weight of the EU in world affairs can be more effective than dispersed national actions,” the draft report said.
In the commission’s view, EU nations also could improve the
security of their supplies by strengthening infrastructure.
“Connecting the remaining isolated energy markets in Europe
is a priority,” the report said, adding that the commission would
develop plans next year for linking the Baltic countries’ energy infrastructure with the rest of the bloc.
The commission also plans to draft an action plan for LNG infrastructure, study the possibility of an offshore wind park in the
North Sea, and look into methods for improving links between
Europe and countries along the southern Mediterranean shore.
The EC draft report also recommended that both strategic and
commercial oil stocks be better managed.

Exploration

&

Nigerian President Umaru Yar’Adua is replacing his gas and
power ministers in a cabinet reshuffle that builds on other restructuring within the country’s petroleum sector.
Emmanuel Olatunde Odusina, Nigeria’s Minister of State for Energy (Gas) has been ousted as has Alhaja Fatima Ibrahim, Minister
of State for Energy (Power).
The Ministry of Petroleum Resources was split earlier this year
into power, gas, and petroleum, with separate ministers heading
each strand. At the same time it was renamed the Energy Ministry.
However, Yar’Adua has again consolidated the three divisions
to streamline them under the name of the Ministry of Petroleum
Resources, and he will appoint one minister to head it. He is compiling a list of ministerial nominees to send to the Senate in the
coming days.
Other reforms include the creation of a new, separate ministry
for the Niger Delta to coordinate a response to the crises in that
area, where militants continue to attack oil company pipelines and
installations.

Bakassi kidnappers release oil service vessel crew
Kidnappers on Nov. 11 released the 10 crew members of the oil
service vessel Bourbon Sagitta, who were abducted Oct. 31 off the
Bakassi peninsula between Nigeria and Cameroon (OGJ Online,
Nov. 3, 2008). The French Foreign Ministry, which made the announcement, described their release as a “100% Cameroon operation.” It said there was no violence involved and no ransom paid.
The politically motivated kidnapping was carried out by a
Bakassi group called the Niger Delta Defense and Security Council, which disputed an International Court ruling handing over the
Bakassi peninsula to Nigeria.
The crew included six Frenchmen, one Franco-Senegalese, a Tunisian, and two Cameroonians. All were said to be in good health,
and they are expected to return home to their respective countries
by Nov. 12.
The vessel belonged to Bourbon Offshore Surf, which expressed
gratitude to the Cameroon authorities, the French Foreign Ministry, and others who contributed to the crew’s release.
French president Nicolas Sarkozy said Cameroon President Paul
Biya was instrumental in freeing the hostages, and Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner credited the Nigerian authorities, with
whom contact had been maintained throughout. ✦

bye in a conference call with analysts and investors.
StatoilHydro has agreed to spend $3.38 billion for a 32.5% in
Chesapeake’s gas assets in the Marcellus shale region in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and New York. StatoilHydro said $1.25 billion
would be paid in cash, and the outstanding $2.125 billion would
constitute a 75% carry on drilling and completion of wells during
2009-12.
“In order to earn this carry, Chesapeake is required to maintain a
significant level of drilling activity,” the Stavanger-based major added.
The acreage covers 7,300 sq km and will add future recoverable
equity resources of 2.5-3 billion boe. StatoilHydro’s equity production from the Marcellus shale gas play is expected to increase
to a minimum 50,000 boe/d in 2012 and at least 200,000 boe/d
after 2020, with net positive cash flow from 2013. Chesapeake
plans to build upon its leases in the Marcellus shale play with StatoilHydro having a right to a 32.5% interest in them.
“The agreement we have entered into with Chesapeake provides
us with a solid position in an attractive long-term resource base at
competitive terms,” said Helge Lund, president and chief executive
officer of StatoilHydro. “This is a significant step in strengthening
our US gas position, building on our existing capacity rights for
the Cove Point LNG terminal, our gas trading and marketing organization, and the gas producing assets in the US Gulf of Mexico.”
The development program could support the drilling of
13,500-17,000 horizontal wells over the next 20 years, using up
to 50 drilling rigs. The expected cost is estimated at $3.5 million/
well, with an ultimate recovery of 560,000 boe/well.
The transaction is expected to close by yearend.
This announcement follows other recent deals that Chesapeake
has struck with Plains Exploration & Production Co. and BP America
to raise funds and develop its natural-gas holdings: Plains bought a
20% working interest in its assets in the Haynesville shale in north
Louisiana and East Texas for $3.3 billion, and BP America acquired
a 25% stake in its assets in the Fayetteville shale for $1.9 billion.

Ithaca Energy to develop Jacky ﬁeld
Ithaca Energy (UK) Ltd. expects to produce 7,500 b/d of oil
from one well on Jacky field in the UK North Sea under its development plan, which the UK government has just approved.
The field, which is expected to come on stream in early 2009,
will require a small wellhead platform and downhole pumping
to assist the production well. The platform will be installed when
the weather has improved. Pipelines are scheduled to be laid in
December.
The company will work with partner North Sea Energy (UK)
Ltd. on Jacky, which holds 5.2 million bbl of proved and probable
reserves, some 10 km northeast of Beatrice field in the Inner Moray
Firth area of the UK continental shelf.
Oil from Jacky will be processed at the company’s nearby Beatrice
oil facilities and exported via the Beatrice pipeline to the Nigg oil ter-

Drilling

&

minal, which Ithaca also leases, for storage and offloading to tankers.
“Ithaca intends to invest in enhancing production from Beatrice, and as part of this, the pipeline from Jacky to Beatrice will
also be used to restore production from the Beatrice Bravo facility,
which was shut in last year by Talisman,” the company said.
Lawrie Payne, Ithaca chief executive, said Jacky would provide
large cash flow and would help develop the Beatrice area and other
projects.
Ithaca holds a 90% share in Jacky, and North Sea Energy (UK) 10%.

Circle Oil tests Ouled N’Zala gas well in Morocco
Circle Oil PLC has tested 3.32 MMscfd of natural gas from an
exploration well on the Ouled N’Zala permit in Morocco.
Exploration well ONZ6, which is the first successful well for the
company in the country, struck gas in the Upper Ouled formation.
It will now undergo an extended production test.
Circle Oil is evaluating the results to determine the size of the
resource, including carrying out an extended well test. It has not
completed a full assessment of the reserves.
“The field test results are in line with our expectations for this
area,” said Circle Oil Chief Executive David Hough. “We look forward to the results of the next well, which will be the first in the
Sebou permit where Circle holds a 75% interest.”
Circle Oil will now drill on the Sebou permit, which is the second of the six-well drilling program.
The Ouled N’Zala permit lies northeast of Rabat in the Rharb
basin in Morocco. The Rharb basin is a foredeep basin in the external zone of the Rif folded belt.
Circle Oil can convert the concession agreement to a production
license of 30 years, plus extensions, if it has commercial discoveries.

Norway offers 79 blocks in latest licensing round
Norway, in its 20th licensing round, has invited operators to
bid for 79 blocks or parts of blocks on the Norwegian continental
shelf.
Operators can apply for 51 blocks in the Norwegian Sea and
28 blocks in the Barents Sea. In this—one of the country’s largest
licensing rounds ever—Norway hopes that companies will make
new discoveries and enhance production, particularly in the Barents Sea where successful wells may open new exploration areas.
“However, this [development] must be balanced against environmental and fishery interests,” said Terje Riis-Johansen, Minister
of Petroleum and Energy.
Several blocks are in the deep waters of the Voring basin, which
is a relatively underexplored area of the Norwegian Shelf.
Interest has been strong from small and medium sized oil companies as they seek to build their asset bases.
The deadline for operators to submit bids is Nov. 7. Winners
will be announced next spring. ✦

tion within 31⁄2 days, instead of the 5-7 days schedule originally
quoted. It has a 1.1 million bbl of oil storage capacity and recent debottlenecking increased its processing capacity to 25,000
b/d.
The company installed an expanded flare system and increased
the water processing capacity at the FPSO to accommodate production from its planned development well in Ebouri.
This area has the potential to produce 5,000 b/d of oil and its
development well is expected to come onstream in January 2009.
Vaalco plans to drill on Ebouri in mid-November using the Adriatic 6 jack up drilling rig. Once this starts production, Vaalco’s total
production will reach 25,000 b/d.
Last January, Avouma started production from two wells, which
currently deliver 10,000 b/d.
On the Etame block off Gabon, Vaalco will drill three exploration wells back to back using the Pride Cabinda jack up drilling rig,
Pride Cabinda. This area already produces 12,000 b/d.

Italian Castello gas ﬁeld development approved
Italy has granted Sydney-headquartered producer Po Valley Energy Ltd. a 20-year production concession for Castello gas field
near Milan.
It is the first concession grant in the Po Valley region since the
country’s gas sector was deregulated in 1998.
Po Valley Energy has completed construction of a surface plant for
Castello, and connection of the pipeline to the Italian national gas grid
500 m away will begin in December to be completed early in 2009.
Gas production is scheduled to begin in second-quarter 2009.
The field will be produced from a single well at an initial production rate of about 2.7 MMcfd of gas. The field’s remaining
proved gas reserves are put at 4.6 bcf of gas.
Some 12 bcf of gas was first produced from Castello field by Italian state company Eni over a period of 8 years during the 1980s.

ConocoPhillips lets contract for Greater Ekoﬁsk
ConocoPhillips has awarded the front-end engineering and design for its Greater Ekofisk area development’s 2/4 Z wellhead platform in the Norwegian North Sea to two John Wood Group PLC
companies, Mustang Engineering and JP Kenny.
Mustang will design the 7,400-tonne jacket and topsides for the
40-slot wellhead platform, which will be installed in 70-75 m of water.
JP Kenny will provide design services for subsea flow lines and
pipelines across the Greater Ekofisk area, “building upon a prior
contract to provide services associated with the subsea water injection,” John Wood Group reported.
The FEED project is expected to be complete by yearend 2009.

Pemex can ‘triple’ drilling program says ofﬁcial

drilling to an average of 1,800 wells/year from the current 600 as
the result of new contracting arrangements approved under reform
legislation, according to a senior company official.
Pemex Exploration & Production (PEP) director Carlos Morales
Gil told Mexico’s El Financero newspaper that the new contracts
provided for in the Pemex law—Regulating Article 27 of the Constitution—and to its amendments “are going to allow us to quicken the pace and build a stronger Pemex.”
In this regard, Morales told the paper that, with the substantial improvement in Pemex’s ability to execute projects on land and offshore,
the state-owned firm will be able to replenish 100% of its reserves by
2012 and begin developing deepwater deposits in 2014-15.
The boost in exploration capacity will increase output in the
medium term, so that it is back to more than 3 million b/d, the
level of Pemex production until 2007.
“We’re going to be able to generate more value and more oil revenue,” Gil said, explaining that the new legislation will enable Pemex
to offer incentives that will improve services from contractors.
In particular, Morales said the new contracting arrangements
would provide an additional incentive for companies to work hard,
improve, and be more efficient, creating more value for the Mexican people.
Morales said the new legislation empowers PEP to award contracts directly under certain conditions, as when safety and protection of the environment are involved or in the case of risk or
emergency.
All other contracts will be awarded under the traditional arrangement of competitive bidding, he said.
Morales emphasized that Pemex will be able to reach its targets
of higher production and reserves because it also will have greater
flexibility and capacity to manage its budget more independently.
He added, however, that greater accountability and transparency
would also be required of it.
He said the country would likely not have to import crude oil
to meet its needs.
“We don’t see the possibility of Mexico becoming an importer.
Pemex is producing 2.8 million b/d, which is far more than we
consume—1.3 million b/d on average.”
Morales’ views largely echoed those of Energy Secretary Georgina Kessel Martinez, who told delegates at a conference: “As a
result of the reform that has been approved, the country would
reverse the decline in crude oil production that we have seen in
recent years.”
Kessel said that, due to the new legislation, Pemex “will be able
to develop highly complex deposits, such as Chicontepec and the
deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, in an effort to boost output,
the rate of reserve replenishment, and the rate of recovery at our
deposits.” ✦

PetroSA’s $11 billion Coega reﬁnery moves ahead
South Africa’s Department of Minerals and Energy in early October granted a manufacturing license to PetroSA for its Project
Mthombo—an $11 billion, 400,000 b/d refinery to be built in the
Coega industrial development zone outside Port Elizabeth.
KBR has completed a prefeasibility study for the project, and
PetroSA has received about 30 bids for the feasibility and the

front-end engineering and design phases. These are expected to be
awarded shortly, according to PetroSA Chief Executive Sipho Mkhize.
PetroSA said that a strong focus will be given to “maximum
black economic-empowerment participation,” and emphasized
that “proven experience in projects of the planned refinery’s size
and nature” was a primary consideration.
PetroSA more recently named UK-based KBC Process Technology Ltd. as technical and commercial services advisor for the development.
HSBC, London, is project financial adviser for the refinery. HSBC
will provide fiscal guidance and manage project investment funding and structuring arrangements for PetroSA.
A final decision on constructing the project will be made, possibly in 2010, after the feasibility and FEED studies are completed.
The refinery is expected to be operational in 2014. ✦

Vopak pursues new Turkish storage terminal
Royal Vopak plans to construct an oil products storage terminal on the coast of the Sea of Marmara in the vicinity of Yalova,
Turkey.
The company has bought GY Elyaf ve Iplik Sanayi Ticaret
Anonim Sirketi from Global Yatırım Holding AS, the Turkish public natural gas and power generation company, for an undisclosed
sum. It will submit applications to secure necessary permits and
prepare marketing, technical, and economic plans. “Thereafter a
final investment decision to construct the terminal can be taken,”
Vopak said.
The 26-ha industrial plot of land will serve the greater Istanbul
area and store liquid bulk chemical, oil, and vegetable oil products.
Vopak said its customers were interested in using independent
storage facilities around the Sea of Marmara because of its major
development.

Oman sells its 7% stake in CPC to Russia
Oman has sold Russia its stake in the Chevron Corp.-led Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), which owns and operates the
1,580-km Tengiz-Novorossiisk oil pipeline.
“Rosimushchestvo (Russia’s federal property agency) has finalized the deal to buy Oman’s 7% stake in CPC,” confirmed Igor
Dyomin, a spokesman for Russia’s state pipeline monopoly OAO
Transneft.
In early October, an Omani official said the Arab country would
consider selling its stake, but that no firm offer had been made.
“If the offer is right, then why not? We have had a few interested parties but nobody put in a firm proposal,” said an Omani
finance ministry official.
The Omani government gave no reason for selling its stake, but
industry sources said Muscat had grown frustrated over protracted
disagreements among the consortium members about funding expansion of the pipeline.
Russia had long opposed the plan to double the capacity, saying
the pipeline yielded low returns and that its expansion would add

pressure to the already congested Turkish Straits shipping route.
But Russian objections ended when most of the partners agreed
to raise the shipping tariff to $38/tonne from last year’s $30.24/
tonne and when investors agreed to reduce interest rates by 50%
on a $5 billion loan to CPC.
BP PLC, however, still opposes the expansion plan and said it
might also sell its 6.6% stake—held through Lukarco and Kazakhstan Pipeline Ventures—if the CPC partners do not reach a compromise.
Russia owns a 31% stake in CPC through Russian crude pipeline monopoly OAO Transneft, while the Kazakh government has
a stake of 19%.
Other CPC shareholders are Chevron 15%, Lukarco 12.5%, a Rosneft-Shell joint venture 7.5%, ExxonMobil 7.5%, Eni 2%, BG 2%, Kazakhstan Pipeline Ventures 1.75%, and Oryx Caspian Pipeline 1.75%.

Enbridge announces open season on Midla pipeline
Enbridge Energy Partners LP announced a nonbinding open
season for additional firm capacity on its Enbridge Pipelines (Midla) LLC subsidiary’s interstate natural gas pipeline system. Enbridge
said the proposed expansion will allow Midla shippers improved
access from the Perryville hub to the ANR Pipeline in Franklin Parish, La., the Transco Pipeline in West Feliciana Parish, and industrial
facilities in the Baton Rouge area.
Each of the connections will receive an additional 25 MMcfd
on the system by virtue of new compression. Enbridge anticipates
project completion in third-quarter 2009.
The open season will begin Dec. 1 and end Feb. 28, 2009.
Imports from Northeast Texas into the Southeast US-Gulf Coast
region via Carthage-to-Perryville shipment were up an average of
1.8 bcfd as of July compared with the same period in 2007, including a 1 bcfd gain on CenterPoint’s CP Line and a 700 MMcfd
increase on Gulf South’s East Texas-to-Mississippi expansion (OGJ,
July 7, 2008, p. 74).
The Midla pipeline consists of 170 miles of 22-in. OD lowpressure pipeline running across Louisiana and Mississippi from
Perryville to Baton Rouge. ✦

Tons of confusion
I read your article “Musings on ‘M,’”
and I agree wholeheartedly about the
confusing nature of certain abbreviations
in our industry (OGJ, Oct. 27, 2008,
p. 18). ‘M’ in particular never gave me
much trouble, but there are a few that
do.
I am from Houston, and my oil and
gas experience is grounded in American
abbreviations such as “MCF/d,” “bbl/
day,” and, in particular, the larger numbers associated with those. Any decent
industry publication has articles about
Gulf of Mexico projects that will produce 250,000 bbl/day or transportation
projects that will move 1.2 bcf/day (or
850 MMCF/day), and we all completely
understand the approximate scope of the
project. However, I have seen countless
examples of projects that talk about gas
in terms of “bcm” and oil in “million
tons.”
While I know the approximate value
of bcm and tons in relation to mcf and
bbl, the math is complex for a casual
reader, and it is no fun to actually try to
make a conversion to get an idea of the
scope of the project. I think the European measurements are fine, but can
someone please make it a convention
to at least put the English equivalent in
parentheses for us non-human-calculator
types?

So Alabama adapted its underground

requirements and court directives.

Board David E. Bolin at the October
2007 hearing: “Substantially increased
administrative and production costs

benefit.”
In 2004, EPA completed a study
that concluded “that the injection of
hydraulic fracturing fluids into coalbed

to underground sources of drinking
water.”

He’ll stay on this crusade if he
displaces Dingell. And if he succeeds in
raising the costs of producing natural

climate change.

Cause vs. outcomes
Any effort to limit emissions of
carbon dioxide has to emphasize
gas. Almost half of US gas production now comes from unconventional
reservoirs—coalbeds, tight sands, and
shales—and the share is rising. Most
such reservoirs require hydraulic fracing, raising the costs and regulatory
burden of which would constrict gas
supply and lift prices. That’s no way to
lower carbon dioxide emissions or help
energy consumers.
Liberal fire-breathers like Waxman,
of course, never heed self-contradictions like these. To them, the presumptive righteousness of cause trumps
practical worry over outcomes.
Waxman’s lightning assault on the
energy committee bespeaks a legislature
in political turmoil. For a new president, the obvious void in perspective
represents an immediate test. ✦

Obama’s energy program
Because political promises exist to be broken,
no one would feel morally usurped if PresidentElect Barack Obama ignored the energy program
on which he and his running mate campaigned.
According to early reports, however, energy will
receive high priority when Obama and his vicepresident, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, take office
in January. The prospect is troubling.
The Obama-Biden energy platform calls for
heavy spending by government on uneconomic
forms of energy in pursuit of three overall goals:
energy independence, a “solution” to climate
change, and the creation of 5 million “green” jobs
associated with governmentally sponsored energy.
These goals are, at best, dubious.
Energy independence is unachievable. Under
any set of regulatory and economic circumstances,
the US will continue to need more energy than it
can produce. To think otherwise is delusional. Policy predicated on energy independence is doomed
to wasteful failure. Similarly, climate change is
not something to be solved; it is natural. Even
if human activity influences climate change—a
proposition that is by no means certain—the effect
can’t be great. People might change their activity profoundly and expensively without affecting
climate change much, if at all. And jobs “created”
by government energy programs inevitably come
at the expense of jobs destroyed by the forced
substitution of costly for cheaper energy.
In pursuit of these popular but misguided
goals, the Obama-Biden energy program would,
among other things:
• Divert profits from oil companies to rebates
for energy consumers.
• Close regulatory “loopholes” that encourage
“excessive energy speculation.”
• Draw light crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be replaced later with heavy oil.
• “Tackle climate change” with an aggressive cap-and-trade system for managing carbon
emissions, and use proceeds from the auction of
emission credits to fund “the next generation of
biofuels and clean energy vehicles.”
• Create those “green jobs” with a variety
of programs funded by $150 billion in federal
spending over 10 years.
• Tighten vehicle fuel-efficiency standards.

22

• Set mandates for sales of electric and flexiblefuel vehicles.
• Raise the mandate for fuel ethanol to 60 billion gal/year by 2030.
• Set a “national low-carbon fuel standard”
that would require fuel suppliers to cut the carbon
content of fuel by 5% within 5 years and by 10%
within 10 years.
• Require oil and gas companies to drill on or
lose federal leases.
• Promote specific oil and gas activity, such as
production from unconventional resources in areas already producing, construction of an Alaskan
gas pipeline, and enhanced oil recovery by carbondioxide injection and sequestration.
• “Diversify” energy sources with a renewable fuel standard for electricity and incentives for
clean coal technology and nuclear energy.
• Use regulations to cut energy consumption.
This approach, heavy with regulation, has been
tried before and only wasted public money. Overregulation creates little more than the chance for
energy opportunists to enrich themselves at the
expense of consumers and taxpayers. It inevitably
gives way to market forces that the government
can neither anticipate nor supplant.
The impending regulatory assault on energy
would occur not only in service to illusory goals
but also in an economic context much different from that in which it first appeared. Obama
outlined his energy agenda while oil, gas, and
other energy prices were extraordinarily high and
while the economy seemed reasonably healthy.
Those conditions have changed. As usual, market
responses have relieved consumers of the pain of
high energy prices before the government could
act. And the economy has taken a frightening
downturn that should make the government loath
to undertake any expenditure that doesn’t promise
certain benefits.
The context changes give Obama an escape
route. He should take it. The US can’t afford more
energy mistakes. The country has steered itself
onto a fanciful energy course by choosing to
indulge mindless outrage over high gasoline prices
rather than give careful thought to why prices got
so high. On energy, America needs to grow up. If
Obama is serious about change, there’s a place to
start. ✦

investment project. Valero expects the
hydrocracker project to be completed
in fourth-quarter 2010 and the coker
project to finish in second-quarter
2011. Contracts were awarded to Fluor
Corp. for the hydrocracker project (OGJ
Online, Aug. 7, 2008) and Technip for
two processing units—a saturate gas
recovery unit and an amine treating
unit—and offsites work associated with
the refinery expansion.
A coker and refinery expansion
project at the Wood River, Ill., refinery,
a 50-50 joint venture of EnCana Corp.
and ConocoPhillips, began in September, says EnCana. The $3.6 billion
project includes a 65,000-b/d coker to
enable the refinery to process heavier
crudes, increase total crude distillation
capacity by 50,000 b/d to 356,000
b/d, more than double heavy crude
refining capacity to 240,000 b/d,
increase clean-product yield to 330,000
b/d from 250,000 b/d, and eliminate
40,000 b/d of low-value asphalt production. The project will be operational
in 2011.
In October, Petroleos de Venezuela
SA (PDVSA) began construction of
the 100,000-b/d Santa Ines refinery,
in Barinas state (OGJ Online, Oct. 13,
2008). The $1.2 billion complex is being developed in two phases: the first is
scheduled for completion in 2011 with
an initial capacity of 30,000 b/d, while
the second will be reached in 2014,
bringing the plant to full capacity. The
facility will refine oil from Barinas and
Apure states, as well as oil from the Orinoco heavy crude belt. It will produce
regular and high-octane gasoline, LPG,
diesel, kerosine, fuel oil, and asphalt.
Santa Ines is one of four domestic refineries either under way or planned. The
others include the 50,000-b/d Caripito
refinery, a 200,000-b/d refinery in the
state of Zulia, and a 400,000-b/d refinery at Cabruta.
Meanwhile, Petrovietnam awarded
Foster Wheeler a contract to design the
200,000-b/d Nghi Son refinery and
petrochemical project (OGJ Online, July
22, 2008). The refinery is expected to
meet 60% of Vietnam’s domestic de-

One technology makes
all three work together. Smart.
Openhole completions have become more complex and challenging.
Completion assemblies have become more restrictive and sensitive to
chemical treatments. Operations dictate accessibility and more precise
timing for removing filter-cake barriers. We developed the SMART RDF*
family of systems to overcome these challenges.
The SMART RDF family is a comprehensive portfolio of drill-in fluids and
compatible breakers that work together seamlessly, giving you precise
control and predictable behavior during completion operations. This
proven technology gives drilling, completion and production engineers
the performance and results they need.
Now you can create a high-performance water- or oil-base filter cake that can
be destroyed in a predictable, controlled manner — no aggressive chemicals
and their potentially destructive consequences on the reservoir and/or
completion assembly. With SMART RDF systems protecting the formation
and completion assembly, you can achieve maximum performance from
your well, whether it’s a producer or injector.

Midcontinent Express Pipeline, a joint venture of Kinder
Morgan Energy Partners LP and Energy Transfer Partners LP, is
currently constructing the Midcontinent Express gas pipeline. The 506-mile interstate system will deliver as much as
1.5 bcfd of gas to customers in the southern and eastern US
through 30-in., 36-in., and 42-in. gas transmission pipeline in Oklahoma, northeastern Texas, northern Louisiana,
central Mississippi, and Alabama. The system also will include
a 4.1-mile lateral in Louisiana and other related facilities,
including 111,420 hp of compression at four compressor
stations and one booster station. The pipeline is scheduled to
be in service by early March 2009, the companies reported.
Project cost is $1.27 billion.

ow long have we been talking
about Royal Dutch Shell PLC’s
Corrib natural gas field development
off the northwest coast of Ireland?
Too long, but it looks like we’ll be
talking about it even more in the
future.
“It will be at least 2 years, even if
we started building now without any
difficulties,” said Irish Energy Minister Eamon Ryan. “It is a very difficult
project,” he said, adding, “We are
talking years rather than months.”
Corrib field, estimated to contain 1 tcf of gas and due to come
on stream in 2009, has been beset
by protests and delays ever since its
discovery in 1996.
Local people want Shell to process
the gas at a shallow-water platform
as they fear that onshore processing
at Bellanaboy would bring a pipeline
too close to their homes.

lanaboy facility was the “only way”
to resolve the issue.
“That cannot be on the agenda,”
said Ryan.
“There is a legal process that has
been gone through. There has been a
planning process and we cannot supplant and replace An Bord Pleanala,”
said Ryan, referring to the country’s
national planning board.
“What we can change is the
dynamic that has happened in the
absence of government involvement,”
said Ryan, adding, “We are now putting government center stage.”

Opposition persists

Ryan rejected criticism that the
forum was a case of too little, too
late.

he said. “It’s better to do this than

better accommodate the project and
will prove to be advantageous for the
project company,” Jum’ah said.
The companies had requested bids
to be submitted during December but
expect that the project will be rebid in
second-quarter 2009. Meanwhile, to
ensure project continuity, the firms will
maintain joint engineering, start-up
planning, and other preparatory activities.
The Yanbu refinery, which had a
price tag of $6 billion when it was
announced in 2006, was one of four
plants Aramco planned to increase its
refining capacity. But equipment and
labor shortages have pushed costs up
globally in the energy sector, casting
doubt on whether the projects would
go through as planned.

Uncertainty in Aramco
The decision regarding Yanbu follows earlier reports suggesting uncertainty in the Saudi national oil company
regarding the effect that the current
global financial crisis would have on its
projects.
Earlier this week, an Aramco executive director said the firm is reviewing
some of its long-term projects following the sharp decline in oil prices and a
dramatic slowdown in demand growth
for crude.
“We are going back to our partners
and discussing with them the new economic circumstances,” said Khaled alBuraik, an executive director at Aramco.
“We are not talking about delays, we are
talking about reviewing.”
Al-Buraik said a decision on the
projects would be made based on the
re-evaluation process, and that Saudi
Arabia and other countries would be
conducting their own reviews in the
wake of changing dynamics.
“People would like to go and reevaluate, and maybe some projects were
evaluated at $80 or $100/bbl—now we
are talking about $65/bbl,” he said.
Al-Buraik said he thinks the whole oil
industry will re-evaluate new expansions:
“It will be reassessed based on the current

IPAA: Unconventional gas changing US supply picture
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Shale gas plays helped US natural gas
production increase within the last year,
while US oil production continues to
decline, said speakers at the Independent Petroleum Association of America’s
annual meeting Nov. 11.
“This is the era of shale gas plays in
North America,” said Jeff Wojahn, president of EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc.
Wojahn spoke during a chief executive roundtable at the IPAA meeting in
Houston along with Mark Papa, chairman and chief executive officer of EOG
Resources, and Porter Bennett, president
and chief executive officer of Bentek
Energy LLC.
Papa said, “It will be interesting to
see how many additional resource plays
will be found and how they will develop…. Technology that started in the
Barnett shale [of North Texas] is now
migrating to Canada and to the rest of
the world.”
The US Geological Survey classifies
the Barnett as an unconventional gas
play. Barnett shale wells are known for
long-lasting production and a high drilling success rate. Two other shale plays,
Haynesville in Louisiana and Texas, and
Marcellus in the US Northeast, also are
expected to boost US production.
“Geologic risk is now very low,”
Papa said, and it’s not as difficult to find
32

significant quantities of gas as it was
10-15 years ago. He expects more plays
to be found and that large independents will be the primary developers of
regional unconventional plays.
Wojahn said horizontal drilling
and advances in hydraulic fracturing
technology has enabled oil executives to
devote more time to cost management
and efficient operations than to finding
the gas in the first place.
Papa said horizontal drilling has been
“the biggest game changer” that he has
seen in his 40-year career in oil and gas.
“There always will be a place for
conventional oil and gas,” Papa said.
“But if you stay away from horizontal
drilling, as an independent you are
dealing with a smaller portion of the
pie.”

Barnett shale
The Barnett shale has been the single
biggest driver in US gas production
growth, Papa said. Barnett shale production is about 4.4 bcfd today compared
with 1 bcfd in production 4 years ago,
he said.
EOG estimates Barnett shale production will peak next year at 4.8 bcfd and
then hold at a plateau for 2-3 years
before gradually winding down. Papa
notes that estimates vary and that some
within industry expect the Barnett to
peak at 6 bcfd.
Johnson County, Tex., “will be drilled

up like a pin cushion” by yearend 2009,
he said. Wojahn said EnCana is staying
out of the Barnett shale peaking discussion. But he noted that emerging technology typically finds a way to sustain
production for long periods.
“The Barnett shale may not be that big
driver of growth as it has been, but it will
remain a source of supply,” said Wojahn.
Porter said the US now has abundant, predictable gas supplies but that
lawmakers who are keen on promoting alternative energy probably do
not understand the availability and the
economics of natural gas.
Wojahn said, “I think all of us collectively as natural gas independents have
to step up to the plate and start educating the government.” ✦

Analysts assess possible Obama administration actions
Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
Voting machines had barely cooled
down earlier this week before energy
analysts began to evaluate the apparent election victory of Ill. Sen. Barack
Obama.
In the Houston office of Raymond
James & Associates Inc. (RJA), analysts
reported Nov. 6: “One overarching
point is that history would suggest that
energy prices often move higher under
Democratic administrations due to
supply-constraining policies. All in all,
we do not see the Democrats’ victory as
a game-changing event for either conventional or alternative energy.”
After announcing transition team
members and appointing Rep. Rahm
Emanuel (D-Ill.) as his White House
Chief of Staff, President-elect Obama is
to consider a proposal by the Washington-based Center for American Progress
(CAP) for creation of a National Energy
Council within the White House. Transition team co-chair John Podesta is serving as CAP president.
Analysts at Friedman, Billings,
Ramsey & Co. Inc. in Arlington, Va.,
reported that Obama’s goal is to have
a coordinating council to make sure
federal agencies are working together
for a clean energy economy. Currently,
energy policy decisions are scattered
through a half-dozen federal agencies
and coordinated through three: the
Council on Environmental Quality, the
National Economic Council, and the
National Security Council.
RJA analysts said, “Our fundamentally bullish long-term thesis on the
energy complex is based on the longterm structural imbalance between
ever-increasing energy demand and
constrained energy supply. This imbalance is not something that governments
can eliminate,” adding, “Even the centerpiece of Obama’s energy platform—
binding carbon emissions caps—is not
something that will likely impact the
34

fundamentals of the oil and gas industry, or the coal industry, anytime soon.”
Despite “macroeconomic developments” over the past 3 months that

said, “We have a negative stance on natural gas given the prospect of a meaningful US gas oversupply in 2009—[T]he
fundamentals for conventional energy
are not unique to the US, and in the
grand scheme of things, it does not
matter very much who is in the Oval
Office or on Capitol Hill. For alternative energy, stronger leadership from
Washington that Obama has pledged
would certainly facilitate greater domestic growth in renewables, adding to the
policies that are increasingly visible at
the state level.”

Other propositions
But expensive alternative fuel programs may be hard to enact during
troubled financial times. Clean Energy
Fuels Corp., leading provider of natural
gas (CNG and LNG) for transportation
in North America, noted that California
voters on Nov. 4 rejected Proposition
10, the California Renewable Energy
and Clean Alternative Fuels Initiative.
That was a $5 billion, first-in-thenation public investment to provide
funds for a wide variety of clean energy
projects across the state, including consumer incentives for clean alternative
vehicle fuels and construction of renewable energy generation facilities, such as
solar and wind power plants.
“Passage of Prop 10 would have provided an important funding mechanism
to rapidly turn these goals into a reality
throughout the state,” said Andrew J.
Littlefair, Clean Energy Fuels president
and chief executive officer.

US-Europe relations
One of the earliest and most comprehensive analyses of the election
came from Chatham House, home of
the Royal Institute of International Af-

fairs, a leading institute for debate and
analysis of international issues. According to director Robin Niblett, Obama’s
first job “will be to keep Americans safe
and not to please the international gallery,” adding, “This does not mean that
Europeans should resign themselves
to be disappointed. To start with, the
Obama campaign has pulled together
a talented and deep bench on foreign
policy. They are ready to act and, with
a strong Democratic majority in the
Senate, can expect to be confirmed into
their posts quickly.”
But as an Obama administration
juggles its complex domestic and
international agenda, Niblett said, “[It]
should expect its European allies to step
forward with their own suggestions of
how to implement realistic transatlantic
policies towards each of our common
challenges. The success of Obama’s foreign policy initiatives in his first term
will depend significantly on what European capitals can deliver and not just on
his administration’s own creativity.”
Further, the deepening economic
crisis of recent months “will make it
even harder for Obama to focus on new
US international initiatives, never mind
changing US policies on Afghanistan,
Iran, the Middle East peace process,
climate change mitigation, and the rest
of the wish-list that many in Europe are
hoping for,” Niblett said.

US-Africa relations
Alex Vines, research director and
head of the group’s African program,
said, “Reining in stratospherically high
expectations both from within Africa
and from within his own administration will be a principal preoccupation
for the first years of Obama’s Africa
policy.” He said, “The large number of
Obama’s campaign advisors with Africa
expertise under the Clinton Administration such as Susan Rice and Witney
Schneidman, are impatient to make
their mark. The danger is that, as with
the first British Labor administration

of 1997, impatience and overconfidence both underestimates the political complexities of African states, and
chafes with socially conservative African
leaders, leading to misunderstandings,
blunders, and set-backs.”
Vines said, “There are many good
policy proposals, including a secretary
of state for overseas development assistance to rationalize America’s generous
but ponderous aid programs. However,
public relations is key, and as China and
other emerging powers gain greater
influence across the continent, Obama’s
Africa team will have to take ever
more care that good intentions are not
blunted by poor diplomacy.”

“Obama should be able to take advantage of rapidly improving relations
between Taiwan and China to soften the
relationship, but concerns over trade,
will remain a threat.”
In the past Obama has voted against
increasing the number of work visas offered in Asia, but lately he has suggested
increasing the number of professional
migrants. “The fact that this is a key
issue, despite the economic difficulties
the US faces, demonstrates the continued attractiveness of the US,” said Price.
Because he spent his formative years
in Indonesia, Obama brings greater
cultural awareness of the diverse region
than any previous president.

US-Asia relations

Economic recovery

Meanwhile, Gareth Price, head of the
group’s Asia program, warned: “While
the fresh start is widely welcomed in the
region, [Obama’s] protectionist impulses
have caused concern, notably in India
where his talk of ending tax breaks for
US companies that move jobs offshore
has gone down badly. However, “most
assume” that, when in office, Obama’s
hands will be tied and that his rhetoric
will not become practice, Price said.
“A likely shift away from a securitydominated agenda formulated in
response to the threat of radical Islam
is to be welcomed,” Price said, “but in
Afghanistan and Pakistan, enabling that
shift, in a worsening security climate,
will be challenging. There seems little
likelihood that he will call a halt to air
strikes within Pakistani territory, continuing to alienate Pakistanis.” He added,
“His threat to tie military aid to performance in the fight against the Taliban
and Al-Qaeda could cause rifts between
the US and Pakistani military, but his
shift towards economic development
assistance may help shore up the weak
democratic government in Pakistan.”
Price foresees little change in US
relations with China. “The aims will
remain the same: to identify common interests and work together; to
acknowledge dependency, especially in
the economic sphere; and to manage
areas of clear conflict,” he said, adding,

“The downward lurch of the US
economy during the final month of
the campaign undoubtedly helped
[Obama] win the election. Can he now
return the favor by arresting the economic decline?” asked DeAnne Julius,
Chatham House chairman.
“The fundamentals are against him,”
Julius said. “A strong contractionary
spiral has taken hold as households curtail spending and banks curtail lending,
while house prices continue to drop,
and unemployment mounts. A US recession is ‘baked in the cake’ regardless of
the stimulus package the new Congress
decides to enact.”
Nevertheless, said Julius, “Psychology will be as important as policy in
sparking the eventual recovery. The preelection vacuum of leadership clearly
contributed to the dire state of consumer confidence and the precipitous drop
in the stock market during October. This
[Obama] has a good chance of fixing—
starting even before the inauguration.
The sight of a young, new president
articulately engaging with other world
leaders next week in Washington could
be the spark that rekindles the optimism
for which Americans are widely known
and admired.”

US-Middle East relations
Claire Spencer, head of the Chatham
House Middle East program, said: “Ex-

pectations for a change in US direction
towards the Middle East are high, especially amongst the Arab populations of
the region. The recent US attack within
Syria is seen as a last ditch attempt by
the Bush presidency to pressure the
Syrians into controlling their border
with Iraq and curbing their alliances
with both Iran and Hezbollah. However,
this is seen to be going against a wider
trend, supported in Europe and Israel,
to engage with Syria through negotiations and diplomatic enticements. It is
anticipated that the new US presidency
will fall into line with this.”
Spencer said: “The main headaches
for the US administration will remain
the three ‘I’s’: Iran, Iraq, and the lingering Israel-Palestine conflict. In none of
these areas will the new presidency have
much room for maneuver over the first
few months. Withdrawal of US forces
from Iraq will depend on the shape that
the still unresolved ‘State of Forces Agreement’ takes. There is no guarantee that
the outgoing Bush administration will
agree to terms with the Iraqi government
in time for the projected Dec. 31 deadline, when the [United Nations] mandate for the US presence in Iraq runs out.
This could prompt a crisis of legitimacy
in January 2009, yet in managing this,
the new administration will be guided
more by ‘facts on the ground’ than precipitate timetables for withdrawal.”
Iran’s presidential elections in midsummer 2009 will not see a change
in official positions over the nuclear
issue, “even if President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad fails to secure a second
term,” Spencer said, adding, “The
dilemma then to be faced is how US
officials might engage with Iran in ways
that don’t concede too much ground
from the now weakened UN Security
Council sanctions regime.”
Although it may pain Obama’s supporters to hear, the state-run Iranian
newspaper claimed Obama is no better
than Bush. Although prospects for an
armed US-Iran conflict “will be close
to zero” under Obama’s administration,
Iranian officials expect him to engage
a “more circuitous route but his aim is

the same as his predecessor…[Obama]
considers talks not as a means to a
solution but as a means to exert more
pressure…[with] a stronger position
to negotiate with Russia, China, and
Europe to impose tighter sanctions,”
Spencer said.
In the Middle East, Spencer said:
“The greatest expectation is that the
new US presidency will change its
tone—away from the language of
the ‘global war on terror’ to a more
detailed understanding of the local and
regional dimensions of change since
2003. Already, Washington, DC, is buzzing with new ‘strategic plans’ to combat
terrorism and engage anew with the
Islamic world. Whether US policy will
reflect the wider reality that other actors
are now taking the lead remains to be
seen. The [Persian] Gulf states, China,
India, Russia, and Turkey (inter alia)
have moved the balance in the financial,
diplomatic, and energy sectors away

from the central role once played by
the US as the region’s main security
guarantor. Where this affords local actors and states such as Iran more leeway
to resist US pressure, local hopes placed
in a ‘post-Bush’ era for the Middle East
may well be disappointed.”

US House, Senate
The Democrats’ advantage in the US
Senate rose to 57-40 on Nov. 6 after
Sen. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) conceded
to Democrat Jeff Merkley. On Nov. 7,
three Senate races remain “too close to
call” (Alaska, Georgia, and Minnesota),
where Republican incumbents would
lose their seats to Democratic newcomers; upsets in all three states would give
Democrats a 60-vote filibuster-proof
majority.
Meanwhile, FBR analysts reported
that House Oversight and Government
Reform Committee Chairman Henry
Waxman (D-Calif.) announced he will

challenge John Dingell (D-Mich.), for
chairmanship of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee (ECC). Dingell
is the longest-serving member and de
facto Dean of the House (see p. 20).
According to CongressDaily, “Success
for Waxman will likely depend on support from the large California delegation and liberals who feel Dingell’s
support of the automobile industry and
concern about automobile emissions
limits would prevent strong environmental legislation.” FBR analysts said
Environment and Energy News quoted
an unnamed “refining industry lobbyist” as saying, “Given the scope of jurisdiction of the [ECC], all hell will break
loose legislatively if Waxman [becomes
chairman].”
Waxman reportedly favors letting the
Environmental Protection Agency deal
with climate change legislation while
Dingell would prefer for Congress to
retain that responsibility. ✦

A play for gas-condensate and oil in
the fractured Upper Devonian Woodford shale formation is emerging on the
Oklahoma side of the Anadarko basin.
The Woodford shale, thought of until
relatively recently as a source rock, has
developed into a considerable gas producing formation in the Arkoma basin
on the opposite side of the Nemaha
ridge, and production is also emerging
in the Ardmore
basin.
Cimarex
Energy Co.,
Denver, began
assembling
acreage about
18 months
ago to drill the Woodford as a primary
objective in the Anadarko. Cimarex
said the play holds potentially 1.5 to 2
tcf recoverable to the company. Several
other operators are believed to be pursuing or evaluating positions as well.
Cimarex amassed 50,000 acres in
Woodford-prospective areas of centralwestern Oklahoma and in late October
completed the acquisition of a further
38,000 net acres from Chesapeake Energy Corp. for $180 million. The acreage
is in Blaine and Canadian counties.
Only $5 million of that transaction
went for reserves, Cimarex revealed. It
was the last large block to be acquired
in its core area in the Woodford play,
the company said.
Linn Energy LLC, Houston, announced the sale of its deep rights including the Woodford shale interval in
certain central Oklahoma acreage to an
undisclosed buyer on Oct. 10 for $229
million, subject to closing adjustments.
That sale included no producing assets,
and Linn Energy retained the shallow
rights.
Continental Resources Inc., Enid,
said it held 111,000 net acres in early
November 2008 in the Anadarko Woodford shale.

still drilling or being completed.
Drilling totals 31 wells by all operators, Cimarex said, and the other three
wells were still being drilled in late
October.
Continental Resources said it was
drilling two operated wells in the play
as of Nov. 6. The company holds a mix
of acreage, some of which is held by
production from other formations.
Other companies in the emerging
play include Devon Energy Corp. and
Western Oil & Gas Development Corp.,
both of Oklahoma City. Other companies appear to have HBP acreage and
may be evaluating their positions.
Cimarex looks for the average well to
recover nearly 5 bcf on 160-acre spacing with a 4,000-ft lateral. Wells with
that lateral length have averaged initial
production rates of 5 MMcfd.
Cimarex defines the Anadarko Woodford as occurring at 11,000-16,000 ft,
where it is 120-280 ft thick, has 3-9%
total organic carbon, good porosity
and permeability, and gas in place of
145-195 bcf/sq mile. The Woodford
represents “a big, multiyear drilling
program in a play we like,” said F.H.
Merelli, chairman, chief executive officer, and president of Cimarex. The company is already studying the desirability
of downspacing to 80 acres.
Half of Cimarex’s 88,000 net acres is
held by production from other formations, so the company is in control of
development timing rather than being
governed by lease expiration deadlines.
Well cost could moderate slightly
from the current $8.5 million to $9
million, Cimarex said.
The company said it was dropping
five rigs in the Texas Panhandle, but it
expects to be running 9-11 rigs in the
spring of 2009, up from five operated
rigs in late October 2008.
While climbing learning curves on
drilling and completion techniques in
the Anadarko Woodford shale, operators will be deciding how far west they

(Energy
Information
Administration,
2006).
As a
result, oil
companies are intensifying efforts to
meet global demand. These efforts must
be made in E&P, especially towards the
discovery and development of new reservoirs, by improving the performance,
developing feasible new technologies,
and reducing costs. Once drilling and
completion represent a major percentage of the field development cost,
companies will concentrate their efforts
on those segments.
Some of the current challenges in
drilling and completion segments are:
high-pressure/high-temperature drilling; drilling through salt layers; deep
wells; ultradeepwater horizon; extended-reach wells; complicated trajectory
wells; and rig availability.

Material properties
Because the material parameters of
the tubular samples were not provided
by the manufacturer, we determined
them from uniaxial tension tests, based
on nine specimens removed from the
tubes in the longitudinal direction

each tube was instrumented with two
uniaxial strain gages, applied in the

(three samples per tube).
We determined the elastic characteristics of the material (yield strength
and Young’s modulus) and obtained a
stress-strain curve in the elastic-plastic
regime.

As previously mentioned, an experimental setup was designed and built at
the Subsea Technology Laboratory to
reproduce the expansion of full-scale
tubulars with diameters up to 152.4
mm. Its function is expanding the tube
under tension. The main parts are hydraulic actuator, grips, and screw-driven
expander cone.
The cylinder imposes displacement
to the expander cone through a long
screw. The cone, in turn, expands the
tube in the radial direction. One edge of
the tube (where the expansion process
begins) is fixed by grips, while the
other end remains free.
The expansion is carried out in
three steps. Initially, the cone is forced
inside the tube between one edge and
the first-stage grip with the hydraulic
cylinder. Then we remove the first-stage
grip and force the cone further along
the length of the tube until the maxi-

The expanded tubes had their initial
ends cut off to prevent undue influence of the boundary conditions in
the expansion process on the collapse
pressure. Thus, the specimens remained
with a length of 1,500 mm instead of
the original 2,000 mm.
Seeking the collapse pressure determination, we tested three expanded
solid tubes in the pressure vessel. For
purposes of comparison, we also exposed three nonexpanded solid tubes
to external pressurization. The collapse

Since the tubular undergoes large
plastic deformation, we used an elasticplastic material behavior. We followed
a kinematic hardening plasticity model
in addition to the isotropic model in
order to simulate the Bauschinger effect (reduced yield stress under reverse
loading after plastic deformation has
occurred in the initial loading). The material properties input to the program
depend on the tube being analyzed and
are based on the properties determined
from the uniaxial traction tests.

6.5-1), which can simulate the coldexpansion process and the behavior of
solid tubes under external pressure. The
modeling took into account material
kinematic hardening, contact between
tubulars and the conical expander, and
geometrical nonlinearities.
We simulated the expansion process
and the external pressure loading until
collapse, using implicit integration of
the equilibrium equations in two steps.
The models were capable of successfully
reproducing the physical experiments.
After using experimental results to
calibrate, we used the models to analyze
further the mechanical behavior of solid
expandable pipes and the influence of
the expansion process in their structural
strength against collapse.

Geometry

and one in Direction 3. Therefore, only
one fourth of the tube was modeled,
reducing the number of equations to
be calculated and, consequently, the
computational time.
We built the geometry of each tube
as a deformed body, based on the
actual geometric properties of each
tube. The values used were the average diameter and thickness and the
maximum ovalization found along the
length of each specimen. We created
the mesh in a Fortran routine to allow
the model section to have an elliptical
shape. It provides the desired ovalization, which has a maximum value in
the middle of the tube and decreases
toward each end.
We modeled the cone as an analytical
rigid body, with a reference point (RP)
to control its displacement and permit
the expansion. Its corners, where contact may take place, were smoothed to
avoid any possibility of inducing stress
concentration.

We developed 3D finite-element
models of a solid tube and a conical
mandrel using Abaqus (Fig. 6). Since
there is no axial symmetry that allows
reduction of the model, the tube geometry was build with the same length of Material properties

We used 3D quadratic solid elements
(C3D27) and carried out a refinement
study to determine the ideal mesh. A
typical mesh had 80 elements in axial
direction, 2 elements in thickness, and
10 elements in the angular direction.
The angular direction was divided in
the following configuration, with one
element in every section: 10°, 10°, 15°,
15°, 10°, 10°, 7.5°, 7.5°, 2.5°, and
2.5°. In this way, areas that are expected
to suffer larger deformations and stress
were more refined. Fig. 6 shows details
of the mesh of the tube.

Interaction, load,
boundary conditions
We modeled the contact between the
mandrel and the internal surface of the
tube in accordance with the Coulomb’s
friction law, but because the experiment
was conducted with grease between the
surfaces, we set the friction coefficient
equal to zero. In future simulations, this
parameter can be easily changed to add
the friction effect.
During the first step, as in the expansion test, no load was applied. In the
second step, to simulate the collapse
test, we applied pressure on the external
surface of the tube and an equivalent
pressure, in axial direction, on the
lateral area of the tube. The latter pressure was used to reproduce the effect of
hydrostatic load that occurs inside the
hyperbaric vessel (Fig. 7).

In order to reproduce the experimental tests, we used specific boundary
conditions. During the first step, the
edge of the tube where the expansion
begins was constrained in direction one
(axially), simulating the second and
third-stage grip assembly. In addition,
we applied an axial displacement to the
cone reference point to move it forward
while it was being constrained from
rotating. For the collapse step, one end
was constrained in all directions, while
the other edge remained free in the
axial direction. We varied the boundary
conditions, in displacement and velocity. Fig. 7 contains loads and boundary
conditions for both steps.

between the original model and the
model without axial loading is small
for this case, it does vary from model to
model depending on the geometry and
process being analyzed.
When the Baushinger effect is disregarded, the difference between the
determined collapse pressures is much
bigger. Model T2SFE-02NBE showed a
collapse pressure 65% greater than the
original one given by model T2SFE-02.
Thus, the inclusion of both effects is
essential for the model reliability.

Experimental-numerical
correlation
Table 3 contains results from experimental tests and numerical analyses; it
also shows the difference in percentage between both collapse pressures.
To achieve this correlation, we adjusted
the numerical model to reproduce the
experiments.
We found good correlation between
experimental tests and numerical
analyses, proving the reliability of the
numerical model. Once validated, the
model can be used to analyze further
the expanded tube behavior and to realize a parametric study.

Parametric study
Fig. 12 shows the relation between
the collapse pressures (Pc), for expansion ratios ranging from 5% to 20%,
and the collapse pressure (Pco) of the
nonexpanded tubulars.
For each expansion ratio, we carried out different analyses, varying the
tubular diameter-to-thickness ratio
(D/t) between 14 and 26. Table 4
shows the collapse pressure (Pco) of the
nonexpanded tubular for each D/t. The
maximum ovalization in the midsection
of the model was 0.5%, and the material properties were the same as used
for model T2SFE-02.
We observed a considerable reduction in collapse pressure with increasing
expansion ratio. This reduction is related
primarily to changes in geometry (D/t
ratio) and, as mentioned on the preceding page under the Numerical results sidehead, to the stress induced anisotropy

caused by strain-hardening (Bauschinger effect). Interestingly, expansion
has an overall very similar detrimental

ratios. On average, an expansion of 5%
results in a 29% decrease in collapse
pressure (Pc/Pco = 71%). For expansion
ratios of 10%, 15%, and 20%, the average values of Pc/Pco are 58%, 52%, and
48%, respectively.
This parametric study allows determination of the D/t ratio needed to
obtain a specific collapse pressure for
a tubular after it has been expanded to
different magnitudes. In order to find
the necessary diameter-to-thickness

to further analyze the behavior of solid
expanded tubes. ✦

Refining

The global engineering contractor industry is experiencing a
C
shortage of qualified
manpower, according
Petrochemicals to a biennial survey of
refiners and petrochemical producers.
Operating companies rank qualifications of key personnel as the most important
consideration in
choosing
engineering contractors.
Other
important factors include detailed
engineering capability, experience with
similar work, and construction capability of the contractor.
These are some of the conclusions
of a survey of the global downstream
engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) industry conducted by
Transmar Consult Inc., Houston.
The study, sponsored by the senior
management of most of the leading EPC
contractors, is based on 109 interviews
with key decision makers in refining and chemical companies. During
January-April 2005, Transmar conducted interviews in North America, China,
Europe, Southeast Asia, and most of the
producing countries in the Middle East.
The interviewees’ areas of responsibility include:
• Engineering, 20%.
• Construction, 15%.
• Project management, 16%.
• Planning, 13%.
• Procurement, 17%.
• Senior management, 19%.
“The downstream hydrocarbon
industry is in a state of dramatic transition,” the study said. “This transition
is marked by a diminishing availability
of experienced technical manpower
resources and equipment.”
The study said that this downward
trend is occurring at a time when the
demand for project resources is reaching unprecedented levels. The study

therefore attempted to:
• Provide insights into the changing
forces affecting the global EPC marketplace.
• Review the performance of specific
EPC companies and identify any regional differences.
• Provide the opinion of plant owners on specific issues that may influence
the global EPC marketplace.
• Identify and analyze the key buying factors that owners use to select an
engineering contractor.
• Identify “rising stars” amongst the
different EPC companies.

Global reﬁning outlook
The vast majority of owner interviewees were optimistic about the 5-year
outlook for the global refining industry,
the study said. Refiners see most refinery investments occurring in the Middle
East and Asia due to abundant inexpensive crude feedstocks and a growing
middle-class consumer group, respectively. The owner interviewees projected
that refining capacity will grow about
10-14 million b/d during the next 5
years. Most of new capacity will be built
in the Middle East and Asia, and 1.5-2.0
million b/d of capacity will be added in
developed countries via capacity creep
in order to handle heavier and more
sour crudes.
“The new production coming out
of the Middle East or for that matter
Canada, thanks to the oil sands, means a
lot more sour crude to process,” said a
strategic planning executive for a large
refiner. “I see a lot of upgrading work to
handle the heavy crude and a diminishing of the crack spread between heavy
and lighter crude. Our internal forecasters are planning on a global refining
capacity increase of 10-11 million b/d.”
According to the study, interviewees
felt that future refining margins would
be sufficient to support $15-25 billion/
year of capital spending during the next
5 years.
“Without doubt, the Middle East
will be the number one spot for capital
investment,” said a senior manager for
Saudi Aramco. “We see growing capital

spending throughout the world for
refining. In 2008, it should surpass $18
billion globally.”
Also, study interviewees believe that
the crack spread between lighter and
heavier crudes will significantly diminish in the future.
“Over recent years much capital was
expended on deep conversion, hydrocracking, to take advantage of the hefty
crack spread; however, the crack spread
is narrowing and that money stream
will close out,” said a vice-president of
operations for an independent refiner.
“There will be less of this type of investing in the future.”
The study said that the one downward force on capital spending is “the
technical manpower and equipment

efficiently spend the capital funds allocated for the refining industry.”

areas, preferring to invest in the Middle
East and Asia due to low-cost feedstocks
and booming consumer markets. The
study interviewees predicted that capital
investment spending for petrochemicals
will be about $15-20 billion in 2008,
with similar amounts spent in the next
few years.
The study said that owners see a “bifurcated” petrochemical market in that
there will be several world-class mega
projects and many smaller projects in
the $10-100 million category.
“There will be 300 or more petrochemical projects in the Middle East for
some time to come. There will be a few
very large ones and many smaller ones.
There will be even more projects going on in Southeast Asia, but generally
smaller,” according to a senior technical

nies continues. Many of these companies are moving into fine chemicals and

• New Middle Eastern petrochemical companies are increasingly open to
using Asian engineering contractors,
especially those in South Korea.

Technical resource shortage
The study said that owners are far
more aware of the resource shortages
than they were in the 2005-06 study
(OGJ, Apr. 10, 2006, p. 44). Many
operators are currently implementing
plans to mitigate manpower shortages.
All the major oil companies are
establishing programs to attract more
young graduates. And some are starting
programs to retain employees beyond
retirement age, according to the study.
“For years, we made use of our
own technical staff with the support
of a few engineering contractors. This
worked fine for a long time, but when
our projects became larger and then the
seller’s market for services arrived, we
were in trouble,” said a senior executive
for Air Liquide. “The technical manpower shortage made it difficult for us
to compete for good technical people.
These circumstances led us to eventually
buy Lurgi and acquire more than 2,000
engineers for our needs.”

a seller’s market, the priorities of the
selection criteria changed quite significantly, according to the study.
The study said that the “top seven
buying factors are performance and
execution-based factors and that execution factors and ‘time’ are now taking
precedence over ‘cost or price.’”
Results of the buying factors survey
showed some interesting trends, according to the study:
• HSE is the third most important
factor that owners consider.
• In 2005, “quality of senior management” was ranked 18 compared
with a current ranking of 8. This is
because “owners want to forge links
with a contractor’s senior management
in order to assure that it gets the best
people from the contractor.”
• The “detailed engineering capability” factor was the fourth most
important in 2005 and eighth in 2001.

Now it is the second most important.
According to the study, “in a manpower
shortage environment, ‘big is better’
and owners attach real importance to
the depth of engineering capacity of an
engineering contractor.
• “Contractor’s price” has dropped
to 11 from 2 in the 2003 study because
“owners are more concerned about
getting their project completed than in
extracting the very lowest price for the
work.”
• “Responsiveness and flexibility”
have fallen to 14.

Overall contractor trends
The study found that the ratings
of the performance of South Korean
contractors have been rising. For the
first time since 1983, a South Korean
engineering contractor is ranked in the
“best” list—the top 14 contractors out
of 50 reviewed.

In addition, many owner-operators
are more willing to use what used to be
considered second-tier contractors, according to the study. This is a direct result
of the technical manpower shortage.
Owner-operators are working with
engineering contractors in new ways.
In some instances, this entails paying a
premium for access to the best employees in the engineering contractor’s
company. Other owners are signing
multi-project contracts to ensure continuity of the technical resources needed
to perform the work.
In general, owner-operators feel
that performance standards—quality
and capacity of the global engineering contractor industry—have declined
significantly. Many owners are therefore
increasing their conceptual engineering staffs, which allows them to better
supervise and control contractor performance, according to the study. ✦

the cross-flow amplitude. The in-line
amplitude is smaller than the crossflow amplitude, but occurs at twice the
frequency of the later. The minimum
fatigue life on the riser string (4,549
years) occurs at the weld between the
LTSJ and the LASJ. The TRA’s minimum
fatigue life is 808 years.

FSHR deployment
The fatigue damage the system
incurs during installation must be
limited to leave most allowable damage for when the riser is in-place.
Toward this end engineers considered a
45-tonne clump weight attached to the
pull-down bar of the offtake spool to
reduce VIV-fatigue damage should current speed go beyond the 80% nonexceedence limit during installation.
Summing maximum damage from
each step (after the correction based
on the duration of each step) along the
riser length yields total fatigue damage
during deployment due to wave motion. Maximum damage equals 0.0234
(without safety factor), close to the
riser base (within the lowermost quad
joint).
Fatigue damage peaks along riser
length correspond to pipe held in the
hang-off module (HOM) during welding. Fatigue concerns during welding limit the time pipe can be held in

The accompanying table
outlines the FSHR monitoring system.
The load-monitoring
spool sits at the lower end of
the tether chain and provides a real time indication
of the tension supplied by
the BC. The 18-in. OD spool

equidistant locations around
its circumference with
pressure-balanced oil filled
linear variable differential
transformer-based extensometers.
The FSHR’s positioning package
stands independent from the rest of
the monitoring system, consisting of
two ROV-retrievable acoustic beacons
mounted on the TRA. An acoustic
phased-array transceiver on the FPU’s
acoustic Doppler current profiling carriage interrogates the beacons. The line
of sight between the acoustic transceiver and the beacons on the TRA is
unobstructed.

Towing the BC in this state took 66
hr to cross the 267 km to P-52’s location.
Deep Blue performed the following
tasks while the BC was being readied:
• Keelhauling the LRA and suspending it on the HOM.
• Welding 32 riser quad joints.
• Transfer and welding of the UTSJ
to the riser string.
• Temporary lowering and suspension of the riser string beneath the hull.
• Transfer and flange connection of
the TRA to the riser string.
• Lowering and temporary hang-off
of the riser assembly from moon pool
pad eyes (Fig. 3).
Completing this work readied the
riser for subsea connection of the BC.
The following occurred upon arrival
of the BC at the installation site:
• Installation of guidelines to the
TRA.
• Pendulum of the BC.
• Keelhaul of the BC from outriggers
to moon pool.
• Connection of BC fairleads to the
guidelines.
• Removal of riser suspension slings
• Subsea connection of the BC to the
TRA (Fig. 4).
• Deballasting the BC.
Offshore activities performed to
connect the FSHR to its foundation
included:
• Installation of the pull-down suction pile on seabed by the DB (the pile
was later retrieved).
• Installation of the pull-down
system on top of the suction pile by the
DB.
• Installation of the pull-down
buoys on the pull-down system by the
DB.
• Transfer of buoyancy: preliminary
deballasting to get the FSHR positively
buoyant.
• Pull-down operations and locking
the riser onto its base (Fig. 5).
• Final deballasting to in-place conditions.
• Cleaning all installation aids.
The deballasted FSHR floats at 50
tonnes positive buoyancy above the

foundation before pull-down. The
45-tonne clump weight (CW) used
by the DB to control the orientation of
the BC also orientated the FSHR to the
appropriate heading and controlled the
buoys during pull-down. The DB deployed the CW to depth and connected
it to the pull-down buoys. A 16-tonne
CW connected to the bottom of the
TRA allowed the Geoholm to maintain
FSHR position in the current during
pull-down.
Lay vessel Sunrise 2000 installed
the flexible jumper. The vessel required
modifications to install the 16-in. ID
flexible jumper. An ROV-actuated hydraulic connector attached the gooseneck to the flexible jumper’s end at the
FSHR side and vertically connected it
to the mandrel at the TRA. Unreeling of
the flexible jumper then allowed it to
be pulled-in to the slot on the P-52. An
installed closing spool connected the FJ
to the P-52’s piping facility.

Why just
tell them
you’re an
expert when
you can
show them?

Installation HAZID
A hazard identification (HAZID)
review preceded FSHR installation. Its
results detailed the hazards identified,
associated risks, and mitigating measures. The review also provided a summary of the action items arising from
it. Each manager-engineer in charge of
a particular process or task then took
responsibility for ensuring all items
under his supervision were closed out,
completing action items prior to the
commencement of installation operations whenever possible. Some actions,
however, required on-site remediation.
Once work was under way, changes
to scope, limits, etc. could affect the
HAZID findings. The responsible engineer, therefore, would continually
monitor any changes to the project
and assess the need for any updates to
the HAZID. An offshore management
change procedure managed new work
developed offshore or on site and performed risk assessment. ✦

New diversion service for shale-fracturing operations
The new StimMORE fluid diversion
service diverts fracture treatments along a
wellbore in cemented or openhole completions. The service is especially suited for
use in shale formations.
Used in combination with the StimMAP LIVE hydraulic fracture stimulation
diagnostics service, which delivers microseismic data while the fracture treatment
is pumped, the StimMORE service allows
real-time optimization of fracture treatments.
StimMORE can be used in most well
geometries and is suited to horizontal
wellbores, cased hole and open hole, up to
a maximum temperature of 121° C.
The diversion slurries can be pumped
on the fly as part of the main treating
fluid, diverting the fracture as needed
based on the real-time integration of microseismic data. The slurries are based on
standard fracturing fluids and proppants,
with the addition of a proprietary mix of
materials that enable fracture diversion.

The StimMORE service is part of the
Contact portfolio of staged fracturing and
completion services. These technologies
allow the company to create complex
drainage patterns within the reservoir that
enable access to reserves that may have
otherwise been left in place.
The StimMORE refracturing treatment
was recently applied to one operator’s
horizontal well in the Barnett shale. Initial
gas production of 2.2 MMcfd had declined
to less than 500 Mcfd during a 4-year
period. The StimMORE service, coupled
with the StimMAP LIVE real-time fracture
monitoring service, enabled efficient and
cost-effective coverage of previously unstimulated well sections, resulting in a net
increase in estimated ultimate recovery of

SUBSEA TIEBACK FORUM & EXHIBITION

THE DEEPEST SHOW ON EARTH
March 3 - 5, 2009
Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center | San Antonio, TX

SUBSEA TIEBACK
FORUM & EXHIBITION

PennWell invites you to the 9th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition. SSTB has become the premier
event for one of the fastest growing sectors of the offshore oil and gas industry. This year’s SSTB is scheduled
for March 3 – 5, 2009 in San Antonio, TX at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center. Over 2,500 people and
150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference. You can’t afford to miss it.
This year’s theme is “The Deepest Show On Earth.” As our industry changes, the sharing of knowledge and
collective experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety, and economics of the
subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by industry leaders. As in the
past, only by participating in this conference will you be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will
not be published and no Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room stays inside the conference
room. We hope you will join us.

Waxman challenge
might be a climate
change power play
A chairmanship challenge at the House
Energy and Commerce Committee may be
the ﬁrst step in a power play over climate
change.
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) conﬁrmed in a Nov. 5 statement that he will
seek to become chairman of the committee,
now headed by John D. Dingell (D-Mich.).
Waxman is chairman of the Committee
on Oversight and Government Reform, a

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

position that has enabled him to exercise
his considerable talent for embarrassing
witnesses, mostly Republicans.
When the Executive Branch moves into
Democratic hands in January, leadership of
the oversight panel won’t be much fun for
a gotchameister. So it’s no surprise that the
very liberal and ﬁercely partisan Waxman is
looking for new dragons to slay.
Challenging Dingell, who has held ofﬁce
since 1955, longer than anyone else in the
House, is especially brazen.
For the oil and gas industry, the change
would mean the difference between mere
antagonism and outright hostility.
The motive may be climate change.
Supporting this suspicion is a rumor about
another power move among House Democrats.
Ed Markey of Massachusetts might challenge Rick Boucher of Virginia for chairmanship of the energy committee’s Energy and
Air Quality Subcommittee.
Markey is chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global
Warming, a position that expires in January. Like Waxman, Markey dislikes oil and
gas and supports aggressive measures on
global warming.
Dingell and Boucher have in fact been
working on global-warming legislation and
circulated a draft bill last month.
Environmental groups, however, have
criticized them for being lenient with automakers and the coal industry—important
constituencies for congressmen from
Michigan and Virginia. If the Markey rumor
comes true, the two-front insurgency will
look like payback to the environmental
groups that supported Democrats in this
month’s election but that dislike the DingellBoucher approach to climate change.
And if the challenges succeed, the only
resistance left against the costliest possible
response to an uncertain threat will be
worry over harm to a slumping economy.
An important question then would be
who might remain willing to call a rush to
futile sacriﬁce the folly that it is.

OPEC’s compliance should tighten markets
If the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries can achieve just 60% compliance with the 1.5 million b/d production reduction voted at its Oct. 24 meeting, there
would be at least a “small” reduction in consumer oil inventories through 2009, said
analysts at KBC Market Services, a division of KBC Process Technology Ltd. in Surrey,
UK. “Greater OPEC compliance or further setbacks to non-OPEC supplies could leave
the market quite tight,” they said.
As it stands, the proposed 1.5 million b/d cut “would, allowing for Iraq and Indonesia, take total OPEC crude output to about 30.5 million b/d,” said Paul Horsnell,
Barclays Capital Inc., London. He said, “That is 2 million b/d less than current output.
It is also 700,000 b/d less than the latest OPEC Secretariat forecast of the call on
OPEC crude across 2009; 400,000 b/d less than the International Energy Agency’s
forecast of the call; and 1.5 million b/d less than the US Department of Energy forecast.” Horsnell said, “There is then some slack built into the decision, in that it would
still represent a signiﬁcant market tightening after any further large downgrades in
demand expectations.”
Rapid fall of oil prices in October produced “a meeting of minds” among OPEC
members not evident at its Sept. 9 session, said KBC analysts. Crude futures sales
in October represented the biggest monthly loss for front-month crude prices since
that commodity began trading in 1983 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
front-month contract was down 32.6% or $32.83/bbl during October and ﬁnished the
month 54% below a record-high of $147.27/bbl in July. Panic in both the equity and
commodity markets over deteriorating demand for energy prompted OPEC’s Oct. 24
decision to cut production effective Nov. 1, after taking no action at its Sept. 9 session.
OPEC’s October meeting “was a quantum leap in cohesion” from its September
session, especially since the October meet was called at short notice, emphasizing
OPEC’s urgency to put a ﬂoor under oil prices. Moreover, it was fully supported by all
OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia. OPEC’s cutback announcement was quickly
followed by actual reductions by the UAE, Kuwait, Iran, Qatar, Nigeria, and “crucially” by Saudi Arabia, making it “clear on this occasion that the producer group
means business. OPEC has a proven track record as a highly effective price defensive cartel,” said KBC.
Previously, oil price movements were closely correlated to other ﬁnancial indicators, especially to exchange rates and strength of the US dollar vs. the euro. Since
August, said KBC analysts, oil prices have closely followed equity markets, with both
falling sharply as leading Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
economies entered recession, while growth slowed markedly in developing countries. However, they said, “The fundamentals of the oil market itself have begun to
play a much more important role, with oil demand destruction a major driver of the
recent collapse in oil prices.”
Price volatility
According to KBC Market Services, OPEC now has the opportunity to reduce
harmful oil price volatility resulting from the ﬁnancial sector’s domination of futures
markets. Oil market volatility has increased exponentially since 2004 when OPEC lost
control of the ceiling oil prices because of its lack of spare production capacity. “This
will increase next year to above 4 million b/d as cutbacks coincide with additions to
capacity,” KBC analysts reported.
Earlier suspension of OPEC’s price band mechanism indicating a target range for
crude prices “invited speculators to explore the boundaries to oil prices,” analysts
said. It also prevented OPEC from responding quickly to price changes. KBC analysts
said, “OPEC should now reintroduce a price band of $70-90/bbl, around the level of
$80/bbl, which is close to the current maximum sustainable level for producers. It
also provides sufﬁcient incentive for consumers to exploit marginal sources of supply. There would be beneﬁts to both producers and consumers in terms of security of
demand and supply and also a sharp reduction in volatility.”
With front-month crude trading below $63/bbl in late October, KBC reported
speculators have taken a net short position of 8,000 contracts in NYMEX. “This is an
unusual foray to the short side, leaving some potential for speculative short covering
to provide support to any reversal in oil price direction,” KBC said.
Meanwhile, KBC analysts said, “OPEC has done enough to provide a ﬂoor to oil
prices at above $60/bbl, while concerns over the global economy may restrain oil
prices from moving substantially above $70/bbl into the ﬁrst quarter of 2009.”

Oil & Gas Maintenance Technology
Conference and Exhibition

Pipeline Rehabilitation &
Maintenance Technology
Conference and Exhibition

Maintenance means money. In the world-class,
global-scale oil and gas operations of the Middle
East, maintenance means big money.

_________________________

www.oilandgasmaintenance.com l ____________________
www.pipeline-rehab.com

The Oil & Gas Maintenance Technology
Conference and Exhibition brings together
professionals from the Middle East and around
the world to discuss practical solutions to real
problems. It includes sessions on predictive
and preventive maintenance, reliability and asset
management and maintenance management.
From vibration analysis to corrosion control to
contracting practice, the conference addresses
maintenance and inspection issues affecting tanks,
compressors, rotating equipment, pipelines, gas
plants, reﬁneries, instrumentation and more. The
exhibition represents a showcase of technical
innovation.
Because harsh conditions and operational scale
make the Middle East a proving ground for
maintenance practice, the Oil & Gas Maintenance
Technology Conference and Exhibition will attract
worldwide attention. PennWell Corporation and
Oil & Gas Journal are pleased to offer industry
leaders this rich opportunity to exchange ideas
and to learn.

Bob Tippee
Editor, Oil & Gas Journal

Current high oil and gas commodity prices make
oil spills and vapor escapes from operating
pipelines more costly than ever before. At the
same time, public and governmental pressures
on pipeline operators to protect air, water, and
ground environments have never been greater.
The convergence of these factors heightens the
need for pipeline operators to share experiences
in monitoring and controlling system ﬂows
and diagnosing and rehabilitating lapses in
line integrity. As Middle East producers and
processors ramp up their operations to meet
greater hydrocarbon energy demand, this
conference stands as an established and leading
forum in bringing together operating and service
companies and their technical and management
personnel to learn the latest and best in pipeline
rehabilitation and maintenance.
The previous nine conferences have ﬁrmly
established the value and need for an international
specialised meeting to examine issues centered
on the ﬁtness for purpose question of oil and
natural gas transmission lines.

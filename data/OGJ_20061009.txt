COVER
An operator controls an element of a processing plant with
next-generation automation and control systems—a Honeywell Experion PKS and newly designed vertical series C I/O.
Process control systems are becoming more important as refiners
and petrochemical plant operators focus on them to improve
operations. This issue’s special report, Process Control Technology, begins on p. 44 with an article that discusses the issues of
cyber and physical security risks to process control systems. The
second article, p. 52, discusses a holistic, best-practices approach
that helps refiners and petrochemical plant operators sustain and
improve the performance of control system assets. Photo from

Analysts see robust future for oil sands
The outlook for Canadian oil sands growth continues to improve, although the next 2 years could prove critical as oil companies face the risks of increasing cost overruns and project delays,
said Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc.
In a Sept. 29 research note update on oil sands, an FBR analyst
said increasing project proposals also increase the risk profile for
the Canadian oil sands because of an already tight labor market.
“We believe that the risks of cost overruns and project delays
will be increasing over the next 2 years, with the greatest risk being borne by those who have yet to firm up their cost estimates
and to order key critical equipment,” said Amir Arif, FBR senior
vice-president.
He estimates 25-30% cost inflation from 2004 levels for new
projects that will be firmed up in 2007 with risk of an additional
10-20% cost overruns related to labor, steel, and line pipe costs,
along with infrastructure and logistic issues.
Noting that the number of oil sands projects planned in Alberta
have been steadily climbing, FBR estimates the cumulative capital
to be spent in the oil sands, based on announced projects, amounts
to more than $125 billion (Can.) This is a 140% increase from
FBR’s 2003 estimate of $52 billion.
The increase is a result of both new projects being announced
and additional cost pressures on previous cost estimates, Arif
said.

Sakhalin-2 project faces more authorization woes

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

that most often these rivers have been made unsuitable for spawning,” Mitvol said.
Mitvol said at least 3 months would be needed to draw up a full
picture of the state of Aniva Bay after construction work has been
carried out there for the Sakhalin-2 project.

Concerns aired over Brazil lease round exclusions
Some international oil company executives have voiced concerns about Brazil’s National Petroleum Agency (ANP) excluding
the Campos basin and parts of the Santos basin from the country’s
Nov. 28 licensing round.
Excluding these areas from the 8th licensing round makes it
“less attractive,” Alvaro Teixeira, executive secretary of the Brazilian
Petroleum & Gas Institute, told OGJ.
Most of the field development activity undertaken by international firms is concentrated in the Campos basin, which produces
80% of Brazil’s output of 1.8 million b/d of oil.
“Is the exclusion of these basins a sign that there will be changes concerning policies for future licensing rounds?” Teixeira posed.
“Brazil’s Mines and Energy Minister Silas Rondeau reaffirmed that
the rounds will continue as normal and that the 9th Round will
probably be announced right after the 8th round. We will see,” he
said.
The IBP executive said: “In the short term, there will be a reduction in the rhythm of annual investments in exploration. In the
medium and long terms, there will be a postponement in investments to develop potential commercial discoveries of exploration
work that was also postponed. The end result will be a reduction in
the pace and or maintenance of the present rate of oil production
in the next 6-7 years.” IBP is a 50-year-old, nonprofit, private organization with 220 associates including most of the multinationals
operating in Brazil.
ANP placed 284 blocks on offer in the upcoming 8th Round
(OGJ Online, Sept. 12, 2006). The blocks being offered are in seven
sedimentary basins and are considerably less in number than ANP’s
previous announcement of 1,153 blocks in 18 basins.
ANP justified excluding the Campos basin by saying, “A wide
selection of acreage is to be put up for auction, including areas
considered to have great potential for both oil and gas, new frontier blocks, and blocks in mature areas.”
ANP considers 35 offshore areas as high potential blocks, 153
offshore blocks as new frontier basins, 47 onshore blocks as new
frontier basins (with little geological data), and 49 blocks in onshore mature basins.

Part of the pipeline built for the Sakhalin-2 project may have
been built without proper government authorization, according
to Oleg Mitvol, deputy head of the Russian Federal Service for the
Regulation of the Use of Natural Resources (Rosprirodnadzor).
Mitvol said the pipeline segment in question was built near the
village of Sovetskoye and passes through the Zubrovyy nature reserve. He believes that segment was constructed after “unauthorized rerouting.”
He said, “This is a crime punishable by law. We will examine the
situation and transfer all the evidence to the prosecutor’s office.”
Meanwhile, starting Oct. 2 Rosprirodnadzor began taking aerial
photographs of the complete pipeline, which was built as part of
the Sakhalin-2 project. The photographic results will be compared
to the relevant documents on file to establish whether there are
discrepancies between existing work and work authorized.
Rosprirodnadzor inspectors flew over a 200-km section of the
pipeline route by helicopter on Sept. 29. The survey revealed areas
prone to mud slides due to pipeline construction, Mitvol said.
He also noted the presence of incorrectly constructed crossings CAPP: Don’t upset Canada’s investment climate

North American natural gas, and chair of the Canadian Association
of Petroleum Producers, implored the Canadian government to not
“do anything stupid” regarding terms of investment in projects in
the country.
Sendall said Canada’s transparent and stable investment climate
acted as a balance to the relatively high production costs in the region and that any adjustments to terms of investments should only
be undertaken with the utmost caution, lest this balance be upset.
Sendall also said continued progress needs to be made to keep
Canada’s regulatory process untangled, making particular note of
the manifold jurisdictions currently required to weigh in on any
pipeline project before actual work can begin.
Even so, Sendall cited the combination of Canada’s resource
base, innovative technology, competitive global position, and environmental stewardship as key factors that will allow the country to
succeed as it sets a course toward becoming an “energy superpower.” She also said “pipeliners should be salivating” at the prospect
of bringing Canada’s hydrocarbon resources to market.

US House panel approves pipeline safety bill
The US House Energy and Commerce Committee passed a bill
Sept. 27 reauthorizing federal oil and gas pipeline safety programs.
It now has to be reconciled with a similar measure passed June 19
by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee before there
can be a final vote on the House floor.
Passage of the latest House pipeline bill by voice vote came
hours before Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee leaders introduced their own pipeline safety bill.
Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-Ark.) and chief minority member Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hi.) sponsored the measure to
reauthorize the federal Pipeline Safety Act for 4 years starting in
2007, with Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) as
cosponsors. Other provisions include a 50% increase in the number of federal pipeline inspectors to 135 from 90 at a cost of $6
million over 4 years, application of Department of Transportation
standards to all low-stress pipelines, and new civil enforcement
authority against excavators and pipeline operators responsible for
third-party damage. ✦

Mariner makes Gulf of Mexico discovery
Mariner Energy Inc., Houston, said it has made a material discovery with its 5ST1 well on High Island Block 116 in the Gulf of
Mexico.
The well, drilled to a TMD of 14,683 ft, encountered about 540
ft of net vertical pay in 13 sands. Completion operations are under
way, and initial production is expected later in the fourth quarter.
Mariner estimates that the well’s proved and probable gas reserves could be about 40-60 bcf. The company holds 100% working interest and a 72% net revenue interest in the well.
HI Block 116 is part of the asset base Mariner acquired from
Forest Oil Corp. in March.

Total-led group tests Yemeni oil well
A group led by Total SA reported the KHA 1-16 oil well in Yemen’s East Shabwa Development Area on Block 10 produced more
than 8,400 b/d when tested through a 70⁄64-in. choke, said participant Soco International PLC, London.
Test results extend Khairir oil field to the east beyond current
3D seismic survey data, Soco said. The well was drilled on the eastern-most 3D seismic parameter as part of a continuing appraisal
and development of the field’s basement reservoir.
KHA 1-16 spudded June 5 and reached a MD of 3,298 m. The
group will evaluate the well results to decide the best way to access
the extension, Soco said.
Block 10 participants are operator Total and Soco’s Comeco Petroleum Inc., each with 28.57% under a production-sharing agreement with Yemen. Other joint venture partners are Occidental Yemen Ltd. 28.57% and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co.
14.29%.

contract went to Italy’s Snamprogetti SPA and the Khurais gas contract was let to a consortium of Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. and Foster Wheeler Energy Ltd.
The Khurais program covers three oil fields: Khurais, Abu Jifan,
and Mazlij. The Khurais gas facility will process sour associated
gas produced from the three fields into an NGL product and a dry,
single-phase sour shipping gas. The plant will process a total of 563
MMscfd of sour associated gas and 70,000 b/d of condensate.
The program is the largest crude increment undertaken in Aramco’s history, the company said, and one of the largest industrial
projects being executed in the world today. The program is slated
for completion by mid-2009.
Snamprogetti’s contract calls for construction of four identical
crude processing and gas compression trains, along with the construction of inlet and outlet facilities to receive wet and sour crude
through upstream trunklines.
The Hyundai-Foster Wheeler contract includes construction of
two gas conditioning trains, crude and NGL storage facilities, product shipping facilities, and flares.
All related support facilities, such as roads, ponds, buildings,
electrical systems, and process control systems, are also to be provided under these contracts.

Stone Energy Corp., Lafayette, La., has resumed production
from its Amberjack platform on Mississippi Canyon Block 109 in
the Gulf of Mexico. The platform had been shut down due to damages caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Stone repaired and rerouted a severed oil pipeline and expects
production of 50-60 MMcfd of net gas equivalent during the
fourth quarter. This brings Stone’s overall fourth-quarter production to 250 MMcfd of gas equivalent.
Stone said limited oil production from the Amberjack platform
was initially restored in early September via barging.
Stone is the operator on MC Block 109 and holds a 100% interest since this summer (OGJ, July 17, 2006, p. 30). It also owns a
24.8% interest in Block 108.

Gas deliveries to UK begin through new pipeline
Gassco AS on Oct. 1 began gas deliveries from Statoil ASA-operated Sleipner and Troll fields in the Norwegian North Sea to Easington in the UK after opening flow through the 600 km southern
leg of the new Langeled pipeline.
This marks the completion of the first stage of the 1,200-km
submarine gas pipeline, the cost of which currently is estimated at
17 billion kroner—about 3 billion kroner below budget.
“We will complete all pipelaying on the northern leg this week,
which means we’ll manage to finish ahead of the winter season,”
said Leif Solberg, Langeled project director.
“The project has progressed on schedule,” he added. “What remains now is subsea connections and testing on the northern leg
until next summer.”
The northern leg, due to start up in 2007, lies in 360 m water as
far as Sleipner East field (OGJ Online, Sept. 18, 2006, Newsletter).
It is designed for an internal pressure of 250 bar, corresponding to
water 2,500 m deep, a record for Norway’s gas transport system.
The Langeled system will have a total capacity of 20 billion cu
m/year, one fifth of Britain’s annual gas requirements. This supplements the 12 billion cu m/year Vesterled system, which transports
gas from the BC Hydro-operated Heimdal platform to St. Fergus
in Scotland.

Wesfarmers plans Western Australia LNG terminal
Perth industrial conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd. plans to build a
$138 million (Aus.), 175-tonne/day LNG terminal and regasification plant in Kwinana, south of Perth in Western Australia. The
plant will supply natural gas for heavy-duty trucks as well as domestic industrial and electric power generation markets.
The company says that several years of trials involving 70 trucks
traveling more than 12 million km around Australia, has shown
that LNG is a viable alternative to diesel fuel.
Construction of the Wesfarmers plant is scheduled to begin in
10

November and come on stream in early 2008.
During the first 10 years of plant operation, Santos Ltd. will
supply up to 37 petajoules of gas feedstock from its 45% share of
production in the John Brookes gas field operated by Apache Energy Australia in the offshore Carnarvon basin. Gas deliveries will
be via the Dampier-Bunbury gas trunkline.

ABS issues design approval for CNG carriers
The American Bureau of Shipping has issued full-class design
approval for CNG carriers to Sea NG Corp., Calgary. The approval is
the first granted to CNG carriers, ABS said.
Sea NG’s proprietary Coselle system uses small-diameter highstrength steel pipe coiled into a carousel to store the high-pressure
gas. Each Coselle will comprise about 10 miles of 6-in. pipe used
for storing and transporting CNG.
Sea NG is expected to let contracts for construction of three
Coselle CNG carriers later this year. These first vessels, which will
carry the notation “A1 CNG Carrier,” will be designed to transport
gas 200-2,000 miles. They are intended to service projects in the
Caribbean or Mediterranean seas.
The vessels will be 120 m long and have the capacity to carry 50
MMscf of gas in 16 Coselles (160 miles of pipe). The 16 Coselles
are arranged in four stacks of four high in a fully enclosed and
inerted cargo house on the weather deck. The vessels will feature a
dual fuel propulsion system with bow thruster and also a proprietary high- and low-pressure manifold system for efficient loading
and unloading.
ABS Project Manager Harish Patel said, “This vessel design review and approval was undertaken using a risk-based design approach.”
This included a series of risk assessment studies, including HAZID, HAZOP, gas dispersion, and explosion models, fire, flaring and
heat radiation analysis, a jetting study, escape and evacuation studies, and inspectability analysis. ✦

Would you read a book
in which you’re the hero?
Buy for yourself and as gifts the oil industry thriller

13 Days:

The Pythagoras Conspiracy
by oil industry veteran

L. A. Starks

“13 Days weaves a gripping suspense plot around the
very real, and complex operations of oil refining. The
attention to detail and factual content is extraordinary,
while creating a spellbinding story that we hope could
not be real.”
KS - - - vice president, energy industry consulting firm
“Very realistic. Thankfully, most weeks aren't as intense as these are.”
CR - - - oil company vice president
“This was a very fast-paced book! I couldn't put it down! It is a superb blend
of the oil business, current events, and international intrigue. I felt like I was
experiencing a front-page news story.”
Kathy Norderhaug - - - former international oil executive
“A great thriller, in the tradition of John Grisham and Dick Francis. Full of
interesting insights into the energy business, 13 Days features a tightly woven
plot and vivid characters.”
Mike Barron - - - retired energy CFO and senior vice president

What could spike gasoline prices up again? Energy
executive Lynn Dayton thinks her challenge is fixing the
troubled refinery her company has just acquired on the
Houston Ship Channel. But soon she must save it, and
other oil refineries, from the industrial havoc and deaths
directed by a French saboteur, simultaneously fighting off
threats to her own life. As Lynn deals with chemical leaks,
disloyal employees, a new season of hurricanes, and
mounting casualties, Robert Guillard, a corrupted idealist,
plans to manipulate her through her vulnerable sister. But
Robert underestimates his prey.

The ethanol craze
Private businesses shut down mistakes that can’t
be fixed. Governments make hopeless programs
bigger and claim success.
With tax incentives and a market mandate, the
US government has stirred up a national craze over
fuel ethanol. Politicians from both major parties,
including President George W. Bush, have oversold ethanol as a way to reduce US dependence
on foreign oil and improve air quality. In truth,
the purpose is political: to stimulate agricultural
businesses and farm-state economies. There’d be
nothing horrible about that if the help came at no
one else’s expense. But the ethanol program costs
fuel consumers and taxpayers plenty.
The craze, however, has begun. Automakers
enticed by tax breaks have co-opted the ethanol
lobby’s environmental exaggerations to tout flexible-fuel vehicles. Politicians claim to have done
something for energy independence. And ethanol
plants, some of them helped by tax breaks, are
proliferating.

to exceed the minimum levels set by Congress.
But the wrong combination of oil and corn prices
could make a lot of ethanol capacity surplus to demand. If that happens, ethanol prices will slump.
At last report, of course, oil prices were falling. In
his statement, Collins said corn prices could set
record highs during the next 5-6 years.
When market-wrecking surpluses hit private
business, manufacturers respond by idling capacity. They permanently close plants that show no
hope of regaining profitability. Eventually, demand
restored by low prices combines with supply
lowered by capacity withdrawals to bring prices
back to profitable levels. The process is painful. But
it’s business.
This won’t happen with ethanol, which is
not a real business. The fuel ethanol industry is a
creature of government. Investors in ethanol plants
threatened by adverse corn and ethanol price
movements will naturally resort to government for
protection against the types of market risks real
businesses must manage on their own. And the

To guarantee its oil supply during
times of crisis, China is building a national tanker fleet with which it aims to
haul nearly three fourths of its oil imports within the next 15 years.1 China’s
tanker-building program appears to be
driven by a complex mix of commercial
and national security factors as it seeks
control over its entire oil supply chain.
The impact of this fleet-building
program on world tanker
rates and shipbuilding costs
merits the attention of
tanker operators worldwide.
Paradoxically, however, the
buildup of a state-controlled, Chinese-flagged
tanker fleet may actually
increase that country’s vulnerability to
energy supply interdiction.

nies. In peacetime, they will operate for
profit. Yet, in an oil crisis, state-owned
vessels would stand ready to be pressed
into service.

Beijing’s tanker ﬂeet
By 2010, China intends to transport
40-50% of its oil imports in government-owned tankers. By 2020, it hopes
to carry 60-70%.2 Chinese analysts
predict that by 2010 the country will
need as many as 40 very large crude
carriers (VLCCs) and a fleet capable of
transporting more than 700 million
bbl/year.
China currently owns 21 VLCCs that
cumulatively account for about 30% of
its tanker tonnage. Most of the remaining vessels are small or old tankers better suited for the coastal trade than for
international oil carriage. Meng Qinglin, a senior manager at Dalian Ocean
Shipping Co., estimates that Chinese
tankers are on average 30% older than
their international counterparts and
much smaller, averaging only 20,000
dwt (compared with a typical 300,000
dwt VLCC).3 Fig. 3 shows China’s current oil carriers and their VLCC fleets.
As it upgrades its fleet, China’s aggressive tanker-building campaign has
made it one of the world’s leading
tanker builders. It also builds smaller
tankers, but this article focuses primarily on VLCCs because most Chinese
oil imports come from distant areas
that require VLCC transport to remain
economically competitive. As shown in
Fig. 4, Chinese shipyards’ share of new
global tanker contracts has grown at an
average annual rate of roughly 30% over
the past 6 years.
Two primary national security factors
drive Beijing’s tanker fleet construction:
insufficient overland oil supplies and
the fear that terrorists, pirates, or the US
Navy could bottleneck its sea lanes.

Overland supplies
Oceanic oil transportation has
become one of Beijing’s chief strategic
concerns. Despite a highly touted new
pipeline from Kazakhstan and planned
lines from Russia, China for the foreseeable future will receive most of its oil
by sea. Indeed, many Russian observers believe that without immediately
launching a full-scale exploration and
production program in Eastern Siberia,
Russia likely will be unable to fulfill its
oil and gas commitments to China.4
Moreover, although private Russian
companies such as TNK-BP are ready to
supply China, assertive Russian statecontrolled companies hold projects up
until they can gain complete control.
Russia also fears a repeat of its experience with the Blue Stream gas pipeline,
which ran under the Black Sea to Turkey
in 2003. Once gas began flowing,
Turkey promptly refused to take further
deliveries until Gazprom slashed its
price, causing the Russian side serious
financial losses.
Thus, while overland oil imports
from Russia and Kazakhstan likely will
continue to grow, they will not solve
China’s dependence on seaborne oil.
Fig. 5 offers an estimate of trends in
China’s pipeline imports that assumes
Russia will be able to build and fill a
pipeline from Eastern Siberia by 2008.
Chinese leaders find it unsettling that
only 10-12% of the country’s imports
are carried by Chinese flagged vessels,
compared with Japan, which can haul
80% of its oil, and South Korea, which
carries 30% of its crude imports.5 Japanese oil transport companies are among
the world’s largest, while South Korean
and Japanese shipyards have for the last
few decades been the world’s premier
tanker builders.
Chinese officials are especially concerned that Chinese tankers haul almost
none of the cargoes that come from
the Middle East and West Africa, which
between them supply roughly 70% of
Chinese imports.6 In 2002, Chinese
tankers carried less than 4% of Chinabound cargoes from the Middle East
and none at all from West Africa. Some

OCS compromise eludes
US Congress energy leaders
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
US Senate and House energy leaders headed into the
preelection recess pledging to reach a compromise before
yearend, but were still divided over Outer Continental Shelf
oil and gas leasing reforms.
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Pete V. Domenici (R-NM) said he was disappointed that
an agreement was not reached before recess. “I hope the
House will take the necessary time in October to step back
and reflect on the number of compromises the Senate has
offered to break the current impasse,” he said.
“I hope the House recognizes what is politically possible
in the Senate,” Domenici added, possibly referring to the
promise by Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) that he would filibuster
any compromise that did not establish a 16-year leasing ban

House Resources Committee Chairman Richard Pombo
(R-Calif.) and five other House members—John E. Peterson
(R-Pa.), Neil Abercrombie (D-Hi.), Bobby Jindal (R-La.),
Charlie Melancon (D-La.) and Adam H. Putnam (R-Fla.)—issued a joint statement that they “have gotten very close to
working out the differences between our bill and that passed
by the Senate.”
They said remaining issues include questions over boundary lines in S. 3711, which the Senate approved Aug. 1, and
how the map lines will affect division of future federal OCS
revenues among Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi.
Louisiana’s two US senators apparently are divided over
negotiating tactics. “While I was working with others to
break the logjam between the House and the Senate, others
in our delegation chose to divert their time and energy to
blaming others,” Republican David Vitter said Sept. 29.

‘The deal is dead’
Three days earlier, Democrat Mary L. Landrieu said insistence by House conferees to retain HR 4761’s language
giving states on the east and west coasts shares of federal
coastal revenues if they allowed drilling 100 miles off their
own coasts was “holding back our chances for a fair compromise,” adding, “Until the House moves off this position,
the deal is dead.”
Vitter said, “As we continue to work on this key legislation, it’s not the time to attack the other party or the other
chamber, or to take extreme measures like placing holds
on dozens of unrelated bills. This will kill our chances, not
improve them.”

Landrieu did not respond directly,
but her communications director Adam
Sharp said Vitter was entitled to his
opinion “but the people of Louisiana
know that Sen. Landrieu’s voice has
been strong and effective in fighting for
Louisiana’s coast.”
In a separate statement on Sept.
29, Landrieu said she hoped S. 3711’s

W. Bush withdrew during his first term,
and adjacent deepwater tracts farther
south “will motivate House negotia-

tors to move away from their Atlantic
drilling strategy and toward the Gulf
Coast approach already embraced by the
Senate and the president.”
She said she would continue to
work with Domenici, Majority Leader
William H. Frist (R-Tenn.), Minority
Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Sens.
Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Mel Martinez
(R-Fla.) to achieve a compromise with
the House when Congress returns on
Nov. 13.
But Pombo and the five other House

members said Senate negotiators have
agreed that a bill must contain a provision to recover Gulf of Mexico deepwater royalties which were not collected
because price thresholds were not included in leases issued during 1998 and
1999, and to use part of those revenues
to help Gulf Coast states recover from
2005 hurricane damage.
“Finally, the Senate has acknowledged the need to expand and diversify
America’s energy infrastructure beyond
the Gulf of Mexico,” the six House
members said. ✦

power systems ebbed and flowed during that time period, Bowen said. Iraq’s
oil, electricity, and defense ministries
combine to protect the systems and
have varying capabilities, he said.
Security, however, is only one factor
in Iraq’s protection of its energy infrastructure, Bowen maintained.
“While much attention has been
focused on insurgent attacks, it must be
recognized that even if attacks ceased,
other factors, such as criminal activity and the effect of aging and poorly
maintained infrastructure on operating
capability, would continue to affect oil
exports and the availability of electricity,” he said.
He noted that Iraq’s oil exports
remained below established targets and
electric power generation was far below
demand when there were few insurgent
attacks from late April to early June of
this year.
“Further, once damage or disruptions occur, it is critical that it be
repaired quickly, but more needs to be
done to enhance rapid repair capability,” Bowen said.

take these tasks, Bowen said.
One way for the US government to
do this is to focus congressional attention on what Iraq’s new government
needs to do to protect and improve the
country’s energy infrastructure, he suggested.
Bowen said that current reports to

Congress by the departments of State
and Defense contain only general
descriptions of progress in Iraq instead
of specific information on actions
that Iraq’s government should take to
enhance energy infrastructure integrity
and progress it is making in those actions. ✦

Progress made
Bowen said the US government has
done much over the past year to help
make the Iraqi infrastructure security
forces more capable, as well as developing initiatives both to protect the
country’s energy infrastructure and to
facilitate transition of that responsibility
to Iraq’s government.
“The Iraqi government has much
to do if it is to implement US proposals as well as proposals put forth by its
ministries. Progress in acting on them
has been slow, in part due to the lack
of a permanent government and in part
[due] to the limited initiative of some
Iraqi ministries. Now that there is a
permanent government in place, it must
take bold action,” Bowen said.
He said Iraq’s new government is
pursuing energy improvement initiatives, including steps to increase the
country’s oil exports. “The challenge
for the United States is to help the Iraqi
government move forward” to under-

he news from Nigeria’s oil and
gas industry is not encouraging.
It’s that recurring problem of militants besieging the place again, but
this time they seem to be ganging up
on the industry.
Up to now, Nigeria—a member
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries—has been Africa’s
leading oil producer and the world’s
sixth biggest crude exporter with a
normal output of 2.6 million b/d.
But militants are threatening that
production.
Indeed, attacks on oil installations
in the Niger Delta have cut about a
quarter of oil production since the
start of this year, and at least five Nigerian oil workers have been killed.

“In good time we will redeem
our pledge to the people of the Niger
Delta to halt altogether the rape of
our land by the Nigerian government
and conniving oil companies,” it said.

Aimed at destruction

“As long as the injustice persists
in the delta, there will be no peace
for those who loot the wealth of our
oppressed people,” it warned. Leaving little room for guesswork, MEND
said: “Our goal remains the destruction of the Nigerian oil industry and
all who stand on the pathway to our
objective.”
The statement came on the heels
of the Oct. 2 attack on a site belonging to Royal Dutch Shell PLC

Two US House Government Reform
Committee leaders have demanded that
the Department of the Interior develop
a new plan to recover an estimated $2
billion of lost royalties from deepwater
Gulf of Mexico leases issued in 1998
and 1999.
Committee Chairman Thomas M.
Davis (R-Va.) and Energy and Resources
Subcommittee Chairman Darrell E. Issa
(R-Calif.) made their demand following US Minerals Management Service
Director Johnnie Burton’s recent statement that MMS did not have the power
to recover royalties, which have already
been lost. “This is absurd. That money
belongs to the federal government and
must be collected just as any other unduly conferred on a private citizen,” the
two lawmakers said in a Sept. 26 letter
to Interior Sec. Dirk A. Kempthorne.
While deepwater Gulf of Mexico
leases issued before and after 1998 and
1999 contain price thresholds when
holders would begin to pay royalties,
leases during those two years did not.
Burton has said this apparently was the
result of a communications breakdown
within MMS, adding that an investigation now under way by DOI Inspector
General Earl E. Devaney should provide
a more definitive answer.
Burton also has said that some holders of the 1998 and 1999 leases may
be reluctant to renegotiate because
they based their operating budgets on
the absence of royalties. Davis and Issa
disagreed. “The intent of all parties
was clear at the outset. Oil companies
testified that they bid on the leases as
if price thresholds were included, and
with the understanding that it was the
department’s policy to include them,”
they said in their letter. ✦

Each new compressor design leveraged proved technology of its time so

reducing the reservoir pressure to 70
bara from 380 bara, liberating an incremental 58 million cu m of oil equivalent production.
The LTFD project involved the installation of an integrated two-stage separation, gas compression, and dehydration

selection

Optimum compressor choice
boosts Brent gas production

The need for a
large gas compression capacity within limited weight and space
constraints drove the equipment selection. The LTFD project involved fitting
each platform with a single gas-export
compression train, which required an
aero-derivative gas-turbine driver to allow rapid turbine replacements during
maintenance.
The project selected Cooper-Rolls’
RB-211/6562 gas turbines as the prime
mover with GE Oil & Gas gas compressors.
A single-helical gearbox coupled the
two stage, back-to-back compressor to
the driver. The gas turbine and gearbox
shared the compressor lube oil system
while the compressor was fitted with
tandem dry gas seals.
Gas export availability was a key value driver for the project. This required
a proven, reliable, and readily maintain-

able high-flow compressor. GE designed
a compressor rotor with a 600-mm
diameter, two-dimensional impellers in
a three wheels and stage configuration
(Table 1 and Fig. 1).
The vertically split barrel-type casing
allows the replacement of the bundle
without removal of the process pipe
work.
Several factors made the LTFD compressor design difficult, considering the
experience and methods available in the
early 1990s. The compressor was specified in accordance with NACE,2 because
of the risk for the reservoir to sour in
later field life. The need to deliver high
flow and polytropic head in a single
casing resulted in the impeller tip velocity being relatively high.
As a consequence, the impeller had
high stresses and, therefore, the materials selected needed sufficient strength to
sustain the stresses but also to have low
enough hardness to satisfy the NACE
requirement. The presence of carbon
dioxide and water further complicated
material selection.
The design used rotor-dynamic
analysis that accounted for the destabilizing flow effects in the labyrinth seals.
This was important particularly in the
area of the center balance drum that
separates the discharge volutes of the
two compression stages.
All three units underwent full-load
testing in the factory using the contract drivers. The testing and in service
encountered no stability problems.
Rolls-Royce and GE staff maintained the
compression trains for optimal performance under a healthcare contract that
supported an enhanced maintenance
program.
None of the three compressors required a major unplanned intervention
in more than 20 years of cumulative
run life.

Development options
As the gas reservoirs depleted, well
productivity declined below the design
flow rate of the compressor. Optimizing production required lowering well
back-pressure. Lower back-pressure

enhances well performance and reduces
the ultimate reservoir pressure, which
in turn increases gas recovery.
Options evaluated to reduce backpressure while maintaining export
pipeline pressure included multiphase
pumps and various suction and discharge booster compressor configurations. All these concepts were unattractive economically due to space,
weight, power, and flow assurance. The
most cost-effective approach was the
modification of the existing gas export
compression train on each platform for
a lower suction pressure by upgrading the compressor, retaining the gas
turbine driver, and reusing the base skid
and auxiliaries.
The compressor upgrade reduced
suction pressure and reduced mass flow
in two phases to match the production decline of each platform. The work
staggered the shutdowns and aligned it
with other in-field activities to minimize avoidable production deferment.
Phase 1 included upgrading the
compressor as far as possible within the
existing casing design. The LPO project
replaced the compressor bundle and
gear internals. This well-proven upgrade
method only required a short platform
shutdown.
Phase 2 included the LPOP project
that replaced the existing compressor
with a new longer casing to accommodate additional impellers. This option
only became feasible in recent years because of advances in rotor and labyrinth

seal design techniques that enabled
detailed evaluation of the behavior of
such a compressor.
The upgrade required significant
brownfield work and an extended shutdown to remove the original machine
and install and align the new one. The
project also replaced piping spools,
valves, and gear internals.
It also included a review of the complete topsides process for flow, pressure,
and temperature changes resulting from
the new operating conditions.
Increased compressor discharge temperatures affected pipe class and valve
specifications as well as piping and
equipment stress levels. Although the
heat load on the gas coolers remained
essentially unchanged (given no change
to compressor driver power), these
required re-rating for the increased
temperatures.
Lower pressure affected fuel gas, gas
dehydration, and off-gas compression
systems, which were then either modified or operated differently.

Rewheeled compressor
Optimizing the impeller geometry and increasing rotational speed
increased the polytropic head of the
LPO compressor when compared with
the LTFD design (Table 1). The rotor
line-up was again composed of two-dimensional impellers in three plus three
configuration (Table 1).
The length constraint of the existing
casing prevented the accommodation
of additional impellers within the unit.
The selected impellers had the highest head geometry available within the
GE range of impeller families and an
increased 630-mm diameter, the largest
for the casing size.
The impeller tip speed together with
the NACE requirement resulted in the
LPO bundle being the limit state design
of the time.
In the absence of a gas-turbine skid,
compressor, or gearbox casing, it was
not possible to factory test the new
compressor or gearbox internals. The
project mitigated start-up risk through
design verification, use of proven imOil & Gas Journal / Oct. 9, 2006

LPOP compressor rotor
The design had to resolve rotordynamic stability concerns because of
the bearing span, rotational speed, and
polytropic head capacity of the LPOP
machine. A comparison of the compressor design against GE’s historical
database shows the importance of these
concerns (Fig. 2). All Brent machines
are within GE’s warning zone in the
Kirk-Donald plot,3 however, the LPOP
compressor is close to the stability limit.
A design optimization and verification was required to avoid an unstable
design. The analysis was conducted in
parallel with a third party, the South
West Research Institute.

Undamped critical speed
The starting point for the rotor-dynamic verification was an undamped
critical speed analysis (UCSA) per API
617 during the compressor feasibility
design study.4 The first equivalent shaft
was the result of a simple evolution of
the previous (LPO) machine. Modifications of the scheme followed as the
design proceeded to determine the final
optimized shaft.

contracts for XTO Energy Inc.(Fig. 1)
XTO will use them to drill the Barnett
shale in Tarrant and Johnson counties, Tex. The third and fourth rigs,
both 1,500 hp, will drill for Newfield
Exploration Co. under 2-year contracts.
Newfield will use the rigs near Coalgate, Coal County, Okla., to drill the
Woodford shale with a contained mud
system.

Mast erection
The mast and substructure were
designed by Ted Vora, at Houstonbased Veristic Technologies Inc (www.

___________ The raising system
is unique, differentiated from both the
typical self-elevating system and the

Dreco slingshot system, which raises
both mast and drawworks.
The Rocket Rig system uses hydraulic winches to raise the mast and the
entire drill floor assembly with equipment, all in one single shot. The drill
floor stays horizontal throughout the
procedure, following an arc-path from
near the V-door (mast-down position)
to the hole (mast-up).
The fully erect mast is hoisted hydraulically by two spooled cables (Fig.
2).

operations.

Industry concerns
Members of industry segments
voiced their concerns at panels during the workshops. These concerns can
be grouped into different technical
domains:
• Wireless security. Security is lacking in wireless connectivity and remote
access to enterprise systems. Wireless
security must be addressed as part of
the enterprise architecture. There is the
802.11 protocol in production fields,
but a more secure, capable solution is
needed across the infrastructure and in
remote areas.
• Intrusion detection. Basic intrusion detection is often lacking in an
architecture, which includes monitoring, event correlation, and alarms. This
security control is essential to detecting
and preventing attacks.
• Understanding and implementation of security. A comprehensive view
and implementation of security is
often missing; a piece-meal approach
to security is common. Currently, there
is sporadic or little implementation of
controls across the system. One layer,
such as a firewall or physical security,
is not enough to prevent an attack. A
layered, comprehensive approach is
necessary.
• Legacy systems. Many legacy systems that have interoperability issues or
hardware and software constraints are
still in use. These systems have minimal
security controls and are difficult to
patch or upgrade, resulting in vulnerabilities without clear mitigation strategies and a weakening of the overall
architecture. Addressing these legacy
systems and developing a solution for
protection is needed.
• Standards. No widely accepted
standard for security implementation
in control systems exists. Non-standard
security controls are therefore applied
over a variety of domains, including
business systems, PCS, and physical
(site) security. A comprehensive, layered

DISCUSSION PANEL CONCERNS

Shared, common concerns

Comprehensive security across

is needed, not just patches or
rudimentary security controls
on systems.

Management must be engaged early in decisions about
obtaining and implementing
security controls.

Securing wireless capabilities
as part of the network’s overall
security plan is necessary.

Interdependencies exist on
other critical infrastructures,
such as telecommunications.

Awareness and training
amongst operators and integrators on security controls is
needed.

A set of widely accepted
standards, guidelines, and best
practices would be very useful
to industry in planning and
implementing security across
architectures.

There is a need for overall
intrusion detection and prevention.

An industrial plant network
should be considered a multilayered enterprise rather than a
collection of individual nodes.

An understanding of how
interoperability affects security
within the enterprise by various levels within an organization is necessary.

Facilitating an understanding of
security needs and implementing a solution requires engaging stakeholders at all levels of
an organization, including asset
owners and managers.

Clearly deﬁned roles and
relationships between IT
personnel and control system
engineers are needed.

Security should be addressed
by including it in the overall
control system and network
lifecycle.

Industry stakeholders in any
position must be aware that
the oil and gas, and national critical infrastructure as a
whole, is considered a “target
of opportunity” to threats.

approach is needed with guidelines for
an enterprise approach to security.
• Training and awareness. Training and awareness of security configurations is necessary to prevent the
incorrect implementation of security
controls, such as firewalls.
• Design. Basic security, such as authentication, access control, and encryption, is not designed into many control
systems. The need for add-on security
can create implementation difficulties.
Upgrades and added functionality to
aging control systems can result in the
introduction of commercial technology that can add new vulnerabilities.
Considering security at the beginning
and throughout the control system
lifecycle is critical for continual, secure

operations.
• Network structure. Many PCS are
connected to business networks within
the enterprise. Without separation or
controls placed between the architectures, attackers have a potentially
exploitable access path to gain control
over operations. There is greater risk,
therefore, to core functions and operations.
• Policies and plans. In addition to
guidelines and standards in the approach to and implementation of security, enterprise level security policies
and plans are needed to ensure security is implemented at the necessary
levels of protection. The organizational
divide that exists in many organizations
between IT and PCS groups can thwart

• Incident handling. Part of robust
security includes data backups as well as
the preservation and analysis of forensic

this data is important to understand and
mitigate future attacks.
Interestingly, concerns from industry members often reflect the body of

panel members at the first I3P workshop were divided into operator and
vendor groups and it was interesting to

their effect on operations and the ability
to perform the critical functions necessary to continuously provide a product

process that creates damage to, or exploits, a system for a specific gain. The
result can have physical, economic, environmental, and human consequences.
Threats to control systems can come
from both insiders and outsiders and
can vary in capability. Capability is a
function of resources such as time,
money, computing power, technical
knowledge, and intelligence resources.
Threats and their capabilities are
often divided into several specific
categories such as nation-state, international terrorists, domestic terrorists,
or hackers. Although individual hackers
may have malicious intent and technical
knowledge, organized cyber-terrorist groups often possess the resources
necessary to carry out an effective,
distributed attack that produces severe
consequences.
Characteristics that can affect a
threat’s success in an attack include
funding, goal intensity, stealth capability, access, cyber skills, implementation
time, and cyber-organization size.
A targeted organization has no
capability of controlling these characteristics, with the exception of access.
An organization’s physical and cyber
defenses are therefore critical.
Access to information about control
systems, including design details, weak48

Table 2

nesses, and protective measures, are
often available on the Internet. Likewise,
industry and corporate-specific data
can easily be gathered from basic Web
investigative techniques.
In combination, this information can
be very useful to a threat planning a
coordinated attack and, because this information is readily available, increased
protections implemented on networks
become the primary line of defense.
This defense can ensure operations are
not disrupted or compromised.
Because these threats exist today and
organized cyber-terrorists continue to
gain resources and capabilities, industry must address this as a present and
future issue.
Fig. 2 illustrates an attack and lists
its potential effects, which include
downtime, exploited information for
financial gain, strained strategic partnerships, safety hazards, and damage to
infrastructure.
For example, once a threat accesses a control system, often through
a business system, it is possible for the
attacker to assume privileges as though
he or she were a trusted insider. This
control could potentially result in access of control systems that manage the
lifeblood of an organization.
In some instances, threats are not

targeted toward an organization or one
specific goal. For example, widespread
worms and viruses can create an overall
slowdown and damage, but are generally not used to produce a specific
effect on one organization. Likewise,
untrained employees or accidents by
employees can pose a threat to the
organization by inadvertently creating
security holes.
These indirect threats should be
considered when addressing security
in control system operations in addition to threats with targeted, malicious
intent.
Quantification of threat and understanding how that threat relates to their
own assets can help industry members
take the initial steps in building a secure operating environment.

Vulnerability analysis
A vulnerability is a weakness that exists in a system, network, application, or
process that can be exploited by a threat
to create an adverse effect. Examples of
vulnerabilities can include open ports,
unpatched software, dated virus protection, or exploitable system services.
Vulnerabilities can be identified
through a frequent assessment process
or review, and can be reduced using different mechanisms. These mechanisms
can include patches, access controls,
network protocols, monitoring, and
physical controls.
Vulnerabilities discussed at the I3P
workshops include descriptions of
broad categories as well as specific
examples. Table 2 outlines these categories.
Understanding vulnerabilities and
how they exist and evolve within an
architecture is necessary when selecting and applying security protective
measures. As a whole, the oil and gas
industry is becoming more aware of
vulnerabilities and how they arise, and
are now looking for ways to mitigate
them.
Vulnerabilities can be identified and
reduced, but continual maintenance is
required to safeguard elements of the
architecture and operations as a whole.

Process Control Technology

Vulnerability assessments are particularly useful in determining the current
state and robustness of an organization’s
architecture. Identified technical vulnerabilities, however, are often not meaningful to management when making
choices to invest in security.
Vulnerabilities must be viewed as
only one part of a whole when considering risk to control systems and the
organization. Different members of the
organization, and of the industry, may
have different priorities. Awareness and
communication is required to create a
comprehensive security plan that prioritizes assets and provides guidelines
for applying protective measures.

Consequences
A consequence is the resulting loss,
damage, or impact resulting from a
threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Consequences can include access
and alteration of data, disruption of
service, destruction of the system, and
severe environmental and public health
results of an attack.
Based on the threats and vulnerabilities discussed, consequences to control
systems could potentially be severe
due to physical and operational effects.
Some consequences can have serious
effects on business operations, to the
industry as a whole, and to the national
critical infrastructure.
Understanding consequences of a
successful attack can help an asset owner identify areas of the architecture that
need higher levels of protection and
prioritize the deployment of protection
mechanisms. The consequences of an
attack have direct effects on the organization or industry as a whole.
These effects include:
• Physical effects that encompass
direct consequences of control system
misoperations. The most devastating
potential effects include personal injury
or loss of life. Other effects include the
loss of property (including data) or
damage to the environment.
• Economic effects are secondary results of physical impacts ensuing from
an attack. Physical impacts could result

in repercussions to system operations,
which in turn inflict a greater economic
loss on a plant or company. On a larger
scale, these effects could negatively
affect the local, regional, national, or
possibly global economy.
• Social impacts or public image. A
side effect that is often overlooked is
the consequence of losing national or
public confidence in an organization
or industry. It is, however, a very real
objective and one that can be accomplished via a cyber attack.
• Impact on national critical infrastructure. Industry sectors are a part of
the whole national infrastructure. Loss
or adjustment of capacity and delayed
purchasing and transportation create
secondary effects on the national infrastructure. Likewise, attacks on other
industries in the national infrastructure
can affect the oil and gas sectors. An
example reiterated at the workshops is
the reliance on the telecommunications
industry.
Table 3 breaks down example consequences, effects, and overall impacts. If
a threat exists that can exploit an existing vulnerability, any number of these
consequences can occur.
Although Table 3 does not contain every potential consequence, it is
important to understand how a threat
with an opportunity can create negative
consequences. Understanding components such as the network, platforms,
system data, and operational policies
can help in creating a layered approach
to protecting the infrastructure.

insurance, although the financial benefit
to stopping attacks on a daily basis
is rarely quantifiable. An asset owner
must therefore consider the potential
cost of not employing these controls.
Downtime and the halted production or
transport of oil and gas can be directly
translated to profit losses.
To some extent, safety can also be
quantified in the number and cost of
accidents and injury. The social impacts,
however, such as quality of life and the
effect on critical infrastructure at a national level are not easily measured.
For example, an organization must
consider how customers and the market
will view it if it suffers a publicized
attack. Likewise, if a corporation’s
unsecured control system network is
used as an entry point or active node
in a coordinated attack on the national
infrastructure, it can have devastating
business consequences in addition to
the infrastructure damage.
This scenario is not unlike that of
airline companies who have suffered a
business loss or faced near bankruptcy
due to eroding public confidence
caused by a hijacking or safety-related
crash. The price of inaction can be far
costlier than implementation of security
to the architecture.

Protective measures

Defenses against cyber attacks are
most effective when applied in multiple layers of security through what is
sometimes referred to as a “defense-indepth strategy.” Often specific controls

A holistic, best-practices

the performance of control

In many plants, there is a
significant gap between the long-term
benefits promised and those actually
delivered in the long term by multivariable predictive control (MPC) assets.
The difficulty of diagnosing and resolving issues with MPC controllers results
in the eventual failure of many systems.

maintenance requires the plant owner
to monitor many interacting systems,
including the MPC itself, regulatory
controls, and instrumentation. It also
requires effective work processes and
documentation of the benefits of the
application being maintained.

MPC systems, causes of poor performance, and the best-practices approach.
The conclusion, next week, will

However, there are as many financial opportunities challenges as there are technical
challenges for independent operators. The savvy operator needs to know how to
assess the turbulent waters of international oil and gas exploration, what to look
out for, and where to go for the best advice.

when minimizing cost as opposed to
maximizing rates. New constraints
mean that new MVs are saturated and
new MVs are available to control the
process. Because it is likely that the controller was not commissioned with this
set of active constraints, it may perform
poorly. Mitigation may require controller recommissioning or even a redesign.
• Models. Because the plant is now
running at a different operating point,
process dynamics may be significantly
different. MPC controllers rely on
models to predict the effects of control
moves and disturbances. If the models
do not reflect the current dynamics, the
predictions will be poor resulting in
poor control.

Human resources

MPC controllers are typically commissioned and maintained by welltrained and skilled process control
engineers. At the beginning of an MPC
project, these resources are typically
employed either on a contract basis
from a control vendor’s organization, or
from within the organization itself.
An assumption often made by management is that when implementation is
complete, the project team will maintain the applications over the long term.
Often, however, the control engineers

insight, but also to gain acceptance for
the new technology and provide critical operator training on the use and
troubleshooting of the application.
With adequate training, insight, and
skill to identify performance degradation early, operations personnel are
invaluable at spotting trouble and
providing the process control engineer
with valuable diagnostic information.
Conversely, if the operators do not
understand the application, its purpose,
and limitations, or if it causes too much
extra work, it will likely be unused.
Despite advances in the ease of use
and tools to more effectively deploy and
support these applications, knowledgeable well-trained human resources still
remain a prerequisite in maintaining
the long-term performance of these
applications.

Maintenance work processes
Another cause of the decline in MPC
performance is the lack of effective
work processes and methods to support
these applications and underlying regulatory controllers. Work processes are
the methods and procedures by which
the organization addresses the technical
issues described previously.
Most companies we have encountered working with MPC applications
do not use rigorous work processes to
address both the technical and organizational factors that affect MPC performance. Maintenance on the MPC layer
is typically done by control engineering
personnel. A single engineer may have
several control applications that he is
responsible for as well as other responsibilities in the plant.
The most commonly used criteria
to determine if maintenance is applied
to an application is the “service factor” and operator feedback. Both are
good measures of MPC performance,
but should not be the only criteria by
which decisions are made to spend
money maintaining an application.
Diagnosing MPC problems is another
matter. It can take days or even weeks to
diagnose problems with large MPC applications. Without the proper tools and

done on an ad-hoc basis in the absence
of a control performance monitoring
system. At best, valves and sensors may
receive maintenance on a scheduled
basis; but in general, loops causing significant operational issues are addressed
in order of priority once they have
caused enough trouble to be noticed.
Maintenance planners and I/E staff do
their best to get to the high-priority
problems, leaving most others waiting
until they become a higher priority
themselves.
Currently, the work process to control maintenance at both the regulatory
and MPC layer in most organizations
is reactive. Problems occur and control
engineers or maintenance personnel respond applying corrective maintenance
where it’s believed necessary.
In most organizations, maintenance
is done based on priorities set by a
combination of operations, maintenance, or engineering personnel. In
the absence of objective data of which
applications are misbehaving and why,
decisions where to apply maintenance
is done subjectively rather than based
on any evidence of economic payback.
In most instances, the “squeaky wheel”
receives the most attention.

Best-practices approach
Corporations that are successful in
implementing and maintaining MPC
applications long term have adopted
a best-practices approach to the problem that involves implementing work
processes that target both the technical an organizational factors that limit
sustained performance of these applications.
In general, the work process will
include:
• Documentation and management
of change procedures.

• Control monitoring and reporting.
• Effective diagnostic and troubleshooting and maintenance tools.

Documentation,
management of change
Successful control applications
require rigorous ongoing support of
management. Critical to management
support, however, is understanding
what benefits the applications have
delivered to date, and what ongoing
benefits are currently generated.
Applications in which ongoing
benefits are clearly documented are
likely to receive the necessary maintenance funding required to keep them
performing optimally. Ongoing monitoring of the benefits accruing from
the application, either directly (via an
online benefits estimator) or indirectly,
by statistically measuring changes to the
CVs with the controller in and out of
service, is a necessary requirement for
ongoing management support.
Brown described perhaps the most
rigorous method of documenting MPC
benefits.6 Not every application must be
audited as rigorously, but it is important
to document the actual benefits that ac-

crue from an MPC project.
Rigorous technical documentation of
the application is also necessary. Documenting design and implementation
details, maintenance records, and ongoing operating details help ensure the
application is kept running smoothly.
Understanding the performance history
of an application as well as the previous
maintenance and upgrades help ensure
that experienced and new staff are able
to effectively maintain it.
A management of change process
ensures that upgrades are documented
and that they are not made without the
knowledge and approval of appropriate
individuals in the organization.

Control monitoring, reporting
In our experience, if the performance of these applications is not
regularly measured and made visible to
those who own the applications in the
plant, the application cannot be sustained for the long term.
Because MPC is at, or close to, the
top of the control hierarchy (Fig. 2), the
lower layers must function properly for
the MPC to deliver benefits. Monitoring and maintaining these assets is as

The direct examination step
evaluates all inspected ECDA

with the highest-risk ECDA

The outcome of each determines

which pipeline integrity is evaluated again.
The priority list generated by
the two aboveground surveys

Excavations generally take
place at locations:
• Where both surveys (coating and corrosion) have given an
indication; usually to determine
the size of corrosion defects and
repair any critical defects.
• Where only one of the
surveys has given an indication;
usually to check the survey characteristics and determine the size
of any found corrosion defects.

PIMSlider identifies ECDA regions by retrieving and graphically displaying data necessary for preassessment (Fig. 2).
gather information on: location of
coating and (active) corrosion defects,
dimensions of corrosion defects (defect
depth, defect length in axial direction),
and clock position of the corrosion
defects (not relevant to the current
model). Information should be used
from every excavation, including those
where no or only small defects were
found.
All ECDA regions must perform
model calculations. The direct-examination step makes the following groups
of calculations (updates) for each ECDA
region:
• Survey characteristics.
• Number of defects (coating and
corrosion) as a function of time.
• Defect depth, corrosion rate, and
time of initiation.
• Defect length and critical defect
depth.
• Probability of failure (of a defect
and per km of the ECDA region).
The updating process for the number
of coating defects is represented by a
normal distribution. The prior estimate
uses information collected during the
preassessment step (e.g., coating condition, age of the pipeline), but may also

be deduced from previous surveys on
other similar pipelines. New information from the indirect inspections
uses Bayesian statistics to immediately
update the prior distribution. The excavations allow an update of the survey
characteristics, after which the number
of coating defects can be updated again.
The probability of failure increases
with the growth of corrosion defects
and an increasing number of defects,
but generally decreases as a result of the
indirect inspections and direct examinations. The probability of failure, however, will increase again due to ongoing
corrosion processes.
ECDA assumes that all found corrosion defects are repaired (or recoated).
The repair of coating defects will not
have a significant effect on ECDA calcu-

lations, but assumes for consistency that
all coating defects found are repaired.
The updated probability of failure of
a defect at the time of excavation depends on the updated value of distribution of the defect depth, distribution of
the critical defect depth, and expected
number of corrosion defects. The updated probability of failure/km at the time
of excavations depends on the updated
distribution of failure of a defect and
the length of the ECDA region.
The probability of failure for a single
defect will change with each excavation
as the distribution of the corrosion rate
and time of initiation also change. A
confidence interval is calculated for the
probability of failure. As the number of
excavations increases, the probability of
failure/km normally decreases, until the
criterion for the probability of failure is
met, showing that sufficient excavations
for the specific ECDA region have been
carried out.
As mentioned earlier, excavation of
ECDA regions occurs sequentially, starting with the region with the highest
initial risk.
Results of the calculations for an
ECDA region can provide the starting
point for the next ECDA region. The
user can replace the initial values for
corrosion rate, time of initiation, and
defect density for that ECDA region
with the values calculated for the ECDA
region with the higher initial risk.
Inspectors repeat this process until all
ECDA regions have been covered.

Postassessment
According to the NACE, the objectives of the postassessment are to
define reassessment intervals and assess
the overall effectiveness of the ECDA
process. For the developed structural
reliability analysis (SRA) model, this
step consists of:
• Calculating the future probability
of failure/km due to external corrosion
for each ECDA region, based on indirect
inspections and direct examinations.
• Calculating the future probability
of failure/km for each ECDA region for
all other considered failure modes.

Case study
Table 1 contains the details of a pipeline subjected to ECDA in 2005. Assessing all relevant input parameters related
to pipeline geometry, material properties, defect dimensions, and incident
frequencies, including their respective
uncertainties, yields a first estimate of
the current integrity of the pipeline.
The first section of Table 2 shows
this estimate: a prior failure probability
per km of pipeline in the year 2005
(52 years after commissioning) of PF =
0.18/km; unacceptably high according
to ASME B31.8.
Fig. 2 gives an example of how

PIMSLider can be used to assist a pipeline operator in performing a preassessment, displaying the geographic
position of the pipeline under consideration, allowing the user to zoom in on
any segment of interest, and showing
corresponding pipeline, environmental, incident, or operational data. If the
required data are missing for a specific
pipeline, the DA module can retrieve
data from similar pipelines to estimate
the prior condition of the pipeline. The
DA module also identifies and calculates
the ECDA regions, following user definition of the relevant parameters and
criteria to be considered.

In the indirect inspection step, the
DA module allows the user to store and
analyze data from aboveground surveys,
assess the severity of defects, and identify areas where corrosion may occur
(Fig. 3).
The last section of Table 2 shows the
postassessment effect of the direct-current voltage gradient (DCVG) survey on
the expected number of coating defects.
The DCVG survey found 842 coating
defect indications. Bayesian updating of
the number of coating defects results
in an increase of the expected number
of coating defects from 713 (52/km)
to 957 (70/km), taking into account
DCVG’s initially estimated probability
of detection and probability of false
indication.
Applying Bayesian statistics also updates the number of corrosion defects.
The results of the cathodic protection survey showed that both the on
and off-potential of the pipeline meet
the applicable protection criterion
described in European standard EN
12954:2001. Calculation of the IR-free
potential, however, revealed 35 coating
defect indications without sufficient CP
protection and therefore possibly corroding, increasing the expected number
of corrosion defects from 6.2 to 58.9.
The direct examinations step performed 21 excavations, all at DCVG
indications. Each excavation found
actual coating defects, allowing the
probability of false indication of DCVG
to be decreased to 4% from an initial
value of 10%.
The absence of excavations at sites
without DCVG indications (e.g., blind
digs) prevented any update of the probability of detection.
The combination of these adjustments updated the expected number
of coating defects after excavations to
1,076 (e.g., 79/km).
Fig. 4 shows the effect of the DCVG
survey and the direct examinations on
the probability density function of the
number of coating defects.
The 21 excavations included eight
excavations at sites where CIPS data indicated insufficient protection by the CP

system. Actual corrosion anomalies were
found at four of these sites. This information updated the probability of false
indication of CIPS to 38% from 20%.
The other 13 excavations, where no
corrosion was suspected based on the
CIPS data, resulted in two additional
corrosion defects, leading to a decrease
in the probability of detection of CIPS
to 27% from its initially estimated
value of 60%. The updated performance
indicators (probability of detection
and probability of false indication) of
both indirect inspection tools led the
expected number of corrosion defects
to increase to 181 from a prior value
of six.
Accurate measurements of corrosion
defect depths and lengths during the
excavations allow an updating of their
respective distributions. Updating the
defect depth distribution allows calculation of the corresponding corrosion
growth rate (Fig. 5).

2000

Table 2 shows that the corrosion
growth rate decreases significantly to
0.015 mm/year, as compared to its
prior value of 0.054 mm/year, resulting
in a much lower probability of failure
as compared to the preassessment.
ECDA, in combination with SRA,
effectively demonstrated the integrity of
the pipeline. Even though the expected
number of corrosion defects is much
higher than estimated initially, the corrosion anomalies found were all minor
in nature, resulting in a significantly
lower average defect depth than initially
estimated.
Fig. 6 shows the overall effect of
the ECDA process on the probability of
failure. The adjusted probability density
function of the number of corrosion
defects, together with the updated defect depth distribution and the updated
critical defect depth distribution, result
in a decrease of the probability of failure to PF = 4.0 × 10–9/km. ✦

Where’s the money
worry in US bans
on OCS leasing?
The US Congress deserves credit for its
concern about those federal offshore oil
and gas leases that lack price thresholds for
deepwater royalty relief.
It’s gratifying to see elected ofﬁcials
quiver with indignation over mistakes of
governance. It’s reassuring to watch them
demand that public coffers not be denied a
penny of their possible due.
Even more welcome in these matters,

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

however, would be a measure of consistency.
For some reason, deepwater Outer
Continental Shelf leases issued during 1998
and 1999 omitted oil and gas price limits on
royalty relief. Production from those leases
is coming on stream at a time when prices
exceed price thresholds in leases granted
in other years. Congress estimates the
government will be denied $2 billion as a
result.
The Department of the Interior, which
manages OCS leasing through the Minerals Management Service, has drawn heavy,
bipartisan ﬁre for the lapse. It hardly eases
the pressure that the best explanation so
far has been a probable breakdown of communication.
It doesn’t help, either, that it’s an election year, when winning back some or all of
that theoretically lost money can be made
to look heroic. Indeed, lessees are negotiating possible compensation, although legalities and partner relationships make the task
tougher than politicians make it appear.
Leases are contracts. Companies signed
them in good faith and, by all reports, have
met their commitments.
Noteworthy in all this is sudden
congressional worry about money from
offshore oil and gas leasing. Commendable as it is, where’s that worry in leasing
exclusions covering the OCS off the East
and West Coasts and in the Gulf of Mexico
off Florida?
In ﬁscal 2005 alone, the MMS collected
$6.3 billion from federal offshore leases—
almost all from the 15% of the Lower 48
OCS that’s available for lease. The rest is
precluded from leasing by congressional
and presidential action.
Without a test of the resource, there’s no
way to tell how much revenue the government forswears with its antileasing policies.
But it’s probably more than $2 billion.
So where’s the indignation? As a mistake of governance, this one’s more appalling than Interior’s.

October gas contract ends near 4-year low
The expiring October natural gas contract dropped to a near 4-year low on the
New York Mercantile Exchange during the last week of September, while crude prices
continued to ﬂuctuate as traders speculated whether the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries might soon cut production.
The October natural gas contract expired at $4.20/MMbtu Sept. 27 after trading as
low as $4.07/MMbtu during that session in anticipation of a continued build in winter
storage. The November gas contract continued to fall, down by 27.7¢ to $5.39/MMbtu
Sept. 28 on NYMEX.
Gas storage
The US Energy Information Administration reported the injection of 77 bcf of gas
into US underground storage in the week ended Sept. 22, down from 93 bcf injected
the previous week (OGJ Online, Sept. 28, 2006). US gas storage then stood at nearly
3.3 tcf, up by 377 bcf from year-ago levels and 354 bcf above the 5-year average.
That reduced injection rate “reﬂects the start of some ‘line pack’ issues [gas
occupying pressurized sections of the pipeline network] along with perhaps some
constrained wellhead output concurrent with the pipeline pressure builds and, in our
opinion, is not the result of any sudden sharp uptick in demand due to the drop in
natural gas prices,” said Robert S. Morris, Banc of America Securities LLC, New York.
Analysts with Raymond James & Associates Inc. in Houston said, “We now anticipate...gas storage levels will be between 3.4-3.6 tcf at the end of October. Because
this is likely to test the limits of full storage (noncoincidental storage from each
region over the past 12 years has only totaled as high as approximately 3.467 tcf
including salt dome additions), gas should still be extremely volatile over the course
of the next 6 weeks.”
Analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc. (FBR) in Arlington, Va., said
they see similarities between the present gas market and 2001 “when gas fell from
$10.20 to $1.74 but rebounded in 2002, even as storage was at record levels.” They
said, “We maintain our bullish outlook on the E&P sector but recognize that the near
term looks volatile.” FBR analysts said, “Multiple near-term catalysts should positively inﬂuence the commodity. Gas storage is showing a 380 bcf overhang (7 days
demand), which should be whittled away by declining production, rebounding industrial demand, and normal winter weather....High initial decline rates across major
US basins provide further cover, despite robust rig counts and capital programs. We
have begun to see producers shutting in marginal wells as prices hover below cash
margins in high-cost basins.”
In a separate report in late September, EIA said US gas reserves grew by 6% in
2005, the largest annual increase in 35 years, with onshore gas reserves up for the
seventh consecutive year, offsetting a 10% decrease in gas reserves in US waters of
the Gulf of Mexico (OGJ Online, Sept. 28, 2006). However, Morris said a survey in
May of Banc of America Securities’ group of 55 independents and 12 major integrated companies, representing 58% of total US gas reserves, showed their proven
reserves (including revisions and “improved recovery”) increased 12% in 2005.
Total US gas production declined 4% in 2005 because Hurricanes Katrina and
Rita shut in 80% of gulf production, EIA said. Gulf gas production was in 10% annual
decline prior to those hurricanes. EIA reported US crude reserves also increased in
2005 for the ﬁrst time in 3 years.
Oil price ﬂuctuates
The November contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes temporarily
touched $64/bbl Sept. 28 on reports from Nigeria of possible OPEC action to shore
up prices. But it closed at $62.76/bbl, down 20¢ for the day on NYMEX after OPEC
dispelled those rumors. “We believe the commotion could be an attempt to ‘talk up
the markets’ in the heat of considerable plunges in crude prices, and if any OPEC
producer were to reduce supply, it would likely be countries that are currently
producing above their quota (Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf producers), as opposed to Nigeria, where output has declined by 800,000 b/d in the last few months,”
said Raymond James analysts.
Meanwhile, US gasoline demand trends remained positive, with gasoline imports
up “a surprisingly large 660,000 b/d (83%)” during the week ended Sept. 22, said
FBR analysts. “Given the large decline in US reﬁned product margins that has
occurred over the past month and the commencement of European maintenance
season, we expect imports to decrease materially over the coming weeks,” they said.

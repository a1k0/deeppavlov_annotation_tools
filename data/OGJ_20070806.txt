Luthi nominated to MMS director post
US Sec. of the Interior Dirk A. Kempthorne has nominated Randall Luthi, currently deputy director of the US Fish and Wildlife
Service, as director of the US Minerals Management Service. He
will succeed Johnnie Burton, who resigned after 5 years on May
31.
Luthi formerly served as speaker and majority leader in Wyoming’s House of Representatives, where he formulated state budgets that relied heavily on oil and gas royalties and severance taxes.
He also was a senior attorney for environmental regulations in the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an attorney at
DOI’s solicitor’s office, and a partner in the Thayne, Wyo., law firm
of Luthi & Voyles before his FWS appointment in February. Luthi
has served as a legislative member of the Energy Council, an organization of lawmakers from energy-producing states and provinces
and private energy-related industries.

Two entities charged in gas price manipulation
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has charged
hedge fund Amaranth Advisors and its former chief energy trader,
Brian Hunter, with attempting to manipulate natural gas prices.
The two allegedly attempted to manipulate prices of gas futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Feb. 24 and Apr.
26, 2006, CFTC said in charges filed in the US District Court for the
Southern District of New York.
The dates were the final trading days for the following months’
NYMEX gas futures contracts, CFTC said. The settlement price of
each NYMEX gas contract is determined by the volume weighted
average of executed trades during 2-2:30 p.m. on such “expiry
days.”
Amaranth and Hunter, Calgary, allegedly acquired more than
3,000 NYMEX gas futures contracts in advance of this closing
range on the expiry days, which they planned to, and for the most
part did, sell during the closing range, CFTC said.
CFTC also alleged that the defendants held large short positions
in financially settled gas swaps, primarily on the Intercontinental
Exchange (ICE), where swap settlement prices are determined by
the NYMEX gas futures settlement price. They allegedly intended
to lower prices on the NYMEX gas futures contracts to favor their

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

larger swap positions on ICE and elsewhere, CFTC said.
It also charged that Amaranth Advisors made false statements to
NYMEX to cover their activities.
In September 2006, Amaranth lost more than $6 billion, or
65% of its reported assets at the end of August, after prices for gas,
in which it had taken an unusually large position, plunged due to
high storage levels and the absence of hurricane-related and other
disruptions. The hedge fund transferred its energy portfolio to a
third party, reportedly at a deep discount, when it was unable to
meet margin calls and other payment demands.

Caswell nomination as BLM chief hits snag
Sen. Ken Salazar (D-Colo.) has placed a hold on James L. Caswell’s nomination to be Bureau of Land Management director after
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted to send
the nomination to the floor (OGJ Online, July 23, 2007).
In a meeting with US Interior Secretary Dirk A. Kempthorne,
Salazar said he would not let Caswell’s nomination move forward
until he received commitments from BLM and the Department of
Interior to cooperate with Colorado and communities on its Western Slope in development of public lands, to create sufficient opportunities for the state and its communities to comment on oil
shale development, and to delay any issuance by BLM of leases on
the Roan Plateau until Colorado has had time to consider options
on drilling.

EU, Morocco sign energy cooperation declaration
The EU Commission and Morocco—an important transit country for Algeria’s natural gas supplies to Europe—have signed a joint
declaration on priorities for cooperation in the energy sector. Spain
and Portugal receive natural gas from Algeria via a gas line that
crosses Morocco and the Mediterranean Sea.
The joint declaration, signed in Brussels on July 23, provides
“a clear political framework” with three priorities for cooperation—developing a sustainable energy policy, reinforcing Morocco’s energy policy pertaining to the progressive integration of its
energy market with the European Union, and enhancing security
of supply. ✦

Development

West Texas Marfa basin well logs oil
A private Dallas area independent plans to perforate and test
an exploratory well that encountered oil 35 miles south of Alpine,
Tex., in the nonproducing Marfa basin.
Giant Petroleum Inc., Las Colinas, Tex., set production casing
near permitted depth of 6,000 ft at its Giant-Lykes DPW-1C well

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

after logs and cuttings indicated the presence of oil in an undisclosed formation.
Giant’s wellsite is in Brewster County. It’s east of a Union Oil Co.
of California well drilled to about 8,500 ft in Presidio County in
the early 1980s that tested oil to surface and was deemed noncommercial (see map, OGJ, Jan. 20, 1992, p. 59). Giant owns interests

in 6,000 acres in the two counties and options on more, said Chris
Plunkett, president.
Plunkett declined to identify the “hybrid” formation but said it
is neither a shale nor a pure limestone or sandstone. It is regional in
extent and similar to formations that produce in frontal MarathonOuachita fields to the east in Pecos County, he said.
He held most downhole information confidential for now but
said the well was not drillstem-tested, and the oil has not been
analyzed. Giant ran a complete log suite, including dipmeter and
imaging logs, he said.
Plunkett reported difficult drilling in which the hole was lost
twice due to swelling shales and lost circulation before a larger rig
was brought in. Runoff from unseasonal rains in the desert area
washed out the location road repeatedly, he added.
The well, originally programmed to test deeper shale gas, is
near larger acreage positions held by Continental Resources Corp.,
Enid., Okla., and TXCO Resources Inc., San Antonio (see map, OGJ,
Apr. 10, 2006, p. 33).
Giant’s wellsite is southeast of a small field in Presidio County
14 miles southeast of Marfa that produced a small amount of oil
from about 3,800 ft in the late 1990s (see map, OGJ, Nov. 10,
1997, p. 87).

Gulfsands to speed work on Khubert East ﬁnd
Gulfsands Petroleum PLC said it intends to move rapidly to assess its Khurbert East discovery after it achieved a successful openhole drillstem test of the first appraisal well on Block 26 in northeastern Syria.
The strong flow rate achieved on test from the Khurbet East-2
(KHE-2) well plus the geologic and reservoir data gained from the
KHE-1 discovery and KHE-2 wells indicate that the Khurbet East
discovery should be economic in the context of low development
costs, proximity to production infrastructure, and a favorable production-sharing contract in the block, Gulfsands said.
The company also plans to shoot a 3D seismic survey over Khurbet East starting in September to identify future drilling locations
and facilitate a strategy for early development and production.
The KHE-2 appraisal well encountered the Massive formation
at 1,931 m. A drillstem test of the top 10 m of the fractured reservoir, flowed oil to surface at a maximum rate of 1,085 b/d during
nitrogen lift of the well.

PDVSA, Cupet to explore off Cuba
Petroleos de Venezuela SA said it will explore off Cuba with Cupet, the Cuban national oil company.
PDVSA said the project with Cupet involves six blocks covering
10,000 sq km, targeting light crude oil.
It said the companies will shoot 4,400 km of 2D seismic survey
in deep water and 530 km in shallow water.
The announcement follows reports that Cuba is producing
nearly 50% of the oil and gas it consumes (OGJ Online, July 26,
2007).

Thailand receives bids for 21 exploration blocks
Thailand’s Department of Mineral Fuels (DMF) received responses from 28 international firms seeking 21 blocks in the
country’s 20th petroleum concession licensing round. In the first
monthly submission round that closed on July 16, DMS offered 14
onshore blocks and 7 tracts in the Gulf of Thailand.
DMF Director General Krairit Nilkuha said the “overwhelming”
interest in the round from petroleum exploration companies was
primarily due to high oil prices.
Among bidders are Chevron Corp., Hess Corp., Total SA, BG
Group, Mitsui Oil Exploration, PTT Exploration & Production PLC,
Harrods Natural Resources, NuCoastal, Pearl Oil, and Adani Welspun Exploration Ltd.
DMF expects to name the preferred bidders over the next 2
months.
Companies will have until May 22, 2008, to submit bids for
another 56 onshore blocks, covering a combined area of 211,687
sq km in scattered regions of the country, and nine blocks totaling
23,919 sq km offshore (OGJ Online, May 31, 2007). ✦

Production

Production starts from Independence Hub
Atwater Valley Producers Group reported that production has
begun from the Independence Hub platform, which is moored
in 8,000 ft of water on Mississippi Canyon Block 920, 123 miles
southeast of Biloxi, Miss., in the Gulf of Mexico.
Gas production through the hub began July 19 from the Atlas-1
well in Atlas field on Lloyd Ridge Block 50. Atlas-1 is the first of 15
subsea wells in 10 anchor fields: Atlas, Atlas NW, Jubilee, Merganser, San Jacinto, Spiderman, Vortex, Mondo NW, Cheyenne, and Q.
Production from Atlas-1 is expected to ramp up to about 50
MMcfd soon. Most of the additional 14 wells, which on test demonstrated flow rates above 50 MMcfd, will be brought on stream
8

During the test period following the nitrogen lift, the average
flow rate was 710 b/d of oil increasing to a final rate of 820 b/d.
Preliminary test assessment indicates excellent formation permeability and artificial lift potential. All wells in the Massive formation on Block 26 go onto artificial lift relatively soon after initial
production, Gulfsands said.
The early assessment also suggests that 26° gravity oil is virtually identical to oil produced in Souedieh field, 12 km to the
northeast.

one at a time during the remainder of this year. Production is expected to rise toward the hub’s capacity of 1 bcfd of gas by yearend.
When operating at full capacity, the hub will process volumes
of gas representing an increase of more than 10% in supplies from
the gulf.
Independence Hub is thought to be the deepest production
platform and largest offshore gas processing facility in the world
(OGJ, Nov. 27, 2006, p. 43). It consists of a 105-ft, deep-draft,
semisubmersible platform with a two-level production deck.
The platform is operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and is
owned 80% by Enterprise Products Partners LP and 20% by Helix

Energy Solutions Group Inc. Anadarko has reserved about 61% of
the capacity on the hub, Eni SPA 20%, Norsk Hydro AS 12.5%, and
Devon Energy Corp. 6.5%.

Oil ﬂow starts from Polvo ﬁeld off Brazil
Devon Energy Corp. (operator with 60% interest) and SK Energy (40%) have started production from Polvo oil field off Brazil,
estimated to have 50 million bbl of reserves (OGJ, Feb. 19, 2007,
p. 34).
The field lies in 300 ft of water on Block BM-C-8 in the Campos
basin off Rio de Janeiro. Gross production is expected to peak by
yearend 2008 at 50,000 b/d of crude oil.
Production facilities include a fixed production and drilling
platform connected to a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO). First sales are expected to begin this October
when the first shipment of oil will be offloaded from the FPSO.

Systems repairs curtail Petrotrin oil output

TLP installed at Neptune ﬁeld
SBM Atlantia Inc. has installed the world’s ﬁfth SeaStar tension
leg platform (TLP) in BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Neptune ﬁeld on Green Canyon Block 613 in 4,200 ft of water in the Gulf of Mexico. The 5,900-ton
TLP hull will be equipped to produce up to 50,000 b/d of oil and 50
MMscfd of gas from an initial seven subsea wells. The TLP, fabricated
at the Signal International shipyard on the Texas coast, was installed
June 5 prior to Heerema Thialf heavy lift vessel setting the topsides
processing facility atop the hull in a single, 5,500-ton lift on June 22.
The topsides were constructed at the Gulf Island Fabrication shipyard in Houma, La. With the main installation portion of the project
complete, ﬁnal hookup and commissioning activities are now under
way ahead of production start-up, anticipated by yearend. BHP Billiton is operator of Neptune ﬁeld, and its partners include Marathon

subsidiary Maxus (US) Exploration 15%. Photo from SBM Atlantia.

Trinidad and Tobago’s state oil company Petroleum Co. of Trinidad and Tobago Ltd. (Petrotrin) has reduced its crude oil production by nearly 15,000 b/d due to safety concerns.
Average oil production has been cut to 47,000 b/d, down from
62,000 b/d. Petrotrin’s head of operations Wayne Bertrand said
the company shut down some offshore production following an
explosion in late May when a 12-in. pipeline on Trinmar Platform
21 ruptured in Soldado field, killing one and injuring two pipeline
workers.
Petrotrin said it has had little success rerouting production
through other facilities. Major problems with offshore facilities
have resulted in Petrotrin’s shutting down five platforms.

Placid Reﬁning to upgrade Port Allen reﬁnery
Placid Refining Co. LLC has begun a $200 million upgrade of its
55,000 b/cd refinery in Port Allen, La. The upgrade will increase
the facility’s gasoline production by 30% to about 1.3 million gal/
day while reducing total air emissions by about 50%.
The upgrade is being implemented in two phases.
Phase one, which started in June, involves construction of a
18,000 b/d gasoline desulfurization unit, a flue-gas scrubber for
the facility’s fluid catalytic cracker to reduce emissions of sulfur,
and other infrastructure improvements. This work is scheduled for
completion in second quarter 2008.
Phase two, which will begin in the third quarter, includes the
upgrade and expansion of the FCC to 24,500 b/d from 20,000
b/d, allowing expansion by similar capacity of the alkylation unit.
Placid also will expand the Rose deasphalting unit to 11,000 b/d
from 7,000 b/d to convert heavier oils into gasoline and diesel.
The majority of the construction for the second phase is scheduled
for third quarter 2008, during a 30-day turnaround.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
Placid currently supplies 35-40% of the gasoline consumed in
the Baton Rouge, La., area. The company said it is considering expansion of the refinery to 80,000 b/d later this decade.

Gujarat reﬁnery to get diesel hydrotreater
Indian Oil Corp. Ltd. has let a contract to Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. for a 44,000 b/d diesel hydrotreating unit at its

EPNG ﬁned $15.5 million; pipeline rehab ordered

Kinder Morgan line ruptures; cleanup under way

The Justice Department and the US Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has fined El Paso Natural Gas Co. (EPNG) $15.5
million and mandated comprehensive rehabilitation of its entire
10,000 mile pipeline system.
The action stems from an investigation of the August 2000 explosion on EPNG’s pipeline system in Carlsbad, NM, that killed 12
people (OGJ Online, Feb. 12, 2003).
EPNG will spend at least $86 million for widespread, comprehensive modifications of its natural gas pipeline system to resolve
alleged corrosion-control violations.
The complaint, filed concurrently with the settlement agreement, alleges that EPNG failed to employ personnel qualified in
corrosion-control methods, failed to investigate and mitigate internal corrosion in two of its gas pipelines, and failed to suitably
monitor those pipelines to determine the effectiveness of steps
taken to minimize internal corrosion.

Canada’s National Energy Board is leading the response of a
Kinder Morgan Canada oil pipeline spill that occurred July 24 in
Burnaby, BC.
Several other federal, regional, and local agencies also are responding to the spill, along with Kinder Morgan, which has enacted its emergency response plan.
Early assessments indicate the amount of oil spilled is 1,400
bbl, a company spokeswoman said.
The 24-in. pipeline, which connects the Burnaby tank farm
with the Westridge marine terminal, was ruptured by a third-party
construction crew.
The pipeline is part of Kinder Morgan’s existing Trans Mountain system that transports oil between Edmonton, Alta., and
Burnaby.

Magellan expands Texas pipeline, terminal
Magellan Midstream Partners LP plans to invest $65 million to
expand its products facilities in Texas.
The partnership intends to loop the existing 12-in. pipeline between its Galena Park origins and its East Houston terminal with
a 16-in. line, to build 250,000 bbl of storage at its East Houston
terminal, and to add a pump station north of Houston.
These projects will increase the partnership’s ability to handle
petroleum products originating from the Houston area for delivery throughout Texas, adding 200,000 b/d of incremental pipeline
capabilities to the East Houston terminal and 65,000 b/d of incremental pipeline capabilities to Dallas and other Texas areas. The
terminal is an origination point for the partnership’s 8,500-mile
products pipeline system.
The additions, expected to be operational in second-half 2008,
will provide flexibility for future pipeline capacity increases.
The partnership also is expanding the storage and loading
capabilities at its terminals in Dallas. This enhancement includes
construction of 80,000 bbl of storage and expansion of the existing truck rack at its Dallas terminal to accommodate increased
throughput of at least 10,000 b/d. In addition, the partnership
plans to increase pipeline capacity, construct 100,000 bbl of storage at its Aledo terminal, and build a new truck rack at its Frost
facility.
Based on current project plans, the terminal expansions should
provide phased-in incremental capacity and be fully operational in
second-quarter 2008.

Sonatrach seeks mediation over LNG plant
Sonatrach has filed for legal mediation with a Paris arbitration
court over its dispute with Spain’s Gas Natural and Repsol-YPF involving a delayed LNG plant, according to media reports.
The Spanish newspaper Cinco Dias said the dispute involves the
€1.6 billion Gassi Touil project and reluctance of the Spanish firms
to develop a 4 million tonne/year liquefaction plant by 2011 as
part of a deal signed in late 2004 to explore, extract, and market
LNG in western Algeria (OGJ, Aug. 9, 2004, Newsletter). The paper
noted increased construction costs.
On July 26, Spain and Algeria reached a compromise when Madrid lifted restrictions on the amount of gas Sonatrach can sell in
the country, while Sonatrach promised not to sell more than 2 billion cu m/year.
Previously, Madrid had ruled that Sonatrach could sell a maximum of 1 billion cu m/year directly in Spain, a ruling Sonatrach
contested.
The Algerian firm had just increased its participation in Medgaz,
the consortium laying an 8 bcm/year pipeline under the Mediterranean between Algeria and Spain.
Medgaz interests are Sonatrach, 36%; Cepsa and Ibedrola, 20%
each; and Endesa and Gaz de France, 12% each.
The Medgaz pipeline, including 210 km subsea, will link the
Hassi R’Mel-Beni Saf gas pipeline operated by Sonatrach in Algeria with the Almería-Albacete gas pipeline belonging to Enagas in
Spain. It is to begin operation in 2009. ✦

Free markets and biofuels
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Without exception, everyone interviewed for the special report beginning on p. 20, Agrifuels—Promise and
Progress, expressed a desire to avoid
unintended consequences.
They were talking about both
economic and environmental consequences.
Chares T. Drevna, executive vicepresident of the National Petrochemical
& Refiners Association, acknowledged
“universal agreement” that biofuels
represent a strong, growing component
of the US transportation fuel mix.
“However, NPRA opposes the mandated use of biofuels and supports the
sensible and workable integration of
biofuels into the marketplace based on
market principles and as the market
demands,” Drevna said. “Energy policy
based on mandates is no recipe for success.”
NPRA always has opposed mandates
that limit refiners’ flexibility to meet
demand, Drevna said.
He advises “caution and prudence”
as Congress considers proposals for unprecedented expansion of ethanol and
other biofuels. He said blending grain
ethanol into gasoline or soy biodiesel
into diesel is not always economic or
energy-efficient.
Ethanol creates potential ozone
emission problems, especially in warm
weather. Concerns about biodiesel
include nitrogen-oxide emissions and
low-temperature reliability.
Drevna said Congress should preempt state and local biofuels mandates,

Last of three parts

The ﬁnal four facts
A three-part editorial series concludes here with
the last of 12 points in a monograph by two former
US Federal Trade Commission officials entitled “A
Dozen Facts You Should Know about Antitrust and
the Oil Industry.” The authors are Timothy J. Muris,
FTC chairman during the administration of George
W. Bush, and Richard G. Parker, director of the FTC’s
Bureau of Competition under Bill Clinton. They
cochair the antitrust and competition practice in the
Washington, DC, office of the O’Melveny & Myers
LLP law firm, where Muris is of counsel and Parker
is a partner.
Here are monograph facts summarized in the
first part of this series: 1. Economic learning and
antitrust enforcement have evolved; we now know
that big is no longer necessarily bad; 2. The antitrust
authorities scrutinize the petroleum industry more
closely than any other; 3. The American petroleum
industry is not highly concentrated; and 4. Refiners
have expanded domestic and global capacity significantly (OGJ, July 16, 2007, p. 17).
The second part of the series presented these
facts: 5. Refineries operate at or near their practical
maximum utilization rates; 6. Inventory practices
have reduced costs and benefited consumers; 7. The
profitability of the petroleum industry is commensurate with other industries over the long run; and
8. The FTC applies tougher standards to mergers in
the oil industry than to mergers elsewhere (OGJ,
July 23, 2007, p. 19).
Summaries of the last four facts in the monograph follow.
• Fact 9: Empirical analyses of the price effects of oil mergers
provide no basis for applying more-stringent merger standards.
Oil industry critics rely on a 2004 report by the
Government Accountability Office to assert that a
few oil industry mergers have increased gasoline
prices. The GAO report can support no such claim.
GAO based its report on fundamentally flawed
analysis that was unreliable at best and invalid in
most instances.
Some legislative proposals favor abandoning the
antitrust agencies’ well-tested approach in favor of
novel and unique standards for oil mergers. The
bipartisan Antitrust Modernization Commission
has observed that there is a general consensus that
the agencies’ approach to merger review is sound.

Replacing the current system with industry-specific
rules threatens to politicize merger policy, encourage rent-seeking behavior, create judicial confusion,
and generate high administrative burdens.
• Fact 10: Market forces provide the most effective mechanism for quickly and efficiently alleviating price spikes.
A particularly compelling example of the effectiveness of market forces in responding even to
massive supply shocks involves Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These hurricanes severely impacted
product production and distribution in the Gulf
Coast and throughout the United States, substantially reducing US supply for an extended period.
Firms responded by quickly restoring production
and logistics capabilities and by locating alternative
supply sources, including increased imports. Prices
returned to prehurricane levels within 4 weeks after
Rita hit.
• Fact 11: Price-gouging legislation would harm, rather than
benefit, consumers.
Effective price-gouging legislation would create
the same effects as price controls. History reveals
that such measures provide false comfort for consumers. Price controls would lead to fuel run-outs
by raising costs of replacement supply, tend to hit
consumers in rural areas the hardest by discouraging shipments to remote areas, waste resources,
create market distortions, encourage inefficiencies
that cause regulated prices to exceed market prices,
and diminish refiners’ incentives over the long run
to invest in refining capacity.
• Fact 12:There are constructive alternatives that will benefit
consumers.
Instead of pursuing market-distorting initiatives that would harm consumers, the government
should remove constraints on industry members to
respond quickly to future supply disruptions. It also
should continue vigorous and objective antitrust
scrutiny at all levels of the oil industry; eliminate
state laws that needlessly increase gasoline prices,
including those addressing minimum pricing, divorcement of downstream operations, and full service; limit the number of boutique fuels; expedite
waiver processes during supply disruptions; and
streamline refinery permitting.
The 132-page monograph is available on the web
site of O’Melveny & Myers at www.omm.com. ✦

Agrifuels’ promise from an oil industry perspective hinges on unlocking
the answers to two root questions: How
can today’s photosynthesis supplement
the energy supplied by prehistoric photosynthesis? What are the logistics for
refiners and pipelines?
Support for agrifuels is high because of the hope for extending energy
supply and addressing climate change
concerns. Industry is looking for ways to balance the
chemistry and the economics.
Pamela Beall, Marathon
Petroleum Co. LLC vicepresident of business development, downstream, said
it’s ironic that fossil fuels and biofuels
rely on essentially the same feedstocks—only at different stages in their
life cycles. “Fossil fuels are really plants
and animals that decomposed over the
past 600 million years. What are we
talking about using with biofuels?”
Beall said. “We are trying to accelerate

“To the extent that you can harvest
renewable fuels, it could be easier,”
Beall said. “The cost of corn has not
escalated like the cost to produce oil.
The two are moving in opposite trends.
Corn yields are getting better and will

She notes renewable fuels will not

Marathon and oil companies in general
are hoping to find renewable fuels that
can be integrated into today’s refining
and fuel delivery system.
Rick Zalesky, Chevron Technology

and hydrogen, sees agrifuels as complementing fossil fuels, saying both are
needed to satisfy future demand.
“The idea is that you supplement
your hydrocarbon feed system with
a biofeed system and utilize existing
investments in refining assets to process
traditional petroleum feedstock along
with biofeedstock,” Zalesky said.
Ron Cascone, with energy and
chemical industry consultant Nexant
Inc. of New York, said the ideal goal is
to make gasoline from biomass.
“The Holy Grail is to produce exactly
the fuel we are using now but make
it from biomass—not from fuels that
releases fossil carbon,” Cascone said.
Zalesky said the search is for “a
molecule that we already know how
to deal with—a chemical identical to
gasoline, jet, and diesel blendstocks....
It’s probably a 10-year horizon to get
that approach developed and deployable

for ethanol and 2008 for biodiesel.
Chevron’s Zalesky said biofuels of
the future—subsidies or no subsidies—
must be produced at scale economically.
Ethanol also benefits from a 54¢/gal
tariff on imports, which ConocoPhillips
Chairman Jim Mulva opposes.
“This penalizes lower-cost and less
carbon-intensive imports, such as from
Brazil. This tariff should be phased out,”
Mulva said in a July 19 speech in Washington, DC.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a renewable fuels standard (RFS)
phasing up to 7.5 billion gal/year in
2012, a target that analysts expect production to surpass. President George W.
Bush has called for an enhanced RFS of
35 billion gal/year by 2017.
Charles T. Drevna, National Petrochemical & Refiners Association executive vice-president, warns against “an
overdose of heavily subsidized products,” saying the free market should set
fuel specifications.

“The goal of the biofuels industry,
including both corn-ethanol and cellulosic ethanol, should be economic
parity, or better, with that of refined
petroleum products,” Drevna said (see
article, p. 17).
Pearce Hammond, analyst with Simmons & Co. International, forecast that
US ethanol production will reach nearly
15 billion gal by 2015 and biodiesel
will reach 2 billion gal by that time.
By volume, ethanol then will represent
about 10% of gasoline supply.

Ethanol’s progress
Existing alcohol fuels made from agriculture products or wastes—the most
common one now being ethanol—are
produced through fermentation of sugars, distillation, and drying. Sugar cane
juice can be fermented directly into
ethanol. Corn is low in sugar but high
in carbohydrate cellulose that must be
turned into fermentable sugar.
Researchers are seeking methods to
more efficiently convert cellulose to
sugar.

Marathon has a 50:50 joint venture
with The Andersons Inc. to construct
and operate corn-based ethanol plants.
The joint venture’s first plant is under
construction in Greenville, Ohio. Its expected capacity is 110 million gal/year.
“Certainly one of the reasons that
we decided to invest in an ethanol plant
is to ensure reliability of supply,” Beall
said, noting Ohio has no ethanol plants
now so all ethanol must come into the
state by rail or by truck.
“We find it very important to have
ethanol. Once you put a customer into
blended ethanol gasoline, you really
don’t want to run out,” she said. “If
you don’t have that gallon of ethanol,
then that could hold up the sale of 9 gal
of hydrocarbon if you are blending at
10%.”
The Greenville ethanol plant is within 100 miles of Marathon terminals in
Columbus, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis
and is convenient to its Louisville, Ky.,
market, she said.

delivery to wholesale locations or retail
gasoline stations,” she said. “On their
way back, they can stop at the ethanol
plant and then resupply the terminal
with ethanol.”
Marathon is one of the nation’s leading blenders of ethanol in gasoline and
has been doing so for more than 15
years because of the company’s heavy
marketing presence in the Midwest,
Beall said.

Biobutanol potential
Many chemists see biobutanol as a
potential game changer for biofuels
because of its potential to integrate better than ethanol into the refining and
gasoline distribution infrastructure.
Unlike ethanol, “butanol has low
solubility in water and a low vapor
pressure. Its Reid vapor pressure contribution in a gasoline blend is minimal,”
said Cascone. The same feedstocks used
for ethanol could be used, including
sugar cane, beets, and corn.
Butanol is currently used as an
industrial solvent. Future feedstocks for
biobutanol fuel could involve cellulosic
material: grass, straw, sugar cane stalks
after juice extraction, and corn stalks
(stover). Production economics have yet
to be determined.
Cascone said, “With the right regulatory regime, you could blend butanol
at the refinery and distribute it as a
butanol blend.” Nexant is studying the
process and feasibility of converting
ethanol plants into butanol plants.
“There is a tradeoff and a continuum between ethanol, butanol, and
gasoline,” Cascone said. “While more
toxic, butanol has another advantage as
contrasted with ethanol in that it...has
an energy density approaching that of a
gasoline.”
Ethanol has about 70% of the energy
density of conventional gasoline.
Biobutanol was produced in commercial quantities around WWI in the
UK, Canada, and the US. The plants
eventually were closed because natural
gas-sourced butane became commercially available as a feedstock.
BP PLC and DuPont are working with

British Sugar, a subsidiary of Associated British Foods PLC, to convert an
ethanol fermentation facility to produce
biobutanol.
To begin market development of
biobutanol, BP and DuPont will import
small quantities of biobutanol from
a manufacturing plant in China. First
product is expected to arrive by yearend
and will be used to carry out infrastructure and advanced vehicle testing.
Initial laboratory engine tests using
conventional butanol indicated butanol
has fuel performance properties similar
to those of unleaded gasoline.
The joint venture plans to use sugar
beets as the feedstock at British Sugar’s
plant in Wissington, England, east of
Cambridge. Development work is under
way on a biotechnology process to produce biobutanol.
The BP-DuPont venture is looking

for a genetically modified microbe or
some “ultimate bug” for the catalyst to
boost conversion ratios in processing
feedstock into biobutanol, independent
chemists told OGJ.
A bioethanol plant will be built
alongside a demonstration plant to
advance the development work. Initial
production would be bioethanol. The
partners are looking at the feasibility
of converting the plant to biobutanol
pending technology developments.
The bioethanol plant would be
built at BP’s existing Saltend chemical
site in the UK. The bioethanol plant is
scheduled to be commissioned in late
2009. Plans call for it to have a 420
million l./year capacity from wheat
feedstock.

Biodiesel production
Biodiesel refers to additives and substitutes for diesel based on methyl esters
of vegetable oils or fats. An alcohol-ester
mixture, methyl soyate, is separated,
and excess alcohol is recycled. The ester
is purified through numerous techniques.
Made from soybeans in the US and
rapeseed in Europe, biodiesel is manufactured through transesterification
with an alcohol such as methanol and
a catalyst. Biodiesel can be blended in
various concentrations. Ideally, biodiesel
could be handled similarly to conventional diesel fuels, but it is being
distributed primarily via trucks now
because of integrity concerns about
pipeline shipments.
When asked about biodiesel, Beall
said Marathon blends only soy-based
biodiesel because it is not yet comfortable with other feedstocks.
“The concern is too much glycerin
and the potential to gum up engines
and filters,” Beall said. “It’s more of a
concern in the winter months, but we
don’t really want to take a chance at
handling any bad products. We are going slowly and carefully with biodiesel.”
Marathon recently completed biodiesel blending projects at its Robinson
and Champaign, Ill., terminals, which
will market soy-based B2 (2% biodieOil & Gas Journal / Aug. 6, 2007

Marathon has offered biodiesel at its
St. Paul Park, Minn., terminal since July
2005 and at its Louisville, Ky., terminal
since February 2007.
Biodiesel manufacturers are looking
to widen their distribution by integrating biodiesel plants with existing diesel
capacity.
Green Earth Fuels LLC of Houston
built a biodiesel plant in Kinder Morgan’s Galena Park, Tex., liquids terminal
on the Houston Ship Channel.
Jeffrey Trucksess, Green Earth executive vice-president of regulatory and
government affairs, said biodiesel plants
built near terminals help reduce product handling and lower transportation
costs.
Green Earth’s Galena Park plant
started up in July with a production line
designed to yield 43 million gal/year. A
second line of the same size is scheduled for operation in September.
In conjunction with Green Earth,
pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP is building Galena Park
terminal biodiesel tanks. KMP plans to
invest up to $100 million to expand
terminals for biodiesel in Houston,
New Orleans, New York Harbor, and
elsewhere.
James Holland, vice-president of logistics for KMP’s products pipeline, said
biodiesel is a business opportunity for
terminal operators who can bring in a
B100 that is soy-based and also a B100
that is palm-based. At the rack, they
blend a common diesel with whatever
biomaterial the customer wants. KMP is
contemplating pipeline opportunities.
“We are more than happy to do this
if we can get some definitive decisions
on what the specs are going to be and
what demand is going to be,” Holland said. “If you can get the specs and
demand to line up, it becomes a perfect
pipeline opportunity.”
KMP expects to run biodiesel tests
on its Plantation Pipe Line system from

Colonial Pipeline Co. last year tested
biodiesel in its pipeline system, concluding that biodiesel was feasible to
transport, but the test results raised concerns about potential contamination of
jet fuel so biodiesel pipeline shipments
are not occurring yet.
Consequently, Colonial is working with the renewable fuels industry
toward ensuring the quality of jet fuel
and permitting biodiesel shipments on
the same pipeline.
Colonial’s biodiesel tests contained
compounds not allowed in jet fuel, but
the company did not specify the compounds. Industry analysts told OGJ that
biodiesel is basically a form of lubricity
additive, incompatible with jet fuel.
Biodiesel would have to be carried
in Colonial’s mainline reserved for
distillate products and diesel fuel. Its
other mainline is reserved for gasoline
shipments.
KMP’s Holland said Kinder Morgan
moves jet fuel in a pipeline separate
from the pipeline used for diesel, and
he does not foresee the company experiencing those compatibility issues.
“With biodiesel, some parties will
want palm-based material and others
will want soy-based material—making fungibility a real problem,” Holland said. “A lot of biodiesel producers
say their product is special and cannot be commingled with others. So if
you were to commingle two types of

biodiesel, what do you get?”
Although both biodiesel products are
B5, pipeline operators might wind up
with cloudy diesel or other unknown
issues if the base material is different
in each biodiesel. He noted B100 has
specifications, but there are none yet for
B5 or B10.
“Physically yes, you can move it,”
Holland said. “But all the product
grades and specification issues have to
be worked out to make it happen.”
The National Biodiesel Board said
regulation of fuel standards is a function primarily left to the states. However, regulation of biodiesel and blends
is not uniform across all states.
NBB is working to catalog information regarding fuel regulation authority
by state.
Elsewhere, BP is investing $9.4
million in India to demonstrate the
feasibility of producing biodiesel from
jatrapha curcas, a succulent whose seed
produces an oil that can be used for
biodiesel. At its Bulwer Island 85,500
b/cd refinery in Australia, BP plans to
produce around 110 million l./year of
biodiesel from tallow feedstock.

Reﬁnery expansions
Although NPRA opposes the mandated use of biofuels, it supports
integration of biofuels based on market
demands, Drevna said.

Special Report

NPRA members are among the
largest users of ethanol, and refiners
will continue to rely on it as a gasoline
blendstock, especially pending major
US refining expansions. Drevna believes
mandates to increase ethanol use could
supplant refining expansions.
“Refiners must make investments
today on what they believe to be the
10-15 year outlook,” Drevna said.
Marathon has announced an estimated $3.2 billion expansion to its
245,000 b/cd refinery in Garyville,
La. The expansion will increase crude
capacity by 180,000 b/d.
Beall said the investment decision
confirms Marathon’s commitment to
support the US gasoline infrastructure
of the future despite uncertainty about
future gasoline standards.
“We think that there is room for
conventional hydrocarbons as well
as renewables in order to satisfy the
demands that the country will have,”
Beall said, noting that the US imports
a lot of feedstocks, blendstocks, and
products.
“Some of the production that we
make in the US will offset some of
those imports and will help to meet the
growth in demand. Corporate average
fuel economy (CAFE) standards are
increasing, and with alternative fuels
growing, we think there is still a need
to increase the refining capacity in the
US.” ✦

NPC report: All energy options should be pursued
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Every option, from developing
unconventional fossil fuel resources to
pursuing renewable and other alternatives, will need to be pursued if the
world expects to meet its growing
energy demand through 2030, the
National Petroleum Council concluded
in a recent study.
“We don’t have the option of saying
that anything is off the table. We simply
26

need to do everything we can,” NPC
Chairman and former ExxonMobil
Corp. Chief Executive Officer Lee R.
Raymond told reporters following the
council’s July 18 meeting, where the
study was approved and relayed to US
Sec. of Energy Samuel W. Bodman, who
had requested it.
Formally titled “Facing the Hard
Truths about Energy,” the report broke
new ground by involving more than
350 participants, 65% from outside the
oil and gas industry, in more than 2

years of discussions and examinations
that produced wide-ranging results.
It said that the hard truths the US and
world must face about energy in the
next 25 years are:
• Coal, oil, and natural gas will
remain indispensable to meeting total
projected demand growth.
• The world is not running out of
energy resources, “but there are accumulating risks to continued expansion
of oil and natural gas production from
the conventional sources relied upon

historically,” which pose significant
challenges.
• Expansion of all economic energy sources, including coal, nuclear,
biomass, other renewable resources,
and unconventional oil and gas, will be
required to mitigate these risks. “Each
of these sources faces significant challenges including safety, environmental,
political, or economic hurdles, and
imposes infrastructure requirements for
development and delivery,” the report
said.
• The concept of “energy independence” should be replaced by one of
energy security that can be enhanced
by moderating demand, expanding and
diversifying domestic supplies, and
strengthening global trade and investment.
• A majority of the US energy
workforce, including skilled scientists
and engineers, is eligible to retire in the
next decade. It will need to be replenished and trained.
• Policies aimed at curbing carbon
dioxide emissions will alter the energy
mix, increase energy-related costs, and
require reductions in demand growth.
The results impressed several NPC
members. “I personally think this is the
most important work the council has
done in the last 50 years and probably
the next 50 years as well. It’s not a slogan, but a strategy to be examined and
embraced by policymakers,” said Ray
L. Hunt, chief executive officer of Hunt
Oil Co. and chairman of the council’s
nominating committee. Hunt did not
directly participate.
“It’s the most comprehensive study
I’ve seen,” Daniel H. Yergin, chairman
of Cambridge Energy Research Group
and the council’s vice-chairman for
demand, told OGJ. He cited Section D
of the recommendations, which looked
at meeting challenges in forecasting,
science, and engineering, research and
data collection, and carbon constraints.
“When the supply task group finished
looking at more than 100 different
forecasts, the importance of assumptions in reaching conclusions was apparent,” Yergin said.

Yergin and another NPC member,
Deutsche Bank AG Chief Energy Economist Adam E. Sieminski, separately said
it was striking that the study moved beyond previous NPC efforts by including
energy efficiency for the first time.
Sieminski said efforts by the Alliance
to Save Energy were largely responsible.
“At first, there was polite listening.
Then, as the task group began to examine supply and demand conclusions that
were emerging from its own work, they
began to take energy efficiency more

how to formulate policies that included

Marathon to buy Western Oil Sands, gain Athabasca stake
Marathon Oil Corp., which is increasing capacities of its US refineries to
handle heavy feedstocks, has agreed to
buy Western Oil Sands Inc. for $6.5 billion (Can.) in a cash-and-stock deal that
gives it a strong position in the Athabasca oil sands of northern Alberta.

Western holds a 20% interest in the
Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP), a
joint venture operated by Shell Canada,
with a 60% interest, and including
Chevron Canada, 20%. The project includes the Muskeg River mine north of
Fort McMurray, Alta., and the Scotford

Marathon will gain interests in more
than 300,000 gross acres, of which an
area of over 200,000 acres is expected
to be developed by mining. The other
acreage holds potential for in situ development.
The total reserves net to Marathon in
acquired mining projects is estimated
at 436 million bbl of bitumen. The net
resource from the Muskeg River mine
and five planned expansions is estimated at 1.5 billion bbl of bitumen. A
further 500 million bbl of net resource
is ascribed to other mining expansion

Downstream integration
In a statement, Marathon stressed
the potential integration of oil sands
production with the upgrading of its
US refineries.
The company is conducting a frontend engineering and design study of
a project to increase crude capacity at
its 100,000-b/d Detroit refinery by
15,000 b/d and to add a 28,000-b/d
heavy oil coker and associated units.
In a conference call, Ken Matheny,
vice-president of investor relations
and public affairs, said the unfinished
study indicates that “we can process an
incremental 80,000 b/d of heavy sour
crude at Detroit for less than half of the
capital investment needed to build new
upgrading capacity in Alberta.”

Perhaps the most intriguing development involves Venezuela and Nicaragua, whose leaders—Hugo Chavez

But Chavez has also cast his sights
on other countries in the region,
largely to compete with or otherwise complicate US interests. Indeed,
Chavez, who seems to think Washington, DC, has a plan for his demise, is
involved in a proxy war with the US

others. As we know, at the end of
June he stuck a knife in by demanding majority ownership of $31 billion worth of Venezuelan oil projects

Resources, and other committees. The
bill drew criticism from industry and
energy-consumer groups.
HR 3221 was scheduled to emerge
from the Rules Committee on Aug. 2
in time for floor debate on Aug. 3. The
786-page bill includes most of the provisions in HR 2337 that many oil and
gas producers oppose, although some
compromises were achieved.
“It’s not the bill I would have written, but it’s a compromise,” Rep. Gene
Green (D-Tex.) told OGJ.
The Consumer Alliance for Energy
Security warned that parts of HR 3221,
notably Title VII’s supply sections, will
slow and reduce well completions, delay
new production, and raise energy prices.

Roan Plateau language
One controversial provision was
inserted at the behest of Rep. John
Salazar (D-Colo.), who opposes plans
by the US Bureau of Land Management
to issue natural gas leases on the Roan
Plateau near Grand Junction, Colo.
Section 7604 contains “no surface occupancy” language, that would prevent
drilling atop the plateau itself but lets
BLM receive bonus and royalty bids
and allows lessees to extract minerals,
he said. Rep. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) and
his staff helped develop the language,
Salazar said.
BLM’s plans to issue leases on the
plateau also led Salazar’s brother, Sen.
30

Ken Salazar (D-Colo.), to place a hold
on James L. Caswell’s nomination as
BLM director after the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee voted
to send the nomination to the floor
(OGJ Online, July 31, 2007). Earlier,
Rep. Salazar and Udall unsuccessfully
tried to insert language to prohibit the
leasing into BLM’s fiscal 2008 budget.
Udall said the current provision
protects the top of the plateau while
allowing development of the area’s gas
resources.
A leading producers’ association
official in the region disagreed. Marc
W. Smith, executive director of the
Independent Petroleum Association of
Mountain States in Denver, said Section
7604 would ban drilling on what many
believe is one of North America’s most
gas-rich areas, Naval Oil Shale Reserves
(NOSRs) 1 and 3. “This amendment
will cost the state of Colorado $1 billion in lost revenues and circumvents
a nearly decade-long public planning
process which allows extremely limited
drilling on NOSRs,” he said.
Other additional provisions include
establishment of an oil shale community impact assistance fund, new requirements to notify recreation and other
surface conservation easement holders
of proposed leasing, and a requirement
for contractors and subcontractors to
pay locally prevailing wages.

Still present
Most of the provisions in Titles I and
II of HR 2337 are present in Title VII
of HR 3221. The US interior secretary
would be required to establish onshore drilling permit processing fees
for producers to pay, and would collect

$1,700/permit temporarily for each
permit issued after Oct. 1 until a formal
structure is established. The bill also
would repeal a provision in the 2005
Energy Policy Act (EPACT) suspending
such fees.
Another EPACT provision, which set
a 30-day deadline for BLM to process
onshore drilling permit applications,
was modified further. Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall (DW.Va.) originally wanted to remove the
deadline entirely but accepted a compromise during HR 2337’s markup that
extended it to 90 days. That deadline
would be 45 days under HR 3221.
Section 7103 retained HR 2337’s
final language dealing with oil shale
and tar sands leasing, which effectively would remove EPACT’s deadlines,
extend the process to allow additional
public comment, and require development of a formal leasing strategy.
Section 7104 would amend EPACT’s
provision dealing with categorical
exclusions by requiring the interior
and agriculture secretaries, in managing lands under their jurisdiction, to
follow categorical exclusion regulations
established by the White House Council
on Environmental Quality. Two other
sections deal with best management
practices and consistency appeals.
HR 2337’s provision requiring the
US Minerals Management Service to
perform at least 550 audits of oil and
gas leases annually became Section
7201 in the new bill. Other sections
address royalty payment liability, tolling
agreements and subpoenas, interest payments, and obligation periods.
HR 3221 retained HR 2337’s provisions to expand surface land holders’

keptics may have wondered what
a “conservation fee” on some
holders of federal deepwater Gulf
of Mexico leases issued in 1998 and
1999 without price thresholds had
to do with a 5-year farm bill which
the US House passed on July 27
with much fanfare. The provision,
which the House Rules Committee
added to HR 2419 a day earlier, was
not simply slipped in as a last-minute amendment but was generally
expected as a way of funding the
farm bill’s energy programs, a House
Agricultural Committee spokeswoman told me. It incorporates elements
of HR 6, which the House passed
in January as part of the Democrats’
“first 100 hr” effort, she said.
A full portion of the farm bill,
Title IX, deals with energy. Its sections include loan guarantees for
biofuel plants, a feedstock flexibility
program for bioenergy producers,
and dedicated ethanol pipeline feasibility studies.
The Congressional Budget Office
estimates that putting what amounts
to a new tax on 1998-99 deepwater
leaseholders who have not voluntarily
renegotiated terms would raise about
$6.1 billion to pay for these agricultural energy programs over 10 years.

after Hugo Chavez’s government told
them to renegotiate terms or leave,
the Venezuelans essentially said they
had the right because “your own
government is doing it,” Pearce said.
“They were referring to language in
this bill, and in HR 6, that affects the
1998-99 offshore leases.”
Another Republican lawmaker
from New Mexico, Pete V. Domenici,
ranking minority member on the
Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said following the House’s
passage of the farm bill that includes
a provision aimed at recovering lost
deepwater royalties was inappropriate.
“While I agree that it is unfortunate that an error made by the
Clinton administration has cost the
federal treasury revenues, a punitive provision such as the one in the
House farm bill will not solve the
problem. In fact, it will make matters
worse by ensuring years of litigation,” he said. Imposing fees on domestic production would only raise
prices and possibly delay leasing and
development, Domenici added.

Similar signal

Republicans in general and Democrats from producing states can be
expected to push for the provision’s
removal when the farm bill reaches

public lands. It also kept the earlier bill’s
reclamation and additional bonding
requirements, its provision dealing with
produced water management, and a
$1/acre annual due diligence fee collected from lessees for land not being
developed.
Within its title dealing with ocean
resource management, HR 3221 attempts to establish price thresholds
omitted from deepwater leases MMS
issued in 1998 and 1999 by barring
leaseholders who do not voluntarily
renegotiate terms from participating in
future federal lease sales. A similar provision was inserted into a farm bill the
House passed on July 27. HR 3221 also
would repeal deepwater royalty relief
for Gulf of Mexico producers.

Ethanol pipelines
The new bill contains at least one
other provision affecting oil and gas. In
the title dealing with alternative fuel research and development, Section 8311
would require the energy secretary, in
coordination with the transportation
secretary, to study the feasibility of constructing pipelines dedicated to ethanol.
The study would consider barriers to
entry, market and throughput risks, and
ways to ensure safe transportation and
preserve pipeline integrity. Appropriations of $1 million for fiscal 2008 and
2009 would be authorized.
Oil and gas groups criticized specific
aspects of HR 3221. Provisions from the
Natural Resources Committee would
reverse reforms contained in EPACT that
only are now beginning to produce
results in the form of additional gas
supplies, the American Exploration &
Production Council said in an Aug. 1
memorandum to House members.
“In addition, several new restrictions on permitting are proposed that
have never been in law,” it said. “The
bill contains restrictions on leasing in
one of the most promising areas of the
West, and in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher
taxes in the legislation would further
reduce energy investment. Those who

in the United States—and invest more
than their earnings in the process—are
frankly baffled as to why policymakers
would consider such a reckless course
of action.”
In a joint letter to House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi on Aug. 1, the chief executives of three major natural gas trade
associations warned that HR 3221’s Title
VII would “repeal or eviscerate a number
of key measures that were enacted in
2005 to facilitate new natural gas supply
and infrastructure development.”
Independent Petroleum Association
of America Pres. Barry Russell, Natural
Gas Supply Association Pres. R. Skip
Horvath, and Interstate Natural Gas
Association of American Pres. Donald F.
Santa said the bill “would impose burdensome requirements, redundant surface owner provisions, and a complex
water plan that would be extremely
difficult to implement.”

More criticism
Energy-consuming industry associations also were critical. The American
Chemistry Council (ACC) said HR
3221’s natural resources provisions
would tie up or remove large amounts
of gas that otherwise would have been
developed.
“The new antisupply language in
Title VII is far worse than the already
deeply flawed language that passed out
of committee last month,” ACC Pres.
Jack Gerard said. “House leadership
took with the right hand what they
tried to give with the left, and the result
is that it’s worse than where it started.”
Other business groups criticized the
bill in general. “Congress is not developing energy independence or moving
toward more security,” said William L.
Kovacs, vice-president for environment,
technology, and regulatory affairs at
the US Chamber of Commerce. “It’s assuming we can live without oil and gas
while we develop alternatives.”
He expects the House to pass HR
3221 but said the bill will have difficulty when it goes to conference with the
Senate and might face a filibuster on the
Senate floor and a presidential veto. ✦

A large exploration block is taking
shape in the underexplored Fergana
basin in former Soviet Central Asia between the Caspian and Tarim basins.
The Tajikistan government in early
July awarded a license covering more
than 7,800 sq km to Somon Oil, owned
90% by DWM Petroleum AG. DWM is
wholly owned by Manas Petroleum
Corp., Baar, Switzerland.
The Tajik license is
adjacent to
the northern
boundary of
Manas’ six Tuzluk, Kyrgyzstan,
licenses that
total 3,152 sq km.
Manas said it is in farmout discussions with major oil companies of
interests in the Tajik and Kyrgyz licenses.
The Tajik license has a number of
prospects and leads determined by Soviet seismic acquisition in the 1970s-80s,
and a UK consultant said 10 known
structures on the Kyrgyz licenses may
contain a most likely 1.2 billion bbl of
recoverable light oil, Manas said.
Manas’s Tajik license is reportedly for
exploration in the Bobojon Ghafurov,
Jabbor Rasulov, and Ghonchi districts of
the Sughd region. In particular, Manas
reportedly will explore the Obcha-i
Qalacha and Navobod fields for oil and
gas.
In a statement, Manas noted that the
US Geological Survey estimates 3 billion
bbl of recoverable oil is contained in the
Fergana basin’s underthrust structures.

Emomali Rahmonov, last November
vowed: “We will also step up geological
prospecting, developing Tajikistan’s vast
coal reserves and gas and oil extraction.”
Tajikistan has reserves of coal estimated at 4 billion tonnes, but output
is just 70,000 tonnes/year. In May,
American firm AES Corp., Russia’s Unified Energy System (UES), Kazakhstan’s
KiTaKa, and a Chinese machinery company expressed interest in a project to
develop the Fan Yagnob deposit in the
Sughd region and to construct a coalfired electric power station there.
In April, interest in Tajikistan’s oil
and gas potential spiked when Tajik
Energy Minister Jurabek Nurmahmadov
said substantial reserves of oil and gas
discovered in Afghanistan might be part
of a trend leading into Tajikistan.
“For the time-being, this is just a
theory, but in practice this is excellent
news for us,” Nurmahdov said of the
Afghan discoveries.
Local media reported that exploration in Afghanistan’s Balkh, Samangan,
Konduz, Sheberghan, and Sar-e Pol
provinces revealed oil reserves of 1.6
billion bbl in the Afghan-Tajik basin,
along with 15.7 trillion cu m of gas
reserves in the Amu Darya River basin.
Nurmahdov said, “If all this information is corroborated, then we simply
need to prospect and extract gas in
the territory of our country...because
Afghan reserves are likely to have the
same unified source with Tajik reserves
in the south of the country.”

Tajik energy needs

Around the same time, OAO Gazprom Chief Executive Aleksey Miller
visited Tajikistan for the second time
in a year, saying that his firm hoped to
find similar reserves.
Barring such large discoveries, Miller
said with “certainty” that “on the basis
of information we possess, that the
prospected reserves can completely
meet all the country’s needs.”
Since then, Gazprom subsidiary
Zarubezhneftegaz said it will start 2D
seismic exploration work at the Rengan

Gazprom was issued a license to
explore the Sargazon and Rengan
prospects, with gas reserves estimated
at 30 billion cu m and 35 billion cu m,
respectively, on Dec. 13, 2006. Over
the next 5 years Gazprom said it plans
to carry out exploration at the Rengan,

Sargazon, Sarykamysh, and Western
Shaambary fields.
In March Gazprom’s Research Institute of Natural Gases and Gas Technologies (Vniigaz Ltd.) was said to be
preparing a feasibility study for geological exploration and a gradual program
for geological exploration work at the
oil and gas prospects. The work is to

include an evaluation of reserves and
possible production volumes.

years (OGJ Online, July 12, 2007).
Bennett, an international oil and

of experience in New Zealand, said the
Great South basin is a very challenging

that exploration of that basin is better

Albania
Manas Petroleum Ltd., Baar, Switzerland, said it is in advanced stages of
finalizing a production sharing agreement covering four exploration blocks
in Albania.
Previous block holders Shell and
Coparex International estimated that
the blocks hold a large, deep underthrust structure with potential to hold
more than 800 million boe of light oil
and natural gas. Numerous oil seeps
are observed where the reservoir rock
outcrops along a significant part of the
eastern side of Manas’s blocks.
Further refinement of the Shell/Coparex data set by Manas Petroleum has
outlined a series of large prospects on
the blocks.

Ethiopia
White Nile Ltd., London, reported
that exploratory data over southern
Ethiopia indicates the existence of deep
basins that may contain a sedimentary
section similar to that of the petroliferous Muglad and Melut basins of southern Sudan.
The company has completed ground
geophysical surveys, including magnetotellurics and gravity, in the Omo
River area north of Lake Turkana and is
using the data “to determine basin disposition and depth in this critical area
of interference between three proven
petroliferous basin trends known as the
Turkana Depression,” White Nile said.
After interpreting the data, it will
select areas it wishes to explore under a
production-sharing agreement.
White Nile plans to design a reconnaissance 2D seismic program to identify drill targets in southern Ethiopia.

Over the past several
decades, various methods have been proposed
to evaluate drilling
costs and complexity,
but because of the large
Drilling
number of factors and
events that affect drilling
performance, predictive models have
been difficult to construct.
The joint association survey (JAS)
and mechanical risk index (MRI) are
the most popular methods used to
evaluate drilling costs and complexity
in the US Gulf of Mexico, and specialized indices have been introduced to
characterize the complexity of drilling
directional and extended reach wells.
Quantifying well costs and complexity is complicated by restrictions on
data collection and availability, constraints associated with modeling, or
combinations of these factors. Drill rates
are often constrained by factors that the
driller does not control and in ways that
cannot be documented.
Recently, the concept of mechanical specific energy has been used to
improve bit efficiency and performance
and obtain a more objective assessment
of drilling efficiency.
The purpose of this three-part series
is to review the primary methods used
to assess drilling costs and complexity and to propose a new method that
combines the best features of each
approach.
Part 1 describes the JAS and MRI
methodologies. Part 2 introduces metrics that characterize directional and
extended reach wells, along with the
concept of mechanical specific energy,
which has seen recent success. Part 3
introduces a generalized approach to
drilling cost estimation.

Drilling factors
Drilling a hole in the ground in
search for or production of oil and gas
is subject to significant sources of variability. Although the physics of drilling
is the same everywhere throughout the
world, geologic conditions, contractor
experience, equipment availability, well

specification, and various other factors
can lead to a wide range in drilling
performance. Cost estimation is difficult
and benchmarking efforts are often
unreliable.
Performance comparisons are mostly
done on a well-by-well, actual-vs.-plan
basis or seek to correlate costs to performance indicators, metrics, or drilling
parameters. Evaluating the differences

Formation geology at the site and
location of the target reservoir are
primary factors that influence drilling
cost. Geologic formations vary across
the world and within the same producing basin. Hard, abrasive, and heterogeneous formations typically have low
penetration rates, frequent drillstring
failures, and significant deviation from
the planned trajectory.
Deep reservoirs are usually characterized by low permeability, high
temperature and pressure, complex
fracture growth and stress regimes, and

fied by drilling plan, location of the
target reservoir, and conditions encountered during drilling. Bit hydraulics has
a major influence on drilling efficiency;
its role is complex because it is closely
tied to other drilling variables, such as
lithology, bit type, downhole conditions, mechanical drilling parameters,
circulation system and drilling mud.
Site characteristics such as water
depth, operator’s experience in the
region, and expected environmental
conditions influence the operator’s selection of contract and rig type, which
in turn influence drilling performance
metrics. Exogenous events such as stuck
pipe, adverse weather, and mechanical
failure cannot be predicted and can have
a significant impact on the time and
cost to drill a well.

Benchmarks
Two methods are commonly used to
benchmark drilling performance.
The first method is based on experimental design and controlled field studies. Typically, one or more parameters
of the drilling process are varied and
the impact of the variable(s) on output
measures such as the rate of penetration
(ROP) or cost/ft examined.1
One of the most common approaches is the “drill rate” test, in which the
driller experiments with various weight
on bit (WOB) and rotations/min
(RPM) settings, and selects the parameters that result in the highest ROP.
Controlled field studies are often the
best way to understand the relationships
between drilling factors under a set of
conditions that are tightly controlled.
The analytic results derived under
field studies are often based on engineering and scientific principles specific
to the wellbore conditions, experimental design, equipment, and contractor,
and so the ability to generalize and
apply the results to other wells and
locations may be limited.
The second method to study factor
effects is based on an aggregate assessment of well data collected from
various contractors, locations, and well
bores.
40

O D U C T I O N

In this method, data that characterize
a set of wells are collected and relationships are established between the
variables based on empirical modeling
techniques.2 The aggregate approach to
analysis uses a set of drilling data and
seeks to discover relationships between
various factors of drilling and the cost
and complexity of the wellbore. It is
common to try to capture the best
practices by comparison to an ideal well
or offsets.
For instance, the approach used in
“technical limit” drilling describes a
level of performance defined as the
“best possible” for a given set of design
parameters.3 This allows engineers to
compare a variety of factors that impact
drilling and to develop models that describe the behavior of the performance
metrics.

Cost estimation
Since the drilling budget can represent a significant part of the capital expenditures for field development, drilling operations are carefully planned and
closely watched, and operators maintain
meticulous and detailed records of each
well drilled.4
Cost estimation is performed specific
to the drilling prognosis. The usual procedure is to decompose costs into eight
general categories:
1. Site preparation.
2. Mobilization and rigging up.
3. Drilling.
4. Tripping operations.
5. Formation evaluation and surveys.
6. Casing placement.
7. Well completion.
8. Drilling problems.
Spreadsheet models are employed
using various levels of detail. Typically,
several categories are specified, with the
drilling engineer itemizing the expected
time and cost/category.5-7
Each cost component is identified
and subdivided into minor cost elements, and the percentage contribution
of the total cost for each major category
is computed to help identify the key
cost drivers. To improve the range of
the estimate, the uncertainty of the cost

drivers is frequently quantified.8 9 A
contingency is added to accommodate
some of the uncertainty of costs before
the final authorization for expenditure
(AFE) is determined. The well budget is
then sent to management for approval.

JAS history
The joint association survey on drilling costs has been performed in the
US since 1954 in cooperation with the
American Petroleum Institute, Independent Petroleum Association of America,
and Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association. The first cost surveys were performed in 1944, but 1954 is generally
recognized as the official start of the
JAS. Since 1959, JAS data have been collected and published annually.
The purpose of the JAS is to provide
information pertaining to drilling costs
and expenditures for finding, developing, and producing oil and gas in the
US. The JAS is the only publication in
the US that contains annual state-bystate and offshore drilling cost data.
Questionnaires are mailed to operators to verify information on well
completions performed during the year
and to provide cost data for each well
drilled. The response rate of the survey
varies, but typically, 40-50% of operators respond to the request for information, representing 40-60% of the total
number of wells and footage drilled
during the year.
Because not all operators respond to
the survey, it is necessary to estimate
drilling costs for unreported wells. The
JAS accomplishes this task by constructing models to infer the expected costs
of drilling for unreported wells. The
model-estimated costs are added to the
reported costs to obtain the total estimated expenditures for the year.

Primary variables
The geographic—offshore or
onshore—location of each well is
specified and the well type (exploratory,
development) and well class (oil, gas,
dry) designated. An oil well is defined
as a well completed for the production
of crude oil from at least one oil zone

the distance measured in plan view
from the rotary table to TD. The water
depth is the distance from the waterline
to mud line.
The problems, costs, and hazards of
drilling depend upon both observable
and unobservable factors. The deeper
the hole, the more time is lost in round
trips to replace worn bits and to run
casing, tests, logs, etc. As the depth of
the well increases, the number of formations encountered typically increases
along with the number of casing strings
required to maintain well control.
As the number of casing strings
increases, the trip time, installation, and
cementing time will increase, all increasing drilling time and cost. Beyond
a certain depth, technical complications and the opportunity for problems
increase drastically.
Casing serves several important functions in drilling and completion and
is one of the most expensive parts of a
drilling program, making up 10-20%
of the average cost of a completed well.6
A well that encounters no abnormal
formation pore pressure gradients, lostcirculation zones, or salt sections usually requires only conductor and surface
casing to drill to the target.
Deeper wells that penetrate abnormally pressured formations, lost-circulation zones, unstable (sloughing) shale
sections, shallow water flows, or salt
sections generally will require one or
more strings of intermediate casing to
protect formations and to prevent well
problems.
The number of casing strings in a
well provides an indirect measure of
well complexity because complex wells
are frequently associated with multiple
strings, and narrow margins between
formation pore pressure and fracture
pressure gradients often require a
greater number of casing strings.18
Wells are usually drilled with water
or oil-based muds through the entire
wellbore or one mud may be displaced
for another over a selected interval. The
mud weight at total depth serves as a
proxy for the wellbore formation pressure. With all other factors equal, the

greater the hole pressure, the heavier
the mud, and the slower the drilling.
Underbalanced drilling requires the
use of special equipment to handle formation fluids entering the well; its primary use has been where casing is set

Just about the time the unit was built

shot up and margins for this product
were $5/bbl vs. the next best option
for the feedstock. Fortunately, there was
an extra 5% of this feedstock available
and increasing feed was not limited by
pumps or furnace duty. The question is:
Should the refinery process this extra
material?
Obviously, increasing the flow to the
new unit will increase the LHSV and
reduce the overall run length. The extra
revenue, however, offsets the loss in
catalyst activity before the end of run.
Certainly there are more costs that
must be considered, including increased turnaround expenses. It is also
not always possible to increase the unit
charge without changing the feed composition of the incremental barrel. If the
extra barrel is from increasing the FCC
light cycle oil end point, the deactivation will be greater.
Conversely, moving barrels from FCC
slurry (one of the lowest valued products in the refinery) to ULSD (at times
the highest valued product) will have a
big incentive.
Each refiner must determine the
economics that fit their units and will
also have to make accommodations for

blending should not be oversimplified.
Nothing can fix a ULSD shipment that
is just a little bit high on sulfur spec
unless the unit is run harder. There is
certainly no room for error due to a
bad line fill, leaking valve, or line up
mistake. Allowing a couple of ppm here
for dirty bottles and a couple ppm there
for laboratory precision, however, will
wind up costing the refinery a great
deal in the long run.
One of the best solutions is to have
an on-stream product sulfur analyzer
(Fig. 1). Even this is far from perfect;
but with time, operators will be able to
develop a level of confidence that will
allow them to make the proper corrections for inevitable process swings.
Installation and care of these onstream analyzers cost money, but considering the risks for not staying on top
of the ULSD product, the extra investment is probably worth it.
Refiners should compare daily operating sulfur levels with finished tank
results to determine if they are leaving
any money on the table. ✦

required to achieve this goal.
The economy of scale incentives
highlighted the GE Frame 9E as the
ideal mechanical driver for the refrigeration strings (Fig. 1). An extensive
qualification effort was required to
adapt the GE Frame 9E power-generation gas turbine for variable-speed
mechanical drive service. System reliability was improved through a design
program that targeted reduction of the
number of components.
In addition, considerable effort
concentrated on reducing plant emissions through qualification and use of
dry low NOx (DLN) burner technology
suitable for the low-btu, LNG mechanical drive application.
Further improvements to efficiency
required a solution to the impact of
diurnal and seasonal ambient temperature variations on the gas turbine’s
power output. Development of a unique,

The GEMS9001E (Frame 9E) gas turbine has an extensive operating history
since 1978 in power generation. ExxonMobil initially qualified the Frame 9E
for mechanical drive LNG service based
on 100% constant speed and fuel gas
with 38% nitrogen content.
GE then performed a study to customize the Frame 9E for variable-speed
operation without compromising maintenance intervals or life expectancies.

The speed study assumptions were:
• Operating ambient temperature:
4° C. to 49° C.
• Five to 30 starts/year (mature
design at 5/year).
With these assumptions, assessment
of the following components verified
life expectancy over a speed range of
2,850 rpm (95% speed) to 3,150 rpm
(105% speed):
• Axial compressor rotating and
stationary blades.
• Turbine rotor and buckets.

system is capable of 25 ppm (vol, dry;
ppmvd) of NOx and requires a variation of no more than ±5% from a given
Wobbe Index (WI) target value for the
fuel gas.
(WI is the ratio between the fuel’s
lower heating value (LHV) and the
square root of specific gravity multiplied by fuel temperature. This can be
thought of as a measure of the energy
density of the fuel.)
QGII fuel gas is supplied by the
LNG process and supplemented during
various modes of operation. The fuel
gas may have a WI variation as high as
±26%. The WI range and rate of change
is limited to ensure adequate pressure
ratios across the fuel nozzles. If the
pressure ratio is too low, the combustion dynamics amplitudes can increase
to unacceptable levels leading to shortened operating life and poor reliability.
Combustion testing was performed
to verify the combustion hardware was
capable of handling fuel gases ranging 4% to 48% N2. Additional lab tests
verified that the selected fuel nozzles
and combustion chamber design stayed
within acceptable performance limits.
NOx emissions decrease as the
N2/CH4 ratio in the fuel gas increases.

While this effect is beneficial for
reducing emissions, it can reduce the
reliability of the combustion system.
Extremely low NOx emission values for
this combustion system can indicate a
weak flame, which in turn could lead to
a combustion blowout or high combustion dynamics.
To compensate for the high N2 fuel
content, the dilution area of the liners
was increased to achieve a robust flame
over all operating conditions.
This liner modification, coupled
with the redesigned fuel nozzles, produced test results that showed the combustion system can operate throughout
the required QGII range. The NOx is
expected to be less than 25 ppmvd
while running on fuel gases with 25%
to 42% nitrogen.
Complementary to the combustion
design changes was the addition of GE’s
Extendor technology maximizing availability.

Motor-generator; VFD system
The design basis of the motor-generator, variable-frequency drive system
manufactured by Siemens was to support flat LNG production by providing
sufficient string torque under all ambient conditions (Fig. 4). The design and
operability of the string were validated
during back-to-back and string testing.
The synchronous motor-generator
manufactured by Ansaldo Sistemi Industriali SPA incorporates integral shaft
flanges that mechanically connect the
Frame 9E and the centrifugal compressors. This design is based on a theoretical limit that allows the turbine to
transfer full power to the compressors
at the same time the motor-generator
also supplies full power (45 Mw, 143
kN/m base, 60 Mw, 190 kN/m peak)
to the compressors.
The VFDs are designed not only to
support a base full motor power (45
Mw, 143 KNm) in either generation or
helper motor modes. They are also designed to provide peak power up to 190
KNm of motor starting torque (corresponding to 60-Mw@3,000 rpm) for
90 sec. This enables pressurized starting

to validate system design and compare

Compression power generation
Each VFD is provided with an active
front end (AFE) capable of supplying
real power or reactive power to the
plant grid, whenever excess turbine
power is available. Reactive power is
also controlled by the AFE by adjustments to the voltage to control the export of reactive power to the plant grid.
Since VFDs isolate the motor-generator from the plant grid by converting
plant power from 50-cycle AC to DC
and then to a variable AC, power flows
between the plant grid and the motorgenerator are independent of motorgenerator shaft speed.
Each compression string is

electrical grid continuously at

High availability flat LNG production
required a 60-Mw system design. Since
the VFD technology selected was limited to 15 Mw/drive (“threads”), four
drives were required for each compression string.
The 15-Mw limit, however, provided
an opportunity for system redundancy.
Each motor is normally fed from four
VFDs with each VFD feeding a separate
motor-generator stator winding. The
design using four parallel
drives, not only supports
the 60-Mw requirement for
pressurized starts, but can
also operate continuously at
45-Mw in motor-generator

availability by greatly reducing starting
times, while at the same time reducing
plant flaring and associated emissions. The
incentives of pressurized starting capabilities led to a major development effort.
An initial feasibility study formed the
basis for starter motor sizing. Since the
required start-up torque is a function of
compressor load-loop pressure and rotating inertia, it was critical fully to understand fully the complete compression
system as well as the Frame 9E and motor.
A rigorous dynamic simulation took
into account the Frame 9E transients,
using a GE proprietary model based on
Frame 9E actual control software and
cycle deck performances. The simulation included the electric motor-supplied torque, compressor load, and
train inertias. Pressurized starting was
considered feasible with a 45-Mw motor with 60-Mw peak load capability.
Dynamic simulations performed by
GE using site conditions showed the
need for extra-torque from the Frame 9E
for speeds greater than 82% for N2 and
C3 and above 70% speed for the mixedrefrigerant train.
Additional starting torque was
obtained by modifying the standard turbine generator drive’s start-up sequence,
increasing fuel flow rate, and anticipating the turbine-inlet guide vane opening.
This resulted in a dedicated augmented
start-capability test campaign designed
to explore higher Frame 9E axial pressure ratios.
A nonstandard development engine
approach explored the new operating
line limit. In order to take into account
engine deterioration with accumulated
operating hours and engine-to-engine
variation, a 10% margin in terms of
pressure ratio was necessary to validate the final operating line limit. This
margin forced a higher level of pressure
ratios during the test campaign.
In summary, achieving initial project objective of pressurized starting
at nearly all site conditions not only
simplifies starting and greatly improving plant availability, but also minimizes
plant emissions.

Centrifugal compressors
From early stages, GE and ExxonMobil shared centrifugal compressor design development. ExxonMobil
performed technical reviews covering
many aspects of the compressor design.
QGII compressors are the largest
centrifugal compressors designed by GE
for LNG applications (Fig. 6). Although
the compressor architecture is not completely new, GE introduced several innovations to mitigate risks associated with
manufacturability and performance of
these compressors.
The process compressors are in two
bodies on each string. The inboard com-

then removed to reveal the rotor.
These barrel compressors are the
largest ever built by GE, with a maximum weight of 115 tons.

Single-piece impellers

The QGII compressors are equipped
with three-dimensional impellers
machined from a solid forging. Each
impeller is machined with a five-axis
milling machine, eliminating the need
for welding.
This manufacturing process provided
excellent control of the blade geometry
without reducing tensile properties associated with weld joints. This technology
also increased steel alloy options without
the constraints of material weldability.
A computerized measuring device
then checked each impeller to assess the
possible impact of geometrical deviations. The single-piece impeller method
guarantees repeatability and improves
performance (Fig. 7).
QGII compressors were designed
to optimize both rotordynamics and
aerodynamic performance. In particular,
propane compressors are often limited by an impeller-eye Mach number
resulting in premature choking of the

on each of the three compressor strings
at GE’s Massa facility (Fig. 8). These tests
were to replicate as much as possible
the plant site configuration.
The tests used the contract Frame 9E
gas turbine, compressors, motor-generator, and associated VFDs. Also included
were such subcomponents as inlet-air
filtration system, inlet-bleed heating, oil
system, and the dry-gas sealing system.
The only difference with the site configuration was the use of a temporary
on-base Frame 9E enclosure instead of
the contract off-base enclosure.
A large portion of the string testing involved final validation of the VFD
system and its integration with the main
equipment as well as with the power
supply grid. Engineering Dynamics Inc.
used an advanced recording system
closely to monitor shaft torque ripple
(a well-known weak point of variablefrequency systems) and the amount of
harmonic disturbances injected by the
system into the surrounding electrical
grid. Results validated low torque ripple,
well within the design basis, therefore
requiring no external suppression.

Testing achievements
Flow measurement at each bearing
inlet as well as bearing temperatures
throughout various operating conditions fully validated the oil system.
Massa testing simulated loss of
complete AC power under full load.
The emergency oil pump and overhead
rundown tank provided adequate oil to
protect the string during coast and cool
down. The system also demonstrated
the capability to maintain minimum
lube-oil pressure with only one of the
3x100% AC pumps running.
Functional testing of the dry-gas-seal
system validated the requirement to support the seals during all operating conditions. This included the ability to supply
buffer gas during compressor settle out
conditions through use of an on-board
booster compressor, eliminating the need
for external buffer gas that can often
contaminate the compressor refrigeration
loops, which can lead to additional delays
in train restart and flaring.

Before shipment, each of the three compressor strings underwent a full power string test at Massa.These
tests sought to replicate plant site configuration (Fig. 8; photograph from GE Oil & Gas, Florence).
The load test was the final validation of the train alignment procedure
(especially for the rigid shaft line Frame
9E + motor-generator supported by five
bearings). In addition to the contract
string bearing’s vibration-monitoring
system, an extensive temporary vibration-monitoring system was installed
on the piping, casings, bearing pedestals, and support structure. This provided a complete picture of the string rotor
dynamics. All measurements were well
within specified limits, validating lateral
analysis studies.
The Frame 9E is equipped with
DLN-1 NOx combustion system and
IBH to improve system operability. The
DLN-1 system allows very low NOx
emissions, provided that all combustion control parameters are properly
adjusted to take into account site conditions and unit-to-unit variations.
DLN-1 system tuning is normally
performed at the site as one of the
commissioning activities. In this case, a
pretuning was performed in Massa to
demonstrate the system’s capability in
terms of operability and emissions. This
has the additional benefit of reducing the
site-commissioning schedule. Measured
NOx emissions were well within the 25-

ppmvd target over a wide load range.
The commissioning sequence of the
main equipment started with the motor
solo run in which the electric motor is
disconnected from the Frame 9E and
from the compressors. For this operation, a temporary thrust bearing was
added to the motor shaft.
The motor was then connected to
the Frame 9E to perform the turbine
solo runs. Finally the string was coupled and full load testing was initiated,
validating the ability of the VFD motor
to perform all string starting and cool
down functions.
This validated the early decision to
utilize the VFD motor in lieu of the standard Frame 9E accessory gearbox, thus
improving string reliability by reducing
the number of system components.
The Frame 9E’s response at low power, combined with peaking mode, will
be used in the field to avoid tripping of
the MR string during loss of VFD when
in helper mode.
Additional tests validated VFD double
level of redundancy, in particular the capability to supply uninterrupted power
(45 Mw) with one cell failed in one
thread and a second one in a second
drive, as well as with a complete thread

New process designed to solubilize NORM waste
Researchers at the University of Mississippi, in collaboration with an independent researcher now with the Mississippi
Office of Geology, have a patent pending
on a process for solubilizing naturally
occurring radioactive materials (NORM)
scale and sludge wastes from oil and gas
production.
This process, which requires no
expensive chemicals, can be mobilized
with all of the necessary equipment skid
mounted for land and-or offshore based
applications. The processed NORM can be
dissolved in produced waters to generate
stable solutions that can then be disposed
of via existing saltwater disposal or other
injection wells.
Features include 1) solid NORM wastes
can be processed and disposed of at sites
near their production, eliminating the
need to transport them over long distances; 2) injection returns the material into
geologic reservoirs, thus the potential for
creating on site (including the production

facility) environmental and other liabilities
is eliminated; and 3) relative to other disposal options this process is significantly
less expensive, the specialists say.

New pipeline repair manual
A new, updated pipeline repair manual
from Pipeline Research Council International (PRCI) provides an overview of
currently used pipeline repair technologies
with a standard template and detailed information for pipeline operators to extend
the safe life of pipelines through proper
assessment of defects and guidelines for
the appropriate selection of pipeline repair
techniques and methods.
The manual is intended to help
operators avoid unexpected operational
costs and provide guidance for opera-

tor qualification for repair of in-service
pipelines. The manual has been used by
PRCI member companies to generate
company standards and procedures related
to in-service repairs of pipeline and related
surface facilities. It also provides guidance
to pipeline operators and service vendors
as they:
• Choose appropriate repair techniques
for specific defects in pipelines.
• Develop or enhance their own procedures and-or manuals for pipeline repairs.
• Train or qualify maintenance personnel.
The manual outlines and describes
known and commonly accepted techniques for pipeline repairs, with major
emphasis on methods that can be applied
to in-service pipelines repairs.
It includes pipeline repair methods
used in Europe and discusses the various
types of pipeline defects that lend themselves to being repaired in-service.

Explosion? Fire?
Must be an oil
and gas disaster
Ignorance and suspicion frolic again at
the expense of oil and gas.
On the morning of July 25, an explosion
and ﬁre in Dallas shut down two busy interstate highways. News reports, apparently
starting with an Associated Press story,
attributed the blast to liqueﬁed natural gas.
Well into the afternoon, for example,
the web site of the Dallas NBC television
afﬁliate was reporting this: “Explosions at

a liqueﬁed natural gas plant Wednesday
morning injured three people and shut
down Interstate 35E and Interstate 30 near
downtown Dallas, forcing evacuations
within a half-mile.”
The facility that blew up was an acetylene distribution center owned by Southwest Industrial Gases Inc. LNG played no
role.
As mistakes go, this one’s a whopper.
But the chance that initial reports might
have been wrong didn’t forestall opportunistic publicity-seeking.
“This morning’s Dallas liqueﬁed natural
gas plant explosion is another incident in
a long line of recent oil and gas infrastructure disasters,” began an afternoon press
release pitching interviews with “an expert
in oil and gas facility/pipeline safety and
maintenance.”
Such an expert might be expected to
question news of an LNG explosion in
Dallas.
But the prospective interview subject
had no chance to apply constructive doubt.
William Schutt, founder and president of
MATCOR Inc., a corrosion engineering ﬁrm
in Doylestown, Pa., didn’t see the press release that offered his expertise while parroting false reports in the context of multiple
oil and gas “disasters.”
“We were being proactive on our end
and went with what we saw in the AP
story,” explained Matthew McLoughlin,
senior account executive of Gregory FCA
Communication, Ardmore, Pa., source of
the release. Alerted to the error by Warren
True, Oil & Gas Journal chief technology
editor and editor of LNG Observer, “I sent a
correction immediately,” McLoughlin said.
Corrections eventually found their ways
into news accounts of the explosion, too.
Future hearings on LNG terminal siting will
show how effective they were.
Here’s betting that somewhere, some
project opponent will brandish the Dallas
LNG explosion that never happened—
which was, after all, just one of those oil
and gas disasters everybody expects.

Equities market, GDP rattle oil prices
Futures prices for crude and petroleum products took unusual bounces in the last
full week of July, inﬂuenced by a falling equities market and US economic growth
with virtually no immediate changes in supply and demand.
The September contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes traded at $73.1076.38/bbl July 25 before closing at $75.88/bbl, up $2.32 for the day to recoup virtually
all losses from the previous three sessions on the New York Mercantile Exchange
as traders shrugged off a bearish inventory report. The Energy Information Administration said US crude inventories fell 1.1 million bbl to 351 million bbl in the week
ended July 20. Gasoline stocks increased 800,000 bbl to 204.1 million bbl in the
same period, still below average.
One reason for the bullish market was that US reﬁneries operated at 91.7% of
capacity during the week ended July 20, the highest level since September 2006. US
gasoline production rose to 9.3 million b/d, while gasoline imports increased to 1.65
million b/d, the highest weekly average ever. That “created a counterseasonal build in
gasoline,” said Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London. While 700,000 bbl of the
gasoline build was on the West Coast, East Coast inventories fell for the ﬁrst time in
6 weeks. Total distillate inventories rose 1.5 million bbl yet stayed below their 5-year
average. Diesel inventories fell, and heating oil inventories rose by 2.9 million bbl.
The September crude contract traded as high as $77.24/bbl July 26 before closing at $74.95/bbl on NYMEX. The commodities market was pulled down as the Dow
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 311.5 points in its second worst session of
the year as fears of shaky credit markets and the troubled housing industry swept
Wall Street. NYMEX “reluctantly gave up the early session gains when it was apparent that the stock market slide would be too large to ignore,” said Olivier Jakob,
managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland.
However, September crude jumped to $77.02/bbl July 27, just 1¢ short of tying the
record-high NYMEX closing on the New York market after the Commerce Department
reported a second-quarter jump in the US economy. The record high closing price for
a front-month crude contract was $77.03/bbl on July 14, 2006, amid fears that ﬁghting between Israel and Muslim militia in Lebanon might spread.
Gross domestic product growth—the best national barometer of economic
ﬁtness—jumped to 3.4%/year in the latest quarter from just 0.6%/year in the ﬁrst,
which marked the lowest GDP growth in 4 years. Although the DJIA continued to
tumble as a result of the sour housing market, crude traders saw the increased GDP
as indicating a greater demand for fuel.
Natural gas
Crude prices were choppy but trended upwards during the week. Natural gas
futures prices also vacillated but followed a downward trend from a July 20 closing
at $6.45/MMbtu to $6.11/MMbtu on July 27, despite a rally in the last three sessions
before the August contract expired. The diverging paths of the two commodities further illustrated the breakdown of the pricing relationship between crude and natural
gas, said analysts at the Societe Generale Group (SG) in Paris. “This week natural
gas broke out of the competing fuel band and is now cheaper than residual fuel oil,”
said SG analysts.
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, “Gas
markets could be headed for a late summer melt-down similar to...last year,” when frontmonth gas contracts “plunged from nearly $8/Mcf in early August to the low of $4/Mcf at
the end of September.” Raymond James lowered its gas price estimates to $6/Mcf from
$6.50/Mcf for the third quarter and to $6.50/Mcf from $7.50/Mcf for the fourth quarter.
However, it raised its oil price estimate to $73/bbl from $67/bbl for the third quarter.
Adam Sieminski at Deutsche Bank AG, New York, warned that the recent earthquake that shut down the Kashiwasaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Japan will
soon tighten world energy supplies by increasing demand for competitive fuels in
an already stretched market.
The Kashiwasaki-Kariwa plant could be closed for a year, and other Japanese
nuclear plants potentially may come down for safety inspections. Sieminski noted
that in 2003, the Tokyo Electric Power Co., which operates the Kashiwasaki-Kariwa
plant, had to close all 17 of its nuclear reactors for inspection and maintenance.
“This consequently led to increases in Japan’s fuel oil and LNG imports because the
marginal swing power supply capacity in Japan is mainly fossil fuel-based owing to
their higher variable running costs,” said Sieminski.

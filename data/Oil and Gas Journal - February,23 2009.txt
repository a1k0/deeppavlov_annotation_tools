Happy New Year?

Rely on it. ABB Reliability Services.
In this economy, good may not be good enough. “Bad” has
no chance. If your plant isn’t operating more efﬁciently than
your competitors’, the New Year won’t be so happy.
Answer these questions: Is your maintenance an
uncontrollable cost or a proﬁt contributor? Could your
maintenance beneﬁt from a culture makeover? Do you feel there is a better way to
maintain your assets?
ABB can help. ABB Full Service® is a partnership where ABB assumes full
responsibility for customers’ maintenance operations and contractually commits to
performance improvements, such as increased Overall Equipment Effectiveness and
reduced Total Maintenance Costs.
How can we do this? Because maintenance is a core business for us. We’ve done it
for 20 years, in 27 countries, at more than 150 sites worldwide. Not ready for a strategic
maintenance partnership? We also help identify opportunities for plant reliability
improvement and close performance gaps; maximize your Enterprise Asset Management
software; and reduce maintenance and energy costs by managing your motors.
Contact us today at 877-234-6756 or reliability.services@us.abb.com

COVER
European Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs unveiled in September 2007 new proposals that the European Commission has
suggested to improve gas competition across its 27 member states.
But some provisions, such as full ownership unbundling of energy
supply and transmission, have not been welcomed by member states,
particularly France and Germany. The codecision procedure on
a finalized text, involving the commission, council, and parliament is under way, and the pressure is on reaching a compromise
before parliament goes for elections in June. OGJ’s special report on
European Gas Liberalization, beginning on p. 20, looks at the reactions from these institutions and academics to the commission’s
measures. Photo from EC.

Eni sets production growth target of 3.5%/year
Eni SPA plans to increase its production by 3.5%/year over the
next 3 years despite the uncertainty surrounding the economic
downturn and energy markets.
It will invest €48.8 billion in 2009-12, slightly less than in its
2008-11 plan; exploration and production will cost €34 billion.
The company said it would aim for a reserves replacement ratio
of 130% during 2009-12 and after that would maintain an average
production growth of 3%/year to 2015 by stepping up activities in
Africa, OECD countries, and Central Asia-Russia.
“More than 90% of production and investments to 2012 will be
concentrated in these areas,” Eni said.
The company is confident it can achieve these figures because of
the quality of its portfolio in low-cost production areas with large
projects that have economy of scale benefits.
Paolo Scaroni, chief executive of Eni, told investors in London
that this year its production is expected to be above 1.8 million
boe/d, based on an oil price of $43/bbl. In 2012, this will exceed
2 million boe/d, based on a $55/bbl scenario.
In the next 4 years, more than 500,000 boe/d of new production will start, 85% of which is related to projects that will be
profitable even if oil prices are below $45/bbl.
By 2012 the company expects to have international gas sales of
124 billion cu m with an average growth of 7% a year, thanks also
to the contribution of Distrigas.

Coal-ﬁred plants produce more carbon than LNG
Coal-fired power plants produce 161% more greenhouse gas
emissions through their life cycles than plants fueled by LNG, an
independent study found.
The study, by PACE Global Energy Services for the Center on
Liquefied Natural Gas, also found that two cleaner coal technologies, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and advanced
ultrasupercritical coal (SCPC), produce 70% more GHG emissions
than LNG.
“Replacing just one coal plant with LNG-fueled power generation for one year would equate to removing 557,000 cars off the
roads. LNG will clearly play a crucial role in helping meet the substantial increase for clean burning natural gas once climate change
legislation becomes a reality,” said CLNG Pres. Bill Cooper.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

He said the PACE study provides an “apples to apples” comparison by using a representative average of typical US coal and LNG
operations for generating electricity. These included a gas-fired
power plant supplied with LNG, a coal-fired plant, and plants using the IGCC and SCPC technologies, which are not yet available
in the US.

Rockies reﬁners settle air pollution charges
Two Rocky Mountain refiners agreed to pay more than $141
million to settle federal air pollution charges, the US Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice said.
Frontier Oil Corp. agreed to pay a $1.23 million fine and spend
$127 million on pollution control upgrades at its Cheyenne, Wyo.,
and El Dorado, Kan., refineries. Wyoming Refining Co. agreed in a
separate settlement to pay a $150,000 fine and spend $14 million
on similar upgrades at its Newcastle, Wyo., plant.
The settlements will reduce harmful air emissions by 7,000 tons
annually, EPA and DOJ said. They said the agreements require installation of advanced control technologies, which will reduce yearly
emissions of sulfur dioxide by some 3,775 tons, nitrogen oxide
by some 2,100 tons, and other pollutants by some 1,200 tons. The
three refineries’ combined production capacity is 168,000 b/d.
Each refinery also will upgrade leak detection and repair practices to reduce harmful emissions from pumps and valves, implement programs to minimize the number and severity of flaring
events, and implement new strategies to ensure continued compliance with the federal Clean Air Act’s benzene waste requirements,
according to EPA and DOJ.
As part of its settlement, Frontier agreed to install dome covers
on refinery storage tanks at its two plants to reduce volatile organic
compound emissions. The company also agreed to correct deficiencies in the refineries’ risk management program, which were identified in a 2006 EPA inspection, including overdue inspections and
tests of storage vessels containing toxic and flammable substances.
EPA said that under CAA, facilities that handle large amounts of
chemicals are required to develop a risk management program to
assess hazards associated with dangerous chemicals. The program
must include an accident prevention program and an emergency
response plan to deal with accidental releases, the federal agency
said. ✦

Production

TNK-BP starts production from Siberian ﬁelds
Anglo-Russian oil joint venture TNK-BP Holding reported it has
started commercial production at Urna and Ust-Tegus fields in the
Uvat area of the Tyumen region in Siberia, feeding crude into the
264-km pipeline that connects the fields with the OAO Transneft
pipeline system.
Urna and Ust-Tegus, which lie in the eastern part of Uvat, hold
an estimated 300 million tonnes of oil in place, including 100 million tonnes of reserves. Plans call for the production of some 1.5
million tonnes of crude from the fields in 2009.
At the same time, TNK-BP expects to spend some $500 million
on the Uvat project, including the drilling of development wells
and construction of other necessary field facilities.
TNK-BP said it has invested $925 million in field development
and construction at the fields.
In 2008, TNK-BP increased its oil production over 2007’s by
2.6% to 601 million boe, the company said.

On delivery, the joint venture will charter out the vessel to an
affiliate of Schahin Engenharia SA, a leading drillship operator in
Brazil. The Brazilian firm will provide drilling services for the exploration and development of Petrobras’s deepwater oil and gas
fields in Brazil and overseas.
The announcement follows reports last December that Petrobras obtained $750 million in financing from a group of Japanese
banks, including Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., Mizuho Corporate Bank, and Banco de Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
Petrobras said the money would be used to finance its investment program, including expansion of a refinery based in Sao Jose
dos Campos, Sao Paulo.
The Brazilian firm, which said the loans will have a maturity of
10 years, did not immediately reveal the financing cost or other
details as the contract has a confidentiality clause. However, Petrobras’s Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa said the conditions of
the loan were “pretty reasonable” and “attractive,” although “not
as good as a year ago.”

PDVSA pays due bills for Mariscal Sucre drillship
Neptune Marine & Drilling Ltd., a subsidiary of Singaporebased Jasper Holdings, said Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de
Venezuela SA (PDVSA) has paid $25.95 million to settle overdue
bills in connection with its Mariscal Sucre natural gas project.
The payments cover, among others, all day rate invoices for
drilling services provided to PDVSA from Oct. 1 to Dec 18, 2008,
Neptune said, adding that it “continues to operate under the drilling contract with PDVSA.”
With the payments from PDVSA, Neptune said, “certain breaches in the loan agreement entered into between another subsidiary, Neptune Marine Invests AS and certain banks have also been
cured.”

Processing

Last June, PDVSA took delivery of the drillship Neptune Discoverer under a $785 million contract with Neptune for the drilling of
21 wells at the offshore Mariscal Sucre natural gas project.
Since then, the Mariscal Sucre project has seen several key developments, including a 2,500-sq-km, 3D seismic survey conducted
over the block in September by Norway’s SCAN Geophysical.
“The first processing steps are very promising and show very
good data quality, which will allow PDVSA further to refine its development in this area,” PDVSA said of the survey.
Then, in November, Atlantida Socotherm, a subsidiary of Socotherm, was awarded a contract for the concrete weight coating of
the 115-km Dragon-Cigma pipeline that will be installed as part of
the Mariscal Sucre LNG project.
The project is one of three major developments being developed by PDVSA, each of which will consist of a separate liquefaction train at the Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho (Cigma) natural gas
complex in Guiria.
The first train will source gas from the Plataforma Deltana project, with exports estimated at 4.7 million tonnes/year. PDVSA’s
foreign partners include Galp, Chevron, Qatar Petroleum, Mitsubishi, and Mitsui.
The second train will source gas from the Mariscal Sucre project, also exporting an estimated 4.7 million tonnes/year. PDVSA’s
foreign partners for this project include Galp, Enarsa, Itochu, Mitsubishi, and Mitsui.
The third train will source an as-yet undetermined amount of
gas from Blanquilla-Tortuga fields. PDVSA’s foreign partners include Gazprom, Petronas, Eni, and Energias de Portugal.
According to PDVSA, the total investment in the three LNG
projects could reach $20 billion, with first exports expected by
2013. ✦

Eni lets reﬁnery contract to GE Oil & Gas

stream assets in Italy, including its 84,000 b/d Livorno refinery on
the Tuscan coast in northern Italy.
Angelo Caridi, head of refining and marketing at Eni, said at a
briefing in London that falling global demand, increasing energy
efficiency, and the growth of biofuels were behind the poor outlook.
The amount of high value middle distillates, such as diesel fuel,
will rise to 45% of refining output in 2012 compared with 40%
in 2008.
“In refining, Eni plans to increase the complexity and the yield
in medium distillates, exploiting proprietary technologies,” it
said.
This year, Eni plans to start up three hydrocracking units and in
2012, a new plant at its Sannazzaro refinery, which would account
for the majority of investments in this area under the plan.

a critical part of Eni refining and marketing division’s project to
boost production at its refinery in Sannazzaro, Italy.
The reactors, which will weigh 2,000 tons each, will be the
centerpiece of a new process technology designed to enable Eni to
produce more middle distillates from each barrel of feedstock.
The refinery will highlight a proprietary Eni process called Eni
slurry technology that enables increased efficiency in unconventional oils, heavy oils, and residues distillation. Unlike other heavy
oil cracking processes, the process produces no residues.
The two reactors are scheduled for delivery to the Eni refinery in
first quarter 2011, with commercial operation expected in 2012.

imports by boosting domestic supply, plans to construct two new
refineries and upgrade an existing facility.
“We still import fuels in a large volume,” said Indonesian President Bambang Susilo Yudhoyono, adding that, as a matter of economic efficiency, Pertamina “will build three refineries within 3-5
years.”
Pertamina Corp. Sec. Toharso said two of the planned refineries
would be new: one in Bojonegara, Banten, and another in Tuban,
East Java. The third project, meanwhile, will be an expansion of the
existing refinery at Balongan in West Java.
The total capacity of the three planned refineries will be 400,000
b/d, Toharso said, adding that Pertamina is looking for partners for
oil supplies as well as for financing of the new facilities.
“We’re considering an Iranian company to become our crude
oil supplier,” Toharso said. “But the process is progressing slowly
and we’re trying to expedite this.”
The decision to construct new refineries comes as Indonesia’s

domestic demand has far outstripped Pertamina’s production.
In 2008, Pertamina produced 227.2 million bbl of fuels and
imported 142.1 million bbl. In 2007, Pertamina produced 226.1
million bbl of fuels and imported 138.7 million bbl.
However, despite the need for new refining capacity, officials
earlier this week said that Pertamina has no plan to import diesel
oil and kerosine this year under the firm’s public service obligation
(PSO) as production by its own refineries would be sufficient.
On Feb. 11, the director general of oil and gas of the ministry
of energy and mineral resources, Evita Legowo, told a meeting of
the Energy Commission of the House of Representatives that Pertamina would import only premium gasoline this year.
She said that premium gasoline consumption under the PSO
this year had been set at 123.856 million bbl, while the refineries
could produce only 68.35 million bbl, leaving Pertamina to import
55.506 million bbl. ✦

Japan welcomes LNG supplies from Sakhalin-2
Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso and Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev are scheduled to attend a ceremony Feb. 18 on Sakhalin
Island to mark the onset of operations at the Sakhalin-2 LNG liquefaction plant at Prigorodnoye.
Under the Sakhalin-2 project, natural gas will be transported
from offshore fields to the Prigorodnoye liquefaction plant for the
production of 9.6 million tonnes/year (tpy) of LNG, with 60% of
it bound for Japan.
Under contracts of as long as 20 years, Russian LNG will account for 7% of Japan’s total LNG imports, allowing the Asian nation to diversify its sources of energy supply.
At their Feb. 18 meeting, the Russian and Japanese leaders also
will discuss possible funding for future LNG projects, such as
Sakhalin-3, according to Eiichi Sasaki, energy representative for the
Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).
In fact, Sasaki told delegates at the Russian Shelf 2009 conference that JBIC “is prepared to support Sakhalin-3 if Japanese companies are involved.” He added that JBIC is primarily interested in
projects in the Far East and Sakhalin that are focused on energy
supply to Japan.
The Sakhalin-3 project includes the Veninsky block being developed by Russia’s state-owned OAO Rosneft and China’s Sinopec,
and the Kirinsky, East Odoptinsky, and Ayashsky blocks, which have
yet to be assigned.
Sakhalin-3 is expected to come on stream in 2017-20, according to Russia’s draft Gas Industry Development Strategy, with peak
production reaching as much as 28.6 billion cu m/year of gas.
The onset of supplies of LNG from Sakhalin-2 coincided with
reports that a consortium of Japanese utility firms has agreed to a
drastic cut in supplies from Indonesia, falling to 2-3 million tpy
from 12 million tpy.
Raden Priyono, chairman of Indonesia’s upstream oil and gas
regulating body BPMigas, said that under the new agreement,
the Japanese consortium will buy 3 million tpy of LNG during
2011-15, and 2 million tpy during 2016-20.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The consortium, comprised of Kansai Electric Power Co., Osaka
Gas Co., Chubu Electric Power Co., Kyushu Electric Power Co., Toho
Gas Co., and Nippon Steel Corp., will buy a total of 25 million
tonnes of gas from Bontang LNG plants in East Kalimantan.
Priyono, who said that Japanese buyers have agreed to waive any
penalties for undelivered LNG, added that the new contract price
will be “much higher” than the price under previous contracts.

Libya takes delivery of two oil tankers
Libya’s state-owned General National Maritime Transport Co.
(GNMTC) has taken delivery of two 115,000-dwt oil tankers, the
Al-Qadisiyah and Al-Jala, from Cido Shipping of Japan.
The Al-Qadisiyah, built in 2008 and formerly called the Pacific
Fantasy, holds 835,000 bbl of oil, while the Al-Jala, built in 2007
and formerly called the Pacific Light, holds 825,000 bbl of oil.
The two deliveries are part of a six-ship deal GNMTC brokered
last December which also included four Aframaxes of around
115,000 dwt each, which the Libyan firm bought from Turkey’s
Geden Lines.
The complete six-ship purchase, with a total transport capacity
of some 5 million bbl, enabled Libya to expand its oil shipping
capacity to 11.8 million bbl, according to state media.
State news agency Jana quoted GNMTC’s development department chief Tarek Youssef as saying the recent purchases bring
GNMTC’s total fleet to 18 tankers. Of these, 13 are crude carriers,
3 are oil products carriers, and 2 are LPG carriers.
In making the purchases, Jana said, “The company took advantage of the current global crisis to acquire the tankers at prices 20%
lower than in normal circumstances.”
Jana credited Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi ’s son Hannibal
Gadhafi, who is the manager of GNMTC, for the business strategy
of buying ships during a global economic downturn, which had
adversely affected the shipping industry.
Jana quoted the younger Qadhafi as saying the price paid for
each ship was $67-68 million, which compared favorably with an
earlier asking price of $85-90 million. ✦

Fission for hydrogen
In a response to Duncan Macleod’s
article “Oil industry ramps up for hydrogen vehicles,” Thomas Wyman argues
that hydrogen will never be more than
a “boutique fuel” (OGJ, Dec. 8, 2008,
p. 26; Jan. 19, 2009, p. 14). I would say
that Mr. Wyman is correct if and only if
we live in a world void from the laws of
physics that Albert Einstein discovered.
It is a simple and undisputable
fact that the energy from the fission
of one atom of uranium emits about
10,000,000 times the energy one gets
from burning one atom of coal. This
observation is leading the US and other
countries in the world that comprise the
Generation IV International Forum (GIF)
to utilize the waste heat from very hightemperature nuclear reactors to economically make hydrogen from water.
These “very high-temperature” nuclear
reactors are called Gen-IV for being the
fourth generation of nuclear reactor design. Of course the advantage to creating
energy by consuming hydrogen in an
oxygen environment is that your waste
product is water.
I do not mean to imply that this
Gen-IV technology can be utilized either
tomorrow or even in 10 years. However,
if the US and world will commit the required resources, this technology can be
fully developed to not only safely generate electricity but also simultaneously
and economically make hydrogen from
water plus also desalinate brackish waters. This hydrogen could first be used to
make synthetic hydrocarbons to fuel our
existing internal combustion engines
until the hydrogen fuel cell economy is
fully established.
As Americans, let’s stop living in the
dark ages and open our eyes to the possibilities that available technologies can
provide.

Backward California
Partly because California officially lives in the
past, Americans elsewhere must help the state deal
with financial desperation. The $800 billion law
Congress passed this month in an effort to stimulate the economy pushes an estimated $26 billion
toward California. The state government has a
budget deficit expected to reach a staggering $41
billion by the middle of 2010.
The generosity gives American taxpayers
dollars-and-cents reasons to ask how a state with
extraordinary endowments of personal wealth
and natural resources fell to such fiscal despair
and whether it has done everything possible to
solve its own problems. Answers to these questions
should be especially poignant after the recent ascension of liberal Californians to positions of power in Congress, to which President Barack Obama

report by European think tank Bruegel.1
Now in an economic downturn,
with a tightening of credit markets,
operators are even more hesitant to
make investment decisions because of
regulatory uncertainty. In the early part
of this year, negotiations urgently need
to be concluded among the European
Commission, European Council, and
European Parliament over the third energy package, which contains a number
of controversial measures, including the
suggested mandatory ownership unbundling of vertically integrated energy
companies.
European elections for its parliament
are scheduled for June, and a new commission is be convened in 2010. New
faces and new attitudes could mean the
unraveling of all the work on the package to date, prompting a fourth energy
package and more passionate debate.
Once a compromise is reached on
the sticking points, the revised package will go to the parliament for the
second reading on Apr. 21-24, either
approving a compromise reached with
the council or reintroducing its firstreading amendments, a parliament
spokesman told OGJ. Other areas under
PECIAL
discussion include conditions for thirdparty access to natural gas transmission
networks and the rules for the internal
market on natural gas.
“We are confident that we can reach

a compromise on the third energy
package,” an EC spokesman told OGJ.
“All parties have a big interest to reach
a compromise; no one wants to be accused of delaying the package.”
If the legislation passes this hurdle,
the gas industry will focus on submitting comments on how the new regime
will be implemented.
But Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are not as optimistic about
brokering an agreement by April. Some

One of the priorities for the European Union (EU), which now comprises
27 member states, is advancing its gas
and electric power liberalization agenda.
Adoption of its third energy liberalization package would move the EU closer
to that goal, but adoption still faces a
number of obstacles.
Protectionism of national monopolies has been at the core of a 10-year
battle against opening markets to
new participants. However, security of supply is now one of the
EU’s major energy objectives, and
the longer market liberalization
is delayed, with companies not
investing in a timely manner, the
deeper is the risk of endangering
supply security.
In 2003, the International Energy
Agency projected that during 2001-30,
the estimated cumulative gas investments [within the EU-15 countries]
would amount to $85-95 billion for
distribution, $50-75 billion for transmission, $10-15 billion for storage, and

it can decide how to proceed with its
new export pipelines. A spokesman told
OGJ: “We hope that the deliberations
between the council and the parliament
will lead to an outcome that will encourage cross-border investments from
all parties, including those companies
from outside the EU that are willing to
pursue business opportunities in the EU
member states and bring added value to
Europe’s energy infrastructure.”
This special report focuses on some
of the more contentious provisions of
the commission’s draft legislation: ownership unbundling, the Gazprom clause,
and the creation of a new European
energy regulator.

OPENING OF LIBERALIZED MARKETS ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION

retain their interest in the dismantled
groups via a share-splitting scheme under this measure, the commission said.
Member states such as France and
Germany, which have national champions, believe ownership unbundling
is unconstitutional. They contend that
selling these assets could endanger energy security and leave consumers with
higher prices. Opposing states also feel
that it adds another level of bureaucracy,

The third energy package was
published in September 2007. These
measures aim to bring effective competition to the European market, as previous legislation—the EU Gas Directive of
1998 and the Second Energy Directive
of 2003, have not been entirely successful (see box below).

Germany’s support for the commission’s package is critical. With the
second largest gas market in Europe,
Germany would determine how its
neighbors trade.
“Likewise, Germany is geographically located at the heart of the European gas market, where gas from all key
sources of European gas (the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, and, to a lesser
extent, Algeria) meets,” said consultancy IHS Global Insight.

Vertically integrated companies tend
to view networks as strategic assets for
their own commercial interests, rather
than for serving the overall interest
of network customers. “In particular
[such companies] underinvest in new
networks, fearing that these investments
might help competitors to prosper on
its national market,” said the Committee
of Regions (COR), which represents the
subnational regions of the EU.
What would be the impact of this
policy on Europe’s biggest gas exporter? Gazprom has made no secret
of expanding its position in Europe
through buying stakes in transmission
and distribution systems, or developing
partnerships with them.
Catherine Locatelli, a researcher at
the French think tank LEPPI, warns

Exporters’ views...
Europe’s three largest gas exporters
are Norway, Russia, and Algeria. The
process of liberalization affects them
with price and volume risks.
Gas liberalization also has implications for their relationships with the
EU on security, diplomacy, and foreign
policy. Liberalization results across the
EU have been patchy, and countries
wish to deal with a single integrated
market, rather than 27 different regula-

that the growth of Russian gas production will not be independent of the
institutional modifications of the EU,
Gazprom’s principal export market. The
commission’s full unbundling policy
could push Russia to seek diversification
of its exports on a grander scale.

Independent operator
The commission’s second unbundling model for energy companies
would be to establish an Independent
System Operator (ISO) that would
assume operational control of the networks. Companies with energy production and supply assets could keep
22

T E R E S T
their networks, but an ISO would be
appointed by national governments to
decide on the use of the infrastructure
and on investment plans. This would
stop the transfer of privileged information, discrimination, and bias. This
alternative was suggested to stave off
hostility about full unbundling, but it
wasn’t well received by member states,
who felt it would infringe upon their
property rights.
The disadvantage of this concept is
the increased regulatory burden, the
commission warned, because it would
have to be confident that the designation of the ISO was independent. Furthermore, network owners must work
with the national energy regulator to
implement its 10-year network investment plan and comply with the ISO’s

critics have pointed out that the EU is
a major importer of gas from non-EU
countries and so the focus should be on
security of supply, given its vulnerability to the geopolitical crises of its gas
providers.
Clearly the dispute between Russia
and Ukraine and its impact on Europe
earlier this year was a pertinent example of this point. Russia stopped gas
supplies to Ukraine for its own domestic use because it claimed Ukraine failed
to pay its debts on time (OGJ Online,
Jan. 2, 2009). In turn, Ukraine, which
is a transit country to Europe, stopped
sending gas.
In its working document published
on Jan. 9, 2008, the parliament said
that because there were also structural
differences between the two mar-

tory systems as multiple systems add
complexity and increase costs.
Russia’s Gazprom provides 25%
of the EU’s gas supplies, and it feels
fundamentally that long-term import
contracts are crucial, considering the
scale of the investments required for
gas projects.
One opportunity arising from liberalization would be driving its spot
trading to another level, although supplying gas solely on this basis would
be too risky. In 2007, the company’s
trading arm sold 6.7 billion cu m of

gas on the trading floors of the UK,
Belgium, Netherlands, and France.
This amount exceeded the level of
2006 by 25%.
Although it recognizes the complexity and level of investment for the gas
business, the commission is troubled
by the nature of long-term contracts,
which in effect, distort the concept of
competition.
For Algeria, Energy Minister Chakib
Khelil has said that long-term contracts
put it at a disadvantage because revis-

capacity.
Another issue is having confidence
that the ISO would not be swayed by
the major supplier and incumbent
transporter, which would be its largest
buyer and the provider of all its capabilities. In addition, utility shareholders would suffer a loss of control and
privatization of these assets.

kets, “it may be necessary to consider
the possibility of opening up the gas
market more slowly than the market in
electricity.”

Market approaches
According to the commission’s suggestions, the same approach on ownership unbundling should be used in
both the gas and electricity market. But

Council’s response
The EU Energy Council, however,
took a different approach to ownership unbundling and published its
response to the document last October.
This model, although similar in objective to the ISO, differs in its internal
organization and introduces more
bureaucracy to stop vertically integrated
energy companies from being unfair
and discriminatory in running their

transmission and distribution networks
to other entrants. After intense lobbying by member states—led by France
and Germany—it said companies could
keep their transmission businesses,
provided they were monitored by an
Independent Transmission Operator
(ITO). Effectively the transmission system would be legally unbundled from
energy production.
However, to assuage the fears of nations such as Spain that their unbundled
companies would be bought by rivals
who had more financial clout, these
energy producers would be prevented
from purchasing the grid businesses
of energy companies in European
countries where full unbundling had
occurred.
In effect, all three models of unbun-

ing its prices depends on the goodwill
of its European customers, and this
is sometimes difﬁcult to secure. It is
pushing for short-term contracts because prices would be more favorable.
Khelil has been critical of the mixed
results of gas liberalization across
the EU because each member state
continues to act in its own interests
rather than adopting a common policy.
A major risk with liberalization is that it
endangers supply guarantees because
exporters will focus on those customers who can pay the best price.

parliament is whether they can agree
to a compromise on the model for
unbundling so the package can secure
the 51% vote needed during its second
reading in parliament and be adopted
in member states.
With the ITO model, parliament has
introduced additional measures, such
as a supervisory body and compliance
program, to ensure that utilities comply.
It also has called for a new regulatory
agency to report on the progress of the
system within 5 years, and if it finds
that this has failed, it possibly could
demand complete unbundling.
The parliament also is keen to ensure
that consumer protection is a core
aspect of the directive, arguing that,
with the current lack of transparency
in the gas market, customers “do not
currently receive full information about
the product consumed; energy bills are
often indecipherable,” it said.
“Consumers must be able to make
free, timely, and informed choices in a
transparent and competitive market…
not subject to external (explicit or
implicit) price regulation mechanisms,
which undermine price-forming mechanisms and, consequently, the operation
of competition.”2

with the EU to ensure reliability of
long-term supplies under this clause.
Moving downstream gives Gazprom
better access to customers and is quite
profitable because liberalization alters
the distribution of income in the gas
chain.
Roman Zyuzev, an academic at
Institut Europeen des Hautes Etudes
Internationales, describes the clause as

discussions to help flesh out the EU’s
and Russia’s new partnership and cooperation agreement.
The parliament endorsed the commission’s clause to protect the EU’s
energy security. Europe has tried to pave
the way for its companies in Russia in
the past but has been unsuccessful.
But the council, after strong lobbying by member states who were worried about upsetting Russia—because
they import large quantities of its gas—
said it wanted a more diluted version of
the clause. It has proposed that an EU
member state could strike an individual
bilateral agreement with a foreign
country before its companies could buy
the energy pipelines and grids of that
EU nation.

The ‘Gazprom clause’

Under the commission’s draft
legislation, a new European regulatory
agency would be set up to focus solely
on the regulatory gap for cross-border
transactions in gas and electricity. It
found that full development of the
market has been impeded by a lack of
coherence in the powers of national
energy regulators.
The Agency for Coordination Energy
Regulators (ACER) will be empowered
to review, “on a case-by-case basis,”
decisions made by national regulators
and to facilitate cooperation between
network operators.
However, ACER’s powers will be
strictly limited to cross-border issues.
“The agency is not a substitute for
national regulators, nor is it a European
regulator,” the commission said.
Fears about this measure centered on
introducing new levels of bureaucracy

Gabrielli steers Petrobras’s $174 billion investment plan

Jose Sergio Gabrielli, chief executive and president of Brazil’s Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), sat in the
company’s new offices in the West End
of London, which was blanketed under
10-in. of snow, and explained why the
company would invest $174.4 billion

volatility in the financial and commodity markets.

Clearly this intense interest in the

the government having a greater stake
in oil and natural gas production. This
is one of the proposals under Brazil’s
new oil and gas law, which the government has said wouldn’t affect previous
contracts.
The amendments also envisage the
creation of a second state oil company

views the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas
project as an example of mutually

Russia new technologies and access
to the Asian market, while granting
Japan new sources of hydrocarbons.
Aso said as much in an interview
with Russian state media last week
ahead of his Feb. 18 visit to Sakhalin
Island, where he met with Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev and took
part in the opening ceremony of the
Sakhalin-2 project.
“Japan has a long record of participation in oil and gas developments
on Sakhalin, which dates back to the
beginning of the 20th century,” he
said, noting that the onset of production “after overcoming numerous
difficulties is a memorable and very
happy event for Japan and Russia.”
Aso was diplomatic in side-stepping details of the so-called “numerous difficulties.” In fact, the project
has been fraught with difficulties, not
least the fact that Russia at one point

doing business on Sakhalin Island
continues to be risky.
In October it was reported that
the ExxonMobil Corp.-led Sakhalin-1
project, in which Itochu Corp. and
Marubeni Corp. have stakes, was
barred from exporting gas to China,
due to pressure from Moscow and
Gazprom. In fact, the Sakhalin 1
developers have proposed exporting the majority of the gas to China,
with Gazprom a wholesaler for only
a portion. But Gazprom is looking to
obtain exclusive rights to purchase all
the gas from Sakhalin-1.

Problems emerge

Not least, Gazprom is proposing a
relatively low price in its negotiations
to purchase the gas produced by
Sakhalin-1. Not surprisingly, problems have begun to emerge for the
project. Two weeks ago the Sakhalin-1
consortium started to suspend future
phases of the project, citing Moscow’s failure to give timely approval
for its budget plans.

Under the agreement, ExxonMobil is
committed to shooting 4,000 km of

and the drilling of one exploration well.
Gadhafi ’s remarks were broadcast
Feb. 14 by the state-run Great Jamahiriyah TV, which aired a recording of
a meeting between the Libyan leader
along with secretaries and members of
Libyan peoples’ committees.
Among other views concerning the
redistribution of wealth in his country,
Qadhafi discussed oil revenue, saying it
needed to be looked after carefully, being the country’s only resource.
He said oil is the property of the
people of Libya and Algeria, while in
other oil-producing countries, the oil is
owned by the kings and other leaders,
who took most of the revenue, giving
very little back to the people.

T E R E S T
Qadhafi added that the increase of oil
prices “made me think that oil revenue
should be given to the people.” However, he said, “As soon as we began to
think about this, oil prices plummeted
to as little as $30/bbl.

Avoiding corruption
The Libyan leader went on to discuss
corruption, where some people received more money than others, when
all should have had equal amounts of
money as all income came from oil
revenue.
He said in Libya on the other hand,
oil revenue was in the hands of its people, and he invited anyone in the world
to come to Libya and check for themselves whether that was true or not.
He also discussed possible systems
for distributing oil wealth among the
people, whether each person would

get a specific amount of money regardless of the price of oil, or whether
they should receive more money when
prices go up and less when they go
down.
Qadhafi then read out some possible
suggestions for ways to redistribute oil
revenue.
In one example, he said, people
could receive 3,000 Libyan dinars/
month (around $2,300), but then
would be responsible for everything
in their lives, paying higher bills with
no government subsidies, with no free
health care or education.
These comments echoed earlier
remarks by the Libyan leader during a
televised address at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. “Oil-exporting
countries may look to nationalization
because of the rapidly declining prices,”
the Libyan leader said (OGJ Online, Feb.
2, 2009). ✦

“I believe we need to embrace an

new drilling on the OCS is not going
to reduce drilling elsewhere or meaningfully reduce the number of tankers

maintained.

different than oil is that wind doesn’t

industry’s economic contributions. “In
Louisiana, we have 21,000 producing
company jobs related to oil and gas
just on the OCS with an average annual
salary around $60,000 per employee,”
said John Fleming (R-La.).

Pennsylvania eyes
severance tax

I

f anyone wonders whether the
general economic recession will
affect the oil and gas industry, they
need look at Pennsylvania where Gov.
Edward G. Rendell proposed a natural
gas severance tax on Feb. 4 in his annual budget message.
He seeks the levy as the Keystone
State faces a current projected budget
deficit of $2.3 billion. Interest in
producing gas from the Marcellus
shale has created what he termed “a
Pennsylvania gold rush,” Rendell told
legislators.
He proposed a tax of 5% at the
wellhead, plus 4.7¢/Mcf, an approach identical to neighboring West
Virginia’s. State officials project that it
would raise about $1.82 billion over
5 years, starting with $107.2 million
in 2009-10 and climbing to $631.9
million in 2013-14.

Tax could hurt
State oil and gas industry associations warn that the tax could hurt
existing producers who also would
have to pay it. “Conventional wells
in Pennsylvania are low-yielding
and marginally economic. Only with
careful cost control and minimal operating expense can these wells attract
any investment,” said Lou D’Amico,
executive director of the Independent
Oil and Gas Association of Pennsylvania Feb. 5.
Stephen W. Rhoads, president of
the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Association (POGAM), said the proposed
tax has a 6.25% effective rate. The
volumetric component makes it very
regressive: When gas prices fall below
$2, the effective tax rate is about
7.5%. When prices are $7.50-8, it’s
below 6%, he told me in a Feb. 13

telephone conversation.
POGAM also tried to determine
the proposed levy’s bottom line
impact over a typical shallow well’s
20-year lifetime. “When you put an
effective 6.25% tax against the gross
income to the working interest, drilling costs and operating expenses,
it takes about 30-35% of the net
income away,” Rhoads said.
He said Pennsylvania faces a difficult budget year, and the governor
wants to fill holes. Rhoads said Rendell also welcoms alternative proposals, and that POGAM has one.

Alternative
“We think it would be more practical to lease state forest lands which
lie within the Marcellus Shale fairway
for production and development.
The Department of Conservation and
Natural Resources earned, on average, about $2,500/acre or about $90
million when it held a lease sale in
September for just this purpose,” he
said.
“If you assume Marcellus production rates based on what’s going on
in other shale plays, a lease sale of
100,000 acres annually for 4 years
and lease signing bonuses similar
to last year, we believe the governor
could raise $1 billion from the lease
sales and royalties, based on the
department’s standard 16.5% rate, in
the $800 million range over 5 years,”
Rhoads said.
That would be close to the $1.82
billion the state projects to receive
from the proposed tax, while giving
Pennsylvania a chance to determine
what’s actually within its part of the
Marcellus, he noted. ✦

Lois Capps (D-Calif.)
Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) went further.
“Despite the improvements in oil
drilling technologies, 100% of the

the inevitability of this kind of oil spill

the current oversupply” of natural gas.
That overhang, he said, is being
quickly reduced as gas drilling rigs leave
those basins. In 2008, he said, “it took
1,500 rigs to replace 25% of depleted

reserves and to add about 7%. By yearend 2009, natural gas [reserve] growth

He said, “We will see a two-thirds

but also by “reduced access to capital.”

Field reports indicate that Shell
Western Exploration & Production LP,
Houston, has been spearheading a play
for gas in northeastern New Mexico’s
nonproducing Tucumcari basin.
The company tested gas from an
indicated discovery well in Guadalupe
County after it assumed operation from
an independent. Shell has drilled two
more wells to about 13,000 ft on its
own, is preparing to
spud a third, and has
reportedly completed a
3D seismic survey of as
much as 80 sq miles.
Shell filed reports
with the New Mexico
Oil Conservation Division in late 2008 on stimulation and
testing of the discovery well (CB Webb
No. 1), on a fee lease in 25-11n-23e, in

Cuervo Exploration drilled and cased
the CB Webb well in 2006 but didn’t
perforate due to internal disagreements
among the partners about completion
procedures and economic viability.
Upon taking over from Cuervo, Shell
conducted multiday flow tests between
August 2007 and January 2008. Shell
also reported a flow rate of 1.74 MMcfd
of gas and 47 b/d of water from Pennsylvanian Strawn sandstones of low
permeability and high thermal maturity,
at casing pressures of up to 800 psi.
Shell also reported having perforated
the well in 10 intervals between 7,950
ft and 10,783 ft (all Pennsylvanianaged) and reported a multiple completion in the 10 zones. The total depth on
the discovery well was 10,927 ft, and
the well is plugged back to 10,814 ft.
There was no indication when Shell
might be capable of starting gas production. Low commodity prices have
led the company to rethink participation in some new projects

GeoMet replaced almost three times

The company booked 4 bcf of
proved reserves at Peace River, the first

have been drilled from Nov. 1, 2008,
through Dec. 31, 2009.
Parallel will assign its interest to
Chesapeake as each well is spudded,
and Chesapeake will fund all of Parallel’s drilling, completing, and operating
costs until Chesapeake recovers 150%
of its costs. At 150% payout per project,
50% of the assigned interest will revert
to Parallel.
For all wells drilled after Jan. 1,
2017, Parallel will pay all costs and receive all revenue attributable to its 50%
reversionary interest.
As a result of the farmout and decreases in planned activity in its other
basins, Parallel cut its 2008 capital
budget 76% to $29.1 million.

During field trials,
PetroChina successfully installed screenless
frac-pack completions to
control proppant flowback, thereby extending
Production
the life of marginally
producing wells in Jidong oil fields.
Previous completions with premium
screens and high-rate water packs
required, on average, a workover every
2-3 months to clean out proppant,
formation sand, and fines that greatly
reduced production. Sand production
also caused erosion damage to sandcontrol screens and surface equipment
and plugging of electric submersible
pumps (ESPs).1
The operator, therefore, considered
screenless frac-pack completions using
a tip screen-out design and a newly
developed curable resin for controlling
flow-back of formation sand and proppant.
Field results of these screenless
frac-packs indicate that on-the-fly resin
coating treatment effectively stopped
the proppant and formation sand from
producing back while maintaining the
production rates as designed. The jobs
have decreased substantially the number
of workovers compared to wells left
untreated.
The key to PetroChina’s success is a
liquid resin system (LRS) that is 100%
curable, unlike the resin applied to
resin-precoated proppants (RPP). The
use of liquid resin provides high cohesion strength between the resin-treated
particulates so that they can withstand
the drag forces created by high production flow rates.
The operator has determined that the
technique provides an attractive alternative to conventional frac-pack completions in wells with marginal reserves,
eliminating the need for sand-control
screens and providing access to other
intervals when needed without wellbore restrictions.

Jidong ﬁeld
Jidong field consists of several

smaller fields near Tang Hai in eastern
Hebei province, which borders on the
Bohai Bay in the North China Sea.
Geologically the fields have four
principal producing zones (Minghuazhen, Guantao, DongYing, and Shahejie). The Pliocene Minghuazhen and
Miocene Guantao sandstone formations
are widespread on Liu Nan, Nan Pu,
Gao, Gao Xie, and Miao fields.
The sand

formation is
between 0.04
and 0.35 mm,
whereas the size of Miocene Guantao
(Ng) formation grains are between
0.04 and 0.85 mm.
The screenless frac-pack completions
focused on Minghuazhen and Guantao
formations, which have permeabilities
ranging from 9.6 md to 2.4 darcy. The
Minghuazhen formation has higher
permeability and porosity. The formation also is less consolidated compared
to the Guantao formation.
Bottomhole static temperatures of
the wells range from 145° to 200° F.
The oil has 0.71 to 0.74 gravity and
1.19-2.10 cp viscosity at bottomhole
conditions.1
The Minghuazhen and Guantao
formation sands have calcareous or
siliceous minerals that bond the grains
together. These bonds are soluble in
water and brines, depending on the
amount of calcareous minerals acting
as cementing materials and the amount
and salinity of the water contacting the
bonds.
These bonds have the same characteristics when the siliceous minerals
act as the primary cementing material.
This characteristic can be detrimental in
weakly consolidated sandstone formations.
Possibly the most severe damage can
occur when the cementing materials are
soft clay or silt. These materials quickly

contribute to this increase in conductivity. The tackiness of LRS coating alters
the proppant pack density by increasing inter-grain friction, thus providing
higher porosity within the pack.
LRS not only bonds the proppant
grains to each other, but also bonds to
the fracture faces. This bonding distributes the point-source load of proppant
across the formation face, thus reducing the spalling effect and the amount
of formation fines intruding into the
proppant pack.
Since all the PetroChina wells were
perforated at five shots/ft with 90°
phasing, more than one half of the generated perforations did not align with
the propped fractures.
Without sand-control mechanisms,
these perforations could become primary sources for formation sand and fines
production. Therefore, it was important
that these perforations were cleaned out
completely during wellbore cleanup as
part of the wellbore preparation before
the screenless frac-pack treatment so
that they can be completely filled with
LRS-coated proppant.
Once the LRS-coated proppant filled

Gulf of Mexico insurance availability is tightening
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Oil and gas companies need to very precise
this year regarding their
Drilling
insurance needs for Gulf
of Mexico operations
because insurance providers report that
their own financial returns are severely
squeezed after a number of hurricanes
in recent years.
“This has really tested insurers and
resulted in unprecedented uncertainty
in the insurance market,” said Paul
Dawson, energy underwriter at specialist insurer Beazley Group PLC of
London. “Insurers at the moment are
very nervous.”
A series of exceptional insurance
losses started with Hurricanes Ivan in
2004 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita
in 2005. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in
2008 caused still more losses.
The withdrawal of some insurance
players combined with a reduced risk
appetite from remaining underwriters means reduced overall underwriting capacity is available for oil and gas
companies trying to renew or initiate
new insurance policies this year. Higher
insurance premiums are coming at a
time when oil and gas prices are falling.
Ike’s storm surge put in motion
about 50% more water than the 2005
storms, and Ike alone cost energy insurers more than $4 billion, Dawson said
of estimates based upon information
from Lloyd’s of London.
Lloyd’s is an insurance market where
multiple financial backers come together to pool and spread risk.
Reinsurers provide insurance to
insurance companies; reinsurance is arranged early in the year.
40

Various insurance markets exist
worldwide for oil and gas companies,
although Lloyd’s historically has been
a key market for upstream insurance,
Dawson said. Another source of insurance for offshore operators is Oil Insurance Ltd. (OIL), a mutual insurance
company that includes Chevron and
Royal Dutch Shell among its members.
OIL reported its estimated losses for
the various storms at $895 million for
Ike, $1.5 billion for Rita, and $2.1 billion for Katrina.
“Ultimate settlements will depend
on the final adjustments of all the
losses, a process we expect to take quite
some time,” OIL said.
Beazley’s Dawson said none of the
hurricanes in recent years is “the worst
that we will ever see.” Difficulty in predicting hurricane frequency and scale
has resulted in some insurers withdrawing from Lloyd’s, which insures 60% of
the world’s upstream oil and gas risks
with an overall premium approaching
$1.8 billion.
Dawson believes coverage is available at a reasonable price for oil and
gas companies whose risk managers are
prepared and willing to help insurance
underwriters reduce uncertainty over
potential liabilities

to achieve consensus among multiple
insurers to complete a policy placement
together. Insurers may set individual
terms governing their participation.
While this process might solve the
short-term problem of building capacity, it adds considerable administrative
complexity and is likely to complicate
claims negotiations, Dawson said.
“Communication is very important”
for underwriters trying to understand
their exposure and trying to align the
coverage they offer with oil and gas
companies’ future economic interest in
specific projects, he said.
As insurers put their own reinsurance programs in place this year, oil
and gas companies will find insurers
requiring more details about which
oil company assets are to be insured,
where, and at what value.
“Oil and gas companies themselves
have to be very explicit in the risk that
they wish to transfer,” Dawson said.
Insurers require certain information
before they are prepared to underwrite
the risk.
Risk managers at oil companies need
to review the resulting documentation
carefully and ask questions to understand better how coverage will work in
practice, Dawson said.

Underwriting collaboration
rising

Assessing likely loss value

Generally oil and gas risks are shared
among a number of energy insurers
through a process known as syndication. This allows insurers to spread risk
better in their portfolios.
The ability to efficiently build insurance capacity through a syndicated process allows insured companies to obtain
coverage for large and complex risks.
In 2009, it will be more difficult

If a production platform is damaged
or destroyed, it is reasonably straightforward for an underwriter to assess
loss value, Dawson said. But potential
claims values are harder to determine
with damage or loss of wells.
A “control-of-well” policy, which
insures against the consequences of losing control of a well, typically estimates
exposure based upon the number and
depth of wells. This assumes that all

wells have equal status and are worth
salvaging.
Typically, older platforms have a
number of unproductive wells that
would need to be abandoned if the
production platform were damaged
severely. Storm-related abandonment
costs can be 10 times higher than the
costs that would have been incurred before the storm because of the increased
complexity.
Dawson said underwriters trying to
understand their exposure to wells will
need oil companies to outline which
wells are scheduled for abandonment
and the expected abandonment costs.
Likewise, operators may have a number of producing wells, but the value
of the estimated remaining reserves is
relatively low. Underwriters will need
to know what plans companies have to
reenter or replace wells if the platform
were lost.
Insurers might want to provide only
limited coverage for wells that the company would not replace, Dawson said.

US ethane demand
The US ethylene industry consumes
more than 50% of the US NGL supply. And, because ethylene production
is the only end-use market for ethane
in the US, it is important for any NGL
midstream company to pay close attention to the health of the US ethylene
industry and the actions of ethylene
producers with regard to feedstock
selection.
The 20-month period January
2007 to August 2008 was a fairly
good one for US ethylene producers
for several reasons:
• Low gas-to-crude price ratios in
the US made US ethylene producers
more competitive globally.
• The US ethylene industry’s ability
to shift to ethane and ethane-propane
mix gave it a competitive edge over
heavy feedstock crackers in Europe
and Asia. Those US ethylene producers
leveraged to heavy feedstocks, however, suffered in the high crude price
environment during first and secondquarter 2008.
• Although the US economy was
slowing, the low US dollar created an
export market for US petrochemicals.
• US ethylene production remained

steady at around 55.1 billion lb/year
(88% operating rate).
For gas processors building and announcing new cryogenic plant capacity,
it appeared the ethylene industry was
healthy, and those processors assumed
that ethylene producers could handle
additional ethane volumes coming onto
the market. Yet, an assessment of the US
ethylene industry over the past 18 years
revealed several signs that the US industry was maturing and shifting in ways
that would make it difficult for ethylene
producers to crack much more ethane.
First, US ethylene capacity has
stagnated and ethylene production has
moved within a fairly narrowed range
between 50 billion and 55 billion lb/
year since 2000 (Fig. 1). This pattern
contrasts to the growth period in the
1990s when ethylene capacity and
production were expanding at 1.5 times
that of US economic growth, based on

were one of the major drivers for ethylene growth during the 1990s. After
2000, US demand for ethylene stalled
due to slower US economic growth
and reduced demand for petrochemical
exports as ethylene capacity expanded
overseas.
Second, spikes in natural gas prices
relative to crude oil prices that occurred
in winter 2000-01 and throughout
most of the 2003 caused light feed-

stocks (ethane and propane) to be
uneconomical for ethylene producers
to crack and left the industry skeptical
of the long-term availability of natural
gas in the US. Consequently, ethylene
producers shifted capacity away from
cracking light feedstocks and increased
their ability to crack a wide range of
feedstocks and heavier feedstocks, such
as naphthas and gas oils. By the end of
2007, light feedstock crackers constituted only 35% of US ethylene capac-

ity, compared with 50% in 2000 (see
accompanying table). In addition, 21%
of US ethylene plant capacity is aging
(35 years and older), and this capacity
represents 33% of total ethane consumption.
Relatively stagnant ethylene production and the shift to more flexi
and heavy feed crackers have kept the
demand for ethane from gas processing
well below 800,000 b/d for the past 8
years (Fig. 2). Just as important is the
US ethylene industry’s current wide
range of flexibility to swing off and on
ethane when feedstock economics warrant. Back in winter 2000-01 and again
in 2003 when gas-to-crude price ratios
were well above historical averages,
the ethylene industry was able to drop
ethane cracking by 200,000 to 300,000

b/d in a matter of a few weeks. Conversely, in 2007 and through first-half
2008, when gas-to-crude ratios were
low, the ethylene industry was able to
maximize ethane and propane cracking
and minimize heavy feedstocks.
The US ethylene industry’s ability
quickly to swing feedstocks is largely
responsible for the volatility seen in
ethane consumption. Adding to this
volatility, according to En*Vantage research, is that the US ethylene industry
cannot maximize or minimize ethane
for a period greater than 3-4 months
without disturbing the supply-demand
balance for ethylene coproducts such
as propylene, C4 olefins, and pyrolysis
gasoline. These ethylene coproducts are
valuable building blocks in producing
other petrochemical products. And,

because ethane cracking produces few
coproducts, ethylene producers must
balance their need to optimize profits
when ethane is the preferred feedstock
vs. keeping the coproduct market adequately supplied.
At any given production level for
ethylene, ethane demand can vary,
depending on whether the ethylene
industry is minimizing or maximizing
ethane cracking. The key to predicting
ethane demand is to understand how
ethane cracking can vary at a given level
of ethylene production.
Over the past several years
En*Vantage has analyzed ethane cracking data vs. US ethylene production
levels and has modeled the current configuration of the US ethylene industry
to determine minimum and maximum
levels of ethane cracking. Fig. 3 shows
the results.
Two major trends appeared from our
analysis:
1. As ethylene production increases
the need for ethane cracking increases.
That is, when the ethylene industry
requires that next incremental pound
of ethylene, it turns to ethane because
ethane is the feedstock that provides the
highest ethylene yield.

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.
Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil supply.
They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs during periods of lower oil prices, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling
air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions, mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to these challenges, the oil sands and heavy oil industry continues to develop unconventional
resources that are critical to meeting the world’s long-term needs for reliable hydrocarbon supplies.
Continued progress in oil sands and heavy oil producing technologies means progress in ensuring a dependable supply of
petroleum products at a time when traditional recovery methods are strained by additional demand from rapidly developing
industrial nations.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make this
innovation and progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience. Join the Oil & Gas
Journal and our conference attendees in Calgary this summer for the third annual Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies
Conference and Exhibition.

2. When the ethylene industry is
operating at low utilization rates, it has
more flexibility to swing ethane cracking levels than when it is operating at
higher utilization rates. Consequently,
the US gas processing industry can be
subject to considerable volatility in the
demand for its ethane when the ethylene industry is operating at low utilization rates, as when there is an economic
recession.
The results shown on Fig. 3 make it
possible to predict how ethane demand
will trend for the next several years by
predicting the level of ethylene that
will be produced in the US in the near
future. Fig. 4 shows our forecast for ethylene production; our base case is for
ethylene production to average less than
55 billion lb/year through 2012 as US
net exports of ethylene products decline
as foreign petrochemical production
increases. Absolute best or high-case
scenario for US ethylene production is
of 3.5%/year, taking ethylene production near 60 billion lb/year by 2012.
Applying our base and high case
forecasts for ethylene production to our
regressions for ethane demand indicates
that the US gas processing industry
should develop a substantial overhang

There is always the possibility that
reduced drilling due to depressed natural gas and crude oil prices will curtail
gas production growth and NGL extraction. This is difficult to quantify, and,
besides, the effect on gas production,
if it occurs, may be short lived because
reserves are present.
Unless the economic recession
causes processors to cancel or delay
processing plants that are announced to
come online, ethane extraction capability is on track to exceed the ability of
the ethylene industry to crack ethane.
The ultimate key to “lifting all boats”
in the processing industry will depend
on efforts by US ethylene producers to
increase their capability to crack more
ethane at existing plants, because additional ethylene capacity will not be built
in the US in the foreseeable future. Obviously the economy needs to improve,
but before the economic recession hit,
many ethylene producers that were leveraged to heavy liquid feedstocks were
examining ways to access and crack
more ethane at their facilities.

ethylene industry could increase ethane

cracking capability by another 50,000
to 75,000 b/d at existing plants, but
several obstacles remain:
• Some heavy-feed crackers are
isolated from large ethane distribution
systems. Additional ethane distribution
pipelines are needed to access these
ethylene plants. Midstream companies
are reluctant, however, to bear the full
risk in building more logistics to handle
ethane without the ethylene producer
guaranteeing a minimum throughput.
A key point to remember is that
ethylene producers will always have the
option to crack more or less ethane,
depending on feedstock economics at
any given time. Gas processors and NGL
midstream players, on the other hand,
are making the commitment to extract
and distribute the ethane.
• Maximizing ethane cracking at
some heavy-feed ethylene plants may
require investments to retool the plants’
process equipment to handle a product
stream richer in ethylene and lighter
hydrocarbons. There is the problem that
if more ethane is cracked, coproduct
production could suffer, and petrochemical companies will need to find
ways to meet downstream coproduct
requirements.
48

Additionally, the economic slowdown plus more ethylene plants worldwide could dampen a petrochemical
company’s enthusiasm to make investments to access and handle more
ethane.
• Most importantly, ethylene
producers need to be convinced that
ethane supplies will be reliable over
the long-term. Historically, the nation’s
petrochemical industry has always been
skeptical of the long-term viability and
competitive pricing of natural gas resources and hence NGLs in the US.
It will take a continuous effort by gas
producers, processors, and NGL midstream players to assure the petrochemical industry that natural gas reserves,
production, and NGLs are sustainable
over the long haul.
Undoubtedly, the severity of the current economic recession is distorting
the supply and demand for ethane, but
when the recession is over, the prospects for an ethane extraction overhang
remain. Gas processors that have made
investments in extracting ethane could
continue to see marginal returns.
It will require the ethylene industry
to make a concerted effort to increase
its ethane cracking capability. If the

ethylene industry responds, there are
unique opportunities for integrated
midstream players to expand and grow,
which could ultimately help independent processors. More NGLs require
more NGL take-away capacity, greater
need for full fractionation, particularly in Mont Belvieu, and additional
distribution pipelines to deliver ethane
to ethylene plants that lack sufficient
access to ethane.

Observations
The US gas processing industry has
always been focused on serving the
natural gas producer either extracting
as much value out of the natural gas
stream or conditioning the gas. Gas
processors have always assumed that
NGL markets would be sufficient, and it
would have been unusual for a cryogenic processing plant to be built for the
sole purpose of serving the petrochemical market for ethane.
The current economic recession
has painfully reminded gas producers
and gas processors that the economic
viability of any processing plant that
maximizes ethane recovery is intricately
tied to the health and actions of the US

petrochemical industry.
The problem is that the US petrochemical industry is unlikely to expand
ethylene capacity in the foreseeable future and the recent recession has actually caused the industry to contract. More
gas processing capacity coming online
will prolong the ethane extraction
overhang, and all participants involved
in gas processing and the handling of
NGLs will need to prepare for a greater
frequency of marginal ethane extraction
economics and lower recoveries even
when the economy improves.
Gas producers and processors need
to take an active role in promoting the
long-term availability of natural gas and
ethane in the US because greater cooperation and sharing of economic risks
between midstream and petrochemical
companies are required to increase the
capability to crack more ethane at existing ethylene facilities.
For petrochemical companies, this
is a unique opportunity to increase
feedstock choice by taking advantage of
ethane’s growing availability and lower
valuation relative to competing feedstocks.
In the meantime, individual processors looking to build that next cryogenic processing plant must carefully assess
their competitive positions against
more integrated midstream players, the
market’s need for more ethane, and the
relative value for the incremental ethane
barrel. No longer can the ethane market
be taken for granted by the gas processing industry. ✦

oil and gas industry business to Dubai.
Albrecht Ferling, managing director,
worldwide oil and gas industries, previously directed the company’s oil and gas
unit from Vienna. He cited Dubai’s central
location in light of growing energy demand from China, India, and the Middle
East and the shift of power from consumer
to producer in the global energy equation
among reasons for the move.
Microsoft, the worldwide leader in software and related services, has oil and gas
initiatives in more than 70 countries.

McJunkin Red Man Corp.,

Petrobras gives torpedo pile rights to Louisiana ﬁrm
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Rio de Janeiro,
has granted torpedo pile technology rights
to InterMoor Inc., Amelia, La., which becomes an exclusive licensee of Petrobras’s
torpedo pile technology in the US.
Torpedo piles typically range in sizes of
24-98 tonnes. The largest one can provide
anchor-holding capacity of as much as
1,000 tonnes. In the past 8 years, Petrobras
has successfully installed more than 1,000
torpedo piles—essentially gravity-embedded cylindrically shaped projectiles—to
anchor deepwater flowlines and facilities
off Brazil.
InterMoor said it looks forward to
extending the technology to the Gulf of
Mexico and other US waters.

New quarter turn valve actuator
The new Limitorque QX valve actuator has been added to a family of elec-

tronic actuators. The QX is a quarter-turn,
smart electronic valve actuator designed
to enhance safety and reduce downtime
through improved diagnostics, built-in
self-test features, and LimiGard fault protection capabilities. The QX complements
the nonintrusive multiturn Limitorque MX
actuator by including a patent-pending
absolute encoder, which tracks position
without the use of batteries.
The new actuator uses brushless DC
motors, which eliminate sparks, reduces
mechanical and electrical noise, and dissipates heat better than DC motors with
brushes, the firm says. The company adds
that its brushless-actuator design lasts longer than conventional motors and allows
for more accurate positioning.
Units are available for optional multiturn functionality. Suited for extreme
and harsh environments, the actuators are
powder-coated in a polyester resin. The
actuators are double-sealed, containing any
leakage within a separate terminal com-

partment, and include solid-state components.
The QX features an easy-to-read LCD
screen control panel, which can be rotated
180°. Available in 10 languages including
English, Spanish, French, Italian, German,
Portuguese, Japanese (Katakana), Mandarin, Russian, and Malay, the panel supports
diagnostic graphs for clear data analysis
and collection.
The company introduced absolute
encoder technology for smart actuators in
the Limitorque MX. An absolute encoder
helps simplify valve automation through
configuration and setup, normal operations, diagnostics, and troubleshooting.
The QX encoder employs system-onchip technology, which uses a pair of
contactless magnets that excite Hall-effect
devices and provide redundant, 12-bit
resolution over 360°.

PennEnergy Webcast Presentation

Storage Requirements
for Exploration Acquisition, Processing, and Interpretation
Abstract: Increasingly, the demands of accelerated exploration for new energy resources are
placing a burden on supporting IT infrastructures. The data intensive processes represented
by acquisition, processing and interpretation workflows now require that storage infrastructures are optimized for high volume, seismic data acquisition, the production of higher quality
data sets in less time, and improved G&G staff productivity during interpretation.
During the course of this 30 minute webinar, Richard Ameen will highlight the specific requirements of data storage as related to each phase of the Exploration process. Emphasis will be
placed on application workflows, infrastructure characteristics and best practices associated
with establishing field viability.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Supply, oil use
trends reshape
future of reﬁning
Growth in production of light hydrocarbons combines with shifting patterns of
oil consumption and new transportation
options to reshape the reﬁning industry’s
future.
Rising production of biofuels, especially
ethanol, receives much public attention
because of the international political push
for petroleum substitutes produced from
renewable materials.

P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Less noticed but volumetrically more
important is rapid growth in supply of natural gas liquids, especially from members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. The International Energy Agency
expects NGL supply from OPEC producers
this year to average 5 million b/d. That’s
down by 600,000 b/d from what IEA was
projecting for the year at the end of 2008
due to project delays and cuts in production of associated gas.
But it’s still 1.5 million b/d above OPEC’s
NGL production at the start of this decade
and, coupled with condensates, biofuels,
liquids from coal and natural gas, and
NGLs from outside OPEC, an important and
growing segment of total liquids supply.
Light hydrocarbon liquids are not, however,
the same as crude oil. Unless blended with
crude, they don’t normally charge reﬁnery
stills. And they mostly yield gasoline.
James Burkhard, managing director of
the Cambridge Energy Research Associates
(CERA) Global Oil Group, sees in these distinctions major implications for reﬁners.
At CERA’s annual energy conference in
Houston, Burkhard predicted that production of light hydrocarbons will grow while
that of crude oil ﬂattens. The trend will
raise supply of gasoline. Demand growth,
though, will be stronger for middle distillates, which still require crude.
Over time, therefore, Burkhard sees
margin strength for distillate and the opposite for gasoline. And he expects reﬁning
investments to focus more on conversion
and less on crude capacities.
Furthermore, he told the CERA conference, hydrocarbons might not account for
as much of future transport fuel supply as
generally is believed. The mobility needs of
people in populous, developing countries
might instead be met by mass-produced,
low-cost, light electric vehicles likely to
emerge in the next 10 years.
Citing forecasts that the industry will
have to supply 120-130 million b/d of oil by
2030, Burkhard said, “We frankly may not
need it.”

WTI, Brent spread widens
Front-month oil prices fell in mid-February to the lowest closing since late December on the New York Mercantile Exchange but at the same time increased on IntercontinentalExchange futures in Europe, widening the spread between West Texas
Intermediate and North Sea Brent.
The March contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes dropped to $33.98/bbl
Feb. 12 on NYMEX, while the April contract declined to $42.17/bbl. In London the
March IPE contract for North Sea Brent crude increased to $44.65/bbl.
Analysts on both sides of the Atlantic noted the $10/bbl spread between the two
crudes and the $8/bbl spread between the March-April NYMEX contracts, increasing
the contango in that market while the Brent contango narrowed to less than $1.50/
bbl.
“The differential between WTI and carrots is currently as well deﬁned by arbitrage
as is the WTI-Brent differential,” said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc. The two
price spreads along with premiums commanded by Gulf Coast crudes over WTI “are
all strong indications that WTI is not currently even a good benchmark for the totality
of the US market, let alone the global market,” he said.
Lower NYMEX prices were largely the result of a record 34.9 million bbl of crude
in storage at the Cushing, Okla., delivery point. It is likely to test its maximum capacity estimated at 37-39 million bbl.
Meanwhile, Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC, predicted WTI will average $43/bbl in 2009 with Brent at $45/bbl. He said “A
sharp recovery in oil prices toward $80/bbl in 2011 is possible, but dependent on a
strong economic revival starting in 2010.” However, he said odds favor a prolonged
period of sluggish economic growth.
John Waterlow, principal demand analyst for Wood Mackenzie Ltd., Edinburgh,
reported, “The outlook for oil demand over the next couple of years is the weakest
we have seen for decades.” WoodMac predicted global gross domestic product will
contract by 0.6% in 2009, leading to lower global oil demand of 84.3 million b/d,
down 1.5 million b/d from 2008. It is forecasting “a deeper and longer recession”
lasting far into 2010.
US oil demand is expected to fall by 700,000 b/d in 2009. “We anticipate the
recession will be longer and deeper than previous estimates as the crisis worsens.
We believe that the chances of anything more than a very slight recovery in 2010 are
remote,” WoodMac analysts said.
They said European economies are among the most seriously affected by the
global ﬁnancial crisis and declines in oil demand will be much more apparent in
2009 and 2010. “With a contraction in average European GDP of 2.3% in 2009 and
an even larger fall in the large, mature economies, we now expect oil demand to be
15.3 million b/d in 2009, equating to a fall of 3.9%, while demand in 2010 is forecast
at 15.0 million b/d, a further drop of 2.2%.”
Government stimulus
The market’s negative reaction to “a less than fully developed and inadequately
funded [US] ﬁnancial rescue plan” is a clear indication of the extent to which recovery is tied to progress in ﬁxing a dysfunctional ﬁnancial sector,” Sieminski said. “As
we see it, governments will need to marshal considerably more resources than are
politically palatable currently to deal effectively with the current crisis. A growing
likelihood that they will fail to do so soon points to a slow and bumpy ride ahead.”
He predicted, “A potential series of ﬁscal stimulus packages will be confronted by
ongoing ﬁerce ﬁnancial headwinds. We now expect average global growth to fall by
0.2% in 2009, with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
nations plummeting 2.7%, and the non-OECD countries growing at only about 3.4%.
WoodMac reported, “The initial wave of stimulus packages do not appear to
be sufﬁcient to offset contraction in growth this year. With the exception of India
and Brazil, virtually all countries are experiencing either an outright recession or a
growth recession. The rapid deterioration in growth in China coupled with further
contraction in industrial output in Japan have meant that the Asian ‘tigers’ have
been unable to quarantine their economies from the ﬁnancial crisis.”
Sieminski said, “Despite the unrelenting market focus on demand at this point,
concerns about the impact of low prices on the oil supply outlook are growing. We
see non-OPEC supplies falling by 200,000 b/d in 2009, but with world gross domestic
product growth likely to be negative, demand estimates continue to fall faster than
supply forecasts, keeping pressure on OPEC to cut quotas at least one more time.”

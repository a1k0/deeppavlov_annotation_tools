The CO2 injection header is in Wyoming’s Beaver Creek field.
Devon Energy Corp. started injecting CO2 in July 2008 for
enhancing oil production from the field’s Madison limestone-dolomite formation. By mid-2009, oil production from the Madison
had increased to 1,200 b/d compared with 320 b/d before CO2
injection.The photo above shows the field’s CO2 recycle compression.The petroleum industry’s long history of successful CO2-EOR
operations can make substantial contributions to improve and
accelerate deployment of carbon capture and storage projects. For
instance, industry has developed sophisticated technologies for oil
and gas operations that can be applied to CO2 storage integrity as
discussed in the first article in OGJ’s special report—CO2: EOR
and Sequestration—starting on p. 20. A second article, p. 41,
discusses the likelihood of more CO2-EOR projects starting as new
CO2 supplies become available. Photos from Devon Energy.

Utility groups urge derivatives-reform caution

Russia, EU sign warning pact on disruptions

Three trade associations representing natural gas and electric
utilities urged leaders of two US Senate committees considering
over-the-counter derivatives reform to not unwittingly cut utilities off from critical financial markets.
American Gas Association Pres. David N. Parker, Edison Electric
Institute Pres. Thomas R. Kuhn, and Electric Power Supply Association Pres. John E. Shelk said in a Nov. 23 letter to leaders of the
Senate Agriculture and Banking committees that utilities use OTC
derivatives to hedge against price volatility.
Seventy of the associations’ member companies also signed the
letter to Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), who chairs the Banking
Committee, and Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), its ranking minority
member; and Blanche L. Lincoln (D-Ark.), who chairs the Agriculture Committee, and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), its ranking minority member.
The trade associations said their members do not contribute to
overall systemic risk and should not be considered swap dealers
or major system participants, which some members of Congress
believe need to be more closely regulated. Independent oil and
gas producers have made a similar argument to federal lawmakers
considering commodities reforms.
AGA, EEI, and EPSA member companies rely on OTC derivatives to hedge prices and keep retail prices affordable, the association executives said in their letter. “When discussing any increased regulation of exchange and OTC derivatives markets, it is
important to note that these transactions are not the source of systemic risk in the broader economy,” they said. “In fact, the entire
commodity market is less than 1% of the global OTC derivative
market, and the energy commodity portion is yet a fraction of that
1%.” The associations support the clearing of standardized derivatives between large financial dealers, where appropriate, through
regulated central counterparties. But they oppose mandates that
would require all or most OTC transactions be centrally cleared or
executed on exchanges.
The associations also said they support increased authority of
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to prevent market
manipulation. But they said this could be accomplished more effectively and at a lower cost through mechanisms such as a central
data repository than through mandatory clearing.

Russia’s Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko and European Union
Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs have signed an agreement
for an early warning of future disruptions of Russian gas supplies
to the EU.
Under the agreement, Russia must notify the EU of any supply
interruption whether due to maintenance, accidents, or commercial disputes. It covers gas, oil, and electricity. Third parties would
be allowed to take part in the early-warning arrangement.
Shmatko said the agreement is not directed against Ukraine or
any other transit countries and does not involve sanctions against
them. He also said Russia would be signing a new agreement with
Ukraine for bilateral cooperation and also indicated Russia would
take part in upgrading Ukraine’s pipelines.

Group pushes electric vehicles to cut oil use
A group of corporate chief executives has formed to promote
cuts in US oil use through expansion of the electric-powered vehicle fleet.
The Electrification Coalition, Washington, DC, has published a
plan to reduce oil consumption in the light-duty vehicle fleet to 2
million b/d in 2040 from 8.6 million b/d currently.
Its goal: that 75% of light-duty vehicle-miles traveled in that
year be powered by electricity. “So long as the cars and trucks that
power our economy are dependent on a single-fuel source, the
majority of which is produced in hostile nations and unstable regions of the world and the price of which is increasingly volatile,
our economy is at the mercy of events and actors largely beyond
our control,” the report’s executive summary says.
At the center of the group’s strategy is “an ambitious federal
initiative to establish electrification ecosystems in a number of
American cities” to support deployment of grid-enabled vehicles
(GEVs), which are hybrids or fully electric vehicles able to recharge directly from the power grid. The group seeks deployment
of 700,000 GEVs in 6-8 cities during 2010-13 and 7 million GEVs
in those and 20-25 other cities by 2018.
The 180-page report assumes a large role for the federal government. Among its policy recommendations are new or expanded tax breaks for electric-vehicle purchases, public charging
equipment, and investments by utilities and power aggregators in
information-technology upgrades. ✦

“The region is eligible to compose the areas that will be the
object of the Transfer of Rights with Compensation, once the Bill
No. 5941/09 has been approved,” the Petrobras announcement
said. “The intention is to get stratigraphic information to create a
better geologic knowledge of the area and the basis to the future
development of the area.”
A Petrobras-operated group drilled the 2008 Iara oil discovery
in 7,314 ft of water 143 miles south of Rio de Janeiro and detected
30° gravity oil on a wire line test at 18,368 ft. The company has
attributed 3-4 billion bbl recoverable to the Iara find, in which BG
Group and Portugal’s Galp Energia were partners.
Iara lies just northeast of Tupi, largest of the Santos presalt discoveries, to which Petrobras attributes 5-8 billion boe recoverable.

Hess gauges gas-condensate find off Libya
Hess Corp.’s Libyan subsidiary has drillstem-tested gas and
condensate at a discovery well it drilled in 2008 in the Mediterranean east of Tripoli, Libya.
The A1-54/01 discovery well on the Arous Al-Bahar prospect
encountered hydrocarbons in several intervals with a combined
gross section of 500 ft in 2008 (OGJ Online, Dec. 17, 2008). Hess
reentered the well and perforated a 300-ft carbonate interval.
The well, in the nonproducing offshore extension of the Sirte
basin, flowed at a rate of 27 MMscfd of good quality gas and 533
b/d of condensate on a 52⁄64-in. choke on a drillstem test.
After completing tests, the Stena Forth sixth-generation dynamically positioned drillship is slated to return to finish drilling
the A2-54/01 appraisal well 7 miles northwest of the discovery
well.
Well A1-54/01 is in 2,807 ft of water 35 miles off Libya. Hess
Libya Exploration Ltd. holds 100% working interest in Area 54,
operated under an exploration and production-sharing agreement
with Libya’s National Oil Corp.

Origin Energy confirms extension off Tasmania
Origin Energy Ltd., Sydney, has confirmed an extension to the

Tasmania with success at Trefoil-2 appraisal.
The company says several gas-bearing sands were intersected

within the Eastern View Coal Measures and these will be analyzed
more fully over the next few weeks using cores, wireline logs,
reservoir pressure readings, and well samples.
The well has confirmed the continuity of the reservoir sands
between the Trefoil-1 discovery and the Trefoil-2 well. The size of
the resource will be determined when all the new data has been
evaluated.
The Kan Tan IV semisubmersible rig is now moving to drill the
Rockhopper-1 wildcat about 12 km to the north.
Both Trefoil and Rockhopper are close to the company’s producing Yolla gas-condensate field.
Origin is operator with 39%. AWE Ltd., Sydney, has 47.5% and
Innamincka Petroleum Ltd., Brisbane, has 5%.

Repsol YPF may join search effort off Guinea
Repsol YPF SA signed agreements with Hyperdynamics Corp.,
Sugar Land, Tex., under which the Spanish company may become
operator with 37% interest in an exploration concession held by
Hyperdynamics off Guinea, West Africa.
A letter of intent (LOI) gives Repsol YPF exclusive negotiating
rights to take the 37% stake for $31.5 million. Becoming operator
is subject to government and third-party approvals and consents.
The two companies will work to sign definitive documents by
Jan. 31, 2010, or the letter of intent terminates unless extended by
both parties.
Before signing definitive documents, Repsol YPF has the right
to participate with Hyperdynamics in evaluating geological and
geophysical data, subject to licensing obligations with various
seismic contractors. It also has the right to participate in the preparation for negotiations with Guinea’s Ministry of Mines, Energy
and Hydraulics regarding the terms of the clarification of the production sharing contract.
The letter of intent with Repsol YPF satisfies the clause in Hyperdynamics’ existing LOI with Dana Petroleum PLC that envisioned Dana’s option right to take up to an additional 27% of the
concession if Hyperdynamics did not secure the participation of a
major oil company by Nov. 30.
Hyperdynamics noted that Dana has made discoveries off Morocco and Mauritania. Repsol YPF is a partner with Anadarko Petroleum Corp. in the Upper Cretaceous Venus discovery off Sierra
Leone. ✦

Valero to close Delaware City refinery
Valero Energy Corp., San Antonio, will permanently close its
210,000-b/d Delaware City, Del., refinery, citing financial losses
caused by “very poor economic conditions, significant capital
spending requirements, and high operating costs.”
The announcement continued, “A safe and orderly shutdown
of the refinery will commence immediately.”
The shutdown will affect about 550 refinery employees. Valero
notified employees Nov. 20 and said it will begin negotiating immediately with refinery unions regarding the effects of the plant
closure and the employees’ severance packages.
In the fourth quarter, the company will report a pretax charge
of $1.7-1.8 billion, related primarily to “asset impairment,” employee severance, and other shutdown costs.
Valero estimates the shutdown will reduce pretax operating expenses by about $450 million in 2010, including $125 million of
noncash costs, and will reduce capital spending and turnaround
costs by about $200 million through 2010.
In addition, the company expects to receive aftertax cash flows
in 2010 of $600-700 million from inventory sales, “assuming
current prices and other cash benefits from discontinued operations.”
Valero Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Klesse said
the decision to close the refinery was “very difficult,” adding, “…
We have spent the last year diligently trying to avoid this situation.”

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
Klesse noted that earlier this fall, Valero shut down the refinery’s gasifier and coking operations to improve reliability and financial performance (OGJ, Sept. 14, 2009, p. 10). But “the refinery’s profitability did not improve enough,” he said.
In addition, Valero sought a buyer for the refinery, but “feasible
opportunities have not materialized,” adding, “At this point, we
have exhausted all viable options.”
The announcement said, “Valero remains committed to its
marketing businesses in the Northeast and will continue to reliably supply its customers, partially through higher throughput
rates at the company’s other refineries.”

Silver Eagle shutters Utah refinery
Silver Eagle Refining Inc. has shut down its 12,500 b/cd Woods
Cross refinery in Utah on the suggestion of the US Chemical Safety Board and state officials.
CSB investigators found widespread safety problems at the refinery following a Nov. 4 in the plant’s diesel unit. No one was
injured and the fire was quickly contained.
CSB Chairman John S. Bresland said he asked on Nov. 13 that
the refinery be shut down, and Silver Eagle executives ”responded
rapidly and positively” to the suggestion.
“The CSB team has developed a number of serious concerns
about the integrity of the piping and equipment at various locations in the plant,” Bresland said.
Bresland said he asked for the refinery to be shut down tempoOil & Gas Journal / Dec. 7, 2009

rarily to correct potentially serious safety problems.
“This decision will obviously cost Silver Eagle some revenue in
the short run, but I believe it is the right action to protect the long
term interests of the company, its workforce, and the community
which gives it license to operate,” Bresland said.
The Nov. 4 accident was the second accident at the plant to be
investigated this year. CSB already investigated a Jan. 12 fire in
an atmospheric storage tank that seriously burned two employees
and two contract workers.

The project boosted paraxylene capacity by 25% to 700,000
tonnes/year and benezene capacity by 20% to 830,000 tonnes/
year.
The plant, owned and operated by ExxonMobil Chemical Holland BV, is now ExxonMobil’s largest paraxylene production facility. The new unit uses proprietary ExxonMobil technology called
PxMax. ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Haynesville operator to expand gathering
Regency Energy Partners LP, Dallas, will build Phase 2 in its
expansion of the Logansport gathering system in North Louisiana,
the company announced last week. Construction will begin early
next month and target second-quarter 2010 for completion.
The $40 million expansion will move gas gathered from production in DeSoto Parish, La., to Regency’s gathering system. The
project also includes construction of an associated amine treating
plant.
Regency will install 4.5 miles of 10-in. OD gathering lines,
route 7.5 miles of 12-in. OD pipe through more than 17 sections of
dedicated acreage in DeSoto Parish, and will add 3.2 miles of 24in. OD pipe to connect into Regency’s 24-in. Logansport Phase 1
expansion. The company will also install a gas-treating plant with
inlet capacity of up to 300 MMcfd. In addition to the Phase 2 project, Regency will increase to 24 in. OD the previously announced
20-in. OD, 17-mile Logansport expansion. That project will interconnect with CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission’s Line CP.
Regency’s Logansport system will then accommodate 450-485
MMcfd, said the company announcement, along the corridor that
crosses the Gulf South East Texas lateral, as well as the proposed
Energy Transfer Tiger Pipeline (OGJ, Nov. 2, 2009, p. 11).
Regency is also in the process of increasing the Logansport
system’s incremental interconnect delivery capacities to Tennessee
Gas Pipeline and to Louisiana Intrastate Gas by about 100 MMcfd
and 30 MMcfd, respectively. In September, Regency along with
Alinda Capital Partners LLC and GE Energy Financial Services announced plans to build a $47 million pipeline extension of the
Haynesville expansion North Louisiana to increase capacity on the
Regency Intrastate Gas System.
The extension—called the Red River lateral—is adding about
100,000 MMbtu/day of capacity to the Haynesville expansion,
bringing total project capacity to about 1.2 bcfd (OGJ Online, Oct.
28, 2009).

FERC approves Northwest’s Piceance expansion
The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has issued a
certificate to Northwest Pipeline GP, a majority owned subsidiary
of Williams Cos. Inc., approving construction and operation of
15.5 miles of 30-in. OD mainline loop to bring additional natural
gas from Piceance basin to the hub in Opal, Wyo.
The Sundance Trail Expansion will provide 150 MMcfd firm
transportation capacity from the Greasewood and Meeker-White

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

River hubs in Rio Blanco County, Colo., to the Opal hub area in
Lincoln County, Wyo. At the Opal hub, producers have access to
six interstate pipelines, including Northwest, Williams said.
The project will also replace and enhance Northwest’s compression facilities at the Vernal compressor station in Uintah
County, Utah. Northwest’s main line is connected to the Piceance
at the Greasewood hub through its Piceance lateral and the Meeker-White River hubs through Northwest’s new Colorado Hub Connection pipeline and related facilities.
Williams began operations Aug. 7 at its 450-MMcfd Willow
Creek gas processing plant in the Piceance basin. The Willow
Creek plant is currently recovering about 20,000 b/d of natural
gas liquids (OGJ, Nov. 16, 2009, p. 21).
Williams Pipeline Partners LP owns a 35% interest in Northwest.

Petrobras opens Urucu-Coari-Manaus line
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) began commercial operations on its Urucu-Coari-Manaus natural gas pipeline Nov. 27. The
661-km pipeline is part of Brazil’s Growth Acceleration Program
and includes seven branches totaling an additional 140 km, bringing gas from Brazil’s Amazonian Solimoes basin to market. Branch
lines extend from the trunk to Coari, Codajas, Anori, Anama, Caapiranga, Manacapuru, and Iranduba.
The Transpetro-operated pipeline’s initial capacity measures
4.1 million cu m/day. Installation of two compressions stations
between Urucu and Coari will increase the line’s capacity to the
contracted 5.5 million cu m/day by September 2010 when conversion of the associated power plants from fuel oil has occurred. Of
the 5.5 million cu m/day, Petrobas says 5 million will supply the
thermal market with the remaining 0.5 will go to industrial, commercial, residential, and vehicular customers.
The 196-km section between Coari and Anama encompasses
the pipeline’s longest course of flood areas. Some 6,000 floats and
barrels helped support the line, with helicopters transporting individual section weighing 4.5 tons each, and 19 directional hiles
drilled under river beds
The Urucu-Coari section uses 279 km of newbuild 10-in. OD
pipeline to transport LPG, with the existing 8-in LPG line converted to natural gas transport. The 196-km Coari-Anama section includes a 20-in OD newbuild gas pipeline. The final 186-km stretch
from Anama to Manaus includes the largest number of communities along the line, 135. ✦

importantly, weak coking unit throughputs—demonstrate a response to weak
distillate markets and the narrowing
of heavy sour crude discounts. This
suggests that refiners are adapting to
current market circumstances.
There have also been big changes in
global crude flows that have impacted
refiners. US imports of crude from
Saudi Arabia have dropped to about
700,000 b/d from about 1.5 million
b/d, while imports of crude from
Mexico fell to about 1 million b/d in
August from a 5-year average of 1.6
million b/d.
Imports from Canada have increased, and refiners have had to adapt
to new crudes that have offset some
of the large declines in imports from
Saudi Arabia and Mexico.
In addition, there have been changes
in fuel oil markets resulting from
narrower fuel oil cracks. IEA noted
three important changes. First, fuel
oil yields in the OECD have climbed,
suggesting that refineries are responding to shifting product cracks. Second,
above-average fuel oil exports from the
former Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia
may help restore typical fuel oil discounts, although this may be hampered
by the rise in the volume of condensate
produced.
The third change in the fuel oil market IEA cites is the start of long-term
or permanent refinery closures, which
will ring in a new normal state for the
refining industry.
IEA said capacity rationalization will
accelerate as uncompetitive capacity
is marginalized and shut down. The
industry is struggling with persistently
weak profits, and while the initial
changes are encouraging, more must be
done. ✦

Exhibit Today
Expanding Sustainably
Growth requires the oil sands and heavy oil industry to make steady, long-term
progress along a narrow road for which no map exists.
On one side loom the high costs of extracting, processing, and transporting
unconventional hydrocarbons.
On the other side are environmental performance standards that toughen with
time and that the industry never must fail to meet.
Each step along this road requires innovation. Each must withstand
unpredictable economic changes. Each must uphold eternal values of nature
and society.

On this road, the beacon for progress is technology, advances in which will
control the costs, improve the environmental performance, and assure the
sustainability of an industry crucial to oil supplies – now and in the future.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the
premier showcase for the knowledge and methods of this fascinating business.
Take this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential
audience. Join PennWell Petroleum Events in this fourth year conference and

The purloined e-mails
What happens now that scandal clouds the scientific basis for worry about climate change?
Naturally, claims have arisen that incriminating
e-mails to and from the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit in the UK were taken out of context. Already, sympathizers say the messages should
be ignored because they came to light through the
wicked intrusions of a computer hacker.
Contexts, however, are clear enough. And, the
messages can’t be ignored, whatever routes they
followed into the public domain. They came from
scientists central to the international campaign for
sacrificial remedies against global warming of human origin. And they show those scientists discussing the manipulation, even destruction, of data and
the stifling of dissent.

Note also that RP 65 effectively
deals with preventing methane migration, which is much more difficult to
prevent than CO2 migration. This is
because methane is an inert gas with
more buoyancy than chemical reactive

• The IEA GHG R&D Program’s
Monitoring Network reported on soil
gas sampling measurements at the
Rangely field CO2 EOR project and
concluded that the total amount of CO2
leakage from the EOR zone was less
than 0.01% over 15 years of CO2 EOR
operation. The IEA report also stated
that there is no evidence of CO2 leakage
from the storage reservoir at other CCS
projects including Weyburn, Frio, and
Sleipner.
• Smyth et al.3 at BEG/UT is evaluating CO2 containment at the SACROC
CO2 EOR project. Smyth et al.3 has
reported that water sample testing from
68 wells and one spring indicate that
no CO2 leakage from the EOR zone
into the USDW zones in the field has
occurred after 35 years of CO2 injection
operations.
• Finally CCP has been studying the
effects of CO2 on well integrity via a
wellbore sampling and laboratory analysis program under way since 2006.

The former StatoilHydro then joined
the JV at production startup in August
2004. The investors derive no commercial benefit from the CO2 storage at In
Salah, so it is being used as an experimental and demonstration project to
learn about CO2 geological storage in
deep saline formations.
The injection formation (Fig. 3) is a
20-m thick Carboniferous sandstone,
1,900 m below ground with around
15% porosity and 10 md permeability.
Three state-of-the-art horizontal CO2
injection wells were drilled perpendicular to the stress field, and therefore
the dominant fracture orientation, to
maximize the injection capacity.
By the end of 2008, over 2.5 million
tonnes of CO2 had been stored underground. A Joint Industry Project (JIP)
was set up to monitor the CO2 storage
using a variety of geochemical, geophysical, and production techniques
over an initial 5-year period.

In Salah monitoring results
Monitoring data include geological,
geochemical, geophysical, and satellite
data.
Standard oil industry geological characterization data have been
acquired, including wireline and LWD
well logging suites, core sampling, and
3D seismic. Geochemical monitoring
data collected to date include surface
and soil gas monitoring, downhole gas
measurements (head gas and isotubes
samples), and production monitoring.
Different tracer chemicals (perfluorocarbons) have been used to “tag” the
CO2 injected at each injection well so
that any CO2 detected can be differentiated from the natural CO2 in the subsurface and traced back to an individual
injection well. Geophysical monitoring
data will gain momentum in 2009
with the deployment of a downhole
geophone detector string in a dedicated
well to monitor microseismic events
and the first time-lapse 3D seismic survey to monitor saturation and pressure
changes.

far has been the use of satellite airborne
radar interferometry to detect subtle
ground deformation above the injection
wells.7
Permanent scatterer interferometry
is a multi-interferogram approach that
draws on the phase changes occurring
between a series of radar images and
is specifically designed to overcome
the effects of atmospheric noise and
thereby determine surface movement
histories over periods of several years.8
Permanent scatterer interferometry
gives an accuracy of around 5 mm/year
and up to 1 mm/year for a longer-term
average.
Surface uplift has been detected over
all three of the In Salah CO2 injection
wells9-11 with corresponding subsidence
also observed over the gas production
area. One of the first permanent scatterer interferometry datasets based on a
2-year time sequence of data9 shows the
observed surface uplift rate is around 5
mm/year.

Technology outpacing climatechange legislation, lawmakers say
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Technology is moving ahead more
quickly than legislation to address
global climate change, three federal
lawmakers agreed on Dec. 1. Congress
won’t be able to get back to work on
the issue until 2010, they added.
Bills approved by the full US House
and the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee haven’t answered
significant questions, US Sen. Byron
L. Dorgan (D-ND) and US Rep. Fred
Upton (R-Mich.) said during a forum on US climate and energy policy
cosponsored by Newsweek and the
American Petroleum Institute. But US
Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who
cosponsored the House bill, said the
measure was an important first step in
a long process.
“The measure is analogous to what
we did in telecommunications,” Markey said, noting that Congress passed

bills in 1992, 1993, and 1996 that
launched, respectively, the modern
cable, wireless, and broadband systems
while creating 2 million new jobs.
Emerging energy technologies could
lead to a $2 trillion domestic industry
if the US decided to actively support
them, Markey said. “We have a choice.
Right now, our energy strategy says
‘Made by [the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries].’ If we don’t
act, our new strategy will be to use
products made in China. We can decide
to release our own entrepreneurial
spirit instead,” he said.
The US Department of Energy has
what effectively is the largest energy
venture capital resource in history
with federal economic stimulus funds
it received to support new technology
research and development, according to
Dorgan. “I think there are unbelievably
exciting things going on that we don’t
fully understand yet, but that will help
us a lot,” he said.

Outside government
The private sector is moving ahead
too, other panelists said. US oil and
gas companies collectively spend three
times as much as the federal government in alternative and renewable
energy R&D, API Pres. Jack N. Gerard
said. US automakers plan to introduce
new models in the next few years,
including General Motors’ Chevy Volt,
which could drastically advance electric
hybrid technology late in 2010, Upton
pointed out.
The two climate bills currently
before Congress could jeopardize such
efforts and harm other US industries
during a significant economic recession, Gerard argued. “We need to reset
the discussion. The bill which passed
the House and the one which the Senate EPW committee approved kill jobs
and penalize specific industries,” he
said.
Upton said the bill that the House
passed by seven votes on June 26
did not contain enough protections
for businesses and consumers using
electricity generated from coal. “I’m
convinced that if we had the vote today,
it would go down by 50 votes,” he said,
adding that an energy bill which the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee approved by 15 to 8 votes
on June 17 was more balanced because
it was truly bipartisan.
The bill, the American Clean Energy
Leadership Act (S. 1462), has not been
brought to the floor, Dorgan confirmed, partly because of Senate Republicans’ efforts to block new legislation.
“We’re not getting bipartisan support

She said the Senate should explore
other options, including pairing
tax cuts with a price on emissions.
Murkowski emphasized that she isn’t
suggesting that any approach for
reducing emissions not be considered

that the congressional climate change
debate has become too narrow.

Shell executive: CCS technology use needs to quicken

As the United Nations Climate
Change Conference Dec. 7-18 in Copenhagen prepares to consider general
strategies, a Shell International Exploration & Production official continues to

ask practical questions about a specific
climate strategy: carbon capture and
storage.
“We think CCS has a great future.
We understand it, but its deployment
needs to be accelerated. Otherwise, it
will be too expensive to retrofit power
stations and large industrial facilities,”

John Barry, vice-president of unconventionals and enhanced oil recovery at
the Royal Dutch Shell PLC division, said

to loosen trapped oil is a good initial
demonstration of CCS technology, but
only represents 1-2% of the total storage necessary to meaningfully address
climate change.
It also has provided an early opportunity to examine practical aspects of
transporting as well as storing CO2, he
suggested. “Several thousand kilometers of CO2 pipelines exist because of
EOR. They could help as we try to store
manufactured CO2,” he said.
West Texas EOR operations, which
have used naturally occurring CO2
brought by the Cortez pipeline from
Colorado since 1983, work because the
formations are deep and the temperatures are cool, Barry said. “A few industrial companies are putting CO2 into
other pipelines, but they won’t handle
all that’s being produced,” he observed.

Shell and CCS
Shell has determined that its extensive oil and gas exploration and
production experience could help it
become a commercial CCS leader. It
believes that energy efficiency should
be the starting point for both existing
and new assets, but that CCS also will
be required. “We are not advocating it
as a substitute for wind and other alternative energy technologies,” said Barry,
who started his 27-year career at the
multinational oil company as a reservoir engineer. “They should be pursued
as aggressively as possible, but it will
take decades for their contributions to
become meaningful.”
Under one scenario, aggressive CCS
deployment could cut 100 ppm of CO2
emissions from projected 2010 levels,
he added.
Shell and other majors can bring
relevant skills to CCS development,
but governments also need to play a
strong leadership role, Barry said. They
can help by providing funding for
early demonstrations, developing legal
frameworks which address pore space
access and long-term liability questions, increasing public acceptance, and
reaching international agreements to
ensure CCS occurs outside industrially

FERC’s interstate
inquiry

T

he US Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission sent an important
signal Nov. 19 when it launched a
cost-recovery investigation of three
major interstate gas pipelines’ rates.
Analysts said the inquiry involving
Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
(NGPL), Northern Natural Gas Co.
(NNG), and Great Lakes Gas Transmission Co. was the first such move
by FERC in more than a decade. It
also was a result not of formally
filed complaints, but of FERC staff’s
analysis of data routinely submitted
by interstate pipelines.
FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff
explained that in March 2008, FERC
redesigned Form 2, on which the
information is submitted, “to better
facilitate the ability to make a meaningful assessment of the pipeline’s
cost of service and current rates.”
Pipelines filed the revised form
for the first time last April, and a
staff analysis found that the three
systems were recovering more costs
than FERC allows, he noted.

William F. Hederman, the former
founding director of FERC’s Market
Oversight and Investigations Office,
who now is a senior energy policy
research analyst at Concept Capital,
said, “Expediting also will be important to help investors get a handle of
the extent of regulatory uncertainty
this creates for pipelines.”
FERC’s decision to head down this
path is a significant policy change,
Hederman wrote Nov. 19. “The
extent to which it changes regulatory
risks remains to be seen. Nevertheless, it does appear, in our opinion,
likely to increase regulatory risks for
interstate gas pipelines,” he wrote.

Not insulated

This is particularly true for systems above NNG, which is No. 15 on
the Natural Gas Supply Association’s
list of “actual pipeline rate of return”
for a 5-year average ending in 2007,
Hederman said. Pipelines generally

“We think CCS has a great
future. We understand it,
but its deployment needs to
be accelerated. Otherwise,
it will be too expensive to

developed nations, he said.
“We need a global rollout, a mechanism where countries using marketbased processes have some allowances
for early projects,” Barry said. “There
are coalitions of the willing: smaller
groups of countries willing to set

T E R E S T
agreements, finding ways to link trading schemes. Somebody pays in the
end. The money isn’t magically created.
But you get people supporting the most
efficient CCS approaches. Politicians
like it because it doesn’t require new
taxes.”
Technical challenges include site
selection (“I’m not proposing anywhere
along the San Andreas Fault,” Barry
said), storage capacity, contaminants,
cost containment, and monitoring.
Public acceptance and establishing a
commercial framework are the chief
nontechnical challenges, he said.
Government policymakers should
also be prepared to look beyond coal,
he suggested. “To have a number in
mind, capturing carbon from refineries
and chemical plants could cost half as
much as from coal-fired power stations,” he said. Refineries and chemical
plants’ concentrated CO2 have more
early demonstration potential, according to Barry. “I see a whole lot of lowhanging fruit there,” he said.

Eight projects
Shell has eight CCS projects under
way, four of which are industrial scale.
Those include one which will take CO2
from the company’s Pernis refinery
and transport it by pipeline for storage
in two depleted natural gas fields near
Barendrecht in The Netherlands. The
Dutch government approved the proposed project on Nov. 19 despite local
opposition. Barry said that Karl-Heinz
Wolf, a civil engineering and geosci-

ences professor at Delft University of
Technology, was shocked when he was
heckled and called a traitor at a public
hearing earlier.
“With the benefit of hindsight,
we underestimated the potential for
misunderstanding there,” said Barry,
adding that CO2 already is piped into
many vegetable greenhouses. “Shell is
doing Barendrecht because it’s cheaper
to capture and store CO2 from the
Pernis refinery. The project’s total costs
per ton, with a small Dutch government subsidy, equal what we anticipate
European carbon costs will be.”
CCS costs will need to be competitive and not require government
subsidies once the technology is developed and deployed, he emphasized. “It
should cost less than carbon taxes once
enough projects have been rolled out,”
he said.
Governments also will need to
resolve the question of long-term liabilities, Barry maintained. “A company
like Shell is frightened to take on openended liabilities,” he said. “Operations
should be accountable during injection
and for a couple of years after. But it’s
more practical to have governments be
responsible beyond that time. Australia already has passed a law assuming
responsibility, and several European
countries are considering it.”
As for the UN climate change
conference in Copenhagen, Barry said
that he was optimistic that some space
for CCS to happen globally could be
opened. But he also was not prepared to
say how far the 170 countries attending
will go in explicitly endorsing it. ✦

Oil groups welcome delay of decision on ethanol limit
Oil industry groups welcomed a
Nov. 30 decision by the US Environmental Protection Agency to postpone a
decision on raising the amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline.
EPA told Growth Energy, a biofuels industry association, it would not
immediately act on the group’s March
28

request for a waiver raising the ethanol
ceiling to 15% from 10%.
The request came amid concerns
that the stagnant US fuel market might
not be able to absorb ethanol in the rising amounts mandated by Congress.
Automakers and manufacturers of
small engines have resisted the in-

crease, fearing engine damage, safety
compromises, and warranty complications.

The decision
In a letter to Growth Energy, EPA
said incomplete studies indicate fuel,
engine, and emissions-control systems

in gasoline vehicles made in model
years 2001 and later probably can
accommodate fuel containing 15%
ethanol (E15).
“However, we continue to evaluate
the question of component durability
when E15 is used over many thousands
of miles, and there is an ongoing study
being conducted by [the Department of
Energy] that will provide critical data
on this issue,” EPA said.
DOE expects next August to complete a test of 19 vehicles assessing
long-term emissions effects of higher
ethanol blends on newer vehicles, EPA
said.
DOE has data on two vehicles at
present and expects to complete testing
of 12 more vehicles by the end of May.
EPA thus expects to have much of the
data it needs for a decision by midJune.
“Should the test results remain supportive and provide the necessary basis,
we would be in a position to approve
E15 for 2001 and newer vehicles in the
midyear timeframe,” EPA said, adding
that the appearance of potential problems would further delay a decision
until all testing is complete.

Industry reaction
The American Petroleum Institute
called EPA’s decision “sound” but
expressed concern about the agency’s
willingness to consider a waiver for
part of the vehicle fleet.
“API is actively supporting the studies that are currently under way,” the
association said in a statement.
While ethanol and other renewable
fuels should help meet US energy demand, API said, “it’s important that the
short and long-term impacts of increasing the amount of ethanol blended into
motor fuels be evaluated on the full
vehicle fleet before a waiver decision is
made.”
National Petrochemical & Refining
Association Pres. Charles Drevna said
his group is “pleased” by EPA’s postponement of the decision.
“EPA correctly recognizes that there
is more study and comprehensive test-

ing to be done to ensure that higher
ethanol blends will be safe for consumers and not threaten the reliability of
their fuels or operation of their vehicles, engines, and outdoor equipment,”
Drevna said.
The ethanol industry took a different
view.
“This delay threatens to paralyze the

continued evolution of America’s ethanol industry,” said Bob Dinneen, president and chief executive officer of the
Renewable Fuels Association. He called
for immediate approval of intermediate
ethanol blends, such as 12%.
Dinneen called EPA’s apparent focus
on 2001 and newer vehicles “another
worrisome development.” ✦

Showdown
in Hormuz?

H

ere’s something that may alarm
the oil and gas industry: Iran
has given the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps command over naval
operations in the Persian Gulf and
Strait of Hormuz.
That’s according to a report by
the US Office of Naval Intelligence,
which says the Iranians have undertaken the move as of a strategy to
block international access to vital sea
lanes in the event of a war.
As a reminder, oil movements
through the strait account for 40% of
all seaborne oil traded in the world,
according to the US Energy Information Administration.
EIA also predicts that oil exports
passing through the strait will reach
30-34 million b/d by 2020 from the
current 15 million b/d.

also relies on the strait to transport
most of its oil exports, and that it
would incur risks by imposing a
blockade on the area.
“Closing the Strait of Hormuz
would cause Iran tremendous
economic damage, and therefore
Iran would probably not undertake
a closure lightly,” ONI said, adding
that “given the importance of the
strait, disrupting traffic flow or even
threatening to do so may be an effective tool for Iran.”

Contamination’s impact
Meanwhile, according to a recent
activist report, oil production in Block
5A—the very site of CNPC’s swap—is
contaminating water, spreading disease
to humans and cattle, and threatening
the world’s largest inland wetlands.
“Oil exploration and exploitation in
the oil fields of Mala and Thar Jath pose
serious threats to human beings, livestock, and the environment,” said Klaus
Stieglitz, vice-chairman of the German
NGO Sign of Hope.
Pointing to the central processing
facility at Thar Jath, Stieglitz said that
water flowing off the huge installation
was a major source of contamination.
“Waters found in drilling pits at
oil wells are another major source
of contamination. Contaminants of
both sources have already reached the
drinking-water layers,” he said.
Stieglitz cited the case of Rier, a
village close to the Thar Jath processing facility, where concentrations of
salts and contaminants such as cyanide,
lead, nickel, cadmium, and arsenic have
reached critical levels.
“The contamination has a serious
impact on the daily life of the local
population. In the village of Rier, the
inhabitants do not use the water coming from their boreholes,” he said.
“Locals who drink this kind of water
can get diarrhea and a subsequent
dehydration of the body, which might
lead to death if untreated,” Stieglitz
warned.
“The heavy-metal concentrations of
these waters will have a negative impact
on the health situation of the some
300,000 inhabitants of the affected
area, which covers 4,000 sq km,” said
Steiglitz, who urged WNPOC to treat
the plant’s water adequately and prevent
seepage.
“To secure public health, the government must also improve the quality
of drinking water dramatically and at
the same time prevent an ecological
catastrophe,” he said. ✦

GULF MARGINAL
PRODUCTION—1

L O P M E N T

Experts may disagree on when world
oil production will peak, but there is
general agreement that marginal fields
will contribute a greater percentage of
world supply in the future.
Each producing property is unique
and has costs and benefits specific to
each stage of its life cycle. As fields mature and operations transition into the

costs, and fewer upside opportunities
lead to declining profitability.
In this three-part series on marginal
production in the Gulf of Mexico, we
highlight the results of a recent Minerals Management Service study that
estimated the marginal production and
gross revenue streams associated with
the inventory of producing structures
circa January 2007.1
The cumulative hydrocarbon production from the inventory of producing
assets is estimated to be 1.056 billion bbl
of oil and 13.3 tcf of gas. Marginal production is expected to contribute 4.1% of
the total oil production and 5.4% of gas
production in the gulf.

market conditions.
Offshore production tends to be
more chaotic, and smoothly declining
profiles near the end of production are
not common, exacerbating the difficulty associated with forecasting abandonment. Mature structures produce
from a small number of wells, and if a
problem arises, it may not be economic
to perform a workover.
The application of secondary and enhanced oil recovery techniques is more

complex and subject to constraints
such as space and weight restrictions
and high transportation and operating
costs not found onshore. Secondary and
tertiary recovery techniques that are
commonly used to extend the production life of onshore assets are usually
not economic offshore.

Defining marginal production
Production characteristics and profitability change during the life cycle of

every structure.
Broadly speaking, the capital intensive expenditures associated with drilling wells and fabricating and installing
infrastructure and equipment during
the early years of a structure’s life cycle
are quickly replaced by revenue streams
that recover the investment within a
few years (Fig. 1).
There is nothing more profitable
than an oil or gas well, and most structures start out highly profitable, but af-

ter peak production, profitability tends
to decline as costs increase and revenue
decreases. At some point near the end
of a structure’s life, revenues approach
operating cost and the asset becomes
marginally profitable.
As reservoir pressure declines, the
cash flow generating ability of the
structure is replaced by a decreasing
revenue stream, higher operating costs,
fewer upside opportunities, and eventually, production that is worth less
than the cost to operate and maintain
the structure. At the end of the commercial life of a structure, the structure
is abandoned and decommissioned according to regulatory guidelines.

Marginal fields have different
economics than large fields, require
different recovery techniques, and are
produced by smaller companies, usually proprietorships, partnerships, and
limited liability companies. Production
is still commercial (or “economic”), but
the conditions under which a profit is
generated tend to be more restricted.
Marginal wells are often considered
to operate on the lower edge of profitability, but no single definition of what
constitutes a marginal well exists (Fig.
2). The dark arrow in Fig. 2 indicates
the time period when structures are
considered to enter their marginal
phase.
When does production turn marginal? Ideally, a marginal well should
be defined with respect to profitability,
or when the marginal cost of operation
equals the marginal revenue of production, but because cost is generally
unapparent to an outside observer, the
practical application of this definition
has significant shortfalls.
The next best alternative is to apply a
threshold to operationalize the definition of marginal production. Onshore
and in state waters, state and federal
regulations typically define marginal

threshold of 10-15 b/d of oil and-or 6090 Mcfd of gas. In federal waters, the
MMS defines a marginal well as producing less than 90 b/d or 540 Mcfd.

Active structure count
The number of active structures in
the gulf is shown in Fig. 3.
Active structures represent the total
number of structures that exist at any
point in time and include both pro-

ducing and nonproducing structures.
In December 2006, there were 3,838
active structures: 2,324 fixed platforms,
380 well protectors, 1,091 caissons, and
43 “other” structures which includes
deepwater floaters such as tension-leg
platforms and spars.
The number of removals began to
equal or exceed the number of installations in the early 1990s, and during
this time, the inventory of active structures began to stabilize. The number

exceeds the number of installations,
and will likely continue in the future,
as fewer new structures are installed
on the shelf and a larger number of
structures supporting marginal fields
are abandoned.
Deepwater structures do not contribute materially to the structure count.
The cumulative number of installed, removed, and active structures is shown
in Fig. 4.

Gas structures began to outnumber
oil structures in 1978 and currently
represent about 65% of the total inventory of producing structures. The sharp
decline in the number of producing
structures in 2006 is due to the impact
of the 2005 hurricane season: producing structures declined from 2,328 in
2005 to 2,017 in 2006. At the end of
2006, there were 813 oil producers and
1,204 gas producers in the gulf.

Producing structures

The number of nonproducing
structures is computed as the difference between the number of active and
producing structures. Nonproducers
include idle structures that once produced hydrocarbons as well as auxiliary
structures that serve in a support role
as a storage, compression, or metering
facility and have never produced.
The number of nonproducing structures is shown in aggregate and as a
percentage of the total number of active
structures (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the
number of idle structures has remained
around 40% of the inventory for the
last several decades. Before 1960, the
percentage of nonproducers appears
unusually high, but this may be due to
reporting problems and-or other data
integrity issues, or may simply be reflective of the immature state and small

The number of structures producing
hydrocarbons in the gulf is shown in
Fig. 5 classified according to primary
output.
A structure that produces any
amount of oil or gas in the year of
observation is said to be producing,
and the producing gas-oil ratio (GOR)
is used to classify structures as “oil” or
“gas” producers. A structure with GOR
<5,000 cu ft/bbl is labeled an oil structure and a gas structure corresponds to
GOR >5,000 cu ft/bbl.
A producing structure may stop production for a period of time, perhaps
due to hurricane damage or reservoir
problems, temporarily reducing the
producing structure count, only to
reenter the inventory at a later time.
Structures that are inactive for a few
years, however, are unlikely to reenter
the producing pool.

Nonproducing structures

Oil production from oil structures
and condensate production from gas
structures is shown in Fig. 7 on an annual and cumulative basis.
Dry and associated gas production is
shown in Fig. 8.
Oil structures produce the majority of liquid production with relatively
small amounts of condensate contributed by gas structures. Oil structures
produce a significant amount of associated gas, currently about a third of total
gas production in the gulf.

Oil producers
The number of oil structures categorized by production group is shown in
Fig. 9.
The number of oil structures across
each production category has remained
relatively stable over the past 2 decades.
The contribution to total oil production from low (<15 b/d), medium
(15-200 b/d), and high producer (>200
b/d) structures is shown in Fig. 10. The
15 BOPD class contribute less than 0.1%
total production on both an annual and
cumulative basis, with the 15-200 b/d
class contributing less than 3% (Fig. 11).
Similar trends can be expected in the
future.

Gas producers
The number of gas structures categorized according to daily gas production
is shown in Figs. 12 and 13.
The contribution to total oil production from low (<90 Mcfd), medium
(90-1,208 Mcfd), and high producer
(>1,208 Mcfd) groups is shown in Fig.
14.
High producer groups constitute
the majority of active gas structures
and contribute more than 95% of total
annual production and cumulative
production. The contribution to cumulative gas production from low producers contributes less than 3%. While
marginal producers account for about
4.6% of total active structures, their gas

The number of US
projects injecting carbon
dioxide for enhancing
oil recovery likely will
increase as new CO2 supplies become available.
Production
For example, in states
on the US Gulf Coast,
Denbury Resources Inc. continues to
add pipelines for distributing CO2 to
new fields.
Companies also have slated new
projects for the northern portion of
the Rocky Mountains and the Permian
basin of West Texas and New Mexico.
These projects will use new CO2
sources.
In Canada, Saskatchewan has two
large ongoing projects that obtain CO2
from a coal gasification plant in North
Dakota.

CO2 EOR

In the US, CO2 injection has accounted for recovering about 1.5 billion bbl
of oil and US CO2 sales for EOR reached
an estimated 3 bcfd in 2008 (Fig. 1).1
CO2 source fields provide most of
the gas injected in North American
EOR projects. About
83% comes from
source fields, 10.6%
from natural gas
plants, 1.4% from
fertilizer plants,
4.9% from coal gas
synfuels, 0.1% from
ethylene production.1
Fig. 2 shows current US CO2 sources
and pipelines.
The amount of
US remaining oil in
place is large. A 2008
report said that, of
the estimated 595.7 billion bbl of oil
in place, only 195.7 billion bbl will be
recovered with conventional means,
leaving 400 billion bbl stranded in
the ground (table).2 Of this, the report
estimated that 87.1 billion bbl could be
technically recovered with CO2 injection.
Oil & Gas Journal’s last EOR survey

O D U C T I O N

(Apr. 21, 2008, p. 47) listed 100 ongoing CO2 miscible and 5 CO2 immiscible
EOR projects. The enhanced oil production from these projects at the beginning of 2008 was 250,000 b/d. The
survey also showed 12 new CO2-EOR
projects would start during 2008-09.
An April 2010 OGJ article will update the EOR survey.
Most of the US CO2-EOR projects are

More CO2-EOR projects likely as new
CO2 supply sources become available
in the US Gulf Coast, Rocky Mountains,
and the Permian basin. In Michigan,
Core Energy LLC operates several CO2EOR projects that obtain CO2 from an
Antrim gas processing plant.

of CO2, according to Denbury.
The company plans to begin CO2
injections at Oyster Bayou in mid-2010
with an initial production response
expected in early 2011.
Denbury notes that its CO2-EOR
operating costs during second-quarter
2009 were $20.86/boe, broken down
as:
• $3.68/boe for CO2.
• $5.72/boe for power and fuel.
• $3.34/boe for labor and overhead.
• $2.00/boe for equipment rental.
• $1.36/boe for chemicals.
• $3.05/boe for workovers.
• $1.71/boe for miscellaneous.
Denbury also will continue to prove
up Jackson Dome’s probable CO2 reserves in 2010. It plans to drill the first
of three delineation wells early in 2010.
Its CO2 reserves estimate for Jackson
Dome is 5.6 tcf proved, 3 tcf probable,
and 2 tcf possible (Fig. 5).
Potential Midwest and Gulf Coast
anthropogenic sources could increase
available Gulf Coast CO2 supplies to

more than 3 bcfd by 2016.1
Except for some sales to industrial
consumers, Denbury uses all the CO2
produced from the Jackson Dome for its
own projects.

Rocky Mountains
Since 1986, most CO2 for EOR projects in the northern Rocky Mountains
has come from the ExxonMobil Corp.operated Shute Creek gas processing

plant in southwestern Wyoming.
Earlier this year (OGJ Online, June
29), Encore Acquisition Co. announced
plans to purchase 50 MMcfd of CO2 for
its Bell Creek EOR project in southeastern Montana from the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant in
Fremont County, Wyo.
The project involves building compression adjacent to the plant and installing a 206-mile pipeline to transport

uses have been around
for a long time and are
well known; others are newer, dictated
by new and more stringent regulations
or by rising energy prices (OGJ, Nov.

deals with
the uses of
oxygen in
oil refineries. All these uses come together under
“Process Intensification,” which also
includes achieving higher flexibility.
This becomes increasingly important as
the worldwide consumption of fuel is
still rising while only few new refineries are being built. Therefore the load
on existing refineries rises and spare
capacities shrink.
In this situation refiners must minimize new investment for adaptation to
the changed economic environment
and maximize output from existing

equipment. For that goal, process intensification by use of oxygen is an option
that includes mature technologies that
are cheap to install and easy to operate
safely.

Use of oxygen
Hydrogen has always been used in
refineries; but oxygen not so much.
This is changing for three main reasons:
1. Refiners are reducing excess
capacities for better economy. New
environmental laws, however, have
forced some refineries to add capacities.
That is particularly true, for instance,
for fluid catalytic cracking to utilize
heavy feed oils, and for Claus plants,
which receive more sulfur and substantially more ammonia from hydrotreaters. Similarly, the capacity of the waste
water treatment plant can be increased
by using oxygen.
These applications fall under “process intensification.”
2. The higher volatility of crude
oil and product prices forces greater
flexibility on refiners. Oxygen enrichment allows equipment to be operated
in a wider load range. Air-blown Claus
plants, for example, can be typically

enrichment, these plants can tolerate
30-135% load.
3. Oxygen gasification of residues
allows full conversion of even the last
drop of crude oil to valuable products.
This broadens the economic base of a
refinery and makes it more flexible and
efficient.
Gasification gas can be used for
many purposes, especially for hydrogen
recovery; as a synthesis gas, particularly
in C1 chemistry; and as a fuel in an
integrated gasification combined cycle
power plant. More recently synthesis
gas from a gasifier may also be used for
gas-to-liquids processes, which make
synthetic, ultralow sulfur fuel.
The following discusses the uses of
oxygen in various refinery processes.

FCCU
Fluid catalytic cracking converts
heavy hydrocarbons into light ones.4
A refinery operator can use it to shift
products between heavy and light,
making more diesel fuel or more
gasoline, for example. Vacuum gas oil
is used primarily as feed to an FCCU
but the FCCU can also process residues,

thus increasing product yield as well as
contributing to useful disposal of it.
At 450° to 650° C., the FCC reactor
breaks down hydrocarbons into hydrocarbons with shorter chains. The reaction produces coke as a by-product and
deposits it on the catalyst. The coke is
removed by burning at 550° to 750° C.
in regeneration. Then the regenerated
catalyst can be returned to the reactor.
Fig. 1 shows an FCC plant.
Developments with respect to clean
fuels and fewer emissions also affect
the FCC process:
• FCC regeneration is one of the major sources of sulfur dioxide emissions
in a refinery. They can be eliminated
either by improving cleanup of waste
gas from the FCCU or by reducing the
sulfur content of feed to the unit.
In waste-gas cleanup, which usually
uses sodium hydroxide, sulfur dioxide
is bound to sodium hydroxide and then
flows into the waste water. Emissions,
in other words, move from the atmosphere to the waste water.
This may be acceptable under
regulations, but it is certainly not an
environmentally favorable disposal.
More preferable is severe hydrogenation
of the FCC feeds in the hydrotreaters

and recovery of the sulfur as a product.
Then the vacuum gas oil, with distinctly lower sulfur content, produces fewer
emissions from the FCC regenerator.
• The FCC is important for increased
production of middle distillates. In particular, it can provide for better yields
and reduction of residues by mixing
in heavy feedstocks. But that requires
more capacity and flexibility, both in
the reactor and in the regenerator. Use
of oxygen enrichment in regeneration
can contribute substantially (Fig. 2).
• Oxygen enrichment in the FCC
also helps improve efficiency by
increasing capacity and flexibility in
choice of feed oils to the FCC. Fig. 2
shows how oxygen enrichment in regeneration increases FCC capacity.
It also shows that the degree of
conversion increases at constant feed
volume with oxygen enrichment to 27
vol % in the regeneration air (solid arrows). To maximize the throughput of
feedstock, one can increase the feed by
about 10% (dotted arrow in Fig. 2) with
a constant degree of conversion.
Conclusion: Oxygen enrichment in
FCC units allows the refinery operator
to increase the FCC capacity for greater
throughputs, obtain higher flexibility

Claus plants
Claus plants convert toxic hydrogen
sulfide to elemental sulfur. They can
also eliminate pollutants, particularly
by converting ammonia to harmless
materials, such as nitrogen and water.2 3
Fig. 4 shows a Claus plant.
Existing Claus plants in refineries
are usually designed to process highly
concentrated hydrogen sulfide fractions
with low proportions of hydrocarbons
and ammonia. Older plants usually
have the Claus units only without tailgas cleanup. In practice, they have sulfur recoveries of 95-98%. But current
European Union specifications require
sulfur recoveries of up to 99.5%+ for
units with a sulfur capacity greater
than 50 tpd. Local authorities may
demand even higher recovery rates, up
to 99.9+%.
Those values can be achieved only
with a tail-gas cleanup, which in turn,
causes a higher pressure drop across
the entire system. In general, the crude
gas pressure cannot be increased much,
if at all, because the gas comes from
regeneration of an amine scrubber. The
pressure there can be increased only by
raising the regeneration temperature,
which would cause more decomposition of the scrubbing agent and more

treatment capabilities rapidly becoming
insufficient, and degradation processes
often become anaerobic, with substantial odor emissions. These problems
cause conflicts with local authorities
and population.
Industrial oxygen can help to solve
these problems. Solutions have already
been attained for:
• Meeting peak loads in activated
sludge plants with pure oxygen.
• Nitrogen elimination with pure
oxygen by intermittent, simultaneous,
or upstream denitrification.
• Pure oxygen for emergency use or
for conversions of waste water treatment plants.
• Pure oxygen for waste water prepurification.
• Pure oxygen for conveying waste
water in pressure pipes.
The oxygen required is usually
injected via Venturi nozzles. The particular advantages of such system are its
low capital investment and the flexible
matching of oxygen supply to momentary need.
One example is process conversion
of the waste water treatment plant of a
refinery to nitrogen elimination using
industrial oxygen. In a specific case,
the treatment plant has three activated
sludge basins with a total volume of
4,280 cu m. The waste water throughput is 240 cu m/hr. A 30% reserve was
required in the design.
The biological oxygen demand (after
keeping the sample in complete darkness at ambient temp for 5 days; BOD5)
before treatment was 150 g/cu m, with
a chemical oxygen demand of 800 g/
cu m and total nitrogen of 146 g/cu m.
Effluent values must be guaranteed at
BOD5 < 3 g/cu m, COD < 30 g/cu m,
and Ntotal < 5 g/cu m.
The intermittent denitrification process was employed in the conversion.
In that process, the denitrification is
done in the same basins as nitrification,
but the oxygen input is cut off in the
denitrification phase. Eight such injection systems can introduce 400 kg/hr
of oxygen. Injecting pure oxygen makes

Ukraine
Ukraine remains the main transit
country for Russian oil and gas exports to Europe through the pipeline
infrastructure developed by the former
Soviet Union. About 22% of total Russian oil exports cross or are consumed
in Ukraine. The natural gas percentage is even higher at more than 80%
(Fig. 2). Although Ukraine has stepped
up exploration efforts, its oil and gas
production have remained flat for the
last decade, covering slightly more than
20% of domestic oil consumption and
almost 30% of gas consumption.1
Ukraine’s strategic goals include
retaining its position as the main energy
transit hub for exports to Europe, decreasing its dependence on Russian oil
and gas by increasing domestic production, and diversifying its import sources
by directly importing Caspian oil and
gas.
The country, however, faces a
number of obstacles in reaching these
objectives. Economic and financial woes
coupled with domestic political strife
and deteriorating relationships with
Russia endanger Ukraine’s status as the
main Russian export transit country.
The Soviet-era oil and gas pipeline
infrastructure is old and deteriorating
rapidly, and Ukraine cannot afford to
maintain and upgrade it. National oil
and gas company Naftogaz is technically
bankrupt and cannot support development of domestic oil and gas.
Pipeline projects initiated by Ukraine
to diversify oil and gas imports, such
as the White Stream (Georgia-UkraineEU) gas pipeline and the extension of
the Odessa- Brody oil pipeline to the
Baltic Sea port of Gdansk (Poland), have
stopped moving forward.
Ukrtransnafta, operator of the
Ukrainian oil pipeline system, stopped
Russian oil shipments in the OdessaBrody pipeline in October 2009 for several weeks—forcing Lukoil’s Black Sea
Odessa refinery to halt activity—and
reversed its flow to import oil directly

Romania is a traditional oil and gas
producer and was for a long time an
oil exporter. Domestic production,
however, is declining rapidly. The
country produced 99,000 b/d of oil
and 11.5 billion cu m of natural gas
in 2008, covering 80% of domestic
gas consumption, but only 44% of oil
consumption.

from Azerbaijan instead. SOCAR, the
Azeri national oil and gas company,
opened an office in Kyiv on Oct. 12
and has confirmed negotiations to buy
another Black Sea refinery in Ukraine,
the Kherson refinery.
These actions worsened RussianUkrainian relationships, already
strained by nearly continuous natural
gas import volume and transit fee disagreements. Russia and Ukraine signed
a new gas supply contract after the
winter 2008-09 supply crisis, but in October 2009 Ukraine announced a desire
to reopen negotiations in an effort to
reduce contracted volumes to 33 billion
cu m/year in 2010 from 42 billion cu
m/year in 2009.
Ukraine also seeks to renegotiate gas
transit fees, considering Naftogaz’s current annual transit revenue of roughly
$2.5 billion to be less than adequate.
Gazprom is strongly opposed to reopening the contract and the Ukrainian
government has warned that, although
it will not disrupt gas transit to Europe
during winter 2009-10, it cannot guarantee transit for 2010-11 without a new
contract.2
In its bid to increase domestic oil and
gas production, Ukraine has also antagonized Romania regarding the exclusive
economic zone boundary between the
two countries in the northwest corner
of the Black Sea (Fig. 3).
Ukraine faces an uphill battle the
next 5-10 years to maintain its preferred
transit country status, as internal political fights continue, competition intensifies from southern corridor projects
bypassing the country, and Russia continues to block direct access of Caspian
producers to Europe through Ukraine.

As a member of the European Union
since 2007 with more than 500,000
b/d of oil refining capacity and a
well-developed oil and gas pipeline
infrastructure, Romania presents an
interesting potential access point to
European markets for non-EU suppliers,
especially Caspian producers.
Romania spent the past 20 years
without a clear long-term energy
strategy, other than opposing any large
Russian-led project. The Romanian
Energy Strategy Plan for 2007-20 does
not mention any regional or European
strategic objective for the energy sector.

Signs of a more structured energy strategy, however, have recently
emerged. The main tenets of this
strategy seem to be close cooperation
with Caspian producers to allow them
to access to EU markets while Romania diversifies from Russian supplies,
coupled with an increased push to
revive domestic oil and gas production
and diversify the primary energy mix.
KazMunaiGaz, the Kazakh national
oil and gas company, acquired Rompetrol in 2007. Rompetrol has distribution
networks in 13 countries. Romania also
signed a strategic partnership agreement with Azerbaijan and negotia-

production interests in other countries
in the region, such as Turkmenistan,
Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Georgia. Turkey
is also using its historical and cultural
ties to the Middle East region to try
to secure gas supplies for the planned
pipelines, holding 2009 discussions
with Iraq, Iran, and Qatar to secure gas
for Nabucco.
Turkey has also improved its relations with Armenia, which is starting
to be viewed by some as an alternative
to Georgia as a transit route from the
Caspian Sea. The move angered Azerbaijan, which has a long-term conflict
with Armenia, prompting Azeri threats
in October 2009 to avoid Turkey as a
transit country for gas from the Shah
Deniz 2 project and instead study an
LNG or CNG route to the western coast
of the Black Sea.9
Turkey is actively diversifying its
energy mix, having ratified the Kyoto
protocol and adopted laws encouraging investment in renewable energy
production. Renewable sources, mostly
hydro, already meet 20% of Turkey’s
primary energy needs and Turkey has
three nuclear plants planned.
TPAO is leading Turkish efforts to
increase domestic production of oil and
gas, particularly from the Black Sea.
In 2006 TPAO initiated a $350 million
joint venture with Petrobras covering
two offshore Black Sea blocks and has
also actively explored the area on its
own.
Its other major Black Sea exploration partner since 2008 is ExxonMobil.10 TPAO’s CEO stated as recently as
October 2009 that 10 promising areas
in the Black Sea could contain recoverable reserves of up to 10 billion bbl oil
and 1.5-2 trillion cu m gas, enough
to allow Turkey to cover its domestic
consumption and become an oil and
gas exporter.11
TPAO started gas production in the
Black Sea in 2007 but still has a lot of
work to do to prove reserves of the
most promising prospects and finance
exploration and development, needing at least $100 billion and advanced
deepwater technology. TPAO does not

expect production from these fields
before 2020. ✦

Affordable energy
isn’t only target
of climate politics
In the rush to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, sharp increases in energy
costs won’t be enough to meet targets
now in place.
Yet even those aggressive and largely
unmet targets, set by the expiring Kyoto
Treaty, won’t have much effect on global
average temperature, supporters and opponents of the effort agree.
More will be needed if changes in

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s

human activity are to influence climate
measurably. Recent events show what
might be in store.
In the UK, Lord Smith of Finsbury has
proposed that citizens be assigned carbon
rations and forced to pay for excessive use
of products associated with the release of
carbon dioxide.
According to the Telegraph newspaper, Brits would receive accounts against
which carbon use would be credited for
purchases of, for example, fuel, airline
tickets, and electricity. Above-ration users
would have to buy credits, which belowration users could sell.
An Environment Agency official assured the paper that costs would hit only
persons with “extravagant lifestyles.”
Also in the UK, Lord Stern of Brentford,
who wrote a controversial 2006 study on
global warming, has reinvigorated suggestions that people quit eating meat.
“Meat is a wasteful use of water and
creates a lot of greenhouse gases,” largely
from flatulence of sheep and cattle, he
told Channel 4 News. “A vegetarian diet is
better.”
He said he hopes climate change negotiations in Copenhagen next month yield
increased meat prices.
The anticarnivorous response to
global warming is a pet cause of Rajendra
Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (OGJ, Sept.
22, 2008, p. 80). He’s a vegetarian.
Now California, never to be outdone
when there’s governance to be performed,
has cracked down on outsize televisions.
Tubes with screens above certain dimensions will have to meet tough new limits
on energy use. The California Energy Commission says televisions can account for
10% of a home’s electricity use.
But commissioners haven’t thought
this through. What’s the effect on climate
if Californians, denied the chance to watch
ballgames on wide screens at home, drive
their SUVs to sports bars instead and eat
hamburgers with their (carbonated) beer?

Crude, distillates in floating storage
Although it’s difficult to assess precisely how much crude and distillate fuel are
now held in floating storage around the globe, the associated risk is increasing
significantly, said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland.
It “used to be that in a period of low demand, refineries would run until the
onshore stocks would be filled up, then the contango would pressure the refinery
margins, which would then limit refinery production until stocks start to draw.
However, the total collapse in trade following the credit crisis at the end of 2008
and the zero interest rate policy of the US Federal Reserve has brought an additional and almost indefinite level of storage tanks through the use of ships as floating stocks. This means that refineries have been producing way over what should
have been the balancing economics,” Jakob said.
The International Energy Agency estimated 60 million bbl of oil and 80 million
bbl of distillates were in floating storage at the end of October. The Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries put the numbers at 40 million bbl of crude and
90 million bbl of distillates. ICAP Shipping International Ltd. projected 90 million
bbl of distillates would be in floating storage by the end of November, growing to
97 million bbl in December—a fivefold increase in floating distillate stocks within 9
months, said Jakob.
“If the current rate of increase in distillate floating stocks continues, we would
have at the end of March 2010 more distillate stocks on water then we had in
March 2008 in the total onshore US,” he said.
At a 40% processing yield, it took 250 million bbl of crude to produce the 100
million bbl of distillates that went into floating storage this year, said Jakob. Add
50 million bbl of crude in floating storage, “and that makes…300 million bbl of
crude oil equivalent that will come back to the market in the short to medium
term,” Jakob said. “On an annualized basis, this amounts to about 800,000 b/d.”
Coincidentally, OPEC expects world demand for crude to increase by 800,000
b/d 2010. That could be satisfied by the drawdown of floating inventories, which
“would leave onshore stocks basically unchanged from the current record highs,
while the supply and demand equation will still have to deal with some increase in
non-OPEC and noncore OPEC crude production,” Jakob predicted.
$100/bbl crude
In a move little noticed by most oil market observers, the benchmark US light,
sweet crudes contract for delivery in December 2017 briefly traded at $100.24/bbl
on Nov. 18 before closing at $99.66/bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
“That is the first time this year that any part of the on-exchange curve has
traded above $100/bbl,” said Paul Horsnell, managing director and head of commodities research at Barclays Capital in London. “Indeed, it is the first time since
the start of October 2008 that has happened. A small event in itself, but symbolic
nonetheless. The ledger will show that oil did trade above $100 in 2009, albeit
that it took until November to happen and occurred right at the back end of the
exchange-traded curve.”
Moreover, Horsnell said, the December 2017 contract “has been loaded with
more symbolism than you could shake a Dan Brown novel at.” Brown is the author
of The DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons, mysteries in which the protagonists
follow obscure clues involving religious symbols. Example: the crude contract for
that month never fell below $70/bbl, not even on Feb. 18 when the front-month
March contract dropped to $34.62/bbl on NYMEX.
“The contract has spent the past 4 weeks between $95 and $100/bbl and has
averaged just over $86/bbl for the year to date,” Horsnell reported Nov. 18. “In
other words, the closest thing the formal oil exchanges have for a proxy for the
long-term sustainable price of oil never fell below $70 even when the consensus
expected a severe multiyear economic discontinuity. Further, it has averaged $86/
bbl in the depths of a recession, and has returned to $100 when the economic
weakness proved to be more of a short-term shock than a multiyear trauma.”
Meanwhile, he said, “The front of the curve has remained severely range
bound. In our view, $70/bbl is now looking like the minimum sustainable price that
would not severely depress long-term investment, and moves below that level
would threaten to intensify the expected supply tightness that has kept the back of
the curve so well supported.”

Recruitment Practices and Generational
Characteristics

U

nderstanding the workplace differences between generations is more important
now than ever. As companies look to hire over the next several years, they will
interview and evaluate candidates spanning three age generations. Interviewers will meet
with a multitude of candidates, and will come face to face with generational differences.
Taking into account the foundational characteristics of each generation will add to a more
robust assessment and selection of talent that meets organizational values and goals. So
what should employers know about each generation?
First are the baby boomers. There are about 78 million baby boomers that were born
roughly between 1946 and 1964. Baby boomers are characteristically loyal, work-centric,
independent, goal-oriented and competitive. They believe that Gen-Xers and Y’s lack work
ethic and commitment to the workplace, and should conform to a culture of overwork. Baby
boomers equate work and position with self-worth; they
are clever, resourceful and strive to win. Boomers are well

1965 and 1980. Gen-Xers are the 46 million middle
children who are sandwiched between 80 million baby
boomers and 78 million Millennials. Generation X has an entrepreneurial spirit, thrives on
diversity, challenge, responsibility and creative input. Gen-Xers were witness to the effects of
their parent’s burnout and layoffs, so they entered the workplace with different work ethic and
culture than previous generations. Unlike the Boomers, Generation X places a premium on
family time, and has a different attitude about work. They are ambitious and hardworking, but
value work/life balance.
Finally, there are those who were born between 1980 and 2000, and are known as
Generation Y (or the Millennials). Generation Y is smart, creative, optimistic, achievementoriented and tech-savvy. Millennials are connected all over the world by email, instant
messages, text messages and the Internet. This high speed, tech-oriented generation needs
a variety of stimulating and creative activity in the workplace. Millennials prefer working in
teams, seeks out creative challenges, personal growth and meaningful careers. They want to
make friends with people at work, and work well with diverse coworkers. Some of the most
noted characteristics of the Millennials are a need for constant reinforcement and a short
attention span.
As recruiting efforts slowly begin to increase, companies have the opportunity to
incorporate generational characteristics into their hiring strategies. Employers can better align
these characteristics with their organizations structure, environment and culture.

The Value of Wellness
Building the Case for Wellness Programs in Remote Locations
By Tom Cooper, PhD, Mike Wahl, PhD(c), and Mike O’Neil

Organizations frequently ask specific questions
around the cost of wellness. How much does it
cost to run a ‘best practice’ wellness program,
how much should our cost be relative to our
risk in an approach to employee’s wellness and
are our current wellness arrangements costeffective? The reason for focusing on cost is
that financial directors, board members and
human resources directors have all identified
cost minimisation as a critical element in
ensuring an efficient and effective approach
to an employee’s wellness as part of a wider
human resources and operational strategy. We
believe that examining the cost of wellness is
just one part of the equation. Organizations
also have to examine the value a wellness
program provides.

Cost Minimization Vs. Value – Building the
Case for Wellness
Cost minimization is just one element in examining wellness.
Placed within the broader context of operating in a remote
location, examining the cost and value of a wellness program
becomes even more complicated. Further, when adding in
a workforce that may be starting to experience increasing
wellness issues – such as a predominantly male workforce
engaged in blue or gray collar jobs – there is even further
complexity for most organizations working in a remote
location. Undoubtedly, cost minimisation is a critical element,
but only one, of a wider approach to how well a wellness
program operates – especially in a remote location.
Working in a remote location can be extremely stressful and
demanding on an employee’s wellness. Physical workload,
dissatisfaction with safety and contingency measures are only
some of the factors affecting wellness. Moreover, stress caused
by intrinsic features of the job description and perception
of risk (Ulleberg and Rundo 1997) are all issues for wellness
programs to address in remote locations.

4

A wellness program needs to be seen an integral part of
any organization’s operations and cannot be considered a
‘one-time’ cost and subsequent short-term benefit. Instead,
wellness has to be valued across an employee’s time with an
organization, the benefits accrued, the costs which are saved
and the risks that are managed.

Working in Remote Locations – the Case
for Wellness
After a number of high-profile disasters (most notably
the Ocean Ranger disaster and Piper Alpha), oil and gas
industry companies as well as other organizations working
in remote locations are making every effort to ensure that
their accident rates are kept as low as possible. The focus on
‘accident’ prevention is the main driver for most Health, Safety
and Environmental (HS&E) programs. For most industrial
accidents, there is a causal chain of organization conditions
and human errors with Reason (1990) indicating that humanfactors causes can be attributed to 70-80% of accidents in highhazard industries.
Focusing solely on accident prevention is not a strategic
approach to addressing wellness. Focusing on wellness,
improving the overall organization’s and employee’s health is
a significant way of driving down not only accident incidents
but also overall operational cost.
Working in remote locations such as the offshore drilling
process is inherently dangerous, arduous and socially isolating.
The environment is characterized by constant noise and
activity, and the employees live and work in a restricted
working location for a period of time without any breaks.
Most of the workforce is male, engaged in blue and gray collar
jobs, and there is a significant portion of the population at risk
especially when looking at key wellness determinants such as
hip to waist ratio.
Consequently, the working environment in a remote location
contains many environmental and organizational factors
that are potential sources of ill health, i.e. demands in an
individual’s environment that are perceived to be a threat to
the individual. The combination of heavy equipment, immense

physical forces and geological uncertainty with numerous
personnel creates an overall risk to wellness.
Several studies on working in remote locations show an
association between job stress, strain and health problems
(Theorell and Karasek 1996; Ulleberg and Rundo 1997).
Other studies have shown that social
support – such as a wellness program
- can have a positive effect on workers’
well-being and health (Parkes et al.
1994). The need for a comprehensive
wellness program in a remote location
to manage stress, risk and employee
health becomes clear. The question is
whether the value that accrues to an
organization is worth the cost incurred?

Sustaining Wellness
Wellness should be seen as a strategic issue. Our research with
companies and individuals in remote locations shows that
recognizing the strategic value of a wellness program can be
quite positive for a company – specifically on brand awareness,
equity as well as decreased recruitment costs.

Reinvent the Future of Energy

In years to come, shifts in industry
structure (majors versus independents),
aging infrastructure, deep water
operations, new drilling and production
technology, more complex wells,
and the turnover of the owner and
contractor operations workforce may
affect company-level and industrywide HS&E performance (Jablonowski
2006).

Imagine yourself contributing to an organization that operates
a critical piece of California’s energy infrastructure.
We believe that empowering people is the key to powering
the grid of the future.

Wellness programs can be a major
source of HS&E performance
improvement. Moreover, by shifting
the focus to value and cost savings there
can be significant benefit accrued to the
organization’s operations – including
direct costs such as decreased used of
medicines, reduced medical benefits
as well as indirect costs such as lower
recruitment and training expenditures.
Further, senior management, in trying
to make or understand the case for
developing a wellness program, can
begin to model the cost. Through
modelling the potential cost and
subsequent value that a wellness
program presents to organizations
working in a remote location, the
need for a wellness program becomes
strikingly clear.

HR MANAGEMENT

HS&E programs centred on accident prevention cannot
be sustained without a focus on wellness. Wellness
programs are a primary tool in sustaining long term
competitive advantage in operating in a remote location.
Initial compliance based strategies focusing on shortterm expenditures and not value may ultimately create
more operational costs in the long term. Moreover, most
health and safety programs do not recognize the value of
taking a wellness approach. This means that there is not
only a lack of long term value but a potential failure of
corporate responsibility and ultimately a loss opportunity for
performance improvement.
Employers have a corporate responsibility to provide a safe
workplace to enact measures to reduce the likelihood that
employees are injured (Jablonowski 2006). There are also
direct economic consequences of HS&E events, and it is in
an organization’s best economic interest to improve wellness
performance.
Estimates suggest that it costs between $50,000 and $100,000
to administer a lost time injury (Buchan 1999). This does
not include other costs such as lost productivity, sick pay,
equipment damage, increased medical premiums, the cost of
medicines to treat the injury, increased insurance premiums
or costs of legal action should a claim arise, which could be
several times as much (Flin and Slaven 1996; Sumrow 2002;
Jablonowski 2006). Moreover, it does not include operational
costs such as the extra recruitment needed to replace workers,
additional workforce to provide excess capacity in the case of
accident and time away from work as well as training for new
or replacement workers.
Moreover, given the spotlight on companies conducting
business in remote sites, especially from opponents in many
of the locations where they operate, means that organizations
must remain proactive if they intend to maintain their overall
license to operate. Critics often cite HS&E performance as a
reason to limit exploration and production (E&P) activities
(Brinded 1998; Gidley and Hall 2002). Wellness programs can
therefore be seen as a license to operate issue.
Companies with good wellness performance should incur
lower compliance costs. Also good performance across the
industry may drive broader reform than reduced compliance
costs. Clearly companies benefit both individually and
collectively from improved HS&E performance focused on
wellness.

What is meant by Value of Wellness?
For the purpose of this article, we want to focus specifically on
three concepts related to the value of wellness:
Wellness value – the overall value (both financial and
operational) that an approach to wellness gives an
organization, its employees and other stakeholders
Wellness risk – the risk of impairment to the organization’s
business model, operations, reputation, and financial condition
from failure to address wellness. This means that the organization
does not meet expectations of key stakeholders such as customers,
employees (both current and future) and society as a whole, laws
and regulations as well as internal standards and policies.
Wellness Programs - the proactive mechanisms by which
organisations exploit and manage wellness risk.
When organisations talk about ‘wellness cost’ essentially they
should be focusing on the costs of identifying and controlling
wellness risk as well as developing the proactive mechanisms
of a comprehensive wellness program.
Regulators and other stakeholders may take a more narrow
view, for instance, looking at wellness costs as specifically
those related to reducing accidents and other health and safety
incidents. However, taking a holistic approach to wellness is
more appropriate to the everyday health and safety manager,
human resources director, as well as the broader operations
within an organisation.
For example, Gerard has just been hired to work at your
offshore oil rig. An experienced welder, he has worked in the
field for over fifteen years starting at the age of 22 in the Gulf
of Mexico. His job is physically demanding and is a specialized
skill set for your offshore operations. Gerard is moderately
overweight and after a year working with you has developed
obesity and extreme hypertension. This is predominantly
because of your nutritional policy on board the rig and the lack
of a wellness program. Gerard is advised by his Doctor to go off
work and to start an expensive round of medicine to combat
the illnesses. You are also forced to recruit an additional welder
and this has to be done in quite a short timeframe as Gerard
operates on a three weeks on, three weeks off period.
So in Gerard’s case, there are costs and issues to be addressed
by the health and safety manager, human resources director
and by operations. However, if Gerard’s continuing wellness

issues are not addressed then there are significant issues related
to critical illness as well as potentially death.
Understanding that addressing wellness is directly linked to
senior management and its concerns about how individual
liability risks are being addressed is also key in understanding
its value. Ultimately, the value of a wellness program is derived
from operations cost savings as well as risk management.

The Cost of Wellness for Senior
Management
For Health and Safety directors, focusing the ‘cost’ of wellness
on identifying and controlling wellness risk within a specific
department or business unit may be sufficient.
However, for finance directors, CEOs, board members and
other stakeholders, there may need to be a different approach
to costs. For them, cost can normally relate to a number of
areas, including:

•

•
•
•
•

•

•

Cost of Recruitment – the cost of recruiting new
staff since existing staff decided to leave due to
health related reasons
Cost of Retention – the cost of retaining existing
staff
Liability – costs related to issues which lead to
death or critical illness
Medicine and Medical – programs that add cost
to the organization
Wellness activity-based costs –cost of activities
such as monitoring health, policies towards
wellness, oversight, reporting, rectification etc.
Remediation – the cost of remediation to
employees as well as any related internal costs and
those associated with disciplinary action, e.g. fine
for health and safety violations
Business review – the cost of assessing whether
there are problems in the business related to
wellness – including root cause analysis

including medicine costs, individual liability for health related
failings, employee retention issues with the associated costs
and risks, potentially significant remediation costs and license
to operate issues.
At its core, the question senior management has to ask itself
is, given the current level of costs, is the existing approach to
wellness performing adequately, and what is the quantitative
value a wellness program should be providing for the
organization?

Overall Value of a Wellness Program
Definitions has developed a model to examine the cost and
value of wellness looking at both direct and indirect costs an
organization might face in failing to address risks pertaining
to wellness. Taking all the direct costs together, a wellness
program can assist in a cost savings of up to $125,000 per
employee on a yearly basis within an employment lifecycle
when seen within the entire spectrum of operational costs.
There are also a number of ‘one-off ’ costs that can be saved by
having a wellness program. The ‘one-off ’ costs such as Time
Away from Work, Training and Recruitment could save a
company an additional $150,000 over the employment lifecycle.
Based on a twenty-year lifecycle, this will result in savings of
$2.650 million – excluding the potential costs of death and
critical illness which would potentially double that amount.
Ultimately the value is not only direct cost savings, Intangibles
such as brand equity and license to operate are issues that must
also be considered. For senior management, direct cost savings
can be estimated using activity based costs, and it is clear
that there are significant direct costs that a wellness program
may prevent over the course of an employee’s time within an
organization.

NUCLEAR/FOSSIL

For Executives, Board members and finance directors, the
actual cost of a wellness program is relevant only with respect
to its performance and value to an organization.
If the wellness program does not perform or meet expectations,
then there is an increased risk to the business and individual
senior managers/directors. If this risk is not addressed, the
result may be increased fines, considerable medical premiums

HR MANAGEMENT

For senior management, the ‘bottom-line’ number for
the business case for wellness will clearly depend on the
organization, its operations and the nature of the work in
remote locations but nonetheless, the value of a wellness
program becomes clear.

Conclusion
At Definitions, we believe that the cost and value of a wellness
program has to be considered both from a ‘bottom line’ and
‘forward-looking’ perspective. Our research and working with
numerous industries, companies and employees in remote
locations, has demonstrated to us that the cost of a wellness
program should be seen primarily from savings accrued to
an employer throughout the time an employee works for a
company – the baseline for the overall value of a wellness
program to an organization.
Savings through the establishment and implementation of a
comprehensive wellness program can be seen, not only from
a health and safety perspective, both also from operational
effectiveness. We believe our research shows that there is
significant value accrued to an organization through the
establishment of an effective wellness program. —EW

ENERGY WORKFORCE

The Upstream Energy Value Chain
By Kripal Kavi

The energy value chain is one that is intrinsic
to the existence of the world as we know it
today. It is an industry that is more than 150
years old and is one of the most complex in the
world today. By the very nature of its product,
this business is subject to risks such as geopolitical risk, business risk, financial risk,
credit risk, market risk, currency risk – the list
continues. However, the very existence of these
multitudes of risk serves to show that a career
in the energy industry can be both, financially
and personally rewarding.
Exploration and Production: Known as E&P for short, this
label describes the activities associated with finding oil and
natural gas and getting them out of the ground. This area of the
energy value chain is also referred to as “upstream.” Firms in this
area specialize in activities such as seismic surveying, drilling
(offshore and onshore), rig construction, land management, etc.
They build, operate and manage rigs independently or for large
integrated oil companies. As a result of their operations, these
organizations tend to be large, geographically diversified and
capital intensive. Also, this is a fairly fragmented industry with
7 – 8 companies owning just 25% of the market share. Profit
margins here are directly tied to the price of crude oil and are
typically among the highest in the energy value chain.
Most integrated oil companies1 and national oil companies2 have
captive E&P divisions, but occasionally do hire independent
E&P firms on a project-by-project basis. Career opportunities
here are most commonly available for petroleum/chemical
engineers, geological engineers, land management experts and
civil engineers. Opportunities for business folk are limited and
would most involve positions such as accounting, supply chain
management and to an extent, HR.

geographically localized. The profit margins in this industry are
typically low and are inversely proportional to crude oil prices.
With increases in crude oil prices, demand for their products
decrease while costs for raw materials (crude) increase. The US
government, from time to time, to compensate for diminishing
profit margins, has subsidized small players within this industry.
However, this subsidy has been gradually decreasing over time,
leading to the closure of a number of independent refineries.
As with E&P, most IOCs and NOCs have captive refining
divisions. Diminishing profit margins within this industry in the
1990s led to a number of refinery closures with refinery count in
the US dropping to low of 144 in 2002 from over 300 in the mid
to late 1980s. Opportunities here are mostly limited to chemical
engineers, refinery operators and operations managers.
Trading: Crude oil is the most commonly traded commodity
in the world today. Huge volatility in prices and a tightly
controlled supply have driven the growth of oil trades in
the commodities trading industry. The role of firms within
this space is to act as either brokers or dealers. As a broker,
these firms are usually hired by other energy companies on a
commission basis to engage in the buying and selling of crude
oil spot contracts, futures and options. In contrast, as dealers,
the trading companies take actual positions in the oil. In
other words, they actually own the oil that they trade and are
typically captive divisions of larger organizations involved in
other activities on the energy value chain.
The commodities trading industry is heavily fragmented with
most financial services institutions participating in some form

Refining: Refining initiates a segment of the energy value chain
that is collectively referred to as “downstream.” Historically
downstream activities have proved to be less profitable than
upstream. As a result, the industry is dominated by larger
organizations that also have E&P activities. Similar to E&P,
this industry is also capital intensive, but typically tends to be

or the other. Given the global nature of the underlying asset,
organizations tend to have operations in multiple geographies.
The industry experienced significant growth over the last few
years preceding the financial crisis of 2008. Given the largely
variable cost structure driven mainly by labor, this industry
can adapt quickly to changes in the economy. Typical careers
in this industry consist of positions such as commodity
trader, currency trader, risk manager, treasury, information
technology and economist/analyst.
Transportation and Storage: This industry executes the
transportation of crude oil and other refined products. In certain
cases, firms also own large storage areas where crude oil and
related products can be staged before they are actually utilized.
The main mode of transportation of oil is pipeline. Due to
increased dependence on foreign oil and oil imports during the
last few years, the volume of product being transported by these
networks has gradually decreased. Also, prices for transportation
services has remained fairly constant as a result of which revenues
within this industry have been steadily declining over the past few
years. The revenues within this industry are forecasted to decline
further over the next few years due to increased imports and fixed
prices. And since this is a high fixed cost industry, the decline in
revenues will directly impact profitability.
Major oil companies usually have their own transportation
networks. Opportunities within this industry include positions
for civil, mechanical and chemical engineers, environmental
engineers and accountants.
Retail: Retail services include the actual marketing and selling of
the final refined products to the consumer and/or corporations.
This industry is broadly classified into firms that deal primarily
with fuel oil and others that deal with gaseous products.
Margins within this space are declining, and the industry has
consolidated significantly over the last few years. The operations
here are primarily related to the selling of gasoline, diesel oil and
other fuel oils to individual consumers. With the consolidation,
employment within this industry has also been gradually
declining. The roles most commonly available in this industry
are related to the areas of procurement, accounting, supply chain
operations and marketing.

10

The sub-industry that deals with gaseous fuel products is heavily
fragmented with the top four firms having a market share of just
15% in 2009. These firms engage in the sales and distribution
of gaseous fuels such as Propane, Natural Gas and LP gas to
corporations such as utilities. The industry has been steadily
profitable and is subject to lesser volatility, as natural gas prices
do not fluctuate as wildly as crude prices. However, the recent
crashes in fuel prices have dampened profits within this industry
as well, which is largely capital intensive. Opportunities within
this space are available in the areas of supply chain and logistics,
accounting, information technology and sales operations.
Electricity Generation and Distribution: Currently in the
US, electricity generation and distribution is regional, with
each geographic region usually having only one or two major
players. Prior to the 1990s, this industry was heavily vertically
integrated with firms involved in generation and distribution
activities. However, now there is a clear segmentation between
electricity producers and distributors.
The power generation industry is moderately fragmented with
a high level of competition. With the recent developments in
distributed generation from renewable sources such as solar
and wind, the number of independent power generators is
growing. Revenue increases in this industry are driven largely
by increases in electricity prices and not additional volumes.
And projects here typically tend to be very long term – in the
range of 30 to 40 years. Recent concern over GHG emissions
has caused increased interest in natural gas, nuclear and
hydroelectric plants. Most utility companies source part
of their electricity in-house from captive assets, and the
remainder from a highly fragmented market of individual
power generators. Opportunities here are available for
mechanical, process and civil engineers, accountants, contract
analysts and procurement specialists.
The power distributors, as the name suggests are primarily
involved in power transmission and distribution. The revenues
in this industry are directly tied to power consumption, which
in turn is very highly correlated to the state of the economy.
Profit margins within this industry are highly regulated as a
result of government bodies constantly regulating prices. There
is a wide range of positions available within this space, ranging

from sourcing, supply chain, contract management, marketing
and sales to accounting, finance and government relations.
Energy Consulting and Other Services: As mentioned above,
the energy value chain is extremely complex and is influenced
by innumerable factors. Thus, it becomes challenging for
energy companies to develop absolute competencies in all
the different areas. This provides the market opportunity
for a number of energy services firms that work with energy
companies in various settings. This space consists mostly of
consulting firms and financial services firms.
There are a number of consulting firms (generalist and boutique)
that offer consulting services to energy companies. The topics
consulted on range from engineering-heavy areas such as
geology and rig construction to economics-related spaces such
as strategy, market research and project due-diligence. Employee
turnover within the consulting industry tends to be on the
higher side due to extensive travel and these firms are constantly
on the lookout for new talent. Individuals who have been in
the industry for a long time or who have significant consulting
experience are prime hiring targets for these firms. Due to the
specialized nature of these services, margins tend to be very high.
As energy is a very capital-intensive industry, financial services
firms play a key role in the value chain. These firms provide
transaction advisory services, trading expertise, capital raising
activities and in some cases, even project valuations for large energy
firms. There are a number of boutique energy focused financial
services firms. And there are firms that perform both, consulting
and financial services activities. As with the consulting firms,
individuals with intricate knowledge about the energy industry or
with prior investment banking experience are highly sought after.

Energy – a growing opportunity
As you can see, the energy value chain offers opportunities to
people from a wide variety of disciplines. Opportunities range
from technical roles such as engineering and operations to
business roles in finance, strategy, marketing and economics.
All said and done, energy is intrinsic to all human activity,
and as a result, is a key strategic resource for countries. This
makes the industry fundamental to national security. And
the importance of this industry to the world will increase
multifold over the next few years as a result of increasing
consumption and potentially finite resources.

are expected to face a severe talent crunch over the next five to
ten years3. The main drivers for this are an increasing number
of employees approaching retirement age and a dearth of skilled
talent. The recent changes in the economy since then have
somewhat altered the latter, but the first challenge still remains.
As a result, opportunities in this industry are anticipated to
grow over the next few years. Individuals interested in working
on complex problems in a truly international environment,
with relatively high job security and competitive remuneration
should definitely give energy a second look. —EW

RECRUITER’S PRACTICUM

How to Choose the Best
E-Learning Vendor
for the Energy Workforce

Within the energy sector, the greatest change
driving the need for improved approaches to
learning and employee development is the
demographic reality of an aging workforce
within every professional discipline. Referred
to in many energy industry studies as the
“big crew change”, the retirement pattern of
skilled senior personnel over the next five to
10 years will require significant transfer of
responsibility to new employees. One of the
critical actions being taken in response to the
rapidly approaching tipping point is education
– transferring knowledge to the next generation
of engineers and technicians.

RECRUITER’S PRACTICUM

Education is making a critical contribution to addressing the
exiting expertise problem within the energy sector. Industry is
enhancing in-house education and training capabilities often
by working with educational organizations to develop new
approaches to career-long learning.
While professional development remains an essential part of
organizational health, it can be costly, too. Per capita training
budgets in companies across the sector ranged from $4,000
to $8,000 in a recent survey conducted by EnergyWorkforce,
with this cost expected to increase in coming years. The
use of technology to deliver learning content has increased
proportionally and companies are spending more on external
services like content design, development and technical
infrastructure for training delivery.
For five consecutive years, we have seen a significant upswing
in online classroom enrollment as companies shift from inperson to online instruction to save on travel costs, reach
geographically dispersed workforces and ensure consistent
content delivery. According to current research, virtual
learning, whether in real time or at the learner’s own pace,
differs little from live classroom training. Given the range
of e-learning vendors available, it can be confusing at best
to select the right online learning program. What should
a training manager look for when evaluating Web-based
training? How can he or she be sure that the program will be
effective?
According to Work-Learning Research, there are eight
principles to which an effective virtual learning program
should adhere. When evaluating various vendors, CLOs would
do well to consider the following points: learning contexts,
practice and testing, level of feedback, repetition, learning over
time, diversified material presentation, exclusively relevant
information, and focus. Following are questions to ask when
undergoing the selection process.

1. Aligning Learning and Performance
Contexts
• Does the program contain integrated, energyspecific case studies that bring elements of the job
into the online classroom?
• Does it contain realistic scenarios that provide
context for each lesson?
• Do the lessons evaluate understanding by posing
problems or challenges similar to the ones the
learner may encounter on the job?

En er gy Wo r k f o r c e

•

Is there an opportunity to discuss, with an
instructor/subject matter expert (SME) and with
other students, how concepts apply to actual
situations on the job?

2. Providing Retrieval Practice and
Testing
• Does the program offer a pre-course assessment to
establish the learner’s knowledge baseline?
• Does each lesson contain a problem that tests the
learner’s understanding and ability to apply the
lesson concepts?
• Are assignments, with feedback, a requirement?
• Is there a final exam at the end of the course?
Note: Research shows that the very act of taking a
test increases retention, even if the learner didn’t
study at all!
3. Providing Feedback on Practice and
Testing
• Is there a feedback system in place in the event the
student answers a lesson problem or final exam
question incorrectly?
• Do all practice exercises within the online courses
also provide the correct answer and a complete
explanation?
• Do the students receive personalized feedback
from an expert instructor/SME within 24 hours
after submitting an assignment?

RECRUITER’S PRACTICUM

•

Do the instructors participate actively, on a
daily basis, in online discussions, providing
personalized feedback to the users’ postings?

•
4. Providing Repetition of Learning and
Practice
• Does every lesson reinforce the challenges the
learner would experience on the job?
• Are the assignments hands-on? For instance, do
they just learn about the work breakdown structure
(WBS), estimating methods, network diagrams,
and project earned value—or do they actually build
a WBS, estimate a project, construct a network
diagram and calculate earned value?
• Do the exercises and instructional games, as well
as the final exam, provide additional practice?
5. Spacing Learning and Practice over
Time
• Are the students given a timeframe within which
they must complete the course?
• Is the content “chunked” into a series of lessons,
making it easy for the learner to complete one
lesson at a time?
• Is it a self-paced program that provides a guideline
schedule to help learners plan and budget their
time?
6. Presenting Learning Material in a
Variety of Ways
• Is the course material diversified in terms of its
delivery format, avoiding the dreaded “next, next,
next” sequence of a slide show?
• Is the presentation of the content interactive and
student-centered, allowing students to access
content at will and to control at least some of the
sequencing?
• Is the interactive content supported with
additional online text in printable, PDF format?
• Does the course offer engaging and often
interactive graphics to help learners visualize
processes and relationships?

•

Do the courses also offer practice exercises,
problems, assignments, and online discussions—
all with feedback—to reinforce the content?

7. Utilizing Relevant Information Only
• Is all content relevant to the course content—or
are there gratuitous animations and gimmicky
flash?
• When there are comics and games, are they
clearly instructional and tied to specific learning
objectives?
8. Helping Learners Focus on the Most
Important Information
• Does the course supply a syllabus that summarizes
the major topics covered in each unit and
identifies the specific learning objectives for each
unit?
• Do scenarios and problems emphasize the key
focus of the lesson?
• Are there opportunities to complete exercises that
strengthen the emphasis?
• Do the individual content resources incorporate
sound design principles in order to clarify and
emphasize important points, including screen
layout, font size and type, and graphic design?
• Are all the questions on the final exam tied to a
specific learning objective, ensuring that the test
itself continues the focus on core content?

If you answer ‘yes’ to every question, you can have confidence
that the program you are reviewing is instructionally
sound and that users will retain and be able to apply their
newly acquired knowledge and skills. But, if you see gaps
in the program’s offering, move on until you find the most
appropriate online course to match your needs. The selection
process will be less arduous if you know what you are looking
for. The importance of establishing top-quality, versatile
e-learning programs for your most important resources–the
people you employ–cannot be overstated. Evaluating the
available courses beforehand will improve your chances of

Evaluating the available courses beforehand will improve your
chances of success, strengthen your return on investment and
ensure a vibrant learning organization in the long term.

success, strengthen your return on investment and ensure a
vibrant learning organization in the long term.
The exodus of technical expertise in the energy sector will
continue to accelerate. It is necessary to view this exodus not
as a short-term problem, but as a long-term opportunity to
train and develop a more versatile, skilled and technically
savvy generation of engineers and technicians. Decisions on
investments in people are just as important as the decisions
on investments for infrastructure and capital equipment.
E-learning helps to create an organizational capability for selfrenewal through knowledge retention and transfer. These new
and innovative learning models incorporate the best of people
and technology to optimize the effectiveness of scarce human
and financial resources. —EW

Venezuela energy minister resigns
Venezuela Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez resigned after President Hugo Chavez requested the resignation of all his cabinet ministers.
Chavez told reporters in Venezuela that the ministers will stay in
their posts until replacements are approved.
Ramirez has been minister since 2002 and was appointed president of state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA in November
2004. He did not resign as PDVSA president, PDVSA told Business
News Americas. PDVSA officials confirmed that Ramirez had resigned as minister.

N. Sea decommissioning to cost $42 billion
Companies operating in the North Sea are expected to spend
$42 billion on decommissioning infrastructure, said Wood Mackenzie Ltd., Edinburgh.
About 48% of decommissioning costs will be spent in Norway
and 40% in the UK, WoodMac said.
North Sea operators say the UK government needs to clarify the
regulation, tax, and decommissioning liability rules that will help
them close deals faster on transferring ownership rights over their
acreage. The UK Offshore Operators‚Äô Association and the Independent Oil & Gas Association have been lobbying the government to
make progress on this issue, said WoodMac.
The companies are concerned about changes to the UK tax regime that could affect the levels of tax relief they can claim against
decommissioning costs. ‚ÄúHowever, the UK industry would welcome change to current liability and financial security requirements,‚Äù the analyst added.
WoodMac anticipates the majority of future decommissioning
expenditure to be in 2015-31 with a spending plateau of about
$1.5 billion/year. However, operators are expected to have some
success in extending the life of existing fields beyond current
plans.
To date 40 fields have been abandoned‚Äî23 in the UK, 11 in
Norway, and 6 in the Netherlands‚Äîand an additional 66 fields are
being decommissioned or await abandonment.

Countries sign energy efÔ¨Åciency accord
The US, China, India, Japan, and South Korea agreed on Dec.
15 to work together to boost energy efficiency, to diversify their
energy sources, and to guard against emergencies in the face of
rising oil prices.
In a joint statement, energy ministers from the countries said
they face a common challenge to obtain ‚Äúsufficient, reliable, and
environmentally responsible supplies of energy with reasonable
prices.‚Äù

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

The statement said in recent years global oil price fluctuations
and increases have hurt the world economy, especially developing
countries.
The ministers said the collective efforts of their countries, which
consume about 47% of the world‚Äôs energy, are of great significance
for the stability of the international market for oil and other sources of energy, as well as for enhancing global energy security.

Total to cut gas Ô¨Çaring in half by 2012
Total SA plans to cut its gas flaring by 50% at its operated facilities in the Gulf of Guinea and other places by 2012 to reduce
climate change and promote energy efficiency and sustainability.
Total said it reduced gas flaring by 40% during 1998-2005 at its
operated facilities despite boosting gas production levels. Associated gas flaring accounted for 23% of its greenhouse gas emissions
in 2005.
‚ÄúWe will look at reinjecting gas back into oil fields,‚Äù a spokesman said. Total also wants to send gas to the proposed 5 million
tonne/year Angola LNG project, operated by Chevron Corp. Total
plans to use otherwise flared gas for electric power generation in
Nigeria and is keen to produce methanol, he added.
Total is a member of the World Bank‚Äôs Global Gas Flaring Reduction partnership. Established in August 2002 by the World Bank,
the public-private partnership facilitates and supports national efforts to use currently flared gas. Partners include governments of
oil-producing countries, state-owned companies, and major international oil companies.
In 2000, Total set a ‚Äúzero flaring‚Äù policy for its projects.

New Zealand to meet IEA inventory target
New Zealand Energy Minister David Parker announced that, effective Jan. 1, New Zealand would meet its International Energy
Agency obligation to hold oil stocks representing 90 days of net
oil imports.
New Zealand‚Äôs oil stocks have dipped to volumes as low as 60
days of net oil imports as a result of increasing demand and declining domestic oil production, he said. In May, criticized New
Zealand‚Äôs inventory levels.
The government has arranged contracts that provide options
for New Zealand to buy petroleum and diesel in case of an IEA-declared emergency. The contracts cover petroleum and diesel stored
in Australia, the Netherlands, and the UK from BP PLC, Royal Dutch
Shell PLC, and Total SA.
The New Zealand government signed bilateral arrangements
with the governments of Australia, the UK, and the Netherlands
to enable the stocks to count toward New Zealand‚Äôs IEA obligations. ‚ú¶

Development

Shell, Plains E&P make GOM oil Ô¨Ånd
Shell Offshore Inc. has made an oil discovery on its Friesian
prospect on Green Canyon Block 599 in 3,800 ft of water in the
Gulf of Mexico, about 200 miles south of New Orleans.
The discovery well was drilled to 29,414 ft TD and encountered
more than 120 ft of net oil pay. The well is prepared for completion
and temporarily abandoned.
Shell, operator, and Plains Exploration & Production Co. each
own a 50% interest in the project.

Leases issued for Ô¨Åve oil shale projects
The US Department of the Interior has issued research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) leases for five oil shale projects
in Colorado‚Äôs Piceance basin, the US Bureau of Land Management
said Dec. 15.
C. Stephen Allred, assistant Interior secretary for land and minerals
management, signed the RD&D leases for projects proposed by Chevron USA Inc., EGL Resources Inc., and Shell Frontier Oil & Gas Inc.
The leases grant rights to develop oil shale resources on tracts
up to 160 acres for a 10-year initial term, with an extension option of up to 5 years with proof that diligent production levels have
been pursued.
The leases also contain a preferential right to convert the RD&D
acreage, plus as much as 4,960 acres of adjacent land, to a 20-year
commercial lease once commercial production levels are achieved
and all requirements are met, it added.
The tracts were identified in proposals submitted by the companies in June 2005. The leases contain project-specific requirements
for permitting, monitoring, and environmental mitigation.
Target shales are in the Eocene Green River formation, which
lies under parts of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, and according
to BLM might hold 800 billion bbl of recoverable shale oil. More
than 70% of the formation lies under federal land.

Husky Ô¨Ånds gas, oil in Jeanne d‚ÄôArc basin
Husky Energy Inc., St. John‚Äôs, Newf., and Norsk Hydro Canada
Oil & Gas have made a hydrocarbon discovery during delineation
drilling in the Jeanne d‚ÄôArc basin, off Newfoundland and Labrador.
The West Bonne Bay F-12 well was drilled in significant discovery license (SDL) 1040, about 320 km southeast of St. John‚Äôs,
and near the Terra Nova oil field. Under a farm-in agreement with
Norsk Hydro, operator of SDL 1040, Husky drilled the well using
the Rowan Cos. Inc. Gorilla VI jack up rig.
The F-12 well was drilled to TD 4,666 m. A sidetrack well F12Z was drilled to further delineate the structure and to gather
additional reservoir information. In both wells hydrocarbons were
encountered in the Upper Hibernia formation. Further analysis of

core, fluid samples, and wire line log data is continuing to estimate
the resources in this pool.
Husky served as operator for the drilling program and holds a
27.78% interest in the West Bonne Bay well. Norsk Hydro is operator of the SDL and holds a 72.22% working interest.

Indonesia awards PSCs to 18 companies
Indonesia has awarded production-sharing contracts to 18 companies in an effort to boost the country‚Äôs dwindling oil production.
The government wants to increase oil production to 1.3 million
b/d by 2009 from the current 1.04 million b/d.
Indonesia invited companies to bid on 41 oil and gas blocks
onshore and offshore Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Java.
The winning bidders must drill as many as 32 wells over the
next 3 years at a total cost of about $235.78 million.
Companies that secured exploration rights in frontier areas will
receive 80% of the net oil production, while those operating in
nonfrontier areas will receive 65% of net production.
Winners included ConocoPhillips and partner Statoil ASA,
which obtained rights to explore for oil and gas on the Kuma Block
in western Sulawesi. Also CNOOC and its partner PT Gregori Gas
Perkasa won rights for the Batanghari Block in central Sumatra.

PetroLatina to develop SeraÔ¨Ån gas project
PetroLatina Energy PLC, formerly Taghmen Energy PLC, has initiated
development of the 1991 Serafin gas discovery in Area B of the Tisquirama License in Colombia. Gross reserves are estimated at 4-8 bcf.
The Serafin well is north of PetroLatina‚Äôs Los Angeles field and
3.5 km from a main gas pipeline. PetroLatina holds a 50% interest
in the project, and PetroSantander Inc. holds 50%.
PetrLatina will reenter and work over the well this month and
test results will determine the design of a tie-in to the pipeline.
PetrLatina expects commercial gas deliveries to start in second
quarter.
Development cost, including pipeline and tie-in, is estimated at
$1.36 million.
Recent increases in the price of gas in Colombia to about $3/
Mcf will enable the project to pay out in 5 months, PetroLatina
said. Local industries will buy the gas.
Texas Petroleum Co. drilled the Serafin well, which encountered a gas-bearing sand in a stratigraphic trap of the Miocene Real
Group. Logs indicated 18 ft of pay with porosity of 28% and a water saturation of 27%. The well flowed at rates of up to 16 MMcfd
from a 4,582-98-ft zone on extended tests. Reservoir pressure is
1,978 psi, and the gas is over 97% methane.
PetroLatina is using 3D seismic data to identify further prospects. ‚ú¶

and Statoil ASA is commercial operator, responsible for gas sales,
contract administration, and business development (OGJ, May 15,
2006, Newsletter).
In addition to BP and Statoil, which hold 25.5% interest each,
Shah Deniz shareholders include State Oil Co. of the Azerbaijan Republic, Total, Naftiran Intertrade Co. Ltd., and LukAgip NV‚Äîeach
holding 10%‚Äîand Turkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi, 9% (OGJ,
Mar. 17, 2003, Newsletter).
The field, which has gas reserves pegged at 25-35 tcf, is expected to produce 8.6 billion cu m/year of gas in Stage 1 and 37,000
b/d of condensate, which will be shipped to Ceyhan, Turkey, for
processing (OGJ, Aug. 21, 2000, p. 68).
Gas is being exported to Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey via the
$1.3 billion, 700 MMcfd South Caucasian Pipeline. The BP-operated line extends 430-miles from Baku to Tbilisi, Georgia, and Erzurum in eastern Turkey, paralleling the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan crude
oil pipeline.
Beyond Erzurum, there currently is no place for the remaining
gas to go, but Georgia has agreed to place some of the gas in storage until Erzurum can be integrated into the Turkish gas network.
Turkish state-owned Petroleum Pipeline Corp. will assume gas
transportation at the border, and will build a new pipeline to tie in
to the existing Turkish distribution network at Erzurum.

Petrobras starts up P-34 FPSO off Brazil
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has brought online the P-34
floating production, storage, and offloading vessel, establishing
first-phase production of Jubarte field off Espirito Santo, Brazil.
P-34 flow will rise to nominal capacity of 60,000 b/d, including 15,000 b/d of 17¬∞ gravity oil from the Jubarte-4 horizontal
well and output from three other wells.
Production from the second production well, ESS-110, could
start by yearend.

Dalia oil Ô¨Åeld starts production off Angola
Oil production from Dalia field off Angola started Dec. 15 and
will reach 250,000 b/d by next summer, field operator Total SA
reported.

Processing
Ireland reÔ¨Ånery producing renewable diesel
ConocoPhillips has begun commercial production of renewable
diesel from soybean oil and other vegetable oils at its 71,000 b/d
Whitegate refinery in Cork, Ireland.
Whitegate is producing 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel using
its existing equipment. Unlike biodiesel, the renewable diesel is
blended and transported with petroleum-based diesel. ConocoPhillips said renewable diesel involves different processing methods
than biodiesel. Renewable diesel also is different chemically from
biodiesel. Use of the renewable diesel will help reduce carbon
emissions, ConocoPhillips said.

Dalia field, which lies on deepwater Block 17, 135 km offshore
in 1,200-1,500 m of water, holds 1 billion bbl of recoverable oil
(map, OGJ, Feb. 14, 2005, p. 24). Oil is being produced from 37
wells, all of which are tied in to 9 manifolds. The field also has 3
gas-injection and 31 water-injection wells.
Subsea installations include 40 km of insulated flowlines linked
to 8 flexible risers specifically manufactured for the project. The
risers take fluids to a floating production, storage, and offloading
vessel, which can store 2 million bbl of oil.
According to Total, Dalia is the largest deepwater development
to be brought on stream in 2006 and among the largest projects of
its kind in the world.
Total holds 40% interest in Block 17. Partners are Esso Exploration Angola (Block 17) Ltd. 20%, BP Exploration (Angola) Ltd.
16.67%; Statoil Angola Block 17 AS 13.33%, and Norsk Hydro Dezassete AS 10%.

Firms clash over Yacheng gas supply outlook
CLP Holdings Ltd., Hong Kong, rejecting claims by natural gas
suppliers, China National Offshore Oil Corp., BP PLC, and Kuwait
Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co. (Kufpec), that Yacheng gas field
off Hainan Island has sufficient reserves to supply Hong Kong
through 2036, decided to build an $8 billion (HK) LNG terminal on the Soko Islands southwest of Lantau after an independent
assessment in 2002 concluded that the field‚Äôs reserves would be
insufficient to meet increased demand for gas in Hong Kong.
Demand growth for gas on Hainan Island, rising by 23%/year,
is expected to create a shortfall during 2006-10 because supplies
are forecast to increase by only 18%/year.
CNOOC, however, said it plans to invest $80 million on drilling 3-4 production wells after 2009, lifting the total number to as
many as 15 and expanding the exploration area to 322 sq km.
CNOOC owns a 51% stake in Yacheng, while BP and Kufpec
share the remaining 45%. Yacheng reserves are pegged at more
than 100 billion cu m.
CLP consumes 2.5 billion cu m/year of gas, or 83% of Yacheng‚Äôs
annual output. ‚ú¶

Plains conÔ¨Årms offshore oil pipeline leak
Plains All American Pipeline LP said a crude oil leak was detected Dec. 24 on its High Island Pipeline System off Texas City,
Tex., 30 miles south of Galveston in the Gulf of Mexico. No injuries
were reported.
Earlier that day, Plains said the pipeline had experienced a pressure
loss and was shut down. The cause of the incident is being investigated.
The company said it is working with federal and state officials
to minimize the consequences of the incident.

Firm presses plans for Indonesian gas line
Indonesia‚Äôs PT Bakrie & Bros. (B&B) Pres. Bobby Gafur Umar
said the company plans to proceed with construction of a 1,115km pipeline to transport natural gas from East Kalimantan to Central Java despite adverse comments by Indonesian Vice-President
Jusuf Kalla about the project‚Äôs feasibility.
Kalla earlier said the government might cancel the $1.26 billion
project due to a change in domestic gas markets, with Java likely to get
fresh supplies from Cepu gas field in Central Java.
Kalla said gas output in Kalimantan is showing signs of depletion.
Umar, however, said the pipeline was in line with the program proposed to upstream regulator BP Migas, which awarded BB the tender
to build the project (OGJ, Feb. 20, 2006, Newsletter). Construction has
been scheduled to start in early 2007and to complete in 2009.
B&B has a 25-year contract from the government to operate
the transmission pipeline, and it has been seeking cooperation
with Mitsui of Japan and Daewoo of South Korea to build the line,
which will transport 1 bcfd.

PDVSA plans Caribbean-PaciÔ¨Åc oil pipeline
Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) plans to build a pipeline
through Nicaragua to transport oil from the Caribbean to the Pacific, bypassing the Panama Canal.
Officials of the Nicaraguan-Venezuelan oil firm Alba Petroleos de
Nicaragua (Albanic), which is managed by Nicaragua‚Äôs Sandinista-controlled Association of Nicaraguan Municipalities, confirmed the plans.
Albanic Pres. Jose Pena mentioned PDVSA‚Äôs additional interest
in building a refinery in Nicaragua to supply Central America with
products.
Pena said the plans will be part of an accord to be signed by
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Nicaraguan President-elect
Daniel Ortega after the latter is sworn in as president Jan. 10.
Albanic Vice-Pres. Dionisio Marenco, mayor of Managua and a
Sandinista member, said the Panama Canal is too narrow to allow
passage of large tankers. He said the pipeline would be used to
boost the export of oil products made in Nicaragua from Venezuelan crude to China and Japan as well as the Pacific Coast of Central America. Nicaragua‚Äôs only refinery is Esso Caribbean & Central

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

America‚Äôs 20,000 b/d facility in Managua.
In May, Ortega and Chavez signed a cooperation initiative enabling Venezuela to sell oil to Nicaragua on credit.
Venezuela will accept 60% of payment within 90 days of shipment, while the remaining 40% will be paid off over 25 years at
1%, to include a 2-year grace period.
The creation of Albanic is widely seen as a sign of Ortega‚Äôs
growing political alliance with Chavez. ALBA is the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas, a Latin American integration initiative
started last year by Cuba and Venezuela, which aims to counter US
efforts to promote hemispheric free-trade integration.

Fast-track plans outlined for Iranian LNG plant
Perth-based Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd. plans to accelerate development of its 3.45 million tonnes/year Qeshm LNG project in Iran.
The Qeshm Island liquefaction plant, expected to deliver its first
LNG shipment in first quarter 2010, is being developed in partnership with Civil Pension Fund Investment Co. Iranian.
The plant will be developed in three phases. The first phase calls
for a 1.15 million tonnes/year train in first quarter 2010.
Developers are working with Iranian authorities to select a plant
site and finalize an LNG sales agreement.

Gorgon LNG plan clears environmental hurdle
Western Australia has cleared the way for a final investment decision on the Chevron Australia group‚Äôs $15 billion (Aus.) Gorgon
LNG project off the state‚Äôs northwest coast.
However the group must commit an additional $60 million
(Aus.) to conserving and monitoring the flatback turtle population, which annually lays eggs on Barrow Island near the plant
site, and comply with stringent conditions concerning dredging,
quarantine, greenhouse gas reinjection, short-range endemics and
subterranean fauna.
The group also will be required to contribute $40 million (Aus.)
toward resolving environmental issues in the Pilbara and West Kimberley regions, including rehabilitation of Dirk Hartog Island.
The project needs final environmental approval from the Federal
Minister for Environment Ian Campbell before it can proceed.
Chevron and partners ExxonMobil Corp. and Shell Australia will
have to weigh the costs of these latest conditions against the economics of the project.
The group has already invested $1 billion in development preliminaries, including $40 million for a carbon dioxide data well
on Barrow Island to investigate the feasibility of geosequestering
Gorgon‚Äôs 12% CO2 content in reservoirs.
Chevron says that an indication of whether the two-train, 10
million tonne/year LNG plant would go ahead could be given in
mid-2007. ‚ú¶

Recycling
The Recycle the Gulf program has
reclaimed about 2 million lb of materials since its inception in 2002. It‚Äôs a
complete recycling program that entails
collecting recyclables at the source,
removing them from the general waste
stream, and sorting them into commodity categories (cans, plastics, paper,
cardboard). Recyclables are compacted
on the rigs and shipped to dock facilities. Tech Oil Products Inc., based in
New Iberia, provides training, equipment, storage facilities, and a handling
system (www.enviro-pak.net).
Bags of compacted recyclables are
periodically delivered to Tech Oil Products. The company tracks recyclables
from each rig so contributions can be
reported via a web-accessible database.
Green bags are used for recyclables to
distinguish them from white bags used
for general waste.

BeneÔ¨Åts
Recycling reduces pollution, conserves natural resources, conserves
energy, decreases the cost of disposing
of waste in landfills, and creates jobs.
The Recycle the Gulf program is not
only environmentally friendly, it also
provides work and funds to the handicapped clients of ARC Unlimited. The
recyclable commodities are donated
to ARC of Iberia, which processes and
resells the materials to a recycling plant.
Tamara Juckett, coordinator of Recycle the Gulf, said the program enables
handicapped and disabled people to
develop self-reliance by allowing them
an employment opportunity that might
otherwise be unavailable.
Recycling is only one element of
ongoing environmental efforts by the
companies involved. We hope to see
more environmentally aware operations
worldwide. ‚ú¶

Restraining government
Governments historically err on energy policy
by governing too aggressively, especially on fuel
choice. There are two basic reasons for this. Nothing in their nature makes governments better
at fuel choice than fuel users are. And because
politics dominates their decisions, governments
inevitably make fuel decisions that help favored
constituencies at the expense of energy consumers.
Governments serve public energy interests best by
letting markets work and ensuring that they do so
freely and fairly, by setting and enforcing reasonable environmental standards, and by otherwise
restraining themselves. Congress and the Bush
administration should apply this perspective as
they assess a late-2006 set of proposals by a group
called the Energy Security Leadership Council.

Oil dependence
The council‚Äîa group of retired military flag
officers, corporate executives, and government
leaders‚Äîwants to enhance energy security by
lowering US dependence on oil. Its agenda is balanced and thoughtful. Unlike most recommendations born of alarm over oil‚Äôs domination of the
energy market and origins in politically unstable
regions, the council‚Äôs prescriptions are not patently antagonistic toward petroleum. They even
call for expanded leasing of the Outer Continental
Shelf and Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coastal
Plain. The recommendations collapse, however,
around a basic flaw. They put government at the
core of energy decisions.
They call for strengthened vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, ‚Äúsubstantial government incentives‚Äù
and research spending for biofuels, mandates that
vehicles be able to burn 85:15 ethanol-gasoline
blends, and tax credits to help ‚Äúfamily-owned
service stations‚Äù install fuel tanks and pumps able
to store and dispense ethanol. They include new
government support for use of biomass as petrochemical feedstocks and for enhanced oil recovery.
They urge ‚Äúsignificant financial incentives‚Äù for
domestic manufacture and use of ‚Äúhighly fuelefficient vehicles.‚Äù They seek a review of US and
International Energy Agency policies on strategic
oil stocks. Programs like these aren‚Äôt cheap. Funding can come only from taxpayers and energy
consumers. If the programs have merit, the market
will support them. So why raise public spending
and fuel costs?

The council apparently doesn‚Äôt trust markets. One of its principles states: ‚ÄúPure market
economics will never solve this problem‚Äù of oil
dependence. Then this: ‚ÄúGovernment intervention is necessary.‚Äù In the cover letter conveying its
recommendations ‚Äúto the President, the Congress,
and the American People,‚Äù the council further
reveals its orientation by asserting, ‚ÄúFor more than
2 decades, federal energy policy has been afflicted
by paralysis.‚Äù That, of course, would be the period
of oil and gas markets free of price controls.
The council‚Äôs analysis looks back fondly at
imposition of corporate average fuel economy
(CAFE) standards in the mid-1970s, for example,
yet ignores the coincident phaseout of oil price
and allocation controls. It thus repeats the common mistake of attributing vehicle fuel-efficiency
gains of the period wholly to government energyuse controls and ignoring market effects. Airline
and air courier executives on the council‚Äôs board
should know better. Aircraft manufacturers greatly
improved the efficiency of jet engines in the
1980s without CAFE-type regulation. They did so
in response to the commercial pressures exerted
by elevated jet-fuel prices. ‚ÄúPure market economics‚Äù does indeed solve problems. It solves them
better than government interventions do.

Splendid era
The quarter-century since oil-price deregulation has been a splendid era for energy consumers,
an era of ample supply and low average prices.
Even at recently elevated levels, oil and gas prices
are‚Äîdare anyone say so?‚Äîaffordable for most
consumers.
The council frets that during the low-price
years US dependence on imported oil rose and
that vulnerabilities appeared in the global distribution system. Both observations are valid. But so are
the observations, which the council failed to make,
that oil trading is now much more flexible than
it used to be and therefore better able to handle
disruption, that large producers able to influence
marginal supply fear demand destruction at least
as much as they do low price, and that interdependencies between buyers and sellers provide a large
measure of security that receives too little notice.
The US has energy problems. But too little intervention by government isn‚Äôt one of them. ‚ú¶

Alan Petzet
Chief Editor-Exploration
Expect 2007 to be a
strong year for exploration and development
worldwide.
Among the challenges: Discovering
economic oil and gas fields, profitably
developing existing discoveries, tapping
technology to
improve
exploration
and
recovery economics, contending with
the so-called brain drain in the geosciences, and dealing with the rise of
national oil companies. Some explorers
believe most discoveries will come in
areas previously off-limits to exploration.

Exploration & Development: New
thinking confronts the ‚Äòbrain drain‚Äô

About this report
In this look ahead at a new
year, Oil & Gas Journal‚Äôs specialist editors examine strong and
immediate trends in the operating areas they cover. Among
the topics: a brain drain in the
exploration and development
disciplines, smart wells and
increasingly powerful rigs in the
world of drilling and production,
reÔ¨Åning capacity deÔ¨Åciencies
and a looming LPG surplus in
the processing industries, and
beneÔ¨Åts to the industry of growing attention to pipeline integrity.

SPECIAL

Report
The Year Ahead

Others believe they will occur in areas
already drilled and written off for sound
reasons. These finds, they say, will be the
product of new exploration thinking.
The size of the resource base seems to
be the least of problems. The world target
is estimated at 3-4 trillion bbl of conventional and nonconventional oil.
The challenge, said ExxonMobil Corp.,
is to combine investment, technology,
and public policy in a way that enables
companies to successfully explore for and
produce those supplies and deliver them
18

to market efficiently. The effort requires
the participation of industry, government,
and consumers.
The International Energy Agency
estimated that the industry needs to invest
more than $200 billion/year through
2030 to meet demand, and Lehman Bros.
Inc. has projected 2007 exploration and
production spending worldwide at $292
billion (see story, p. 25).
Geophysical contractors foresee further
hikes in exploration outlays. Demand for
seismic surveys already exceeds capacity,
especially offshore. Some companies report
record backlogs.
Late-year surveys showed that many
large and small oil and gas companies plan
to moderate capital and exploration spending in 2007. Some overspent their 2006
budgets by a margin larger than the capital
spending increase they plan in 2007.
The vast majority of E&P companies
say drilling economics is better than
acquisition economics, but most of them

still plan to purchase reserves when the
price is right.
Giant oil fields are still being discovered‚Äîbut not as many as in earlier decades. The more recently discovered giant
fields have not been as large on average
as those found in earlier years, and their
peak production rates are therefore not as
great.
Nevertheless, one industry database
contains information on more than 2,000
undeveloped oil and gas discoveries
worldwide. Many are small or remote, but

they have a better chance for development
with the innovative production schemes
being applied in recent years.
The high oil and gas prices that stimulate so much exploration also aggravate
the brain drain. Among other things, high
prices prompt experienced geoscientists
to resign positions in established companies to set up their own businesses, often
in oil and gas E&P.
‚ÄúWithin BP,‚Äù said Tony Meggs, the
company‚Äôs group vice-president, technology, ‚Äúmost of our younger staff has been
attracted to the company because of our
stand on the environment‚Äîand they
hold our feet to the fire if it ever looks as
though we are failing to live up to those
commitments.‚Äù

The exploratory effort has little to do
with the political goal of energy independence, argues Chevron Corp. Chairman
David O‚ÄôReilly, who pointed out recently
that not one of the world‚Äôs 193 countries
is energy-independent. He said government policies that focus on independence
are counterproductive because they create
demand uncertainty and discourage
producing countries from making the
investments needed to supply markets.
International oil companies plan large
capital and exploration spending increases
in 2007 even as oil and gas operators in
general look toward spending a larger
share of their budgets outside the US.
The trend will intensify concerns
about corruption and security. ‚ú¶

ventures between national oil companies (NOCs) and international operators
will continue to expand. For example,
Saudi Aramco‚Äôs 5-year plan to add 50
tcf of gas reserves involves four ventures
with non-Saudi companies:
‚Ä¢ Sino Saudi Gas, working with
Sinopec.
‚Ä¢ South Rub Al-Khali Co., with Royal
Dutch Shell.
‚Ä¢ Luksar, with Lukoil.
‚Ä¢ Enirepsa, with Eni SPA and Repsol
YPF.
The foreign operators will drill 300
development wells and more than 70
exploratory and delineation wells. In
2006, Saudi Aramco announced deployment of its 100th rig, and the new plan
will undoubtedly require additional
rigs.

Drilling & Production: Powerful
new rigs drill in tough conditions
Nina M. Rach
Drilling Editor
The drilling industry
this year will use newer,
more-efficient, and
more-powerful rigs and
tools to test new plays
and develop reserves in challenging
environments such as arctic conditions
and deep, high-temperature, high-pressure regimes. Service companies and
academia will continue to develop new
ideas and technologies to support operators‚Äô programs.
Rig fleets are growing and gaining in quality worldwide with mostly
incremental improvements. Interesting new designs in conventional and
coiled-tubing land rigs will continue
to appear.
Rig renovation programs are even
more prevalent than the newbuilds
being touted; almost all will encompass new automated systems that make
the drilling workplace safer and more
environment-friendly. Zero-discharge
equipment is being slimmed down.

The industry also has heightened its
interest in enhanced oil recovery projects. These projects include steam, gas
such as carbon dioxide, and chemical
injection. Much of the EOR technology
exists, but the additional costs of these
processes compel the industry to look at
ways to optimize their use.
The worldwide allure of sequestering
CO2 emissions also is raising interest in
enhancing oil production though CO2
injection. Fields supplying CO2 for EOR
in the Permian basin of West Texas and
New Mexico are at capacity. Investments
in additional capacity are being made.
There also is talk in the industry about
obtaining CO2 for the Permian basin

sources such as new integrated gasification combined-cycle power plants.

last 2 years from being demand-driven
to being supply-driven.
Globally high crude oil and natural gas prices are supporting equally
high LPG prices. This condition has
increased production while dampening demand, especially in developing
markets. Middle East production and
exports are increasing, moving the
global market toward an LPG surplus.
In fact, the surplus looks set to expand
as several new LPG projects are on the
horizon.
Among recent LPG market developments has been a slowing of growth
in developing markets. Chinese and
Indian markets in particular have begun
to level out, a trend Purvin & Gertz believes might be temporary. As witnessed
only a few months ago in US NGL storage numbers, summertime surplus has
increased.
Volumes in excess of demand, however, do not result from US gas plant or
refinery production. Indeed, Purvin &
Gertz notes that for 3 consecutive years,
US waterborne LPG imports have set
records, drawing even Middle East LPG
back to the US Gulf of Mexico.
High prices notwithstanding, US LPG
production has lagged behind historical levels, at least since 2002, according
to Petral Worldwide Inc. (OGJ, Nov. 6,
2006, p. 52).
Focusing on the concept of ‚Äúfull
recovery‚Äù in US propane production,
Petral notes that it has not averaged
900,000 b/d or more since mid-2002
and that by third-quarter, estimated
propane production had reached only
805,000-815,000 b/d.
The implications seem clear: The
US will import yet more propane

production continues to decline. More
broadly, however, the world is fast becoming awash in LPG; Purvin & Gertz
says LPG production is increasing in
every part of the world except North
America.
Expansion of LPG supply worldwide
has roots in growth of the global LNG
industry. Purvin & Gertz says LPG sup24

ply projects are emerging in association
with new liquefaction plants.
The timing of the numerous LNG
projects, says the consultancy, will
greatly affect LPG and natural gas markets over the next 5 years.
That a long-anticipated expansion in
LNG supply is in progress seems clear
from a look at plant and terminal data
compiled by OGJ and GTI, Des Plaines,
Ill., and shipping data from EA Gibson
Shipbrokers Ltd., London.
Over the next 2 years, industry is
poised to start up nearly 50 million
tonnes/year (tpy) of liquefaction capacity, commission more than 14 million
cu m of LNG shipping capacity among
more than 90 vessels, and begin operating nearly 90 million tpy of regasification capacity.
In 2007, slightly more than 22.5
million tpy of liquefaction capacity is

to start up. Headlining this surge will
be the long-delayed Sn√∏hvit project,
the first LNG export project north of
the Arctic Circle; Nigeria LNG‚Äôs Train

In 2007, as many as 35 LNG carriers will be commissioned at an average capacity of more than 141,000 cu

Although paying for these services

FACTS forecasts two gas-price convergence trends
Natural gas prices are converging upward, both in conjunction with rising
oil prices and across global gas markets,
according to a study of gas trends by
Fesharaki Associates Consulting & Technical Services Inc. (FACTS), Honolulu.
‚ÄúBoth trends are unique and define
for us a whole new world,‚Äù FACTS said.
‚ÄúMost buyers and sellers have not yet
grasped the implications of these two
trends.‚Äù The study, ‚ÄúGlobalization of Gas
Prices: When Will It Become a Reality
in the East?‚Äù was released during the
early December Gastech meeting in Abu
Dhabi.
Analysts forecast a long-term Henry
Hub price of $7-9/MMbtu. Their forecasts point toward ‚Äúirreversible‚Äù higher
oil prices worldwide. ‚ÄúWe will [still]
have cycles, but from a higher price
base,‚Äù the analysts reported.
FACTS analysts expect oil prices
could drop slightly during 2007 with
an anticipated brief supply boost from
outside the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. But long-term oil
26

prices are expected to increase to a level
that curbs demand growth.
‚ÄúWhat is that price? We feel that real
prices have to rise by anywhere from
50-100% (base price of $80/bbl for
Dubai crude and $85/bbl for West Texas
Intermediate) on the back of moderate economic growth before demand is
curbed by much more efficient use and
new technologies that will reduce the
dependency on oil,‚Äù FACTS said.
Analysts foresee oil price equilibrium at $60/bbl for Dubai crude. Due
to fuel switching, gas prices are bound
to rise as well, although they are capped
by competition from coal and nuclear
power.
Meanwhile, LNG prices will be
driven by high construction costs, the
reentry of the US into the LNG market,
shortfalls of contracted Indonesian LNG
supplies, and Qatar‚Äôs becoming the
world‚Äôs biggest LNG supplier.
‚ÄúThe Qataris know they hold most
of the cards in the near term and intend
to take advantage of it‚Äîasking for

higher prices and diverting cargoes to
the highest-paying markets‚Äîpaving the
way to become the price setter in the
world LNG scene,‚Äù FACTS said.

Price thresholds
For years, UK gas prices were the
lowest, followed by US and European
prices, while Asia had the highest gas
prices. In 2005, US and European prices
converged at higher levels, leaving Asian
prices behind.
In 2006, a new trend emerged,
with US and UK gas prices converging.
Meanwhile, Asian prices have resumed
their threshold above US and UK prices.
‚ÄúWith a real linkage in markets, new
spot markers in the Atlantic Basin have
emerged as the reference price in the
East,‚Äù FACTS reported. Traders rely upon
US and UK gas prices as a reference
price for Asian and Middle Eastern LNG
spot prices.
The Asian LNG market is experiencing increased tightness. Middle East
producers can send cargoes to both the

New group to develop energy policy recommendations
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Energy consumers and producers,
including six oil and gas trade associations,
have formed what former US Sen. John
Breaux (D-La.) termed ‚Äúa coalition of coalitions‚Äù to develop national energy policy
recommendations.
Called the Energy Initiative, the group
intends to examine all aspects of energy,

including global climate change, organizers told reporters at a Dec. 15 briefing.
‚ÄúOnly when you bring all sides together with a legitimate balance discussion
can you solve problems America faces. Energy clearly is one of those problems,‚Äù said
Breaux, who cochairs the EI with Beverly
O‚ÄôNeill, a former mayor of Long Beach,
Calif., and former president of the National
Council of Mayors.
O‚ÄôNeill added, ‚ÄúWe have to address

this issue head-on. The cities of the United
States have taken it on to determine what
can be done locally, and their efforts are
important. But a guiding national concept
is needed.‚Äù
Following the briefing, representatives
of the 9 producing and 22 consuming
organizations met in three committees addressing transportation, stationary energy
consumers, and conservation and efficiency.
‚ÄúThis coalition is a unique endeavor,

A look back
at 2006

‚ÄúF

ast away, the old year passes....
Hail the new, ye lads and
lasses!‚Äù But before saying goodbye to
2006, a look back at the year‚Äôs more
remarkable moments in US oil and
gas politics seems apt.
Several moments were amusing.
A few were significant. All hereby
receive a ‚ÄúWatchy,‚Äù the annual award
introduced in this column a year ago
(OGJ, Jan. 2, 2006, p. 29). Recipients
include the following...
US President George W. Bush,
who in his annual State of the
Union address on Jan. 31, earned a
‚ÄúBully Pulpit‚Äù Watchy when he said,
‚ÄúAmerica is addicted to oil, which is
often imported from unstable parts
of the world. The best way to break
this addiction is through technology.‚Äù The accompanying switch in
federal emphasis from conventional
to alternative energy research and
development accelerated a process
that was under way. But it also runs
a risk of not funding, and finding,
new ways to recover more domestic
oil and gas.
Next, an ‚ÄúUh, oh! My bad!‚Äù
Watchy goes to unnamed bureaucrats in the US Minerals Management
Service who omitted price thresholds
from those deepwater Gulf of Mexico
leases in 1998 and 1999. If anyone
tries to collect the award, we‚Äôll immediately notify MMS Director Johnnie Burton, who probably would like
to thank them personally.

On a lighter note
A ‚ÄúLead Balloon‚Äù Watchy goes to
Senate Republicans for responding
to rising retail gasoline prices on
Apr. 27 with a bill to provide motorists a $100 tax rebate. ‚ÄúConsum28

ers are feeling pain at the pump and
Republicans are moving aggressively
to address their concerns,‚Äù Majority
Leader William H. Frist (R-Tenn.)
said. They moved even more aggressively away from the idea when
voters responded with howls of
laughter.
Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.)
receives a ‚ÄúTell It Like It Is‚Äù Watchy
for calling the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge‚Äôs coastal plain ‚Äúa
barren slope‚Äù during the final hour
of House floor debate on a bill to
open the area to oil and gas leasing on May 25. It was a refreshing
contrast to ANWR leasing opponents‚Äô characterizations of all parts
of the refuge as a pristine national
treasure to be preserved for future
generations.
A ‚ÄúStop the Presses!‚Äù Watchy goes
to the 109th Congress‚Äôs Joint Economic Committee for concluding in
an Oct. 31 report that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been trying to manipulate
world oil prices.

Last, but not least
Finally, a ‚ÄúNever say die!‚Äù Watchy
goes to Louisiana‚Äôs congressional delegation for its eventually successful
struggle to get immediately adjacent
coastal states a share of federal offshore royalties.
Louisiana has said it will spend
the money for coastal restoration
and hurricane protection. But the
provision‚Äôs inclusion in the final bill
also establishes a precedent for other
coastal states reconsidering whether
to allow oil and gas activity off their
shorelines. ‚ú¶

which is what is needed to move things
forward,‚Äù said American Petroleum
Institute Pres. Red Cavaney. He noted
that API is aware of a general public
lack of understanding regarding energy
production, particularly oil and gas, and
expressed hope that the EI could help
improve the situation.
EI will develop broad recommendations, which Breaux hopes to deliver to the
administration of President George W. Bush
and the 110th Congress by mid-2007.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we will be responding to
specific legislation or issues,‚Äù he said.
Donald F. Santa, president of the
Interstate Natural Gas Association of
America, said that the time is ripe to
address wider energy questions. ‚ÄúAll
too frequently, when it comes to specific energy projects‚Äîwhether a wind
turbine, a pipeline or [an LNG] terminal‚Äîcitizens and their elected officials
adopt a not-in-my-backyard, don‚Äôtbuild-it-here mentality,‚Äù he observed.
The Association of Oil Pipe Lines,
Domestic Petroleum Council, Independent Petroleum Association of America,
and National Ocean Industries Association also are participating.
Environmental organizations are
represented through the Apollo Alliance,
a coalition of labor and organizations
and environmental groups, including
the Sierra Club and National Wildlife
Federation. Most US environmental
groups want the US to diversify its energy sources beyond oil, gas, and other
fossil fuels, and the group will present
that view, according to the alliance‚Äôs
Pres. Jerome Ringo.
Breaux said he expects global climate
change to be a major part of EI‚Äôs deliberations. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you can address
energy now without it. The changes in
the new Congress suggest that there will
be climate change discussions there. We
would like to be part of that,‚Äù he said.
O‚ÄôNeill said she hoped EI could produce worthwhile recommendations for
a national energy strategy. ‚ÄúFor a decade
now, states and organizations have formulated energy policies, but the federal government has provided no guiding policy,‚Äù
she said. ‚ú¶

Putin‚Äôs
oil grab

R

ussian President Vladimir Putin
is not good for his country‚Äôs oil
industry. If you doubt that, consider
some of the stories that have been
emerging from his‚Äîand we use that
term advisedly‚Äîcountry over the
past several months.
We have, of course, been following reports of Mikhail Khodorkovsky,
the jailed head of the bankrupt oil
major OAO Yukos. Not content to
throw him behind bars on trumped
up charges, Putin‚Äôs government has
proceeded to harass the former oil
mogul even in his jail cell.
Last April, Khodorkovsky spent
several weeks in isolation after he was
slashed in the face by a fellow inmate
while sleeping. That was after he had
been placed in solitary confinement
three times for allegedly breaking
prison rules.

Abramovich worries
In the latest move, Khodorkovsky
and an associate, Platon Lebedev, have
been moved to a detention center in
the eastern Russian city of Chita to
face possible new charges, according
to his lawyer, Natalia Terekhova.
She did not mention what charges
were being considered by Russian
prosecutors, but as we are coming to
learn, any and all charges are possible
in Putin‚Äôs Russia. The ability to make
money is about only thing needed to
incur the wrath‚Äîor greed‚Äîof the
Putin regime.
Roman Abramovich, who made
his fortune from oil when Russia‚Äôs
public utilities were privatized in the
1990s, seems to recognize that trend
and is putting distance between himself and Putin.
Effective Jan. 1, Abramovich‚Äîwho
30

last year sold his stake in oil company
Sibneft to Gazprom for $13 billion‚Äî
hopes to be finished as governor of
the remote region of Chukotka, having
submitted his resignation to Putin.
Observers say Abramovich‚Äôs resignation is a sign of his plan to depart
from Russia altogether. In fact, they
say the 40-year-old oil tycoon has
sold off most of his assets at home
and now spends most of his time in
western Europe.

Shell suffers
Still, he apparently wants to stay
on the good side of Putin, whose
government stands accused of assassinating political opponents‚Äîeven
those who live abroad. While resigning, Abramovich will still fund several ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù sporting projects.
Russian oilmen are not the only
ones suffering at the hands of Putin‚Äôs
henchmen.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC Chief
Executive Officer Jeroen van der Veer
is also in a tough spot after having to
do a deal with Putin‚Äôs regime, which
has finally reduced his company‚Äôs
stake in the beleaguered Sakhalin-2
project.
After weathering months of blackmail from Russia‚Äôs environmental authorities, who shut down construction
work on the project, Van der Veer‚Äî
along with colleagues at Mitsui & Co
and Mitsubishi Corp.‚Äîfinally gave in.
The terms under which Shell and
partners surrendered to Gazprom
control of the Sakhalin-2 project
have still not been fully revealed. That
leaves Van der Veer the unenviable
task of explaining to shareholders the
consequences of their investment in
Putin‚Äôs Russia. ‚ú¶

company will employ 31,000 people.
The companies said personnel reductions in overlapping functions are
expected to be ‚Äúlimited and take place
through internal replacement or natural
turnover.‚Äù
The proposed merger is subject to
approval by general meetings of Statoil
and Hydro and by regulatory authorities. General meetings of both companies are slated for second-quarter 2007,
and final closing is expected to be in
next year‚Äôs third quarter.
The new firm will be based in
Stavanger. Group functions will be in
both Stavanger and Oslo, however, and
the chief executive officer will operate
out of both locations.

Gazprom buys into SEIC
Existing SEIC partners each will
dilute their stakes by 50% interest. Shell
will retain a 27.5% stake, Mitsui 12.5%
interest, and Mitsubishi 10% interest.
SEIC will remain operator of the Sakhalin-2 project.
Gazprom will be the majority SEIC
shareholder, and Shell will continue its
role as technical advisor.
The consortium‚Äôs focus is completion of Sakhalin-2 on schedule, allowing LNG to be delivered to Japan, Korea,
and the North American West Coast. All
existing LNG sales contracts will remain
effective.
Alexey Miller, Gazprom chairman,
said, ‚ÄúGazprom is implementing the
strategy of strengthening its positions
on LNG markets. Entering Sakhalin-2
project that involves production and
marketing of LNG is an important step
towards this objective.‚Äù
Gazprom and existing SEIC shareholders plan an Area of Mutual Interest
arrangement covering future Sakhalin
oil and gas exploration and production
opportunities as well as the building of
Sakhalin II into a regional oil and LNG
hub.
Separately, Shell, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi reached agreement with the Russian
Ministry of Industry and Energy as the
authorized state body for the supervi-

sion of production sharing agreements
regarding Sakhalin-2.
The project had been under pressure
from the Russian government, which
withdrew key environmental permits
from Shell and its Japanese partners. As
a result of the withdrawn permits, construction on the project had effectively
come to a halt (OGJ Online, Dec. 7,
2006).
Daniel Barcelo, an analyst with Banc
of America Securities, said terms call
for Gazprom to be considered a partner
from the start of the project, which
means it could be retroactively held
responsible for any environmental liabilities.
‚ÄúIn our opinion, the environmental
regulator, RosPrirodNadzor, is unlikely
to find against Sakhalin Energy in its
ongoing audit nor delay the project
further,‚Äù Barcelo said.

WoodMac: Gulf of Mexico key for merging Statoil-Norsk Hydro
The merger of Statoil ASA‚Äôs and
Norsk Hydro ASA‚Äôs oil and gas businesses will create an upstream player
whose most important future international operations will be in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Wood Mackenzie
analysts said.
‚ÄúFor both companies exploration,
particularly in the deep water, has
been a key focus,‚Äù WoodMac said in a
research note. ‚ÄúIn particular, the US
deepwater Gulf of Mexico is a key target area for each.‚Äù
Both Statoil and Hydro recently
acquired assets in the gulf. Statoil
had exited the gulf previously and
then returned to the deepwater
gulf in 2004 through a transaction
with Chevron. Later, Statoil acquired
Encana Corp.‚Äôs deepwater assets for $2
billion and Anadarko Petroleum Corp.‚Äôs
assets for $900 million (OGJ, Nov. 10,
2006, p. 36).

3.55% interest in Great Lakes, TransCanada will directly own 53.55% of
Great Lakes and will become the operator. Great Lakes now is operated by a
company jointly owned by affiliates of
El Paso and TransCanada.
In a separate transaction, TC PipeLines LP will acquire 46.45% of Great
Lakes from El Paso for $962 million,
subject to closing adjustments, including
$212 million of assumed debt.
TransCanada is the General Partner and
a common unit holder (13.4% interest)
of TC Pipelines LP.

‚ÄúThe acquisitions have given Statoil
stakes in the world class Tahiti project
as well as other high proÔ¨Åle potential
developments such as Knotty Head, Big
Foot, and Jack,‚Äù WoodMac said. ‚ÄúNorsk
Hydro also signiÔ¨Åcant increases its
interests in the deepwater GOM area
with the $2.45 billion acquisition of
Spinnaker.‚Äù
Spinnaker‚Äôs assets included the
producing Front Runner Ô¨Åeld and a
number of development projects in
the Independent Hub platform area.
Hydro acquired Spinnaker in 2005 (OGJ
Online, Sept. 19, 2005).
Analysts expect that more acquisitions could be forthcoming once the
merger is completed.
‚ÄúIn our view, we expect to see
further moves to develop and grow the
international business,‚Äù WoodMac said.
‚ÄúWith the much improved economies
of scale, there will be increased op-

ing interest of 91.1%, with an average
70.2% net revenue interest.
The acquisition consists primarily of proved developed producing gas
properties, with current net production
of about 190 MMcfd of gas equivalent
from about 350 producing wells, of
which 96% are operated. The properties
produce from the Lower Cotton Valley
formation.
Proved reserves are pegged at 466
bcf, of which 446 bcf is proved developed and 20 bcf is proved undeveloped.
EXCO will continue evaluating the
properties to identify additional exploitation and development opportunities.

The combined company has commercial interests in 15 countries
outside Norway. In Africa, this includes
stakes in onshore Algeria, deepwater
Nigeria, and Libya.
‚ÄúOther key assets include the Sincor
heavy oil project in Venezuela‚Äôs Orinoco
Belt and the deepwater Chinook project
in Brazil,‚Äù WoodMac said. ‚ÄúIn addition,

will be assumed by EXCO.
The acquisition will be financed
with a new revolving credit facility
and a bridge loan from EXCO‚Äôs banking group. EXCO expects to finalize its
financing plans in January.
EXCO Chief Executive Officer Douglas H. Miller said cash flow from the
Vernon and Ansley assets will be used
to accelerate development of EXCO‚Äôs
1,100 drilling sites in the area and will
also produce accelerated activity on
its 85,000 net acres of undeveloped
leaseholds.
In East Texas and North Louisiana,
with the Vernon and Ansley assets,
EXCO will have about 300 MMcfd of
gas equivalent of current production
and more than 1 tcf of proved reserves,
the company said.
The company‚Äôs total current production with the Vernon and Ansley
assets will approach 400 MMcfd
of gas equivalent and total proved
reserves will be 1.8 tcf of gas equivalent. ‚ú¶

Most exploration on the Gulf of
Mexico shelf off Louisiana and Texas has
been based on the search for the types
of traps in which oil and gas have previously been found.
The first question that arises is which
types of trap have been the most successful for oil and gas reserves in the
gulf, and the second question is what
reservoir properties can be expected in
those trap types.
All oil and gas traps in a series of
data published by the University of
Texas Bureau of Economic Geology1
may be classified as structural or stratigraphic traps.

Structural traps accounted for 93%
of the reported traps on the gulf shelf,
94% of the released oil reserve data, and
91% of the released gas reserve data.
Stratigraphic traps accounted for 7% of
the reported traps, 6% of the released
oil reserve data, and 9% of the released
gas reserve data.
Twelve types of traps in the Gulf of
Mexico have information about reservoir properties publicly
available, and
11 types have
information
about oil and
gas reserves.
One type of
trap, patch reefs, has no oil or gas
reserves published, so only property
values were included.

cluded production depths, thickness of
pay zones, productive area, and producing formation porosity, temperature,
and pressure. Unless data are released
about deepwater reservoirs in the gulf,
reviews must be limited to wells drilled
to 22,600 ft or less in 3,300 ft of water
or less.

Field demographics
Published data on reservoir properties in the Gulf of Mexico are limited
and show considerable variation.
For the published properties, the
depth of production averaged 7,842 ft
and ranged from 750 ft to 22,600 ft.
Pay thickness averaged 47 ft and
ranged from 2 ft to 490 ft.
Productive area averaged 1,070 acres
and ranged from 5 acres to 26,404
acres.

Porosity averaged 29% and ranged
from 5% to 39%.
Formation temperature averaged
171¬∞ F. and ranged from 80¬∞ to 414¬∞ F.
Formation pressure averaged 4,084
psi and ranged from 520 psi to 15,938
psi.
Water saturation averaged 29% and
ranged from 7% to 80%.
Water depth of traps averaged 133 ft
and ranged from 3 ft to 3,318 ft.
For comparison, average data for
each reservoir property value along
with low and high values were determined for each trap type.

Oil reserves
Fig. 1a shows the distribution of oil
reserves by trap type for areas on which
data had been released. Structural traps
include types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, and

11. The largest share of oil reserves was
34% in traps on the flanks of salt or
shale diapirs (Type 3).
Traps on the flanks of salt or shale diapirs (Type 3), faulted anticlines (Type
1), and traps with normal faults (Type
2) had 68% of the total oil reserves.
Stratigraphic trap types 6, 7, and 9,
had 7% of the oil reserves.
Fig. 1B shows the distribution of gas
reserves by each trap type released. The
largest share of gas reserves was 30%
of the total in faulted anticlines (Type
1). Three trap types, faulted anticlines
(Type 1), normal faults (Type 2), and
flank traps on salt or shale diapirs (Type
3) had 74% of the total gas reserves.
Stratigraphic traps had 7% of the total
gas reserves. Percent of oil and gas
reserves for Oligocene and Jurassic traps
were not shown on the graphs.

Many wells operated
by Arabian Gulf Oil Co (AGOCO) in the

Water containing H2S from the Paleocene zone between 5,500 and 6,000
ft caused corrosion that resulted in the
95‚ÅÑ8-in. casing losing about 1‚ÅÑ8-in./year
in its wall thickness and eventually led
to casing leaks. The water influx into
the wellbore dumped water into the

Squeeze cementing of these leaks
proved to be only a temporary or difficult solution; hence AGOCO initiated
the tie-back project.

based on the respective well situation
and the severity of the leak in the 95‚ÅÑ8in. casing.
The first approach used single-stage
cementing to bring cement to surface.
This involved pumping a lightweight,
10-13.6 ppg, lead cement slurry followed by a small volume of 15.6 ppg
tail slurry to ensure good cement
around the 7-in. stinger and the bottom
two 7-in. tie-back string joints.
This procedure called for a top and
bottom cement plug preceded by and
followed with good spacers. The spacers
were fresh water or a chemical wash.
Added friction reducer optimized the
44

slurry cementing and displacement
pressures. This approach landed the tieback string as cemented.
The second approach involved twostage cementing with the first stage
having a slurry volume that covered the
annulus to above the top of the leak in
the 95‚ÅÑ8-in. casing. The slurry consisted
of a lightweight, 10-13.6 ppg, lead
cement followed by a small volume of
15.6 ppg.
This procedure required an 8-hr
waiting on cement time before pumping of the second stage. This sealed off a
leaky top of liner or a leaky 95‚ÅÑ8-in. casing. The second stage consisted of lightweight cement circulated to surface.

The third approach was short
cementing. When the well had severe
losses through the 95‚ÅÑ8-in. casing leak
or the 7-in. top of liner, it indicated
that the overlap was not cemented and
cementing pressure could exceed the
formation leak off pressure below the
95‚ÅÑ8-in. casing.
In this case, AGOCO used a short cementing approach in which the cement

stinger and up to 150 ft above it.
The following factors determined the
cementing procedure:
‚Ä¢ Depth of the existing 7-in. top of liner. A
deeper liner top has higher hydrostatic
and dynamic pressures imposed by the
cementing operation. This may cause
the breaking down of the formation below the 95‚ÅÑ8-in. shoe or losses to a thief
zone behind the 95‚ÅÑ8-in. casing, leading
to water influx, flash setting, pumping
off the 7-in. tie-back string, or pumping off the stinger.
‚Ä¢ Cementing the existing 7-in. liner. This is
influenced by the overlap length and cement condition such as a leaky remedial
cement squeeze. Most primary 7-in.

leak. The Paleocene H2S water zone is
thick. Some wells have very long leaking zones caused by water migrating up
and down the 121‚ÅÑ2-95‚ÅÑ8-in. annulus.
‚Ä¢ Cement job duration. The job needs
to design a point of departure that
accounts for all possibilities while
cementing. This may lead to over-retardation, long setting times that may

casing. This may open the leak further
or breakdown the formation below the
overlap.
‚Ä¢ Cement mixing water. The water is
from local water wells and has seasonally variable salinity; so the jobs require
lab water tests from the respective
source well.
‚Ä¢ Paleocene water effect on cement slurry.
Paleocene water influx may contaminate
the cement or lead to flash setting of
the cement, increasing displacement
pressures or deteriorating the cement.
‚Ä¢ Cement spacer. The design of the
spacer should ensure a lengthy protection of the slurry so that it is not
contaminated by existing annular fluids
that may contain some of the Paleocene
water.
‚Ä¢ Prediction of fluid and cement loss in the
overlap and the leaky 95‚ÅÑ8-in. casing. The design should include slurry weight and
rheology that optimizes cementing and
displacement pressures for mitigating
fluid losses and influx. ‚ú¶

Using well repair technology to
withdraw and replace damaged casing,
only a section of failed casing needs to
be removed. The failed well section can
be rehabilitated perfectly; successful
restoration of deep well casing sections
in the Daqing field has been nearly
100%. Leakproof pressurization tests
after repair produce the same result as
that of newly drilled wells. Thus, various augmented injection means can be
achieved.
This relatively thorough well repair
method will be used more and more
widely in oil field development. With
increasing experience and maturity, this
technology will be refined and eventually applied in production sections
or even used throughout the entire
wellbore.

future operations to prevent sticking the
string.

Increasing casing failures in Daqing oil field have aggravated damage
to wells. A new method to repair these
failures removes and replaces damaged
casing with a sleeve milling pipe string.
This is an economic and efficient
well repair method, particularly for
long well sections or wells with multiple casing failure points. It is also
useful in small-diameter wells with
casing failures that cannot be refitted
or strengthened because of the reduced
diameter.
But the application and development
of this technology is restricted in deep
well repair because the size of sleeve
tool is relatively large and the annular
clearance, relatively small. This leads
to the serious problem of sticking the
sleeve milling pipe string.
This article derives a mathematical
relation between the sticking force and
the longest rest time allowable for a
sleeve tool in a well. Using computation
along with site operation data can guide

high density of workover fluid puts a
pressure difference on the pipe string,
which is the main reason that casing
strings get stuck during withdrawal or
replacement.
This article presents a comprehensive
mathematical and mechanical analysis
of the mechanism of sticking due to the
pressure difference. It provides a mathematical model to calculate maximum
allowable rest time and suggests corresponding preventive measures in order
to prevent a string from getting stuck.

Theoretical modeling
String sticking due to a pressure
difference means that a segment of the
string squeezes into the mud cake and
is held tightly in the mud cake by the
positive differential pressure caused by
the liquid head of the workover fluid
and the reservoir pressure.

As a result of the interaction with
mud cake and workover fluid, the string
cannot move. This phenomenon mostly
occurs in permeable strata, where thick
mud cake is prone to develop.
Deriving and constructing a model
in which string is prevented from getting stuck under the pressure difference
followed these assumptions:
‚Ä¢ The borehole face is rigid, and the
influence between the string and the
borehole face is considered in the friction coefficient.
‚Ä¢ The gravitational, frictional, and
adhesive forces acting on the string unit
are uniformly distributed.
‚Ä¢ The string unit for computing is
regarded as a spatial circular arc curve.
‚Ä¢ The friction coefficient, the adhesive force coefficient, and the density of
workover fluid in a certain well section

are regarded as constants.
‚Ä¢ The string above the upper tangency point contacts consecutively with
the borehole face.
Imagine that a section of string with
a length, L, contacts the borehole face
(Fig. 1). Equation 1 gives the relations
based on an infinitesimal surface area
dA on the contact face. Equation 2
shows the pressure difference between
the workover fluid and the reservoir
that acts on dA.
Several factors influence the reservoir
hydrostatic column pressure gradient:
fluid density, salt concentration, gas
strength, and temperature gradient.
High salt concentration will increase
the hydrostatic column pressure gradient, and the increase of dissolved gas
and the rising of temperature will make
the hydrostatic column pressure gradient decrease.

the adhesive looping angle Œ∏ is given in
Equations 7 and 8.
The thickness of mud cake is related
to the performance of workover fluid
and formation factors, predominantly
the permeability. The magnitude of
water loss of the workover fluid is the
dominant factor influencing the accretion of mud cake.
Under Darcy‚Äôs formula, the percolation ratio through medium can be
expressed as shown in Equations 9 and
10.1
According to the relation between
the filtrate volume of workover fluid
and the solid content, Equation 11 can
be drawn.
Inserting Equation 11 into Equation
10 will represent the relation between
the mud cake thickness, Z, and the
percolation time, t, resulting in Equation 12.
Equations 4 and 6 are the integral
forms used to calculate the total friction
force and adhesive force acting on the
string. In practice, each meter length
chosen from the contact face between
the string and the borehole face can
be used as the integrating block. That
is, divide the entire length from top to
bottom into L equal units, and the well
depth corresponding to the i unit is h
= H + i √ó 1(1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ L). Thus Equation
13 expresses the total friction force, and
Equation 14 shows the total adhesive
force.
Equation 12, which calculates the
thickness of mud cake, is transformed
into Equation 15. Equation 16 shows
the minimum ‚Äúunfreezing force‚Äù
required in order to prevent the string
from getting stuck.

workover fluid will change into Fb cosŒ±.
The friction force and the adhesive
force that the sleeve tool is subjected
to are Ff cosŒ± and Fa cosŒ±, respectively
(Equation 17). Meanwhile, the side
force that the string applies on the
borehole face will increase the friction
force between the string and the mud
cake with an increment, Fbf sinŒ±, so
that Equation 16 can be rewritten as
Equation 17.

The results of computing with the
data obtained from two wells: North

that the permeability, K, affects the rest

and field trials.

reducer represents one of the most
difficult and complex shapes to monitor and analyze because the diameter
change from top to bottom produces
nonuniform stresses and there is a
nonuniform thickness along and across
the wall.
Ultrasonic testing (UT) technology
was used to determine a baseline for
the initial WT and subsequently to validate periodically the fiber-optic sensor
measurements. Although the monitoring took place over the relatively short
period of 6 months, a trend of WT
losses was demonstrated with both
technologies.
It is important to point out that the
WT loss measured during the monitoring period is within the accepted error
range of the UT technology. Therefore,
the precision of the FOS can be verified
when the thickness loss exceeds the UT
error range or during destructive testing of the reducer.
The average value of remaining WT
obtained by FOS measurements is a
slightly lower thickness than the values
obtained by UT. Nonetheless, the trend
of the thickness loss is consistent for
each sensor location when compared to
initial and final UT readings. Therefore,
these results clearly show that the FOS
technology can measure WT loss and
it should be used for this purpose on
critical areas that require continuous or
periodic monitoring.

Conventional technique
Most onshore and offshore oil and
gas facilities, including upstream and
downstream plants such as gas-oil separation plants, pipelines, and refineries
rely on conventional corrosion-monitoring techniques or periodic inspection as a means of corrosion management.
In general, accuracy, frequency of
data collection, and cost are significant factors for the overall corrosion
monitoring or corrosion-management
program. With regards to conventional
corrosion-monitoring techniques, users
normally rely on corrosion coupons
made from materials similar to the
pipes that are intended to be monitored
or use intrusive corrosion-monitoring probes based on electrochemistry
measurements.
Both corrosion coupons and electrochemistry-based corrosion monitoring
techniques, however, depend upon the
principle of corrosivity measurements
of the carried media. These types of
measurements may not reflect the real
changes occurring to the actual pipe or
vessel. In many cases, data obtained by
such indirect measurement techniques
are not fully reliable and may provide
misleading information to operators. In
the operation of a large network of oil
and gas facilities, this practice creates an
undesirable risk.

Collection of the gas begins in the
kingdom‚Äôs eastern oil fields, where it
is separated from crude oil in one of
34 gas-oil separation plants (GOSPs)
and piped to strategically located
gas plants. At those plants, the gas is
treated to remove sulfur compounds
and carbon dioxide.
The main reason for installing the
FOS system on a reducer in one of the
system‚Äôs gas processing plants in the

Eastern Province was to identify issues
related to plant operation that may not
be typically encountered in laboratory
testing. The 20-in. x 12-in. reducer (Fig.
1) in the de-ethanizer section of a light
crude stabilization plant was selected
because of a history of high corrosion
rates of up to 3 mm/year (118 mpy)
caused by the sour gas (C1 = 15%; C2
= 35%; C3+ = 33%; CO2 = 7%; H2S =

and a typical throughput of 1.5 million

no cleaning is required.
7. Sensor is made of glass fiber (no
metals) and carries no electrical current.
The sensor carries only light; therefore it is safe for plant equipment and
personnel.
8. There is no interference with
other wireless or plant instruments.
Results obtained out of this work
show that the fiber-optic system can
monitor high rates of WT losses. The
precision of the measurement will be
determined in future work. Following is
a list of the main findings of this work:
1. The research program produced
the desired results in developing the
nonintrusive fiber-optic sensor system
for monitoring pressurized pipes and
vessels in terms of a high rate of wall
thinning and changes in temperature
and pressure.
2. The FOS technology proved to
be, through laboratory and field testing,
a good monitoring technique for WT
losses of components of the pressurized
system. Therefore, this technology is a
suitable choice whenever UT scans and
other inspection or monitoring techniques become impractical in terms of
frequency of inspection required, cost,
and reliability of other techniques.
3. The FOS system is not standalone
equipment that can be purchased and
used without developing some expertise at undertaking site surveys for
installation, development of a database
for each site, and data analysis. Therefore, it requires a certain level of initial
involvement with the manufacturer and
technical support in most cases.
4. This FOS technology is recommended to be further explored in terms
of field and laboratory trials for other
applications such as leak detection, and
refinery overhead line corrosion monitoring. ‚ú¶

Refinery fuels costs have endured an
unsteady course since 2003. As shown
in the accompanying table, most of the
PADD residual fuels‚Äô increases in cost
occurred in 2004 and 2005 for all five
PADDs. PADD 4 experienced the least
variance while PADD 3 incurred the
highest variance in price over the period.
The cost for natural gas for refinery
usage decreased a fair amount through
2003, and then increased during 2004
and dramatically in 2005. These conclusions are based on costs of an average
refinery fuel consisting of 1 bbl each
of PADDs 1-5 and an average US cost

ENVIRONMENTAL
MITIGATION‚Äî1

Hard-live bottom
areas affected by the
2001 construction of
Gulfstream Natural Gas
System LLC‚Äôs 36-in.,
Pipelines
419-mile offshore
pipeline between Mobile
Bay, Ala. and Tampa Bay, Fla. have largely
recovered, in the face of permitting expectations that this process would take
roughly
100
years.
The
term
‚Äúhardlive
bottom‚Äù
refers to seafloor that is both hard (as
opposed to such other possibilities as
sandy, silty, etc.) and life-sustaining.
Community structure does not appear
to be significantly different between
reference and affected areas. Visible
disturbance also appears to be minimal
as compared to predicted effects.

prepared a federal mitigation plan that
established the monitoring and mitigation protocols to be implemented
to satisfy permit conditions. This plan
required Gulfstream to conduct monitoring activities to determine the extent
and severity of project construction
effects on hard-live bottom areas within
the trench corridor and associated spoil
mounds and anchor strike-cable sweep
locations.
Part 1 of this article, presented here,
details the methodology of Gulfstream‚Äôs
monitoring activities. Subsequent parts
will discuss the results of its monitoring program and examine the use of
pipeline habitat replacement structures
by fish and epifauna.
Gulfstream established and monitored random 25-m transects perpendicular to the trench corridor and spoil
mounds, within identified anchor strike
and cable sweep locations in hard-live
bottom areas, and also in unaffected
hard-live bottom reference habitats.

Background

The federal mitigation plan considered depth to be a key variable in
hard-live bottom recovery due to the
specifications of pipeline siting and
biological community characteristics.
In waters less than 200-ft deep, Gulfstream lowered the pipeline into an
excavated trench with the expectation
that the trench spoil would naturally
backfill over time. During construction,
hard substrate in some areas prevented
excavation of a trench with a postlay
plow. Pipeline anchors stabilized these
portions of the pipeline. Plans did not
require the pipeline to be trenched
beyond the 200-ft contour.
The hard-live bottom habitat at all
water depths along the route generally
consists of low-relief algal sponge communities of algae, sponges, bryozoans,
ascideans, and ahermatypic hard corals,
with octocorals dominant in shallower
depths.
To assess potential depth-related
effects on hard-live bottom recovery,
Gulfstream stratified the monitoring
design into three depth zones; Depth

Hard-live bottom makes up the
most significant and sensitive marine
benthic resource in the federal waters
portion of the Gulfstream pipeline (Fig.
1). Gulfstream conducted numerous
pre-construction field investigations of
the biological distribution and physical
characteristics of hard-live bottom near
the pipeline route and reduced potential damage through not only its siting
efforts but also use of technologies such
as the submarine plow and the deployment of buoys on construction barge
anchor cables.
US Army Corps of Engineers and
Minerals Management Service permits and Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission certificate requirements
obligated Gulfstream to measure and
mitigate effects of the construction of
the marine pipeline and to monitor the
recovery of affected areas.

the survey transects and ROV positioning.
‚Ä¢ ROV. A Phantom S2 remotely operated vehicle collected all video data unless otherwise specified. The ROV uses a
high-resolution video camera to quantify sampling stations (e.g., transects,
boundary delineations) and document
general site conditions. Hypack navigational software, coupled with the ROV
Trackpoint system, allowed for realtime positioning information.
‚Ä¢ Digital still camera. An Olympus Camedia C-5060 wide-angle digital camera
with 5.1 megapixel capacity collected
transect and photostation photographs.
An Olympus PT-020 underwater housing with a retractable rod affixed to the
bottom of the housing held the camera.
The retractable rod allowed divers
to accurately maintain a fixed distance
from the seafloor during photograph
collection and subsequently maintain a
fixed scale in each transect photograph
for analysis.
The camera flash and two diver
lights mounted on the camera housing provided lighting for the transect
photographs.

Transect establishment
Gulfstream established a total of 136
transects within the stratified depth
zones in compliance with the federal
mitigation plan (Table 1). All transects
contained hard-live bottom habitat. Survey divers collected photograph transect
data in Depth Zone 1. Either survey
divers or ROV collected transect data in
Depth Zones 2 and 3.
The analysis used randomly selected
25-m transect lengths within both affected and unaffected hard-live bottom
areas to facilitate comparison. Gulfstream established the random transects
perpendicular to the pipeline to assess
trenched pipeline corridor, reference
habitat, and anchor strike areas.
Transect coordinates provided to
the field survey crews and entered into
the vessel‚Äôs navigation system before
deployment allowed the survey vessel
to navigate to the appropriate locations,
where either survey divers or ROV were
deployed.
Survey divers navigated to each
Depth Zone 1 transect coordinate

end point marker. After establishing
the transect end points, survey divers

measured each transect with a weighted
tape measure to verify the transect
length.
In Depth Zones 2 and 3, survey divers used one end point coordinate and a
defined azimuth for each transect. After
navigating to the end point, survey divers extended a weighted tape measurer
25 m along the defined azimuth direction and established the second transect
end point. The digital still camera then
collected photographs along the transect length.
Collecting sequential, overlapping
photographs that contained a clear view
of the tape measure within each frame
ensured complete transect coverage
and photograph position references. An
ROV first navigated to one transect end
point coordinate utilizing the Hypack
Integrated Navigation System to ensure
accurate positioning. Once at the end
point, the ROV navigated down the
length of each transect, collecting video
2 ft above the seafloor. The ROV‚Äôs twopoint laser system ensured consistent
height above the substrate.
Reference habitat transects represent
delineated hard-live bottom areas close
to the pipeline corridor but not affected
by project construction activities. These
transects serve as a reference for statistical comparison to affected hard-live
bottom areas. Comparisons between the
two allowed assessment of the effect of
pipeline construction.
Delineating of hard-live bottom areas
relatively close to the pipeline route
took place before pipeline construction, during the permitting phase of
the project. The survey team entered
hard-live bottom polygons, the pipeline
corridor route, and depth-zone demarcations into a GIS. Unaffected hard-live
bottom polygons outside the pipeline
corridor served as potential reference
habitat transect locations. GIS then randomly selected 10 transect coordinates
per depth zone.
Routing the pipeline to avoid large
areas of hard-live bottom minimized
potential effects on these areas within
the trenched pipeline corridor. Further
precautions included use of construc60

tion methods determined to significantly reduce hard-live bottom damage
during pipeline lowering.
Plans called for the pipeline to be
placed in an excavated trench 3 ft below
the natural seafloor elevation in water
less than 200-ft deep. This approach
would provide pipeline stability under
severe storm conditions based on storm
models. Predictions foresaw trenching
impacts 75-ft wide, based on a 25-ft
wide trench corridor, with associated
spoil mounds spreading 25 ft to either
side of the trench. The anticipation that
the trench would backfill through natural sediment transport made backfilling
in federal waters unnecessary. Plans did
not require trenching the pipeline corridor in water more than 200-ft deep.

when the barges are winched forward
with anchors in place.
A portion of the heavy anchor cable
rests and sweeps along the seafloor
in an arc as the barge is pulled ahead.
Gulfstream minimized potential damage
from anchor handling by attempting
to place the anchors in areas where
hard-live bottom did not occur and by
using midline buoys on anchor cables
to minimize the size of cable sweeps.

Lease bluster
raises question
about ‚Äònew cop‚Äô
‚ÄúWhen the new Democratic Congress
takes ofÔ¨Åce in January, there will be a
new cop on the beat to force every big oil
company that is currently lining its pockets
with taxpayer dollars [to] come back to the
negotiating table.‚Äù
That‚Äôs from Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.),
responding to a US Department of the
Interior announcement that Ô¨Åve oil and gas
companies have agreed to pay royalties not

T h e
E d i t o r ‚Äô s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

required by leases they hold to deepwater
acreage in the Gulf of Mexico (OGJ Online,
Dec. 15, 2006).
‚ÄúThe Bush administration‚Äôs Interior Department and the big oil and gas companies
that have cheated taxpayers out of billions
in revenues for drilling on public lands
have run out of time,‚Äù Markey said. ‚ÄúTheir
too little, too late efforts to recoup only a
small percentage of the billions of dollars
of oil and gas royalties that the American
people are rightfully owed is pitiful.‚Äù
What‚Äôs pitiful is Markey‚Äôs distortion of
the issue.
On Dec. 14, Interior announced that BP
PLC, ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil Corp.,
Shell Oil Co., and Walter Oil & Gas Corp.
had agreed to pay full royalties starting Oct.
1 on production from deepwater leases issued in 1998-99.
Unlike those issued in other years providing limited relief for deepwater production, the 1998-99 leases lack price thresholds that cancel the incentive when oil and
gas prices are high.
The widespread assumption in Washington is that omission of the thresholds
reÔ¨Çects bureaucratic oversight. So some
companies have chosen to renegotiate
their deepwater leases and forgo relief they
acknowledge they don‚Äôt need with commodity prices at current levels.
The companies haven‚Äôt cheated taxpayers out of anything. According to the leases
in question‚Äîcontracts with the US government‚Äîthe American people are in fact
not owed the ‚Äúbillions of dollars‚Äù Markey
claims.
What‚Äôs more, the mistake, if that‚Äôs what
it was, happened when Markey‚Äôs party ran
the Executive Branch.
Renegotiation of the leases, on most of
which production hasn‚Äôt even begun, is a
benign act by the leaseholders. Discrediting
them for it is politically opportunistic and
raises a disturbing question: Does January‚Äôs new cop understand law?

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Little reaction seen to second OPEC reduction
Despite knee-jerk purchases that hiked the January contract for benchmark
US crudes to $63.43/bbl by Dec. 15, the highest closing in weeks on the New York
market, there was little immediate reaction after the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries agreed Dec. 14 to trim production by 500,000 b/d to 25.8 million
b/d, effective Feb. 1, ‚Äúin order to balance supply and demand.‚Äù
In October, OPEC ministers voted to reduce crude output by 1.2 million b/d to
26.3 million b/d effective Nov. 1. Although many industry observers said OPEC had
curtailed only 800,000 b/d at most, OPEC ofÔ¨Åcials claimed at the December meeting
their earlier agreement ‚Äúsucceeded in stabilizing the market and bringing it into balance, although prices remain volatile.‚Äù
OPEC‚Äôs latest promised reduction ‚Äúbasically comes out to nothing,‚Äù said Olivier
Jakob at Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. ‚ÄúIt is only illustrative of the disagreement within OPEC of the need for any further cuts, buying some more time and
letting the market dictate through prices what should be the next step for OPEC,‚Äù
Jakob said. ‚ÄúIf there is a strong price crash then OPEC would cut (but this would
be expected anyway); if there is a price increase it will continue to not respect the
previous agreement (this is also somehow expected). OPEC could not comply [with
the earlier proposed production cut] below $60/bbl, so we should not expect them to
comply better above $60/bbl.‚Äù
Moreover, he said, ‚ÄúWe are somehow back to having Saudi Arabia as the swing
balancing producer. While the rest of OPEC will continue with the cheating, this creates a framework where it takes a longer period of time to signiÔ¨Åcantly tighten the
crude oil supply and demand.‚Äù
Dollar declines
The ‚Äúadditional problem‚Äù for OPEC since its October meeting is the dollar index
has dropped 4%, ‚Äúwhich in terms of OPEC revenues is equivalent to an additional
production cut,‚Äù said Jakob. While crude prices were higher in mid-December than
mid-October, the weakness of the US dollar offset those price gains and reduced
OPEC‚Äôs revenue. ‚ÄúOPEC would need a stronger dollar to encourage less cheating and
better enforce their output cut decisions,‚Äù Jakob said. Meanwhile, the US dollar fell
to a four-session low against the euro on Dec. 19.
Analysts in the Houston ofÔ¨Åce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, ‚ÄúThe
decision to curtail production for the second time comes on the back of high crude
stockpiles in the US and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
nations, concerns of slowing global growth in 2007, and the pullback in the greenback that has eroded the purchasing power of OPEC members. Going forward, the
market will remain skeptical as to the magnitude of the announced cut that will actually be taken off the market come February.‚Äù
Nevertheless, Raymond James analysts said: ‚ÄúThe cartel seems determined to
continue its quest to defend $60/bbl as a price Ô¨Çoor for crude oil. On a further note,
the cartel has approved the induction of its newest member, Angola. The secondlargest producer in Africa will join the cartel in 2007, adding strength to OPEC‚Äôs
muscle.‚Äù Because it has not yet returned to its prewar production level, Iraq is not
subject to OPEC production quotas.
Meanwhile, Raymond James said, ‚ÄúUnrest in Nigeria continues to take a toll on
oil production. Armed guerrillas attacked a Royal Dutch Shell oil complex in Nigeria
and abducted three employees. The incident has forced Shell to shut in 12,000 b/d
in production.‚Äù Civil unrest and violence in the oil-rich Niger River delta have shut in
600,000-800,000 b/d of crude production, industry sources report.
The January crude contract fell to $62.21/bbl Dec. 18 as traders focused on
forecasts of warmer-than-normal weather over most of the US, but it expired at
$63.15/bbl Dec. 19 in expectation that US crude inventories would fall for the fourth
consecutive week. The Energy Information Administration reported Dec. 20 a 6.3
million bbl plunge in commercial US crude stocks to 329.1 million bbl in the week
ended Dec. 15. Gasoline inventories jumped by 1 million bbl to 200.9 million bbl in
the same period. Distillate fuel stocks rose by 1.2 million bbl to 133.1 million bbl.
‚ÄúOver the past 2 months, the US oil data have shown a consistent pattern of rapid
tightening with the total inventory overhang having eroded dramatically and with
the fall tilted toward gasoline stocks, which now exhibits a deÔ¨Åcit of 6.2 million bbl
relative to their 5-year average,‚Äù said analysts at Barclay‚Äôs Capital, the investment
banking division of Barclays Bank PLC, London.

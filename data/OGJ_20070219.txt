COVER
Welders make a tie-in weld on the 30-in. portion of 40 miles
of 30-in. and 42-in. Energy Transfer Partners mainline between
Bethel compressor station, Anderson County, Tex., and Reed
compressor station, Freestone County, Tex. The project is part of a
multiphase expansion intended to provide producers in the Bossier
Sand and Barnett shale basins in East and North Texas an outlet
to various markets throughout Texas, as well as to the national
marketplace through downstream interstate pipelines. Such expansions, fueled by continued growth in natural gas demand, have led
to continued growth in proposed pipeline construction projects,
both in North America and around the world. Oil & Gas Journal’s
special report on Worldwide Pipeline Construction, which begins on
p. 48, provides more information on construction trends and plans
for both 2007 and beyond. Photograph from Willbros USA Inc.

Network Convergence Gives Energy Sector
Companies an Edge
By Chuck Pol, President, BT Americas and Ross Burley, Director of Oil & Gas Sales, BT Americas
Global demand for Oil & Gas continues
to grow unabated, and the industry’s
major preoccupation is with replacing
reserves and shortening the
development cycle. But pressure
to increase efficiency and reduce
costs throughout the energy industry
is also on the rise. Companies are
constantly looking for ways to
improve productivity and efficiency.
Taking advantage of changes in
communications can help your
business do both.
Changes in technology are
simplifying and unifying
communications today. Where
once a company needed separate
data, voice and video networks,
all can now be carried seamlessly
over a single, converged network
running on Internet Protocol (IP)
standards. This means increased
efficiency, simplicity, and cost
savings.

Beyond cost cutting
But cost savings and efficiency
aren’t the only benefits of
network convergence. Today’s
networks give companies whole
new ways of operating – ways to
improve collaboration, use
expertise more efficiently, collect
and use data to improve
operations and gain competitive
advantage.

What does this mean to the
energy industry? Many
companies in this sector manage
multiple networks – legacy
systems inherited through
mergers or acquisitions, countryspecific networks, or networks
based on single technologies,
such as satellite communications
to reach remote areas. The
interoperability challenges,
complexity, cost and sometimes
unstable performance of these
networks argues in favor of
implementing a single, global,
converged network, under a
single global service level
agreement.

For example, BT’s Digital
Networked Oilfield solution
provides companies in the
exploration and production
industry with real-time access to
production and exploration data
in a secure, end-to-end managed
environment that improves and
speeds decision-making. By
enabling greater collaboration,
this solution reduces costs, cuts
downtime and increases
production. And it’s based on
BT’s global IP network,
configured to optimize
application performance and
extended through satellite, which
means it can be deployed almost

anywhere. And it’s customizable
to a company’s exact needs.
Why BT?
BT’s network capability is world
class, and is being enhanced with
a $20 billion investment program
to build the “21st Century
Network”. But when operating
globally, implementing new
operational models or supporting
new business models, it’s about
more than just the network – it’s
about experience, expertise and
partnership.
You can rely on BT. We know how
to build a global network
infrastructure, we know how to
design global business models,
we know how to handle
contractual, regulatory and tax
details around the world.
In short, BT helps customers
operate globally. And we’re ready
to help you.

BT can help you gain a
competitive advantage visit

Oil & Gas Sales, at 713.499.3410

GOM ‘top deepwater hunting grounds’ in 2006
Exploration in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico marked an exceptionally successful year during 2006, consultancy Wood Mackenzie
Ltd. said in a recent report entitled “Treasures of the Deep: A Review of 2006 Exploration.”
Zoe Sutherland, WoodMac gulf analyst, called the gulf “one of
the top deepwater hunting grounds in the world.” She told OGJ in
a telephone interview from her Edinburgh office that she believes
2007 will hold similar potential to the 2006 discoveries. “The rate
of exploration activity will stay the same.”
Sutherland said WoodMac’s own early reserves estimates for
2006 discoveries suggest 1.5 billion boe proved and probable reserves in the region. The actual reserves numbers, yet to be booked
by the companies, could prove to be smaller, WoodMac noted.
Over the last 10 years, oil and gas reserves found in the deepwater gulf averaged 1.2 billion boe/year. Both 2004 and 2005 marked
deepwater reserves additions of less than 1 billion boe.
During 2006, highlights included discoveries by BP PLC at
Kaskida and Hess Corp. at Pony. Together these two fields account
for more than half of the reserves found in the region last year.
BP E&P Inc. discovered oil with the Kaskida well on Keathley
Canyon Block 292. Kaskida encountered 800 net ft of hydrocarbon
pay in Lower Tertiary sands. Interests are BP 55%, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. 25%, and Devon Energy Corp. 20% (OGJ Online, Aug.
31, 2006).
Hess said wireline logs of its deepwater Pony prospect on Green
Canyon Block 468 indicate 475 ft of oil-saturated sandstones in
Miocene age reservoirs. Hess drilled the well to 32,448 ft TD (OGJ,
July 24, 2006, Newsletter).
WoodMac noted the number of wells drilled in 2006 increased
marginally compared with 2005, while the number of drilling
days increased by nearly 30%. Deeper, more complex deepwater
exploration led to an average drill time of more than 100 days.
Undoubtedly spurred by successful Lower Tertiary wells in remote areas of the gulf, operators extended their search for the play
into waters closer to shore, WoodMac said. BP drilled its Tamara
prospect in Garden Banks, north of Keathley Canyon, and Hess
spudded a well at Jack Hays in Port Isabel, the most westerly test
of the play so far.

Trial begins for 1999 Erika oil spill
Seven years after the Erika oil tanker spill off Brittany’s Penmarc’h
point, which polluted 400 km of France’s Brittany coastline, 15
accused are facing a trial that began Feb. 12 and is due to last until June 13. It is expected to cost €600,000 (OGJ, Feb. 13, 2006,
Newsletter).
There are 70 parties involved in the case ranging from local
Brittany administrations and associations to Italian and Greek ship

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

owners and environmental activists and associations clamoring for
more-drastic maritime security and transparency.
Total SA is the focus of the trial because the company chartered
the vessel, which was carrying 30,884 tonnes of heavy fuel oil and
broke in two during a storm, releasing 20,000 tonnes of fuel. Total
was indicted Nov. 7, 2001.
Total already has spent €200 million to pump out the fuel in
the wreck, to treat 220,000 tonnes of polluted sand, and to clean
up the coast.
Victims of the spill have obtained €118 million from the Oil
Pollution Compensation Fund and should receive an additional
€40 million when all claims have been dealt with. But damages
claimed amount to practically €1 billion.
The trial also will bring to light the complexities and shortcomings of maritime transport embroiled in the mix of insurers, ship
owners and charterers, convenience flags, negligent certification
companies, and poor managers.
Although certified seaworthy, the 25-year-old tanker had
changed its name and owner eight times, its classification company
four times, and its flag three times, and had been poorly patched
and maintained. The Erika, together with the Prestige off Spain 2
years later, was instrumental in inducing the European Union to
establish stricter rules for tanker age and construction.
It is hoped that the trial will work out the responsibilities of
each accused at every stage of the Erika saga.

Ecuador threatens environmental squeeze
Ecuador President Rafael Correa, who was sworn in last January and is a close ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, said
he might cancel contracts of foreign oil companies that harm the
environment.
Analysts see that as a threat to a Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) block in one of the largest ecological reserves in the world,
Park Yasuni.
Petrobras in 2004 won a license to explore Block 31, part of
which is in a reserve considered one of the world’s most biologically diverse areas and home to primitive tribes.
Petrobras officials were not immediately available for comment,
but the company has said it is using modern technology to avoid
damaging the park.
The Brazilian company has insisted that the project, in which
Teikoku is a partner, will affect only 100 hectares of the Yasuni
reserve, which borders Peru.
The Ecuadorian economy got a $1.1 billion boost from the confiscation of Occidental Petroleum Corp.’s Block 15 in May 2006 and
a new hydrocarbon tax, which together bumped up the country’s
total 2006 oil revenue to about $3.8 billion, say local analysts (OGJ,
May 22, 2006, Newsletter).

Total makes two oil ﬁnds on Angola’s Block 32

Colombia gets two-zone Upper Magdalena ﬁnd

Total SA reported making two oil discoveries on deepwater
Block 32 off Angola.
The Manjericão-1 well tested more than 5,000 b/d of oil from
Oligocene oil-bearing reservoirs. This discovery is 38 km northwest of the Gengibre-1 discovery made in 2004. Total said the discovery shows “there is additional resource potential in the previously unexplored central area” of the block. The well was drilled in
1,977 m of water in the central part of Block 32.
The second well, Caril-1, produced 6,300 b/d of light oil from
a selected interval in Oligocene oil-bearing reservoirs. It was drilled
in 1,673 m of water in the northeastern part of Block 32, about 18
km north-northwest of the Gindungo-1, and 7 km west-southwest
of Cola-1, discoveries that were made in 2003 and 2004, respectively.
Total said technical studies are being carried out to fully evaluate these drilling results, and further exploration drilling is under
way across the block.
Total holds a 30% interest in Block 32 and serves as operator.
Other partners in Block 32 are Marathon Oil Co. 30%, Sonangol EP
20%, Esso E&P Angola (Overseas) Ltd. 15%, and Petrogal 5%.

The Hocol subsidiary of Maurel & Prom, Paris, reported a twozone oil discovery at its La Canada Norte-1 ST well on the San
Jacinto/Rio Paez Permit in Colombia’s Upper Magdalena basin.
The well, 250 km southwest of Bogota, stopped at TD 1,006 m
after encountering six zones that contained oil in the Cretaceous
Monserrate and Caballos formations. Combined output of the three
Caballos intervals was 700 b/d of 33-34° gravity oil. Monserrate
flowed 200 b/d of 17-18° gravity oil after frac.
The LCN-1 well, near La Hocha (Monserrate) oil field 100 km
southwest of Neiva, identified proved and probable reserves of 41
million bbl, Maurel & Prom said.
Permit holders are Hocol, operator with 36.67% interest, Cepsa
of Spain 33.33%, and Petrobras 30%.
Maurel & Prom produced 5.2 million b/d in Colombia in 2006.
It acquired the Hocol assets from Knightsbridge Petroleum in mid2005 (OGJ Online, Nov. 4, 2004).
La Hocha field, discovered in 2001, went on production in January 2003 and is still being developed.

Appraisal well extends Syrah ﬁeld in Egypt
Apache Corp., Houston, said its Syrah 5X appraisal well in
Egypt’s Western Desert tested 47.6 MMcfd of gas from the Jurassic
Lower Safa sand, extending Syrah field to the northwest.
The Syrah 5X well targeted the lower 50 ft of Lower Safa pay.
The well flowed from perforations at 14,210-60 ft through a 1-in.
choke with 2,599 psi flowing wellhead pressure.
Syrah field, which lies on the Khalda Concession, is slated to
begin production in third quarter 2008, following completion of
continuing infrastructure expansion in the greater Khalda area.
The field lies 4 miles north of Qasr field, Apache’s largest discovery, which is currently producing 340 MMcfd of gas and 15,800
b/d of condensate from the Lower Safa sand.
Qasr was discovered in 2003 and contains proved reserves of
2.1 tcf of gas and 64.5 million bbl of condensate. This field also is
producing 11,800 b/d of oil from the Cretaceous Alem el Bueib
(AEB), a shallower formation overlying the deeper Lower Safa.
In March 2005, the Syrah 1X discovery well tested 46.5
MMcfd from a correlative zone. The success of Syrah field, along
with newly acquired 3D seismic data, create the potential for further exploration on Apache’s acreage to the north in the Matruh
Concession, where five Jurassic-AEB exploratory tests are planned
this year.
Apache said it is evaluating the Jurassic-AEB potential in the 4
miles between Syrah and Qasr fields.
Apache operates Khalda with a 100% contractor interest.

Lukoil makes ﬁnd on Condor block in Colombia
OAO Lukoil affiliate Lukoil Overseas Colombia Ltd. made an oil
discovery at the Medina structure on the Condor exploration block
in Colombia. The block covers 3,089 sq km in the western Llanos
oil basin and is one of Colombia’s largest exploration blocks.
The find marks Lukoil’s first hydrocarbon discovery in the Western Hemisphere, the company said. There was no report from the
company regarding flow rates or the oil’s properties.
Lukoil Overseas operates the project with 70% interest, while
Colombia’s Ecopetrol National Oil Co. holds 30%.

Anadarko chases Garden Banks subsalt Miocene
Having drilled three noncommercial ultradeep wildcats in the
eastern Garden Banks area of the Gulf of Mexico, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. said it will continue to pursue its Trade Winds play.
The company said it remains encouraged with the geological
concepts the wells were designed to test and that the area is still
underexplored for subsalt Miocene-age objectives.
Anadarko drilled to measured total depth of 32,500 ft at the
Grand Cayman prospect on Garden Banks Block 561, the program’s
first prospect. The company plugged the well, two blocks east of
Oregano oil field. Anadarko had 35% working interest. Participants
were Plains Exploration & Production Co. 30%, Statoil ASA 25%,
and Newfield Exploration Co. 10%.

ute 10% of all license costs, which are estimated at $2.5 million
and have been backdated to Nov. 1, 2006.
If the combined cost of the two proposed wells at Nyuni should
exceed $15.4 million, then Key will only be obliged to pay 20% of
the excess cost over this amount, the company said.
Aminex and its partners have shot extensive new seismic surveys over shallow reefs and islands and are close to finalizing the
location for the first Nyuni well in the current program.
Partners in Nyuni are Aminex 84%, Bounty Oil 6%, and East
Africa Exploration Ltd. 10%. Discussions are continuing with PanAfrican Tanzania Ltd., a subsidiary of East Coast Energy Ltd., to participate in Nyuni. ✦

Statoil starts Gullfaks ﬁelds oil production
Statoil ASA has begun oil production from its Skinfaks field and
has implemented improved recovery techniques to boost oil output from Rimfaks field. Both lie in the Gullfaks license in the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.
The fields are expected to make up 12% of Gullfaks license production when all wells go on production this fall. Gullfaks produced 130,000 b/d during third quarter 2006.
A Statoil spokesman told OGJ that four of the horizontal wells
were completed using the downhole instrumentation and control
system (DIACS) to enhance oil recovery at Rimfaks. Rimfaks production before the IOR project was about 17,000 b/d of oil and
condensate, he said. DIACS increases oil production from existing
wells by monitoring downhole physical properties and correcting
them remotely if the conditions are unfavorable.
Rimfaks production was improved by tying back several wells to
the Gullfaks C platform. The field was developed in June 2000 as a
satellite, with the wellstream tied back to the Gullfaks A platform.
Skinfaks, which was proved in 2002, comprises several smaller
structures from the Brent group geological formation. It was developed with a subsea production system tied in to existing christmas
trees on Gullfaks South satellite field. Both projects cost $535.8 million to develop, and recoverable reserves are estimated at 62 million
boe for Skinfaks and the IOR part of Rimfaks. The recovery ratio for
Rimfaks will increase by 36-47% with Skinfaks-Rimfaks IOR.

The plant’s facilities, which include compressor and booster stations and fuel gas treatment and gas dehydration units, will treat
211 MMscfd of associated gas produced by fields off Abu Dhabi.
Technip said the project would be configured predominately in
large-scale process system modules and interconnecting racks that
will be manufactured and assembled at construction yards before
being transported and erected at Das Island.

Norne FPSO to be upgraded for Alve gas project
Aker Kvaerner will modify the topsides of the Norne floating
production, storage, and offloading unit under a $62.3 million
contract so that additional fields can be tied back to Statoil’s Alve
gas-condensate field in the Norwegian Sea (OGJ, Jan. 22, 2007,
Newsletter).
Design and procurement work has started, subject to a letter of
intent received Jan. 5, and prefabrication of steel and piping will
start in August. The engineering, procurement, construction, and
installation contract will be completed in March 2009.
Alve gas field will be phased in with existing infrastructure on
the Statoil-operated Norne field. Alve will produce 4 million cu
m/day of gas when it begins production in December 2008.
During the first quarter, Statoil plans to award Alve contracts for
subsea production equipment, flexible risers, cables for pipeline
heating, marine installations, and pipeline laying. “All contracts are
pending Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy approval of
the Alve plan for development and operation,” Statoil said.
Alve field was proved in 1990 and is a smaller-scale gas and
condensate find in production license 159B, around 15 km southwest of Norne field. The find comprises the Garn, Not, Ile, and Tilje
formations. Proved gas reserves of 6.8 billion cu m and 8.3 million
bbl of condensate lie in the Garn and Not formations. ✦

to manufacture ethylene and basic materials for plastics in 2011.
Reports say the Saudi facility is designed to produce 18 types
of petrochemicals, including commodity plastics polyethylene and
polypropylene and methyl methacrylate.
Sipchem also is said to have called on several other corporations, including DuPont and Lucite International Ltd., to participate
in the project, and negotiations are now in the final stages.
The entire project will likely be split into several parts, with

ESPO phase 2 on track to complete in 2012
Russia may be able to complete construction of the second
phase of the Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline to coincide with plans of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization for a summit to be held in Vladivostok in 2012.
Russian oil pipeline operator OAO Transneft is building the
4,000-km ESPO line with the aim of exporting Russian crude to
countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
“We may be able to meet the APEC forum with the ESPO fully completed,” said Russia’s Industry and Energy Minister Victor
Khristenko, who praised the speed at which the project is being
implemented.
“The first phase of the ESPO [project] will be completed before
the end of 2008,” said Khristenko, saying the pipeline will reach
Skovorodino by then and that there will be an export terminal on
the Pacific coast at Kazmino. If necessary, he said, a rail line could
be constructed to transport the crude to Kazmino from Skovorodino while the second phase of pipeline construction takes place.
In the first phase, the pipeline system will have capacity to carry
30 million tonnes/year of oil from Taishet to Skovorodino, with
the proposed rail system to link Skovorodino with the port terminal at Kozmino.
Khristenko said progress made by Rosneft and Surgutneftegas in

Trinidad and Tobago reported it is to begin a prefeasibility study
into the construction of a fifth LNG train at its liquefaction plant at
Point Fortin, Trinidad.
The Caribbean island’s Minister of Energy Lenny Saith told the
South Trinidad Petroleum Conference that the study would be concluded by yearend.
“We have already signaled our intention to consider another
LNG train. Train X,” Saith said. “Now that we have satisfied the domestic demand, we are about to undertake the first concrete steps
towards the realization of that objective with a prefeasibility study
which we expect to conclude by December 2007.”
Trinidad and Tobago has four LNG trains and is the largest exporter of LNG to the US, accounting for almost 70% of US imports.
Saith said if the plant is constructed, the government would be
taking a larger share in it and had agreed to work with its partners,
BP PLC, BG Group, and Repsol YPF SA towards getting equity in
regasification facilities in the US as well as shipping and marketing. ✦

Seeking pipeline security

Christopher E. Smith
Pipeline Editor
The continued expansion of pipeline construction plans detailed in this
issue’s special report, “Worldwide Pipeline Construction,” p. 48, brings with it
an increased need to keep the resulting
networks operating safely and efficiently. Regular maintenance, stringent
integrity management, and an increased
focus on preventing inadvertent thirdparty damage help address this need.
No less important, however, is protecting the expanding transportation infrastructure from intentional attack.
Toward this end, the US Department
of Homeland Security’s Transportation
Safety Administration is overseeing a
number of pipeline security initiatives
falling under the umbrella of DHS’s
National Infrastructure Protection Plan
(NIPP).

Web course
Earlier this month, DHS debuted
“Introduction to the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (IS-860),” a
web-based course developed jointly
with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The course is offered
through FEMA’s Emergency Management Institute’s online learning center
and can be taken either for credit or less
formally. Those who take the course for
credit will take a final examination and
receive a certificate from DHS.
The primary goal is to explain the
importance of protecting the US’s critical
infrastructure and key resources (CI-KR).
The course includes lessons that:
• Describe how the NIPP provides
the unifying structure for integrating

CI-KR protection efforts into a single
national program.
• Define CI-KR and protection in the
context of the NIPP.
• Identify the relevant authorities
and roles of NIPP security partners.
• Describe how using the risk management framework ensures protection
within and across CI-KR sectors.
• Identify the risk management
activities implemented by NIPP security
partners.
• Explain how the NIPP fosters information-sharing, provides guidance on
the content of CI-KR protection-related
aspects of homeland security plans, and
helps to ensure a long-term effective, efficient CI-KR protection program.
Course IS-860 is available at http://

www.training.fema.gov/emiweb/IS/
is860.asp.

TSA also plans to develop and
distribute a Security Awareness Training compact disc (CD-1) to interested
pipeline companies.
As part of its Corporate Security
Review Program, TSA has reviewed
numerous pipeline systems, analyzing various aspects of each company’s
security programs. This process prompted development of CD-1, TSA having
determined that improved security
awareness training for pipeline company employees would be useful.
Besides making CD-1 available to
pipeline companies that wish to use it,
TSA will seek voluntary feedback from
these companies and use the results to
guide future pipeline transportation
security initiatives.
TSA will conduct data collection for
2-3 years to allow for full distribution
of CD-1 across the industry and for
participating companies to complete
full training cycles.
A mid-August 2006 security breach
at KeySpan Corp.’s LNG facility in Lynn,
Mass., prompted the US Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Administration to
release an advisory reminding operators

of LNG terminals, peak-shaving plants,
pipelines, and other facilities of the
need to implement security measures to
stop intruders.
According to PHMSA, “Investigation revealed that the intruders had cut
through the outer and inner perimeter
fences and through the locked gate and
gained access to the storage tank several
days before the breach was discovered.
A microwave intrusion system documented the intrusions on the computer
monitoring system, which should
have alerted operator personnel to the
intrusion. Operator personnel did not
respond. In the days following, personnel conducted several routine visual inspections of the area without noting the
cuts in the fences. Although there was
also video surveillance of the perimeter,
personnel did not review the tape until
they investigated the breach.”
In this context, the need for training materials such as CD-1 is clear. But
security is an ongoing process, and
training materials need to be evaluated
to ensure their effectiveness.

Assessing effects
TSA intends to use the information
gathered in its survey of CD-1 users to
assess the effect of the project on raising
the baseline level of security awareness
within the pipeline industry. It also
hopes to gain an indication of CD-1
participation levels.
TSA estimates that an average of 300
companies/year will provide feedback
on CD-1. It further estimates that the
average time needed to respond to its
survey will be 20 min. Done twice a
year means 40 min/year spent on helping improve an industry-wide security
awareness program.
Neither CD-1 nor IS-860 is by any
means a panacea. Security, by its nature,
is immune to such cures. But it is the
20 min budgeted here and there over
the course of a year that will make a
measurable difference. ✦

The US energy surge
The decision announced by US President
George W. Bush last month to increase military
strength in Iraq by 20,000 troops wasn’t the only
surge of January 2007. From initiatives during the
month by both houses of Congress and the White
House it is clear that the US government wants to
surge back into the energy business.
This page previously addressed the initiatives
individually (OGJ, Jan. 15, Jan. 22, and Feb. 5,
2007). But a full appreciation for what’s happening on energy in the US requires a combined
assessment. Consider:
• On Jan. 4, among its first acts with Democrats
in control, the Senate passed a bill calling on Congress to require cuts in emissions of greenhouse
gases, expand the use of specified types of energy,
lower energy costs, eliminate “tax give-aways to
large energy companies,” and prevent “pricegouging, profiteering, and market manipulation.”
• On Jan. 18, the House, also newly controlled
by Democrats, passed a bill that would cut or
repeal a range of tax and other incentives for the
production or processing of oil and gas and spend
the assumed savings on renewable and other alternative forms of energy. The bill also would coerce
holders of Gulf of Mexico leases providing deepwater royalty relief uncapped by price thresholds,
which were issued in 1998 and 1999, to renegotiate. Because some of the incentives under threat
had been passed only recently, and because some
of the targeted tax preferences remain available to
other industries, the bill obviously aims to punish
the oil and gas business.
• On Jan. 23, in his state-of-the-union speech,
President Bush called for a 20% cut against projection in gasoline use by 2017 and an increase
in the federal requirement for renewable and
alternative fuel to 35 billion gal/year by the same
deadline. Without providing details, he called for
reform of vehicle fuel-economy standards. He also
announced a doubling of capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 1.5 billion bbl. On the
same day, the Department of Energy began buying
100,000 b/d of crude for the reserve.
Look closely. It was just such a mixture of of-

ficial groping that produced the National Energy
Plan of 1977. For anyone who has forgotten or is
too young to have known, that experiment in central energy planning failed. It failed spectacularly.
It wasted public money and didn’t deliver on its
promises. It mainly enriched entrepreneurs with
energy schemes that unfettered markets wouldn’t
support.
Motivations that led the US government into
its energy mistakes of the 1970s have reemerged:
recent experience with a run-up in oil and gas
prices, anger at oil companies, anxiety over
dependence on foreign oil, concern about the
environmental effects of burning hydrocarbons,
and political pressure from marketers of uneconomic fuels. Instead of oil from shale, the government now mongers ethanol from corn. Instead
of smog, carbon monoxide, and other pollutants
now impressively diminished as constituents of US
air, politicians fret about global warming. But the
motivations yield the same tactics: regulation of
the quantities and forms of energy people use.
Those tactics failed before, and they’ll fail again.
Those tactics wasted Americans’ money before,
and they’ll do so again. Americans never fare better
on energy than they do when their government
does nothing with energy markets except ensure
that they work. History makes that clear to anyone
clear-headed enough to see back past recent oilprice jumps.
The Senate’s sense-of-Congress bill is political
bluster, its hard talk about gouging and profiteering devoid of meaning, and its discussion about
“reducing the burdens of consumers of rising energy costs” suggestive of price controls. The House
bill is a political double-cross that, if passed,
would only chase out of the country capital that
US citizens need to see invested domestically in
sound energy ventures. And the president’s plans
would squander money on expensive energy substitutes and unnecessarily hoarded crude oil.
Worst of all, these plans would rush the government back into a business about which it has
learned nothing from past failure.
This is a surge Americans can’t afford. ✦

Gazprom unveiled in September
2005 a short list of five foreign companies being considered as partners in
Shtokmanovskoye, a supergiant gascondensate field located in 350 m of
water in the central part of the Barents
Sea some 555 km east of Murmansk
(see map, OGJ, Sept. 4, 2006, p. 70).
“Shtokman” clearly is a prize worth
seeking. Its reserves are estimated at

3.7 trillion cu m of gas (131 tcf)—increased from 3.2 trillion cu m by the
Russian Federation Nature Ministry’s
State Commission for Mineral Reserves
in January 2006—and 31 million
tonnes of gas condensate. It is the
fourth largest gas field in the world,
slightly larger than Hassi R’Mel field in
Algeria, and the third largest in Russia.
The supergiant Persian Gulf North fieldSouth Pars field straddling Qatar and
Iran holds 1,400 tcf, and Urengoy and
Yamburg fields in Russia hold 220 tcf
and 140 tcf respectively.
The first stage of Shtokman field
development as originally conceived
was expected to involve output capacity
of about 30 billion cu m/year, with as
much as 24 billion cu m/year targeted
as LNG. About 15 million tonnes/year of
the LNG was scheduled for export to the
US. Capital cost of the first phase of the
project was estimated at $10 billion, including gas extraction, liquefaction, and
a pipeline to shore, and LNG shipping.
Production start-up was scheduled
for 2010-12, and many expect the total
development costs to exceed the quoted
figure of $20 billion, which equates
to just $1.09/boe, based on its gas
reserves.
The companies short-listed in 2005
excluded Exxon, Shell, and the Japanese companies Mitsui and Mitsubishi,
which were fighting to maintain production-sharing terms in the Sakhalin

project. Those named on the Shtokman
short list were Statoil ASA and Norsk
Hydro ASA—companies that have since
agreed to merge—and Chevron Corp.,
ConocoPhillips, and Total SA. Expertise
gained from developing the Snohvit
LNG project under construction in the
Norwegian sector of the Barents Sea is
considered important, and Statoil and
Total have a clear advantage in that regard. In addition, Hydro has participated with Gazprom in drilling the
fourth Shtokman field appraisal well.
Gazprom announced it would keep
51% of the project and would hold
further talks to select a final lineup of
two or three companies. Those talks
lasted more than a year and involved
each of the short-listed companies
competing with each other to offer
Gazprom equity shares in their international assets with strategic interest to
Gazprom.

Revised Shtokman plan
In October 2006, however, Gazprom
dismayed its foreign suitors by announcing that it was abandoning the
bidding process and would develop
Shtokman without any foreign equity
partners under a plan that would export
Shtokman gas by pipeline to Europe
rather than export it to North America
as LNG.1 At that time Gazprom justified its action by saying the potential
partners hadn’t offered enough capital
or attractive enough assets in return.
Under Gazprom’s revised plan, gas
initially will be piped from the field to
the Russian coast, across Russia to the
Baltic Sea, and onward from Russia to
Germany through the now-sanctioned
joint Russian-German 1,200 km Nord
Stream pipeline, formerly called the
North European Gas Pipeline. Gazprom
owns 51% of Nord Stream, and BASF
AG and E.ON AG hold 24.5% each.
Original plans also called for an LNG
liquefaction plant near St. Petersburg;
whether this will now be built remains
uncertain. Pipeline operations, however,
are scheduled to begin in 2010 with
an initial capacity of 27.5 billion cu
m/year with gas supplied from Siberia.

Capacity could be doubled with a parallel second line to be built in Phase 2.
In what appears to be recognition
that Gazprom needs foreign deepwater
operating expertise to develop the field,
the gas monopoly announced that it
had sent letters to the four companies
on the Shtokman short list (reduced
by the merger of Statoil and Hydro)
offering them the possible opportunity
to take part in the offshore development as contractors.2 Needless to say,
the companies have not responded to
this announcement with enthusiastic
press releases. Nevertheless, Gazprom is
expecting talks with the companies to
recommence this month.
Russia had hinted prior to October
2006 that US companies Chevron and
ConocoPhillips would, in any event, be
left out of the Shtokman project if the
US precipitates deterioration in trade
relations between the countries, and the
gas would be redirected away from the
US to Europe. This is the type of political leverage Russia can bring to bear
when it controls access to gas needed
by other countries.
Yet North America is a potentially
valuable market for Russian gas. Despite
the decisions apparently made on
the export route for Shtokman gas, it
remains clear that Russia and Gazprom
remain keen to export LNG to the US.
They continue to take positions to
enter that market. Gazprom has set up a
trading company in the US—Gazprom
Marketing & Trading US in Houston.
It planned to sell five or more LNG
cargoes in the US in 2006 under swap
or purchase-and-resale schemes, some
of which have involved BP and BG.
This author therefore believes that LNG
export facets to the Shtokman-Nord
Stream projects are likely to reemerge.

There are few countries in the world

The precedent is disturbing. Because
they succeeded with it once, and have
been emboldened by the outcome, few
can expect similar events not to occur

in the future. Whenever the Russian
government becomes short of funds in
the future, say if an oil or gas demand

Producers facing dramatically higher capital costs
The costs of major oil and gas
production projects have risen more
than 53% in 2 years, and no significant
slowing is in sight, said a benchmark
index developed by IHS and Cambridge
Energy Research Associates (CERA).
The IHS-CERA Upstream Capital
Costs Index (UCCI) tracked nine key
cost areas for offshore and land-based
projects. The UCCI climbed 13% to
167 during the 6 months ending Oct.
31, 2006, compared with an increase
of more than 17% in the previous 6
months.
Since 2000, the UCCI has risen
67%—with most of the increase in the
last 2 years—while the Producer Price
Index-Commodities for finished goods
(excluding food and energy) moved up
7.5% during the same period.
The continuing cost surge is central
to every energy company’s strategic
planning, analysts said.
CERA Chairman Daniel Yergin said,
“Rising capital costs rank right alongside more widely recognized issues
such as world market trends, geopolitics, globalization, and new technologies at the top of the agenda for the
energy industry.”
An all-in measure of project costs,
the UCCI is up 53% since the end of
2004. While strong commodity prices
are expected to continue, this rise in
costs is causing firms to reevaluate
the economics and viability of many
projects.

24

Index data
The UCCI is a model based upon a
portfolio of upstream projects worldwide. Cost engineering software was
used to predict costs for those projects.
Analysts plan to update the UCCI every
6 months and probably release updates
in May and November.
The UCCI tracks the costs of equipment, facilities, construction materials,
and personnel in more than 24 onshore
and offshore oil and gas development
projects. Specific projects in the portfolio were not disclosed.
The UCCI is similar to the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) in that it provides a
tool for tracking and forecasting, Yergin
said.
Richard Ward, CERA senior director
and UCCI project manager, said 2007
is shaping up to be a year of additional
increases.
“Despite a slight slowing in the rate
of increase during the 6 months to Oct.
31, we expect project capital costs to
continue reaching new record levels
during 2007,” Ward said. “With high
oil prices driving new development
projects, capacity constraints continue
to support increases in the cost of
equipment and services.”
The analysis shows capacity is tight
in all markets, Ward said. Hot spots for
capacity constraints are the deepwater
regions, such as West Africa and the
Gulf of Mexico.
“While oil prices stay above $55/bbl
CERA expects that confidence to remain.

Should prices slip below $50/bbl, the
industry should expect some expansion
projects to be canceled or delayed,” he
said.
Deepwater projects experienced the
largest cost increases, rising 15% in
the last 6 months. Ward attributed cost
increases to rig rates, technology limits,
and skills requirements. These costs are
expected to continue to rise due to tight
industry capacity.
Onshore facilities, including LNG,
have seen the slowest rates of increase,
12%, he said.
“Higher costs, combined with the
recent drop in gas prices, have made
some projects uneconomical and triggered a reevaluation of plans.” Ward
said. “This has produced a slight relaxation of tight support service or commodity markets, particularly in the US.”

Cost drivers
Of the nine primary drivers of
project capital development costs, steel
is the only segment to decline over
the past 12 months, primarily because
steel prices began accelerating globally
before the recent increase in oil prices
and demand.
Most of the others—except equipment and bulk materials—are specifically focused on the oil and gas business
and are at near maximum capacity.
The primary drivers are:
• Steel. With oil industry steel less

try grade steels, the industry faces premium pricing and constrained capacity.
• Offshore rigs. A rush by drilling
contractors to expand their fleets has
produced plans for construction of over
100 new rigs during the next 4 years.
If demand stays high, the majority of
these rigs will come to market and
some additional rigs may begin construction. This should ease rates, but not
until mid-to-late 2009. Because drilling
accounts for 40% to 50% of development costs, a 25% rise in the rig rate
can produce a 10% or larger increase in
total project cost.
• Equipment. The market for long lead
time oil and gas equipment—such as
generators, compressors, vessels, towers, and exchangers—is very tight with
extended delivery times and premium
pricing.
• Yards and fabrication. Specialized, oil
and gas fabrication encounter premium
pricing in competition with container
demand and also cruise ship demand.

Yards are at capacity. Even with an
expected 15% expansion by 2012, utilization will remain high as will demand
for LNG tankers.
• Offshore installation vessels. Plans announced by pipeline installation companies to expand capacity of the current
56-vessel fleet by 8%, or three new
vessels, is insufficient to meet shortterm demand. The world’s fleet of 26
heavy lift crane vessels is projected to
expand by one in 2009, increasing total
lift capacity by about 15%. If demand
for installation projects should soften
due to a decline in oil prices, previously

delayed decommissioning projects are
likely to claim the available capacity at
reduced rates.
• Design and project management. Although
vigorous efforts to attract new talent
into the detailed design arena, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, CERA
anticipates at least 5 years will be required for the new entrants’ experience
to reach the level required.
Analysts expect design and project
management costs will escalate until
then. Meanwhile, specialists in deepwater, subsea, and project management
will receive premium pay. ✦

Execs discuss global warming with Turner, Wirth

Energy executives met in a Feb. 7
roundtable discussion with billionaire

right direction,” he told reporters at a
news conference after he and Turner addressed a Houston World Affairs Council
luncheon.
The United Nations Foundation was
formed after Turner donated $1 billion
in 1997 to support UN causes and to
help address key global challenges
BP PLC, Shell, Marathon Oil Corp.,
and ConocoPhillips executives were
among 25 people who attended a
roundtable meeting with Turner and
Wirth before the luncheon discussion,
moderated by investment banker Matt
Simons, chairman of Simmons & Co.
International.
Wirth said the message from energy
executives during the roundtable meeting was that the government needs to
“get the rules right [on greenhouse gas
emissions] and then let us go.” Simmons noted what he called “50 years of

energy mistakes” under eight presidents.
Momentum is building for worldwide support to cap GHG emissions,
Wirth said, particularly carbon dioxide.
He said the environmental movement
“has dramatically matured” since the
Clean Air Act was implemented during
the 1990s.
“I wish that were the case with the
political environment today,” Wirth
said, adding that it’s “going to be hard”
to reach a consensus in the US Congress. “We have to break down some
old thinking on Capitol Hill.”
The major GHG negotiation globally
will be about which countries get the
right to pollute and what volumes of
pollution from which countries will be
acceptable, Wirth said.

Turner’s fuels
Turner said the private sector can
help the government, and he predicted
that clean renewable energy “is going
to make a fortune.” He said: “The day
of fossil fuels as a fuel are over. It’s just a
matter of how soon everybody recognizes it. We only have one atmosphere.”
Saying his favorite forms of alternative energy are solar and wind, Turner
told reporters that he recently invested
“millions” of dollars in DT Solar, formerly Dome-Tech Solar, of Branchburg,
NJ.
“I think dealing with climate change
is going to be the biggest single challenge humanity has ever faced, and
we’re facing it now,” Turner said. “I’d
rather have a nuclear plant than a new
coal plant the way they are now.”
He and Wirth called for advances in
CO2 sequestration. ✦

IP Week: Saudis reveal spending plans for next decade
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Saudi Arabia will spend $507 billion
on energy and infrastructure projects
over the next 11 years, a Saudi government official said Feb. 12 at the International Petroleum Week conference in
London.
The kingdom will spend about
$267 billion on its oil, gas, and chemical businesses and $240 billion on
developing minerals, environmental
technologies, infrastructure, power, and
water. “Deliverability is the issue for
oil and gas, and not supply,” said Saud
Al Amnari, minister plenipotentiary at
the Saudi embassy in the UK. Speaking
in place of Saudi Ambassador to the
UK Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf, he
pointed out that Saudi Arabia has about
100 years worth of reserves to tap and
meet future global demand. Its crude
reserves stood at 259.8 billion bbl at
yearend 2005.
Saudi Arabia is committed to using
diplomacy in handling Iran and its
26

uranium-enrichment program, which
is causing anxiety worldwide, Amnari
said, adding that it was vital that there is
peace in the Middle East to ensure stable
petroleum supplies. “Iran is important
because it holds up to one tenth of the
world’s oil reserves, is the second-largest holder of gas reserves, and occupies
a strategic location. We need genuine
brokers of peace to bring stability to the
region.”
Meanwhile, Saudi Aramco plans to
expand its production capacity to 12
million b/d by 2009 and its worldwide
refining capacity to 6 million b/d over
the next 5 years. With high oil prices
dampening global demand, Ibrahim S.
Mishari, Aramco vice-president, marketing and supply planning, said it has not
revised its production capacity figures.
Aramco will focus on expanding its
resources base through discoveries and
improving its recovery rates from fields,
Mishari said.
Aramco will be a key player in
providing global oil supplies but varied
estimates on world energy demand

make it hard to predict how much it
will contribute in 2030. According to
some forecasts, there will be a 50% increase in world energy needs by 2030,
while others say 60%. The predicted call
on Saudi oil ranges from 11-20 million
b/d of oil.
“That 9 million b/d difference
presents big producers like Saudi Arabia
with a difficult balancing act since underinvestment in capacity will result in
price spikes and supply shortages, while
overinvestment will drain substantial
amounts of capital from the Kingdom’s
other economic needs,” he said.
A key priority for the petroleum
industry is to hire sufficient competent
individuals who can drive technological developments, Mishari noted. About
40-60% of the industry’s workforce
are eligible for retirement, and another
wave of retirees is on their heels within
the next decade or so—but unlike the
past, there are not enough new graduates to replace them.
Mishari told OGJ there are a number
of initiatives under way in Saudi Arabia

IP Week: Europe
will still receive
Russian natural gas
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Fears that Russian gas exports will
be sent to other markets such as China
instead of Europe are overstated, said
Julian Lee, senior energy analyst at the
Centre for Global Energy Studies, speaking Feb. 14 at the International Petroleum Week conference in London.
“Europe and Russia share [an] oil-related gas pricing philosophy that China
doesn’t have,” he said about the security
of European gas supplies. “In China, gas
would compete with coal, and there is
a big gulf between what China will pay
and what Russia wants to charge for its
gas.”
China is seeking Russian gas, and
Russia has proposed building two 3040 billion cu m/year gas pipelines from
Western Siberia to China that could be
commissioned from 2011. However,
progress on the initiative has been just
talk so far, Lee said.
“I think the worries about gas going
to China are overstated,” he emphasized, pointing out that Sakhalin LNG
has been contracted by Japanese and
Korean buyers, not China.
Lee said Europe was a very important
market for Russia and was its biggest
customer; Europe imports about 25% of
its gas from there.
The current form of the Energy
Charter Treaty, an international agreement that aims to protect foreign
energy investments, has caused a standoff between Russia and the European
Union. Russia, arguing that the treaty
does not serve its interests, has refused
to ratify it because the gas giant is un-

Lease billing
moves online

T

he US Minerals Management Service’s proposed budget for fiscal
2008 includes $1.45 million for the
first of a 2-year initiative to institute
an interactive payment reconciliation
and billing system. There’s more to
it than leaseholders not getting away
with saying the check is in the mail.
To a great extent, they can’t do it
now. MMS collects fees and royalties
not only for its own federal leases but
also for those issued by the Bureau
of Land Management and American Indian tribes, said Lucy Denett,
MMS’s associate director for minerals
revenue management. Reconciling
payments with outstanding balances
can be challenging. It involves close
to 29,000 producing oil and gas,
coal, geothermal, and other leases.
There also are separate “lines” when
a lease produces more than one commodity. Leases also can have three
or four partners, each reporting and
paying. Finally, lease terms can vary
by location and the issuing agency.
The result is more than 600,000
fee and royalty lines for MMS’s Minerals Royalty Management (MRM)
division to process each month.
“We’re a major collection and auditing operation,” Denett told OGJ.

internal controls to work. If a report
and payment differ, an MRM auditor telephones the lessee to discuss
the discrepancy. MMS is seeking the
money to improve this part of the
operation so a lessee and an MRM
auditor can simultaneously examine
submitted documents and payments
on their own computers. A discrepancy may not be the lessee’s fault;
sometimes an agency has neglected
to set up the correct account to receive the payment.
“The more automated and transparent we are, the better the process
will be,” Denett said.

Both sides beneﬁt

Moving this reconciliation process
online should benefit both parties,
she suggested. “A company may have
thousands of lines and get a bill from
us filled with information,” she said.
Once adopted, the new system
would signal when a basic error such
as incorrect lease numbers, omitted
production or financial information
and incorrect addition occurs. The
report would then be automatically
rejected and returned with missing
areas highlighted.
Denett said MRM has been working with the Council of Petroleum

veryone knows that oil is the tool
of choice where diplomacy is
concerned, particularly in these days
of a reactive market and supposedly
depleting supplies. Look at the oil
deal North Korea has just won.
Envoys from six nations—the US,
Russia, China, Japan, and the two
Koreas—have reached a tentative
agreement early last week on the first
steps toward North Korea’s nuclear
disarmament, and oil was at the heart
of the discussion.
Details of the agreement have
yet to be made public, but it is said
to resemble the bargain reached in
1994 during President Bill Clinton’s
administration when North Korea
pledged to freeze and eventually
dismantle its reactor at Yongbyon in
return for 500,000 tonnes/year of
heavy fuel oil.
In the wait for further revelations of the latest deal, one thing is
abundantly clear: The North Koreans
wanted oil badly and bargained hard
to get it without giving up too much.

aid North Korea would receive in
the new bargain—it apparently had
demanded large quantities of heavy
fuel oil, reportedly up to 2 million
tonnes—or describe the precise
schedule that would tie fuel deliveries to closure of the Yongbyon
reactor.
While the agreement is expected
to help prevent new nuclear development by North Korea, it does not
take up such issues as Pyongyang’s
past uranium enrichment for nuclear
weapons development, the closure of
nuclear testing facilities, or its missile
development program.
“Left for later” is the phrase diplomats use to describe the issue of
North Korea’s existing nuclear weapons and the plutonium fuel already
produced at Yongbyon—estimated by
US experts as enough to make 8-10
bombs.

comfortable with the Transit Protocol,
a related document that facilitates the
transit of hydrocarbons. Lee told OGJ
that the Energy Charter Treaty needs to
be revamped because it was based upon
a bygone era when the West assumed
that countries within the Commonwealth of Independent States were in
need of investment to develop energy
infrastructure. “The world has moved
on from that position,” Lee said. “Russia
is not in need of Western companies

brought in with service companies, and
Russia is awash with petrodollars. The

EPA targets benzene
in its new regulations
on toxic emissions
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
The US Environmental Protection
Agency Feb. 9 enacted new Mobile
Source Air Toxics regulations designed
to significantly decrease toxic fumes
from gasoline, vehicles, and fuel containers.
The new rules join fuel and vehicle
standards already in place in aiming to
reduce toxic emissions from cars and
trucks to 80% below 1999 levels, EPA
Administrator Stephen L. Johnson said
as he signed the latest order.
Essentially, the new MSAT regulations
toughen benzene standards for gasoline,
set hydrocarbon emission standards for
cars at cold temperatures, and require
fuel containers to be tighter to prevent
evaporation of harmful fumes, EPA said.
It said that once the new standards
are fully implemented by 2030, they
are expected to reduce MSAT emissions
by 330,000 tons/year, including 6,000
tons/year of benzene.
EPA said it expects the vehicle standards to produce $6 billion/year of
health benefits from particulate matter

reductions by 2030. It said that the entire rule will result in an estimated cost
of $400 million/year in 2030.
The regulations’ fuel section lowers the allowable benzene content in
gasoline nationwide to an average 0.62
vol % beginning in 2011 from its current level of 1.0 vol %. The limits apply
to both reformulated and conventional
gasoline. Gasoline sold in California will
not be affected because the state already
has implemented its own stringent
standards similar to what EPA is establishing, the federal agency said.
The fuel regulation includes a nationwide averaging, banking, and trading program. EPA said that in addition
to the 0.62 vol % standard, refiners and
importers will have to meet a maximum average benzene standard of 1.3
vol % beginning July 1, 2012.

Much less variation
EPA said the regulation should
lower benzene levels in all areas of the
country and result in significantly less
geographic variations. Regions where
benzene levels currently are highest,
such as Alaska and the Northwest, will
experience the biggest reductions, it
predicted.
The agency said it would “provide

special compliance flexibility for approved small refiners or any refiner facing extreme unforeseen circumstances.”
For vehicles, the regulations aim to
reduce benzene and other nonmethane
hydrocarbon (NMHC) exhaust emissions by tightening current test procedures which often do not control such
emissions at temperatures below 75° F.
The new rule will establish a
sales-weighted fleet average for each
manufacturer’s cars and trucks of 0.3
g/mile for vehicles weighing 6,000 lb
or less, phased in from 2010 through
2013. Heavier vehicles, including trucks
weighing up to 8,500 lb and passenger vehicles up to 10,000 lb will have
to meet a 0.5 g/mile sales-weighted
NMHC average, phased in from 2012
through 2015.
“A credit program and other provisions provide flexibility to manufacturers, especially during the phase-in
periods,” EPA said.

Rule for containers
The new regulations also establish
standards to limit hydrocarbon emissions that evaporate from or permeate
through portable fuel containers. The
rule applies to containers for kerosine
and diesel fuel as well as gasoline.

Starting with containers manufactured in 2009, allowable evaporation or
permeation emissions will be limited
to 0.3 g/gal/day, EPA said. “We are also
adopting test procedures and a certification and compliance program in order
to ensure that containers will meet the
new emission standard over a range of
in-use conditions.”
EPA said it has worked closely with
major container manufacturers, and it
anticipates that new cans will be built
with a simple and inexpensive permeation barrier and new spouts which will
close automatically.
National Petrochemical & Refiners
Association Vice-Pres. Charles T. Drevna
said the trade group is reviewing EPA’s
new regulations “with close attention to
its potential impact on gasoline supply.”
The order further tightens gasoline
specifications, especially for conventional gasoline, which represents about
two thirds of the nation’s total supplies,
he noted Feb. 9.
“EPA has incorporated averaging,
banking, and trading. However, part
of the rule does not permit the use of
credits. This constraint is a concern for
some refiners. In addition, this will have
different impacts on individual refiners,” Drevna said. ✦

El Paso to pay $7.7 million for oil-for-food irregularities
Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
Without admitting any wrongdoing,
El Paso Corp. said Feb. 7 it will forfeit
$5,482,363 and pay a civil penalty of
$2.25 million to the US Securities and
Exchange Commission in connection
with illegal surcharges paid to Saddam Hussein’s government for Iraqi oil
under the United Nations’ oil-for-food
program.
In return, the company faces no federal prosecution, said representatives of
the US Department of Justice. The forfeited $5.5 million will be transferred
by the US through the UN’s Develop-

ment Fund of Iraq as restitution to the
citizens of Iraq.
Coastal Corp. was involved in the
oil-for-food program starting in 1996,
prior to El Paso’s acquisition of the
company in 2001, and participated in
the program until May 2002. “Following 2000, neither Coastal Corp. nor El
Paso purchased any Iraqi oil directly
from the government of Iraq under the
program,” said El Paso officials. Iraqi
government records obtained by DOJ
showed nearly $5.5 million in illegal
surcharges were paid “by the third
parties that purchased the oil directly
from the government of Iraq under
the program or by other third-party

intermediaries” from June 2001 until
May 2002. “Although El Paso took steps
designed to prevent the purchase of
Iraqi oil from third parties on which
illegal surcharges had been paid, such
procedures proved to be inadequate,”
said the company.
SEC officials paint a darker picture
of the company’s activities, however.
SEC officials reported: “El Paso failed
to maintain an adequate system of
internal controls to detect and prevent
the payments. Although El Paso inserted
a provision in some contracts requiring the third party to represent that it
had not paid surcharges, El Paso failed
to conduct due diligence to ensure that

surcharges were not paid. Recorded
conversations reveal El Paso’s knowledge
that the provision was entirely ineffective. In one conversation, a third party
that indicated he was willing to pay
illegal surcharges to Iraq indicated that
he would be equally willing to sign a
false certification denying the payment.
El Paso’s accounting for its oil-for-food
transactions failed properly to record
the nature of the company’s payments.
In at least 15 transactions, a portion of
the company’s price for oil constituted
kickbacks to Iraq. The company failed to
so designate those payments, characterizing them instead simply as part of the
cost of goods sold.”
The UN oil-for-food program was
intended to provide humanitarian
relief for the Iraqi population under
international trade sanctions. In August
2000, however, officials of Iraq’s State
Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO)
began demanding illegal kickbacks on
sales of crude through that program.
The kickbacks were made in the form
of surcharges and were sent to Iraqicontrolled accounts at banks in Jordan
and Lebanon.
Coastal received its first surcharge

demand in September 2000. According to the SEC, “An El Paso consultant
and former Coastal official arranged a
$201,877 surcharge payment on the
company’s behalf, which was made to
an Iraqi-controlled account at Ahli Bank
in Jordan.” That former official was not
named in the SEC statement.
Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., former chairman
of Coastal, was indicted by DOJ in 2005
on four counts of wire fraud and engaging in prohibited financial transactions with Iraq.
After being notified by SOMO that
all oil contracts would include surcharges, El Paso ceased direct purchases
from SOMO but continued purchases
through third parties. “Beginning in
June 2001, El Paso entered into 14
additional third-party transactions
involving 15 contracts to purchase
some 21.4 million bbl of oil. Approximately 25-30¢ of every barrel [price]
was illegally kicked back to Iraq by
third parties. El Paso’s oil traders had to
factor the surcharge into their oil price,
and there are recorded conversations
of the company’s officials and traders
discussing the surcharges,” said SEC

officials. “El Paso knew, or was reckless
in not knowing, that $5.5 million in
illegal surcharges were made on those
contracts and passed back to El Paso
in premiums.” The SEC filed Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act books and records
and internal controls charges against
El Paso in the US District Court for the
Southern District of New York.
El Paso voluntarily ceased its trade
in Iraqi oil under the oil-for-food
program in mid-2002 “based, in part,
on concerns about the effectiveness
of compliance efforts in preventing
the payment of illegal surcharges by
others to the former government of
Iraq,” said government officials. That
was a factor in the government’s decision not to pursue criminal charges
against the company. Another factor is
that company employees involved in
the surcharge activity are no longer
employed by El Paso.
As part of the settlement, El Paso
agreed to continue to cooperate with
federal authorities in their ongoing
investigation of illegal activity under the
UN program. It also is enjoined from
future violations of certain sections of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ✦

not control for the significant shortcomings of the TRI database, including
its failure to weigh emissions according
to actual risk,” NPRA Executive VicePres. Charles T. Drevna said.
“Emissions included in the TRI are
permitted releases, which have a predetermined level that does not pose an
unacceptable risk to human health and
the environment,” he noted.
EPA Press Secretary Jennifer Wood
said the agency is committed to holder
polluters responsible, and that its enforcement has resulted in 17 settlements since 2000 that account for 77%
of the nation’s total refining capacity.
These settlements, Wood said, cover 85
refineries in 25 states and will result in
emissions reductions of 80,000 tons/
year of nitrogen oxides and 235,000
tons/year of sulfur dioxide.
Negotiations are continuing with
other refiners representing another 11%
of total US refining capacity and other
investigations are currently under way,
according to Wood.
An ExxonMobil representative said
the company was still studying the EIP
report and could not comment on its
contents. “ExxonMobil refineries are
generally world-scale in size, with the
Baytown and Baton Rouge facilities being among the largest in the US. Since
TRI reporting began in 1988, ExxonMobil has reduced air emissions of the
referenced compounds by 36%,” said
Prem Nar, who handles downstream
public affairs for the company.
EIP said its report, which is available
online at environmentalintegrity.org,
uses data from the EPA TRI to catalogue
refinery air emissions of certain pollutants that are known or believed to cause
cancer. It said TRI is a database that
contains information on toxic chemical releases reported annually by certain
covered industries, including refineries.
Designations of chemicals as carcinogenic or possibly carcinogenic in
humans are made by expert consensus
groups established by the US National
Toxicology Program, or by the International Agency for Research on Cancer,
which is an agency of the World Health

Organization. The carcinogens emitted by US refineries include benzene,
ethylbenzene, butadiene, poly-cyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), naphthalene, formaldehyde, and metals such
as nickel and lead, according to EIP.

Biggest single source
The report said that BP’s Texas City
refinery was the largest single refin-

ery source of carcinogen emissions in
2004, due mostly to its reported release
of nearly 2 million lb of formaldehyde
in that year. BP has claimed that the
formaldehyde release resulted from
a change in its emission calculations,
raising questions as to whether other
refineries are reporting accurately, EIP
said.

said that Texas refineries accounted for
36% of total refinery air emissions of
carcinogens in 2004, but only 24% of
the nation’s refining capacity. In the
aggregate, Texas refineries emitted two
and a half times the volume of carcinogens per barrel of oil as did California
refineries in 2004, it said.
It said that LaGloria’s plant in Tyler
was the largest individual US refinery
source of benzene air emissions, while

Sunoco’s Philadelphia installation was
the largest emitter of PAHs.
Noting that EIP’s report cites benzene
emissions, NPRA’s Drevna said trends
for benzene at 95 urban monitoring
sites around the country show, on average, a 47% drop in benzene levels in
recent years.
“Toxic emissions have declined
in part because of actions taken by
the refining industry. First, advanced

technology and management systems
at refineries and petrochemical facilities
have lowered emissions. And second,
the introduction of new refinery products—namely cleaner gasolines—has
reduced the toxics profile of cars and
trucks. These reductions will be even
more pronounced when the Phase II
Mobile Source Air Toxics rules are implemented over the next several years,”
Drevna said. ✦

The central part of supergiant Wilmington oil and gas field is in the midst
of a redevelopment project in which
more than 500 wells drilled in the next
few years.
Los Angeles city authorities in late
2006 approved the drilling of as many
as 540 directional oil and water injection wells from central facilities. The
zoning approval facilitates plans by Warren Resources Inc.,
New York, to drill
from two cellars
under construction and due to
be in operation by
the end of the first
quarter of 2007.
Warren Resources had booked 50
million bbl of net proved reserves in
Wilmington at the end of 2005 and
believes its two units in the central
part of the field hold large oil recovery
potential.
The Wilmington Townlot Unit, the
company estimates, has produced only
20% of the estimated 727 million bbl
of original oil in place, leaving an average remaining recovery potential of
228,000 bbl/well. The adjacent North
Wilmington Unit has produced 24% of
the estimated 165 million bbl of OOIP
compared with 36% recovery for the
field.

that Townlot could yield another 92
million bbl of oil if the company were
able to attain a 32% recovery factor.
Greater Wilmington field, the majority of which is operated by Occidental
Petroleum Corp., had produced more
than 1 billion bbl of oil and 900 bcf of
gas through the late 1960s since discovery in 1932. Cumulative oil production
has now surpassed 2.5 billion bbl. Part
of the field underlies Long Beach harbor
(OGJ, Aug. 15, 2005, p. 18). An Exxon
Corp. predecessor unitized Townlot in
1973, and the former Sun Oil Co. unitized North Wilmington the same year.

Warren’s tenure

Warren Resources took over operation of Townlot in March 2005 and
North Wilmington at the end of 2005.
The units are in the Los Angeles basin north of the city of Long Beach.
The company had hiked Townlot
production to more than 2,000 b/d
in late January 2007 from 375 b/d at
acquisition and said it is beginning
to see the effects of its waterflood in
the Upper Terminal formation. North
Wilmington, where the 2006 program
was to return idle wells to production,
makes close to 400 b/d.
The 2007 budget is $50 million
at Townlot and $18 million at North
Wilmington for drilling and infrastructure. That includes 34 producing and
injection wells at Townlot and 14
new wells and 12 recompletions at
Fig. 1
North Wilmington.
The units produce oil mainly
from the Upper Terminal at 4,000
ft and the shallower Ranger and Tar
formations, all Tertiary in age. The
deeper Ford zone has produced
4.1% of 70 million bbl of OOIP at
Townlot.
The strategy at Townlot is to
develop seven-spot waterflood patterns in the Ranger and Upper Terminal formations. Meanwhile, the

not waterflood the Tar zone.
The company plans to construct as
many as five doublewide drilling cellars
at Townlot that can each accommodate

two rows of wells in open cementlined trenches. This permits production
equipment to be located below ground
level.

A skid-mounted drilling rig allows for rapid rig moves, and all fluid

and 320-acre well spacing for a 40-sqmile area in northern St. Clair County.
The field, proposed to be named Big
Canoe Creek, is underlain by a Cambrian Conasauga shale gas pool logged as
productive between 1,946 ft and 6,944
ft in Dominion’s Newman well in SW
NE 27-13s-4e, St. Clair County. Dominion spud the well on Apr. 6, 2006, and
drilled to TD 7,039 ft.
The upper and lower productive limits of the Conasauga shale gas pool in
the proposed field have yet to be fully
defined, Dominion’s application said.
The area: 24, 25, and 36-13s-3e;
19 through 36-13s-4e; 19, 20, and 29
through 32-13s-5e; 1 and 12-14s-3e;
and 1 through 11-14s-4e.
Overall, operators have taken several hundred thousand acres aimed at
exploring shale plays in the Valley and
Ridge and in the Black Warrior basin to
the west. Leasing is reported in Etowah
and Cherokee counties, Alabama, and
at least as far northeast as Chattooga
County, Georgia.
Dominion has drilled at least eight
wells in the general area in the past year
or more.
The company also asked that “production allowables be established and
that production royalties be escrowed
pending further orders of the board,
after notice to establish the ultimate
production unit.”
Parent company Dominion, Richmond, Va., in November 2006 announced plans to divest most of its oil

and gas assets by mid-2007 to concentrate on its electricity generation
and utility businesses (OGJ Online,
Nov. 1, 2006).

Dominion E&P claims 6.6 tcf of
proved gas reserves, of which it would
retain 1.1 tcf of low-risk properties in
the Appalachian basin. ✦

Eastern France CBM well encouraging
European Gas Ltd., Perth, is drilling
a second well after reporting “highly
encouraging results” from its first coalbed methane stratigraphic well on the
St. Avold portion of the Bleue Lorraine
Permit in northeastern France.
Meanwhile, European Gas was
awarded Bleue Lorraine Sud, a 528 sq
km permit contiguous to the south, for
five years, said Gilbert Clark, European
Gas manager for France. He said, “The
acreage covers the same coal sequences
as Bleue Lorraine.”
The Folschviller-1 directional well
went to TD 1,306 m and cored the
Westphalian D coal-bearing sequence
from 705 m to TD. The well encountered 60 m of coal in four seams each
more than 10 m thick.
The company reported gas content
of 9.5 cu m/ton and permeability of up
to 2.8 md, higher than expected. The

coal is likely to be able to sustain gas
flow at this drillsite, it said.
The well is just east of the town and
coal mine named Folschviller. The mine,
in operation 30 years and considered
exceptionally gassy, was closed in 1979.
European Gas spud the second well, at
Diebling on the Alsting portion of the
permit 20 km northeast of Folschviller-1, in November 2006. The first well
confirmed that the Westphalian D coals
are mostly analogous to and thicker
than the Hartshorne coals in the Arkoma basin in eastern Oklahoma.
The 460 sq km Bleue Lorraine Permit is near the border with Germany
and 55 km southeast of the border with
Luxembourg. European Gas is drilling
on a farmout from Heritage Petroleum
PLC, London. In late 2005, the companies estimated gas in place on 15% of

Oil field operators have employed
numerous treatment methods, both
mechanical and chemical, to reduce
water production rates. But central to
determining the treatment method is a
cost-effective plan for diagnosing and
solving the excess water production
problem.
Water cuts in producing wells typically increase as oil fields mature with
estimated water disposal cost of about
$40 billion worldwide.
Treatments in two oil wells in Egypt
operated by Khalda Petroleum Co., an
international joint-venture company,
illustrate successful jobs for reducing
excess water cut.

Water production

O D U C T I O N
Recognizing the
problem

Oil field operators
need to recognize that
there are two distinct
types of water producProduction
tion.
The first type, usually occurring later in the life of a
waterflood, is water co-produced with
oil because of the fractional flow
characteristics in reservoir porous
rock. A reduction of this water
production correspondingly would
lead to reduced oil production.
The second type of water production directly competes with
oil production. This water usually
flows into the wellbore through a different path than the oil, such as from
water coning, cross flow, or high-permeability water channels. In these cases,
reducing water production often can
lead to greater pressure drawdowns
with subsequent increases in oil producing rates. Water shutoff treatments
should target this second type of water
production.
Three common indications of a water problem are: 3 4
1. Some wells exhibiting a sudden
increase in water cut.
2. A well or pattern of wells may
start producing at a much higher water/oil ratio than similar patterns.
3. Plots of fluid production vs. time

Approach diagnoses,
reduces water cut

Worldwide oil production is about
75 million b/d with water production
estimates varying between 300-400
million b/d. The ratio of 4-5 bbl of water/1 bbl of oil produced is a conservative estimate.1
High water production increases
both lifting and water disposal costs,
while it reduces oil production. It also
causes additional maintenance for production equipment and requires downhole treating for corrosion, bacteria,
scale, and naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM).
Water-treatment costs are in the
range of $0.75-2/bbl onshore and $13/bbl offshore.2

Bahariya reservoirs that consist of laminated sandstone divided into two main
horizons: Lower Bahariya (LBAH) and
Upper Bahariya (UBAH). The Lower
Bahariya is the main producing interval,
providing about 70% of the field’s total
production. The interval has good quality sand with a permeability up to 400
md and porosity of up to 24%.
The Upper Bahariya has lower quality
rock consisting of thin sand streaks interbedded with shale and carbonate barriers.
The operator is currently developing the
zone with hydraulic fracturing, not only
in Kahraman-C field but also in most
other fields in the Khalda concession.
The Bahariya reservoirs lie at about
–5,700 ft subsea.
Well Kahraman-C41 was drilled in
February 2005 as part of the integrated
plan for developing both the upper and
lower Bahariya to the west of Kahraman-C field. The petrophysical analysis
revealed 41 ft of good quality pay with
an average 23% porosity and average
40% water saturation.
The LBAH in the well was as good as
the LBAH that produces in the west area
of Kahraman-C field. A repeat formation
tester (RFT) was not recorded in this
well, however, at almost the same drilling time, an RFT was run in the offset
Kahraman-C46 well, which is 560-m
away.
The Kahraman-C46 RFT showed
pressures of 970 psi in the main producing sand, 1,500 psi in the wet sand
right below the main producing sand,
and 2,600 psi in the wet sand further
downhole.
The initial LBAH intervals perforated in Kahraman-C41 were at 6,5406,554 and 6,566-6,590. The test of the
intervals with nitrogen lift produced
all water at 960 b/d. The water had a
78,500-ppm chloride content, which is
the same as in Bahariya water.
Review of the cement-bond log-variable density (CBL-VDL) log showed bad
cement behind the casing with almost
free pipe. This indicated that cross flow
from the high-pressure wet sand into
the low-pressure oil zone through the
channels behind the casing may be

causing the water problem.
To remedy the problem, the operator
performed a cement squeeze with 17.5
bbl of cement through the perforated
intervals. After drilling out the cement
and cleaning the hole, the operator perforated the LBAH intervals 6,540-6,554
and 6,566-6,580.
The test of the well with nitrogen
lift again produced 100% water at 222
b/d. The water contained 79,900 ppm
chlorides.
A new CBL-VDL showed some cement improvement against the LBAH
compared to the original CBL-VDL that

showed almost free pipe.
The offset well in the same reservoir,
560-m away, produced oil with a low
water cut, about 5%.
Based on this information, the conclusion was that water had cross flowed
from the high-pressure wet sand to
the low-pressure oil zone through the
channels behind the casing after the initial perforation of the LBAH and during
the first test. During that period, water
had moved from the wet sand into the
oil zone because of the high-pressure
difference. This resulted in the 100%
water cut during the second test after
the cement squeeze job.

The cement squeeze job appeared
successful, as indicated by the drop in
production between the two tests, 950
b/d in the first and 222 b/d in the
second.
The operator decided to complete
the well and run an electric submersible
pump (FC-450) that could handle up
to 500 b/d and remove the water that
had crossed flow into the oil zone. This
proved to be the right decision because
a test 6 days later produced 385 b/d of
fluid with a 8% water cut or 354 bo/d.
The well to October 2006 had produced a cumulative 260,000 bbl of oil,
and the production rate in October was
still 380 b/d of fluid with a 5% water
cut or 360 bo/d (Fig. 3).

TUT-33
Another example of a successful water shut off treatment is from TUT field,
in the Khalda Ridge concession on the
border separating the Khalda and Agiba
concessions (Fig. 2).
Well TUT-01 discovered the field in
1986. It currently has 21 oil producing
wells and 3 water-injection wells. Production is from the AEB, Kharita, and
Bahariya formations. TUT field is one
of the largest in the Khalda concession,
having produced about 15% of the total
oil from the area.
The Kharita formation is a very
high quality stratified sandstone with
a permeability of up to 1,000 md. The
formation normally has multiple zones,
each having its own aquifer. The reservoirs produce under an active water
drive. In TUT field, the Kharita lies at
about –6,300 ft subsea.
Well TUT-33, drilled in April 1999,
targeted the Kharita and AEB reservoirs.
The petrophysical analysis revealed 16
ft of good quality pay in Kharita Zone II
that has a 19% porosity, and 12% water
saturation, and 19 ft of better quality pay in Kharita Zone I that has 28%
porosity, and 13% water saturation.
The well, completed through the
two zones commingled, produced with
an ESP at an initial rate of 2,136 b/d
of fluid with a 53% water cut or 1,004
bo/d (Fig. 4).

O D U C T I O N

In July 2000, the water cut reached
80% (Fig. 4). The operator, therefore,
decided to work over the well to identify the water source. The belief was
that Zone II was the source. Thus it was
tested separately after isolating Zone
I between two packers. Zone II tested
2,370 b/d of fluid with a 93% water
cut or 166 bo/d.
Because of the considerable oil rate,
the operator decided to keep producing
from both zones commingled.
In mid November 2004, water cut
reached 90% (Fig. 4); thus the operator
again decided to test Zone II separately.
The test produced 2,738 b/d of fluid
with a 98% water cut or 55 bo/d. After
isolating Zone II with a bridge plug,
the operated tested Zone I on Nov. 17,
2004. That zone produced 1,846 b/d
of fluid with a 93% water cut or 130
bo/d.
These tests indicated that the highpressure difference may be causing
cross flow from Zone II into Zone I.
The operator, therefore, completed only
Zone I with Zone II being isolated mechanically with a bridge plug.
Production during the next few days
confirmed the cross flow. Five days
after the completion work, the well
tested at 1,835 b/d of fluid with a 41%
water cut or 1,083 bo/d. The water cut
continued to drop to 41% from 93%
(Fig. 4).
The next tests continued to confirm
the cross flow. On Dec. 12, 2004, the
well tested at 1,962 b/d fluid with a
51% water cut or 961 bo/d. The well
after about 2 years of production produces with 90% water cut, which is less
than on the first test.
The well during 2 years has produced
a cumulative 400,000 bbl of oil. ✦

US tax credits for
biodiesel mixtures can
provide significant tax
advantages for producers that understand and
properly follow the reguRefining
lations, which continue
to be in effect through
Dec. 31, 2008.1 US refiners should
understand these benefits if and when
they blend biodiesel into final fuel
products.
Currently, an income tax credit
of $1/gal for agricultural biodiesel
(agri-biodiesel) and 50¢/gal of
biodiesel is available to producers
of biodiesel mixtures.
The American Jobs Creation
Act signed by Pres. George W. Bush in
2004 established a federal tax credit for
production of biodiesel fuel and biodiesel fuel mixtures produced after Dec.
31, 2004. According to the Internal
Revenue Code, producers of biodiesel
mixtures are able to receive a payment
from the US Treasury for any biodiesel
credits earned in excess of the excise tax
attributable to the biodiesel mixture set
forth on a quarterly return.
Biodiesel is a diesel-equivalent,
processed fuel derived from biological
sources, divided into two categories by
the Internal Revenue Code: biodiesel
and agri-biodiesel. Agri-biodiesel is distinguished from biodiesel in the code
and refers to a special type of biodiesel
derived solely from virgin oils, including esters derived from virgin vegetable
oils from corn, soybeans, other plant
matter, and animal fats.
The use of agri-biodiesel in biodiesel
fuel mixtures yields a $1/gal tax credit
compared with a 50¢/gal credit for
regular biodiesel.

of kerosine.1
The producer may
only claim the credit if it
sells or uses this mixture
it has produced.1 The
Alternate Fuels credit applies to each
gallon of biodiesel used
to produce the mixture,
but only if the mixture is sold by the
blender for use as a fuel or is used in

Biodiesel tax credits present signiﬁcant
ﬁnancial incentives if handled properly

Biodiesel mixture credit
A producer of a biodiesel mixture
can make a claim for the biodiesel used
to make the mixture itself.1 To receive
the credit, the producer must make a
“qualified biodiesel mixture,” which is
a mixture of biodiesel and diesel fuel
determined without regard to any use

the producer’s trade or business.1
Example: If a refiner uses 1,000 gal
of biodiesel to produce 5,000 gal of a
qualified biodiesel fuel mixture, that
refiner will be entitled to a biodiesel
mixture credit of $500 (1,000 gal x
50¢/gal). If the refiner had used agribiodiesel, the credit would be $1,000
(1,000 gal x $1/gal).
The taxpayer may claim the biodiesel
mixture credit on a quarterly basis and
produce a Certificate for Biodiesel in
order to make a claim.
Section 6426 allows a credit against
the excise tax imposed on taxable fuel
for blenders of biodiesel that qualify
for the biodiesel mixture credit. To the
extent that the taxpayer’s biodiesel mixture credit exceeds that taxpayer’s excise
tax liability for any particular quarter,
the blender may request an income tax
credit or a payment from the IRS.1
Each request must include:
• The amount of agri-biodiesel and
biodiesel in the biodiesel mixture.
• A copy of a Certificate for Biodiesel.
• A statement by the claimant that
it has no reason to believe information
contained in the certificate is false.
The IRS also requires that any
producer of a taxable fuel mixture
containing biodiesel must register as
such with the IRS to claim the biodiesel
mixture credit. Additionally, producers of biodiesel mixtures can receive a

payment from the US Treasury for any
biodiesel credits earned in excess of the
excise tax attributable to the biodiesel
mixture set forth on a quarterly return.
One must only register as a blender
if the taxpayer’s mixture produces a
taxable fuel. If a taxable fuel is not
produced, then no blender registration
is required.
To claim the biodiesel mixture
credit, and any corresponding payments
for credits that exceed excise tax liability, the producer of the mixture must
obtain a Certificate for Biodiesel from
the biodiesel producer. The certificate
must identify the product produced and
percentage of biodiesel and agri-biodiesel in the product.2
The biodiesel mixture credits and
excise tax operate independently of
each other. This means that a blender of
biodiesel fuel can take advantage of the
biodiesel credit even if it has not paid
any excise taxes for taxable fuel.
If a refiner, for example, mixed and
sold a blended biodiesel mixture that
contained less than 4% normal paraffins (an excluded liquid), it would not
have to pay excise tax on the biodiesel
used to create that liquid. The refiner
would, nevertheless, be able to claim
the biodiesel mixture credit for any
biodiesel used in the mixture.

‘Taxable fuel’
The excise tax on taxable fuel may
apply to the biodiesel contained in the
biodiesel mixture.
Pure biodiesel, because it contains
more than 4% normal paraffins, is
not considered a taxable fuel. Section
4081(a)(1) imposes a tax on certain
removals and sales of taxable fuels. Section 4083 defines taxable fuel as diesel
fuel, gasoline, and kerosine. Treasury
Regulations define diesel fuel as any
liquid that, without further processing
or blending, is suitable for use as a fuel
in a diesel-powered highway vehicle or
train.3
The definition of diesel fuel does
not, however, include “excluded liquid.”3 The definition of excluded liquid
includes any liquid that contains less
46

than 4% normal paraffins.3 Mentioned
previously, although biodiesel is suitable
for use as a fuel in a diesel-powered
highway vehicle, it contains less than
4% normal paraffins and is therefore
an excluded liquid and not subject to
excise tax.
If biodiesel, however, is used in the
production of blended taxable fuel, a
tax is imposed on the removal or sale
of the blended taxable fuel containing
the biodiesel.4 The tax is computed on
the difference between the total number
of gallons of blended taxable fuel and
the number of gallons of previously
taxed taxable fuel used to produce that
blended taxable fuel.3
If 800 gal, for example, of taxable
diesel fuel is added to 200 gal of previously untaxed biodiesel to create 1,000
gal of B20 biodiesel fuel, an excise
tax will be imposed on the 200 gal of
biodiesel used to create the mixture. The
biodiesel used in the mixture is taxable
because B20 biodiesel fuel exceeds the
4% normal paraffins base and, therefore, is not an excluded liquid, but a
taxable fuel.
A discussion of when the excise tax
rate is applied (i.e., at what stage of the
process) is beyond the scope of this
article.
The IRS has published no guide for
when a biodiesel mixture ceases to be
an excluded liquid because it contains
less than 4% normal paraffins. The test
for the amount of normal paraffins
contained in the liquid was originally
meant to apply to mineral spirits, not
biodiesel, but has nevertheless been applied to biodiesel.4
B20 is considered a blended taxable
fuel and does contain more than 4%
normal paraffins.5 The IRS, however, has
published no guide for what concentration of biodiesel to diesel fuel will
cause a liquid to become a blended
taxable fuel.
The IRS has recently released guidance regarding the biodiesel mixture
credit as to what constitutes a qualified biodiesel mixture. Notice 2005-62
notes that the mixture must contain
at least 0.1 vol % of diesel fuel. This

means, for example, that a mixture of
999 gal of biodiesel and 1 gal of diesel
fuel would qualify for the credit.
The biodiesel mixture credit is an
opportunity for biodiesel blenders and
refiners to reduce the excise taxes imposed on the fuel and possibly receive
a payment from the IRS in the event the
credit exceeds any excise taxes.
While financial incentives can be
significant, biodiesel producers need to
consult with their tax and legal advisors to ensure proper application of the
regulations and requirements. ✦

Plans for 2007 construction of both natural gas and products

the year-onyear decline in
the total number of miles set

Operators
plan to complete installation of more than 10,000 miles in
2007 alone (Table 1), with natural gas

coupled with expectations of continued
growth in demand. A surge in natural
gas pipeline activity is also likely this
year in Asia-Pacific, driven by a combination of Chinese demand and Central
Asian, Russian, and Southeast Asian
supplies.
By contrast, natural gas pipeline
plans in the Middle East, Latin America,
and Africa tailed off, with a good deal
of work completed in 2006 and therefore no longer on the books.
Plans for construction of product pipelines in 2007 grew in the US
and Europe, with natural gas liquids
transportation keying US growth while
olefins lines led the way in Europe.
As 2007 began, operators had announced plans to build nearly 67,000
miles of crude oil, product, and natural
gas pipelines beginning this year and
extending into the next decade (Fig. 1),
a substantial increase over data reported
last year (OGJ, Feb. 13, 2006, p. 57) in
this report.
The vast majority (more than 70%)
of these plans is for natural gas pipelines, but this was down somewhat
from the previous year, with the difference split roughly evenly between crude
and product plans.

Outlook

The continued up-tick in worldwide
pipeline construction trends follows
US Energy Information Administration
energy consumption forecasts, which
also show continued growth.
EIA forecast world marketed energy consumption to increase by 71%
through 2030 (using a 2003 baseline),
a period that encompasses the longterm pipeline construction projections
stated here.

year through 2030—led by China at
6%/year, the highest projected growth
rate in the world—compared with 3%
worldwide.
Structural issues that have implications for medium to long-term growth
in China include the pace of reform
affecting inefficient state-owned companies and a banking system that is carrying a large number of nonperforming
loans, according to EIA.
Last month, EIA reduced projected
US energy consumption in 2030 to
131.2 quadrillion btu, 2.7 quadrillion btu lower than the previous year’s
projection. Even with this 2% drop,
however, energy consumption will
still increase more rapidly than energy
production, with net imports therefore
playing an increasingly important role
in meeting demand.
Of particular note in this regard is
the gap between US natural gas demand
and production. EIA projects US natural
gas production in 2030 of 21.15 tcf/
year, compared with the 21.45 tcf/year
projected in December 2005. After
a 2015 peak at 4.6 tcf/year, EIA sees
lower 48 offshore production declining
to 3.3 tcf/year in 2030, as investment
is inadequate to maintain production
levels.
EIA, however, made an even larger
downward revision in its projections of
natural gas consumption in 2030, now
pegged at 26.9 tcf/year vs. the 27.7
tcf/year projected a year earlier. High
natural gas prices in the US will likely
discourage construction of new naturalgas-fired electricity generation plants
between now and 2030, with more
coal-fired wattage planned instead.
Even so, net imports of natural gas
will increase at a 1.5%/year between
now and 2030 in order to meet the
forecast 0.7%/year increase in natural
gas consumption while production
increases 0.5%/year.
Canada will remain the primary
source of US natural gas imports until
2010, according to EIA, after which
LNG will replace Canadian imports as
the primary source. Production declines

and a 1.9%/year growth rate in Canadian consumption will leave less Canadian
gas available for export to the US.
LNG imports will, therefore, meet
much of the increased demand for
natural gas, with EIA’s baseline projection seeing a more rapid increase in
LNG imports than was projected a year
earlier. Liquefaction project delays,
supply constraints, and rapid growth in
global LNG demand will keep the US
LNG market tight until 2012, according
to EIA.
Total net imports of LNG to the
US in EIA’s 2007 reference case will
increase to 4.5 tcf/year in 2030 (0.2
tcf/year higher than the 2006 projection) from 0.6 tcf/year in 2005.
Regardless of how future natural
gas enters the country, however, it will
have to be brought to the end-user via
pipeline, as will future unconventional
domestic production and any new supplies from Alaska.
OGJ has for more than 50 years
tracked applications for US gas pipeline

construction to what is now called the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Applications filed in the 12 months
ending June 30, 2006 (the most recent
1-year period surveyed), suggest a continued strength in terms of US interstate
pipeline construction.
• Some 1,414 miles of pipeline were
proposed for land construction, but
only 6.23 miles were proposed for federal offshore work. For the earlier 12month period ending June 30, 2005,
more than 1,700 miles were proposed
for land construction, with 91.8 miles
proposed for offshore work.
Plans, however, remain well above
the previous 12-month period ending
June 30, 2004, when only 213 miles
were proposed for land construction,
with no miles proposed for expansions
in federal waters.

for new or additional horsepower
at the end of June 2006 accelerated
their recent surge, reaching more than

earlier and 76,000 hp the year before
that.
Notwithstanding the slight downturn in FERC applications, prospects for
oil, natural gas, and products pipeline
construction appear healthy (Tables 1
and 2), led by a surge in expected work
in the US.

Bases, costs
For 2007 only (Table 1), operators
plan to build more than 10,000 miles
of oil and gas pipelines worldwide at
a cost of $18.3 billion. For 2006 only,
companies had planned more than
11,500 miles at a cost of more than
$27.6 billion.
For projects completed after 2007
(Table 2), companies plan to lay nearly
57,000 miles of line and spend more
than $107 billion.
When these companies looked
beyond 2006 last year, they anticipated
spending more than $116 billion to lay
50

more than 50,000 miles of line.
• Projections for 2007 pipeline
mileage reflect only projects likely to be
completed by yearend 2007, including
construction in progress at the start of
the year or set to begin during it.
• Projections for mileage in 2007
and beyond include construction that
might begin in 2007 and be completed
in 2007 or later.
Also included are some long-term
projects judged as probable (such as at
least two pipelines competing to bring
Arctic gas to the continental US), even
if they will not break ground until after
2007.
US average cost-per-mile for onshore
and offshore pipeline construction
(Table 4, OGJ, Sept. 11, 2006, p. 46) on
FERC applications submitted by June
30, 2006, was $1.9 million and $3.5
million, respectively.
Based on historical analysis and a few
exceptions and variations notwithstanding, these projections assume that 90%
of all construction will be onshore and

10% offshore and that pipelines 32 in.
OD or larger are onshore projects.
Following is a breakdown of projected costs, using these assumptions and
OGJ pipeline-cost data:
• Total onshore construction (9,415
miles) for 2007 only will cost more
than $18 billion:
—$956 million for 4-10 in.
—$5.2 billion for 12-20 in.
—$5.8 billion for 22-30 in.
—$6.4 billion for 32 in. and larger.
• Total offshore construction (682
miles) for 2007 only will cost more

Action
What follows is a quick rundown of
major projects in each of the world’s
regions.
Pipeline construction projects mirror
end users’ energy demands, and today
much of that demand centers on natural
gas, with much of the industry’s focus
being on how to get that gas to market
as quickly and efficiently as possible.
The following sections look at both
natural gas and liquids pipelines.

North America
• Natural gas. Competing plans in
the Bahamas to import LNG and then
pipeline the gas to Florida have slowed,
with three competing plans having narrowed to two.

Worldwide Pipeline
Construction

of Suez Energy North America Inc., is
premised on the construction of an
LNG terminal at Freeport Harbor on
Grand Bahama Island. It would involve
installation of 42.8 miles of 24-in. pipe
in US territory from the boundary of
the Exclusive Economic Zone between
Florida and the Bahamas.
The 832-MMcfd project’s estimated
cost is $144 million, but discussions
with the Bahamian government have
slowed to the point that Suez is now
planning an offshore Florida LNG port
as an alternative. The facility would mirror the design of a Suez port planned
for offshore Massachusetts and move
gas ashore through a truncated version
of the already FERC-approved pipeline.
The 842-MMcfd Ocean Express pipeline, proposed by AES Corp., is premised on the construction of an LNG
terminal at Ocean Cay, an industrial site
in the Bahamas. It would entail installation of 54.3 miles of 26-in. mostly
subsea pipeline from the EEZ boundary

to Florida.
Start-up is currently anticipated in
mid-to-late 2008. Ocean Express’ estimated cost is more than $264 million.
El Paso Corp. abandoned its own
plans for a pipeline from the Bahamas
to Florida, citing lack of shipper interest, unresolved environmental issues,
and mounting fears the Bahamian
government would never act on its application.
Elsewhere in North America, the race
to bring Arctic gas south to major US
consuming centers continued.
In late October 2005 Alaska signed
an agreement with ConocoPhillips
regarding the proposed Trans-Alaska
Gas Pipeline. The pipeline would run
more than 3,000 miles across Alaska,
through western Canada, and into the
US Midwest and carry 4.5 bcfd. The
project is expected to cost $20 billion
and projected to take at least 10 years
to build.
The Alaskan governor’s office eventu-

ally completed negotiations with the
other two North Slope producers—BP
PLC and ExxonMobil Corp.— but the
resulting agreement was not passed by
the state legislature.
Included in the state’s proposal were
a 30-year term, state ownership in the
pipeline, and access to the gas for instate use. Alaska said it would invest $4
billion in the project, $1 billion in cash
and $3 billion in financing.
The governor’s office has estimated
that the pipeline could generate $2-3
billion/year in revenues for the state
once it is operational.
In a February 2006 report, FERC
said that further delay of the pipeline
could hurt project economics, potentially opening the door for competing
proposals. Such proposals could include
the $16.1 billion All-Alaska Pipeline,
designed to carry gas from the North
Slope to a liquefaction plant in Valdez
for subsequent shipment to the US
West Coast. The project, however, would

• Crude oil. Export lines for Canadian
crude continued to progress. TransCanada Corp.’s proposed 1,840-mile
Keystone pipeline project is designed
to transport 435,000 b/d of crude oil
from Hardisty, Alta., to Patoka, Ill. In
early November 2005 ConocoPhillips
signed a memorandum of understanding committing to ship oil on the line,
saying that the pipeline would further
integrate its upstream assets in Canada
with its Wood River, Ill., refinery. The
MOU also gave ConocoPhillips Pipe
Line Co. the right to acquire as much
as 50% ownership in the $2.1 billion
pipeline.
Firm long-term shipping contracts
for 340,000 b/d, with an average
duration of 18 years, were secured in
January 2006, prompting TransCanada

to move forward with regulatory filings. These filings included a June 2006
application with the National Energy
Board for transfer of a 530-mile segment of TransCanada’s Canadian Mainline gas pipeline into service as part of
Keystone.
In addition to the 530 miles of
converted line, the Keystone system will
include about 1,100 miles of new pipeline in the US and 230 miles of new
pipeline in Canada. TransCanada filed its
application to construct the Canadian
section in December 2006.
TransCanada has also hosted open
houses concerning a proposal to extend
Keystone from Patoka to Cushing,
Okla. The Cushing Extension would
add about 291 miles of pipe through
Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma at an
estimated $445 million.
TransCanada plans to have the pipeline in service in 2009.

lia prompted an increase in the size of
the proposed Stage 5 expansion of the
Dampier-Bunbury natural gas trunkline
to handle an additional 375 terajoules/
day of natural gas expected to come
online in 2007-09. This will require
laying 1,150 km of pipeline alongside
the existing pipe at an estimated cost of
$1.5 billion (Aus.).
The Indonesian government tendered in January 2006 for the construction of a 1,219-km natural gas pipeline
between Bontang in East Kalimantan
and Semarang in Central Java. The
pipeline, estimated to cost $1.7 billion, would carry 700-1,000 MMcfd of
natural gas.
PT Bakrie & Bros. won the tender to
build and operate the pipeline and in
December 2006 said it plans to proceed
with the project despite doubt voiced
by officials about its feasibility. In January 2007 Indonesian officials said that
they were awaiting the publication of
reliable figures on the country’s natural
gas reserves before deciding whether
to proceed with this line. Attention focused on Cepu gas field in Central Java,
development of which might make the
pipeline redundant.
PT Perusahaan Gas Negara will build
its South Sumatra to West Java Transmission Pipeline Project in two stages. Stage
1 will use 375 km of 32-in. pipe to
move gas from Pagardewa (South Sumatra) to Cilegon (Banten). Stage 2 will
transport natural gas from Pagardewa
to Labuhan Maringgai (South Sumatra)
and from Muara Bekasi (West Java) to
Rawa Maju (West Java) using 100 km of
28 and 32-in pipe.
Indonesia is also considering plans
for a 220-km natural gas pipeline between Cirebon and Bekasi in West Java
at a cost of $200-300 million.
In Kazakhstan, the government is
considering construction of a 20 billion
cu m/year Trans-Caspian gas pipeline
from Aktau to Baku, with the intent of
connecting to the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum
pipeline. Estimated cost of the project is
$3-4 billion.
In China, PetroChina obtained approval from the Chinese government to
58

lay two pipelines to carry oil products
from the northern areas of China to the
country’s central regions. PetroChina
said it will spend about $1.5 billion to
construct the two lines, which could be
operational before the end of 2007.
One pipeline will extend from
Lanzhou, in northwest China’s Gansu
province, and carry 8 million tonnes/
year of products. The other pipeline will
begin in Jinzhou, in northeast China’s
Liaoning province, and carry as much
as 4 million tonnes/year.
The two lines will meet in Zhengzhou, in the central province of Henan.
A planned extension will reach Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province,
south of Henan. The pipelines will
transport products from refineries processing crude oil received by pipeline
from Kazakhstan and Russia.
Kazakhstan and China also agreed
in August 2005 to build a 40 to 48-in.
natural gas pipeline running from western Kazakhstan to China.
China’s own West-East Gas Pipeline,
running 4,000 km from the Xinjiang
Uygar Autonomous region to Shanghai
and other eastern provinces, entered
service in 2004.
The Chinese government is expanding the line to 17 billion cu m/year
from 12 billion cu m/year, requiring
additional compression.
Kazakhstan is not the only country
actively pursuing export projects to
China. In early September 2005, Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed
that the long-discussed crude pipeline
from Taishet, Siberia, would run to
China first, and only later be extended
to the Pacific for exports to Japan.
The first stage of the 4,188-km project called for construction of a 2,400km oil pipeline from Taishet to Skovorodino near the Chinese border and of a
rail oil terminal at the Perevoznaya Bay
at a combined cost of $7.9 billion. The
second stage, depending on development of Eastern Siberian oil fields,
involves construction of a pipeline link
between Skovorodino and Perevoznaya
on Russia’s Pacific Coast.
China looks to import as much as

30 million tonnes/year of crude if a
pipeline spur is built from Skovorodino
to Daquing, while supplies along the
Skovorodino-Perevoznaya route would
total 50 million tonnes/year, the bulk
of which would be exported to Japan.
In February 2006, however, Russia’s
environmental safety supervisory body
rejected the proposed route of the pipeline, which would have taken it within
1 km of Lake Baikal, the world’s largest,
oldest, and deepest freshwater lake and
home to 20% of the world’s fresh water.
The new route is 350-400 km from
Lake Baikal but added 1,920 km to
the pipeline’s overall length (Fig. 3).
Despite this officials remained confident
that the project would be completed by
December 2008.
Last month, Russia’s state-owned
OAO Transneft reported it had constructed about 530 km of the pipeline.
The company plans to lay about 1,250
km in 2007.
The May 2006 agreement over the
pipeline route opened the way for
exploratory work, the preparation of a
technical and economic feasibility study
for the projects, and a determination of
the line’s final cost. China and Russia
began feasibility studies on construction of the spur from Skovorodino to
the Chinese border in October 2006.
Russia is also considering construction of an 8 billion cu m/year natural gas pipeline from Okha, Sakhalin
Island to China, much of which would
parallel a line between Sakhalin and
Khabarovsk, Russia, before crossing the
border into China.
Construction on several sections of
the Sakhalin-2 onshore pipeline system
was halted in October 2006 as Russia
voiced concerns that environmental
laws were being violated. In December,
OAO Gazprom agreed to acquire, for
$7.45 billion, a 50%-plus-one share
stake from Sakhalin-2 project operator
Sakhalin Energy Investment Co. Ltd.—
Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Mitsui & Co.,
and Mitsubishi Corp.
Finally, Turkmenistan and China held
talks in June 2006 regarding construction of a natural gas pipeline from

eastern Turkmenistan to China and joint
development of Turkmen gas fields to
fill the line. The pipe, planned to begin
operations in 2009, would move 30
billion cu m/year.
Turkmenistan also agreed to supply
3.2 bcfd of natural gas to Pakistan over
30 years via the proposed $3.3 billion
Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan
pipeline. India, which attended February 2006 meetings as an observer and
earlier had been invited to join the
project, expressed its willingness to
participate in the 1,680-km pipeline.
A 735-km Afghan segment lies
between a 145 km Turkmen length
and the final 800 km through Pakistan.
An extension off this line is one of the
possibilities China and Turkmenistan are
considering in their plans.

Europe
Work started in early December
2005 on the Russian onshore section
of the North European Gas Pipeline
in Babayevo. This 56-in. segment will

stretch 917 km to the Baltic Sea coast
near Vyborg, linking existing gas pipelines from Siberia to the NEGP project.
Seven compressor stations will provide
the necessary pressure. The pipeline will
cross the Baltic, making landfall near
Greifswald, Germany. This section will
be 1,200 km in length with a 48-in.
OD.
The full system is scheduled to start
operations in 2010 at a capacity of 27.5
billion cu m/year. The project includes
the possibility of building a second,
parallel pipeline, doubling capacity to
about 55 billion cu m/year.
A joint venture consisting of Gazprom (51%), BASF AG (24.5%), and
E.ON AG (24.5%) is building the
pipeline. For the two-leg option, the
total cost for the offshore project will
amount to more than $4 billion (Euro),
with Gazprom investing an additional
$1.3 billion (Euro) in the onshore section.
The Netherlands, Gaz de France,
and Finland have also voiced interest in

participating in the project.
Gasunie plans to expand the gas
transport network in the Netherlands
by 500 km of pipe and four compressor stations at a cost of €1.5 billion.
Expansion activities will be focused on
the route from northeast Netherlands to
southwest Netherlands. Construction is
expected to start in 2009 for completion in 2012.
Gazprom is considering an expansion of its Blue Stream natural gas line
between Russia and Turkey. The $3.2
billion initial pipeline moved 5 billion
cu m of gas in 2005 and is to carry 16
billion cu m/year by 2010.
Medgaz is set to begin construction
of the 8 billion cu m/year Algerian-European gas pipeline bearing the same
name early this year, having received all
regulatory approvals within the scheduled time frames. The project is expected to cost €900 million, with start-up
slated for 2009. This figure includes
past costs of the project, construction,
start-up, and preinstallation of future

North American LNG-driven pipeline projects
With the expectation of continued
growth in LNG imports to the US have
come a number of pipeline projects
to move regasiﬁed material from the
terminal to centers of consumption.
Brief summaries of some these projects
appear below.
• Elba Express. El Paso Corp. subsidiaries will expand the Elba Island
LNG receiving terminal near Savannah,
Ga., and lay the related Elba Express
pipeline. The projects, costing $850
million, will start service in 2010. El
Paso unit Southern Natural Gas Co. will
construct, own, and operate the 191mile, 1.1-bcfd interstate pipeline. The
new line, carrying gas northwest from
the terminal, will consist of 105 miles
of 42-in. pipeline and 86 miles of 36-in.
pipeline.
• Jordan Cove. An equal partnership
of Fort Chicago Energy Partners LP of
Calgary, Northwest Pipeline Corp., and
Paciﬁc Gas & Electric Co. plans to build
a 250-mile pipeline from the Jordon
Cove LNG receiving terminal and
regasiﬁcation plant being developed by
Fort Chicago at Coos Bay, Ore.
The pipeline, scheduled for completion in 2010, would be able to deliver 1
bcfd of natural gas to the Paciﬁc Northwest and beyond, including California
and northern Nevada through existing

extension points in the coastal section.
Medgaz’ offshore length is 210 km
and it will reach a maximum water
depth of 2,160 m. Supplies will come
from the Hassi R’Mel-Beni Saf gas pipeline operated in Algeria by Sonatrach.
Upon landfall in Spain, the pipeline will
link with the Almería-Albacete gas pipeline operated by Enagas, facilitating its
connection to the Spanish and European
gas grid.
Plans to export Algerian gas via Italy
have also progressed, new gas-purchase agreements by five Italian energy
companies having been concluded in
November 2006.

systems.
• Kinder Morgan Louisiana Pipeline.
This pipeline will provide about 3.2
bcfd of take-away capacity from the
Cheniere Sabine Pass LNG terminal
under construction in Cameron Parish,
La. KM will invest about $500 million to
build this pipeline to Evangeline Parish,
La.
The pipeline will consist of two
segments: a 137-mile large-diameter
pipeline with ﬁrm capacity of about 2
bcfd that will connect to various interstate and intrastate pipelines within
Louisiana, and a 1-mile pipeline with
ﬁrm capacity of about 1.2 bcfd that will
connect to KM’s Natural Gas Pipeline
Company of America’s pipeline. Pending regulatory approval, KM expects
the NGPCA lateral to be in service by
Oct. 1, 2008.
• Brunswick Pipeline. As much as
850 MMcfd of gas will ﬂow from the
Canaport LNG terminal near St. John’s,
NB, via the proposed 145 km, 30-in.
Brunswick Pipeline to a connection with
the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline system at the US border near Baileyville,
Me. Construction is scheduled to begin
this year and be completed by late
2008.
• Cameron Interstate Pipeline. This
proposed 36-mile interstate pipeline

will interconnect the Cameron LNG
receipt terminal being developed in
Cameron, La., by Sempra LNG on the
Calcasieu Channel in Cameron Parish,
La., to seven intrastate and interstate
pipelines that transport natural gas to
major market areas in the Midwest and
Northeast. Cameron Interstate Pipeline will have a capacity of 1.5 bcfd of
natural gas and is planned to go into
service in 2008.
• Cove Point LNG. Dominion Cove
Point LNG LP proposed to construct
and operate about 47 miles of 36in. loop pipeline in Calvert, Prince
George’s, and Charles County, Md., as
part of its terminal expansion to allow
it to deliver an additional 800 MMcfd
from the terminal to its connections
with other interstate pipelines. Dominion also proposed construction of
about 81 miles of 24-in. pipeline lateral
in central Pennsylvania and 33 miles of
pipe in other parts of Pennsylvania and
West Virginia as part of the expansion.
Dominion expects the expanded capacity to be in service by 2008.
• Energía Costa Azul. Sempra LNG
will build a 45 mile, 42-in. spur line
and an additional 10 miles of 24-in. line
as part of its Energía Costa Azul LNG
project on the northern Baja peninsula
in Mexico. The 42-in work is to be completed by Aug. 15, 2007, and the 24-in.
work by Dec. 14, 2007.

The companies, Enel, Edison, Hera,
Ascopiave, and Worldenergy, agreed to
import a total of 6 billion cu m/year of
gas from Algeria via the proposed Galsi
pipeline connecting Algeria with Italy
by way of Sardinia.
Sonatrach of Algeria, Enel, and Wintershall of Germany formed a venture
to study feasibility of the pipeline in
December 2001.
The project envisions four pipeline
segments: 640 km onshore between
Hassi R’mel gas field in Algeria and
El Kala on the Algerian coast; 310 km
between El Kala and Cagliari on Sardinia
in water as deep as 1,950 m; 300 km

between Cagliari and Olbia on the
northern Sardinian coast; and 220 km
between Olbia and Pescaia, southeast of
Florence, in water as deep as 900 m.
Sonatrach says the Galsi pipeline will
have a capacity of 8 billion cu m/year
and projects start-up at the end of 2009.
Austria’s OMV Akteingesellschaft
continues to advance the 56-in. Nabucco pipeline, which will bring Central
Asian and Caspian gas to the Baumgarten hub in Austria near the Slovakian
border at 31 billion cu m/year before
moving it on to Western Europe.
The €4 billion pipeline, spanning
2,000 miles, is to be completed by the

end of the decade. The European Commission has given its backing to the
proposal and will accelerate commercial, regulatory, and legal work to build
the pipeline.

Middle East
Iran, Pakistan, and India continued
discussions toward building the longcontemplated gas export line from Iran
to India during 2006. Gazprom has also
expressed interest in participating in the
$7 billion project, which would transport as much as 120 MMcmd of natural
gas from the South Pars field in the Persian Gulf through 2,100 km of 56-in.
OD line. (Iran, 1,100 km; Pakistan, 750
km; India, 250 km).
Natural gas pricing disagreements
have so far worked against the project,
joining already-present forces such as
security concerns and pressure from
the US. Iran has stated that the gas price
expected by India is unacceptable. Iran
is looking for $7.20/MMbtu, with 3%
annual hikes, with India seeking $4.25/
MMbtu.
Pakistan has indicated a requirement of 60 MMcmd and might join
with India in a joint price proposal. Last
month, however, elected Pakistani officials cited Iranian red tape as the reason
the pipeline has yet to progress.
The Dolphin Gas Project, which includes twin 36-in. subsea lines running
80 km from Qatar’s North field to the
Ras Laffan treatment plant and a 48 in.,
364-km subsea export line to Tawilah,
Abu Dhabi, and Jebel Ali, Dubai, is nearing completion following protests from
Saudi Arabia regarding the Qatar-UAE
leg of the pipelines crossing of Saudi
territory. The $3.5 billion project’s initial planned capacity is 2 bcfd. The pipeline, however, would have the capacity
to carry nearly 3.2 bcfd if demand justifies it. Qatar plans to export 200 MMcfd
to Oman starting in 2008.
National Iranian Gas Co. plans steady
pipeline growth, much of which will
be additions to the Iranian Gas Transmission domestic pipeline system. IGAT
lines IV-VIII will encompass more than
3,900 km of 42-56-in. transmission

line and associated trunks.
Outside of this sytem, to meet
growth in gas demand in the northern and eastern provinces of Semnan,
Khorasan, Golestan, and Mazandaran,
NIGC plans a 790 km, 48-in. pipeline
between Parchin and Sangbast, and a
110 km, 40-in. line between Miami and
Jajarm. The system will have four compressor stations and will handle South
Pars gas delivered through IGAT VIII.
To serve the western and northern
provinces of Hamadan, Kordestan, Zanjan, and Western and Eastern Azerbaijan
provinces, NIGC plans to lay 280 km
of 48-in. pipeline between a compressor station at Saveh and the city of Bijar
and 192 km of 40-in. pipeline between
Bijar and Miandoab. Four compressor
stations are planned. Other segments
with diameters of at least 30 in. will
boost pipeline lengths planned for this
region to 950 km.
AMEC PLC began work in 2006 on
a $200-million pipeline in Yemen from
a natural gas field close to the town of
Marib to an LNG terminal being built
close to Bal Haf on the Gulf of Aden.
The project will involve construction of
320 km of 38-in. gas pipeline and 25
km of 20-in. line. Work on the 6.7 million tpy system is now expected to be
completed in 2009, a dispute between
Hunt Oil Co. (an 18% participant in the
project) and the Yemeni government
having delayed the start of construction.
Calvalley Petroleum Inc. will build
and operate 250 km of 16-in. crude oil
pipeline in Yemen between Blocks 9 and
18, crossing several development areas
before reaching a tie-in to an export
pipeline already in place running from
Block 18 to the Ras Isa terminal on the
Red Sea.
Saudi Aramco signed two lump-sum
turnkey contracts with subsidiaries of
J. Ray McDermott SA, which include
engineering, procurement, fabrication,
and installation of the offshore Safaniya
TP-18 tie-in platform, due online in
December 2007, and a 24-in. pipeline
between the new platform and a subsea
connection with a new 42-in. trunkline
flowing to the onshore Safaniya GOSP-1

separation facility.
The second contract is associated
with the 22 km subsea portion of the
new 66 km, 30-in. BKTG-1 pipeline,
which will transport 220 MMcfd of gas
from the Abu Ali plant to the Khursaniyah gas plant. The subsea portion will
be installed by May 2007.

Africa
Nigeria and Algeria met in October
2006 to discuss implementation of the
4,400 km Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline.
Their respective national oil companies, Sonatrach and Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp., signed a joint-venture
agreement to conduct a feasibility study
of the $7 billion project in 2005. Gas
would flow north to Algeria at a rate of
25 billion cu m/year and then on to
Europe.
Installation of the 353-mile main
offshore segment of the West African
Gas Pipeline was completed in 2006.
The estimated $560 million project is
the first regional natural gas transmission system developed in sub-Saharan
Africa. First gas delivery depends on
completion of tie-ins and onshore
facilities.
Sonatrach has secured 30-in. X-60
pipe for the 665 km NK-1 Haoud el
Hamra-to-Skikda oil pipeline.
A Korean consortium led by state
Korea National Oil Corp. agreed to
build a 745-mile gas pipeline from the
Niger Delta to Abuja, as well as associated power generation facilities, in
return for production sharing rights
with NNPC on deepwater oil exploration Blocks 321 and 323.
Global Offshore International Ltd.
received a letter of intent from Perenco
Gabon SA to build the latter’s $50 million Societe d’Energie et d’Eau du Gabon pipeline project. Global’s contract
includes transportation, installation, and
precommissioning of one 8 in. 108km gas pipeline, one 10 in. 98-km gas
pipeline, and associated shore landings.
Global will mobilize its Cheyenne and
Comanche pipelay barges in May 2007
for installation in water up to 30 m
deep along the Gabonese coast. ✦

Fossil fuel days
are over, Turner
informs Houston
When an oil company executive comments on energy trends, television people
discount the observations on the basis of
vested interest.
A television executive, however, lugs
around no such baggage.
So when CNN founder Ted Turner shows
up in Houston to opine about energy and
the environment, people should take note.
Right?

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

“The days of fossil fuels as a fuel are
over,” Turner told the Houston World Affairs
Council Feb. 7 while voicing fear about
global warming. “It’s just a matter of how
soon everybody recognizes it. We only have
one atmosphere.”
Only one atmosphere! Who could have
known?
But there it was, straight from a billionaire with insight unencumbered by connection with anything as nasty as oil and gas.
He must be right.
In response to Turner’s revelation about
the death of fossil fuels, however, Houston
didn’t act eager to abandon its role as an oil
and gas center.
A quick check indicated that rigs were
still drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and
around Texas. Reﬁneries stayed busy along
the coast. Tankers plied the Ship Channel
pretty much as usual.
It must reﬂect failure by the witless to
recognize what Turner—he’s a television
guy, after all—ﬁnds obvious: fossil fuels,
85% of the world’s energy supply—kaput!
And forget war. Forget AIDS. Forget 2
billion human beings living in poverty.
“I think dealing with climate change is
going to be the biggest single challenge
humanity has ever faced, and we’re facing
it now,” he proclaimed.
Remember: Turner’s not an oil guy.
When he speaks of doom, every word is
worth its weight in ethanol.
In fact, Turner’s better than not an oil
guy; he’s a solar guy. He told reporters in
Houston that he recently invested millions
of dollars in a New Jersey solar energy
company.
No vested interest there. It’s solar. It’s
righteous.
Predicting that clean, renewable future
“is going to make a fortune,” Turner praised
wind, too.
So extend the logic. Millions of windmills, spinning furiously...and...and cutting
the atmosphere into two pieces so there’s a
spare on hand when one overheats!
Somebody call Congress.

Crude challenges $60/bbl ceiling
The March contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes jumped to $59.89/bbl
Feb. 9, the highest front-month crude closing on the New York Mercantile Exchange
since late December, as a frigid cold front embraced the eastern US and a pipeline
ﬁre shut in 95% of production at Elk Hills oil and gas ﬁeld near Bakersﬁeld, Calif.
“Crude’s up tick since the start of the year has met ﬁrm resistance at $60/bbl,”
said analysts at Raymond James & Associates Inc. “The fundamentals underlying
the oil market support such a move, although there will likely be proﬁt-taking and
short-covering since prices have shot up about $9/bbl in the last 3 weeks, a result
of continuing cold weather and added geopolitical risk. Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei cautioned about challenging [his country’s] nuclear program as further
pressure could provoke antagonistic targeting of US interests worldwide.”
Meanwhile, Nigeria oil workers contemplated a strike because of rebel attacks
and kidnappings in the Niger Delta oil-producing region. “Technically, the strength
of [the Feb. 8] closing rally has thrown crude oil back into positive momentum,” said
Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland.
A Feb. 6 ﬁre at Elk Hills shut in most of the ﬁeld’s production of 120,000 b/d of oil
equivalent. It is the largest natural gas ﬁeld in California, Raymond James reported,
but its production is 60% liquids. Occidental Petroleum Corp., operator, declared
force majeure, suspending contractual deliveries from that ﬁeld. No timeframe was
given for returning the ﬁeld to production.
The Energy Information Administration said US crude inventories slipped by
400,000 bbl to 324.5 million bbl in the week ended Feb. 2. US gasoline stocks increased 2.6 million bbl to 227.2 million bbl, while distillate fuel inventories declined
by 3.7 million bbl to 136.3 million bbl, with decreases in both heating oil and diesel.
“For the ﬁrst time in a while, the latest US weekly data have demand indications that
are pretty good across the board,” said Paul Horsnel, Barclays Capital Inc., London.
“Heating oil inventories have fallen for a third week, bringing them closer to their
5-year average.” EIA reported the withdrawal of 224 bcf of natural gas from US
underground storage. US gas storage was at 2.3 tcf, ﬁnally dropping below year-ago
levels by 26 bcf but still above the 5-year average by 378 bcf.
Golden corn
High energy prices have attracted media attention for many months, but corn
prices also are at record high levels on the Chicago Board of Trade, hovering around
$4/bushel since December, well above the average price of $2.40/bushel over the last
10 years.
“This current price rally is based on expectations for the coming ethanol production boom to stretch corn demand beyond US farmers’ ability to supply, which
is a more enduring price driver,” said Jacques Rousseau, senior energy analyst at
Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc., Arlington, Va. Corn prices escalated more
than 70% in 2006, primarily because of increased demand for ethanol. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show the rise in corn prices also coincides with a
substantial increase in noncommercial net long positions.
With the market price for corn escalating, US farmers planted 78 million acres
with corn last year. In Midwest farms and markets, there is speculation that an additional 6-12 million acres of corn will be planted in 2007, “with recent surveys at the
top of the range,” Rousseau said in a Feb. 7 report.
“An extra 10 million acres coming into corn in 2007 and a 159 million bushel/acre
average yield suggests a record 12.6 billion bushel harvest and increased season-ending corn inventories,” said Rousseau. “Our model assumes a 4 billion gal
year-over-year increase in ethanol production from September 2007-August 2008,
representing a 1.5 billion bushel increase in corn demand.”
The lure of an El Dorado of corn and ethanol has many US farmers demanding
to pull idle farmland out of government conservation programs to cash in on this
golden opportunity. As a result, the US Agriculture Department is considering releasing acreage from its Conservation Reserve Program in order to produce more corn
for ethanol. That program pays farmers to idle environmentally sensitive low-producing land. A decision is expected by early summer, but the acreage wouldn’t go
into production until 2008, ofﬁcials said.
Meanwhile, Rousseau warned, “A number of these ethanol projects have yet to
begin construction and could be delayed or canceled. Although corn futures prices
are currently well above our forecasts, we believe it is important to understand the
context and that prices could reverse as quickly as they rose.”

“Shielding: Preventing or diverting the cathodic
protection current from its intended path”
NACE Standard RP0169-2002, “Control of External Corrosion on Underground
or Submerged Metallic Piping Systems”

“Materials and construction practices that create
electrical shielding should not be used on the pipeline”
NACE Standard RPO169-2002, “Control of External Corrosion on Underground
or Submerged Metallic Piping Systems

“Coating material for external corrosion control under
§ 195.557 must...Support any supplemental cathodic
protection”
49 CFR Ch. 1 (10-1-04 Edition, p. 198.)

Evidence of CP shielding problems grows stronger every
month. In October 2006 alone, no less than five articles(1)
discussing cathodic shielding problems appeared in
pipeline technical trade publications.
Solid film back coatings such as shrink sleeves, 3 layer
systems, and tapes are proven to shield.
Several other types of corrosion coatings “may or may
not” shield.
Only FBE and Polyguard RD-6 are proven not to shield
when adequate CP is available.
Non-shielding coatings such as RD-6 are often called
“Fail/safe”. Fail/safe coatings, in the event of failure
(disbondment) are designed to permit protective CP
currents to reach water in the disbonded area.
So, since the use of corrosion coatings that shield CP is
contrary to NACE RP0169-2002, and is contrary to DOT
regulations as published in 49CFR§195.557, the question is:

“Does your organization require that coatings be
CP compatible when disbondments occur?”
If the answer is “no”, we suggest:
1. Visit Polyguard’s website and review the large body of
published and other information about shielding problems.
2. Talk to operators who have used Polyguard’s RD-6
system. (There are many). Ask them if they know of
any serious corrosion or SCC ever found under RD-6.
(We don’t, even after 19 years)
3. Have someone in your organization attend the NACE
course “Coatings in Conjunction with Cathodic Protection”.
Polyguard RD-6. Fail /Safe. A 19 years track record. It’s
time for some serious advertising. Check us out.

website.

It’s Perfectly Logical

RHEO-LOGICSM
Constant Rheology Synthetic Base Mud
In deepwater applications, Synthetic Base Mud systems (SBMs) are the drilling fluids
of choice in order to manage potential risks and well costs. However, with conventional
SBMs, managing hydraulic pressure can be challenging as the effects of temperature
and pressure change the viscosity of the fluid downhole. This often leads to incidents
of lost circulation, increased NPT and higher project costs.
Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids introduces RHEO-LOGICSM, a new generation of
Constant Rheology SBM bringing greatly improved pressure management and

drilling performance to the deepwater industry.
RHEO-LOGIC is simple by design, easy to use, and does not exhibit the elevated
viscosity profile of competitors’ systems. This low maintenance, cost effective system has
been repeatedly field proven to reduce mud losses, allow increased trip speeds, improve
hole cleaning, and enhance overall drilling efficiency in critical deepwater wells.
For all your deepwater SBM applications, choose RHEO-LOGIC. It’s Perfectly Logical.

Pipeline integrity concerns pressuring
industry to zero-fault mode

G

rowing concerns over national security, environmental and human safety, and energy supply reliability are stepping up the pressure on the pipeline industry to strive for a zero-fault standard for
pipeline integrity.
At the same time, the industry must contend with evergrowing demand for oil and natural gas, an aging global
pipeline infrastructure, a shortfall of skilled talent, and
rising costs.
The convergence of these factors have created an extremely challenging environment for industry to formulate new strategies and to develop new technologies to ensure the integrity
of existing and future pipelines.

Pipeline integrity philosophy
Ensuring pipeline integrity is about more than just searching
for technology solutions—it’s about adhering to a philosophy
of sticking to the basics, said Phillip Morrison, vice-president,
pipeline integrity products and services, T.D. Williamson Inc.
(TDW), Tulsa.
“If you take a close look at the history of TDW, you will
clearly see that we are a long-term leader in the development
of pipeline maintenance technology, which of course includes
tools, products, and service techniques. Many of the most dependable technologies in use worldwide were ﬁrst developed
by our engineers,” he said.
“TDW believes in the pursuit and reﬁnement of technolo-

doing so with safe operating practices in order to maintain safe
facilities is essential to protecting the environment,” he said.
At the same time, the pipeline industry must cope with an
often cumbersome regulatory and permitting regime even in its
efforts to ensure pipeline integrity.
“Currently, when a pipeline is tested either by hydrotest or
smart tool, there is always the challenge of visual inspection
and repair. If the area of concern falls within a wetland, state
or federal lands, or [has] other ecological signiﬁcant properties,
then a permit is required by one or more agencies that have
jurisdiction over these types of properties,” Edgar pointed out.
“The process to obtain these approvals can sometimes take a
substantial amount of time. This process has to be reviewed
and changed to allow pipeline companies early entry for the
integrity digs and follow-up with the agencies with an after-thefact permit.”
Another big environmental challenge for the pipeline industry is an indirect challenge, Edgar added: transporting low-sulfur
diesel and maintaining its low-sulfur content without contaminating the product.
Simply increasing public awareness of how excavation often
damages pipelines may be the most effective simple solution
to preventing environmental damage by pipelines.
“The greatest cause of large releases is third-party damage,” Edgar said. “To minimize this, we need to increase public
education programs.”
Morrison concurred: “Every hour of every day, someone
somewhere is damaging a pipeline. This cannot be allowed to
continue. We need increased awareness, improved vigilance,
and the technology to detect damage when it occurs.”
Edgar noted that the industry is inching closer to having a national “811” number for excavators to call before
excavating.

“This system will decrease third-party damages because it
will be easier to remember and use,” he said. “Hopefully, having a national 811 system will also result in having nationally
consistent rules and regulations concerning the requirement to
call before you dig.”

New challenges
Posing new challenges for the industry is the fact that pipeline
integrity issues are now moving into systems that have not
been regulated in the past, Morrison pointed out. “For the most
part, these systems are not compatible with technologies used
today on larger, longer, and straighter lines. It may soon become evident that creating regulations for these difﬁcult lines is
the easy part and proving them safe will be difﬁcult.”
Another area of concern is aging pipelines, he added.
“An entire worldwide generation of pipelines has now become a seriously aged infrastructure. Our current global system for producing and transporting natural gas and hazardous
liquids may become unable to deliver the energy needed within
the next 10 years.
“Owner company and service company personnel changes
over the years have caused a signiﬁcant loss of corporate memory about each pipeline and how it was built, how it operates,
what could be wrong with it, and what could be done to make
it better.
“We need to attempt to stop such a tremendous loss of
memory and try to preserve this vital information to assure
future pipeline performance. The answer could be a focused
program established to collect, verify, and maintain essential
data on every pipeline.
“Once assimilated, this valuable information can be permanently archived, updated, and passed along if ownership or operational management should change.” ]

Pipeline challenges magnified in arctic,
deepwater conditions

T

he difﬁculties entailed in pipeline installation, operation, and maintenance are magniﬁed dramatically in
the challenging physical and geographical conditions
that deepwater and arctic operations present.
Compounding the challenge of technological solutions to accommodate such conditions is the charge that pipeline operators and contractors carry in these areas, in that they are also

Allen Leatt, chief technology ofﬁce for Acergy SA (formerly Stolt

“At this depth, very large lay tensions are required, resulting in high-speciﬁcation installation vessels and equipment,” he
said. “To meet these challenges Acergy invested in a new 750ton tension J-lay tower for the Acergy Polaris [derrick lay barge].
The tower is now installed and operational on the BP Greater

short,” Leatt said. “However, this is changing with the innovation
of Low Dosage Hydrate Inhibitors now enabling longer tiebacks.
As these lines become more sophisticated (clad lines, heavily
insulated lines, or HDPE water injection lines), onshore fabrication will become more cost-effective.”
Leatt also sees innovations in pipeline insulation characteristics—either active, via electrical heating, or passive, via
improved coatings—making a crucial difference to offshore
pipelay operations.
“Their ability to minimize the requirement for pipe-in-pipe solutions and heavily insulated lines, with their corresponding high
installation tensions, will result in improved project pipelaying
economics,” he said.
For large offshore trunklines, the ability to monitor and record the amount of fatigue every single joint experiences during installation ensures that the as-built documentation represents the material state of the pipeline following installation,
Leatt said.
“Acergy conducted such measurement during the installation of the Langeled Pipeline [in the Norwegian North Sea]
from the Acergy Piper [lay barge]. For the total installation of
900 km, the individual fatigue of every single joint was delivered to the operator as part of the design, fabrication, and
installation dossier.”

New standards needed
Standardizing information about the
world’s offshore pipelines would go a
long way toward aiding pipeline operators and contractors working on the
growing global deepwater infrastructure, according to John Stearns, vicepresident, marine pipeline systems,
INTEC Engineering, Houston. INTEC
is a division of the Heerema Group.
Broader use of geographic information systems (GIS) databases
to store and retrieve information
throughout a project’s life cycle
would be especially beneﬁcial to
deepwater development.
“GIS previously has been the domain of onshore pipelines,” Stearns
noted. INTEC’s vision is to make GIS
database an industry standard. The
database would contain all design
information, material quality assessment/quality control [QA/QC] information, fabrication QA/QC information,
and installation QA/QC information,
as well as inspection, maintenance,

Arctic realms
Leatt also pointed to arctic frontier areas such as the Barents Sea that present signiﬁcant environmental challenges
for contractors.
“As an EPIC [engineering, procurement, installation, and construction] contractor, Acergy recognizes that we occupy a critical
position, even if limited in time, in the lifecycle of a pipeline,” he
said. “The remoteness of operation and environment presents
many challenges for equipment, vessels, and logistics. Lessons

Apart from new deepwater and arctic challenges, Leatt also
expressed concern over the state of the world’s existing offshore pipeline infrastructure.
“As offshore basins mature, the corresponding infrastructure
is aging,” he noted. “As with any maturing asset, the operational
expenditure required to effectively maintain the system increases, while the production curve of the asset decreases.
“Through effective integrity management systems, the pipeline owner effectively manages the environmental risks. Key to
this will be the inspection, maintenance, and repair programs
put in place to ensure proactive management of the pipeline.”
The ﬁnal environmental challenge for the pipeline owners
will be the decommissioning of pipelines, he added. ]

cracking], seam defects, and cracks,” he said. “ILI can reliably detect gross defects but still does not have the capability of reliably detecting and locating smaller defects, such as
corrosion pits.
“If the largest threat is internal and the system can be removed from service, I would tend to look at ILI technology.
The ability for the equipment to locate smaller anomalies with
very accurate X-Y coordinate data is good. ILI also has the
ability to discriminate between internal and external anomalies. It is able to detect actual wall loss.”
However, there are some concerns with ILI, Edgar noted:
“Some ILI tools are unable to see or resolve information inside of cased pipe. Anomaly orientation is still a problem. A
decision must be made to look for anomalies oriented in the
longitudinal direction or in the circumferential direction.
“Finally, the data need to be read and interpreted by a
seasoned ILI technician. There are not enough highly skilled
technicians to go around for the amount of work. The industry
is going through a learning/growth mode at this time.”

most vital contribution to pipeline integrity assurance, contends Allen Leatt, chief technology ofﬁce for Acergy SA (formerly Stolt Offshore), Sunbury-on-Thames, England.
“The ability to monitor, manage, and record real-time information offers enhanced pipeline integrity for pipeline owners,”
he said. “Such systems enable integrity management decisions to be made on the understanding of the actual condition
of the pipeline.”
He noted that several companies have recognized the beneﬁt of real-time simulation for various uses, such as operator
training and process controls (e.g., the expectation of slugs in
a ﬁrst-stage separator).
“Acergy has a team of ﬂow assurance specialists that are
fully capable of providing models as input of the integrated
SCADA/real-time simulation system.”
While SCADA systems and ﬂow modeling software help
make the pipeline operations safer and help operators determine where problems might occur over a vast pipeline network, they’re not measuring the actual changes in the pipe,
Zaghloul pointed out.
“New materials that greatly increase the corrosion resistance or the strength of the pipelines are necessary to

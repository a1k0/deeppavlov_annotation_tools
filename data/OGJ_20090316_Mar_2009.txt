COVER
Petro-Canada is planning to add a 25,000-b/d coker to its
130,000-b/d Montreal refinery. Many refiners in the US and
Canada are adding bottom-of-the-barrel upgrading units to handle
greater volumes of heavy crude. Refiners in the US are also planning for future regulations that tighten specifications for gasoline
and other transportation fuels.The first article in this week’s special
report, p. 52, discusses the different routes refiners can use to
comply with lower regulations for benzene in gasoline.The second
article, p. 56, discusses a possible change in Russia’s tax regime and
how it could affect refiners there. Photo courtesy of Petro-Canada.

Potential with KBC…

OpX – Energy Efficiency Initiative, European Refiner.
KBC holds a long-term working relationship with a client, which operates a
medium-complexity refinery along the coast of Romania. In an effort to improve the
performance and profitability of its operations, the refiner decided to undertake an Energy
Efficiency Improvement Initiative. The work consisted of:






Benchmarking of Refinery Energy Performance
Gap Analysis of Areas of Inefficiency
Fired Heater Assessment
Steam/Power System Modelling and Optimisation
Selective Process Unit Energy Optimisation, including:
- Selected Heat Integration (Pinch) Studies
- Process Unit Simulation (using KBC Petro-SIM™) and Optimisation
 Equipment-level Analysis (furnaces, turbines, exchangers, fouling)
After the analysis was complete, KBC presented recommendations to the client, and within four
months, the refiner reported that the benefits implemented and achieved amounted to USD$4.3
Million/year. KBC was also able to help the client move from the 3rd quartile to the 2nd quartile
of energy efficiency among over 200 other refiners surveyed by KBC around the world.
KBC has performed successful Operational Excellence (OpX) programs for clients around the
world in the areas of:


Operational Planning
Process Optimisation
Energy
HSE

 Reliability, Availability, & Maintenance

GPA09: Gas recovery coming sooner, not later
Rapidly declining US natural gas rig counts and prices are setting the stage for a recovery in both sooner rather than later. That
was the message of Gregory A. Dodd, vice-president for natural gas
marketing and supply at Devon Energy Corp. in remarks made Mar.
10 to the 88th Annual Convention of the Gas Processors Association in San Antonio.
Dodd sees signs of this eventuality in the rapid pace that gas rigs
are being laid down or otherwise pulled away from US gas plays,
especially shale areas. He also said many wells are being completed
but not yet tied into gathering and transmission infrastructure.
The coming recovery is evident in the accelerating rate of production decline, the increased use of natural gas in electric power
generation as falling prices make it more of the fuel of choice, and
the inevitable US economic recovery. Devon, said Dodd, is “getting ready for a turnaround” by, in part, increasing its 2009 capital
budget over 2008.
Natural gas, Dodd said, is “not the fuel of the future but the fuel
of today.” Companies need to be prepared for recovery by reducing
debt and reorganizing management structures to speed decision
making.
They also need to shorten response times for rig mobilization
once recovery begins and be actively influencing policy making,
especially at the federal level. Currently, said Dodd, the story of
natural gas is not getting told in Washington, DC.
LNG will play a critical role, he said, in meeting demand in the
recovery, as it will take US production companies 6 months from
the time rigs are called back to work and increased production
from that new work.

M&A activity rises among UK-based oil, gas ﬁrms
Mergers and acquisitions among UK-listed oil and gas companies soared by more than 70% in the last year, according to law
firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP. The rise could indicate
larger players’ desire to acquire smaller operators, now struggling
to access capital.
Oil prices dropping more than 60% since the peak of $147/bbl
in July 2008 diminished the value of oil and gas firms, and opened
cheaper deals for those who are cash rich enough to weather the
downturn.
FBD said the level of M&A activity in the UK rose despite the
slowdown in pace of global M&A deals. The value of these transactions involving London Stock Exchange-listed companies leapt by
183% to £2.1 billion in 2008. In volume terms they rose to 52
deals, representing a rise of 73%.
“Somewhat against the grain of what we have seen in UK and
global M&A as a whole, activity levels within the oil and gas sector

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

involving London-listed companies in particular have been decidedly busier and look set to become even more intense throughout
2009,” said Simon Marchant, a corporate partner at FBD and head
of the firm’s energy and natural resources group.
In 2008, the industry’s global M&A deals increased by more
than 51% on the previous year. However, they fell by 18% in value
terms to £146 billion.
Last August, Jarpeno Ltd., the investment vehicle of India’s Oil
& Natural Gas Corp., bought Imperial Energy Corp. PLC for $2.6
billion—the largest deal in the UK.

China ‘stocking up’ on world oil, analysts say
China is taking advantage of the worldwide recession to stock
up on foreign oil, last month offering some $43 billion in loans
to foreign oil companies in Brazil, Venezuela, and Russia to secure
future oil supplies.
The flurry of deals comes despite the global recession and a
worldwide decline in oil demand, according to a report by Radio Free Asia, which said that China views those conditions as “an
opportunity” rather than a reason to cut back on its investment
plans.
Philip Andrews-Speed, an energy expert at Scotland’s University
of Dundee, said China is still not putting its trust in the market, but
that its latest overseas deals suggest a new approach.
“The balance between the government and the companies has
changed, so the government now is in the lead, providing these
loans in return for oil,” Andrews-Speed said. “It’s the same set of
objectives but with a different set of cards in the hand.”
Andrews-Speed sees China’s new strategy as more beneficial for
oil development because the state-owned oil companies of Russia, Brazil, and Venezuela all face funding problems in a declining
market.
“These are state companies that don’t have enough money to
develop new reserves as fast as they want to. Thus the Chinese loans
will allow them to move ahead faster and produce additional oil
earlier than we would have expected,” he said.
Experts told RFA that China’s oil loans are a sign of both opportunism and confidence that its economy will recover from the
worldwide recession soon.
In January, China’s oil imports fell 8% to their lowest level in 14
months, the General Administration of Customs reported. But the
government appears to be investing for the longer term.
“Putting aside the current economic crisis, we’re looking for
China’s oil imports to double in only a very few years,” said Andrews-Speed. “So, if you don’t trust the market, you’ll be doing
more of these deals, and now is a very good time to be doing these
deals.” ✦

Development

Chesapeake shuts in gas, may idle more rigs
Chesapeake Energy Corp., Oklahoma City, shut-in 7% of its
operated natural gas and oil production due to low Midcontinent
wellhead prices and is considering a further 10% reduction in
drilling in 2009 if prices stay low the next few months.
The volumes shut in at least through March are 200 MMcfd of
gas and 6,000 b/d of oil.
Chesapeake, however, said it “believes conditions are developing that will support higher prices for natural gas and oil later this
year and in 2010.”
Chesapeake said it was taking the action to protect shareholder
and royalty owner values with Midcontinent gas prices at most
major interstate delivery points at $2.70/MMbtu, a price at which
most gas production is unprofitable.
Chesapeake said, “We believe low wellhead prices combined
with constrained capital availability will likely cause US drilling
activity to decline well beyond the 40% drop already seen since
August 2008. As a result, US natural gas production will begin to
dramatically decline before the end of 2009 and consequently natural gas markets will regain better supply-demand balance by the
end of 2009, if not sooner.”
The company said its attractive hedges and cash availability
provide it with the operational and financial flexibility to shut in
production in periods of unusually low prices, such as the current
market.
A 10% reduction in rigs, if implemented, would be in addition
to a drop to 110 rigs from the 158 it operated in August 2008.

Petrobank slows Bakken work in Saskatchewan
Petrobank Energy & Resources Ltd., Calgary, said it is the largest
Bakken producer in Canada.
The company built the production of its Canadian business unit
to an average of 22,274 boe/d in the 2008 fourth quarter compared with 17,775 boe/d for all of 2008, mainly on strong Bakken
results. The unit’s production was estimated at 22,000 boe/d in
February 2009.
Operating in the Williston basin generally east and northeast
of Weyburn, Sask., Petrobank is running two rigs in the Bakken. It
reduced its activity as commodity prices declined from an average
of eight rigs in 2008 and as many as 10 rigs.
The company drilled 161 net wells in 2008 with a 99.4% success rate and compressed the time from spud to on production to
35 days. It plans to drill 40 wells in 2009 at current prices and as
many as 120 if prices improve.
The company’s recent efforts to further improve Bakken production have focused on increasing the intensity of fracs by several
means.
It is increasing the number of staged fracs from 8 to 11 in its
1,400-m laterals for a 38% increase in frac intensity per square
mile. It is doubling the number of wells per square mile with
shorter 600 to 700-m laterals and 8 fracs in each leg for a 200%
increase in frac intensity.
It is also doubling the number of locations per square mile,
with each well having two 600 to 700-m laterals from a single ver8

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

tical well bore and each leg receiving 8 staged fracs, representing a
400% increase in frac intensity.
Facilities at Viewfield, Creelman, and Freestone, Sask., have been
connected to the main Midale gas processing plant with 100 km of
new pipeline to capture gas and gas liquids produced with the Bakken’s light oil. Together they are conserving more than 6.5 MMcfd
plus NGL. Two more gathering facilities are to be built in 2010 as
drilling spreads north.
Petrobank grew its land base in 2008 to 270 gross (236 net)
square miles.
Since acquiring Peerless Energy Inc. in January 2008, Petrobank
has developed an innovative way to reenter old producing Peerless trilateral wells and perform multistage fracs in the two outside
horizontal legs. Results exceeded expectations.

Bakken player focuses on cutting costs
With rig activity down more than 40% from the peak in late
2008, Encore Acquisition Co., Fort Worth, is focused on reducing
costs, high-grading acreage, and continuing a highly successful refrac program.
The company, which has drilled 24 wells in several areas of its
307,900 acres in the Bakken play, estimates 3.75 billion bbl of oil
in place on its holdings. Initial potential rates averaged 411 b/d.
Low recovery of 1.9% of the oil in place per well based on
300,000 bbl/well presents opportunities for downspacing, improved drilling and completion techniques, and possibly even enhanced recovery once oil prices recovery, the company said Mar.
3.
Encore saw its costs per 640-acre Bakken single-lateral well
climb to $5.2 million in 2008 from $4.5 million in 2007. It has
a goal of reducing the average to $4 million this year. It is already
seeing 8-10% cost savings compared with 2008 wells and needs
another 14% reduction to reach the $4 million goal.
Casing costs, which doubled in 2008, are starting to decline.
Stimulation costs have dropped 40% since mid-2008, and other
costs are 15% lower.
Encore wants to cut $1 million from the cost of 1,280-acre Bakken wells that averaged $6.5 million last year.
The company has drilled 12 operated Middle Bakken wells that
averaged 380 boe/d in the first 7 days on production and 7 Sanish
wells that averaged 487 boe/d. Gas-oil ratio is assumed to be 1,000
scf/st-tk bbl.
Refracs, initiated 9-18 months after the initial completion, are
returning 80,000 bbl of incremental reserves at a cost of $500,000.
Multiple refracs may be possible at many wells.
Encore, producing 3,000 boe/d from the play, has a $73 million budget for 2009 that includes $12 million for land acquisition. It has an interest in 530 identified locations in five areas.
Economics are marginal at $50/bbl and $5/Mcf at $5 million/well
and 250,000-300,000 bbl recovery.
Bakken and Sanish appear to be in communication in some areas where they are separated by less than 20 ft but may be separate
along the Nesson anticline where they are 50-75 ft apart, Encore
said.

New Guinea Energy to fast-track PNG oil appraisal mated rate of 5 b/d had an API gravity of 35° rather than the tradiNew Guinea Energy Ltd., Sydney, intends to fast-track the drilling of its Panakawa oil prospect on the PPL267 onshore permit in
the Papua New Guinea forelands.
The company has just completed a seismic survey in the wholly
owned permit over an area containing an oil seep discovered in
2006.
The seismic data has delineated a fault-closed structure with
16.5 sq km of potential areal closure that the company’s reservoir
engineers suggest could contain around 187 million bbl of oil in
the Cretaceous Toro sandstone reservoir.
The oil found flowing naturally to surface in 2006 at an esti-

tional 55° oil found in the PNG highlands. The company has spent
$7 million (Aus.) over the last 3 years evaluating the region, and it
plans to begin a drilling program in late 2009.
The Panakawa prospect is located just 1 km from the Panakawa
logging and veneer timber plant wharf on the navigable Fly River
which is used to export products direct to international markets
via ships and barges. New Guinea Energy will be able to deliver the
rig and equipment directly from barges to the drill site without the
use of helicopters—a boon for logistics of the operation.
Target depth of the reservoirs is a relatively shallow 2,500
m. ✦

Production

Coastal Energy starts Songkhla oil production
Coastal Energy Co. has begun production from a mobile offshore production unit (MOPU) in Songkhla field in the Gulf of
Thailand following delays caused by poor weather in January.
The field is producing 11,000 b/d from the Songkhla A-01 and
A-03 wells. Coastal Energy used a MOPU different from the originally contracted unit, which had been damaged by the weather.
Production from the Songkhla A-07 exploration well is scheduled
for mid-March and will be tied in.
Randy Bartley, president and chief executive officer of Coastal
Energy said, “The Songkhla wells’ production rates are exceeding
our original estimates. Our combined onshore and offshore production is now [about] 12,800 boe/d. We currently plan to build
our liquidity position and commence another phase of drilling
later in 2009. However, we have no related capital expenditures
committed at this time.”
Last December Coastal Energy successfully completed two wells
on Block G5/43, which ensured an average oil production of 9,000
b/d from Songkhla field (OGJ Online, Dec. 31, 2008).
Coastal Energy, the sole operator of the block, said it has identified numerous undrilled prospects along the northwest margin of
the Songkhla basin.

Total starts production from Nigeria’s Akpo ﬁeld
Total Upstream Nigeria Ltd. (Tupni) has brought on stream
deepwater Akpo gas condensate field in Nigeria a month ahead of
schedule. It expects to reach plateau levels this summer.
Akpo’s production will be ramped up to 175,000 b/d of condensate and 320 MMscfd of gas from 44 wells (22 producers, 20
water injectors, and 2 gas injectors), 22 of which have already
been drilled. Output is being delivered through a 100,000-tonne
dry weight floating production, storage, and offloading vessel. The
FPSO has a capacity of 185,000 b/d and can store up to 2 million
bbl of stabilized liquid hydrocarbons.
The gas, which will go to the Amenam hub, will be used in the

domestic market and at the Nigeria LNG plant on Bonny Island. Gas
and condensate is delivered to a single-point mooring oil terminal
2 km away. The subsea infrastructures transporting the hydrocarbon
effluents consist of 110 km of high-pressure, high-temperature subsea flowlines connected by steel catenary risers to the FPSO.
Akpo is a strategically important field underpinning Total’s
growth strategy as it would harness gas that would otherwise be
flared. It “has been designed as a hybrid development capable of
handling up to 530 MMscfd of high-pressure gas, out of which
185 MMscfd will be reinjected into the reservoir to maximize hydrocarbon recovery, and 320 MMscfd will be exported by pipeline,” said Total.
Akpo, on OML 130, has estimated proved and probable reserves
of 620 millions bbl of condensate and more than 1 tcf of gas. Condensate is 50°. The field, discovered in 2000, is 200 km off Nigeria
in 1,200-1,400 m of water.

Pemex awards drilling, rig contracts
Mexico’s Petroleos Mexicanos, aiming to boost production at
aging fields, has awarded a $687 million oil well drilling contract
to a consortium led by Schlumberger.
The group, which includes Dowell Schlumberger de Mexico,
OFS Servicios, and Drillers Technology de Mexico, will begin drilling 500 wells in the Chicontepec field in April. The contract runs
through June 2012.
Pemex hopes to boost output from Chicontepec to 600,000
b/d from 30,000 b/d, with spending plans for the area pegged at
more than $2.3 billion this year.
Meanwhile, Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. said it will start two
rig contracts with Pemex in 2009. In late July, the 300-ft Ocean
Summit jack up rig will leave the US Gulf of Mexico to start a
476-day contract in Mexico, while Diamond also extended a contract for the Ocean Nugget.
The existing contract, due to expire this month, will last from
April through June 2011 following the extension agreement. ✦

na’s refining capacity in the wake of severe shortages over the past
several years throughout the country, but especially in its southern
regions.
“The refinery will help CNPC better tap the rising demand for
petrochemical products in the Pearl River Delta region,” said Cai
Enming, an executive with China Petroleum and Chemical Association.
Although China’s other two main oil companies, Sinopec and
CNOOC, already have refineries in Guangdong, the facility marks
a new departure for CNPC as most of its existing refineries are located in China’s northeastern and northwestern regions.
Cai underlined the need for CNPC to operate a refinery closer to
the market it serves, saying that, “The cost would be too high for
CNPC to transport its products from these [northern] refineries to
Guangdong.”
Chinese media reported that the project would likely refine
heavy oil imported from Venezuela.
The reports follow an announcement by CNPC on Feb. 13 that
it has started a new research program that aims to lighten heavy
crude oil, enabling it to build several refineries able to process such
Venezuelan oil (OGJ Online, Feb. 20, 2009).

Pertamina renews Balikpapan reﬁnery upgrade
Indonesia’s state-owned PT Pertamina, renewing interest in an
earlier plan, has signed a memorandum of understanding with
Dubai-based Star Petro Energy (ETA Group) and Japan’s Itochu
Corp. to upgrade the country’s 260,000 b/d refinery at Balikpapan
in East Kalimantan.

“By signing the memorandum of commitment, Pertamina and
those companies will hold further talks on upgrading Balikpapan
refinery,” company spokesman Anang Noor said of the signing,
which took place at the World Islamic Economic Forum in Jakarta.
“Cooperating with world-class companies is important in our
efforts to improve ourselves as soon as possible in order to increase
the performance of our refineries,” said Karen Agustiawan, Pertamina president director.
She expressed hope that negotiations with ETA Group and
Itochu would be concluded soon so that the project could be started on time.
State Enterprise Minister Sofyan Djalil, who said that negotiations with the two firms are continuing, estimated the venture as
worth up to $1.7 billion. “It is still a tentative figure,” he said, adding, “We still have to explore the actual price.”
Sofyan said cooperation with the two firms should result in the
improved performance of the refinery in Balikpapan, especially its
processing of residual materials.
So far 30% of the total volume of oil processed by the refinery becomes residue which was sold very cheaply, Sofyan said, expressing hope that the refinery upgrade would enable 100% higher
priced products.
Pertamina has previously said it wanted to boost capacity at the
Balikpapan refinery, which has two crude distillation units with
respective capacities of 200,000 b/d and 60,000 b/d.
Pertamina said it wanted to increase total capacity to 280,000
b/d, switch from sweet crude to cheaper sour crude, and add a
50,000 b/d cracking unit to process heavy residue into gasoline
and petrochemical products. ✦

Alaska outlines intrastate gas pipeline plan

Oman Shipping commissions product tanker

An intrastate natural gas pipeline that extends from Alaska’s
North Slope (ANS) to the Cook Inlet area could cost $4 billion and
be in service as early as 2015, according to state-appointed project
manager Harry Noah. The line would provide gas to meet Alaskan
space heating and industrial demand.
The 800-mile, 24-in. OD pipeline would use two compressor
stations and deliver about 500 MMcfd. Alaska sees the line as a
complement to an eventual trans-Alaska gas pipeline delivering
supplies to the Lower 48.
Two proposals for a natural gas pipeline from ANS into Canada
have advanced to the detailed planning and project development
stage, the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told Congress
on Feb. 20. “At this point in project development, both Denali and
TC Alaska are now fully working towards obtaining quality information to conduct their respective open seasons to obtain shippers
for their pipeline,” FERC said in its seventh report to federal lawmakers on the project (OGJ, Mar. 2, 2009, p. 27).
Noah named a number of tasks to be completed on the in-state
line by June 2011, including guaranteeing a gas supply, obtaining commitments from purchaser, establishing tariffs, obtaining
permits, and turning the project over to a builder-operator. He also
said the project would build on work completed by Enstar and the
Alaska Natural Gas Development Authority.

Oman’s state-owned Oman Shipping Co., as part of a larger
plan aimed at boosting its refined and oil transport capabilities, has commissioned the LR2 Haima product tanker built by
Japan’s Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding.
The 245-m long, 42-m wide vessel, which boasts navigational equipment enabling it to operate in a variety of climatic
conditions, can transport as much as 110,000 tonnes of oil
products and will become the 18th ship in the OSC fleet.
The LR2 Haima is the second ship of its kind to be taken
by Oman, following December’s delivery of the LR2 Liwa. The
vessel represents the latest move by OSC to step up its ability
to carry oil and products.
In mid-December, OSC and Emirates for Trade Agencies
(ETA) signed in Dubai an agreement to establish a 50-50 joint
venture to own three 300,000-tonne crude oil tankers.
The Omani-Emirates agreement followed an announcement
by OSC in September that it planned to raise $4 billion by
the end of 2008, aiming to add 15-20 product tankers to its
fleet, in addition to the order for 10 vessels it announced in
February.
The 10 vessels are due for delivery between November
2011 and April 2012. ✦

Oil and aviation safety
Bob Tippee
Editor
If you’ve never worked with radar,
you can’t fully appreciate the contribution oil companies in the Gulf of
Mexico are making to the safety of air
transportation….
…Unless, of course, you encounter
an Oil & Gas Journal editor who spent 4
years in the US Air Force several decades
ago as a “weapons controller.”
A weapons controller is—or was,
if they no longer have them—like an
air traffic controller with an important
difference.
Air traffic controllers use intermittent positional information provided
by radar about airborne objects to tell
pilots where and how fast to fly in
order to keep aircraft safely distant from
one another.
Weapons controllers use the information to tell pilots how to get close
enough to other aircraft to blast them
out of the sky.
Either species of controller can tell
you a couple of things you need to
know about radar if you’re to know
what Gulf of Mexico producers are doing for air safety.

Rotating rectangles
Anyone who has visited an airport
has seen a radar antenna. It’s a curved
rectangle that rotates atop a tower.
Most radars that track aircraft are—
or were 30-some years ago—pulse
systems. The antenna emits a radio pulse
and listens for reflection signals from
objects out in the wild blue yonder.
Emission of the pulse and detection of
the return signal have to occur in the
20

same sweep of the antenna.
Since the good old days, of course,
improvements in computers, airborne
transponders, and who knows what
else have enhanced the abilities of pulse
radars and ancillary systems to track
aircraft.
As long as radar antennae rotate
close to the ground, however, important
limitations apply. Basically, maximum
range becomes a trade-off with the
antenna rotation rate and, therefore,
sampling frequency. And an antenna
positioned a few tens of feet from the
ground inevitably “paints,” as they used
to say, nearby buildings, utility poles,
hills, birds, and whatnot, creating a
presentation mess known as “ground
clutter.”
While this explanation is very basic
and probably dated in places, it should
illuminate the gains to be had from
elevating radar antennae—or something
better—to altitudes well above ground
level—perhaps into space.
That’s what the Gulf of Mexico oil
and gas industry is helping to accomplish.
A partnership of 44 companies, the
Helicopter Association International
(HAI), and Federal Aviation Administration is implementing for gulf chopper
transport a system destined for use by
all commercial aviation called Automatic
Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, or
ADS-B.
Instead of ground-based radars, ADSB uses signals from Global Positioning
System satellites to monitor air traffic.
In the gulf, that’s a lot of aircraft.
According to Ann Carroll, HAI vicepresident of legislative affairs, 650 helicopters serving oil and gas installations
make as many as 7,500 trips/day in the
500-mile-by-250-mile aerial region off
Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. They
carry an estimated 2.6 million passengers/year.
Until now, pilots of those aircraft

haven’t received the communications,
weather reporting, and surveillance services that FAA provides other domestic
air traffic.
When the necessary equipment is
installed offshore and aboard aircraft,
ADS-B will provide positional and
other information—such as heading,
altitude, speed, aircraft category, call
sign, and distance—simultaneously to
all pilots in the gulf and to controllers
in Houston. Prime among the many
consequent advantages will be improved safety.
To help make this possible, gulf operators are providing space on platforms
and other installations for communications, weather, and other equipment
and helping pay for the work. Carroll
says the value of in-kind services offered by companies in the gulf to support the new system will exceed $100
million over 20 years.
Equipment related to the new aviation system becomes operational as it’s
installed. The partnership’s first offshore
communications site to start up was on
BP’s deepwater Atlantis platform last
Dec. 18.

Improving safety
Carroll expects ADS-B transformation of Gulf of Mexico airspace to be
complete in December. The oil and gas
industry then will have contributed to
a crucial piece of what FAA calls the
Next-Generation Air Transportation System, implementation of which received
approval in 2005 and is expected to
take 20 years.
The space-based perspective and
other improvements over terrestrial
radar systems will, without doubt,
enormously boost the safety and capacity of US air transport.
If aviation officials ever need to get
airplanes within fighting distance of
one another the old-fashioned way,
though, they know whom to call. ✦

Fix the misunderstanding
In a fight over energy policy that is fast becoming fateful, the US oil and gas industry has more
than a political problem. It has an intellectual
problem. Americans don’t think well about energy.
The deficiency is manifest in President Barack
Obama’s federal budget for the 2009-10 fiscal
year—a proposal with menacing portents.
In the political arena, the industry has no
choice: It must oppose the budget—with its new
taxes, repeal of capital-formation tools essential to
small producers, and other horrors. Industry associations and lobbyists are responding in Washington, DC. A few company chiefs are speaking out.
But a political response isn’t enough.

result has been a steady degradation in American thinking about energy, which can be traced
through recent political history.
A place to start is the 2003 State of the Union
address in which former President George W. Bush
held up “energy independence” as a national goal.
He wasn’t the first to trumpet the futile slogan,
of course. But he gave it the stature of his office,
forfeiting a chance to bring realism to energy
policy-making.
In 2005, Congress passed and Bush signed a
comprehensive energy bill that reestablished a
governmental role in fuel choice. The law enshrined the discredited misapprehension that
energy is too important to leave to markets. Early

Our Point of Return to Reﬁnery Technologies.
Today’s reﬁneries are experiencing a thorough change. They have to exploit crude oil resources
more efﬁciently than ever. And they have to ensure maximum ecological compatibility. This is
the challenge to which state-of-the-art reﬁnery technologies have to respond. Lurgi commands
the sustainable processes needed for this change.
We recognize the reﬁneries in all their complexity. We know the mass ﬂows, their energy
balances. We have technologies for optimal desulfurization and fuel upgrading, with a more
varied yield than before. We are able to produce synthesis gas from the most diverse resources:
from coal, natural gas, tar or shaly sand. We have the technology to convert this gas into lowemission fuels.
Our expertise beneﬁts the petroleum industry. And Mother Earth.

Build on our technologies.

Proponents of renewable energies
frequently say those energy forms will
become economic when accomplished
on a very large scale. This article will
discuss the favorable economies of
large-scale operations and describe how
these economies do not apply to most
renewable energy resources.
In addition, proponents of renewable energy claim that experience will

This “learning
curve” observation,
which began in World War II for aircraft
manufacture, quantifies the reduction in
labor effort required to accomplish repetitive manufacturing tasks, and it has
been extended to other circumstances.
Its application to renewable energy is
limited.
A previous OGJ publication discussed
how manufacturing costs and energy
costs move together in a 1.0 correla-

Harry W. Parker
Lake Jackson,Tex.

The value of the exponent varies
with the processes involved, and values
have been widely published. One example of these exponents is given in Table
1. The average value of the exponents in
Table 1 is 0.65, differing little from the
six-tenths rule. So if the capacity of a
facility is increased by a factor of 3 the
six-tenths rule says the required investment cost will be increased by a factor
of only 1.9.
The underlying logic of the sixtenths rule can be illustrated by considering a low-pressure cylindrical tank or
reaction vessel. Its cost is proportional
to the area of material required for its
construction, and its actual function in
a process is proportional to its volume.
For this reason at a constant length-todiameter ratio, costs can be related to
capacities via simple geometry to result
in the following equation:
Cost $2 = Cost $1 (Capacity2/Capacity1)(0.667)
The above exponent of 0.667, twothirds, is an approximate verification of

the six-tenths rule, and it is calculated
only with considerations of geometry.
Labor requirements are proportional
to the 0.2-0.25 power of plant capacity,
according to a reference cited by F.C.
Jelen.3 This greatly reduces the labor requirement for larger plants, again making it more difficult for smaller facilities
to compete with large facilities.

Large scale economies

Extrapolating the rule

The economies of large-scale operations range from large petroleum
refineries and petrochemical complexes
to personal shopping at Wal-Mart. This
observation, published over 60 years
ago, has been quantified in industrial
processes as the “six-tenths rule” relating capital cost and capacity as follows:2

As with all extrapolations, extrapolation of the six-tenths rule must be done
with great caution. When extrapolated
to larger sizes, several constraints may
apply:
• The capability to fabricate, transport, and install larger process equipment items limits the size of processing
units. The realistic expedient is multiunit processing units and multitrain
processing facilities. This practice elimi-

nates much of the economies of scale
indicated by the six-tenths rule.
• Difficulty in scaling up solids
processing facilities, so multiple units
are used. An example is the Lurgi
gasifiers for coal used in the South
Dakota coal gasification facility. Oil
shale retorts have the same constraints.
This constraint is also demonstrated by
construction of many duplicate wind
turbines in a row, rather than just one
exceptionally large one.
• Availability of raw materials and
the shipping charges associated with
them. This constraint applies to many
biomass processes as well as the processing of oil and gas at their initial
production sites.
• Impact on the product market
from a new, large-scale facility. The result may be closure of smaller facilities
producing the same product.
These constraints limit the practical
size of a processing facility, and that size
limit is termed a “world-scale” facility.
The size of the ideal “world-scale” facility may increase as new demands and
technologies develop.

The learning curve

The learning curve is another empirical observation that can be cited to
justify hoped-for reductions in costs
for renewable energy sources. It was
observed and quantified for aircraft
production during WWII. H.J. Behrens
has discussed its mathematical details.4
Simply stated, every time commercial
production of an item is doubled, the
effort required for production of the
next unit is an empirical fraction of the
effort for the final unit of the previous
“doubling.” W.B. Hirschmann generalized this observation as 80% for human

modest levels of land usage, but its investment cost and intermittent availability have prevented large scale commercial usage for supplying the electricity
marketed by utilities.
Solar collectors of all types are rated
on the area that intercepts the sunlight.
For this reason they do not have the
noted economies of larger-scale operations.
Some large-scale economies can be
achieved in the conversion facilities
that utilize the energy collected by solar
collectors. So buying solar collectors is
somewhat analogous to buying carpet
by the square yard or meter except that
a photovoltaic solar cell is a sophisticated, semiconductor device—a flat, very
large junction formed between P-type
and N-type semiconductor materials.
Small solar cells can be installed on
roofs of both commercial and residential buildings with little penalty for
small-scale operations except the cost
of the “interface” that connects them to
the utility grid or to a residence. These
installations are costly, so they remain
dependent on support by regulations,
subsidies, and the environmental concerns of individuals.
Solar-thermal power generation facilities substitute mirrors for semiconductor-based solar cells. They acquire the
cost of continual re-aiming the mirrors
at a receiver on a “steam” boiler, and
are burdened with the thermodynamic
inefficiencies inherent with all “heat
engines.” There are economies of largescale operation to the extent that large
mirror “fields” are practical.
The mechanical and optical problems associated with solar-thermal
power generation are solvable with
existing technologies, but the resulting
high costs have prohibited widespread
commercial applications.
Other constraints on solar energy
include a low intensity relative to industrial furnaces—1/500 according to
one reference.7 In addition, sunlight is
intermittent—when it is needed most
for heating buildings and light, the sun
has set.
Intermittency limits the fraction of

cited efforts with waves and tides for
energy and listed their mechanical and
environmental problems.13 A cost of
40¢/kw-hr was cited in one case, and
many of the projects projected their
major demonstrated results into the
future. Neither wind nor waves have the
economics of very large-scale operations available to them because they are
both local and cyclic.

Storing electric power
Wind and solar power both require
economic and efficient large-scale storage and transmission of electricity. In
favorable locations, limited power storage is accomplished by “pumped storage” at hydroelectric facilities. Water is
just pumped back up to the dam when
there is excess available power, so it will
be available to generate addition power
when it is needed. If the efficiency of
both the pump and turbine are 90%,
the resulting power storage is 81% efficient. This option for power storage is
not generally available, however.
Small-scale electrical storage techniques such as batteries and capacitors are not economically adapted to
large-scale power storage. Electrolysis
of water to hydrogen and oxygen with
wind or solar power has not been demonstrated on an effective scale despite
past efforts, although there are current
efforts in this regard.14
28

Larger electric power grids are a
partial solution, and that option may
include high-voltage direct current as a
power transmission method. Still there
is a strong need for large-scale storage of electric power from both wind
and solar, which may prove physically
impossible.
Compressed air was recently illustrated as a means of storing power, with
a commercial installation in Alabama
cited.12 Natural gas-fired turbines are
well adapted to power storage because
the air compressor on the gas turbine
requires about 60% of the expanders’ horsepower output, leaving only
40% for net electric power generation. Substitution of stored compressed
air for turbine compressed air ideally
releases this 60% of the turbine power
for generation of additional electricity.
When electrical demand is decreased,
air can be compressed and stored for
future use.
There are solvable mechanical
problems associated with these arrangements and several options for their
implementation, including direct compression of air by wind turbines. The
major concern is economical storage of
large volumes of compressed air. Several
options for storage are available such as
salt domes, depleted mines, or mined
caverns. Optimal economic design of

such storage units is not a simple task.
Nuclear explosives can very directly
produce air storage caverns with known
technology. The author has five patents
for retorting oil shale shattered with
nuclear explosives to form a deep vertical cylinder of broken shale known as
a nuclear chimney. One example patent
is referenced.15 These inventions could
be readily modified to store compressed
air simultaneously with retorting oil
shale and even producing hot combustion gases for the expansion turbines.
Because there are several nations developing nuclear weapons in defiance
of world pressures, US restraint in not
using nuclear explosives for peaceful
purposes perhaps should be reconsidered.

Enhanced geothermal
Geothermal energy circumvents the
problems of intermittence associated
with renewable wind and solar energy.
Where available, it provides electric
power conveniently, so Italy, Iceland,
and the western US have considerable
geothermal power production facilities.
This limited-availability resource has
already been largely developed. Conventional geothermal energy depends on
the coincidence of permeable hot rock
and hot water, not a frequent occurrence.
Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS)
depend only on the availability of hot
rock at some economically drillable
depth. Cold water is injected via an
injection well into the hot rock whereupon production wells produce hot
water for power production. The water
circulation process is aided by making numerous hydraulic fractures in
the hot rock. The technique was briefly
demonstrated at the Fenton Hills site in
New Mexico around 1990. Commercial
power was not produced at that time.
However, the Fenton Hills personnel, among others, have continued
their interest in EGS, and information
regarding increased interest in EGS is
available on the internet (Potter Drilling
or Altaenergy).
EGS should be considered on par

with other renewable energy resources. Much effort is
required for EGS’s commercial implementation. It offers the advantages of being continually available and
of making a small footprint on the land and adjacent
environment. Some problems exist such as corrosion and silica solubility in very hot water. Petroleum
production and drilling technologies easily support
development of EGS.
EGS is constrained by the energy content of hot
rock. A 50 Mw-equivalent power plant, for example,
would daily have to remove the thermal energy from
as much as 850,000 cu ft of hot rock in one set of assumptions. The thermal conductivity of rock is rather
low, so extensive and controlled hydraulic fracturing
would be necessary, not an easy task.
A more challenging and interesting task would be
to drill into the magma region near a volcano. Drilling
should be done with water as the drilling fluid under
very high pressure. The result would be local cooling
as the water flashes through the drillbit jets, resulting
in high-pressure steam for geothermal power production. One well, gradually drilled to increased depths,
could continually produce large volumes of steam for
geothermal power.

Italian design
A masterpiece

Biomass
Biomass residues can be used as boiler fuel, and
the forest products industries use their residues as
boiler fuel for their own internal consumption, but
the byproduct may have other value, including returning it to the land.
Both gathering and transporting biomass residue
constrains the size and associated economies of
scale of electric power generation facilities. Recently announced facilities produce only 50 Mw of
electricity.
Liquid fuels from biomass—fermentation ethanol
and biodiesel—are supported by federal regulations
and subsidizes, and agri-industries and farm groups
lobby for them in Congress. However, these biomass
transportation fuels should not even be considered for
favorable federal and state support as long has they are
developed with the use of fossil fuels.
The net energy from fermentation ethanol that
exceeds the fossil energy inputs is a matter of considerable debate. One author averaged several studies of
net energy from fermentation ethanol production and
found it to be a negative 2%.18

Fourth-quarter results slide on weaker oil, gas prices
Marilyn Radler
Senior Editor-Economics
Laura Bell
Statistics Editor
Collectively, a sampling of US and
Canadian operators posted dismal results for the fourth quarter of 2008.
In a group of 48 US-based producers and refiners, 26 recorded a net loss
for the quarter. The group’s full-year
results show that 18 incurred a net loss
for 2008.
In the sample of eight companies
based in Canada, two reported a quarterly loss. As a group, their combined
earnings declined 49% from a year
earlier.
Oil and gas prices plunged during
the quarter, although operating costs
remained high. Some refiners experienced a sharp downturn in earnings
as gasoline prices plummeted on weak
demand and swelling inventories.
Boosting the fourth-quarter results
of some of the operators were net gains
on the mark-to-market of hedges and
30

derivatives contracts. Meanwhile, others
were hard hit by impairment charges.
A sample of service and supply firms
fared much better as a whole for the
fourth quarter and the full year. The
21 companies in this group reported
a combined 3% increase in 2008 net
income compared with 2007, although
their combined earnings for the fourth
quarter were down from a year earlier.
Revenues, however, were up sharply
from a year earlier for both the quarter
and the year.

Prices, margins
In the final 2008 quarter, the frontmonth futures contract for West Texas
Intermediate on the New York Mercantile Exchange averaged $59.06/bbl.
This compares with $118.22/bbl in
third-quarter 2008, and $ 90.50/bbl in
the final 2007 quarter.
Gas prices also fell in the 2008
fourth quarter, with the front-month
NYMEX contract averaging $6.398/
MMbtu, down from $7.392/MMbtu in
fourth-quarter 2007.
High product prices suppressed

demand during the second half of last
year. The average pump price for all
formulas of unleaded gasoline in the
US reached as high as $4.165/gal in
the first week of July 2008, and then
dropped to $1.71/gal in the final week
of last year. Refinery utilization in the
US sank to below 85% in December.
Cash operating margins for refiners
on the US Gulf Coast averaged $5.45/
bbl in the 2008 fourth quarter. This
compares to an average of $8.83/bbl a
year earlier, according to Muse, Stancil,
& Co.

Integrated companies
The integrated firms in the sample
of US-based operators reported weaker
results for the recent quarter compared
with a year earlier. But for the entire
year, revenues and earnings for these
companies were generally improved
from 2007, benefiting from record oil
and gas prices in third-quarter 2008.
These companies’ fourth-quarter
earnings were mostly lower due to
weaker oil prices and higher operating
expenses.

But ConocoPhillips posted a $31.764
billion loss for the fourth quarter due to
charges, including a $7.4 billion writedown on the company’s investment in
Lukoil. ConocoPhillips also recorded a
$25.4 billion impairment of all its E&P
segment goodwill, the difference between the purchase price of assets and
their net worth.
ExxonMobil reported that its $7.82
billion earnings for the fourth quarter
were down as higher downstream margins were partly offset by weaker crude
oil prices, higher operating expenses,
lower chemical volumes, and the lingering impacts of Gulf Coast hurricanes

in the final 2008 quarter.
For the 2008 fourth quarter, ExxonMobil’s revenues were down 28%, and
earnings were down 33% from a year
earlier. For the year 2008, the company’s revenues climbed 18% from 2007,
while net income increased 11% to a
record $45.22 billion.
Chevron Corp. recorded a 26% decline in fourth-quarter 2008 revenues
but a slight gain in net income for the
quarter. Income from the company’s
upstream operations declined to $3.15
billion from $4.84 billion a year earlier.
Meanwhile, Chevron’s refining, marketing, and transportation income soared

to $2.08 billion from $204 million in
the fourth quarter of 2007.
“Fourth-quarter earnings for our
downstream business improved as the
lower cost of crude oil feedstocks used
in the refining process helped boost
margins on the sale of gasoline and
other refined products,” said Chairman
and CEO Dave O’Reilly. “Lower quarterly profits for our upstream operations
reflected a sharp decline in crude oil
prices from a year ago,” O’Reilly said.

Apache Corp. reported a $2.9 billion
loss for the recent quarter and a 75%
drop in its 2008 net income to $712
million, which includes a $3.6 billion noncash, after-tax reduction in the
carrying value of its oil and gas properties stemming from significantly lower
commodity prices at yearend 2008.
Plains Exploration & Production Co.
incurred a similar noncash impairment
charge on its oil and gas properties,
which resulted in losses for the recent

Exco Resources Inc. recorded a net
loss in the recent quarter and for the

Anadarko Petroleum Corp. is among
the E&P companies that posted positive net income for both the full year
and for the fourth quarter of 2008.
Anadarko reported fourth-quarter 2008
net income of $786 million. Of this,
$750 million after tax was due to gains

Holly Corp. and Tesoro Petroleum each
recorded positive net income for the
final 2008 quarter, but Valero Energy
Corp. reported a loss for the 3-month
period. Full-year results revealed a loss
for Holly and Valero and $278 million
in earnings for Tesoro.
Tesoro reported that earnings
climbed to $97 million in fourthquarter 2008 from a $40 million loss
a year earlier, even though revenues
declined 34%. The San Antonio-based
refiner’s expenses for the recent quarter
were down 37% from a year earlier, due
partly to the write-off of a $91 million
receivable for which collection was
deemed unlikely.
Tesoro Petroleum reported that
its fourth quarter segment operating

income of $204 million was $196 million higher than in the fourth quarter
of 2007, primarily due to higher gross
margins, especially in the Hawaii and
California regions, and improved results
from its retail segment. The increase in
segment operating income was partially
offset by lower throughput rates.
Tesoro’s gross refining margin
increased to $12.47/bbl from $8.28/
bbl in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Margin realization improved as a result
of efforts to increase crude flexibility
and distillate production, the company
said.
Valero’s $3.278 billion loss in the
fourth quarter brought the company’s
loss for the year to $1.131 billion.
Excluding a $4.1 billion noncash loss
from the impairment of goodwill
would put Valero’s fourth-quarter 2008
net income at $732 million and fullyear 2008 net income at $2.9 billion.

Holly Corp. reported that the principal factor contributing to its increase
in fourth-quarter 2008 net income was
an increase in refined product margins,
partially offset by a decrease in sulfur
credit sales of $15 million. Overall
refinery gross margins were $12.01/bbl
for the quarter, a 22% increase from the
fourth quarter of 2007.

Canadian ﬁrms
Most of the companies in a sample
of eight producers and pipeline companies based in Canada posted positive net
income for the fourth quarter and for
2008. Four of these firms posted a slide
in earnings from fourth-quarter 2007,
while two incurred a loss for the recent
quarter.
Although its revenues in the quarter climbed 39%, Suncor Energy Inc.
reported a $215 million (Can.) fourth-

quarter 2008 loss vs. $1 billion (Can.)
in earnings a year earlier. The company
said the decline was due primarily to
major decreases in commodity prices in
the 2008 fourth quarter.
“This negatively impacted both our
sales revenues and the value of our
inventories. In addition, we had higher
operating expenses in our oil sands
business. These impacts were partially
offset by mark-to-market gains on our
crude oil hedges,” the company said.

Service, supply companies
The collective net income for a
sample of service, supply, and engineering firms was down 12% for the final
2008 quarter despite a 20% jump in
revenues from a year earlier. Higher
expenses and taxes weighed on some of
the firms’ results.
Baker Hughes Inc. announced that
its net income for fourth-quarter 2008

was $432 million compared with $401
million a year earlier. Net income for
the year 2008 was $1.64 billion, up
from $1.51 billion in 2007.
Chad C. Deaton, Baker Hughes
chairman, president, and chief executive officer, said the company’s fourthquarter results were particularly strong
in the Western Hemisphere despite the

global economic slowdown and eroding commodity prices.
“In North America, service-intensive
horizontal drilling remained strong,
and our completion and production
business posted solid results. Revenue
increases in Brazil and Colombia led a
strong quarter in Latin America. In the
Europe-Africa-Russia-Caspian region,

weakening of local currencies against
the US dollar, a declining Russian
market, as well as weather and projectrelated delays in the North Sea and
Nigeria impacted our results. Sequentially, Middle East-Asia Pacific region
revenue increases were led by strong
results from Saudi Arabia, Indonesia,
and Egypt,” Deaton said. ✦

Think-tank advocates emergency gasoline stockpile
Sam Fletcher
Senior Writer
A Rice University
think-tank said the US
government should
require the oil industry
to maintain “average minimum gasoline inventories” to prevent emergency
supply shortages and price spikes that
occurred after hurricanes hit the Gulf
Coast in 2005 and 2008.
That is arguably the most unusual of
seven proposals for US gasoline policy

S TA F F

cost would be offset allowing a small
price markup that guarantees a rate of
return, much as regulatory agencies
permit in the power generation and
natural gas industries.”

Other proposals
The study recommends that the
Obama administration take additional
steps in formulating a national gasoline
policy:
• Raise the US corporate average fuel
efficiency (CAFÉ) standards to 50 mpg.
• Negotiate an international CAFÉ

COMMENT

included in a series of focused policy
recommendations for President Barack
Obama’s administration issued at the
end of January by the Baker Institute
for Public Policy on the Rice campus in
Houston.
The proposal provides no details of
the mandated inventory program other
than it would be “similar to what is
currently done in Europe.” However, it
said, “A minimum gasoline inventory
level for industry makes more sense
than federal government-held stocks
because of the physical specifications
for gasoline, which has a shorter shelf
life than crude oil. Thus, gasoline inventories would need to be cycled over
time, but this can be done easily by
industry so long as there are prespecified sustained minimum levels.”
The proposal does not stipulate the
minimum amount of inventory nec34

essary to respond to an unexpected
emergency, nor does it say whether the
inventory should be centrally located
or spread among refiners, jobbers, and
retail outlets.
It’s not clear whether stockpiles of
extra gasoline would be limited to the
Gulf Coast where Hurricanes Katrina,
Rita, Gustav, and Ike came ashore. It
doesn’t suggest how far inland extra inventories of gasoline would be required
to fuel evacuations from the coast, nor
does it note whether similar inventories
would be required in parts of California

prone to wildfires and earthquakes or
along the Mississippi and other rivers
where flooding sometimes occurs.
It also doesn’t address the problem
of accessing those inventories if the
electrical power is off, roads are blocked
by debris or water, and civilian employees decide to evacuate their families
instead of reporting to work as military
and government emergency teams are
required to do.
Possibly dual inventories of reformulated and conventional gasolines would
be required, depending on the time
of year and location of the emergency.
Institute officials did not respond to
multiple requests by OGJ for additional
details of the proposal.
A federal requirement to maintain
a certain level of inventory means additional expense for the industry, the
report acknowledges. But, it said, “This

standard among major oil-consuming
countries as part of a global climate
agreement.
• Phase in a higher federal gasoline
tax to maintain conservation gains.
• Establish a special diplomatic energy envoy to China.
• Increase federal spending on new
energy technologies, energy efficiency,
and alternative energy.
• Avoid “overly complex” policies
to restrict carbon in the transportation
sector, such as a national low carbon
fuel standard.
High and rapidly fluctuating gasoline
prices are a problem for low-income
and middle-class US residents and by
transport-dependent businesses, the
study said. Last summer when retail US
gasoline prices averaged $4.11/gal at
the pump, families earning less than
$15,000/year were spending as much

as 15% of their household income on
gasoline—“double the proportion just
7 years earlier,” said Baker Institute officials.
With domestic oil production in
general decline since 1970, the US is
more dependent on foreign oil than
ever. It imported 13.5 million b/d or
65% of total consumption in 2007, up
from 35% of US consumption in 1973.
“US oil demand is up by almost 20%
over demand in 1973,” institute officials reported.
They said the US alone accounted for
45% of the increase in global oil trade
in 1990-2005. This allowed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to “increase its share of the global
market from 38% in 1990 to 43% in
2005—a market share not seen since
1980” at the peak of the last major oil
boom, they said.
“To the extent that the US—or
some group of large oil-consuming
countries—takes actions to reduce oil
demand, it can lower the market price
and reduce the monopoly power of
key oil-producing countries, some of
whom may have hostile intentions
towards the US and its allies,” said the
Baker Institute report.
Yet when the 1979-80 oil boom
went bust in 1981, with oil prices
plummeting by 1986 to the lowest
levels in decades, the first source of oil
eliminated was not OPEC production
with its advantages of large reserves and
low lifting costs, but the marginal highcost, low-production stripper wells in
the US.
Once shut in, most of those stripper
wells could not be returned to production and therefore were lost forever.

However, organized labor is still a

demand flat and funded social programs via “hefty consumer taxes” on
oil and petroleum products. A similar
policy would give the US government
more money to repair aging roads and
bridges while making it more expensive
for motorists to use those facilities.
The additional tax income also
would fund rebates to lower-income
households to offset the regressive
effects of the tax. Perhaps rebates will
act as subsidies so the poor can buy as
much gasoline as the middle class.
The Baker Institute suggests “a
gradual phase-in of a higher gasoline
tax” so consumers will have time to adjust to the additional cost at the pump.
OPEC members have long complained
of consumer nations that heavily tax
fuels while blaming the cartel for high
oil prices.
Abdalla Salem El-Badri, OPEC’s
secretary general, recently said, “Raising
taxes can be to the detriment of both
oil producers and consumers. From the
consumer’s perspective, higher taxes
translate into higher prices at the pump.
This impacts individuals and does little
to instill consumer confidence in the
current economic climate. For producers, higher taxes create further uncertainty for long-term planning in an

And most of the OPEC and non-OPEC
countries are producing at full capacity, so they can’t bring more crude on

However, OPEC has again proven
in recent months that it can reduce
crude production faster than the US can
reduce crude consumption, halting a
sharp drop in oil prices.

More research spending
The Baker Institute also suggested:
“More aggressive research and development spending—particularly in electricity storage and transmission—could
facilitate a switch to hybrid plug-in
electric automobiles that tap renewable
energy as a fuel source to compete with
conventional gasoline.”
It also would require more power
plants burning fossil fuels to meet the
enhanced demand for electricity.
“The existence of viable alternative
energy technologies creates an incentive
for oil producers to avoid price shocks
and supply disruptions for fear that the
new technologies would be more rapidly adopted, permanently displacing
oil use,” said the study. However, it does
not explain how fear of losing market
to alternative fuels will help the industry avoid supply disruptions caused
by hurricanes that break pipelines and
flood refineries or against attacks by
rebels in Nigeria and Iraq that disrupt
oil exports.

EIA replaced its petroleum products
classification this month with a new liquid fuels category that includes natural
gas liquids, biofuels, and liquids derived from other hydrocarbon sources
such as coal and gas.
EIA reported in its latest STEO that
retail gasoline prices, slowly increasing
over the last 2 months, are projected to
average $1.96/gal in 2009 and $2.18/
gal next year.
“The monthly average price [of
regular grade retail gasoline] is expected to peak slightly over $2/gal this year,
although it remains possible that weekly
prices could rise significantly higher at
some point this spring or summer,” EIA
said. “Because of lower motor gasoline
consumption, refining margins for gasoline are expected to remain depressed
for much of 2009 but are expected to
increase slightly in 2010 as consumption begins to recover.”

EIA projects an average on-highway
diesel fuel retail price of $2.19/gal for
2009 and $2.51/gal for 2010. “The expected continuing decline in diesel fuel
consumption in the United States this
year as well as the growing weakness in
distillate fuel usage outside the United
States are projected to result in a narrowing of refining margins for distillate
throughout the forecast period. Because
of the global weakness in industrial
output, it is possible that we will see
diesel prices fall below gasoline prices
this summer,” it added.

Texas, Houston hit hard
The domestic rig count has followed
oil and gas prices down, according to
the Dallas Fed report. Citing figures
compiled by Baker Hughes Inc., it said
the number of rigs making hole peaked
during September 2008 at 2,031
before dropping to 1,720 at yearend

and 1,170 on Mar. 6. “Texas has been a
major part of the slide, accounting for
58% of the fall in the US rig count since
yearend,” it said.
“Production of goods consumed in
the drilling process is falling along with
the rig count, but demand for durable
goods (pump, drill pipe, bits) can be
down as much as 90% as parts are
cannibalized from rigs not in service.
Layoffs are widespread,” it added.
Houston, the nation’s foremost oil
and gas center, is especially feeling the
pain, said the Dallas Fed economists
in their report. “Houston’s growth
advantage over the rest of the nation
during the past 5 years—oil and natural
gas—has not only evaporated in the
face of a global commodity bust but has
turned into a definite liability. The coming year will see significant job losses in
Houston, led by the energy sector,” the
analysts said. ✦

EPA proposes CO2,
greenhouse gas
reporting rule
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
The US Environmental Protection Agency has proposed the first comprehensive
national system for reporting emissions of
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
produced by major sources.
The other gases covered by the proposed rule are methane, nitrous oxide,
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons,
sulfur hexafluoride, and other fluorinated gases, including nitrogen trifluoride
and hydrofluorinated ethers.
EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said
the reporting would provide comprehensive and accurate data about the
production of GHG emissions. The
proposal covers about 13,000 plants,
accounting for 85-90% of GHG emissions in the US, she said.
The rule is being developed under
the authority of the Clean Air Act. The
proposed rule will be open for public
comment for 60 days after publication
in the Federal Register. Public hearings
are scheduled for Apr. 6-7 in Arlington,
Va., and Apr. 16 in Sacramento, Calif.
The new reporting requirements
would apply to suppliers of fossil fuels
and industrial chemicals, manufacturers of motor vehicles and engines, and
large direct emitters of GHG emissions
equal to or greater than a threshold of
25,000 tonnes/year.

Energy
and water

T

he US Congress is finally ready
to talk about the relationship
between energy and water. The
discussion is starting none-too-soon,
as Congress considers ways to curb
greenhouse gases, experts told the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee on Mar. 10.
“Using today’s technologies, efforts
to capture carbon from existing coal
and natural gas plants or from new fossil [fuel] plants would cause increases
in water consumption, a big concern
for some regions, and may increase
the cost of electricity, a concern for
all,” said Carl O. Bauer, director of the
US Department of Energy’s National
Energy Technology Laboratory.
Carbon capture and sequestration
would increase both water and electricity costs, Bauer said. “A doubling of
the price of electricity would raise the
cost of water 25-40% because moving
water over large distances requires substantial amounts of electricity,” he said.
The witnesses appeared before the
committee to discuss S. 531, which

treating, and delivering water consumes
a large amount of energy. Improving
water use efficiencies may yield multiple
benefits in the form of reduced water
demand during times of shortage, and
reduced energy consumption with
attendant cost-savings that result from
reduced energy production.”
Emerging energy-water issues
seemingly have their biggest impact
on electricity generation. But they
also affect oil and gas. Although they
weren’t mentioned at the hearing,
hydraulic fracturing and produced
water are immediate examples.

Transportation fuels

Michael E. Webber, associate director of the Center for International
Energy and Environmental Policy
at the University of Texas at Austin, said, “The move toward more
water-intensive energy is especially
relevant for transportation fuels such
as unconventional fossil fuels (oil
shale, coal-to-liquids, gas-to-liquids,
tar sands), electricity and biofuels. All
can require significantly more water
to produce than gasoline.”
Problems also emerge because

Strike oil,

T

he global financial crisis is hurting eastern Africa’s efforts to find
oil and gas as prospectors cut back on
investment and activities, according to
one energy official from the region.
“The current global financial
meltdown and reduction in oil prices
have adversely affected the exploration finance base of many companies,” said Kenya’s energy minister,
Kiraitu Murungi.
“Many of the companies exploring
for oil and gas in the region have put
on hold, scaled down, or rescheduled
their work,” Murungi told a conference on oil and gas exploration in his
country’s Port of Mombasa.
Murungi said new applications for
exploration licenses in Kenya have
fallen to nearly none from a record
14 licenses issued last year as firms
encouraged by record-breaking crude
prices aggressively pursued oil in
frontier zones such as eastern Africa.

“These new debt arrangements
represent a major milestone in the development of Tullow’s financial capability,” said Tullow Chief Financial Officer
Ian Springett. “To put in place debt
arrangements of this scale, particularly
in the current credit environment, is a
tremendous achievement,” he said.
It is indeed a tremendous achievement, and Springett underlined the
reasons for it, saying, “This demonstrates the quality of Tullow’s assets
as well as the strength of our banking
relationships.”

Ugandan exports coming

More to the point, Springett noted
how the $2 billion loan will positively
affect the company’s plans. “Combined
with our equity placing in January, we
are strongly positioned to pursue our
current investment plans and longerterm growth strategy,” he said.

API, NPRA studying proposal
The American Petroleum Institute
and the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association both said they were
analyzing the 1,400-page draft rule.
“API has spent more than 10 years in
creating the API Compendium for measuring and estimating emissions, so we are
not surprised by the complexity,” API said.
The API Compendium has been
endorsed by the US Department of
Energy, EPA, the International Petroleum
Industry Environmental Conservation
Association, as well as other groups.
“Any final rule should be a unified
system for state and regional governments that is practical for companies to
implement,” API said.
NPRA said it would like to see some
basic principles included in a GHG
reporting rule.
“Those would include reporting at
the facility level, reporting on an annual basis, every effort to develop one
standard for state and federal reporting,
and rejecting the notion of a third-party
verification requirement,” NPRA said.

CERA comments
Cambridge Energy Research Associates issued a statement saying the rule
could prove to be far reaching.
Robert LaCount, director of CERA’s
climate change and clean energy research, said the rule “draws on a long
and complex list of reporting protocols
to establish a federal standard that will
now apply across all of a company’s
facilities regardless of their location.”
LaCount also noted that the rule
shifts reporting from mostly voluntary
programs to a mandatory system “at
breakneck speed.”
The first annual report would be
submitted to EPA in 2011 for the calendar year 2010, except for vehicle and
engine manufacturers, which would
begin reporting for model year 2011.
EPA estimates that the expected cost to
comply with the reporting requirements
to the private sector would be $160
million for the first year. In subsequent
years, the estimated costs for the private
sector would be $127 million/year. ✦

a nominal or degraded
mode.
The developed system has demonstrated that it can detect faults in a
rotating steering system tool and can
provide about 16 hr of warning before
tool failure. Furthermore, in a demonstration, the system detected about 94%
of the faults present in a collection of
runs known to contain steering system
faults.
As the costs of rig downtime continue to increase, it is becoming increasingly important to mitigate or prevent
downhole failures. In its present state,
the described system enables faster
root-cause analysis at maintenance
facilities and in the field. In the near
future, plans include distribution of the
system to workshops and rigs so that
they can make more accurate operations
and maintenance decisions, such as the
prevention of rerunning faulted tools.
These applications provide monetary
savings for both service providers and
rig operators.

Need for system
Modern drilling equipment operates
in increasingly severe environments,
with downhole temperatures exceeding 200° C. and high-impact vibration
events being common. Additionally, rig
operators are asking tools to perform
mission profiles that previously were
impossible, thereby increasing the stress
on the downhole tools. All the while,
customers have started to demand in
contracts a high reliability to help them
prevent costly downhole failures and
ensure profitability.
The current periodic maintenance
practices have proven insufficient or
cost intensive to meet these new challenges.

In this way, one can assess tool health based on
its actual performance, as
compared with its expected
performance for quantized
environmental factors such
as:
• Elevated static loads
such as bending.
• Dynamic loads such as
lateral vibration.
• The combination of
static and dynamic loads.
Operational data collected
from a rotating steering
system tool demonstrates
this approach. The developed
system will allow service
providers to make more agile
maintenance decisions and
provide operators the means
to incorporate reliability into
the well planning and operations processes, enabling
monetary savings for both

Anomaly detection
The goal in fault or
anomaly detection is to
detect subtle changes in
process parameters beyond
those normally expected.
The petroleum industry has
restricted the field of anomaly detection
to the problem of monitoring mud flow
for well control.1-6
These particular applications have the
objective of detecting anomalies in mud
flow to help operators prevent various
problems, such as the occurrences of
kicks, loss of circulation, and degradation of pump efficiency. These problems
could lead potentially to costly rig
downtime.
The historical development of the
previously described kick-detection systems has two features that are of interest
in development of anomaly detection
systems that closely mirror those of
other industries, such as the nuclear7-9
and computing industries.10 11

First, most implement a three-step
process for anomaly detection:
1. Estimate signal values.
2. Calculate the residuals between
the observed and estimates.
3. Pass the residuals to a detector
to determine if the residuals indicate
anomalous behavior.
Second, there is an increasing
gravitation toward empirical models,
as compared with physical models because empirical models often are more
accurate and malleable for real-world
applications.
The work discussed in this article
uses the previously described three-step
anomaly detection process (predict,

As described in the previous section, the anomaly
detection process has three
major steps. The following hypothetical example
provides more details on the
process.
As depicted in Fig. 1,
suppose that we have trained
Fig. 1c
a predictor to estimate p
signals based on their healthy
correlations and we have
trained a detector to recognize the distributions of
the estimate residuals for
healthy observations. For this
example, let us suppose that a
fault in the system has caused
the second signal (denoted
by x2) to deviate from its
healthy behavior.
The first step in the process passes
the p observed signals to the predictor
that produces estimates of the signals
based on their healthy correlations (Fig.
1a). Because training of the predictor
used unfaulted data, the estimates will
lie near to the expected values if no
fault occurred in the system.
Next, we quantify the difference
between the observations and estimates
by calculating the residuals (Fig. 1b).
Since the second signal deviates from
its healthy behavior, we can expect the
second residual (e2) to have a different distribution than that of its healthy
counterparts.
Once we have calculated the residu-

als, we pass them to the detector, where
we use a statistical test to detect slight
deviations (Fig. 1c). The detector compares the observed probability distribution of the estimated residuals (denoted
by gray rectangles) to a nominal (black
dashed line) and degraded modes (red
dashed line), only one of which is presented in Fig. 1c.
In the figure, we can see that the
distributions of the residuals for the
first and pth signal lie close to the nominal mode. In these cases, the detector
would conclude that healthy distributions more likely had generated the
residuals; therefore, the detector would
deem these signals as healthy.
This is not the case for the second
residual. Notice that the observed distribution lies near the degraded mode. In
this case, the detector would deem that
the second signal does not represent
healthy behavior, and it would raise an
alarm.
This work uses the nonparametric fuzzy inference system (NFIS)12
to predict the signal values and the
sequential probability ratio test (SPRT)13
to differentiate between nominal and
degraded modes. A detailed description
of these algorithms is beyond the scope

observed pressure, the NFIS estimates a
lower rpm, which agrees with nominal
system behavior. Notice, however, that
the rpm is not low but slightly higher
than its estimates.
From the alarms, one can see that on
Apr. 25 at 18:00, the rpm begins abnormal behavior. At this point, mud begins
to enter the hydraulic system, resulting
in a more viscous fluid. As a result, the
motor must work harder to build pressure in the unit, which produces the
observed change in correlations that the
anomaly detection system senses.
In this case, one can see that the
unit can build pressure for about 16 hr
before the unit fails.
Now that this example has demonstrated the system performance for an
individual run, it is important to take a
step back and evaluate its performance
during many runs that are representative of different operating conditions
and failure modes.
To do this, the system evaluated
33 runs with validated RSS faults (see
table). The system bases its decision on
the number and extent of the alarms.
The results show that the system
detected faults in 31 of the 33 runs for
a detection sensitivity of about 94%.
These results indicate that the developed
approach is robust enough to detect
reliably and accurately anomalies in the
RSS. ✦

We believe, however, that real and
perceived obstacles will discourage
many refiners from choosing the extraction route. These obstacles include:
• Increased regulatory burden of
storing and handling benzene.
• Economies of scale in the case of
smaller refiners.
• Relative access to chemicals markets.
• A reluctance to enter new markets.
• The additional overhead cost associated with a new business line.

options (Fig. 1).
Because the benzene-rich light
reformate stream is separated from
the benzene-free heavy reformate in
both cases, we chose to exclude the
operating and capital cost of reformate
splitting from our analysis. The loss
of gasoline pool octane was restored
by adding premium motor fuel to the
gasoline pool in each case.
The cost of purchased hydrogen was
charged to the saturation unit case. We
assumed net operating costs of 25¢/
bbl for the saturation case and 50¢/bbl
for the extraction case. The saturation
case’s economics also benefited from an
increased volume of motor fuel from
the volume gain of converting benzene
to cyclohexane.
No depreciation or capital charge
was included in the comparison because our intent was to determine the
financial incentive for any incremental
capital cost associated with the extraction route.
With historic prices, the extraction
and sale of benzene would have maximized the value of the light reformate
stream relative to the saturation route.
Results from our 10-year back cast (Fig.
2) demonstrate this point.
Additional net operating revenue/

as benzene, may well be outside the
expertise and business model of many
gasoline-oriented refiners. Many refiners may therefore be inclined to choose
the saturation approach.
Given the historic margins associated
with recovering benzene, however, it
appears refiners will continue to have
some economic incentive to produce
this chemical. Overcoming the aforementioned hurdles, therefore, becomes
the primary task for those refiners not
already producing benzene.
Larger refineries will have an easier

Change in Russian export duties unlikely to affect margins
Falling crude prices
could upset the symmetry between duties
on crude and products
in Russia, potentially
changing the incentives
Refining
and actions of refiners
there, according to a recent Refinery Evaluation Model Insight
from Wood Mackenzie.
For a long time, Russia used an oil
export duty to provide an incentive for
domestic refiners to run crude, upgrade
facilities, make products, and protect
employment. This strategy
enjoyed much success in the
past, with Russia setting the
duty level accordingly to encourage these behaviors.
Wood Mackenzie’s report,
entitled “How will lower oil
prices affect Russian refiners?”, examines the role of
the export duty regime and
implications of changes
in crude price, duty, and
transportation tariffs on four
sample refineries—two on
the coast, and two inland. The
study considered how investment and
behaviors would change with lower oil
prices and a refining industry suffering
from increasing uncertainty and falling
margins.
Changes in Russia’s duty regime
aim to encourage refiners to modernize existing capacity by increasing the
incentive to produce light products
for export while penalizing exports of
feedstocks and fuel oil. Wood Mackenzie’s calculations, however, show that in
the current low-crude-price environ56

ment, tax change benefits are unlikely
to be sufficient to prevent run cuts from
inland refiners due to the extent that
transportation and fixed operating costs
have affected margins.
This would affect European and
other products markets if supplies from
Russia did decline, prospectively reducing fuel oil and vacuum gas oil feedstocks and, to a lesser but potentially
significant extent, reducing gas oil and
diesel product deliveries.
According to the report, Western
and Central European refiners would

margins.
A lower supply of vacuum gas oil
and straight-run fuel oil could also lead
to increased feedstock costs for highcomplexity refiners in Europe; this,
however, may at least be partially offset
by stronger crack spreads for gas oil
and diesel, a result of reduced imports

from Russia. Overall, this should support simple refining margins in Europe,
likely to be under pressure due to lower
product demand in the Atlantic Basin,
the report said.
Another positive factor for European refiners would be any increased
potential availability of Urals crude.
Many refiners in Central Europe on the
Druzhba pipeline have faced higher
prices recently because the “Druzhba
discount” has decreased.
Some Russian producers could find
themselves in a position to negotiate
higher crude prices. Overall,
however, Wood Mackenzie
is forecasting lower Russian
production in 2010 than
did the firm earlier this year.
The point at which Transneft

any further exports by rail,
with correspondingly lower
netbacks, would potentially
reduce domestic crude prices
further.
Wood Mackenzie argues
that domestic refiners reducing crude runs and logistics restricting
crude exports is unlikely to be sustainable. If crude and products prices
remain low, then it is possible that the
government could be encouraged to
reduce product export duties relative to
crude duties to support crude runs and
utilization, particularly inland.
Location plays a key role. Distance,
and therefore costs, factor in. And any
changes in rates for crude export via
pipeline or rail will affect different
refiners in different ways, reflecting

Overall, the Russian market is now
becoming much more fully exposed to
the effect of sustained lower crude oil
prices on refining profitability, according to the report.

For comparison, Wood Mackenzie
modeled four refineries to calculate
refining margins given different market
situations. Included were a high-complexity refinery and a lower-complexity
refinery close to ports and a highercomplexity and lower-complexity
refinery inland. The high-complexity
refinery located inland is in the Moscow
area, the lower-complexity inland refinery is in the Volga-Urals region.
Wood Mackenzie obtained the yields
from its Refinery Evaluation Model. The
analysis assumed that all of the fuel oil
and most of the gas oil production was
exported, with an adjustment made to
account for local sales of gasoline and
naphtha.
More-complex refineries produce
a greater proportion of higher-value,
lighter products and have a higher GPW
than less-complex refineries. For higher
and lower-complexity coastal refineries,
transportation costs rose, unsurprisingly, in identical fashion, to 8% from 4%
during July to early December 2008,
according to the report. In contrast, for
a complex inland refinery, transportation costs rose to more than 17% from
7%.
Although downstream transport
costs for refiners closest to export markets have doubled, these costs remain
a significantly smaller proportion than
those for inland refineries. Rates for
inland refineries have risen by 2.5-3
times starting from a much higher base,
resulting in a much more severe effect
on profitability.
For refineries even farther inland
than the two examples modeled, the effect is more acute. For a complex refinery in West Siberia, product transportation costs accounted for 11% of GPW in
July and had risen to more than 32% in
early December, according to the report.
This effect increases when crude

and products prices fall. On a net-cash
margin basis, Wood Mackenzie’s modeling shows that both inland refineries
produced negative refining margins at
the beginning of December and would
likely consider cutting utilization.
Both the higher and lower-complexity coastal refiners had positive margins
in early December, according to Wood
Mackenzie’s model, but have seen
margins fall considerably. Conversely, a
complex refinery in Rotterdam would
have generated a higher margin during
the same time, which shows that Russian refineries were at a distinct disadvantage due to the increased proportion
of logistical costs.

Current export duty regime
Fig. 1 shows relative break-even
points for the inland refineries modeled. Wood Mackenzie calculated
product prices using crack spreads
from early December applied to varying
crude prices. Export duty costs were
adjusted according to the crude price
using the current tax formulas for crude
and products.
Given the current product exportduty regime, the more-complex inland
refinery breaks even when the average
CIF Urals price in northwestern Europe
and Mediterranean is about $46/bbl;
the less-complex inland refinery breaks
even at about $67/bbl. This shows that
the lower-complexity inland refinery
operates at a significant loss and is likely
to cut runs and the more-complex
refinery would be under economic
pressure to reduce output.
The break-even points, however, for
coastal refineries are significantly lower,
$40/bbl for the simpler of the two and
$30/bbl for the more complex refiner.
Most Russian refining capacity lies inland and is lower complexity; therefore,
there are likely to be many inland refiners that have, or are considering, cutting
runs in the current market environment.
The average Wood Mackenzie complexity index for refining capacity in
Russia is 4.3, significantly lower than
the European average of 6.5, as calcu-

lated by Wood Mackenzie’s Refinery
Evaluation Model.
These calculations used current oil
products export duty calculations. The
formulas set the export duty for light
products at about 70% of the crude
export duty fee and the export duty
for “dark” products (vacuum gas oil
and fuel oil) at about 40% of the crude
export duty fee.
The difference between the duty
rates on different products historically
supported simple and less-complex
refiners delivering higher yields of dark
products. It is possible that this differential could be removed and the export
duty for all products subsequently
become 54% of the crude export duty
fee, according to the report.

points for each refinery type under the
revised tax regime with all other costs
unchanged.
In this scenario, break-even for
the more-complex inland refinery
is reduced $4/bbl to $42/bbl, with
break-even for the less complex inland
operator only $1/bbl less, at $66/bbl.
Using early December 2008 crude and
products prices, Wood Mackenzie calculated that the refining margin at more
complex refineries would be about $1/
bbl higher under the new regime, with
the less-complex refineries achieving a
margin just $0.20/bbl higher under the
same circumstances. ✦

New export-duty regime
The potential new regime, which
includes a change to dues calculated
monthly, would encourage refiners to
invest in deeper refining of domestic
crude and also to modernize refineries
and produce higher-quality products.
For the simplest refineries producing a
high fuel-oil yield, the change would
result in a higher tax burden, but for
the refineries modeled the changes
would be positive for refining margins.
Higher-complexity refineries would
benefit the most.

Changing a pipeline company’s name following a merger

to properly organize and execute
the name-change process can lead

to unnecessary delays, regulatory
complications, and the additional
costs associated with both. This article
describes one such process, demonstrating the benefits
accrued from using a
systemic approach.

Company name change
requires diligent execution

Background

Several generations of acquisition,
divestiture, and other
company transitions may be included
in a pipeline’s genealogy. Completing
a simple name change of a company’s
assets can quickly evolve into a complicated maze of uncertainties related to
who owns what, who operates what,
and how everything is regulated by
various government agencies.
In the case examined for this article,
Company A, Company B, and Company C merged with parent Company F
several years earlier, placing most of A’s
holdings under Company D and all of
B’s holdings under Company E. Company C retained its name.

Based on presentation to the International Pipeline
Conference, Calgary, Sept. 29-Oct. 3, 2008.

Company A initially operated the
pipeline facilities; then its employees
made the transition to become employees of Company F. This period of transition left behind remnants of the past
companies’ names—including a hybrid
of the two names—in assets, manuals,
permits, registrations, etc.
This project sought to change the
name of the remnant assets of Company
A to a newly formed company, Company G. “Name change” applied to a legal
name change for a specific company’s
assets and to regulated operational activities. Indentifying associated assets of
sister Companies C, D, and E facilitated
the process.
Company F, which was the new
operator of the assets of Companies C,
D, E, and G also had to be identified in
applicable permits, registrations, and
internal documents. Some permits and
plans required correction of the owner
and operator involved due to the
multiple transitions. Fig. 1 shows the
acquisition, change of operators, and
name change. Fig. 2 shows the steps
taken to complete the name-change
project.
Company personnel in the example
outlined by this article included specialists, team leaders, field team leaders,
and operators, all of whom provided
information important to the process’s
success.

Methodology
A spreadsheet called the
stoplight information spreadsheet (SIS) assisted in identifying and tracking acquired
information. This included
a comprehensive list of all
potential applicable regulatory requirements, agencies,
and regulated changes and a
stoplight color code to track
project progress. SIS identified
about 200 potential regulatory
requirements for this company
name-change process involving
as many as six federal and 16
state agencies. SIS also identified 14 company employees,
contractors, and vendors to
manage selected tasks in the
name-change process.
Three categories of contacts
provided data over the course
of the name-change project:
• Company personnel.
• Regulatory agencies.
• Company contractors.
A list provided by the client
initially identified key company personnel. A list of permit
information provided by the client
initially identified applicable regulatory
agencies, permits, and plans. Interviews
with company personnel identified
company contractors. Communicating
with contractors helped determine what
tasks they performed and how they
could best be informed of any name
change procedures related to their tasks.
Each of these lists expanded as additional information was gathered.
Table 1 provides an abridged sample
of the SIS spreadsheet.

In January, Golar LNG delivered the Golar Spirit to Petrobras for
its first offshore LNG terminal off Pecem. (Photograph from Golar

Petrobras gains ﬂoating regas vessel for ﬁrst LNG terminal
Warren R.True
Chief Technology Editor—
LNG/Gas Processing
Petrobras In January took delivery of the
LNG
world’s first floating storage and regasification vessel, the Golar
Spirit, following commissioning tests
on the vessel’s regasification trains. The
contract was completed by Golar LNG
Ltd. following award in April 2007.
Called an “FSRU,” the vessel is going
into service at Petrobras’s LNG terminal, at Pecem, Ceará state. Each of its
three regas units can send out up to
130 MMcfd, with two units normally
working while the third remains on
standby, according to Blake Blackwell,
vice-president of business development
for Golar LNG.

64

Conversion
The 127,000-cu m Golar Spirit was
converted from a traditional LNG carrier in about 6 months at the Keppel
Shipyard, Singapore. Kawasaki Heavy
Industries Ltd. originally built the vessel
at its Sakaide, Japan, yard. Commissioned in 1981, it was the first LNG
carrier built in Japan.
Its conversion in 2007 involved
addition of the three vaporizers,
designed by Moss Maritime; three
booster pumps, five in-line pumps,
and more turbo generation capacity, all
manufactured by Shinko Industries Ltd.,
Hiroshima; and automation, manufactured by Kongsberg. The 289-m vessel
contains five Moss Rosenberg spherical
aluminum storage tanks.
“FSRUs are site and project specific,” Blackwell told OGJ. In this case,
Petrobras has elected to place the LNG

unloading arms and high-pressure gas
arms (yellow in the photograph’s foreground) on the pier.
An LNG carrier berths on the side
away from the FSRU (lower part of
photograph) and unloads its cargo with
the unloading arms onto the FSRU,
which then regasifies the LNG and
moves the natural gas ashore via the HP
gas arms, said Blackwell. By locating
the HP arms and LNG loading arms on
the pier, Petrobras can move an FSRU
among demand centers.
Later this year, Petrobras will use the
Golar Spirit to commission a second
offshore LNG terminal, in Guanabara
Bay, Rio de Janeiro. In the meantime,
Blackwell said a second LNG carrier, the
Golar Winter, is undergoing conversion
at the Keppel yard. ✦

Strange thinking
steers assault on
oil, gas, economy
Just when it seems utterances from
Washington, DC, can’t get any loonier,
someone in the Obama administration says
what he thinks.
The ﬁrst budget proposal by President
Barack Obama is a frontal assault on the US
oil and gas industry (OGJ Online, Feb. 26,
2009).
It calls for new taxes on oil and gas companies and on production from the Gulf of

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Mexico and for repeal of tax preferences
crucial to independent producers, such as
percentage depletion and expensing of
intangible drilling costs.
In fact, the budget items speciﬁcally
addressing oil and gas revive disastrous
ideas proposed but rejected in a vengeful Congress when gasoline prices were
extraordinarily high.
If enacted, they will curtail drilling and
chase some companies out of the country
while subsidizing renewable energy forms.
The budget also proposes to raise
hundreds of billions of dollars from a capand-trade system for cutting emissions of
greenhouse gases. That move amounts
to a tax extracted through sharply higher
energy costs.
A logical response to these missiles
aimed at the oil and gas industry and US
economy has been to ask: What are these
people thinking?
Now we know.
“We don’t believe it makes sense to
signiﬁcantly subsidize the production and
use of sources of energy (like oil and gas)
that are dramatically going to add to our
climate change (problem),” said Interior
Sec. Timothy Geithner in testimony to the
Senate Finance Committed, according to
Reuters. “We don’t think that’s good economic policy, and we think changing those
incentives is good for the country.”
In fact, tax preferences for oil and gas,
not all of which represent subsidies, aren’t
as large as Geithner implies. They’re not
nearly as large on a per-btu basis as subsidies in effect for the high-cost, low-volume
fuels this administration prefers.
If the incentive changes occur, especially in conjunction with an aggressive
cap-and-trade scheme, the US will produce
less cheap energy than it does now and not
nearly enough politically favored, costly energy to compensate. Oil imports will surge.
Energy costs will leap.
That the treasury secretary sees those
outcomes as improvements to economic
policy is frightening.

Cycle sinking ‘deeper, longer’
This down-cycle for oil and gas will be “deeper and longer than most expect,
with oil consumption falling for 3 years—the longest period since the early 1980s,”
warned analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc. (FBR) in Arlington, Va.
In a separate report, Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank,
Washington, DC, said, “We believe the potential for global oil demand to be even
lower than the most bearish of current forecasts. We expect this will prompt the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries into further [production cuts] at some
point in 2009. However, we are reassured by the ongoing ﬂattening in the crude oil
curve, which we expect will help lift oil prices into the second quarter.”
FBR analysts said, “The steep drop in oil prices and limited access to capital will
further reduce exploration and production [spending]. Deﬂation will take years,
not quarters, to set in; thus, we expect a U-shaped cycle, not a V-shaped recovery
as some expect.” They expect the worst spending downturn since the early 1980s,
but not as severe. Consumption declines should be similar to the 1980s’ declines in
duration, but not as deep. In 1979-84, oil and gas consumption decreased 6.5%, with
capital spending falling 59% from 1981 to 1987. FBR is expecting consumption to
decrease 2.7% from 2008 to through 2011 and foresees a 33% drop in capital expenditures over the same period.
Natural gas blues
In Houston, analysts at Raymond James & Associates Inc. reiterated, “Gas is going to be ugly, and NGL production levels aren’t winning any pageants either. Due
to declining reﬁnery utilization and weak industrial-consumer demand for NGL feedstocks, NGL margins have remained depressed, and average NGL production levels
are down 600 MMcfd on a year-over-year basis since the beginning of withdrawal
season.”
Raymond James analysts expect improved processing margins during the second
half of this year could increase production, “thereby narrowing the year-over-year
gas supply level from current levels of 600 MMcfd to 300 MMcfd looser.”
FBR analysts said, “The US natural gas market can produce more with fewer resources due to the new methods of horizontal drilling, multistage completions, and
shale formations.” As a result, they expect a downward shift in long-term spending
necessary to maintain production. “Non-shale capex will be lower for longer,” they
said. “Furthermore, operators with international or domestic deepwater oil opportunities should further shift their investments toward those projects. We expect US
operators to spend only 80% of their cash ﬂow in 2009, 67% in 2010, and 80-85%
long term, as projects are not economical at a long-term gas price of $4.50/Mcf.”
FBR analysts noted, “Improved technology and methodology are making a large
quantity of low-cost shale gas economical. Lower demand and excess capacity are
also lowering service costs. This should lower the weighted-average marginal cost
of production 20% in 2009 to below $3. Even with more than a 60% reduction in gas
capex, the natural gas market will not be balanced in our opinion. There could need
to be another 25-30% drop in gas capex in 2010 to balance the market. The 2008
capex level is unlikely to be seen for many years.”
Too many rigs
According to FBR analysts, “There has been a structural shift in natural gas production, and the casual relationship of ‘three times as many rigs needed to maintain
production’ should be dispelled. The dramatic increase in lower-cost shale gas and
more productive completion methods should reduce the long-term call on conventional drilling rigs.”
FBR said 1,000 US land rigs need to be retired. “We expect the natural gas rig
count to average 882 rigs in 2009 and 782 in 2010 as capex is cut to balance the natural gas market. In 2011, we expect the US land rig count to average 1,220. With more
than 2,500 rigs marketed at the peak of the 2008 cycle, including 750 new builds
and not including 100 under construction new builds, we believe 1,000 rigs need be
stacked for land rig margins to rise above cash costs. Utilization for 2009 and 2010
should be around 40% and 74% long term after 1,000 rigs are stacked,” they said.
“Over the last several months, the market has declined at an increasingly rapid
pace for both jack ups and deepwater [rigs]. Tender activity has dried up considerably,” said FBR analysts. “We expect deepwater day rates to fall on average by 42%
from peak rates while we expect jack up day rates to fall on average by 53% from
peak rates.”

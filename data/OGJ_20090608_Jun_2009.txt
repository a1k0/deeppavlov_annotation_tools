Baker Hughes

Advancing Reservoir Performance

Deepwater:
Horizontal Openhole
Gravel-Pack Completions
First Successful Horizontal Openhole Gravel Pack
in Deepwater Stybarrow Field
The Stybarrow Field consists of slope turbidite sandstones of the
Macedon Formation in the Exmouth Sub-Basin offshore Western
Australia. It is one of two fields in Australia’s deepest water
development, in more than 800 m of water, and was developed
entirely by subsea wells connected to an FPSO.
Lateral Reservoir Quality, Sand/Shale Heterogeneities
Lateral reservoir quality variations, difficult sand/shale
heterogeneities, and limited in-country technical experience and
infrastructure were only some of the obstacles to completing four,
near-horizontal production wells in this field. Others included gravel
packing across much longer non-reservoir sections, gravel packing
out of a milled casing window, narrow pressure margin between
circulating pressures and formation fracture pressure, large
wellbore washouts, and gravel packing at wellbore inclinations
of up to 94°.
Gravel-Pack Design With Ceramic Proppant
To solve these problems, Baker Hughes helped develop an
optimized reservoir drilling fluid and gravel carrier fluid design. We
also created a gravel pack pumping design that used a 16/20 US
Mesh ceramic proppant. This combined with our EXCLUDER2000™
medium-weave premium screen to produce the optimal sandface
completion. Baker Hughes engineers sized the screens to retain
formation sand. This would ensure sand retention in case of
incomplete gravel packs. Slurry and conformance tests with
various screen types and a range of sand facies, along with various
proppant sizes and types, concluded that inclusion of proppant
drastically reduced pressure buildup across the screens as well
as the mass of sand particles produced through the screens. The

EXCLUDER2000™ screens like those used in the Stybarrow wells have compiled an
outstanding performance record in the world’s most extreme conditions.

Baker Oil Tools gravel-pack design also contained contingencies
specific to this design in case of poor installation outcomes. Another
success factor in the project was continuity of key Baker Hughes
personnel and essential equipment from concept through execution.
Near-Record Australian Production Rates
Gravel-pack efficiency factors between 108% and 118% were
achieved despite several unforeseen geological and technical
challenges. All four Stybarrow production wells achieved
maximum sand-free rates per FPSO design capacity. Maximum
production rates from all four wells have exceeded 80,000 BOPD,
with one well producing at near-record Australian rates of 32,000
BOPD seven months after first oil.

IEA: Global upstream budgets already down 21%
Global upstream oil and gas budgets for 2009 have already been
cut 21% compared with 2008, according to a report by Paris-based
International Energy Agency.
This is almost $100 billion, said IEA in a report on the impact of
the financial crisis on energy investments worldwide, prepared for
the G8 Energy Ministers Meeting in Rome May 24-25.
The investment drop will continue into 2009, especially in the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development region,
and will impact both supply and demand, IEA reported.
From October through April, more than 20 planned large upstream oil and gas projects were either postponed indefinitely or
scrapped. The projects were valued at more than $170 billion and
involved 2 million b/d of oil capacity and 1 bcfd of gas capacity. A
further 35 projects amounting to 4.2 million b/d oil capacity and
2.3 bcfd gas capacity were delayed by at least 18 months.
Oil projects in Canada account for the bulk of the postponed oil
capacity. Investments in non-OPEC countries are expected to drop
the most as upstream spending has fallen mainly in high-development-cost regions and in areas where small players and projects
dominate investments. Supermajors, on the other hand, plan to cut
spending by only 5%.
The report said spending cuts on existing fields could accelerate
decline rates. It said exploration spending will be reduced sharply
in 2009 as investments are diverted to complete development projects launched before prices slumped.

Iraq wants ‘coordination’ with Kurdish oil deals
The Iraqi oil ministry, while acknowledging the right of semiautonomous Kurdistan to sign agreements with international oil
companies, said it is concerned about the lack of coordination regarding them.
“The Iraqi oil ministry’s objection is to the signing of these
contracts without any coordination with it or with the federal government,” said Asim Jihad, a ministry spokesman.
“We do not know how many contracts exist, their details, or
how much of Iraq’s oil is being given to the foreign companies,
not to mention privileges,” Asim told Dubai’s Al-Arabiya television,
adding that the Iraqi federal government and the oil ministry have
“the right to learn of these details.”
Asim said the Iraqi constitution stipulates that the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) coordinate with the federal government
on all oil-related matters but that “unfortunately, this has not been
the case.”
Asim acknowledged that Article 112 of the Iraqi constitution
does grant the KRG the right to sign oil contracts, but he said the
document also stipulates that such matters should be coordinated
with the oil ministry of the federal government.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

This month, Kurdistan began exporting crude oil for the first
time, sending 100,000 bbl from the Taq Taq and Tawke oil fields
via the Iraq-Turkey pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan (OGJ
Online, June 1, 2009).

GWPC: US state regulations protect water
Current US state oil and gas regulations adequately protect water resources, the Ground Water Protection Council said in a new
report on May 28.
The assertion by one of the nation’s leading groundwater protection organizations came as congressional discussions intensified
on giving the US Environmental Protection Agency authority to
regulate hydraulic fracturing, an essential part of producing natural
gas from shale formations.
The study focused on eight regulatory aspects: permitting, well
construction, hydraulic fracturing, temporary abandonment, well
plugging, tanks, pits, and waste handling and spills. The resulting
report was not intended as an evaluation of state programs, but
rather, an evaluation of state programs, the GWPC said.
Each state covered in the study was invited to review the report’s
findings and provide any updated information, it added. Thirteen
states provided responses, which were incorporated in the report,
the council said.
GWPC also produced a regulations reference document containing excerpts from each state’s oil and gas regulations related to
the programmatic areas evaluated in the study, it said.
Oil from Canada’s oil sands is also blended, without segregation, with other feedstocks at many US refineries, making it impossible to determine the content of fuels that are purchased, it added.
The report and addendums are available online at www.gwpc.org.
Oil and gas organizations responded favorably. “The study confirms what the industry has been saying: Regulation of oil and
gas field activities, including hydraulic fracturing, is best accomplished at the state level where regional and local conditions are
best understood, and where state regulators are on hand to conduct
inspections and oversee specific applications like well construction and testing and plugging as well as hydraulic fracturing,” the
American Petroleum Institute said in a statement.
“Hydraulic fracturing is a tried-and-true, more than 50-yearold technology, increasingly essential for producing the nation’s
natural gas,” API added.

Libya, Cyprus to sign energy agreements
Libya plans to sign agreements with Cyprus concerning the
supply of oil and natural gas, according to a senior Libyan official.
“We look forward to signing agreements with Cyprus in the
fields of oil and natural gas,” said Libya’s Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Jalil.

“There are many areas of cooperation that are vital for both

will start drilling activities at their Service Contract 60 (SC 60) in
Northeast Palawan.
The partners have commissioned the services of the Frontier
Phoenix drillship for oil and gas exploration in SC 60, according to
filing by SCR with the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE).
David Baladad, SCR vice-president of operations, told PSE that
the drillship will proceed to Northeast Palawan later this year upon
completion of its five-well program in Malaysia.
SC 60 is one of the country’s most promising areas in terms of
potential for large accumulations for petroleum, according to SCR,
which said that a rigorous study of the 3D seismic data was conducted and highlighted a number of leads, several of which have
been elevated to “prospect status.”
“The objective is to continue and further the exploration of the
block with a commitment to drill one well during the subphase,”
SCR said, adding that the second subphase is valid until Feb. 10,
2010.
The consortium partners signed their agreement for SC 60 in
2005. Under terms of their 7-year agreement, the consortium
committed a minimum of $24 million (1.27 billion pesos) for
the project.
According to the agreement, the consortium is to conduct seismic and exploration work to find petroleum and optional exploration drilling within the first 7 years. SC 60 also includes a 25-year
production term in the event of a commercial discovery of petroleum.
Shell-led group to start drilling in the Philippines

Several companies increased ownership in North Dakota Bakken
well and production interests under an existing joint venture with
Slawson Exploration Co., a private Denver operator.
Northern Oil & Gas Inc., Wayzata, Minn., acquired certain North
Dakota Bakken assets from Windsor Bakken LLC as part of a syndicate led by Slawson. Northern purchased a 5% interest in the undeveloped acreage, including 60,000 net acres. Price is $7.3 million.
Northern also acquired 14% of the existing 59 gross Bakken
and Three Forks well bores in North Dakota including 1,200 b/d
of oil production. It also purchased 300,000 bbl of proved producing reserves and 3,000 net undeveloped acres.
GeoResources Inc., Houston, acquired a 15% interest in 60,000
net acres and 15% of varying working interests in 59 producing
and productive wells, adding more than 300,000 boe of proved
producing reserves. Cost was $10.4 million.
Lario Oil & Gas Co., private Denver operator, also participated
in the revised joint venture on undisclosed terms, GeoResources
said.
Slawson, responsible for all operations, is expected to drill as
many as 45 gross Bakken wells on the newly acquired acreage
through 2010.
The joint venture, running one rig, expects to add two more
in July and possibly a fourth by the first quarter of 2010, GeoResources said.

San Leon to test oil shale technology in Morocco
San Leon Energy PLC has been given 3 years to test its In Situ
Vapor Extraction (IVE) oil shale technology on the Tarfaya oil shale
exploration project in Morocco with first tests scheduled for midto-late-2010.
The company signed a memorandum of understanding
with Morocco’s National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mining
(ONHYM) for the project and site testing will begin later this
year. The location will be 200 m above the high oil-yielding
zone within the Tarfaya oil shale.
San Leon signed an exclusive agreement with Mountain West
Energy LLC to use IVE to extract oil from the acreage that encompasses 6,000 sq km. This method is easier on the environment than
open pit mining.
ONHYM approved the feasibility study and work program. San
Leon produced 62 l./tonne of oil under lab conditions. “This is

similar to the yield reported by Shell when they were testing in the
Tarfaya area from 1981 until 1986,” the company said.
Shell drilled 55 shallow boreholes, all of which were petrophysically logged, in 1982, encountering the Cretaceous and organic
rich Tarfaya oil shale within the San Leon area. Shell established an
open pit mine and heated the oil shale in a retort to produce oil.
They left the area in 1986 after oil prices plunged to $10/bbl.
San Leon Energy estimates it could produce 500,000 b/d from
oil shale reserves in the area. Petrobras is looking at similar developments in the Timhadit oil shale MOU, which is in northern
Morocco.
Oil shale reserves in Morocco include an estimated 53 billion
bbl in place.

EPA cites BP for alleged violations at reﬁnery
The US Environmental Protection Agency has cited BP Products
North America Inc. on June 2 for allegedly violating federal air
pollution regulations at its Whiting, Ind., refinery over a 5-year
period.
EPA’s Region 5 office in Chicago alleged that the refiner failed
to manage and treat benzene waste from the plant during 2003-08
as required by the Clean Air Act’s national emission standards for
hazardous air pollutants.
It said that the facility’s 2008 report showed that benzene waste
was almost 16 times the allowed amount.
The refinery, which was initially established in 1889, is now
the third-largest in the US and the biggest outside the Gulf Coast,
with more than 400,000 b/d of throughput capacity, according to
information on BP America Inc.’s web site.
EPA emphasized that these are preliminary findings of violations. It said, to resolve them it may issue a compliance order, assess an administrative penalty, or sue the company in federal court.
BP has 30 days from receiving the notice to meet with the agency
to discuss and resolve the allegations, the federal environmental
regulator said.

Brazil committed to biofuels despite presalt ﬁnds

Brazil remains committed to developing biofuels despite last
year’s discovery of giant oil reserves in the presalt area of the Santos
basin, according to a government official.
Dilma Rousseff, presidential chief-of-staff, while speaking to
sugar and ethanol producers at the Ethanol Summit, said Brazil will
continue being the leader in ethanol production and technology
development.
Rousseff denied that sugarcane crops would take land from
food’s rural farmers. “Sugarcane occupies only 0.5% of Brazil’s arable land,” Rousseff said, adding that technology has allowed Brazilian rural farmers to harvest more sugarcane in the same area.
Rousseff also said the Brazilian government could use ethanol
as a substitute for diesel oil to generate electricity in isolated communities in the Amazon region. “In order to prevent diesel oil from
being burned in the Amazon we want to burn ethanol,” she said.
“We estimate that, via the Eletrobras system, we can adopt it

Holly Energy Partners LP, 41% owned by Holly Corp., has acquired the 16-in. pipeline, which connects distillation and vacuum
units in Lovington, NM, with the main Navajo Refining Co. LP
facility in Artesia. The purchase price was $34.2 million.
Holly Corp. is expanding crude capacity of the refinery to

upgrading capacity, including a 15,000-b/d hydrocracker (OGJ,

Apr. 28, 2008, p. 30).
The upgraded and expanded refinery will be able to run as
much as 40,000 b/d of heavy crude.
The project includes a new 70-mile pipeline connecting Lovington with one of two 16-in. Centurion Pipeline LP lines between Cushing, Okla., and Slaughter, Tex., reversed to carry heavy
crude.
Another part of the project is a new 37-mile pipeline linking

SemGroup crude pipeline begins operations
SemGroup LP announced its 12-in. OD, 525-mile White Cliffs
crude pipeline began commercial operations. The pipeline extends
from Platteville, Colo., to SemGroup’s storage at Cushing, Okla.,
from which it could be shipped to major US refining centers.
White Cliff’s current capacity is about 30,000 b/d, expandable
to more than 50,000 b/d. It includes a 100,000 bbl tank at Platteville to aggregate DJ basin-Wattenberg field production.
Production efforts at Wattenberg increased during 2008, with
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. running 1,102 frac jobs in the gas and
oil field, 60% more than in 2007 and a record for the field (OGJ
Online, Feb. 6, 2009).
SemGroup owns 99.17% of White Cliffs Pipeline. Other partners are Anadarko Wattenberg Co. LLC 0.415% and Samedan Pipeline Corp. 0.415%
On May 15 SemGroup filed its plan of reorganization under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The plan called for the distribution of about $2.27 billion in value to creditors, which would
become owners of the reorganized company. SemGroup filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy July 22, 2008, and expects to exit bankruptcy in the third quarter.

France discusses TransMed pipeline extension
France expressed interest in receiving gas from the Galsi pipeline, which will import 8 billion cu m/year of Algerian gas to
Italy.
Chakib Khelil, Algeria’s energy minister, said France wants to
add a branch to the proposed 850-km line, which will link Algeria to Sardinia to Tuscany. He told reporters construction of the
pipeline would begin next year. “All of the studies concerning the
pipeline have been completed, and the two partners in the project,
Algeria and Italy, have decided to begin investment in 2010,” he
said.
Khelil met with Italian Economic Development Minister Claudio Scajola over the weekend. With Europe keen to lessen its dependence on Russian imports, Scajola described Transmed as a
“strategic project for the energy security of Europe.”
Galsi is an 840-km pipeline and in 2,800 m of water will be
one of the deepest offshore pipeline ever laid. It will deliver Algerian gas into Italy starting in 2013, a year later than originally scheduled due to technical difficulties (OGJ Online, Dec. 15, 2008). The
final investment decision will be made June 30, 2010.
“We will try to accelerate things on the Galsi project,” Khelil

said. Sonatrach is leading the project along with Snam Rete Gas
SPA, Edison SPA, Enel SPA, and the Hera Group.
The ministers agreed to increase capacity of the TransMed pipeline by 7 billion cu m by the end of this year. Its current capacity is
27 billion cu m/year of gas. It delivers gas from Algeria via Tunisia
to Sicily.
Once the Galsi and upgrades to the TransMed pipeline are completed, Algeria’s export capacity to Italy will rise to nearly 40 billion cu m/year. But some industry experts have expressed concerns
whether Algeria can boost production to fill these pipelines as Algeria’s recent gas finds have been relatively small, and there was
little interest from foreign energy majors to develop Algeria’s fields
under the last licensing round.
Algerian officials attributed the lack of interest in its energy sector to the global economic slowdown.

Kogas, Kitimat LNG sign gas supply agreement
Kitimat LNG Inc. has signed a memorandum of understanding
to supply Korea Gas Corp. (Kogas) with as much as 40% of Kitimat
LNG’s production along with an option to acquire an equity stake
in Kitimat LNG’s export terminal.
Kitimat LNG said Kogas plans to purchase 2 million tonnes/
year of LNG from the proposed terminal over 20 years at a total
purchase value of more than $20 billion.
Kitimat LNG also said it is progressing with discussions with
other potential terminal users and investors for terminal capacity,
offtake from the terminal, and equity in the 5-million tpy project,
which lies in Kitimat, BC.
Kitimat LNG and Mitsubishi Corp. earlier this year signed a
heads of agreement under which the Japanese firm also will acquire terminal capacity and an equity stake in Kitimat LNG’s proposed LNG export terminal.
Under terms of that agreement, Mitsubishi will buy 1.5 million
tpy of terminal capacity and acquire a minority equity interest in
Kitimat LNG’s project.
Since then, the government of British Columbia has announced
plans to help facilitate the participation of a number of First Nations
in the Kitimat to Summit Lake Pipeline Looping (KSL) project.
The $1.2 billion (Can.), 1 bcfd KSL system, which was approved by Canada’s federal agencies in March, would extend 290
miles from Summit Lake to the Kitimat LNG export project.
Under the agreement with the British Columbian government,
First Nations will secure a direct interest in Pacific Trail Pipelines LP,
developer of the KSL system.✦

SECOND OF TWO PARTS

The climate bill’s costs
In case anyone missed the National Petrochemical &
Refiners Association estimate for costs awaiting US refiners from climate-change legislation approved last month
by a key House committee, here it is: $58 billion/year.
That’s “billion” with a “b.” And it’s not $58 billion over
a decade or two. It’s $58 billion every year. And it would
grow.
HR 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act,
would hit refining harder than most other US industries.
Refiners would face the earliest possible compliance
mandate and receive disproportionately low emissions
allowances under the bill’s cap-and-trade scheme. And
they’d have to meet limits on emissions not only from
their operations but from use of their products as well.

• Raise residential natural gas prices by 55%.
• Raise the average family’s energy bill by $1,500/
year.
• Increase the inflation-adjusted federal debt by 26%.
And these costs are for only the cap-and-trade provisions. Clean-energy mandates of the Waxman-Markey bill
would intensify the pain. “Though the proposed legislation would have little impact on world temperatures,”
the study says, “it is a massive energy tax in disguise that
promises job losses, income cuts, and a sharp left turn
toward big government.”
For such warnings, supporters of the bill have no
patience. To them, conservative utterances lack credibility.

T E R E S T
Oil is the world’s most important
commodity, and the need to understand the long-term supply is widely
recognized. In some way, all energy
projects—whether they involve conventional or green alternatives—will be
measured against oil. Some of the most
pressing questions facing the future of
oil supply are:
• What is the future global delivery
capacity?
• When and at what
volume will oil fail to
meet the need?
• How can the
future price of oil be
predicted, and how
reliable is the price
prediction?
• How can the oil price be maintained at levels sufficient to assure
adequate investment to maximize
exploitation of oil resources concurrent
with timely and adequate investment in
alternative energy sources?
A second tier of questions is tied to
the best use of oil when supply cannot
meet demand. The proposal made in
this article will be essential to addressing those questions as well.
Answers to any of these questions are
predicated upon a reliable and credible
forecast of global delivery capacity. The
need for answers becomes more urgent
as excess productive capacity shrinks
and oil remains the primary and cheap-

est source of energy (Fig. 1).1 Primary
contributing factors to the present
inadequacy of energy investment are
price volatility and uncertainty of future
delivery capacities, which are the byproducts of tightening supply.
The authors confirm the work of
others that the energy future depends
upon a handful of irreplaceable and
aging fields, many of which are in unknown states of depletion. It is time for
the world to better understand global
oil productive capacity in order to take
appropriate measures.

Modeling giants
The authors propose that the key to
this understanding is the modeling of
the largest fields. Should government
and industry fail to understand the future supply from these fields, there is a
potential for large shortfalls of productive capacity without adequate alternative replacements having been put in
place. As the world has experienced on
several occasions, even small shortfalls
can cause large price increases. Failure to understand when and at what
volume oil supply will be insufficient is
not acceptable.
The key observation behind this proposal is that over time the proportionate
contribution of large fields to world oil
supply has been generally consistent.

largest fields in the world (321 of the
top fields) provides the basis to answer
the questions posed at the opening of
this article. The scale of the proposed
undertaking is easily managed. This
model would provide a high degree of
reliability for 50% of the world’s production—the portion that is assumed
irreplaceable and the primary driver
for future deliverability. As these largest
fields diminish in productivity there is
little prospect that the loss of their capacity will be offset by new discoveries.
The historic trend is that new discoveries do little more than keep pace with
depletion of nongiant fields.
Today there is an overreliance upon
historical methods to predict future
production. The focus on understanding
the whole of the reserves and production picture from an historical perspective, such as the Hubbert model, may
be misplaced. Hook et al.2 and Robelius,3 as well as Nehring4 and Klemme,5
have shown that the world’s giant and
supergiant fields, deliver over 50% of
the world’s supply.
In Fig. 3, the largest 19 fields (the
lowest curve) and the 321 largest fields
(the middle curve) are nearly parallel in
the last 20 years to the top curve, which
is world total production. Compared
to the period between 1940 and 1980,
when 70% of the reserves of the largest
fields were discovered (Fig. 4), the 3
subsequent decades have contributed
only 12%, even with the advantage of
greatly advanced technology and access
to a large portion of the world’s prospective areas.

The contribution of the smaller fields
and future additions will not have the
capacity to mitigate the significant disruption of the global economy brought
on at some point by the decline of the
largest fields. Therefore, a widely accepted method of forecasting supply is
required.
In response, this article proposes
building reservoir models of the world’s
largest fields to gain insight to their
possible supply rates. These rates would
not be unique answers but would
model different scenarios of reservoir
development from high investment
to low or no investment while giving
full consideration to the limitations of
remaining oil in place within each field.
Further, all producers might join in this
effort because it is in everyone’s interest
to do so. The reliability of the forecast
will improve along with increasing
cooperation from producers. While the
use of a black-oil model of the largest fields does not provide an absolute
prediction (one does not exist), it does

Nonetheless, the role of the supergiants and giants is so compelling that
it is now time to start this project.

Prior efforts
Numerous efforts by highly qualified, skilled, and adequately funded
persons and groups have produced supply forecasts, but they still have a lot of
uncertainty and some controversy. The
uncertainty is exacerbated by a lack of
transparency in the reporting of much
of the world’s reserves, inconsistent
reporting standards, and the lack of independent, third-party verification. Beyond the lack of transparency, the core
reasons for this situation are the lack of
a single repository for the primary data
on fields and reliance upon historic data
with their inherent limitations.
While some countries require the
release of such data, others treat it as
a state secret. Consequently, there has
been no cooperation within industry
to create such a repository. Even when
reserve data are available, they are often
fraught with uncertainties of reporting
(they can be 1P, 2P, 3P, or simply not
defined).
Beginning with reserves reports first
due in the spring of 2010, the US Securities and Exchange Commission will
accept reserves estimates beyond 1P, or
proved reserves. Even then, reporting
of less certain reserves categories will
remain optional. Such a lack of international standards clearly leads to difficulties of analysis.

API opposes efforts
to federally regulate
hydraulic fracturing
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Proposed federal regulation of
hydraulic fracturing under the Safe
Drinking Water Act could add $150,000
to deep-well costs and reduce drilling,
American Petroleum Institute officials
warned on June 3.
Requiring producers using hydraulic
fracturing to comply with the SDWA’s
underground injection control provisions would add another regulatory
layer that many states’ water laws already cover, API members told reporters
in a teleconference.
“An estimated 60-80% of onshore
wells drilled in the Lower 48 states
involve hydraulic fracturing,” said
Richard L. Ranger, a senior policy
advisor at API. “It has played a significant part in the Bakken shale oil play.
Virtually all the wells extracting gas
from shales in the Midcontinent and
tight sands in the Intermountain West
use it,” he said.
Ranger said the estimated $150,000
of additional regulatory compliance costs under legislation that Rep.
Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) is apparently planning to introduce would
include $100,000 for UIC regulations,
$25,000 for stormwater permits, and
$15,000 for waste permits under the
federal Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act.
DeGette introduced a bill, HR 7231,
on Sept. 29, 2008, to repeal hydraulic fracturing’s exemption under the
SDWA. She has not reintroduced it this
year, but plans to so soon, a spokesman told OGJ on June 3. The House
Natural Resources Committee’s Energy
and Mineral Resources Subcommittee
will also probably examine hydraulic
fracturing as part of its June 4 hearing
on shale gas potential.

Work ahead
“We’re opposed to Rep. DeGette’s bill
that’s being discussed now. We have a
lot of work ahead of us to explain why.
We see this as an education effort and
part of what we do at API,” said Ranger,
who was joined in the teleconference
by two other API senior policy advisors,
Andy Radford and Stephanie Meadows.
States are better qualified to regulate
oil and gas drilling because their agencies are better acquainted with each
drilling site’s unique characteristics,
they explained. “Technical professionals
at state agencies who have experience
in each area’s unique characteristics are
the best qualified,” said Ranger. Alaska’s
comprehensive regulations cover steps
from the drilling engineer’s blue-line
drawings to well site operations, while
Colorado recently changed its rules to
provide more consultation among agencies but retained their strong technical
history, he said.
UIC provisions under the SDWA
aren’t appropriate for hydraulic fracturing, Meadows said. “Producers aren’t
actually storing anything in the well,
which UIC provisions cover. The water
is being temporarily used and brought
back to the surface with the oil or gas
that’s produced,” she said.

T E R E S T
State regulations also go beyond
water, Ranger continued. “There really
isn’t any such thing as a ‘clean, vanilla
drilling operation,’ nor would that necessarily be desirable. A drilling operation deals with unique conditions at
each site under state regulations which
try to assure that operations there are
conducted with the utmost safety,” he
said.
“These commissions don’t exist in a
silo, but meet frequently depending on
the amount of drilling that takes place
in the state. In Texas, for instance, they
meet twice yearly whereas in Ohio,
where there’s much less activity, they
meet less frequently,” Ranger said.

Questions raised
Other US House members share
DeGette’s view. During a May 19 House
appropriations subcommittee hearing
on the US Environmental Protection
Agency’s fiscal 2010 budget request,
Rep. Maurice D. Hinchey (D-NY) asked
EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson if she
would have the agency review risks
to drinking water posed by hydraulic fracturing. Jackson responded that
EPA should review the matter in light
of cases across the country that raised
questions about the drilling technique’s

safety, Hinchey said following the hearing.
“It’s imperative that we protect our
drinking water supplies from harmful chemicals that are being pumped
into the ground by oil and gas companies looking to produce on more
and more land in New York and across
the country,” Hinchey said. He added,
“We are in a much stronger position
to protect our drinking water now that
we have an administration in place that
is committed to environmental protection. While there is value in drilling for
natural gas, it’s imperative that we do so
in a manner that doesn’t have long-term
environmental consequences on our
drinking water, a resource that is critical
to human health and survival.”
Ranger conceded during the teleconference that some landowners have
complained that hydraulic fracturing
nearby has damaged their property, but
added: “We believe that the incidents
that have been brought forward associated with contamination of soil and
water have been associated with handling fluids on the surface and not with
hydraulic fracturing underground. That
does not excuse them, but they should
not be used to condemn hydraulic
fracturing.” ✦

Onshore, the draft proposes creating federal-state-stakeholder teams to develop comprehensive energy plans for
each public lands state. The plans would be used to guide
federal land management and leasing decisions. The bill also
would create federal leasing programs for wind, solar, and
uranium on public acreage to create a basic framework for
the various kinds of energy development.
The draft proposal also would create an oceans trust fund,
which would dedicate a portion of OCS revenues to grants
for coastal states and regional collaborations to protect,
maintain, and restore ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems.
Oil and gas industry association leaders immediately criticized the proposals. American Petroleum Institute Pres. Jack
N. Gerard said on May 29 that the draft poses a major threat
to US energy security, and to the jobs, revenues, and secure
energy supplies that would result from more domestic oil
and gas development. “We need more energy. Provisions of
this draft bill will not provide us with more energy. Instead,
the draft bill will impose hurdles, drive up costs, and stifle
investments, which will lead to less energy,” he maintained.
The Natural Gas Supply Association plans to send a letter
to House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J.
Rahall (D-W.Va.) and the majority staff, “letting them know
that this legislation eliminates jobs, reduces domestic supply,
and puts upward pressure on natural gas prices at a time
when people are worried about jobs and prices,” said NGSA
Pres. R. Skip Horvath on May 29.

Payments in billions
Horvath noted that gas producers remitted $2.9 billion to
the federal government in royalties, rents, and other payments in 2007, and more than doubled such payments to
$7.2 billion in 2008. “Those numbers don’t even include the
taxes we pay,” Horvath said, citing US Energy Information
Administration figures showing that major gas producers
had an effective income tax rate of 40.3% in 2007, significantly higher than the 35% US statutory rate and the 26.6%
effective rate for all US manufacturers.

Smart policies
key to gas

N

atural gas utilities often face
different issues than producers
and pipelines. But keeping domestic
supplies abundant and affordable
by resisting rash legislative proposals was very much on Chris McGill’s
mind as he prepared to visit Houston.
“It’s an interesting contrast,” he
told me during a June 2 interview at
the American Gas Association, where
he’s managing director of policy
analysis. “In the short-to-medium
term, if we are pushed legislatively
in the direction of encouraging
alternative and renewable energy
sources and dealing with global
climate change, natural gas will be
very important.”
The US market has clearly grown
in the last 3-4 years, McGill said.
Technology, discovery rates, and
economics all have improved. The US
supply picture is very solid, and that’s
before including LNG imports.
“It’s an abundance message, but
diversity also is important. You have
to have policies that support developing these resources. If you start
picking off options, whether in the
Intermountain West or on the Outer
Continental Shelf, this abundant
resource could become limited,”
McGill warned.

had progress in burner-tip efficiency
and in securing new supplies in the
past few years,” he said.
“More important, gas is available
right now. What’s more, we have the
domestic supplies to meet foreseeable
demand,” McGill said.
In a week when a House Natural
Resources subcommittee was holding
a hearing on hydraulic fracturing
and the American Petroleum Institute scheduled a teleconference with
reporters on the technology, McGill
also acknowledged the controversy
surrounding the process for producing gas from shale formations.

An inappropriate link

One problem in the debate is
linking hydraulic fracturing to water
problems associated with coalbed
methane production, which occurs
much closer to the surface and is
likelier to pose challenges in keeping
impurities out of potable aquifers,
McGill said.
“A frac job at 7,000 ft below the
surface, if it’s properly done, will be
separated by thousands of feet from
an aquifer. If the well is properly
drilled and cased, production should
not disturb drinking water supplies,”
McGill said.

“At a time when unemployment is
running in the double digits in states
like California and Michigan, now is
not the time to raise taxes or create
uncertainty in the energy market. That
hurts consumers on both the job front
and in the pocketbook. By our calculations, natural gas provides approximately 4 million American jobs. This
legislative proposal will put those jobs
at risk,” Horvath said.
Other trade association officials tried
to quantify impacts and resolve uncertainties in the legislative draft. “The
bill, as a package, seems to express an
anti-oil, anti-natural gas bias. We’ve
completed a review and are waiting to
discuss it with member companies,”
Richard L. Ranger, a senior policy advisor at API, told OGJ on May 29.
Kathleen Sgamma, government
affairs director at the Independent
Petroleum Association of Mountain
States, said, “It’s clear that they’re trying
to boost renewable energy development on public lands. At the same time,
they’re making it more difficult to
produce natural gas, which we need to
enable those renewable energy resources and tackle climate change. On the
one hand, the government is trying to
increase renewable energy production.
On the other hand, it’s making it more
difficult to develop the natural gas that
will be needed to back up intermittent
renewable sources.”
Daniel T. Naatz, vice-president of federal resources and political affairs at the
Independent Petroleum Association of
America, said, “We need to look more
closely at these proposals, which are
only a draft. Our main concern is that
it will create further delays. We’ve seen
from the environmentalists’ playbooks
that the more opportunities there are,
the more they’ll make it difficult to
actually do work. The idea of planning

he oil and gas industry is not
often thought of as a vehicle for
making peace. But in Turkey these
days they are thinking otherwise following the start of oil exports from
Iraqi Kurdistan.
One commentator said fostering
ties between Turkey and Iraq’s Kurdish Regional Government (KRG),
marked by oil exports via the IraqTurkey pipeline, could give Ankara an
upper hand in its fight against terror.
That fight is the one waged by
Turkey against the outlawed Partiya
Karkeren Kurdistan (PKK). According to Ankara, the PKK is a Kurdish
secessionist organization that uses
terrorism against civilian and military
targets to achieve its political goal of
an independent Kurdish state.
Diplomats said steps taken by
the KRG to combat the PKK would
boost bilateral ties, giving the Turkish
regime an edge over the PKK.

the Taq Taq and Tawke fields.
Essentially, the thinking behind
the diplomat’s words suggests that
the pipeline connection between the
KRG and Turkey will be stronger than
any relationship between the KRG
and the PKK.
Ultimately, the Turkish diplomat
is suggesting that with its oil now in
Turkish hands, the KRG would not be
willing to support any action of the
PKK against Turkey. After all, it would
not take much for the Turks to shut
down the line.

Stability important

However, another observer, Kurdish journalist Rebwar Karim Wali,
warned that the KRG could not do
much against the PKK. “Neither the
Unites States nor Turkey would want

At the same time, concerns have
already been voiced over the potential
impact of exploration and development
on Abkhazia’s environment—an issue
addressed by the country’s Minister of
Economy Kristina Ozgan.
“Rosneft promises to employ
advanced methods and technologies
in developing offshore deposits,” said
Ozgan. “When the implementation

“I am optimistic we can deliver good
news in 90 days,” said Brazil President
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva following his
meeting with Venezuela President Hugo
Chavez. “In that period we will be able
to define all the details, not only of the
[Abreu e Lima] refinery, but also of
Petrobras’s participation in the Orinoco
belt,” Lula said.
Earlier in a private session accidentally broadcast to reporters, the two presidents expressed their irritation with the
continued breakdown of negotiations
between Petrobras and PDVSA.
“I confess my frustration, but it’s the
fault of both countries that we haven’t
been capable of reaching an accord,”
Chavez said, referring to talks between
the two oil companies that began in
2005. The Venezuelan president also
expressed regret that Petrobras is one
of the few important international oil
companies without any operations in
the Orinoco belt. Referring to the Abreu
e Lima refinery project, Lula joked,
“The accord was not possible because
Petrobras and PDVSA are two very
pretty and vigorous young ladies who
fight over any problem.”

Extended agreement
In the absence of a new agreement,
Petrobras and PDVSA executives decided
on a 90-day extension of the agreement
they signed last year, which calls for
joint participation in the refinery now
under construction by Petrobras.
When built, Abreu e Lima will be
capable of processing 200,000 b/d of
oil, with Petrobras and PDVSA each supplying half of the required crude.
But the project has been delayed
by a dispute over how much the joint
venture will pay for the crude from
Venezuela, according to Petrobras Chief
Executive Jose Sergio Gabrielli. He
said he also objects to PDVSA’s bid for
Brazilian distribution rights to the fuel
produced by the refinery.
Gabrielli’s remarks echoed earlier
statements by Petrobras supply and
refining director Paulo Roberto Costa.
In February, Costa said PDVSA needed
to change its position on the price of

Shell’s headquarters in The Hague will
be strongly affected.
In other recent company news:
• Eni SPA and Enel SPA will assign to
OAO Gazprom a 51% stake in SeverEnergia, a Russian holding company with
exploration and production licenses.
The deal is expected to close in June.
• China National Petroleum Corp.
subsidiary PetroChina, taking a first-ever
step away from its parent company, has
agreed to pay $1.02 billion to Keppel
Corp. for a minority stake in Singapore
Petroleum Co.
• Valero Energy Corp. agreed to acquire Dow Chemical Co.’s 45% interest
in the Total Raffinaderij Nederland NV
(TRN) for $725 million.

Shell revamp
The restructuring measures are
intended to simplify Shell’s company
structure, improve project implementation, and cut costs. They are similar to
recent initiatives by BP PLC and ExxonMobil Corp.
A Shell spokesman told OGJ no
figures had been given on job cuts or
potential economic savings. “Some
people will have to internally apply for
their jobs as it will be redefined; others
will have to leave.”
The revamp began with the abrupt
resignation of Linda Cook, head of
gas and power, whose division will be
subsumed with oil sands and with exploration and production into two new
streamlined units. She left by “mutual
agreement,” Shell said.
Cook’s departure was June 1, prior
to new chief executive Peter Voser succeeding Jeroen van der Veer on July 1.

years, the last 5 as executive director
of gas and power, Shell trading, global
solutions, and technology. Under her
tenure, Shell’s LNG capacity increased
over 60% in the last 5 years.
Analysts welcomed Voser’s plans that
stress cost-cutting and operational performance, but they have concerns about
subdividing the upstream between
two directors. David Thomas, analyst

at Citigroup Inc., said, “[T]he level of
financial disclosure under the streamlined reporting lines may be less than
has been the case to date.”
Upstream will consist of two businesses: upstream Americas covering
North and South America, and upstream
international, covering the rest of the
world.
Shell’s high upstream costs are a
major issue because it is developing
unconventional production, such as
Canadian oil sands, GTL, and LNG. The
company expects to invest up to $32
billion this year.
Shell’s downstream division will
contain the refining, marketing, and
chemicals businesses and will be expanded to include trading and alternative energy activities in Shell, excluding
wind, which will be part of upstream.
Mark Williams will be the director of
downstream.
“A new business—projects and
technology—will combine all of Shell’s
major project delivery, technical services, and technology capability covering
both upstream and downstream. It will
also oversee Shell’s safety and environment performance,” said Shell.

an estimated 5 billion boe.
“The parties also agreed to produce
first gas by June 2011 from the Samburskoye field. The parties have 90 days
to define the plan and obtain all the
necessary authorizations, including the
extensions of the licenses by Rosnedra,
the Russian authority regulating the exploitation of the country’s mineral and
oil resources,” said Gazprom.
Enel Chief Executive Officer and
General Manager Fulvio Conti said this
partnership would enable Enel to grow
in the Russian market throughout the
entire value chain, from gas fields to
generation and sale of electricity. “From
this perspective, the entry of Gazprom
provides us with a guarantee of being
able to continue contributing a reliable
supply of gas to our Russian power

through our SeverEnergia gas quota.”

The Hebron project on the Grand

producing by the end of 2017 and
recover 566 million bbl of oil over a
30-year productive life, said project operator ExxonMobil Canada Properties.
The partners expected to decide in

Initial development will involve
Hebron field only, but the unit includes
four significant discovery license areas,
1006, 1007, 1009, and 1010.
The four SDLs contain the most
likely extent of the oil for the delineated
pools in the Hebron Unit, said the project description, filed in part to support
environmental studies.
“The Hebron Unit could be expanded if additional studies, seismic or
exploration and/or delineation drilling
proves that economically recoverable oil
pool accumulations extend beyond the
currently envisioned boundaries” of the
unit, the company said.
A stand-alone, reinforced gravitybased structure would be used to
develop the giant field with water
injection as the main drive mechanism.
That facility would be built at Bull Arm
on Trinity Bay 130 km northwest of St.
John’s.

way it is developing the

Colorado. It has started
using skidable rigs that
can drill up to 22 wells from a single
well pad and fracturing operations that
can stimulate wells on multiple pads
from a central location.
These along with other changes in
operations have made the gas development both more efficient and environmentally friendly, according to Williams.

Piceance operations
Williams acquired its interest in
the Piceance basin when it purchased
Barrett Resources Inc. in 2001. Barrett
had drilled its first well in the basin in
1983.
The producing sands are in the Wil-

ducing well in the basin compared with
having only 400 producers 9 years ago.
The three main fields it is developing
are Grand Valley, Parachute, and Rulison.
He noted the basin currently produces about 1.7-1.8 bcfd with Williams
producing about 850 MMcfd gross,
making Williams the largest producer in
the basin.
He said that for 2009 the company
has a $500-600
million capitalspending program
and will employ
9-10 drilling rigs.
Its plans are to drill
about 300 wells in
2009, compared
with the 600 drilled in 2008 when it
had 25 rigs running, Soychak said.
In April 2009, Williams had 9 rigs
working in the basin, with 8 in Garfield
County and 1 in Rio Blanco County.
He added that Williams has about

William operates out of an office in

Steve Soychak, district manager for
Williams, said the company in early
2009 completed its 3,000th gas pro-

deeper targets. Williams has not drilled
a dry hole in the basin in several years,

Soychak said that
drilling during the
1980s and 1990s in
the basin typically
involved one well

location or pad. But
to minimize land
disturbance and gain
efficiency, William
has started drilling
up to 22 wells from
a single well pad using skidable drilling
rigs similar to ones
used offshore, such
as the Nabors Drilling USA LP Super
Sundowner and the

A novel approach
using computational fluid dynamics
techniques provides a way for determining the characteristics of gas passing through a gas-lift valve.
In the method, CFD calculations
numerically solve the governing equations for a flowing fluid. To facilitate the
simultaneous solution of the governing equations, the procedure involves
dividing the flow space (the inside of
the valve available for gas flow) into
sufficiently small finite volumes or cells.
The accuracy of flow modeling greatly
depends on the proper setup of these
cells. This article describes this spatial
distribution.
After one properly sets up the cell

termine the gas volumes passed by the
valve under static conditions for different combinations of valve stem travel,
injection, and production pressures.
In dynamic conditions, however,
valve stem travel is a function of the net
opening force on the valve stem tip. The
authors developed an iterative procedure to describe this valve behavior that
finds this force by integrating the pressure distribution on the valve stem tip,
The result of the proposed model
is the dynamic performance curve of
the gas-lift valve from which one can
obtain the injected gas rate vs. injection,
production, and dome charge pressures.
The procedure developed results in
gas injection rates close to those determined from the API RP11V2 model.

Characterizing valves
Although gas passage characteristics
of gas-lift valves are important, the industry did not investigate the problem
in depth for many years. In the past, the
static force balance equations and the
assumption that valves while open behave as square-edged orifices described
the performance of gas-lift valves.
This characterization assumed that
the valve quickly and fully opened as

soon as the injection and production
pressures satisfied the opening conditions.
When the valve was fully open,
the basis of the gas flow rate calculations was the valve’s port size and the
equation originally proposed by the

by dividing the flow space into a finite

It makes calculations at the geometrical centers of the cells (the node points)
and first calculates the fluid and flow
parameters. Then it solves the algebraic
equations resulting from the integration
of the basic differential equations at cell

fluid.
Because these three basic differential
equations governing the flow conditions have five unknowns, an unambiguous solution requires two more equations. These are the equation of state
for the flowing fluid and the equation
describing the change of the enthalpy
with the state parameters (Equations 4
and 5).
The five equations constitute a sys48

tem of equations with five unknowns,
making the simultaneous solution of
them theoretically possible.

Numerical solution
Because an analytical solution of the
basic flow equations (Equations 1-5)
is possible only for very simple cases,
complex cases usually require numerical solutions, so-called finite element
models.
The computational fluid dynamics

Results of CFD calculations depend
on the proper setup for the geometrical
model of the flow space because improper models can cause convergence
difficulties and erroneous results. In our
case, the geometrical model means the
representation of the internal space of
the gas-lift valve where gas flow takes
place.
Fig. 1 shows the part of the valve
investigated. The space available for
gas flow constitutes the flow space for
the CFD calculations. The calculations
require the filling of this space with
interconnected hexahedrons representing the cells.
Ensuring higher accuracies and faster
solutions requires selection of the hexahedrons that are nearly cubes.
The most important part of the flow
space is around the valve stem tip for
two reasons:
1. The geometry in this area is the
most complicated, involving the valve
ball that is difficult to approximate with
hexahedrons.
2. Proper knowledge of pressure
distribution on the valve stem tip is essential for calculating the forces acting
on the valve stem.
Fig. 2 displays cell structure details at
this critical part of the flow space.
The remaining parts of the flow
space have a tube shape below the valve
port and form an annulus above the
valve port. These are easier to represent
than the region around the valve stem

tip. Finally, Fig. 3 shows an approximation of the total flow space of the
gas-lift valve.
The cell structure in Fig. 3 involves
75,000 cells. Because this large number
of cells led to an excessive CFD program
run time, the authors investigated the
possibility of simplifying the flow geometry. To reduce the cell number while
sustaining calculation accuracy, the
analysis tried two simplifying modifications as follows:
1. Replacing the four gas inlet ports
by one of the same total cross-sectional
area.
2. Trimming the two ends of the
flow space by decreasing the length of
the tube-like shape downstream of the
valve port and the annulus upstream of
the valve port.
These modifications reduced the
required cells to about 10,000. Fig. 4
displays the final cell structure.
Computational time with the new
flow space configuration was about one
tenth of the original run times.
To ensure that the reduced cell number did not sacrifice calculation accuracy, the analysis included a set of control
calculations. Comparisons of the results
of pressure distributions along the flow
path showed negligible differences,
justifying the use of the simplified flow
space configuration.

Installation of new suction scrubbers is technically feasible to eliminate
the liquid entrainment found with the
existing suction scrubbers. Space limitations, however, precluded new scrubbers being much taller than existing
scrubbers. Although this may have been

economic and technical uncertainty.
Economic risk is similar to that for
the new scrubber option. Estimation of
time to replace internals would probably be somewhat more accurate than
for scrubber replacement, but all such
estimation would have to be in the
absence of physical inspection of each
vessel’s interior.
As with scrubber replacement, this
option would also require a complete
field shutdown with total loss of production. Also, the same concerns with
the non-routine nature of the task and
control-of-work procedures apply here
as well.
Technical risk is always present in a
separator retrofit. The Big A/B suction
scrubbers were already retrofitted once
in 1995. Current scrubber performance
does not meet the process specification
for liquid entrainment guaranteed for
that retrofit. Advancements in separator
design technology over the last 10-20
years, however, afford a greater chance
that a new retrofit would be more successful than the 1995 upgrade.
If no other technically viable option
were available that could be installed
with less economic risk, then a more
detailed evaluation would have been
performed to choose between scrubber
replacement or retrofit.

A third option was chosen, however, which does not require a full field
shutdown for installation and removes
the technical risk associated with
replacement of scrubber internals. The
chosen option also significantly reduces
insulation and heat trace requirements,
as described presently.

with an upper limit of 275° F. Current discharge temperatures cannot
be increased and still retain a reasonable margin of safety. Alternatively, gas
cooler limitations and potential for
hydrate formation do not allow the suction scrubbers to be operated at lower
temperatures as a means of lowering
normal discharge temperatures.

compressor cylinders. This option was
rejected for technical reasons.
First, these vessels were designed
to dampen pulsations, not to separate
liquids and vapor. As such, these bottles
are not amenable to liquid-level detection and control. Second, even though
each of these bottles has an internal
weir that captures some liquids, the
weirs are designed with weep holes
that allow any captured liquids to drain
slowly through to the other side and
enter the compressor cylinder.
Routine operation of pulsation bottle
drains has been and still is an important
step in minimizing the ongoing infiltration of liquids into Big A/B cylinders.
But it is only a temporary measure that
is insufficient to prevent all liquids from
entering the compressors and causing
mechanical damage.

Solution
The solution to Milne Point’s entrained liquids problem consists of several interrelated actions. Many of these
have already been implemented, which
has considerably reduced the frequency
and severity of liquids-related events.
All remaining actions will be completed by the end of summer 2009.

Operational procedure
During periods of high cylinder
knocking, plant operators tried various
ways to reduce knocking by optimizing
54

compressor scrubber operation. These
efforts generally included changing
the upstream gas cooler’s discharge
temperature set point and lowering the
scrubber’s liquid level. Such operational
changes yielded mixed results, but
more importantly, provided valuable
feedback to allow proper operating
guidelines to be established.
One important lesson of these operator interventions was undesirable effects
of setting the gas cooler’s discharge
temperatures too high or too low.
If the temperature were too low,
liquids formed more rapidly than the
scrubbers could dump them. Operators had to open manual bypass valves
to reduce liquids to a safe level. If the
temperature were raised too high, the
gas exiting the scrubbers, being much
richer and warmer, condensed rapidly
in the cooler downstream piping. This
was accompanied by an increase in
knocking that did not stabilize until the
downstream piping warmed enough to
reduce the rate of condensation.
Operating data and process simulation results helped establish a safe operating temperature range of 75-95° F.
for the scrubbers. Except during severe
ambient conditions that affect gas cooler operations, temperatures are now
normally maintained between 80-85° F.
Also, if and when the gas cooler’s temperature set point changes are required,
operators now make them gradually if
possible. This practice minimizes the

condensation of
liquids in downstream piping.
Concerns with
the existing levelcontrol system
capability prevented permanent
changes to normal

level. This will be
done, however,

plant turnaround.

Control logic reconﬁg
Early process analysis of compressor scrubber operation revealed that
the temperature of the process gas
exiting the upstream aerial gas coolers
fluctuated considerably and was often
off its set point. This was due to the
temperature control scheme employed
for the gas coolers, which set the cooler
plenum temperature as the primary
control variable and the process gas
temperature as secondary. This resulted
in a fairly steady plenum temperature
with an often unstable process gas
temperature.
Operating experience had already established the importance of maintaining
a stable scrubber temperature, which
was not possible with such a temperature control scheme. Discussions with
plant automation technicians confirmed
that the plenum temperature did not
need to be maintained at a constant
temperature but only that it could not
be allowed to drop below a specified
minimum temperature to prevent hydrate formation in the gas cooler tubes.
The gas cooler’s temperature control
scheme was modified to make the process gas temperature the primary control variable. The plenum temperature
was allowed to fluctuate as necessary to
maintain the process gas temperature,
subject only to remaining above its
specified minimum temperature. This

ConSepT performed engineering
calculations and computational fluid
dynamic simulations of these demisters
under Big A/B operating conditions.
Results indicated more than 99% liquid
removal efficiency over a wide range of
inlet liquid loading. The impact of pressure pulsations from the suction bottles
was also analyzed and found not to be a
factor in demister performance.

Heat tracing, insulation
After installation of the inline demisters, heat tracing will be installed on
the four Big A/B suction bottles on the
Nos. 1 and 2 cylinders and on the short
pipe segments between the bottles and
demisters.
The pipe segments will then be
insulated, and insulating blankets will be
wrapped around the suction bottles. This
heat tracing and insulation will prevent
any condensation of liquids downstream
of the demisters to provide clean, dry gas
to the compressor cylinders.

On line monitoring
One of the recommendations made
for continuous assurance of Big A/B
mechanical integrity was to install on
line compressor monitoring and data
collection systems. Lack of sufficient,
relevant historical data often prevents
exact determination of the root cause of
a machine failure.
A separate project was initiated to
install Prognost and Kongsberg systems,
which now provide continuous, realtime data to monitor compressor process temperatures, bearing and cylinder
liner temperatures, process pressures,
vibration, rotational speed, rod position, and lube-oil system performance.
These robust systems provide numerous alarms of impending or actual
machine damage. Potential problems
related to liquids ingestion are readily
detected, but this is only a small part of
the capability of these systems.

limits potential damage to the environment, as well as to its reputation and

Intelligent pigging has proven useful in assessing pipeline condition for
both multiphase and oil transport lines.
It sets a new baseline for future life
predictions by corrosion modeling or
growth extrapolations. Intelligent pigging, however, can miss defects, resulting in unanticipated pipeline leaks.
The first article of this series (OGJ,
June 1, 2009, p. 54) concentrated on
microbial-influenced corrosion (MIC)
modeling and subsequent intelligent
in-line inspection of Forties pipelines.
This concluding article details a leak
that occurred despite these efforts and
the response to it.

Forties leak
An oily sheen on the sea surface on
Apr. 4, 2008, disclosed a pipeline leak.
Pipeline shut-in occurred immediately
and a remotely operated vehicle inspection vessel mobilized to investigate the
leak. The leak lay about 258 m downstream of the pipeline tie-in spool piece
flanged connection at Forties Bravo. It
displaced the sandy seabed near the leak
hole, creating a 2-m deep hole.
A diving support vessel and Plidco

leak site a few days later. Divers inspected the leak site and confirmed it as
being at the intersection of the line pipe

weld between two pipe lengths, near
the bottom of the pipe. Fig. 1 shows the
leak hole.

tion of the in-line inspection trace.
The precise nature of the eventually
failed defect at the time of the in-line
inspection can no longer be determined for the Forties Bravo to Charlie
pipeline. But in the absence of another
credible cause, the leak was ascribed
to an original weld defect combined
with progressive deterioration due to
internal corrosion, eventually removing
remaining WT at the weld. The original
weld defect likely consisted of a lack
of side-wall fusion not large enough
to have been detected by the original
weld radiographs or to have failed the
pipeline commissioning hydrotest at
193 barg.
At the time of the in-line inspection,
the weld defect likely had the form of
a near through-wall feature outside
the detection capability of the in-line
inspection system. A probable loss of
containment lay outside the detection
capability of the in-line inspection tool.
In-line inspections will generally
provide reliable condition information
for line pipe, in line with their stated
capabilities. But their capabilities may
not apply to certain pipeline features,
including welds. Though in-line inspection can be part of a pipeline condition
monitoring plan, it does not fully confirm integrity of a pipeline. A residual
risk remains of failure due to defects,
including metal loss features, outside
the detection capabilities of the in-line
inspection tool.

Rapid response
Complacency or over confidence in
modeling, analysis, risk-based inspection, and intelligent pig programs can
hinder swift operational response to
failures. Fostering an operational ability to launch an intensive engineering effort is paramount to achieving a
positive outcome when a pipeline fails.
Apache faced two scenarios for response and in both cases showed what
can be achieved when decisive leadership focuses on operational problems.
The first scenario was responding
to the original findings of the intelligent pig run of June 2007 on the PL55
58

Installation of this clamp as repair to the weld
junction of the Forties Bravo to Forties Charlie
pipeline took a total of 6 days following detection
of the leak (Fig. 2).
Forties Bravo to Forties Charlie multiphase pipeline. The quantity, nature, and
severity of the defects, the future lifeextension requirements of the pipeline,
and a risked cost-benefit analysis undertaken by a small team within 3 days of
receiving the intelligent pig data guided
the decision to replace the pipeline.
The replacement project started with
no personnel, materials, or contracts
in place. It required signing 12 new
contracts and agreements, production
of 108 specifications and procedures by
Apache and its contractors, and 31vessel-days of installation work.
Successful completion of the project
took 95 days, starting on receipt of an
email from the intelligent pigging company, stating “we have identified some
deep features” and ending with the final
survey of the trenched, buried, and hydrotested pipeline ready for tie-in. Despite the fast-track nature of the project,
pipeline installation took place within
1 day of the original base line schedule
produced 6 days into the project.
Beside being executed swiftly, the
project complied with the full legal
requirements of and support from the
Department of Business, Enterprise,
and Regulatory Reform and the UK
Health and Safety Executive. Execution
delivered all normal safety requirements, exceeded required specifications, and occurred on budget and
without accidents. This speed of delivery is an achievement when compared
with the last pipeline replaced in the

Forties field in 1994, which cost more
to install and took more than 2 years
to complete.
The new Forties Bravo to Forties
Charlie multiphase pipeline is designated PL2496.
The second scenario for an operational response came 2 weeks before
decommissioning the original Forties
Bravo to Forties Charlie pipeline when
the platform reported a small slick. Repair entailed the installation of a clamp
by divers in 6 days: 1 day for ROV
vessel mobilization, 2 days waiting on
weather, 1 day of ROV inspection, 1 day
for diving-support vessel mobilization,
and 1 day to install and test the clamp
(Fig. 2).
Timely installation of this clamp
prevented any additional environmental
damage, allowed production of an additional 34,000 bbl of oil before decommissioning the line and enabled full
decommissioning of the pipeline and
suitable protection of the line following
decommission and before recovery.
The employment of mission analysis and the requirement for a sense
of urgency led to the fundamentally
successful response operations. Mission
analysis or maneuver theory is the military strategic and tactical philosophy
of planning; utilizing surprise, speed,
and economy of effort. This military
battlefield proven method transfers well
to the business environment.1 2 Maneuver theory requires aggressive, decisive,
timely and well informed decision making supported by:
• Porous, flexible, and rapid planning.
• Devolved decision making.
• Organization capability.
• Initiative.
• Trust, training, and competence.
Applying a sense of urgency evolves
from recognizing time as a constraint
on a project along with cost, quality,
risk, and benefits. A sense of urgency,
however, does not allow discarding or
ignoring the process or discipline of
project management. Time as a major

and clear risk-based decision making.
Apache’s key focus areas included:
• Senior management commitment.
Full commitment and support by senior
management allows the operational
staff to move forward with clear objectives and boundaries, enabling speedy
decision making.
• Leadership drive. Applying all the
qualities and functions of leadership
into the project management process from concept to closeout ensures
implementation of command, control,
and communication throughout the
project.
• Contractor-management interface.
Understanding the contractors’ business
at both technical and commercial levels
but specifying only functional delivery
criteria ensures performance, efficiency,
and effective support of contractors in
the delivery of their services. All key
stakeholders should be involved and informed at project initiation and through
its lifecycle to final commissioning and
beyond.
• Small, flat, focused internal teams.
Keeping the project team tight reduces
interfaces and accelerates communication. It also creates individual responsibility and commitment to delivery
of the project, rather than relying on a
process or committees to drive outputs.
• Risk appreciation though knowledge and competence. Employing competent experienced staff and contractors
ensures understanding the technical
risks brought by the project and inherent risks at the worksite.
• Configuration management. This
process ensures all parties have the latest knowledge and understanding of
project design.
Apache previously used this missionoriented approach in a 2004 Forties
repair: replacing the 12-in. OD Forties
Echo export riser with a new steel riser
in 84 days from a standing start and
with an installation contractor other
than that which had performed the
initial installation.
Riser replacement entailed installing
a J-tube on the end of a redundant mud
outfall caisson, floating out a steel riser

from Leith, UK, pulling and plastically
deforming the steel riser up through
the new J-tube and existing caisson, installing new spools subsea, and welding
the riser into new topside piping. ✦

Casing patch designed for high pressures
This new 15,000 psi casing patch is
designed to simply, quickly, and economically repair damaged casing in
high-pressure environments.
The patch (patent application pending) can seal internal
and external pressure without
restricting the bore’s internal
diameter. Once installed, the
patch restores integrity to the
damaged casing and becomes a
permanent part of the string.
Major load bearing components are manufactured of
alloy steel. A top sub, bowl, and
cut-lipped guide, plus optional
extensions make up the outer
components of the assembly.
Internal components include a
basket grapple control, basket
grapple, four Type L high-pressure packer
sets, and a packer protector with shear
pins. A longer-than-standard basket grapple engages more of the casing to provide

additional pull load. High-pressure packers
are made of a blend of synthetic rubber
and Kevlar material that is compatible for
service with most drilling and completion
fluids, and is resistant to gas invasion and
abrasion. For maximum top-to-bottom
patch integrity, two inverted packers provide sealing in both directions. The packers
are fully covered by a packer protector to
guard them against damage when engaging the casing into the patch. The packer
protector is secured by shear pins that
break when subjected to the excess stress
caused when the casing comes into contact
with the packer protector.

New oil ﬁeld water-cooled clutches, brakes
New AquaMaKKs water-cooled clutches
and brakes from Wichita Clutch USA,
Wichita Falls, Tex., are air, hydraulic, or
spring-set actuated and feature heat-dissipating copper wear plates and nonmetallic
composite water jackets that are optimized

for heavy-duty continuous slip tension
applications.
Available in sizes of 19-36 in. (friction
lining OD), the units provide as much as
3,400 hp heat absorption.
The family of clutches and brakes is
suited for tension control in traditional
style drawworks control systems, for integration into electronic
drilling systems, and
for accurate tension
control of positioning
and mooring winches
that require high heat
dissipation.
Designed with a
series of alternating friction disks and water
jackets, AquaMaKKs transmits torque by
applying axial force from the pneumatic,
hydraulic, or spring-set actuator, which
provides accurate torque control for constant tensioning, the supplier points out.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Lands bill a new
package of horrors
for US oil and gas
As horror follows horror in Washington,
DC, the US oil and gas industry needs a
scorecard to keep track of threats building
against it.
Oil & Gas Journal reports continuously
on political and regulatory developments.
The stories appear on the OGJ Online and
Washington Pulse web sites, in associated
electronic newsletters and, of course, in the
magazine itself.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

In the May 25 edition, the print editorial
assembled a catalog of the most-pressing
industry headaches, enacted and proposed
(p. 18). It was an impressively full list. And
it already has grown.
Large among the latest reasons to worry
is a bill under discussion by the House
Committee on Natural Resources called
the Federal Lands and Resources Energy
Development Act.
According to a draft now making the
rounds, the bill would expand the federallands bureaucracy and raise payments by
leaseholders.
It would create one bureau to handle
leasing, inspections, and auditing of all
energy activity on all federal land. It also
would add planning steps, including a
system of regional councils for energy development on the Outer Continental Shelf.
In other words, the bill would multiply
opportunities for drilling opponents to
block activity.
Among onshore reforms, the bill would
eliminate noncompetitive leasing, cut initial
lease terms by half to 5 years, and require
regulations to ensure “diligent development.” It would raise the minimum royalty
to 18.75% from 12.5%, the minimum bonus
bid to at least $2.50/acre from $2/acre, and
rental rates to at least $3/acre from $2.50/
acre. It also would call for “best management practices” rules to “ensure sound,
efﬁcient, and environmentally responsible
energy development.”
Offshore reforms include a no-discharge
requirement for new leases and repeal of
deepwater royalty relief. For all leases, the
bill would impose a $4/acre fee for nonproducing leases in their 4th and 5th years,
rising to $10/acre in 6th years and beyond.
This combination represents the secondmost effective way imaginable to foreclose
oil and gas production from federal land.
The best way to choke energy supply,
of course, is to issue no oil and gas leases
at all.
At that, the US already has become
painfully adept.

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Hope ﬂoats oil prices
The brief May 28 meeting of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries essentially “was over before it started” after Saudi Arabia Oil Minister
Ali I. al-Naimi said in advance that the world economy is showing enough signs of
recovery to cope with $75-80/bbl oil, said analysts at KBC Market Services, a division
of KBC Process Technology Ltd. in Surrey, UK.
The July contract for benchmark US crudes escalated to $65.08/bbl on the New
York Mercantile Exchange after OPEC voted to maintain its 24.85 million bbl production ceiling for the 11 members other than Iraq. It continued climbing to $66.31/bbl
May 29, capping a ﬁve-session rally with the highest closing since Nov. 4.
Most independent analysts disagree with Al-Naimi’s “level of conﬁdence,” however. KBC analysts expect world oil demand to decline 1.9 million b/d this year and
drop another 300,000 b/d in 2010—“back to the level seen in 2005.”
Still, just because $75/bbl oil is a minority view “does not mean that it is not
going to happen,” said Paul Horsnell, a managing director and head of commodities research at Barclays Capital in London. “We expect prices to move above $75,
and potentially fairly rapidly, as the market’s fear of economic discontinuities abates
further,” he said.
Still, KBC analysts claimed, “We have an oil market where recent price increases
are governed not by what is going on now in the real world but by what could be a
rosier outlook in 6 months’ time. Investment funds looking for promising returns are
buying into oil and other commodities in the belief that a return to growth will happen, and they want to be in on the ground ﬂoor ahead of this recovery. By climbing
on board now they are of course helping to kick-start the price recovery.”
Meanwhile, they said, demand is weak and shows little sign of improving, while
oil stocks—based on data for primary consumer markets—are not yet falling. Moreover, ofﬁcial inventory ﬁgures “exclude oil held offshore in a growing armada of
rented tankers,” KBC said.
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC, also
noted the rapid rise in crude prices over the last 3 months was “based more on hope
than fact.” He said, “One of the few explanations for the bullish move that we ﬁnd
compelling is that the replacement cost of crude oil is at least $60/bbl and perhaps
as high as $80/bbl.”
Does compliance matter?
In a press conference, OPEC ofﬁcials “skillfully dodged” the question whether
stricter quota compliance would be sought now crude has increased above $60/bbl.
“So we can assume that in the current climate quota compliance is no longer a serious issue, as long of course as it does not seriously deteriorate,” said KBC analysts.
Latest US crude imports show Saudi Arabia embracing its role as a swing supplier. “US imports of Saudi crude oil in March went below the 1 million b/d mark
for the ﬁrst time since 1990 and were at the lowest level since November 1988, said
Olivier Jakob, Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland. “In February and March, US imports of
Saudi crude oil were 525,000 b/d lower than a year ago, but that was not lost to all
as fellow OPEC member Angola shipped 300,000 b/d more crude to the US than a
year ago,” he said.
US oil inventories
Benchmark US crude inventories fell 5.4 million bbl to 363.1 million bbl the week
ended May 22. It was the third consecutive weekly decline. However, part of that loss
may be because bad weather closed the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port on May 22-23.
That same week implied demand for gasoline jumped 300,000 bbl to 9.5 million bbl,
a level last seen in August 2007, “despite a 1 million bbl increase in gasoline imports
and a much higher reﬁnery utilization rate,” Pritchard Capital analysts said.
Although demand increased just prior to the May 24 Memorial Day holiday,
Jacques H. Rousseau at Soleil-Back Bay Research said, “We suspect gasoline consumption will not be sustained at these levels” with unemployment still on the rise.
Meanwhile, gasoline production escalated to 9.38 million b/d—the largest weekly
total since August 2008. “Gasoline inventories could be on the rise in the coming
weeks,” he said. Despite continuous draws on crude and gasoline stocks in May,
overall US petroleum stocks remained “absolutely unchanged for the third week in a
row,” Jakob said. The Department of Energy’s undeﬁned “Other Oils” category “has
been continuously building stocks as gasoline has been drawing stocks and is now
at an historic high” up 15.8 million bbl in 4 weeks, he said.

Baker Hughes

Advancing Reservoir Performance

Deepwater:
Horizontal Openhole
Gravel-Pack Completions
First Successful Horizontal Openhole Gravel Pack
in Deepwater Stybarrow Field
The Stybarrow Field consists of slope turbidite sandstones of the
Macedon Formation in the Exmouth Sub-Basin offshore Western
Australia. It is one of two fields in Australia’s deepest water
development, in more than 800 m of water, and was developed
entirely by subsea wells connected to an FPSO.
Lateral Reservoir Quality, Sand/Shale Heterogeneities
Lateral reservoir quality variations, difficult sand/shale
heterogeneities, and limited in-country technical experience and
infrastructure were only some of the obstacles to completing four,
near-horizontal production wells in this field. Others included gravel
packing across much longer non-reservoir sections, gravel packing
out of a milled casing window, narrow pressure margin between
circulating pressures and formation fracture pressure, large
wellbore washouts, and gravel packing at wellbore inclinations
of up to 94°.
Gravel-Pack Design With Ceramic Proppant
To solve these problems, Baker Hughes helped develop an
optimized reservoir drilling fluid and gravel carrier fluid design. We
also created a gravel pack pumping design that used a 16/20 US
Mesh ceramic proppant. This combined with our EXCLUDER2000™
medium-weave premium screen to produce the optimal sandface
completion. Baker Hughes engineers sized the screens to retain
formation sand. This would ensure sand retention in case of
incomplete gravel packs. Slurry and conformance tests with
various screen types and a range of sand facies, along with various
proppant sizes and types, concluded that inclusion of proppant
drastically reduced pressure buildup across the screens as well
as the mass of sand particles produced through the screens. The

EXCLUDER2000™ screens like those used in the Stybarrow wells have compiled an
outstanding performance record in the world’s most extreme conditions.

Baker Oil Tools gravel-pack design also contained contingencies
specific to this design in case of poor installation outcomes. Another
success factor in the project was continuity of key Baker Hughes
personnel and essential equipment from concept through execution.
Near-Record Australian Production Rates
Gravel-pack efficiency factors between 108% and 118% were
achieved despite several unforeseen geological and technical
challenges. All four Stybarrow production wells achieved
maximum sand-free rates per FPSO design capacity. Maximum
production rates from all four wells have exceeded 80,000 BOPD,
with one well producing at near-record Australian rates of 32,000
BOPD seven months after first oil.

New Methods. New Supply.
Gas production is increasing rapidly from reservoirs once considered economically
and technically impossible to develop. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds now
represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy.
But they’re still unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into
and completing wells in them are high and rising. They present unique environmental
problems.
The Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition provides a high-level
forum for discussions about solutions to these problems.

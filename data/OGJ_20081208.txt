COVER
Oil companies are developing alternatives to fossil fuels to help
meet future energy demand. Royal Dutch Shell‚Äôs mosaic of options
includes hydrogen. Earlier this year, Shell opened a combined
hydrogen and gasoline refueling station in western Los Angeles.
The cover shows a hydrogen pump and its attachments: a plug
to ground the car in case of static electricity (top center) and an
opening for the hydrogen nozzle (bottom center). In the special
report that starts on p. 26, Shell Future Fuels and CO2 Vice-Pres.
Duncan Macleod suggests commercialization of hydrogen fuel cell
vehicles could start in 2020. Cover photos by John C. Luker II for
Photographic Services, Shell International Ltd.

MMS issues assessment of hurricane damage
In its final assessment of damage to Gulf Coast oil and gas operations by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, the US Minerals Management
Service said a total of 60 offshore platforms was destroyed.
‚ÄúSome platforms that had been previously reported as having extensive damage were reassessed and determined to be destroyed,‚Äù MMS said. ‚ÄúThe destroyed platforms produced 13,657
b/d of oil and 96.5 MMcfd of natural gas, or 1.05% of the oil and
1.3% of the gas produced daily in the Gulf of Mexico.‚Äù
MMS estimated 127 of the more than 3,800 oil and gas production platforms in the gulf were exposed to hurricane conditions,
with winds greater than 74 mph from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.
Gustav made landfall Sept. 2 in Louisiana, while Ike came ashore
Sept. 13 in Galveston, Tex.
In its final assessment, MMS concluded 93 platforms suffered
moderate damage from the storms and would take as long as 3
months for repairs. Another 31 platforms had extensive damage
that could take as long as 6 months to repair.

Motions Ô¨Åled to repeal CAC‚Äôs Egyptian gas verdict
The Cairo Court for Urgent Cases plans to hold a hearing Dec.
15 to consider a motion by the State Judicial Authority to repeal a
decision by the Cairo Administrative Court (CAC) to halt Egypt‚Äôs
exports of natural gas to Israel.
In addition to the court, some 30 individual lawyers have filed
six separate motions‚Äîto be reviewed on Dec. 15, 16, 18, and
20‚Äîall aimed at repealing CAC‚Äôs Nov. 18 verdict.
The underlying appeal is that CAC‚Äôs verdict against the government cannot be sustained, as there is no contractual relationship
between the state of Egypt and the state of Israel concerning exportation of natural gas.
Instead, the contract is between the Egyptian General Authority for Petroleum and Eastern Mediterranean Gas, a private energy
consortium co-owned by Egyptian businessman Hussein Salem
and the Israeli Merhav Group.
The 30 lawyers thus claim that the export of gas does not fall
under CAC‚Äôs jurisdiction because the agreement is a purely commercial affair.
CAC had ruled that the export of Egyptian gas to Israel cannot
be carried out without parliamentary approval and ordered its halt,
saying, ‚ÄúNational resources belong to current and future genera-

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

tions, and the executive must first get parliament‚Äôs approval.‚Äù
CAC‚Äôs ruling came after opposition groups sued to suspend exports, arguing that the 15-year fixed-price agreement‚Äîrumored
to be as low as $1.50/btu‚Äîlacks any mechanism for Egypt to adjust prices to reflect current markets.
Dissatisfaction in Egypt, fueled also by Israeli actions in Palestine, is especially high as gas for December delivery last week
closed at $6.53/Mcf on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The agreement to supply Egyptian gas to Israel was signed in
June 2005 by Egyptian oil minister Sameh Fahmi and Israeli infrastructure minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer (OGJ, Oct. 20, 2008,
p. 34).
The gas being supplied to Israel goes to Israel Electric Corp.,
which has estimated that 20% of the electricity produced in Israel
over the next decade will be from Egyptian gas.

EU to seek ‚Äòobserver status‚Äô on Arctic Council
A communique released Nov. 20 by the European Commission,
‚ÄúThe European Union and the Arctic Region,‚Äù takes a position on a
part of the world the EU calls ‚Äúin rapid transformation.‚Äù
The EU will apply for permanent observer status on the Arctic
Council, a high-level intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation among its members‚ÄîCanada, Denmark (including Greenland and the Faroes Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian
Federation, Sweden, and the US‚Äîand involving indigenous communities.
The commission calls for a ‚Äúcoordinated action‚Äù of all stakeholders in order ‚Äúto protect the Arctic in unison with its population, to promote sustainable use of resources, and contribute to
enhanced Arctic multilateral governance.‚Äù
It recognizes that exploitation of the Arctic hydrocarbon resources and the opening of new navigation routes can be beneficial, providing it is done ‚Äúin full respect of the highest environmental standards.‚Äù
Describing the Arctic as ‚Äúa unique region of strategic importance, located in [Europe‚Äôs] immediate vicinity,‚Äù the commission
sets out policy objectives and recommends a series of steps in the
fields of research, environment, indigenous peoples, fisheries, hydrocarbons, shipping, legal and political framework, and cooperation with regional organizations. ‚ú¶

New Brunswick gets Ô¨Çowing oil discovery
Corridor Resources Inc., Halifax, NS, plans to appraise an oil
discovery 3 km southeast of its McCully gas field in southern New
Brunswick.
The South Branch G-36 well flowed clean, 45¬∞ gravity oil at the
rate of 59 b/d without water through production tubing after 10
days‚Äô clean-up of frac fluid.
Producing interval is the Hiram Brook member of the Mississippian Albert formation at 1,574-1,612 m. The frac job placed
30 tonnes of proppant before being prematurely ended due to a
frozen water line, which Corridor said may have reduced the frac‚Äôs
effectiveness. A pump will be installed for long-term test.
Corridor also ran a frac in Hiram Brook at 1,757-1,840.5 m,
resulting in a show of oil and no measurable gas. This interval is
considered tight, but another 31 m of potential oil pay previously
reported as gas pay in the Upper Hiram Brook have not yet been
completed.
TD is 2,642 m, nearly 500 m into the Fredrick Brook shale.
The well is on the southern flank of the Elgin subbasin, where
Corridor recently completed a $2.5 million 3D seismic program
around the well.
After interpreting the new seismic, the company will drill an
offset in early 2009 to G-36, named Caledonia field in recognition of the southern bounding basement rocks of the Caledonia
highlands.
Meanwhile, Corridor expects to achieve 2008 yearend production of 35-40 MMscfd of gas from McCully field depending on
results of clean-up at the J-47 well and the outcome of a multistage
frac at the I-47 horizontal well.
In the Elgin area 20 km east of McCully field, Corridor has
drilled Green Road G-41 to 1,118 m and run intermediate casing before deepening to core and run two fracs in the Frederick
Brook shale. It is drilling Mapleton N-11 to core a full section of
the shale.

Total makes oil Ô¨Ånd off Congo (Brazzaville)
Total SA tested 3,000 b/d of 18¬∞ gravity oil from its Moho Marine Nord-3 appraisal well, which was drilled 80 km off Congo

Total said the oil well produced from a 60 m column of goodquality Upper Miocene sands. The well reached 2,300 m TD in
1,030 m of water.
The discovery confirms the Tertiary Miocene resource cluster in

CNPC signs framework agreement with Cuba
China National Petroleum Corp., eyeing competition from a
variety of other nations, has signed a framework agreement with
Cuba‚Äôs state-owned Cubapetroleo SA (Cupet) on expanded cooperation in oil and gas development.
The agreement, signed by CNPC Vice-Pres. Wang Dongjin and
Cupet Pres. Fidel Rivero Prieto, involves the provision of engineering and technical services along with related equipment for oil and
gas field development.
The agreement with CNPC is the latest in Cuba‚Äôs efforts to create
interest in the development of its offshore oil reserves, which the
Cuban government recently estimated at some 20 billion bbl of oil
in its portion of the Gulf of Mexico.
Cuba‚Äôs estimate is considerably higher than the recent US Geological Survey‚Äôs estimate of up to 9 billion bbl of oil reserves, but
Cupet officials claim their data is more reliable.
‚ÄúWe have more data. I‚Äôm almost certain that if [the USGS] asks
for all the data we have, [its estimate] is going to grow considerably,‚Äù Cupet Exploration Manager Rafael Tenreyro Perez said in
October.
Tenreyro said Cupet‚Äôs estimate was based largely on a comparison with oil production from similar geological structures in the
US and Mexican areas of the Gulf of Mexico.
Cuba‚Äôs offshore geology is similar to that of Mexico‚Äôs giant Cantarell oil field in the Bay of Campeche, Tenreyo said.
Industry observers have cast doubt on the Cubans‚Äô claims, saying they would like to see the findings verified by independent
experts. Still, a number of oil companies have expressed interest in
exploring Cuban waters.
Last month, Russia‚Äôs ambassador to Cuba, Mijail Kamynin,
speaking ahead of a visit by Russian President Dmitri Medvedev on
Nov. 27, said that Russian oil companies could soon begin exploring for oil off Cuba.
Kamynin, who said Russian oil companies have ‚Äúconcrete projects‚Äù for drilling off Cuba, added that Russian firms also would like
to help build storage tanks for crude oil, modernize pipelines, and
help with Venezuelan efforts to refurbish the Soviet-built Cienfuegos refinery.
In October, Brazil‚Äôs Petroleo Brasileiro SA, building on agreements signed with Cuba earlier this year, announced plans to explore Block 37 in the Florida Straits, in 500-1,600 m of water
between Havana and Matanzas and 90-95 miles south of Key West,
Fla. (OGJ Online, Oct. 31, 2008). ‚ú¶

Shell sets record with Perdido completion
Shell Oil Co. has set a world water depth record in drilling and
completing a subsea well 9,356 ft below the water‚Äôs surface.
The SA001 well was drilled to 16,300 ft TD in Silvertip field at
the Perdido regional development project, 200 miles from Houston. Silvertip field is on Alaminos Canyon Block 815 in OCS lease
G19409 in the Gulf of Mexico (see map, OGJ, Sept. 8, 2008, p.
35).
The Noble Clyde Boudreaux double-derrick, dual-activity semisubmersible drilled and completed the record well. The semisub
used 16 mooring lines on this project.
As an oil well, the Silvertip record is 35% deeper than the previous oil well record of 6,950 ft, also set by Shell in Fourier field in
the gulf.
At Perdido, Shell intends to drill an even deeper well in Tobago
field at 9,627 ft on Alaminos Canyon Block 859. Shell operates Perdido on behalf of partners Chevron Corp. and BP PLC.
Shell and its partners will drill 35 wells at Perdido‚Äî22 direct
vertical access and 13 remote‚Äîin the Great White, Tobago, and
Silvertip fields in Alaminos Canyon.
Moored in 8,000 ft of water, the drilling and production facility will be the deepest in the world. Nine polyester mooring lines
averaging more than 2 miles in length now hold the spar in place.
The floating structure will weigh 50,000 tons and will be nearly as
tall as the Eiffel Tower when fully operational.
First production from Perdido is expected in early 2010, with
the facility capable of handling 130,000 boe/d.

topside production facilities to Okha.
The JV also will refurbish the existing riser turret mooring system and selected subsea facilities.
The aim is to produce additional oil from the region by extending the life of the four existing fields‚Äîabout 135 km northwest of
Karratha off Western Australia in 75-135 m of water‚Äîand adding
production from nearby yet-to-be-drilled exploration prospects.
The timetable calls for the facilities to be completed and fully
operational by early 2011.
Cossack and Wanaea came on stream in 1995, while Lambert
and Hermes were later additions. Total production is just under
400 million bbl.
The JV‚ÄîWoodside 33.33%, BHP Billiton 16.67%, BP Developments Australia 16.67%, Chevron Australia 16.67%, and Japan
Australia LNG (MIMI) 16.67%‚Äîanticipates that the refurbishment
will generate more than 60 million bbl of oil.

Horizon conÔ¨Årms Maari budget increase
Horizon Oil Ltd., Sydney, a minority interest holder in the Maari
oil field development off New Zealand‚Äôs Taranaki basin, has confirmed another 18% capital expenditure increase for the project,
which now stands at $600 million. This latest cost blowout is due
primarily to a 3-month delay in the start of development drilling.
At the final investment decision for Maari in late 2005, expected
outlays were pegged at $365 million. In April, that figure rose to
$508 million. The latest estimate is further, although anticipated,
bad news for the development consortium, which is led by OMV
of Austria.
Horizon also lowered its expectation of revenue from the project in the initial years following the fall in world oil prices. The
company said if the $50-55/bbl prices continue, project returns
will likely be about $540 million in the first year and $1.31 billion
over 4 years.
Oil production is now expected to begin in February 2009 and
to rise to 35,000 b/d by August 2009.
The field has estimated reserves of 68 million boe. The nearby,
yet-to-be-drilled Manaia structure has potential for a further 25
million boe.
Interest holders in the Maari mining license (PMP 38160) and
the Manaia exploration license (PEP 38413) are OMV 69%, Todd
Energy 16%, Horizon 10%, and Cue Energy Resources 5%.

PT Chevron Pacific Indonesia reported start of oil production
Nov. 14 from Area 12 of Indonesia‚Äôs North Duri field, where Chevron produces nearly half the nation‚Äôs oil.
Oil production from Area 12 is expected to rise to 34,000 b/d
by 2012, Chevron said. Initial production from Area 12 will increase with the application of steamflood technology next year, the
company said.
Area 12 represents the latest expansion of Duri field, which is
the largest producing field Chevron operates in Indonesia and one
of the world‚Äôs largest steamflood projects. The field, which was
discovered in 1941 on the island of Sumatra, currently produces
200,000 b/d of oil.

PDVSA: Ecuadorian reÔ¨Ånery still ‚Äòon track‚Äô
Venezuela‚Äôs state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA),
contradicting earlier remarks by a senior company official, has no
plans to change its schedule for the construction of a refinery in
Ecuador.
The statement, issued by the Ecuadorian oil and mines ministry,
followed a meeting between Ecuadorian oil minister Derlis Palacios
and Venezuelan energy and oil minister Rafael Ramirez, who confirmed his country‚Äôs commitment to execute the project.
Work on the joint-stock Refineria del Pacifico, held 51% by Ecuador‚Äôs state-owned Petroecuador and 49% by PDVSA, is scheduled
to start in 2010, and operations are expected to begin by 2013.
The Ecuadorian statement followed media reports concerning
a revision of the projected investments of PDVSA abroad due to
the fall of international oil prices. The media reports specifically
mentioned the refinery project in Ecuador and another one in Nicaragua.
Elogio Del Pino, a PDVSA vice-president, told the Venezuelan
newspaper El Nacional, in comments published on Nov. 29, that
PDVSA would reevaluate funding for some international projects,
while its investment in the domestic oil industry would remain
unchanged.
‚ÄúThe idea is to maintain investment in the country, because our

entire field, owns a 90 sq mile 3D seismic survey. The company
believes the field has at least 50 proved developed workover or
recompletion opportunities in 37 wellbores and one proved undeveloped drilling opportunity. ‚ú¶

idea is to have between 300,000 and 400,000 b/d (of oil) of potential so that when the rebound in oil prices comes‚Ä¶we can then
open up that production,‚Äù Del Pino told El Nacional.
‚ÄúInternational investments like the refineries in Ecuador and Nicaragua are under evaluation,‚Äù Del Pino said, adding that, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre
asking to look for financing‚Äù to help pay for the 300,000 b/d refinery in Ecuador and the 150,000 b/d facility in Nicaragua.
Nicaraguan officials issued no comment concerning Del Pino‚Äôs
remarks about the planned facility in their country. But his statement about the need for additional financing was in line with earlier remarks by officials involved in the Ecuadorian project.
In September, reports said that PDVSA and Petroecuador would
jointly finance just under one third of the estimated $6-10 billion cost of the Ecuadorian refinery, expecting that the outstanding
amount would be financed by other countries.
Carlos Albuja, head of Petroecuador unit Petroindustrial, said the
two state firms would ‚Äúfinance 30% of the cost,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúCountries such as England and China, among others, are interested in
financing the remainder.‚Äù Since then, a memorandum of understanding has been forged between Iran and Ecuador for the revamp
and modernization of Ecuador‚Äôs refineries. Under the MOU, a refinery will be constructed, to be cofinanced by Iran, Ecuador, and
Venezuela (OGJ Online, Sept. 22, 2008). ‚ú¶

Shell to supply PetroChina with LNG
Shell Eastern LNG has agreed to sell as much as 2 million
tonnes/year of LNG to PetroChina International under a 20-year
supply agreement.
Shell said LNG supplies will come from various company projects, including Western Australia‚Äôs Gorgon gas project, in which it
holds 25% interest.
Shell did not outline when deliveries of supplies would begin
or detail any other projects that might provide supplies.
The current agreement builds on one signed in November 2007
under which Shell was to supply 1 million tonnes/year of LNG
to PetroChina, which is building three regasification facilities on
China‚Äôs Pacific seaboard: one in Jiangsu province, one in Dalian
city, and a third in Tangshen city.
According to analyst BMI, PetroChina‚Äôs decision to double the
volume under the final contract demonstrates the Chinese firm‚Äôs
confidence in ongoing strong demand for LNG in China.
In addition, the analyst said, the increased supply may reflect
PetroChina‚Äôs desire to source more long-term LNG supply contracts from Asia Pacific as a less risky strategy than boosting LNG
imports from the Middle East, ‚Äúparticularly as the upsurge in piracy increases transit risks and shipping costs along the route.‚Äù

Earlier this month, China and Myanmar signed an agreement
for the supply of gas that also came amid growing concerns about
the safety of shipping through the Malacca Strait, especially following the rise of hijackings and attacks on oil tankers by Somali
pirates operating in and around the Gulf of Aden (OGJ Online,
Nov. 20, 2008).

Woodside lets contract for Pluto LNG project
Woodside Petroleum Ltd. has awarded service contracts totalling $5.2 million (Aus.) to Finnish consulting and engineering
firm Poyry for the Pluto LNG project off Western Australia.
The awards cover the concept phase of different development
options for the proposed second LNG train for Pluto.
Poyry says the long tie-back from the offshore field to the plant
on the Burrup Peninsula means that flow assurance studies for
Pluto are vital to ensure there is an acceptable fluid flow under all
operating conditions.
The studies in the contract include an evaluation of the thermal
and hydraulic performance of the Pluto production system from
the undersea reservoir through 27 km of subsea flowlines to the
production platform and then along 180 km of subsea trunkline to
the onshore Burrup plant. ‚ú¶

Response to responses

______________

14

You have published two responses in
recent Journals to my letter on global
warming (OGJ, July 7, 2008, p. 12).
One is from Donald E. Hibbard (OGJ,
Oct. 6, 2008, p. 14). The other is from
David Archibald (Oct. 27, 2008, p. 12).
You also published a letter from Gerald
Westbrook that did not respond directly
to my letter (OGJ, Nov. 3, 2008, p. 12). I
would in turn like to comment on these
three letters.
There is no doubt that the debate over
the existence of global warming gets
emotional as it touches the heart of our
business. It is my contention, however,
that these above communications are
clouding the debate, not being based on
sound science.
Let us take Mr. Hibbard‚Äôs letter first.
His sole argument was, ‚ÄúAn article by
Arthur B. Robinson, Noah E. Robinson, and Willie Soon published in the
December 2007 Journal of American
Physicians and Surgeons reports research
that strongly rejects the theory that hydrocarbons are primarily responsible for
global warming. Their research is backed
by the endorsement of 31,072 American
scientists.‚Äù
The referred article originates from
the Oregon Institute of Science and
Medicine. I looked them up on the web.
The Chemical & Engineering News, in
their editorial of June 9, 2008, refused
to carry a letter which quoted this same
reference published in the Journal of
American Physicians and Surgeons.1 The
editorial said that this journal ‚Äúis not
indexed by Chemical Abstracts Service,
Pubmed, or ISI‚Äôs Web of Science, and
articles published in this journal have
argued that the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services are unconstitutional,
that ‚Äòhumanists‚Äô have conspired to replace the ‚Äòcreation religion of Jehovah‚Äô
with evolution, that HIV does not cause
AIDS, and that the ‚Äògay male lifestyle‚Äô
shortens life expectancy by 20 years,
etc.‚Äù
The only reference of the institute‚Äôs
work on climate change on their web
site is to this paper and a petition. The
paper itself is full of errors, cherry-pick-

Master of Science in
ing of data, and omissions. I invite readers to make their own judgment by reading
the review by Michael MacCracken, past-president of the International Association
of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences.2
On their web site this institute lists just eight faculty members (of whom two
are dead), no classrooms, or student body. As concerns the petition, despite being
frequently cited by global warming critics as showing that thousands of scientists
disagree with the consensus on global warming, it contains almost no people with
relevant expertise, and its vetting was so lax that it included many fictional signatories.
Now for Mr. Archibald‚Äôs letter. I note that he did not counter the points I raised
in my previous letter concerning his cherry-picking of data in his work nor to his
abuse of the climate change model. I took a look at the most recent reference supplied with his letter, from March 2008.3 In this 30-page paper he gives no references to the majority of his data, which is a good thing for him since examination
shows he has cherry-picked to the extreme again. The first figure, which is claimed
to be ‚ÄúThe 29 years of high quality Satellite Data,‚Äù does not say which satellite; the
vertical axis is missing a label; and the title does not match the data, while the next
graph shows sea ice, with no source reference, but while claiming that no changes
are happening is mislabeled, while it does indeed show a trend. In the third figure
we see data for five rural sites around Georgia. Archibald then asserts, without any
attempt at proof, that the variation seen is due to solar effects and then suddenly
jumps his conclusion from these five stations to cover the whole of planet Earth!
These five stations are all in a small region, while there were hundreds of stations
available. Guess what? They all show the same trend down. The possibility that
these five stations were representative is so small to be insignificant, and yet from
this Archibald draws one of his major conclusions. I am only up to Fig. 3 and could
go on, but I will save readers the pain. This non-peer reviewed article does not
qualify as science.
The last letter was from Mr. Westbrook. He started by asking what three distinguished physicists have in common and tells us that they are all sceptics of global
warming (note the ‚Äúare,‚Äù as if in the present; one of them is dead), while ignoring the many thousands of physicists who accept global warming as a reality. In
fact, none of the three named have ever authored a testable theory, produced data,
or presented papers explaining the current global temperature trend. Mr. Westbrook denigrates the 0.6¬∫ C. temperature increase seen in the 20th century and in
doing this shows he does not understand climate science since small changes in
mean global surface temperature do indeed matter, and this temperature increase
is continuing. He says that increasing CO2 levels help plant growth, but he ignores
the hundreds of millions of people who will be affected by rising sea levels [as
though] sudden changes to habitat will have many knock-on consequences. Mr.
Westbrook says, ‚ÄúPhysicists might hold the key to this diagnosis,‚Äù and he then
places the blame fairly on solar warming (ignoring the massive evidence from the
increase in CO2 levels and the known physics). Direct observations tell us that solar
forcing has not changed substantially in at least 30 years, and important though
it is, physics without an understanding of climate science is pretty worthless in a
debate over the climate. His letter also includes a number of political points, which
should have no place in a debate over science.
Debate is at the heart of science. None of the aforementioned pieces stands up
to independent review. Reading the letters column of OGJ, one could easily get
the impression that the debate has not reached a conclusion on whether we have
climate change or not and the reasons for it. The science, as well as the empirical
results, are all now well-established and recognized.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which produced the definitive
work on climate change, has now produced a number of reports. Although much
maligned by the skeptics, the process the IPCC goes through is highly scientific,
contains much advanced statistical analysis, and many checks and balances. The
rules are that the work may present only previously published research, based on

reports are essential reading for those interested in climate change.4 No one else
has come up with a scientifically credible
reason (i.e., passes the test under peer
analysis and review) to explain away the
changes happening to our climate.

The conversion is a two-step process whereby the first step is to convert

atom of oxygen to a molecule of methane, and the second step is conversion
of methanol to gasoline. Although Step

than the first, it is not because of an accidental discovery.

Obama and climate change
The problem with being president of the
United States is that the holder of the office must
balance priorities, make ultimate compromises,
and still lead. No president gets it all right. So
here‚Äôs a tip for President-elect Barack Obama: Keep
the nation engaged by respecting dissent.
Obama made a video address to the Bipartisan
Governors Climate Summit in Los Angeles this
month that sounded like a harangue from the back
benches of the Senate‚Äôs liberal wing. ‚ÄúFew challenges
facing America‚Äîand the world‚Äîare more urgent
than combating climate change,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe science is beyond dispute, and the facts are clear.‚Äù

This is from someone who believes the uncertainty ‚Äúshould make us even more cautious about
disturbing the system.‚Äù
To brush aside the uncertainty and rush into
expensive climate remedies offering limited hope
for warming mitigation would be historically
irresponsible, especially now. Obama will inherit
a calamitous economy. The aggressive cap-andtrade program he espouses would be extremely
costly. The ‚Äúgreen‚Äù jobs he promises wouldn‚Äôt
replace jobs lost to the economic problems his
program would create. He must broaden his view
of the climate-change issue and its relationship to
economic health. He‚Äôs not a junior senator from

In the coming decades, demand
for energy in the world will increase
significantly, while access to ‚Äúeasy oil‚Äù
will become more difficult, and the
threats of global warming will continue
to grow. Given this reality and the mobility challenge linked to this, energy
companies are looking at solutions that
go beyond fossil fuels.
While petroleum will remain a primary energy source well into
this century, alternatives will
also play an important role.
The solution to our energy
crisis is not a silver bullet but
a mosaic. One of the pieces
will be biofuels, which are
already being blended into
gasoline and diesel in many countries.
As the largest distributor of biofuels in
the world, Royal Dutch Shell is actively
involved in this industry, seeing the
production and distribution of firstgeneration biofuels as a bridge to the
development and commercialization of
the next generation. Shell is also investing heavily in the research and develop-

ment of ‚Äúnext-generation‚Äù biofuels that
are derived from nonfood crops such as
wood chips and wheat straw.
Hydrogen is another alternative
source of energy that Shell is developing. Automakers are under intense
pressure to come up with vehicles that
run on clean, abundant, and convenient
26

fuels. Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) powered
by hydrogen are getting a lot of attention. FCVs give off just water vapor and
heat so local emissions produced by the
vehicles are zero.
Although hydrogen could occupy
an important share of the energy mix,
it will need to be used alongside other
sources of fuels: again, the mosaic. This
will include conventional fuels such
as diesel and gasoline, biofuels of all
kinds, and the increasing availability of
electric vehicles.

Shell‚Äôs hydrogen strategy
Based on the current development
plans of automobile manufacturers,
Shell estimates that the commercialization of hydrogen FCVs could start as
early as 2020. However, a great deal
will depend on market demand and
overcoming a number of technological,
financial, and political obstacles.
Shell has developed a clear strategy
to provide infrastructure that addresses
these challenges and since 1999 has
been working closely with the automotive industry, local and national governments, academics, and NGOs to create
the infrastructure necessary to bring
hydrogen into a retail setting as a fuel.
To be able to market hydrogen
within the foreseeable future, Shell is
operating along two channels. First,
broadening our own expertise in order
to provide hydrogen infrastructure
and second, building public awareness
around subjects such as usability and
safety with hydrogen fuel demonstration projects around the world.
Shell‚Äôs retail demonstration projects have been developed in all three
major hydrogen markets‚ÄîAsia, North
America, and Europe (Tokyo, Reykjavik, Shanghai, and the US cities of
Washington, DC, White Plains, NY, and
Los Angeles). They include building
new hydrogen fuel stations or adapting existing locations for that purpose.
A number of supply options have been
tested, including liquid hydrogen, compressed gaseous hydrogen by trailer,
and on site production through electrolysis and steam methane reforming.

rates fell from peak levels reached in the
third quarter of 2004. However, CGES
analysts said the recent slowdown has
been more protracted, extending from a
month-on-month decline in production
to the first year-on-year drop since the
revival of the Russian oil industry in the
late 1990s.

The Russian government expects its
total 2008 oil production to be up 1%
(4.9 million tonnes) above last year‚Äôs
491 million tonnes total. ‚ÄúIt will be
helped, of course, by the extra day this
year, which is worth an additional 1.34
million tonnes of oil at the current
average rate of production. Were this

rate to be maintained for the rest of the
year, aggregate oil production for 2008
would be just short of 489 million
tonnes, 2.2 million tonnes down on last
year‚Äôs level,‚Äù said CGES analysts. However, they said prospects for a surge in
Russian output in the last quarter of this
year are mixed. ‚ú¶

WoodMac: Natural gas to trade at $5-6/MMbtu to 2013
US natural gas is expected to trade at
$5-6/MMbtu over the next 5 years, said
an executive of Wood Mackenzie Ltd.,
Edinburgh, at a recent energy forum
sponsored by that firm in Houston.
Jen Snyder, head of WoodMac North
American Gas Research, told forum
participants that the industry‚Äôs successful development of shale gas plays has
positioned the market for ‚Äúsignificant
potential over-supply.‚Äù Snyder rejects
a popular theory that gas prices will
settle eventually at the marginal cost
of the most expensive shale plays. That
represents ‚Äúa mistaken reading of the
current and future environment,‚Äù she
said. ‚ÄúSimply stated, there is no requirement for the rapid near-to-midterm
development of some of the more
expensive or challenging shales such as
the Marcellus or Horn River; the market
can be adequately supplied without
these volumes.‚Äù
She sees ‚Äúsufficient volumes available
at a development break-even price of
$5.50/MMbtu or below.‚Äù That conclu-

sion is based on declining demand
due to ‚Äúa prolonged recession‚Äù to
fourth-quarter 2010, new wind and
coal-fired capacity coming online to
generate electricity, and ‚Äúa significant
drop in drilling activity‚Äù because of
a lower commodity price. ‚ÄúWe have
also factored in the positive impact on
break-even costs due to cost reductions
associated with this drilling slow-down
and continued optimization of drilling solutions at those plays that will
continue to be aggressively developed,‚Äù
Snyder said.
Furthermore, she said, ‚ÄúThe results
of our Global Gas Optimization Model
point to significant import volumes of
LNG over the next few years, despite
the recent growth in unconventionals.‚Äù
Existing offtake agreements for some
suppliers ‚Äúmake diversions from North
America unlikely,‚Äù Snyder said. ‚ÄúIn
addition, other suppliers with flexible
LNG will want to avoid jeopardizing
long-term contract prices in Europe and

Asia, through a further weakening of
spot prices in these areas.‚Äù Qatar in particular will likely direct some of its new
LNG volumes to the US market ‚Äúwhere
there are no long-term contract implications and a large and liquid market to
absorb the volumes,‚Äù Snyder said.
WoodMac‚Äôs projected gas price of
$5-6/MMbtu would not be a floor
price, as near-term market weakness
could force prices below that range,
Snyder said.
‚ÄúOur near-term forecast is predicated
on a normal winter. While a severe
winter could tighten up the market
and provide some near-term support,
equally a mild winter could exacerbate
the current position of over-supply
and lead to prices into the $4/MMbtu
range in the near term,‚Äù Snyder added.
‚ÄúWe have also assumed that gas demand
benefits from a 1.5 bcfd switch from
coal to gas-fired power generation. If
this fails to materialize due to collapsing
coal prices, this would further add to
short-term price weakness.‚Äù ‚ú¶

OPEC price up 24%
In the second quarter of 2008, BMI
estimates that the OPEC basket price averaged just under $115/bbl‚Äîup about
24% from the first quarter level. The
OPEC basket price exceeded $127 on
May 22, slipping back towards $121/
bbl later in the month.
In June, BMI assumed an average
of about $120 to deliver its quarterly
estimate of $114.98/bbl. The estimated
second-quarter 2008 average prices
for the main marker blends are now
$118.63 for Brent, $119.61 for WTI,
and $115.89/bbl for Russian Urals
(Mediterranean delivery).
‚ÄúOur projections for 2008 as a
whole have been revised upwards from
the last quarterly report,‚Äù the analyst
said, adding, ‚ÄúWe are now assuming
an OPEC basket price average of $106/
bbl for 2008, compared with the $81
estimate provided by our last quarterly
report.‚Äù
Based on recent price differentials,
this implies Brent at $109.71, WTI
averaging $110.64/bbl, and Urals at
$106.88/bbl.
Libyan real gross domestic product
growth is now forecast by BMI at 7%
for 2008, following 5.6% in 2007. The
analyst is assuming 6.6% growth in
2009, followed by 6.8% in 2010-12.

Oil demand to rise
BMI expects oil demand to rise to
302,000 b/d in 2012 from 260,000
b/d in 2007, representing 3% annual
growth. Libya‚Äôs state-owned National
Oil Corp. in 2006 accounted for 45% of
oil production and all gas production,
but it has a growing number of international oil company partners contributing to a forecast rise in oil production
to 2.20 million b/d by 2012 from 1.85
million b/d in 2007.

Cairn Energy PLC plans to delay
oil and gas exploration activity in the
Mediterranean for a year to focus on
operations in India, Greenland, and
other areas.
Two Mediterranean wells Cairn
had planned in the next 12 months
will be deferred until 2010, says
Cairn exploration chief, Mike Watts.
The deferral is partly because
Cairn, which has exploration licenses
in Tunisian waters, didn‚Äôt like the
prices it was offered for drilling rigs,
and wanted to focus efforts on other
areas.
In India, Cairn is leading a development to export oil from several
fields in Rajasthan, which will start
up next year and are expected to
reach plateau production of 175,000
b/d of oil.

‚ÄúThere are many technical,
operational, and environmental
challenges ahead, yet the available
evidence suggests that the offshore
contains the geological ingredients
necessary for finding hydrocarbons,‚Äù Watt said.
‚ÄúIn essence,‚Äù said Watt, ‚Äúwe are
here today because we both recognize and believe in the potential of
Greenland, and Cairn wants to play

Watt is not alone in his thinking, as voters in Greenland recently

includes national ownership of the

tious volume goals that may be frustrated by OPEC quota policy,‚Äù BMI said.
Libya‚Äôs gas production should reach
32 bcm by 2012, up from 15.2 bcm in
2007, while its consumption is expected to rise to 7.3 bcm by the end of the
forecast period, from 6.3 bcm, allowing
exports of 24.7 bcm.
During 2007-18, BMI is forecasting
an increase in Libyan oil and gas liquids
production of 40.7%, with volumes
rising steadily to 2.6 million b/d by the
end of the 10-year forecast period.
Oil consumption during 2007-18 is
set to increase by 46.7%, with growth
slowing to an assumed 4%/year towards the end of the period and the
country using 382,000 b/d by 2018.
Gas production is expected to rise to
60 bcm by the end of the period. With
demand rising by almost 47% during
2007-18, there should be export potential increasing to about 51 bcm, via

BLM Utah head defers
leases in response
to NPS concerns
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US Bureau of Land Management
Utah State Director Selma Sierra agreed
on Nov. 25 to defer from a Dec. 19 oil
and gas lease sale all parcels of concern
to the US National Park Service (NPS)
following 2 days of discussions between
the agencies.
NPS Intermountain Regional Director Rick Snyder expressed concern to Sierra in October about lease parcels near
Arches and Canyonlands national parks
in southeastern Utah and Dinosaur
National Monument in eastern Utah.
Snyder, who is based in Denver, flew to
Salt Lake City on Nov. 24 as representatives of the two US Department of the
Interior agencies held their discussions.
The two agencies also agreed to
renew their 1993 memorandum of

understanding regarding how BLM‚Äôs
Utah offices and NPS will work together
on prospective oil and gas lease offerings, Sierra said in an announcement
issued in Salt Lake City. BLM and NPS
are developing a draft of the renewed
agreement, she said.
‚ÄúThis constructive dialogue between
our agencies has resulted in a positive
outcome. Ongoing discussions with
[NPS] will continue to strengthen our
collaboration and coordination. This is
important for two sister agencies with
environmental stewardship missions,‚Äù
Sierra said. The agencies were able to
reach an agreement despite having different land stewardship approaches, she
said. BLM has a complex multiple use
mission while NPS strives to preserve
unimpaired national parks‚Äô natural and
cultural resources, the Utah BLM director observed.

‚ÄòThe process worked‚Äô
‚ÄúI recognize that NPS had requested

that I defer the parcels the day they
were posted, but I wanted to have the
opportunity to engage in dialogue to
discuss the newly approved resource
management plans and the much
stricter environmental protections included in our decisions before making
an arbitrary decision to defer parcels.
Moreover, the process we are currently
following allows for dialogue and I
believe in our case, the process worked
as intended,‚Äù she said in a Nov. 25 letter
to Snyder.
Sierra said she also would consult
with other partners which BLM works
with regularly. ‚ÄúAs you know, based on
BLM‚Äôs regulatory requirements, we also
maintain a consulting agency relationship with state and county agencies
directly affected by land management
decisions on public land. These state
and county officials also participated in
formulating the resource management
plans on which leasing decisions are
based and they have invested much time

and effort in the decisions these documents represent,‚Äù she told Snyder.
Environmental organizations in the
region said on Nov. 26 that NPS actually
is being forced to accept leasing on land
that the agency contends will damage
the parks‚Äô air and water, and compromise the parks‚Äô ‚Äúnatural quiet.‚Äù
Stephen Bloch, conservation director for the Southern Utah Wilderness
Alliance in Salt Lake City, said, ‚ÄúDespite
public protests and the concerns of its
own park service, the outgoing Bush
administration is using this sale to push
its extreme drill everywhere agenda,
and America‚Äôs national parks and other
spectacular public lands will be the
worse for it.‚Äù
Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and seven
other US senators urged US Interior
Secretary Dirk A. Kempthorne on Nov.
25 to postpone the lease sale because
NPS and other stakeholders were not
given enough time initially to outline
their concerns. ‚ú¶

Saudi Aramco delays fourth development project
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Saudi Aramco, continuing to review
and delay development projects in
the light of the global financial crisis,
has cancelled plans for a $1.2 billion
project to restart production from its
historic Dammam oil field.
‚ÄúWe were told it is not a priority
in the current environment,‚Äù said one
international contracting executive,
who added that, ‚ÄúIt has been cancelled
for the time being but may be looked at
again in the future.‚Äù
Apart from general financial considerations, Dammam oil field development project was considered to be
especially expensive due to its location
under the highly populated city of
Dhahran, which added environmental
and safety concerns.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure also that due to the area

being populated, the cost for redevelopment was excessive,‚Äù said another
industry source, who noted that the
project could be rebid at a later date.
Oil was first discovered in Saudi
Arabia in 1938 at what is now known
as the Prosperity well in Dammam field.
The field has never produced more than
10,000 b/d of oil.
However, following recent seismic
studies lasting 18 months, Aramco
had been looking to produce 100,000
b/d of oil and 100 MMcfd of gas from
Dammam field, possibly by yearend
2012.
Industry sources said the project involved drilling at least two new production wells along with water injection
facilities and laying 100 km of pipeline.
Aramco had invited companies to
express their interest in a front-end
engineering and design study to be
awarded in early 2009.

The study was expected to take 9
months and construction 3 years, putting startup in late 2012 or early 2013,
at the earliest.
Contractors were expected to bid
for a contract to perform the feasibility
study, but after a number of contractors
prequalified, Aramco told interested
companies it had cancelled the bidding
process.
It did not say which firms had
prequalified, but most major contracting firms, including France‚Äôs Technip,
Foster Wheeler and Fluor of the US, and
Canada‚Äôs SNC Lavalin, were expected to
bid for the contract.
Aramco has chosen to delay several
other projects in the wake of the global
financial problems: the 400,000 b/d
Yanbu refinery, the 900,000 b/d Manifa
oil field development, and the 400,000
b/d refinery project at Jubail. ‚ú¶

US, Canadian producers post strong 3Q results
Marilyn Radler

Laura Bell
Statistics Editor
Record oil prices in July and strong
refining margins in September resulted
in a surge in earnings for a group of
US-based oil and gas producers and refiners for the third quarter of this year.
The sample of companies recorded
a combined 103% spike in earnings for
the period.
For the first 9 months, the group‚Äôs
collective profits climbed 39%.
OGJ also looked at a sample of producers and pipeliners based in Canada.

third-quarter 2007.
Most of the independent producers
as well as the integrated firms posted
improved results in the recent quarter
compared with a year earlier. Only 9
of the companies in the sample of 77
US operators recorded a net loss for the
most recent quarter.
ExxonMobil Corp. reported record
earnings of $14.8 billion for the third
quarter on revenues of $137.7 billion.
The company‚Äôs upstream earnings, excluding the gain related to the sale of a
German natural gas transportation business, were $9.35 billion, up $3 billion
from third-quarter 2007.
Higher oil and gas realizations
increased earnings about $4.4 billion,
while lower sales volumes decreased
earnings about $1.3 billion. During the

third quarter, ExxonMobil‚Äôs total worldwide production declined 8% from the
third quarter of 2007.
As a result of higher margins,
ExxonMobil‚Äôs downstream earnings
of $3 billion were up $1 billion from
third-quarter 2007. Unfavorable foreign
exchange effects were a partial offset,
and product sales of 6.7 million b/d
were 413,000 b/d lower than in thirdquarter 2007, reflecting asset sales and
lower demand.
Chevron Corp. reported net income
of $7.9 billion for this year‚Äôs third quarter, compared with $3.7 billion a year
earlier, as upstream and downstream
earnings soared. Chemicals earnings
declined in the recent quarter.
While upstream earnings benefited
from much higher oil prices than dur-

ing the 2007 third quarter, earnings for
the most recent quarter were tempered
by the effects of hurricanes in the gulf
in September, Chevron said.
Like many of the independent producers in the sample, Petrohawk Energy
Corp. reported improved results for the
recent quarter. Petrohawk‚Äôs third-quarter earnings of $305.5 million were
up from $26.8 million a year earlier.
The company‚Äôs net gain on derivatives contracts was $388.2 million in
the recent quarter vs. $20.3 million in
third-quarter 2007.
Similarly, Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc.
reported a surge in earnings to $66.2
million from $4.2 million a year earlier,
mostly due to an $81.8 million markto-market gain on derivatives.
Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. posted $67

89% from a year earlier. The Houstonbased producer reported higher realized
prices and higher gas production levels.
Realized gas prices grew 27%, and
crude realizations increased 40% from
third-quarter 2007.

ReÔ¨Åners
For the first 9 months of this year,
most US refiners posted lower earnings

from a year earlier as a result of high
crude costs. For the most recent quarter,
the refiners in the sample posted varied
results.
Holly Corp. and Valero Energy Corp.
recorded lower net income compared
with third-quarter 2007, but Sunoco
Inc. and Tesoro Petroleum Corp. reported jumps in their earnings for the
same quarter vs. a year earlier.
Valero‚Äôs earnings declined 10% to

$1.15 billion in the recent quarter, as
the San Antonio-based refiner posted
$35.96 billion in revenues for the 3
months. This includes a pretax gain of
$305 million on the sale of the Krotz
Springs, La., refinery, which was effective July 1. Bill Klesse, Valero chairman
and chief executive officer, said conditions were volatile for third-quarter
product margins.

Klesse said, adding, ‚ÄúWhen the hurricanes hit the Gulf Coast and reduced
refinery production, gasoline inventories fell to historically low levels, and
margins responded, which increased
average margins for the third quarter.
In contrast to the volatile movement of
gasoline margins, distillate margins remained very good throughout the third
quarter as global supply and demand

Tullow Oil PLC (‚ÄúTullow‚Äù) said its
recent shallow-water Ebony discovery
in the Gulf of Guinea off Ghana could
be an indication of further prospectivity
in deeper water.
The UK company said the Ebony-1
exploration well on the 983 sq km Shallow Water Tano license intersected two
hydrocarbon bearing intervals in Late
Cretaceous turbidite sands.
Tullow said the Ebony discovery improves
its chance of success
at the large Tweneboa
downdip prospect to
the south (see map).
Meanwhile, Mitsui E&P Ghana Keta
Ltd. took a farmout from Afren Energy
(Ghana) Ltd. to earn a 20% stake in
the Keta Block in the Eastern basin off
Ghana.

Ghana‚Äôs latest discovery
hints at growing potential

Ebony discovery
Ebony-1 spudded on Oct. 22 and
reached a total depth of 2,640 m. The
well lies in the southwest part of the

Shallow Water Tano block in 86 m of
water and is the second commitment
well on this license.
Successful logging and sampling
operations confirmed a 4-m oil bearing interval at 2,053 m and a 2-m
high-pressure gas-condensate interval at
2,570 m.
Log and sample data from the highpressure gas-condensate sands and a
regional seismic interpretation indicate
there may be a connection between
these pinched-out sands and the material downdip Tweneboa oil prospect
which lies mainly in the Deepwater
Tano license. Other possible interpretations for the high-pressure cannot
however be excluded at this stage, and
this is subject to ongoing evaluation,
Tullow said.
Tullow with 31.5% interest operates the Shallow Water Tano license on
behalf of partners Interoil Exploration

National Petroleum Co. with a 10%
carried interest.
Tweneboa, a stratigraphic trap
prospect, is set for drilling in the first
quarter of 2009.
Espoir and Baobab fields off Ivory
Coast are in an Albian play. Off Ghana,
the Teak, Tweneboa, Onyina, Walnut,
and Banda prospects and the Ebony
and Odum discoveries are in a Campanian play. The Teak, Ntomme, Owo,
and Tweneboa prospects and Jubilee‚Äôs
Mahogany and Hyedua discoveries are
in a Turonian play.
The Odum discovery drilled in
February 2008 is considered commercial because it is 13 km from Jubilee.
Odum, in 955 m of water, went to
3,387 m and cut 22 m of net pay in a
60-m gross column of 29¬∞ gravity oil.
It opened a second new play fairway in
the Tano basin.

Jubilee development
Tullow plans to invest $3.2 billion
to develop nearby Jubilee field and
produce the first oil there in the second
half of 2010.
It intends to develop the field in
phases and supply the first associated
gas from Jubilee to Ghana in 2011.
Ghana has no onshore oil or gas infrastructure. Jubilee field is 9 hr by boat
and 45 min by helicopter from a supply
base being upgraded at Takoradi, Ghana,
which in turn is 4-5 hr by road from
the international airport at Accra.
Jubilee‚Äôs reservoir lies in 900-1,700
m of water and 2,100 m below the sea
bed. The field will be developed using a
subsea production and control system
tied back to a turret-moored floating
production, storage, and offloading
vessel.
The development plan is for 17 wells
with water injection from the start.
Besides its oily nature, Ghana‚Äôs
offshore has the potential to be a major
gas province, Tullow said.
The peak oil rate of 120,000 b/d of
oil is expected to yield 120 MMcfd of
gas. The produced gas volume is to be
split between reinjection and pipelining
to shore.

The gas is also expected to yield
3,000-5,000 b/d of natural gas liquids
in the first phase and 10,000-15,000
b/d of NGL in future phases.
A commercial discovery at Tweneboa
could confirm a new production hub
west of Jubilee field, Tullow indicated.
Tullow estimates 4 billion bbl of oil
and gas resources in the Gulf of Guinea
offshore Ghana and Ivory Coast.
Interest holders in 1,108 sq km
Deepwater Tano are Tullow, Anadarko
Petroleum Corp., Kosmos Energy Inc.,
GNPC, and Sabre. Kosmos operates
1,761 sq km West Cape Three Points on
behalf of itself and Anadarko, GNPC,
E.O. Group, and Sabre.

Eastern Ghana offshore
In the Keta basin off eastern Ghana,
Mitsui will share the cost of the Cuda1X exploration well spudded on Nov.
16.
It targets a prospect estimated large
enough to hold as much as 325-642
million bbl of oil. The play type is similar to the Jubilee and Odum discoveries that Tullow and Kosmos Energy are
developing.

‚ÄúThere are also a number of additional identified prospects, which
are currently in the process of being
assessed by the partners on the Keta
Block,‚Äù Afren said.
The consortium is using the Transocean Deepwater Discovery drillship to
target the Upper Cretaceous deepwater
sandstones in a combined structural and
stratigraphic trap. The vertical Cuda-1X
well will reach a TVD of 15,750 ft within 50 days, Afren said. Cuda-1X will be
drilled 5,577 ft of water. There are no
plans to perform drill stem testing on
the well. Ten wells have been drilled in
the Keta basin.
Osman Shahenshah, chief executive
of Afren, said: ‚ÄúFollowing the Jubilee
discoveries, Ghana is an emerging and
significant West African hydrocarbon
province. We‚Ä¶believe the block contains a number of exciting prospects.‚Äù
Once the deal is completed, Afren
will hold 68% interest, and other partners‚Äô shareholdings will be Mitsui 20%,
GNPC 10%, and Gulf Atlantic Energy
2%.
The transaction is subject to government approvals. ‚ú¶

Research sought on unconventional gas
Research Partnership to Secure Energy for America (RPSEA), Sugar Land,
Tex., has requested industry proposals for projects on gas shales, coalbed
methane water management, and tight
sands.
The full text of the RFPs is on the
RPSEA web site. The proposals are due
Jan. 12, 2009, for projects to start
around April 2009.
The focus of the gas shales proposal
is on the challenges associated with
development of the shale resource from
the Permian basin through the Fort
Worth basin and in southern Appalachian shale gas basins.
Concepts may include characterization of parameters that differentiate
high-performing wells and development of methods to assess production
potential, model production results,

delineate the fracture system, develop
extra-extended lateral drilling techniques, develop steerable hydraulic
fracs, and a host of other concepts.
Another request is for development
of tools, techniques, and methods to
greatly reduce the cost and environmental impact of CBM and shale gas
development through more effective
management of water used and produced in drilling, completion, stimulation, and production.
The tight sands solicitation seeks
proposals for development of tools,
techniques, and methods to increase
commercial production and ultimate
recovery from established tight gas sand
formations and accelerate development
of emerging and frontier tight gas plays.
This work is to be focused on the Rocky
Mountain region. ‚ú¶

Pennsylvania
Range Resources Corp., Fort Worth,
said seven wells totaling 30 MMcfd
from the Marcellus shale are connected
to Pennsylvania‚Äôs first large-scale gas
processing plant, operated by MarkWest
Energy Partners LP.
Range plans to begin flowing more
wells as two more gas processing plants
are completed next year (OGJ Online,
Oct. 22, 2008).
The company plans to enter 2009
with three horizontal rigs and boost
that to six by the end of the year. It expects yearend 2009 production to reach
a net 80-100 MMcfed.
Talisman Energy Inc., Calgary, deferred a five-well Marcellus shale pilot
in New York pending environmental
and regulatory reviews and shifted its
focus to Pennsylvania.
The company‚Äôs Fortuna Energy Inc.
unit holds almost 120,000 acres of
state controlled land in north-central
Pennsylvania and is drilling a pilot in
an area where it owns 19,200 net acres
prospective for development. It was
completing its first operated horizontal

100% working interest.
GMX is drilling the Bosh-11H and
Baldwin-17H wells and expects to
spud a fourth well within 2 weeks. The
next 16 wells are expected to average
3,800-ft laterls and 11-12 frac stages.
The company plans to drill 45 wells in
2009.
The Belin-1 well in the Hilltop area
of the deep Bossier play has the potential to be Gastar Exploration Ltd.‚Äôs best
well to date in terms of flow rate and
reserves, the company said.
Logs indicated 150 net ft of pay in
the middle and lower Bossier formations. TD is 18,800 ft.
The well‚Äôs three Lower Bossier pay
zones have the highest measured porosity, up to 25%, of any well drilled by
Gastar in the play.
Belin-1 also encountered two middle
Bossier sands, including the Lanier
sand, in a downdip location in a new
fault block with indicated pay based
on log analysis. The well, to be on line
within 30 days, is to be completed in
the two deepest zones first.
The Lanier sand has been shown to
be productive in a downthrown fault
block from the Wildman Trust-3 well,
where Lanier was recently recompleted
at an initial 21 MMcfd.

new and better method
for determining the reducer torque in a beam pumping unit.
The API recommended calculation
for determining torque,1 used for decades, has a 10% uncertainty. This precision has not prevented torque reducer
breakage.
The tested instrument measures
torque in the reducer shaft with a less
than 1% uncertainty, allowing effective control of torque. This torquemeter includes a strain gauge, electronic
transduction, telemetry, and LabView
software for transmitting the torque
signal from a remote unit, fixed in a
rotation shaft, to a base unit.
The wireless communication uses
the ZigBee standard, which is popular
in monitoring applications and industrial control.

Hundreds of experimental tests
showed that the system provided high
precision, low cost, strength, and high
noise immunity, even in environments
with strong vibration.

the world‚Äôs most used method for oil
extraction (80%

torque exceeds a certain value, it damages the gearbox whose price can equal
50% of the total cost of a mechanical
pumping unit (MPU), rendering it useless.3
Besides the high cost of the gearbox,
one also has to consider the lost production during the several days in may
take to replace the gearbox.

Among the various
ethane-recovery processes, the turboexpander
process is the most
widely used. Proponents
of the gas subcooled
Gas Processing
process (GSP), however,
claim it achieves higher
recovery than the conventional turboexpander process.
Several new
processes
based on
modifications to
the GSP
have appeared: cold residual recycle (CRR), IPSI
LLC‚Äôs Enhanced NGL Recovery, Fluor‚Äôs
Recycle Split Vapor (RSV), and RSV with
enrichment (RSVE).
This article presents results of a comparison of the two processes for ethane
recovery: the GSP and the conventional
turboexpander process. To perform a
fair comparison, we selected four different feeds, ranging from lean to rich
gas, with C2+ contents ranging 6-30%.
Also, comparing the two processes
using only one choice for the design
(also called ‚Äúdecision‚Äù) variables (i.e.,
those independent variables over which
the engineer has some control for each
process) does not yield a fair comparison.1 We therefore determined the

design variables for both processes and
changed them in order to achieve the
maximum ethane recovery for each
process.
We employed the HYSYS optimizer
tool for each level of the demethanizer
pressure. The results were confirmed
by sensitivity analysis. In it, the design
variables were changed manually in
each simulation run while covering
the entire range of allowable values in
the design variables to ensure that for
each process, the optimum reached is a
global one (‚Äúthe best for all allowable
values of the decision variables‚Äù) and
not only local (‚Äúa point from which
no small, allowable change in decision
variables in any direction will improve
the objective function‚Äù).1 The pressure
range in the demethanizer covers the
full typical range: 100 to 450 psia.
The results obtained show higher
ethane recovery with the GSP under two
conditions: lean feed and low demethanizer pressure. In all other cases, conventional turboexpansion yields either
higher or equivalent ethane recovery.
Choosing ethane recovery processes,
therefore, must be carefully considered.
Feed compositions and demethanizer
pressure can favor one process or the
other.

situation in which ‚Äúthe cold-fluid outlet
temperature‚Äù would be ‚Äúhigher than
that of the warm fluid‚Äù in these two
heat exchangers).2
In the gas subcooled process (Fig.
2), the gas undergoes cooling as in the
previous case, and after chilling and
separation, the entire gas stream does
not flow to a turboexpander. Rather,
it is split, with a portion condensed
and subcooled by the overhead stream
from the demethanizer then expanded
through a valve to provide a cold reflux
after feeding the column.
The design variables include those
mentioned for the conventional

turboexpander process as well as the
flow ratio in the splitter splitting the
gas stream leaving the separator and
sending a portion to the subcooler. The
constraints are the same as in the previous process.

For HYSYS simulation, we selected
the Peng-Robinson equation of state
as the thermodynamic model. After
ethane-recovery maximization for each
case, we compared results.
Figs. 3a to 3d show the maximum
percent C2 recoveries for the four feeds
(A to D) at four different demethanizer
pressures: 100, 215, 335, and 450 psia.

It is clear that the GSP provides higher
C2 recoveries in the cases 100 psia for
feeds A and B and at 215 psia for Case
A. Ethane recoveries are about the same
for the GSP and the conventional turboexpander process for Feed B at 215 psia.
The effect of pressure on the maximum ethane recovery appears in Figs.
4a to 4d for feeds A to D, respectively. As
expected, decreasing the demethanizer
pressure enhances C2 recovery for Feeds
A to D.
The trend for the variation of maximum C2 recovery with the demethanizer pressure depends on the feed
selected. For Feeds A and B, at low pressure, the GSP allows a higher maximum

recovery than that of the conventional
turboexpander process, whereas the
maximum ethane recovery with the GSP
is less at higher pressure.
For feeds C and D, the maximum
ethane recovery with the GSP is less
than for the conventional turboexpander process at all pressures.
Optimization results show that the
GSP provides higher maximum ethane
recoveries, provided that two conditions
are satisfied: The demethanizer pressure
is low and the feed gas is lean. In all the
other cases, the conventional turboexpander process provides a higher or an
equivalent maximum ethane recovery.
Simulation results show that the temperature of the feed gas after the first
heat exchange with the overhead stream
from the demethanizer does not affect
ethane recovery, which is expected since
the next cooling is by refrigeration that
brings the temperature to ‚Äì31¬∞ F. no
matter the temperature after cooling
with the overhead gas stream.
The second cooling with the overhead stream has an effect on ethane
recovery. A lower temperature enhances
condensation of ethane and ethane
recovery, which is expected. The maximum ethane recovery is obtained with
the lowest possible temperature without
temperature cross in the heat exchanger
in question. The HYSYS optimizer tool
confirms these results.

China‚Äôs push for
energy security has
prompted a program for
building 70 additional
very large crude carrier
(VLCC) tankers.
Tankers
The recent drop in
oil price reduces the
financial burden placed by oil imports
on Chinese industry, but ensuring
adequate supplies remains a concern for
the country. China is the world‚Äôs most
populous country and second largest
oil consumer and importer, just behind
the US. The Chinese economy relies
heavily on consuming natural resources,
including oil.
This article examines China‚Äôs efforts
to increase its energy security by taking
more direct control of its supply.

increases in transportation costs and
uncertainties such as war. Shipping rates
have increased dramatically in recent
years, and the lack of its own crude
transportation alternatives places China
in a negative position when negotiating
rates.
The current situation also poses a
potential strategic threat to oil security.
Wars, terrorist attacks, diplomatic conflicts, and political factors
can all threaten oil transportation by sea. China
is hard-pressed to send
its military to locations
like the Strait of Hormuz
and the Malacca Strait to
guard oil being shipped
on foreign vessels.

Background

China‚Äôs tanker fleet has a capacity of
about 10 million tonnes/year, or 5-6%
of current oil imports. China‚Äôs tankers
average 20 years old, and the fleet has
few large tankers, placing it at a disadvantage in terms of economies-of-scale.
China should possess at least 90 million
tonnes/year of shipping capacity for
even half its imported oil to be transported by its own fleets and needs at
least 70 more VLCC to reach this target.
Pipelines are under construction to
bring oil imports from Russia, Kazakhstan, and other neighboring countries,
but the bulk of China‚Äôs supplies will still

Supply, %

China imported 90.53 million
tonnes of crude oil in first-half 2008,
an increase of 11.04% from the same
period last year.1
Regional imports totaled 50% from
the Middle East, 22% from Africa, and
12% from Southeast Asia, accounting
for 84% of total imported oil (Fig. 1).
All of these regions are far from China
and oil from them can only be transported to China by sea.
More than 90% of China‚Äôs imported
oil, however, is transported by foreign

estimates China will increase its imports
of oil and gas from Africa by 35-40%
in the next 5-10 years, with the oil
shipped entirely by marine transport.

The Panamanian-flagged 298,930-dwt VLCC Cosmerry Lake was designed and built in China by Nantong Cosco KHI Ship Engineering Co. Ltd. Launched in 2006, Cosmerry Lake is operated by COSCO

weakening of the global economy.

Strategic steps
The Chinese government is implementing the new strategy. Early in
2002, China‚Äôs Ministry of Transportation promulgated ‚ÄúStrategy of Reviving
the Nation through Enlarged Marine
Transportation Capacity,‚Äù calling for
the establishment of strong domestic
fleets. The Ministry of Finance grants
subsidized loans to shipyards building
supertankers.
The government is also encouraging
domestic oil companies to use domestic
shippers. In the past, the bulk of even
the small domestic shipping capacity
served foreign oil companies. In 2002
CMSNC, holding half of China‚Äôs tanker
capacity and its only VLCCs, delivered
only 7.3% of its cargoes to China. Only
3.78% of crude China imported from
the Middle East was carried by domestic
fleets. Domestic shippers carried more
than half of China‚Äôs crude imports from
Southeast Asia in 2002, but none of its
imports from Africa.

The government now encourages
domestic shipping companies and
domestic oil companies to enter longterm transportation contracts with
one another in an effort to reverse this
trend. The four major oil transporters,
CMSNC, COSCO, CSCO, and Yangtze

New custody transfer ultrasonic Ô¨Çowmeter
The ALTOSONIC III, a three-beam
custody transfer ultrasonic flowmeter, is
intended to replace turbines and other
type meters in the fiscal measurement of
light liquid hydrocarbons.
The company says its unit meets the

need for an ultrasonic flowmeter for single
products with the features of ultrasonic
flowmeters plus the custody transfer
metering requirement of the industry. For
custody transfer, the meter offers 0.2% accuracy and is compliant with OIML R-117.
With no moving parts, the meter promises
to eliminate problems with clogging, scaling, or blockage.
With no pressure loss, the need to
upsize pumps is avoided, the firm notes.
The meter is bidirectional, while the three
beams offer built-in redundancy in the
event of a sensor failure. Retrofitting is
easy, as the unit slots directly into the position taken by a turbine with a simple flow
straightener.

Financial crisis
hurts outlook for
EU energy goals
The folly of governmental targets for
energy use is coming into clear focus in
Europe.
A global Ô¨Ånancial crisis is playing havoc
with the European Union‚Äôs decree that 20%
of its members‚Äô energy must come from
renewable sources by 2020.
When governments set targets like that,
they take little account of the practicalities
of achievement, including real-world con-

T h e
E d i t o r ‚Äô s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

straints such as engineering and economics. The EU could have set the target at 15%
or 25%.
What‚Äôs important in policy-making is
that there be a target, without which policymakers can be criticized for lack of seriousness. In this case, it‚Äôs easy to see how the
EU came to its 20% target for renewables.
Twenty percent in twenty-twenty. Isn‚Äôt that
clever?
Propaganda trumps practicality, not to
mention the economic interests of European energy consumers.
The Ô¨Ånancial crisis has thrown doubt on
large, risky offshore wind and tidal projects.
‚ÄúLack of liquidity means companies will
Ô¨Ånd it nearly impossible to raise the ‚Ç¨500
billion which we believe would be required
to make such projects successful,‚Äù says a
report by Helmut Edelmann, a director in
Ernst & Young‚Äôs Power & Utilities Center.
While utilities remain focused on the
big projects that have become Ô¨Ånancially
doubtful, opportunities exist in small,
decentralized power production from wind,
solar, photovoltaics, and biomass, Edelmann told a conference in Brussels on Nov.
25. ‚ÄúInstead of just distributing power from
the plant to the customer, grids will need to
be adapted to receive power from customers and store or redistribute that power
to others depending on demand,‚Äù he said,
stressing the need for cutting technology
costs and ‚Äúindustrializing the whole supply
chain.‚Äù
Edelmann said, ‚ÄúUtilities should offer investment support to commercial customers
or private consumers to help them build
small renewable energy plants that feed in
power back to the grid.‚Äù
From here, that sounds like commercializing renewable energy on a scale sufÔ¨Åcient
to meet the EU‚Äôs poetic target depends on

OPEC: Oil demand deteriorates
Although there were no production adjustments at their Nov. 29 consultation in
Cairo, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries did note the
rapid deterioration of demand prospects since their Oct. 24 agreement to reduce
production effective Nov. 1.
In the Houston ofÔ¨Åce of Raymond James & Associates Inc., analysts saw it as a
‚Äúclear implication‚Äù that another production cut is coming, probably at OPEC‚Äôs Dec.
17 meeting in Oran, Algeria. Others wonder why OPEC should consider another cut
without knowing the extent of compliance with its previous reduction and its effect
on oil markets. The last cut did not slow the temporary fall of oil prices to below
$50/bbl on Nov. 20; that was the Ô¨Årst time since May 2005 that a front-month crude
contract dipped below $50/bbl in the New York market. In the past, OPEC hasn‚Äôt had
much luck maintaining prices during a Ô¨Ånancial crisis.
‚ÄúWorld oil markets clearly reÔ¨Çect lack of credibility in OPEC, their ability to adhere
to output cuts, and their ability to support their [unofÔ¨Åcial] target price of $75/bbl,‚Äù
said analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC in New Orleans.
Raymond James analysts said the oil market apparently has factored into prices
a 3-4% decline in global oil demand. ‚ÄúFrom a historical perspective, that type of
demand decline in a falling oil price world just seems too severe. That means we expect oil prices to gradually improve though 2009 as liquidity returns to the commodity markets and global capital infusions begin to drive global oil demand gradually
higher,‚Äù they said. At KBC Market Services, a division of KBC Process Technology Ltd.
in Surrey, UK, analysts expect OPEC‚Äôs production cuts to stabilize prices. ‚ÄúIn 2009 the
average price of Brent crude oil will be $80/bbl,‚Äù they said.
‚ÄúThe best cure for low oil prices is‚Ä¶low oil prices,‚Äù said Raymond James analysts. ‚ÄúAs investment in new supply dwindles‚Äîboth because of more limited available cash Ô¨Çow and also the credit crunch‚Äînon-OPEC supply will likely fall, and the
prospects for growth from OPEC look anemic as well.‚Äù
Consequences of $50 oil
Meanwhile, analysts noted various consequences if crude hovers at $50/bbl for a
substantial period:
‚Ä¢ Lower prices for transportation and heating energy bring relief to consumers.
In Arlington, Va., however, analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Inc. (FBR)
reported signs ‚Äúthat the US driver may be coming back to life.‚Äù The latest data from
MasterCard Advisors indicated US gasoline demand increased 172,000 b/d to 9.2
million b/d in a week. Demand is still down 1.2% from a year ago, but it‚Äôs a possible
start.
‚Ä¢ Lower prices disrupt the budget plans of OPEC countries. ‚ÄúIf prices move much
below $50/bbl, the alarm bells will be deafening,‚Äù said KBC analysts. ‚ÄúSpending commitments range from social programs to long-term investments in oil infrastructure
that are needed to meet long-term energy demand. Political stability in some OPEC
countries might depend on these social programs, and the world‚Äôs future supply of
crude oil and products will depend on these investments in oil infrastructure.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ It raises doubts about the viability of oil projects both upstream and downstream. At the end of November, the list of deferred and cancelled projects was
growing.
‚ÄúWe are witnessing the end of structurally cheap oil and the beginning of structurally higher-priced oil,‚Äù said KBC analysts. ‚ÄúThere is an incentive to invest, but is
there the will?‚Äù By 2010, KBC analysts expect a strong recovery in demand ‚Äúthat will
be maintained for much of the following decade.‚Äù Meanwhile they expect conventional crude production in non-OPEC countries to increase until 2020 before going
into gradual decline. That will increase world dependence on OPEC suppliers who
need to invest to provide more production capacity.
‚ÄúAfter 2015, we will need more reÔ¨Åning capacity to meet global demand growth,‚Äù
they said. As upstream and downstream spare capacity shrink, KBC analysts expect
crude prices to inch up to $105/bbl in 2015 and $130/bbl in 2020.
‚ÄúThe driving force‚Äîliterally‚Äîbehind oil demand growth in China and the rest of
the developing world is the dramatic expansion of vehicle Ô¨Çeets,‚Äù said KBC analysts.
By 2030 there will be 1.3 billion vehicles from 800 million today, they said. But new
CAFE standards and an apparent ‚Äústructural move‚Äù to more fuel-efÔ¨Åcient vehicles
have KBC analysts expecting a 2.5 million b/d decrease in US gasoline demand by
2030. Demand for diesel and jet fuel will grow to 2030, but the ratio of fuel growth to
GDP growth will fall as more fuel-efÔ¨Åcient vehicles and aircraft come into service.

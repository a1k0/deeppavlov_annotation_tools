NGC: Tax proposals would harm gas industry

with a view to ensuring that oil revenues are properly revealed and
shared.
“The government should regularly audit oil companies,” said
Sarah Wykes, an activist and researcher on oil and transparency issues with the London-based human rights organization, International Alert (IA).
“There should also be a parliamentary committee to ensure that
the oil revenue was properly managed,” said Wykes, who was arrested in Angola 2 years ago while attempting to assess the transparency of its oil sector.
Wykes told Ugandan parliamentarians that although revenue
from oil had potential to lift people out of poverty, it could also
bring suffering to the masses as it benefited just a handful of people.
“It is [incumbent] upon you to make sure that the common
man benefits and that oil does not turn into a curse,” said Wykes,
who added that there is also a tendency of investors to exploit
countries by giving them little revenue.
Wykes’ remarks struck a chord with Uganda Member of Parliament Stephen Mukitale, who called on the government to carry out
consultations on oil production. “We should know the prospective
and production costs so that we are not cheated,” Mukitale said.
Meanwhile, Ugandan rebels known as the Lord’s Resistance
Army (LRA) also are eyeing the country’s oil resources.
LRA’s chief negotiator David Matsanga told a news conference
in Nairobi that the discovery of oil in Uganda’s northern region
could ignite a fresh war in the region.
“There might be a fight motivated by the need to protect the oil
fields,” said Matsanga, referring to oil discoveries around Uganda’s
Lake Albert that have been reported to be among the largest finds
around the region.
Earlier this week, international oil companies operating in
Uganda, who confirmed the discoveries, announced plans for
stepped up production from the fields.
Tullow Chief Operating Officer Paul McDade said the company
recently discovered more oil in the lakes region. He said first oil
production would commence in 2010, with production rising to

close eye on international oil companies operating in the country,
The Obama administration’s proposed tax law changes would
seriously damage a domestic gas industry, which is hurting already,
the Natural Gas Council warned in a Mar. 17 letter to members of
Congress.
The group, which is comprised of trade associations involved
in the US gas industry from wellhead to burner tip, explained that
investments in new US gas production come from three funding
sources: selling the gas, obtaining credit from lenders, and securing private and institutional investors willing to commit capital to
high-risk ventures.
“Unfortunately, new US natural gas projects are at risk. Dramatic reductions in natural gas prices this past year have reduced
cash flow to producers, while the credit crunch has limited access
to capital, and investors are more cautious than ever,” the letter
continued.
It said the White House’s tax proposals, outlined in its proposed
fiscal 2010 federal budget, would radically shift incentives for developing domestic gas, some of which have been in place since
1913.
“If these taxes are imposed on the industry, not only will prices
rise for consumers, but tax and royalty revenues to the federal and
state treasuries will diminish, and well-paying American jobs will
be eliminated,” the group warned.
Such results would run counter to the Obama administration’s
stated strategy of developing cleaner energy and reducing US reliance on foreign oil, it continued. “We urge you to reject these
unjustified changes to energy tax policy. Congress must develop rational national energy strategies [which] rely on American energy
first, including clean-burning, abundant American natural gas,” the
NGC’s letter said.
The letter was signed by Independent Petroleum Association
of American Pres. Barry Russell, Natural Gas Supply Association
Pres. R. Skip Horvath, Interstate Natural Gas Association of America
Pres. Donald F. Santa, and American Gas Association Pres. David N.
Parker.

ees are operator StatoilHydro 70%, Petoro 20%, and Norske Shell
10%.
No formation test was carried out, the company said, but extensive data gathering and coring took place in the reservoir before
well 6705/10-1 was permanently plugged and abandoned.
The find represents “one of the bigger discoveries off Norway
in recent years,” said Tove Stuhr Sjoblom, StatoilHydro’s head of
Norwegian exploration.
Frode Fasteland, exploration manager for the Norwegian Sea,
said, “Asterix will be considered for development together with
Luva and the other nearby discoveries of Haklang and Snefrid
South. That could help to lay the basis for a deepwater gas infrastructure in the Norwegian Sea.” Asterix is 80 km west of Luva
(OGJ, Apr. 3, 2006, p. 33).
StatoilHydro will now redeploy the Transocean Leader to production license 035B/362 in the North Sea to drill a delineation
well on the Fulla structure.

Nexus places Crux project on short-term hold
Nexus Energy Ltd., Melbourne, operator of the proposed Crux
field liquids-gas recycling project in the Browse basin off Western Australia, has put the project in temporary abeyance following
failed attempts to sell down its interest in the development. The
sales process has been managed by Deutsche Bank.
Nexus plans to minimizing future capital expenditures until
market conditions improve. Nevertheless the company adds that
it hopes negotiations over asset sales, debt raising alternatives, and

Drilling

&

contractual obligations will be completed by the end of March.
Nexus says attempts to sell a stake in Crux have not resulted
in an acceptable offer and, although it will continue to consider
offers, the sale will not be actively marketed. It owns 85%, with
Osaka Gas owning 15%. Nexus has been trying to sell as much
as 30% of the project since the Japanese firm Mitsui walked away
from a purchase deal in October 2008. Mitsui had planned to buy
a 25% interest for $255 million, but global financial problems interfered.
Crux has an estimated 75.2 million bbl of condensate.
Currently it is negotiating to secure funding for the drilling of
the Auriga prospect, which has estimated potential reserves of 42
million bbl of liquids within tie-back range of Crux field.
Drilling on Auriga is expected to begin in late May. A success
would greatly enhance the economics of the Crux project.
In the same Browse basin region, Nexus is preparing to farm
out a stake in its Echuca Shoals field in permit WA-377-P. A successful farmout could result in a well’s being drilled later this year to
test the full potential of the field, which holds possibilities for an
LNG-scale development.
Elsewhere, the company is pushing ahead with its Longtom gas
development in Bass Strait and expects to bring the field on stream
to fulfill its supply contract with Santos through the Patricia-Baleen
production plant on Victoria’s east Gippsland coast by mid-2009.
Nexus says its key priority is finding funding solutions, while
ensuring that Longtom achieves a cash-flow positive position as
soon as possible. ✦

Shell completes Perdido
topsides installation
Shell Oil Co. has completed installation
of the drilling and production platform
atop a 555-ft cylindrical spar at its Perdido
development in 8,000 ft of water 200 miles
from Houston in an isolated section of the
Gulf of Mexico.
It is the deepest such facility in the
world, company officials claimed (OGJ Online, Dec. 3, 2008).
Russ Ford, Shell’s technology vice-president for the Americas, said, “Perdido is a
technological tour de force that is opening
up a new frontier for global oil and gas production.” He said, “Producing oil safely and
responsibly this far out and this deep should
allay concerns about industry access to the
85% of the US Outer Continental Shelf that
remains undeveloped.”
Shell operates the Perdido project; its
partners are BP PLC and Chevron Corp.

innovations before commercial development in 2006.
Over the next several months, 270 workers living on the platform and on an adjacent “flotel” will complete the commissioning
and hookup to begin producing oil and gas. The platform is capable
of producing 130,000 boe/d. Oil will be transported through 77
miles of pipelines, while gas will move through 107 miles of pipelines over the rugged sea floor to connect with existing offshore
pipeline.
The Perdido subsea well was drilled to 9,356 ft below the water’s surface and completed. The project intends to drill an even
deeper well at 9,627 ft.
Nine polyester mooring lines more than 2 miles in length now
hold the 50,000-ton floating structure in place. The facility includes a common processing hub to gather, process, and export
production within a 30-mile radius. It is designed to provide regional synergies, reduce costs, and lower risk as well as minimizing the environmental impact in this frontier area. Officials said
10 innovative systems were designed to make Perdido a leader in
health and safety.
In connection with its work on Perdido, Technip claimed two
water-depth records. The Paris company installed a reeled flowline
in 9,731 ft of water and a reeled steel catenary riser in 8,100 ft.
Under separate contracts, Technip supplied Perdido umbilicals
and the hull and mooring system for the spar.

During 2009 and 2010, the joint venture will focus on enhancing the production performance of the Phase 1 oil stage, at the
same time reducing its development commitments for the Phase
2 gas development.
Roc has swapped its contracted use of the Songa Venus semisubmersible drilling rig with Shell Development Australia for use of
the Ocean Patriot semi. Songa Venus is contracted to Shell for work
in the Browse basin off Western Australia and to cover the Roc
work in Bass Strait in July would have meant a long and expensive
mobilization. Ocean Patriot is already in the strait. It will now carry
out the planned 60-90 day program for Roc in May.
In addition, Roc has reduced its commitment for use of the Kan
Tan IV jack up rig to 30 days from 143 days (originally to begin in
March; now to begin in late 2010). This has been achieved through
assignments of the rig to existing consortium members for work
elsewhere.
Roc also says the gas flaring conditions for the BMG project have
been revised to allow production to continue while modifications
are made to the Crystal Ocean floating production, storage, and
offloading vessel, which will remove the need for flaring during
normal operations.
New topside facilities on the vessel include a low-pressure flare
recovery compressor package to supplement the reinjection of produced gas. Cost of the new facilities, due for completion during the
fourth quarter of this year, will be $10 million (Aus.).

Motiva delays Port Arthur reﬁnery expansion
Motiva Enterprises LLC has delayed until first-quarter 2012 the
completion target for a project that will make its 285,000-b/d refinery at Port Arthur, Tex., the largest in the US.
Motiva, a joint venture of Shell Oil Co. and Saudi Refining Inc.,
originally planned to complete the $7 billion expansion in late
2010.
The project will add a single-train crude distillation unit with a
capacity of 325,000 b/d.
Other new units include an 85,000-b/d catalytic reformer
with associated isomerization and hydrotreating units, a sulfur recovery facility, a 75,000-b/d hydrocracker integrated with a new
60,000-b/d diesel hydrotreater, a 50,000-b/d hydrotreater for
feed to the existing catalytic cracker, and a 95,000-b/d coker.
Motiva also is adding a 150-Mw electric power station that will
produce 2 million lb/hr of steam.
The expanded Port Arthur facility will be the country’s largest refinery producer of sulfur and largest producer of petroleum
coke.
The main project contractor is a joint venture of Bechtel and
Jacobs Engineering Group.

Enterprise starts Meeker II gas plant service
Enterprise Products Partners LP reported the start of operations
at its Meeker II natural gas processing plant in Colorado’s Piceance
basin.
The Meeker II expansion doubles the gas processing capacity at
the Meeker complex to 1.5 bcfd with the capability to extract as
much as 70,000 b/d of natural gas liquids (NGL).
Enterprise also has started operations at its recently expanded
Shilling and Thompsonville gas processing plants in South Texas,
and the company expects the partnership’s relocated Chaparral facility in the Permian basin to begin processing gas later this
month.
The Meeker complex is supported by long-term commitments
from 10 of the largest producers in the Piceance basin. Current
inlet volume at Meeker is 750 MMcfd, with 38,000 b/d of NGL
being extracted. Gas volumes are projected to reach 1.1 bcfd by
yearend, when NGL production is expected to reach 60,000 b/d.

“This expansion will facilitate the continuing growth in natural
gas production from the Piceance basin that is expected in 2009
and 2010 despite the effects of the recent decrease in drilling activity,” said A.J. Teague, Enterprise executive vice-president and chief
commercial officer.
Teague noted that, based on producer estimates, there are more
than 300 wells that have been completed in the basin that are waiting for pipeline connections. Meeker, through its connection with
the White River natural gas hub, affords producers access to markets through connections with six interstate pipelines having 2.5
bcfd of total takeaway capacity, he said.
The Chaparral facility was an idle plant acquired in 2004 in
the merger with GulfTerra Energy Partners LP and recently relocated from southeast Texas to serve producers in the Permian
basin. The facility, which can handle as much as 40 MMcfd of
gas and extract more than 2,000 b/d of NGL, complements the
partnership’s 900-mile Carlsbad gathering system in southeast
New Mexico.
As part of the project, Enterprise constructed 13 miles of 4-in.
NGL pipeline. It links the processing plant to Teppco Partners LP’s
Chaparral pipeline, which transports NGL to the world’s largest
fractionation complex at Mont Belvieu, Tex.

Expansion projects also have been completed and placed into
service at two gas processing facilities that are part of Enterprise’s
South Texas system. At the Shilling plant in Webb County, capacity
has been increased to 110 MMcfd from 60 MMcfd as part of a project relocating equipment from idle plants and modifying existing
infrastructure.
The partnership also modified existing equipment rather than
building new systems to expand its Thompsonville gas processing
plant in Jim Hogg County. Repiping and other efforts designed to
enhance efficiency increased capacity at the facility to 330 MMcfd
from 300 MMcfd while maintaining ethane and propane recovery
percentages.

Chevron to sell stake in India reﬁnery
Reliance Industries Ltd. will buy back Chevron Corp.’s 5% stake
in a 580,000 b/d refinery in Jamnagar, India, at the original price
of $300 million.
Under the initial 2006 deal, Chevron had the option to raise its
stake to 29%. Chevron, Reliance Industries, and the refinery’s operating company jointly decided not to consummate those agreements.
Chevron cited “attractive investment alternatives and continuing low global demand for refined products” as the reasons for its
sale. ✦

Algeria’s Skikda LNG plant start-up delayed again bridge Inc. to buy the latter’s 24.7% interest in the Oleoducto CenAlgeria’s Skikda LNG plant will not come online until 2013, 2
years later than its earlier announced completion date, according to
Chakib Khelil, Algeria’s oil minister.
“It’s being built, it’s advancing really well,” Khelil told Bloomberg
News, adding that construction of the plant is about 20% complete
and procurement of 70% of materials has been carried out.
Khelil’s announcement, which gave no explanation for the delay, marks a change in earlier statements about the plant’s projected
start-up date.
In January 2008, Khelil told OGJ: “We are building another
LNG plant in Skikda, and the contract was awarded to KBR so that
will also be ready in 2011 (OGJ Online, Jan. 7, 2008).
Earlier, in April 2006, Khelil said that work on the facility was
still under negotiation but he insisted that “the plant in any case
will be ready in 2009, as scheduled.”
Three of the plant’s six trains were destroyed and another one
was badly damaged when a boiler in one of the units exploded in
January 2004, killing some 23 people and injured nearly 80.
In 2007, KBR said it won an engineering, procurement, and
construction contract for the Skikda LNG project, valued at some
$2.8 billion.
In addition to performing the EPC work for the 4.5 million
tonnnes/year LNG train along with associated LPG and condensate recovery, KBR said it would execute the precommissioning and
commissioning portion of the contract.

tral SA (Ocensa) oil pipeline, which extends from the country’s
interior to the Caribbean coast, for $417.8 million.
The transaction increases Ecopetrol’s stake in Ocensa to 60%.
The company says the deal will allow it to more readily increase oil
production in Colombia’s Eastern Plains region.
Enbridge became an owner and operator of Ocensa in 1995,
with the pipeline entering service in 1996. The 525-mile Ocensa
system can transport as much as 650,000 b/d of crude through
30-in. and 36-in. OD pipe from Cuisiana and Cupiagua fields to the
port of Covinas. The system also includes five pumping stations,
tankage, and marine loading facilities.
Other initial stakeholders in Ocensa were BP Pipelines 15.2%,
Total Pipeline 15.2%, and Triton Pipeline Colombia 9.6%.
The agreement follows Ecopetrol’s announcement that it would
acquire producer Hocol Petroleum Ltd. from Maurel & Prom, Paris,
for $748 million (OGJ Online, Mar. 10, 2009). ✦

Correction
In coverage of the 88th Annual Convention of the Gas
Processors Association, OGJ incorrectly reported that
Devon Energy Corp.’s 2009 capital budget was larger
than its 2008 budget (OGJ, Mar. 16, 2009, Newsletter).
Devon has cut its 2009 budget to “match reduced cash

Don’t hike ethanol cap
I am strongly opposed to allowing
even more ethanol in automotive gasoline for several sound technical reasons
(OGJ Online, Mar. 9, 2009):
1. Production of ethanol from edible
crops is not additive to energy supplies
and increases food costs the world over.
2. We, The People, are heavily subsidizing ethanol use in gasoline. It is not
energy additive or financially attractive
without a gift from the US in the form
of a tax credit.
3. Present “splash blending” of ethanol results in some batches greatly above
10%, causing vehicle damage. My son is
a technician at a BMW/Mercedes/Volvo
dealership. They have measured ethanol
levels over 20%. Those levels caused
failure of the catalytic muffler system of
a new MBZ—not covered by warranty,
requiring over $5,000 to replace. When
the shop adds 50 ml of water to 100
ml of the suspect fuel and gets 70 ml of
water layer, that is conclusive proof of
more than 20% ethanol.
4. Many people have experienced and
are continuing to experience very costly
(and polluting) fuel injector malfunction and failure caused by ethanol. The
plastic used in the injector parts in many
cars up to about 1998 are attacked by
ethanol and swell and crack. Replacement parts are made of the same plastic
and also fail. On some cars subject to
this failure, it can cost over $1,000 to
replace a single failed injector, and the
new part may fail in just a few months
from the same condition.
Statements by the ethanol industry
about 30 years of experience with the
additive are valid concerning time but
omit the known problems caused by
high ethanol levels in many cars. Nor do
they consider the decrease in engine efficiency (5-15% more fuel use) caused by
ethanol blends in many cars and trucks.
I am a chemical engineer with 35
years of good experience in refining,
consulting, and energy alternative development.

Ethanol’s new rescue cry
Every time fuel ethanol blows off its economic
moorings, as state-sponsored energy always does,
Congress obliges with new support. The latest
rescue, enacted in 2007, is looking expensive and
probably unfeasible. Plant economics, meanwhile,
have soured. Predictably, the ethanol industry
wants new help.
Ethanol’s history should make fans of government support for noncommercial energy cautious.
Since 1978, fuel ethanol made from grain has enjoyed various, generous tax breaks, without which
it would not be commercial. Because ethanol
boosts octane, it already had a natural market after
federal regulations phased lead out of gasoline in
the mid-1970s. But that wasn’t enough.
In the 1980s Congress passed several inducements to ethanol plant construction, imposed
a protectionist import fee, and increased the
gasoline excise exemption and income tax credit
for blenders. In the 1990s, new requirements of
oxygen in gasoline played to an ethanol advantage,
although the additive required yet more special
help in the form of relaxation of volatility limits.
It also had to compete with methyl tertiary butyl
ether, which could be processed into gasoline at
the refinery and didn’t need subsidization.

Fortunes brighten
Ethanol’s fortunes brightened with passage of
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT). The law
removed the oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline but compensated ethanol producers in two important ways. It didn’t limit MTBE
suppliers’ damage exposure in lawsuits over water
supplies found to contain the oxygenate. And it
set a mandate for renewable fuels, mainly ethanol,
phasing up to 7.5 billion gal in 2012.
MTBE quickly exited the market, replaced by
ethanol. Construction of ethanol plants boomed.
By 2007 overcapacity and a predictable leap in
grain prices were squeezing plant economics. So
Congress rescued ethanol again with the Energy
Independence and Security Act, raising the renewable fuel standard immediately to sop up the surplus and escalating it to 36 billion gal by 2022, of
which 15 billion gal can be from grain. Much of
the balance is expected to be ethanol made from
cellulose. But that material has yet to be produced
16

commercially despite governmental research assistance in effect since the 1970s.
The governmental help ethanol has received is
unprecedented. Ethanol boosters habitually argue
that subsidization is a matter of fairness, given
historic subsidies for oil and gas. In fact, oil and
gas never have received help approaching levels
enjoyed by ethanol on a per-energy-unit basis
(OGJ, Mar. 2, 2009, p. 18). Their use certainly isn’t
mandated by Washington, DC.
The ethanol industry’s new cry for rescue
results from failure by Congress to anticipate
markets or otherwise think about what it was doing when it hiked the renewable fuel standard to
zany levels in 2007. The portion of the gasoline
market limited to 10% ethanol blends soon will be
saturated. That leaves the fleet of flex-fuel vehicles,
which can use the 85:15 ethanol-gasoline mixture
known as E85, to absorb incremental volumes as
the ethanol mandate rises.
The Energy Policy Research Foundation Inc.
(www.eprinc.org) sees problems. The price of
E85 must be low enough to overcome mileage
disadvantages if flex-fuel motorists are to buy
it, EPRINC points out in a study. But the price of
ethanol has to be high enough to ensure supply.
As mandates rise, refiners will have to push E85 by
discounting price. Meanwhile, they’ll incur new
costs as they cut crude runs and handle growing
amounts of ethanol.
EPRINC thinks refiners might have to recoup
$1/gal of ethanol sold in transport fuel. “This cost
can only be recovered through higher prices for
E10 and distillate and, depending on a wide range
of factors, could easily drive gasoline and distillate
prices up by 10-25¢/gal over the next 2-3 years as
compared to a scenario with the fuel mandates,” it
says.

Ignoring warnings
Ethanol’s friends in Congress have ignored all
such warnings when they’ve rescued ethanol in
the past. They’ll probably ignore the cost hikes
along with warnings about harm to vehicle
engines now as they answer the ethanol lobby’s
appeal for a blend cap in normal gasoline above
10%.
The story has no end. Neither do the costs. ✦

It would seem unlikely that the
Persian Gulf region, so commercially
dependent on fossil fuel production
and exportation, would lead the world’s
search for the 21st Century’s energy
source. However, the Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC) nations—Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and
the UAE—are planning a multitude of
projects to exploit the region’s seemingly limitless sun
and wind and to
pioneer efforts to
limit their fossil fuel
dependence.
The UAE, particularly Abu Dhabi,
leads the race to
strategically develop sustainable renewable energy sources—with Saudi Arabia
close behind.
At the November 2007 Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries summit in Riyadh, where one of the core
strategies was clean technology development, the Persian Gulf members of
OPEC pledged to devote $750 million
to study the viability of clean energy,
with a particular focus on carbon
capture and storage (CCS) technology.
Some incredulous detractors questioned
their sincerity, as most of the money
was earmarked for CCS, which is designed primarily to extend the viability
of hydrocarbon use.1 However, OPEC
and the GCC nations understand that
fossil fuels are an exhaustible resource.
They also recognize that they can utilize
their prodigious amounts of sun and
wind power to transition to nextgeneration renewable technology for
both domestic use and for exporting to
Europe.

Qatar is studying the benefits of wind
energy, the next generation of GCC
green energy is solidly in the UAE.
Saudi Arabia, one of the first to initiate renewable energy pilot projects in
the 1980s, seemed to have rapidly lost
its desire as oil prices regained their
stability in the late 1980s.
Abu Dhabi intends to build upon the
technological progress made since then
in economies of scale to catapult itself to
the head of an alternative energy boom.
Abu Dhabi, which traditionally is a
less-traveled destination in the UAE and
much less glitzy than its sister emirate,
Dubai, caused predictable mirth in the
energy community in 2006 when it announced a $22 billion, comprehensive,
clean energy plan called the Masdar
(“Source”) Initiative.
The Masdar Initiative has six logistical components that will function as
catalysts to commercially reinvent Abu
Dhabi and—by extension—the wider
UAE.
When unified, the Masdar Initiative
will transform the UAE’s energy consumption patterns.
The initiative’s six components are
construction of the world’s first carbonneutral municipality, Masdar City, and
further development of the Masdar
Institute of Science and Technology
(MIST), the Masdar Research Network,
the Innovation and Investment unit,
the Carbon Management unit, and the
Special Projects unit.
Abu Dhabi hopes the academic and
corporate partnership, as exemplified
by MIST, will soon enable the exportation of high-grade renewable energy
technology.
However, the Masdar Initiative

It is understandable that the GCC
countries wish to increase oil and
gas supplies for export and to reserve
renewables for domestic usage. But the
GCC preference for renewable energies
is also the result of certain market inefficiencies; for example, the previously
mentioned GCC gas crises and power

OPEC aims at full compliance with existing quota
The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, noting signs of
market strengthening, agreed in a Mar.
15 meeting in Vienna to seek full compliance with a quota cut announced in
December.
The exporters’ group had been
expected to focus on compliance with
the earlier target rather than adjust
the quota again (OGJ Online, Mar. 11,
2009).
The group said “secondary sources”
had reported 79% compliance in Febru22

ary with the December decision, which
in conjunction with an earlier quota adjustment was to have reduced output by
4.2 million b/d to 24.85 million b/d.
It said that level of compliance with
production targets “has contributed to
balancing the price of the OPEC reference basket at around $40/bbl since
the beginning of the year, despite the
critical economic outlook.”
It cited forecasts that the global
economy will contract by 0.2% this
year, bringing annual average oil de-

mand down by 1 million b/d to 84.6
million b/d.
OPEC expects supply from outside its
membership to grow by 400,000 b/d
this year to 50.7 million b/d. That balance would lower the requirement for
OPEC crude oil production by 1.8 million b/d to 29.1 million b/d in 2009.
The group noted “some initial signs
reported of a reversal in crude oil stock
trends and a narrowing of the contango in the front price structure.” In a
contango market, forward prices exceed

those of crude for immediate delivery.
OPEC’s expectation of an increase in
non-OPEC supply differs from the view
of the International Energy Agency (OGJ
Online, Mar. 13, 2009). In its March Oil
Market Report IEA projected non-OPEC
supply at 50.6 million b/d, unchanged

from 2008 (see story, this page).
IEA’s projections, which include
average annual oil demand of 84.4 million b/d, imply a need for OPEC crude
oil, with no stock change, of 28.8 million b/d.
A third major source of market data,

the US Energy Information Administration, this month forecast global oil
demand at 84.27 million b/d, down
1.38 million b/d from 2008, and nonOPEC production at 49.76 million b/d,
up 10,000 b/d (OGJ, Mar. 16, 2009, p.
36). ✦

IEA, OPEC cut 2009 oil market demand, supply forecasts
The International Energy Agency
and the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries have revised their
forecasts for 2009 oil demand and supply in their latest monthly oil market reports. All the revisions were downward.
The Paris-based IEA has lowered its
forecast for 2009 non-OPEC supply
growth to zero following a new look at
ongoing problems, including gas leaks
and power outages, at Azerbaijan’s offshore Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli complex in
the Caspian Sea.
In its previous monthly oil market
report, IEA had forecast that non-OPEC
supply would grow 380,000 b/d this
year. This month’s revision leaves 2009
output flat from 2008, averaging 50.6
million b/d.
In contrast, OPEC now projects in its
March oil market report that 2009 nonOPEC oil supply will increase 400,000
b/d from 2008 to average 50.7 million
b/d. This new estimate is a downward
revision of 200,000 b/d from the organization’s previous assessment, however,
mainly due to revisions to the output
forecasts for Mexico, Norway, Russia,
and the UK, OPEC said.

Demand outlooks
IEA slightly lowered its global oil
demand forecast to average 84.4 million b/d this year, a contraction of 1.2
million b/d from 2008 due to a reassessment of demand prospects in the
former Soviet Union, Asia, and North
America. This includes a cut of 130,000
b/d from Russian 2009 demand amid
signs that economic slowdown there is
gathering pace.
Meanwhile, OPEC forecasts that

2009 worldwide oil demand will
decline 1 million b/d from last year.
This is a 400,000 b/d downward revision from the organization’s previous
forecast.
OPEC said the revision takes into
account the continued deterioration
in the world economy and the accompanying erosion in demand growth,
noting that the decline in demand will
extend across all regions except the

Middle East and China.
Oil demand in the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development countries is expected to decline
1.3 million b/d this year, while demand outside the OECD is projected to
increase only 300,000 b/d from a year
ago, according to OPEC projections.

in February averaged 83.9 million b/d,
down 1 million b/d from January and
down 3.4 million b/d from a year earlier.
OPEC crude supply, at 28 million b/d,
was down 1.1 million b/d from January.
The agency said a concerted effort by
some OPEC members to rein in produc-

tion in line with lower output targets
and, to a lesser extent, operational disruptions in other countries, led to near
80% compliance last month with the
cumulative 4.2 million b/d target cuts
agreed since September 2008.
Full compliance with agreed sup-

ply cuts would take OPEC output 1.6
million b/d below the 2009 call on
OPEC crude, implying a potential draw
in OECD stocks. Such full compliance
would tighten the market even without
further cuts to the target at the Mar. 15
meeting, IEA said. ✦

proposed several ideas for consideration,
including the creation of new trading
centers for oil, harmonized taxation of oil
producing companies, and preferential
long-term contracts for oil supplies.
“It is necessary to create a trading floor
where the amounts sold would be strictly
in line with the real supplies. That would
rule out speculation,” he said, conveniently
adding that Russia’s St. Petersburg commodity exchange could be used for the
purpose.
Sechin also called on OPEC, as well as
non-OPEC states friendly to the group,
to coordinate their crude oil tax policies.
He said such coordination should cover
all facets of oil policy and “would ensure
stability” of the oil market.
He also said, “The preferential application of long-term oil shipment contracts
would be a strong instrument in making
the market more stable and more predictable.”
Such contracts, he said, “would help
take due account of real outlays related
to the extraction and transportation of
oil while forming the price, and allow
producers to plan investment in long-term
projects.”
Meanwhile, Sechin said Russia has proposed holding an international conference
in the autumn, with OPEC and other oil
producers invited.
“We proposed holding an international
conference in Moscow in autumn 2009
with the participation of OPEC members,
independent oil producing states, and major oil companies and investors,” he said.
“The idea of the conference is to discuss
long overdue issues pertaining to energy
security and stable development of the oil
market,” Sechin said. ✦

Algeria deserves
a tax break

A

lgeria’s energy minister Chakib
Khelil recently urged gas-consuming nations to rethink their tax
policies if they are to remove barriers
and encourage imports (OGJ, Mar. 2,
2009).
Khelil gave a broad hint concerning his intended target, saying: “If it
is recognized that the gas is cleaner
energy than coal, it must be given a
tax advantage.”
The Algerian energy minister was
perhaps referring to possible changes
in Europe’s taxation of energy that
could emerge when the European
Commission (EC) early next month
tables a proposal to revise the 2003
EU energy tax directive.
While such a proposal is only
being mooted at the moment and
may never be tabled, Khelil is leaving
nothing to chance as he sees an opportunity to change a law that could
be viewed as hindering his country’s
natural gas exports.

But Khelil clearly does not think
that natural gas should, uh, be
lumped together with coal, and he
wants the Europeans to amend the
energy tax laws to ensure that his
country’s natural gas gets a break.
He’s right on that, and the Europeans should pay him greater heed,
especially given the wrangles they
have had—and the deep worries they
still have—regarding Russia as a reliable supplier of natural gas.

Khelil a willing ally

In Khelil, the Europeans have not
only an able supplier of natural gas
but one who has shown himself
more than willing to work with them
politically to provide it.

that restricted where the buyer of the
gas could resell it, something the EC
believed broke EU competition law?

Worldwide oil, natural gas deal value plunges
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
The total transaction value for
worldwide upstream corporate and
asset deals plunged to $104 billion in
2008 compared with an annual average
of nearly $160 billion during 2005-07,
consultants said in an annual report.
John S. Herold Inc. and Harrison Lovegrove & Co. Ltd. on Mar. 13
released highlights of their joint 2009
Global Upstream Mergers and Acquisitions Review, an analysis of more
than 280 major upstream transactions
announced in 2008. They released an
analysis of US transactions on Mar. 17.
The analysts said the upstream
merger and acquisition market again
appears ripe for considerable consolidation. The expectation is that corporate
takeover activity will increase this year
and into 2010.
“The number of assets coming to the
market is expected to increase,” the report said. “However, the buyer universe
may be smaller than in the past, at least
in the near term, as many of the companies that completed transactions over
the last 4 years now lack the resources
to remain active in the M&A market.”

During first-half 2008, deal activity
was occurring at a record pace. But the
pace slowed dramatically in the second
half, particularly in the US and Canada.
The steep second-half decline sent
the worldwide deal count to a 4-year
low from a record high level in 2007.
During 2008, 203 transactions were
announced by July 31.

Deals slow on lower oil prices
“Then the market tailed off precipitously to just 79 in the final 5 months
of [2008] due to plunging commodity prices and the extreme weakness in
equity and credit markets,” the report
said. “Activity in November and December was a record low 25 deals, half
the historical average.”
The total value for corporate transactions was $34.2 billion in 2008
compared with $64.2 billion in 2007
and $120.2 billion announced in 2005.
The corporate deal count was a 5-year
low, with no US corporate transactions
in the fourth quarter.
The value for transactions involving
oil and gas assets dropped during 2008
after rising for 6 consecutive years.
Total worldwide asset transaction
value fell to $70.1 billion from the

asset transaction values still marked the
second highest on record. Asset transactions accounted for a record 67% of
total worldwide transaction value and
80% of US transaction value.
Unconventional gas resources in
Canada, the US, and the Asia-Pacific
region represented nearly 40% of total
2008 global M&A activity.
Buyers competed vigorously for
coalseam gas assets in Australia and
shale gas interests in the US and
Canada. The gas weighting of transacted reserves reached 70%, marking a
10-year high.
The largest 2008 global upstream
transaction was ConocoPhillips’s $5.9
billion purchase of 50% interest in the
coal seam methane projects from power
retailer Origin Energy Ltd., Sydney. That
transaction was announced in September.
Other Australia transactions included
BG Group’s $2.9 billion acquisition of
Queensland Gas Co. and Petronas’s $2
billion investment in the coalseam gas
and LNG project of Santos (OGJ, July
14, 2008, p. 42).
Meanwhile in the US, shale gas
transactions accounted for more than
35% of 2008 deal value. Gas represented
more than 70% of acquired US proved
reserves for the third consecutive year.
Chesapeake Energy Corp. sold more
than $12 billion of US onshore assets
during 2008, including forward-sale

MMS, BLM must clarify lease policies, acting IG says
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Federal oil and gas leasing programs
could do more to encourage leaseholders to move more aggressively toward
production, the US Department of the
Interior’s acting inspector general told
a congressional subcommittee on Mar.
17.
Mary L. Kendall told the House
Natural Resources Committee’s Energy
and Minerals subcommittee that DOI’s
IG office recently completed an evaluation of nonproducing federal oil and
gas leases for US Rep. Norman D. Dicks
(D-Wash.), who chairs the House Appropriations Committee’s Interior and
Environment subcommittee.
“In addition to some very challenging data integrity and lease oversight issues, we found that the [US] Bureau of
Land Management and the [US] Minerals Management Service need to develop
much clearer policy concerning the
expectations of production of oil and
gas on federal lands. We recommended
that [DOI] consult with Congress in this
regard,” she said.
Kendall said investigators from her
office found that producers who hold
federal leases have little obligation to
actually produce oil and gas, and that
DOI has no formal policy to compel
them to bring the leases into production.
“While current statutes, regulations,
and policies do promote exploration,
production activities are not required

to commence within the primary lease
term. The bureaus do not inquire about
the production strategies of companies
and have not attempted to enforce the
performance clause included in lease
agreements,” she said in her written
testimony.

“Both industry and bureau officials
cautioned, however, that mandating
production activities may not necessarily have positive outcomes and could, in
fact, be counterproductive by reducing industry interest in federal leases,”
Kendall said.

MMS Lease Sale 208 attracts $703 million in high bids
Apparent high bids totaling just over
$703 million were offered for 348 tracts
in the central Gulf of Mexico at Lease
Sale 208, reported the US Department
of the Interior’s Minerals Management
Service Mar. 18 in New Orleans.
MMS received 476 bids totaling
nearly $994 million from 70 companies
at the sale. The tracts offered covered
nearly 1.9 million acres off Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Alabama.
The highest bid received on a tract
was $65,611,235 submitted by Shell
Gulf of Mexico Inc. for Mississippi
Canyon Block 721. The block receiving
the greatest number of bids was Walker
Ridge Block 134 with 6 bids.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who
attended the lease sale and then later
toured an offshore production platform
in the gulf’s Mississippi Canyon area,
told reporters that the number of companies participating in the sale showed
a “high level of interest” in the central
gulf area, despite a dramatic decline in
the total amount bid. Last year, MMS’s
Central Gulf Lease Sale 206 attracted
$3.7 billion in apparent high bids,
which set a record in US leasing history

Dispenses with rhetoric
Kendall made her observations at
the House Natural Resources subcommittee’s hearing examining oil and gas
production on the US Outer Continental Shelf. Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.),
the subcommittee’s chairman, said he
was determined to examine the lease
diligence question without the rhetoric
that characterized congressional debate
on the matter last summer.
“Perhaps no single statistic was used
more last year than the number 68 million, as in ‘There are 68 million acres of
nonproducing federal oil and gas leases
in the United States.’ While an accurate
number, by itself it told us very little,”
Costa said in his opening statement.

for high bids since area-wide leasing
began in 1983 (OGJ, Mar. 24, 2008, p.
38). During that sale, MMS received
1,057 bids from 85 companies on 615
tracts.
During this year’s sale, there was a
total of 13 tracts receiving bids in the
181 South Area of the central gulf, Salazar noted, and the high bids for these
tracts totaled $6,476,545. Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas will all
share in 37.5% of the high bids on these
tracts as well as all future revenues
generated from this acreage leased in
the 181 South Area as mandated by the
enhanced revenue sharing program in
the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act
of 2006. Additionally, 12.5% of revenues from the tracts in the 181 South
Area will be deposited into the Land
and Water Conservation Fund for use
by states to enhance parklands and for
other conservation projects.
Shortly after bids were announced,
American Petroleum Institute Pres. Jack
Gerard said in a statement, “The results of Lease Sale 208 underscore that,
like most US industries, the domestic
oil and natural gas sector faces tough

“One side argued that oil companies
were just sitting on these leases and
they should ‘use it or lose it.’ The other
side argued that these leases had no oil
and gas beneath them, and we needed
to provide new acreage to the industry
so they could ‘drill, baby, drill.’ To me,
both of these positions are nonsensical,”
he maintained.
Costa said witnesses at the Mar. 17
hearing also included a representative
from the Government Accountability
Office, which also has been examining
whether federal leaseholders are aggressively trying to produce oil and gas
from their tracts.
“From their reports, this much is
clear: The answers here are not solely
on one side or the other. Companies are
not just sitting on their leases and refus-

economic challenges, not only with the
economy reeling but with oil prices half
of what they were a year ago.”
Gerard said, “The Obama administration’s plans to add billions of dollars
in new taxes would have a devastating
impact on an industry that supports 6
million jobs and contributes billions of
dollars to government revenue. These
new taxes are ultimately anticonsumer,
threatening millions of jobs, the nation’s economic recovery and energy
security.”

Sale results, top bidders
The ultradeep water was a big draw
at the sale. Of the tracts receiving bids,
106 blocks lie in greater than 2,000 m
of water, 39 lie in 1,600-2,000 m of water, and 69 are in 800-1,600 m of water.

he said.

Many reasons
He noted that many factors can
explain why a lease does not produce
oil and gas, including regulatory delays, workforce shortages, equipment
shortages, and many other complexities. “Understanding these reasons in
a more thoughtful manner will allow
us to move forward more intelligently
and ultimately help us figure out how
domestic oil and gas production will fit

will not make companies develop any

punitive proposal designed for what

he opportunity was too tempting
to resist.
After US President Barack H. Obama
hosted a small business roundtable at
the White House Mar. 16, Independent
Petroleum Association of America Pres.
Barry Russell reminded him that independent producers are small businesses
too.
“The median number of full-time
employees at these oil and gas exploration and production companies is 12,
and these companies have been reinvesting 150% of their cash flow back into
the development of new technology
aimed at finding and producing more
energy from fewer wells,” Russell said
on Mar. 17.
“As the president moves forward
on an aggressive plan to support and
promote small businesses through
new federal grants and significant loan
guarantees, all we’re asking for is a level
playing field on which to continue our
critical work,” he continued.
Unfortunately, the Obama administration’s proposed federal budget for
fiscal 2010 targets US oil and gas producers with billions of dollars in new
taxes and compliance costs, Russell said.
“At a time of unprecedented insecurity,
with millions of Americans out of work,
a more prudent approach would be one
that supports all of America’s small businesses,” he said.

dent oil and natural gas producers,” he
said.
“This budget would cripple America’s independent producers and negate
any such improvement that might be
seen from the announcement you made
yesterday,” Russell told Obama.
Independent producers and their
associations had already responded
quickly to the administration’s oil and
gas tax proposals. IPAA held its 2009
Washington Call-up the week of Mar. 2-6
as more than 30 of its members came to
the nation’s capital to meet with federal
lawmakers and their staffs.The previously
scheduled event came less than a week
after the White House announced its
proposed fiscal 2010 budget.

Other issues too

The oil and gas tax changes in it were
the primary topic, but IPAA officers and
members also discussed environmental
regulations, access to capital and resources, and permitting issues, IPAA said.
Several regional independent producers’ associations joined the IPAA call-up,
including Texas Independent Producers
and Royalty Owners, Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States,
and California Independent Petroleum
Association. IPAMS members will be
back for their association’s call-up Apr.
1-2, and CIPA members will be in Washington Apr. 20-22.

doing more to encourage development
of leases that appear more likely to
have considerable resources; and BLM’s
persistent problems in hiring and retaining enough well-trained employees
to accommodate its rapidly increasing
workload.
“The federal government receives
one of the lowest shares of revenue for
oil and gas resources compared with
other countries, and [DOI] has not systematically re-examined how the federal
government is compensated for extraction of oil and gas for over 25 years,”
Rusco said in his written testimony.
Kendall said her office’s investigators found that incompatible data in
MMS’s and BLM’s tracking systems put
DOI at risk of losing millions of dollars
in royalties. “In one case, a breakdown
in communications between MMS and
BLM could have resulted in a loss of
nearly $6 million in royalties over a
5-year period had the company holding
the leases not sent its first production
report to both bureaus, not just BLM.
The existing process is heavily reliant
upon companies doing the right thing,”
she said.

Little guidance
She said that, while several federal
leasing laws and regulations contain
general “due diligence” provisions
requiring lessees to act affirmatively in
developing tracts, DOI has done little
to give leaseholders specific guidance.
“For 99% of the leases, the department
does not monitor to ensure that due
diligence is exercised. Accordingly, none
of these leases is terminated for failure
to produce. Rather, [DOI] allows these
leases to expire naturally,” Kendall said.
Another witness confirmed that
MMS has some statutory authority to
enforce due diligence, which could
be used to seek additional data from
leaseholders. “Until a company comes
to us with an exploration plan, we don’t
know whether it has been conducting
seismic tests,” said Chris Oynes, the
associate MMS director in charge of
the DOI agency’s offshore energy and
minerals management program.

MMS employs a detailed evaluation
process to determine whether bids
are adequate, he said in his written
testimony. “It considers the potential
income stream to the lessee associated
with the lease and all potential royalties
and rental payments to be paid to the
federal government to ensure that the
bonus received adequately reflects the
value of the potential resources associated with the lease,” he indicated. Nearly
$10 million of high bids in four 2008
OCS lease sales were rejected because
this evaluation process showed that they
did not meet fair market value criteria,
Oynes said.
Rusco suggested that DOI might
adopt leasing rates and durations that
could be adjusted to reflect a property’s relative hydrocarbon prospects.
Oynes questioned whether this would
be effective. “Some leases have more
prospectivity in terms of whether
hydrocarbons are there, but this can’t
be determined until they are actually
drilled,” he said.

Fiscal changes, burdens
Another witness warned that changing US offshore leasing terms could
dampen producers’ interest in the OCS.
“Fluctuations in prices and costs are
something we in the industry have
come to expect and have learned to
manage. What has taken us by surprise,
however, is the change in fiscal terms in
the United States,” said James W. Farnsworth, president and chief exploration
officer at Cobalt International Energy LP,
a privately-held Houston independent.
“For us, the high cost and technical
complexity of the Gulf of Mexico was
offset by a stable tax and royalty system.
Since 2005, when Cobalt was founded
and we began investing over $1 billion,
federal royalty rates in the offshore have
increased by 50%, and lease rental costs
have increased by 47%,” Farnsworth
said. “This increase has occurred despite
the fact that oil prices have reverted
back to 2005 levels. Additional taxes
and fees are now being considered to
add even more burden to companies
that are trying to find new oil and gas

fields here in the US,” he told the subcommittee.
Last fall the US moved into a world
without OCS moratoriums or withdrawals for the first time in more than
20 years, “a world we haven’t known
for some time,” observed another witness, National Ocean Industries Association President Tom Fry. “Is there more
oil and gas out there? Most likely,” he
said. Fry said new evaluations of areas
that have been off-limits for 2 decades
clearly are needed, but they should be
conducted by the oil and gas industry
and not the federal government.
“When you consider how much oil
is coming from a comparatively small
amount of land offshore, it becomes
increasingly clear just how much

potential resource may exist in areas in
which we haven’t looked,” he said. “As
decision-makers, Congress doesn’t have
all of this information. The information
we do have is often over 30 years old
and reliant on outdated technology,”
said Fry, who also testified on behalf
of the American Petroleum Institute,
Independent Petroleum Association of
America, International Association of
Drilling Contractors, Natural Gas Supply
Association, American Exploration and
Production Council, and the US Oil &
Gas Association.
“We know there are plenty of areas
where oil and gas exploration may
not be compatible with the landscape.
We also know there will be parts of
the ocean where resources will not be
present or will not be economic. With

testimony.
Oynes said a full inventory of the
OCS by the federal government would
take 3-5 years, depending on the type

of seismic survey used and several other
variables. He said MMS would close
the public comment period soon on
gathering information for an environmental impact statement of the Atlantic

There are many reasons—economic,
preaudits, strategic planning for enhanced recovery, among others—that
call for the size or ultimate reserves of
an oil or gas field to be estimated.
Fundamentally, there are three ways
to estimate reserves, and two of these—
volumetric and material balance—
require sensitive geologic and engineering data at the reservoir level that are
highly proprietary to the operators.
A field may consist of several reservoirs, varying from about three in Saudi
Arabia to 15 in Venezuela, grouped in
the same geological structure, each of
which has to be evaluated individually for its reserves and then summed
together for the field total.
The only method of directly estimating reserves for the entire field is
decline analysis. Although this methodology only requires knowledge of the
field’s production history, this information is also proprietary and therefore
sparsely available.
The huge share of mature fields,
which the IEA estimates the figure at
half of the total oil fields, calls for an
agile method for estimating reserves.
This article develops a model that
would provide an estimate of reserves
based only on the peak production rate
of an oil or gas field. Some unexpected
physical variations in the behavior of oil
and gas fields are brought to light.

L O P M E N T

The world’s ﬁelds
Oil has been produced worldwide
for well over a century, and more than
40,000 oil fields have been discovered.1 2 3
Of the known discovered reserves
of these fields, estimated at 2.4 trillion
bbl—94% are concentrated in fewer
than 1,500 major fields defined as those
with more than 100 million bbl of ultimate reserves.
For the US,
the tally exceeds 30,000
oil fields, of
which roughly 300 are
majors with
80% of total US reserves. The North
Sea has 265 oil fields of which 90 are
majors that account for 80% of total
reserves. Saudi Arabia has 96 oil fields.
Worldwide, the top 100 oil fields
account for 50% of current production
and 65% of reserves.
More than 90% of the world’s oil
fields are classified as small and hold
just 3% of reserves. A small oil field is
defined as one with less than 25 million
bbl of reserves.
The tally of gas fields discovered is
not as straightforward as for oil because gas comes from multiple sources:

(r2) of 0.994. For the purpose
of this analysis, the units for q and K

cubic feet (cf) were converted to boe
using a factor of 6,000 cf/bbl.

Five oil fields and six gas fields covering a spectrum of oil provinces were
used to establish the correlations shown
in the figure on p. 33.
The ultimate reserves of each field
were determined by production decline

peak production rates are actual field

tion between the reserves obtained
by the model algorithm (Equation 2)
and the decline standard was 5.3%.
For the gas fields, the mean deviation
was 3.3% for the values estimated with
Equation 3.
Contrary to intuitive expectation
that the trend lines for oil and gas fields
would be parallel, it turns out that they
intersect each other at about K = 10
Bboe or 60 tcf. This indicates that the
production potential of the vast majority (99%) of gas fields—those smaller
than 60 tcf—is lower than that of oil
fields of comparable size.
On the other hand, the production
potential of supergiant gas fields—those
larger than 60 tcf—is much higher
than that of oil fields of equivalent size.
The dissimilarity in the slopes of the
two correlations is apparently not due
to reservoir lithology. This premise was
tested using a mix of carbonate and
sandstone oil and gas fields.
The model was applied to a diverse
set of 17 oil and gas fields from around
the globe for which reliable data on
size and field peak production rate are
available. The table summarizes the recoverable reserves values obtained using
Equations 2 and 3, which are compared
with the standard values.
Deviation averages 4.6% for the oil
fields and 3.3% for the gas fields. It is
extraordinary that the ultimate reserves
of an oil or gas field can be estimated
with a reliability of 95% based on a
single parameter—its peak production
rate.
The model was then used to estimate the ultimate reserves of Ghawar,
a number that has been elusive with
approximations ranging from 75 billion
to 95 billion bbl.
According to the recent IEA Outlook,
Ghawar peaked at 5.588 million b/d
29 years after production start-up in
1951. These two facts can now be used
to obtain a fresh estimate of its reserves.
Equation 2 indicates that Ghawar’s
reserves are about 110 billion bbl. This
value can now be used to check its time

meability increases because the rock
volume dilates or expands (dilatancy).
This new paradigm is the focus of this
article.
GeoMechanics International Inc.
(GMI) has emphasized the pervasiveness of shear failure.10 The conventional concept of critical natural fractures
is that conductive fractures, aligned
with the maximum horizontal stress,
SHmax, are those on the verge of failing
(opening) in tension. GMI’s concept,
however, is that tensile fractures are
less likely to control flow compared
with shear fractures and faults in many
reservoirs.
The GMI concept is that conductive fractures are those on the verge of
failing in shear. Such critical fractures
will probably not align with SHmax (Fig.
4). Geothermal data also supports this
conclusion when microseismic bursts
have aligned in a direction at a significant angle to SHmax.
If the pore pressure stays below the
minimum horizontal stress, Shmin, as is
the usual geothermal situation, it seems
that initial failure is shear failure on
fractures at an angle to SHmax, and these
are the permeable fractures. But in the
oil and gas context, where pore pressure generally exceeds Shmin, both shear
and tensile failure can occur and the
situation is more complex.
In the special case of the Barnett
shale, shear failure should not occur
(theoretically) in the production sweetspot, because natural fractures align
with in situ stresses. But shear failure
does occur everywhere, implying that
natural fractures are misaligned with local stress or differential forces can shift
or rotate large matrix blocks, causing
shear failure.
Also, natural fractures align roughly
with Shmin and not SHmax.11 This condition may favor shear failure because the
natural fractures may block and divert
the growth of a tensile fracture; and
thereby create a fracture network.
When the stress field has local variations and orientation, it is possible for
the growing fracture to depart in dif-

This is one explanation for local variations observed in microseismic patterns
(although the far-field stress will govern
the overall direction).

ever, is difficult.
As previously mentioned, this article
will discuss the first key while the concluding part of this two-part series will
cover the remaining three keys.
The first key involves laboratory
studies that investigate permeability
enhancement from shearing. Fig. 7 illustrates the concept. It shows that shear
stress acting along a natural fracture or
weak plane can cause slippage.16 If the
surface is rough, this leads to gaps and
enhanced permeability. The term for
this mechanism is dilatancy.
In the lab, shear-box tests (direct
shear tests) can measure dilation and associated permeability increase. Fig. 8 is
a good illustration for coal in which dilation mostly increases with shear stress
up to shear failure.17 Note however, that
for the lower curves, where normal
stress is higher, the dilation can decrease
before it begins its large increase.
Fig. 9 shows the amount of permeability increase for different initial coal
permeabilities, Ki. The increase is very
large: 60 times for Ki = 30 md, and 600
times for Ki = 2 md.
The permeability enhancement is
greater if the initial permeability is
lower. It is also interesting that the
permeabilities at failure 1,200-1,900
md are not very sensitive to their initial
permeabilities.
Terra Tek has generalize these lab
results into an equation for permeability enhancement Ks/Ki, both in md, in
terms of ds the single-fracture dilation
in μm, and aKi where a is the fracture
spacing in cm.17 If we assume a similar relationship applies to hard rock as
well as coals, the implications for shear
stimulation in the field are:
• A smaller aKi (or equivalently a
smaller fracture width) gives a larger
Ks/Ki (Fig. 10)
• A larger dilation ds is better. One
should make sure that shear stress on a
natural fracture increases past yielding
and all the way to failure.
• Induce failure as far as possible out
into the reservoir, for example with a
pore pressure increase.

Shear interface dilation, μ

Fig. 10 shows that the permeability
enhancement is greatest in granites,
which is important in geothermal applications. Tight sands are intermediate. Coals and dolostones exhibit the
smallest permeability enhancement,
although as Fig. 9 shows, the permeability enhancement in coals can still be
very large.
The measurement of permeability
enhancement by shearing in the lab is
a key for predicting shear stimulation
in the field. We know how to predict a
zone where shear failure occurs after
injection into a well, but one needs lab
measurements to predict the degree of
permeability increase. Researchers still
have not done this integration properly,
to our knowledge.
An approximate approach assumes a
pressure-dependent permeability function (for natural fractures) and uses this
as a free parameter to match both shear
failure zone (microseismic burst pattern) and well production.13
The pressure-dependent permeability during injection would include
permeability enhancement due to
shearing (dilatancy). It could also
include presumably other mechanisms
such as elastic pressure-dependent permeability (ballooning of fractures), or
tensile failure. This lumped approach
is the approach we have used in our
modeling.
In future work, we envisage an approach in which lab measurements of
shear failure and permeability enhancement are directly input into shear
stimulation models. ✦

Ethylene and propylene are the
principal petrochemical products and a
major feedstock for production of other
polymers. The world’s largest expansion
ever for the construction of new ethylene and propylene plants is taking place
in the Middle East. These additions have
a major influence on the global petrochemical industry in the near future.
Several new mega petrochemical
projects are currently under construction at Jubail and Yanbu in Saudi Arabia,
Bandar Imam and Assaluyeh in Iran, and

hold due to feedstock issues.
In Iran, a massive gas shortage, especially in winter 2007, interrupted gas
supply for many petrochemical projects.
This gas shortage will likely continue
during 2008-12.
Delayed South Pars gas projects will
affect gas and ethane supplies to Iranian
petrochemical projects. The most critical
concern appears to be for new polyethylene units in the west and northwest
of the country. It should be noted that
new projects in these areas will receive
their feedstock by a 2,163-km ethylene
pipeline (the West Ethylene Pipeline).
This project, now only 50% complete, was due to be completed in 2007.
The initial plan was for construction of
five petrochemical complexes along the
pipeline. Now, however, the number of
complexes has increased to 11 projects.
The availability of feedstock from the
West Ethylene Pipeline is a serious challenge.
In Oman, recently, a new gas-based
olefin plant at Sohar was cancelled or
postponed because of gas-supply obstacles. In the UAE and Kuwait, gas supply to petrochemical plants has become
a critical problem because the countries
have a massive gas shortage, especially
in the summer.

Market implications
The global olefin market will be
oversupplied in the near term, and
this will likely depress market prices.
Middle East olefin suppliers, however,
will be less affected than Asian petrochemical producers because the Middle
East has access to relatively low-priced
feedstock. In Asia, small naphtha-based
projects (less than 300,000 tpy) will be
most affected.
For new projects, the era of extremely low feed-gas prices is over. Governments in the Middle East, however,
are not expected to increase feedstock
prices dramatically because they want
to encourage industrial development.
The new range of feedstock prices may
be $1.5-2.0/MMbtu and still allows
projects to move forward economically.
Some new projects will be less attractive
when compared with the past. ✦

New, third generation oil, gas ﬂow multiphase meter
The new, third
generation multiphase meter MPFM
2600 is based on
the firm’s new Zector technology and
comes with new
measurement principles.
Zector technology consists of
new field electronics, new electrode
arrangements, and voxel-based signal
processing, which will provide higher
accuracy than was previously available. The
new technology allows for a a large number of simultaneous sectors of the flow to
be investigated with a measurement rate of
12,000 measurements/sec.
The company says its technology allows for an accurate understanding of
flow regimes, mixing effects, and velocity
profiles and can detect rapid changes in

composition, thereby making measurements accurate and consistent. The new
technology measures multiple oil and gas
flow velocities as a function of its 4D location; e.g., near wall velocity will be different to center of pipe velocity. Velocities will
also vary over time due to composition,
turbulence, viscosity, and other effects.
The MPFM 2600 comes in a new
simple and lightweight design which, at
220 lb and 25.5 in., is 80% lighter and
50% shorter than previous multiphase
meters from the firm. This allows operators to install the unit on individual wells
and in previously inaccessible locations.
The standard version of the MPFM 2600 is
without radioactive technology and covers
the full operating range of 0-100% water
cut and 0-100% gas void fractions (GVFs).
For special applications or GVF above 95%,
the company recommends addition of a
compact gamma density system to the
meter.

New lighting ﬁxture suited for wet or damp uses
This new 379 Series lighting fixture is
designed for broad application in wet or
damp environments or as an enclosed high
bay fixture.
With its fiberglass reinforced housing
and closed cell polyurethane gasket with
no seams, the fixture is IP67 rated for
indoor or outdoor use in locations with
high-pressure hose-down requirements.
The fixture is designed for standard V
hook mounting. An optional cable mount
is also offered.

Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition
July 14 – 16, 2009
Calgary TELUS Convention Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

REGISTER TODAY!

Oil for tomorrow
THE PROMISE. THE PRACTICE.
Technologies developed for the oil sands and heavy oil resources of Alberta are vital to more than tomorrow’s oil supply.
They represent solutions to problems encountered throughout the oil industry.
Problems like managing costs during periods of lower oil prices, dealing with labor shortages, handling sulfur, controlling
air emissions, producing oil under difficult conditions, mitigating surface impacts, recycling produced water, capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide, and more.
While it finds solutions to these challenges, the oil sands and heavy oil industry continues to develop unconventional
resources that are critical to meeting the world’s long-term needs for reliable hydrocarbon supplies.
Continued progress in oil sands and heavy oil producing technologies means progress in ensuring a dependable supply of
petroleum products at a time when traditional recovery methods are strained by additional demand from rapidly developing
industrial nations.
The Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies Conference & Exhibition is the premier forum for the people who make this
innovation and progress possible.
Don’t miss this opportunity to present your product or service to a powerful, influential audience. Join the Oil & Gas
Journal and our conference attendees in Calgary this summer for the third annual Oil Sands and Heavy Oil Technologies
Conference and Exhibition.

Land-grab defeat
doesn’t herald a
friendly Congress
Defeat by the US House of a major lockup of federal land provides a welcome ray
of hope—but a ﬂickering one.
In one of many assaults on US energy
supply since the beginning of the year, the
Senate in January passed a bill that would
have excluded economic activity on more
than 2 million federal acres and in other
ways thwarted oil and gas exploration and
production.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

To attract votes, the Senate last year
larded up the measure with parochial
spending programs worth an estimated $10
billion, bundling 150 bills into an “omnibus” package that probably no one read in
its entirety.
The unwieldy measure stalled until it
took aboard a dozen more spending bills
and Majority Leader Harry Reid pushed it
forward in a rare Sunday session.
On Mar. 11, however, the earmark-festooned land grab fell to defeat in the House.
At ﬁrst blush, the House move seems
like a spasm of sound judgment. It’s really
just a political maneuver that didn’t work.
The bill went to the House ﬂoor under a
rules suspension prohibiting amendments
but requiring a two-thirds majority for passage (OGJ Online, Mar. 12, 2009).
It failed 282-144. So 282 representatives—3 fewer than needed to enact the
bill—gave their assent to curtailment of resource development amid recession and of
activities vital to future oil and gas supply.
The oil and gas industry has little to
cheer about here.
In fact, its leaders should know by now
to be wary of hopeful signs, few as they
are, in the current political climate.
President Barack Obama entered ofﬁce
on a strong note for the industry when he
rejected the windfall proﬁt tax with which
many congressional Democrats wanted to
slug producers. For a while, the industry
might have thought he understood what’s
wrong with singling out oil and gas for punishing taxation.
The budget he proposed this month,
which includes nearly every way to sap the
industry except a windfall levy, corrects that
misconception.
For the oil and gas business, the White
House and Congress both remain hostile
ground.

OPEC expects lower oil demand
A few days before its Mar. 15 meeting in Vienna, the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries reduced its latest forecast of 2009 world crude demand by
400,000 b/d for a total loss of 1.01 million b/d to 84.6 million b/d.
“The world economy is in a dreadful situation with gross domestic product sliding into the red for the entire year of 2009,” OPEC said. “Consequently, world oil
demand is slipping steeply to a record low year-over-year.”
In that same period, the International Energy Agency, Paris, projected global oil
demand will fall 1.3 million b/d to 84.4 million b/d in 2009, down 300,000 b/d from its
previous forecast. At KBC Market Services, a division of KBC Process Technology Ltd.
in Surrey, UK, analysts projected the demand “collapse” at 1.6 million b/d.
As expected, OPEC members did not reduce quotas at their mid-March meeting but called instead for stricter compliance with previously approved production
levels. Sources said OPEC was at 79% compliance in February with its December
decision for a total reduction by 4.2 million b/d to 24.85 million b/d.
KBC analysts claimed, “The reality is that in December, when OPEC announced
its most recent production cut, world oil demand in 2009 was widely believed to be
falling by ‘only’ 400,000 b/d.” As a result, OPEC’s reduction target “deals with yesterday’s problem and further action is needed to deal with today’s even worse environment,” they said. Eventually, the odds must favor another production cut.
KBC analysts said, “OPEC countries need higher prices. A $45/bbl world does not
satisfy their immediate budget needs, and it certainly does nothing to ensure that
the medium term investment in new capacity that is needed—particularly in the
upstream—can happen.”
OPEC estimated demand for its crude at 30.9 million b/d in 2008, down 500,000
b/d from 2007. It expects demand for its crude to average 29.1 million b/d in 2009.
OPEC’s production declined 700,000 b/d in February, according to secondary sources. OPEC NGLs and nonconventional oils are expected to average 4.8 million b/d in
2009, an increase of 400,000 b/d from the previous year.
IEA outlook
IEA estimated global oil supply at 83.9 million b/d in February, down 1 million b/d
from the previous month and 3.4 million b/d from the same period a year ago. It put
OPEC production at 28 million b/d in February, down 1.1 million b/d from January.
“Full compliance with agreed cuts…would take OPEC output 1.6 million b/d below
the 2009 ‘call’, implying a potential draw in OECD stocks,” IEA said.
OPEC estimated non-OPEC oil supply fell 200,000 b/d in 2008, broadly unchanged
from its previous report. In 2009, OPEC expects non-OPEC oil supply to increase
400,000 b/d over 2008. However, the Centre for Global Energy Studies, London, said,
“OPEC usually overestimates non-OPEC oil production, and their most recent forecast for 2009 is no exception.” CGES analysts estimate non-OPEC production may be
down as much as 450,000 b/d in 2009.
CGES said, “Mexico, Russia, and China are all struggling to maintain their oil
output and, as reported by IEA, Azerbaijan is experiencing more problems with its
production at the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli complex. OPEC’s estimate that non-OPEC
supplies will increase…could help persuade its members to trim output later on in
the year, especially if the global contraction in oil demand proves to be more severe
than current forecasts.”
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said, “We
continue to believe that the IEA’s forecast for 2009 global demand and non-OPEC
supply are too high and need to be revised lower.”
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland said, “IEA went neutral on the revisions before the OPEC meeting,” with the 300,000 b/d reduction in demand offset by
a 400,000 b/d reduction in non-OPEC production to zero growth. He said, “The ‘call
on OPEC and stocks’ is thus increased by 100,000 b/d to 28.9 million b/d for 2009,
and this compares to an IEA estimate of OPEC production in February of 27.99 million b/d. The demand revisions were priced-in but not the supply revisions; hence the
IEA report should be a market-positive input that will also contribute through a ﬂat
growth outlook on non-OPEC to bring further focus to the supply side of oil in a sub
$40/bbl environment.
IEA saw “a steady gain” to 2-month highs in a $41-45/bbl range through early
March due to OPEC compliance, with West Texas Intermediate topping North Sea
Brent for the ﬁrst time since late 2008.

Technology –
The key to success in challenging markets
When oil and gas prices are high, technology obviously plays a key role
in helping find and produce the energy necessary to fuel growing global
economies. Likewise, when equipment and skilled personnel are in short
supply, technology helps ensure that our industry gets the maximum productivity out of the limited asset base. Today, however, we are all faced with
a different environment – one in which oil and gas prices have fallen to
substantially reduced levels and the assets necessary to find and produce
energy are readily available. Nevertheless, technology remains the key to
success, even in challenging markets, because technical innovation provides the vehicle for achieving the cost reductions and increased efficiency
essential for maintaining the economic viability of many exploration and
development programs.
Throughout its history, the oil and gas industry has continually had to
deal with high levels of risk and uncertainty. In challenging markets, in
particular, effectively managing risks and reducing uncertainty can make
the difference between a project’s success and its failure. Reducing uncertainty begins with putting together an optimized drilling plan that takes into
account all available information. One of the most important developments
in this area, which is highlighted in this publication, has been the development of highly sophisticated dynamic models of the total drilling system
using finite element analysis of the BHA elements and precise detail of the
drill bit/formation interface.
Another important element of optimizing drilling efficiency and controlling
costs is avoiding drilling surprises that can result in increases in non-productive time. Among the technologies contributing to improvements in this
area are managed pressure drilling, advancements in measurement-whiledrilling and logging-while-drilling systems, and improvement in the reliability
and performance of drill bits and downhole tools. Many of the important
advancements in these areas are also reviewed in this PennWell drilling
technology supplement.
Smith International, Inc. has sponsored this drilling technology supplement as a means for helping operators around the globe better understand
how recent technical advancements can be effectively applied to improve
drilling performance, drive down drilling costs, reduce the levels of risk and
uncertainty and help meet the drilling challenges of today and tomorrow.

IDEAS drill bit modeling
and simulation delivers
superior performance

W

hen Smith Bits developed and pioneered its IDEAS® (Integrated
Dynamic Engineering Analysis System) several years ago, it represented a revolutionary breakthrough in fully understanding the
dynamics of a drill bit at the rock/cutter interface and how the bit behaves as an
integral part of the total drilling system. While IDEAS originally was developed to
optimally design roller cone bits, the proprietary software has since been applied
to fixed cutter bits. Today, as a result, every new roller cone and PDC bit
designed and produced by SMITH is first run in a virtual environment and
certified with IDEAS before being run in a customer’s well.
Attesting to the soundness and accuracy of the engineering principles embodied in the IDEAS simulation algorithms, Hart’s E&P
magazine recognized SMITH as the World Record Leader for drill bit
performance the past nine consecutive years (1999-2007) for
PDC bits, natural diamond and diamond impregnated
bits, tungsten carbide insert bits, milled tooth bits
and hammer bits. SMITH attained this impressive
record through the accurate evaluation of drill bit
performance gained from IDEAS and using the
knowledge to design, build and apply PDC and
roller cone bits in a wide range of drilling applications while providing superior performance.

IDEAS design and cer tification process

SMITH uses the IDEAS
process to design both PDC
and roller cone drill bits that
deliver superior performance
in any target application.

2

IDEAS is used by Smith’s engineers as an interactive
tool to understand in detail how even very small
changes in cutter position and orientation can affect a
bit’s dynamic stability, which in turn affects a bit’s drilling
performance. IDEAS provides a graphic representation of
a wide variety of elements that impact the drilling process.
The software details how each tooth, insert or PDC cutter
removes formation, the movement of the bit within the wellbore,
the force and bending moment condition of the drill string and each
element of the BHA.

The IDEAS design process enables Smith’s drill bits to
move from concept to field proven performance significantly
quicker than bits developed via traditional design scenarios,
enabling Smith’s engineers to more quickly arrive at an optimum bit design. With IDEAS, a simulation model is used
to design, test and analyze a bit’s performance through the
drilling of a virtual well and conducting a virtual case study.
Once the bit’s performance objectives are defined, the
design is optimized through IDEAS, the bit is
manufactured by SMITH and run in the well
for which it was designed. The bit then is
“IDEAS certified” and integrated into the
company’s product line.
With the traditional bit development process, a bit’s performance
objectives are defined, the bit is designed to meet those performance
objectives, and an experimental bit is
manufactured and then run in the field.
Engineers analyze the results of the bit
run. If the bit does not meet the initial performance objectives (and for initial designs, it
invariably does not), the process is repeated until it
does. The often extended time lag between bit runs waiting
for appropriate testing opportunities further increases the
development time. In this design scenario, the customer is
essentially a testing service for the bit company, incurring
the time, expense and risk of developing a bit.

IDEAS’ five basic elements
There are five basic elements to the IDEAS bit design and
product development process. They are:
• Comprehensive drilling system analysis;
• Holistic design process;
• Application-specific performance enhancements;
• Rapid solutions with reliable results; and
• Optimized integration of advanced materials.
The IDEAS certification process includes examining
bit performance in relation to the entire drill string and
individual bottom hole assembly (BHA) components. The
simulation software also takes into account the specific
operating parameters and interaction of the individual elements of the entire drilling assembly.
With the holistic design process, Smith’s bit design engineers can account for every critical variable to assure
that IDEAS-designed bits are optimized for performance.
With IDEAS’ insight into bit performance, virtually every

knowledge to rapidly optimize bit performance.

cone or cutter layout and configuration is
designed to result in a stable bit that
rotates around its center, the key to
an efficient and optimized drilling
operation.
Each IDEAS certified bit includes
performance enhancements specific to
the application for which it is designed.
The result is a bit that consistently
outperforms previous designs when measured against the same parameters and objectives.
For example, IDEAS-designed and certified bits result in
improved rate of penetration (ROP), durability or specific bit
behavior when utilized with a rotary steerable system. IDEAS
certified bits are consistently dynamically stable within the
operating envelope for which they are designed. The result
is more stable bit designs and less stress on the BHA, which
ultimately results in improved bit durability.
IDEAS certified bits move through the design stage significantly quicker and with a greater level of reliability and
reduced uncertainty than ever before. IDEAS’ modeling
and simulation capabilities removes the trial-and-error approach previously associated with the bit design process
by utilizing laboratory tests to quantify variables such as
cutter forces and rock removal rates. The IDEAS process
can prove the efficacy of the bit design prior to moving to
the field trial stage. This ensures that drill bits that move
into the field are true candidates for the application for
which they were designed.
SMITH can more effectively introduce advanced cutter
materials by utilizing the IDEAS process. Stronger and more
durable materials work in conjunction with the IDEAS design
process and simulation capabilities to deliver a bit that is
more than just correcting a design for weak and high wear
areas. The result is an optimally-designed bit for high performance and abrasion and impact resistant cutters.

Beginning the IDEAS analysis process
The IDEAS analysis process begins in a drilling research
laboratory where comprehensive tests are conducted to accurately document cutter forces and rock removal rates for
specific cutter types in specific rock types. Smith’s IDEAS
lab is a state-of-the-art facility that provides design engineers with the equipment and opportunity to validate their
design simulations in a controlled environment.
The sophisticated equipment allows the testing of cutting
structures on a virtually unconstrained range of formations
and rock types. The results provide quantitative feedback to
the engineer, who then confirms the bit’s performance expectations or provides data that can be utilized to improve
the bit’s design specifications.
The lab’s and engineers’ capabilities provide the customer with a bit that is the optimum solution for the drilling
application in the shortest time possible. The customer can
have greater confidence that the bit will meet performance
objectives the first time it is run in the well.
Data from IDEAS quantifies actual cutter forces and rock
removal rates. The data is then used for the design analysis
in lithologies that compare to the particular field application
rather than the estimated rock/cutter behaviors generated
by traditional design tools noted above.

Modeling the entire drilling system
IDEAS is a dynamic model of the total drilling system. When
the actual rock/cutter data is obtained, it is integrated
into a full bit design model to determine the performance

characteristics of the bit in actual drilling conditions. As a result, the model
analyzes specific attributes of the well
geometry, the rock/cutter interface, BHA
configuration, drill string behavior and directional response,
weight on bit (WOB), dynamic analysis of projected bit behavior, rotary speed, and how changes in operating parameters
affect bit performance. All are taken into account as integral
parts of the bit design process.
The IDEAS software provides a virtual picture of the bottom hole pattern of the bit, allowing the design engineer to
adjust the design to ensure that the bit will deliver stable,
vibration-free behavior during drilling. Additionally, IDEAS
provides data on the load applied to each cutter in a given
formation. With this information, the engineer can adjust
the cutting structure layout and geometry to optimize durability while maximizing ROP, two objectives that sometimes
are mutually exclusive.
The IDEAS process is used to certify a bit’s performance
capabilities through dynamic simulation and modeling meth-

The IDEAS process significantly shortens the bit development process, and gets improved performance to the customer much faster than
the conventional trial-and-error method.

odology that takes into account not only the lithology at the
rock/cutter interface but the drill string, drive system, BHA
and the total system’s influence on the bit behavior.

IDEAS cer tified directional bits
When it comes to directional bits, Smith’s philosophy,
whether utilizing a positive displacement motor (PDM) or rotary steerable system (RSS), is that a single bit design can
provide exceptional performance when used with a range of
different types of directional drilling systems provided the
bit has been designed to remain dynamically stable. This is
where IDEAS comes into play.
Historically, the perception was that each type of RSS,
push-the-bit or point-the-bit, or steerable motor BHA, required
its own precise bit design with highly specialized directional
features. This still is the generally accepted philosophy
among many bit designers and manufacturers.
However, incorporating IDEAS to analyze conventional
directional bit designs has helped to reveal that, in many
instances, the range of special directional features previously incorporated into a bit served as little more than a
crutch that allowed a basically unstable bit design to drill
acceptably only in a specific directional application. A bit’s
unstable characteristics are revealed when used with a
slightly different BHA or in a different application, thus re-

and enables engineers to fine-tune their designs to improve
durability without sacrificing ROP.

quiring a new or significantly modified bit to compensate
for the inherent instability of a bit design under different
downhole or steering conditions.
IDEAS has enabled SMITH to take a revolutionary approach to designing bits for directional applications. Rather
than offering a line of directional PDC bits with specialized
features for the different types of rotary steerable systems,
SMITH uses IDEAS to evaluate individual directional applications and then develop a bit design that remains dynamically
stable for the intended range of applications and anticipated
directional systems.
With IDEAS, each of the different types of rotary steerable
systems can be accurately modeled individually. As a result,
it is possible to precisely model and predict how several different IDEAS bit designs will perform, in specific formations
with a specific RSS, with specific operating parameters and
with specific BHAs. PDC bits can now be certified as being
dynamically stable and directionally responsive across a
wide range of directional applications.
With IDEAS, a bit designer no longer needs to focus on
stabilizing an unstable bit design. Instead, the designer
can concentrate on optimizing the blade count, cutter

the bit drill faster and last longer. Generally, directionally
certified IDEAS bits can have reduced blade counts, larger

The IDEAS simulation is able to analyze not just the bit, but every
component in the bottom hole assembly (BHA) and drill string.

diameter PDC cutters and lower back rake angles relative
to conventional directional bits.
The larger diameter cutters establish full bottom hole
coverage, generate higher loads per cutter and provide
greater depth of cut to maximize ROP. IDEAS certified
directional bits remain stable and provide superior
performance with different types of steering systems in a wide range of applications, reducing
risk of suboptimal performance should it become
necessary to change the system’s configuration,
operating parameters or something else due to unforeseen developments during drilling. Drilling with a
stable bit reduces well costs and provides a smoother,
higher quality wellbore for completing the well.
In the oil and gas exploration and production business, performance gains at the drill bit and reduction of
drilling risk and uncertainty are always important. However,
when energy prices are under pressure and every dollar
spent must provide even more value, performance gains

take on greater importance. And
IDEAS delivers the consistent performance
gains necessary for driving down drilling costs in today’s
challenging markets.

An IDEAS Certified Directional PDC bit was successfully run on multiple drive systems in the North Sea and delivered excellent performance on both push-the-bit and point-the-bit RSS as well as a PDM. (Trademarks are owned by the respective referenced companies.)

Understanding and optimizing
downhole dynamic conditions
with i-DRILL

S

MITH commercialized i-DRILL® in mid-2004 following an eight-year,
multi-million dollar R&D and engineering effort. The goal was to develop a highly accurate predictive modeling system for analyzing complex drilling
operations and developing optimized drilling program solutions to reduce risk
and lower drilling costs. i-DRILL provides a unique approach to a complete drilling
system analysis. Instead of the common practice
used in the past of assuming generalized bit-effect
factors on the formation, i-DRILL incorporates the
detailed effects of the bit/rock interaction and the
forces on all cutters individually as they dynamically contact the rock.
The software is the industry’s most powerful prewell planning analysis resource. It is capable of
optimizing the total drilling process, including bit
selection, optimization of operating parameters,
bottom hole assembly (BHA) design, and precise
placement of each BHA element.
i-DRILL’s 4D modeling predicts a drilling system’s
performance and behavior using detailed geometric
input parameters, anticipated operating parameters,
extreme computing power, finite element analysis
(FEA) and laboratory-derived rock mechanics data.
The 4D modeling accurately predicts the vibrations

ability to pinpoint sources and effects of torsional, axial and lateral oscillations enables Smith’s drilling engineers and directional drillers to quantify design changes
to drill string configurations and optimize parameters.
Smith’s engineers can conduct a virtual case study utilizing i-DRILL’s simulation
capabilities in a way similar to what the company’s IDEAS simulation software
does for the bit design process. However, where IDEAS tests application-specific

bit designs, i-DRILL models, analyzes and predicts an entire
drilling system’s performance and behavior.
Offset well data is integrated with comprehensive drilling
data in a virtual downhole world created by powerful computers. This approach allows the engineers to accurately
identify the root causes of inefficient
and damaging drilling behavior without drilling the well and exposing
the operator to unnecessary risk.
The engineers then can objectively
and precisely evaluate multiple approaches for correcting the problem
utilizing i-DRILL’s FEA system.

How it works
Offset well data is used to calibrate
i-DRILL’s simulation software for each
individual application. Data includes
details of the physical characteristics
of the entire drill string, BHA and bit.
Information also includes directional
surveys and caliper logs to characterize hole geometry as
well as surface and downhole operating parameters including weight on bit (WOB), torque and RPM. Additionally, mud
log and wireline data is included to characterize the formations being drilled.
The information is used to build a virtual replica of the
offset drilling assembly, formations and wellbore inside
the i-DRILL workstation to model and simulate the operation of the drilling assembly as a function of time.
i-DRILL allows for the analysis of specific target lithology
and behavior of each component of the drilling assembly,
allowing identification of suspect behavior, which is quantified and illustrated through the software’s advanced
graphics capabilities.
Video clips of the simulation accurately show what
would be actually happening downhole. i-DRILL can virtually reproduce the static and dynamic components of any
drill string, including push-the-bit and point-the-bit rotary
steerable systems, vertical drilling tools and steerable
motors. Behavior such as high contact forces in the rotary
steerable BHA, bit whirl and excessive bending moments
in a cross-over sub are only a few examples of what can be
learned in the “before optimization” analysis. i-DRILL’s extensive tool portfolio includes the differentiation between
push-the-bit and point-the-bit rotary steerable systems,
concentric and eccentric reamers, positive displacement
8

motors, hole openers and roller reamers, among other
system elements.
When the causes of less than optimal drilling performance
are identified, THE i-DRILL engineer can reconfigure the
modeled drilling assembly, using the simulation analysis to
correct the identified performance
issues. This corrective action could
include substituting a different bit,
changing to roller reamers from stabilizers, moving the relative position
of the individual BHA components,
changing operating parameters or
a combination of these or other
corrective actions until significant
performance improvements are
confirmed.
When the i-DRILL engineer optimizes the drill string assembly
and its components, a comprehensive report documenting the
simulation process is presented
to the customer. The report contains the results of each
simulation and identifies all of the potential changes that
could be made to the drilling assembly and the effects
these changes would have on performance. The customer
can choose the option that best meets its drilling objectives, minimizes problems and improves performance.

To evaluate a drill string’s integrity, i-DRILL calculates bending moments throughout the entire drill string. This simulation includes a
PDC bit, mud motor with 1.2º bent angle housing, and two stabilizers in a deviated well. Contact forces and bit directional and inclination forces are evaluated to predict directional tendencies, as well
as drill string integrity.

What i-DRILL can do for you
i-DRILL can process a multitude of simulations representing any combination of drill
bit options, drilling assembly components,
drill string designs and component placement. The simulation provides an in-depth
understanding of a drilling system’s integrity
by evaluating bending moments in two directions. The highly accurate simulations allow
the engineer and customer to quantitatively
evaluate various scenarios and then choose
the optimum solution, confident that the predicted performance will be duplicated in the
actual drilling application.
The simulation and analysis can predict the performance of new bit designs
for achieving step-change performance
improvement. It can predict the dynamic
behavior of directional BHAs and identify weak areas in
the drill string and BHA to help prevent lost tools downhole and subsequent expensive fishing operations.

The i-DRILL optimized drilling assembly exhibits substantial
improvements in reduced contact forces, bending moments and
torque compared to the offset well drilling assembly.

i-DRILL can minimize harmful lateral, torsional and axial
vibrations through the selection of dynamically stable drilling assemblies. The result is improved rates of penetration
(ROP), increased mean time between failure (MTBF) in MWD
and LWD electronic components and other tools, and minimized connection failures and repair costs.
Additionally, the simulation and analysis results in balanced drill bit and hole opener cutting structure loading
to eliminate excessive vibrations. i-DRILL develops more
accurate drilling program schedules with reduced risk of unplanned delays, saving the customer time and money. Also,
its ability to accurately simulate the downhole behavior of
the drill bit, each component of the BHA, and the drill string,
allows the aggressive testing of new technology in a virtual
environment without incurring the risk or expense of trialand-error testing on the rig.

i-DRILL solves complex vibration
problems, achieves record ROP
in Peruvian ﬁeld

W

hen PlusPetrol experienced excessive BHA/PDC bit vibration while
drilling in its high-profile Pagoreni field in Peru with a rotary steerable
system, the company called upon Smith’s i-DRILL engineering group to optimize
the BHA design, including the PDC bit selection for its next well.
The drilling problems were causing unacceptable rates of penetration (ROP)
while reducing the life of expensive downhole equipment, ultimately driving up
the cost of field development. The issues were most noticeable when using an
expandable reamer in a rotary steerable system BHA to drill a 10 5⁄8-in. pilot hole
reamed open to 12 ¼-in. Specific performance issues experienced while holding
angle in the tangent section included excessive torque-induced stick-slip as well
as high axial and lateral vibration problems.
PlusPetrol drilling engineers and Schlumberger rotary steerable system engineers experimented with different operating parameters and BHA configurations in
an effort to mitigate the downhole vibration issues, but they achieved limited success. Axial and lateral vibrations subsided slightly; however, stick-slip increased,
causing more downhole problems than the original BHA configuration.

» SMITH utilized its proprietary i-DRILL simulation and analysis software to
model the drill string conﬁguration and behavior. The goal was to optimize
the drilling system including rotary steerable system, reamer, PDC bit and
operating parameters. Results were dramatic, enabling the Pag-1004D
well to become the performance benchmark, at that time.
PlusPetrol contacted Smith’s i-DRILL engineering group to optimize the BHA
design and the PDC bit selection for the operator’s Pag-1004D well. The iDRILL analysis focused on data and drilling practices from three previous
wells in which similar issues were encountered. SMITH utilized its proprietary
i-DRILL simulation and analysis software to model the drill string configuration

the simulation successfully reduced vibrations to allow the
12 ¼-in. x 10 5⁄8-in. section to be drilled and underreamed

Average ROP rose to 37.4 ft/hr on the Pag-1004D well
from only 19.4 ft/hr on the Pag-1001D well, a 93% increase. The BHA and bit delivered a high-quality, full gauge
wellbore at a final inclination of 46.8° as planned. By
reducing drilling issues and increasing ROP, PlusPetrol realized a 15% reduction in cost/ft compared to its AFE, for
a total savings of $1.2 million for the 12 ¼-in. x 10 5⁄8-in.

i-DRILL enabled the drilling team to simulate the behavior of several
BHA configurations and then choose the drilling assembly that best
mitigated vibrations while allowing all of the directional objectives
to be met.

Using i-DRILL’s ability to accurately simulate the behavior of the
drill bit and the reamer, these two cutting tools can be optimized to
deliver superior drilling synergy.

Drilling costs reduced with
objective drill bit selection

W

ithin SMITH is an independent applications organization that provides expert drill bit selection, in addition to drilling systems design
input and operating parameters selection, to its customers. Project demands on
an operator’s drilling engineering organization frequently means insufficient time
for a comprehensive bit selection process, often resulting in less than optimal bit performance, in turn leading to higher well costs. Smith’s
Advanced Services Engineering (ASE) program provides fulltime, experienced and expert bit application specialists as
part of the customer’s drilling team.
The ASE engineer provides objective technical recommendations to the customer for the optimal bits for the
application using a sophisticated suite of application
analysis tools and the vast amount of historical data
from our proprietary databases. Above all else, the ASE
engineer is trained to remain objective and always act
in the customer’s best interest, even when that means a
competitor’s bit selection over a Smith bit. In addition to advising the customer on bit selection, the ASE engineer provides feedback
to our design engineers on day-to-day drilling results and future drilling
requirements as a means for ensuring that SMITH maintains superior
bit performance.

Establishing a measurable goal
A bit’s performance and its interrelationship with a rig’s capabilities and the
downhole environment significantly impact drilling costs. The ASE engineer
considers the entire drilling environment as well as a rig’s capabilities when
selecting the optimal bit. This includes the bottom hole assembly, drilling fluids,
formation to be drilled, crew capabilities and any special drilling objectives during
the bit design process.
In establishing a measurable goal, ASE engineers help prepare a comprehensive
well plan and obtain the drilling team’s agreement to using this plan to evaluate

drilling performance. A post-well analysis is performed
that measures the success of the actual results versus
the well plan and provides a permanent, formal reference
for future development wells.
ASE engineers are on site worldwide in a multitude
of drilling operations including multiple rig developments, exploration wells, shallow and deep
offshore wells and directional and extended
reach applications.

Optimal tools for op timal bits
The ASE engineer brings an arsenal of proprietary
design and modeling tools to identify the optimal bit for
the application. The toolbox includes Smith’s Drilling
Records System (DRS), a collection of around three
million bit runs from virtually every oil and gas field
in the world. The database was initiated in May 1985
and has been continuously updated and expanded for
oil, gas and geothermal wells. This information enables
ASE engineers to evaluate individual bit runs anywhere in
the world. When coupled with Smith’s Integrated Design
Engineering Analysis System (IDEAS), engineers can
simulate bit performance and enhance their bit designs to
optimize that performance to a specific application.
The ASE engineer also utilizes the Drill Bit Optimization
System (DBOS) to aid in determining the appropriate combination of cutting structure, gauge protection, hydraulic
configuration and other bit optimizing features to help
achieve the lowest cost per foot drilled. SMITH has offered
DBOS for 17 years and utilizes a supporting database containing records from more than 11,300 projects in more
than 56 countries, encompassing more than 16,300 wells.
Additionally, ASE engineers utilize Smith’s Yield Point drilling hydraulics and hole cleaning simulation and analysis
software. Yield Point can identify potential hole cleaning
problems in the planning stage rather than during drilling
operations, further lowering well costs.

Well planning
Planning the well starts with support from DRS, DBOS and
Yield Point software and the ASE engineer’s experience and
expertise in drill bit design and application. The well plan begins with the DBOS program and its analysis of offset wells
from the DRS and an array of other relevant information.
The DBOS analysis provides a thorough reconstruction of
expected lithologies gleaned from well logs from the closest
offset wells. The information includes a formation analysis,

unconfirmed rock strength analysis and roller cone and fixed
cutter bit selections.
Operational needs and the well plan are added to the
process, including casing points and hole sizes, well directional plot, expected formation tops and mud weights and
types. This results in an optimized minimum cost per foot
well program that often also includes multiple options and
alternatives to the initial well plan.
The Yield Point software creates a graphical user interface to aid drilling engineers in specifying the mud types
and properties necessary to satisfy rheological models of
drill strings and well annuli.
When the well plan is complete, the appropriate rig and
office personnel are briefed on the drilling program. They
can monitor the well prognosis during implementation of the
well plan. Any problems that may arise are identified and
investigated and decisions are made to correct the issues,
subject to the objective of maintaining optimal drilling efficiency safely and timely.
Upon the well’s completion, a thorough performance assessment is conducted during which every facet of the drilling
operation is evaluated. The drilling team, including Smith’s
ASE engineer, then makes recommendations for improvements, which will be incorporated into future well plans.

ASE Group Partners with Petrobras
to Reduce Well Costs

Petrobras and Smith Technologies ASE engineers mark the success
of a recent Tupi field bit application with an awards ceremony.
Providing customers with unbiased, technical bit applications
expertise is the hallmark of the ASE organization.

Petrobras must use some of the world’s most sophisticated and expensive deepwater drilling rigs where operational
costs can reach $1 million per day. Because of the Tupi
field’s high stakes, advanced planning becomes a powerful
tool that can lead to significant cost savings.
A proactive approach can reduce the chance of non-productive, unexpected flat-time and help ensure that operations run
as smoothly as possible. The ASE engineers can focus on any
combination of customer requirements including well planning,
logistics, data collection or post well analysis. DRS, DBOS, Yield
Point and IDEAS software is at the engineers’ disposal.

Meters Drilled Per Day

Reducing drilling time reduces drilling cost
Smith’s ASE process and ASE engineers enabled Brazilian
national oil company Petrobras to reduce its drilling days
by up to 45% in the technologically challenging Tupi field in
the Santos Basin 180 miles south of Rio de Janeiro. The
ASE group within SMITH helped Petrobras optimize its operations in the Tupi field, which could result in the country
increasing its proven reserves by up to 50%. The new field,
in approximately 8,200 ft of water, contains an estimated
5-8 billion barrels of light crude.
Delineation wells are being drilled to determine the size
of the field, however, based upon analysis from reservoir
characterization studies, engineers estimate that the field
could be 500 miles long and 120 miles wide with a 400 ft
thick pay zone.
Due to the field’s potential size and the magnitude of the
development project, Petrobras wanted an independent applications engineering organization to provide unbiased drill
bit selection and well planning services to optimize performance and reduce expensive offshore drilling costs.The ASE
engineers focus on recommending the ideal bit for a specific
application, including a competitor’s bit if it is appropriate.

Operator teamwork and Smith ASE group involvement resulted in
incremental meterage and ROP improvements in Tupi field.

To meet Petrobras’ well objectives, Smith’s ASE engineers
and Petrobras’ engineers conducted an in-depth investigation of expected formation types and rock strengths that
led to optimized bit recommendations to result in increased
overall drilling efficiency. The ongoing interaction between
the two companies’ engineering teams enabled Petrobras to
organize its bit inventory in an application-specific manner
to assure the availability of the ideal bit for the application.
The study also identified an opportunity for SMITH to
use its unique and proprietary IDEAS simulator to develop,
test and manufacture new bit technology that conformed to
Petrobras’ specific application and requirements. The new bit
was designed to increase drilling distance (durability) and rate
of penetration (ROP), which in many situations are mutually
exclusive, without compromising the geologist’s ability to capture rock cuttings at the surface. The new bit technology is
being tested on the formation below the salt interval.
As a result of the cooperative effort between ASE engineers and Petrobras’ engineers, the operator and its
partners are experiencing a significant savings on this extremely challenging offshore project. One of the first wells
drilled in the subsalt exploration program required 110
days to reach TD. However, due to Smith’s ASE involvement
and other factors, Petrobras can now drill a similar well in
the Tupi field area in approximately 60 days. ROP increased
from just under 2 m/hr during the first well to above 3 m/hr
in the third well and more than 6 m/hr in the fifth well. The
higher ROP resulted in increased footage drilled from just
less than 40 m drilled per day in the first well to more than
140 m per day in the fifth well.

Bit optimization system achieves
lower cost per foot drilled

S

mith’s DBOS (Drill Bit Optimization System) is a software-based process
that identifies the Smith fixed cutter or roller cone bit with the appropriate combination of cutting structure, gauge protection, hydraulic configuration and
other features to achieve the lowest cost per foot drilled. DBOS achieves this goal
by aiding the design engineer to optimize drilling performance to accurately match
the specific attributes and capabilities of the bit with the physical characteristics
of the interval to be drilled.
DBOS has been offered for
more than 17 years. As a result,
SMITH has amassed a database
that includes drilling records from
more than 11,300 projects in 56
countries encompassing more than
16,300 wells. DBOS utilizes this
information to deliver the optimal
bit for a specific interval by incorporating a thorough analysis of
offset well data including well logs,
formation tops, mud logs, core
analysis, rock mechanics, drilling
parameters, bit records and dull bit
conditions.
To identify the optimal bit, DBOS
combines a geologic mapping program and well log correlation and
analysis software with Smith’s
proprietary algorithms for rock
compressive strengths, bit performance analysis and bit selection.
The highly flexible service allows
Smith’s engineers to analyze
various levels of information and

well, a multi-well cross section or a full-field mapping and
regional trend analysis.

Bit evaluation process
The DBOS evaluation process starts with an evaluation of
the formation types expected to be encountered in an interval and the interval lengths, which is obtained from offset
well logs. DBOS determines unconfined rock compressive
strength, effective porosity, abrasion characteristics and
impact potential. Rock properties help identify one or more
potentially optimal bit types for the application.
DBOS then identifies various applicable bit characteristics
based on its analysis. Among the characteristics evaluated
by DBOS for both milled tooth and tungsten carbide insert
roller cone bits are cone layout, insert type, gauge protection, and optimal jet nozzle hydraulic configurations. For
PDC bit designs, cutter type and diameter, cutter density,
bit profile, hydraulic configuration and gauge protection are
also optimized. For high RPM turbodrilling applications,
DBOS evaluates the PDC, natural diamond and Impreg bit
technology options for drilling at RPM ranges from 1200
to 3000+ rpm.
For each of the various levels of the DBOS service offered, data are presented graphically to customers in log
plot form called a Drill Bit Selector Plot(s) which combines
numerous parameters that affect the rate of penetration
(ROP). The Selectors evaluate key bit performance variables
16

over the given intervals and identifies which bit type would
be the most successful for drilling through particular single
or multiple intervals. Parameters include, among other information, bit record information, directional surveys, real-time
ROP and mud log data, rock type and strength data and
hydraulic and mechanical energy factors.
Post well analyses evaluate bit performance from available
data including real-time ROP, weight on bit, RPM, torque, dull
bit conditions and other parameters. This analysis provides
design and application engineering feedback for continuous
bit optimization improvement.

IDEAS Certiﬁed Outlaw PDC bits
set numerous Anadarko Basin
drilling records

S

mith’s OutlawTM PDC bit has become the performance leader in the
Anadarko Basin, a result of optimizing the bit through the IDEAS simulation process. The 7 7⁄8-in. Mi616 six-blade bit features 26 face cutters and six
gauge cutters to provide the optimum balance of durability for longer bit runs and
aggressiveness for faster rates of penetration. Three standard series 60N nozzles
are precisely positioned to effectively clean the hole. The bit
also features an 8.88 sq. in. junk slot area. The bit is
optimized for superior performance in the tough carbonate, shale and sandstone formations typically found in
the Anadarko Basin.
In 2008 alone, the Outlaw PDC bit set six drilling
records in numerous Texas and Oklahoma counties
in the Anadarko Basin for footage drilled and rate of
penetration (ROP). All were 7 7⁄8-in. PDC bits.
For example, Bronco Drilling Rig #6 drilled the Corwin
B 5-29 well for XTO Energy in Major County, OK, with an
Mi616MNSPX bit, achieving an ROP of 92 ft/hr. This was
104% faster than the best competitor bit offset run and
set a Major County ROP record to a depth of 8,543 ft. In
comparison, three offset wells drilled with competitor bits
experienced ROPs of 41 ft/hr, 44 ft/hr and 45 ft/hr.
In another Oklahoma county record well drilled with an
Outlaw PDC bit, Bronco Drilling Rig #42, contracted to
Kingfisher Resources to drill the Branham Trust 1-34 well in
Dewey County, set a footage record of 9,590 ft for a 7 7⁄8-in. drillout PDC bit. The footage record was 27% farther than the best
offset run. The bit also achieved an ROP of 51 ft/hr, the highest
of five offset wells.
In Texas, an Outlaw PDC bit set a Texas Panhandle ROP record of
77 ft/hr drilling 8,902 ft to a depth of 11,970 ft. The ROP was 24%
faster than the best offset well. The record-setting Zybach 207 well was
drilled by Unit Drilling Rig #339 for Forest Oil in Wheeler County.

The 7 7⁄8-in. Mi616 has been tailored
to the formations and applications
of the U.S. Mid-Continent area, and
has become a premier performer
throughout the region.

an Outlaw bit drilled 8,627 ft in the Zybach 207 well in
Wheeler County, Texas, 76% farther than the best offset bit
run of 4,888 ft.
An Outlaw PDC bit in another Wheeler County well drilled
8,556 ft, 38% farther than the best competitor bit offset

achieved back-to-back Outlaw runs which drilled below
11,000 ft with an average ROP greater than 70 ft/hr.
Goober Drilling, using an Outlaw PDC bit in two wells for
Linn Operating in Wheeler County, Texas, drilled significantly
deeper and faster than offset bit runs. Linn Operating’s
Dobson Ranch 40 04 well was drilled 9,240 ft with an
Outlaw PDC bit, 23% farther than the closest competitor’s
bit. The Outlaw bit drilled to a depth of 12,727 ft, deeper
than all of the offset wells. The well was drilled by Goober
Drilling Rig #18.
Goober Drilling Rig #15 used a 7 7⁄8-in. Outlaw PDC bit to

It’s apparent from the above wells, record-setting or not,
that Smith’s fixed cutter bits are the workhorses of the
oilfield. The IDEAS Certified design process assures their
optimal performance. The above case studies verify that
they outperform other PDC bits for the specific drilling application for which they were designed with IDEAS.

Increased analytical precision in
drill bit selection

T

he IDEAS Analysis Report (IAR) is the applications-focused output of the
IDEAS design simulation system. The IDEAS Analysis Report provides an
accurate plan for superior drilling performance, which is accomplished with a 13step process to optimize bit selection. Because the IAR analyzes the entire BHA
and drill string, detailed information on each component such as length, weight,
ID, OD and material properties, are critical to the accuracy of the IDEAS analysis
and recommendations.
To prepare an accurate IAR, the Smith engineer first compiles comprehensive
well plan information from the customer. This information includes well location,
well profile, drive system, directional program, BHA configuration, operating parameters, casing program, component specifications, drill string information, and
dimensions for all components of the drill string and BHA.
THE IAR engineer inputs the complete data set into the IDEAS simulation model.
Armed with this information, the proprietary design software evaluates the individual bit’s performance in the specific application. Typically, several bit designs will be

evaluated and the optimum bit will be identified. The results
of the custom analysis are presented to the customer in a
detailed package that includes a summary of the application
details, the bit performance objectives, bit layout, graphical
representation of the well profile and the specific BHA that
will be used.
The IAR package also includes output from the IDEAS dynamic simulation for each bit, which includes the bit bottom
hole pattern, the bit center trajectory, torque, lateral force
and lateral acceleration. Additionally, the analysis includes
the optimized bit RPM and ROP projections.
The profile and cutting structure geometry (including the
precise location of each individual cutter) of the bits being
considered for the target application are fundamental data input
parameters of the analysis. The
analysis generates a graphical representation of the target
well, which contains a measured
depth, azimuth and inclination
plot. The analysis also uses a
gradient colored bar to indicate
the loading condition of the BHA
assembly in the wellbore, including indications of the BHA under
compression, neutral and under
tension.
The IDEAS analysis shows the
last 30 revolutions of each bit in
the dynamic simulation. In the
graphs on the previous page, a
light blue circle represents the
center of the well at the start of
the simulation. Significant bit vibration represented by high
eccentric rotation is graphically represented as is smooth,
stable bit behavior, which is graphically represented by a small
magnitude of rotations. Additionally, the IDEAS simulation
provides a graphic representation of the bottom hole behavior of the bits in the target formation. A choppy, basket weave
pattern would indicate unstable bit behavior while smooth,
concentric patterns would indicate stable bit behavior.
Lateral acceleration and vibration are measured for each
bit. Significant levels of lateral vibration can shorten bit life
and can cause lower rates of penetration (ROP). Low levels
of lateral vibration maximize bit life and increase ROP. The
IDEAS simulation measures the lateral force acting on the
bit due to its cutting action and the bit body’s gauge pads
20

contacting the hole wall. High lateral force fluctuation is an
indication of bit vibration, while lower fluctuation indicates
stable bit behavior and low vibration.
The analysis measures the rate at which the bit’s axial
velocity changes with time. Shock forces that the bit experiences in a bouncing (axial) motion can lead to bit failure and
failure of other BHA components. The more frequent spikes
experienced by a bit on the IAR graph indicate a greater
incidence of bit bounce.
Axial force is measured as the calculated weight on bit
(WOB). The magnitude of the fluctuations in WOB indicates the
forces that are applied to the bit face as a result of bit bounce.
Large fluctuations adversely affect cutter life and ROP, while
a constant and consistent load
maximizes bit life and ROP.
Torsional vibration is measured
at the bit during the simulation
and analysis. Severe fluctuations
in bit torque/torsional vibration
can lead to premature bit failure
and damage to other BHA components. Smaller, more consistent
fluctuations indicate stable bit
behavior that contributes to longer bit life and increased ROP.
Torque values can be compared
to the torque capability of directional or other downhole tools to
help determine the suitability of
the bit in the target application.
Lateral displacement for azimuth
and inclination are measured. The
analysis also measures the relationship between ROP and RPM. Periodic fluctuation in RPM
indicates torsional vibration or stick-slip behavior. High torsional vibration can cause cutter breakage, accelerated cutter
wear or cause other BHA components to fail. A smooth relationship between ROP and RPM indicates stable bit behavior
and optimizes the performance of the bit and the BHA.
IDEAS helps SMITH to deliver superior bit performance
and solutions, from the “simplest” vertical hole to the most
complex directional and rotary steerable applications. The
IDEAS applications analysis process customizes the drilling plan and proposed solution to the individual customer
and its particular objectives. The result is the optimal bit
for the formation, reduced drilling uncertainty and risk, and
lower drilling cost.

Shamal Typhoon bits designed
speciﬁcally for Middle East
carbonate drilling

I

n the Middle East, ”shamal” is a word used to refer to the strong northwest
winds funneled into the Persian Gulf through the mountains of Turkey and
Iraq to the northeast and the high plains of Saudi Arabia to the southwest. The
first major shamal typically occurs in late May and is known as Al-Haffar, or the
driller, because it is known to drill large depressions in the desert sand dunes.
Smith’s recent roller cone drill bit design, Shamal® Typhoon, was developed
specifically for the unique challenges of the Middle East region’s larger diameter
drilling applications. The original Shamal bit, Shamal TNG, established the SMITH
commitment to provide application-specific bit technology for the hard carbonate
formations found in the Middle East. The new design incorporates the traditional
Shamal features along with a new “Typhoon” hydraulics configuration for more
effective cleaning of large diameter holes. The proprietary IDEAS® modeling and
simulation software integrates the Shamal Typhoon hydraulics, innovative insert
geometries and advanced carbide technology to achieve optimal performance.
The latest Shamal drill bit iteration is setting new standards throughout the Middle
East region.

Computational fluid dynamics ensures optimized flow
The aptly-named Shamal Typhoon uses sophisticated computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) analysis techniques to evaluate fluid flow and ensure that flow is optimized
to clean the cones, remove cuttings more efficiently and ensure that the cutting
structure is always drilling virgin formation.
The nozzle configuration provides Smith’s engineers the capability to create the
best configuration for the specific application. The Typhoon hydraulics configuration is currently available for bits with ODs of 16-in. and larger.
Historically, conventional three-nozzle bit designs experienced difficulty
cleaning the larger cones and effectively removing cuttings from the increased
bottom hole area. The Shamal Typhoon bit uses three Vector Extended (VE)
and three Dome Jet (J3) nozzles to provide the optimum hydraulic solution for
the specific application. With the six-nozzle configuration, SMITH successfully
addressed the problem with a significant improvement in the distribution of
available hydraulic energy.

able Smith’s engineers to build application-specific cutting
structures for optimal performance. Using the best combination of the inserts allows the engineer to fine-tune the
performance of a particular bit for a particular application.
Utilizing the IDEAS modeling and simulation software provides the information to certify the bit’s performance.

Developing carbides optimized for Middle East
applications

The VE nozzles precisely direct the fluid flow to the leading edge of the cones, providing the most efficient cleaning
without causing cone shell erosion. The J3 nozzles direct
fluid toward the intermesh area between the cones rather
than directly at them. The combined effect of the six nozzles
is a flow pattern that creates significant improvements in the
path and velocity of the drilling fluid, optimizing cutter cleaning and the displacements of cuttings off-bottom and up the
drill string, resulting in maximum rate of penetration (ROP).

Ground breaking inser t geometries
Working in combination with the superior hydraulics design,
Shamal Typhoon bits utilize a wide range of tungsten carbide
inserts to maximize performance in a specific application.
The various insert geometries allow Smith’s design engineers to choose the precise combination of insert shapes
for optimal ROP. The inserts include Incisor, Dogbone,
Conical, Chisel and Asymmetric Conical Edge shapes that
can be used in combination for the optimal results.
Insert layouts on the Shamal Typhoon’s cones are precisely calculated to achieve the ideal placement balance
for maximizing ROP while retaining a high level of durability.
The insert options complement the cone layouts and en22

SMITH has invested significant resources in R&D of carbides for Middle East carbonate drilling. The result is a
range of proprietary carbides with the microstructure characteristics that offer a balance of impact durability and
abrasion resistance, a balance that typically has been difficult to achieve.
Additionally, continuous advances in carbide technology
have resulted in carbides used in the Shamal Typhoon drill
bits to provide significant increases in fracture toughness
compared to the carbides in the original Shamal TNG bits.
The enhanced carbide material results in bits that drill faster
and stay in the hole longer than all other conventional roller
cone bits.

Record rate of penetration
In the Ghawar field in Saudi Arabia, a 16-in. Shamal Typhoon
six-nozzle bit drilled 2,344 ft of hole, setting a field record
ROP of 90.15 ft/hr, 54.6% better than the five-well offset average of 58.32 ft/hr. Another important record was set with
the well when the bit finished the hole section at a cost/ft of
$31 compared with $41/ft for the five-well offset average.
A hole section drilled in the field earlier with a 16-in.
Shamal Typhoon held the previous record with an ROP of
76.19 ft/hr and a per foot cost of $33.
This study included three competitor products, one
standard Shamal bit and two Shamal Typhoon bits. The
16-in. Shamal Typhoon bit set the record in rotary drilling
mode from the Wasia formation to mid-Thamama in one
run (shoe-to-shoe).

Downhole imaging complements
directional drilling technology to
reduce drilling risk and uncertainty

P

athFinder®
, one of the recent additions to the Smith portfolio, provides
technically sophisticated services in the areas of logging-while-drilling
(LWD), measurement-while-drilling (MWD), and directional drilling including its
innovative rotary steerable systems (RSS) and downhole positive displacement
motors (PDMs). PathFinder’s name is most appropriate since it is one of only a
few companies in the industry with the sophisticated technology to offer a full
line of LWD/MWD and directional drilling products and services that help provide
the most efficient and cost effective path to the operator’s geological objectives.
By providing real-time downhole data that not only indicates the possible presence of hydrocarbons but also assists in improving drilling performance to reach
those hydrocarbons, PathFinder can reduce customer risk and cost while maximizing prospects. According to Spears and Associates, a leading oilfield consulting
business, over the past five years, PathFinder has
been the fastest growing full-service directional
services/MWD/LWD company, with a compound
annual growth rate of 37%.
LWD technology utilizes real-time formation information to assist real time
decision-making on altering the wellbore path to an optimum position in the formation that provides enhanced production of oil or natural gas. PathFinder’s MWD
products and services utilize downhole tools to precisely locate and direct the
drilling assembly to the target.
PathFinder offers the industry a unique and innovative rotary steerable system
that can be operated in a point-the-bit or push-the-bit mode, unlike other systems
that are either one or the other. PathFinder’s versatile RSS enables operators
to use the best mode for the application. This versatility is ideally matched with
Smith’s directionally certified IDEAS PDC bits, which are designed to be suitable
for use on both types of RSS rather than other PDC manufacturers’ bits, which are
designed and built for one particular RSS.
The company also supplies downhole drilling motors that incorporate Dyna-Drill
power sections for consistent power output and maximum durability. The motors
are designed to operate across a full range of speeds and torque levels and

The PathMaker RSS can be configured
for either push-the-bit or point-the-bit
operation. This oprerational flexibility
is combined with state-of-the-art MWD
and LWD technology to deliver superior
performance in the most challenging
directional drilling applications.

to withstand severe environmental conditions such as high
temperatures, hard rock and abrasive drilling fluids.
All of the products and tools can be combined to produce
the most efficient tool string required for a particular application. The directional products and services can accurately
drill deviated, horizontal and extended reach wells. In fact,
directional products and services can also be used to ensure a quality vertical wellbore in applications where there
is a natural tendency for a BHA to deviate.

Downhole measurement and imaging tools
PathFinder offers an impressive array of downhole measurement and imaging tools to enhance and optimize the drilling
process and formation evaluation. The company continually
engages in research and development activities to improve
its existing product line and services as well as to satisfy customers’ demand for new tools and services to increase their
operational efficiency. The company’s R&D effort is conducted
at its facilities in Houston, where most of its LWD and MWD
and directional drilling technologies are developed.
At the core of the company’s MWD/LWD system is the
modular fixed-collar HDS-1L directional tool with positive pulse
telemetry. The tool provides continuous inclination and azimuth information and acts as the telemetry module to make
real-time data transmission possible. The DataLink™ provides
real-time communication with PathFinder LWD sensors.
PathFinder offers real-time Density Neutron Standoff
Caliper (DNSC) service. While neutron and density LWD
tools have been available to the industry for several years,
early designs had no direct means to account for potentially large standoff-induced errors. The DNSC was the first
LWD tool designed to measure standoff directly and use
that measurement to improve the accuracy of neutron and
density measurements.
PathFinder’s Slim Density Neutron Standoff Caliper
(SDNSC) technology provides customers with more reliable wellbore caliper and formation density and porosity
measurements. This service is available in small wellbore
diameters. Built to operate in high pressure, high temperature (HPHT) environments, the SDNSC has a modular
design for placement anywhere in the PathFinder bottom
hole assembly. The SDNSC tool utilizes the industry’s first
low energy, high output Californium-252 neutron source.
Two ultrasonic transducers provide accurate and redundant
standoff and while-rotating measurements, storing the data
in a high capacity memory. The battery provides over 300
hours of power for use in extended bit runs.

The LWD triple combo formation evaluation log plot shows the
beginning of the hydrocarbon zone with a shale-to-sand gamma ray
response change at X396, a significant increase in formation resistivity and the corresponding density/neutron cross-over.

PathFinder’s suite of LWD tools and services also includes the Slim Array Wave Resistivity (SAWR™) technology
that involves the use of proprietary tools and data analysis
techniques to improve the reliability and quality of resistivity data for formation evaluation. The technology measures
the formation resistivity by transmitting electromagnetic
waves through the formation surrounding a wellbore. The
SAWR tools, along with the larger Array Wave Resistivity
(AWR) tools, are capable of operating in HPHT conditions
up to 25,000 psi and 350°F.
The company’s Survivor™ HPHT Dynamic Pressure Module
technology measures the pressure and temperature of the
drilling fluid in the drill pipe and annulus, providing information regarding the performance of the drilling equipment and
borehole environment. The tools are compatible with the company’s other Survivor suite of tools as well as with its LWD
technologies such as its Directional/Gamma tool, AWR and
SAWR tools and the SDNSC tool.

At-bit gamma and inclination ser vices
PathFinder provides at-bit inclination and gamma ray measurements from the PayZone Inclination Gamma (PZIG)
System to reduce directional drilling risk in critical hole
section (at-bit inclination) and early detection of changes in
lithology to accurately land horizontal wells where planned
(at-bit gamma ray). The tool is designed to operate as two
separate subs. The lower sub (LXM), located directly behind
the bit, acquires then transmits data via wireless electrowww.smith.com

magnetic short-hop across the motor to the upper sub
(UXM), which then provides communication to the MWD/
LWD components. The LXM at-bit sub measures dynamic
inclination and gamma ray units, providing the closest to the
bit sensor offsets available in the industry.
The LXM modular sub can be used in rotary assembly applications as well as with steerable mud motors. PathFinder’s
2-D rotary steerable system can be used in conjunction with
the PZIG modular subs. Additionally, the PZIG subs can be
utilized with PathFinder’s PathMaker® rotary steerable system or an independent RSS.
The PZIG system is designed for the inclination and gamma
ray sensors to be completely independent of the mud motor
or RSS for several reasons. The modular subs can be configured to operate with any type of mud motor power section
or rotary assembly. Also, sensor reliability and operating life
are not affected by motor reliability. Operational decisions
on whether at-bit measurements are needed on a specific
run are not tied to the availability of an instrumented motor.
Additionally, the modular subs of the PZIG system are small
and easily transportable, and there is significantly lower lostin-hole exposure.

fed into the PayZone steering program from the PathFinder
surface system to enable real-time knowledge of where the
bit is currently, which direction the well is heading and the
direction the well should be heading.

iF inder T M density imaging ser vice
iFinder’s primary measurement is bulk density imaging, a
graphical representation of the variation of bulk density
around the circumference of the wellbore. Density imaging is
made possible by the collimated source and detectors of the
density tool, which focuses the density measurement on the
formation directly in front of the sensor. As the tool rotates,
the image covers the entire circumference of the wellbore.

PayZone steering ser vices for real-time forward modeling
PathFinder’s PayZone Steering (PZS) service includes high
quality real-time LWD measurements and a software system
for interpreting the log responses and proposing adjustments to the well plan. In addition to identifying the position
of the well in the geologic section, PZS is used to predict
lithology ahead of the bit. These services can be provided to
the geologist at the wellsite or at an offsite location.
The service components include PayZone steering expertise, modeling software, formation evaluation sensors and
at-bit inclination and gamma ray sensors. The key to the
service is the PayZone steering software suite along with
the expertise of the engineers. The PZS software provides a
working model that is updated based on the real-time MWD
and LWD logs by the engineer.
The software was developed for the geological steering
of a deviated well path. The geological earth model, the directional well plan and the petrophysical data from real-time
LWD logs are combined into a single modeling program.
The software generates synthetic log responses based on
formation petrophysical properties and well trajectory. The
geology model is adjusted to match the real-time log and determine the stratigraphic position of the well path. Real-time
data from sensors located in the drill string are continually

The PZS suite of proprietary computer program was developed to
aid directional drillers in recognizing geological formation changes.
PZS software uses forward modeling to predict the responses of
logging-while-drilling (LWD) gamma ray, resistivity, density-neutron,
density image, sonic sensors to the various geological formations
along the proposed well path.

PathFinder’s bulk density measurement uses a patented
standoff weighting technique to select a subset of the
rotating data with a minimum of standoff. The company’s
patented imaging algorithm employs a weighting technique
to focus the density measurement on discreet sectors
around the wellbore. Because the algorithm does not “bin”
the data, there is no technical limit to the number of sectors
that can be imaged.
Density images are mainly used for geosteering because
of the ability to determine the direction from which a particular bed is entered or exited. Standoff, or caliper, images
become very important in geomechanics and wellbore stability analysis while the wellbore image of the photoelectric
index may provide useful additional geological information.

iFinder features real-time transmission of computed log
data and quality parameters, and extreme temperature and
pressure ratings of 350°F and 25,000 psi. The modular tool
design allows placement anywhere in the LWD tool string.
The tool has a 300 hour memory storage capacity of log data
at 6-in. intervals at a drilling rate of 200 ft/hr. Its long life
battery power is used for LWD and logging while tripping.

Rotar y steerable systems
PathFinder’s PathMaker RSS can be configured as a pointthe-bit or push-the-bit system, depending on the application.
The point-the-bit system uses a near-bit stabilizer to provide
a fulcrum point to tilt the bit in the desired direction. The
push-the-bit mode uses the steering unit to push the bit
sideways, resulting in higher dogleg severity (DLS), making it
more suitable for shallow, overgauged hole, washed out applications and open hole sidetracking. In situations where
higher rotational speeds are required, the PathMaker RSS
can be powered with a PathFinder mud motor, and it is ideal
for performance drilling where maximum rate of penetration
(ROP) is required.
The RSS also can be integrated with any of PathFinder’s
MWD/LWD tools. For lower cost vertical applications, the
PathMaker can be run stand alone in automated vertical
control mode.
The PathMaker system is designed with three hydraulically actuated pads housed in a steering unit. While drilling,
the pads provide a constant contact force with the wellbore
to maintain the steering unit stationary. The toolface and
dogleg severity are controlled by proportionally offsetting
the steering unit from the centerline of the wellbore, enabling the tool to drill a constant curve resulting in superior
wellbore quality and reduced torque and drag.
The PathMaker system is the only RSS available that
provides real-time pad-contact caliper measurement while
drilling. The caliper measurements are taken from the physical pad position and gives the directional driller real-time
information several feet behind the bit. The information
provides real-time feedback on the wellbore condition and
allows surface parameters to be optimized to ensure consistent and accurate directional response.
Downlinking of steering commands to the RSS is achieved
using a non-intrusive patented drill string rotation programming method. No special surface equipment or rig-up is
required. The RSS relies entirely on drill string rotation and
flow commands from the surface and is designed to allow
commands to be sent while on bottom and drilling ahead.
26

Another feature is automated closed-loop control for maintaining inclination and azimuth, allowing the tool to be locked
onto the target inclination and/or azimuth, providing automated control without the need for human interaction. The target
inclination and azimuth values can be changed using a downlink if the well path or drilling target positions are moved.
Lateral and axial vibration and stick/slip severity are
monitored using the onboard real-time detection system.
Severity levels are transmitted to the surface in real time,
allowing the directional driller to change drilling parameters,
if necessary, to reduce downhole vibration and stick/slip.

Mud motors
Cost-conscious oil and gas operators recognize the positive
contributions that downhole motors can make to the economics of many drillable prospects. Drilling motors convert hydraulic
energy to mechanical energy to rotate the bit incrementally to
the drill string rotation, offering significant cost savings due to
higher ROP resulting from delivering more energy to the bit.
The application of downhole drilling motors has expanded from
the initial conventional directional kick-off applications to other

PathFinder launches innovative
iFinder Density Imaging service
PathFinder recently introduced the innovative iFinderTM
Density Imaging service specifically designed to enhance
and optimize borehole geosteering to help drilling engineers meet all critical directional objectives and complex
well trajectory requirements. The iFinder tool generates a
real-time borehole visualization image by measuring and
recording azimuthal density, photoelectric index and ultrasonic stand-off. The iFinder service provides quantitative
formation dip analysis and insight into wellbore stability.

Technolog y Platfor m
The iFinder tool utilizes density imaging to produce a
graphical representation of the density variations around
the circumference of the borehole. The sophisticated measurement is accomplished by using a collimated source
and detectors to focus the density measurement on the
formation directly in front of the sensor. As the tool rotates, the measurement covers the entire circumference
of the borehole.

areas, including steerable drilling, medium and long radius drilling, re-entry, performance drilling, hole opening, under-reaming
and casing cutting, coring and milling.
The PathFinder Drilling Motors (PDM) are positive displacement mud motors that incorporate high performance power
sections for optimal durability. PDMs increase the bit’s RPM
without increasing the drills tring’s rotational speed and enable drilling with less weight on bit. Drill pipe and casing
wear is reduced because the drill string does not rotate.
ROP is increased and long runs can be drilled for extended
drilling operations.
The company’s motors provide increased ROP, better hole
deviation control, and reduced drill string failure. PDMs also
reduce tear and wear of the swivel, kelly and rotary drives.
Additionally, fuel costs are reduced compared to rotary drilling
because less energy is required to power the downhole motor.
The critical components of the motors are serialized to
closely track their status throughout their useful life. The
components are retired from service after accumulating a
certain number of operating hours, regardless of their appearance, in compliance with PathFinder’s standards. After

PathFinder’s best-in-industry bulk density measurement

patented imaging algorithm employs a weighting technique to
focus the density measurement on discreet sectors around the
borehole. Since the algorithm does not “bin” data, there are no
technical limits to the number of azimuth measurements that
can be imaged; however, the practical limit derived from the
azimuthal resolution of the detectors is 32 sectors for memory
images, while available communications bandwidth allows up
to 16 sectors to be transmitted up-hole in real-time.

Customer Benefit
The dataset is processed and graphically presented by cutting
the cylindrical borehole image open at the high side of the
borehole and folding it flat so it is oriented from left to right
from high side to low side and back to high side (Figure 1).
These density images and the photoelectric index image are
extremely useful for geosteering because they allow the driller
to determine the direction and angle from which a particular
formation bed is entered or exited. The highly accurate standoff images are also important in geomechanics and wellbore
stability analysis.

Rotating control devices take off
the pressure when drilling complex
underbalanced wells

T

he oil and gas industry continually explores increasingly difficult and complex environments, in which non-traditional drilling methods are required.
These non-traditional methods include air, foam and gas drilling; underbalanced
drilling (UBD); and managed pressure drilling (MPD), all of which increase complexity, often requiring meticulous planning and preparation to result in a safe and
successful operation.
SMITH offers HOLD®rotating control devices (RCDs), also called rotating heads,
for use in various drilling applications. Smith RCDs are designed and built with a
distinct focus on rig personnel safety, rig equipment and operational reliability. A
sealing element within the RCD seals around the drill string components to safely
divert dust, mud, air/gas, mist, foam or steam away from the rig floor.
The RCD’s main components include the spool or lower bowl with inlet and outlet flanges, the bearing assembly, ,drive bushing assembly including the sealing
element and the kelly bushing. The sealing element is the most critical component
and is the barrier between the fluids in the wellbore and the rig floor personnel.
A seal is created by the stretch interference fit between the kelly/drill pipe and
the ID of the sealing element and this seal is 100% active once engaged. Seal
reliability and sealing element life are maximized through strict material quality
and manufacturing controls.

rapid, accurate corrective action before potentially critical
well control events occur. Integrated pressure management
through a high speed control network facilitates a response
at a speed that cannot be achieved with conventional and
manual methods.
Accurate hydraulics result from calibrated, real-time modeling, which provide a continuous stream of data to maintain
bottom hole pressure (BHP) within a tight safety window in
narrow margins. Continuous pressure adjustments reduce
the risk of wellbore instability, ballooning and annular loading, while driving stability and performance to new levels,
even in hostile environments.

SMITH’S HOLD ROTATING CONTROL DEVICES
Rig site safety is the primary reason for using an RCD.
The equipment allows drilling operations to continue while
isolating the drilling personnel from potentially dangerous
wellbore fluids and gases. Conventional air, mist, foam and
gas drilling requires an RCD for the isolation and redirection
of the wellbore discharge. Additionally,
RCDs protect the environment by directing potentially harmful wellbore fluids and
gases through the processing equipment
on location before being returned to the
atmosphere.
The Smith HOLD RCD is available in two
pressure ratings, the HOLD 1500 and HOLD
2500. The HOLD 1500 is rated for 1,500
psi operating pressure and has a bearing
assembly with a pass through of 13 3⁄8-in.
The HOLD 2500 is rated to 2,500 psi operating pressure and has a bearing assembly
with a pass through of 12 ¼-in. The HOLD
2500 is static pressure rated to 3,000 psi
or 5,000 psi dependant on the spool.
The remotely operated hydraulic lockdown system on the HOLD RCD eliminates
the need to send personnel below the drill floor to release
primary locking systems when installing or replacing the
sealing element. The driller operates all hydraulic systems
from a control console on the rig floor, improving rig safety
and decreasing element replacement time. The sealing
element can be changed independently from the bearing assembly, saving rig time and eliminating the need for excess
inventory at the rig site.
Additional safety elements include a fail-safe locking
mechanism, which requires hydraulic pressure to open.

c o n t r o l

d e v i c e s

)

A safety interlock system prevents release of the sealing
element in the presence of wellbore pressure, eliminating
the need for a secondary mechanical locking system. A visual indicator pin on the head confirms when the system is
locked down.
The HOLD RCDs offer built-in safety features for UBD and
MPD projects. The HOLD RCDs features a split body design
with the bearing assembly attached to the mounting spool
with a heavy-duty lower clamp. The RCDs feature independant high pressure oil circulation and bearing lubrication
system and mechanically energized stripper element to
provide an uninterrupted wellbore seal. Large, heavy-duty
tapered roller bearings provide low torque rotation and load
support while continuous circulation of hydraulic oil lubricates and cools the bearings and seals.
The HOLD RCDs also feature a real-time wellbore pressure
sensor and recorder. Additionally, a dual sealing element
assembly is available to further increase safety for drilling
personnel and the rig floor area.

At Balance, a SMITH joint venture partner, offers automated drilling
pressure services for complex MPD applications

HOLD offshore kit for zero environmental discharge
The offshore conversion kit for the HOLD 1500 and 2500
RCDs is the only system currently available that is in
compliance with 100% zero environmental discharge. In
the event of a sealing element failure, fluids are safely
contained within the overshot riser, preventing minor
environmental incidents from impacting rig operations.

The offshore kit is easily adapted to land applications for
zero discharge compliance.
The offshore conversion kit modifies the top section of
the HOLD RCD with a custom flange. A typical installation
would provide a top flange with a welded-on 24-in. OD overshot mandrel to engage the overshot packer for jackup or
tension-leg platform installation. The offshore conversion kit
is not restricted to just jackup and TLP applications.
Although the offshore conversion kit is not designed to be
a structural member of the marine riser, it does provide a fluid connection to enable flow through the RCD to the diverter
and bell nipple used in many typical marine riser installations. In a marine riser installation, with the stripper rubber
element installed, all return flow is diverted through the side
outlet on the wellhead adapter spool.

Smith’s line of rotating control devices
SMITH offers a full line of RCDs for virtually every balanced,
underbalanced and MPD drilling situation, installation and
application. For example, the DHS 1400 RCD is the Smith
intermediate pressure rated drilling head, rated at 600 psi
rotating pressure and 1,000 psi static test pressure. Its
compact design and large 14-in. thru-bore make it the ideal
choice when substructure height is limited.

)

The Model 7068 RCD is the low pressure workhorse, with
250 psi rotating pressure and 750 psi static test pressure.
The compact design makes the Model 7068 the perfect
choice for use on small drilling rigs where substructure height
is limited. This RCD is available in a version as short as 24
3
⁄8-in. high, which is aptly dubbed the “Shorty” model.
The Model 8068 RCD is designed for use on large diameter
wells and features a split body design with the bearing assembly attached to the mounting spool with clamping dogs.
The mounting spool is available for 13 5⁄8-in. to 20-in. BOP
bolt-on spools and 30-in. and 36-in. weld-on mounting flanges
for conductor pipe.
The Model 8068-G Geothermal RCD has been designed
with several unique features that enable it to operate safely
in high temperature environments. It uses the Model 8068
RCD bearing and drive bushing section for reliability and performance. The bearing section is fastened to the spool and
sealed for safe operation. The spool is equipped with a large
diameter sealing element with an ID large enough to safely
seal on large diameter drill string components such as drill
collars. Special water injection ports enable the sealing elements and exposed seal faces to be cooled and lubricated by
circulating water through the head when tripping.
The Model 7368 RCD is designed for use where space
is limited, such as on workover rigs. This model employs
the same design features as the larger Model 7068 lowpressure RCD.
Smith rotating control devices, particularly when combined
with At Balance pressure management services, take the
pressure off both you and your drilling system for all your critical underbalanced and managed pressure drilling projects.

The Model 7068 is a low pressure RCD especially suited for
small rigs where substructure
height is an issue.

The DHS 1400 is an intermediate
pressure RCD designed for use where
substructure space is limited.

AP impact system solves costly
sticky situations

T

he complex drilling systems and assemblies that could include MWD/LWD
tools, rotary steerable systems and other expensive tools and electronics
mean that lost-in-hole situations could cost the operator hundreds of thousands
of dollars. Smith’s AP Impact System can significantly reduce the risk of this
potential loss of expensive equipment and the cost of having to plug back and drill
around a lost in hole drill string with its numerous jarring tools.
The jar is designed to move up and down the wellbore, releasing stuck drill
stem components by the tool’s impact. The driller controls the frequency and
force of the jar on the stuck downhole equipment. Smith’s AP Impact system
includes the Hydra-Jar AP tool, Accelerator AP, Jar-Pact Analysis Program and a
data acquisition program.
The Sup-R-Jar product is an addition to Smith’s impact system as the result
of the acquisition of W-H Energy Services, Inc. This tool is built with quality and
simplicity in mind, including only eight major components. The tool is simple to
build, easy to dress and extremely durable.
A jar’s application includes drilling conditions where the risk of differential sticking, hole sloughing or other potential stuck-in-hole situations exist. They are also
used in fishing operations requiring significant down-hitting impact or alternating
up and down jarring force. Jars also may be required when downhole tools, directional and MWD/LWD equipment are used in the bottom hole assembly
(BHA). Extended and long-reach directional and horizontal applications may require multiple jars for maximum effectiveness.
Jars also are used in casing swaging operations
requiring impact for successful completion.
The Hydra-Jar AP Impact System is
the industry’s premiere performer for
reducing the risk of losing expensive
drill string equipment downhole.

Hydra-Jar AP
Smith’s Hydra-Jar AP frees stuck drill stem components during drilling or workover operations by jarring both up and down
with an impact force controlled by the driller, who controls the
direction, intensity and frequency of the impacts. The system
works without applied torque so directional tools maintain
their orientation throughout the jarring operations.
Hydra-Jar’s high temperature seals make the tool ideal
for hostile drilling conditions. The tool will perform in every
drilling condition, onshore or offshore, in vertical, deviated,
ultra-deep and ultra-hot wells.
The tool is balanced to hydrostatic pressure through ports
open to the wellbore, ensuring consistent hitting performance
regardless of changes in downhole pressures. The tool also
is temperature-compensated through the use of a unique detent system that provides consistent loading and firing of the
jar over a broad range of wellbore temperatures.
Hydra-Jar’s unique metering process compensates for the
decrease in detent cylinder oil viscosity as the jar is fired
repeatedly, ensuring consistent impact. The tool’s full bore
design minimizes pressure losses and provides wireline
compatibility. Additionally, the jar may be run in compression
or tension, providing optimized placement in the drill string.
A safety clamp enables the jar to be made up, racked and
handled like a drill pipe joint and can be made up and racked
like a standard length of drill pipe, reducing trip time.
Smith’s data acquisition program ensures that all HydraJar tools are tested to specification prior to being sent to
the wellsite. The system uses two pressure transducers to
perform a push test and pull test for short and full detent. A
laser rangefinder device measures the stroke length.

Accelerator AP
In most applications, the Hydra-Jar AP tool should be
run in conjunction with the Accelerator AP tool, which increases the jar’s impact and protects the drill string and
surface equipment from jar shock loads. The Accelerator
AP operates automatically with the jar to increase reliability and ease of use. The tool combines the advantages
of up or down or up and down motion with hydraulic fluid
for maximum jarring impact, resulting in as much as twice
the impact provided by competitors’ tools. Accelerator AP
optimizes jar performance in extended reach directional
and horizontal wells where stored energy in the drill pipe is
lost due to hole drag.
When used in conjunction with Hydra-Jar AP, the Accelerator
AP replaces or supplements pipe stretch so the fish is hit

hard regardless of the depth of shallow or crooked holes.
Additionally, Accelerator AP provides the same hit with less
overpull at the jar. The hammer mass receives 100% transfer of the overpull.
Fluid compression inside the tool compensates for limited
drill pipe stretch in shallow wells to provide stored energy to
create maximum impact. The tool’s full bore design minimizes
pressure losses and provides wireline tool compatibility.

Jar-Pact
Smith’s proprietary Jar-Pact software allows its engineers
to model the placement and performance of the AP Impact
System to ensure that Hydra-Jar AP and Accelerator AP provide superior performance in a specific application. Jar-Pact

with the most effective and reliable combination of percussion tools when
drilling through hard rock formations. The Impax bits and hammers feature several
patented technologies to improve durability, performance, and reliability in hard
rock applications, thereby lowering cost per foot compared with the industry’s
conventional hammers and bits.

Hammer is designed for oilfield conditions

SMITH offers a full
line of percussion bits
that provide superior
performance in a wide
range of challenging
applications.

38

Smith’s hammers are designed specifically for the oilfield drilling conditions. The
Impax hammers feature optimum energy delivery and energy transfer to the bit and
rock. In addition, Impax hammers are capable of sustained operation with larger
volumes of water (mist) injection, a key requirement for the oilfield in presence of
water-influx from the hole. Impax hammers also offer improved durability from a
hardened steel sleeve that replaces the plastic “blow tube” used in conventional
hammers and are capable of operating at high downhole ambient temperatures
without loss of performance.
The blow tube, or the foot valve, is a plastic tube pressed into the bit. When
the piston travels past the blow tube, the lower chamber of the hammer is allowed to exhaust. However, blow tubes have historically been the Achilles heel for
conventional hammers. A blow tube failure can result in complete stoppage of
the percussive action or at the very least, a significant reduction in performance.
Often, this means a trip out of the hole to replace the blow tube. Impax hammers
use a hardened steel guide sleeve to replace the blow tube and thereby improve
overall operational reliability. This feature eliminates any common blow tube failures due to high temperatures, shock and vibration, and fluid erosion.
In addition, the Impax hammers are designed with a larger lower chamber,
which improves mist-handling capabilities and performance in high annular back
pressure conditions encountered in deep hole drilling using high air volumes.
The result is at least a 10-20% increase in water handling capability from mistinjection over conventional hammers and the saving of a trip out of the hole as
the “watering out” limit is approached in a well. Under the right conditions, Impax
hammers are capable of drilling at depths exceeding 13,000’.

Impax bits increase ROP, reduce cost per foot
Smith’s premium line of Impax percussion bits provide
customers with a combination of high reliability, durability
and drilling performance in some of the hardest and most
abrasive formations encountered in oil and gas drilling.
The Impax hammer bits feature 100% diamond enhanced
inserts (DEI), which results in an increase in the drilled footage as well as higher overall ROP. The ability to complete
long intervals with a single bit run results in substantially
less down time and cost savings. Cutting structures and
DEI insert technology undergoes constant improvement to
meet application specific drilling conditions. For a given bit
size and cutting structure, multiple spline options are available for adaptability.
The “PD” gauge feature virtually eliminates the need for
reaming thereby improving the life of the next bit and providing a quality wellbore for subsequent casing operations. The
exhaust ports are designed for optimum hole cleaning, cuttings removal, and improved ROP. The bit profiles a concave
center, which offers good directional control, even in some of
the most crooked hole drilling conditions.
For drilling applications that do not require cutting structures with 100% diamond enhanced inserts, Smith’s Diamond
in Gauge Row (DIGR) line of hammer bits is a cost-effective
option. DIGR bits offer a full range of cutting structure options, while strategically using diamond enhanced inserts
in the gauge or outer rows only. This ensures that the bit
maintains full gauge. These bits provide excellent ROP and
durability in less demanding applications.

from the hole. The threaded retention system relies on the
fact that the right-hand rotation of the drill string virtually
eliminates any chance of the bit retainer coming loose.
Features, such as the retainers, add immense value to the
overall success of percussion hammers and bits technology in the oilfield drilling applications.
SMITH is committed to being a leader in all the bit technologies used for oil and gas drilling, and is, in fact, the
only major bit provider for fixed cutter, roller cone as well as
percussion drill bits!

Industr y’s most reliable bit retention system
All Smith bits and hammers utilize the same patented bit
retention system for increased reliability. The patented bit
retention system is the industry’s most reliable and proven
retention system. The robust retainer system prevents the
loss of the bit head in the hole and saves the costs incurred
from expensive side-tracking or fishing compared to other
less reliable systems. The simple, yet elegant, retention
system allows virtually any bit to be retained, regardless of
its size and spline configuration when run with the Impax
hammers.
Conventional hammer bits use a set of split bit retaining rings for retention. However in the event of a “shank”,
the retaining rings are unable to prevent the bit head from
being left in the hole. All Smith bits and hammers feature
the bit retainer system, which serves as a secondary catch
mechanism to secure the bit and allow it to be retrieved

The Impax hammer’s unique retainer design offers customers the
assurance that should the bit experience a failure, the bit will be captured and tripped out of the hole without the need for a fishing job.

The Impax’s feed tube is of hardened steel which is much more durable than the plastic material found in conventional percussion hammers and improves energy transfer between the piston and the bit.

Rhino XS reamer improves
wellbore enlargement and efﬁciency

S

mith Borehole Enlargement (SBE) is an operating group within SMITH
that combines the wellbore enlargement products, technical capabilities, people expertise and industry experience of both Smith Drilling & Evaluation
and Smith Technologies. The result is a blend of best in class products and
services. SBE unites the Smith Drilling & Evaluation leading wellbore enlargement technologies of the Rhino® XS reamer and Reamaster®, with the Smith
Technologies innovative and proprietary drilling products and design simulation
systems, which include the IDEAS® (Integrated Dynamic Engineering Analysis
System) design and modeling software and Quad-D bi-center bits.
The IDEAS capability to provide application-specific cutter design for drill bits is
also applied to the Rhino XS reamer, designing the optimal cutting structure for
borehole enlargement. IDEAS is used to design drilling and backreaming cutting
structures, providing the customer with a significant increase in reamer and drilling performance.
The Rhino XS reamer performance is optimized with the remaining bottom hole
assembly (BHA) components, including the drill bit, by utilizing Smith’s proprietary
i-DRILL®modeling and analysis process. i-DRILL optimizes the entire drill string, including reamers, by determining the precise placement of each BHA element.

Rhino XS reamer for simultaneous drilling and hole enlargement

The Rhino XS utilizes application
specific cutter blocks designed
with IDEAS, Smith’s sophisticated modeling and simulation
process for optimizing cutting
structure performance.
40

The hydraulically expandable Rhino XS reamer is a concentric reaming
tool designed to enlarge the wellbore for improved equivalent circulating density (ECD) control, running casing and cementing clearance.
The tool can enlarge an existing or pilot wellbore by up to 25%. The
tool body houses three equally spaced cutter blocks with PDC
inserts for both drilling and backreaming. The tool is ideal for
use with rotary steerable systems (RSS), directional drilling
assemblies and adjustable stabilizer assemblies as well as
conventional enlargement of an existing pilot hole. The Rhino XS
reamer has been successful in a wide range of situations including extended reach drilling, backreaming in loosely consolidated formations and
in highly abrasive formations.

Durability increases with the one-piece cutter block/
extension mechanism. The single piece tool body design
also increases torque and load-carrying capacity, and the
balanced mass design eliminates vibration while drilling.
The reamer PDC cutters provide wear resistance and the
ability to drill a wide range of formations.
The cutter blocks are hydraulically actuated using system
differential pressure. The tongue-and-groove actuation system (Z-Drive) traverses the cutter blocks to a pre-selected
diameter and hydraulically secures them in place. Pressure
indication at the surface notifies the operator that the cutting blocks are fully deployed. The cutter blocks reliably
collapse when the pumps are turned off to help ensure a
problem-free trip out of the hole. During casing shoetrack
drillout,an integrated cutter block lock-out system internally
restricts fluid and ensures that the cutter blocks do not
deploy.
Field-changeable nozzles ensure optimum cleaning at
every opening diameter. The large-bore nozzles accommodate high volume fluid requirements with optimized fluid
distribution between bit and cutter blocks. This high volume capability also accommodates fluid requirements for
RSS and directional assemblies..

Rhino stabilization system reduces vibration
The Rhino Stabilization System is an integrated configuration of the Rhino XS Reamer and Rhino Stabilizer. The
integral stabilizer pads on the Rhino Stabilizer assist in centralizing the BHA and helps prevent side cutting by the Rhino
Reamer cutting structure. This reduces vibration, improves
dynamic stability and optimizes drilling performance as well
as MWD/LWD and RSS performance.
The stabilizer activation method is a double ball drop,
the same activation method as the Rhino XS reamer. The
stabilizer configuration is typically run under gauge and 30
ft above the Rhino XS reamer.
The Rhino Stabilization System reduces vibration by utilizing abrasion resistant stabilizer blocks, which feature
diamond enhanced gauge inserts and tungsten carbide
hardfacing. The stabilizer is deployed with the same proven
Z-Drive system used on the Rhino Reamer XS.
Modified internal component kits now allow the Rhino
Reamer to be closed (de-activated) in situations where this
is desirable such as pulling out of hole while maintaining
full flow circulation.
The most recent addition to the Rhino family is a shortened
version of the tool that can be placed below a downhole mo-

Developing and improving ultra-hard technologies
MegaDiamond was founded in 1966 by Dr. H. Tracy Hall,
the renowned scientist who was the first person to successfully synthesize diamond in 1954 while working for General
Electric Research Labs.
In 1955, Dr. Hall left G.E. and joined Brigham Young
University (BYU) as a chemistry professor and director of
research, during which time he continued to improve and
develop synthetic diamond technology and associated manufacturing equipment. In 1957, he invented the tetrahedral
press and later a belt press design that would be scaled up
to become the first commercial production equipment.
In 1966, Dr. Hall was joined by two other BYU professors, Dr. Bill Pope and Dr. Duane Horton, who formed
MegaDiamond to manufacture synthetic diamonds and HP/
HT equipment. PCD was developed by fusing diamond powder particles together under high pressure, high temperature
synthesis conditions, forming a sintered diamond mass that
is simultaneously bonded to a tungsten carbide substrate.
This results in the advantage of extreme hardness (close
to natural diamond) and the toughness characteristics of
tungsten carbide.
Ten years later, in 1976, the first modern PDC fixed cutter
bit developed specifically for an oilfield application was successfully run in the Rangely field in Colorado, opening the
door for diamond bit expansion into traditional roller cone
bit applications and increasing demand for MegaDiamond’s
products.
SMITH acquired MegaDiamond in 1985 and still uses
many of Dr. Hall’s pioneering technologies and procedures
developed over his storied career. In 1994, SMITH acquired
SupraDiamant, a French company, and the Scurelle plant in
Italy in 1996.

MegaDiamond has mastered the techniques for using a variety of
advanced, state-of-the-art presses to create polycrystalline diamond
used in an array of cutting configurations.

PDC development and manufacture
SMITH has become an industry leader by studying material
characteristics and applying new and upgraded processing
techniques to provide the highest quality and best performing polycrystalline ultra-hard products available. The
company produces an extensive line of engineered PDC
products including diamond enhanced inserts for roller cone
and percussion bits and PDC shear elements for fixed cutter
bits and reamers. Grades are designed for specific material and wear demands encountered in specific customer
applications.
MegaDiamond is the world’s only company to master the
three major HP/HT manufacturing processes, the cubic

press, belt press and piston-cylinder press. Each system
is capable of generating ultra-high pressures (800,000
psi/55 kbar) and temperatures (2,700°F/1,500°C) required to sinter PCD and PCBN products. Each press design
employs its own particular advantages relating to sintering
characteristics and properties imparted to the product.
MegaDiamond’s mastery of each of these technologies provides the company with a unique advantage of optimizing

sintering conditions for each product to obtain the highest
quality and performance for a given application.
MegaDiamond’s domed insert products are available with
813 diamond grade for applications needing more abrasion
resistant products and 820 diamond grade for more impact
resistant products. Smith’s proprietary insert designs incorporate transition layers between the diamond layer and
tungsten carbide substrate to improve impact strength and
thermal integrity.
The company’s shear cutter products are available in diameters ranging from 11 mm to 19 mm and in lengths from
8 mm to 16 mm. The cutters are produced with a diamond
grade that is effective in critical applications requiring high
impact and high abrasion resistance. The cutters incorporate a unique non-planar interface design for enhanced
performance.

Continued ultra-hard product development
With its team of scientists, researchers and engineers,
SMITH continues to develop new materials and technologies to provide ultra-hard products with ever-increasing
performance and reliability. Advanced computer systems
and FEA combine to yield improved product designs.
Performance testing is an integral part of Smith’s product development process. MegaDiamond possesses well-equipped
test labs where its engineers evaluate materials performance

Polycrystalline diamond cutters for drill bit are produced in a wide
range of sizes and geometries.

in a variety of functional tests that simulate real-world application conditions. Test data is fed back into the design
process to improve existing products and to culminate in new
and innovative ultra-hard products.
Smith’s aggressive and proactive business strategy for
expansion at both of its ultra-hard manufacturing facilities
includes major investments at the MegaDiamond facility in
Utah and additional press capacity at the Scurelle plant to
enable manufacturing of shear cutters for oilfield diamond
bits for Eastern Hemisphere markets.
High performance PDC cutters and diamond enhanced
tungsten carbide inserts are essential for supplying bits
that can drill both faster and farther and drive down the
cost of drilling. The ability to engineer and supply proprietary cutter designs, provided by MegaDiamond and
SupraDiamant, is certainly a key factor in helping to keep
Smith Bits the undisputed leader in worldwide drilling records for PDC, roller cone, and percussion bits.

Trackmaster wellbore departure
systems provide one-trip reliability

W

hen drilling and development plans call for a complex multilateral
production scheme, or if it becomes necessary to sidetrack around
obstacles downhole, Smith’s Trackmaster Plus wellbore departure systems provide
application-specific one-trip sidetrack reliability and cost optimization. Trackmaster
services are tailored to specific wellbore departure objectives, constraints and
physical characteristics.
Wellbore geometry, casing program, formation properties, and rathole, completion and production requirements are only a few of the sidetrack parameters to be
considered. The system’s one-trip window success is based on matching specific
technologies to wellbore conditions and completion requirements. Thorough job
preparation by Smith’s personnel ensures the wellbore departure system matches
project objectives. Trackmaster Plus operators undergo comprehensive technical
and on-the-job training before taking charge of your wellbore departure.
The resulting one-trip reliability lowers sidetrack costs and results in faster asset exploitation. A comprehensive end-of-job report and analysis are standard parts
of the system package and are critical elements of the Trackmaseter Plus System
philosophy and vital to one-trip window success. Understanding what has worked successfully drives the continuous improvement process and identifies best practices
for future projects. The permanent record will provide the basis for future planning.
Trackmaster Plus offers, among other products and services, a whipstock
system for hard formations, a thru-tubing system, cementing system, open hole
and tie-in systems, and flow-by system. The Trackmaster Plus GeoTrack® system

Anchor, which are non-retrievable.

Trackmaster Plus operational features

Trackmaster Plus wellbore depar ture systems for
ever y application

All Trackmaster Plus whipstock systems utilize a patented
multiple ramp design to deliver a high quality window by
enhancing and maximizing the critical milling processes and
milling efficiency. Mill life is prolonged and a lower dogleg
severity (DLS) across the window is achieved. The fast cutout
ramp at the top of the whipstock cradles the full gauge lead
mill while running in the hole and produces the necessary
kick-off angle to promptly initiate cut out. The result is a fullgauge window within a few inches of the cutout.
The full gauge section extends the window and maximizes
its quality while reducing DLS. The mid-ramp accelerates
the lead mill past its center point, reducing the risk of coring the mill and facilitating completion of the window and
rathole in one run.
A one-way hinge incorporated into the Trackmaster Plus
system provides a flex point when running through doglegs.
This ensures the whipstock seats properly against the casing when set in deviated hole sections.
The mill/whipstock hook-up system is designed to provide
higher torque values while delivering reliable shear performance. The unique retention system allows up to 3° of flex
between the milling assembly and the whipstock for troublefree passage through doglegs in the wellbore.
The standard mill configuration of the Trackmaster Plus
wellbore departure system is a tri-mill consisting of the
lead, follow and dress mill sections. In some applications,
the dress mill is eliminated, resulting in a bi-mill design.
The lead mill is geometrically matched to the angles on the
Trackmaster Plus whipstock to maximize cutting structure
engagement with the casing while minimizing the loads on
the whipstock face. This results in directing the milling efficiency into the casing and not the whipstock. The lead mill
is available with a variety of cutting structures for efficient
and cost effective performance.
The follow mill elongates the window and utilizes the
Millmaster® carbide inserts with chip breaker feature for efficient casing removal. The dress mill conditions the window
and ensures that subsequent assemblies can be deployed
and retrieved through the window without problem.
Trackmaster Plus’ anchors are either hydraulically or
mechanically actuated and are extremely effective for se46

Trackmaster Plus wellbore departure systems are tailored
to the specific application. The standard whipstock system
is recommended for exiting standard steel casing in a lowto-medium compressive strength formation where a 3-15 ft
rathole is required. The DLS is optimized across the exit to
reduce stress through the window. A carbide Tri-Mill is used
to cut the window in soft formations to provide a typical rathole while a FasTrack Tri-Mill is used for medium formations
and extended ratholes.
Among the numerous departure system options,
Trackmaster Plus also offers the GeoTrack, MX Multilateral
Junction System and Radialok 3™ Level 3 Multilateral
System and the OnPoint Whipstock Orientation System.
The operators for the Trackmaster Plus GeoTrack whipstock
system undergo comprehensive technical and on-the-job training before taking charge of your wellbore departure. GeoTrack
is designed to orient and anchor the whipstock, mill the window
and drill a directional extended rathole in one trip. The system
includes the necessary components, engineering services
and directional planning required to exit the casing and directionally drill the required hole section. The system’s one-trip
window success is based on matching specific technologies
to wellbore properties and completion requirements.
The GeoTrack whipstock system is lowered into the wellbore with the milling/drilling assembly. Once orientation
has been completed, the multi-cycle bypass valve is closed
to allow sufficient flow through the mud motor to set the
retrievable hydraulic anchor. The motor is restrained from
rotation during this process by a lock-up system. When the
anchor has been set, the milling assembly is disconnected
from the whipstock by upward pull, severing the shear bolt.
Increased fluid flow releases the motor lock-up, allowing
the motor to function freely. Conventional directional drilling
practices are used when the window has been milled.
The GeoTrack whipstock features optimized mid-ramp
geometry and delivers a quality full gauge window with
low DLS across the exit. The GeoTrack mill utilizes PDC
inserts, which withstand vibration and impact loading and
are optimized for steerability. The mill’s aggressive cutting
structures deliver high rates of penetration (ROP).

The Trackmaster Plus open hole system is recommended
for going around a fish or other obstruction encountered
during the drilling operation. Depending on the nature of the
fish, equipment for this departure can be configured for use
with traditional tie-in type devices or inflatable packers and
anchors. This system is ideal for drilling TAML Level 1 open
hole sidetracks. If using tie-in devices, the system could
require multiple trips, one to engage the anchor and one or
more to sidetrack and continue drilling.
Trackmaster Plus’s tie-in systems are deployed on a
specially designed shear sub, which can transmit sufficient
torque or fluid volumes to effectively anchor and orient the
system. If using an inflatable packer or anchor, a one-trip
system can be deployed. Orientation of the whipstock face
can be achieved by using the hydraulic swivel, which enables
orientation of the whipstock after the anchor is set and is
actuated in increments as small as 11.25°.
The Trackmaster Plus thru-tubing system is recommended
for exiting standard steel casing below the production tubing or other restriction where a 3-15 ft rathole is required.
This is a non-retrievable system and is ideal for conventional and extended ratholes. The system features consistent,
fast and reliable milling performance. PDC cutters can be
added for increased wear resistance. The unique geometry
compensates for the relative size differences between the
whipstock diameters and casing diameter. The hydraulically
actuated kick-over hinge positions and stabilizes the whipstock. Use of an expandable, non-retrievable anchor spans
multiple casing sizes and weights.

OnPoint whipstock orientation system
Smith’s OnPoint whipstock orientation system reduces rig
time during sidetracking operations by providing wirelinequality orientation 6-8 times faster than with standard
wireline systems by using mud pulse telemetry to update
tool face orientation every 60 seconds. The system is fully
integrated with the Trackmaster Plus wellbore departure
system, reducing rig time by eliminating a trip into the hole.
No additional trips are required to orient.
The rig floor display receives standpipe pressure from
the transducer, which decodes pressure pulses into
measurement data and provides the information on an
easy-to-read screen. Displayed data includes inclination,
azimuth, tool face, tool condition, total field strength and
temperature. The tool is pressure rated to 15,000 psi and
temperature rated to 302°F (150°C). The system is wireline retrievable.

With a cost effective, reliable orienting tool and multiple configurations for multi-lateral junction systems, Trackmaster’s wide variety
of wellbore departure options gives customers total flexibility in
optimizing their wellbore departure plan.

and re-entry wellbores. Trackmaster Plus technology enables the customization of the window profile and the ability
to place the junction in high compressive strength rock.
The MX multilateral junction system is ideal for cased hole
junctions in reservoirs with formation properties requiring
mechanical isolation across the junction and for multilateral
junctions where selective re-entry is required.
MX multilateral system components include a permanent
depth and orientation marker, which is set in place by the
whipstock anchor. The main bore tubular is pre-machined
with a matching window profile and provides a deployment
ramp for the lateral tubular. The upper profile orients the
lateral tubular and lands on the PLI for orientation to the
window. The lateral bore tubular telescopes inside the main
bore tubular and into the lateral section. The pre-machined
window aligns with the main bore tubular, and both tubular
sections create a mechanical junction. A guide shoe facilitates rotation of the main bore tubular.

An optional expandable casing packer permits selective
isolation of the lateral open hole. A hydraulic setting sequence for the expandable packer operates independently
of Radialok 3’s setting and releasing sequence.
Sidetrack operations are far too critical to settle for a
“one-size-fits-all” solution. Smith’s comprehensive range of
Trackmaster Plus wellbore departure systems have your needs
covered, from “simple” sidetracks to complex multilaterals.

Large ID multilateral system
The Radialok 3 Level 3 multilateral system combines large
ID access with high hanging capacity to optimize new and
mature reservoirs. The system maximizes main and lateral
bore access with a permanent junction, enhancing completion and production operations. The system meets all TAML
Level 3 requirements and utilizes Smith’s components for
optimal system reliability and performance.
The system’s large ID maximizes reservoir performance
as the main bore remains accessible for further drilling
and completion operations. Full circumference anchoring
improves lateral position integrity. The lateral bore anchors
with full radial contact, maximizing completion options for
hanging and torque capacity. The deflected tubular locates
the window and enters the upper leg, providing maximum ID
for liner hangers or packers in the lateral bore and allowing
maximum ID access for the main bore.
The hydraulic running tool conveys the liner system into
the lateral bore, transferring weight and torque to facilitate system setting. When the swivel and lock-up sub are
locked, the liner and lateral bore tubular can be run as a
single unit. When unlocked, it allows the orientation and
location of the lateral bore tubular without rotating the
liner. The window finder allows the optimum placement
of the lateral bore tubular. The hydraulically actuated arm
seeks the bottom of the window. A spline sub allows orientation of the window finders and lateral liner hydraulic
running tool.

The right combination of tools,
technology and experience to
retrieve tubulars, casing and tools

W

hen it becomes necessary to repair or remove damaged casing, or
to retrieve tools or pipe lost downhole, SMITH has every tool and
accessory for every conceivable situation plus the experience to get the job done
right the first time. Fishing and casing remediation tools include casing back-off
tools, packer milling and retrieving tools, internal and external casing and tubing
patches, mechanical casing cutters, casing scrapers and a complete line of mills
for every purpose.
For example, the casing back-off tool, used to replace worn or damaged sections of casing by unscrewing uncemented casing at a selected coupling location,
can be used effectively in both vertical and horizontal wells. The tool features
nine sub-assemblies, including two hydraulic anchors and a torque generator. The
hydraulic anchors allow the back-off tool to be used in horizontal wells. The tool is
cycled, and, using hydraulic pressure only, the torque generator and anchors work
in tandem to breakout and unscrew the casing threaded connectors with approximately one-half turn per cycle. When connection torque is sufficiently lowered, the
back-off tool is pulled out of the hole and a casing spear is run to complete the
unscrewing and recovery of the casing stump. A threaded connection remains
downhole for the new casing string to be stabbed into and made up.

Casing patches
External casing and tubing patches are designed to quickly and economically
repair damaged casing and tubing strings without reducing their ID. The patch
restores integrity to damaged tubulars in regular or slim hole sections. The slim
hole version of the tool is ideal for small, restricted wellbores or for use below
a restriction. The casing or tubing string must be removed to a point below the
damaged section in preparation for installation of the external casing patch. The
top of the casing or tubing stub is dressed with a milling tool and the patch is run
over the casing or tubing to a depth sufficient to engage the slip.
The external casing patch is available with lead or packer-type sealing
mechanisms. Extensions for underwater wellhead applications are available for
packer-type patches. Additionally, corrosion-resistant alloys and low-yield alloys
are available for sour service wells.

Casing back of tools are available in a
variety of configurations for both vertical and horizontal wells.

» SMITH offers several fishing tools and taps to retrieve drill pipe, casing, tubing
and downhole equipment that cannot be engaged with external catch tools. The EFL
rotating and releasing spear ensures successful fishing operations by engaging the
bore of the fish in situations where external catch tools are not feasible, such as
when fishing drill pipe, casing or tubing.
Smith’s mechanical casing cutter can quickly convert
to alternate inside cutting diameters, increasing flexibility
while reducing rig time. The tool can cut casing and drill
pipe in multiple locations and is adjustable to cut multiple
casing sizes, often without tool conversion, and usually only
needing to change slips and friction blocks. The tool disengages and resets to the run-in position automatically when
the casing is cut by an automatic nut that permits resetting
and disengaging the tool without returning it to the surface.
The casing cutter is available for casing sizes ranging from
4 ½-in. to 13 3⁄8-in.

Maintaining drilling system
reliability requires a commitment
to quality drill string services

A

n oilfield drilling system is a complex collection of many individual elements including the drilling rig, surface drilling equipment, the drill bit,
the bottom hole assembly (incorporating a combination of often very sophisticated
tools with electronics and complex mechanical components) and the drill string. The
performance of even the most advanced drilling rig and a complex steerable BHA
with a full suite of MWD and LWD tools can be compromised by a lack of attention to
maintaining drill string integrity. Drilling tubulars represent a substantial part of the
total capital equipment needed to drill a well, and proper maintenance and repair is
essential to avoid the high unplanned costs associated with drill string failure.

Tubular repair ser vices

Mobile hardbanding brings stateof-the-art capability to customer
locations and eliminates expensive
freight charges moving tubulars to
and from a machine shop facility.

52

High quality tubular repair services actually begin before the component ever sees
the machine shop floor. At SMITH, the first step is for a qualified representative to
meet with the customer to discuss the scope of work, review inspection reports and
dimensional data, and confirm that the connection to be
machined best suits the OD and ID of the tubular.
Smith’s machinists are experts in the machining and repair
of rotary shouldered connections and this ensures that each
job is performed to the API and Smith standards. Once each
tubular is in the lathe, the machinist sizes, monitors and measures all five of the critical elements of the rotary shouldered
connection: thread form, lead, taper, size and bevel diameter.
Connection recuts are the most common type of tubular
repair. The process is similar for drill collars, drilling tools, rotary kellys and other tubular products in a procedure that requires 4-6-in. of material to be removed depending
on the connection type and its features. Enough material must be removed to ensure
that the damaged area near the base of the box or the pin is not part of the recut
connection. Most rotary shoulder connections can be recut and repaired at any Smith
machining facility. All repairs to drill collars and downhole drilling tools are completed
and inspected using calibrated lead and taper gauges and ring and plug gauges.
Tool joint build-up is an industry-accepted procedure to extend the service life
of drill pipe and Hevi-Wate drill pipe. Tool joints that meet minimum recommended
length and diameter criteria can be professionally restored to their original ID at

selected Smith machining facilities. A properly rebuilt tool
will yield a connection with the same OD, seal face and
bevel diameter as a new tool joint.
To ensure trouble-free life for a rebuilt tool joint, SMITH adheres to several processes and parameters. Among them is
that the depth of the heat affected zone must be prevented
from entering the threaded area. A proprietary blend of wire
and flux provides build-up material with an optimum combination of yield strength, wear resistance and ductility. Preheat
and postheat cycles are carefully monitored to ensure that
mechanical properties of the tool joint are maintained and adequate postweld stress relief is accomplished. The tool joint
is machined to its finished diameter, hardband is reapplied
and the connection is re-machined to specific dimensions.

Hardbanding for wear protection
SMITH is known worldwide for its quality hardbanding for the
protection of drill collars, drill pipe, heavy wall drill pipe and
other tools while downhole. An automatic, metal-arc, inert
gas shielded, consumable electrode process is used with
closely controlled preheat and postheat.
Conventional hardband material consists of granular tungsten carbide that is fed automatically into the molten puddle to
obtain uniform distribution of the tungsten carbide particles. A
selection of casing friendly, non-tungsten carbide hardband from
industry-approved suppliers also is available through SMITH.

Standard and spiral drill collars
The drill collar not only is the most common component in
the bottom hole assembly (BHA), it also is the most critical
to the BHA’s overall performance. Hole size integrity results
from proper drill collar sizing, enabling the desired casing size
to be run to bottom. The drill collar accomplishes this by limiting lateral movement of the drill bit in the absence of larger
diameter drilling tools. Also, drill collar stiffness is important
to drill and maintain a straight wellbore. The first 90 ft of BHA
above the bit has the greatest impact on hole straightness
and is where drill collar stiffness should be optimized.
Smith’s drill collars outperform the competition due to the
care the company takes in material specification, heat-treat,
machining and inspection. SMITH can provide roller, milled
or machined surface finishes to drill collars. The drill collar’s
connections are manufactured to specifications contained in
API Spec 7. Connections are “kemplated” (phosophate coated) to protect them from the elements after machining and
to help prevent galling upon initial make-up. All drill collars
are rigorously inspected during their manufacture, including

M a c h i n i n g

s e r v i c e s

)

ultrasonic testing of drill collar bars after heat treating.
SMITH offers several important optional and beneficial
features for its drill collars. For example, slip and elevator
recesses are designed to cut drill collar handling time by
eliminating lift subs and safety clamps. Extreme care is
taken to machine smooth radii, free of tool marks. Cold rolling the radii at the upper shoulder of each recess is done to
extend the drill collar’s fatigue life.
An API stress-relief groove on the pin and an API back bore
box are available as a requested option and are recommended
for drill collars and all downhole tools where fatigue can occur
as a result of bending. These features remove the unengaged
threads in the highly-stressed areas of the drill collar connection, providing a connection that is less likely to crack due to
fatigue because bending in the connection occurs in areas
with smooth surfaces free of stress concentrations.
Spiral drill collars reduce the area of contact between the
drill collar and the wellbore wall. This feature should be applied in drilling conditions where differential sticking occurs.
SMITH has the machining expertise and experience to
manufacture new tools or repair old tools. Either way, the
tools are the highest quality in the industry thanks to Smith’s
rigorous manufacturing and inspection processes.

Tubular Rentals
One of the companies that SMITH gained through the W-H
Energy acquisition was Thomas Energy Services and its Thomas
Tools and Thomas Tubing Specialists operations. Thomas
Tools is a rental operation providing drill pipe, high-torque drill
pipe, drill collars, heavy weight drill pipe, high pressure blow
out preventers, handling tools, cross-over subs and specialized
downhole tools. Thomas Tubing Specialists rents premium tubing workstrings, high pressure BOPs, flow iron packages, high
pressure manifolds, tanks and all tubing handling tools.
Thomas Tools was the first company to initiate the development of high-torque drill pipe in the U.S. in 1986, increasing
the torsional strength of high-torque connections with what
is called the “Thomas Tools Feature.” This feature incorporates a proprietary special box counterbore dimension in
the development and manufacture of the first high-torque
double shouldered refacing tool.
SMITH is recognized worldwide for being able to offer
everything in a drilling system, from the rotary table to the
drill bit. This comprehensive understanding of all aspects
of drilling technology and extensive global experience make
SMITH the ideal partner for maintaining the integrity of your
drill string to ensure total drilling system reliability.

Career Focus In Economic Uncertainty

B

y the end of January, the unemployment rate rose to 7.6% bringing job losses
to a 34 year high. The energy sector has faired better than areas including
manufacturing and construction. Moreover, the peaked interest and support in renewable
energy has led to a great deal of discourse around the so-called “green collar” jobs. This
could possibly result in fewer lay offs in the energy industry, yet more transitions. The
overall reality is the precarious environment in which we currently live is serving as a
catalyst to think about our career development.
Regardless of your job’s current state of vulnerability, it is the perfect time to think
about your next career move. The evolution
of your career will either be in your current
company or outside of it. The decision may not

asking yourself some important questions. What
is the current state of my career? How susceptible
is it to a lay off? What are my options?
The level of lay off susceptibility will help to determine whether or not your path will stay
within your current organization or outside your current organization. For those of you who
find yourself highly susceptible to a lay off, you should get your resume up to date, reach out
to your network and start researching. Find out which companies are hiring, which energy
jobs are active and how your skills and experience could translate into a new opportunity.
Not everyone will be looking for career options outside of their company. Internally, the
short term goal is to make your job less vulnerable by gravitating towards the work, taking
on challenging projects, appraising your skills and expertise and working on building
areas of weakness. Take the initiative, work hard and you could potentially increase the
sustainability of your job.
Maintaining your financial and career security is priority number one, but it is also
important to keep in mind your long term goal—turning this tumultuous time into a career
upgrade. Future tides will turn once again providing opportunity for promotion. Finish out
your road map with a target promotion in mind and strive towards it every day. Doing so
could pay rich dividends.
These challenging times should be looked upon as a catalyst for career growth, not just
by those laid off, but by everyone. There may be hardships incurred earlier, but effort spent
now is the key to a more stable career over time.

Sincerely,
Stanna Brazeel,

ENERGY WORKFORCE

Energy Workforce Opportunities in the New
Economic Climate
It’s a mixed message out there. On the one
hand the media is claiming the energy
sector is the place to be; on the other hand,
energy companies are not immune to the
current economic woes. With commodity
prices down, industrial demand destruction
a reality and the inevitable increase in slow
or no paying customers, energy companies
are definitely experiencing the effects of our
current economy.

Just as consumers have become wallet vigilant, so too are
energy companies. And given that energy companies cannot
control demand destruction, commodity costs, or payment
consistency, that leaves projects and labor costs as the target
rich environment for cost control. We are already seeing hiring
freezes, projects being killed and a number of related signals
that indicate many energy companies are following the rest of
the economy into a standstill.

Opportunity Knocks
Who hasn’t heard or read about the workforce crisis facing the
energy industry? A couple of telling figures; such as 50 percent
or more of utility employees are eligible for retirement within
10 years, or, that Gen-Xers fall 4 to 6 million people short of
filling the vacated positions across all industries within the
next 3 years, are sobering indeed.

Training can be an expensive investment in people, especially
given post-training retention risks.
This doesn’t have to be the case.
According to a Skipping Stone survey which was administered
to non-energy industry job seekers who were interested in
getting into the energy industry, 35 percent of respondents
were willing to pay for some amount of industry training out
of their own pocket. The number increased to over 50 percent
if they knew a job was waiting for them upon successful
completion of training. The number jumped to 85 percent
if the company hiring them was willing to reimburse their
training costs over a period of time.
Given the survey results, the current unemployment situation
and willingness of non-energy professionals to be retrained, this
screams for a low cost strategy that results in a new trained and
retained talent pool. For example, offering jobs upon successful
training completion with a three-year payback program tied to
retention starts to look attractive. If you couple that with a third
party student loan program backed by your company and a
personal guarantee from the applicant, it gets even better.
If you don’t want to wait for people to get outside training
to get them started, a simple and cost effective retention risk
mitigation strategy is a contract to permanent program.

Meanwhile, the energy industry is experiencing a popularity
boost like nothing seen before. A recent college senior survey
indicated energy as one of the top 5 fields of interest. Until two
years ago, energy didn’t even make the top 20 list.

Contract to permanent has a myriad of benefits beyond the
obvious “try before you buy”. Advantages such as flexibility, no
benefits costs, no HR issues, and little or no insurance impact
come with a “contract-to-permanent” approach.

It’s an employers market today. There may not be a better time
to capitalize on this opportunity and when the economy starts
to recover, this window of opportunity will close.

Contract-to-permanent is a viable solution whether your
strategy is progressive on workforce development or if you
are simply in cost control mode. Using contractors for staff
augmentation and project work enables the ability to shed costs
quickly and easily as financial conditions warrant.

Answering the Door
It would be easy to suggest a simple strategy, such as, go out
and hire people from outside the industry in droves, but
the odds of that working and the cost of the inevitable large
number of “mistakes” is pretty high.

6

There are essentially two key issues with hiring from outside the
energy industry: 1) lack of training, and, 2) retention risk.

Implementation
Most human resource departments aren’t equipped to
implement these strategies single handedly. Outsourcing in

a partnership mode with internal HR is the quickest way to
capture what may be a short term opportunity. This eliminates
the ramp rate of hiring internal recruiters, contract coordinators,
training coordinators and other gaps to timely implementation.
To streamline the effort and minimize the number of outsource
partners needed, one way to effectively hit the market hard
and fast is the use of a firm that can provide a combination of
recruiting services, contractors, including payroll and benefits,
training coordination and assist in developing strategies and
tracking performance and budget.

Financial Impact
Consider the investment in the aforementioned workforce
strategies in terms of a two to three year window. The cost to
implement it in 2009 will be much lower than in future years as
eventually the labor market will strengthen and in the current
environment the competition for talent is at a low point.

windfall of activities, any way you look at it, there is a need
to invest in a workforce strategy. Doing so should not impact
earnings to a significant degree and could position the company
for a significant return on that investment in future years. If
positioned right, analysts might even reward such a strategy.
The competition for talent may never be this low again.

Forum: Continued advancement for women
in energy is promising
In the Spring 2008 issue of Energy Workforce, we invited three female
executives in the energy industry to participate in a forum on women
seeking to enter or advance their careers in the energy industry.

and Gas organization.

Existing roadblocks and challenges
Q: Do you see any challenges or roadblocks that still exist for women
in the energy industry whose career management paths include intentions to reach senior levels? If so, what are the challenges you see?
Kendrick: Utilities are facing a workforce crisis with the
imminent retirement of baby boomers and the changing
demographics of the future smaller workforce talent pools. I
have heard statistics expressing as many as 50 percent of some
utility’s workforce can retire in the next 5 years. This creates
many opportunities, especially for women, in the utility business.
Not only as positions become available but additional new skill
sets will be needed which do not require the physical strength
many utility positions required in the past. The bigger roadblock,
in my opinion, are the numbers of girls being attracted to take
science, math and technology classes starting in middle school.
These courses will be critical to the success of the future utility
workforce. Therefore, attracting girls to these classes will be
crucial; inspiring them to stay in science classes is essential; and
providing the right mentors and positive experiences in the
utility business is fundamental to continued recruitment.
Shanahan: I believe the challenges and roadblocks for the
advancement of technical women in the energy industry

are the result of decades of engineering colleges graduating
predominately white men. The few women work in a maledominated environment. Although I believe very few in the
industry seek to exclude women from the field or advancing,
that is not the same as creating an inclusive environment. The
value of diversity to an organization is the better decisions and
results from bringing together a diverse set of perspectives,
approaches and styles of thought to business problems. But
for women to succeed, we often train women to adapt to the
predominant (male) culture. Although this makes women
more effective in the work environment, the women no longer
participate “authentically.” The business loses the value of
diversity and the women have to hide their authentic self.
Creating an inclusive environment would increase women’s
ability to fully contribute at all points in a career path and give
the employer stronger business results.
Nichols: At the 2008 Energetic Women’s inaugural conference,
guest speaker Alice Eagly, author of Through the Labyrinth,
shared her research-based concept that the glass ceiling no
longer exists – there is no barrier to the top. There are lots of
challenges (a labyrinth to navigate) for women in their quest for
the corner office, but there are plenty for men as well. Those
challenges may be different then for men, but the bottom line

of sustainable networks to support career advancements. JEA’s
internship program promotes hiring the best and the brightest
college students for internships for up to four years to prepare
these students for a career in utilities. Again the initiative attempts
to represent the community in its demographics.

Industry improvement
Q: How might the energy industry in general improve prospects
for women to advance their careers?
Shanahan: The first requirement is commitment from top
management. CEOs, facility managers, and others in top
management must demonstrate, not just say, their commitment
to diversity throughout the organization. From that
commitment should spring efforts to have all employees shift
their understanding of diversity from tolerance to others to
creating an inclusive corporate culture where all employees can
contribute. As a tactic to support women, I encourage managers
at all levels to create forums for women to network with each
other, learn, and feel a sense of community. Organizations like
the Society of Women Engineers can serve as such a forum.

Kendrick: I am a strong proponent of a best practice approach
to improving the advancement of women in business. There
are many industries and many companies in the utility
business that have embraced successful strategies that
have encouraged better promotion of women into senior
management positions. These practices start with defining
the business case: clearly understanding the benefits of hiring
women and other groups in the customer base serviced.
Continue by creating a strategy and an organization structure
that can sustain the objectives: including recruitment,
retention, development, training, communication and most
importantly measurement strategies. Lastly monitoring
and celebrating the results. At a more fundamental level
many of the criteria that make a great company also make a
great company for women’s advancement. There are certain
programs that can be considered that truly will attract and
retain women: strong mentoring programs, access to senior
management, career paths and succession planning. But
the basics are also important: great benefits, flexible hours,
job sharing and various forms of childcare may also help a
company to differentiate itself to women.

Nichols: The opportunities are out there; the industry already
provides them! The real question is what women can do to
capitalize on those opportunities? First, I would advise women
to join Energetic Women and other leadership development and
networking groups as a means of broadening their horizons and
creating a supportive network outside of the organization to grow
their leadership potential. Second, seek out ways to maximize
your potential. Objectively evaluate your past experiences,
the value you currently add to your organization, and what
experiences or skill sets you need to work on in order to be the
best candidate for another opportunity. Finally, be brave! Time
and time again, women executives most often credit having
the courage to try something totally new as the primary reason
behind their success. They did not always go seeking their
next assignment. Many were just thrust in a new direction.
They had to dig deep, have faith in their own abilities to grow
and adapt, and have the courage to face their challenges head
on. Those experiences are the ones that really make a difference.

Concerns about the economy and
employment
Q: With the recent economic and employment slump, have you
noticed any changes in recruitment and sourcing activities aimed
at women in the energy industry?
Kendrick: Yes, the transition to a 21st century heterogeneous
workforce has definitely slowed down as a result of the economic
turndown. Any initiative that is not essential to the next 12 to 18
months has been put on hold, canceled or eliminated, oftentimes
diversity initiatives fall into this category. However, the problem
still remains with a shrinking talent pool of the future, the pain
has just been postponed and I am confident that most of these
initiatives will begin again in the coming years in the same form
or a more appropriate modified format.
Nichols: It is a tighter market for everyone, not just women.
Now is a good time to focus on leadership development
opportunities. Consider formal education, taking on new
assignments in an area you have not worked before, or testing
your skill sets as a volunteer outside of the corporate world.
Showing your dedication to continually grow and add value
will only strengthen you, regardless of the economy.
Manes: I believe all challenges present opportunities. While
current economic conditions seem daunting, I believe opportunities are hidden in the news about job losses and are providing
us the chance to rethink how we manage our business. It is an
opportunity to be creative with regard to costs, earnings and

12

resources – especially employees. This is the time to focus on
the best talent, the best ideas and the best solutions. In order to
succeed, we need a multi-dimensional, inclusive workforce. We
are being more deliberate in our sourcing and recruiting in all
areas with these needs in mind, which will continue to improve
opportunities for all, including women.

Shanahan: I wouldn’t note changes for women that are any
different than the changes for men. Some sectors of the
industry are facing hiring slowdowns or freezes that impact
both men and women.

Final thoughts
Q: What else do energy companies need to know about women
in the industry?
Nichols: Many women learn and grow in ways different
than their male counterparts. The opportunity to network
with other women in the industry is a great asset to their
growth and development. It has become obvious to me now,
through my involvement with Energetic Women, that it is
really essential to have a safe venue for women to explore their
leadership potential with other women and to find solutions
to the challenges they experience in their careers. I strongly
encourage energy companies to look into Energetic Women as
a resource to attract, develop, and retain women to diversify
their talent pool and strengthen the organization long term.
Shanahan: The energy industry must fully utilize all the talents
of a diverse workforce if it is create a long-term strategy to
deliver sustainable energy to the world while maintaining and
increasing quality of life globally.
Kendrick: Women and other diverse workforce groups
should not be portrayed as replacing any one demographic…
but rather complementing the workforce and providing
opportunities for better decision-making similar to Abraham
Lincoln’s strong cabinet team of rivals. —EW

Customized and Personalized
Improving Frontline Training Practices

Training and training delivery systems are
changing, evolving to take advantage of the
power of the Internet, mobile communications,
and handheld technologies—the technologies
that are changing society itself. Technological
advancement has made it possible and
practical to shift from classroom training to
individualized learning. In turn, corporations
are expecting trainers to become performance
consultants, with the goal of developing custom
learning content to help individual employees
achieve their desired outcome.
As a result, companies are spending more per employee
on training and the average number of hours of formal
learning per employee is increasing. The use of technology
to deliver learning content has increased and companies are
also spending more on external services like content design,
development and delivery or technology infrastructure.
More and more subject matter experts are assuming the
training role. More live instruction is being delivered remotely
or online and more and more self-paced or computerbased training is being offered to busy employees, making
it even more convenient to brush up on skills or learn a
new procedure. Training that is portable, self-directed, and
available on-demand is becoming popular, through pod casts,
PDAs, or even mobile phones. Simulation technology is also
being widely implemented, allowing learners to realistically
“try the job” before actually on the job.
Companies are expecting more from their training
organizations—to maximize results while minimizing
resources; to prove that the investment in training is paying
off in employee performance; to develop content more
quickly; and to deliver learning in such a manner that it is
more accessible, even seamless with work duties. More so
than ever before, an organization’s training function is being
run like any other business function with increased attention
on operational efficiency, accountability, and connection to
organizational strategy.

14

These challenges are reflected in the top concerns identified
by training and development professionals in recent
industry research:
•
•
•
•
•

Managing training costs and funding
Getting the most out of e-learning, learning
development systems
Linking learning to performance
Increasing training comprehension
Aligning learning with business needs and
individual employee competency needs.

It’s no longer acceptable to hope an employee learns something
at a training session. The best performing companies are
thoughtfully developing and engaging their most important
resource: the people they employ.
Engaged employees are the key to excellent customer service.
Engaged employees are employees that feel as though they
are truly valued at work; that their efforts directly contribute
towards the mission and success of the company. Engaged
employees are more productive and less likely to look outside
of the company for employment.
However, employee engagement is beginning to deteriorate due
to the failing economies of the U.S. and elsewhere around the
world. A recent national study by Modern Survey revealed that
that 21% of U.S. workers actively disengaged. Poor employee
engagement can lead to absenteeism, a lack of teamwork, poor
morale, and low productivity, among other concerns.
It is becoming more and more difficult to find and engage the
right employees. Tight labor markets are making companies
think twice about compensation packages, benefits, and
incentives. Turnover and competition are pushing companies to
focus on ways to keep qualified employees happy and motivated.
Customer service management’s top priority is attracting and
engaging top-performing customer service employees.
Learning plays a key role in helping employees to get and stay
engaged. Many organizations have begun to rely heavily on
the learning function for engagement support. While new-

opportunities can help keep employees engaged. However,
training and development alone does not guarantee employee
engagement.
Additionally a good relationship between employees and
immediate supervisors is recognized as a top driver of
employee engagement. Yet this is a problem area for many
customer service organizations—frontline supervisors and
managers lack the skills to effectively engage employees. A
study performed by the Ascent Group found, many customer
service organizations do not offer basic supervisory training
to frontline supervisors, much less tactics to improve
employee engagement.
With all this in mind, the Ascent Group conducted research
in mid- and late-2008 to better understand training and
development programs for front-line customer service
employees. This research was conducted in concert with
additional research into the recruitment and hiring of frontline employees and performance measurement.
The main objective of the study was to identify “best practices”
for front-line customer service training. In particular, focus
was given to understanding how best-in-class customer service
organizations train and prepare their front-line, customerfacing employees.
Secondary objectives included understanding:

•
•
•

•

What initial training programs are used?
Duration?
What on-going training programs are used?
Duration? Frequency? Pass/Fail?
What job rotation processes are in place? Are they
effective in increasing productivity and customer
satisfaction?
What technologies are improving the training
process?

Participants were also asked to share management tactics and
strategies, as well as identify any improvement in performance.
The study also asked companies to include considerations,
successes, and plans moving forward. Study participants
ranged from 2 to 6,000 frontline employees and from 1 to
1,900 new hires per year.

Lessons Learned
Hire for Attitude, Train for Technical Skills. The best foundation
for service excellence is your people. It is easier to teach
proficiency than it is to change attitudes. Best-in-Class
companies look for motivated and enthusiastic people who
demonstrate a propensity to serve—hire for attitude and
train for skill. Consider potential, not necessarily experience.
Best-in-Class companies have turned hiring into an art form,
not only the process but also the identification of the right
type of employee. In a service business, the employees are the
company and hiring is critical. Work with your recruiters to
find the right candidates.
Communicate Job Expectations Throughout New Hire
Training—Do as much as possible to relay expectations
to students during the new hire-training program. The
more a new employee understands about the job, the work
environment, performance expectations, and culture,
the quicker they will be able to achieve standard. Use job
shadowing, peer mentoring, or simulation to relay culture
and expectations. Revise training content so the appropriate
expectations are conveyed. Survey new students to better
understand how to continually refine the process and
minimize new-hire surprise.
Emphasize the Importance of Customer Service in the Training
Process—Make sure that students know up front about your
organizational commitment to customer service. Stress the
importance of customer service and customer satisfaction
throughout the new-hire training program. Do as much as
possible to integrate the “Customer Experience” into Training
Program—so students understand customer expectations
and appreciate the customer perspective. Use simulation,
role-playing, and mentoring to convey the correct “customer
experience”. On average, our participants spend about 20
percent of new-hire training hours on soft-skills, usually
integrated into the new-hire training program.
Engage New Hires with “Hands-On” Training, Customized
to Individual Learning Styles—Research shows a growth in
more interactive, hands-on training opportunities for new
hires—role playing, simulation, peer mentoring. Handson experiences help internalize learning, incorporate more
“learning by doing” opportunities into your new-hire program.
Hands-on learning can also be used to drive assessment
so that trainers can measure both factual knowledge and
comprehension. Additionally, training comprehension is
increased through individualized training—training tailored

to each students individual learning style. Smaller class sizes,
modular training, and self-paced activities help students learn
at their own pace.
Mentoring & Monitoring Ease the Transition to the Floor—
Participants use a combination of one-on-one mentoring and
frequent call monitoring to help new hires transition to the
floor. Many companies also employ “nesting”—pod on the floor
dedicated to new hires— to facilitate more extensive coaching
and one-on-one assistance until the team is up-to-standard.
Another approach that has been successful is the creation of an
OJT manager to shepherd new-hire and ongoing OJT efforts.
Maximize Intranet and Internet Resources and other
Technologies to Enhance Training and Job Aids—Newer
technologies offer the opportunity to customize learning and
make it more accessible. Investigate opportunities to deliver
online or computer-based training. Self-paced training is
inherently customized to individual learning speeds and
styles. Training that is portable, self-directed, and available
on-demand, through pod casts, PDAs, or mobile phones, will
be more convenient and more appealing for many employees.
Simulation technologies allow learners to “try the job” before
actually being on the job, creating a more realistic training
environment. Research also shows a growth in the use of webbased meeting applications, such as WebEx, GoTo Meeting,
and LiveMeeting, to facilitate distance learning and to reduce
training costs.
Integrate Training with Quality Assurance and Operational
Excellence to Facilitate Continual Improvement and Preemptive Targeted Training. To ensure successful continuous
improvement, encourage training groups to work closely
with quality assurance and operational excellence groups.

Evolve Your Training Resources. As technology becomes
more specialized and learning becomes more personalized,
trainers will assume more of a performance consultant role.
Make sure your trainers have the appropriate training and
resources to make the transition. Many companies have a
difficult time balancing the needs of the business to meet
service level goals and the need to train and develop frontline
employees. Make the time to adequately train your frontline
customer service resources.

Provide Supervisors with Training on How to Coach
and Engage Employees. Organizations reporting more
highly engaged workers actively promoting a culture
of engagement by ensuring that organizational leaders,
including immediate supervisors, are skilled in the area
of engagement improvement. After all, having a good
relationship between employees and immediate supervisors
is a top driver of employee engagement. Yet, many frontline
supervisors are lacking in basic supervisory skills, much
less tactics for engaging employees. A study by the Ascent
Group found that only 57 percent of participants have a
formal supervisory (coach) training program for front-line
customer service employees.

Make Time for Training. Many companies have a difficult time
balancing the day-to-day needs of the business and the need
to train and develop frontline employees. Make the time to
adequately train and prepare your frontline customer service
resources. Make sure they are equipped and trained to handle
all situations. Refresh training periodically to keep employees
in top performance and up-to-date on customer service and
technical skills. —EW

This will encourage the link between learning and
performance—making sure the training group is equipping
employees to successfully perform as well as making sure any
operational changes are reflected in training. At the same time,
underperforming employees can receive targeted training.

Feedwater Heater
Level Problems?

The World Wide Leader in Level
Measurements for Liquids
The MagWave has a proven record with power plant users around the
globe with a substantial increase in feedwater heater performance. The
MagWave combines a highly visible magnetic level indicator with the
true level measurement of a guided wave radar transmitter. Featuring
single probe transmitters in a standard 1.5 inch secondary chamber,
the MagWave provides the measurement capabilities of a coaxial
probe without the potential for fouling. Redundant level control can be
achieved by adding a magnetostrictive transmitter or switches to the float
chamber.
Let K-TEK assist you with your next level measurement solution, call
us at 800-735-5835 or visit our website at www.ktekcorp.com/
pbgmagwave.

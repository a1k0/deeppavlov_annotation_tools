upsets from water slugs and
other unpredictable situations
that have damaged internals,
resulting in diluent losses and
high vacuum unit overhead condensable oil. Diluent is neither
cheap nor plentiful, and high
vacuum column operating pressure will reduce overall liquid
volume yields. And if the design
of the delayed coker fractionator
is based on today’s experience
with conventional heavy feedstocks you will be lucky to run

Oil Sands Crude
– Profits and
Problems?
Canadian bitumen production
currently runs about 1 MMbpd,
with some being sold as Synbit
and Dilbit. Over the next 10-12
years output is expected to
increase to 3.5 MMbpd and more
refiners will begin investing to
process it and come to depend
on the Synbit and Dilbit for a
significant part of their supply.
Few today, however, have ever
processed these feeds at high
blend ratios, and are unaware
that conventional process and
equipment designs are not up
to the job. Canadian oil sands

feedstocks are extremely hard
to desalt, difficult to vaporize,
thermally unstable, corrosive, and
produce high di-olefin product
from the coker. If you intend to
lock into a long-term supply,
therefore, it is imperative that you
consider reliability and run length
from a particular design.
Too low tube velocity in the
vacuum heater tubes will lead to
precipitation of asphaltenes. Too
fast a flow rate will erode the
tube bends. If coil layout, burner
configuration and steam rate are
not correct, run length will be
measured in months, not years.
Diluent recovery unit designs

What all this means is that
special process and equipment
designs are needed to satisfy
the special demands of processing oil sands crudes. Such
processes are not generated by
computer based designers who
have little or no experience and
never leave the office. They are
developed only by engineers
with know-how who have real
experience wearing Nomex® suits
and measuring true unit performance in Northern Alberta.
Shouldn’t this be kept in mind
by those considering long term
supply agreements?

For a discussion of factors
involved in designing refinery units
to process difficult oil sands feedstocks, ask for Technical Papers
#234 and 238.

General

Interest

WoodMac: Operators still vexed by high costs
High oil prices have not resulted in high returns on projects
because of an increase in exploration costs and the taxes earned by
host governments, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie Ltd., Edinburgh.
Operators now need to assume an oil price of $70/bbl to earn
close to 15% on exploration, delegates at International Petroleum
Week in London were told. Alan Murray, WoodMac exploration service manager, said, “Cost increases mean that pretax margins on
new fields have not increased with oil prices.”
Many host governments such as the UK, Algeria, and Bolivia
changed their fiscal regime as oil prices soared, leaving fiscal certainty a major issue for companies. This is having the greatest impact on exploration economics, Murray said. Other governments
such as India, Malaysia, and Angola have tried to capture the upside
in their progressive production-sharing contracts, which allow
them to benefit if oil prices increased.
Companies are using different methods to build on their assets—either through exploration programs, mergers and acquisitions, or participating in developing major resource opportunities
such as Russia’s Shtokman gas field in the Barents Sea.
But dry holes remain a major risk with exploration, and high
development costs are key problems in a volatile market. Pursuing
M&A deals also is costly, with the risk high of overpaying for assets
in a high-priced environment.
“Exploration is the better option as a resource capture strategy
because this has better returns and allows more flexibility compared with other strategies,” Murray said.

IP Week: Technology to aid in skills shortage
Technology will aid in improving the productivity of skilled
labor as the petroleum industry struggles to attract and retain new
recruits, IP Week delegates were told in London.
Antoine Rosand, a senior executive with Schlumberger Business
Consulting, said remote, real-time drilling centers with features
such as model-based surveillance and integrated well planning
would enable companies to boost production and handle risk better.
Encouraging new entrants to pursue petroleum careers would
be tougher in the West, compared with Africa and Asia, where the
energy industry has a more acceptable public image and people
compete for jobs in the industry. India and China in particular are
producing thousands of graduates for the petroleum sector. “Most
universities are still based in the West, but they need people who
attend them to become technical leaders and innovators to bring in
students from local areas,” Rosand added.
Although the exploration and production industry has sharply

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

increased its recruitment of geologists, geophysicists, and petroleum engineers, global graduate supply is barely meeting the industry’s needs, Rosand said. For 2006-10, the net supply of geologists and geophysicists entering the E&P industry is expected to be
60% and for petroleum engineers, 80%.

UK subsea sector rises to £4.3 billion in value
The UK subsea oil and gas sector has grown by almost 30% in
value to £4.3 billion in 2007, according to industry association
Subsea UK.
“The year-on-year growth rate...exceeds market expectations,
with further increases expected for 2007-08,” Subsea UK said.
Exports, an important element for companies involved in the
subsea sector, constitute 50% of revenues and are expected to grow
dramatically compared with the domestic market. Exports have
risen by 26%, increasing at a rate similar to market growth.
But the UK risks losing its global leadership position because
companies are finding it challenging to find qualified engineers and
rapidly deliver new technology to the market, Subsea UK said.
Industry collaboration with the support of government and academia is vital to developing skilled people and an effective technology program, Subsea UK noted.

CERA: Collaboration key for energy industry
Company collaboration will be essential to address the energy
industry’s changing dynamics as competition increases for resources and as fiscal terms become more stringent, said StatoilHydro AS
Chief Executive Helge Lund.
Speaking at CERA Week in Houston Feb. 13, Lund stressed that
exploration has become more difficult because of harsher environments, heavier oils, and tougher projects. “Politically, resource
nationalism is an emerging reality,” Lund said.
The merger of Statoil and Hydro has given the company the
clout to face the challenges with confidence. Although companies
have prospered from high commodity prices, there is now limited
access to exploration and production opportunities, which has intensified competition for them.
“I think we are all now faced with a new game: How to accommodate interests and expectations in a world that has prospered
even [with oil at] $50-100/bbl,” Lund said.
He argued that the industry is now in a phase of realignment
and rebalancing of business models where companies must align
interests to create genuine successful partnerships.
But any downturn in the US economy is likely to affect economies in other countries and their demand for oil. “The uncertainty
is bigger than it has been in the past,” Lund said. ✦

Development

BP sets 2010 target for Libya exploration well
BP PLC plans to drill its first onshore well in Libya’s Ghadame
basin in 2010, assuming it can secure the necessary rigs, said BP
Exploration Pres. Libya Peter Manoogian at International Petroleum
Week in London.
BP will invest more than $2 billion in its work program, which
will include the drilling of 17 exploratory wells.
Manoogian said he remains “very optimistic” about onshore
development, as the company knows the basin well. “We are targeting gas accumulations, and if we find any, then production
could start in 2018.”
Seismic acquisition will begin in the third quarter. Although the
company’s strategy in North Africa is gas, if it found oil, that would
not be “a bad thing,” it said, adding, “We will monetize the oil if
it’s found, and that is covered in our contract with [Libya’s National
Oil Co.]”
Last year BP and partner Libya Investment Corp. signed an
agreement with NOC to explore 54,000 sq km of the Ghadames
and offshore frontier Sirt basins (OGJ Online, June 1, 2007).
If hydrocarbons are found, offshore production could start in
2020, Manoogian added. Sirte is challenging, however, because it
is in deep water with seismic imaging issues, and it is 300 km from
the nearest well.
With the Ghadames basin holding tight gas, there are complex
reservoirs, and BP will utilize advanced drilling and completion
technology during its exploration program.
NOC, through an aggressive offshore and frontier exploration
program, wants to boost Libya’s oil reserves to 20 billion boe under a plan covering 2005-15.
NOC expects to increase production to 3.5 million b/d by 2020
by encouraging the drilling of at least 50 wildcats/year and acquiring at least 4,000 sq km/year of 3D seismic data and 10,000 km/
year of 2D seismic data.

BPZ Energy Inc. expects to restart production of its 21XD and
14D wells within 3 weeks. The wells in Corvina field off northwestern Peru were shut in following an accident involving a BPZchartered tanker.
A Peruvian Navy tanker, the Supe, caught fire and sank on Jan
30, resulting in the death of one sailor and serious injuries to four
other sailors (OGJ, Feb. 11, 2008, Newsletter).
The tanker, being used for oil storage, was moored near BPZ’s
CX-11 platform in Block Z-1. Consequently, platform operations
were halted. The 21XD and 14D wells produced 4,200 b/d of oil
when they were shut in. The platform and wells had no fire damage.
BPZ hired Clean Caribbean and Americas (CCA) to conduct an
environmental damage assessment. CCA concluded most of the
1,300 bbl of oil in the tanker was burned.

Manoogian said: “We think that partnerships between international oil companies and national oil companies are desirable. The
transparency in regulation and its proximity to Europe makes Libya
an attractive investment.”
But fierce competition between IOCs in accessing new hydrocarbon resources led them to reduce their share of benefits in bidding for acreage under Libya’s recent gas licensing round, Manoogian said. “We can’t say that was imposed by the NOC. IOCs have to
take bigger risks because of the competition for resources.”

ONGC, Shell ink NELP-VII bids, joint projects
India’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and Royal Dutch Shell
PLC recently revised their joint participation memorandum of understanding for projects to be auctioned in the forthcoming seventh round of India’s New Exploration Licensing Policy VII.
The original MOU was aimed at cooperation in field optimization using Shell’s proprietary enhanced recovery technology and
in other areas such as LNG importation, development of coalbed
methane, underground and surface coal gasification projects, refinery upgrades, and trading and development of supply chains.
The exploration and production giants have agreed to evaluate
jointly setting up surface coal gasification facilities to create synthesis gas for power generation or other uses.
They also plan to jointly explore opportunities for technology
induction in field optimization and integrated brownfield development in mutually agreed assets.
Shell will provide technical knowledge, including operational
experience.
Depending on the outcome of a planned prefeasibility study,
Shell may commission a detailed feasibility study to evaluate the
possibility of taking equity in such projects under a separate licensing agreement.
The energy majors also agreed to study the feasibility of gasifying petcoke produced by ONGC subsidiary Mangalore Refinery &
Petrochemicals Ltd. ✦

Petroleum Indonesia Ltd. is the lead operator for the consortium,
and each company is responsible for its own committed wells.
However the group is now planning products procurement and

field off Espirito Santo state, where it will be installed in 4,100 ft of
water. The field produces 17º gravity oil, according to Petrobras.
Petrobras also awarded SBM a $63.55 million, 3-year operating
contract.
In January 2007 Petrobras canceled orders for the construction
of the P-55 platform, which would have had the capacity to produce 180,000 b/d of oil from Roncador field off Rio de Janeiro
state, as well as construction of the P-57 FPSO because of excessive
cost.

Petrobras lets contract for P-57 FPSO unit
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) reported signing a $1.195
billion turnkey contract for the construction of the P-57 floating
production, storage, and offloading unit with Single Buoy Moorings Inc. (SBM). The P-57 FPSO will be ready in 3 years and will
help Brazil reach its production goal of 3.45 million boe/d by
2015. Current production is about 1.85 million boe/d.
Separately, SBM Offshore NL said the P-57 FPSO would likely be
converted in Singapore using one of SBM’s very large crude carriers
in inventory, the Accord. Topsides will be integrated in Brazil, “in
accordance with new local content requirements.”
Petrobras said 65% national content is required and the topsides
work would be completed at Brasfels, in Angra dos Reis, Rio de
Janeiro state.
The P-57 will have the capacity to process 180,000 b/d and

Alon USA updates Big Spring reﬁnery after ﬁre
Independent Dallas refiner and marketer Alon USA Energy Inc.
reported last week that all but one of the four workers injured in
the early morning Feb. 18 explosion and fire at its 70,000 b/d Big
Spring, Tex., refinery have been released from the hospital.
“The cause of the explosion, which occurred in the area around
the propylene splitter unit, has not yet been determined,” Alon
USA said. “However, the fire has been extinguished, allowing the
investigation to begin as soon as reasonably possible.”
The extent of the damage is still being evaluated, but an initial
assessment showed that the propylene recovery unit was destroyed
and equipment in the alkylation and gas concentration units were
damaged in the fire, the company said.
The one remaining injured employee was treated for burns and
at presstime last week was in stable condition, Alon USA said.
Alon USA’s Big Spring refinery lies 290 miles west of Dallas
in west-central Texas. The facility employs about 170 workers and
is one of four refineries owned by Alon USA, which was formed
when Alon Israel Oil Co. Ltd. acquired certain US assets from Total
SA.
Alon Pres. and Chief Executive Officer Jeff D. Morris said, “We
are developing contingency supply plans for our customers and
expect to have those in place in the next few days. We are also
in the process of developing an operating plan for repairing the
facility and bringing the refinery back into operation as soon as
possible.”

StatoilHydro starts Volve oil and gas production
StatoilHydro has begun oil and gas production from Volve field
in the Norwegian North Sea from the large Maersk Inspirer jack up
rig, while Navion Saga will be used as a storage vessel for further
transport.
Gas will be exported from the Sleipner A platform. The company drilled eight wells to develop reserves of 78.6 million bbl of oil
and 1.5 billion cu m of gas. An additional five wells are planned.
Volve production, which will continue for 4-5 years, is expected to plateau at 50,000 b/d by the end of first quarter 2009.
Volve is 200 km west of Stavanger in the southern section of the
Norwegian continental shelf. StatoilHydro has a 59.6% interest in
the field and has partnered with ExxonMobil Corp. 30.4% and PA
Resources 10%. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
Based on preliminary assessments, Alon said it plans to resume
partial operations in about 2 months.

Trinidad and Tobago to build second reﬁnery
Trinidad and Tobago’s Minister of Energy and Energy Industries Conrad Enill has announced that the twin-island nation will
construct a $3-4 billion refinery next to its existing 168,000 b/d
refinery at Pointe-a-Pierre.
The Minister said, although the final figure is not yet in, he expects the refinery’s capacity to be in the order of 200,000 b/d.
Enill told a BG Trinidad & Tobago-sponsored luncheon the new
refinery would be export oriented. “As a producer of approximately 150,000 b/d of oil, the country would benefit from being able
to refine its own crude and convert it into salable products for the
fuels retail market,” Enill said.
The energy minister said bottom-of-the-barrel products from
state-owned Petrotrin can be utilized as feedstock for the new facility.
The government is close to hiring a contractor, Enill said, but
the final figures are not in so the final cost has not yet been determined.

Dinaz to start reﬁnery construction in 2010
Latvia’s Dinaz plans to start construction of the country’s first
refinery in 2010 so it can reduce product imports.
Dinaz Pres. Nikolay Yermolayev said the €2 billion, 6 million
tonne/year refinery would be built near Daugavpils just north of
the Belarus-Lithuania border. The greenfield site is 4 km from Dru-

zhba pipeline, which transports Russian oil to Europe.
Yermolayev said the company is conducting a feasibility study
for the refinery and will start the environmental process in 2009.
Dinaz also is seeking partners in developing the refinery.
Separately, Dinaz also plans to construct a 10 million tonne/
year oil terminal in Riga that would increase its trade links and
improve domestic fuel trading, Yermolayev said.

Preem seeks permits for coker at reﬁnery
Swedish refiner Preem Petroleum AB is seeking envrionmental
permits to build a new 4 million tonnes/year coker unit near its
220,000 b/d Lysekil reinery on Sweden’s west coast.
The expansion will propel the company’s move from fuel oil
into transportation fuels, according to Michael Low, Preem president and chief executive, who spoke at International Petroleum
Week in London. Preem hopes to make a final investment decision
on the project by yearend, although if the project proves uneconomical, the company will examine other options. Low declined to
comment on what these other options would be, however.
The coker would have high feedstock flexibility and utilize spare
hydotreating capacity. Low said it was unclear how much it would

cost, but high costs, exacerbated by a shortage of contractors and
materials, are impacting timely delivery of projects and whether
refiners should progress with upgrades.
“Supply bottlenecks faced by the refining sector will not go
away until at least 2009-10,” Low said.
However, tightening environmental standards are also increasing costs and workloads for companies in the petroleum sector to
ensure they produce cleaner fuels. Utilizing a coker unit would produce more carbon emissions, and Preem is investigating methods
of carbon capture and sequestration with research institutions.
Europe’s surplus of gasoline in the near future will be a major
challenge as it has lost an export market to the US where the preference is to use diesel-run cars instead. Attractive incentives have
also encouraged a boost in diesel production. “The car industry
needs to come up with ways to make efficient gasoline cars; it’s not
a problem that we can solve by ourselves,” Low said.
Low was also doubtful that the European Union will reach its
target of having 5.75% of its transportation fuels coming from renewable sources by 2010 as EU members are at different levels
in boosting their share of alternative fuels in the energy mix. “In
Germany the government stopped subsidizing grapeseed oil, and
that has left many companies bankrupt,” Low said. ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Russia, Ukraine settle gas debt dispute
Russia and Ukraine have resolved their disagreement over the
supply, pricing, and transit of Central Asian natural gas following a
meeting between the leaders of the two countries.
“We regret that problems of the kind are still popping up,” said
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said, “Our partners told us
that they would soon start repaying the debts.”
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko explained that the debt
would be repaid at last year’s price of $130/1,000 cu m, rather than this year’s price of $179.5/1,000 cu m. “We agreed that
Ukraine would [on Feb. 14] start repaying the debt of last November-December,” he said.
Ukraine’s debt for gas supplied by Russia since Jan. 1 reportedly is nearing $500 million, while the country’s overall gas debt
exceeds $1.5 billion. Ukraine is said to have received 1.7 billion cu
m of Russian gas for which it has not yet paid.
Meanwhile, OAO Gazprom Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller
said Neftegaz Ukrainy, which plans to settle the gas problem by
the end of February, will join with his firm to establish two new
companies involved in supplying gas to Ukraine.
“We are forming a new structure of Ukrainian gas imports,
which includes the establishment of a new gas importing company
on 50-50 terms. Fifty percent will belong to Gazprom, and another
50% to Neftegaz Ukrainy,” he said.
In addition, Miller said, “We will form a company to sell gas on
the Ukrainian domestic market, again on a 50-50 basis.”
While Gazprom and Neftegaz Ukrainy will soon start working on a new formula of gas supplies, the disputed RosUkrEnergo
will remain the only supplier of Central Asian and Russian gas to
Ukraine.
Russia recently threatened to cut off all supplies of its natu10

Yulia Timoshenko suggested increasing the tariffs for Russian gas

Suez JV obtains approval for Chile LNG terminal
GNL Mejillones (GNLM), a 50-50 joint venture of Suez Energy
International and copper company Codelco, has obtained the environmental permit for its planned LNG regasification terminal in
Mejillones in northern Chile.
The terminal will have a planned annual send-out capacity of
5.5 million cu m of gas, sufficient to produce 1,100 Mw of electricity.
GNLM plans to start preparatory field work immediately and
will begin construction of the jetty and onshore terminal within
the next few months, Suez said.
Gas is expected to start being delivered at yearend 2009 or early
2010.
For LNG storage, GNLM will use a conventional LNG carrier
that will remain permanently moored to the jetty. Suez Global LNG
will provide the floating storage unit (FSU). Onshore facilities will
include pumps, compressors, vaporizers, and pipelines.
Mining companies BHPB-Escondida, Collahuasi, El Abra, and
Codelco Norte have all signed gas purchase contracts with GNLM
to cover electricity generation needs for 3 years, beginning in
2010. GNLM also signed an LNG supply agreement with Suez for
identical volumes and duration.
The company expects to reach a decision by yearend on Phase
2, the construction of an onshore storage tank to replace the
FSU. ✦

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

Peak-oil context
The letter by Al-Husseini and AlHusseini about the Cambridge Energy
Research Associates decline-rate study, as
well as comments by other peak oil theorists on the subject, demonstrates their
habit of ignoring historical context (OGJ,
Feb. 4, 2008, p. 12). The point is that the
decline rate, and the effect of depletion
on capacity, is not a new element; rather,
the industry has been replacing about
4 million b/d of lost capacity a year for
some time now. With growth of approximately 1.5 million b/d of capacity every
year, the gross additions must be on the
order of 5.5-6 million b/d, or more than
a Saudi Arabia every 2 years. Analysts like
Matt Simmons and ASPO-USA always
describe this without context. Thomas
Petrie, for example, was quoted as saying,
“When was the last time we discovered
another Iran?”
Yet the industry has not only raised
capacity by about 15 million b/d over
the last 10 years, it has replaced something like 35 million b/d of capacity lost
to depletion. This is equal to 10 Irans,
without actually finding a new, major
petroleum basin.
The only point of interest is whether
or not the decline rate in existing fields
has grown with new technologies, as
some have claimed. CERA states that it
did not find this to be the case. Why
peak-oil pundits ignore this is hard to
explain. Indeed, ASPO-USA’s comment
that “betting on depletion is like betting on rust” nicely demonstrates the
shortcoming of their thinking: The oil
industry, and many others, deals with
rust all the time, without thinking it will
cause them to peak and decline.
Depletion, like rust, has always been
with us and can be dealt with, given
proper investment.
It is hard to produce oil, and always
has been. But the industry has managed
not only to run faster to stay in place,
but to continually pull ahead. The resource that is lacking is logical thinking
on the part of the peak-oil community.

Winter woes
Warren R.True
Chief Technology
Editor-LNG/
Gas Processing
Extreme weather tests even the richest, most well-managed economies. So,
when winter 2007-08 brought cold
and suffering to two countries whose
hydrocarbon wealth should have softened the blows, the world took note.
Something else must be going on.
China possesses the world’s third
largest coal reserves, behind the US
and Russia. Yet extraordinary winter
snows there in January and February
overwhelmed its energy-delivery infrastructure and caused near riots in major
southern cities.
Similarly, Iran holds the world’s
second largest natural gas reserves
behind Russia: at least 974 tcf proved
and probable. Contract squabbles with
Turkmenistan reduced natural gas for
reinjection into major Iranian oil fields,
forced power plants to switch to more
polluting fuel oil, and cut the country’s
ability to honor export contracts, especially with Turkey.
And Iran’s people shivered and many
died in winter storms across its north.

Reserves; disasters
China’s 2005 coal reserves, according to the US Energy Information Administration, were nearly 114.5 billion
tonnes, comprising 12.6% of world
coal reserves. Most are in the country’s
west; most recent and rapid demand
growth is along the coastal east.

The world’s largest consumer of coal,
China produces around 78% of its electricity from it. The country’s infrastructure to move coal to power plants and
produced electricity to markets has not
kept pace with economic development,
according to the Wall Street Journal.
China has even had to import coal, especially for markets along its coasts and
in large southern cities.
These weaknesses were on display
when mid-January storms exposed the
thin supply margin for its power-generation industries and the precarious conditions of its straining infrastructure.
The Associated Press reported snow
and ice in some areas snapped power
lines, cutting power from the 500-kv
transmission line linking the Three
Gorges Dam hydroelectric project to the
national grid. China’s South China State
Grid, which operates the electrical grid
in southern China, said repairs to the
entire network would not finish until
the end of March. In the meantime,
customers will see intermittent outages.
The AP cited government data for the
4 weeks of snow and ice storms, saying
they killed more than 80 people, leveled
300,000 homes, and laid waste to 222
million acres of crops.
Newspapers and television reports
around the world showed key transport
systems paralyzed just as millions of
migrant workers tried to go home for
the Lunar New Year holiday.
Similarly, Iran faces major delivery problems despite its abundance
of natural gas. For several years, it has
dangled before the world market huge
LNG projects to bolster its international
standing and bring in much needed
cash. Despite occasional announcements, however, none has yet proceeded to construction. (See OGJ’s special

report on global LNG beginning on p.
20.)
The country uses much of its natural
gas along with imports from Turkmenistan for pressure maintenance at several
older oil fields. And it also flows gas
to households for heating—which is
where winter 2007-08 comes in again.
Turkmenistan, in a contract dispute
with Iran in late 2007, first reduced
then entirely shut off gas supplies. Reports said dozens of people in remote
northern areas died from a cold snap at
the same time that drove temperatures
to near –25° C.

What is wealth for?
These two energy-rich countries
are certainly not the only ones ever to
suffer from a conjunction of extreme
weather and inadequate delivery infrastructure. And no one takes satisfaction
in their peoples’ misfortunes.
What is striking about these events,
however, is how neither country was
able to marshal its huge energy resources early or quickly enough to alleviate
citizens’ suffering.
China might well be excused based
simply on the size of the population it
must manage; with the possible exception of Russia, no other country has
such numbers spread over such distances.
Iran, on the other hand, has neither the population nor the distances
to hamper its efforts. Its international
bluster and Western economic sanctions
have hampered development of its natural gas to the detriment of its people.
When winter storms hit both
regions, neither country’s huge hydrocarbon reserves were able to alleviate
suffering.
So what is wealth for? ✦

In their new book, authors Michael D. Tusiani and Gordon
Shearer, using everyday language and real-world examples,
present LNG as the most viable energy answer to the everincreasing global demand for natural gas.

Even the most conservative estimates suggest that the
demand for LNG internationally will double by 2020, and
billions of dollars will be needed for the infrastructure
investment.
The authors’ straightforward explanation of a complex
industry proves that LNG can deliver a critical link in the
energy demands of international economies.

The oil price ﬂoor
As the price of crude oil flirts again with its
$100/bbl threshold, the question naturally arises:
How high can the price go? But brush away the
superficialities, and market changes give reason to
wonder how low the price might sink.
Demand for oil can’t rise as fast as it did during
2004-07 indefinitely. Yes, populous countries like
China and India are industrializing, craving oil and
other energy. Yes, the global population is growing. Yes, these changes expand the energy market
structurally.
But supply struggles to keep up. Part of the
reason is geologic: The global petroleum resource,
however defined, whatever its size, has reached a
stage of development at which new supply tends
to be difficult to find and expensive to produce.
Much oil remains—more than anyone at any given
time can attest. But it isn’t cheap. And the world
continues to need growing amounts of it.

Main constraints
Geology, however, is far from the main constraint of the moment. Limits on capital, labor,
materials, and availability of exploration and development opportunities curb supply growth even
more. Since 2003, the world has needed 1-1.5
million b/d of new oil supply each year—more
than that in 2004. Production capacity, despite
strong natural declines in mature areas like the US
and UK North Sea, has grown. But it hasn’t grown
fast enough to prevent a strong increase in prices.
The trend can’t last. As demand pressure builds
against limits on supply growth, and as prices
therefore rise, the market inevitably responds by
shedding demand and, to the extent it can, boosting supply. It’s doing so now.
In their monthly market reports for February,
two important reporting agencies note an important turn in the oil market. Citing the global
economic chill, the International Energy Agency
trimmed by 200,000 b/d its forecast for average
2008 oil demand from the projection it made in
January. “Just as the demand shock of 2004 shaped
the oil market for the next 3 years,” IEA says, “so

too could the pending [economic] slowdown.”
And capacity additions this year and next will lift
spare capacity, a vital source of surge supply that
for several years has been perilously low.
The US Energy Information Administration,
while lower in its 2008 demand forecast than
IEA, sees a similar change. “Higher production
outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and planned additions to OPEC capacity
should more than offset expected moderate world
oil demand and relieve some of the tightness in
the market,” it says. EIA projects a doubling of
global spare production capacity to 4 million b/d
by the end of 2009.
Rising supply and moderating demand growth
mean lower prices, of course. No one should be
stunned by this news. Nor should anyone think
that last week’s price spurt, the result more of
news events than of market fundamentals, changes
the outlook. The ingredients for an inevitable softening of the market are in place.
So how far might the price of crude oil—absent a supply cataclysm—fall? The answer depends
partly on how far the global economy falls, if that’s
what it’s destined to do. Pointing to tight oil supplies in the developing world and rising service
costs, IEA says corporate analysts are “suggesting
companies are preparing for a sustained $60-80/
bbl world.”

The ﬂoor
The practical floor price of crude oil may lie
near the low end of that range. It’s the level at
which Saudi Arabia feels enough financial pressure
to lower oil production in support of the crude
price. In its Global Oil Report, the Centre for
Global Energy Studies analyzes the published Saudi
budget for 2008 and concludes that the kingdom,
to meet spending plans and retire debt at the 2007
rate, needs an OPEC basket price of $62/bbl. CGES
calls that “the oil price floor for 2008, below
which it is unlikely the oil price will stay for long.”
As always, the oil price can fall as well as rise—
but perhaps not as far as it has in the past. ✦

For several years prior to 2004, the
LNG industry was a buyers’ market, and
buyers were in the driver’s seat with
respect to pricing terms and flexibilities
introduced into LNG sales agreements.
Since then, however, LNG has moved
strongly into a sellers’ market due to
strong gas demand and delays in sanctioning and constructing new liquefaction capacity. Many analysts see a sellers’
LNG market prevailing
well beyond 2010.
Some of the largest
project financings closed
in 2004-06 were in the
LNG sector—along the
whole supply chain. Many
involved large components of bank debt secured at modest
margins. In addition, during the same
period, several liquefaction projects
that had entered the postcommissioning phase were able to refinance in the
highly competitive bank lending market, achieving lower lending margins.
Despite such a recent golden age for

finance deals, recent events seem to be
conspiring to mark a turnaround in
financing conditions. Fig. 1 illustrates
the pressures and risks offsets at the upstream end of the LNG supply chain in
2007 by the sellers’ market and unprecedented high oil and gas prices.
Several events have had a major im20

pact on financing:
• The US subprime debt crisis of August 2007 and the consequential global
tightening of debt markets.
• Fiscal instability and toughening
terms for international oil companies
(IOCs) in upstream gas supply contracts.
• Rampant and sustained oil and gas
industry cost inflation (2005-07).
• Devaluation of the US dollar by
some 67% against the euro since 2002.
• Volatility and future uncertainty in
gas markets, in terms of both supplydemand fundamentals and price. For
example, the UK LNG market has
deteriorated with the commissioning
of new pipelines in 2006; the Japanese market for LNG strengthened in
2007, with significant loss of nuclear
power capacity; and the US LNG market
remains uncertain because of possible
increases in domestic gas exploration
and production and the delays in building key LNG receiving terminals.
• Less security of offtakes underpinning LNG sales contracts.
• Substantial delays and
massive cost overruns in
some large liquefaction
projects such as Sakhalin II
and Snohvit.
• Lack of skilled personnel and the unavailability of
experienced engineering,
procurement, and construction (EPC) contractors.
• Difficulties gaining
regulatory approvals to
build new LNG receiving
terminals in key markets:
California and New England.
Despite a strong global
LNG demand and a lack of
sufficient supply increases,
these events have substantially increased
the risks and costs for lenders, which
may lead to increased lending margins
and make debt financing for LNG projects more difficult to secure.

Impact on projects

capital-intensive. In addition, they are
influenced by multicomponent, long
supply chains; require a long period of
capital expenditure during the planning, design, engineering, procurement, and construction phases before
there is any income; and due to their
large size and complexity, are nearly
always multiparticipant projects.
For all but the largest IOCs, project financing is required as part of a
funding package for LNG infrastructure
development. The IOCs and national oil
companies (NOCs) often together form
special-purpose companies to engage
in project finance for LNG projects—
especially for upstream activities such as
field development and liquefaction and
for shipping—in order to leverage their
deployed capital and spread financial
risk. Having creditworthy IOCs involved
provides a means for less creditworthy
NOCs to secure access to project debt at
more-favorable terms than they could
secure on their own.
Large gas field development projects have loan collateral that can be
evaluated based on the associated field
reserves. Gas volumes available for
loan valuation are usually the proved
reserves, although in recent years some
lenders have been willing to add at least
a fraction of probable reserves.
Due to the very large investments,
long payback periods, and large volumes of reserves that must be processed
by the typical liquefaction project to
achieve payback, the project’s recoverable hydrocarbon reserve collateral is
not liquid until the liquefaction plant’s
postcommissioning stage is reached.
Gas reserves cannot be monetized without all of the upstream and liquefaction
facilities plus (usually long-term) LNG
purchase agreements, and transportation and handling contracts along the
supply chain.
Although there is a primary focus on
potential project revenues, lenders for
liquefaction and regasification projects
are frequently preoccupied with credit
support for project finance. Key issues
here are the creditworthiness of the
seller and the buyer, or their parent

organizations. The concern is the risk to
future project revenues from nonperformance by any party, including EPC contractors and suppliers. If the borrower’s
counterparty in the purchase agreement
is not well capitalized or creditworthy,
lenders usually seek another creditworthy entity to provide some form of
financial guarantee.
In supply chains where the LNG
purchasers include utilities in countries such as India, China, and Mexico
without established international credit
ratings, additional guarantees become
essential to secure project finance. LNG
project loan terms typically have long
durations of a decade or more following the commissioning of the facilities.
Credit-ratings triggers may be involved
in loan terms; if the borrower’s credit
rating deteriorates during the long repayment period, for example, a higher
loan repayment dedication or loan
margin may be applied.
Despite such limited loan collateral
issues, it has become commonplace for
greenfield and expansion, base-load
liquefaction plants to obtain limited
recourse or nonrecourse project financing. This usually has been achieved on
the back of long-term sales agreements
to creditworthy LNG buyers, incorporating take-or-pay and minimum or
floor gas price provisions. This type of
exposure for equity and debt providers

Lack of skilled
personnel

requires conservative project evaluation
and risk analysis. In the competitive
lending market of 2004-06, lenders became less conservative. Expectations in
late 2007, however, were that they may
again become more conservative.

Global ﬁnance trends
Trends in the pricing of commercial loans to Qatar’s LNG projects over
the past decade are indicative of global
LNG project finance trends. In the mid1990s Qatargas-1 project financing
attracted a margin of 165 basis points
(bp), compared with Rasgas-1 bank
loan margins of 95-200 bp. Rasgas-1
refinanced on better terms in 2004.
The Qatargas-2 project—a joint
venture of Qatar Petroleum, ExxonMobil, and Total—in 2004 marked a
resurgence in commercial banks’ appetite for large LNG project financings
at the arranger and syndication level, as
illustrated by the oversubscription of
that offering, with 36 banks acting as
mandated lead arranger.
Qatargas-2 was able to secure
commercial bank finance at margins
of 50-125 bp, followed in 2005 by
Rasgas-2 and 3 project financings with
bank loan margins of 45-65 bp. The
downward trend in borrowing costs
continued with the Qatargas-4 project
sponsored by Qatar Petroleum and Shell
in 2006 leveraging its project finance

Cost inﬂation
Although gas liquefaction projects
contain some peculiarities, evaluating
them must be based on sound financial
and economic analysis, which is common to all project decision-making.
Although this has always presented
challenges for gas liquefaction projects, the problem has become critical
since 2005. This is primarily because,
after a period of sustained decline in
unit capacity terms due to increasing
economies of scale, the size and cost of
a world-class, base-load gas liquefaction
plant has dramatically increased due to
rising steel, nickel, and other materials
and labor costs impacting much of the
oil and gas industry.
Gas liquefaction facilities are built of
high-cost, critical-process components,

and they frequently require innovative
technology tailored to specific geographic environments. That was the case
with Snohvit and Sakhalin II facilities.
Such components tend to suffer from
the highest inflation rates.
In 2003, base-load gas liquefaction
process trains were constructed for less
than $200/tonne/year of plant capacity,
but by 2007 costs had risen to above
$600/tonne/year of plant capacity.
Consequently several projects have had
final investment decisions delayed,
and many financiers are having second
thoughts about financing projects associated with rapidly escalating budgets.
In 2006 the absence of new liquefaction project sanctions exacerbated the
sellers’ market. In 2007 and early 2008,
companies finally made investment
decisions for new liquefaction projects
in Peru (led by Hunt Oil) and in Angola
(led by Chevron), but both projects had
increased budgets.
In such circumstances careful evaluation of project costs, technical and nontechnical risks, project schedule, and
efficiency of design are critical. An LNG
plant, either liquefaction or regasification, that is not complete and capable
of delivering the throughput that will
enable it to meet its sales contract
requirements has essentially no value
as an asset against the loan. The 75%
complete Dabhol regasification plant,
for example, sat uncompleted during
2001-06 following the unraveling of
Enron’s sales agreement with its power
plant customer.
The salvage value of even the best
available gas processing technology
installed in a remote location is very
low. With the intention of completing
the facility in 2007, India’s state-owned
gas company GAIL and its power utility
NTPC Ltd. acquired the Dabhol regasification plant by paying a discount of
about 70% of the debt outstanding to
the original EPC contractors and suppliers, including Bechtel and GE. This
example underscores the point that the
only value in such projects is the future
expectation of revenue from gas sales
after the facilities begin operation.

Changing risk proﬁle
A comprehensive and holistic risk
analysis of all LNG facilities is essential
for both equity and debt finance participants to build the level of confidence
such participants require to sanction
future investments. The problem is that
the LNG supply chain and market have
become more complicated in recent
years, changing the risk profile in ways
that make lenders nervous. Further
changes in the risk exposure for LNG
project financing continue to materialize.
Even in 2006 some analysts were
commenting that LNG buyers were
continuing to call the shots, being less
willing to accept rigid floor price and
take-or-pay volume guarantees. European buyers for many years had made
progress seeking more-flexible pricing
provisions linked to gas-on-gas competition instead of fuel-oil replacement.
The expectation then was that LNG
around the world would continue to
move away from the traditional crude
oil-linked price indexing and toward
gas market pricing.
The strengthening sellers’ market
and booming oil prices changed that
in 2007. LNG suppliers see no compelling reason to move away from crude
oil price indexing. Japan in 2001 had
secured price stabilization in long-term
contracts through its S-curve price
index back to oil in the days of the buyers’ market.
During 2007 Japan was forced by
market conditions in recent long-term
contracts to accept straight-line price
indexation approaching parity to oil
prices, which translated into gas prices
of some $11/MMbtu in late 2007.
Although some Japanese buyers want to
change price indexation from the traditional Japanese Crude Cocktail oil price
benchmark and use NYMEX Henry
Hub gas prices instead, few sellers want
to move away from oil price indexing
with oil prices hovering around $100/
bbl. Some observers expect the Henry
Hub benchmark to play a greater role in
LNG price indexing, particularly in Asia,
over the coming years. Although this

has been the case with some short-term
trades and cargo diversions, it may not
be for future long-term contracts.
Natural gas prices at Henry Hub in
the US, at the National Balancing Point
in the UK, and short-term cargoes into
Japan and South Korea have fluctuated widely in recent years, leading to
future cash flow uncertainty for equity
and debt investors. Market dynamics in
late 2007 suggested that growing gas
demand and insufficient growth in LNG
supply should provide upward pressure
overall on prices.
In certain markets, however, where
gas-on-gas competition is intense—
such as new gas import pipelines versus
new LNG receiving terminals in the
UK—periods of oversupply can be
expected. In recent years LNG project
lenders have been willing to accept
more price risk.
The Qatargas-2 project marked the
first occasion in which price risk was
passed through to lenders, with the
sales agreement for the first train shipping gas into the UK gas market at a
price with no floor price guarantee.
Strong demand in Asia has provided
Qatargas with the extra cushion of being able to divert some gas originally
contracted for UK and US markets in
that direction. That may be necessary
from time to time, even in a predominantly sellers’ market to avoid potential
losses associated with periodically being
forced to sell some cargoes at lower
prices in the Atlantic basin.
The no-floor-price provisions in gas
sales to the UK were deemed acceptable
to lenders in 2004-05 after marketing
studies showed strong future demand
in the UK coupled with decreasing domestic supply, as well as sound project
economics. What happened in the UK
market during winter 2006-07—oversupply from pipeline gas, leading to
sustained low gas prices—cast such
analysis in doubt, however. It is doubtful whether lenders will be quite so
willing to accept price risk in the current market. However, lenders’ attention
has been drawn primarily upstream,
with concerns about escalating project

CERA: Stage set for more global gas market
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
The stage appears set for natural
gas to become more of a global energy
commodity in 2008 and 2009 than in
the past, largely because of an expanding LNG industry, Cambridge Energy
Research Associates said at its annual
conference in Houston.
“The LNG armada has already set
sail,” said Michael Stoppard, CERA
senior director for global gas, during
a Feb. 13 news conference. “In 2007,
we saw the ability of the LNG market
to respond to global events,” he said,
referring to a July 16, 2007, earthquake
that caused the shutdown of a Japanese power plant and the outage of a
major North Sea gas pipeline serving
the UK.

“The economy needs a carbon price
signal,” he said. “Most of the current US
proposals are for cap-and-trade. Such
a system should recognize that carbon
offsets are available not only here, but
worldwide.
“Another key step by government,”
Mulva said, “would be to make fossil
fuels more environmentally acceptable.
It could do this by promoting carbon
capture and storage. To do so, government must first create a regulatory
framework that incorporates sufficient
economic incentives.”
In a separate session, Vinson & Elkins
attorney Nettles said he believes US
regulations on GHG emissions will be
pointed primarily toward fossil fuel
producers, refineries, and the midstream gas business rather than toward
vehicle manufacturers or consumers.
Congress is expected to pass legislation to limit GHG emissions, Nettles
said, adding that it’s more apt to come
in 2009 than in 2008. The US Environmental Protection Agency then would
be called upon to calculate the level of
emissions from using various fuels.
26

Stoppard foresees LNG growth
to continue to 2010 based on investment decisions made years ago. He is
uncertain about LNG’s pace of growth
beyond 2010.
Despite the current LNG momentum,
Stoppard said a need “absolutely”
exists for the proposed Alaska natural
gas pipeline. CERA believes an Alaska
pipeline could not be put into operation
until after 2020, and that LNG will help
fulﬁll US gas demand until then.
Stoppard expects global liquefaction
capacity to increase to 341 billion cu
m from today’s 262 billion cu m within
24 months. This stems from investments at Qatar’s Ras Laffan along with
projects in Russia, Yemen, Australia,
and Indonesia.
World LNG shipping capacity is
expected to increase by more than 50%

by 2010, he said. More LNG vessels will
allow for expanded arbitrage opportunities, and a larger ﬂeet presents the
opportunity for using ships as ﬂoating
regasiﬁcation and storage vessels.
Meanwhile, investment in regasiﬁcation terminals is rising at a faster pace
than the associated liquefaction. That
is because regasiﬁcation represents
10-15% of LNG supply chain costs,
Stoppard said.
He believes the number of regasiﬁcation facilities always should exceed
liquefaction facilities. Surplus regasiﬁcation is essential for sellers wanting to
move shipments between regions.
“For buyers, regas is the ante to
sit in on the global gas procurement
game,” Stoppard said. “The expanding
number of countries considering building LNG import facilities ranges from
Brazil and the Netherlands to Pakistan
and New Zealand.”

“We’re going to have an army of
carbon accountants,” Nettles told OGJ.
“I can see jobs for fuel auditors in the
future.” He foresees the establishment
of a federal GHG registry that would
track emissions.
Nettles said a cap-and-trade system
is likely to include allocation of free
allowances each year to certain industries, such as coal-fired electric power
plants. These free allowances would be
provided for a few years only as a form
of transition assistance.
The percentage of allowances distributed would decline each year at different rates for different industries and
eventually there would be an auctionallowance distribution system.
Current discussion among lawmakers indicates that oil and gas producers probably would get no allowances
while refineries and gas processing
plants would get only small allowances.
“It’s a way to impose a tax on certain
fuels without calling it a tax,” Nettles
said.
CERA Chairman Daniel Yergin told
OGJ that economists generally favor a

carbon tax over a cap-and-trade system.
Yergin expects the US “will have some
carbon regime within a few years.”
IEA’s Tanaka said international negotiations for a GHG emissions reduction
target has generated much publicity,
but he noted that the establishment of a
target alone will not solve the problem.
The European Union, Japan, and
Canada have pledged to reduce emissions by 50% in 2050. In December,
178 countries at the UN climate conference in Bali signed what Tanaka calls the
“Bali roadmap, which takes up where
the Kyoto treaty leaves off.”
“What is needed is practical action
to transform our energy system,” Tanaka
said, adding that improved energy
efficiency is fundamental. In separate
speeches, both Tanaka and Cook indicated the oil and gas industry can be a
leader in improved energy efficiency.
The IEA believes a 50% cut in global
emissions means the world would have
to both reduce CO2 emissions from
electric power generation and reduce
the carbon intensity of transportation
eightfold, Tanaka said.

heating oil, and jet fuel while minimizing the risk of a decline in reﬁning
capacity utilization, said ofﬁcials of the
Cambridge Energy Research Associates
in Houston. Growth in liquids supply
capacity will be “more than sufﬁcient”
to match the volumetric increase in
demand, but the “cocktail” of hydrocarbons in the liquids supply will change,
with light liquids accounting for 32% of
the total supply in 2020, up from 19% in
2007, CERA said.
“While reﬁned product demand
growth becomes increasingly concentrated in the middle of the barrel, particularly for diesel and jet fuel, CERA
believes that light liquids, including
natural gas liquids, condensates, and—
to a lesser degree—biofuels, gas-to-liquids, and coal-to-liquids will dominate
supply growth between now and 2020,”
said Peter Jackson, global oil senior
director at CERA. Light liquids yield no
fuel oil and only modest volumes of
distillates. While some components of
the crude oil supply, such as extraheavy oil, will increase, the overall
crude supply, excluding condensate

spiked into crude oil, is projected to
ﬂatten after 2010.
Because reﬁneries are designed for
optimized yield based on a speciﬁc
mix of feedstocks, changes in supply
composition will have implications for
utilization rates and yields. Contrary to
conventional wisdom, CERA ofﬁcials
said, new supplies of heavy and sour
crudes from the Middle East, Latin
America, and Canada’s oil sands will
be balanced by light crude streams
from Eurasia and Africa, medium-tolight deepwater oil, and a good portion of Canadian heavy oil upgraded
and marketed as light syncrudes. As
condensates separated from wet gas
at the wellhead rise to 12% of total liquids capacity volume by 2020 and are
partly spiked into the crude, the overall
feedstock density should not decrease,
CERA reported.
At best, total reﬁnery feedstock
would grow by only 0.6%/year during
2010-20, much lower than the expected
overall demand growth of 1.6%/year.
“Therefore, if reﬁners continue to build
crude processing capacity on the 1.6%
rate, reﬁning utilization rates and margins would fall,” CERA said.
“Rising demand for gasoline and
diesel in recent years has led reﬁners
to plan additions of as much as 11 million b/d of capacity to convert residual

CERA estimates there may be only 6

for that new conversion capacity,” the
analysts reported.
Middle distillate products (diesel,
heating oil, jet fuel, and kerosine) are
projected to account for more than half
of world oil demand growth during
2007-20. However, light liquids—the
largest additional component of liquids
supply—yield only an average of 20%

higher than demand. “The global reﬁning system has the challenge to adapt
its conﬁguration to cope with this signiﬁcant mismatch,” said CERA ofﬁcials.
“As we move beyond 2010, the key
challenge for the reﬁning industry
will be adding the appropriate type
of conversion capacity—particularly
hydrocracking—and not necessarily adding more volumes of simple
crude distillation capacity,” said Olivier
Abadie, CERA’s downstream director.
“In the dynamic oil industry, investment responds to market signals.

supply role of a few years ago. According to Hess, US oil production peaked
in 1970. North Sea production peaked
in 2000. Mexico peaked in 2004.
“Within the next few years, conventional non-OPEC production will reach
a plateau. In fact, 60% of the world’s oil
production is from countries that have
already peaked,” Hess warned.
Renewable fuels, natural gas liquids,
and unconventional oil resources such
as oil sands and oil shale “need to be
encouraged,” Hess said. However, he
said, “Their contributions to supply are
not material enough to bridge the gap
in oil requirements over the next 10
years.”
With OPEC now down to 2.5 million
b/d of spare capacity, Hess said, “We
no longer have the safety margin for
supply interruptions and demand spikes
to ensure price stability. OPEC, with
approximately two thirds of the world’s
proven conventional crude reserves and
one third of its production capacity,
certainly has the resource base to relieve
the pressure.” However, he said, “All
oil producers—OPEC and non-OPEC
alike—simply are not investing enough
today to ensure sufficient capacity to
meet oil needs in the next 10 years.”

Conservation and climate
Hess said, “We need to make significant progress in conservation. The
growing population of hybrids and
an overall improvement in automotive miles per gallon is helpful, but we
need to spend more money on research
to make hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles a
commercial reality so that the average
fuel economy of a new passenger car
could increase to the equivalent of 80
mpg or better. Anything we can do in
terms of fuel efficiency in transportation would have the important added
benefit of helping to solve another critical challenge the world faces—climate
change.”
He said the US “with 5% of the

IEA sees boost in peak OPEC ﬂow from ’08 projects
Production projects due on stream
this year in members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
represent peak gross capacity additions
of 3.1 million b/d of crude oil and
other liquids, says the International
Energy Agency (see table).
Last year, OPEC members started up
projects with peak total-liquids capacities of 1.25 million b/d.
In its February Oil Market Report,
IEA says OPEC members’ ability to
produce crude oil alone, net of declines
in existing fields, could increase by

840,000 b/d during 2008.
NGLs and condensate represent 42%
of the peak-capacity estimates for 2008
projects, compared with 20% last year,
IEA says.
The agency points out that the time
between start-up to plateau output varies from 1-2 months for some projects
to 24 months or more for others.
“The net change in OPEC capacity in 2008 is of course markedly less
than implied by gross additions starting
up in 2008 because of the lag before
plateau output is attained and also the

schedule,” IEA says.
Low spare production capacity and
low global inventories are signs of the
market tightness that has kept crude oil
prices high.
IEA estimates sustainable OPEC capacity to produce crude oil—the output
level that members can reach with
30 days and maintain for at least 90
days—at 35.04 million b/d. It estimates
January OPEC production of crude oil at
32.02 million b/d.

Although IEA has lowered its forecast for 2008, OPEC output of NGLs
remains on a strong climb. The agency
predicts OPEC NGL production this
year will average 5.18 million b/d, up
365,000 b/d. It earlier expected the
increase to be 620,000 b/d.
The scale-back reflects a delay in

It also would require that where a foreign government collects taxes that are
limited in their application to oil and
gas taxpayers, the taxpayers treat such
taxes as oil and gas taxes subject to the
foreign oil and gas extraction income
credit limitation in the US tax code.
The bill does not include a provision
of earlier House bills that would have
returned the geological and geophysical
expense amortization period to 7 years
by repealing the 2005 Energy Policy Act
provision, which reduced it to 5 years.
The measure had 32 cosponsors when
Rangel introduced it.
Oil and gas industry associations
immediately responded. “This bill, like
the prior three or four which have been
similar, still makes the mistake of using
oil and gas tax provisions to pay for
new tax expenditures for other forms
of energy. The question is not whether
to move forward on these new forms of
energy, but whether it makes sense to
take capital from investment in existing
American energy businesses,” said Lee
O. Fuller, vice-president of government
relations at the Independent Petroleum
Association of America, on Feb. 13.
Mark Kibbe, a senior tax analyst at the
American Petroleum Institute, found it
interesting that House Democrats this
time chose a provision repealing Section 199 of the tax code for oil and gas
firms from a December bill and another
changing the foreign tax credit for US oil
and gas firms from an earlier House bill
that passed in August. “It’s still a $17.65
billion tax on the oil and gas industry,
which we think is a particularly poor
choice for Congress to make, particularly
when it just passed an economic stimulus bill,” he told OGJ on Feb. 13.
Kibbe also questioned the idea that
the latest bill affects only major oil
companies and large refiners. “Clearly,
that’s not true because they’ve elected to
include the freeze on ‘199’ for smaller
companies, including small refiners.
They’ve been saying that more small
refineries are needed, which aren’t an
attractive investment already but would
be even less attractive if this investment
incentive was repealed,” he said. ✦

Troubling
attitudes

S

hell Oil Co. Pres. John D. Hofmeister discovered some troubling attitudes as he met with local business
and government leaders during his
most recent visits to 50 US cities.
“People have embraced $3/gal
gasoline. They haven’t embraced the
oil industry. We’re more than disliked; we’re disrespected, and it’s the
industry’s own fault,” he told reporters during a stop in Washington, DC,
on Feb. 14.
That makes the oil and gas industry an easy target for some politicians
who use oil companies’ high profits
to justify punitive legislation, he said,
adding, “Bad public policies for the
purpose of spiting the oil companies
hurt consumers.”
Hofmeister also is concerned by
substantial beliefs that the US is running out of oil, and that biofuels will
solve the problem. The first ignores
the 100 billion bbl of technically
recoverable resources within this
country and the 1 trillion bbl trapped
in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah’s oil
shale deposits. The second overlooks
considerable logistical and technological challenges in making biofuels
commercial.

gies because it fully intends to be a
leading participant. But the company
dislikes recurring proposals to tax
only the five biggest US oil companies.
“Taking money from these companies because they’ve been successful
is objectionable. If a tax was imposed
across the entire industry, that would
be another matter,” the Shell executive said.
When Congress considered
dramatically expanding the Renewable Fuels Standard in 2007, Shell
expressed strong concern that the
technology did not exist to meet
such an aggressive goal, he said. It
also pressed for an “off-ramp” in case
it became obvious that the mandate would not succeed. Its biggest
argument has been the significant
differences between pilot plants and
commercial production.

‘We don’t fear it’

That does not mean that Shell
opposes a role for alcohol in motor
fuels, Hofmeister said. “We’ve been
in the ethanol business for 30 years.
We don’t fear it. But we believe that
more of it needs to come from waste

facilities in western Nigeria have shut
down 470,000 b/d of oil capacity for
the past 2 years. Shell estimated that
slimming down the organization will
save $200 million/year.
A Shell spokesman told OGJ it
could not say for how long it would
suspend its restructuring, adding
that it was continuing talks with
NNPC about the problems in western
Nigeria. “NNPC has asked for more
information about our plans. We don’t
know how many jobs will be affected
by the restructuring as we haven’t finished working out the details. Figures
in the press that it would be 3,000 are
pure speculation.”
NNPC head Abubakar Yar’Adua told
a parliamentary hearing Feb. 18 that,
although it appreciates the production
challenges Shell is facing, NNPC had
not been consulted before Shell began
the exercise. According to Nigerian
reports, the federal government plans to
bail out Shell and other such companies
through a special financial package that
would be arranged shortly.
Shell, one of the major operators in
Nigeria, has had to struggle to implement its projects in Nigeria because
of insecurity in the Niger Delta and
because NNPC has failed to contribute its share of funds to the JV. Rising
production costs also have exacerbated
the problems.
Mutiu Sumonu, Shell’s managing
director, told the parliamentary committee that the restructuring was crucial
to Shell JV’s survival and would create a
synergy between SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration & Production Co.
He was quoted in reports as saying:
“We used to produce 1 million b/d but
due to the Niger Delta crisis, we are
struggling to meet up with half of that.
There is no access to our production in
the west, and we have maintained our
staff strength up until this moment. We
took a look at our future development
plan covering 2008-12 and discovered
that business is already half of what it
ought to be. The whole business output
requires that we take some action in the
interest of the business.” ✦

South Korea’s
diplomacy

S

outh Korea’s new government has
become keenly aware of the need
to pursue diplomacy in securing its
supplies of oil and gas—especially
from Iraq.
For South Korea, being resourcepoor and one of the world’s leading
consumers of oil and gas, diplomacy is a necessary skill to develop,
especially following its talks with the
Kurdish regional government (KRG).
In fact, Seoul’s first foray into the
labyrinths of Middle Eastern oil and
gas diplomacy has not met with
much approval at home. In a recent
editorial, the Korea Times conceded
that the incoming government’s vow
to focus on resource diplomacy is
welcome.
It said the need to make all-out
efforts to secure natural resources,
particularly oil, can hardly be overemphasized. South Korea, the world’s
10th largest energy consumer, relies
on foreign suppliers for 97% of its
demand, with slightly more than
4% coming from its own oil fields
abroad.

Falling short
What’s left is how to put the new
diplomacy into action in the most
effective ways, but the paper said
recent efforts by President-elect Lee
Myung-bak “fell somewhat short of
expectations in this regard.”
Lee met Nechirvan Barzani, the
head of KRG, who sought cooperation in oil development in the
Kurdish region. Lee’s transition team
said a memorandum of understanding to explore a reserve of some 2
billion bbl was the “first fruit” of its
resource diplomacy.
The Korea Times disagreed. “It’s

questionable whether Lee should
have met the Kurdistan leader,
considering the Iraqi central government lately took issue with a similar
previous MOU as infringing on its
authority,” the paper said.
“Equally uncertain,” it intoned, “is
how the meeting will affect negotiations between SK Corp. and Baghdad
to resume Iraq’s crude exports to
the nation’s largest refinery that have
since been suspended.”
That suspension came into play
earlier this month when Iraqi Oil
Minister Husayn al-Shahrastani
threatened that international oil firms
would be blacklisted in his country if
they signed contracts with the KRG.

Unpalatable agreement
It remains to be seen how alShahrastani will react to the most
recent news coming from the meeting between the Kurds and the South
Koreans. On Feb. 20 Lee’s government said South Korea’s development
of oil fields in northern Iraq is likely
to surpass the agreement signed with
the Kurds on Feb. 14.
It said Barzani notified Lee’s transition team of his desire to expand the
scope of the oil field development
program to 3 billion bbl from the
initially agreed 1.5-2 billion bbl,
while spending on social projects for
the region would jump to $5 billion
from the earlier $2 billion.
There’s a lot at stake here as alShahrastani knows. If the Koreans get
away with this deal, then others will
try, too. Clearly, to make the agreement even slightly palatable to the
Iraqi oil minister, Lee’s government
will have to deploy all the diplomacy
it can possibly muster up. ✦

Mexico will face difficulties in
producing crude oil over the coming
2 years, according to a media report,
which claims that Cantarell and KuMaloob-Zaap (KMZ) fields will decline
simultaneously in 2010.
“As we move toward that scenario,”
said El Financero newspaper, “Cantarell’s decline became more pronounced
in 2007, when it stopped producing an
average of 304,000 b/d.
It declined by 234,000
b/d in 2006 and 101,000
b/d in 2005, the paper
reported.
According to the
paper, that reduction
contributed to a drop
of 174,000 b/d in the country’s total
production in 2007, compared with
a decline of 78,000 b/d in 2006 and
50,000 b/d in 2005.
Although KMZ’s oil production
average increased by 123,400 b/d in
2007, representing a 30.6% increase
over 2006, it is not offsetting much of
Cantarell’s decline because its increase
made up for only a third of the decline
in Cantarell, El Financero said.
Officials at state-owned Pemex
expect KMZ to reach its highest production level in 2010, averaging 800,000
b/d of crude oil. Thereafter, its decline
will begin, along with that of Cantarell.
Pemex officials commented that
Chicontepec, comprising onshore
wells, could compensate for part of the
decline in both fields. It currently produces 100,000 b/d, which could swell

Mexico’s oil decline rate
to steepen through 2010

Senior Correspondent

to 500,000 b/d by 2010.
“Nevertheless,” El Financero said,
“because of the characteristics of the
terrain where Chicontepec is located,
crude oil extraction will be very difficult.”
According to Sener, the 2007-16
Crude Oil Market Outlook prepared by
the Energy Information System of the
Energy Secretariat, in any scenario—
high or low—Cantarell’s production
will average 917,000-921,000 b/d
during 2006-16, with an average annual decline of 14.1%.
The Sener scenario says Chicontepec
and KMZ will partially make up for expected declines in Cantarell, although it
will be impossible to maintain production at the levels reached in previous
years.
In Sener’s low scenario, it is estimated that Chicontepec will increase
its production rate by 32%/year. The
increase in volume by 2016, however,
will be 360,000 b/d, compared with
the figure obtained in 2006, “which
would mean that this project would be
incapable of making up for the drop
in production at the exploitation and
Cantarell projects.”
El Financero concluded that, “in the
scenario of decreasing energy production, a more pronounced decline is expected in the northeast marine region,
where the most productive assets are
found, and effects are also anticipated
in the southwest marine and south
regions, which will have reductions of
40% and 20%, respectively.” ✦

BG lifts Tupi reserves estimate; Petrobras mum
Brazil’ Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) has declined to comment on
revised production estimates BG Group
has made concerning the supergiant
Tupi oil discovery in the Santos basin.
“We will not comment on those
projections,”said a Petrobras spokesman, apparently referring to comments
made by BG Chief Executive Officer
Frank Chapman that production at the
34

offshore field could reach 1 million
boe/d when fully developed.
Petrobras reported late in 2007 the
discovery of as much as 8 billion bbl
of light crude in Tupi field off Rio de
Janeiro. The estimated reserves could
make Brazil a major world oil exporter.
However, BG Group now estimates
total hydrocarbons in place on the Tupi
discovery to be 12-30 billion boe or

could contain a mean 1.9 billion bbl
recoverable, estimated directors of
Rockhopper Exploration PLC.
Other leads are under investigation,
and prospects identified on PL023 and
PL024 could have an estimated 2.5 billion bbl recoverable.
The new mapping identified five
hydrocarbon plays on the acreage and
confirmed the presence of multiple
drilling targets.
The 3D seismic also revealed that
one of the exploration wells Shell
drilled in 1998—which among other
oil shows encountered a thin sand
with good hydrocarbon shows—is located at the edge of a fan prospect that
appears to thicken towards its center.
The directors believe that this thicker
part of the fan prospect could contain
commercially viable hydrocarbon accumulations.
Rockhopper plans to conduct AVO
analysis, imaging studies, geochemical
modeling, further detailed log analysis,
depth conversion, and reservoir modeling.

Bankers Petroleum Ltd., Calgary,
agreed to acquire 50% of a private
company that holds the exclusive right
to evaluate and redevelop Kucova heavy
oil field in south-central Albania.
The private company, Privatco, has
an agreement with state Albpetrol ShA
and a license from Albania’s National
Agency of National Resources. The
terms of the petroleum agreement are
basically the same as those that govern
Bankers’ agreement for Patos-Marinza
oil field.
The deal is to close soon, and Bankers has until June 30, 2008, to exercise
an option to acquire the other 50%
interest.
Original oil in place at Kucova was
490 million bbl of 17° gravity oil, of
which about 6% has been produced.
Kucova is geologically similar to PatosMarinza, with multiple stacked sandstone reservoirs at 150-1,400 m with
oil of various gravities.
Kucova, 30 km northeast of PatosMarinza, averaged 400 b/d at the end
of 2006. It was discovered in 1928 and
has more than 1,700 wells.
Redevelopment by Bankers would
involve updating surface and downhole equipment, wellbore stimulations,
recompletions, waterflooding, and
thermal recovery.

The location is 100 km north of the
Saha-1 and Fachi West-1 wells drilled in
2007. Facai-1 is to test the Cretaceous
Donga formation and synrift sandstones, equivalent to those found at the

base of Saha-1, in a faulted anticlinal
trap.
The seismic program is expected to
target Cretaceous and another newly
identified play and to mature other
prospects and provide infill on play
trends in the sparsely controlled subbasin north of Facai-1, said 20% interest

The other play is a shallower Cretaceous sand east of the deeper Cretaceous sand fairway to be tested by
Facai-1.

plans to Tundra hopes to complete
unitization by the end of February and
start water injection at the end of May
in a 192-well program on 12 sq miles.
That will include eight wells owned by
Crown Point Ventures Ltd., Vancouver,
BC, in 15-8-29w1.
Recovery is expected to grow from
10% of OOIP by primary means to as
much as 20% with waterflooding and
30% or more with CO2 and waterflooding, Crown Point said.
A future expansion could include
Crown Point’s eight wells in 3-9-29w1.

Thunderbird Energy Corp., Calgary,
acquired 50% working interest in a
5,000-acre land package adjacent and
north of the company’s producing Gordon Creek gas field in central Utah.
The property roughly doubles Thunderbird’s land position.
Gordon Creek field, with four producing and six shut-in wells, a gathering-compression system, and more than
10 km of pipeline, is upstructure from
Drunkards Wash, Utah’s largest gas field
and largest coalbed methane field.

North Amethyst is
the first of several White
Rose field satellite discoveries that Husky Energy
Inc. plans to develop off
Newfoundland.
Production
Husky’s August 2007
development plan is
now under review by the CanadaNewfoundland and Labrador Offshore
Petroleum Board and, if it is approved,
development drilling may commence
in mid-2008. For drilling these subsea
tied-in wells, the company recently secured Transocean Inc.’s mobile semisubmersible drilling unit GSF Grand Banks.
The petroleum board approved
development of another satellite area,
South White Rose extension, in September 2007. Also Husky is evaluating
results of delineation drilling conducted
in 2007 for West White Rose prior to
submitting a development application
for the project.

White Rose
White Rose field produces to the
SeaRose floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessel. The
SeaRose has a disconnectable turret for
ice avoidance. Oil production from the

O D U C T I O N

field began on Nov. 12, 2005.
Husky, the operator, has a 72.5%
working interest in White Rose, which
lies on the eastern margin of the Jeanne
d’Arc basin, about 350 km east of St.
John’s (Fig. 1). Petro-Canada holds the
remaining 27.5% interest in the field.
The field has three pools: North,
West and South Avalon (Fig. 2). The
South Avalon was the initial pool developed in the
$2.35 billion
project.
South
Avalon is
in 120 m
of water,
and Husky
expects to recover 200-250 million bbl
of 30° gravity oil from the pool.
Husky’s base production profile for
White Rose predicts that the SeaRose
will begin reaching the end of production plateau in 2008. As spare production capacity becomes available, subsea
tie-back wells will start using this spare
capacity.
The North Amethyst satellite tieback involves a new glory hole with a
capacity for up to 16 wells. In its August
2007 development plan, Husky esti-

mates that the P50 (50% probability)
recoverable oil from North Amethyst is
70 million bbl out of the 256 million
bbl of oil in place. The plan expects the
development will have a $1.3 billion
(Can.) capital cost. Husky’s base-case
estimate is that North Amethyst’s wells
will have a maximum oil production of
62,900-75,500 b/d.
North Amethyst will produced from
the Ben Nevis formation, which is 600
m shallower then in the South Avalon
pool. In North Amethyst, a gas cap overlies the oil column and the properties
are similar to those in the South Avalon.
The plan expects South White Rose

and North Amethyst together to have
19-21 wells, including 7-8 horizontal
oil producers, 10-11 water injectors,
and 2 deviated gas injectors.
Husky plans for the water injection
to support reservoir pressure in North
Amethyst and will inject produced gas
from North Amethyst into North Avalon
for storage. Excess gas from South
Avalon already is being injected into
North Avalon. Husky expects to recover
the injected gas from North Avalon in
the future.
Husky’s development plan includes
two possible scenarios of tying back the
North Amethyst satellite (Fig. 3). In one

case, satellite wells would tie back to
the Sea Rose with dedicated flowlines
and risers terminating at the buoy. This
option requires modifying the FPSO
turret, buoy, and topsides to accommodate the new flowlines, risers and
umbilical. Also this case requires the Sea
Rose to be disconnected and brought
to shore for the modifications, possibly
in summer 2010. In this case, Husky
expects first oil from North Amethyst in
fall 2010.
In the second scenario, North Amethyst would tie back through existing
subsea infrastructure. This option would
not require turret modifications and

would delay topsides modifications to
later, according to Husky’s proposed
plan.

SeaRose FPSO
Husky advanced the planned maintenance turnaround for the SeaRose
from the original August 2008 date to
first-quarter 2008. The work entailed
shutting in production in late January
and early February for 13 days.
Husky said that it brought the schedule forward to address the problem of
sediment buildup in the low-pressure
separator, which had curtailed production to about 90,000-95,000 b/d. After
the turnaround, production increased to
about 130,000 b/d, Husky reported.
Combining the planned turnaround
with the cleaning of the low-pressure
separator, Husky expects the annual
White Rose production in 2008 to be
about the same as previously estimated. ✦

The first two parts of this series
showed that roller cone bit design
analysis can predict cone behavior when
heel teeth have equal pitch and how
bit kinematics are modeled differently
when the heel teeth on roller cones
have varied pitch (OGJ, Feb. 4, 2008, p.
46; Feb. 11, 2008, p. 42).
This third of four articles discusses
the concept of structural and technological well-bottom racks formed by
roller cone rock bits and studies the
performance of the bits interacting with
the well bottom in the process of pure
rolling behavior of the cones.

Since the rock bit kinematics are
determined by the bottom-well rack
profile, the gear ratio and the extent of
skidding of the cones, discussed earlier
in this series, would also be structurally
determined.
We have twice suggested possible
corrections to rock bit kinematic analysis:
• When we pointed out the higher
probability of slowing rotation of the
cones in incompetent formations, notwithstanding their structurally incorporated accelerated rotational speed.
• When we noted the phenomenon
of the transformation of the leading cone of the given bit induced by
the variation of the well-bottom rack
“teeth” number.

Nomenclature

Structural rack
We based our theory of the wellbottom rack formation process upon
the assumption that each cone began to
roll its own sector of the hole bottom
while supported by a single tooth of the
cone heel row. We also assumed that the
rack profile formed by the bit did not
depend upon rock mechanical properties and its surface conditions but was

Hence, an important conclusion may be drawn that
kinematics and consequently,
the efficiency of rock bits,
are very closely related to
accuracy in their manufacturing and may vary, regardless
of whether they are within
design tolerances. It is not accidental that problems of bit
manufacturing quality impact
their performance and are
subject to investigation.2
Besides this, the bit kinematic parameters will vary
due to wear of the gauging
sides of the cones during
drilling. In particular, skidding of the cones’ heel rows
will progress, making their
wear even more pronounced.
It’s obviously necessary to
solve the problem of bit

It’s important to note
some other peculiarities of
the rock bit kinematics.
Mating of the peripheries
of the well-bottom sectors is
accompanied by rearrangement of the rack teeth at
points of major skidding of
the cones with their completing teeth. Unsteady cone
rotation may be observed at
the onset of drilling, manifested as a variation of cone
gear ratios due to possible
deviation of the character
of the formed rack from its
technological profile. This
especially applies to rock formations of reduced hardness
where the rack is less stable
than in hard rock.
Moreover, since the character of the rack profile, as
stated above, is influenced

Relief stripes

Drilling conditions
Under actual drilling conditions,
the lithological profile usually consists
of alternating rock types with varying hardness that may dip at different
bedding angles. Consequently, when
the drill bit encounters a layer of harder
rock during drilling, the situation will
be similar to that of spudding on an inclined block surface, and the rack teeth
number will decrease.
When a bit encounters a softer
formation, the rack profile may also
change. Clearly, the well-bottom rack
profile does not remain stable during drilling but changes according to

On the sides or walls of the well, we
see relief stripes related to the wellbottom rack problem.
Multiple-pitch cones, as a rule,
provide for heel teeth slippage accompanied by widening of the rack craters
in one or more directions and at each
revolution of the bit, the rack profile
will gradually shift in plane. The direction of the rack shift will depend upon
the correlation between the values and
directions of skidding of the different
cones.
Since the cone movement is for the
most part slowed, the rack profile shift
will generally be directed opposite the

bit rotation. However, the rack profile
may still shift in the direction of the bit
rotation. This can be determined by correlating the technological gear ratios of
the cones at any point during drilling.
The rack shifting behavior will match
the inclination of the relief stripes on
the well wall.
In the case of equally pitched cones,
the well-bottom rack may wander and
the relief stripes may vary in inclination.

Pure rolling
The analytical study of drill bit
kinematics which was discussed in Part
1 permits us to conclude that duirng
design of toothed rock bits it is possible
to select geometric parameters of cones
that will provide minimal teeth skidding along the well bottom (OGJ, Feb. 4,
2008, p. 46). The actual gear ratio of the
cones should correspond to pure rolling.
In the case of multicone cutter bits,
pure rolling would be peculiar only to
heel rows. In the single-cone cutter bit
design pure rolling would occur for
all rows. Such cone design is especially
important for milled-tooth bits because
it can substantially increase their wear
resistance and efficiency during drilling
of abrasive rock.3
Corresponding to this condition are
cones with equal pitch of their heel
teeth; these may be determined by the
correlation4 shown in Equation 2.
Thus, for the B-151T bit, which has
the value i = 1.57, the actual cone gear
ratio would be close to pure rolling at Z
= 21, corresponding to the teeth pitch
t = 14.3 mm (OGJ, Feb. 4, 2008, p. 46,
Table 2).

Experimental bits
To verify this idea, the Verkhneserginsky bit plant manufactured several
experimental bits. Based on the commercial B-151T multicone cutter bit,
the experimental cone bits with equally
pitched heel rows included the 21B151T bit with heel tooth number Z =
21, and the 20B-151T bit with heel
tooth number Z = 20.
The 20B-151T bits were built to

actual gear ratio for each cone, and it
corresponds to pure rolling mode of
the cone heel rows.
The actual gear ratio of the cones
was calculated based on the number of
craters on the well-bottom rack, Zr, as
shown in Equation 4.
During drilling with the 21B-151T
bit, the number of craters on the wellbottom rack, Zr = 33, corresponds to a
gear ratio, ia = 1.57.
But during drilling with the 20B151T bit, the well-bottom rack had 30
craters. Consequently, the gear ratio is ia
= 1.5, which neatly corresponds to the
analytical results.

Rock destruction
In addition to studying experimental bit kinematics, it was interesting to
investigate the rock-destroying capability of the bits, their wear characteristics,
and performance efficiency.
The rock-destroying capability of the
experimental bits as compared to that

these drawings shows that the heel teeth
of the 21B-151T bits have considerably
less wear, despite drilling nearly twice
as far as the commercial B-151T bits.
Fig. 8 presents the hole bottom

clear-cut peripheral rack formed by the
21B-151T bit, which visually confirms
the lack of any skidding of the heel
rows along the hole bottom, in contrast
to the skidding seen with the 20B-151T
bit. This once again confirms that the
equality of the cone heel teeth numbers
is necessary but not a sufficient condition to reduce their skidding.
Equal heel teeth numbers on the cones
provide only their equal skidding, which
may be rather high. As a result, the performance and wear data for the bits with
equally pitched heel teeth on their cones
may even lag behind the bits having different cone-heel teeth numbers. ✦

The current outlook
for LNG is probably
more uncertain than
it has been for many
years. This is the result
of several factors, among
LNG
which are:
• The speed with
which LNG demand, particularly in
North America, Spain, and the UK, has
developed.
• The inherently slow response time
of LNG supply to the sharply increased
demand signals
• The supply lags have created a
shortage of LNG supply relative to
expectations.
• The burst in demand for new
plant capacity, which has taxed the
capabilities of experienced design and
construction contractors and sophisticated machinery suppliers. This has led
to a sharp “demand pull” inflation on
capital costs. Costs are not only much
higher than expected, but the potential for cost overruns and construction
delays has increased. It is not clear how
severely this has affected plans of the
many projects that are under active
consideration.
• The sharp increase in world energy
prices. The effect of these higher prices
on gas demand and on interfuel competition is not well understood.
• The uncertainties raised by environmental concerns. Pressures to
limit coal utilization may tend to favor
gas-fired power generation despite
higher gas prices. This is a particularly
important issue in China, where absent
government policy intervention, highpriced gas would find it very difficult to
compete with low-cost coal.
• The persistence of difficult geopolitical issues surrounding the natural gas
export policies of a number of countries, such as Bolivia, Nigeria, Iran, Russia, or Venezuela. It is difficult to foresee
the roles the countries will play in LNG
supply between now and 2020.
• And last, but not least, the fact that
LNG demand is inherently sensitive
to small changes in world gas supplydemand balances. Where LNG is the

“swing” source of gas supply for a gas
importing country, small changes in its
indigenous gas supply or demand magnify the effect on its LNG imports.
These uncertainties make it unrealistic to expect any forecast—no matter
how well done—accurately to predict
specific LNG trade flows out to 2020.
This article, however, summarizes a
recently completed projection—in three
scenarios—of world
LNG trade to 2020
done by Jensen Associates for the California
Energy Commission.

Global LNG trade to 2020
marked by uncertainty

If one can generalize about most published world and
regional gas forecasts, they tended to
become more optimistic about gas
demand in the 1990s as the enthusiasm
for gas-fired combined cycle power
generation took hold. Then, supply
problems in North America and the
North Sea injected a note of supply
concern into many estimates.
Initially, the tendency of most forecasts was to retain much of the demand

natural gas.
But there was a growing recognition
that supply was the principal determinant of the growth of world LNG
trade. Now, in a more common forecast
pattern, estimates reduce the amount of
gas for future power generation and are
more conservative about LNG trade.
At the same time that forecasts were
adjusting to supply constraints, the
rapid increase in world energy prices
threatened to blunt the growth of overall energy demand and alter the balance
between fuels in interfuel competition.
This added an additional conservative
element to the forecasts.

gional gas trade declines by 22.4%.
This pattern of declining gas demand
and LNG trade forecasts over time is
significant. It suggests that some LNG
demand estimates made during the early 2000s might now be regarded as too
optimistic and therefore unsuitable for
a base or reference case. It is this view
that has led our study to start with the
most recent governmental projections
to form the base case and utilize some
of the earlier, more optimistic estimates,
to develop a “high” scenario.
It is important to recognize that our
projections are on the low side compared to many public projections of
future LNG trade. Their conservatism results from two underlying assumptions.
We accept the IEA’s and EIA’s view that
higher prices have reduced expectations
of gas demand and world gas trade.
But we are impressed that many of the
LNG supply problems—high costs,
technological challenges, and geopolitical concerns—may slow the process of
making supply available.

Escalating costs
For an extended time, design improvements in liquefaction plants and
tankers had the effect of reducing costs.

costs for LNG has been dashed in recent
years. The surge in demand for LNG that
began in the late 1990s has taxed the
capabilities of experienced engineeringprocurement-construction (EPC) contractors and manufacturing capacities of
firms supplying some of the sophisticated materials and machinery required
for LNG. The result has been a very large
supply bottleneck for construction of
new plants.
There are a very few EPC contractors
with the experience to handle the complex construction that LNG requires,
and they are effectively overloaded.
While one might expect over time that

new entrants in the field would learn to
become reliable suppliers, the risks in
the short term are that projects built by
the newer contractors will fail to come
in on time and on budget. Meanwhile,
“demand pull” inflation has hit the
industry and reversed the long period
of declining costs.
The reason for the “crunch” on
the suppliers is evident in looking at
the growth in demand for new capacity. With a typical 4-year design and
construction period for most LNG
plants, the plants scheduled to come
on line over the next 4 years might be
described as the “order book.”

It is important to note that this forecast is more conservative than most others (Fig. 3). Its conservative estimates
reflect two basic assumptions:
1. It adopts the view of IEA and EIA
that high prices have moderated the
demand for natural gas and reduced the
potential requirements for interregional
gas trade.
2. It does not foresee early resolution to the industry’s cost, geopolitical,
and arctic technology problems.

world’s reserves are currently uncommitted. While not all of the gas is

producers reserve some of it to back

Following very difficult negotiations,
Shell ultimately relinquished control of
the project to Gazprom (OGJ Online,
Dec. 21, 2006).
Subsequently, Russia reopened the licensing agreement with a BP subsidiary
for Kovykta. These moves suggest that
the Russia wants to reexert centralized
control over East Siberian and Sakhalin
reserves.
The country appears to be trying to develop a coordinated internal
gas transportation grid from which it
can serve both domestic and export
markets. It has shown an interest in a
pipeline system that would link Sakhalin and East Siberian reserves with its
West Siberian reserves that serve Eastern
and Western Europe. Such a system
would give Russia the choice of LNG
or pipeline exports as well as destination flexibility to serve Atlantic basin or
Pacific basin markets.
But it is in the West where some of
the Russian policy questions have the
greatest potential impact on world LNG
markets. In West Siberia, the NadymPur-Taz region has been the workhorse
of the Russian gas industry. Russia has

tional oil companies were attempting to
join with Gazprom to develop Shtokman. Although the Russian government
at one point rejected their overtures,
they appear to be back on the table with
the signing of an agreement with Total
(OGJ Online, July 13, 2007) and StatoilHydro (OGJ Online, Oct. 26, 2007).
The uncertainties involving Russia’s gas export plans have a substantial
impact how Atlantic basin LNG develops. If Russia decides to concentrate on
pipeline exports, which it knows best,
and if the European customers grow
more comfortable with Russian gas
policies, it would have two effects on
future LNG trade: It would reduce Rus-

sia’s LNG offerings, but it also would
reduce European competition for LNG.
Europe has the pipeline as well as the
LNG option. North America and most
of the Pacific basin must rely on LNG
for interregional trade.
The Middle East accounts for 40%
of both the world’s proved reserves and
its uncommitted reserves. But 61% of
the region’s uncommitted gas is in a
single gas field shared between Qatar
(the North field) and Iran (South Pars).
If one adds in the uncommitted gas
elsewhere in Iran, those two countries
account for nearly 90% of the Middle
East’s uncommitted gas (Fig. 8).

Nadym-Pur-Taz contains the world’s
second and third largest gas fields—
Urengoi and Yamburg. But these two
fields, together with another super
giant—Medvezhye—are in advanced
stages of depletion at a decline rate
estimated at 2 bcfd/year.1 In 2002
Gazprom brought another supergiant—
Zapolyarnoye—on line to maintain
production rates.
But Russia appears to want to tap the
other major undeveloped producing
basins before undertaking significant
further market expansion. These new
reserves are likely to be costly and, in
the case of the Arctic offshore fields,
technically difficult.
For a time, it appeared that Russia favored a pipeline from the Yamal
Peninsula to Western Europe as the next
step. Russia has alienated some of its
major European customers, however,
both through supply interruptions to
the Ukraine (that were perceived by
some as politically motivated) and
Russian refusal to allow independent
Russian producers access to Gazprom’s
pipelines, a third-party access policy
the European Union strongly advocates.
Some of the European interest in LNG is
partly motivated by a desire to diversify
away from too much dependence on
Russian supplies.
Emergence of North American interest in LNG appeared to offer Russia a
diversification option of its own. By
shifting to the Shtokman field in the
Barents Sea, Russia contemplated a
landing at Murmansk that could supply
an LNG export facility as well as be
extended south to St. Petersburg, where
it could supply both Russia’s new Nordstream Pipeline under the Baltic and
also a small proposed LNG facility at
Primorsk.
More recently, Russia seems to have
cooled somewhat on the idea of a Murmansk LNG export facility, although it
still is interested in the Shtokman pipeline connection to the Baltic. It has not
given up on the Yamal option, however.
Development of Shtokman faces a
technological challenge because of its
Arctic offshore location. Several interna-

1997 and has elected an aggressive policy of LNG expansion since that time. It
is expected to account for nearly 40%
of the entire world’s increase in capacity
1996-2011.
Qatar has adopted a “wait and see”
policy for further LNG expansion beyond that point, however, both to digest
the consequences of its rapid growth
and better to understand how the complex gas field behaves. Thus what has
been the engine of recent Middle East
LNG supply growth will be switched
off, for how long it is difficult to tell.
The United Arab Emirates (Abu
Dhabi) and Oman are also LNG exporters, and Yemen has an active project
under way. But the early outlook for
expansion from these sources over the
forecast period is limited.
The US Geological Survey is very
optimistic about undiscovered gas
resources in Saudi Arabia, but that
country has not yet found that gas nor
shown any interest in gas exports. As
long as Qatar maintains its decision
against expansion beyond 2011, further
Middle East LNG growth 2011-20 will
have to come largely from Iran.
That country faces two issues that do
not apply to Qatar: It has a very rapidly
growing domestic market (fueled in
part by subsidized pricing policies)
and it needs gas for reinjection into
its complex oil fields. It is developing
South Pars on the basis of 20 (perhaps
as much as 23, if the gas proves to be
there) production blocks of about 1
bcfd each.
Five of the first eight blocks are
designated for domestic markets and
three for oil field injection. Exports will
not be implemented until Blocks 9 and
10 come on stream at some point in
the future. Five LNG projects have been
proposed for subsequent North Field
blocks, as well as several that would
utilize other Iranian gas fields.
The issue of whether to export LNG
is of itself controversial within Iran, but
the largest barrier to Iran’s development
of LNG is the international political
climate. The imposition of sanctions on
Iran, which have recently become more
56

binding with the standoff over nuclear
enrichment, denies Iran access to technology and most international markets.
Although the current geopolitical standoff will presumably not last forever, it
is very difficult to put any realistic time
line on when Iranian projects are likely
to be commercialized.
Other countries have significant
available reserves for LNG export Fig. 9.
But geopolitical issues that inhibit LNG
development are not unique to Russia and the Middle East. Bolivia, Libya,
Nigeria, and Venezuela have substantial
gas reserves and potential LNG projects
under consideration. But each of them
faces geopolitical problems in developing new LNG projects.
Our base case assumes that some
of these geopolitical problems will be
resolved and some of the supply potential will be realized. But the bulk of the
supply limitations that define our low
case comes from projects that have been
proposed for these regions.

Regional implications
The base case envisions a world LNG
demand growing to 362 million tonnes
by 2020 from 138 million tonnes in
2005. While Atlantic basin markets will
grow much more rapidly over the period than the Pacific basin markets, they
still will not surpass the Pacific over the
forecast period (Fig. 10).
The three biggest importing
regions—Northeast Asia, OECD Europe, and the North American Atlantic
Coast—among them account for more
than 80% of world trade. Despite their
potential importance, China and India
account for only 5% and 3%, respectively.
Qatar dominates LNG supply additions out to 2011but has adopted
a “wait and see” policy for further
expansion beyond that point. While it
is probable that Qatar will revisit that
conservative policy at some point, it
is speculative to include further Qatar
supply beyond 2011 (Fig. 11).
Beyond 2010, the greatest contributions to base-case supply come from
North Africa, West Africa, and Austra-

lia. Southeast Asia, given some of the
problems in Indonesia, does not show
significant growth.
Indonesia, which was the world’s
largest LNG supplier as recently as 2005
until being surpassed by Qatar, shows
virtually no growth in the forecast. The
country is grappling with the desire to
use more of its gas domestically, and we
expect it to limit export growth to new
projects. On the other hand, Australia
emerges as the second largest supplier
after Qatar by 2015, followed closely by
Nigeria. ✦

Preliminary data for
2007 show that worldwide LNG trade grew
by 7.9% to 172 million
tonnes. The Asia-Pacific
market accounted for
LNG
about 65% of worldwide LNG trade, or 112
million tonnes. LNG imports into Asia
increased by 9.6% because of strong
demand from both established markets
(Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) and emerging markets (India and China).
This article will analyze LNG demand outlook for emerging buyers and
potential new buyers (Singapore, Hong
Kong, and Thailand). Fig. 1 presents
LNG demand for the region through
2015.
India’s gas consumption has been
increasing rapidly and future demand
outlook remains strong. Having become
in 2004 Asia’s fourth LNG buyer, India
has imported 8.5 million tonnes/year
(tpy) in 2007, according to preliminary
data.
While domestic gas demand will
increase further, LNG demand growth
will depend on its price competitiveness relative to coal, piped gas, and fuel
oil. In short, it is difficult for India in
the future to pay what established markets—ones that have already become
dependent on LNG—will have to pay.
Meanwhile, China has become Asia’s
fifth largest LNG importer with the
inaugural cargo arriving at China’s sole
operating terminal at Guangdong from
Australia’s Northwest Shelf (NWS)
project in May 2006. Estimated 2007
Chinese imports are 2.9 million tonnes.
The country has long had ambitious plans for LNG imports. Like India,
however, its ambitions have increasingly encountered the reality that LNG
has become increasingly scarce and
expensive. A couple of years ago, nearly
every province along the coast planned
to import LNG. Many of these plans,
however, have been dealt a hard blow
by rising gas prices since 2005 and
have been shelved.
As demand for gas continues to
increase, China has relied more on

SPECIAL

domestic sources to meet
its need. In the long run,
however, China still has the
potential to be an important player in the Asian
LNG market.
Other Asian countries,
such as Singapore, Hong
Kong, and Thailand, are
planning to import LNG as

commencing in 2012. Thailand is another potential LNG market by 2017.

to the dominance of coal and CR&W
(combustible renewables and & waste)
sources of energy. Two factors will play
a key role in determining future gas
demand—supply of gas and the affordability for Indian consumers.
We believe gas demand in India is
infinite at $2-3/MMbtu but limited at
$6-7/MMbtu. It is a question of what
prices are affordable to which sectors.
Power generation and fertilizer production are mature sectors for gas and are
partly subsidized by the government.
On the other hand, the industrial and
city gas sectors are emerging markets
with higher affordability.
58

2010

2015

Fig. 2 shows that the power sector
has the largest share of gas consumption, accounting for 38.6% in 2006.
Based on our assumption that overall
electricity demand will grow at an average growth of 5.5-6%/year through
2015, gas consumption in the power
sector will grow at 8-9%/year through
2015.
Gas use in power generation, however, will be heavily influenced by price
and would have to compete with domestic and imported coal. The preferred
price for gas in the power sector is less
than $6/MMbtu (delivered) in order
to keep generation costs at 5.6-6.7¢/

kw-hr. Beyond the $6/MMbtu price,
demand for gas in power generation
would decline significantly. We project
that increased volumes of domestic
gas (mainly from offshore basins on
the east coast) will be used for power
generation.
Industrial users (such as steel and
petrochemical industries, glass and
ceramic companies, electronic device
manufacturers, and others) are significant users of gas. Gas-consumption
growth in the industrial sector will be
strong due to the higher affordability
of this sector. Gas-consumption growth
in the industrial sector will be about
15-16%/year between now and 2015.
The “other” sector, consisting of
the fertilizer industries and LPG/C2-C3
shrinkage, is the second largest gas consumer (accounting for 38% in 2006)
in India. Growth in the fertilizer sector
will be due to new gas-based urea
plants, as well as conversion of naphthabased plants to gas. Overall, “other”
sector will grow at about 7-8%/year
through 2015.
The transport sector is likely to show
strong growth in gas consumption with
growing CNG usage. This follows the
decision of the government of India
progressively to extend the CNG program to more than 10 cities. Consumption in the sector will grow by 9%/year
through 2015.
Domestic gas consumption, then,
will grow at 13-14%/year through
2010 before slowing to 8-9%/year
between 2010 and 2015. Thus, India’s
gas demand will be 6.6 bscfd by 2010,
rising to 10.0 bscfd by 2015.

LNG demand outlook
India became the fourth LNG importer in Asia in January 2004, with
LNG imports entering the Petronet
LNG Ltd. (PLL) terminal at Dahej. These
imports were from Qatar’s RasGas at 4.3
million tonnes in 2005 and an estimated 5.0 million tonnes in 2006.
Shell’s Hazira terminal began operating in early 2005 and has been importing spot cargoes. Further spot volumes
were from various sources, thereby

bringing India’s total imports to 4.5
million tonnes in 2005 and 6.2 million tonnes in 2006. In 2007, India’s
total imports will likely be 8.5 million tonnes (consisting of 6.8 million
tonnes to Dahej and 1.7 million tonnes
to Hazira).
The future of LNG demand depends
on its price competitiveness compared
with coal, piped gas, and fuel oil. The
recent discovery of gas by Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL) of 30-50 tcf in
the KG basin is bound to bring about
changes in the competitiveness of piped
domestic gas relative to LNG imports.
KG Basin will not be sufficient, however, to meet India’s growing gas demand,
and gas imports (in the form of LNG or
piped gas) will be necessary.
There is a pipeline import possibility from Iran that presents, however,
many hurdles to clear for this option.
For now, India has backed down from
signing the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline agreement after failing to reach an
agreement on the gas price and transit
fees through Pakistan.
But things could change. Although
pipeline-gas import volumes could be
potentially substantial, LNG imports
will remain essential, as there is a
significant amount of uncertainty and
instability associated with the pipeline
imports from Iran. In our base-case
scenario, India’s total LNG imports will
rise to 10.5 million tpy by 2010 and to
14.0 million tpy by 2015.

O UTLOOK FOR CHINA’S CONSUMPTION

LNG contracts

cember 2009. The LNG export deal has
not been approved by the Iranian High
Economic Council, however, while
progress on the upstream side in Iran
has been very slow.
As a result, there is no agreed price,
delivery time, or firm commitment. In
our view, the chances of Iran LNG coming to India prior to 2015 are slim.
3. On a short-term basis, Qatar’s
RasGas has been supplying Petronet
about two cargoes/month since July
2007. This agreement will last until September 2008, with a possible extension
to December 2008.

Currently, India has two long-term
sales and purchase agreements (SPAs)
and one short-term contract.
1. The first contract was signed
between Petronet and Qatar’s RasGas
for 20 years, in which RasGas would
supply 5 million tpy of LNG on FOB
basis. Petronet and RasGas signed a side
letter of agreement in August 2006 that
covers the increase of the contractual
volumes up to 7.5 million tpy from
2009.
2. In June 2005, Iran and India (by
GAIL and IOC) signed an LNG deal—5

imports will continue increasing as the
government further deregulates the gas

contract volumes) will likely increase
toward 2015, while there is spot demand in the future.

a joint venture between CNOOC and
BP. For 2006 as a whole, 11 cargoes of
LNG were imported by China, totaling
0.7 million tonnes.
During the first 11 months of 2007,
China imported 44 cargoes of LNG
totaling 2.7 million tonnes, including 37 cargoes from Australia and 7
spot cargoes from Algeria, Nigeria, and
Oman.
As Fig. 4 shows, China’s future natural gas consumption growth is likely
to come from domestic production,
which is supplemented by LNG imports
and imports of pipelined gas. In 2007,
China’s estimated LNG imports are
slightly less than 3 million tonnes.
Under our base-case scenario, China
will import 7.0 million tonnes of LNG
in 2010 and 14 million tonnes in 2015

has growing amounts of uncommitted
LNG demand over the next couple of

(45%), a wholly owned subsidiary of
CNOOC. The contract volume is about 3
million tpy for 25 years.
The accompanying table summarizes
China’s supply and demand balance
until 2015.
In early September 2007, PetroChina
signed a binding heads of agreement
(HOA) with Shell for 20 years of LNG
supply at 1 million tpy. The HOA covers
the key terms of the transaction and the
two parties are aiming to conclude a
SPA in the near future.
Also in September 2007, PetroChina
signed a nonbinding agreement including key commercial terms with Woodside for 15-20 years of LNG supply
at 2-3 million tpy from the proposed
Browse basin gas reserves. The agreement is subject to conditions, including
final investment decisions on both Gorgon and Browse projects and relevant
government approvals.
Separately, two Chinese state oil
companies have signed a preliminary
agreement with Iran. Sinopec has
a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with Iran LNG for 10 million
tpy. Iran LNG has marketed more gas
than the project can supply, however,
and is facing indefinite delays. PetroChina has an HOA with Pars LNG for 3
million tpy over 25 years, but there has
been little progress lately for executing
the agreement.
China currently has one LNG terminal in operation, Guangdong, which
has been quietly expanded to 5 million
tpy recently from 3.7 million tpy. Two
terminals are under construction: Fujian
(2.6 million tpy) and Shanghai (3.0
million tpy). Fujian is nearing completion and may be operating this year if
spot deals are made.
In addition, China has at least four
terminal projects approved by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China, which is the

are proposed. Unless supply contracts
are secured, however, many of these
projects will be seriously delayed.
The biggest problems facing the

*1992-2007, annual average; 2008-15, estimated annual average.

Chinese natural gas industry and future
growth of natural gas use lie in these
areas: prices, market developments,
distribution networks, and foreign
investment in China.
Globally, oil and gas prices are entering high plateaus. Rising LNG prices
have delayed all but a few terminal projects in China in the recent past. Natural
gas use for power generation is still a
big problem. China’s natural gas market
is fragmented with multiple rules and
price regimes. The market needs to
be developed further to facilitate the
expansion of natural gas use. Lack of a
distribution network or lack of investment in a distribution network for
various cities may hinder town-gas use
for years after the pipelines are in place
and LNG terminals are built. China is
also still lagging behind in providing
proper fiscal and price regimes to attract
foreign investment in the country’s upstream sector, gas pipelines, and town
gas. It has a long way to go.

Potential markets
Three markets present possible
growth areas for LNG in Asia.

Singapore
Natural gas currently accounts for
about 18% of Singapore’s primary en-

ergy consumption, while oil dominates
the balance. By 2015, natural gas will
likely account for around 18% of its
primary energy consumption, mainly
due to increased demand from the
power sector.
Singapore relies on gas imports for
supplies, as there are no domestic gas
fields. Imports are from three pipelines: one from Malaysia, one from Indonesia’s offshore West Natuna fields,
and another from Indonesia’s Sumatra
fields.
Before 1992, Singapore’s power was
generated solely by petroleum products.
Since the start of natural gas imports,
however, gas’s share of power generation has risen dramatically to around
74% in 2007, from around 18.5% in
2000. Its market share will reach 83%
by 2015.
Gas use in the power sector will
post an average growth of around 5%/
year from 2007 to 2015. For the same
period, industrial sector demand will
increase by 5.1%/year on average. The
two fastest demand growth rates will
come from transportation and residential sectors albeit from a small base (Fig.
6). Overall, gas consumption will post
an average growth of 5%/year.

Prospects for LNG
A small-scale LNG receiving terminal in Singapore makes sense, as a

HKCG uses natural gas as alternate feedstock

lower than current naphtha prices.

means of diversifying gas supply and
creating price competition for piped
gas imports. The price of piped natural
gas is currently very high because it is
linked to high-sulfur fuel oil, which
has increased in price due to a variety
of factors including rapid growth in
Chinese fuel-oil imports (Fig. 7).
When gas imports first started in the
early 1990s, from Malaysia, gas prices
were in $2-3/MMbtu. This stimulated
demand growth for the fuel in power
generation. Prices today, however, have
moved in tandem with increased oil
prices—and increased fuel-oil prices—
resulting in average import prices at
around $10/MMbtu.
Singapore’s government approved
the project to build a 3-million-tpy
LNG terminal (capacity capped at 6
million tpy) by 2012. Exclusive LNG
import license will go to the aggregator,
which is expected to be chosen by April
2008. This exclusive right will lapse
only in 2018. While Singapore expects
to import 1 million tpy of LNG by
2012, rising to 3 million tpy by 2018,
we believe the buildup in import volumes may likely be slower at 2 million
tpy by 2018.

Hong Kong
Natural gas’s share accounts for 15%
of Hong Kong’s primary energy consumption in 2007, while the balance

is dominated by oil (47%) and coal
(34%). By 2015, natural gas will likely
account for about 22%, mainly due to
increased demand in the power sector.
Gas demand as of 2007 stands at
around 325 MMscfd, with almost all
volumes consumed in the power sector and marginal consumption in the
industrial sector (for the production of
town gas). This will eventually change,
as there are plans for Hong Kong to
introduce natural gas to the residential
and commercial sector while increasing
city gas use.
Introduction of natural gas in the
residential and commercial sector was
originally to come online in 2006-07.
Because of technical (lack of infrastructure) and gas supply issues, however,
the natural gas conversion program
will only move ahead sometime around
2012 when LNG imports commence
(Fig. 8).
The main driver for natural gas
growth in the future will derive from
environmental concerns. As power
companies in Hong Kong are the main
sources of pollution, the shift in preference away from coal and petroleum
products toward gas has been prevalent
in the economy.
Currently Hong Kong imports gas
from two sources:
1. China’s Yacheng 13-1 field via a
778-km gas pipeline.

With a shortfall in contracted gas
supply occurring as early as 2012,
Hong Kong has decided to build a
3-million-tpy LNG receiving terminal
by Hong Kong utility CLP Holdings
Ltd., mainly for power generation.
As with Singapore, Hong Kong pays
international prices for oil products
and has a threshold for internationally
priced LNG. FGE forecasts Hong Kong
LNG imports will commence in 2012
with a minimal import of 0.5 million
tpy, rising to around 1.5 million tpy by
2015.

Thailand
Thailand’s natural gas demand has
grown dramatically over the last 2
decades. From 1990 to 2000, natural
gas demand grew at an average 13.5%/
year, while from 2000 to 2005 demand
slowed slightly to 8.9%. Natural gas has
the second largest share of Thailand’s
primary energy consumption, accounting for 27% of the country’s demand,
outweighed only by oil (47%), followed by coal, combustible renewables
and waste, and hydropower. Although
oil will continue to dominate all fuels
in absolute numbers, natural gas will
post strong growth averaging 4.9%/
year 2007-15 compared with oil at
3%/year
The power sector dominates Thailand’s gas demand. In 2007, it accounted for 68% of gas demand followed
by the others sector at 21%—which
primarily consists of gas processing
plants—and the industrial sector at
11%. Within the power sector itself,
natural gas as a fuel made up 70%
of power generated followed by coal
(21%) and hydro (5%). Thailand also
imports around 3% of its electricity,
while fuel oil and diesel oil constitute
only 2% of power generated.

Special Report

Thailand currently imports gas solely
from Myanmar via the Yadana and Yetagun pipelines under long-term takeor-pay contracts. In 2008, Thailand will
begin to import gas via the MalaysiaThailand joint development project
from Blocks A-18 (400 MMscfd), while
delivery of gas from B-17 and B-17-01
will begin in first-half 2008 at 135
MMscfd for the first 10 years.

Prospects for LNG
Since domestic production cannot
keep up with rising domestic demand,
Thailand increased its import dependency from Myanmar. That dependency
on pipeline gas imports has raised
the issue of supply security, however,
and PTT PLC has set up a subsidiary,
PTTLNG, to handle LNG issues for the
country.
PTT’s initial enthusiasm for the LNG
terminal was tempered, however, by
higher prices reflecting the emerging
LNG sellers’ market in 2006. Nevertheless, PTT still appears keen to proceed
with the planned 5-million-tpy receiving terminal at Map Ta Phut in the
Rayong Province. The company has
announced that it will spend nearly $1
billion to construct a deepsea port and
receiving terminal at the planned site
by 2011.
PTT also signed a preliminary agreement in July 2006 to receive 3 million
tpy of LNG from Iranian Pars LNG,
reflecting thereby the company’s desire
for an LNG project. Such uncertain issues, however, as Iran’s ability to supply
LNG in the near future and whether
Thailand can pay market rates led FGE
to extend its base-case scenario forecasts
of LNG imports to 2017 with initial
volumes at around 1.3 million tpy. ✦

Congress offers
bad reasons for
bad energy bill
Doing good things for good reasons is
best; good things for bad reasons, lucky;
bad things for good reasons, wrong; and
bad things for bad reasons, stupid.
Taxing oil and gas to fund renewable
energy is a bad thing to do. Lowering US
dependency on foreign oil is a bad reason
to do it.
“We need an energy plan that reduces
our dependency on foreign oil and invests

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

in clean, renewable technology that will create jobs here in America,” said House Ways
and Means chairman Charles B. Rangel in
support of a new energy blunder.
Rangel and fellow Democrats have
revived an effort to raise taxes—they misleadingly say end “subsidies”—of oil and
gas companies. Proceeds would pay for an
extension of tax incentives for renewable
energy (OGJ Online, Feb. 13, 2008).
The legislation would limit the use by
oil companies of a tax credit that helps US
companies compete abroad. It also would
reduce the deductibility of non-US production taxes in calculations of taxable US
income.
The combined effect is a tax increase
on the oil and gas industry of $17.65 billion over 10 years—money that can’t be
invested in oil and gas supply.
By explicitly making them substitutes
for rather than supplements to oil and gas,
the legislation takes the worst possible
approach to renewable energy forms. It
forces Americans to use expensive energy
in place of something cheaper.
And it wouldn’t lower US dependence
on foreign oil. Along with gains in output
of renewable energy would come declines,
thanks to the tax hikes, in US production
of oil.
Rangel’s other promises are equally
hollow.
Renewable energy forms are not, as
experience with ethanol is showing, the environmental panaceas their supporters say
they are. And weakening the economy by
forcing expensive energy into the market is
no way to create jobs.
A sounder way to cut US reliance on foreign oil and create jobs—and to earn rather
than spend public money—is to expand oil
and gas leasing of federal land.
But congressional Democrats have their
own way. And it’s stupid.

Greenspan: Odds favor recession
At Cambridge Energy Research Associates’ annual energy conference in Houston,
former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said there is a “50% or better”
chance that the US will experience an economic recession that will curtail energy
demand.
“We are at stall speed in the US but haven’t yet seen the discontinuity that
characterizes recession,” he said. It is “quite remarkable,” Greenspan said, that the
US economy is able to do reasonably well with oil prices near historic highs. That’s
because “business was in such extraordinary good shape before this problem hit,”
that credit availability has not yet dried up for US industry.
Greenspan said, “Global warming is real, but its solution is going to be much
more difﬁcult than we’d like to admit. There’s a presumption that we’ll solve this [fuel
and climate] problem with new technologies. I wish that were true.” He warned that
a “mandatory cap on carbon emissions risks capping energy inputs into the gross
domestic product while lowering production and increasing unemployment.” He
said, “I’m a strong advocate of competitive market capitalism. It’s the only viable
system through which societies can produce signiﬁcant material well being. However, with its increasing required conceptual inputs and technology, income inequality
has risen. We cannot have a system, no matter how powerful, that doesn’t have the
support of the people.”
In a separate study, economists at the Deutsche Bank AG, New York, reported
core retail spending in the US was up just 1.4% in nominal terms over the past 12
months. “Such a reading, historically, has been consistent with recession,” said
Adam Sieminski, Deutsche Bank’s chief energy economist in New York. He said: “The
sharp slowdown in spending increases the likelihood that inventories will have to be
pared back this quarter, in particular in the retail sector. The combination of faltering
consumer spending alongside modestly rising retail inventories does not bode well
for current quarter gross domestic product growth. For this reason, Deutsche Bank
now sees more inventory liquidation this quarter relative to what we were assuming,
enough in our view to push our estimate of current quarter real GDP growth from a
ﬂat reading down into negative territory, and one step closer to a mild recession.”
However, Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London, noted supply-side
changes have been the key source of energy price variability since 2004. Moreover,
he said world oil demand now is concentrated outside the member nations of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and primarily in the
Middle East and China. “So the link from the day-to-day ﬂow of US economic data
onto oil demand has become an extremely tenuous one,” he said.
Energy supplies
The International Energy Agency in Paris estimated crude supply growth outside
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties will average 970,000 b/d in 2008,
with most of that growth coming in the second half of the year vs. 2007 growth that
was front-end loaded. For a third consecutive month, IEA in February raised its forecast demand for OPEC crude.
Barlays Capital maintained its forecast of negligible non-OPEC supply growth
in 2008. “Indeed, stripping out biofuels and Canadian oil sands, we expect conventional non-OPEC oil supply to fall,” Horsnell reported. “For 2008, we see the major
[non-OPEC supply] increments as coming from Brazil (314,000 b/d), Russia (203,000
b/d), and Azerbaijan (176,000 b/d).” However, he said, “The key thing about the three
gainers (a combined rise of 693,000 b/d) is that they are offset by the three major
sources of decline. We are currently projecting the combined decline in 2008 from
Mexico, UK, and Norway to amount to 692,000 b/d.”
Horsnell said, “For conventional non-OPEC oil supply to fall outside of the former
Soviet Union is not a new phenomenon; indeed output is already some 2 million b/d
below the 2002 peak. However, a fall in conventional oil output across non-OPEC as
a whole is a somewhat more noteworthy an event.”
Deutsch Bank’s Sieminski warned, “One matter to watch closely is growth in
OPEC natural gas liquids that traditionally is added to non-OPEC supply because
OPEC does not count NGL in quotas. The IEA’s OPEC NGL forecast was revised lower
for 2008 after reassessing Saudi Arabian start-up schedules. IEA and the US Department of Energy expect 300,000 b/d growth in 2008.” He said growth forecasts for
non-OPEC supply in 2009 also should be closely monitored. “The DOE is calling for
1.5 million b/d of basic non-OPEC growth next year, and an additional 600,000 b/d of
OPEC NGL for a total 2.2 million b/d offset against demand for OPEC crude.”

CT services gaining wider acceptance,
but CT drilling lags in US

C

oiled tubing drilling and servicing is among the
fastest-growing sectors in the oil ﬁeld service and
supply industry.
The versatile tool has long been a staple of well
intervention operations, such as workovers, stimulation jobs,
completions, and downhole tool conveyance, to name a few.
In particular, CT well servicing has made dramatic gains in
the offshore sector in recent years.
Although coiled tubing drilling (CTD) is widely accepted in
Canada, the practice has made few inroads into the US market, especially the Lower 48. Consequently, CTD accounts for
only about 15% of the overall CT service sector worldwide.
CT experts interviewed for this article expressed optimism
that CT service work will continue to show robust growth
and that CTD will ﬁnd greater acceptance in the Lower 48.
In addition, CT well intervention and drilling activity will continue to expand into new markets and into new applications
in existing markets, those experts say.
Even a downturn in conventional drilling activity
shouldn’t inhibit the growth of CT services, they note, adding that the CT service sector could in fact beneﬁt from
such a downturn.

of CTD is in managing the cyclical pattern of adoption applied
to CTD since the mid-1990s, says Gordon Mackenzie, product line manager for the Thru-Tubing Intervention product line
of Baker Oil Tools.
“The potential to achieve signiﬁcant reserve gains at an
economic margin appears never to have been greater than in
the present climate,” he claims. “Where we see continued
success in [CTD] operations is probably best evidenced by
operations in Alaska, where the operator realized early that
to achieve the perceived potential value that initial learning
curves need to be accepted, the practice evolved and the
course stuck to.”
For Perry Courville, group manager for Halliburton Co.’s
coiled tubing and hydraulic workover product service lines,
a key challenge for CTD is the recognition that major differences exist in equipment requirements and speciﬁcations
for drilling operations compared with the most common intervention applications.
“The history of the evolution of using coiled tubing to
replace jointed pipe for drilling is plagued with examples
of force-ﬁtting conventional intervention equipment into a
drilling operation,” he contends. “This force-ﬁtting has often concealed the real upside of
using coiled tubing for drilling.

Pulsonix® Service in Straddled Formation Adds
$27.4 Million in Value
The Challenge:
Egypt — Two Cretaceous sandstone reservoirs were completed as
a straddled completion, accessed through a Sliding Side-Door®
(SSD) valve. The operator had expected production of 1,0001,200 BOPD, but the zone initially produced only 200 BOPD, and
later declined further to an intermittent flow of 0-50 BOPD.
Because the zones of interest were isolated from the main
wellbore and only accessible through the SSD valve, direct
access to the perforations was impossible.

The Solution:
Halliburton recommended improving the stimulation
treatment with its Pulsonix® service, which combines coiled
tubing efficiency with fluidic oscillator technology to treat damage and stimulate production.
Using the Pulsonix tool, the team sent out acoustic pulses to help fatigue the suspected debris buildup in the zones.
Clay-Safe™ F fluid and Fines Control™ acid, part of the Sandstone 2000™ acid system, were then pumped at 60
GPF and 28 GPF, respectively. Volumes were controlled to minimize the job cost, and Clayfix™ material was used for
over-displacing the acid and then again for the displacement stage.

The Results:
After stimulation, the well initially flowed at 1,500-1,600 BPD, without artificial
lift. Production later stabilized at approximately 1,300 BOPD. The economic value
created by the Pulsonix tool and the Sandstone 2000 system solution is more than
$27.4 million, including $120,000 in reduced job costs. “Halliburton provided an
excellent stimulation job,” the operator wrote. “We intend to continue working with

ew advances in technology, focused on improving coiled tubing efﬁciency and reliability, are driving growing acceptance of CT services in the oil

Experts interviewed for this article discussed the advances in CT technology that will have the greatest impact in a

notes: “A key feature in some of these processes is the use
of hydrajet perforating and fracture initiation, which improves
near-wellbore connectivity to the fracture and allows for multiple fracture placements without tripping out of the hole.”
Courville contends that one of the most successful and widely
used techniques for unperforated, cemented-casing completions
in vertical or horizontal wells, CobraMax service, is performed
with a CT tubing-deployed hydrajet bottomhole assembly (BHA):
“There are no packers or mechanical devices to set. The BHA
is moved to the ﬁrst target, and perforating is accomplished by
hydrajetting via the coiled tubing. The annulus is closed in to enable breaking down the perforations, and the fracture treatment
is pumped through the annulus. During the fracturing treatment,
the coiled tubing is moved above the treatment interval and acts
as a dead string for fracture diagnostics. A ﬁnal proppant stage of
noncrosslinked (linear) ﬂuid with high proppant concentration is
pumped to induce a near-wellbore proppant pack that further improves near-wellbore conductivity and develops a sand plug that
serves as a diversion method for treatments further uphole.”

The subsea installation market segment receives much attention from service companies, although an end user in an
operating company may have a completely different perspective, points out Perry Courville, group manager for Halliburton
Inc.’s CT and hydraulic workover product service lines.
“A reason may be that an operator could be expecting the
coiled tubing or slickline/e-line intervention company to be the
dominant player in an intervention campaign,” he explains. “But
the reality is that the intervention company provides only a fraction of the technology and resources required to bring intervention capabilities to a

installation.

most signiﬁcant being its introduction and continued development of Z-Seal Technology. This technology, a previous recipient of the [Intervention & Coiled Tubing Association European Chapter’s] Intervention Technology Award, achieves the
wellbore seal with the use of a metal-to-metal methodology
rather than reliance on an elastomeric-based seal.”

Extended-reach/multilateral wells
The main issue relating to CT in extended-reach applications
regards the challenge of getting the coil and BHA to the
required intervention depth while overcoming the effects of
helical buckling and lock-up, and still be able to have any
available set-down weight when there—if required—to perform the planned operation, says Mackenzie.
“I believe we will continue to see signiﬁcant technology
strides in the development of tractoring systems and other
such methodologies, such as vibration-inducing tools to
break friction lock-up,” he says.
On the lateral front, one of the key issues today is to
identify the required lateral location for entry and how to
reliably and consistently get the CT and BHA to enter it,
Mackenzie notes: “Some systems do exist today to help in
this, but I would suggest there is still a technology gap to
be ﬁlled here.”

ages continue to evolve, it is not inconceivable that CT intervention applications will be
remotely monitored with the use of data and
video links.”

Motors
Uniform-thickness power section technology
has pushed the boundaries of conventional
motor development and performance for CT
applications, says Blake Hammond, global
product line manager for Weatherford International Ltd.’s
Thru-Tubing division.
“Deploying small-diameter motors on CT can be challenging, but uniform-thickness power sections deliver the
operator a far greater operating window before inducing
a stall,” he says. “That reduced stall sensitivity can often
mean the difference between success and failure. The fatigue life of the CT is exhausted with each cycle across the
gooseneck, especially while under high pressure, so each
stall (which must be rectiﬁed by cycling the CT) can be very
costly. Reducing stalls, especially in a high-pressure environment, can translate to huge savings to the client.”

Tractor technology
Improvements in CT tractor technology will have a noteworthy impact on drilling extended-reach and ultra-extendedreach wells, according in Brian Schwanitz, vice-president,
global sales and marketing, Welltec AS.
“As tractor technology continues to mature, the newest
versions will have higher speed and reliability than current
versions and will allow these difﬁcult interventions to be
more cost-effective and therefore easier to justify,” he says.
“This will then allow the industry to push the current limit of
what CT can do in these wells.”
CT drilling companies have been experimenting with
using tractors for extending the limit of current reach
(3,500–4,000 ft), notes Schwanitz.
“The tractor provides both additional weight on bit and
control of the reactive torque, which reduces drilling efﬁciency,” he says. “More-reliable and intelligent tractors will
enable CT drilling to extend the range of applications, which
is another good thing for the industry.” ]

It is likely that with the introduction of “smart ﬁshing”—utilizing real-time mud pulse telemetry technology in threaded
pipe applications—the industry will see further use of this
technology applied to CT ﬁshing operations, rather than just
for CT drilling, claims Mackenzie.
“This mud pulse

RECOVERY METHODS

™

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs once considered economically and
technically impossible. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy.
But they’re still unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing
wells in them are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems.
Producing gas from unconventional reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the
market requires continuous rethinking – the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible
with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 – Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by editors
of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight innovation
from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and learn from other
professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.
So mark your calendar.

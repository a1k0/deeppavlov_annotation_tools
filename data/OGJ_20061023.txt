special report beginning on p. 20 spotlights a private independent‚Äôs
strategies for success in the Deep Bossier trend in East Texas.The
second article, on p. 22, discusses the use of information to manage
E&P performance. On the cover, the Nansen truss spar production
platform on East Breaks Block 602 began production in 2002
in 3,675 ft of water off Texas in the Gulf of Mexico. Independent
Anadarko Petroleum Co.‚Äîwhich became Nansen‚Äôs operator after
acquiring Kerr-McGee Corp. earlier this year‚Äîand Devon Energy

What is
reliability worth?
It‚Äôs simplifying
your complex
completions ‚Äî
especially in tough
well conditions.

Industry Challenge
Deploy liner in difficult conditions that require rotating the liner at
acceptable circulation rates to mitigate the risk of the well bridging off
and the hanger pre-setting ‚Äîa high risk with conventional liner hangers.
Halliburton Solution
The VersaFlex¬Æ expandable liner hanger system ‚Äî with over 250 installations to date and superior liner-top seal integrity ‚Äî has a streamlined design
that withstands aggressive reaming or even drilling to depth. System has no
external parts such as slips, hydraulic-setting cylinders or liner-top packers
used in conventional liners ‚Äî simplifying the complexity of the completion.
Customer Benefit
Optimized capital expenditure. The robust design of the VersaFlex
expandable liner hanger improves rig-time efficiency and helps avoid
costly redundant conditioning trips, hanger damage and premature setting.

Sakhalin-2 environmental damage: $10-50 billion
Russia‚Äôs Federal Service for the Regulation of the Use of Natural
Resources (Rosprirodnadzor) estimates the cost of rectifying environmental damage at the Sakhalin-2 project at $10-50 billion.
‚ÄúThis sum is determined by the high cost of land reclamation
and the cleaning of the seabed in the Aniva bay,‚Äù said Oleg Mitvol,
Rosprirodnadzor deputy head, who led an inspection carried out
by the agency at the facilities of project operator Sakhalin Energy
Co.
The final damage figure cannot be calculated until the end of
next summer, Mitvol said, adding that the Sakhalin Energy ‚Äúhas not
proposed any engineering solutions for eliminating the environmental violations.‚Äù
Meanwhile, Russian Natural Resources Minister Yuriy Trutnev
plans to visit Sakhalin on Oct. 24-26. His aim will be to determine
the degree to which environmental protection legislation has been
implemented at the two oil and gas deposits of the Sakhalin-2 project.

Algeria moves toward oil windfall proÔ¨Åts tax

‚Äî Q u i c k Ta k e s

Jane R. Lewis-Raymond, vice-president, general counsel, corporate secretary, and chief compliance officer at Piedmont Natural
Gas Co., said many of the 197 local energy utilities in AGA‚Äôs membership believe that gas markets, while more transparent than 4
years ago, still need to be improved.
‚ÄúThe shift in policy occurred because we‚Äôre still getting questions about confidence in prices from our customers, which suggests that the only way to increase that is to make reporting mandatory,‚Äù Lewis-Raymond told commissioners and others at FERC‚Äôs
recent conference on markets and prices.
Chris Conway, chairman of the Natural Gas Supply Association,
who also testified on behalf of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said a 60% decline in gas prices this year shows
the market is transparent and robust.
‚ÄúIt would be a serious miscalculation to assume that seasonal
price swings and volatility indicate a lack of transparency or some
other dysfunction in the marketplace,‚Äù said Conway, president of
the gas and power division at ConocoPhillips. ‚ÄúMost often, it signifies quite the opposite, sending accurate information that allows
for an appropriate supply response.‚Äù
Donald F. Santa, president of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said that, while interstate gas pipelines have not
been major gas market participants since FERC unbundled their
services, ‚Äúthere already is tremendous transparency in the natural
gas pricing transaction because of existing posting requirements
for pipelines.‚Äù
While the Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC clear jurisdiction over commodity price reporting, he continued, the commission ‚Äúshould think long and hard before it crosses the threshold
and uses its new authority.‚Äù Santa said, noting, ‚ÄúOnce regulation
begins, it is hard to step back from it.‚Äù

Algerian Energy Minster Chakib Khelil said told reporters in
Algiers this month that he has received no comment from international oil companies regarding a windfall profits oil tax slated to
take effect next year.
The windfall profits tax was part of a law enacted during September. The same law provides state firm Sonatrach to take a 51%
interest in contracts involving IOCs.
Companies from outside Algeria will have to pay the oil tax in
any month when the price of Brent crude averages more than $30/
bbl. The tax rate will vary at 5-50%, depending upon a company‚Äôs
total production.
Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BHP Billiton
Ltd., ENI SPA, and Hess Corp. all have oil operations in Algeria. SPE posts reserves deÔ¨Ånitions for comment

Statoil introduces new Asgard Blend
Statoil ASA introduced a new light, low-sulfur oil grade, Asgard
Blend, based on condensate and crude from Asgard, Kristin, and
Mikkel fields in the Norwegian Sea.
It consists of Asgard Crude, Asgard Condensate, and Kristin
Crude, replacing the previous practice of separate crude and condensate liftings from the field, and will be marketed as a crude mix,

Development

Norsk Hydro still awaiting Shtokman rebuff
Norsk Hydro AS‚Äîone of the companies interested in developing Shtokman gas field with OAO Gazprom in the Barents Sea‚Äîhas
not received official confirmation from Gazprom that its offer has
been rejected, Eivind Reiten, CEO and president of Norsk Hydro
told OGJ.
Speaking Oct. 16 at the inauguration of the Langeled pipeline,
which delivers Norwegian gas from the Sleipner hub to the UK,
Reiten said there was no timetable in place to negotiate with Gazprom until Hydro receives its communication about its status on
the ambitious project.
He added: ‚ÄúWe will discuss providing technology if that‚Äôs an
avenue that Gazprom wants to explore, but before I can comment
any more specifically on that, we have to engage in dialogue.‚Äù
On Oct. 9 Gazprom issued a press release stating that it would
solely develop the Shtokman field for gas exports to Europe despite
keen interest from international companies such as ConocoPhillips, Total SA, Chevron Corp., Statoil ASA, and Norsk Hydro Oil &
Energy (OGJ Online, Oct. 10, 2006).
The announcement shocked the international petroleum industry, considering the technical and logistical challenges facing the
project and the estimated $10-20 billion required to bring it to
fruition. Hydro was viewed as holding a strong advantage over its
competitors because it was experienced in developing such challenging projects; it had drilled the fourth Shtokman appraisal well
with Gazprom and is providing the rig for the seventh well. The
other major surprise was the loss of LNG supplies to North America, as this had been the primary original market for Shtokman gas
(OGJ, Oct. 16, 2006, p. 20).
Gazprom Chief Executive Alexei Miller said earlier that the contenders had been rejected because they ‚Äúwere unable to provide the
capital required.‚Äù Miller said, ‚ÄúForeign companies could not offer
us assets that corresponded in size and quality with the reserves of
8

the company said.
The oil is stored on Asgard, where the Kristin and Mikkel well
streams are also processed. Output from the Asgard A oil production ship and B gas platform was previously piped to two separate
stores, with Kristin production held on the Asgard C storage ship.
The first consignment of the new grade left Asgard earlier this
month for Statoil‚Äôs Kalundborg refinery in Denmark. The next
two loadings are to go to a Dutch plant in Rotterdam and Statoil‚Äôs
Mongstad facility near Bergen. Statoil expects 80-90 Asgard Blend
cargoes of 500,000-855,000 bbl to be lifted annually. Production
is 180,000 b/d.
The Asgard Blend assay is based on samples taken from each
stream contributing to the blend. Since Kristin production is not as
high as expected, Asgard Blend export quality will most likely be
slightly lighter than shown in assay, a difference of about 1¬∞ API,
Statoil said.
Characteristics of the new crude blend are: gravity, 48.9¬∞; specific gravity, 0.7842; sulfur content, 0.08 mass %; pour point, ‚Äì27¬∞
C.; total acid number, <0.01 mg KOH/g; nickel, <0.1 ppm (wt);
vanadium, <0.1 ppm (wt); viscosity at 20¬∞ C., 1.63 cst. ‚ú¶

considered ‚Äúonly as contractors‚Äù for the project.

Total conÔ¨Årms Block 17 oil Ô¨Ånd off Angola
State-owned Sonangol and Total E&P Angola reported that the
Orquidea-2 appraisal well has confirmed and expanded the potential of the Orquidea oil discovery on Block 17 off Angola.
Drilled in 1,165 m of water 2 km from the discovery well,
Orquidea-2 encountered the same Miocene objectives as did
Orquidea-1 and also identified deeper Oligocene reservoir levels.
Both the Tertiary Miocene and Oligocene objectives are oil-bearing.
The two-well success on the Orquidea structure, near the Lirio,
Cravo, and Violeta finds, confirms the potential for development
of a fourth production zone on Block 17, for which preliminary
design is under way (see map, OGJ, Mar. 18, 2002, p. 53).
The production zone is in the northwestern area of the block
and will complete the Girassol and Dalia zones, soon to be followed by the Pazflor production zone.
Total E&P is operator with a 40% interest in the block.

Lundin Petroleum to delay Caspian drilling
Lundin Petroleum AB delayed drilling the Morskoye prospect on
the Lagansky block off Russia in the Caspian Sea until next year.
A two-well drilling program is scheduled to start during second
quarter 2007, targeting three main Cretaceous and Jurassic reservoirs at 800-1,600 m.
Earlier this year, Lundin of Stockholm bought Valkyries Petroleum Corp., a company with exploration and producing interests
in Russia and a 70% stake in Lagansky block.
Valkyries planned to spud the Morskoye well in the third quarter, but drilling was delayed pending conversion of shallow draft
barges to drill in 2 m of water.

The 360,000-dwt FPSO, named after the fields, is 310 m long,
58 m wide, and 32 m high.
Built by Hyundai Heavy Industries, the Greater Plutonio vessel
has a storage capacity of 2 million bbl of crude oil and can handle
production of about 200,000 b/d. Its living quarters can accommodate 120 crew members.

Toreador to start gas production off Turkey
With gas production scheduled to begin in late December, Toreador Resources Corp., Dallas, has entered the final stages of construction of the South Akcakoca subbasin project in the Black Sea

the week of Oct. 23 when the Regina pipelay barge is expected to
arrive on location.
Most of the coated pipe has been delivered to Toreador‚Äôs offshore logistics base in Eregli, and the final shipment of pipe is in
transit from Italy, Stratic said. Completion of the offshore pipeline
is expected in mid-December.
Meanwhile, the Prometheus jack up is completing operations
on the Akkaya production tripod and has completed and tied back
the three Akkaya production wells. The rig is preparing to move
to the Dogu Ayazli location to install the second production tripod.
The Dogu Ayazli tripod will be floated into the field area in
preparation for installation over the coming weeks. Following tripod installation and completion and tieback of the Dogu Ayazli-1
and Dogu Ayazli-2 production wells, the rig will then be moved to
the Ayazli location to set the third tripod and tie back the two Ayazli
production wells.
Drilling of the Dogu Ayazli-3 development well to a target on
the eastern flank of the Dogu Ayazli accumulation has been delayed
due to the tight schedule. In fact, the project partners are considering drilling the well after Dogu Ayazli field is on stream.
Stratic said the production platforms will be commissioned in
stages, starting with the Akkaya and Dogu Ayazli platforms in December and followed by the Ayazli platform in January 2007. ‚ú¶

Irving looks into second St. John reÔ¨Ånery

BP‚Äôs Texas City reÔ¨Ånery due steam generator

Irving Oil Ltd., St. John, NB, confirmed that it is exploring the
possibility of building a second refinery at St. John.
The project would be the first major refinery built in North
America in nearly a quarter century and would be the largest private-sector investment in Atlantic Canada.
The new refinery could supply as much as 300,000 b/d of products to the US Northeast and would cost $5-7 billion to build.
Irving said it is conducting market, feasibility, environmental,
and socioeconomic studies, including a site selection determination for a possible refinery.
Irving will continue to invest in its existing, 250,000-b/d refinery at St. John. That refinery, which is Canada‚Äôs largest, supplies
more than 75% of Canada‚Äôs gasoline exports to the US and 19% of
all US gasoline imports.

BP PLC plans to build a 250 Mw steam turbine power generating plant next to the existing South Houston Green Power LP cogeneration facility at BP‚Äôs 446,500 b/cd Texas City, Tex., refinery.
The $100 million unit will boost total electric power generating
capacity at the site to 1,000 Mw. Power not required for refining
operations will be sold into the local markets, BP said.
BP‚Äôs Alternative Energy business will oversee the design, construction, installation, commissioning, and start-up of the new
steam generator plant, which is expected to come on stream in
second quarter 2008.

tion plants for Ethanex Energy Inc., a renewable energy company
engaged in low-cost ethanol production.
The agreement calls for Chevron Energy Solutions (CES) to perform engineering, geotechnical studies, and site and civil design
work to prepare a detailed proposal for developing and building
ethanol plants that use advanced technology to maximize efficiency.
The proposal will include authorization for CES to negotiate
contracts to engineer, procure, and build the biofuel plants by
2008.
The plants, which are to be built in Missouri, Illinois, and Kansas, will each produce about 132 million gal/year of fuel-grade
ethanol. Currently, the total production capacity of ethanol facilities in the US is about 5 billion gal/year, Chevron said.

QP, ExxonMobil to build petrochemical complex
Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil Chemical Qatar Ltd. have
signed a heads of agreement to progress studies for a proposed $3
billion world-scale petrochemical complex in Ras Laffan Industrial
City, Qatar.
The complex will include a 1.3 million tonne/year steam cracker and associated derivative units, including polyethylene and ethylene glycol, which will employ ExxonMobil‚Äôs proprietary steam
cracking furnace and polyethylene technologies.
The facility will utilize feedstock from gas development projects
in Qatar‚Äôs North field and will serve Asia and Europe.
Start-up of the facility is expected in 2012. ‚ú¶

Dominion, Statoil start Cove Point LNG expansion
Dominion Cove Point LNG LP and Statoil ASA began construction Oct. 5 on facilities to almost double the capacity of Dominion
Cove Point LNG terminal in southern Maryland. Capacity is being
increased to 1.8 bcfd of gas from 1 bcfd and storage capacity to
14.6 bcf from 7.8 bcf. The terminal is at Lusby on Chesapeake Bay
south of Baltimore.
Dominion will add two storage tanks to the five existing tanks,
additional vaporizers at the plant, and two electric generator units
to the existing three units.
The project also includes expanding the Dominion Transmission Inc. gas pipeline delivery system. Dominion would build a
47.8-mile, 36-in. pipeline duplicating the existing 36-in. line from
Cove Point to Marshall Hall Gate in Calvert, Prince George‚Äôs, and
Charles counties, Md., to deliver more gas to interstate pipeline
connections in Virginia.
It also will add storage capacity in Pennsylvania along with two
compressor stations, a pipeline in Greene County, Pa., two sections
of pipeline in Potter County, and an 81-mile, 24-in. transmission
line from its Perulack compressor station in Juniata County to Dominion‚Äôs South Point market hub, other interstate pipelines, and
major gas storage fields at Leidy in Clinton County, Pa. Leidy is a
major storage center for gas used in the US Northeast.
Dominion and a subsidiary of Statoil this summer signed 20year service agreements for the plant expansion and increased
pipeline capacity in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Statoil will provide 100% of the LNG for Cove Point. The service agreements will
begin when the expansion is activated, Dominion said. Work is
scheduled for completion in fall 2008.

SNG to build pipeline, expand LNG terminal
Two subsidiaries of Southern Natural Gas Co. (SNG) have filed
separate applications with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to build a pipeline and to expand an LNG receiving terminal near Savannah, Ga., reported El Paso Corp., Houston, SNG‚Äôs
parent company.
The proposed Elba Express Pipeline, to be built by Elba Express
Co. LLC (EEC), will have a total capacity of 1.2 bcfd of gas. The
190-mile 36-42-in. pipeline will transport gas from EEC‚Äôs Elba Is10

land LNG terminal to Georgia and South Carolina, and to the US
Southeast and Northeast via its interconnects. The Elba Island LNG
receiving terminal expansion, planned by Southern LNG, will add
8.4 bcf of LNG storage capacity, which will more than double to
15.7 bcf. This expansion project will increase sendout capacity to
2.1 bcfd, representing an addition of about 0.9 bcfd.
The projects will be constructed in phases with the in-service
date of the first phase of each scheduled for 2010 and the second
phase of each expected to be in 2012. The estimated cost for all
phases of both projects is $930 million.

Cochin to convert oil terminal to LNG use
Cochin Port Trust (CPT), the Indian government department
that manages the port of Kochi, reported plans to convert the existing oil terminal into a receiving terminal for LNG.
According to CPT Chairman N. Ramachandran, Indian Oil Corp.
(IOC) has approached CPT with a proposal to provide an exclusive
terminal to handle imported LNG.
‚ÄúWe have already had three rounds of discussions with IOC and
will soon finalize the proposal,‚Äù Ramachandran said.
‚ÄúThere is some urgency in converting the oil terminal to LNG,
since the Single Point Mooring project of Bharat Petroleum Corp.
Ltd. (BPCL) at Puthuvypeen (near Kochi) will be commissioned
by next year.‚Äù
After the commissioning of the SPM project, CPT‚Äôs oil terminal
would become superfluous. BPCL would no longer use it, and the
port would lose almost 40% of its total earned revenues.
Converting the terminal to handle LNG, with or without a regasification facility, would bring CPT substantial revenues, because
Petronet LNG‚Äôs Kochi terminal is still on the drawing-board and
will require at least 2 years more to become operational.
‚ÄúIOC could take imported bulk LNG from the port to its bottling unit at Irimpanam, from which it can be redistributed,‚Äù said
Ramachandran. Currently, the company is importing LNG through
New Mangalore port for distribution in the four southern states.
CPT also is exploring the possibility of optimum utilization
of the land available on Willingdon Island, where the port is located. Unlike other ports, land shortage is a major concern with
Cochin. ‚ú¶

‚ÄúResearchers mapped areas where

hydrate stability zone that would lead

said. ‚ÄúThe next drilling program would
test that model.‚Äù
The US Minerals Management
Service is conducting a study using
a stochastic, or probability-based,
methodology to estimate the in-place
and technically recoverable gas hydrate
energy resource potential for the Outer
Continental Shelf (Gulf of Mexico,
Pacific, Atlantic, and Alaska).
Preliminary results and the methodology will be released around yearend
or early next year, said Pulak K. Ray,
MMS Resource Evaluation Division
chief geologist.

Alaska
Alaska‚Äôs North Slope is another proven exploration target for gas hydrates.
BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. and the
DOE are working jointly to characterize
North Slope hydrate resource potential
within existing industry infrastructure.
The study, in which USGS is a participant, is assessing the commercial
viability of gas hydrates in the Milne
Point area of northern Alaska.
BP had planned a stratigraphic test
for earlier this year in the Eileen gas
hydrate trend, but rig delays led to the
well‚Äôs deferral. The drilling and test
program is expected to take 20-25 days
and tentatively is scheduled for early
2007.
Both Collett and Johnson suggest
that potential US production of gas
from hydrates is likely to start in Alaska.
Meanwhile, the timing for commercial production of gas from hydrates
remains uncertain.
Johnson believes it‚Äôs conceivable that
commercial production could begin,
at least on a limited basis, within 5
years. ‚ú¶

A dot-com energy vision
During the easy-come, easy-go dot-com craze
of the 1990s, talk abounded of a new economy. It
was an economy in which cash ‚Äúburn rates‚Äù mattered more than profitability, in which information worked as currency, in which physical assets
counted for little. People made a lot of money at
the dawn of this new economy. They lost it when
reality struck.
Like the ill-fated new economy, a new energy
vision has taken wispy form in the popular US
imagination. It‚Äôs a vision quivering with hope for
energy independence, renewable supply, and no
environmental consequence. It‚Äôs a vision that can
make a Republican president talk like a Democrat.

Vision vs. choice
The new energy vision clashes with fuel choice
by the market, which has had a good run in
the US. After price controls and manipulations
imposed by the National Energy Act of 1978
gave way to reality, oil and gas prices vacillated
for a quarter of a century in a range that, usually,
encouraged production and allowed consumption
to grow. Excursions outside this range of comfort
never lasted long. Oil and gas attracted little attention except to the extent their production and
use affected the environment. Energy consumers
enjoyed ample supply and low prices.
Because prices recently have risen in an evident
market correction, however, politicians from both
major political parties now want to nationalize
fuel choice. The abrupt change of political mood
threatens to generate endless policy mischief. It
was on display Oct. 12 in a speech by President
George W. Bush at a renewable-energy conference
in St. Louis.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre too dependent on oil,‚Äù he declared in
a reprise of the ‚Äúaddicted to oil‚Äù theme from his
2006 state-of-the-union address. The statement
raises important questions. How dependent is ‚Äútoo
dependent?‚Äù What‚Äôs the basis for this judgment?
Where, in fact, does the Constitution give the
president responsibility for assessing oil dependency?
These questions could be ignored if Bush‚Äôs assertion of a national problem didn‚Äôt lead him into
potentially expensive ideological territory. Has
the president forgotten that government energy

prescriptions usually cost too much and seldom
work?
In the president‚Äôs view, the problem isn‚Äôt only
that the US is ‚Äútoo dependent on oil,‚Äù whatever
that means. There‚Äôs also national security, Bush reminded his audience in St. Louis. ‚ÄúWe get oil from
some countries who don‚Äôt particularly care for
us.‚Äù And this is relevant to‚Äîexactly what? Mutual
adoration has never before been a precondition of
commerce. Why make it one now? In fact, business can stabilize international relations when
governments don‚Äôt use it as a cudgel. Reciprocal
economic needs deserve more attention than they
receive as influences on national behavior and factors in the security of energy supply.
‚ÄúThis country has got to use its talent and its
wealth to get us off oil,‚Äù Bush insisted with no
mention of how much this ambition might cost
energy consumers. Then he went on to boast about
money he‚Äôs committing the government to spend
on hybrid vehicles, battery technology, hydrogen
as a vehicle fuel, and, of course, renewable energy.
He further asserted the need for the government
to change American behavior. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got some
interesting initiatives at the federal level to help
change habits,‚Äù he promised. What‚Äôs most interesting, in fact, is the confusion evident in a Republican president who feels compelled to manipulate
individual behavior.

Which party?
To his credit, Bush did speak of the need to
increase domestic production of oil, gas, nuclear
power, and coal‚Äîenergy sources with much
greater supply potential and much less need for
subsidies from taxpayers than the less traditional
fuels on his wish list. All in all, though, he sounded on energy, less than a month before a pivotal
national election, like a Democrat. No wonder
Republicans are worried.
That this can happen is important beyond political outcomes. A market adjustment is no reason
to usurp economics. It‚Äôs no reason to throw public
money at uncompetitive energy forms. It‚Äôs no
reason to adopt the energy equivalent of dot-com
economic fantasies. And it‚Äôs no reason to limit
freedom of economic choice. ‚ú¶

POINT

OF

VIEW

Guma Aguiar, vice-chairman and
chief executive officer of private Houston independent Leor Energy LP, took
an interesting and unusual route to
finally work in the oil and gas industry.
Unlike many executives in the
exploration and production business,
Aguiar didn‚Äôt start with a background
in oil and
gas. Instead,
he worked
first in 1999
as a clerk
on the floor
of the New
York Mercantile Exchange with a focus on energy
markets, especially gas, then dabbled in
trading.
Aguiar later joined his uncle, Thomas
Kaplan, to manage family investments
ranging from venture capital to private
equity and debt. It was during this time

that he became responsible for creating
a US company focused on aggressive oil
and gas exploration.
‚ÄúI made an investment in an oil and
gas start-up company with my uncle.
We had some fairly good success early
on and decided that this was something
that we would like to do,‚Äù Aguiar told
OGJ.
After forming a partnership with his
uncle in 2003, Aguiar moved to Houston to start looking for other deals.
20

‚ÄúThis is one of those ‚Äòold schooltype‚Äô success stories,‚Äù Aguiar says. ‚ÄúI
had a little bit of money that I‚Äôd saved,
and [Kaplan] put some money up
as well. We started looking for some
properties in North Louisiana and East
Texas.‚Äù

Growing from concept
A breakthrough came when Aguiar
met a geologist in his 70s who had a
concept for a gas play with very little
data to support it. The geologist was
John Amoruso, and the play was what
later would be called Amoruso gas field
in Robertson County, Tex., in the Deep
Bossier trend.
Until that point in 2003, Aguiar says,
‚ÄúFew companies had drilled any Deep
Bossier wells, and I do not think any
company had had any success.‚Äù
Aguiar recalls Amoruso‚Äôs concept as
it was drawn on a chalkboard in front
of him: ‚Äú[Amoruso] had
this concept that the gas
was coming off the shelf
edge, and it formed thick
sand packages.‚Äù
Encouraged by the
geologist‚Äôs ideas, Aguiar
led Leor through a period
of heavy acquisition. Leor
continued acquiring acreage in the Deep Bossier
play for 6 months when
the former Burlington
Resources Inc. (now part
of ConocoPhillips) was
gaining success in the
region.
By the time Burlington drilled its
first Deep Bossier well, Leor held the
lion‚Äôs share of the trend‚Äôs acreage. Aguiar credits companies like Burlington
for calling industry attention to the play.
‚ÄúAt that point, they were basically our
best promoter,‚Äù he says.

Chance for success
Leor tried to ensure that it dominated the fledgling play. This month marks
a year since Leor drilled its first well in

‚ÄúI made an investment
in an oil and gas start-up

success early on and decided that this was something that we would like to
do.‚Äù

the area. Since that time, the company
has been able to ramp up production
from 6 MMcfd of gas to about 100
MMcfd. ‚ÄúFor onshore North America,
that‚Äôs unheard of,‚Äù Aguiar says.
In July 2005, Leor cut a fateful deal
with the US subsidiary of EnCana Corp.
of Calgary to jointly explore and develop its Robertson County acreage.
Then in January, Goldman Sachs
Principal Strategies Group led a $45
million equity investment giving the
participating investors a minority interest in Leor.
And in June, Leor sold 7,400 net
acres in its Amoruso field acreage to
EnCana for $242.9 million in cash and
4,039 net acres adjacent to its Amoruso
leasehold. Leor now holds interests in
about 50,000 gross acres in Robertson
County and 150,000 gross acres in the
Deep Bossier trend.

Aguiar says of the deal‚Äôs beginnings:
‚ÄúEnCana has done an excellent job of
operating these wells, which are very,
very complex: high-temperature, highpressure, and deep. It‚Äôs one of those
things where we thought they would be
the best in the business.‚Äù
This deal was important to Aguiar, he
says, because entering into this sort of
transaction gave Leor access to EnCana‚Äôs
vast experience and expertise in drilling
and completing the unconventional gas
wells, which was important because the
Deep Bossier wells Leor and EnCana are
drilling at Amoruso field are ‚Äúdifferent from conventional Bossier wells,
and much different from Barnett shale
wells,‚Äù for example.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know when you‚Äôre going
to see a kick because there‚Äôs so many
different sand packages,‚Äù he says.
Working with EnCana, Aguiar has access to skills of former Tom Brown Inc.
and Matador Resource Co. workers with
experience drilling for unconventional
gas.

High exposure
Leor and EnCana Oil & Gas (USA)
Inc. expect to have drilled 22 wells in
Amoruso gas field by yearend (OGJ

Online, July 28, 2006).
Currently, says Aguiar, the joint field
owners have five rigs working in the
Deep Bossier trend and expect two
more to arrive in the next 45 days. Aguiar said, ‚ÄúIf we continue to have success
like we are having, I think it may be
appropriate to add even more rigs in
2007.‚Äù
Aguiar says that in a $10-12/MMbtu
gas environment, he would like to have
more rigs working the area. Even with
gas prices in the $5-6/MMbtu range,
however, he thinks Leor‚Äôs high-risk,
high-cost operations are economic.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pretty exposed to gas prices,‚Äù
Aguiar says. ‚ÄúWith our history and the
fact that we brought production on so
fast, we‚Äôre really not in a position to
hedge.‚Äù
In the short to medium term, Aguiar
plans to raise more equity and possibly
bring more partners on board. Currently he and his uncle control most of
the company but would consider taking
the company public in 2007-08.
‚ÄúTechnically and operationally, we‚Äôre
extremely sound,‚Äù Aguiar says. ‚ÄúThe
guys that I brought on to work for me
here are masters of their trade. We had
the benefit of really selecting the best

Career highlights
Guma L. Aguiar, cofounder of Leor Energy, has served as vice-chairman and chief
executive ofÔ¨Åcer since the company‚Äôs inception.
Employment
Aguiar began his career as a clerk on the Ô¨Çoor of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Aguiar joined his uncle, Thomas Kaplan, to manage family investments in 2001. During
this time he was given responsibility for creating a US company focused on oil and gas
exploration. After assembling a lease position in Louisiana and Texas ranging from unconventional natural gas to shallow oil, in 2003 Aguiar identiÔ¨Åed and executed the company‚Äôs
acquisition of its Ô¨Çagship property in the Deep Bossier trend of East Texas.
Education
Aguiar attended Clemson University, where he studied business administration.
AfÔ¨Åliations
Aguiar is chairman of the Lillian Jean Kaplan Foundation and is involved in numerous
philanthropic activities.

The company‚Äôs chief financial officer,
as an example, was a Solomon Smith
Barney banker for 17 years. Everyone
on our management team, says Aguiar,
himself just 29 years old, has 25 or
more years of oil and gas experience.
In the Deep Bossier play, Aguiar says,
things can only get better. ‚ÄúOver the
course of time, as we drill more wells
and better understand what‚Äôs going

on there, we will be able to cut costs
and bring our wells on line with better
economics.‚Äù

In the family
Aguiar appreciates the experience
of working with his uncle. ‚ÄúIn today‚Äôs
world you just don‚Äôt see too often two
family members being able to partner
up and be so successful and have such
a great relationship and make a lot of

money along the way,‚Äù he says.
‚ÄúOne thing that people have noticed
about Tom and I is that we‚Äôre sort of like
throwbacks to the old days‚Äîwe do a
lot of deals on handshakes.‚Äù
Aguiar says the family feeling extends to employees. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt come to
work for the company; you come and
join the family. It‚Äôs not just the money
for us. It‚Äôs thinking about people and
caring about them.‚Äù ‚ú¶

with an integrated Tier-1 ‚ÄúERP‚Äù like
SAP? Not necessarily.
The issues boil down to a misuse of
the existing systems and lack of training. Examples of real issues include:
differing property hierarchies between
systems, misuse of freeform or predefined data fields, missing data, and
inaccurate meter grids. As a result,
virtually all organizations turn to
spreadsheets to manually manipulate
data for performance and management
reporting. Spreadsheets are prone to
errors‚Äîstudies have found that 90% of
spreadsheets with more than 150 lines
contain errors. It is doubtful any company wants to manage their business on
information with such an error rate.
Although many of the information
issues stem from process issues, the
information issues first require data
cleanup, followed by ongoing process
improvement. The data issues are at the
crux of why external spreadsheets are
used for daily production reports, capital tracking summaries, and financial
statements. Addressing the data issues
requires a focused data cleanup effort,
as well as cross-functional data definition teams to define how certain data
elements will be used for reporting
purposes. Addressing the data issues requires cross-division commitment and
buy-in just as the process changes do.
Another part of the process improvement effort is changing processes to
avoid future data cleanup efforts. For
example, when new wells are brought
online, a process for synchronizing the
update of accounting, economic, and
production well information needs to
be defined. Improving the process not
only improves the time in which data
and information is obtained, but also
increases the accuracy and value of the
data created.
‚Ä¢ Delivery. Unfortunately, most organizations are quick to jump first to
the delivery or software solution (e.g.,
business intelligence, data warehouse,
etc.). Invariably, taking this route results
in failure because the projects never
seem to end. Key information is not
captured or reported, and executives get

frustrated because they‚Äôve spent millions of dollars on a ‚Äúwhiz-bang‚Äù tool
but are not getting any more information than they had before the tool was
implemented.
The delivery or software solution
needs to be assessed along with the
process, organization, and information dimensions. Implementing the
delivery or software mechanism alone
will result in a software tool nobody
uses. The delivery mechanism needs to
answer the following questions: What
technologies are we going to use to
deliver information to the divisions,
corporate, and field organizations? How
is the new software environment going
to be integrated into the flexibility they
have come to expect with the current
spreadsheet environment? How is the
planning process going to be integrated
into the delivery mechanism?
Many companies struggle with information delivery solutions and develop
individual information delivery silos.
For example, the production divisions
use one software database and application to report and deliver production
information, while the accounting
division uses another database and application to report financial information
and another department uses a separate
database for reporting capital project
data. Consequently, the organizations
cannot easily attain an integrated view
of their organization.
Implementing an integrated information delivery mechanism in the
most efficient and effective manner
requires the organization to develop a
data environment to integrate capital,
production, financial, and budgeting
data into a single view of the business.
The conceptual information delivery
architecture in the figure depicts a
high-level view of how the information delivery mechanism relates to the
current application and examples of
what information might be generated.
In an integrated information delivery
environment, the company can view
the latest daily production trends integrated with production revenues, lease
operating expense components, and

capital spending together. The integrated information delivery environment
would allow the company to obtain a
single view into the performance of
the organization as a whole and how
its individual parts drive performance
results.

Conclusion
Improving an E&P firm‚Äôs ability to

Bush: More US E&P vital in alternative fuel transition
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Falling gasoline prices must not
dissuade Americans from developing
alternative fuels or finding more domestic oil and gas, US President George
W. Bush said on Oct. 12.
Addressing a renewable energy conference cosponsored by the US Departments of Agriculture and Energy in St.
Louis, Bush reiterated earlier statements
that the US should move away from
petroleum for its motor fuels to protect
its economy, national security, and
environment.
‚ÄúAs you can tell, I‚Äôm excited about
new technologies. But I think we‚Äôve got
to be realistic about the timing. And in
order to become less dependent on foreign sources of oil, we‚Äôve got to explore
for oil and gas in our own hemisphere
in environmentally friendly ways. And
one of the interesting technological
developments is the capacity to find oil
in unique places,‚Äù he said.
Referring to the recent Jack 2 discovery made by Chevron Corp. and its partners in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico,
Bush said it was accomplished with
new technologies, ‚Äúwhich enable us to
go to new places, and they enable us to
be wise stewards of the environment.‚Äù

Bush said, ‚ÄúI understand there‚Äôs a big
debate about whether or not you can
explore for oil and gas and protect the
environment. I believe you can. And I
understand that as we transition to the
ethanol era...or the hydrogen area, we
must also find oil and gas in our own
hemisphere if the objective is to become less dependent on foreign oil.‚Äù
Bush said the 2005 Energy Policy
Act was a good beginning but added
that the House and Senate now need to
resolve differences in their competing
federal offshore leasing bills.

States should share
Bush said the House and Senate need
to come together between their respective leasing bills to encourage exploration in new areas of the gulf. ‚ÄúAnd I
believe that states ought to share in the
royalties because I know, in the state
of Louisiana, for example, they have
committed their share of new royalties
in this new exploration to help protect
their coastline,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúAnd I believe Congress needs to get
the bill to my desk as quick as possible.
So when you finish the elections, get
back and let me sign this bill so the
American people know that we‚Äôre serious about getting off foreign oil,‚Äù Bush
continued.
He said expanding domestic off-

shore exploration and production is
vital because of growing US natural gas
demand, not only for home heating
and industrial fuels but also to generate electricity. He also said more LNG
terminals need to be developed and
approved so the US can begin to use gas
from overseas.
‚ÄúAn increased supply of natural
gas...makes it more likely that you‚Äôre
going to have rational bills, more likely
the economy will continue to grow.
And natural gas protects the environment,‚Äù Bush said.
Developing new coal and nuclear
technologies alongside hydrogen
and ethanol alternatives are part of ‚Äúa
comprehensive approach to solving a
national issue, which is dependence on
oil, and how best to protect this environment,‚Äù Bush said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to get
rid of the old, stale debates on the environment and recognize new technologies are going to enable us to achieve a
lot of objectives at the same time.‚Äù
At the conference, Sec. of Agriculture
Mike Johanns and Sec. of Energy Samuel
W. Bodman jointly announced $17.5
million in federal grants for 17 biomass
research, development, and demonstration projects. ‚ÄúThis funding will spur
new scientific innovation that will help
us kick our overreliance on oil,‚Äù Bodman said. ‚ú¶

API: US reÔ¨Åners spent $8 billion to provide ULSD
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
US refiners spent $8 billion, and
pipelines and terminal operators spent
hundreds of millions more to bring ultralow-sulfur diesel (ULSD) to market,
an official of the American Petroleum
Institute said at the group‚Äôs annual
meeting in Washington, DC.
As of Oct. 15, the sulfur content of
28

80% of highway diesel sold in the US
could not exceed 15 ppm, compared
with 500 ppm previously. All but the
smallest refiners had to start making ULSD in June. Some of them are
processing to well below the specified
level to offset contamination by residual
sulfur in distribution systems.
Alfonse Mannato, fuels issues manager in API‚Äôs downstream department,

reported the spending estimates and
said, ‚ÄúWe were nervous about the rollout of this program. It‚Äôs going smoothly.
We haven‚Äôt seen problems in supplies or
vehicle performance.‚Äù
He and John Felmy, API chief economist, said availability of the new product exceeds 80% of highway diesel.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not out of the woods yet. But
we haven‚Äôt heard of any major problems,‚Äù Felmy said.

At API‚Äôs meeting, US Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator Stephen L. Johnson called the transition to
ULSD ‚Äúthe single biggest achievement
since the removal of lead from gasoline
25 years ago.‚Äù
California‚Äôs deadline for availability of ULSD was Sept. 1, but EPA gave
the industry outside that state an extra
45 days to address contamination and
other potential transportation problems.

EPA set the availability deadline for
the new fuel to accommodate exhausttreatment systems on diesel engines
starting with the 2007 model year.
‚ÄúRight now, our diesel fuel is the
cleanest in the world. Europe has a
10 ppm diesel, but it‚Äôs not across the
board. Much of what is sold there is still
50 ppm,‚Äù Mannato said.
Current diesel engines will run
cleaner on ULSD, but the emissions
reduction won‚Äôt be as dramatic as when

continued. Inadvertently mixing ULSD
with low-sulfur diesel in vehicles‚Äô fuel
tanks could clog fuel filters, so truckers
and other operators have been alerted
to report problems, he said. Additives at
terminals will compensate for lubricity
losses caused by sulfur removal.
Mannato said the transition to ULSD
may have been more dramatic than the
move to unleaded gasoline because the
latter was accomplished over several
years; ULSD came to the market within
a few months.
Felmy said, ‚ÄúI was a little concerned
in late May when the production figures
for ULSD had not grown very much.
Then they started to climb during June,
and I felt better.‚Äù ‚ú¶

agricultural feedstocks as ethanol.
Schubert outlined some of the benefits of the biofuel:
‚Ä¢ It can be blended with gasoline at
the refinery due to its low vapor pressure.
‚Ä¢ It can use existing fuel infrastructure without the need for major
modifications.
‚Ä¢ It has the potential to be used at
higher blend concentrations than ethanol in unmodified vehicles.
‚Ä¢ It is less susceptible to separation
in water than ethanol-gasoline blends.
According to a BP statement, BP
and Dupont are assessing biobutanol‚Äôs
greenhouse gas emissions performance.
‚ÄúInitial indications are that, on the same
feedstock basis, biobutanol delivers
emissions reductions that are at least as
good as ethanol,‚Äù it said.
BP reported plans to introduce
biobutanol as a gasoline biocomponent
in the UK in 2007. That report stated
that the company is working with Associated British Foods PLC subsidiary
British Sugar to convert the country‚Äôs
first ethanol fermentation facility to
produce biobuthanol. ‚ú¶

tion of the E85 pumps within that time
is possible, but they would have to be
set up at the largest service stations first
because installation costs per station
would be ‚Ç¨20,000-40,000.
Commenting on Breton‚Äôs announcement that government tax breaks
would bring down the cost of E85 to
80¬¢ (Euro)‚Äîfar lower than the current unleaded‚ÄîSchilansky said that if
this were really the case, it could very
quickly become the anticipated alternative, providing the tax breaks would be
perennial.
Regarding the problem of the refining industry‚Äôs producing too much
gasoline, ‚Äúwe will produce the same
amount but export more of it,‚Äù Schilansky said.

E85 vs. diesel
Substituting E85 for diesel, on
which half the vehicles in France are
now running, would be more difficult,
he says. Diesel oil is cheaper in France
because of lower taxation. Nonetheless,
if oil prices shoot up, it could happen
that E85 might prove competitive with
diesel oil in time. In any case, the tax
breaks cannot be squeezed below the
lowest level allowed by the European
directives.
Schilansky did not think E85 was
likely to be developed in the rest of
the EU. ‚ÄúFrance is the largest agricultural country in Europe and the second
worldwide after the US, he pointed
out. ‚ÄúShe has the acreage to produce
the crops to meet the needed ethanol
demand beyond 2010.‚Äù France also has
a number of ethanol production plants
either already on stream or about to be
built, he added.
Breton pointed out other advantages:
the ethanol line would give a needed
boost to France‚Äôs farmers‚Äîan argument
also advanced by Agriculture Minister Dominique Bussereau‚Äîbiofuels
development would benefit the environment by ‚Äústrongly‚Äù reducing carbon
dioxide emissions from transport, and
E85 would reduce France‚Äôs oil imports,
improving the ‚Äúglobal balance with oilproducing countries.‚Äù ‚ú¶

Japan employs
energy choice

E

ven in a world where energy
sources are tight, there is still
enough oil and gas in the ground to
guarantee choices. Consider the efforts of resource-poor Japan to secure
itself a stable energy supply.
To win support for its nuclear
ambitions, Iran has threatened Japan
with the oil weapon on a number of
occasions, perhaps most obviously by
threatening‚Äîand eventually reducing‚Äîits 75% stake in development of
giant Azadegan oil field.
No less worrying for Japan, the
Russian government has halted the
Sakhalin-2 project, claiming that the
companies involved‚ÄîRoyal Dutch
Shell along with Japanese partners
Mitsui and Mitsubishi‚Äîhave ignored
environmental regulations and caused
$10-50 billion in damage.

The market prevails
But the market appears to have
prevailed as Japan has turned to Indonesia and Australia to fill a substantial
portion of its future energy needs.
Indeed, Japan‚Äôs Inpex Holdings
Inc., which had the Azadegan stake,
now plans to invest about ¬•500
billion ($4.22 billion) to launch
natural gas production in Indonesia
by 2015. The Japanese energy developer, which has a 100% stake in
the project, aims to ship 3-5 million
tonnes/year of LNG to Japan and
elsewhere.
Inpex has a similar project under
way in an Australian field, where it
holds a 76% stake. There the firm is
spending ¬•700 billion, with plans
to produce 6 million tonnes/year of
LNG starting in 2012.
In fact, these two fields alone
could jointly supply 15-20% of

Japan‚Äôs LNG needs. In terms of percentage of energy needs, that 15-20%
represents more than Japan imports
from Iran now.
Inpex reportedly has found a gas
deposit capable of supporting 3 million tonnes/year of LNG in Indonesia, where it will start drilling at four
locations beginning early next year to
confirm the reserves.
The next step will be to submit a
production plan to the Indonesian
government in 2008 for approval. According to one observer, negotiations
with the Indonesian government
hold the key to realizing gas production there. But unlike with Iran or
Russia, the risk of falling victim to
resource nationalism is low in the
Indonesian project.

Conversion plans
Inpex is said to be developing
plans to construct a facility near the
city of Darwin in northern Australia
for liquefying the Indonesian gas.
The LNG will be shipped to markets
in Japan and elsewhere. Undersea
pipelines will transport the gas from
Indonesia to Darwin.
Last August, Kon Vatskalis, minister
for mines and energy in Australia‚Äôs
Northern Territory, said Inpex is likely
to reach an accord with Indonesia
and Australia for processing gas from
its Abadi field in Darwin.
At the time, Vatskalis said ConocoPhillips may already be designing
an expansion of its 3.24 million
tonne/year Darwin LNG plant, which
currently liquefies gas from Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea.
One way or another, it‚Äôs a world of
choice. ‚ú¶

London inauguration marks Langeled start-up
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
The Langeled pipeline consortium
and the British and Norwegian prime
ministers on Oct. 16 inaugurated the
600-km southern leg of 1,200-km
Langeled pipeline, which has begun
exporting gas from the Sleipner hub in
the Norwegian North Sea to Easington
on the UK‚Äôs east coast (OGJ, Oct. 9,
2006, Newsletter).
Statoil ASA designed and laid the
44-in. diameter southern segment on
behalf of Norsk Hydro ASA, operator
of the Langeled development phase,
which was completed 3 billion kroner
($444.1 million) below budget. Anne
Lycke, Hydro‚Äôs Langeled asset manager,
told OGJ that the company secured
steel supply contracts before steel prices
jumped.
When complete, the Langeled
pipeline will carry gas from Nyhamna
on Norway‚Äôs west coast through the
Sleipner riser platform and on to Easington, becoming the world‚Äôs longest
subsea export pipeline. Nyhamna is the
site of separation and treatment facilities for production from Ormen Lange

gas-condensate field in the Norwegian
Sea.
Flow from Nyhamna to Sleipner
through Langeled‚Äôs 42-in. diameter
northern section is to begin when
Ormen Lange starts production next
October. Construction is about 90%
complete, according to Hydro. Remaining work includes completion of the
Nyhamna gas processing plant; drilling
and completion of the first production
wells; testing of the subsea installations; installation of the last umbilical
between Nyhamna and Ormen Lange
field; and midline tie-in on Langeled.
When Ormen Lange is on stream,
Langeled will deliver 70 million cu m/
day of gas to the UK. The Ormen Lange
reservoir, about 3,000 m below the seabottom in 800-1,100 m of water, will
produce from 24 subsea wells drilled
through four seabed templates.
Hydro said a challenge has been the
uneven seabed, with peaks 30-60 m
high, over Ormen Lange.
‚ÄúThe first two remotely controlled
subsea production stations are located
120 km from shore at a water depth of
850 m, making Ormen Lange one of
the world‚Äôs largest and most advanced

subsea-to-shore developments,‚Äù Hydro
said.
Eivind Reiten, president and chief
executive officer of Hydro, pointed out

Study sees uneven natural gas trade in Europe
The wholesale gas market in Europe
is developing unevenly and too slowly
to suit many traders.
Furthermore, the liberalization that
stimulates gas trade remains subject
to questions about whether it‚Äôs effective and even appropriate, notes a new
research study.
According to European Gas Trading
2006 by Mary Jackson and Nigel Harris,
principal consultants and directors of
Kingston Energy Consulting of London,
the UK and Benelux countries‚ÄîBelgium, the Netherlands, and Luxemburg‚Äîhave Europe‚Äôs only ‚Äútruly liquid
34

trading markets‚Äù for gas.
Although liquidity is limited elsewhere, ‚Äúnascent trading markets‚Äù in
France, Germany, Italy, and Spain are
growing rapidly, the consultants say. The
UK accounts for 74% of total European
gas trading volumes, followed by the
Netherlands, 13%; Belgium, 6%; Spain,
4%, and Italy, Germany, and France, 1%
each. Among the higher-volume countries, market structures vary. The UK
has over-the-counter spot and forward
trading based on the virtual National
Balancing Point, beach terminals, and
the Interconnector pipeline between the

UK and Belgium.
In Belgium, Zeebrugge is a major
physical trading hub. The Interconnector links Zeebrugge prices with the UK
market. The Title Transfer Facility in the
Netherlands is the balancing market
for the Dutch network and serves as a
virtual trading point for the Dutch and
German markets.
In Germany, problems of network
access hamper trading. Italy, France, and
Spain have small but growing markets
based on virtual trading points, bordercrossing locations, and LNG terminals.

ers‚Äîsome of which are formerly stateowned national gas monopolies‚Äîremain the largest traders, Jackson and
Harris observe. But use of the traded
markets remains small in comparison
with volumes bought and sold under
long-term contracts.
The consultants note that the Eu-

ropean Union has faulted members
for slow progress in the liberalization
of gas markets and that the European
Commission is investigating energy
companies for possible violations of
competition rules. ‚ÄúIt is evident that
the implementation of competitive gas
markets is deeply flawed in many EU

member states, but the EC is clearly of
the view that it is the implementation
and not the model that is at fault,‚Äù Jackson and Harris say. ‚ÄúThere are market
participants who would argue that liberalization is the only way forward and
those who argue equally strongly that it
is a road to disaster,‚Äù they say. ‚ú¶

MMS: Gulf of Mexico Ô¨Ånds extend Lower Tertiary Trend
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
Twelve ultradeepwater discoveries in
the Gulf of Mexico extend the Lower
Tertiary Trend and represent a resource
that could produce oil and gas for decades to come, the US Minerals Management Service said on Oct. 10.
‚ÄúThis is an exciting new trend in
the Gulf of Mexico, and the recent announcement by Chevron [Corp.] and
its partners of the results of the Jack 2
well provides additional proof of its
great potential,‚Äù MMS Director Johnnie
Burton said as the Department of the
Interior agency released a summary of
12 announced discoveries in the area.
‚ÄúThis trend began to materialize in
2001 and 2002 with several discoveries in the Alaminos Canyon and Walker
Ridge areas and now has extended
to the Keathley Canyon area. The area
could be as wide as 300 miles and
involve as many as 3,000 blocks that
MMS administers,‚Äù she said.
While the Lower Tertiary Trend has
been a significant petroleum resource
in Texas and southwestern Louisiana
for years, its reserves contribution in
the gulf was negligible until the recent
discoveries, MMS indicated. It said 99%
of the gulf‚Äôs proved reserves were found
in sediments less than 23 million years
of Miocene age (Upper Tertiary) and
younger, while 1% are in older than
65 million years (Jurassic and Cretaceous age) sediment that primarily are
in near-shore areas off Louisiana and
Alabama.
The 12 recent discoveries were in
36

Lower Tertiary formations deposited 2364 million years ago in 15,000-30,000
ft of water, MMS said.
Officials also noted that the widespread industry interest in the Jack
well test and the discovery by BP on its
Kaskida prospect in 5,860 ft of water preceded heavy bidding activity at

MMS‚Äôs Western Gulf Sale 200 in August.
At that sale, they said, 82 tracts received bids in the Keathley Canyon area.
BP offered the sale‚Äôs highest bid of $21
million for Block 58 in Keathley Canyon, while Petrobras bid $12.8 million
for Block 59, and Shell bid $6 million
for Block 56 there. ‚ú¶

Argentina evokes law to force diesel imports
Peter Howard Wertheim
OGJ Correspondent
Argentina has threatened statutory
sanctions against foreign oil companies
if it detects problems in the supply of
products such as diesel.
The administration of President N√©stor Kirchner reactivated a law, enacted
in 1974 during the administration of
former nationalist-populist President
Juan Per√≥n, empowering the government to intervene in commerce and
industry, close establishments, apply
fines, and imprison executives.
The main diesel suppliers in Argentina are Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Repsol
YPF, and a unit of ExxonMobil Corp.
In a press conference, Guillermo
Moreno, domestic commerce secretary, said, ‚ÄúIt is the duty of all public
employees to enforce abidance of the
law.‚Äù He threatened to imprison executives from oil companies that do not
increase diesel imports as specified by
the government.
Diesel prices are frozen in Argentina
at levels below international prices. The

government insists that companies can
compensate for losses on diesel imports
with revenues from exports of other
products.
Members of Moreno‚Äôs staff have told
the powerful farmers‚Äô organization Soc.
Rural Argentina (SRA) that oil companies had failed to import diesel levels
demanded by the government to alleviate a shortage plaguing agriculture.
Hundreds of SRA members recently
blocked roads linking Ros√°rio with
Buenos Aires, C√≥rdoba with Pilar, and
Tucum√°n with Famaill√°.
Kirchner seeks reelection in 2007
and is trying to avoid inflation, which
hobbled Argentina during the 1990s.
In September, Argentina‚Äôs Internal
Commerce Secretariat told the local
Shell unit to stop selling a new diesel
formulation, which costs 10% more
than regular diesel, because the company failed to obtain government approval. Last year, Kirchner called on citizens
to boycott Shell after the local unit
raised pump prices amid rising world
oil prices. Shell dropped prices after
government-aligned protest groups
marched on Shell stations. ‚ú¶

Mauritania‚Äôs Atlantic coastal basin
may be destined to become a source of
liquefied natural gas.
At least one of the participants in the
deepwater exploration play that takes in
the country‚Äôs entire 335-mile coastline
has stated that a minimum of 4 tcf of
recoverable gas is needed to support a
commercial LNG project.
Gaz de France‚Äôs late 2005 agreement
with Dana Petroleum PLC, London,
finalized in recent weeks, gave Gaz de
rance interests in lightly drilled blocks
1, 7, and 8 off Mauritania, at least one
of which contains a major gas discovery, Pelican on Block 7.
At least four of the discovered oil
fields, Chinguetti, Tevet, Tiof, and Banda,
operated by other companies contain
varying volumes of gas (see table).
In mid-2006, Gaz de France said it
was starting a feasibility study of an LNG
project in Mauritania based on deepwater gas discoveries (OGJ Online, July 14,
2006). Because of the barely explored
nature of the country‚Äôs offshore, it is unclear what is the total volume of recoverable gas identified so far. The development time frame is also hazy but appears
to be no earlier than 2012-14.
Meanwhile, the several operators
exploring the area‚Äôs nine blocks plan
to continue wildcatting the area and
appraising the discoveries made so far.
Dana Petroleum operates blocks 1, 7,
and 8; Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Perth,
operates blocks 2 to 6 and has an interest in Block 7; and Al Thani Corp. of
Sudan operates Block 19.
The nine blocks total more than 14.5
million acres.
For one thing, the Gaz de France
agreement calls for the French company
to carry Dana Petroleum‚Äôs interest in the
current three-well program, one well
on each of the blocks in which Gaz de
France acquired interests, up to a maximum of $30 million.
Besides Gaz de France, the major gas
players BG PLC, Malaysia‚Äôs Petronas, and
Wintershall AG also hold interests off
Mauritania.

Chinguetti area gas
Woodside-operated Chinguetti field,
the only discovery on production off
Mauritania, went on production in
February 2006 at 70,000 b/d and was
averaging 30,000 b/d in October, said
participant Roc Oil Co. Ltd., Sydney.
Because of the lagging production
rate, the 123 million bbl reserve estimate is under review and a time-lapse
(4D) seismic survey has
been proposed for 2007.
In 2,625 ft of water 50
miles off Nouakchott, the
field is producing into a
floating production, storage, and offloading vessel
and was originally given
a 10-year life. Capacity of the Chinguetti gas handling/reinjection facilities is
80 MMcfd.
Tiof, 25 km north of Chinguetti, at
60 sq km is about five times Chinguetti

The 2004 Tevet well discovered a

Northern area
The largest single known nonassociated gas deposit is Pelican, which

when discovered in 2003 was a 93-mile
stepout from the oil discoveries in the
Chinguetti area.
Also, Pelican‚Äôs multiple Upper Cretaceous sands are geologically distinct
from the Miocene-aged sandstone
systems that hosted the Chinguetti, Tiof,
Tevet, and Banda discoveries.
After the 2003 Pelican-1 gas discovery near the south line of Block 7, Dana
Petroleum and others recorded 1,540
sq km of 3D seismic data between
Pelican and shore where geochemical
results indicated that oil may have been
displaced to the east, said participant
Hardman Resources Ltd., Perth. Tullow
Oil PLC, London, is acquiring Hardman Resources (OGJ Online, Sept. 26,
2006).
Dana Petroleum plugged the Flamant-1 wildcat on western Block 8 in
September 2006 but expressed encouragement after the well penetrated 1,150
m in the carbonate primary target,
topped at 6,924 ft. It said the shallower
part of the well had gas-bearing intervals, indicating mature hydrocarbon
source rock in the area. TD is 10,742 ft.
The Flamant drillsite is 120 miles
northwest of the Pelican discovery and
about 50 km south of the border with
Western Sahara. Block 8 covers 11,797
sq km. Before drilling, Dana Petroleum
had estimated the Flamant structure size
at more than 6 tcf of gas.
Dana Petroleum spudded Aigrette-1
on Oct. 7, 2006, in 4,526 ft of water
on a Cretaceous gas prospect on Block
7 about 27 miles northwest of and on
trend with Pelican. It is projected to
16,154 ft.

Southern area
A gas discovery in Cretaceous at the
first modern well drilled on Block 1
has implications for exploration to the
south off Senegal.
Dana Petroleum drilled Faucon-1

found 46 ft of net hydrocarbon bearing
Cretaceous sandstone in two intervals
above a further 270 ft of potential sandstone reservoir.

The 200 to 400 bcf the company
surmised to be in place is not enough
for stand-alone development but proves
a working petroleum system. Faucon‚Äôs
Cretaceous sands also demonstrated that
sufficient potential reservoir sand can
be present to accommodate much larger

The findings provided encouragement for other prospects identified on
Block 1, including Petrel.
It also proved encouraging for the St.

seismic survey in 2004 and identified
several prospects.
The Faucon-1 well results led to a
conclusion that it will be beneficial
to gather 3D seismic data on St. Louis
before drilling an exploration well off
Senegal. This survey could start in late
2006 and could be combined with an
incremental survey in the southern part
of Block 1.
The 2006 drilling program off Mauritania began with Colin-1 on Block 3,
which found prime quality Miocene
reservoir B sands but no commercial
hydrocarbons. Hardman Resources said
the sand quality was much better than
at Chinguetti, where the B sands are
known to be gas-bearing.
After drilling Flamant and Aigrette,
the rig is to return to Block 4 to drill
Kibaro-1. Then it will head for infill
drilling at Chinguetti field, after which
it will depart Mauritania and return in
mid-2007. ‚ú¶

Northern Somalia exploration effort planned
Canmex Minerals Corp., Vancouver,
BC, signed a nonbinding agreement to
take a farmout from Range Resources
Ltd., Perth, on two blocks in the nonproducing Nogal and Al Medo/Darin
basins onshore between the Gulf of
Aden and Indian Ocean in northern
Somalia.
Completion is expected by yearend.
The basins lie across the Gulf of Aden
from Yemen, which had a 23% success
rate and average discovery size of 96
million boe recoverable in 1994-2006,
Range noted. The Somali record is 11
oil and gas discoveries, none producing,
out of 60 wildcats drilled in 580,000 sq
km of sedimentary basins.

Cambodia
Cambodia‚Äôs National Petroleum Authority awarded Block E in the Khmer
basin to Medco International Petroleum
Ltd. and JHL Petroleum Ltd.
40

The basins with the acreage covered
under the agreement are identical to
Yemen‚Äôs productive basins, Range said.
The agreement calls for Canmex to
become operator and spend $50 million to earn an 80% interest in the two
blocks in Puntland State. The minimum
work program is two exploration wells
in each basin.
Of the 80% interest, one-fourth in
one or both basins is available to third
parties on terms agreeable with Range
and Canmex.
The companies have received expressions of support from the Puntland and
Transitional Federal Government of
Somalia. ‚ú¶

Wellbore curvature
and torsion greatly influence the forces applied
on the downhole pipe
string and its consequent deformation. They
Drilling
serve as the bases for
calculating the drag and
torque of a pipe string and checking
its strength and also serve as indices to
evaluate the quality of a well trajectory.
Accordingly, curvature and torsion affect well drilling and completion, production, and even workover operations.
It‚Äôs necessary to accurately calculate
and describe the shape of a wellbore
trajectory in order to monitor and
control it effectively. A wellbore trajectory is a continuous and smooth curve
in space, which bends (builds or drops)
and turns simultaneously.
The industry has recognized the
importance of borehole curvature for
more than 50 years and has widely
applied the research results in the field.
Engineers have done very little research,
however, on borehole torsion.
This article models a moving frame
on a wellbore trajectory, gives its equation and establishes contact with the
wellbore trajectory, and presents a new
method to describe the shape of wellbore trajectory in space.
From the point of view of kinematics, the article gives the law of frame‚Äôs
motion while moving along wellbore
trajectory and the kinematic meanings
of borehole curvature and torsion, thus
revealing the intrinsic relationship and
basic characteristic of various parameters of wellbore trajectories.
The method and equations discussed
provide mathematically consistent techniques, not only for planned well paths,
but also for survey calculations.

Inclination, azimuth
Originally, the oil and gas industry
was focused on drilling vertical wells.
The concept of inclination angle arose
when engineers realized that a drilled
trajectory is not a plumb line. Then the
concept of azimuth angle came into being when they further understood that

O D U C T I O N

a drilled trajectory does not change in a
vertical plane.
We can describe the change in direction of a well trajectory by means of
inclination angle and azimuth angle,
but the curvature is also significant, as it
greatly affects well drilling, completion,
and even production.
Over the past 50 years, the drilling industry has engaged in a lot of
research related to the
problem of borehole
curvature.1-11 In 1957,
Lubinski published
a now well-known
formula to calculate
dogleg angle and its

wellbore trajectory curvature are bending angle (dogleg angle) and borehole

Although the last three methods
show considerable error and are inconvenient to use, they were commonly
used into the 1980s. Today, the analytic

Fitchard and S.A. Fitchard introduced
a formula to calculate borehole torsion
applied to a cylindrical helix trajectory
(OGJ, Jan. 17, 1983, pp. 121-124). In
the following 10 years, there was little
additional research on borehole torsion.
Since 1992, we have systematically
studied the curvature and torsion of
wellbore trajectories in space using
differential geometry.5 7-11 Through establishing a moving frame on wellbore
trajectory and contacting it with the trajectory‚Äôs equation, we introduce a new
perspective and method to describe the
shape of wellbore trajectory in space.
From the perspective of differential geometry, this expands the definitions and
geometric meanings of bending angle,

O D U C T I O N

borehole curvature, torsion angle, and
borehole torsion.
This work verifies the research
results provided by A. Lubinski and G.J.
Wilson with regard to wellbore curvature, and presents general equations to
determine torsion angle and borehole
torsion.5 7 10 It also includes concrete
calculation formulae for various typical
models of wellbore trajectory, revealing
the intrinsic relationship and characteristics of the various parameters of
wellbore trajectory.
With regard to survey calculations,
this author and colleagues proposed
the curve structure method based on
the bending and turning parameters of
wellbore trajectory9 10 and researched
the calculation method to determine

the average borehole curvature over a
survey interval.11
In addition, we investigated the law
of frame‚Äôs motion while moving along
a wellbore trajectory from the point
of view of kinematics and provide the
kinematic meanings of borehole curvature and torsion.

Moving frame
As mentioned, a wellbore trajectory
is a continuous and smooth curve in
space, bending and turning simultaneously to change direction. There are
some intrinsic relations between the
parameters that serve as the basis of
describing and calculating a well trajectory.

Basic equation
Draw a tangent line across a given
point P on a well trajectory and intercept a unit length on the tangent line
as unit tangent vector t; it points in the
onward direction of the well trajectory
(Fig. 1). Next, draw a unit vector in the
bending direction of the well trajectory
as unit principal normal vector n; it
points in the concave direction of well
trajectory.
Again, draw a unit vector perpendicular to both t and n as binormal vector
b, viz. b = t √ó n. The three unit vectors
form a right-hand system and constitute the moving frame of well trajectory
at point P,5 7 9 10 also known as ‚ÄúFrenet‚Äôs
frame.‚Äù12 13
Finding out the relation between

the moving frame and well trajectory
requires embodying the equation of the
moving frame. Equation 1 defines the
well trajectory in vector form (accompanying box). According to differential
geometry,12 13 Equation 2 expresses the
relationship among unit tangent vector
t, unit principal normal vector n, unit
binormal vector b, and displacement
vector r of well trajectory.
Thus, the moving frame is in combination with the equation of well
trajectory, which makes it feasible to
describe the curvature and torsion of
well trajectory in space by virtue of the
moving frame (Fig. 2).
According to the differential model

One can form a moving frame at any
point P on a well trajectory. From the
point of view of kinematics, when the

the moving frame will move concordantly with it. It has been mathematically proven that Equation 5 or 6, viz.

and having the ability to run
casing smoothly and successfully depends on borehole
curvature; it is therefore a
significant factor for safe,
quick, and efficient drilling.
There are two ways of
deducing the applied formula
for calculating borehole curvature.5 7 8 One is to substitute
the expression of unit tangent
vector, t, from Equation 4
into Equation 11, another is
to substitute the formula of
bending angle, ùõÜ, from Equation 10 into Equation 12, another definitive expression of
borehole curvature. Through
mathematical deduction,
both methods yield Equation
13, which is the same as that
presented by Wilson.4 But it
is necessary to point out that
Equation 13 applies to calculate the borehole curvature at
a given point.

Average curvature
During the process of
drilling, engineers usually
pay attention to the average
curvature of a survey interval.
Generally, borehole curvature
varies with measured depth
rather than a constant, which is the
reason for calculating average curvature.
At present, Equations 14 and 15 are
popularly used to calculate the average
curvature of a survey interval.
In order to calculate the average curvature scientifically and reasonably, the
author draws the following conclusions
based on theoretical analyses and lots of
example calculation:11
‚Ä¢ In most cases, Equations 5 and
6 yield very similar results. Thus, it is
acceptable to use either formula for
calculating the average curvature of a
survey interval.
‚Ä¢ For natural-curve trajectories and
cylinder-helix trajectories, the value of
average inclination angle for a survey
interval equals that of inclination angle
at the midpoint as inclination angle is
46

at a given point. It sometimes
shows considerable error to
calculate the average curvature of a survey interval
through substituting average
values of interval parameters
into Equation 14.
Equation 15, however, is deduced from the
mathematical definition of
borehole curvature and is
more reasonable in terms of
theoretical analyses and calculated results. Therefore, the
author recommends using
Equation 15 to calculate the
average curvature of a survey
interval.

t

linear functions vs. measured depth.
Thus, the result from Equation 14 actually represents the value of borehole
curvature at the midpoints for naturalcurve trajectories and cylinder-helix
trajectories.
‚Ä¢ It has been proven that Equation
15 fully conforms to spatial-arc model
in theory7 and verified with actual
data.11
‚Ä¢ There always exists some error
when using Equation 14 to calculate
the average curvature of a spatial-arc
interval. The bigger ùõã and ‚àÜL are, the
larger the error. Except for œâ = 0¬∞ or œâ
= 180¬∞, errors exist at other tool face
angles, and the biggest one may be
beyond 60%.11
In conclusion, Equation 14 is a formula for calculating borehole curvature

The industry defines the
included angle between two
binormal vectors of wellbore
trajectory at different two
points in its onward direction as the torsion angle
(Fig. 5).5 7 According to the
definition of the included
angle between two vectors,
Equation 16 gives the torsion
angle between the two given
points on a wellbore trajectory. Substituting Equation
4 into Equation 16 yields
Equation 17, which is the formula for
calculating the torsion angle.
It is necessary to point out that
bending angle cannot directly express
the bending extent of a wellbore trajectory. Nevertheless, as an important indirect parameter, use of bending angle
can simplify the calculation method
and process of planning well path and
performing survey calculations. In the
same way, torsion angle is not a direct
parameter of expressing torsion extent
of a wellbore trajectory.
Borehole torsion, illustrating the extent of well trajectory‚Äôs departure from
a plane curve, is the rotating rate that
the binormal vector of well trajectory
rotates with respect to curved length. It
depicts the torsion extent of wellbore
trajectory.5 7 Equation 18 is the definiOil & Gas Journal / Oct. 23, 2006

Bankers says the mineralogy from
logs and cores indicates that the zone
has much pyrite and chlorite that
would have reacted badly with the acid.
The well did produce some gas after a
substantial amount of frac fluid was recovered during 31‚ÅÑ2 months. Production
increased to 24 Mcfd before the well was
shut in due to the sale of Vintage.
Tyner Resources Ltd.‚Äôs Tyner Stephens
well, with an estimated 116 bcf/section in
place, is the most successful well to date in
the area. A Tyner press release says that after
fracture stimulation the Bend shale produced between 400 Mcfd and the absolute
open flow of 1.5 MMcfd, after recovery of
2,300-4,000 bbl of frac fluid.
The current gas flow is 340 Mcfd at
a 40-psi wellhead pressure and 1.15
Mcfd at 12 psi. Tyner says the well was
perforated in a 150-ft vertical section
with four 12-ft sections in the primary
Bend group target. The lower 12-ft section penetrated a sand interval that was
not fraced to ensure that no fracture
stimulation energy was dissipated in the
sand, according to Tyner.
The company‚Äôs reentry program isolated the shale perforations and monitored a flow test of the shale for 4 days,
while implementing a low-pressure

pipeline simulation at the surface. Tyner
says the isolated shale zone flowed 250
Mcfd of 1,400-btu gas without any
production decline during the test.
Tyner expects to meet pipeline-btu
gas specifications by stripping off about
28 bbl of NGL at the pipeline connections. The test also yielded 20 bo/d.
The lowest perforation in the sand
interval produced 200 Mcfd also of
1,400-btu gas. Tyner expects this sand
interval, when successfully fraced, to
produce an additional 0.8-1.4 MMcfd.
Tyner fraced its Broseh well with 804
bbl of KCl treated water, 1.36 MMcf of
nitrogen, and 82,405 lb of Carobilite
20/40 sand. Perforations screened off
while pumping 3-ppg sand, leaving
51,405 lb of sand in the formation.
Since completing the frac, Tyner says
the well has recovered 1,100-1,500 bbl of
frac fluids and after a 48-hr shut-in, the
wellhead pressure was 1,100 psi, while
after 12 hr it was 480 psi. The pressure
blows off in 4 hr with an open choke.
The company is swabbing 40-45
b/d of fluid and experiences shut-in
pressure increase daily, with a good gas
blow after each swab run.
Bankers currently is evaluating various
stimulation designs for its Misener well

because the well is slightly different from
other wells in that it is more fractured.
The well has one to two fractures/ft
throughout the Bend group. A Schlumberger FMI log shows that these are fairly
large 1‚ÅÑ2-1 mm fractures.
Bankers plans to stimulate and test
the Granite Wash sands and the Bend
shale in this well separately. The deepest
Granite Wash sands tested have shown
little water. These are 600 ft below the
identified Bend shale test interval.
Bankers may use gelled-diesel
fracs, straight slickwater fracs, as well
as cross-linked gelled-water fracs for
stimulating this well.
It plans to restimulate the Cogdell
well after stimulations in the Misener
well. Along with the original tested
interval in the Cogdell well, Bankers
also will test what it considers the sweet
spot in the shale in this well.
After Cogdell, Bankers will move to
its Jones No. 1 well that it drilled to test
the Bend shale.
Bankers says that by pursuing this
basin methodically and scientifically
and acquiring knowledge from the previous stimulations and tests, it will find
a way to produce gas from the basin
economically. ‚ú¶

Isobutane alkylation is a common
refinery process used to produce high-

quality gasoline (OGJ, Nov. 12, 1990, p.
79). The most desirable components in
alkylate gasoline are trimethylpentanes
(TMPs), which have research octane
numbers (RONs) greater than 100.
Conventional alkylation processes
use either H2SO4 or anhydrous HF acid
as catalysts. This has significant safety
and environmental concerns due to the
handling of large quantities of spent
H2SO4 or hazardous HF.
Solid acids have shown promise as
less hazardous catalysts for alkylation1
and have been subjected to extensive
pilot scale testing.2 3 Solid-acid catalysts,
however, deactivate rapidly, resulting in
low product yield and loss of reaction
selectivity.4
The rapid deactivation is due to a
buildup of carbenium ions on active
sites of the solid catalysts. Once this carbonaceous material is formed, it is difficult to remove from the narrow catalyst
pores. Moreover, the cost of solid-acid
catalysts is relatively high and there is
no technically sound method for regenerating spent solid-acid catalysts.

cally used as solvents and homogeneous

pressure, good solubility to a wide
range of organic and inorganic compounds, and ability to be recycled for
reuse.7
Acidic chloroaluminate (III) IL has
been used as a homogeneous catalyst
for isobutane alkylation. Its use eliminates the diffusion limitation present
with solid-acid catalyst systems, and
alkylated gasoline is easily separated
from the ionic liquid.8-10
TMP yield and selectivity, however,
are low in systems with conventionalIL‚Äîwith and without adjusting the
IL‚Äôs acidity by varying either the molar
fraction of aluminum chloride (AlCl3)
of the IL or adding hydrochloric acid
(HCl).10-12
A study showed that adding aromatic hydrocarbons and metal chlorides
to aluminum chloride-dialkyl ether
complex enhanced TMP selectivity. It is
theorized that adding aromatic hydrocarbons and metal chlorides enhances
the acidity of catalyst for alkylation
reactions and inhibits undesirable side
reactions such as isomerization and
cracking.13
In subsequent experiments, aromatic
hydrocarbons and cuprous chloride
(CuCl) were added to a conventionalIL, which showed high TMP yield and
selectivity.10 11 14 Adding CuCl to an aluminum chloride-dialkyl ether complex
or conventional-IL, however, results
in formation of a fine suspension that
is difficult to separate and recycle in a
continuous-flow system.

from ionikylation are attractive, even
though the cost of the composite-IL
catalyst is more than H2SO4.
Compared with the pilot test results,
the commercial performance of retrofitted ionikylation was less than optimal.
This is due to the use of an existing
Stratco reactor system, which has a long
reaction time.
This results in increased side reactions such as cracking and isomerization, which form light and heavy
components in alkylate gasoline. These
are evident from the shift in distillation
temperature at 10% yield (81.5¬∞ C. vs.
98.6¬∞ C.) and final boiling point (154¬∞
C. vs. 129.4¬∞ C.) when comparing the
pilot results with those of the retrofitted
unit.
We are currently conducting process
optimization work to improve the commercial performance of ionikylation
further by varying the size and type of
static mixer and potentially replacing
the Stratco reactor with a static mixer to
minimize reaction time.

Agency will produce computerized reviews of reports, as well as performing
audits and inspections.
Each party in the ULSD chain sets
and manages its own sulfur-receipt
specs. Reports and records must show
that handoffs of material match for each
compliance period and transaction. Terminal handoffs must match the pipeline specs, but the terminal can change
material designations as long as it meets
compliance period balances. Terminal-to-trucker handoffs must show
‚Äúsubstantial agreement‚Äù and include an
explanation if this level of agreement is
not met.
Figs. 1 and 2 show potential approaches to executing cuts between
distillate types and between gasoline
and distillate, respectively.
Reports and records must also show
that material balances were maintained
for the compliance period. Designateand-track allows a 2 vol % tolerance for
pipelines to account for volume swell,
metering, and other measurement
variables.
Designate-and-track also allows
downgrading of up to 20% of material.

Off-spec material
Delivery of off-spec material will
likely result in a shutdown of receipt or
delivery to prevent additional off-spec
material being shipped. This would trigger additional sampling and testing to
verify the original results.
If additional tests confirm the material as off-spec, testing by an outside
laboratory may occur to further verify
the results. At this point, the shipper
and the pipeline would likely collaborate to determine what options might
be available.
The party in possession of off-spec
ULSD at the time of testing is presumed
to be liable for violations of the sulfur
standard. The party in possession is
responsible for accurately representing
how the product can be legally used.
In general, if a pipeline samples and
tests the product upon receipt and finds
it to be compliant ULSD but later finds
that it is no longer on-spec, the pipe-

line would be required to regrade the
product to LSD or off-road and would
be liable for the regrade cost.
The pipeline becomes liable in a
legal sense, and susceptible to EPA fines,
if it fails to recognize the off-spec situation and continues to represent the
fuel as being ULSD compliant when it
is not.
In the event that the party in possession wants to contest its liability,
possible defenses include producing
documentation that accounts for the
product and shows that it didn‚Äôt cause
the material to go off-spec.
If the parties involved in handling
the product cannot agree as to where
it went off-spec and go to the EPA to
settle the dispute, the EPA will examine
the adequacy of the parties‚Äô quality-as-

surance and quality-control programs as
part of making its decision.
If an EPA test shows violation, while
the terminal test of the same fuel shows
compliance, the terminal may also be
able establish a periodic sampling and
testing program as part of its defense.
The EPA will allow 3-ppm variability
in sulfur testing between labs for the
first 2 years of the ULSD program, after
which 2 ppm of variability will be allowed.
Redesignation or downgrading of
material as a result of contamination by
interface with a higher-sulfur product is
allowed, subject to the 20% limit of the
designate-and-track program. The shipper, working with the supplier-refiner,
determines what redesignation to give
an off-spec material.

Clean Air Act guidelines allow for a
maximum civil penalty of $32,500/
day/violation. In an effort to remove
any economic benefit of non-compliance, however, designate-and-track
presumes that the material was in the
distribution system for 25 days, raising the potential per violation fine to
$800,000.
Custody-transfer points offer the
highest likelihood of challenges under

Pipelines that do not transport other
high-sulfur products, for example gasoline and ULSD only, can afford to set a
more liberal specification. Pipelines that
transport products that can add sulfur
need to be more conservative. Smallrefiner gasoline could also be a source
of sulfur.
Short pipelines will typically experience a lower level of sulfur pickup

production moving to PADDs I and II.
Each handoff between pipelines risks
addition of sulfur from valve timing
and line flushes between locations. Staging products in breakout tanks within a
pipeline system can also add sulfur.
Fungible pipelines run on product
cycles where receipt volumes are commingled and stripped off at delivery
terminals en route. Commingling like
products requires strict oversight and
testing to protect the fungible pool
from contamination.
Segregated systems receive specific
batches and usually deliver them back
to the supplier at a new location. The
batches are not commingled and will
move intact, with the specification
properties unchanged. There is, however, still a chance that sulfur can be
increased, depending on how products
are sequenced, valve timing, and flushes
between facilities.
Some carriers are very explicit in
circumstances where material might be
above their cut-off spec but still below
15 ppm, having zero tolerance for
variation. Others are somewhat more
flexible and willing to provide a waiver
depending on the degree to which the
product is off-spec, destination options,
and other variables.
Colonial Pipeline Co. and Olympic
Pipe Line Co. each have specified a
maximum of 8 ppm for ULSD entering
their systems. Explorer Pipeline Co. allows 8 ppm for ULSD received directly
from refineries into its system but drops
the limit to 7 ppm for ULSD originating
in Lake Charles, La., and Port Neches,
Tex.
Buckeye Pipe Line Co. will take ULSD
up to 8 ppm from refineries and up to
10 ppm from connecting carriers. At
Marathon Pipe Line LLC, the acceptable
sulfur content depends on the source
and delivery point (OGJ, May 22, 2006,
p. 18).

The transition
Concerns surrounding the transportation of ULSD through pipelines have
included:

Transportation of ULSD via pipeline heightens any potential product-quality problems on the pipeline‚Äôs
systems, making proper flushing of prover loops such as the one shown here very important (Fig. 6; photo
from Colonial Pipeline Co.).
‚Ä¢ Protecting the integrity of a 15ppm product.
‚Ä¢ Potential migration of sulfur
molecules in a 15-ppm environment
requiring a significant increase in the
volume downgraded at interface.
‚Ä¢ Reliability and accuracy of test
equipment.
‚Ä¢ Potential price spikes or lack of
spot availabilities during the transition
period.
Tests late in 2005 by the Association of Oil Pipe Lines and the American
Petroleum Institute indicated ULSD can
pick up as much as 3 ppm of sulfur
contamination between the certification tank and pipeline entry, while
tank farms and handoffs ‚Äúcontinue to
contribute 1-2 ppm each.‚Äù
That study concluded potential contamination points would be identified
and managed as pipeline companies
gain experience in handling ULSD. But
it also said dedicated ULSD infrastructure ‚Äúshould be considered,‚Äù since ‚Äúoffspec‚Äù distillate could ‚Äúlock up‚Äù the distribution system, affecting gasoline and
diesel supply. AOPL said its members are
spending an estimated $500 million to

minimize contamination (OGJ, May 22,
2006, p. 18).
Jim Scandola, Buckeye‚Äôs senior
manager, transportation, sees the introduction of ULSD as having proceeded
smoothly to this point. ‚ÄúThe product is
being tested and certified by the supplying refineries prior to shipment. There
have not been any surprises from my
perspective,‚Äù he told OGJ.
Regarding provisions of designateand-track that hold the party in possession of off-spec ULSD responsible for
its disposition, Scandola said that this
is not a problem ‚Äúas we already hold
ourselves accountable for any product
contamination or regrade situation for
all products in our custody. Our oversight program will be robust enough to
recognize these situations and keep the
risk of inaccurately representing ULSD
as on-spec very low.‚Äù
Scandola said Buckeye is similarly
prepared to handle the 20% limit on
product downgrading. ‚ÄúOur experience
thus far is that [the restriction] is rather
generous. If a facility continues to
downgrade up to 20% of their annual
volume, they shouldn‚Äôt be in business.

Colonial Pipeline Co.‚Äôs preparations to transport ULSD included installation of new transfer system components, including the 10-in. line shown (Fig. 7; photo from Colonial Pipeline Co.).
At least they will make other carriers
the carrier of choice in a competitive
environment.‚Äù
Colonial also reports a positive
transition to this point. The company
budgeted $60 million to overall ULSD
improvements, including more than
300 valves and 4 new tanks (2 in
Atlanta, and 2 in Greensboro, NC). The
new valves are positive-sealing valves,
which minimize any contamination of
ULSD by other products (Fig. 4).
Colonial Vice-President Jerry Martin
explained that ‚Äúthe extra storage space,
combined with changes in how we
sequence products in the pipeline, were
key improvements. ULSD is bracketed
with low-sulfur diesel to further protect
ULSD shipments.‚Äù
Colonial‚Äôs Phase One improvements
committed the company to on-spec
shipments as far north and east as Fairfax, Va., according to Martin. ‚ÄúWe were
able to complete equipment upgrades
at Mitchell Junction in rural, central
Virginia in time to extend shipments
throughout the state, including the
Tidewater area [Figs. 5-7]. Test results
into Dorsey Junction (central Maryland)
62

were also positive and allowed us to
begin scheduling ULSD into that facility, which serves Maryland, including
Baltimore.‚Äù
Colonial is currently studying a second phase, which could mean upgrades
from Dorsey as far north as Linden, NJ.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre carefully studying the [Linden]
test results we‚Äôre seeing so far,‚Äù said
Martin, noting that market demand
would also a play a role in the timing
of any second round of improvements.
Martin said that ‚Äúwe regard shipments
all the way to Linden as a matter of
when, not if.‚Äù
Initial indications from California,
which completed a California Air Resources Board-mandated transition to
ULSD for road use as of Sept. 1, 2006,
show no significant supply or price
disruption. The current EPA deadline for
universal use of ULSD is Dec. 1, 2010.

transition to ULSD.
In responding to filings from Norco
Pipeline Inc., Wood River Pipeline
(operated by Koch Pipeline Co. LP), and
Buckeye, FERC said that each pipeline
must account for all costs and revenues
related to ULSD surcharges separately
and must footnote amounts attributed
to the surcharge invested in carrier
plant on p. 212 of its annual Form No.
6 filing and any revenues and expenses
attributable to the surcharge on p. 700
of its filing. FERC‚Äôs goal in requiring the
Form No. 6 footnotes is to be able to
back out costs associated with the ULSD
surcharge when deriving appropriate
rate index adjustments in 2011.
Some FERC orders have denied
filings. These include denial of Magellan Pipeline Co.‚Äôs proposal to distribute ULSD-related costs over its entire
system.
SFPP LP‚Äôs tariff surcharge has been
protested by Tesoro Refining and
Marketing Co. and others that contend
that SFPP has failed to describe costs of
additional facilities or services related to
the ULSD transition.

Radar unit handles expanded oil Ô¨Åeld duties
An expanded Rosemount 3300 Series
guided wave radar level and interface
transmitter is designed to help users
enhance safety and efficiency in extreme
environments.
The expansion includes special probes
designed to prevent leakage and perform
reliably when exposed to high temperature
and pressure conditions over extended
periods. The 3300 is now available for
temperatures as high as 750¬∞ F. and pressures as high as 5,000 psig. Common
applications with these extreme environments include refinery distillation columns, liquefied gases and freons, power
plant utility heater vessels, gas-oil production separators, oil water separators, and
compressor tanks.
Materials for the special Rosemount
3300 probes have been selected to avoid
stress fractures commonly induced by high
pressures and temperatures. The design of
the new probes adapts to thermal expansion and contraction, retains strength, and

provides efficient feed-through of microwave signals, the company points out.

Blvd., Chanhassen, MN 55317.

Calibrators are available in six temperature ranges. All six of the ATC series
calibrators feature the dual-zone heating
block designed for optimum performance
and superior temperature homogeneity
throughout the block.

New push-Ô¨Åt tube Ô¨Åtting

New temperature calibrators
New JOFRA advanced temperature
calibrators (ATC) series combines the accuracy of laboratory temperature sources
with the speed and portability of field
dry-block calibrators. Units help make it
possible to calibrate even more sensors at
the same time along with large and odd
size sensors in either a large diameter dry
block or in a liquid bath.

The new Phastite tube fitting is assembled via simple push-fit operation,
and it provides permanent connections
for fluid systems operating at as much as
20,000 psi.
The firm says its fitting can replace cone
and thread or welded fittings. Phastite
employs a compression assembly principle
using a novel form of toothed profile,
which makes the seal. The fittings are supplied as one-piece components.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Shtokman surprise
a reminder of BTC
pipeline rebuke
Russia‚Äôs Oct. 9 turnabout on development of Shtokman gas and condensate
Ô¨Åeld in the Barents Sea shows that the
sword of pipeline politics has two edges.
Instead of taking aboard international
partners for the world-class project, OAO
Gazprom said it would work solo.
The decision fell hard on the Ô¨Åve
short-listed companies that had competed
for what were to have been two minority

interests in the project (OGJ Online, Oct.
10, 2006).
It also diverted Shtokman gas away
from the US. Gazprom said it would base
development on a pipeline to Germany
instead of an US-oriented LNG scheme.
Gazprom attributed this new Russian
elbow into the ribs of international investment to economics, not least the uncertainty of LNG sales in comparison with pipeline
deliveries secured by long-term contract.
The move surely will help Russia reestablish its supply-security credentials after
scaring European customers last winter by
cutting deliveries to Ukraine.
It also may represent exasperation over
Washington‚Äôs resistance to Moscow‚Äôs entry
into the World Trade Organization.
Long forgotten in the eminently forgetful US is the rebuke to Russia embodied
in the Batumi-Tibilisi-Ceyhan crude oil line
between Azerbaijan and Turkey by way of
Georgia.
That 1,040-mile, $4 billion marvel, operated by a BP group, started up last May.
It is supposed to transport 500,000 b/d by
the end of the year and can carry twice that
much.
There were shorter and cheaper routes
for Azeri output. But they would have transited Armenia, with which Azerbaijan lives
in perpetual hostility, or Iran, with which
the US has longstanding quarrels.
Another pipeline through Russia might
also have been an option. But it would have
increased tanker trafÔ¨Åc through the Bosporus Strait over the objection of Turkey,
which anyway stood to proÔ¨Åt from the BTC
project.
So the US strongly supported‚Äîsome
might say pushed‚Äîthe BTC pipeline. And
the justiÔ¨Åcation‚Äôs short version always had
little to do with Turkey and much to do with
avoiding Iran and Russia.
It‚Äôs probably too much to read BTC
comeuppance into the Shtokman stunner.
But it‚Äôs useful to remember that nobody‚Äôs
above playing politics with pipelines.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

OPEC calls emergency meeting
After weeks of falling crude prices, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries Ô¨Ånally agreed to an emergency meeting Oct. 19 in Qatar to discuss a possible production cut of 1 million b/d.
Analysts in the Houston ofÔ¨Åce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said the
group would try to work out details of what would be its Ô¨Årst ofÔ¨Åcial production cut
since April 2004. Ministers had been debating whether the cut would be from actual
output of about 27.5 million b/d for members other than Iraq or from the ‚Äúnotional‚Äù
group quota of 28 million b/d. ‚ÄúThe results of the meeting should help shrug off the
uncertainties related to the cut that have been hanging over the market in the last
couple of weeks,‚Äù the Raymond James analysts said.
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates the 10 OPEC members
subject to quota are producing 27.6 million b/d of crude.
However, Jacques Rousseau, senior energy analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
Group Inc., Arlington, Va., said, ‚ÄúOPEC (including Iraq) produced 29.8 million b/d of
crude oil in September and needs to produce 29.5 million b/d in the fourth quarter
of 2006 and 29 million b/d in the Ô¨Årst quarter of 2007 to balance global supply-demand.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúOPEC really does not need to remove supply from the market until
the Ô¨Årst quarter. However, we think it will occur before that due to the recent crude
oil price decline.‚Äù
Because of the gap between OPEC‚Äôs ofÔ¨Åcial quota and its actual production, the
‚Äúonly practical solution‚Äù would be a uniform 3.5% reduction for each member based
on September production levels, said analysts with the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale (SG) group.
‚ÄúWe do not think this [reduction] will have much impact on the market. At best,
OPEC can expect the market to give it some short-term credit by trading in a narrow
range (say $57-62/bbl) until it gets the Ô¨Årst indications on compliance,‚Äù they said.
‚ÄúThe oil market is indeed oversupplied (by only 500,000 b/d),‚Äù said SG analysts.
But that oversupply ‚Äúwould have disappeared mechanically‚Äù in the fourth quarter,
‚Äúeven with OPEC still producing at the current level,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúThe market has
been oversupplied on average for the last 3 years without having any downward
impact on the price. Therefore, strictly speaking, the market is not looking for a rebalancing of supply as it knows the bearish trend is not fueled by any physical issue but
rather for the degree of OPEC‚Äôs commitment to Ô¨Çoor the price at a certain level.‚Äù
Other market factors
After a steep fall earlier in the week, crude futures prices rallied Oct. 12-13 from
a 10-month low, buoyed by reports of the Ô¨Årst decline in US distillate inventories
since early August. The November contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes
hit a 2006 low of $57.22/bbl in overnight electronic trading Oct. 12 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange but rallied to close at $57.86/bbl. It Ô¨Ånished the week at $58.57/
bbl Oct. 13.
In the interim, safety authorities in Norway ordered production shut down at two
offshore platforms operated by Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, reportedly
over concerns about lifeboat standards. That has reduced Norwegian production by
280,000 b/d from 2.7 million b/d of crude oil and natural gas liquids.
Crude markets also were buoyed by unseasonably cold weather in the northeastern US (OGJ Online, Oct. 12, 2006). Nonetheless, crude futures prices ended the
week 2% lower Oct. 13.
Energy supplies
US distillate fuel inventories dropped 1.6 million bbl to 149.9 million bbl during the week ended Oct. 6. Ultralow-sulfur diesel dipped by 200,000 bbl in its Ô¨Årst
decline since the week ended July 14. Heating oil fell by 1.8 million bbl, the largest
decline since the week ended Mar. 24, said EIA ofÔ¨Åcials.
The November natural gas contract fell 36.8¬¢ to $5.78/MMbtu Oct. 12 and was
down to $5.66/MMbtu Oct. 13 on NYMEX as US winter gas storage increased to the
highest level ever. EIA reported the injection of 62 bcf of gas during the week ended
Oct. 6, boosting US storage to nearly 3.4 tcf, up by 410 bcf from year-ago levels and
358 bcf above the 5-year average.
Natural gas futures prices were higher in early trading Oct. 16 after Northeast US
weather turned colder than expected. A state of emergency was declared in Buffalo,
NY, where 2 ft of snow triggered power outages. The November natural gas contract fell Oct. 11-13, ending an 8-day rally and Ô¨Ånishing the week at $5.66/MMbtu on
NYMEX.

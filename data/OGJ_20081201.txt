COVER
The Mo-Ranch “catwalk” (cover) exemplifies early recycling efforts
in the Texas Hill Country. Dan Moran, president of Continental Oil
Co., built the 462-ft long bridge around 1940 with junked, 4-in.
OD oil field pipe and part of a derrick. In this issue, beginning
on p. 22, Oil & Gas Journal reports on current industry efforts in
health, safety, and the environment. Companies are using software
to streamline HSE management. Hercules Offshore has implemented a new HSE dashboard (p. 39), while BP and Petrotechnics used
a software-supported process to identify best practices in the Gulf
of Mexico (p. 42). In some US states, standards for air-quality
permits are changing (p. 48), and the EPA reports that US refiners have reduced hazardous air emissions (p. 50). Along pipeline
ROWs, on site biologists assist as “biomonitors” during construction (p. 58). Photo by Nina M. Rach.

CobraMax® H service boosts
gas production, cuts time and
cost on horizontal wells by
fracturing with coiled tubing
The Challenge:
British Columbia, Canada—A Canadian operator
used Halliburton’s CobraMax® H service to place
multiple fractures in a horizontal well in the
Montney shale formation. The treatment was
successful and the well produced 160,000 m3
gas/day (5.6 mmcf/d) which was more than the
operator expected. Completing the five fractures
took five days and the treatment required three
bottomhole assemblies (BHAs). The operator
liked the results and requested Halliburton work
on speeding up the process because each BHA
change required eight hours of coiled tubing
operations.

 The new CobraMax H system achieves maximum conductivity

in the near-wellbore region to overcome flow convergence issues
common in horizontal wells.

The Solution:
Halliburton made three improvements that dramatically increased the speed of CobraMax H treatments: an
erosion-resistant BHA that could last for an entire operation on a well, an improved sand plug technique to isolate
intervals and a new fluid design.

“I now have higher
production with
increased speed and
lower cost from
CobraMax H —
quality, service and
price without
any tradeoffs.”

The Results:
The new CobraMax H system has now been used on dozens of
horizontal wells in the Montney play. Seven zones fractured in
40 hours is now routine performance. Completion costs have typically
been slashed by more than 40 percent. Safety and reliability have
improved. And wells fractured with CobraMax H service are the
best performers in the field.

For more information about how CobraMax H service can help reduce the time for multizone frac treatments and
make your field more profitable, visit www.halliburton.com/reliability or e-mail stimulation@halliburton.com.

General

Interest

Hydraulic fracturing foe gains clout in House
The powerful US House Committee on Energy and Commerce
has a new leader who has consistently opposed operations crucial
to the production of natural gas from unconventional reservoirs.
Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) succeeded in a bid, launched the
day after the Nov. 4 general election, to unseat John Dingell (DMich.), chairman since 1981 and the longest-serving member of
Congress.
Waxman, a supporter of aggressive environmental causes, is
a persistent foe of hydraulic fracturing, a completion technique
applied to wells drilled into low-permeability reservoirs such as
shales and coalbeds (OGJ, Nov. 17, 2008, p. 20).
In the last session of Congress, Waxman was chairman of the
House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In a
hearing of that committee he called hydraulic fracturing “a dangerous practice.”
He has criticized a provision of the Energy Policy Act of 2005
that exempted hydraulic fracturing from federal regulation under
the Safe Drinking Water Act.
The completion method, which producers have used for nearly
60 years, is regulated at the state level.
A more immediate issue before the energy committee in the
next session of Congress, however, will be climate change.
A bill drafted by Dingell and Rep. Dick Boucher (D-Va.) and
published in October sets reduction targets for greenhouse gas
emissions in line with those espoused by President-Elect Barack
Obama.
But the draft has drawn criticism from environmental groups
because of accommodations it makes to the auto and coal industries, which are important to Dingell and Boucher.

France outlines new renewable energies program
France’s Environment and Energy Minister Jean-Louis Borloo
offered a “national plan for renewable energies” on Nov. 17. The
plan sets aside, for the time being, any assessment of the European
Union’s biofuels draft directive to bring the share of biofuels in
transport to 10% by 2020.
The plan aims to bring to 23% the share of renewables in the
energy mix by 2020. This corresponds to 20 million tonnes of oil
equivalent and involves 50 different measures to develop biomass,
wind, geothermal, hydro, sea energies, and especially solar energy,

which is targeted to jump to 5,400 Mw in 2020 from 13 Mw in
2007—all of which is to take place in an environmentally safe way.
To help achieve these targets, a €1 billion fund will be set up during 2009-11, and the tax credits will be extended to 2012.
Jean-Louis Borloo explained that the “change of model and the
change of scale” is intended to go from an essentially carbon-based
model to a totally decarbonized model “where each home, each
company, and each community will become its own energy producer.”

Russia, Venezuela to form ‘strategic oil alliance’
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez plans to enter into a strategic
alliance with Russia aimed at developing his country’s oil industry,
according to a senior government minister.
“It will be a strategic alliance between Petroleos de Venezuela SA
(PDVSA) and an oil consortium of all the Russian firms, state and
private, a large industrial conglomerate not just for production, but
also for the entire matter of refining and industrialization,” said
Venezuela Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez.
A strategic cooperation agreement was to be signed on Nov.
26 during Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev’s visit to Caracas,
Ramirez said, noting that Moscow also is pursuing a policy “of
greater cooperation” with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
In November, Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Sergei Bogdanchikov said five of Russia’s largest oil and gas firms each have taken
a 20% stake in the national consortium formed to develop heavy
oil fields in Venezuela’s Orinoco River basin.
The consortium was registered on Oct. 8, Bogdanchikov said. In
addition to Rosneft, the Russian group is comprised of Gazprom,
Lukoil, TNK-BP, and Surgutneftegaz. PDVSA will have the controlling stake in the larger consortium announced by Ramirez, and the
companies will complete formalities by next spring.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin explained the rationale for the consortium with Venezuela.
“The consortium derives from practical considerations: crude
produced at certain Venezuelan blocs is heavy, and it is necessary
to build refineries capable of making commercial oil,” Sechin said.
“Such refineries are rather expensive ($6-6.5 billion), and that is
too much for one company.” ✦

The 6-BFR-1-ESS and 6-BAZ-1DB-ESS wells were drilled 80 km
offshore and 5 and 6 km, respectively, to the north and south of
another discovery well 1-ESS-103A in the presalt section under the
Jubarte field.
The reservoirs of the two latest wells are under a layer of salt
as thick as 700 m and at 1,348-1,426 m from the water line. The
reservoirs are 4,200-4,800 m subsea and have oil-bearing porous
thicknesses of 190 and 300 m.
So far, six wells have been drilled in the Espirito Santo presalt
layer, all successful. With these discoveries the total estimated volume of oil in the Parque das Baleias area, including reservoirs above
and below the salt layer, already amounts to 3.5 billion boe.

Ecopetrol farms into Eni’s gulf assets
Colombia’s state-owned Ecopetrol will acquire a 20-25% stake
in Eni SPA’s exploration portfolio in the Gulf of Mexico. It will pay
more than $220 million to cover Eni’s drilling costs for five wells
by Dec. 31, 2012.
Eni described the partnership as a “strategic agreement” that
would help it to better manage and diversify its exploration risk.
The company has lease interests in 408 blocks within the gulf,
70% of which are in deep water. Last year it had an 80% exploration success rate and has a daily equity production of more than
100,000 boe.
Both companies also signed a memorandum of understanding
to evaluate other farm-in opportunities for Ecopetrol from Eni’s
exploration portfolio. Ecopetrol will also offer Eni access to opportunities in Colombia and other South American countries.

Research sought on unconventional gas
Research Partnership to Secure Energy for America (RPSEA),
Sugar Land, Tex., has requested industry proposals for projects on
gas shales, coalbed methane water management, and tight sands.
The full text of the RFPs is on the RPSEA web site. The proposals
are due Jan. 12, 2009, for projects to start around April 2009.
The focus of the gas shales proposal is on the challenges associated with development of the shale resource from the Permian
basin through the Fort Worth basin and in southern Appalachian
shale gas basins.
Concepts may include characterization of parameters that dif-

Australia awards offshore E&P permits
Australia has awarded 13 offshore exploration permits in its
2007 release scheme, and the successful companies have pledged a
total expenditure of $500 million (Aus.) in exploration investment
over the next 6 years, despite the global economic crisis.
The permits lie off Western Australia and Northern Territory,
and four of them have been designated frontier areas, which means
the successful companies are entitled to a more-favorable tax rate.
Woodside Petroleum was awarded three permits (WA-415-P,
WA-416-P, and WA-417-P) in the little-explored offshore Canning
basin which lies inshore of the Browse basin region.
Returning independents Hunt Oil and Murphy Australia, along
with local company Nexus Energy, won the four Browse basin permits on offer. Hunt received WA-413-P and WA-414-P, while Murphy secured WA-429-P and Nexus scored WA-424-P.
Small Perth-based explorer Finder Exploration won the sole
permit on offer in the Carnarvon basin, WA-418-P.
Newcomer Essar Exploration & Production of India won two
permits (NT/P77 and NT/P78) in the Northern Territory area of
the Bonaparte basin, while Melbourne-based Albers Group companies added to its existing tally of Bonaparte permits with three
more in the Western Australian area (WA-420-P, WA-421-P, and
WA-422-P).
A total of 24 bids was received for the 13 permits on offer. ✦

Production

Arrow to develop CSM project in China
Arrow Energy Ltd., Brisbane, has extended its operations in China by signing a heads of agreement with Bin Chang Mining Group
to develop coal seam methane (CSM) in Shaanxi Province.
Arrow and Bin Chang will begin a pilot well drilling program
to assess the potential surface mine degassing and CSM production
in an area that covers 360 sq km within Bin Chang’s coal mining
licenses.
The region has a good coal resource data base, according to Arrow, and it has been explored using closely spaced core holes that
have defined a coal resource of 6,000 billion tonnes of coal. The
estimated in-place CSM resource exceeds 1 tcf.
Arrow says the program will have dual benefits of gas produc8

ferentiate high-performing wells and development of methods to
assess production potential, model production results, delineate the
fracture system, develop extra-extended lateral drilling techniques,
develop steerable hydraulic fracs, and a host of other concepts.
Another request is for development of tools, techniques, and
methods to greatly reduce the cost and environmental impact of
CBM and shale gas development through more effective management of water used and produced in drilling, completion, stimulation, and production.
The tight sands solicitation seeks proposals for development of
tools, techniques, and methods to increase commercial production
and ultimate recovery from established tight gas sand formations
and accelerate development of emerging and frontier tight gas
plays. This work is to be focused on the Rocky Mountain region.

tion and improved mine safety.
Bin Chang will cover program costs, and Arrow will design and
operate the work, using technology it developed in Australia. It will
be Arrow’s first CSM drilling project in China and the first program
to use Arrow’s surface to in-seam horizontal well technology for
mine drainage.
If commercial volumes of gas are produced in the pilot program, the two parties will enter into a formal joint venture to develop CSM over the entire license area. The pilot program is expected to be completed by mid-2009.
Arrow also has been awarded a CSM business development license for its earlier joint venture with the Urumqi Geological Exploration Development Co. of the Xinjiang Geological Survey.

Total, Aramco delay Jubail reﬁnery project
Total SA said the award of construction tenders for its $10 billion Jubail refinery joint venture with Saudi Aramco has been delayed because of uncertainties in global financial markets.
The partners, Aramco 62.5% and Total 37.5%, previously said
tenders to build the 400,000 b/d facility would be awarded in
first-quarter 2009. The French firm said the award of construction
contracts would be set back by at least 3 months.
Recently, in a related development, Aramco said it cancelled a
contract awarded in July to Saipem subsidiary Snamprogetti for
development of Manifa oil field offshore (OGJ Online, Nov. 19,
2008).
Oil from Manifa was intended for the Jubail refinery, according
to Jean-Jacques Mosconi, Total’s senior vice-president for strategy
and development.
In June, Mosconi told the European Fuels Conference that the
Jubail refinery would process Arab Heavy and a new grade from
Manifa oil field, which was scheduled to begin production in
2011.
“About 70-80% of Manifa will go to Jubail,” Mosconi told the
conference delegates, adding that distillate products produced at
the complex refinery would be exported, mostly to Europe, while
some would be shipped to Asia.
The decision to delay the Jubail refinery follows an earlier an-

China, Costa Rica develop joint reﬁnery plans
Costa Rica’s Refinadora Costarricense de Petroleo (Recope) and
China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) are jointly considering
plans for the construction of a refinery in the Central American
country.
CNPC and Recope will conduct a feasibility study for the facility, which would be able to process 200,000 b/d, or about eight
times the capacity of Costa Rica’s existing facility at Puerto Moin
on the Caribbean.
The announcement followed an earlier one by Recope Pres. Jose
Leon Desanti, who said CNPC would help Costa Rica boost the
capacity of its existing Puerto Moin refinery to 60,000 b/d from
25,000 b/d by 2013.
The two announcements build on earlier initiatives agreed by
the two countries.
In November 2007, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, returning from a state visit to China, said CNPC was analyzing the possibility of establishing a refinery in Costa Rica in order to sell fuel
to Central America and the Caribbean.
According to Arias, the $6 billion refinery project is indepen-

Chemical Co. to carry out a feasibility study into development of a
petrochemical project in Papua New Guinea.
Under the agreement Oil Search and the two Japanese companies will work together and coordinate with the government
to investigate the development of a petrochemical industry and
its associated benefits to all concerned based on current economic
conditions.
Oil Search’s managing director said the companies want to better understand the commercialization options that exist for gas in
Papua New Guinea, and that includes further LNG trains, petrochemicals, and other gas-based domestic and export industries.
“This new study will satisfy a core initiative announced last July
following the signing of the domestic gas MOU with the Papua
New Guinea government,” he added.

dent of another one the Chinese had to revamp the Moin facility to
enable it to process fuels required for domestic needs.
As part of the Moin development, Recope announced plans in
February to expand its storage capacity by 550,000 bbl to 3.95
million bbl by 2011.
Recope said the $15 million project will see installation of two
25,000 bbl tanks at the Moin refinery, as well as a 200,000 bbl
light crude tank and a 100,000 bbl diesel tank.
The project also covers work on two 50,000 bbl diesel tanks for
the state refiner’s Barranco distribution facility, while a 100,000
bbl diesel tank will be built for the El Alto de Ochomogo distribution plant.
Plans also call for existing tanks at the La Garita site to be converted to hold jet fuel instead of gasoline.

First Tangguh LNG exports to be on schedule
Indonesian officials, quickly reversing earlier statements, said
the first LNG exports from the BP PLC-led Tangguh project will be
shipped in February 2009 as scheduled.
Raden Priyono, head of the upstream oil and gas regulatory
body BPMigas, said the project is being completed on schedule and
denied earlier reports that the shipment would be delayed from
first-quarter 2009.
Previously, a BPMigas official said the $5 billion Tangguh LNG
project would be delayed until second-quarter 2009.
“It will come on stream in the second quarter of next year,” BPMigas deputy chief Djoko Harsono told reporters on the sidelines
of the Gasex conference, without giving a reason for the delay.
Earlier reports indicated that Indonesia would not delay shipments of Tangguh LNG to CNOOC’s Fujian terminal in China, despite an ongoing price renegotiation with Beijing. The shipments
are scheduled to begin in first-quarter 2009.
“We must respect the contract,” said Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro. “We are continuing negotiations, but as the negotiation has yet to reach an agreement, we
must follow the contract,” he said (OGJ Online, Oct. 30, 2008).

Dolphin Energy begins supplying gas to Oman
Abu Dhabi’s Dolphin Energy, as part of a 25-year gas sales agreement (GSA) signed in 2005, has begun supplying Qatari natural
gas to Oman via pipeline.
“This is a historic moment for Dolphin Energy; it is equally
significant for three nations [which] have embraced and supported
the Dolphin Gas Project from the very beginning,” said Dolphin
Chief Executive Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, referring to Qatar, the UAE,
and Oman.
The gas is produced from Dolphin’s production wells off Qatar,
processed at the Ras Laffan gas plant, and shipped through a 48-in.,
3.2 bcfd capacity pipeline to the UAE emirate of Abu Dhabi.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

From Abu Dhabi, the gas is shipped along Dolphin’s Eastern Gas
Distribution System to Al Ain in Fujairah, where the line connects
to a new Omani pipeline at the Oman border. Oman will be receiving 200 MMscfd of gas under the terms of its GSA with Dolphin.
In addition to Oman, other long-term customers for Dolphin
gas from Qatar include Abu Dhabi Water & Electricity Authority,
Union Water & Electricity Authority, and Dubai Supply Authority.
Each has signed a 25-year gas supply agreement with Dolphin Energy.
Mubadala Development Co., run by the government of Abu
Dhabi, owns 51% of Dolphin, while Total SA and Occidental Petroleum share equally in the remaining 49%.

BGTT lets pre-FEED contracts for marine facilities
BG Trinidad & Tobago (BGTT) has let two contracts valued at
$1.2 million to KBR consulting subsidiary Granherne certain preFEED (front-end engineering and design) studies.
Under the first pre-FEED study, Granherne will undertake study
work for provision of compression to BGTT North Coast Marine
Area facilities that deliver gas to Atlantic LNG. The concept phase
will examine both offshore and onshore solutions and a final solution will be selected during the pre-FEED phase.
The second study includes reviews of the facilities at BGTT’s
East Coast Marine Area onshore gas plant at Beachfield, including a
review of the arriving offshore pipeline and onshore reception facilities. The study includes design for operational upgrades as well
as enhancements to the facility that will help BGTT meet future
demand. Work is expected to begin immediately.
In September, BG Group said it intended to obtain initial gas
output from its Poinsettia platform in Trinidad and Tobago’s North
Coast Marine Area by yearend.
The Poinsettia field is anticipated to boost its gas output by 9.91
million cu m/day. In 2007, BG produced 23 million boe of gas in
the country. ✦

Recycling and ingenuity are not new
concepts in the oil and gas industry.
A ranch in the Texas Hill Country is
known for the unique oil field-pipe
construction of buildings from the
1930s and 1940s, engendered by
thriftiness during the Great Depression.
Daniel James Moran became president of Marland Oil Co. in 1928 and
oversaw the merger with Continental
Oil & Transportation Co. in
1929.
Moran “shepherded the
company [Continental Oil
Co.] through the worst days of
the depression…reduced the
company’s debt, and reintroduced habits of frugality and
careful management.”1
In June 1936, Moran
bought nearly 7,000 acres
along the north fork of the
Guadalupe River in Kerr
County, Tex., which he named
“Mo-Ranch.”
He called up a Conoco
construction crew and used old pipe,
sucker rods, and steel from scrapped
derricks and local limestone as building materials to develop this family
ranch and company retreat. Some of
the pipe is easy to spot in bridges and
roof supports, but most provides hidden structural support in buildings or,
buried throughout the property, carries

The nearby “kittywalk” bridge is 83

Apr. 3, 1948, his family put
the property on the market.
In June 1949, the Presbyterian Synod of Texas
purchased it for $512,500.
It sold 6,500 acres of unimproved ranchland to the
Texas Game and Fish Commission; that
land eventually became the Kerr Wildlife Management Area.
Mo-Ranch now operates as a conference facility on about 500 acres,

A looming political ﬁght
The interlude between presidencies, twilight
of the 110th Congress, is the time to practice diplomacy, the time to praise cooperation, the time
to voice hope for bipartisan policy-making. But
the US oil and gas industry must not delude itself.
From the Democratic presidency of Barack Obama
and strongly Democratic 111th Congress, it faces
an historic fight.
Any doubt that this is so should have vanished
when Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) deposed
John Dingell of Michigan as chairman of the
House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Dingell has never been a fan of the oil and gas business. But he would listen to its positions on issues
and sometimes compromise. Nothing in Waxman’s
background indicates that the chairman of the
House Committee on Oversight and Government
Reform, representing ultraliberal Beverly Hills, will
be that hospitable. He’ll more likely be downright
combative in service to House leadership that has
shown abysmal knowledge about energy and even
less willingness to learn.

While asserting realism in the national energy
discussion, the industry should frame its policy arguments within the interests of consumers. Energy
mistakes hurt consumers, who also are taxpayers.
Here, the industry has reason for optimism.
Congress allowed moratoriums on federal offshore leasing to expire in September after voters
expressed support for drilling. Painfully high oil
prices highlighted the need for increased supply,
and Americans apparently came to see the link
between supply and drilling. This is an important
breakthrough. The industry should develop the
insight, never forgetting that it originates in the
interests of people rightly resistant to excessive
energy cost.
A related strategy is to counter the antioil
prejudice that underlies US policy-making. For
environmental extremists, rejection of hydrocarbon energy is a deliberate goal. For others concerned about energy, it’s an unconscious yearning
attached to futile hopes for energy independence
and supply somehow free of cost and environmental consequence.
Troublesome Senate
The countervailing reality is that oil, gas, and

Safety improvements aimed at better
protecting both the environment and
employees were key topics for major oil
companies that issued 2007 sustainability reports or corporate social responsibility reports.
The lengthy, nonfinancial disclosures focus on what the companies call
responsible energy development while
the world faces increasingly difficult energy choices
and concerns
about climate
change.
In these
reports,
companies
outlined both
achievements and disappointments.
Content of the reports vary considerably among companies and also among
countries. The following summaries
show the variety of information oil
companies reported.

largest oil spill so far on the Norwegian
continental shelf.
Some 27,500 bbl (4,400 cu m) of
crude oil leaked from the Statfjord A
platform while a shuttle tanker was
loading from the platform. The company’s sustainability report said 2007 oil
spills tallied 4,989 cu m total, up from
181 cu m in 2006.
A subsequent investigation showed

BP invested $6 billion in 2007 to
review its assets and minimize the risk
of major incidents. It also worked to
strengthen its process safety management and to enhance the skills of operational staffers from executives to plant
employees, the report said.
The company is making “substantial progress” in changing culture,
becoming less bureaucratic, reducing
complexity, and simplifying activities,
concluded L. Duane Wilson, an independent expert hired to monitor BP’s
progress on implementing recommendations to improve its process safety
standards (OGJ, Sept. 8, 2008, p. 20).
Regarding midstream and upstream
operational integrity, BP spent more
than $250 million in Alaska to upgrade
or replace pipelines, increase corrosion

preventative maintenance and repairs, as
well as to expand capacity and improve
efficiency.
BP replaced sections of oil transit lines in Prudhoe Bay field during

ExxonMobil conducts internal
research and also works with universities and other companies to develop
technologies aimed at cutting GHG

High environmental standards are a
goal, particularly when operating in areas without local standards. ExxonMobil
Development Co. developed standards
for nitrogen oxides emissions, offshore

Reduction of hydrocarbon flaring is
a priority.
ExxonMobil—a member of the
World Bank’s Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership—flared 8.1 million
tonnes total worldwide last year, up
from 7.7 million tonnes in 2006.
“Our operations in Nigeria continue to be the largest source of flaring among our operations globally,”
ExxonMobil said. “To eliminate routine
gas flaring in Nigeria, we are investing
more than $4 billion in gas utilization
and commercialization projects.”
Downstream, ExxonMobil’s refineries

UK oil industry reﬂects on Piper Alpha lessons
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
What safety lessons has the UK
North Sea oil industry learned as it
reﬂects on the 20th anniversary of the
Piper Alpha disaster?
On July 6, 1988, 167 people died in
an explosion and ﬁreball on the Piper
Alpha oil platform due to a gas-condensate leak from pipework connected
to a condensate pump (OGJ, July 11,
1988, p. 20). The safety valve had been
removed for maintenance, the leak was
ignited, and an explosion and ﬁre followed; only 61 people survived.
As the industry strives to attract
young entrants, it is crucial to pass
on the safety lessons of this tragedy,
stressed Chris Allen, health, safety,
social, and environment director at UK
trade association Oil & Gas UK (OGUK).
“Safety is not just a company or
industry matter, but it is something for
every individual working offshore or
onshore,” Allen said.

Cullen report
The disaster prompted the Cullen
review of safety culture in the UK North
Sea, which was published in 1990, with
all stakeholders examining regulation, training, processes, and ways of
improvement.
Responsibility for offshore safety
was transferred from what was then
known as the government’s Department of Energy to the Health and

The major joined a broad-based coalition named the European Technology
Platform for Zero Emission Fossil Fuel
Power Plants (ZEP). ZEP wants to see

“There is no time to lose,” said the

Safety Executive (HSE). In addition,
major design changes were made to
offshore platforms; existing prescriptive legislation was replaced with goalsetting requirements, and a safety case
regime was established.
Recently unprecedented high oil
prices prolonged the use of aging platforms, and the ongoing trend of selling
assets to newcomers—some small and
without operating experience on the
UK Continental Shelf—requires different approaches to managing safety
risks.
Technological advances often mean
that little or no operational experience
is needed for managing ﬁelds.
Steve Jenkins, president of trade
body Oil & Gas Independents Association, told OGJ that safety had not
dropped as a priority.
“We have to be fully compliant with
regulations, and regular audits are carried out,” Jenkins said. Small operators
use bridging contracts with drilling
companies whereas the majors work
with them directly.

KP3 challenge
The number of fatalities fell to two
during April 2006-April 2007, and the
number of major injuries in the ﬁscal
year ended April 2008 was the lowest
since 1995.
However, although safety has improved over the years, much progress
is needed on UK platforms, according to the “Key Program 3” (KP3)

CCS adds more than 1 ppm to longterm global levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.” Shell executives urge governments to establish international policies
to lower GHG emissions without
distorting competition. For itself, Shell
set a 2010 target to keep GHG emissions from operations at a level that is at
least 5% below 1990 levels.
So far, Shell has reduced GHG emis-

report HSE published last November.
The body investigated the safety and
integrity of nearly 100 offshore installations and their equipment over a 3-year
period and concluded that more than
half of the oil and gas industry’s basic
assets were in poor condition.
“This report looked at management issues, and these are harder to
deal with,” said Ian Whewell, head of
HSE’s offshore division, in an interview
with OGJ. “Senior management had a
culture of ‘Give us solutions.’ People
wanted to know that everything was all
right. We have said that if you hear that
everything is all right then you should
be worried.”
Earlier this year, HSE shut down
three installations until operators could
rectify the problems.
But OGUK has contested some of
the ﬁndings in the report, arguing that
when it was published some data were
out of date. The industry is preparing
its feedback, and HSE will send a new
document to the secretary of state in
April 2009.
“We are hoping to see a detailed
analysis of the progress made since
KP3 was published,” Allen said.
The report concluded that greater
leadership, more good practice sharing, and improved worker involvement
are needed to reduce offshore risks.
But Jake Molloy, regional organizer of
OILC, the offshore trade union, warned
that employers are still intimidating
workers about voicing safety issues.
“Constructive dissent serves as
an important monitoring force within

1990 (see figure, p. 24).

IOGCC following CCS
initiatives, rulemaking
Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
The Interstate Oil & Gas Compact
Commission is closely monitoring
carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiatives by governments, research institutions, and the oil and gas industry.
Various speakers at the IOGCC’s
annual meeting Nov. 16-18 in Santa
Fe, NM, addressed the status of CCS
development efforts by federal, state,
and provincial governments in the US
and Canada.
CCS potentially offers one way to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions into
the atmosphere.
Separate from the IOGCC conference, US President-elect Barack Obama
said he wants to set stringent limits on
greenhouse gas emissions. His comments came in videotaped statements to
the Governor’s Global Climate Summit
in Los Angeles on Nov. 18.
CCS has yet to be implemented on a
large-scale, commercial basis anywhere
in the world. In the US and Canada,
existing federal, provincial, or state
legislation covers some aspects of CCS,
but various CO2 storage issues have yet
to be addressed.

Alberta’s CCS projects
At the IOGCC conference, a speaker
for the Alberta government said the
province is getting closer to selecting
CCS projects in which it plans to invest
$2 billion total.
Len Webber, Alberta’s parliamentary
assistant to the Minister of Energy, said
Alberta plans to invest in three to five

Webber said 50 submissions were
made under the EOI phase.
A short list of 20 companies was
selected, Webber said, adding that the
EOI phase identified the proposals
having the greatest chance of being
built quickly and providing the best
opportunities to greatly reduce GHG
emissions.
The next step requires the 20 successful EOI applicant companies to each
submit a full project proposal by April
2009, Webber said.
The full proposals are to outline
details for capture, transportation, and
storage of CO2.
“We do develop our resources responsibly.
“We will continue to take a responsible and resourceful approach,” Webber
said referring to criticism from some
groups that oil sands production results
in high [GHG] emissions.
Webber said oil sands are responsible
for 0.1% of GHG emissions.

Energy chairs
plan for 2009

T

he chairmen of two key congressional energy committees are
making plans for 2009. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), who leads the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee, and Nick J. Rahall (D-W.
Va.), who leads the House Natural
Resources Committee, separately
outlined their strategies.
“My immediate plans for the next
several weeks,” Bingaman said, “are
to reach out to and consider the ideas
of my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle, and on and off the committee,
as we prepare for the next Congress. Then, when the new Congress
convenes, I hope to put forward a
starting point for energy legislation
that will be both bold and broadly
supported,” he added in a Nov. 17
address at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
Rahall announced on Nov. 21:
“Issues relating to oil and gas development off the nation’s coastlines will
be front and center in the committee’s
agenda…as federal lands and waters
are critical to our energy supply and
our economy, producing approximately 25% of the nation’s domestically supplied oil and gas.” Equally
important, he continued, will be the
committee’s continued investigation
into federal oil and gas revenue collection procedures and practices.

Differing jurisdictions
The two chairmen described
different goals, as their committees
have jurisdiction over other areas
beyond energy. Both said they would
be working closely with the Obama
administration.
Bingaman listed main energy
challenges facing the next Congress:
30

deploying clean energy technology,
improving energy efficiency, maintaining adequate supplies of conventional fuels while the US transitions
to newer forms of energy, increasing
innovation, making energy markets
more transparent, and maintaining a
balance between energy and environmental policies, especially those
related to global climate change.
“Our energy strategy has to make
sure that we have adequate supplies of conventional fuels as we go
through that transition.” Bingaman
emphasized, “We need an intelligent
policy to continue to promote domestic production of oil and natural
gas, both onshore and offshore.”

Multiple use mandate
Rahall said his committee also
would examine the impact of global
climate change on land and water
resources. His committee will look
at the 1976 Federal Land Policy and
Management Act’s multiple use mandate because he said it has never fully
been realized.
“For too long, and particularly in
the last 8 years, development of our
public lands has trumped all other
facets of what was envisioned as a
broad, balanced [US Bureau of Land
Management] mandate,” he said.
The two chairmen also emphasized different aspects of controlling
carbon. Rahall said his committee
will consider ways to implement
carbon capture and sequestration
because it is the key technology that
will allow continued use of US coal
resources. Bingaman said his committee also might look at technologies that could be used under a capand-trade system. ✦

Twenty major US ﬁelds
Ruder noted that there are about 20
major shale fields across the US that
have the potential to or are currently
producing gas, including the Bakken
play in North and South Dakota, the
Woodford in eastern Oklahoma, the
Haynesville in East Texas and Louisiana,
and the Green River Piceance basin play
in Colorado.
“Shale developments are highly
capital intensive, and a windfall profit
tax assessment now being discussed in
Congress would directly and adversely
affect production,” Ruder warned.
Another NGSA member, Clay Bretches, vice-president, minerals and marketing, at Anadarko Petroleum Corp.,
expressed similar concerns. “I cannot
emphasize enough the importance of
a stable regulatory environment. When
exploration and production companies
expend billions of dollars on capital
projects, they can mitigate some of the
risks stemming from price fluctuations,
resource requirements, and transportation constraints.
“But in absence of a transparent and
consistent regulatory environment,
these projects may be delayed or, worse
yet, never get off the drawing board,”
he said.
“What we need is regulatory certainty that not only benefits the economics of the projects, but also provides adequate and on-time supply to
consumers.
“Make no mistake about it, regulatory uncertainty strongly impacts price
volatility,” Bretches said.
Ruder said shale developments have
the potential to reshape the traditional
domestic gas supply mix and aid in the

production.
“Industry has proven it can develop

MMS reports record disbursals during ﬁscal 2008
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US Minerals Management Service disbursed a record $23.4 billion
to state, American Indian, and federal
accounts from onshore and offshore
energy production during fiscal 2008,
Interior Secretary Dirk A. Kempthorne
said on Nov. 20.
Disbursements from royalties, rents,
and bonuses from production on federal land shattered the fiscal 2007 total
of $11.6 billion and broke the previous
record of $12.8 billion established in
2006, he added.
“Particularly in today’s economic
environment, these revenues represent
an increasingly important source of
funding for many federal, state, and

tribal budgets,” Kempthorne said.
Funds disbursed to individual states and
tribes support projects ranging from
infrastructure improvements and capital
works to funding for education, he
noted.
Kempthorne attributed the record
disbursements to higher energy prices
during the 12 months ended Sept. 30,
2008, and the more than $10 billion
in bonus bids paid by companies to
lease tracts in the Gulf of Mexico and
offshore Alaska as well as from onshore
lease sales.
As part of the total, a record $2.59
billion was distributed to 35 states as
their share of federal revenue collected
from energy production within their
borders; $17.3 billion went to the US
Treasury, and $534 million went to 34

Indian tribes and 30,000 individual
Indian owners, MMS said.
Wyoming led the states receiving
payments at more than $1.27 billion,
followed by Colorado at nearly $178.38
million, Utah at nearly $173.84 million, and California at nearly $103.45
million, the agency indicated.
American Petroleum Institute President Jack N. Gerard said the record payments demonstrate the importance of
domestic oil and gas production to the
US economy. “These revenues are only a
fraction of the economic benefits states
receive from oil and gas development.
This development also provides wellpaying jobs and a big boost to the local
economies in the form of increased
retail sales and other business opportunities,” he observed.

Dubai, London negotiations
Adam went on to say that these
negotiations were being held through
Dubai (the headquarters of the company that owns the tanker) and London
(the headquarters of the company that
insures the tanker).
He stressed that the hijackers receive
their ransom payments only in cash and
denied they have any bank accounts
abroad. “We do not have accounts
abroad. Most of us did not leave the sea
in the first place,” he said.
He pointed out that they share the
sums they receive as ransom for releasing the ships, and that they also distribute part of money among the poor
families in the region.
Adam said the number of the
tanker’s hijackers was more than 40 Somalis and that some 25 of them are still
aboard it now, adding that the original
hijackers were replaced by others on
Nov. 19.
On the conditions of the Saudi tanker’s crew, he pointed out that they were
safe and free on its deck and moving
inside it, adding that they were eating
from the vessel’s supplies.

Hijackers ‘love’ Saudi Arabia
He mentioned that the kidnappers’
ransom demand, which he refused to
specify, was not exaggerated, especially
as the tanker belongs to Saudi Arabia,
which, according to him, “they respect
very much and love because it is a Muslim country.”
He also underlined the need to
recover costs. “We had to bear many expenses to hijack it; $500,000 was paid
for information and expenses for the
people who hijack ships,” he said.
Though he did not set a time period
for ending the negotiations with the
tanker’s owners, he said in the past they
have handed back 10 ships belonging
to Asian countries, among them China
and Japan, whose owners paid ransoms
ranging between $1 million and $1.8

Lukoil’s
Repsol bid

S

panish officials are up in arms
to defend their nation’s oil and
gas industry from an invasion by
the Russians. Does that sound a little
dramatic? Read on.
Last week, Spain’s Interior Minister
said he would prefer that a company
other than Russia’s Lukoil buy builder
Sacyr Vallehermoso’s stake in Spanish oil group Repsol—and he didn’t
mince words.
“If you ask me if there is another
partner for Repsol I would prefer
than Lukoil, I would definitely find
one,” said Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba,
speaking on Spanish radio station
Onda Cero.
Isn’t it unusual for a country’s
interior minister to be consulted
on such a deal? In our experience, interior ministers are usually
concerned with matters of national
security.
If so, then you can see the kind of
concern generated in Spain over the
desire of Lukoil to buy into Repsol.
The purchase is perceived—in some
sense or another—as a threat to national security.

Sacyr Vallehermoso SA was in talks to
sell its 20% stake to Lukoil or another
company.
But the plot thickened when it
was learned that Lukoil also was in
talks with Repsol’s No. 2 stakeholder
Criteria CaixaCorp SA, the investment
arm of Spanish savings bank La Caixa,
said people close to the situation.

Lukoil could own Repsol

Criteria has a 9.1% direct stake
in Repsol, and about another 5%
via the investment vehicle Repinves
set up by La Caixa and savings bank
Caixa Catalunya. In a word, Lukoil
was poised to buy as much as 34.1%
of Repsol.
That percentage—or anything
around 30%—brought cries of concern when it was reported that under
Spanish takeover law, a shareholder
must launch an offer for the whole
company once it passes the 30%
threshold.
The main opposition Popular Party
(PP), which privatized Repsol in
1997 when it was in office, stepped
up its attacks on the government,

Adam disclosed that the pirates
benefit from information they receive
from their partners who support and
provide them with information from
other countries.

Hijackers’ international network
“We have countries that give us
information about the ships in the sea,
if there are commercial ships or sailing
in our way,” he said, adding that these
neighboring countries include Yemen,
Eritrea, Kenya, and South Africa.

Asked how they follow the ships, he
said, “We have radars and know every
ship’s location. We have collaborators in
Kenya, Sri Lanka, Yemen, and Dubai.”
He pointed out that these collaborators
have nothing to do with the money
“and they only provide us with the
information.”
Adam stressed that the pirates’
partners who are present in more than
one Arab, African, and Asian country raise the costs of their operating
expenditures in a single hijack, adding

that the cost of a hijacking might reach
$500,000.
Adam downplayed the dangers of
attacks on the pirates by the war fleets
of many countries in the region, among
them NATO, the US, and Russia, saying
these fleets were close to them and they
see them.
Talking about the American ships,
he said, “They cannot watch all the sea.
They have their own matters,” then
added that the pirates and passing Western ships exchange greetings when they
are sailing close to each other. ✦

Kurdish rebels blast Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline again
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Oil shipments along the KirkukCeyhan pipeline are set to resume
later this week following a Nov. 21
bomb attack on the line near Midyat
in the Mardin province in southeast
Turkey.
“Repairs have begun on the part
of the line affected by the explosion,”
said a Turkish energy ministry official.
“It still doesn’t work, and oil flow
has been stopped since the day of the
explosion.”
The official said, “It’s difficult to
give a date for flow to start but we’re
aiming for a week,” adding that oil
was still flowing through a line that
runs parallel to the affected link.
The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)
rebel group claimed responsibility
for the bomb attack, which triggered a large fire that stopped flow of
400,000 b/d of Iraqi crude along the
line.
Turkish authorities confirmed that
the blast appeared to be caused by
sabotage, although they said an investigation was ongoing.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry said exports
from the pipeline would be unaffected as there were about 6 million
bbl of Kirkuk crude already in storage
facilities in Ceyhan.

KRG wants export rights

DNO produces oil from Tawke
field, but the Norwegian firm has not
been granted a license to export it
due to what the central Iraqi government sees as an illegal contract it
signed with the KRG.
Shahristani met with officials in the
Kurdish city of Arbil for talks aimed at
resolving the disputes over contracts
KRG signed with international oil
companies (IOCs) on its own initiative.
Altogether, the Kurds signed nearly
20 production-sharing contracts with
IOCs after drafting their own oil and
gas law in August 2007.
Baghdad insists that such contracts,
which lack the imprimatur of the
central government, are illegal. But it
has been slow to approve a national
oil law that the Kurds say would grant
them more autonomy regarding
agreements with IOCs.
Meanwhile, Iraqi oil exports increased in October to an average of
1.7 million b/d, up from 1.64 million b/d in September.
October exports included 1.38 milBaghdad nixes KRG deals

coming days.”
The attack near Midyat, 80 km from
the Turkey-Iraq border, was the second
on the Turkish section of the pipeline
this month, following a bombing
Nov. 5, which shut down the line and
forced Turkish pipeline operator BOTAS
to undertake repairs (OGJ Online, Nov.
7, 2008).
According to analyst BMI, the PKK
attacks are likely to continue unless
there is a wider agreement allowing
the Kurdish Regional Government
(KRG) in northern Iraq to export via
the pipeline.
In that connection, Iraq’s oil minister and officials from the largely autonomous Kurdistan region agreed on
Nov. 24 to link two Kurdish oil fields
to the main northern export pipeline
to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
“Concerning this issue, we have
agreed to prepare and link the pipeline (from both fields) to the Iraqi
strategic pipeline,” said Iraqi oil minister Hussain Al Shahristani, referring
to the Shiwashuk and Tawke oil fields.

EAGC: Edison ofﬁcial stresses European gas diversity
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor

ered from the Caspian and Central Asia
beginning in 2013.

Enhancing diversity of gas supplies
is a key challenge for Europe, and the
Caspian could become an important
source, said an Edison SPA senior official at the European Autumn Gas Conference (EAGC) in Lake Como, Italy.
Riccardo Pasetto, executive vicepresident of corporate business development at Edison, said: “We want to
promote new gas from the Caspian; the
advantage of our position is small compared with [that of] Nabucco.”
Edison’s proposal is the IGI gas
pipeline that would import 8-10 billion
cu m/year of gas from the Caspian and
the Middle East areas through Turkey
to connect Italy and Greece. Deliveries
are expected to start in 2012. Edison is
working with the Greek company Depa
to build the 800-km long pipeline.
OMV AG is developing the 3,300-km
Nabucco gas pipeline, which is of
strategic importance for the European
Union. It has a planned capacity of 31
billion cu m/year of gas to be deliv-

Energy security sought
Currently Russia is one of the biggest
suppliers of natural gas to Europe, but
this reliance troubles European politicians as Russia increasingly uses energy
to shape its foreign policy.
In 2007, Russia provided 27% of
Italy’s required 13.5 billion cu m of gas,
followed by Libya 11% and Norway
10%, according to Pasetto. However the
IGI pipeline in 2015 will supply 27% of
the 24 billion cu m required, with Qatar providing 26%, Algeria 17%, Libya
17%, and Russia 17%.
“Russia and North Africa will remain
the main suppliers to Europe, providing 35% of total demand,” Pasetto
said. “Russia’s—incremental supplies
of 30-60 billion cu m should be lower
than the additional capacity provided by
the projects under development.”
Pasetto said LNG supplies will be essential to meeting future European gas
demand, but this could be subject to
arbitrages on the US and Asian markets.
Qatar’s role will be crucial, and Edison
is developing the 8 billion cu m/year

North Adriatic LNG regasification terminal in partnership with ExxonMobil
Corp. and Qatar Petroleum.
RasGas II has agreed to supply 6.4
billion cu m/year for 25 years. The remaining 20% of Adriatic’s capacity will
be available to third parties. The terminal is expected to become operational
next year.
Gas storage is another major priority for Edison to optimize on logistical
flexibility, and the company is developing 1.6 billion cu m of working
gas storage capacity by 2013-14. Gas
storage would provide regular returns,
and the authorities are still considering
exempting Edison from offering access
to third parties under European Union’s
rules.
The project will cost €550 million,
of which €230 million is for the facilities and €320 million is for the cushion
gas. In 2006-07, Edison provided 0.2
billion cu m of total gas capacity, but it
expects this to rise to 2.2. billion cu m
by 2013-14.
Edison plans to increase its share of
equity gas in its portfolio by 15%, concentrating on exploration and acquisition, Pasetto added. ✦

Mexico will account for 26.1% of
Latin America’s regional oil demand by
2012 while providing 28.34% of supply, according to a recent analyst report.
Latin American regional oil use,
which stood at 6.66 million b/d in
2001 and reached 7.47 million b/d in
2007, should average 7.59 million b/d
in 2008 and then rise to around 8.23
million b/d by 2012, said Business
Monitor International’s
Mexico Oil & Gas Report.
In terms of natural
gas, Latin America consumed 183 billion cu
m (bcm) in 2007 with
demand of 254 bcm
targeted for 2012, representing a 39%
growth.
Production of 196 bcm in 2007
should reach 279 bcm in 2012, and
implies 25 bcm of net exports by the
end of the period, BMI said.
In 2007, Mexico consumed 29.52%
of the region’s gas, with its market
share for 2012 forecast at 29.33%. In
2007, Mexico produced 23.52% of
the region’s gas, and is expected to be
contributing 20.08% by 2012.

Mexican real GDP growth is now
forecast by BMI at 2.9% for 2008, down
from 3.3% in 2007.
“We are assuming 3.4% growth in
2009, 3.5% in 2010, followed by 3.9%
in 2011, and 3.7% in 2012,” the analyst
said.
“Unless the government introduces a
radical shift in energy policy, we expect
state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos to
retain full responsibility for oil production, without international oil company
involvement,” it said.
BMI is assuming oil and gas liquids production of no more than 3.18
million b/d by 2012. Consumption is
forecast to increase by less than 2%/
year to 2012, implying demand of 2.15
million b/d by the end of the forecast
period.

OPEC basket price

Gas up, oil down

In the second quarter of 2008, BMI
estimates that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries’ basket
price averaged just under $115/bbl, up
24% from the first quarter 2008 level.
The OPEC basket price had exceeded
$127/bbl on May 22, slipping back
towards $121/bbl later in the month.
In June, BMI assumed an average of
around $120/bbl, to deliver its quarterly estimate of $114.98/bbl.
The estimated second quarter 2008
average prices for the main marker
blends are now $118.63/bbl for Brent,
$119.61/bbl for West Texas Intermediate, and $115.89/bbl for Russian Urals
(Mediterranean delivery).
BMI said its projections for 2008 as a
whole have been revised upwards from
the last quarterly report.
“We are now assuming an OPEC bas-

The export capability would therefore be 1.03 million b/d by 2012, it
said.
Gas production is forecast to increase
from 46 bcm in 2007 to 56 bcm over
the period, with 19 bcm of net imports
required by 2012.
Between 2007 and 2018, BMI is
forecasting a decrease in Mexican oil
production of 9.4%, with crude volumes falling steadily to a low point of
3 million b/d in 2015, before recovering somewhat at the end of the 10-year
forecast period.
Oil consumption between 2007 and
2018 is set to increase by 19%, with
growth slowing to an assumed 2%/
year towards the end of the period and

Beach to share in Gulf of Suez development
Beach Petroleum NL, Adelaide, has
received ministerial approval to acquire
from Tri-Ocean Energy a 20% interest
in the North Shadwan oil concession in
the Gulf of Suez.
Beach will pay $110 million for the
share, and Tri-Ocean will retain a 30%
interest.
BP Exploration (Delta) is operator of
North Shadwan, which contains three
undeveloped oil discoveries along with
several attractive exploration prospects.
The government also approved development of the field. First production
is scheduled for 2009. Appraisal drilling
is under way on the NS394-1A Burtocal discovery well, which found oil in
late 2007 when it penetrated a thick oil
column in the regionally prolific Nubia
formation reservoir.

Burtocal-2 is testing separate fault
compartments in the structure and will
assist in determining potential reserves
leading to a selection of development
options.
Beach also received ministerial approval to acquire from operator Santos
Egypt a 20% interest in the South East
July concession, also located in the Gulf
of Suez.
The first well (South July-1) will be
drilled in December about 10 km west
of Saqqara oil field.
The well targets potential recovery
up to 100 million bbl in stacked reservoir sands in the Miocene and Nubia
formations. July, Ramadan, and Morgan
fields are nearby.
Santos will retain 40%, and Dana Petroleum has the other 40% interest. ✦

MMS takes ﬁrst steps for leasing process off Virginia
The US Minerals Management
Service has taken the first step in the
multiyear leasing process to hold a sale
for acreage off Virginia.
The call for information and interest (CII) and nominations and notice
of intent (NOI) to prepare an environmental impact statement published in
the Federal Register, beginning a 45-day
public comment period that ends in late
December, MMS said.
“The purpose of the CII and NOI is
to gather information to use for planning and analysis and does not indicate
a preliminary decision to hold a lease
sale,” MMS said, adding, “The final decision will be made at a later date only
if the sale is in compliance with applicable laws including all requirements of
the [Outer Continental Shelf] Lands Act
and the National Environmental Policy
Act.”
MMS Director Randall Luthi said, “At
the request of [Virginia Gov. Timothy

M. Kaine], MMS included the area
offshore Virginia based on the Commonwealth’s current energy policy and
continued interest in knowing what
resources may be off its coastline.”
The sale, referred to as Lease Sale
220, is proposed to be held in 2011,
MMS said.
The area off Virginia was initially included in the OCS Oil and Gas Leasing
Program: 2007-12 but leasing was prohibited due to an executive withdrawal
and a Congressional moratorium. In
July, President George W. Bush lifted
the withdrawal and the Congressional
moratoria expired on Sept. 30. Both of
these actions allowed the option of the
special interest lease sale.
Luthi noted that an environmental
impact study (EIS) will evaluate environmental resources and potential
impacts in this part of the mid-Atlantic—an area that has not held a lease
sale since 1983.

“Throughout the scoping process for
the EIS, federal, state, and local governmental agencies, along with all other
interested parties, have the opportunity
to aid MMS in determining the significant issues and alternatives for analysis in the EIS we are preparing under
NEPA,” Luthi said.
Currently, the area offshore Virginia
being considered for leasing includes
a 50-mile buffer and a no-obstruction
zone from the mouth of the Chesapeake
Bay, as requested by the governor. As
with any sale, the public will have multiple opportunities for input into the
sale process.

API response
The American Petroleum Institute
reported that it “welcomed” government
work on leasing off Virginia. API Pres.
and Chief Executive Officer Jack Gerard
said, “The American public has made
clear its strong support for increased access to untapped domestic oil and natural gas resources; a full 70% of Virginians
in July supported increased access.”
Gerard said, “The industry stands
ready to help put America’s vast energy
resources to good use to strengthen our
nation’s economy and energy security,
generate billions of dollars for the benefit of our federal and state treasuries,
and provide good jobs for Americans
across the country.”
He said, “The industry has proven it
can develop these resources in an environmentally safe manner. With energy
consumption expected to grow in the
coming decades, America needs access
to its untapped domestic resources. Beginning the process of leasing offshore
Virginia is a good start.” ✦

ment’s plan to develop hydrocarbon
prospects in the region.
The agreement calls for Scan Geophysical to shoot about 10,000 km of
2D marine acquisition in waters along
most of the Ecuadorian coast, focusing on basins in Esmeraldas, Manabi,
Guayas, and Santa Elena provinces. The
agreement is subject to the parties finalizing a mutually agreeable contract.
The seismic program will be acquired utilizing Scan Geophysical’s new,
technologically advanced vessel and
onboard seismic equipment, including
8,000 m towed solid streamer.
Amistad gas field off the southwestern coast is Ecuador’s only Pacific offshore production, but several operators
have drilled discoveries and established
production to the south off Peru’s
northwest coast.
Scan Geophysical also reported receipt of a contract from GX Technology
(GXT) a subsidiary of Ion Geophysical,
Oslo, to acquire as much as 8,000 km
of long offset 2D data off Argentina,
part of which will be used to complete
GXT’s ArgentineSpan program. The two
companies agreed to mobilize Scan
Geophysical’s high-capacity 2D vessel
MV Geo Searcher. Data acquisition is
scheduled to begin immediately upon
the vessel’s arrival in Argentina. ✦

Australia
Eastern Star Gas and Gastar Exploration Ltd. reported an independently

in the Bohena project area of PEL 238
rose to 336 bcf at Sept. 30, 2008, from
185 bcf on Dec. 31, 2007.
The increase is based on results
from the first four core holes in the
Dewhurst area, which show that the

other core holes and production pilot
wells, including Edgeroi northeast of
Bibblewindi, are included.
The first of four multilateral horizontal production projects is to spud in
November, and commercial gas sales to
the Wilga Park power station are to start
by early spring 2009.

Mauritania
Affiliates of Malaysia’s Petronas cut
gas and oil columns at the Banda East1B appraisal well in the Atlantic off
Mauritania.
Wireline logging indicated that the

Offshore drilling contractor Hercules Offshore
Inc., Houston, has developed and implemented
a predictive accidentDrilling
prevention program to
maintain safety standards
and protect workers and the environment.
Hercules Offshore has improved
its health, safety, and environmental
management with an HSE dashboard
solution.
John T. Rynd, chief executive officer
and president of Hercules Offshore,
observes in the company’s health, safety,
and environmental policy statement that
“HSE is not managed by good luck.”1
Hercules started operations in 2005
with five rigs, acquired several companies, and merged with TODCO in July
2007 after the latter was spun off by
Transocean Inc. (early 2004). Rick McClaine, vice-president-HSE at Hercules

Harmonizing systems
When the implementation team
started thinking through this effort on
employing the new software version,
it realized that this endeavor provided
an opportunity to harmonize not only
the permit-to-work system, but also all
other safe-work systems used across all
offshore facilities.
The team realized that even though
all facilities used the same electronic
permit-to-work system, there were
some notable differences in other safety
practices, such as “lock-out-tag-out”

and some task risk assessment procedures. This was an opportunity to look
at best practices across all assets and get
everyone to standardize on a uniform
set of best safety practices and procedures.
Of course, the facilities have some
differences. Some are small and some
are very large. There are different operations being conducted on each one
and there are significant differences in
some of the equipment on the different
platforms. There were reasons, therefore, for different operational processes
but not for different control of work
procedures.
The implementation team knew that

the apparent differences and normal
human aversion to change would result
in some understandable resistance to
change when people anticipated having
to adopt something different from what
they were doing.
With some facilitation assistance
and additional information about best
practices from the Petrotechnics team,
BP assembled representatives from all
Gulf of Mexico facilities in one room
and moved forward with the task. The
people were carefully selected so that
they represented a variety of levels and
disciplines within the Gulf of Mexico
organization.

of the different crafts involved in the
maintenance, repair, and other work
done on production platforms. This
group chose the team name HEAT (harmonization essentials action team).
After some initial disagreements, the
team identified and integrated major
elements required for harmonization.
These included but were not limited to:
• Hazard identification.
• Risk assessment.
• Lockout tag out (LOTO).
• Safe isolation and return to process.
• Management of change.
• Safety awareness.
• Safe practices manual.
Through the process, everyone came
to understand that each was committed
to safe-work execution and wanted to
identify and adopt the “best of the best”
in terms of safe-work practices.
In hindsight, proper attention to the
membership and work of the HEAT
team was a key for success. The HEAT
team members proved to be some of
44

the best ambassadors for implementing the Sentinel PRO system upgrade
in a rigorous and disciplined manner.
Their advocacy and support during the
harmonization and implementation
process did much to reduce resistance
to change and facilitate rapid acceptance
of the new system.
Everyone saw the advantages and
efficiencies of having one set of the best
possible safe-work practices in place
uniformly across all platforms. The
Sentinel PRO eptw system provided a
vehicle for ensuring, and reinforcing—
every day, task by task—that every
single task was reviewed, planned,
evaluated, authorized, approved, executed, and closed out in accordance
with a single set of safe-work standards
and procedures.
When the HEAT kickoff meeting was
held in September 2007, the team took
on the challenge of harmonization in
order to:
• Leverage current best practices.
• Achieve the greatest possible har-

monization and uniformity across all
Gulf of Mexico assets.
• Support the BP worldwide control
of work standard.
• Move toward industry best practices.
• Establish a base line and a process
for continuing improvement.
Harmonization has several other
advantages in terms of BP people moving from one platform to another and
experiencing consistent practices at all
facilities. It also helps the contractors
who work on several different deepwater facilities because there is now much
more uniformity in the way all facilities
ensure that work is conducted safely.
The effort has reduced the need to learn
multiple different processes.
Parallel and linked to the work of the
HEAT team, Petrotechnics configured
its Sentinel PRO software in accordance
with the harmonized processes and
practices. Once all of the harmonization
work was completed, it was time to
install the upgraded Sentinel PRO softOil & Gas Journal / Dec. 1, 2008

Air emissions

Most of the states are adopting EPA’s
historical position by continuing to
allow reporting of unpredictable types
of MSS emissions (i.e., malfunctions) as
excess emissions and are beginning to
authorize the predictable type of MSS
activities through NSR permitting. Some
of the states requiring MSS emissions to
be included in air quality permits are

facilities, including Texas, Louisiana, and

MSS
Since states have some discretion
in how they structure their air quality
permitting requirements, one state can
have somewhat different requirements
for MSS emissions than another state
does.
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has considered
requiring facilities to obtain authorization for unplanned but quantifiable and
anticipated (QUAN) emissions, such as

those from pressure-relief valves. When
TCEQ promulgated its MSS permitting
rules that are currently being implemented, however, it elected not to
include any requirements to authorize
QUAN emissions.
Thus, in Texas, only scheduled MSS
activity emissions, which are a predictable type of MSS activities, can now be
authorized through TCEQ’s NSR program. Since “unplanned” MSS emissions
are not authorized, those unplanned

(Fig. 2). The emissions of HAPs normalized for crude inputs decreased 50%, to
18.1 million lb.
EPA’s report also assigned a riskscreening environmental indicator to
each TRI chemical to consider the relative toxicity of air emissions.
The normalized toxicity score for
US reﬁners increased by 50% during
1996-2005.
The toxicity score increased mainly
due to sulfuric acid, which has a relatively high weighting compared with
other TRI chemicals and is related to
SO2 emissions. Sulfuric acid accounted
for about three quarters of the 2005
toxicity score.
Ammonia was the most emitted
chemical in 2005, accounting for 8.574
million lb. Sulfuric acid was the next
highest-ranked chemical with 8.015 million lb emitted in 2005.

Greenhouse gases
The report stated that, in terms of
methane emissions, US reﬁners released an estimated 28.4 million tonnes
of CO2 equivalent in 2005. This was an
increase of 7% since 1996.
Vented emissions accounted for 87%
of greenhouse gas emissions. Fugitive
and combustion emissions accounted
for 6% and 7% of emissions, respectively.

Water discharges
The EPA report stated that in 2005,
121 US reﬁneries reported water discharges of 17.7 million lb of TRI chemi-

QUAN emissions will continue to be
covered by rules addressing unauthorized emissions under the excess emissions reporting program.
Meanwhile, the New Mexico Environmental Department (NMED) is still
considering whether to require facilities to obtain authorization for emissions from anticipated but unplanned
activities, which would be similar to
the QUAN emissions that TCEQ considered. As can be seen in this example, the

cals. This amount was an absolute
increase of 52% compared with 1996
and a normalized increase of 42%.
Nitrate compounds and ammonia
accounted for 97% of the reported
discharges.

Waste management
According to the report, reﬁners
reported generating 5.1 million tons of
hazardous waste in 2005. The hazardous-waste management method that
reﬁners used most was disposal, which
accounted for 84% of wastes managed.
In 2005, reﬁneries reported 1 billion
lb of chemicals released, disposed, or
managed through treatment, energy
recovery, or recycling. This was a 22%
decrease in waste managed compared
with 1996, when normalized by crude
inputs.
In 2005, 54% of managed waste was
treated, 23% was recovered for energy
use, 17% was recycled, and 6% of
TRI-reported waste was disposed or released. Energy recovery was the main
waste management method in the late
1990s; treatment, however, is now the
primary management method.
Reﬁners reported disposing of 6.3
million lb of TRI chemicals to land or
transferred to offsite locations for disposal in 2005. Ammonia, zinc, and nickel accounted for nearly half of the total
weight of chemicals disposed. Most
reﬁnery TRI hazardous waste disposals

43% relied upon landﬁll disposal.

types of emissions that a state agency
deems subject to permitting vary
among states; individual state requirements must be consulted.

MSS permitting: obstacles,
concerns
As a part of NSR, many states require
state best available control technology
(BACT) to be applied to any emission
sources that are included in air quality authorizations. While state BACT

requirements may not be as stringent
as BACT requirements related to the US
“Prevention of Significant Deterioration” (PSD) BACT requirements (discussed presently), state BACT can still
result in additional control technologies
being required for maintenance activities (and also start-up and shutdown
emissions).
Besides the additional cost to implement BACT requirements, there can
also be additional labor requirements,
depending on what additional steps
would be required to minimize emissions during MSS events. Additional staff
time will be required for documenting
compliance with the air permit requirements related to MSS emissions and
emissions reduction efforts.
One obstacle for obtaining a permit
for MSS air emissions can be documenting, through air-dispersion modeling,
that the proposed emissions do not
cause a violation of ambient air quality standards. Permits cannot be issued
unless the emissions to be permitted
can be shown not to cause a violation
of ambient air quality standards such
as the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS) and state ambient
air standards, including state toxic air
pollutant standards.
Since many oil and gas facilities have
property lines near their air emission sources, off-site impacts could be
high for some MSS emissions. Even for
emission sources some distance from
property lines, the magnitude of MSS
emissions can cause problems with airdispersion modeling results.
These considerations can affect decisions about how to conduct MSS activities and whether additional operational
measures for emissions reductions
should take place. In some cases, a company may want to explore its options
to see what is feasible before it submits
information to the state agency. In light
of the potential permitting problems
for some current MSS activity methods,
some of the alternative methods of
conducting infrequent MSS activities
should be explored long before a permit application will be required.

We make a living by what we get;
we make a life by what we give.
– Winston Churchill
On September 13, 2008, the lives of
thousands on the Gulf Coast changed
forever. Hurricane Ike, a Category 2 storm,
crashed into the Gulf Coast, bringing floods,
fires, unimaginable winds, and widespread
damage. Thousands of people have lost homes,
and several dozen have lost their lives.

ISA would like to recognize the following
companies for their dedication and generosity
to the people of the Gulf Coast. Thanks to their
contributions and the contributions of attendees
at ISA EXPO 2008, we’ve donated $8,500 to
the American Red Cross’ Hurricane Ike Disaster

on the proposed New Mexico MSS

NMED to an emissions event root-cause

• Budget for the resources required
to meet MSS permitting requirements
and do not underestimate the effort required to show compliance with the air
dispersion modeling requirements.
• Budget for the increased cost of
maintenance activities due to potential
BACT requirements.
• Start early identifying MSS activities. A company’s environmental staff
may want to review past records besides
talking with operations and maintenance staff to develop a comprehensive
list of MSS activities for permitting
based on history and anticipated future
activities.
• Facilitate communication between
environmental staff members responsible for various sites (and various states).
• Evaluate MSS scenarios to determine which activities could happen
simultaneously and which would not.
Sometimes air-dispersion modeling
problems can be alleviated or reduced
by segregating emissions from activities
that would not occur simultaneously.
• Develop an MSS activities checklist if the company has several facilities
subject to MSS permitting requirements. The checklist can be simply on
paper to make sure that all MSS activities are identified, but an appropriately
designed checklist in a spreadsheet or
database format can be a productive
step toward developing the necessary
emissions calculations.

Deadlines
Deadlines for obtaining authorizations for MSS emissions vary by state
and the individual state regulations
should be consulted. Three states near
the top of the list in terms of oil and
gas production, however, are taking a
deliberate approach in addressing MSS
54

emissions through permit applications.
In Texas, the TCEQ has set deadlines
for facilities based on standard industrial classification (SIC).3 For oil and
gas facilities in SIC Codes 1311 (Crude
Petroleum and Natural Gas), 1321
(Natural Gas Liquids), 4612 (Crude
Petroleum Pipelines), 4613 (Refined
Petroleum Pipelines), 4922 (Natural
Gas Transmission), and 4923 (Natural
Gas Transmission and Distribution), the
deadline for submitting an air quality permit application or otherwise
obtaining authorization for MSS emissions is Jan. 5, 2012 (reference 30 TAC
101.222(h)).
Facilities in other SIC categories have
separate deadlines listed in the Texas
rules. With the TCEQ considering additional options for authorizing oil and
gas industry MSS emissions, now is a
good time for oil and gas companies to
be engaged with TCEQ on the direction
that will be taken in this evolving area
of air quality permitting.
The New Mexico Environmental
Department (NMED) is taking a slightly
different approach. The first deadline of
Jan. 27, 2009, applies to all facilities in
New Mexico, including all oil and gas
facilities.
By Jan. 27, all facilities are to revisit
what NMED calls start-up, shutdown,
and maintenance (SSM) emissions and
determine whether the facilities’ owners or operators will need to obtain
a permit or change permit status. If
a permitting action will be required,
the NMED must be notified by Jan. 27
that a permit change is indicated. The
agency will then “call” for permit applications based on their priorities.
The stance of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ)
is that routine MSS emissions should be
added to a facility’s air quality permit
at the earliest opportunity if those
emissions are not already in the facility’s permit. In fact, permit writers at
LDEQ are currently requesting information about MSS emissions during their
reviews of permit amendment and
renewal applications if the facilities do

not have MSS emissions already authorized.
In Louisiana, there is no specific
deadline for permitting MSS emissions,
but facilities can be subject to enforcement actions if they are found to have
unauthorized MSS emissions. Thus,
companies with facilities in Louisiana
should be evaluating their compliance
situation on MSS air emissions now.

Other states
As indicated by this sampling of
states, the requirements for MSS emissions vary by state. In some states, such
as Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana,
obtaining an air permit that includes
MSS emissions is mandatory, while in
other states it is voluntary.
For example, on a case-by-case basis,
the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality has allowed some facilities to include MSS activities in their
permits to avoid upset condition reporting for those MSS emissions.

Due diligence
This review should make clear how
important it is to check on the situation
in a particular state. MSS permitting
requirements are evolving, and some
states are currently amending their

with federal, state, and local regulatory agencies while preparing for the
project. Southern used two biomonitors
in successfully negotiating contentious
environmental issues and fully complying with specialized compliance conditions stemming from the regulatory and
permitting processes.
This article details the role of these
biomonitors.

Background
The Cypress project called for
construction of a 167-mile, 24-in. OD
pipeline from just east of Savannah, Ga.,
to west of Jacksonville, Fla., including five gas-delivery interconnects and
three compressor stations. Cypress is
a take-away pipeline from Southern’s
subsidiary, Southern LNG Inc., an operating LNG import and storage terminal
located in Savannah.
The selected pipeline route through
coastal Georgia and Florida contains
some of the most ecologically-sensitive
regions in the country. Cypress crossed
more than 300 wetlands; 40% of the
route (60 miles).
Cypress also crossed more than 200
water bodies; six more than 100 ft long
and requiring specialized construction
techniques.
The project area served as habitat
for more than 24 protected species, 13
of which were found along the project
route. Biological surveys conducted
before construction identified more
than 200 gopher tortoise burrows, for
example (Fig. 1). The project area also
contained several significant historical
sites and essential fish habitat for managed fisheries.

Agency consultation
Southern consulted with many different federal, state, and local agencies,
including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries
Service (NMFS), US Army Corps of

Biomonitors also removed venomous snakes, such as this eastern diamondback rattlesnake, and alligators from the right-of-way, protecting both the workers and
the animals (Figs. 2-3).
Engineers, Georgia Department of
Natural Resources, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the
Saint Johns River Water Management
District, and others. The environmental
resources identified along the Cypress
route required creative solutions to
the numerous (sometimes conflicting)
agency requests regarding avoiding or
minimizing environmental impact.
Southern conducted specialized
species surveys during preconstruction, relocated protected species, set
up exclusion fencing to keep protected
species from entering the construction
zones, and implemented various other
techniques and practices. Southern also
manipulated construction windows to
avoid foraging and nesting periods for
several protected bird species and withdrawing water for hydrostatic testing
during spawning events.
Trenchless technologies such as
horizontal directional drilling allowed
Southern to build underneath significant ecological habitats and historical
sites. As part of a specific condition

Southern used specially engineered hydrostatic test intake structures to reduce

these windows or work was completed
beforehand. They also reminded the
construction team which waterbodies
required specially engineered intake
structures during hydrostatic test withdrawals.
Biomonitors surveyed construction areas for sensitive environmental
resources before each phase of activity, fostering proactive communication with the construction crew before
environmental issues arose. The Cypress
construction team avoided several
protected species or rescued them from
harm’s way via this method. Biomonitor scouting also protected construction personnel from animals such as
venomous snakes (Fig. 2) and alligators
(Fig. 3).
The construction team occasionally needed additional workspaces,
contractor yards, or access roads. Such
unplanned alterations result in suddenly
scrambling through an agency variance
process, because environmental issues
are usually not in the front of the construction team’s thought process when
varying from the original plan.
During Cypress, however, biomonitors performed necessary biological
surveys and prepared construction variances for agency approval as changes
happened. Biomonitors also worked
directly with the agencies to manage
the variance processes in the event a
construction deviation was required.
Georgia and Florida have several
water-quality protection permits requiring state-certified personnel to monitor water quality, take water samples,
and prepare resulting reports. Cypress
biomonitors held certificates from
Georgia and Florida allowing them to
perform these tasks, and were crucial
in meeting state water quality requirements.
Biomonitors also acted as liaisons
during agency inspections, escorting
agency personnel during construction
audits. The biomonitors standing as
trained biologists already entrenched in
the construction process allowed them
to respond readily and articulately to
specific environmental issues related to
permit conditions. ✦

Oil conservation
starts before fuel
limits take effect
The problem with conservation as an
aim of energy policy is that its strongest
advocates wouldn’t know it if it stared them
in the face. It’s staring them in the face now.
Until Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, conservation represented half of any energy-policy initiative discussed in polite company.
The other half was renewable energy.
Suggestions that the government do

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

something on behalf of domestic supplies
of oil and gas, for example, always sprung
a rhetorical trap: What about conservation?
What about renewables?
EISA enshrined the preference for
conservation and renewable energy with
toughened vehicle fuel-economy standards and lavishly increased mandates for
biofuels.
Presto! Oil consumption is falling.
The American Petroleum Institute reported on Nov. 19 that total domestic petroleum
deliveries in October were down 4% from
their level of a year earlier. The year-to-date
decline in this important measure of oil
consumption was 5%. The 19.6 million b/d
consumption average for January-October
was the lowest since 2000. The year-to-date
rate of decline between this year and last
was the largest since the early 1980s.
January-October gasoline deliveries
were down 2.6% year to year.
This is conservation. This is what Congress wanted when it passed the EISA. The
law must be working.
Well, not exactly. Those new fuel-economy standards that make everybody feel
good about having acted on conservation
don’t take effect until 2011.
Conservation manifest in the API
numbers reﬂects market responses to high
prices and diminished economic activity.
It’s real conservation. People are using less
oil than they did last year.
But conservation advocates will have
trouble seeing it for what it is because the
consumption decline didn’t come about in
direct response to law or regulation.
It should hearten them to know that the
government contributed, nevertheless. Its
fuel mandates, for example, imposed inefﬁciencies that hamper the economy and thus
suppress oil consumption.
And it should delight conservation enthusiasts to know that, with US automakers
pleading for bailout as new fuel-economy
standards loom, and with strict climatechange legislation likely, more such recessionary goodness is on the way.

Market fears drive down prices
With the loss of public conﬁdence because of the current ﬁnancial crisis, world
demand for energy is still declining even as prices fall.
The Oct. 24 decision by ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to cut production by 1.5 million b/d effective Nov. 1 failed to halt the price
slide. Instead, the average price for OPEC’s basket of 13 crudes fell a further 25% Oct.
24-Nov. 17. OPEC ministers were to gather for consultations Nov. 29 at the meeting
of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries in Cairo. “But there is
little point in pledging new output cuts until those already agreed are implemented,”
said analysts at the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London.
In the interim, oil demand forecasts are being revised down and a year-on-year
contraction in global oil demand in 2008 and 2009 “is now a very real possibility for
the ﬁrst time for 25 years,” said CGES analysts.
“It took 40 months for oil prices to rise from $50/bbl to almost $150/bbl and just
4 months for them to fall back again,” they said. A series of “psychological” oil price
ﬂoors have crumbled since early July, and heady forecasts of oil prices above $200/
bbl before the end of the year “now belong to a different world,” CGES analysts
reported.
However, they said, “With people fearful for their jobs and income prospects,
a 25-30% fall in gasoline prices will not change their new driving habits.” Growing
demand for oil in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East can no longer offset the
continuing decline among member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, as demand for Asian-made goods falters and rampant oil
demand growth eases in oil-producing countries.
Paris-based International Energy Agency slashed its 2009 demand outlook by
670,000 b/d—the largest cut in 12 years—to 86.5 million b/d, or 0.3% growth, down
from its previous estimate of 8% growth. OPEC reduced its 2009 oil demand growth
forecast for the third consecutive month, down by 200,000 b/d to a growth of
500,000 b/d for total world demand for 86.68 million b/d in 2009.
CGES was even more pessimistic, however, suggesting that global oil demand
will fall in both 2008 and 2009. However, it expects declining demand to be offset
somewhat by the lack of growth in non-OPEC supplies. “OPEC’s call for support
from Russia, Mexico, and Norway in cutting production is already being delivered,
albeit involuntarily, with production falling year-on-year in all three countries,” CGES
analysts said.
“If prices fall far enough, it may be difﬁcult to cover the operating costs of the
most expensive non-OPEC production, Canada’s oil sands.” These costs may be no
higher than $30/bbl, “but will fall further as the cost of generating heat for the extraction process falls,” they said.
CGES analysts said a new ﬂoor price for oil “presumably lurks at the level at
which OPEC’s members are prepared to sacriﬁce potential sales and turn customers
away unfulﬁlled, or at which high-cost non-OPEC production begins to be shut in. Oil
prices will continue to fall until one of these breakpoints is reached.”
Among the incidents to watch, said CGES, are signs of a shut-down of oil-sands
production projects in Alberta and OPEC’s response to a deteriorating global economic situation and US President-elect Barack Obama.
Pirates slow supplies
On Nov. 15, pirates hijacked the Sirius Star, a very large crude carrier owned by
Saudi Aramco and operated by Vela International, 450 nautical miles off Kenya—the
farthest out to sea that modern pirates have ever struck. As company ofﬁcials negotiated to ransom the vessel with its crew of 25 and a cargo of 2 million bbl of oil, an
Indian warship attacked and sank a pirate “mother ship.” A multinational naval force
is patrolling waters between the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa where
pirates recently have become bolder and more violent.
Still, the AP Moller-Maersk Group, one of the biggest shipping companies with a
ﬂeet that includes tankers, plans to route its vessels beyond the Gulf of Aden waterway that the pirates have been raiding. Frontline Ltd. is considering doing the same
with its ﬂeet of VLCC tankers.
“If Frontline or other owners embark on the same deviation, it will not only increase voyage time and cost but will also result in a build up of stock at sea that will
need to be added to the demand equation,” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug,
Switzerland. “The longer supply line would also result in a lower stock security cover
for Europe.”

Telecommuting beneﬁts outweigh negatives

D

ear Reader,
How effective would you be in your job if you worked at home?
Some of us would see productivity gains; others would fare better in an office setting.
The high costs of transportation fuel has many companies reviewing their policies for flexible
working arrangements and telecommuting. And with good reason.
The Consumer Electronics Association conducted a study recently that found that telecommuting
has “terrific” potential for reducing US energy consumption. Presently, 3.9 million people in the US work
from home at least 1 day a week. With the average
commute put at 22 miles, this saves 840 million
Telecommuting at least part of the time
gallons of gasoline per year—but that’s against total
makes workers more productive and
US gasoline consumption of 146 billion gallons/year.
However, CEA also found that as many as 53
jobs…[a retention is probably the No. 1 staffing
happier at their jobs…[and]
million people could telecommute. Even at just 1
concern in the energy industry. So even if the energy savings and
day per week, that works out to an 8% reduction in
environmental benefits aren’t enough justification, that would be the annual gasoline use.
clincher in convincing management to be more flexible on the issue.
The study found that the current level of
telecommuting saves the equivalent energy of the
amount of electricity used by about 1 million US households each year. It also reduces carbon dioxide
emissions equivalent to removing 2 million vehicles from the road every year.
The CEA study took into account increased home-based carbon emissions resulting from
telecommuting and found that they were more than offset by the savings in gasoline consumption and,
in some cases, part of the energy consumption associated with commercial office space.
But if millions more workers started telecommuting 1 or more days per week, it would represent
a sea change in the American workplace. Concerns have been raised by management and staff alike
as to what widespread telecommuting would do to the workplace. Some managers remain concerned
about worker productivity and team interaction. Some workers worry about career prospects and the
intrusion of work into the home space.
A recent study by Penn State University revealed some interesting findings about the purportedly
negative aspects of telecommuting. The study found that, overall, it improved productivity, enhanced
morale, reduced conflicts between work and family, did not damage career prospects, and did not—if
limited to 1 or 2 days—harm workplace relationships.
The key finding of the study is that telecommuting gives employees a sense of freedom or greater
control over their work environment. From this the other benefits flow. There seems to be inherent
limits, however. According to the study, working from home more than 2 days a week, while still
benefiting the family, tended to have a negative effect on workplace relationships. And managers have
to adapt to this new workstyle; micromanagers will have the biggest challenge.
Still, the results of the study are clear: Telecommuting at least part of the time makes workers more
productive and happier at their jobs. As articles in this publication have shown, retention is probably
the No. 1 staffing concern in the energy industry. So even if the energy savings and environmental
benefits aren’t enough justification, that would be the clincher in convincing management to be more
flexible on the issue.
Sincerely,

Jamie Matlin,

SEG humanitarian initiative betters the world
as it enhances members’ careers

The Society of Exploration Geophysicists
Foundation has embarked on an ambitious
new program that deepens the foundation’s
involvement in humanitarian activity—and
by turn, SEG members’ commitment to giving
back to the world community.
Geoscientists Without Borders is designed to benefit
disadvantaged communities by funding projects that
apply geophysical and geoscience technologies to meeting
community needs. These humanitarian projects are
intended to create a brighter future for communities
in need while raising the profile of applied geoscience.
Universities and students will be heavily involved.

around 30 m depth—were mapped up to several
kilometers inland,” she said. “Based on the survey results,
recommendations were made to locate shallow, hand-dug
wells and medium-depth (60 m) water wells.”

Program details
Geoscientists Without Borders was largely the brainchild
of Craig Beasley, a Schlumberger executive who was SEG
president for 2004-2005 and who had exhorted his fellow
members to help the tsunami-devastated communities
of Asia with a call to action that “we have a significant
contribution to make as geophysicists.”
Schlumberger stepped up to launch Geoscientists Without
Borders with a funding commitment of $1 million in late 2007.

The seed for the program was planted in a response to the
horrific December 2004 Asian tsunami that killed more
than 230,000 people and displaced millions more.

The SEG Foundation program was launched in May 2008,
when the request for first-phase project proposals was
published and a July 2008 deadline set.

Geophysics played a role in helping recovery efforts of
local populations. For example, Germany’s BGR (Federal
Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources) conducted
a post-tsunami helicopter electromagnetic survey along
the coasts of Aceh, northern Sumatra, to discriminate
between fresh-water and saltwater aquifers, according to
Geoscientists Without Borders committee member Louise
Pellerin of Green Engineering Inc.

Program committee members have recommended the first two
projects for award, and those details were to be announced
after this publication’s presstime, at the foundation’s donor
luncheon at SEG’s annual meeting in Las Vegas in November.
The second round of first-phase proposals was due for
submissions in early October, and those recipients would be
announced in December 2008 or January 2009.

“Saltwater intrusion

Qualifying projects will be required to demonstrate
that they will deliver humanitarian and environmental
benefits through application of geophysical and geoscience
expertise. These benefits could include a wide range of
projects, such as locating fresh-water supplies, pollution
remediation, natural hazard detection, manmade hazard

“We are proud to be able to help establish a program that
will focus on humanitarian applications of geoscience and
inspire students to use their skills in the geosciences to
make the world a better place.”

mitigation, sustainable resource development, and related
education. Anyone interested in applying for grants or
offering their services as mentors should visit the SEG
website at http://www.seg.org/foundation.
SEG is the global professional organization dedicated
to advancing the science and technology of applied
geophysics. It serves more than 30,000 members
and student sections at 204 academic institutions
worldwide. Members are involved in oil and gas, mining,
environmental, and other industries and research efforts
that benefit from applied geophysics.

Beasley also acknowledges the benefits to the industry that
result from petroleum professionals “giving back”
“Certainly having visibility in helping people improves a
company’s image—for any type of company,” he said. “But
one of the most important aspects of the Geoscientists
Without Borders program is that it establishes links on
a global basis among professionals, their companies,
students, universities, and people in need. This direct,
person-to-person contact can have a large effect on
perceptions of the petroleum industry.”

The SEG Foundation is the society’s charitable organization
dedicated to advancing the mission of the society through
grant and award programs. The foundation provides
scholarship opportunities, travel grants, and funding for
field camp programs and other projects of merit made
available to student members worldwide, as well as global
education programs for practicing members.

Dalton Boutte, executive vice-president of Schlumberger
and president of WesternGeco, underscored the
Geoscientists Without Borders program goals in
announcing his company’s funding commitment to the
SEG Foundation: “When we looked at the technologies we
have developed in the oil and gas sector and the potential
benefits to humanitarian efforts, we were interested in
enabling these applications through interaction with the
academic community, students, and the SEG Foundation.

Program beneﬁts
Beasley, a vice-president of WesternGeco, a business
segment of Schlumberger, and chair of the SEG Foundation
Committee for Geoscientists Without Borders, concurs
with the view that volunteer and charity work enhances the
career of a petroleum professional.

“We are proud to be able to help establish a program that
will focus on humanitarian applications of geoscience and
inspire students to use their skills in the geosciences to
make the world a better place.”

“Like many people in the petroleum industry, I have
had the opportunity to travel extensively and experience
firsthand the poverty in underdeveloped parts of the world,”
he said. “I think it has an effect on all of us when we live
and work with people coming from these circumstances. So
it is gratifying to do something that can directly improve
the lives of people in need.”

Academia beneﬁted
Students and universities also benefit from the important
role they will play in the success of the program. Students
will benefit personally through the experience of planning
and executing such projects.

According to Gabriel Borges, outgoing 2007 president of
the SEG Student Section at the University of Oklahoma,
“The program represents a great opportunity for
geoscience students to provide an early contribution to
the professional community while building their technical

Ten tips for retaining the neXt generation
Justin G. Roy, SullivanKreiss

Generations X and Y will continue to challenge
us as firm owners and managers; they will test
the waters and will sometimes go overboard.
However, their style is here to stay, and trying to fit
them into the what-worked-before model will only cause
headaches
Of course, we all know there are fewer people in the next
generations, making it that much more important to focus
on recruiting and retaining them. How can a firm overhaul
its entire approach to employee recruiting and retention
when half their staff is still sold on and used to the old
way? Baby steps, that’s how.
Here are some tips to implement into your day-to-day
retention strategy.
• Encourage them to use online social networks.
Take the site-block off of MySpace and Facebook
and LinkedIn. These sites offer more than one would
think; besides a good way to blow off steam during the
day (we all need a 5-minute break), they offer much
more. As online social networking grows, these sites
become much larger hubs of information, which, when
used correctly, can benefit your firm. The sites allow
people to keep in touch and see what their friends
and connections are up to. Within a few minutes, you
could know who is looking to make a job change (great
recruiting strategy), who is relocating to your area, what
firms are hiring, etc.
• Flex time. The option to come in early and leave early
or come in late and leave later is very appealing to
these generations. Some are trying to balance a social
life, while others are trying to balance their family
life. Offering your employees the benefit of arriving at
work an hour early or later gives them the flexibility
to schedule “life issues” such as daycare, eldercare, or
doctor appointments. With this flexibility also comes a
great benefit to the employer; it allows the employee to
be in the office for a “full shift” rather than having to
take extra time off for an appointment.

8

• Flex ofﬁce. “If I can get it done, and get it done well,
why does it matter where I work?” From working at a
coffee shop to working from home, the technology age
has allowed us to be more mobile than ever. Put together
a laptop, cellular telephone, and an internet connection,
and you have an instant office. In fact, most people will
never know that you are not in the office (with calls
forwarded to the cell phone).
• Reward based on merit. More and more people
in the workforce do not believe in the old equation of
time put in = promotion. They look at their individual
contribution to the company and to the team as a metric
for promotion and merit rewards.
• Be a socially conscious organization.
“Sustainability” and “green” are the hot words today. The
younger generations are very interested in social and
environmental happenings, both through the media as
well as through their employer. Communicate what your
firm does to better society and benefit the environment.
If you come up empty-handed, ask your employees
to come up with a program. It can be as simple as
volunteering at a reading program, spending a day
rebuilding or renovating a house for somebody in your
community, planning ways to make your office “green.”
Get everybody involved, and you create emotional
equity, making it a bit more difficult for these folks to
leave your firm.
• Training. Offer opportunities for your staff to further
their knowledge, for work-related functions as well
as career-focused training. People are always excited
and interested in furthering their knowledge and see
it as a huge benefit when a firm offers these courses.
If you cannot afford to hold them at your office, send
candidates out to a training program for a day or two
out of the office; when they come back, ask them to
make a presentation to the rest of the company about
what they learned.
• Management style. Flat-line management is top
choice lately, and for a lot of good reasons. How
many times have you been on top of—or at the

• Spend time and mentor.
Make sure you spend time
with every employee, on a
project, by the water cooler,
or even at a one-on-one
lunch. These conversations
will help others understand
who and what management
is and will help you create a bond with your employees.
The same adage goes with being a manager as it does
with networking: If you do not know three things about
the other person that are not work-related, then you
need to rethink your style.

• iPod Friday. Quite a few firms have been banning the
use of iPods in the office, noting the loss of collaboration
opportunities between colleagues, loss of communication,
and missed mentoring opportunities that could have been
seized by simply listening to more experienced staff in

Allow your employees to bring in and wear their iPods

Strategies to Address the Problem of Exiting
Expertise in the Electric Power Industry
Dennis Ray, Power Systems Engineering Research Center
Bill Snyder, Quanta Technology
Fig. 1. The aging of the utility workforce

The coming mass exodus of expertise in technicians and
engineers in the electric power industry is a well-expected
phenomenon. The loss has been the subject of workshops,
conferences, and symposia. It has been the focus of work
by industry professional societies, the National Academy of
Engineering, and the National Science Foundation. A better
understanding of the scale of workforce needs is being
studied: IEEE’s Power Engineering Society has begun a
detailed study of the workforce environment in the electric
power delivery industry in North America, as has already
occurred in other countries.
Manpower issues are increasingly listed among top
strategic concerns of industry executives. The principal
reason for the expertise exodus is the aging workforce.

700
Number of employees

Retirements, restructuring, and technology
changes are producing an accelerating exodus
of expertise from the electric power industry.
In this article, the authors review the major
approaches to address that challenge: managing
available resources, outsourcing, automating,
recording, and educating. The approaches
may all be used in a comprehensive strategy to
overcome exiting expertise. Each approach has
different implications for the resources needed
to be successful. The responses to date have not
been sufficiently comprehensive and of adequate
scale to address the looming workforce losses.
The authors contend that the needed leadership
by executives, policymakers, and academia
to comprehensively address the expertise
exodus challenge will be enhanced by a better
understanding of the diverse approaches and
of where effective intervention with sufficient
resources is needed.

Employee age group

Source: KEMA analysis

Fig. 1 illustrates the distribution of ages in the utility
workforce now and in 5 and 10 years. The Nuclear Energy
Institute estimated that 73.2% of direct employment in the
nuclear generation sector is between the ages of 43 and 57
and that 28% of those employees will retire within 5 years,
with another 18% leaving for non-retirement reasons. The
prediction by Keith Mueller is that the “tipping point”
in accelerating retirements will come at the end of this
decade. Some utilities report that as much as 40% of their
employees will be eligible for retirement in the next 5
years; however, the average may be more on the order of
20% over the next 5 years and 50% over the next 10 years.
Besides retirements, other reasons for the exodus include
industry restructuring and internal reorganizations.

Actions being taken in response to the rapidly approaching
tipping point are summarized in four approaches:
• Human resource management—identification
and evaluation of knowledge and skills at risk and
strategies to address the risk.
• Automating—applying technology to
complete tasks.
• Recording—putting knowledge into
accessible records.
• Educating—transferring knowledge to the next
generation of engineers and technicians.

The responses to date do not seem to be sufficiently
comprehensive and of adequate scale to address the looming
workforce losses. Technology deployment does not appear fast
enough. University power programs face significant shortfalls
in resources and faculty. In sum, the needed leadership by
executives, policymakers, and academia to comprehensively
address the expertise exodus will be enhanced by a better
understanding of the diverse responses and of where effective
intervention with resources can occur to make a difference in
addressing the expertise exodus problem.
Human resources management
The human resources issues associated with an aging
workforce require new practices and policies around
recruitment, retention, and other traditional human resources
concerns. For operations management, the challenges can
require daily juggling of resources and priorities based on
workload, emergencies, manpower availability, and many
other variables. These are not new challenges for operations
and engineering organizations; however, the added variables
of shrinking workforce and diminished organizational

e x p e r t i s e

POWER

experience compound current decisionmaking and
prioritization challenges—and thus increase the probability
of important work being done as a lower priority, to a lower
standard due to lack of time and expertise, or at higher costs.
These are not acceptable options, so risk mitigation is critical.
There are strong parallels to be made between the focus of
the industry today on asset management strategies and the
challenge the industry faces in managing the aging workforce.
Both issues are fundamentally rooted in the need to develop
operating strategies and practices that optimize the available
resources. This could mean scarce financial resources for
system expansion, improvement, and maintenance. It also
could mean scarce human resources (and experience) for
daily work management and task completion.
One asset management philosophy, described by Richard
Brown and Bruce Humphrey, identifies three primary
areas of competency for a robust asset management
structure: management, engineering, and information.
Workforce management must consider people, processes,

During the 1990s, in their efforts to contain costs and
increase efficiencies, utilities endeavored to “reengineer”
business processes, and replace or install information
technology systems to support the newly designed
processes. The practice of “reengineering” evolved to
“business process management,” and then to “operational
innovation.” The concepts underlying these practices have a
place in the overall strategy to manage the aging workforce
challenge. Activities such as codification of information,
knowledge management system creation, business process
redesign, work process automation, and outsourcing are
all elements of a comprehensive strategy. The issue for
management is how to best use these tools and activities.

and technology. To optimize the human capability within
the organization, that capability must be inventoried and
evaluated. In addition, an assessment is needed of the
business processes and technologies supporting those
processes. This comprehensive evaluation offers both the
challenge and opportunity to identify operational strengths
and weaknesses and to prioritize the areas
requiring immediate action. As with asset management,
workforce management requires a comprehensive
understanding of the current condition, the areas of
greatest risk, and the timing of required actions.
Management skills
Operations management today faces the challenges of
workforce attrition, aging physical infrastructure, rapidly
changing technology, increasing customer expectations for
reliable service, and continuing cost pressures to maintain
acceptable financial performance of the company. Significant
workforce attrition due to retirements is an additional factor
to be addressed as part of a holistic management approach
to business operations. Such a comprehensive approach
involves the study and consideration of all tools available
to management to meet the company objectives, not solely
the human resources component. The business processes
and technology currently in place combine with the human
element to create a complete business operations and
management system. When addressing a specific change
in one element of the system, it is necessary to consider all
elements of the system. Attrition due to an aging workforce
can be a driver for improving overall operational efficiency
through a comprehensive review of how people, processes,
and technologies are used.

14

Outsourcing
Utility companies have used outsourcing as a tool to
supplement the permanent workforce and manage peaks in
workload. Here, outsourcing refers to temporary employees
and contract labor forces. For example, utilities often
supplement construction and maintenance forces with line
construction contract companies. The contractors can be
used as workload dictates, and the company workforce can
be used primarily for critical operations activities. Similarly,
temporary workers have been used to supplement many
operations functions when workload dictates the need.
As a temporary workload management option, outsourcing
has been a normal operating process. But what about
outsourcing work as a permanent operating practice?
Can this be successful? Is it confined to specific functions,
and what are they? How do we determine when and how
to apply outsourcing as a primary tool for workforce
management? These are all questions that should be
answered for outsourcing to be a more permanent solution
to workforce attrition due to aging.
Because retiring employees often have an interest in
continuing their professions, outsourcing sometimes
takes the form of contracting with former employees. This
approach avoids significant loss of institutional knowledge,
but it creates a change in the fundamental business
relationship between company and employee. While this
can be a non-issue, it must be addressed to ensure thorough
understanding of the expectations of both parties.
Complete outsourcing of selected business processes is an
option in addressing exiting expertise. As illustrated in Fig.
2, certain administrative functions are already outsourced
by many utility companies, and because the industry

spends an estimated $19.1 billion on selling, general, and
administrative functions, there are many vendors who
offer comprehensive outsourcing options. The outsourcing
of engineering and operations activities is more complex,
however, because those activities involve critical tasks
associated with electric system integrity.
Task and skill analysis
As utility companies evaluate their needs, resources,
and capabilities, they ultimately consider the tasks to be
performed within an organization and the skills required
to proficiently execute those tasks. This is fundamental
job-task analysis. Most often the existing paradigm is to
base workforce planning on in-house execution of the
expected or average work load and to manage workload
peaks by exception, either through overtime, temporary
personnel, or contractors. This is a tried and proven
approach, but not necessarily the most effective approach
when considering limited resources and lack of requisite
skills in any given task area. The challenge is to consciously

e x p e r t i s e

POWER

and actively evaluate specific job requirements to determine
what workforce management philosophy best suits the
needs of the company or offers alternatives that facilitate
achievement of multiple operating objectives.
In the utility industry this may involve determining which
operating tasks contractors can perform and which tasks
company employees must always perform. The determinants
may be issues of safety, security, knowledge, or skills, among
other considerations. In an engineering organization, for
example, this may involve decisions on whether company
employees, contract engineers, or consultants should do
design, planning, or forecasting tasks. The analysis also
forces consideration of what skill level is required of in-house
employees for specific processes and job tasks.
A structured approach to process analysis involves evaluation
of the business process and tasks from several perspectives.
One approach is a formalized job-task evaluation that
includes assessment of what tasks are priorities, what skill

level is required, and how often a task is performed. Once
these parameters are established, an evaluation can be made
of what would be the most efficient and effective manner

tasks and options for completion.

For example, a low-complexity, high-frequency, highpriority process would be an excellent candidate for
system automation. Consider remittance processing as an
example of a process that meets this description. Every day,
companies handle thousands of customer payments that
require immediate handling to properly reflect the customer’s
payment as well as to optimize revenue collection for the
company. This process was automated years ago in most
utilities and has evolved to electronic payment capabilities
to further accelerate the process. Automated meter reading
is an example of a current generation business process that
is being evaluated against these criteria with decisions being
made on how to best allocate limited resources. In the past, a
primary driver for initiating process change was improving
the efficiency and reducing the cost of operations. With the
aging workforce, the driver for initiating process change is
different, but the manner in which the issues are addressed
can be similar, if not the same.
As with all elements of work management and manpower
planning, there is no one right solution for all operations.
The framework for analysis, however, is useful in forcing
discussion and rigorous consideration of all options
available to management to meet overall business
objectives. At the very least, the evaluation provides inputs
to a business decision process addressing the optimal
utilization of financial resources.
The evaluation of work processes, options for carrying out
those processes, and overall effectiveness of the organization
provides information for a business case analysis. Again,

16

applying the premise that the objective is optimal resource
utilization, the analysis must consider the question of
effectiveness of resources consumed, or more directly, what
“bang for the buck” is being achieved. Is it more effective
to buy an employee’s services with all the additional costs
of training, benefits, and facilities, or is it more effective to
buy services from a vendor? Or a third option may be to
buy a technology to do the work. All of these issues carry
different weights and priorities in different companies, and
management must determine what best suits their culture,
business model and service delivery objectives.
Automating
One of the process management options to be considered,
as illustrated in Fig. 3, is automation or the application of
technology to complete tasks. A comprehensive evaluation
of technology available to support business processes is
a fundamental element of process design and, in the case
of replacing an aging workforce, technology can be an
important element of a comprehensive strategy. Recent
industry events as well as operating policies mandated by
legislation demand more sophisticated technological tools
and solutions in the industry.
As processes and operations become more dependent
upon automated solutions, the importance of human skills
to use and support the technology increases significantly.
It is not enough to understand the business processes,
rules, standards, procedures, or science associated with
a job function. The employee must also have a working
knowledge of the technologies or applications that are used
to support or perform the job functions. Each technological
innovation requires some new degree of skill by the
employee using or depending on the technology. Even
without an aging workforce issue, the increasing use of
technology for operations and management demand new
skills in the workforce
The aging workforce again may be the catalyst for automation
that, until now, has been considered too expensive, too
complex, or just too new. As the aging workforce “tipping
point” approaches, management should consider what
additional business functions or opportunities exist with
the application of a particular information technology. With
the automated meter reading example, if the intent is simply
to perform the meter reading function as a cost-reduction
initiative, the business case is generally weak; however, the
business case is improved when management considers

e x i t i n g

that value of the expanded functionality available through
the technology for load control functions, customer data
gathering, and a number of other activities that could drive
additional business revenue opportunities or reduce other
costs in addition to the labor for reading the meter.
Utilities have over the past decade greatly increased the use
of new technologies in operating processes. Automation
expenditures—about $700 million in 2005—will fall into
two principal areas: real-time automation and controls, and
geospatial and field automation. Expenditure growth rates
are on the order of 20–30% per year. Geographic information
systems, substation automation (SCADA), AMR, mobile
work management, outage management, load control
systems, and CMMS are all widely deployed in the industry.
A common issue, however, is the integration of the
various applications both from an information technology
perspective and a business process perspective. Many
automated systems have been implemented to support a
narrowly defined process that is confined to one function
or organization. The future need to address the exiting
human expertise as well as the need to be operationally
efficient and effective will drive an integrated approach
to technology across all operational functions and
organizations. This requires a high-level technology
roadmap that identifies the overall strategy and direction
for using automation in the organization. Developing
the roadmap is another fundamental element of a
comprehensive business operations plan.
The financial evaluations of new technology applications
also require a slightly different approach compared with
traditional methods. Cost-benefit analyses would show
that the costs of many automated tools are still too high to
justify their adoption. In using automation to replace aging
workers, the analysis must go beyond the immediately
identifiable costs and consider the implications of
not implementing the technology for the future. The
technology business case must quantify and evaluate this
risk factor in order to fully address the issue.
Implementation and operational reliance on technology
or automation presents human resource issues in the
areas of recruitment, retention, and employee skills. As
companies work to recruit and retain new workers, they are
continually competing for technologically savvy workers
who do not think of the electric utility industry as a center

E n er gy Wo r k f o r c e

e x p e r t i s e

POWER

of sophisticated technology applications. How much
more successful can utilities be in recruiting and retaining
workers if the technology used to engineer, operate, and
maintain a power grid is leading-edge, both for the industry
and in development of automated tools in general? It is
safe to assume that the odds of attracting technical talent
will be improved. There is no question that “Generation
Y” workers expect to be involved with technology both
as a tool for their work and as the subject of their work,
so any business that does not have a high component of
technology in their work will be less attractive to the best
and the brightest employees of the future.
Recording
The retention of knowledge held by workers about to retire is
an immediate concern and a challenge for utility companies.
Before a knowledge retention program or activity can
begin, the company must have some sense of what is critical
knowledge and where it is held. The task to understand
these issues is daunting and, in many companies, is without
process or precedence. Some early mover companies have
explored this issue for a number of years and have developed
effective process models for determining what is critical
knowledge and who has it. In most cases, the activity to
address knowledge retention involves a comprehensive
organizational survey activity, coupled with a welldefined process for recording, cataloging, and storing the
information acquired through interviews and surveys. How
this is done is a function of the culture and practices within
the specific company. In all cases, however, there is a strong
management commitment to provide the time and resources
to make the process successful.
D.W. DeLong presents a four-pronged strategy for dealing
with knowledge retention in an organization (as illustrated
in Fig. 4). This model calls for a multi-dimensional

approach to knowledge retention that is customized to the
individual company’s needs, capabilities, and culture and
has the long-term commitment of management.
Perhaps most significant in DeLong’s knowledge retention
strategy is the component of knowledge recovery. The
need for knowledge recovery initiatives recognizes that,
regardless of systems and processes and procedures, some
critical institutional knowledge will undoubtedly be lost
with exiting workers. It is imperative that companies
acknowledge this and have an active strategy to deal with
lost knowledge. That strategy may involve hiring retired
workers as consultants or contractors or using expert
consultants to address specific issues. In any case, the
company must be prepared with a strategy and action plan
to mitigate the impact of knowledge loss. Technology can
be a key component of an effective knowledge retention
strategy. Various knowledge management programs and
applications are available “off the shelf ” today, as well as
customized solutions. For operating utility companies,
however, the most effective initiatives for knowledge
retention will likely be in areas other than a technology
for knowledge retention and management. The operating
systems used in the business, as well as ongoing mentoring
and training of new workers, will be the primary vehicles
for retention of information for daily operations.
Education
Education is making a critical contribution to addressing
the exiting expertise problem. Industry is enhancing
in-house education capabilities and working with
education organizations to develop new approaches to
life-long learning and to educating the next generation
of technicians and engineers. Universities are altering
their curricula to respond to the new skill and knowledge
requirements of today’s engineering workforce.
Yet major concerns remain about the sustainability of
university power programs. The good news is that the
number of undergraduate and graduate students has probably
bottomed out or even started to grow after reaching a high in
the early 1980s (although the recent growth in the number
of graduate students at US institutions may be offset by
declines in international student applications due to US visa
barriers and preferences by international governments for
their students to get graduate degrees in their home countries
to avoid “brain drain”). The bad news is that the growth in
students is probably insufficient to meet the coming demand.

18

Worse yet, the university infrastructure for supporting that
growth is weakening. The major US power programs are
not adding new young faculty members at a rate sufficient
to make up for the anticipated loss of retiring faculty
just at the time that major losses will be occurring in the
workforce. The following section addresses the problem of
sustaining university power engineering (PE) programs
Sustaining university power programs
To understand what is required to sustain university power
programs, it is useful to understand the core decision
influences affecting decisions to become a PE student or
faculty member and interactions between faculty and
students. A simple model of the interactions may be useful,
as illustrated in Fig. 5. What this model shows is that
universities, industry, and government can—or indeed
must—contribute to sustaining university power programs.

Assuming for the moment that the objective is to fill Jobs
in Industry (as shown in Fig. 5) to address the exodus
of expertise, it is necessary that potential PE students
consider PE as a career. Since the decision to enter into a
power program, whether as an undergraduate or graduate
student, has to be made in advance of actually going on
the job market, perhaps by as much as 4 years, student
perceptions of future Job Opportunities are important.
They will consider the number of potential job openings,
the challenge and career progression opportunities, salary,
job security, among other factors. Ross Schifo outlined
a comprehensive “professional core values model” that
describes factors that someone might consider in choosing
PE as a career.

e x i t i n g

Potential PE students will also consider the quality and
cost of the education that they will get. Will the tuition be
worth it? Three basic considerations will be the perceived
Program Quality, Curriculum Relevance, and Tuition
Cost. For a potential graduate student, the availability of
Graduate Support will be a prime consideration.
Students taking a Job in Industry will help with the expertise
exodus problem directly. However, sustaining power
programs requires new faculty. Graduate students at the
doctoral level may also consider the possibility of becoming
PE faculty members and enter the pool of Potential PE
Faculty. This pool is also composed of people in industry
with doctorates who want to go back to academia.
A graduate student’s decision to actually pursue a PE
Faculty position will be influenced by a number of
factors. Foremost, there have to be PE faculty positions
available. There are few such positions opening up for
entry by young faculty. The Support of Dean and Faculty
engineering programs has been difficult to obtain in recent
years; they are cutting back on power programs because
of greater research funding opportunities in other fields,
reduced stature of PE as an engineering field due to the
misperception that significant new innovations are not
needed or anticipated, and perceptions about low student
interest in the field.
Even if a position is available, a Potential PE Faculty
member must consider the likelihood of getting tenure.
That likelihood is based on the understanding of the
Support of Dean and Faculty, anticipated opportunities
for Research Support, and Institutional Expectations
regarding teaching load and tenure requirements, among
other considerations. Without Research Support, the young
faculty member will not be able to establish the research
and publishing record necessary for tenure. And that
research support needs to be sufficient to carry graduate
students through their own program: the young faculty
member-graduate student relationship is synergistic,
with each relying on the other for reaching their separate
objectives: tenure and graduation. Faculty need to be able
to attract quality students for the graduate programs, and
the ability to provide Graduate Support is a critical decision
factor for the potential graduate student.
The fundamental interactions among faculty and
undergraduate and graduate students occur either in the

E n er gy Wo r k f o r c e

e x p e r t i s e

POWER

Classroom or on Projects and Theses. It is those interactions
that determine the quality of the education experience. And
the higher the quality of the education experience, the greater
will be the contribution that student will be able to make
in restoring expertise in the industry—and the greater the
likelihood of success of a graduate student as a PE Faculty
member. There is an axiom that says, “What goes around,
comes around.” In this case, a quality education breeds
quality teachers that in turn produces quality education. In
this circle, research provides support of faculty and graduate
students but also enhances the education experience.
What then is the fundamental basis of a sustainable power
program? It is the stature of the program in the eyes of
the Dean, fellow faculty members, industry, and students.
Major drivers of that stature are:
• Ample R&D funding, particularly of a nature
that gives graduate students support through
their program and produces new knowledge that
both solves industry challenges and advances the
quality of education.
• Ample attractive positions in industry that
motivate students to take PE courses and enter
into PE graduate programs.
• High quality and affordable cost of the education.
Producing next PE generation
Using the model given in Fig. 5, it is possible to see where
focus needs to be given to increase the number of PE
graduates to address the exodus of expertise.
Based on the model, a comprehensive strategy to attract
more students to the PE field would:
• Increase the number of Potential PE Students
• Improve power Program Quality and
Curriculum Relevance.
• Control Tuition Costs, perhaps providing targeted
tuition assistance when needed to advance diversity.
• Increase Graduate Support.
• Improve Job Opportunities.
• Improve the quality of interactions among faculty
and students in the Classroom and in Projects
and Theses.
To get more PE Faculty to sustain power programs, the
model suggests such objectives as:
• Increase Research Support.
• Increase support by engineering Deans
and Faculty.

Equitable and reasonable Institutional
Expectations, particularly of new faculty.

Importantly, the model reveals that industry, government,
and universities all have a role to play. For each objective,
strategies can be identified for each of the three vested
interests. For instance, more Research Support is needed
from industry and government to support faculty and
to enhance classroom and project learning experiences;
universities also need to look at new models of industrygovernment-university interactions to make that support
attractive beyond simply supporting power programs.
To get more PE Students requires that industry make Job
Opportunities more attractive relative to other fields, that
industry and government help support Tuition Cost and
Graduate Support, and that universities ensure that they
are offering the best possible education at an affordable
Tuition Cost.
Thus there exists a need for greater attention to the problem
of sustaining power programs while increasing interest in
PE education. A comprehensive strategy is needed with
collaboration among industry, government, and universities
to develop a plan for educating the next generation of
power engineers. As Schifo noted, such collaboration
needs to articulate a “compelling mission,” but with the
realization that industry, government, and university all
have something to bring to (and take from) the table.
Conclusions
The exodus of technical expertise is accelerating in
the electric power industry. Of the four approaches to
addressing this exodus described in this article, utilities
are probably most frequently relying on short-payback,
low-cost solutions, such as operations management
improvements, outsourcing with previous employees, and
in-house training programs. It is necessary to view the
exodus not as a short-term problem, but as a long-term
opportunity to rebuild the companies around the next
generation of engineers and technicians. Decisions on
investments in people are just as important as the decisions
on investments in the aging infrastructure.
A priority investment in people should be in the current
and potential organization leaders who demonstrate the
skills, capability, and forward thinking to envision and
create an organizational capability for self-renewal through

20

knowledge retention and transfer. This capability may occur
through direct human interaction and training, various
technological solutions, or most likely a combination that
supports the organization knowledge base.
The urgency for the investments in people is felt in
professional engineering meetings and in the workplace.
But the public discourse among executives and
policymakers does not reveal the same sense of urgency.
This is also seen in the declining level of research funding
of universities even though research is the lifeblood of the
research and education mission of universities.
The exiting workforce, the limited labor pool for
experienced workers, and the diminished pipeline of
newly educated engineers to fill vacant positions challenge
all electric power interests to evaluate new educational
methods and practices, new work processes, new
technology, and new methods for knowledge retention.
At all levels of the issue there is a need for comprehensive
strategies to address attracting and retaining more power
engineering students, to evaluate and integrate new
technologies into daily utility operations, and to develop
innovative operating models that incorporate the best of
people and technology to optimize the effectiveness of
scarce human and financial resources. —EW

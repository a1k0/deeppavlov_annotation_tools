COVER
The wild oil price swing and global economic collapse of 2008
create huge questions at the start of 2009. Where is the bottom
of the economic slump? When will oil and gas prices rebound?
Where and when, if ever, will prices stabilize? In The Year Ahead
special report (p. 18), Oil & Gas Journal’s news writers and editors
grapple with these and other crucial issues of the new year.

General

Interest

NPRA, others ask for more ethanol blend tests
Fourteen organizations, including the National Petrochemical &
Refiners Association, on Dec. 18 called for “unbiased and comprehensive testing” before the US Environmental Protection Agency
permits the use of midlevel ethanol blends in engines.
Other groups included the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, American Lung Association, Engine Manufacturers
Association, and Motorcycle Industry Council.
Calling themselves an informal coalition, the groups said they
are concerned about air quality, engine compatibility, and safety.
“There has not been sufficient testing of motor vehicle and
nonroad equipment engines to justify a determination that any
midlevel ethanol blend would meet the requirements,” they said in
a letter to EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson.
The test results that exist suggest midlevel ethanol blends might
be incompatible with current motor vehicle and nonroad equipment engines, might cause emission control devices or systems
to fail, might defeat engines’ safety features, and might lead to
significantly higher emissions over the engines’ useful life, they
continued.
“Collectively, our organizations strongly believe that this issue
should not be part of the rulemaking proposal for the revised Renewable Fuel Standard under the [2007 Energy Independence and
Security Act]. The midlevel ethanol blend issue should be discussed
at length, but the vehicle should be a separate advance notice of
proposed rulemaking,” said the groups.

Australian CSM players continue to consolidate
Two recent takeover announcements will further reduce the
number of Australia’s coal seam methane (CSM) players in 2009.
Brisbane-based Arrow Energy Ltd. made a cash and share takeover offer for fellow Brisbane company Pure Energy Resources
Ltd., which values Pure at $673 million (Aus.).
This was followed by Sydney company AGL Energy Ltd.’s $171
million all-cash takeover bid for Sydney Gas Ltd.
Arrow’s offer is made up of $2.70/share in cash plus 1.21 Arrow shares for each Pure share.

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Arrow began the move already holding 19.9% interest in Pure,
setting the net acquisition cost at $551 million. Arrow says it will
fund the cash component of its offer through a combination of
existing cash reserves and proceeds from an earlier deal to sell 30%
of its upstream coal seam methane interests to Shell.
Pure’s independent directors have unanimously recommended
the offer to the company’s shareholders, if no superior bid is forthcoming.
The acquisition will provide Arrow with control of additional
acreage and reserves in the prospective Walloon Coal Measures in
the Surat basin of southeast Queensland, adjacent to its proposed
Surat-Gladstone pipeline, as well as further acreage in the Bowen
basin further north adjacent to its proposed Moranbah-Gladstone
pipeline.
If successful, the acquisition will bring Arrow’s total uncontracted 2P CSM reserves to 2 tcf, which is sufficient to underpin
two 1.5-million-tonne/year LNG trains planned for Gladstone.
Arrow’s offer will open Feb. 11 and close Mar. 11.
AGL Energy’s move on Sydney Gas also appears to be friendly in
that Sydney Gas directors have unanimously agreed to recommend
the offer and will accept shares in the absence of a superior offer.
AGL’s offer values Sydney gas at 42.5¢ (Aus.)/share. AGL will
fund the acquisition with cash reserves.
The offer follows AGL’s purchase earlier this month of the prospective permit PEL 285, in the Gloucester basin of northern New
South Wales, from fellow CSM players Molopo Australia and AJ Lucas for $370 million.
The Sydney Gas deal will bring AGL full control of the producing and prospective CSM acreage in the Camden and Hunter Valley
regions of the Sydney basin in New South Wales.
With AGL’s capacity to meet funding requirements, it believes it
is best placed to develop the Sydney basin resources.
AGL’s offer will open Jan. 12 and close Feb. 13.
This recent takeover activity comes hard of the heels of the British BG Group’s successful takeover of Queensland Gas Co., which
also gathered in Sunshine Gas Co. and Roma Petroleum—all CSM
players in Queensland. ✦

Development

Total ﬁnds oil near Ofon ﬁeld off Nigeria
France’s Total SA discovered oil in shallow water near its producing Ofon oil field in southeastern OML 102 off southeastern
Nigeria.
The Etisong-1 well went to TD 2,207 m in 70 m of water and
tested more than 6,000 b/d of 40° gravity oil from turbiditic reservoirs.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The well is the first step in an exploration and appraisal program
designed to demonstrate the feasibility of a new development pole
on OML 102 that would combine production from the Etisong
main discovery and as-yet-undrilled surrounding structures.
Total E&P Nigeria operates OML 102 with a 40% interest, and
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. has 60%.
Total E&P Nigeria, already a large oil producer in Nigeria, plans
to start production from Akpo deepwater oil field on OML 130 in

early 2009. The company is undertaking development studies for cause of greater demand for rigs in those days of higher oil prices.

Heritage Oil starts drilling in Kurdistan
Heritage Oil Ltd. has commenced drilling the Miran West-1 well
in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, the first exploration well to be
drilled on the Miran license.
Heritage received its license 15 months ago, said Tony Buckingham, Heritage chief executive officer. The drilling contractor is
Great Wall Drilling Co. Ltd.
“The Miran block is highly prospective, containing two anticlines that have the potential to contain billions of barrels of oil
from multiple potential reservoir targets,” Buckingham said.
The rig will drill the Miran West structure to an anticipated
depth of 2,500-3,000 m, targeting what Heritage calls the three
principal proved reservoir formations. They are the Shiranish, Kometan, and Qamchuqua reservoirs.
The Miran license contains two large structures, Miran West
and Miran East that have been mapped from some 332 km of
seismic data acquired by Heritage.

Indonesian ﬁrm forecasts reduced 2009 output
Indonesia’s publicly listed oil and gas company PT Medco Energi Internasional predicts that its oil and gas production could drop
in 2009 by as much as 10% due to asset sales and aging fields.
Medco finance director Cyril Noerhadi said the firm had sold
participating shares in the Tuban block to state-owned PT Pertamina and in the Simenggaris block to Salamander Energy Ltd.
“Aside from that, our fields on average are already at the aging
stage and can no longer produce optimally,” Cyril said.
During the first 9 months of 2008, Medco oil and gas production totaled 65,460 b/d of oil equivalent, down 6.4% from the
69,970 b/d produced during the same period in 2007.
Last year, Medco’s oil production alone reached 50,411 b/d,
down from 56,367 b/d in 2006.
The director said Medco’s oil and gas output likely would start
increasing again in 2011 after seven key projects are completed.
Although Medco recorded a 51.6% increase in revenue between
the first 9 months of 2008, climbing to $972.2 million over last
year’s $641.4 million, Cyril declined to state how much the firm
planned by way of capital expenditure next year.
“The current economic conditions will narrow down alternatives for capital access,” Cyril said, adding that Medco normally
spends $250-300 million annually.
Meanwhile, Medco Pres.-Director Darmoyo Doyoatmojo said
new gas facilities being installed on South Sumatra’s Lematang
Block would be completed in June 2009.
Darmoyo said the remaining projects, which will be completed
in 2011-12, include Block A gas field in Aceh, the enhanced oil recovery project on Block Rimau in South Sumatra, Area 47 in Libya,
the Senoro gas field in Central Sulawesi, and a power project in
Sarulla, North Sumatra.
Darmoyo also said the company would intensify its search for
overseas oil and gas fields as the success rate for confirming feasible
reserves in Indonesia remains very low at between 10-15%. ✦

planned pipeline route in Santa Monica Bay ranged from 16% at its
origin 23 miles offshore to 48% at its planned terminus near Los
Angeles International Airport.
“Earthquakes of this size can cause damage over a large region,”
said USGS in the report, citing impacts of the 1994 Northridge
quake, which measured 6.7 points at its epicenter.
USGS said the proposed deepwater LNG project would be situated in 3,000 ft of water and would be connected to onshore systems by twin 24-in. pipelines to onshore systems 35 miles away.
Facilities would include a deepwater port, including submersible
buoys, manifolds, and risers.
The deepwater terminal would be 27 miles from the Los Angeles coast and more than 5 miles from shipping lanes, according to
project sponsor Woodside Natural Gas of Santa Monica, Calif. USGS
said the regasified LNG would be delivered onshore into an existing Southern California Gas Co. system. Woodside Natural Gas is a
subsidiary of Woodside Petroleum Ltd.
USGS reported that the proposed project’s pipelines would face
hazards from potential sea floor offsets because they cross at least
two faults, as well as tsunamis, erosion or scouring, shallow gas
deposit venting, and pipeline settling.
It added that 27 USGS and California Geological Survey scientists reviewed regional geologic hazards identified in a 2007 report
prepared by Fugro West Inc. as part of OceanWay’s 2007 deepwater
port application.
US Rep. Jane Harmon (D-Calif.), in a Mar. 25 letter to USGS,
also requested information on geologic hazards that should be
considered in connection with the proposed project.

TAQA, Gazprom sign MOU for Bergermeer project
Gazprom Export and TAQA Energy BV., a wholly owned subsidiary of Abu Dhabi National Energy Co., signed a memorandum of
understanding to partner in Europe’s largest new gas storage project in the Netherlands, the Bergermeer gas storage.
Operator TAQA is finalizing technical design, permitting, and
planning processes to start converting the existing depleted Bergermeer gas reservoir into Europe’s largest new seasonal gas storage
facility. The project is essential to the Dutch government’s ambition
to realize the North-West European gas hub in the Netherlands.
The Bergermeer consortium consists of Energie Beheer Nederland, Dyas BV, Petro-Canada, and TAQA Energy BV.
Construction is expected to start in second-quarter 2009, with
commercial operations scheduled to begin in second-quarter 2013.
Once operational, most of the facility’s capacity will be available for
third party access.
Gazprom will deliver cushion gas for injection in the summer
months over the next 4 years. Cushion gas will ensure that the reservoir has the optimal pressure to start commercial storage operations.
TAQA and Gazprom Export aim to finalize all technical and contractual discussions in coming months to reach a final investment decision
by the end of first-quarter 2009. At the same time TAQA is continuing
discussions with other potential partners and cushion gas suppliers to
create a diverse consortium of global energy players to participate in
the project and ensure on-time completion of Bergermeer.

Santos lets FEED contract for CSM-fed LNG plant
Santos Ltd. hired Bechtel as its front-end engineering and design contractor for a proposed 3.5 million tonnes/year coalseam
methane (CSM)-fed LNG plant in Gladstone, Queensland.
The $40 million contract is expected to provide an updated estimate of project cost, Santos said. An initial estimate was $7.7 billion. Petronas is working with Santos to produce LNG using CSM.
Santos expects to make a decision during the first half of 2009 on
whether to proceed with the project. Construction tentatively is scheduled to begin in 2010, with first shipments of LNG scheduled for
2014.
Conventional natural gas reserves in fields close to eastern Australian markets are declining while gas demand continues to grow
substantially. CSM resources are close to large potential markets in
eastern Australia.

Nippon Oil boosts stake in PNG LNG
Nippon Oil Corp. has purchased AGL Energy Ltd.’s entire 3.6%
stake of the PNG LNG gas production and liquefaction project
off Papua New Guinea, increasing Nippon’s share to 5.4% from
1.8%.
The PNG LNG project, led by ExxonMobil Corp., is designed to liquefy natural gas at a local facility and export 6.3 million tonnes/year
of LNG, starting in third-quarter 2013 (OGJ Online, Dec. 18, 2008).
The agreement with AGL Energy also stepped up Nippon Oil’s
interest in two Papua New Guinea producing oil fields, increasing
its share of output to 8,000 b/d from 2,000 b/d.
The sale to Nippon Oil is a plus for the project, especially after
recent reports that ExxonMobil, due to the current global financial
crisis, has been searching for $10 billion in financing for the LNG
venture.
“At a time when we are seeking to borrow more than $10 billion on the international money market, it would be foolish of me
to stand here and tell you that this project is—and will remain—
completely immune from the fallout of the current financial crisis,” ExxonMobil’s LNG venture manager Peter Graham told an investors conference.
“We continue to look for ways to protect this project from the
global financial uncertainties, and I emphasize we’re still targeting
fourth-quarter of 2009 for that all-important financial investment
decision,” Graham said.
In November, the PNG LNG project received a financial boost
when the government concluded a $1 billion agreement with Abu
Dhabi’s state-owned International Petroleum Investment Co. (OGJ
Online, Nov. 5, 2008).
“This is an exceptional deal in the current global financial climate,” PNG’s Minister for Public Enterprise Arthur Somare said of
the agreement with IPIC.
According to Somare, the IPIC loan “should also assist the project developer, ExxonMobil, in its efforts to conclude LNG marketing arrangements and to raise the 70% debt finance required for
this Kina 40 billion ($16 billion) venture.”
Following the AGL Energy sale, the PNG LNG project consortium includes ExxonMobil subsidiary Esso Highlands Ltd. 41.5%,
Oil Search 34%, Santos 17.7%, Nippon Oil 5.4%, MRDC 1.2%, and
Petromin PNG Holdings’ Eda Oil 0.2%. ✦

Westbrook responds
The letter by Jeff Temple (OGJ,
December 8, 2008, p. 14) on my letter
(OGJ, Nov. 3, 2008, p. 12) has about a
dozen areas deserving comment. I will
cite six.
1. I started out by asking about
three physicists (Dr. Richard Lindzen,
Dr. Robert Jastrow, and Dr. Habibullo
Abdussamatov). Mr. Temple berates me
by observing one of these was deceased.
I didn’t realize it was not cricket to refer
to scientists who have passed on. Furthermore, the work by Dr. Jastrow that
I cited (Reference 1) was from 1990,
when he was very much alive.
2. Next he complains that none of
these three have “ever authored a testable theory, produced data, or presented
papers explaining the current global
temperature trend.” That is a mere listing
of charges and opinions. How about
some significant analysis of their work,
not just generalities. See Reference 2. For
example, how about a definitive assessment of Lindzen’s research and writings? Reference 3 lists 229 publications
by Lindzen. Besides being the Sloan
Professor of Meteorology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lindzen is a
member of the National Academy of Science, the youngest scientist ever elected.
3. Mr. Temple then twists my statement “of a barely discernable 0.6º C.
increase” to one where I “denigrate
the 0.6º C. increase.” He argues “small
changes in mean global surface temperature claims do indeed matter.” However,
he provides zero input on the quality of
the measurements that go into this mean
with no indication that errors involved
maybe larger than the changes themselves.
4. Going back to Point 2, the work
by Jastrow et al., contrary to Mr. Temple’s
claim, did explain or estimate the current global temperature trend at 0.4
-1.8º C. See Reference 1.
5. He charges that my comments on
temperature change indicate “he does
not understand climate science.” Well,
I understand chemistry and economics
with advanced degrees in both areas,
each with a minor in math. And the
chemistry I took was very heavy into
physical chemistry and hence physics.
I have studied the climate issue since
1988, so I like to think I absorbed some______________

Peak oil and politics
Peak oil theory is important both to consider
and to keep in perspective, especially as government activism regains traction in the world’s largest oil-consuming country. The theory addresses a
question of obvious importance: future availability
of an energy source with competitively overwhelming form value. It also raises problems.
According to peak oil theory, geologic constraints are closing in on global capacity to
produce crude oil. After reaching a postulated
peak, which may be imminent, production must
decline, perhaps rapidly. The scenario leads some
observers to seek governmental responses to a
looming if indistinct decline in energy supply.

undaunted by thoughts of geologic constraint,
producers were adding production capacity when
the market reversed and prices plunged.
The prior hard encounter of consumption with
supply limits occurred in the mid-1990s after a
decade of bottom-bumping oil prices and rising
consumption. Pressure subsided when consumption fell after the Asian financial collapse of late
1997. When demand revived, another price-rising
squeeze became inevitable.

There’s a Texas tall

Texas tall tale provides metaphor
for oil industry: a bouncing target

her off, sending her flying cloud-high.
She plummeted back to earth, landing
on her bustle, and its spring-like metal
frame bounced her even higher. So
there she was, rebounding ever higher,
falling ever lower until Bill finally had
to shoot her so she wouldn’t starve to

promised to rein in production, frontmonth crude futures prices hit a new
4-year low on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
At that time, industry observers
estimated OPEC had achieved only
60% compliance with the September
and October cuts and doubted that
members would do any better after Jan.
1. However, analysts speculated that
50% compliance would reduce OPEC
production by 2 million b/d in 2009,
while 75% compliance would take 3
million b/d off the market.
Meanwhile, low crude prices are
wrecking the budgets of OPEC members, many of whom need more
money to fund social programs and to
expand exploration and development
of new fields. So they have a major incentive to shut down enough production to raise prices—but perhaps not

US gas production has increased
since mid-2007 primarily because of
key onshore plays such as the Barnett

shale. US gas storage also is strong, so
there is less chance of an escalation in
gas prices absent a frigid winter and a

The Haynesville and Marcellus
shales also are expected to increase US
production. Chesapeake Energy Corp.
believes Haynesville will become the
largest discovery of natural gas in the
US and the fourth largest in the world.
Chesapeake currently is using 17 operated rigs to further develop its 480,000
net acres of Haynesville shale leasehold
and anticipates operating 35 rigs by
yearend 2009.
Chesapeake is also the largest leasehold owner in the Marcellus play, which
spans an area extending from West
Virginia to southern New York, with 1.8
million prospective net acres. It plans to
increase its Marcellus drilling in 2009.

Construction projects
The first phase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp.’s Chapita gas processing
plant in the Uinta basin of eastern Utah
was completed at the end of 2007. The
facility added 250 MMcfd of processing
capacity, nearly doubling what was previously available in the basin. The company currently is expanding Chapita to
500 MMcfd with a planned start-up in
first-quarter 2009. The plant could be
further expanded to 750 MMcfd.

scheduled for third-quarter 2009.
In late 2007, MarkWest Energy
Partners LP announced that it will invest
$60 million to expand nearly all of
its plants in the Appalachian region.
The expansion includes replacing its
existing Boldman and Cobb processing plants with cryogenic processing
facilities. The work will increase the
combined processing capacity at the
two locations to 95 MMcfd from 75
MMcfd and will increase the production
of natural gas liquids to over 180,000
gpd from 70,000 gpd. Completion is

to 1,688 still working. Inland water activity was unchanged with 9 active rigs.
Offshore drilling increased by 2 rigs to
64 in the Gulf of Mexico and 67 in US
offshore waters.

Seasonal impact
The Christmas holidays have always
been “a reasonable excuse to lay down
more rigs and give the crews time off,”
said analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC, New Orleans. But this year,
they said, “Given the economic crisis,
the sharp decline in oil and gas prices,
and sharply lower drilling activity forecasts, it may be timely to lay more rigs
down and leave them down.”
The analysts noted, “It’s typical to
see 10-15% seasonal rig count declines
in December-January, but we are down
12% before normal seasonality kicks
into high gear.” Evidence from producers “seems overwhelming that they will
be cutting back activity materially until
service costs come down 15-20% or oil
and gas prices recover to at least $60/
bbl and $6/Mcf,” they said.

Day rates falling
Analysts at Barclays Capital Resources, New York, said, “Day rates for jack
up rigs in the Gulf of Mexico are falling

quickly.” They cited two recent contracts
signed by Hercules Offshore Inc. for
commodity rigs working with Chevron
Corp. at rates 26% lower than their previous contracts. “These are the first in a
series of lower day rates that will likely
be revealed as the shallow water Gulf of
Mexico corrects,” the analysts said.
They reported, “The inland barge
market is also getting more difficult.
Utilization has declined, with several
additional barges now stacked.” In a
separate report, analysts said, “Last
month, 13 of Hercules’ barges were
working, with an average contract
backlog of 21 days. Today, 8 barges are
working, with an average contract backlog of 17 days.”
Moreover, they said, “Activity levels
and pricing for well service rigs are
deteriorating at a rapid pace, and we
expect this deterioration to continue
into the first half of 2009. Rig hours are
falling on a weekly basis due to both
seasonal factors and reduced demand,
and pricing has recently turned down.”
In addition, they said, “There is a
negative mix shift occurring in the
well servicing market as higher-margin
workover activity is being delayed while
lower-margin maintenance activity
continues. Well completions have been

moving forward, however, providing
well servicing operators with a backlog
of completion work in the near term.”
Barclays Capital analysts forecast
2009 global spending for exploration
and production will contract 12% to
$400 billion—“a reversal after 6 years
of global growth.” Based on a semiannual survey of 357 oil and gas companies, they said, “Budgets are being cut
in response to the significant decline
in commodity prices, constrained cash
flow, and the tight credit markets.”

US projections
Barclays Capital analysts continued,
“The sharpest decline in spending is expected to be in the US, where 2009 E&P
expenditures are indicated to drop 26%
to $79 billion,” ending a 4-year upturn.
They expect Canadian budgets to drop
23% to $22 billion in 2009.
However, Barclays Capital expects
North American E&P spending to pick
up in 2010.
The surveyed companies based their
2009 budgets on average prices of
$58/bbl for oil and $6.35/Mcf for gas.
“However, given the recent fall in prices, these price assumptions may prove
to be overstated,” analysts said. ✦

2008
in review

H

appy New Year! This year promises to be a challenging and
exciting year for oil and gas in Washington. Before getting very far into it,
however, let’s take a look at some of
2008’s more entertaining moments
in government. We do this early each
year with “Watchies,” which get their
name from this column.
The first of this year’s citations, a
“What Were They Thinking” Watchy,
goes to employees of the US Minerals
Management Service’s royalty-in-kind
program in Denver, who gave new
meaning to the phrase “government
service” in 2004-06.
Reports prepared for Department of
the Interior Insp. Gen. Earl E. Devaney’s
investigation described instances where
RIK employees helped representatives
from producers prepare bids, held outside paying jobs while still on MMS’s
payroll, and promoted private enterprises within the office.
Devaney suggested that problems
began when the program’s administrators decided to adopt a “business
model” approach under which RIK
marketers began to act more as if they
were part of the private sector, including “effectively opting out of the Ethics
in Government Act.” Other current
and former MMS employees as well as
members of Congress reacted with disgust to a situation an already controversial program simply didn’t need.

hard not only on the 2005 Energy
Policy Act but also on the 2006 bill
which opened significant new Gulf of
Mexico acreage to leasing.
Despite not having a comparable
leadership position in the House,
Peterson kept bringing Outer Continental Shelf leasing bans to the foreground as oil and gas prices climbed.
Gasoline prices breaking the $4/
gal barrier last summer probably did
more to sway public sentiment.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (DCalif.) and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall (D-W.
Va.) may have passed one of the
most restrictive OCS access bills ever
in response, but the moratoriums
still expired on Sept. 30, a prospect
inconceivable 3 years earlier to nearly
everyone but Peterson.

A clear signal

Finally, an “Unmistakable Signal”
Watchy goes to Tim DeChristopher, the
University of Utah graduate student and
environmental activist who disrupted
the US Bureau of Land Management’s
Dec. 19 oil and gas lease sale in Salt Lake
City by submitting $1.8 million of bids
he had no intention of paying.
It’s still not clear if BLM intends
to prosecute, or if it can. The agency
probably will require prospective
bidders to do more than show a picture identification proving they’re at
least 21 years old at future sales.
Effective lawmakers

Utah’s BLM office said 116 of the
131 offered parcels were sold, totaling
148,598 acres of federal land in Carbon, Duchesne, Emery, Garfield, Grand,
San Juan, and Uintah counties. Revenues totaled more than $7.4 million,
including $7.2 million in bonus bids,
$222,951 in rental fees and $16,240 in
administrative fees, it indicated.
Enduring Resources LLC of Denver
submitted the highest total bid per acre
($270) and per tract ($592,640) on
Parcel 137 containing nearly 2.2 million acres in the Vernal area, the Utah
BLM office said.
Meanwhile, 58 US House Democrats
sent a letter on Dec. 22 to Presidentelect Barack H. Obama’s transition team
urging the new administration to either
halt leasing of federal land in Utah that
have been proposed for wilderness designation or, in cases where leases have
been issued already, to cancel them and
refund what bidders have paid. ✦

Salazar to lead
‘deeply troubled’
Interior department
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Barack Obama formally nominated
US Sen. Ken Salazar (D-Colo.) on Dec.
17 to lead what the president-elect
termed a “deeply troubled” Department
of the Interior. He praised Salazar’s
ability to bring groups with opposing
viewpoints together to reach solutions.
He also named former Iowa Gov.
Tom Vilsack as agriculture secretary.
“Tom understands that the solution to
our energy crisis will be found not in
oil fields abroad but in our farm fields
at home,” Obama noted and said the
two men would “work with others to
develop a new US energy economy that
relies more on domestic alternative and
renewable resources and less on foreign
oil.”
Saying he wants “a more proactive

Interior Department,” Obama said Salazar has extensive experience on issues
the new administration will confront
in both traditional and new sources of
energy.
“If there’s going to be a debate
about oil shale, I want Ken at the table,”
Obama said. Salazar has opposed efforts to lease western lands for oil shale
development and in late September
said that when Congress reconvened,
he would try to extend a moratorium
on the Bureau of Land Management’s
proposed oil shale regulations (OGJ
Online, Sept. 26, 2008). He also has
opposed drilling in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge.

Oil, gas properly managed
Saying he would do everything he
could to reduce US dependence on
foreign oil and to develop “the new
energy economy,” Salazar said he also
would ensure that traditional resources,
including oil, gas, and coal are properly
managed.
The presidents of two leading
independent oil and gas producers’ associations applauded Salazar’s selection.
“Sen. Salazar knows better than most
the importance of the job he is about
to take on,” said Barry Russell of the
Independent Petroleum Association of
America in Washington. During Salazar’s US Senate tenure, he demonstrated
that he’s willing to listen to all sides and

viewpoints and find common ground
on complicated and contentious energy
issues, Russell added.
“He is also a life-long advocate of
a multiuse approach to managing our
public land and accessing safely the
resources that lie beneath it. The livelihoods of thousands of independent oil
and gas operators across the country
remain inextricably linked to that access, and that’s a point we intend to
make early, often, and with purpose as
this new administration begins to take
shape,” he said.
Marc W. Smith of the Independent
Petroleum Association of Mountain
States said the Denver-based organization had worked with Salazar for years
and is confident that he views natural
gas development in the area as an important long-term element in national
and regional energy supplies.
“As a Westerner, Sen. Salazar knows
that green jobs in the natural gas industry are important to state and local
economies. Since many states increasingly look to gas to complement and
enable renewable energy technologies,
there is a strong rationale for consistent
and responsible development on federal
lands in the Intermountain West,” Smith
indicated.
Gas production from the region will
become more important as Obama tries
to carry out his campaign promises to

make the country less dependent on
foreign energy sources while reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, Smith said.
Ninety-seven percent of the gas the US
consumes is produced domestically
(with 27% coming from the West) and,
since gas emits just over half the carbon
dioxide of coal, it will become even
more significant, he said.

Environmentalists
Western business leaders who commended Salazar’s nomination decried
attempts by some environmentalists to derail it. Although the group
Earthworks applauds the nomination,
some others—the Center for Biological Diversity, WildEarth Guardians, and
Western Watersheds Project—want to
derail it.
“Ken Salazar listens to all sides of an
issue,” said Roundtable executive director Britt Weygandt. “It’s unfortunate that
there are extremist groups in the West
that don’t admire that quality in our
government leaders. We do.”
Urging the senate to approve Salazar,
Waygandt said, “We look forward to
continuing to find areas of agreement
with the Obama administration and
particularly with our new secretary
of the Interior on water, public lands,
energy policy, and endangered species
regulation,” she said. “We know that
we will get a fair hearing even on those
issues where we disagree.” ✦

BMI: US to see further oil, gas supply shortfalls
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Analyst Business Monitor International (BMI) predicts that the US will
account for 89.87% of North American
regional oil demand by 2012, while
contributing 65.63% to its supply.
In North America, overall oil consumption reached 23 million b/d in
2007 and is set to increase to 23.04
million b/d by 2012, BMI said.
In 2007 North America also con-

sumed 747 billion cu m (bcm) of
natural gas, with demand of 826 bcm
targeted for 2012—a 10.6% growth.
Production of 730 bcm in 2007
should rise to 733 bcm in 2012, which
implies net imports rising to some 93
bcm by the end of the period.
The US share of North American
gas consumption in 2007 was 87.42%,
while it provided 74.82% of production. By 2012 US share of gas consumption is forecast to be 87.26% and
production to be 74.35%.

Price increase over 1Q
In second-quarter 2008, BMI
estimates that the OPEC basket price
averaged just under $115/bbl—up 24%
from the first quarter 2008 level.
The OPEC basket price exceeded
$127/bbl on May 22, slipping back
towards $121/bbl later in the month.
In June BMI assumed an average of
around $120/bbl for a quarterly estimate of $114.98/bbl.

“Our projections for 2008 as a
whole have been revised upwards from
the last quarterly report,” the analyst
said.
“We are now assuming an OPEC
basket price average of $106/bbl for
2008, compared with the $81 estimate
provided by our last quarterly report,”
BMI said.
Based on recent price differentials,
this implies Brent at $109.71, WTI
averaging $110.64/bbl, and Urals at
$106.88/bbl.
BMI estimates that US real gross
domestic product growth is at 1.2% for
2008, down from 2.2% in 2007.
“We are assuming an average annual 2.5% growth in 2008-12,” it said.

hould anyone be concerned about
the continuing rivalry between
Japan and China over pursuit of the
world’s oil and gas? It may be well to
remember some history.
It could be worth recalling that
Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato
asked the US in 1965 to use its
nuclear weapons against China in
immediate retaliation in case the two
Asian nations went to war against
each other.
As it turned out, the Japanese
request never had to be seriously
contemplated by the US. But it
shows, nonetheless, just how deeply
Japan felt about China at the time. Of
course, those feelings still run deep
on both sides.
An example of that arose about a
week ago when the two Asian rivals
each decided to send warships to the
Gulf of Aden in an effort to reduce
the risk of attacks on oil shipping off
the pirate-infested coast of Somalia.

The Chinese will protect only
Chinese ships, right? The Japanese
are, perhaps, not so sure. In fact,
the day after the Chinese dispatched
their fleet, the Japanese government
began exploring ways to dispatch its

By 2012, BMI forecasts US oilliquids output of 7.35 million b/d. Its
estimate for 2008 US oil demand is
now a lower 20.2 million b/d, because
of the impact of higher prices on consumption.
“We now see US oil consumption
hitting 20.71 million b/d by 2012,”
the analyst said. “This would require
crude imports of 13.36 million b/d.”
During 2007-18, BMI is forecasting that US oil production will increase
14.1% and output will peak at 7.92
million b/d in 2017.
Given that oil consumption is forecast to increase only 4.5%, imports ease
from 13.82 million b/d in 2007 to
13.79 million b/d during the forecast
period.
Gas production is expected to rise to
570 bcm in 2018 from the 2007 level
of 546 bcm.
Demand is forecast to rise to 747
bcm from 653 bcm, requiring an
increase of net imports to 177 bcm,

It has been established that subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs leak and
that escaping gases cause numerous
detectable alteration anomalies.1 2 The
detection methods most often used
require the capture and analysis of low
molecular weight (C1-C5) gas phase
hydrocarbons from near surface soils.1
Capturing soil gas hydrocarbons requires special sampling equipment and
handling, does not allow for the proper
integration of sampling at each location, and can be expensive to analyze.
Methods are now available that directly
detect hydrocarbons but do not require
gas capture or special sampling tools,
allow for adequate sample integration,
and are competitively priced.
A previous article suggested that hydrocarbon analysis by ultraviolet-visible
light spectroscopy offers an alternative
to the capture and analysis of soil gas.3
A similar outcome to the analysis of soil
gas hydrocarbons is obtained by measuring the amount of light absorbed by
soluble hydrocarbons found in altered
soil organic matter (SOM).
This article discusses the nongasphase hydrocarbon sampling method
and gives an example of its use at Big
Red oil field, Rice County, Kan. (Fig. 1).

Additional methods
Additional hydrocarbon detection
methods have been developed that use
just visible light. These measure the

tion. These variables are eliminated
when using nongas-phase hydrocarbon
techniques.
For instance, it is often suggested
that samples be taken at depth to avoid
hydrocarbons that have been degraded
by oxidation. This requires special sampling equipment. Also, changes in the
soil profile are not observed, and the
sometimes extreme physical and chemical variations that can occur between
sample locations may not be adequately
addressed in the interpretation.
Taking the sample from the very
near surface eliminates the need for
auguring or special tools and allows for
greater sample consistency.

problems associated with soil moisture
when sampling soil gas in dry and wet
sediments and discuss the necessity of
leveling such data. Drying and sieving
soil samples prior to analysis alleviates the need for data leveling due to
changes in moisture content and yields
more consistent survey to survey comparisons.
Temperature changes can enhance or
degrade the hydrocarbon gas signature.
Putting the samples under stress while
auguring can increase the hydrocarbon
concentration by frictional heat, yielding an artificially high background.
Many methods require elevated
temperature to separate the gas phase
from the soil matrix which can alter the
character of the analyzed hydrocarbons.
Methods using the soluble hydrocarbon
fraction of the soil organic material
can be run at ambient temperature and
without the need for thermal desorption. The salting out of gas phase
headspace hydrocarbons due to excess
inorganic salts in the soil sample is also

avoided using nongas-phase hydrocarbon techniques.5
Sufficient long-term data on the
use of the nongas-phase hydrocarbon
methods is not available to determine
whether reservoir depletion will affect
the near surface alteration signature.
Due to the degree of assimilation of the
seeping hydrocarbons into the SOM,
if there is a depletion signature, it will
manifest at a slower rate than when
measured using standard gas chromatography.

Detecting hydrocarbons
There is no doubt that measurable
quantities of hydrocarbons are found in
soil gas.
However, nongas-phase hydrocarbons associated with the alteration
anomalies that occur as a result of
chemical reactions between SOM and
seeping oil and gas hydrocarbons can
also be used as seepage indicators.
Soil is a dynamic and diverse selfregulating medium of complex bio-

logical activity and chemical reactions
featuring the elements C, H, O, and
N. Not being static, seeping hydrocarbons from oil and gas reservoirs have
ample opportunity to interact with
SOM and take part in these reactions.
The interactions might take the form of
condensation and addition reactions in
the complexation of humic substances,
electrostatic interactions with existing
humic substances, or be a component
in the integration of carbohydrates
into the soil environment by soil biotic
processes.
Humic substances are formed by
a series of complex biotic and abiotic
reactions in which a variety of organic
compounds are resynthesized to form
large complex polymers. Peripheral
pores in the polymers are capable of accommodating organic chemicals in its
lattice as a clathrate compound.6 7 Typical components of humic substances are
polysaccharides, fatty acids, polypeptides, lignins, and various combinations
of benzene and aliphatic compounds.
Humic substances are arbitrarily categorized based on solubility in water
adjusted to different pH levels.7
Two physical condensation processes explain the production of humic
substances. An amino acid reacts with a
phenol derived from either the partial
degradation of lignin or nonlignin carbon sources (possibly seeping hydrocarbons) used in microbial processes.
These form aminoquinone intermediates, which can condense to form
brown, nitrogenous humates.
The second pathway involves sugars
reacting with an amino compound.
The resulting addition compounds
rearrange and fragment to form three
intermediates (1) three carbon aldehydes and ketones, (2) reductones, and
(3) furfuals. These intermediates react
readily with amino compounds to form
dark colored end products.6 7
In normally oxygenated soils, lignin
may be broken down into low molecular weight products prior to humus
synthesis. The products may be representative of the type seeping from reservoirs. Because these are condensation

and not polymerization reactions, no
two resultant molecules are identical.
Overall structure is a function of pH,
ionic strength, and chelated metals. It is
assumed that a higher than normal concentration of hydrocarbons will result
in greater soil humification.
Fulvic acid contains less carbon and
more nitrogen and oxygen than humic
acids, and while its structure is generally similar to that of humic acid it
has a smaller proportion of aromatic
units and greater number of peripheral
aliphatic chains. Carboxyl functional
groups appear to be more evident in
fulvic acid than humic acid and are
probably heavily substituted on the
aliphatic chains.8

Fulvic and humic acids regulate
many of the processes associated with
soil development, and these same
processes are also associated with the
development of near surface hydrocarbon alteration anomalies.
The processes include movement of
halogens, fragmentation and integration
of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons,
pH buffering, oxidation and reduction
reactions, cation exchange capacity,
carbonate deposition, and the presence
and growth of soil flora and fauna.9
While carbohydrates are not part of
the core humic substances of soil, they
are the second most abundant organic
component in SOM. Carbohydrates are
also the most abundant class of organic
compounds found in living organisms.
They originate as products of photosynthesis and are a source of metabolic
energy, both for plants and animals that
depend on plants for food. Additionally,
carbohydrates also make up cellulose,
the structural material in plants. In soils,
carbohydrates participate in aggregation.14
Carbohydrates are by definition
polyhydroxy aldehydes, ketones, or
substances that yield one of these
compound by hydrolysis. Glucose and
fructose are examples of an aldose and
a ketose, respectively. Acid hydrolysis is usually employed to release the

monosaccharides from polysaccharides.
Hydrolysis by water releases monosaccharides from disaccharides.10
Many simple sugars can exist in a
chain form or a ring form. The ring
form is favored in aqueous solution,
and the mechanism of ring formation

is similar for most sugars. The glucose ring forms when the oxygen on
carbon number 5 links with the carbon
comprising the carbonyl group (carbon
number 1) and transfers its hydrogen to
the carbonyl oxygen to create a hydroxyl group (Fig. 2).

A reducing sugar is any sugar that,
in basic solution, forms some aldehyde
or ketone. Since sugars occur in a chain
as well as a ring structure, it is possible to have an equilibrium between
these two forms. When the aldehyde
or ketone group is free (not linked to
another sugar molecule), it is available
for reducing Copper(II) ions. When a
sugar is oxidized, its carbonyl group
(aldehyde or ketone) is converted to a
carboxyl group.

Because they are soluble through a
large pH range, water extracted altered
fulvic acids (AFA) are placed in solution
and measured using UV-Vis spectroscopy.
AFAs are located in the halo position
due to preferential binding of calcium
to the oxygen containing carboxylic
and phenolic groups in fulvic acids.
Forming Ca-humates renders AFAs
resistant to further decomposition by
enveloping them in a carbonate film.

Altered humic acids (AHA) are soluble only at high pH and are therefore
present in the high pH halo position of
a seepage anomaly.
These are larger molecules containing more C and less O than fulvic acid.
Due to structural similarities to fulvic
acid, humic acid will follow many of
the same physical and chemical models. The extracted hydrocarbon analysis
(EHA) exhibits low to moderate correlation with other geochemical methods
which may be related to the limited pH
range (Fig. 3).
The map of the EHA shows the two
productive wells centered inside the
halo low and the dry holes located near
or in the halo highs. As with the UV-Vis

are present on at least three sides (Fig.

The open aldehydes and ketones
are subsequently converted to carboxyls with the reduction of copper. The resulting colored solution is
measured spectrophotometrically and
an absorbance value is obtained. A high

(Fig. 3).
The map of the reduced hydrocarbon analysis (RHA) shows the two

Overall advantages
Soil gas sampling for hydrocarbon
detection has been a valuable exploration tool for many years, but with
the advent of these new hydrocarbon
detection methods the acquisition and
analysis has become simpler and more
cost effective. The advantages are:
• Sample depth, moisture content,
and temperature increases at sample
acquisition, sample preparation, and at
the time of analysis, are variables that
have been eliminated, resulting in more
consistent survey to survey comparisons.
• A larger range of hydrocarbons is
employed. Rather than using the standard homologous sequence provided
by gas chromatography, a larger set of
hydrocarbons with distinct characteristics can mapped and interpreted. AFAs
provide concentration data over a range
of wavelengths that can also be used to
characterize anomalies. AHAs provide a
look at the heavier ringed hydrocarbon,
and the carbohydrates yield anomalous concentrations that occur with
increased microbial activity that can be
associated with hydrocarbon microseepage.
• The correlation of the UV-Vis,
EHA, and RHA hydrocarbon methods
with other geochemical tools is moderate to good. Analysis of AFAs by UV-Vis
spectroscopy yields very high correlations when compared to hydrocarbon
analysis by standard gas chromatography. Correlation is in part, related to pH
range, number of reactive hydrocarbon
functional groups, and hydrocarbon
solubility.
• Sample cost is significantly reduced due to decreases in field time,
operation and maintenance of extra
field vehicles, and special handling of
samples. In the laboratory samples can
be processed more rapidly by spectroscopy, eliminating the long elution times
of standard gas chromatography.

China has large volumes of low-permeability natural gas resources
with unique characteristics that could be exploited with appropriate
Production
technologies. At present,
lack of development and
management technologies has hindered
effective exploitation of these resources.
The low-permeability gas resources
are distributed widely in the Ordos,
Sichuan, Tarim basins, as well in other
basins.

Resource estimates
In China, exploration efforts to date
have yielded the discovery of more than
30 large and medium-sized, low-permeability gas reservoirs. Proved reserves
are greater than 2 trillion cu m (about
70.6 tcf), accounting for more than half
the total proved natural gas reserves in
China.1
In Ordos basin, five large-scale lowpermeability gas fields (Sulige, Daniudi,
Jingbian, Yulin, and Wushenqi) have
proved reserves of more than 100 billion cu m each (see table). Xinchang
and Luodai are two large-scale, lowpermeability gas fields discovered in
Sichuan basin.2
The latest national oil and gas resource evaluation (NOGRE) released
in August 2008 shows that China has
56 trillion cu m of prospective natural gas resources, 35 trillion cu m of
geological resources (including proved
reserves and reserves not yet proved but
that could be produced with current
technology), and 22 trillion cu m of
recoverable resources.3
By applying a 20/80 rule,4 our
rough estimate is that the low-permeability portions of these resources are
44.8 trillion cu m, 28 trillion cu m, and
17.6 trillion cu m, respectively.
Fig. 1 shows the resource triangular
for natural gas in China. In 2007, lowpermeability gas production was more
than 20% of all natural gas produced in
China. Gas production in China during
2007 was 69.3 billion cu m, of which
13.9 billion cu m was from low-perme-

ability reservoirs.5
Low-permeability gas resources in
China have unique characteristics in
geology, development, and economics. Understanding these characteristics
is essential for determining the best
technical and economic strategies for
successful exploitation.

Resource characteristics
Most
low-permeability gas
reservoirs in
China have a
sedimentary
facies and include fluvial,
delta, or volcanic rock.
The physical property and distribution of reservoirs are the most important geological factors influencing
development of low-permeability gas
reservoirs. Pores and fractures in low
permeability reservoirs always have
irregular distribution and are poorly
connected by very narrow capillaries.
Fig. 2 compares the microscopic
sections of high permeability and lowpermeability sandstone.
Geological characteristics of lowpermeability gas reservoirs in China
include low porosity, deep depth, thin
reservoirs, and much heterogeneity.6
Due to the geological characteristics mentioned previously, the lowpermeability gas reservoirs in China are
characterized as followed:
• Well production capacity generally
is low and distributed unevenly.
• Producing pressure drop is always
large for stabilized production.
• Maintenance of stable production

drilling cost by up to 50-70%.12
Economic production of natural
gas from low-permeability reservoirs
requires reservoir stimulation, such as
hydraulic fracturing, to obtain adequate
producing rates.13 14 In China, fields that
have hydraulic fractured wells include
Bajiaochang, Xinchang, and Luodai gas
fields in the Sichuan basin and Sulige,
and Daniudi gas fields in the Ordos
basin.
Operators also have applied highenergy gas fracturing in developing the
tight sandstone gas reservoirs in west of
Sichuan.15
Overall, Chinese oil and gas companies have mastered a variety of effective
reservoir stimulation technologies; however, a gap with the world’s advanced
technology still exists. In particular, key
equipment and assorted technologies for
fracturing need improvements before
development of many low-permeability
reservoirs can proceed. ✦

General stratigraphy
The following is a brief description
of the general geological sequences
encountered in a typical RSH well, as
shown in Fig. 1:
• Sarvak (Mishrif) formation. The Sarvak
formation is a limestone. Some cherty
limestone beds may also be present in
the middle parts of the sequence. The
Mishrif member of the Sarvak formation constitutes a major oil-producing
reservoir in the RSH field. The “Sarvak

National Iranian Oil Co. plans for the
drilling contractor to use two jack up
drilling rigs to perform drilling activities. The satellite platform (W0) houses
only one rig at a time, but the main
(W4) platform can accommodate two
rigs at opposite sides of the platform if
required. Table 1 shows the wells proposed to be drilled.

Well trajectory proﬁle
After geologists and reservoir engineers identify drilling targets, it is the
drilling engineer’s job to design the
wellbore trajectory for these targets.
For the case of drilling wells in RSH oil
field, engineers must consider many
factors, such as collision, trajectory
geometric shape, true vertical depth
and horizontal departure, inclination
and azimuth, buildup rate, tortuosity,
and torque and drag.1 All these factors
should be evaluated together during
trajectory design.
The objective of this article is not
to optimize the well trajectory. Three
optimized well trajectory profile are
proposed for CPS problem and casing
points should be optimized for these.

profile II, III for optimizing casing

The expected value for the riskaverse case has the highest amount
but also displays the least variability
(standard deviation) of utility across the
three risks in Fig. 10.
Table 4 shows optimum intervals for
casing points in each section, the selection in these intervals depends on the
decision maker. We select the average of
upper and lower range of this interval
as final optimum points.
After a complete analysis of results
about objective function, we can define
an optimum interval to set casing
points, depending on decision-maker
risk attitude and different scenarios. The
worst-case and best-case geologic scenarios determine the upper and lower
bounds.
If we define other cases, we will find
an optimal solution between upper and
lower points. Points outside of this interval are not optimum; therefore, they
do not represent economical conditions.
Now we can calculate percentage
savings when the optimum solution
moves between two optimum points
(Table 5).
For example, in Well W0-02 we have
three different scenarios: A, B, C. The
optimum solution in this scenario had
a maximum 15.2% savings compared
with other scenarios for profit saving in

Table 2 shows how the cetane
number of the six blends reacts to an
increase in the cetane improver’s treating rate. These data show that the diesel
cetane number of studied blends is not
highly sensitive to cetane improvers.
All the investigated diesel blends
exhibited the same rate of increase in
cetane number with more cetane improver used.
The figure shows that the slope is
0.0028 for all blends, which means
that a cetane increase of 0.28 will result
with every 100-ppm cetane improver

tane improver: a cetane increase of 0.18
at 100 ppm additive rate.
These results differed considerably
from those reported by Morris (OGJ,
Dec. 3, 2007, p. 58). He reported
a cetane number increase of 1.2 at
100-ppm cetane improver 2EHN treating rate for a diesel with a base cetane
of 43.0.
Adding 25% LCO to the same base
diesel fuel reduced its cetane number to
36.9 from 43.0 and reduced the diesel
sensitivity to the cetane improver to 0.5
from 1.2 cetane numbers.
The difference in observations is
probably due to the type of crude processed. Obviously, middle distillate fractions from Ural crudes exhibit a lower
sensitivity to treatment with a cetane
improver and this sensitivity does not
change when treating a highly aromatic

FCC LCO.
This can explain some curious results—for example, adding 1,000-ppm
cetane improver to Blend 4 had no
effect. According to other results, Blend
4 should have increased 2.8 cetane
numbers.
In accordance with ASTM D-613,
the repeatability of cetane number
measurements was 0.9 and the reproducibility was between 3.3 and 4.8 for
the range of cetane numbers studied.
In some cases, cetane numbers of the
studied blends were measured in different laboratories; therefore, a difference
in the cetane number less than 3.3 may
not have been recorded.

INDEXES FOR REFINERY FUELS

Gary Farrar
Contributing Editor

Refinery fuels costs have endured an
unsteady course since 2005.
As shown in the accompanying
table, most of the Petroleum Administration Defense District (PADD) residual fuels’ increases in cost occurred
during 2005 and 2007 for all of the
five districts. PADD 4 experienced the
least variance while PADD 5 incurred
the highest variance in price over the
period.
The cost for natural gas for refinery
usage increased a fair amount through
2005 and then varied during 2006
and decreased in 2007. These conclu-

sions are based on costs of an average
refinery fuel consisting of 1 bbl each of
PADDs 1-5 and an average US cost of
4.4 MMscf natural gas (a 1 bbl equivalent on a BTU content basis).
Raw residual fuel oil and natural gas
prices come from publications put out
by the US Department of Labor.
Biggest variations occurred in PADDs

1, 3, and 5. PADD 4 increased over the
period in yearly average to 1,857.9
from 933.1.
While PADD 1’s 3-year averages
started with 1,185.4, they increased to
2,113.7 and then to 2,247.2.
All indexes shown are based on
1956 = 100, the basis of the NelsonFarrar Operating Index for an average
US refinery. ✦

Turkmenistan’s plan to connect
Mary’s gas fields to a potential Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas

resources, despite the relatively recent
discovery of the giant South Yolotan,

To ensure additional gas supplies
from Central Asia, Beijing has continued to develop energy relations with

Corp., a subsidiary of CNPC) formed
a joint venture in February 2008 to be
sole operator of the Kazakh section of
the Turkmenistan-China pipeline. TransAsia Gas Pipeline Ltd. formed similar
joint ventures with relevant Uzbek and
Turkmen gas companies to operate their
respective sections of the gas pipeline.

Kazakhstan-China Pipeline
The Western Kazakhstan-Western
China (Beyneu-Bozoy-Kyzylorda-Chimkent) gas pipeline will be 1,480 km
long and have a 1,016-1,067-mm OD
and a projected annual capacity of 10
billion cu m/year. This pipeline project,
first initiated in 2005, has undergone a
number of changes including its route
and annual capacity.
Kazakhstan and China initially
planned to build the pipeline along a
central route—Atyrau (Makat-Aktobe
(Zhanazhol)-Chelkar-Atasu-DostykAlashankou—with a capacity of 30
billion cu m/year, projected to reach
40 billion cu m/year by 2015. The
countries have since cut capacity to 10
billion cu m/year due to economics.
Complications and delays regarding
development of Kazakhstan’s Caspian
hydrocarbon resources (especially

AFGHANISTAN

Kashagan) initially cut into forecasts
regarding Kazakh gas output, affecting the planned pipeline’s capacity. A
preliminary cost estimate of $3.84 billion recouped over 30 years also caused
Chinese investors to pause, particularly
in light of additional estimates that gas
transported via this pipeline would
cost almost three times as much as gas
imported from Uzbekistan.
Two factors have likely driven the
change from the central route to the
current one: access to a larger number
of gas resources and the need to deliver
gas to southern Kazakhstan. Beyneu,
part of the CAC network and close to
Caspian hydrocarbon fields, provides
a better starting point than Atyrau.
Beyneu is also a connecting point to the
Okarem-Beyneu gas pipeline (473 km),
with access to the Caspian resources of
Turkmenistan.
Petronas modernized the Beyneu
pipeline, feeding into CAC-3 at a rate of
10 billion cu m/year.
KazTransGaz and Petronas Carigali
(Turkmenistan), an affiliate of Malaysia’s Petronas Carigali Overseas, signed a
memorandum of understanding in June
2006 covering transportation of natural
gas from Turkmenistan via Kazakhstan.

Petronas is developing hydrocarbon
fields in the Turkmen part of the Caspian having an estimated resource base
of 1 trillion cu m and recoverable gas
reserves as large as 545 billion cu m.
Petronas intends to produce 5 billion
cu m of gas from these fields in 2009
and build an offshore gas terminal by
2010 feeding into the Okarem-Beyneu
line at a rate of 10 billion cu m/year.
Kazmunaigaz intends to buy Turkmen gas from Petronas and transport
it to southern Kazakhstan and possibly
China.
Bozoy, on the Aral Sea, sits as another
strategic point on the proposed Western
Kazakhstan-Western China pipeline. Uzbek Aral gas reserves measure 0.5-1 trillion cu m. Uzbekistan signed a production sharing agreement in August 2006
between its state natural gas holding
company Uzbekneftegaz (Uzbekistan),
Lukoil (Russia), Petronas (Malaysia),
CNPC (China) and two Korean companies, KNOC and steel manufacturer
POSCO. All companies have an equal
share of 20% in the consortium, except
for Korea’s 20% stake which is divided
between KNOC (10.2%) and POSCO
(9.8%).
CNPC and Petronas’s participation
in the consortium could secure gas
supplies from the Aral fields for the
new pipeline, an idea also backed by
Uzbekistan. Aral Sea gas production is
scheduled to start by 2012, eventually
reaching a peak of about 25 billion cu
m/year. Kazakhstan’s own gas from
fields in Aktobe province could also
travel through the new pipeline. China’s
main gas asset in Kazakhstan, Zhanazhol
field, also lies in Aktobe province.
Running the pipeline through
Kyzylorda could connect potential gas
output from Kumkol hydrocarbon fields
at Akshabulak to market. Russian Lukoil
and CNPC are jointly developing these
resources, with gas production reaching 119 million cu m in 2006. Lukoil
and CNPC signed a strategic partnership
agreement in September 2007 to bring
gas to China from Kumkol.
Apart from potential exports to China, the pipeline will improve supplies

to the central, eastern, and southern
parts of Kazakhstan; particularly Kyzylorda, South Kazakhstan, Zhambyl, and
Almaty provinces. Domestic consumption in this area will reach 6-7 billion
cu m/year by 2015, 8.5 billion cu m/
year by 2020, and as much as 10 billion
cu m/year if a gas pipeline network is
constructed in Almaty province. This
plan will turn the main gas routes of
central Kazakhstan into a unified system
and provide the country with greater
flexibility in supplying gas to different
markets and making location swaps.
Kazakhstan will first connect the CAC
and Bukhara-Ural gas trunklines. It will
then, according to an agreement with
Russia to send gas from Karachaganak
to the Orenburg gas processing plant,
build an interconnector pipeline between the Soyuz, Orenburg-Novopskov,
and CAC trunk pipelines, supplying
Caspian gas to the industrial and urban
centers in the southern part of the
country.
Kazakhstan views the pipeline to
China as an energy security project,
ensuring its domestic gas demand can
be met without relying on imports.
Prime Minister Karim Masimov says the
government is examining three options for financing the project: full state
financing; soliciting a loan to Kazmunaigaz, guaranteed by the state; and a
state-private partnership.7
CNPC and Kazmunaigaz signed a
preliminary agreement in early November 2008 covering construction of the
Western Kazakhstan-Western China gas
pipeline, with 5 billion cu m/year of
gas to be sent to China and roughly 5
billion cu m/year for use in southern
Kazakhstan.8
Previous agreements call for pipeline
construction to begin in 2010 and be
completed in two stages by 2015. Initial
Kazakh gas exports to China will rely
on gas produced by CNPC at Zhanazhol
field.9 ✦

New service helps upstream operations track stock
StockNet, one of a new generation
of web-based reporting services for the
industry’s upstream operations, is designed
to transform the way stock is tracked.
Features include simplicity, ease, and
speed of use. Training rarely takes more
than 15 min, and it can enable users to
raise a manifest in 2 or 3 min, the company points out.
StockNet is designed to incorporate all
logistics information and make it easy to
share and transfer. Its master equipment
list can be shared, and all the information can be viewed offshore, in advance.
The purchasing tool allows users to raise
purchase orders, while a link to the firm’s
CostNet service allows invoice generation.
The drag and drop facility to build manifests and load-out lists helps eliminate the
time spent creating multiple spreadsheets
and the errors associated with cutting and
pasting.
The system incorporates a rental register and even flags up a reminder if items

remain on hire for longer than intended.
Being web-based, StockNet is easy to share
with vendors and partners and can be used
as a stand-alone system or as part of a
wider package while background synchronization helps ensure that all nodes of the
service are up to date, the company says.
It is also possible within StockNet to
scan the certification documentation and
attach it to the inventory list right at the
line item level.
The service allow users to be given different rights of access through secure and
personalized accounts. All data are stored
and backed up on remote servers and are
easily recoverable, the firm notes.

The webcast will be based on the annual Forecast and Review
special report appearing this year in the January 19th issue of
Oil & Gas Journal. The Forecast and Review projects oil and gas
demand worldwide and in the US for the new year. The US forecast
analyzes demand by petroleum product (such as gasoline, diesel,
jet fuel, and so forth). The Forecast and Review includes forecasts
for US and Canadian drilling activity.
In addition to the 2009 forecast, the webcast will include past
predictions compared with actual performance and industry trends
for the previous four years. Bob Tippee, Editor, will make the presentation, with Marilyn Radler, Senior Editor-Economics, and G. Alan
Petzet, Chief Editor-Exploration, on hand for questions. Marilyn

Forecasts for oil
prices depend on
economic outlook
Guess the question from the answer: It
all depends on the global economy.
If you work in the oil and gas business,
you haven’t been paying attention to developments around you if you didn’t respond
with this: When will oil prices quit falling?
Marker crude prices dropped below $40/
bbl this week after two developments that
normally would strengthen oil values.
In the ﬁrst of those developments, the

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced its biggest production cut
ever. If fully implemented, the action would
remove enough oil from the market to avert
a catastrophic inventory build.
But OPEC members seldom implement
production cuts fully. That partly explains
why crude prices fell after OPEC’s announcement.
In the other development that normally
might boost crude prices, the US Federal
Reserve cut the interest rate on interbank
loans to almost nothing. The dollar’s value
plunged. Buying a barrel of oil should
require more dollars than before. But oil
prices still fell.
The oil market, at the expense of everything else, seems focused on demand
and its relationship to the global economy.
Rightly so. The economy looks grim.
Indeed, assumptions about economic
growth drive predictions for average oil
demand in 2009.
Three important forecasting entities differ interestingly in predictions published in
December. The International Energy Agency
sees a slight gain in average 2009 demand
for oil, to 86.3 million b/d.
The US Energy Information Administration and OPEC both see slight declines. The
lower of those two forecasts is EIA’s: 85.3
million b/d. That larger-than-usual 1 million
b/d difference reﬂects the uncertainty now
terrorizing traders.
It largely results from divergent assumptions for economic growth: 2.1% for
IEA, which uses the International Monetary
Fund’s projection; 0.5% for EIA; and 1.5%
for OPEC.
IEA points out, “Should the recession
prove to be more prolonged than expected,
this [demand] prognosis could be further
revised down.”
The obverse, though, is worth considering: With supply limits in place and the
dollar down, early economic recovery—unexpected, yes, but not out of the question—
would jerk oil prices back up quicker and by
more than anyone now thinks possible.

Demand and prices fall
Even as a winter storm dumped snow and ice on the US Midwest and East Coast
during Christmas week, markets remained unconvinced the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries can cut production fast enough to offset plummeting
demand for oil.
“The colder weather continues to take a backseat to economic concerns, which
are now weighing heavily on industrial and power generation demand,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. “Two of the world’s
biggest oil importers reported signiﬁcant year-over-year declines in oil demand.
Japan, the world’s third biggest oil importer, reported its November crude imports
were down 17% from the previous year, and South Korea, the world’s ﬁfth biggest
importer, reported that its oil consumption was down 12% in November.”
In New Orleans, Pritchard Capital Partners LLC analysts reported Abu Dhabi verbally informed India’s Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd. to expect a cut in oil supplies in
January, while Saudi Arabia and Kuwait had not yet issued similar notices. Meanwhile, crude production by Petroleos Mexicanos fell 6.5% from year-ago levels in
November. Pemex reduced its 2008 production outlook for the third time, down 3.6%
due to disruptions by hurricanes and the faster-than-expected decline of Cantarell
ﬁeld.
Demand outlook
On the natural gas front, Pritchard Capital analysts said, “The gas market seems
poised to reset itself,” in a process that includes shutting in some production and
more than a 30% drop in the number of active land rigs in the US. They see “a 4-6
month lag time before recent well decline rates translate into production volume
decreases. We may see gas prices around $5/Mcf before things get better.”
Pritchard Capital also perceives a shift from a supply-constrained market to a
demand-constrained market for LNG. “Global LNG prices on the spot market seem
to be stabilizing [at] $8-9/MMbtu in the Atlantic Basin and in the $11-12 range in the
Paciﬁc Basin.” With prices at the Henry Hub, La., spot market “well below the prices
a year ago,” LNG terminals at Lake Charles, La., and at Sabine Pass and Freeport in
Texas remain inactive, analysts said.
Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, observed, “With the low oil prices
and the low reﬁning margins, the process of supply destruction is already in the
works, and this is further evidenced by the falling trend of rotary rig utilization. Most
of Wall Street is now targeting $30/bbl for West Texas Intermediate, a level which
will only accelerate the supply destruction process in North America, making the US
more dependent on ‘foreign oil.’” More important, low oil prices “will be destroying
production capacity, which will then allow for a reversal trade,” Jakob said.
He added, “The [futures market] price of corn or soybean is holding much better
than gasoline or heating oil, the ethanol processing margins are in the red, and the
current oil prices also question the sustainability of biofuels in the supply and demand equation. The retail price of gasoline in the US is at the lowest level since early
2004 and with the gasoline crack giving back some of its recent gains, there should
be some more improvement in the pump price for the US customer.”
Paul Horsnell, Barclays Capital Inc., London, said, “Although the pace of decline
in commodity prices has slowed in December, we believe there is still downside
risk to prices should ﬁnancial markets remain unstable, the dollar continue to
strengthen, and global growth projections continue to suffer cuts. Signiﬁcant portions of existing output are unable to cover cash costs at current prices and output
cuts are being rapidly enacted alongside the deferral of large numbers of new
projects that have become very difﬁcult to ﬁnance in the current environment. The
damage being done to the supply side suggests prices could recover rapidly once
the mood of pessimism surrounding global growth prospects starts to clear. We
expect price volatility to stay elevated by historical standards as liquidity is thin,
short positions in a number of markets are large and the potential for both demand
and supply shocks is high.”
Horsnell said, “We are in the midst of the most severe global recession since at
least the early 1980s, if not the Great Depression. It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd an economy
anywhere in the world that is not being hit hard, and the downward momentum
underway virtually ensures that activity will continue to fall signiﬁcantly through ﬁrst
quarter. The baseline Barclays Capital forecast expects the economic contraction to
ﬁnd a bottom around mid-year, but the recovery to be well below par.”

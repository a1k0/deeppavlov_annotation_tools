COVER
Over the past 30 years, the relationship between international oil
companies and national oil companies has changed greatly. Where
IOCs once dominated global exploration and production activities
because of their expertise and advanced technologies, today NOCs
control as much as 94% of global oil and gas reserves. Although
there remain many joint ventures between NOCs and IOCs, there
are more and more attempts to relegate IOCs to the position of
hired contractors or to replace them with oil services firms.The
article starting on p. 24—OGJ’s special report on Oil Company
Evolution—examines some of the challenges IOCs face today and
actions they can take to maintain competitiveness.

General

Interest

FERC issues ﬁrst ROE order incorporating MLPs
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a Kern
River Gas Transmission Co. settlement on Jan. 15 in its first returnon-equity (ROE) order under its 2008 policy statement.
The commission found that Kern River’s 12.5% ROE was excessive and would result in unjust and unreasonable rates. It determined that the ROE rate should be 11.55% based on the record
established in a paper hearing on ROE established in an April 2008
order.
“The reason for including master limited partnerships [MLPs]
in setting a proxy group is to assure an adequate sample for determining a pipeline’s ROE and to obtain consistent regulatory results.
The commission’s role is to balance the interests of investors while
protecting the ratepayer from excessive rates, and we have done so
with this order,” said FERC Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher.
FERC said the latest order also denied a request for rehearing,
and rejected a contested settlement filed by Kern River, a subsidiary
of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co.
FERC said the allowed ROE rate was set at the median of a proxy
group that included both MLPs and corporations in a pipeline rate
proceeding for the first time. Based on its analysis, it said it determined that the ROEs for the five firms selected for the proxy group
yielded a range of reasonable returns at 8.8-13%, with an 11.55%
median ROE.
FERC directed Kern River to cancel its interim rates filed with
the settlement and made effective on Oct. 1, and to make a revised
compliance filing using an 11.55% ROE within 45 days of the new
order. FERC also directed the interstate natural gas pipeline company to recapture interim refunds at the earliest possible date as
required by the settlement.

Midstream JV planned for Marcellus shale
MarkWest Energy Partners LP and NGP Midstream & Resources
LP plan to form a natural gas midstream services joint venture in
the Marcellus shale.
Terms call for MarkWest to be operator and to own 60% of the
JV. MarkWest will contribute $100 million of existing Marcellus
assets to the venture.
NGP will invest the next $200 million of capital, which approximates the capital required to finance the project in 2009.

Exploration

&

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Capital funding for 2010-11 will be driven by producer drilling
programs.
Finalization of the JV remains subject to customary closing conditions.
MarkWest already provides Marcellus shale midstream services,
including gathering and processing services for Range Resources
Corp. in southwest Pennsylvania. By yearend, the midstream joint
venture is expected to be capable of processing up to 240 MMcfd
of gas for Range and other producers.

PNG LNG submits EIS, gathers public input
The ExxonMobil Corp.-led PNG LNG project group has taken
another step towards development with the submission this week
of its environmental impact statement to Papua New Guinea’s Department of Environment and Conservation.
The 6,000-page tome draws on 26 supporting studies that took
just over 18 months to complete. Planning began in April 2007
while field studies and data collection were carried out between
November 2007 and July 2008.
The consortium also conducted two public consultation road
shows in 2007-08 that each visited 35 villages throughout the proposed 700-km pipeline and infrastructure imprint.
The project venture’s manager Peter Graham says the intention
is to mitigate impacts on the environment and on affected communities by planning, building, and operating according to good
industry practice as well as adhering to applicable government requirements and international environmental standards.
Following receipt and initial review of the document, the department will conduct a further public consultation road show in
the next few months to canvas community feedback. Public release
of the EIS is expected next month.
The PNG LNG Project involves construction of a two-train, 6.23
million tonne/year liquefaction plant near Port Moresby, with gas
sourced from several fields in the southern highlands.
Interest holders are ExxonMobil with 41.6%, Oil Search 34.1%,
Santos 17.7%, and Nippon Oil 4.5%. Landowner interests hold the
remaining interests.
PNG’s state-owned Independent Public Business Corp. is using
its 17.56% holding in Oil Search to raise $1.68 million (Aus.) to
fund the government’s 19.4% of the project which, once applied,
will reduce the interest held by the other partners. ✦

bbl of oil, 34,000 bbl of NGL, and 260 MMcf of gas. A gas processing plant is expected to start up in February 2009, enabling the first
major production volumes from the play.

Addax reports oil discovery in Nigeria
Addax Petroleum Corp., Calgary, plans to drill a downdip appraisal well to a two-zone oil discovery on the eastern OML 124
license in Imo state 105 km north of Port Harcourt, Nigeria.
The Njaba-2 well, formerly Okaka, cut four oil-bearing reservoirs that total 289 ft of gross oil column. The two main intervals
are 149 ft and 115 ft thick at 990-1,050 m and contain 20-28°
gravity oil. The license has facilities for early production.
Addax, with 100% working interest in the license in which Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. is the concessionaire, continued
drilling into secondary, lower sections. It plans to test the main
reservoirs.
Njaba-2 is OML 124’s first exploration well since the mid1980s.
Addax produces 6,000 b/d from Ossu and Izombe fields in
OML 124.

Repsol YPF hits gas in Algeria’s Sahara Desert
Several natural gas discoveries in Algeria’s Regane and Ahnet basins could prove to be important future resources for Repsol YPF
SA.
After drilling exploration well KLS-1, it tested the isolated Kahlouche Sud structure in the North Reggane concession, and gas
flowed at 629,000 cu m/day at a depth of 3,720 m through a
32
⁄64-in. choke.
Meanwhile, discovery well OTLH-2, drilled in the M’Sari Akabli
concession, flowed on test 249,000 cu m/day of gas at a depth of
1,280 m, and 110,000 cu m/day of gas at 1,340 m; both flowed
through 32⁄64-in. chokes, said RWE Dea AG, a consortium partner.
This new independent structure was the first discovery on this
block and was in its center.
The wells were drilled in Algeria’s Sahara Desert and proved
there is gas flow from the Lower Devonian level.
Repsol YPF said the Reggane basin is a major driver for future
growth and its holdings add up to total net reserves of 145 million boe.
The consortium secured exploration rights during the 2002-03
Algerian bidding rounds. During 2005-07, three discoveries were
made in Reggane: Sali-1 (SLI-1), Kahlouche-2 (KL-2), and Reggane-6 (RG-6); one exploration well in Upper Ordovician, plus
two positive appraisal wells.
Repsol YPF operates the consortium with a 33.75% stake, and
RWE Dea has a 22.5% interest. Other partners are Sonatrach with
25% and Edison SPA with 18.75%.

Apache ﬁnds three ﬁelds in Egypt’s Western Desert
Apache Corp., Houston, reported three field discoveries in
Egypt’s Western Desert that tested a total of 80 MMcfd of natural gas and 5,909 b/d of oil and condensate from Jurassic formations.
“Apache plans to continue an exploration and appraisal program in 2009 to capitalize on these successes,” said G. Steven Farris, Apache president and chief executive officer.
The Sultan-3x well is an oil field find in the Khalda Offset concession, 7 miles south of Apache’s Imhotep field. The well encountered oil pay in the Jurassic Alam El Buieb (AEB-6) and Safa formations. It test-flowed 5,021 b/d of oil and 11 MMcfd of gas from
three commingled intervals in the Safa formation.
The discovery opens up a large area for further exploration and
appraisal drilling on Apache-operated acreage south and east of
the well. The Egyptian minister of petroleum approved a 20-block
development lease, and production is expected to commence in
February. Apache has 100% contractor interest in the Khalda Offset
concession.
Adam-1x and Maggie-1x discovered gas-condensate fields on
the Matruh development lease north of the Sultan discovery. Adam1x is in the center of the Matruh lease about 31⁄2 miles south of
Apache’s Alexandrite field. Wireline logs indicate as much as 102 ft
of gas pay in the Jurassic Safa formation. A test of an interval in the
Lower Safa produced 28.5 MMcfd of dry gas.
Maggie-1x, 5 miles northeast of Adam-1x, was drilled to test
closures at three levels in the AEB and Safa formations. The well
logged 27 ft of pay in the Cretaceous Alam El Bueib (AEB-3D)
formation and 83 ft of pay in the Jurassic Zahra and Safa formations. Preliminary results of tests of an interval in the Lower Safa
formation measured gas at a rate of 40 MMcfd with associated
condensate production of 884 b/d. Apache has 100% contractor
interest in the Matruh development lease.

More Rajasthan discoveries commercial
India’s government has approved a commerciality declaration
for three 2007 gas and oil discoveries by Cairn Energy PLC in Rajasthan, northwestern India.
The declaration covers the Kameshwari West 2, 3, and 6 discoveries and an 822 sq km development area that was part of the
northern appraisal area on the RJ-ON-90/1 license (see map, OGJ,
Jan. 23, 2006, p. 38).
Cairn Energy noted that the No. 2 and 3 discoveries opened a
new play in the Paleocene Barmer Hill-Lower Dharvi Dungar sands
on the basin’s western margin.
Kameshwari West-2, some 56 km south of Mangala oil field,
cut 18.2 m of net pay in a 40-m gross interval of Lower Dharvi
Dungar with a gas-oil contact at 1,127 m true vertical depth subsea
and an oil-water contact at 1,147 m TVD ss. It flowed 33° gravity
oil with gas.
Kameshwari West-3, just 10.6 km north of Kameshwari West-2,
cut up to 16 m of gas pay in tight Lower Dharvi Dungar reservoir
rock in a potential column of more than 100 m. TD is 1,499 m
measured depth.
Kameshwari West-6, about 22 km northeast of Kameshwari
West-3, tested 2.39 MMscfd of gas.

Platform operations start up off China

Talisman starts gas production from Rev ﬁeld

Operations have begun on Production Platform B, part of Peng
Lai (PL) 19-3 Blocks’ Phase 2 project in China’s Bohai Bay. ConocoPhillips is operator of PL 19-3, which currently is China’s largest
offshore oil field. Its partner, China National Offshore Oil Corp.
(CNOOC), holds 51% interest in Block PL 19-3, and ConocoPhillips holds the remainder.
Platforms D and E are expected to come on line in 2009 to
boost development of the oil field off China’s northeastern coast.
Fluor Corp. assisted in the successful startup of the platform
and provided engineering services, including conceptual engineering, front-end engineering and design, and detailed engineering.
The company also provided procurement services for three wellhead platforms and construction support in fabrication yards in
Shanghai, Tanggu, and Singapore. Engineering and procurement
were performed from Fluor’s global execution centers in Houston,
Shanghai, and Manila.
The oil field development project is 235 km southeast of Tanggu and began in 1999 with conceptual and feasibility engineering.
The first phase of the project involved the basic design package for
the early production facility, which consisted of a fixed production
platform tied to a newly modified and refurbished floating production, storage, and offloading vessel.
The project was executed in two phases. The second phase, carried out simultaneously with the first, included development of
what Fluor described as the “world’s largest” floating production,
storage, and offloading vessel and five additional fixed production
platforms tied to a central fixed riser and utility platform. Workers
installed 36 miles of subsea pipeline to interconnect the facilities.
Fluor designed the flow lines so early production could be routed
to the existing FPSO vessel. After the new FPSO is delivered, the
flow lines will be reconnected for permanent installation.

Talisman Energy Norge AS has started natural gas and condensate production from Rev field in the Norwegian North Sea.
The field was expected to start production last July via a subsea
9-km tieback to the Armada platform in the UK North Sea, operated by BG International (CNS) Ltd., for processing and final export
to the UK. Rev’s plateau rate will be 100 MMcfd of gas and 6,000
b/d of condensate from two subsea wells. The development plan
cost $444 million in 2007 money.
“A third producer, the Rev East well, is expected to be brought
on stream later in 2009,” Talisman said. Its share of proved and
probable reserves in the field at yearend 2007 was estimated at 26
million boe, with proved reserves of 16 million boe.
Recoverable reserves are estimated at 3.9 billion cu m of gas and
600,000 cu m of condensate.
Talisman has a 70% interest in the field, with Norway’s stateowned Petoro AS holding the remaining 30%.

Venezuela denies rift with Brazil over reﬁnery
Venezuela has denied any rift with Brazil over the construction,
operation, or supply of the Abreu e Lima refinery in Pernambuco
state, a project 60% owned by Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras)
and 40% by Petroleos de Venezuela SA.
Rafael Ramirez, Venezuela’s oil minister, said there has been no
conflict with Brazil regarding the refinery project despite earlier
statements by Petrobras downstream director Paulo Roberto Costa
(OGJ Online, Jan. 22, 2009).
Ramirez, who called Costa’s comments “the opinion of a lowlevel official,” said Venezuela has not been notified of any changes

Nexen’s upgrader turns out sweet crude oil
Nexen Inc.’s Long Lake, Alta., oil sands upgrader has started production.
The upgrader is expected to reach its full design production rate
of 60,000 b/d of sweet crude within 12-18 months, Nexen said.
As the upgrader ramps up to full capacity, the company expects
routine downtime periods as it works through early production
stages. Sour crude is upgraded to light sweet crude oil and the asphaltenes are converted to a synthetic fuel gas. This gas is available
as a low-cost fuel source and as a source for hydrogen required in
the hydrocracker.
The gas will be burned in a cogeneration plant to produce steam
for the assisted gravity drainage operations and for electricity to be
used on site and sold to the electric grid. ✦

The refinery is expected to start processing 200,000 b/d of oil,
half from Venezuela and half from Brazil, by 2010, but Costa had
said the two countries have disagreed on the price of the heavy
Venezuelan crude that would supply the refinery.
The reports from Venezuela coincided with news Petrobras has
authorized Phase 2 in the construction of the Abreu e Lima refinery, calling for construction of the facility’s 150-Mw electric power
plant at a cost of $408.2 million.
Meanwhile, dismissing concerns over the global financial crisis,

facilities that Petrobras will bring on stream in the near future.
“I’m happy every time I hear of refinery investments being
postponed around the world. I want them all to be postponed.
The world will continue to exist,” Costa said. “It is hard to believe
the world will be in a recession until 2013. It doesn’t make much
sense.”
Costa noted Petrobras doesn’t want to be an exporter of oil, but
an exporter of products. “There’s a world diesel shortage,” he said,
adding, “It is short-sighted to think there won’t be market for this
supply.” Costa also said $2 billion should be added to Petrobras’s
investments in refineries, to adapt them for the production of lowsulfur diesel.
Costas named the new refineries as the 230,000 b/d Abreu e
Lima facility, the 150,000 b/d Comperj facility, the 600,000 b/d
Premium I facility in Maranhao, the 300,000 b/d Premium II facility in Ceara, and the 30,000 b/d unit in Rio Grande do Norte.

CSB gives more details about Utah reﬁnery ﬁre
The US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board provided more details about a Jan. 12 refinery fire near Salt Lake City
as its investigators prepared to return to the plant on Jan. 27.
The fire in Tank 105 of the Silver Eagle refinery in Woods Cross
seriously burned four workers. The atmospheric storage tank was

almost full when a large vapor cloud was released and ignited at
about 5:30 p.m. MST, causing a massive flash fire, CSB said on Jan.
26.
CSB said that, on the night of the incident the tank was nearly
full, containing about 440,000 gal of what the refinery said was
light naphtha. The federal agency said the tank has an interior floating room and has six atmospheric vents on the top sides of its
exterior roof.
Investigations Supervisor Don Holmstrom said the CSB team
will examine a reported history of releases from the tank and the
tank seal’s integrity. “We will also be looking at the operation of the
refinery and any recent process changes to determine why highly
volatile hydrocarbons were released on Jan. 12,” he said.
Tank 105 was receiving up to three different streams of hydrocarbon liquids from the refinery, including light substances at the
time of the incident, he added.
CSB said its investigators were at the refinery for 2 weeks, conducting about 30 interviews of witnesses, gathering samples and
evidence, and examining the accident scene. It said the refinery’s
staff and management have cooperated with the investigation, and
that the CSB team was coordinating with investigators from Utah’s
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the South Davis
Metro Fire Agency. ✦

Pipeline would ship Haynesville shale gas

Regency cites Haynesville expansion progress

A pipeline company and a producer launched plans to build a
178-mile, 42-in. pipeline in East Texas and Northwest Louisiana to
serve the Jurassic Haynesville gas shale play.
Meanwhile, the producer, Chesapeake Energy Corp., Oklahoma
City, said the Haynesville has the potential to become the largest
producing field in the US.
Chesapeake said its last seven horizontal Haynesville wells averaged 16 MMcfd of gas equivalent on initial production or tests. The
two most recent wells tested at more than 22 MMcfd.
The company plans to average 25 rigs in the play in 2009, up
from 20 rigs currently.
Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP), Dallas, and Chesapeake Energy Marketing Inc. plan to lay the Tiger Pipeline from Carthage,
Tex., to near Delhi, La. The project will connect to ETP’s dual 42-in.
pipeline near Carthage and would connect to at least seven interstate pipelines at various points in Louisiana.
Capacity would be at least 1.25 bcfd initially and could be raised
to 2 bcfd based on results of an open season.
Chesapeake, largest gas producer in the US, committed a firm 1
bcfd for 15 years to the project, which is to cost $1-1.2 billion and
be in service by mid-2011 pending regulatory approvals.
Separately, Cubic Energy Inc., Dallas, accepted a proposal to
participate with 2.8% working interest in Chesapeake’s Clingman
Acres-11H horizontal well in Johnson Branch field, Caddo Parish,
La. It is to go to Haynesville shale at 17,000 ft measured depth.
Cubic, which is exploiting several geologic formations, has 12
wells producing in its Johnson Branch acreage, and 10 wells producing in its more southern acreage position of Bethany-Longstreet
field in DeSoto Parish.

Regency Energy Partners LP, Dallas, said it has negotiated definitive agreements with shippers for 800 MMcfd or more than 70%
of the capacity of its Haynesville gas pipeline expansion project in
North Louisiana.
The company’s existing system extends 320 miles from Waskom,
Sligo, and Elm Grove fields near Shreveport to connections with interstate and intrastate pipelines near Winnsboro in Franklin Parish.
The agreements are for firm transportation capacity under
10-year contracts and are subject to conditions including final approval by Regency’s board.
Regency said it is in advanced discussions with other shippers
who have requested transport volumes that exceed the remaining
capacity.
The company also said it has eliminated its obligation for the
purchase of 28 miles of 24-in. pipe no longer needed for the revised 1.1 bcfd expansion.
The $650 million revised expansion calls for 128 miles of
36-42-in. pipe and 12,500 hp of compression.
The major milestone for the project is to finalize financing arrangements. Regency is working with GE Energy Financial Services
to secure funding. If financing is obtained, the expansion is to be
in service by the end of 2009.
Meanwhile, Regency is acquiring rights of way and environmental permits and clearances. A construction contractor is committed to the project, and 98% of the route has been selected and
surveyed.
Regency has $230 million of purchase commitments related to
the expansion. ✦

After the chill
There is no doubt that while sea surface temperatures are rising and glaciers
around the world are receding, as far as
the global economy is concerned, we
are in for a big chill. But no matter what
the cause of atmospheric heating, the oil
industry seems to be putting all plans for
future growth in the deep freeze. But the
longer they are in there, the more they
will suffer from freezer burn – obsolescence.
To stop this self-destructive downward spiral oil producers and refiners
ought to be thawing those frozen plans
for improvements squirreled away in the
freezer. Even the worst depression will
ultimately bottom out, and there will
inevitably be a climb upward again. The
ones who begin that climb first, slow
and strenuous though it be, will also be
the first to benefit in whatever form the
new world economy will take.
Those who look to government
instead of industry to solve our present
economic ills are bound to be disappointed. Democracies, well-meaning
and well-directed though they may be,
are hamstrung by the vagaries of free
elections: Good administrations as well
as bad can be voted out of office, and
with them, whatever good projects have
been begun. And authoritarian states
will never make real progress but only
batten on advances made in democratic
societies.
Industry must do as much or more
than government. And it is up to the
petroleum industry, the only one with
the proven experience in mounting
long-term projects and the vision and
courage to take on work of truly global
scope, that can lead. It’s one of the few
industries that need not come begging
for bailouts if indeed it still possesses the
strength, self-reliance, and sheer guts of
the original oil patch.

The cost of energy anxiety
The US list of latter-day energy anxieties has a
new item: labor. With Americans losing jobs faster
than at any time in decades, the Obama administration proposes to make work by spending heavily on noncommercial energy. The products of this
binge will be called “green jobs.”
Reasons for the recent proliferation of energy
worries vary: environmental alarm; the Sept. 11,
2001, terrorist attacks; the oil-price zoom that
ended last July. Earlier, energy received too little
attention in national politics. Now the government
acts like it wants to make up for lost time.
The concerns beget hopes that beget policy
proposals that need assessment more systematic
than what they’re receiving. Policy initiatives in
an area as important as energy must be viewed in
relation to and in combination with one another.
They also need to be feasible and affordable. The
sooner the country realizes that most current proposals having to do with energy can’t pass those
tests, the better.

The leading anxieties
In addition to labor, the leading energy anxieties in the US are global warming, energy security,
and depletion of oil and gas resources. The concerns have given rise to policy hopes that include
reduction of carbon emissions, energy independence, and accelerated development of nondepleting—renewable—energy sources.
The labor initiative proceeds from the Keynesian assumption that governments can create jobs
by spending massive amounts of public money.
Not all economists agree with this proposition,
which nevertheless propels Washington’s panicky
response to the current, genuinely frightening
recession.
History will judge efficacy of the Keynesian
response overall. More immediately, common
sense should make leaders question job creation
linked to uneconomic energy. Profits create jobs;
the forced use of uncompetitive energy erodes
profits—or worse—for everyone except producers of the coddled energy forms. Jobs created by
profligate energy spending will burden energy
users and taxpayers with costs that destroy jobs
elsewhere in the economy.
The attempt to mitigate global warming with
carbon taxation disguised as a cap-and-trade
22

scheme might work no better. The costly cuts
envisioned for carbon dioxide emissions will
have little or perhaps no effect on global average
temperature. The US is on the verge of adopting
them because of pressure to act urgently, even if
the urgency is unfounded, and even if the cost will
be stupendous.
Energy independence, for its part is more
slogan than meaningful policy goal. In a world
of international commerce, energy independence
doesn’t exist. Even a country able to produce all
the energy it uses depends on internationally traded energy as long as its trading partners do. This is
a fact of modern economic life to which the US,
which has no hope of domestically producing all
the energy it needs, must become comfortable. The
potential to waste public money in futile pursuit
of energy independence is great. What good is
energy independence to a fiscally feeble nation?
Worry about exhaustion of nonrenewable oil
and gas represents another weak peg on which to
hang energy policy. Oil and gas are finite resources. Cheaply available portions of those resources
are in obvious decline. But the outer limits of oil
and gas available in nature are nowhere in sight.
And technological advances make growing shares
of those resources economic to develop.

Growth constraint
What instead should guide energy policy is the
evident inability of oil deliverability to grow as fast
and by as much as the world sometimes needs it
to do. The constraint, by nature more financial and
political than geological, should enable renewable energy to find its economic footing. That’s the
opportunity government should promote, not the
premature displacement of petroleum.
Policies proposed in response to surging
anxieties about energy receive attention mostly
in isolation from one another. Assessment of cost
therefore occurs proposal by proposal, increasingly in line with the mystifying notion that all
government spending is somehow stimulative. In
total, however, the costs of subsidies and mandates
envisioned to address global warming, energy
security, depletion, and now labor are incalculable.
But they surely would be staggering—and exactly
what a staggering economy doesn’t need. ✦

In their effort to access hydrocarbons, international oil companies
(IOCs) face a major challenge: convincing national oil companies (NOCs) and
host governments that they provide
value beyond finding and producing oil
and gas.
In the 1970s, international oil companies held approximately 85% of the
world’s known hydrocarbon reserves.
These integrated majors
dominated the upstream
business as they crisscrossed the globe making deals and developing
oil and gas around the
world. Yet just 3 decades
later, the IOCs’ share of
reserves has plummeted to less than
10%, with industry estimates ranging
from 6% to 8%.
Today, NOCs—once relegated to
second-tier status behind their larger,
richer, more accomplished global peers,
the IOCs—control as much as 94%
of the world’s oil and gas reserves. As

ergy industry’s power structure. Today,
some NOCs rival the size and scope of
the largest independent majors; many
wield tremendous influence over current and potential partners. Some, in
fact, are competing directly against IOCs
for access to reserves in foreign markets.
At the same time, other market players in the global energy industry have
stepped up to take on roles previously
dominated by IOCs. Major oil field
services firms now have the global
reach and capability to provide in-depth
technical and project execution skills.
Private equity firms and sovereign
wealth funds offer the significant capital
necessary for today’s large-scale production efforts. And third-party marketers
provide distribution access.

Venezuela’s reversal

One well-documented recent example shines a penetrating light on the
new-found boldness of some NOCs. In
the early 1990s—with crude oil prices
below $20/bbl—Venezuela’s national
oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA
(PDVSA), was losing money on the lowquality, extra-heavy crude found in vast
amounts in the country’s Orinoco basin.

tionships with NOCs. The traditional
relationship between IOC and NOC
was, in many ways, a simple partnership of convenience. The NOC needed
help in developing reserves; the IOC
wanted access.
Today, however, there is a wide range
of economic, political, and social implications inherent in every IOC-NOC
discussion. Host governments are no
longer satisfied with purely commercial agreements, even those with very
favorable terms. They view the natural
resources of their countries as a tool for
financing social reform, boosting economic development, improving infrastructure, and creating jobs, along with
a host of other individualized needs.
Thus, the IOC that sharpens its ability to listen carefully and respond to
each government’s unique vision for its
resources and country as a whole will
be the one that gains a global reputation
as a “partner of choice.” Understanding
local customs and history and recognizing the host nation’s desire for its future
can be invaluable in crafting contractual
agreements that meet the country’s
expectations for its partnerships.
At the same time, IOCs that prove
their ability to develop local work forces—through education and training;
the support and use of local vendors
and contractors; and infrastructure development that underpins employment,
such as building schools and roads—
will no doubt receive strong attention
from NOCs seeking long-term partners.

The work force
IOCs also must not let their own
work-force development efforts lag.
In order to maintain their competitive
advantage over “single-role” players,
it is imperative that IOCs strengthen
their scientific, engineering, and project
management skills by hiring and training a new generation of employees. The
looming talent gap in the energy industry has been well documented, and it is
here that IOCs are most vulnerable to
competition.
The ability to plan and execute largescale, complex development projects
26

has long been a key differentiator for
IOCs, yet the world of top-quality
project managers with this level of skill
is small, and there is plenty of demand
for the services of these professionals.
At the same time, many of these highly
skilled employees are in their 50s or
beyond with retirement looming. The
IOCs that invest in developing the
“next-gen” talent pool will be leaders
in future partnership efforts.
The importance of human capital
cannot be overstated for energy firms
seeking a competitive advantage in the
coming years. Recruiting, training, and
retaining skilled technical employees
should be a major area of focus for every energy organization, and it should
receive the full attention of senior management. Outside expertise in planning
and implementing enterprise-wide
human capital programs—integrating
all facets of human resources, including
compensation, skill development and
training, and succession planning—
can be a valuable asset to major energy
companies seeking to implement longterm cultural changes that will attract
and retain employees.
Workers that are well versed in subjects such as local tax laws, deal structuring, financial requirements, customs,
and the political and business climate
can be extremely valuable to energy
companies doing business around the
globe. These types of advisory skills
complement companies’ in-house
knowledge and strengthen their ability
to construct agreements that benefit all
parties.

Listening and responding
To be successful in today’s environment, IOCs must demonstrate and
communicate that they seek long-term
partnerships with NOCs and possess an
organizational culture that is focused
on listening and responding to the full
range of host governments’ social and
economic needs.
IOCs must realize that investing in
and developing local work forces and
supporting economies are necessary
parts of doing business around the

world and that their ability to do so
is another competitive advantage over
smaller, single-service competitors.
In addition, IOCs must learn to
package the elements of their core value
proposition—technology, financial
resources, access to markets, project
execution expertise, and vertically integrated offerings—in innovative ways
that are customized to each market.
Adaptability is the watchword for future
contractual negotiations; the willingness to seek out balanced, “win-win”
agreements is key.
Meanwhile, IOCs must recognize
and respond to the looming talent
shortage in the energy industry by designing enterprise-wide human capital
programs that strengthen their ability to
attract, train, and retain key employees
who bring the skills and expertise that
NOCs need. And they must continue to
work to develop their in-country relationships with experts in tax, financing,
and other local financial and business
regulatory issues in order to negotiate from positions of knowledge and
understanding.
The global power shift is real, and it
has serious implications for the future
business prospects of IOCs. But those
that are willing to adapt to the shift—
and who do so quickly and successfully—will maintain their competitiveness and viability in the decades to
come. ✦

Clinton: Energy security a major US foreign policy element
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Energy security must be an important and integrated element of US foreign policy, US Secretary of State Hillary
R. Clinton said as the Senate considered
her nomination.
Noting that President Barack H.
Obama identified energy as one of his
top national security priorities during
his presidential campaign, Clinton said
she has considered energy security and
climate change among the most pressing challenges facing the US and the
world.
“These are issues on which I will
personally engage, and they will consistently receive high-level attention at the
[State] Department. I will work with
our friends and partners around the
world, who are facing the same challenges. I also intend to ensure that the
department works vigorously through
the interagency process on these issues,” she said in a written response to
questions Sen. Richard D. Lugar (RInd.) submitted to her following her
Jan. 13 confirmation hearing before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
In opening remarks at that hearing,
Lugar, the committee’s ranking minority member, said that Russia’s cutting off
natural gas supplies was only the most
recent example of how energy supply vulnerability constrains US foreign
policy options.
Lugar said he looked forward to supporting Obama’s efforts to reduce US
dependence on foreign oil. “Yet domestic reform alone will not be sufficient to
meet the global threats to our national
security, economic health, and climate.
In my judgment, energy security must
be at the top of our agenda with nearly
every country. Progress will require
personal engagement by the secretary of
state,” Lugar maintained.

The proposed Nabucco gas pipeline
could be a critical element in efforts
to diversify European energy supplies,
she observed. “Completing such an
expensive, complicated, multinational
project, however, will require painstaking alignment between commercial
and governmental actors. An essential
element of such a project will be the
commercial fundamentals. A successful
strategy to promote Nabucco or other
pipelines along the southern corridor to
European markets will require consistent, high-level engagement, including
by the United States,” Clinton said.
Turkey will be a critical partner in
such efforts, and Clinton said she would

that country “which has come under

Blue jobs,
green jobs

S

everal congressional leaders are
aggressively promoting “green
jobs” as US President Barack H.
Obama develops his New Energy for
America plan. A leading oil and gas
trade association executive thinks
they should encourage what he calls
“blue jobs” as well.
“Roughly 5.8 million Americans
are employed in and supported by
the natural gas and oil industries. We
call these ‘blue jobs,’ taking that image from the blue flame that comes
from clean-burning natural gas,” said
Natural Gas Supply Association Pres.
R. Skip Horvath.
“We fully support the creation
of more ‘green jobs,’ but we’ll be
wearing our ‘blue jobs’ buttons
when we meet with political leaders in Washington this year. We want
them to better understand how vital
our industry is,” Horvath said Jan.
14 during a US Energy Association
briefing.
“Solar and wind are the green
energy forms everyone knows, but
it takes blue to make green work.
Fly-wheels, chemical batteries, compressed air, and elevated water are
future technologies that may someday be able to help solar and wind
store energy, but the technology
that’s available now to back up these
generation sources is natural gas,”
Horvath said.

160,000 more jobs
During fourth-quarter 2008, as
the US economy contracted, oil and
gas extraction firms added 16,000
jobs compared to the comparable
2007 period, Horvath said. He also
cited figures from a study by ICF

32

International for the American Petroleum Institute that indicated on Dec.
8 that opening domestic supply areas
could create 160,000 jobs.
For every person directly employed in the oil and gas industry,
another two work for companies
that support the business, Horvath
observed. “We are talking about
approximately 6 million people
employed directly or indirectly by
natural gas and oil firms,” he said.
Gas also is a key US manufacturing
component, Horvath said. “One third
of America’s natural gas is used to
create everything from trash bags and
pantyhose to antifreeze and detergent,” he said.

When gas is green
The American Gas Association,
meanwhile, applauded US Sen. Ben
Nelson (D-Neb.) on Jan. 23 for his
bill to provide a tax incentive to
turn noxious waste into usable gas
by increasing gas production from
animal waste, landfills, and renewable
biomass.
“The natural gas from this process is a ‘green’ fuel. By taking a
waste product and converting it to
a valuable fuel, we create a source
of domestic supply that benefits the
consumers of natural gas. AGA believes this fiscally responsible proposal should be included in the stimulus
package that is being considered in
Congress,” AGA Pres. David N. Parker
said.
Finally, in its comprehensive
energy strategy, the Obama administration included prioritized construction of a gas pipeline from Alaska as
part of a program to create 5 million
green jobs in the next 10 years. ✦

federal regulators would move quickly
on the matter. “With this announcement from President Obama less than
a week into his administration, it is
clear that California and the environment now have a strong ally in the
White House. Allowing California and
other states to aggressively reduce their
own harmful tailpipe emissions would
be a historic win for clean air and for
millions of Americans who want more
fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly
cars,” he said.
The American Petroleum Institute
immediately criticized Obama’s action
on the states’ request for a federal regulatory waiver. “Creating a patchwork
regulatory structure across multiple
states would most likely impose higher
costs on consumers, slow economic
growth, and kill US jobs,” it said in a
Jan. 26 statement.
“The oil and natural gas industry
already is doing its part: Since 2000, it
has invested $42 billion into zero and
low-carbon research and development.
That’s 45% of all such spending by US
companies and the federal government
combined,” API continued.
Environmental organizations applauded Obama’s move. “For too long,
Washington has taken a back seat to
California, 13 other states, and the District of Columbia that have long understood the solution to global warming
and job creation are one and the same.
This action will help the entire country benefit from their foresight,” said
Steven Biel, global warming campaign
director at Greenpeace.
“Giving states the power to regulate
tailpipe emissions and moving forward
on a national increase in fuel efficiency
are the bold and necessary moves we
expected from President Obama, who
campaigned on the issue of fuel efficiency and global warming. These
moves, coupled with investments to
double renewable energy generation,
improve our power grid and increase
home energy efficiency, will create jobs
and lessen our dependence on fossil
fuels,” said Gene Kapinski, president of

the League of Conservation Voters.
Other groups’ reactions were mixed.
“President Obama has done more in
one week to reduce oil dependence and
fight global warming than President
[George W.] Bush did in 8 years,” said
Daniel J. Weiss, a senior fellow and climate strategy director at the Center for
American Progress. “His actions today
respond to scientists’ urgent warn-

ings to reduce global warming pollution now before it’s too late. These fuel
economy measures come on top of $90
billion of clean energy investments in
his economic recovery package,” Weiss
added.
Thomas J. Pyle, president of the
Institute for Energy Research, said the
California Air Resources Board has

estimated that its proposed automobile
emissions standards would add at least
$1,050 to the cost of each car. “Few
states depend more on others for energy than California. Few states ask their
citizens to pay more for their electricity. Today’s announcement ensures that
working-class Californians also will
have a harder time affording cars in the
future,” he said. ✦

Pemex reports 9.2% decline in oil production for 2008
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
Mexico’s Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), eyeing continued depletion at
its main oil field, said the country’s oil
production declined by 9.2% in 2008
to just under 2.8 million b/d.
The country’s level of production
was the lowest since 1995, when it
reached 2.62 million b/d, according to
statistics from the energy ministry.
Pemex explained the decrease as due
largely to continuing depletion of the
country’s Cantarell oil field and to Hurricane Ike, which disrupted production
in the Gulf of Mexico.
Pemex said the gradual depletion of
Cantarell, where production dropped by
461,000 b/d to around 1 million b/d
in 2008, was partly offset by increased
output at Ku-Maloob-Zaap field, which
saw production averaging 702,000 b/d
in 2008.

Altogether, Mexico’s oil production
rose in December to 2.717 million b/d
from 2.711 million b/d in November,
but it declined sharply from December
2007, when Pemex produced 2.954
million b/d.
Underlining a positive note, however, Pemex said that KMZ field reached
a record production level of 802,000
b/d on Dec. 29, making it “foreseeable
that in 2009 this field will become the
primary oil producer in the country.”

Optimism expressed
The Pemex statement echoed optimism expressed last month by Energy
Minister Georgina Kessel who told the
Mexican Senate that, with recent energy
sector reforms, Pemex would produce
2.7-2.8 million b/d in the 2009-10
period—volumes near its current output.
“Beginning in 2011, a gradual
increase in production will begin until
we reach levels near or slightly superior

to 3 million b/d in 2015,” the minister
said.
Meanwhile, Mexico exported 1.4
million b/d of oil in 2008, down
16.8% from 2007, but Pemex still
earned a record $43.32 billion from
foreign oil sales due to soaring global
petroleum prices. Of total exports,
87.2% went to the US, 10.3% to Europe, and the remainder to Asia.
The median price for Mexico’s blend
of crudes in 2008 was $84.35/bbl,
about 37% higher than in 2007.
However, the country’s gasoline imports for 2008 averaged 336,200 b/d,
up 9.1% over 2007, a rise that is expected to continue as domestic demand
outstrips production from the country’s
refineries.
Pemex has announced plans to build
a new 300,000 b/d refinery, but it has
delayed the onset of construction until
yearend, and the facility is unlikely to
be online before 2015 (OGJ Online,
Jan. 20, 2009). ✦

Newly formed NCOC takes over Kashagan ﬁeld operatorship
Eric Watkins
Oil Diplomacy Editor
The newly formed North Caspian
Operating Co. BV (NCOC), as part of
earlier agreement, has replaced the Agip
KCO consortium as operator of Kazakhstan’s Kashagan oil field development
project, also known as the North Cas-

pian Sea production-sharing agreement,
or NCS PSA.
The Eni SPA-led Agip KCO consortium, which earlier confirmed that the
project will reach a maximum output of
1.5 million b/d by the end of the next
decade, agreed in October 2008 to hand

over operating control of Kashagan to
NCOC this month.
NCOC, which is incorporated in the
Netherlands, is comprised of all the
partners in the NCS PSA consortium,
including KazMunayGaz, Eni SPA, Total
SA, ExxonMobil Corp., and Royal Dutch
Shell PLC, each holding 16.81%; ConocoPhillips 8.40%; and Inpex 7.55%.

Contention in
Madagascar

adagascar’s oil and gas industry
received a blow last week when
thousands of demonstrators, demanding a new government, hit the
streets and set fire to an oil depot.
The trouble erupted when the
government closed a radio station
belonging to the opposition party
whose leader, Andry Rajoelina, said
two protesters were killed in the affray.
President Marc Ravalomanana had
earlier accused Rajoelina of promoting the government’s overthrow and
declared that the government would
act decisively to “restore order” on
the Indian Ocean island off southeastern Africa. The opposition radio
station soon went off the air.
The altercation came just weeks
after Sino Union Petroleum & Chemical International Ltd. told shareholders that it expects to see oil production “very soon” from its primary
onshore oil and gas block in Madagascar.

projects the firm is developing.
“The company was able to explore
16 of the 27 new structures identified by an independent evaluation

executive officer, Alex Archila.
The company said 12 of 17 exploration wells drilled on the Tsimiroro

New operating model
Under terms of the new operating model, which became effective on
Jan. 22, NCOC will oversee all of the
project’s activities. It will manage planning, coordination, reservoir modeling,
conceptual studies, appraisal plans, early
development plans, and government
interfaces.
NCOC will be staffed by representatives of all partner companies and,
according to reports, will be run largely
in line with the Total SA management
system.
The managing director of the new
joint operating company will be on
rotation among the partners, and the
position initially will be held by a Total
SA executive, while the deputy managing directorship will be held by an
executive of KazMunayGaz.
Although NCOC will oversee the
project, under terms of the agreement
struck by the consortium partners and
the Kazakh government last October,
some of the partners will still have
direct responsibilities for the project’s
execution.

Two-phase development
Phase 1 of the project, which is due
online in late 2012, will be under the
responsibility of Eni SPA. Under Phase
1, oil production is expected to reach
300,000 b/d, increasing to 450,000
b/d during Phase 2.
Shell will manage the production
operations after the start-up of Phase 1,
with KazMunayGaz assuming greater
responsibility over time.
Meanwhile, Phase 2 will fall under
the responsibility of three partners:
Shell for offshore development, Eni for
the onshore plant, and ExxonMobil for
the drilling.
To carry out their responsibilities,
Eni, Shell, and ExxonMobil will have
appropriate authority on matters such
as staffing, procurement, and operating
procedures, and they will apply their
own companies’ management systems.

IFP: Politics, money crisis to impact energy industry
In an unprecedented economic and
financial crisis where “all reference
marks have disappeared,” the president
of the Institut Francais du Petrole (IFP),
Olivier Appert, ventured two “extreme”
scenarios for the midterm oil scene.
If energy policies to control demand
prevail and investments are maintained
at a certain level, he said, oil prices
could remain relatively stable around
the level of conventional oil substitutes—$60-100/bbl.
But if the economic upturn is strong
and the crisis discourages investments
in supply as well as demand management, tensions will elevate prices to
$100-150/bbl.
In the short term, Appert said, oil
prices should hover at $30-40/bbl, possibly rising to $60/bbl at yearend.
In the longer term, he said, the fundamentals will not have changed: When
the economy emerges from the crisis,
energy demand will pick up—pulled
along by emerging countries—and oil
and gas supplies will remain concentrated in a small number of countries.

Environmental concerns will continue
to prevail.
Viewed more broadly, oil and energy
markets will depend on the magnitude
and length of the economic and financial crisis, he said.

Other uncertainties
Meanwhile the outlook is fraught
with uncertainties: Will OPEC countries maintain their quota discipline?
Can they survive the fall in demand as
surplus capacity rises far higher than
the previous 3 million bbl? Will further
international tensions upset the oil
market?
Despite falling exploration and production costs, which are beginning to
be seen, oil and gas companies will be
reluctant to engage in risky investments
at current prices. Operators with high
debts are particularly fragile, he said.
However the impact on existing production remains slight as long as prices
cover operating costs, he added, and
supply cuts in 2009 should be small.
What is at stake is the prospect for

Semisubmersible Petrorig I on track for Gulf of Mexico
Petrorig I—the ﬁrst unit of a series of four Larsen Oil & Gas ultradeepwater semisubmersible
drilling rigs on order with Sembcorp Marine Ltd. subsidiary Jurong Shipyard—has completed its
turnkey construction on schedule and is on track for assignment in the Gulf of Mexico. The rig is
scheduled for delivery and sail-away in March for a 5-year charter with Petrobras America in the
gulf.
Petrorig I was built using Jurong Shipyard’s proprietary breakthrough techniques for fast-track
semisubmersible
construction and is a

& Goldman’s Ex-D millennium class design

up to 37,500 ft while

to 10,000 ft.
The rig is equipped

future projects, Appert said. Oil companies are keeping a “wait-and-see”
stance justified by the easing of pressure
on supplies. So far the very large, longterm, strategically important projects
are not being questioned.
Appert conceded that it was possible
for falling oil prices to temper oil nationalism, but it would take some time
for that to occur.
A new and larger impact on the
energy market could be the new energy
policies of US President Barack Obama.
“It is too early to have a clear view of
the new energy policy,” Appert cautioned, but if it is pushed ahead, “US oil
imports should fall by many percentage
points.”
He also wondered whether Russia
will retain for long its role as the leading oil producer on the oil scene. He
said OPEC resents Russia’s “stowaway”
position within the organization and
that Saudi Arabia might not accept the
loss of its leading role.

Gas market impacts
However Appert believes the “Gas
OPEC” that Russia has masterminded
will have a more than negligible impact
on the market “as Russia broadens its
sphere of influence with agreements
with Venezuela, Algeria, and especially
Caspian countries.”
Two recent developments will have
long-term consequences on both the
LNG world market and on Europe’s
refining market, according to Appert.
The first is North America’s shale gas
developments, which will impact the
world LNG market as the US will likely
import less gas.
The second development is the
higher price of middle distillates compared to gasoline, a price expected to
prevail, Appert said. As new automobile
standards develop and gasoline demand
falls in the US, European refineries
will lose their export outlet for surplus
gasoline. ✦

Seneca third largest Marcellus shale player
Seneca Resources Corp., third largest
acreage holder in the Devonian Marcellus shale gas play, plans to emerge as
an operator of record this year even as
it continues a joint venture with EOG
Resources Inc., Houston.
Seneca will spend $40 million on the
Marcellus compared with $60 million
to drill 300 Upper Devonian wells in
the Appalachian basin in 2009.
Its Marcellus holding has grown
to 725,000 acres, most of it clustered
south of Warren in northwestern Pennsylvania and much held in fee. Chesapeake Energy Corp., Oklahoma City,
leads in the play with 1.2 million acres,
and Range Resources Corp., Fort Worth,
has 900,000 acres.
Seneca’s spread includes 23,988
acres picked up at a Pennsylvania state
lease sale in September 2008, most of
it in Lycoming and Tioga counties in
north-central Pennsylvania. The other
top successful bidders at the sale were
ExxonMobil Corp. 19,439 acres, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. 17,189 acres,
Talisman Energy Inc.’s Fortuna Energy
Inc. unit 9,339 acres, and Hunt Oil Co.
4,068 acres.
A Seneca-EOG joint venture formed
in late 2006 gives EOG the right to earn
50% interest in 200,000 Seneca acres
and Seneca the right to earn 50% in all
of EOG’s 120,000 acres.
EOG must complete prospect selection by March 2009, rather than the

initially agreed December 2011. That
will leave Seneca in complete control of
525,000 acres.
Seneca will operate 8-10 vertical
Marcellus wells in 2009 plus starting
in July several horizontal wells. Typical
horizontal cost is $3.5 million/well
to drill and complete. Gas in place is
estimated at 30-150 bcf/sq mile, and
EUR is 1-3 bcf/well. Depth of the shale
is 5,000-8,000 ft.
Meanwhile, EOG must ramp up to
60 development wells/year by 2014.
Joint venture results so far are
encouraging, Seneca said. Having first
drilled five vertical wells, the firms are
drilling their seventh horizontal well.
The first horizontal well flowed 350

Nicaragua

Norwood Resources Ltd., Vancouver, BC, plans to twin its San Bartolo-1
indicated discovery well in Nicaragua’s
Sandino basin later this year after a
technical reevaluation and improvement
in financial markets.
Consulting petrophysicists prioritized six targets for coring and testing
as follows: 6,250-80 ft, 6,370-6,420 ft,
7,225-90 ft, 2,850-2,900 ft, 5,900-50
ft, and 7,590-7,670 ft.
The consultants concluded that movable oil appears to be present and that
improper testing techniques most likely
account for failed tests, Norwood said.
Norwood noted that it swabbed 60
bbl of 39° gravity oil from 5,900-50 ft
on June 14, 2008 and reverse circulated
13 bbl of 34° gravity oil from 6,250-80

The six reservoirs, which are normally pressured, contain nontraditional
volcaniclastic, fledspathic sandstones
with 10-35% hydrophilic clays with
12-18% porosity and 30-45% water
saturation. Permeabilities are poorly

BPZ also refurbished a dock in Talara,
Peru, to facilitate the company’s drilling
and logistical operations and secured all
tubular goods to meet planned needs
for the first two gas wells of the initial
three-well drilling campaign at Corvina.
On July 19, 2006, BPZ mobilized the
Petrex rig to the Corvina CX-11 platform and spud its first well, the CX1121XD, in September (Fig. 2).
Manolo Zuniga, president and
chief executive officer of BPZ Energy, described the operating environment. “Block Z-1 is near the equator.
The waters are calm and there are no
hurricanes. Conditions are relatively
benign.”4

21XD well
BPZ reported that the 21XD well
reached TD of 10,457 ft MD (9,234
TVD) in November 2006. During the
final stages of completing the first Corvina well, BPZ reported a mechanical
problem caused by a gas kick following
the cementing of the 7-in. liner in the
Zorritos formation. This caused cement
and several joints of drill pipe to block
part of the 95⁄8-in. intermediate casing.1 All obstructions were successfully
cleared.
In January 2007, BPZ Energy announced that all required testing equipment had been delivered and installed
at the well. BPZ ran four drillstem tests
(DSTs) in February on separate potential pay zones across 413 ft in the Lower
and Upper Zorritos formations. It announced results in March—40 MMcfd
of natural gas and 3,150 bo/d—and
temporarily completed the well as an
oil producer in April 2007.
The final production test after
completion yielded 5,900 bo/d with
920 psia of wellhead pressure.
BPZ spent $55.9 million to drill and
complete the 21XD and 14D producing
wells.2

16X well
The CX11-16X well was drilled
before BPZ entered the Corvina field, to
a TD of 8,684 ft MD.2 In May 2007, BPZ
completed the CX11-16X workover and

began a series of four DSTs, including
one in a formation previously untested
in the entire basin.2 BPZ completed the
16X as a gas well in June 2007 and it
was making 20 MMcfd.
BPZ spent $7.1 million to drill and
recomplete the 16X, run seismic, and
cover other related expenses.2
In June 2007, BPZ leased two oilproduction barges for 2 years, with
options to purchase, with a capacity of
40,000 bbl each.
The company planned to use one
barge, the Nomoku, as an FPSO for oil
produced at Corvina and the second,
the Nu’uanu, to transport produced oil
to the Talara refinery, about 70 miles to
the south.2

14D well
The CX11-14D well was spud June
21, 2007, and reached TD of 7,750 ft
MD on Aug. 18, “slightly ahead of the
60-day time line,” BPZ announced. The
well intersected multiple prospective
pay zones in the Upper Zorritos and

Cardalitos formations.
In September, the well tested 1,700
bo/d on a 5⁄8-in. choke through perforations in the Upper Zorritos formation at
7,150 ft. (OGJ, Sept. 17, 2007, p. 58).
BPZ announced in October 2007 that
it ran seven DSTs and tested a cumulative 104 MMcfd of gas and 2,400 bo/d
from the 14D well. The first six tests
were in the Upper Zorritos formation,
with the first two testing the oil zone
and the other four testing the gas zone;
the seventh test targeted the Cardalitos
formation located immediately above
the Upper Zorritos.2
The company also announced in
October that it leased two tankers from
the Peruvian navy to transport oil from
Corvina field. This allowed BPZ to begin
oil production from the Corvina platform in November 2007.
On Nov. 21, 2007, BPZ notified
Perupetro of a commercial discovery in
Block Z-1 field.2
Royalties under BPZ’s contract vary
from 5% to 20% based on production
volumes. Royalties start at 5% if and
when production is less than 5,000

planned 180-Mw, gas-fired, thermoelectric power plant to be developed by
SEP near the town of Arenilla, Ecuador.
In September 2008, BPZ signed a
contract to secure new turbines for its
power plant. It made an initial down
payment with GE Energy for three
LM6000 gas-fired turbines with an option for a fourth; delivery is expected
in fourth quarter this year. Each turbine
has a capacity of 45 Mw and will
consume 8 MMcfd equivalent of gas
feedstock.
BPZ says the power plant is expected
to be fully operational May 2010.
In September 2008, Raymond James
analysts said, “Assuming current power
prices in Peru (about $50/Mw-hr), the
equivalent gas price BPZ would receive
from power sales is about $6.05/Mcf.”5

No joint venture
Shares of BPZ soared in July 2008
after the company said it was in talks
with a unit of Royal Dutch Shell PLC
about jointly developing properties
in Peru. BPZ and Shell Exploration
Co. signed a memorandum of understanding in June 2008 to negotiate a
farmout agreement with the “ultimate
goal of jointly developing Blocks Z-1,
XIX, and XXIII” (OGJ Online, Dec. 2,
2008).
The MOU called for Shell to commit
to a three-phase exploration and appraisal program, spending up to $300
million on 12 wells to earn up to 50%
of gas reserves at Mancora and deepwater leads in Block Z-1.
BPZ and Shell agreed to discontinue
farmout negotiations, the companies
announced on Jan. 8.
Zuniga said BPZ “will continue
appraising Corvina while preparing
to drill in Albacora, continue ramping up oil production, and proving up
reserves.” It will also continue developing the gas-to-power project, which
anchors its gas monetizing strategy.

Oil sales
BPZ announced separately, on Jan.
8, a new, long-term oil sales contract
with the Peruvian government to

deliver about 17 million bbl of crude
from Corvina field to the state-owned
Talara refinery over a period of 7 years.
The contract has a referential value
of about $1.3 billion, according to
PeruPetro.
Corvina’s oil sales price will be
equivalent to a basket of crude oils
based on a 15-day average of Forties,
Oman, and Suez blend crude oil prices
(as quoted in the Spot Crude Prices
Assessment published in Platt’s Crude
Oilgram Price Report), less $1/bbl. ✦

Analytical approach
The US Department of Energy (DOE)
has developed the national strategic
unconventional resources model that is
an analytical system for evaluating potential US oil shale development under
different economic and public policy
regimes.1
The model can perform sensitivity
analyses relative to price, tax, royalty,
and incentives; perform cash-flow
analyses under alternative leasing options; and evaluate costs and benefits
of various public policy options to
stimulate oil shale project investment.
The model has three detailed modules
for evaluating the resource, screening
the technology, and providing detailed
economics.
The resource module contains
detailed petrophysical and geological characterestics for 25 development
tracts in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming.
These tracts collectively contain in place
a 70 billion bbl resource.
Detailed studies of these 25 tracts
were part of the 1973 US Department
of Interior prototype oil shale leasing
program. Because of previous industry nomination, this article assumes
that these tracts represent locations of
commercial interests. These nominated
tracts, therefore, provide a solid technical basis for the present analysis.
The analysis developed screening
criteria for various technologies based
on the geological characteristics such as
depth, dip angle, yield, and thickness of
the resource.

Macroeconomic beneﬁts
Development of an oil shale industry provides potential public benefits.
Federal, state, and local governments
and the overall domestic economy
will benefit from direct contributions
of a domestic oil shale industry and
from additional economic activity and
growth that will result from industry
development. Direct benefits include:
• Direct federal revenues from federal taxes and federal share of royalties.
• Direct state and local revenues
from state and local taxes plus the state
share of federal royalties.
• The value of avoided oil imports.
• Employment.
• Contribution to gross domestic
product (GDP).

Federal, state revenues
Based on the BAU scenario, direct
federal revenues could reach $0.9 billion/year by 2035. With the incentives
introduced in the RD&D scenario, federal revenues could reach $4.2 billion/
year at the end of the 30-year period
analyzed.1

2010

2015

2020

Direct state revenues generated by
the BAU scenario are $0.6 billion/year
in 2035. In the RD&D scenario, state
revenues could reach $2.9 billion/year
by 2035.1
Total public sector revenues (the sum
of direct federal and state revenues)
could reach $1.5 billion/year for the
BAU case and $7.0 billion/year for
the RD&D scenario by 2035. Cumulative public sector revenues through
2035 could total $24.6 billion for the
BAU scenario and $85.6 billion for the
RD&D scenario.1

Imports avoided
The BAU scenario production of
shale oil would replace about $4.1
billion/year of imported oil by 2035.
The RD&D scenario would save the
US $22.4 billion/year by 2035 that
would have otherwise been spent on
imports.
Cumulative imports avoided through
2035 are $72 billion for the BAU scenario and $325 billion for the RD&D
scenario (Fig. 5).1

2025

2030

2035

Employment
Oil shale industry development will
add thousands of new, high-value, longterm jobs in construction, manufacturing, mining, production, and refining.
These estimates are based on industry
expenditures as well as jobs created in
the petroleum sector.
Not all direct employment will be
jobs new to the economy. Some will be
filled by workers shifting from one sector to another. The jobs will not all be in
states with oil shale development sites.
Other states that design or manufacture
trucks, engines, steel, mining equipment, pumps, tubular goods, process
controls, and other elements of the
physical complex will also share in the
jobs creation.
The RD&D scenario for oil shale
development will create nearly 250,000
new jobs by 2035. The BAU scenario
employment is less (Fig. 6).1

GDP contribution
These projects will contribute directly
to the economy, as measured by the gross
domestic product (GDP). The analysis
estimates an annual contribution of $76.6
billion by 2035 for the RD&D scenario.

The combination of two hurricanes
in the Gulf of Mexico and a decline
in global economic activity caused
demand and production of olefins in
the US to fall sharply in fourth-quarter
2008.
Unlike the quiet hurricane season of
2007, the 2008 Gulf of Mexico hurricane season was active and two storms
made landfall in Louisiana and the upper Texas coast.
Hurricanes
Gustav and Ike
caused widespread downtime for the
olefins industry
during September and October 2008.
Furthermore, the dual financial
storms of panic and credit crunch
reached their full fury during secondhalf 2008. As economic activity declined globally, demand for petrochemicals fell sharply during fourth-quarter
2008 and had a more pronounced
effect on olefins production and profitability than Hurricanes Gustav and Ike
combined.
Olefins producers experienced the
most dramatic decline ever in feedstock

Ethylene industry demand for fresh

for ethane were favorable during second
and third quarters 2008 and ethane’s
share averaged 51% of fresh feed in
second-quarter 2008 but slipped to
47% in the third quarter.
Ethylene producers responded to the
credit crunch and decline in demand
for petrochemicals by sharply curtailing
production rates beginning in October.
Based on projected ethylene industry
operating rates of 70-72% for fourthquarter 2008, total demand for fresh
feedstocks will average 1.35-1.40 million b/d. Total demand for LPG feedstocks will average 900,000-950,000
b/d during fourth-quarter 2008.

Refinery propylene sales declined to
35.4 million lb in third-quarter 2008.
Refineries in Louisiana and Texas experienced substantial downtime during
September due to Gustav and Ike. As a
result, total refinery propylene sales in
third-quarter 2008 were 540 million lb
less than year-earlier volumes (about 12
days of production).

Total domestic propylene supply was
6.23 billion lb in second-quarter 2008,
which was 751 million lb lower than in

feedstocks during second-half 2008.
Based on monthly averages, spot
prices for West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) declined almost 71% during second-half 2008. In response to
the price collapse, producers around
the world delayed or cancelled major
projects for oil production and refining
capacity expansions.
OPEC responded to the collapse in
crude prices with a series of agreements
to reduce their production and tighten
the global crude supply-demand balance. In view of OPEC’s poor historic
record of compliance with its production quota agreements, WTI prices
could easily range from a low of $25/
bbl to a high of $50-60/bbl during
first-half 2009.
We expect weakness in demand for
gasoline and diesel fuel, however, to
remain foremost among the concerns
affecting crude prices during first-half
2009. Forecasts for ethylene production
costs and prices are based on WTI prices
of $40-45/bbl during first-half 2009.
Ethylene production costs (full cash
costs) will be about 16-20¢/lb. Spot
ethylene prices will average 22-25¢/lb.
Profit margins will average 5-8¢/lb for
purity ethane and 7-10¢/lb for purity
propane. ✦

and wax content of 10-16% (average
≈13%). A 300-ppm PPD dose lowered
pour point to 18º C. and yield to 10.2
dynes/sq cm (at 20° C.). PPD dosing
also ensured easy restartability after
prolonged shutdown and inhibited
wax deposition. Earlier estimates placed
cooling during a longer shutdown
at 18º C., resulting in a high break

Studies conducted in an offshore
laboratory and field pipeline gathered
about 1,000 sets of data on the oil’s
behavior, pipeline shutdown conditions,
bathymetry, and other subjects.
Lab and field studies focused on the
following topics, integrating the results:
• Lab studies:
—Temperature’s effect on PPD dosage.
—Water cut’s (free and emulsified)
effect on PPD dosage.
—Gas-water’s effect on oil’s congealing behavior.
—PPD’s efficiency over time.
• Field studies:
—Studies on 16-in. OD BHN-SA
well fluid line to observe oil congealing and cooling under static and subsea
temperature conditions over a prolonged period.
—Data of shutdown and restarting
the BUT oil line over the past 2 decades,
temperature profile of the pipeline
route, bathymetry, etc.
—Pour point studies under pipeline
conditions.
A six-speed Fann VG meter with a
programmed cooling bath performed
rheology. Rheology between 34° C.
and 22° C. was estimated. ASTM D-97
method determined pour point.
Researchers built an apparatus to
measure pour point under live pipeline conditions. Oil from the separator
line was directly collected. ASTM D-97
guided maintenance of cooling cycles.

the company’s growth
strategies, including marketing of the
company’s services for
deepwater applications.
He first joined Global in
2001, serving in leadership positions in both

development in Latin
America. He was named
vice-president, Latin America, in 2002
and served in that role until mid-2008
when he resigned from Global. He holds a
master’s in construction management from
Universidad Iberoamericana and a bachelor’s in civil engineering from Universidad
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. Katok will
lead Global’s efforts to enhance customer
satisfaction by developing processes to improve client sponsorship, project planning,
and project execution. He joined Global
in early 2008 after 6 years with Technip
Inc., where he served as commercial vicepresident. Previously, he spent more than
25 years with Kellogg, Brown & Root in
a variety of commercial, project management, and operational roles. Katok has a
BS in civil engineering from West Virginia
University.
Global Industries is a leading provider

the oil and gas industry worldwide.

Smith International Inc.,
Houston, and Sub-One Technology,
Pleasanton, Calif., have announced that
they will jointly commercialize the application of Sub-One’s advanced InnerArmor
coating technology for oil country tubular
goods (OCTG) applications. The joint venture, Smith InnerArmor Coating Services
(SIACS), has the exclusive license to supply
a full range of OCTG coatings globally.
InnerArmor coatings, which are applied to
the internal surfaces of metallic components such as pipes, tubes, and other cylindrical items, increase resistance to corrosion, erosion, wear, and/or fouling. With
a low friction coefficient, the coatings also
improve flow properties for liquids and
gases. By delivering InnerArmor coatings
for the OCTG market, SIACS will enable its
oil and gas customers to meet demanding
E&P environments. Typical applications
would entail coating production tubing in
sour gas environments and in scale-prone
wells and coating drill strings to reduce
erosion and friction pressure loss.
Smith is a leading worldwide supplier
of premium products to the oil and gas
E&P industry, the petrochemical industry,
and other industrial markets, operating
through MI SWACO, Smith Technologies,
Smith Services, and Wilson.
Sub-One is the market leader in advanced coatings for internal surfaces. It has
developed a patented process and state-ofthe-art systems for depositing its advanced
coatings onto the internal surfaces of a
broad spectrum of products ranging from
small, complex components to long, largediameter industrial piping, in particular
pipe coating to combat pipeline corrosion.

NEW!
This timely new book, written by an expert team of
scientists and engineers, provides a road map for
transforming energy business capabilities to confront an
increasingly competitive global economy.
Authors Roger Anderson, Albert Boulanger, John Johnson, and Arthur
Kressner extend into the energy industry the best practices available in
computational sciences and the lean management principles currently
being used in other leading manufacturing industries.
Computer-aided lean management (CALM) technologies and
methodologies can be used to:
• Signiﬁcantly lower costs and improve operations of electric power
utilities and oil and gas companies.
• Assure that a new design introduced to the “market” will be effective.
• Measure the results of an action taken and use those measurements
to drive greater efﬁciency in business operations.

“

Computer-Aided Lean Management for the Energy Industry comes at a
critical time in the world’s energy lifecycle…. Applying the ‘lean practices’
of the aerospace and auto industries to energy production and distribution
will enable the wringing out of waste from our energy infrastructure. In so
doing, the concepts explored in this book may prove to be the cheapest
and cleanest forms of energy available on the planet.

”

— Ron Prosser, formerly president of Boeing Services Co. and currently CEO of The
Prosser Group, consultants on green energy related projects.

Plunge refutes
US view of what
steers oil price
If not for the political damage, uninformed bellyaching about oil prices would
be amusing.
In the US, where it’s shrill, the complaining started after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita
whacked Gulf Coast reﬁning and production in 2005.
Oil prices already were rising in a tightening market. They had no way to respond
to the supply shock except to jump.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

But an altogether transparent and reasonable market response made Americans
irrational. When the proﬁts of oil and gas
companies subsequently rose, as they
inevitably would under the circumstances,
anger gave way to consummate rage.
The political consequences remain painfully in memory: the threats of “windfall
proﬁt” taxes, the congressional inquisitions
of oil company executives, and the nearly
total dismissal of the oil and gas industry
from pubic acceptability.
While businesses don’t have to be
popular to succeed commercially, they do
need some measure of credibility if they’re
to have political inﬂuence, even if that inﬂuence amounts to little more than defense
against worst cases.
An oil market characterized by growth
that couldn’t last and prices unsustainably
high quickly has reversed course. To this
turn of events, American thinking on the
price of oil has no way to respond.
If the oil industry deserved the public
hatred it experienced when prices were
high, does it now merit love and kisses?
If the elevation of proﬁt by commodity
producers in a time of rising commodity
prices really amounts to evidence of chicanery, should shrinkage of proﬁt as prices
slide not earn for the oil industry cheers
from lawmakers and adoration from news
commentators?
This, of course, is a facetious game
of logic based on a discussion in which,
historically, logic has lacked inﬂuence. If the
past predicts the future, the oil prices that
attracted such scorn while high will lose
nearly all attention while low.
Before public oblivion takes over, the
industry might usefully call attention to
another question that more seriously addresses a misunderstanding central to its
political difﬁculties:
If oil companies really possessed the
control so frequently ascribed to them,
why would they allow oil prices to fall so
dramatically now?

Oil, gas targeted for more taxes
There are “ample signs” that the US states and federal government will take a
bigger tax bite from both upstream and downstream oil and gas operations to cover
pending ﬁnancial shortfalls in 2009, warned analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
& Co. Inc. (FBR) in Arlington, Va.
“All over the world, cash-strapped governments looking for ways to shore up
shortfalls look to petroleum industry cash ﬂows as a potential source of operating
funds. Generally speaking, resource-exporting countries (or US states) consider
‘windfall’ taxation of the upstream (because that’s where the money is), while net
importers of crude and petroleum products look at the downstream,” FBR analysts
said. There’s talk California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) may consider a severance (extraction) tax and a gasoline tax to help cover his state’s “grievous” budget
deﬁcit and “precipitously declining” stabilization fund. FBR analysts said, “Our
industry sources are skeptical that the governor might cut off the head and feet of
the Golden State’s golden goose (California is home to 4 of the nation’s 10 mostproductive oil ﬁelds), but our California sources see growing support for tax hikes
somewhere in the value chain.”
On Feb. 2 when President Barack Obama delivers his ﬁrst budget request to Congress, “he will set in motion a two-stage process for modifying mandatory federal
spending: a budget ‘resolution’ or outline, followed by ‘reconciliation’ of federal laws
with these spending targets,” the analysts said. “Because this process requires only
51 votes (budget bills cannot be ﬁlibustered), it presents House and Senate tax-writing committees with a powerful mechanism for stripping oil industry tax beneﬁts.”
Likely changes, they said, include:
• Shifting inventory accounting from “last in, ﬁrst out” to “ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out.”
• Rescinding Section 199 deductions under the 2004 Jobs bill (an effective 2% tax
hike).
• Assessing a new 13% surcharge on Gulf of Mexico deepwater production and
deducting existing royalties—“a 0.5% hike for leases with royalty relief phase outs,
but a 13% haircut for producers with ‘ﬂawed’ leases sold in 1998 and 1999,” said FBR
analysts.
• Treating as US corporations those companies that “inverted” their domicile
prior to March 2003, “the current safe harbor date.”
• Potentially revisiting tax treatment of intangible drilling costs and geological
and geophysical expensing for at least some companies.
FBR analysts predict, “Any new tax changes could [further reduce] gasoline
demand given the fragility of the US consumer.” Moreover, Diana DeGette (D-Colo.),
vice-chairman of the Energy and Commerce committee, “shares Chairman Henry
Waxman’s (D-Calif.) distaste for hydraulic fracturing, raising odds that 2009 will kick
off what we estimate to be a 2-year countdown to higher extraction costs,” said FBR
analysts. But although fraccing “is in the cross hairs,” they said, “the time frame for
actual change in standards governing efﬂuent could be more than 2 years away (6 to
12 months to pass a new law and 12 to 18 months to write a new regulation).”
Economy over environment
Strengthening the nation’s economy and improving the job market are the top
two priorities among US adults while environmental concerns have fallen steeply,
according to an annual January poll by the independent Pew Research Center
for People and the Press in Washington, DC. “The share of Americans saying that
strengthening the nation’s economy should be a top priority has risen from 68%
2 years ago to 75% last January to 85% today. Concern about jobs has risen even
more sharply. The 82% who rate improving the job situation as a top priority represents a 21-point jump from 61% a year ago,” said researchers.
Energy is in sixth place—below terrorism, social security, and education—as a top
priority among 60% of those polled, up from 40% in 2003. Protecting the environment fell “the most precipitously” to 41% this year, down from 56% in January 2008,
said Pew Research ofﬁcials. The decline in environment concerns crossed partisan
and demographic lines primarily because of growing public concern about the
economy, they said. More respondents were concerned with reducing the national
deﬁcit (53%) and tax cuts (43%) than with the environment.
The center reported a partisan gap over reducing middle-class taxes. “At the start
of 2008, roughly half of both Democrats (50%) and Republicans (46%) rated this as a
top priority. Today, just 31% of Republicans say middle class tax cuts are a top priority, compared with 48% of Democrats,” they said.

Ecuador hails ‘integration’ with Venezuela
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, while accepting drilling
services offered by Venezuela at a discounted rate, has hailed his
country’s oil and gas “integration” with its South American neighbor.
State-owned Petroecuador will use two Venezuelan rigs, one of
which is drilling the Guanto Dureno well in the province of Lago
Agrio. The other is to arrive next month.
Petroecuador and Petroleos de Venezuela SA also will establish a
joint company for development of Sacha oil field and in June will
begin construction of a 300,000-b/d refinery in the province of
Manabi.
The Ecuadorian leader cited the support of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in offering the two oil rigs and accompanying
technicians at a discounted rate, covering all expenses for maintenance, operations, and administration.
Correa said the rig’s rental came to $8,000/day, compared with
what he called the international market rate of $30,000/day. He
also pledged that Petroecuador’s crude oil production would eventually increase to 190,000 b/d from 173,000 b/d.

Taxes, mature ﬁelds vex Russia’s oil industry
High taxes are threatening the future development of Russia’s
oil and gas industry as production growth stagnates from mature
fields, speakers warned last month at International Petroleum Week
in London.
“There is no clarity until the new government comes into
power,” said Tony Considine, TNK-BP downstream executive vicepresident.
Russia’s prospective fields in Siberia and offshore in the Arctic
require huge investments and pose major development and financial risks.
Favorable tax rules make it attractive for companies to invest
in refining rather than export the oil. Russia also has encouraged
the creation of petroleum products because it adds value to oil.
About 100 mini refineries have sprung up, but future growth is
being jeopardized by a shortage of skilled personnel and a lack of
financial investment, Considine said. “We are cautiously optimistic;
we can be competitive with European refineries if oil prices are at
$60/bbl.”
Refiners are under great pressure to change the specification of
petroleum products in Russia, with different requirements set for
2009, 2010, and 2013, Considine said, criticizing the timetable as
“aggressive.”
Mark Gyetvay, chief financial officer of Russian gas independent
Novatek, told OGJ it does not expect the forthcoming government

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

to severely increase mineral extraction taxes, as large investments
are required for projects. None of the presidential candidates, who
will finish their campaigns in March, has indicated that he would
change the investment climate to benefit independents, which are
expected to be important players in supplying oil and gas to the
market in the midterm.
“Gazprom’s supply will be relatively flat because a lot of these
projects won’t start until 2013, and they are capital intensive projects, so the growth in Russia will be driven by the independents,”
he added.
Novatek represents 29% of non-Gazprom production, a volume
expected to rise to 40% within the next 5 years. Novatek enjoys
higher-than-average gas prices on the domestic market because it
does not have to sell gas at fixed prices as Gazprom does.
Gyetvay said Gazprom has purchased gas from Central Asia to
supply its customers, but these countries also are pursuing strategies to export gas to Asia and bypass Russia, leaving the market
unclear about the level of Central Asian gas available.

NOCs, IOCs need to ﬁnd new partnership models
National oil companies are delivering higher levels of growth
in market capitalization compared with international oil companies, and new models of collaboration are necessary to deliver secure and sustainable energy supplies to the global market, speakers told delegates last month at International Petroleum Week in
London.
In 2007 NOCs held 65% of the world’s reserves, offering limited equity access, according to Robin West, chairman of consultancy PFC Energy. Full IOC access to reserves was 7%. “It’s their
oil,” West said, “and this is the new reality.”
By 2030, global energy demand is expected to increase by 40%
compared with 2008—driven mainly by economic growth and
population increases in developing countries, according to ExxonMobil Corp. figures. The growth of the transportation sector will
account for the rise over the next 2 decades, with oil remaining a
crucial part of the energy mix.
Because of high oil prices, producing countries are awash with
cash and are confident about developing energy projects without
the assistance of IOCs. However, they are seeking technology transfers, skills training, infrastructure support, and economic development.
Tighter fiscal regimes are making it more difficult for IOCs to
propose economically attractive projects. West called on IOCs to
find ways to align themselves with building the gross national
products of their host governments in accessing new resources. He
told OGJ that BP PLC has found ways to develop the infrastructure
in Azerbaijan to help grow its economy. ✦

Tullow gauges light oil discovery off Ghana
Tullow Oil PLC said it gauged light, 29º gravity oil in the Gulf of
Guinea off Ghana in an exploratory well that opens a new play.
The Odum-1 discovery on the West Cape Three Points License
is a stratigraphic trap in a Campanian age fan system and opens
a second new play fairway in the Tano basin, the company said.
The company has identified further prospectivity in the Campanian
play on the West Cape Three Points and Deepwater Tano licenses.
Odum-1, drilled to 3,387 m in 955 m of water 13 km from
Jubilee field, encountered 22 m of net pay in a 60-m gross oil column. It is suspended as a future development well.
The Songa Saturn drillship will move to drill Mahogany-2, the
next appraisal well in Jubilee field.
“While appraisal of the upside of Jubilee is ongoing, the field
partnership is also working on plans for a phased development
of the field. The Eirik Raude fifth-generation semisubmersible has
been contracted for a minimum of 3 years and is a critical element
in our plan to target first oil in 2010,” Tullow said.
Meanwhile, Tullow plans to redrill its Ngassa-1 high-angle well
on Block 2 in Uganda from an alternative location. TD is 1,635 m.
The well cut 6 m of net gas bearing sands, and thick claystone
seals provided good encouragement about underlying oil prospectivity. However, the primary and secondary oil objectives weren’t
reached due to persistent borehole instability.

Mariner starts gas ﬁeld in Atwater Valley
Mariner Energy Inc., Houston, started gas production Feb. 15
from two-well Bass Lite field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
The wells, in 6,750 ft of water on Atwater Valley Block 425,
represent one of the gulf’s deepest deepwater developments. Initial
production of 60 MMcfd of biogenic gas flows via a 56-mile subsea tieback to the Devil’s Tower spar on Mississippi Canyon Block
773.
Mariner, operator with 42.2% working interest, discovered
the field in 2000 and estimated it will attain peak output of 125
MMcfd later in 2008. The initial rate is limited by the production
system designed to achieve early production pending further topside upgrades. Eni SPA of Italy owns the other interest.
Mariner said Bass Lite “employs the second longest flowline for
a subsea tieback and the longest umbilical utilizing fiber optics for
primary control ever deployed in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally,

the steel catenary riser used to tie in to the Devil’s Tower production facility appears to be the first designed and approved in accordance with the new MMS storm criteria for the Gulf of Mexico.”

Continental touts Michigan TBR program
Continental Resources Inc., Enid, Okla., plans to drill five more
wells in the second and third quarters in an Ordovician TrentonBlack River oil and gas play in Hillsdale County, Mich.
Continental said its McArthur 1-36 discovery well is flowing
260 b/d of oil and has been assigned gross proved reserves of
824,000 boe. A second well, Anspaugh 1-1, encountered similar
type pay and is flow-testing 200 b/d.
A third well, Wessel 1-6, is flow-testing at rates as high as 100
bbl/hr during clean-up.
Continental has participated in two nonoperated TBR wells.
Young 10-34 had encouraging shows and is awaiting completion,
and Clark 1-36 is on test at low rates.
The company owns 29,200 net acres in the TBR play and has
shot, processed, and interpreted 11 sq miles of 3D seismic. It plans
to shoot 20 sq miles more in March and more later in 2008.

UK offers 2,297 blocks in licensing round
The UK government has launched its 25th licensing round
where operators can bid for acreage in the North Sea. About 2,297
blocks will be available, and 72 blocks, originally classified as fallow, have been relinquished in time to be offered in this licensing
round.
Alongside the traditional licenses, operators can apply for frontier licenses to develop difficult areas and promote licenses aimed
at smaller companies to work up prospects.
Offshore trade association Oil & Gas UK welcomed the announcement, saying companies would ensure long-term development of the mature basin.
Malcolm Webb, Oil & Gas UK’s chief executive, said, “Nearly
a third of all exploration and appraisal drilling over the last year
was on acreage that had passed through the ‘fallow’ and ‘promote’
initiatives, which highlights the benefits to be gained from government working closely with industry in encouraging maximum
recovery of the UK’s oil and gas reserves.”
The deadline for applications is May 19. ✦

Aramco lets contract for Tarzan-class rig
Saudi Aramco has let a 3-year drilling contract to Rowan Cos.
Inc. for offshore work starting in the second quarter.
Bob Keller, a Tarzan-class jack up rig, is now en route to the
Middle East. Rowan expects total revenues of $201 million from
the contract, which has an option to be extended another year.
The contract expands Rowan’s presence in the Middle East to
nine jack ups, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Danny McNease said. “Our Tarzan-class rigs, in particular, have demonstrated

Africa Oil to use new rig for Puntland wells
Africa Oil Corp., Vancouver, BC, will use a new rig under contract from Energi Tata Persada Pte. Ltd. (ETP), Singapore, for its
drilling program in the Puntland area of Somalia (OGJ, Sept. 3,
2007, p. 34).

a 1,500-hp top-drive unit with three 1,600-hp pumps.
Africa Oil’s day-rate contract covers two wells with a two-well
option. Under a farmout from Range Resources Ltd., Perth, it will
earn an 80% participating interest by drilling two wells each in the
Puntland area’s Nogal and Dharoor basins (OGJ, Mar. 26, 2007, p.
33).
It plans to spud the first Somali well in July.
ETP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Catur Khita Persada of Indonesia, owns four land rigs.

Neptune Marine to buy, reactivate semi
Neptune Marine Oil & Gas Ltd., Nicosia, has agreed to buy the
Atlantic Venture semisubmersible drilling rig, former Sedco 708,
and plans to reactivate it.
It signed a memorandum of agreement with Cypriot-based Zelie Industrial Ltd. to buy the rig, which was built in 1977, for $67
million. Transocean Inc. removed the Sedco 708 from its fleet in
2003.
Neptune Marine, a subsidiary of Jasper Investments Ltd., plans
to refurbish the unit for work as a dynamically positioned semi

Abu Dhabi to build 417,000 b/d reﬁnery at Ruwais
Abu Dhabi will build a 417,000 b/d refinery, further boosting
the emirate’s existing 485,000 b/d refining capacity, reported the
Emirates News Agency.
Quoting Jasem Ali Sayegh, general manager of Abu Dhabi Oil
Refining Co. (Takreer), the agency said the facility will be completed by 2013. Sayegh was speaking at the Middle East Refining
Conference in Abu Dhabi.
While still in the design phase, the new refinery will be built in
Ruwais about 240 km from Abu Dhabi City, Sayegh was reported as
saying. Abu Dhabi has two existing refineries: one at Ruwais with
400,000 b/d of refining capacity and a second at Um Al Nar with
85,000 b/d capacity.
An interrefinery pipeline will be built between the two Ruwais
facilities, Sayegh said, “to eliminate the need for shipments as well
as to connect Ruwais and Abu Dhabi.”

16,519 tonnes, displacement lightship of 9,307 tonnes, and variable load of 4,500 tonnes.
The agreement calls for Neptune Marine to take delivery of the
semi in Cape Town, South Africa, by Apr. 7.
Previously, Neptune Marine acquired for upgrade two drillships, the Neptune Discoverer and Neptune Explorer (OGJ, May
8, 2006, p. 43).

US drilling activity dips
US drilling activity dipped lower during the week ending Feb.
22 with 1,771 rotary rigs working, 2 less than a week prior but up
from 1,754 during the same period a year ago, said Baker Hughes
Inc.
Land activity accounted for the loss, down 3 rigs to 1,694 units
drilling. Inland water activity increased by 1 rig to 22 making hole.
Offshore was unchanged at 55 rigs drilling, including 54 in the
Gulf of Mexico.
In spite of the low net loss nationwide, Texas’ weekly rig count
fell by 9 to 866 drilling. Colorado was down 6 to 112. New Mexico
declined by 2 rigs to 65. However, that was partly offset in Oklahoma where the rig count increased by 6 units to 201. Alaska was
up 2 to 11, while Wyoming and California gained 1 rig each to
respective counts of 74 and 33. Louisiana was unchanged with 144
rigs working. ✦

Motor Oil (Hellas) expands Corinth reﬁnery
Motor Oil (Hellas) Corinth SA, Maroussi, Greece, is expanding
its 110,000 b/d refinery in Corinth about 70 km from Athens.
The company let contract to Technip for engineering, procurement, and construction management of a 60,000 b/d crude oil
distillation unit to be operational early in 2010. It estimates the
investment at €180 million.
The expansion follows an upgrade centered on the addition of
a 37,000-b/d mild hydrocracker brought on stream in November
2005.
In that project Motor Oil also added a 32,000-b/d gas oil desulfurization unit and a 65,000-cu m/hr hydrogen production
unit. ✦

StatoilHydro ships ﬁrst LNG cargo to US
StatoilHydro AS has delivered its first cargo of LNG from the
Hammerfest liquefaction plant in Norway to Cove Point in the US.
The cargo arrived on Feb. 21 and marked the first export of
European LNG to the US.
Cove Point is undergoing an expansion program and StatoilHydro has secured all of the new capacity. It will acquire 10 billion
cu m/year of gas capacity from 2009.
Snohvit gas field is in the Norwegian Barents Sea. StatoilHydro
will market a total of 4 billion cu m/year of gas at the field’s full
capacity.
Rune Bjørnson, StatoilHydro’s executive vice president for the
natural gas business area, said that he was confident that trading of
LNG would become as flexible as oil–globalizing the market.
Snohvit field licencees are StatoilHydro (operator) 33.5%, Petoro 30%, Total E&P Norway 18.4%, Gaz de France 12%, Hess
3.3%, and RWE Dea Norway 2.8%.

PTT lets contract for Thailand’s ﬁrst LNG terminal
PTT PLC has awarded a $600 million contract to South Korea’s
GS Engineering & Construction Corp. to build Thailand’s first LNG
receiving terminal on the eastern coast.
Construction of the 5 million tonnes/year facility in Rayong,
about 200 km southeast of Bangkok, is due to start shortly for
completion in mid-2011, PTT said.
PTT, through subsidiary PTT LNG Co., plans to double the terminal’s capacity to 10 million tpy in a later stage as it ramps up
LNG purchases from several sources to meet the country’s rising
gas demand.
PTT recently signed an agreement to import 1 million tpy of
LNG from Qatargas Operating Co. for 10 years starting in early
2011 with an option to increase the volume to 2 million tpy (OGJ,
Feb 11, 2008, Newsletter).
PTT also has been in talks with other LNG suppliers in Indonesia, Australia, and the Middle East, as price disputes have bogged
down the finalization of the 20-year supply of 3 million tpy from
Iran’s Pars LNG project.

US LNG imports in 2007 surpass 2006, review says
The US, listed as the world’s fourth-largest LNG importer in
2007, received much more LNG last year than it did in 2006 and
paid less for it, reported Pan EurAsian Enterprises Inc. in its yearend
review of US LNG imports.
US LNG imports were 770.8 bcf, not including 26.3 bcf imported into Puerto Rico, vs. 583.5 bcf in 2006, and the year weighted average cost in 2007 was $6.66/MMbtu vs. $6.82/MMbtu in
2006.
This 15% increase was achieved because of an import surge
during March-September 2007, which offset the falloff of activity
during the fourth quarter of 2007 when LNG imports were 79.3
bcf vs. 134.7 bcf the same quarter in 2006, Pan EurAsian said.
BG remained the largest importer of LNG into the US at the
Trunkline LNG terminal at Lake Charles, La., with a 54.7% market
share in 2007. BG controls 100% of the capacity and throughput
rights at Lake Charles, but does not own the terminal. Suez Energy

NA was the second-largest importer, with 23.8% of the imports at
its Everett terminal in Boston.
Pan EurAsian reported that overall average capacity utilization of
the US LNG import terminals in 2007 was about 39.7%, according to the North American Terminal Survey (NATS) regasification
data. However, the daily rate for capacity utilization varies widely
around that number.
Overall LNG imports in countries of the Atlantic Basin (except
Italy and Portugal, which are not covered) were up 15% over 2006.
The US imported 17.1% of the Atlantic Basin volume (OGJ Online,
Feb. 11, 2008). Spain remains the largest LNG importer in the Atlantic Basin with 44.5% of all the imports.
Trinidad and Tobago, with 58.5% of market share, remain the
largest single country of origin for US LNG imports. Egypt and
Nigeria were close seconds. However Trinidad and Tobago was the
most costly source of supply. The least costly LNG came from Equatorial Guinea, a new entrant into the LNG supply picture in 2007.
A major component of the LNG business in 2007 was the more
aggressive use of gas storage, and NATS calculates that storage
played a major role in the surge of imports at Lake Charles during
March-September.
The outlook for 2008 LNG imports is not thought to be as robust as it was in 2007, according to Pan EurAsian. The price profiles
are not as supportive now as last year at this time, it said. Japan’s
need for LNG supplies to displace nuclear electricity generation
capacity this year may keep LNG global prices far enough above
US market prices to reduce the summer and storage replenishment
surge that will occur.

TransCanada plans direct oil line to Gulf Coast
TransCanada Corp. said it is considering building an oil pipeline
directly to the US Gulf Coast from Alberta’s oil sands, press reports
said Feb. 21.
An alternative would be to connect Alberta oil sands with Gulf
Coast refineries by converting underused natural gas pipelines for
part of the route, Chief Executive Officer Hal Kvisle was reported
as saying.
Nearly half of total US refining capacity is on the Gulf Coast,
but the lack of pipeline connections from Canada results in most
Canadian oil sands exports’ being sent to the US Midwest.
TransCanada and ConocoPhillips, in a 50-50 joint venture, already are planning the 590,000 b/d Keystone oil pipeline to the
US Midwest from Alberta, and plan to extend Keystone to the Gulf
Coast refining hub. The $5.2 billion Keystone line is expected to
come into service in late 2009. TransCanada will convert existing
gas pipelines in Canada to oil shipping for much of Keystone’s
Canadian section.
“But if the demand for transportation materializes more quickly, we would look at building a direct line,” Kvisle was quoted as
saying. “Either way, the discussions are well advanced, and this is
one of the future projects that we will be bringing forward here in
the months ahead.”
The proposed pipeline would be competing with others planned
by Enbridge Inc., ExxonMobil Corp., Kinder Morgan Canada, and
Altex Energy Ltd., each of which is proposing an oil pipeline from
Alberta to the Gulf Coast. ✦

Uninvited observations
I understand that the Association for
the Study of Peak Oil & Gas (ASPO) will
not always be invited to speak at CERA
Week (Cambridge Energy Research
Associates annual conference in Houston), but if I had been invited I could
have discussed the CERA 2006 forecast
of future oil production (Journal of
Petroleum Technology, February 2007).
CERA’s prediction is divided into conventional and unconventional oil, and
if we sum the CERA-predicted crude oil
consumption to 2070 we get a number
in the region of 2,000 billion bbl, twice
as much as has been consumed to date.
Production of 70 million b/d in 2070
requires reserves of the order of 500 billion bbl, and current crude oil reserves
are 800 billion bbl. Adding the numbers,
500 billion bbl plus 2,000 billion bbl,
less 800 billion bbl, we arrive at a figure
of 1,700 billion bbl. This is the amount
of oil that must be found and developed
during the next 62 years, or 27 billion
bbl/year. For these figures to work the
oil industry needs to get out and start
looking for oil like crazy.
If we just look 3 years ahead to the
end of 2010, CERA perceives that crude
oil production is set to be 80.8 million
b/d. This is an increase of 8 million b/d
when compared with today’s production. In 2002 ExxonMobil presented a
fantastic graph in their magazine The
Lamp. They showed that the decline in
existing oil and gas fields was expected
to be 4-6%/year for the next 20 years.
Last year CERA presented a detailed
study of the decline in existing oil fields
based on a study of 811 fields, and that
gave an average decline rate 4.5%/year.
We at Uppsala Hydrocarbon Depletion
Study Group have made a study of decline in giant oil fields using data from
333 fields, representing 60% of global
oil production, and CERA’s stated decline
for large fields is of the same order as
our figure for decline. For argument’s
sake, let us use the CERA number for the
rest of our discussion.
CERA’s decline rate for 2008, 2009,
and 2010 means that the industry needs
to fill a gap of 10 million b/d by the end
of 2010. If we then add the increase in

production of 8 million b/d that CERA
predicts, we find that the world requires
new production in the order of 18 million b/d in just 3 years. Is this really
possible?
First we have to turn to Saudi Arabia
and Saudi Aramco as they have the
largest reserves. According to a seminar given in Washington in 2004, they
have 700 billion bbl in place, and the
cumulative production for Saudi Arabia
to date is 119 billion bbl. Out of the
reported 260 billion bbl of reserves
they reported in 2004, they labeled 131
billion bbl as developed, and the depletion rate of developed production was
2.7%/year. A realistic assumption is that
the depletion rate should be no higher
the 3% in 2010. The fact that Aramco
claims to have 700 billion bbl in
ground, have produced 119 billion bbl,
and have 260 billion bbl in reserves

gives a recovery factor of 54%.
Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Officer
Abdallah Jum’ah was invited to CERA
2008 and said that new investment is
expected to boost the company’s oil
production capacity to 12 million b/d
by the end of 2009. With a depletion
factor of 3%, this means that Aramco
must increase their developed reserves
from 131 billion bbl in 2004 to 146 billion bbl in 2010. In 1998 Aramco added
the Shaybah field and 500,000 b/d.
Aramco’s promises amount to new production equal to four Shaybahs and still
require compensation for the decline of
other fields.
Adding the new Saudi oil to the
expected increase of production in new
deepwater projects of around 4 million
b/d plus other new projects providing
an additional 2 million b/d, we end up

with a figure of 8 million b/d of the
18 million b/d needed. We still have to
find 10 million b/d to fill the gap in the
CERA forecast.
If invited I would have covered many
other interesting aspects of future oil
production, but now I would just like
to agree with the invited speaker John B.
Hess, chairman and chief executive of
Hess Corp.: “Given the long lead times
of at least 5-10 years from discovery to
production, an oil crisis is coming and
sooner than most people think. Unfortunately, we are behaving in ways that suggest we do not know there is a serious
problem (OGJ Online, Feb. 15, 2008).”

Oil sands and sustainability

Paula Dittrick
Senior Staff Writer
Canada’s oil sands projects sometimes are portrayed as looming environmental villains. Much of the mainstream media are missing the likelihood
that oil sands producers could prove to
be leaders in advancing carbon capture
and sequestration (CCS) technology.
Oil companies are involved in carbon capture research as part of diverse
efforts to curb greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions that can contribute to climate
change.
Industry alliances aim to help finance
and organize large-scale CCS pilots.
Enbridge Inc. plans to lead a group of
19 oil companies and electric utilities in
the Alberta Saline Aquifer Project, which
will identify potential storage formations and later design sequestration sites
(OGJ, Feb. 11, 2008, Newsletter).
Saskatchewan officials tell OGJ that a
similar alliance is in the planning stages
there.
Integrated CO2 Network (ICO2N)
was formed in late 2007 to develop an
Alberta carbon capture network and
pipeline. Members include Canadian
Natural Resources Ltd., ConocoPhillips,
Husky Energy Inc., Imperial Oil Ltd.,
Nexen Inc., Shell Canada Ltd., Syncrude
Canada Ltd., and Suncor Energy Inc.

Suncor’s goal
ICO2N founding member Suncor
voluntarily reports its GHG emissions
as part of a 10-year-old climate action
plan, which Suncor calls key to “becoming a sustainable energy company.”
The Calgary firm’s 2007 Progress Re-

port on Climate Change reports a 26%
companywide reduction in GHG emission intensity (emissions per bbl of oil)
from 1990 baseline levels. For Suncor’s
oil sands operations alone, emission
intensity has fallen 51% since 1990.
Richard L. George, Suncor president
and chief executive officer, believes
climate change requires determined and
collective action. “The energy industry
has a particular responsibility—and
opportunity—to respond,” he said.
Suncor calculates that management
of its GHG emissions prevented 53.1
million tonnes of CO2 from entering
the atmosphere through yearend 2006
compared with the 1990 baseline.
Every quarter, Suncor’s senior management team reviews company GHG
emissions statistics.
Suncor aggressively pursues technologies, including CCS, to transform
its GHG emissions profile, George said.
This includes improved energy efficiency and reduced reliance on natural gas.
“Technologies such as petroleum
coke gasification could further reduce
our reliance on natural gas,” said the
company’s latest climate change report,
which acknowledges “a new era of
GHG regulation.
“In particular, we are encouraged by
plans to establish funds that large emitters such as Suncor can contribute for
development of transformative technologies,” the company said.
On Feb. 1, a joint federal-provincial
government panel recommended that
Canadian governments invest $2 billion (Can.), to be matched by industry

initial goal is to sequester 5 million

will watch closely to see how industry
might transfer lessons from Alberta’s oil
sands to oil and gas fields worldwide.

GHG contributors
Oil sands promise a steady, reliable
source of energy for decades that will
supplement conventional oil and gas
reserves.
Currently, the oil sands industry accounts for less than 3% of Canada’s total
annual GHG emissions. Suncor’s operations accounted for 1.3% of Canada’s
total GHG emissions during 2005, the
company reported.
New technology is being tested that
could reduce GHG emissions from oil
sands extraction facilities.
Suncor believes the integration of
electric power utilities and heat systems
could lower GHG emissions compared
with current technologies.
Geothermal energy is being considered as a low-emissions alternative to
gas, currently used to provide heat and
steam for oil sands extraction.
Water could be pumped several kilometers below ground where it absorbs
heat from hot rock. Then, the water
would be returned to the surface where
the heat could be extracted and used to
produce steam.
This OGJ writer looks forward to
reporting oil sands producers’ progress toward safe, cost-effective, and
long-term carbon mitigation, management, and storage. In short, this is what
Suncor’s chief executive calls industry’s
responsibility to sustainability.
“We know a significant portion of
GHG emissions from each barrel of oil
comes from its production. However,
approximately four times more GHGs
are emitted once it is used as a fuel,”
George said. “That means there are clear
opportunities to make substantial sustained GHG reductions both when oil is
made and used.” ✦

The surges in Iraq
Thanks to success of the surge dominating
news from Iraq, the time approaches to reconsider
another surge now largely forgotten. The fates of
both surges are linked. The forgotten one relates to
oil production.
Fear once was widespread that Iraqi oil would
gush into the market and crush prices after the fall
of President Saddam Hussein. It was groundless.
Even before the war, the need for repair and modernization of the Iraqi producing industry was
obvious; postwar examination of Iraq’s decrepit
oil fields showed it to be greater than originally
thought. A surge in Iraqi oil production was never
going to come about quickly enough to reverse a
tightening of the oil market under way when the
invasion of Iraq began.

potential surge in Iraqi oil output reasonable to
ponder. By how much might the country raise
production? When and under what circumstances
might the increase occur?
Iraq has an estimated 115 billion bbl of underdeveloped oil reserves, and some observers think the
number might eventually reach 200 billion bbl. So a
longstanding production target of 6 million b/d is
geologically feasible, though not quickly achievable.
In much less time the country could push production capacity to 3.5 million b/d.
Timing for either goal, though, remains uncertain. While the requisite security is coming into
view, the terms under which foreign companies
might invest in Iraqi production projects are not.

Oil industry has new
risk factor: terrorism
David M.Weinberg
Practical Risk LLC

Glenn H. Coplon
Independent research analyst
Falls Church, Va.
Jack F. Williams
Georgia State University College of Law
Atlanta

Although the oil and gas industry
has always encountered elements of
risk, traditional risk meant dry holes,
foreign investments, unstable nation
states, new ventures, and the occasional
natural hazard. Man-made catastrophic
events were not part of the risk profile
and merited little attention beyond risks
associated with insider sabotage or vandalism. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,
2001, in New York and Washington, DC, changed that environment
dramatically and added sharp new
focus to the industry’s approach to
risk.
For reasons ranging from
legal to fiduciary, quantifying
and systematically analyzing this
newly recognized risk have become
increasingly important to an industry
with physical assets around the world.
Unfortunately, typical techniques and
analytic approaches used by businesses
to consider a proper business case for
risk have proven difficult to apply in
this new environment.
For operators, including terrorism
risk seems daunting. The nature of the
risk complicates its analysis. Companies may find it difficult to confront
this new environment of adaptive and
thinking adversaries and scarce relevant
data and incorporate it into the context
of risk management.
However, the industry can sharpen
its approach to this important area by
understanding definitions and quantitative techniques evolving in antiterrorism work. This article suggests ways to
estimate and manage terrorism risk in
oil and gas operations.

Lack of data
Quantification of this “new” type of
risk has become increasingly important,
but terrorism risk computations suffer
from a lack of relevant statistical data.
One cannot use classical probabilistic
risk assessment tools such as those used
in accident analyses where vast databases of component failures exist to enable
rigorous models to be constructed.
At first glance, it appears there is
ample statistical data to employ classic
18

probabilistic models. For example, Rand
Corp. has more than 30,000 terrorist
actions around the world in its database.
The Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism includes over 34,000
terrorist actions committed since 1968
(Fig. 1).1 And the National Consortium
for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism includes over 80,000
terrorist actions since 1970.2 Even with
what appears to be these impressive
databases of terrorism events, Rand
acknowledges that “the lack of historical data makes the use of experts the
only way for modelers to determine the
likelihood of new attacks.”3
There are a number of problems,
pitfalls, and deficiencies associated with
these databases. For example, a quick
read of reported terrorist events exposes
the difficulty of separating terrorist acts
from criminal acts. Such fundamental
problems of definition, the variety of
terrorist organizations and motives,
and the adaptability of terrorist methods and tactics make looking backward
problematic in predicting future events.
Data insufficiency poses problems for
actuarial firms that provide risk models
for the insurance underwriting industry,
primarily because their contemporary
best practices are based, in large part,
on statistical approaches.4
Dating to 1977 is an exemplar discussion of some problems associated
with risk related to such rare events
within the energy industry as an attack
on LNG facilities.5 In looking at terrorist
attacks as both extreme and catastrophic
events, Y.Y. Haimes says, “...no single
probability density function…can be
assigned to represent credible knowledge of the likelihood of such [terrorist] attack scenarios.”6

Deﬁnition of terms
Much confusion surrounding the
topic of terrorism risk stems from the
lack of consistent definitions of terms.
The Security Analysis & Risk Management Association is attempting to
standardize various terms in a lexicon that may or may not be adopted.7
Occasionally, the US Department of

WORLDWIDE TERRORISM INCIDENTS*

Incidents, 1,000

Homeland Security (DHS) publicizes
glossaries, but these tend to be adapted
to fit a particular topic and often are
inconsistent with other DHS publications. Developing a working glossary is
clearly a project in itself and is beyond
the scope of this article; thus, the terms
used here will rely on common usage
or will be defined within the context of
this discussion.
Consistent with traditional literature
on risk, DHS identifies three components:
• Threat.
• Vulnerability.
• Consequence.
To capture the statistical nature of
risk, the risk function classically is represented as the product of the probability and results of a particular outcome.
However, as noted by many authors,
using probabilities based on prior history for dealing with adversaries, e.g.,
Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, or even the Earth
Liberation Front, is limited by their
ability to be adaptive and creative in
devising new attacks. The adaptability of
terrorists in varying tactics, target sets,
diversions, and simultaneity compound
the problem. Further, statistical probability implies that all possible outcomes
are known. Such is certainly not the
case with terrorist attacks.
With these limitations in mind, DHS
created a surrogate for probability. This
surrogate comprises threat and vulnerability. Along with consequence, this
becomes a type of conditional risk that
is a function of many other variables,
only a few of which can be addressed
here.
The US Department of Defense
(DOD) identifies threat as an adversary
having intent, capability, or opportunity to cause loss or damage.7 However,
recent work by J.F. Williams indicates
that, with respect to radical Islamic terrorism, there is a third component to
threat space—authority.8 This additional
threat element has both an internal and
external function.
Internal authority is necessary in order
for a terrorist organization to sustain
its activity on a global level, to main-

tain membership and support, and to
provide religious cover to terror agents
whose actions are viewed as sacramental duties rather than acts of violence.
External authority, better understood
as legitimacy, is necessary to attract
recruits and supporters, to convince
the group’s audience of the legitimacy
and acceptability of target and attack
modes, and to justify the magnitude of
the attack. In fact, Williams’ concept can
probably be expanded to nearly any terrorist organization because, save for the
lone wolf, someone must decide and
commit to carrying out the attack in
some form of cultural threat space.
National security considerations are
not conducive to information-sharing
with the oil and gas (or any private)
industry. Only recently has DHS been
able to participate with fusion centers
in various states, but most personnel
manning these sites deal in classified
intelligence information, which is fed
as appropriate to local law enforcement and national authorities. Gleaning
the intent, capability, and authority of
any given threat stream from such rare
and necessarily nonspecific unclassified reports can be nearly impossible.
However, some sources of unclassified
information —open source intelligence—can help operators develop
profiles of possible threats in their areas
of operation.

If intent, capability, and authority
are known, the precise means, often
referred to as attack mode, may represent a critical independent variable
in an overall estimation of threat. For
instance, Al Qaeda professes that it
would use weapons of mass destruction
(WMD) against the US. While having
the intent and religious authority to do
so, however, at present it appears that it
does not have the capability. Conversely,
the use of improvised explosive devices
(IEDs) of varying sizes is a well-used
tactic, but their effect is less than that of
WMD.
Even if information were available
to estimate the likelihood of a given
type of terrorist attack such as an IED
or vehicle-vessel borne IEDs (VBIED),
questions remain as to selection of the
most cost-effective array of countermeasures. This is because details
necessary to fully determine the likely
delivery “character” of an attack are
seldom discussed. For example, what
is the blast area of a given IED charge
in the target area? Or what is the likely
delivery mode of a VBIED: a lone panel
truck? a convoy with sniper preparatory fire to pin down facility security
personnel?
In many instances, such information
is available, or could be, but doesn’t
seem to be considered newsworthy. As a
result, even facility owners determined

have been found to be of limited value
when comparing vulnerabilities across
a spectrum of assets in various geographies.14
In business, consequences of a terrorist attack are usually measured in
dollars and casualties, which can be
converted to dollars. Other aspects
such as capacity to perform mission or
psychological impacts cannot easily be
quantified, though these can and do
impact continuity of operations, and
therefore profitability. How companies
approach potential losses is reasonably
well established if the loss is part of an
understood threat. Hurricanes do not
learn from previous storms, nor do they
target specific assets to maximize destruction. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of terrorists, the one class
of threat agent that learns and adapts to
developments.

using an approach as described above
tuned to specific circumstances. The accuracy and precision of “risk numbers”
must be considered as highly uncertain
but perhaps no more so than new exploration ventures.
Like other investments, the risk
prioritization approach will provide a
relative ranking. Getting started is usually the biggest hurdle because it seems
overwhelming. However, close collaboration within a company’s security,
finance, human resources and other
departments and among companies
within a particular region will better
prepare everyone for potential losses.
With no statistically valid basis for
estimating a probability of attack, we
are unable to defend a classical costbenefit approach.
However, some method must be
used to rank or prioritize assets, if only
locally, to ensure prudent security investments. Consider the following along
with standard continuity of operations
planning:
• What attack types concern me
most?
• Who are the potential perpetrators,
and what is driving them? It may help
to adopt an “observed or worst-case
terrorist tactic” approach, with different
tactics for each entity (asset-site-regionoperator-country-portfolio).
Close cooperation between, and
acceptance by, each faction of the
company is necessary to maximize risk
management, including threat identification and vulnerability and consequence mitigation.
While quantification of risk can
be difficult, the discipline of working
through it for the company’s most important assets is essential to long-term
security.
Risk is ubiquitous. For this industry,
avoiding it is not a luxury. Although risk
assessment as a tool of understanding
and managing risk through remediation
or loss-transference is as much an art
as it is a science, operators should not
ignore the science dimension. Present

il and gas were pushed to the
sidelines during the National
Governors Association’s 2008 winter
meeting in Washington, DC. But a few
states’ chief executives acknowledged
that traditional energy sources will
have to come off the bench to meet
energy and environmental challenges.
Tim Pawlenty, Minnesota’s Republican governor and NGA’s 2007-08
chairman, unveiled a year-long
initiative, “Securing a Clean Energy
Future,” with goals similar to those
of Congress and the Bush administration: reducing US dependence on
imported oil and cutting greenhouse
gas emissions by developing more
environmentally benign, domestically
produced alternatives.
SCEF would use states’ positions as
utility regulators and their universities to advance research into energy
alternatives and create financial
incentives for their development.
Governors and outside speakers emphasized that business can’t continue
as usual.

the country faces energy inevitabilities including continued US reliance
on imported oil, domestic oil and
gas production remaining vital with
more reliance on unconventional
sources, and increased use of gas
instead of coal to generate electricity.
But Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal, a Republican, warned that using
more gas to generate power won’t
totally solve the greenhouse gas emissions problem. “It’s troubling because
it can lead to production from deeper
formations, which could include as
much carbon dioxide as from coal
and which should include the same
restrictions,” he said.

‘Problems can come up’

Following the meeting, he told
me that ExxonMobil Corp.’s production from deep gas formations
at Short Creek vents 2 Mcf of CO2
for every 1 Mcf of methane that is
recovered. “They’re using some of it
for enhanced recovery, but problems

tiative, said the money could be better
spent on energy efficiency programs,
where spending has plummeted in
recent years.

Other alternatives
Frank Rusco, acting director for
natural resources and environment at
the Government Accountability Office,
told the committee GAO recommends
purchasing more heavy crude, which
would both save money and provide
standby supplies for refineries configured to run more sour grades.
DOE should also consider using
dollar values instead of barrels in filling the reserve because it would let it
buy more oil when prices are low, he
indicated. “GAO found that if DOE had
used this purchasing approach from
October 2001 through August 2005, it
would have saved approximately $590
million, or over 10%, in fill costs.
GAO’s simulations indicate that DOE
could save money using this approach
for future SPR fills, regardless of
whether oil prices are trending up or
down as long as there is price volatility,” Rusco said.
Fredriksen countered that DOE
plans to buy some heavier grades as it
expands the reserve. It currently buys
light and medium crude because they
reflected the US refinery configuration
when the program began. The 11 US
refineries that are configured to process
sour crude would still be able to refine
a limited amount of SPR crude and
maintain their full gasoline production,
she added.
Committee chairman Jeff Bingaman
(D-NM) said he convened the hearing
because SPR policies had been inconsistent not only across administrations, but
also sometimes during a single administration. “We also need to discuss
whether we should be adding more
crude oil inventories or storing refined
products instead, and whether we
should have the government own all of
the oil or whether there are other, more
market-friendly approaches to increasing our supply cushion,” he said.

OGUK said, “Exploration drilling

that the accompanying 60% increase in

Chavez selling off his country’s
oil and gas assets to pay off debts?
Reports say his government is selling
overseas assets owned by Petroleos
de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) and its USbased refining branch, Citgo Petroleum Corp.
In fact, a share of the proceeds
from such sales has been earmarked
for the National Development Fund,
a mechanism that is increasingly used
to pay off domestic expenses.
In net terms, after discounting taxes
and standing debts, ever since 2006 the
combined revenues from asset sales of
PDVSA and Citgo have totaled $3.42
billion, of which $2.77 billion has

build the Citgo brand in America’s

Road Ranger has filed claims
against Citgo for breach of contract
and violations of the Petroleum
Marketing Practices Act caused by the
Venezuelan firm’s unnecessary failure
to supply gasoline to Road Ranger
gas stations, for damaging the Citgo
brand, and for dealing in bad faith.

Damage to Road Ranger

Citgo’s actions threatened the
existence of the Midwestern chain
and caused damages estimated by
Road Ranger to be in excess of $30
million. Road Ranger will also be

signals to invest in low-carbon methods
at the cheapest cost. The European Commission has proposed that it will review
the fuel quality directive to see if it can
use this method instead.
Last month, EC proposed that 20% of
its energy mix comes from renewable
sources by 2020 compared with 8.5%
today. It published a directive to remove
the barriers to the growth of the renewables industry so that it can enhance its
energy security. EC’s proposals will be
debated by the Parliament and Council
later this year before a decision can be
mde on whether they will be adopted
or not.
But £30 billion/year to 2030 of
investment is required to just build
conversion facilities for biofuels, said
Peter New, president of global biofuels
at BP PLC. “That means building a 300
million gal plant every 5-6 days.”
The UK faces a 303 million l. shortfall in biofuel capacity as it aspires to
meet its target of 5% of transportation
fuel from biofuels by 2010, warned
John Seed, managing director of Helius
Energy. But producers and the supply
chain can deliver the raw materials, he
added, because of innovative technology.
Bioethanol and biodiesel are likely
to compete against each other depending on oil prices, incentives for
developments, and penalties, New
said. Challenges facing growth of the
industry include regulation, terminal
investment, forecourt investment, and
product quality. “I think these will be
resolved but it will be a bumpy road,”
New admitted.
New told OGJ that dialogue was
essential with the automobile industry
to coincide its timetable on producing cars for biofuels. About 80% of the
EU’s car fleet will turn over in the next
13-15 years. However, the car industry
is split among those looking at biofuels
and those continuing with diesel-based
cars. Views differ also about what work
needs to be completed under EU regulations.

“Energy efficiency is paramount to tackling carbon emissions rather than rushing to biofuels,” Dings said. “Debating
about the distinction between first-generation and secondgeneration biofuels is useless. The issue should focus on
whether biofuels require new land as this is a sustainability
issue,” he said.
Consolidation of biofuel companies is likely in the
future, said Melissa Stark, partner of energy strategy at
Accenture. She told OGJ that ageing technology would be
a driver in bringing companies together. “Infrastructure
development and financial markets will be critical for the
next 5 years. People want to see volumes on the market to

In the main development, Russia and Serbia signed an
agreement to create a joint company that will build the Serbian stretch of the South Stream gas pipeline.
According to Dmitry Medvedev, the apparent successor to
Russian President Vladimir Putin, the South Stream pipeline
deal, valued at some $1.5 billion, will “form the foundation
of energy stability for all of Europe in the future.”
The statement, alluding to the European need for such gas,
followed the decision by the US and several member states of
the European Union to recognize the declaration of independence made by the former Serbian state of Kosovo.
Russia sided with Serbia and said it will block Kosovo from
joining the United Nations or other international organizations.
Russia’s Putin said Kosovo’s declaration represented “a terrifying precedent,” and he warned the West that the decision
would “come back to knock them on the head.”
On his visit to Belgrade, Medvedev said Kosovo’s declaration of independence violated international law “absolutely,”
and he insisted, “Serbia needs support now.”
That view was rejected by the US Department of State, which
said Kosovo will never be part of Serbia again, but that Washington would keep working on the issue with Belgrade and its ally
Russia, both of which oppose Kosovo’s independence.
“We are going to continue to try to work with both the
Russians and the Serbs on this but I think that it ought to be
clear to everybody at this point that Kosovo is never going
to be a part of Serbia again,” said DOS spokesman Tom Casey
after Medvedev’s visit to Belgrade.

Regarding the South Stream agreement signed by OAO Gazprom Chief
Executive Alexei Miller and his Srbijagas
counterpart, Sasa Ilic, the new company
would draft all details for the pipeline
over the next 18 months, including the
rights and obligations of the RussianSerbian enterprise.
“We allocate 3 months for the creation of the company, and another 18
months for the feasibility study,” said
Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov.
“We expect construction to start no
later than 24 months after the feasibility
study has been completed,” he said.

Kupriyanov said it is important to
negotiate with all the countries participating in the pipeline project—Russia,
Italy, Bulgaria, and Serbia, with Bosnia
and Greece as possible partners—“so
that the feasibility study is integrated.”
The $14.65 billion South Stream
project by Gazprom and Italy’s Eni SPA
is designed to carry Siberian gas to
Western Europe at a capacity of at least
10 billion cu m/year.
Russia also will invest a further €900
million in Serbia’s energy industry, said
Medvedev during a visit to a major Serbian oil refinery in Pancevo. He did not

detail the expenditures.
However, refinery general director
Serzan Bosnjakovic told Medvedev that
a facility would be built at the refinery
with Russian help by 2010 that “will
cost about €500 million” and “meet top
modern standards.”
“We hope that, with your help, the
capacity of the refinery will grow to 7
million tonnes of oil a year,” said Bosnjakovic. The refinery currently processes
5 million tonnes/year of oil.
Medvedev said all the documents on
the investment plan had been drafted
and would be signed “very soon.” ✦

Total reveals $19 billion capital budget for 2008
Total SA plans a $19 billion capital
expenditure for this year, with refining and marketing accounting for $2.5
billion and petrochemicals $1.3 billion.
The balance is dedicated to upstream,
where a $1.8 billion sustained exploration effort is planned.
Other oil and gas companies have
recently released their spending plans
for 2008. These include:
• Marathon Oil Corp. announced
an $8 billion capital, investment, and
exploration budget for 2008 compared
with 2007 spending of $4.8 billion.
• Suncor Energy Inc., Calgary, has
approved a $7.5 billion (Can.) capital
spending budget for 2008, about 80%
of which will target growth in oil sands
projects.
• Anadarko Petroleum Corp. has
approved total capital expenditures of
$4.5-4.7 billion for 2008, including
about 20% for exploration.
• Houston independent Newfield
Exploration Co. announced a $1.6
billion capital investment program for
2008, of which $620 million is allocated to the US Midcontinent region.
• Fort Worth independent Range Resources Corp. reported capital spending
plans totaling $1.065 billion for 2008.
32

This represents an 18% increase over
the company’s 2007 budget.
• Petrohawk Energy Corp., Houston,
boosted its 2008 capital budget to $800
million from $700 million last year.
• Houston independent Ultra Petroleum Corp. approved a 2008 capital
budget of $755 million compared with
$714.5 million spent in 2007.
• Brigham Exploration Co. said its
board approved a $134.4 million capital
expenditure budget for 2008.

Total
Last year, Total dedicated $16 billion
and added 1 billion boe from exploration. Total Chief Executive Christophe
de Margerie said, “We will find barrels
by exploration and not acquisition.”
Total’s upstream production last year
grew by 1.5% over 2006 to 2.39 million boe/d, de Margerie reported.
De Margerie maintained his expectations of an average 4%/year production growth to 2010 based on $60/bbl
Brent crude. At $80/bbl, production
would be less by 50,000 b/d in 2010
under production-sharing contracts.
De Margerie said although 2008
production is uncertain because of the
current economic and geopolitical en-

vironment, “even at an $80/bbl, [2008
production] will exceed that of 2007.”
Total is banking on new fields due on
stream in Yemen and Congo, and the
ramping up of Anguille in Gabon, Dolphin in Qatar, and Rosa in Angola.
The group’s proved reserves replacement rate fell to 23% from 102%,
partially because renegotiation of the
Sincor contract in Venezuela reduced
Total’s stake to 30% from 47%.
Maintaining a proved reserve life
of 12 years and proved and probable
reserve life over 20 years will require
development of new capacities, he said.
Numerous projects extending to 2015
should bring production close to 3.3
million boe/d.

Marathon Oil
Marathon’s increased spending stems
primarily from a 180,000 b/cd expansion at its 245,000 b/cd Garyville, La.,
refinery, the Athabasca oil sands project
in Alberta, and an associated expansion
and heavy oil upgrade at its 100,000
b/cd Detroit refinery (OGJ, Nov. 12,

Ultra expects its 2008 production to
reach 135-140 bcf of gas equivalent,
18-22% higher than its 2007 production. Ultra plans to drill 26 delineation
wells in 2008 under its 5-year plan to
drill 120 delineation wells.
Michael Watford, chairman, president, and chief executive officer, said
the company plans to drill 240 gross
(113 net) wells in Wyoming. About
20% of the net wells will be devoted to
delineation.
“It is extremely important for us to
continue defining the Pinedale field so
we can get our arms around the actual
size of the resource,” Watford said.
Ultra develops long-life natural
gas reserves in Pinedale and Jonah
fields. The company increased its 2009
production target to 170-175 bcf of
gas equivalent from its previously announced target of 160-165 bcf of gas
equivalent.

Rapid development progress at giant
Pinedale and Jonah gas fields in Southwest Wyoming is evident in the yearend financial and operating figures of
Ultra Petroleum Corp., Houston.
The two Green River basin fields
rank among the top six US gas fields by
reserves, said Michael D. Watford, Ultra
chairman, president, and chief executive officer.
EnCana Corp. and BP PLC have the
two largest positions in Jonah, and Ultra
is third. Jonah field, with 1,000 wells
on 36 sq miles, has an estimated 13.6
tcf in place, of which EnCana estimates
slightly more than 60% will be recovered, Watford said.
Pinedale, where Ultra has the largest
land position, covers 90 sq miles and
began to develop 4-5 years after Jonah.
Pinedale has 48 tcf of OGIP, and EnCana
suggests 57% recovery there. Pinedale is
only 8% developed.
Each field is producing more than 1
bcfd of gas.
Ultra in 2008 looks forward to more
year-round field access at Pinedale and
plans to accelerate delineation drilling,
continue development drilling, work
on a downspaced 5-acre pilot, evaluate
nonsand pay projects to add incremental reserves, and explore deeper formations, Watford said.
The company, envigorated by startup of the Rockies Express pipeline to
the eastern US, will nearly double in
2008 the number of Pinedale delineation wells it drilled in 2007.
Ultra is the only entity with production in both fields, Watford said, but
Newfield Exploration Co., Houston, is
now drilling in both.

2008 status
Ultra’s board in late February approved a 2008 capital budget of $755
million, up from the $714.5 million
spent in 2007.
The company forecasts that its production, which comes from Pinedale
and Jonah, will total 135-140 bcfe
this year compared with 114 bcfe in
2007. Its forecast is for production of
170-175 bcfe in 2009 and a prelimi-

nary 200-205 bcfe in 2010.
It plans to drill 26 delineation wells
in 2008 as part of a 5-year, 120-well
delineation program.
Ultra’s yearend 2007 proved reserves
were 2.98 tcf of gas equivalent, up 25%
on the year.
“More importantly,” the company
said, “the third party identified, engineered, and economic resource base net
to Ultra in Wyoming has grown
from 9.9 tcfe to
10.7 tcfe, well on
our way to the 12
tcfe target.”
The company
identified 5,300
undrilled locations at the end of 2007,
up 650 from a year earlier.
Ultra calculated its 2007 finding
and development costs at 98¢/Mcf,
down from $1.10 in 2006. The $4.66/
Mcf realized gas price in 2007 was a
22% decline from 2006, but Ultra’s net
income margin from continuing operations was 32% and its return on capital
27%. The company sold its China Bohai
Bay interests, which did not contribute
to fourth quarter 2007 production.
Ultra’s fourth quarter production
totaled 32 bcf of gas and 255,300 bbl
of condensate. Fourth quarter condensate price was $79.84/bbl in 2007 and
$57.06/bbl in 2006.

With start-up of the Rockies Express
pipeline in early 2008, Ultra is “getting
the best gas prices we ever received in
the Rockies, well above $7,” Watford
said.
Rockies Express is important to
Ultra, an anchor shipper, because it enables the company to deliver gas east of
the Rocky Mountains for the first time.
Within weeks, the pipeline will become
fully operational from Opal, Wyo., to
a connection with Panhandle Eastern
Pipeline near Columbia in Audrain
County, Mo.
Not long ago, the northern Rockies had 6.6 bcfd of takeaway capacity.
Rockies Express added 1.5 bcfd and
will expand to 1.8 bcfd. Several other
systems are planned, perhaps led by El
Paso Corp.’s 1.2 bcfd Ruby pipeline to
northern California, and another pipeline of similar size to Chicago is under
discussion.
A final environmental impact statement regarding Pinedale, expected in
the second half of 2008, is likely to
authorize year-round access to drill and
complete wells in most parts of the field
while still leaving some large areas for
wildlife migration, Watford noted.

“We feel we have a considerable
amount of technically proven but unbooked reserves in the Bakken, Barnett,
and Uinta basin plays,” said Mark Papa,
EOG chairman and chief executive officer.
EOG said it has 24 producing wells
on more than 175,000 acres in what it
believes is the most economic area, is
acquiring more acreage, and plans to reveal more about the play in late February. It said it has leased the vast majority
of the play area.
The company, which is still defining
the productive area’s extent, is drilling
its first 320-acre downspaced well in
the play, explored so far on 640-acre
spacing. Recovery factors at 640-acre
wells are very low, and it will be late
December before it can observe the
downspaced well’s flow rates relative to
offset wells, EOG said.
The company said it is seeing declines of 5-10% lately in rig rates and
stimulation costs compared with 2007
in the Bakken.

& DEVE

It plans to start up a gas processing
plant in March because the Bakken casinghead gas is especially high in natural
gas liquids content.
EOG said it is exploring in other
“shale and unusual rock plays” in the
US that involve horizontal drilling and
will only discuss those efforts after
they have been technically proved and
the company has leased the acreage it
seeks.
EOG is experimenting with horizontal drilling in a couple of resource
plays in the East Texas-North LouisianaMississippi area, which are run from its
Tyler, Tex., office. It said drilling in these
plays has been 100% vertical to date,
and Papa said it might have some good
results to report in 2008.
In a joint venture, EOG and National
Fuel Gas Co., Buffalo, NY, have drilled
vertical and horizontal wells to Devonian Marcellus shale in the northern
Appalachian basin, but it is too early to
discuss results, Papa said. ✦

Atlas sees 4-6 tcf recovery from Marcellus shale
Philadelphia operator Atlas Energy
Resources LLC said it has determined
that it could ultimately recover 4 to 6
tcf of natural gas from the Devonian
Marcellus shale on its properties mostly
in southwestern Pennsylvania.
Atlas Energy controls 483,000 acres
in Pennsylvania, New York, and West
Virginia and is aggressively adding land.
After reviewing the length of its
hydraulic fracs, the company said
it believes it will be able to develop
the formation with vertical wells on
40-acre spacing. That would give it
4,000 to 6,000 potential locations in
southwestern Pennsylvania, where it
is concentrating on 224,000 acres and
where it has drilled all but one of its
Marcellus wells.
Almost all of the southwestern
Pennsylvania acreage has ample pipeline
capacity that is controlled by the company’s affiliate, Atlas Pipeline Partners LP.
Atlas Energy has drilled 27 vertical
40

wells to date, 21 of which are producing into a pipeline. The other six are
to be connected shortly. The company
believes it has largely delineated its
acreage.
Analysis by consulting engineers
implies finding and development costs
of about $1/Mcf, said Richard D. Weber,
Atlas Energy president and chief operating officer.
Weber said, “While the finding and
development costs of our vertical drilling program compare favorably with
the reported results from horizontal
drilling of other shale operators in the
Appalachian basin and elsewhere, we
believe that our horizontal drilling program has the potential to even further
enhance our economic returns from the
Marcellus shale.”
Atlas Energy, which has drilled one
horizontal Marcellus well in southwestern Pennsylvania with an industry
partner, plans to drill at least four more

horizontal wells in 2008.
Consulting engineers Wright & Co.
Inc. assigned 961 bcf/well of proved
reserves to Atlas Energy’s first 14 southwestern Pennsylvania Marcellus wells,
including five initial wells to which
the company applied first-generation
completion techniques.
For the nine later wells where the
company used advanced drilling,
completion, and production techniques,
the consultant assigned reserves that
averaged 1.3 bcf/well and were as high
as 1.8 bcf.
Since adopting the advanced techniques, the company’s initial 24-hr
rates into a pipeline have averaged 1.3
MMcfd and have been as high as 2.6
MMdfd.
“Based on published reports, to
the company’s knowledge, these are
the best initial daily production rates
of any vertical wells in the Marcellus
play. In response to these results, Atlas
Energy plans to drill and complete at
least 150 vertical Marcellus shale wells
over the next 18 months,” the company said. ✦

The derrick is tall enough to accommodate drill pipe in stands of four joints
(“fourbles”), although offline pipe handling and storage is limited to stands of
three joints.

XY cantilever
The XY cantilever design was pioneered on the Maersk Innovator.1 The
cantilever can skid transversely (X)
as well as longitudinally (Y) and
eliminates the need for a transverse
skidding substructure. The rig can
skid transversely and the rig can move
with pipe in the derrick, saving time
between wells, Maersk says.
The XY cantilever has a 70-ft reach
from stern to well center and a transverse reach of 46 ft. Maersk can alter
the design further, “similar to what was
done to Maersk Inspirer,” where cantilever reach was extended to 100 ft from

Drilling

This article examines
the difference in axial stresses of aluminum and steel tubulars during drilling
and concludes that aluminum tubulars can reduce cost and extend the
reach of drilling operations.
The cost of drilling depends on
the size and weight of the equipment employed to drill the well.
Density of tubulars is an important parameter that has significant
impact on the capacity and size
of drilling equipment required. It
may be possible to reduce drilling
costs by employing oil well tubulars
made of materials lighter than steel.
It is well known that aluminum
is widely available and less expensive than steel. So for the purpose of
reducing drilling costs, why not use
aluminum tubulars in oil well drilling?
The choice of material dictates both
the tubular stresses and strength. This
article discusses the technical viability
of employing aluminum-based tubulars
in oil well drilling and assesses the tubular stresses expected during common
drilling operations with aluminum and
steel tubulars.

Design
When designing a drilling tool and
46

components, engineers take anticipated
loads and stresses into consideration
and select components to meet or exceed the maximum anticipated stresses.
The required strength of oil well
drilling equipment depends primarily
on maximum anticipated stresses and
safety factors. These stresses include tension, compression, pressure, bending,
and torsion.

The objective of this study is to
investigate the changes in magnitude
of axial stress when aluminum or steel
tubulars are used in the drilling process.
It shows the advantages and disadvantages of using aluminum-based
composite materials by comparing the
results of stress and strength requirements of aluminum and steel-based
materials in different drilling aspects,
such as derrick loads, bending loads,
buckling loads, stress and strain, and
hydraulics.

Derrick loads
The derrick supports the weight of
drillstring, casing strings, drilling lines,
blocks, and tackle. The sum of all these
loads is the derrick load. Total derrick
load is not shared equally by each leg.
One leg (with the dead line anchor attached) will always support more of the
total load than the three others. Conservatively, the equivalent derrick load,
equivalent to four times maximum leg
load, generally determines the required
minimum derrick capacity.
Equivalent derrick load depends on
hook load and the number of drilling

lines. It can be calculated with Equation
1.2
For comparison, we determined the
equivalent derrick loads for aluminum
and steel drillstrings (Table 1). The table
shows that equivalent derrick loads can
be reduced 65% if aluminum is used
for drill and casing strings instead of
steel in an 8,200 ft well.

Buckling loads
Drillstrings buckle when compression exceeds critical buckling load.
Critical buckling load is defined as the
load at which tubulars have no resistance against lateral displacement. Even
though lateral displacement of pipe
during the initial stages of buckling is
terminated by the clearance between
the wellbore and pipe, some researchers believe this initial buckling, usually 2D, is followed by 3D
helical buckling.6 Therefore,
Fig. 1
compression should be kept
below the critical buckling
load.
In order to determine
critical buckling loads of
aluminum and steel pipes,
researchers studied 2D,
non-linear buckling using
finite-element analysis (Table
4).6 Predictably, steel pipe
can handle twice as much
compression as aluminum
without initiating buckling.

Stress, strain
The relation between stress
and strain is expressed by
Hooke’s law, shown in Equations 10-12.
One might expect larger
stretch in aluminum strings
as compared with steel pipe.
However, because aluminum strings weigh less, their
7.0
stretch will not be as large as
expected. Table 5 illustrates
that both aluminum and steel
materials stretch close to the
same amount for a given pipe length.

Frictional pressure losses
Parasitic pressure losses in downhole tubulars due to fluid flow depend
on five main parameters: pipe length,
diameter, flow rate, density, and viscosity. With all other parameters constant,
pressure losses can be determined as
a function of pipe diameter. Fig. 1 illustrates pressure losses vs. OD of pipe
using the data from Table 6.
With the rest of the parameters held

outer diameter increases. This is simply
because of decrease in hole-pipe clearance.

pressure drop increases to 105 psi from
51 psi.
Fig. 1 also illustrates pressure losses
for different internal pipe diameters.
Contrary to the previous case, as the
internal diameter increases, pressure
losses decreases. This can be attributed
to smaller Reynolds numbers at larger
diameters.
In this example, increasing the internal diameter to 5.776 in. from 4.276
in. caused a reduction in pressure loss
to 88 psi from 332 psi.
An important observation here is
that the overall effect of increasing pipe
inner and outer diameters is a decrease

in cumulative pressure loss. In this
case, overall pressure drop was 190 psi
(about 42%).
Tubular sizes are generally specified
after examining stress loads, derrick
load capacity, and drilling fluid hydraulics. As mentioned above, using
aluminum tubulars in place of steel
can significantly reduce derrick loads
and tubular stresses. This allows the
use of larger diameter pipes that will
have lower parasitic pressure losses and
satisfy the required hydraulics with a
smaller slush pump.

Pressure loading
Any analysis of pressure loading on
pipe must consider internal yield pressure, collapse pressure (Lame’s equation), and plastic collapse pressure.
Internal yield pressure is the magnitude of internal pressure that leads
to the internal yield failure (burst) of a
pipe under axial stress, calculated with
Equations 13-14.
Table 7 shows the differences in internal yield pressure of aluminum and
steel pipes. Aluminum and steel pipes

have different adjusted yield strengths.
For this case, the yield strength of N-80
steel casing is considered to be 80,000
psi and the strength of aluminum-based
alloy is 69,618 psi. The yield strength
value of E-75 steel drill pipe is considered to be 75,000 psi.
Collapse pressure-API Bulletin 5C3
recommends four equations for computing the collapse pressure resistance
of tubulars.7 The choice of equations is
based only on the inside diameter to
wall thickness (D/t) ratio of the tubular.
The first equation is a theoretical equation based on the yielding of the inner
wall of a tubular. It is known as Lame’s
equation in the mechanics of materials.3
The second equation is empirical,
derived from collapsing 2,488 tubes of
three different grades: K-55, N-80, and
P-110. API calls these values the “plastic
collapse pressure” of tubes.
The third equation is an arbitrary
equation generated by associating the
plastic collapse equation with the elastic
collapse. It holds no theoretical or empirical substance.
The last equation, Equation 15, is

a theoretical equation based on the
bifurcation of the wall of the tubular
without yielding. Equation 15 includes
the parameter σYPa, defined in Equation 16. In the example, we chose casing dimensions that allowed us to use
the elastic collapse equation, as there
is no empirical collapse equation for
aluminum tubulars at this point.
Table 8 shows that an aluminum
casing segment in suspension, with
8,200 ft of casing hanging from it, can
resist up to 9,152 psi collapse pressure.
Therefore, using aluminum casing in
this hole is more favorable than using
C-75 steel, as steel casing can only support 9,044 psi.

O D U C T I O N

Calculating von Misses stress for a
curved well showed that the required
minimum yield strength for aluminum
pipes is 52% less than steel (Table 3).
Results of stress and stretch calculations
based on Hooke’s law proved that aluminum strings do not stretch more than
steel strings under their own weight
(Table 5). Collapse resistance of casings
is determined with Lame’s theoretical equations for some d/t ratios. Table
8 shows that with 8,200 ft of casing
hanging in the hole, aluminum casing
has greater collapse resistance than C-75
steel casing.

2. Drillstring axial and bending
stresses are lower due to the smaller

safely.
3. Von Misses stress can be reduced,
which suggests fewer axial failures.
4. Aluminum pipe stretch, under its
own weight, is less than that of steel.
5. Running larger-diameter aluminum pipe in place of smaller-diameter
steel pipe can reduce frictional pressure
loss in the wellbore during circulation.
This results in a lower equivalent circulating density and requires a smaller
pump.
6. Collapse strength of casing can
increase as weight decreases.
There are some disadvantages to
using aluminum pipes as well. For
instance, the burst strength of pipes is
reduced as weight decreases, and the
critical buckling load in aluminum
pipes is less than that of steel pipes. This
could be major drawback in extended
reach drilling. ✦

tively high risks. Brenntag, however,
succeeded in removing all hydrocarbons from the pipeline, bringing the
LEL down to a unique 0%.

Background
The crude transport line required
modification in two places, and some
block valves needed to be overhauled
to safeguard its operation. Performing
these activities necessitated
emptying
and cleaning the
transport
line, ensuring the safety of its internal environment to eliminate danger of explosion
during welding and cutting.
The maximum allowed LEL was 10%
or less, which had to be achieved with
the following additional requirements:
• A time frame of about 5 weeks to
complete the project.
• Application of compressed air to
transport pigs through the pipeline.
• Minimum waste disposal.
• Specific safety precautions set by
the client.

The water also cleaned all chambers
of the block valves, which were thoroughly flushed as the chemicals did
their work.
At the Vlissingen receiving site
Brenntag created a steel dump line from
the receiver to a temporary knockout vessel connected to containers.
Equipping the pigs with transponders
allowed the velocity of the pig train to
be reduced to about 0.5 m/sec near
the refinery. The first pig, including the
column of water, followed the normal
flow direction into Total’s storage tanks
during collection. Arrival of the second
pig triggered a closing of the normal
flow direction, with a temporary dump
line opened to collect the rest of the
fluids and debris via the knockout vessel into the storage containers. Receipt
of the third and fourth pig followed the
same pattern.

The conclusion of pig collection
required a second line depressurization. A knockout vessel equipped with a
20-in. demister accomplished the bulk
of depressurization over 6 hr.
Marsac measured the LEL of the outflowing air during depressurization at
three sites, finding 0% LEL at each of
them:
• The launching site at MOT in Rotterdam.
• The receiving site in Vlissingen.
• Block valve station S3.
This safe inside-line environment
helped VSH perform required cutting
and welding activities within the budgeted time-frame without any spillage
or emission to the environment.

MOT in Rotterdam to Total’s refinery in
Vlissingen. Two bidirectional separation pigs interspersed by a column of
water of about 24 cu m helped accomplish refill, again using the demister. All
out-coming air entered the environment without spray. The internal LEL
remained 0%. ✦

New shaft seal pumps lubricant back to bearing

All-metal progressing cavity pump handles hot ﬂuids
Here’s the Vulcain progressing cavity
pump, a new product with an all-metal
design that is capable of pumping hot (as
high as 660° F.) and viscous fluids. It’s
suited for use in thermal recovery of heavy
oil.
The company says that the rotary action
of its pump outperforms beam pumps in
overall system efficiency and is less fragile
than electric submersible pumps. The
pump provides low submergence production capability and can operate at low
downhole pressures and higher viscosities.
The pump’s seals reduce the risk of on-

New low-friction Waveseal shaft-sealing
solutions feature a specially molded lip to
form a sinusoidal or wave pattern around
the shaft surface.
Seals enable lubricant to be pumped
back to bearings and protect against
contaminants in applications including
gearboxes, motors, transmissions, drive
systems, speed reducers, and pumps.
This pattern enables lubricant to be
pumped back to the bearing for optimized
lubricant retention while pushing dirt
away from the lip-shaft surface (regardless of which way the shaft is turning) to
protect against contamination.
The specially designed lip additionally generates 25-35% less heat at the
contact point (minimizing premature

seal failure due to heat checking, blistering, hardening, or lubricant breakdown);
generates 20% less friction torque or drag;
curbs shaft wear; and provides greater lip
lubrication compared with standard lip
versions, the firm says.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

CBO: CO2 tax
the best move on
climate change
The Congressional Budget Ofﬁce is right
to favor a tax on carbon dioxide over other
possible US responses to climate change.
But it omits an important reason.
In a February report, CBO compares a
CO2 tax with an inﬂexible cap and two capand-trade systems.
It uses three criteria: efﬁciency, implementation considerations, and consistency
with mitigation efforts elsewhere in the

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

world.
CBO considers a CO2 tax the best option.
Net beneﬁts of a tax could be ﬁve times
those of an inﬂexible cap, the worst option,
CBO says.
Second-best, according to the agency,
would be a cap-and-trade system with a
price ceiling plus either a price ﬂoor or
banking provisions. Cap-and-trade schemes
set limits on total CO2 emissions and assign
emission allowances to regulated companies. The companies can sell allowances
they don’t use and buy extra allowances
they need.
A price ceiling would limit unexpected
cost surges and help coordinate a US
system with those in use elsewhere. Under
banking provisions, companies could hold
allowances for use in the future.
Third-best in CBO’s ranking is a cap
varying with the price of allowances along
with banking plus either of two other
features: a limit on how much the cap could
tighten if allowances exceeded a certain
price or the ability, adjustable by government, to borrow future allowances for
earlier use.
Obviously, the cap-and-trade schemes
require government intervention. CBO
doesn’t say so, but so large an ofﬁcial hand
in potentially so large a market would create opportunities for corruption. Small details about system design, implementation,
and operation could be worth big money to
people willing to pay for advantage.
But that’s not the missing reason to favor a straight-up tax as a tool for discouraging CO2 emissions.
However they came about, meaningful
cuts in CO2 emissions would be painfully
expensive. People, not businesses, would
bear the burden. Inﬂexible caps and capand-trade schemes are just camouﬂage.
Governments determined to require CO2
cuts despite questions that the effort can
affect global temperature must warn people
about the cost. Proposing a tax is the clearest way to do it.
It is, in fact, the only honest option.

Crude closes above $100/bbl
For the ﬁrst time ever, a front-month contract for benchmark US light, sweet
crudes closed above $100/bbl Feb. 19—at $100.01/bbl, up $4.51 for the day—after setting a new intraday record of $100.10/bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The expiring March contract hit a subsequent high of $101.32/bbl in intraday
trading Feb. 20 before closing at a record $100.74/bbl in New York, having climbed
more than $10/bbl over the seven previous sessions as Venezuela announced it
would halt direct oil sales to ExxonMobil Corp. (OGJ Online, Feb. 13, 2008). The new
front-month April contract closed unchanged at $99.70/bbl after ﬂuctuating between
$97.99/bbl and $100.86/bbl in the same session, but its “ability to rebound from the
day’s low” demonstrated “its remaining intrinsic strength,” said Olivier Jakob at
Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland. With this strong technical rally, NYMEX crude futures
prices moved to the top of the wider $86-100/bbl range that has been in place since
October. Jakob said, “It is one thing to trade technically within a range, but it takes
conviction to break it.”
Crude futures ﬁrst touched $100/bbl in intraday trading Jan. 2 during the ﬁrst
NYMEX session of 2008, then climbed a few cents above that historic high in the
next session before falling back in subsequent weeks. But it ﬂuctuated generally at
$85-95/bbl for several weeks prior to the latest price run-up.
Prices climbed as several recent incidents reminded traders that petroleum supplies are nearly always at risk. Four workers were injured Feb. 18 in an explosion
and ﬁre at Dallas-based Alon USA Energy Inc.’s 70,000 b/d sour crude reﬁnery in
Big Spring, Tex. (OGJ Online, Feb. 19, 2008). The entire reﬁnery was damaged in the
mishap, ofﬁcials said, and may resume only partial operations in 2 months.
Henry Okah, leader of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta,
was extradited from Angola to face charges in Nigeria for murder, arms dealing, oil
smuggling, and other crimes. That could ignite a new round of violence by militants
that would derail peace talks between the Nigerian government and the rebels.
Energy prices pulled back Feb. 21 with crude down to $98.23/bbl, ending a
6-session rally, when the Energy Information Administration reported a larger-thanexpected increase in US crude inventories. But on Feb. 22, the April contract pushed
as high as $99.37/bb before closing at $98.81/bbl. None of these incidents materially
affected market fundamentals of supply and demand. But as often happens, they
provided the excuse for traders to move in the direction toward which they were
already inclined.
US inventories
EIA reported crude inventories rose 4.2 million bbl to 305.3 million bbl in the
week ended Feb. 15, up from a Wall Street consensus of a 2.7 million bbl increase.
Gasoline inventories gained 1.1 million bbl to 230.3 million bbl in the same week vs.
Wall Street expectations of a 500,000 bbl increase. Distillate fuel inventories fell 4.5
million bbl to 122.5 million bbl, more than the expected decline of 1.7 million bbl.
Imports of crude into the US increased by 365,000 b/d to 10.1 million b/d. The input
of crude into US reﬁneries fell, however, down 97,000 b/d to 14.5 million b/d with
reﬁneries operating at 83.5% of capacity that week. Gasoline production declined to
8.8 million b/d, with distillate fuel production down to 4 million b/d.
Michael C. Schmitz, Banc of America Securities LLC, New York, said, “The largerthan-expected build [in crude] was primarily due to a decline in reﬁnery utilization
from 85.1% the prior week to 83.5% (the lowest since March 2006) due to seasonal
maintenance, combined with an increase in imports to 10.1 million b/d from 9.7
million b/d the prior week. Thus, current crude inventories of 305 million bbl, which
equate to about 21 days of demand coverage, were 6.8% below last year and 0.6%
above the 10-year average. Gasoline production averaged 70,000 b/d lower than
the prior week with low utilization being partially offset by above-normal product
yields....Total [gasoline] imports remained essentially ﬂat.”
Jacques H. Rousseau, an analyst at Soleil-Back Bay Research., noted that reﬁned
product inventories of gasoline, distillate, and jet fuel dropped 4.7 million bbl (1.2%)
vs. the prior week, marking “the ﬁrst decline in 9 weeks.” Rousseau said, “We expect
this positive trend to continue due to seasonal rising demand (which increased 6%
week-over-week) and lower supply. We view falling inventories as a leading indicator for improvements in reﬁning margins and share prices.” He said reﬁned product
inventories should decline by 10% by the end of the ﬁrst quarter.

Yeah, cheap
imitations
make us
laugh, too.

There is only one.
Pretenders have tried to match the performance of our Tricone bits.
And why not? Hughes Christensen has defined the industry standard for
roller cone bits since, well, since we created the first one back in 1912.
Of course our commitment to improvement and the industry’s largest
R&E spend make Tricone a pretty tough act to follow. After all, there is
only one king.
Thank you…thankyouverymuch.

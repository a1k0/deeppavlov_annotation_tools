COVER
Tullow Oil PLC and its partners used the Belford Dolphin deepwater drillship to drill the Mahogany-1 well off Ghana and found oil
last June within a Cretaceous sandstone reservoir.The well reached
13,780 ft TD on the deepwater West Cape Three Points Block.This
first discovery on the Jubilee field was the beginning of Ghana’s
journey to becoming an oil producer by 2010 despite exploration
since 1896.The special report, which starts on p. 20, looks at the
challenges operators are facing in West Africa as competition for
acreage intensifies, governments change policies, and project costs
rise. Photo from Kosmos Energy.

Deutsche Bank slashes 2008 oil demand outlook

DOE suspends SPR oil purchases to year end

Major investment bank Deutsche Bank has reduced its global oil
demand growth forecast for this year to 840,000 b/d from 1.16
million b/d. This is lower than the latest growth estimates by the
International Energy Agency, the US Energy Information Administration, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Even with the demand downgrade, Deutsche Bank’s call for
OPEC crude rises 200,000 b/d due to slipping forecasts for nonOPEC supply growth.
Oil is holding at over $125/bbl despite concerns of economic
weakness and expectations of a strengthening US dollar.
“The forecasting tug-of-war continues between bearish analysts
who believe that marginal costs near $75/bbl will dominate and
those who see the need for demand destruction price levels near
$150-200/bbl,” said Deutsche Bank’s Adam Sieminski. “We see increasing risk to the upside until demand shows more response to
either price or income elasticities.”
The bank’s current forecast for average 2009 West Texas Intermediate and Brent crudes is $102.50/bbl, supported by a weak US
dollar and funds-flow issues.

The US Department of Energy said May 16 that it will not sign
contracts this year to continue filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve from July through December.
The announcement came 2 days after the Senate passed the
House’s version of legislation suspending SPR purchases for the
rest of the year unless crude oil prices fall below $75/bbl (OGJ
Online, May 14, 2008). The measure passed both chambers by
large enough margins to assure that a presidential veto could be
overridden.
Up to 13 million bbl of crude won’t be added to the SPR.

Goldman Sachs sharply raises oil price forecast
To balance worldwide economic growth with weak oil supply
growth, oil prices will rise 14% in the second half of 2008, according to investment bank Goldman Sachs.
Goldman Sachs said the price surge is needed to balance
global GDP growth of 3.8% against oil supply growth of just 1%.
The bank’s average second-half 2008 WTI price forecast is now
$141/bbl, up from a previous estimate of $107/bbl. The average
WTI price in the third quarter is forecast at $135.30/bbl, rising to
$145.60/bbl in the fourth quarter.
Long-dated oil prices need to rise at a rate that will force demand growth in line with supply growth. And despite expected
price increases, a contango market—in which prompt-month futures prices are higher than prices in later months—is likely to
return, according to the report.
“Although we expect inventories to build in May, which will further pressure WTI term structure, ... we do not expect these softer fundamentals to translate into spot-price weakness given the strength in
long-dated prices. We expect the bullish structural market to dominate
the bearish cyclical weakness, dragging the market higher.”
High prices are required to achieve a needed slowdown in
demand growth, as opposed to thinking about it the other way
around, i.e., that weakened demand growth creates lower prices,
Goldman Sachs said. “We estimate that the rise in oil prices since
2002 has already destroyed 5 million b/d of demand relative to if
oil (had) stayed at $20/bbl.”

Willbros settles corrupt payment allegations
Willbros Group Inc. and its Willbros International Inc. subsidiary agreed to pay a $22 million criminal penalty for violating the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the US Department of Justice said
on May 14.
DOJ had charged the oil and gas engineering and construction
firm with bribing Nigerian and Ecuadorian officials to secure contracts in 2003-05.
Willbros Group also agreed to pay $10.3 million in disgorgement of all profits and prejudgment interest under a US Securities
and Exchange Commission settlement. Four former employees also
paid fines and settled SEC charges.
Willbros was charged with conspiring to bribe Nigerian and Ecuadorian officials, authorizing corrupt payments, falsifying books
and records relating to corrupt payments, and implementing a tax
fraud scheme. DOJ deferred prosecution of Willbros for 3 years,
saying it would dismiss the criminal information then if Willbros
abides by the agreement.

France prepares for gas trading exchange
Gaz de France, its transmission subsidiary GRTgaz, and Total
SA’s transmission operator Total Infrastructure Gaz France (TIGF)
have given strong support to the Powernext project to set up a gas
trading exchange in France to develop a competitive market.
GDF and GRTGaz have become shareholders of Powernext
through a 6.6% and 5% stake respectively. Each will have a seat
on the board of directors. TIGF “will implement the appropriate
operating conditions to facilitate it.”
The exchange, Powernext officials said, “will promote the emergence of an efficient liquid and transparent market as requested by
France’s Energy Regulatory Commission and the European Commission. There will be a matching of supply and demand in transparent and nondiscriminatory conditions and the setting up of a
price reference for the French market.”
Powernext Chief Executive Officer Jean-Francois Cornil-Lacoste
said a preliminary market model will soon be provided to expert

BG Norge ﬁnds oil, gas in Norwegian North Sea
BG Norge AS has found oil and gas with exploration well
15/12-19 on Production License 292 (PL 292) in the Norwegian
North Sea. The well, combined with the nearby 6/3-1 discovery,
could hold as much as 3-5 million cu m of oil equivalent.
The well, south of Varg field, tested 750 cu m/day from Jurassic
and Triassic reservoirs, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said.
BG gathered data from the well and is carrying out field development studies.
The Maersk Guardian jack up rig drilled the well in 86 m of
water to 3,169 m TVD subsea. The well will be plugged and abandoned.
BG has 60% interest in the license, and its partner Lundin 40%.

Trinidad and Tobago offers ﬁve blocks for bid
Trinidad and Tobago said bids will be welcomed in the third
quarter for five new exploration blocks in its 2008 bid round. They
include:
• Block 4(b) in 400-800 m of water off Trinidad and Tobago’s east coast. It lies just east of BG Group’s prolific Dolphin field,
which holds more than 5 tcf of gas.
• Block 5(d), also off the east coast, is north of the Manikin gas
discovery in 450-800 m of water.
• NCMA (3), (4), and (5)—all off the northern coast—are believed to be gas-prone. They lie in more-shallow water (100-550
m).
The minister said he is hopeful bids will be awarded by January
2009.
He also said three 2006 ultradeep water bid parcels will be rebid in 2009.

A joint venture set up by Irkutsk Oil and government-affiliated
Japan Oil, Gas, & Metals National Corp., is scheduled to start testdrilling for oil in the region as early as this winter.
Irkutsk Oil will invest more than $500 million on operations
over the next 7 years. The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development will provide partial financing and will acquire an 8%
stake in the project.

Taitai discovery extends Uganda prospectivity
The Taitai-1 oil discovery at Taitai in the Butiaba area of Uganda’s Block 2 cut 5 m of net gas pay and at least 8 m of net oil pay,
said Tullow Oil PLC. A thick section of oil-stained basement was
also encountered and provides upside potential at this location and
elsewhere in the basin, the company said (see map, OGJ, Feb. 11,
2008, p. 36). The well was drilled to a TD of 1,006 m and was
successfully logged. Downhole pressure testing and sampling confirmed the presence of movable 30° gravity oil and a potential oil
column as thick as 80 m in sands above the basement play.
“The uppermost oil sand exhibited high permeability; however
pressure sampling of underlying oil sands was inconclusive....[So ]
the well is being sidetracked and the oil-bearing zones cored to
collect further reservoir and fluid information,” said Tullow.
Taitai-1 well is the first of a nine-well exploration campaign in
the Butiaba area.

Deeper gas proved in Norwegian Sea’s Alve ﬁeld

Exploration extension drilling in Alve field in the Norwegian
Sea confirmed natural gas and condensate in a reservoir deeper in
mid-Jurassic sandstone than was previously known. Operator StatoilHydro said a thin oil zone also was proved below the gas.

CERA: upstream costs up 6% over 6 months
Constructing upstream oil and gas facilities has increased by 6%
over the past 6 months and have doubled since 2005, according
to the most recent IHS Inc.-Cambridge Energy Research Associates
(CERA) Upstream Capital Costs Index (UCCI).
The UCCI is a proprietary measure of project cost inflation similar in concept to the Consumer Price Index. It provides a benchmark for comparing costs around the world and draws upon proprietary IHS and CERA databases and analytical tools.
Areas with a high level of projects under way in the Middle East,
West Africa, South America, and Australia have seen higher than

average cost increases, compared with areas of moderate escalation
in North America and Europe.
“Rising costs have become one of the ‘new fundamentals’ driving the price of oil,” said Daniel Yergin, chairman of CERA.
Increased demand for raw materials and transportation is driving costs, which are contributing to delays and postponements of
many projects, said Pritesh Patel, director for the Capital Costs Analysis Forum for Upstream, a CERA Industry Forum. “Exchange rate
fluctuations and the weakening US dollar also contribute.” Because
the dollar is the reporting currency of choice, this weakness has a
dramatic effect on final construction costs for projects in regions

such as Europe and West Africa, Patel said.
The biggest leap on CERA’s UCCI was for deepwater subsea
equipment, particularly umbilicals and control systems. These costs
have jumped by 12% over the past 6 months due to manufacturing
constraints and higher costs for materials and labor.
The costs of vessels used to install platforms, lay pipe, and
support offshore development also are on the rise after briefly
leveling off in 2007. Their rates have increased 2% in the past 6
months.

Gazprom winter gas production beats previous year’s
OAO Gazprom increased natural gas production in the first 4
months of 2008. Despite a relatively mild 2007-08 winter between
January and April, Gazprom produced 199.4 billion cu m (bcm)
of gas (about 7 tcf), 4.2 bcm more than for the same period in
2007.
Current forecasts call for Gazprom’s production to hit about
570 bcm for 2010, growing to 610-615 bcm/year by 2015 and
650-670 bcm/year by 2020. By that time, new fields will account
for nearly a half of all gas produced.
Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said growth of the
company’s gas reserves has considerably surpassed its production
for the third year running. “According to preliminary estimates, in
2007 our success in exploration led to an increase in discovered
reserves” to 585 [bcm], while production was 548.5 [bcm].
In 2006, he said, exploration increased reserves by 590.9 bcm,
while production totaled 556 bcm. In 2005, the figures were 583.4
bcm and 555 bcm, respectively.
Gazprom’s strategy is that by 2010, three new gas production
centers will be operating: the Arctic shelf, Yamal Peninsula, and East
Siberia-Far East, which are “expected to develop into major production hubs over time,” it said.
In the near future, Shtokman and Bovanenkovo, two fields in the
Arctic shelf and Yamal, will be put into operation.

Parker plans two newbuild arctic land rigs
A BP PLC subsidiary signed a letter of intent with a Parker Drilling Co. subsidiary for a drilling contract in Alaska requiring two
newbuild land rigs.
A 5-year drilling contract, with a 5-year option, is expected to
be executed by May 30, Parker said. Operations are anticipated to
commence during the second half of 2010.

Processing
Navajo reﬁnery FCC unit down for repair
The Navajo Refinery in Artesia, NM, is operating at reduced
rates because the FCC unit has been shut down for repairs. Owner
Holly Corp. said crude charge of the 85,000-b/d refinery has been
cut by 55,000 b/d while repairs are under way.
An instrument control malfunction required shutdown of the
FCC unit May 7. Catalyst circulation problems during restart forced
another shutdown May 16. Holly says repairs to take several days.
The unit has reported capacity of 18,500 b/cd (OGJ, Dec. 24,
2007, p. 50).

The arctic-class land rigs will feature safety-engineered equipment to reduce vibration, noise, and personnel hazards; technology to decrease well times and increase the number of wells drilled
each year; onboard command center centralizing decision-making
processes; and fully enclosed rig modules for operation in arctic
conditions down to –50° F.

Oilexco lets UK North Sea subsea work to Technip
Oilexco North Sea Ltd. has signed an agreement with Technip
SA for engineering, project management, and construction services
for subsea developments at Shelley oil field and other fields in the
UK North Sea.
Using the Ocean Guardian, Oilexco drilled 22 well bores in
Shelley field to define the limits of the oil accumulation.
The company expects the contracted Sevan Voyageur FPSO to
begin production in the fourth quarter.
Technip will provide diving support, trenching support, and
umbilical installation vessels, inspection, repair, and maintenance.
It will execute the engineering, installation, and commissioning of
pipelines, a control umbilical and jumpers, flexible risers, a subsea
manifold, and attendant flowlines.

Norway cuts 2008 oil production forecast
Norway has revised its oil production forecast for 2008 to 2.4
million b/d—down from the previous projection of 2.5 million
b/d—in its revised budget for this year. The estimate includes natural gas liquids and condensate.
The Norwegian energy ministry said it expected oil production
to continue falling because of maturing Norwegian continental
shelf fields.
However, gas production will increase, with gas sales at 100
billion cu m in 2008, estimated to be 10% higher than in 2007.
In 2009 gas sales are expected to increase to about 110 billion
cu m.
Operators have planned 125 billion kroner investment in 2008,
including exploration, which also is 10% higher than 2007.
The country has produced about a third of the expected recoverable petroleum resources, with more oil coming on stream than
gas. The ministry said about half of the total expected oil resources
have been produced.
The government expects to receive 356 billion kroner net cash
flow from the petroleum industry in 2008 because of high oil
prices. ✦

to slumping demand in Japan for such refined products as gasoline,
gas oil, and fuel oil.
Demand for these products has been surging in China, however,

Tesoro R&M agrees to civil penalty for air violations
Tesoro Refining & Marketing Co., San Antonio, has agreed to
pay a $1.5 million civil penalty to settle air-quality violations
at its 166,000-b/d Golden Eagle refinery at Martinez, Calif. The
refinery is the company’s largest facility and the second-largest

refinery in Northern California.
San Francisco’s Bay Area Air Quality Management District
(AQMD) said the settlement covers violations that occurred over 3
years, including “failure to inspect tanks and equipment, air pollution releases that resulted from equipment malfunctions, and administrative and reporting violations.”
Tesoro will undertake capital improvement projects and equipment upgrades. It will replace several outdated systems with equipment incorporating the best available pollution control technology.
AQMD also said Tesoro also agreed to retrofit heavy-duty diesel vehicles in and around the refinery with particulate traps to reduce
particulate pollution. ✦

Another Northeast offshore LNG terminal proposed HubLine pipeline system, operated by Spectra Energy, Houston.
Excalibur Energy (USA) Inc., a 50-50 joint venture of Canadian Superior Energy Inc. and Global LNG Inc., New York, reported
plans to build a 2.4-bcfd LNG terminal off New Jersey and subsea
pipelines to shore.
The proposed $550 million Liberty natural gas transmission
line will consist of a “fully submerged, offshore gas importation
turret anchored to the seafloor” in 100 ft of water 15 miles off
New Jersey; 50 miles of 36-in. OD subsea pipeline; a directionally drilled underground shoreline approach near South Amboy,
NJ; and 11 miles of 36-in. onshore pipeline to interconnections
in Linden, NJ.
Gas transmission capacity in the Linden area totals more than 4
bcfd. Excalibur will submit US permit applications early next year
and targets late 2011 for start up.
Excalibur said the project is not associated with Houston-based
Excelerate Energy, which has pioneered offshore LNG terminals off
Texas and the UK and operates several regasification carriers.
Excalibur, while declining to identify the specific offloading
system planned, said the regas vessels will “temporarily connect to
permanently anchored turrets.” Roger Whelan, Excalibur’s president and CEO, told OGJ the company has narrowed its choices of
technology and expects to announce that within the next 3 weeks.
No LNG supply contracts have been signed, but Whelan said
Atlantic Basin suppliers, especially Trinidad and Tobago’s Atlantic
LNG Train X, currently under design, are logical sources.
He said the US Energy Information Administration has projected that the US Northeast’s growing population will “need an additional 30% more energy in the coming decades relative to the current demand, with energy shortfalls beginning as soon as 2012.”
The project has been developed over the last 2 years, he said,
and “included an independent survey of 1,000 New York and New
Jersey residents and discussions with several key stakeholders in
the area.

With the inaugural delivery, Excellence will offload 1 bcf of gas
to test all of the port and pipeline systems. The system will be able
to handle peak deliveries of 800 MMcfd of gas through two turret
buoys and under normal operations will deliver about 500 MMcfd
(OGJ Online, May 19, 2008).

Italy streamlines permitting for LNG, regas plants
Last October, Italy’s Council of Ministers approved plans to simplify and accelerate the permitting process for new LNG terminals
to ease planning restrictions, which had prevented several LNG terminal developers from securing final planning approvals for their
facilities.
The new plans no longer require operators to consult the public
works council Consiglio superiore dei lavori pubblici. Instead, Italy’s Environment Ministry will conduct and complete an environmental impact assessment for final authorization by the Ministry
of Economic Development, the Ministry of Environment, and the
Ministry of Infrastructure.
ERG SPA Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Garrone said the 8
billion cu m/year regasification terminal his firm plans to build
with Royal Dutch Shell PLC at Priolo, Sicily, has received environmental clearance after a 3-year wait.
In February, Italy’s Il Sole 24 Ore said the project had already
cost 15 million euros.
Construction can now begin in 2010, and the facility will be
operational in 2013. The plant’s capacity can later be expanded to
12 billion cu m/year.
Earlier this month, Italy’s environment ministry also approved
plans by Compagnie Industriali Riunite SPA’s energy unit Sorgenia
SPA and northwest utility Iride SPA for construction of an LNG terminal at Gioia Tauro in Calabria (OGJ Online, May 2, 2008). ✦

Maximizing gasoline volume
The huge and growing gasoline
demand dictates that refiners maximize
gasoline volume. After maximizing component volumes and meeting octane and
other specs with minimum give-away,
what else can be done?
One way to get a few more barrels is
to optimize blending to get the highest
octane blending values possible while
meeting all the specs. This will allow
slightly lower reforming severity, giving
a slight increase in volume. However, the
blending linear program will not achieve
this goal if inaccurate blending values
are used.
Use of refinery blend data is almost
guaranteed to produce inaccurate blending values relative to octane (incremental blending values). One reason
is narrow composition ranges which
multiply extrapolation errors. Another
is inaccuracy of octane numbers which
can be expected in refinery operation. A
third reason is high correlation between
component percentages, which leads to
large compensating errors. This results in
misleadingly good prediction accuracy,
when the incremental blending value is
too high for component A and too low
for component B.
Accurate incremental blending values
can be obtained in well-conducted laboratory blending studies. If appropriate
people are not available to plan and carry
out such a study, a generalized octane
blending program is available.1
When there is space in the gasoline
for normal butane, a slight increase in
volume might be available by maximizing use of normal butane in the low
aromatic grade while using isopentane
in the high aromatic grade.2

SUBSEA TIEBACK FORUM & EXHIBITION

THE DEEPEST SHOW ON EARTH
March 3 - 5, 2009
Henry B. Gonzales Convention Center | San Antonio, TX

SUBSEA TIEBACK
FORUM & EXHIBITION

PennWell invites you to the 9th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition. SSTB has become the premier
event for one of the fastest growing field development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March
3 – 5, 2009 in San Antonio, TX at the Henry B. Gonzales Convention Center. Over 2,000 people and 150
exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference. You can’t afford to miss it.
This year’s theme is “The Deepest Show On Earth.” As our industry changes, the sharing of knowledge and
collective experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety, and economics of the
subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by industry leaders. As in the
past, only by participating in this conference will you be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will
not be published and no Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room stays inside the conference
room. We hope you will join us.

SUCCEEDING In A Changing Environment
As the industry shifts to deeper water, the environment in
which we work becomes more complex, hazardous and
expensive. Successful companies recognize early the
changing conditions and environmental challenges facing
the industry. At the Deepwater Operations Conference &
Exhibition in 2008, participants and attendees will discuss
how to succeed under these extreme conditions.
The seventh Deepwater Operations Conference & Exhibition
will be held on November 4 – 6, 2008 in Galveston, Texas

and will see a return to the luxurious Moody Gardens Hotel
and Conference Center.
Plan to attend, sponsor and exhibit at the 2008 conference
and exhibition as the technical focus shifts to “Succeeding
in a Changing Environment.” As with our past conferences,
proceedings will not be published and the press will not be
invited to assure conﬁdentiality between the attendees and
the speakers allowing the most up–to–date information to
be shared.

Saudi oil and Congress
Oil consumers have reason to feel relieved that
Saudi Arabia hasn’t increased production by more
than the 300,000 b/d now widely disparaged as
inadequate. They also have reason to cringe after
the latest energy abomination from the US Congress: passage by the House of a bill empowering
the Department of Justice to take antitrust action
against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
Yes, the market needs more oil. But it needs
lighter and sweeter crude oil than what will
become available from any immediate Saudi
production hike. The market also needs enough
production potential in reserve to meet demand
surges and supply disruptions. And consumers
need energy governance based, for a change, on
an adult view of these complexities.

Too small?
US President George W. Bush received news of
the Saudi production increase on May 16 during a visit to Riyadh at which a request for more
oil topped the agenda. Most analysts deemed the
increase too small to reverse the recent surge in
crude oil prices. Indeed, on the day of the announcement, the futures price of light, sweet
crude set yet another record. It has increased since
then.
The price increase can be seen as substantiating
the inadequacy of Saudi Arabia’s gesture. So suspicion builds that the desert kingdom is restricting supply to drive up the price of oil—suspicion
manifest in the heavy margin by which the House
approved antitrust litigation against OPEC. But a
different explanation deserves notice.
A production increase of 300,000 b/d may be
all Saudi Arabia could have implemented without
spooking the market and driving up prices even
more. The Saudis have a longstanding policy of
holding 1.5 million b/d of production capacity
idle as a supply buffer. This is deliberate production restraint. But it helps consumers by providing
a measure of market stability.
According to International Energy Agency and
US Energy Information administration data for
April, the new output increase pulls spare Saudi
production capacity close to the 1.5 million b/d
minimum. Idle capacity scattered elsewhere in the

world, all within OPEC, totals 500,000-800,000
b/d after deductions for countries where political
unrest makes production hikes improbable. The
total is barely enough to cover loss of production
from, say, Venezuela or Nigeria. The market stays
jumpy when spare production capacity is this low.
A production hike much greater than 300,000
b/d would have brought the important Saudi buffer below its floor level and legitimately alarmed
traders.
Another reason the Saudi increase didn’t lower
reported oil prices is that marker crudes—the ones
that make headlines—are the light, sweet oils that
the market increasingly craves and not the heavy,
sour oil available from incremental Saudi production. To sell the new oil, the Saudis will have to
discount it enough to encourage purchases for
storage. The price effect will be a widening of the
spread between low and high-quality grades. The
volumetric effect will be a shift in low-value oil
from one market cushion, idle production capacity, to another, inventories. The jump in marker
prices after the Saudi announcement makes evident that the market considers a reduction in spare
production capacity more significant than lowvalue oil headed for storage.

Relaxation in sight
Relaxation of this anxiety is in sight. Production
capacity will increase soon as major projects come
on stream in Saudi Arabia and other members of
OPEC. For consumers distressed by high oil prices,
this is excellent news. Increased supply and expansion of market buffers are essential to price relief.
And global demand growth is slowing.
The market will need even more new supply
in the future—supply that will result from investments planned now. With its misguided bill targeting OPEC for antitrust harassment, Congress
has given group members a strong reason to
chill their investments. Lower investment means
lower future supply in a market under pressure,
from population growth and industrialization,
to expand. The combination is a formula for oil
prices higher than they would be if Congress
acted as though it knew something about the oil
market and genuinely cared about the interests of
consumers. ✦

Ghana due ﬁrst oil output in 2010 with Jubilee start-up

Tullow Oil PLC will make history

oil ﬁeld off Ghana in 2010 through a
ﬂoating production, storage, and ofﬂoading vessel.
Oil exploration in Ghana began in
the late 1890s, and there have been
numerous oil and gas seeps in the Half
Assini area. Until Jubilee, however, no
signiﬁcant discoveries had been made.
The ﬁeld, discovered last year in
1,500 m of water and estimated with
90% probability to hold 170 million bbl
of recoverable oil, straddles the boundary between the West Cape Three Points

tic gas use driven by power generation
and industrial development. The government has launched its Domestic Gas Supply Obligation (DGSO) with an immediate effect requiring operators to set aside
gas production for local markets.
Emmanuel Odusina, Nigeria’s gas
minister, told OGJ that the allocation
varied among companies, depending on
three variables: reserves, amount of gas
used commercially, and amount of gas
flared. Essentially, the company having
the greatest volumes of gas would contribute the most to the domestic market.
Odusina is gathering comments
from companies on their obligations
in line with their supply plans. About 1
bcfd of gas is expected to be allocated
to the market initially, growing to 4-5
bcfd over 5 years.
Nigeria is determined to develop its
local, regional, and export markets concurrently, although preference to date
has been given to exports. Expansion of

that could be straightforward to develop. Tullow is testing ﬂow rates into July
to determine potential production rates
and to collect oil samples for analysis.
Mahogany-2 will be suspended for use
as a potential development well.
The Hyedua-2 and Mahogany-3
wells, which will be drilled later in the
year, will test the updip and the southeastern extents of Jubilee.
Moses Boateng, managing director
of Ghana National Petroleum Corp.,
said the FPSO would have a processing capacity of 60,000 b/d of oil and
80 MMscfd of gas with a minimum of
1 million bbl of storage for the ﬁrst

phase of development. Minimum water
injection would be 100,000 b/d from
the start, and the gas produced would
be reinjected or transported to shore
for power generation.
GNPC is carrying out a gas-market
survey to determine domestic requirements. The FPSO’s capacity could be
upgraded to about 120,000 b/d and 170
MMscfd.
Ghana’s politicians have stressed
their determination to overcome the
economy-distorting “resources curse”
as their country becomes an exporter
of an as-yet unknown amount of oil.

between the Obiafu CPF and Ajaokuta to deliver gas from the east to the

Ige told OGJ that, although NNPC
was undergoing reform, it was also
examining these gas opportunities and
would invest as appropriate.
“There is no compulsion for investors to team with NNPC,” he said. “Our
decisions will be commercial ones.”
But potential operators are worried
about the effectiveness and independence of the proposed gas regulator
under industry reforms.
Another issue is risk mitigation
because supply would come from the
troubled Niger Delta. The impact of
Nigeria’s gas policy regime is still to
be clarified for existing and proposed
projects.
Tony Chukwueke, director of the
Department Petroleum Resources
(DPR), said third-party access was a
major priority under the gas master
plan and would be obtained through
government-facilitated agreements.
“Companies can get access to gas that is
being flared, pay existing operators to
produce gas on your behalf, or produce
it yourself,” he said. The DPR and oil
companies are discussing flaring targets.

Petroleum reforms
With changes starting in June, Nigeria’s revamp of its petroleum industry
aims to improve efficiency and eliminate conflict of interests among agencies, said Emmanuel Egbogah, petroleum advisor to the president.
NNPC is often criticized for delaying
projects due to bureaucracy and managers fearing blame if decisions backfire.
The reforms are expected to take up to
2 years to fully implement.
The government is considering partially privatizing NNPC.

African producers grapple with issues of transparency
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
Despite billions of dollars in revenue
from oil exports, many African oilproducing countries continue to suffer
poverty and disease, largely due to
corruption, conﬂict, and mismanagement. Part of the solution, according to
many analysts, is broader disclosure of
oil revenues—or transparency.
African national oil companies
(NOCs) need to improve the transparency of their revenues in their home
territories compared with their activities abroad, according to Juanita
Olaya, revenue transparency program
manager at the anticorruption group
Transparency International (TI).
“There is a huge difference between
companies that have an anticorruption
practice and those on stock exchanges
and those that are not. None of the
NOCs are listed unless they operate
abroad to seek capital so they need
regulation within their own home countries to make them operate better when

“We want to make ownership
more spread out amongst Nigerians,”
Egbogah said. “And the government
would have no less than 40%. Then it
would be a business enterprise with reduced interference by the government.”
A national energy council, chaired
by the president, will be formed to set
policy. Operators will answer to the
Petroleum Inspectorate Commission,
the technical and commercial regulator
of the upstream business that would
subsume the current DPR.
Egbogah told OGJ that a new National
Petroleum Research Center comprising
representatives from different oil companies would address specific industry
problems, integrate technology development programs, and offer technical
consultancy and laboratory services.
Under the reform, NNPC would
become an operating company, named
24

it comes to revenue transparency,” she
told OGJ.
Because of inconsistent reporting,
information on oil revenue often is difﬁcult to obtain, interpret, and compare
across companies and countries.
According to a recent TI report
ranking 42 international oil companies
(IOCs) and NOCs in the transparency
of revenue reporting based on publicly
available data, Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. and Algeria’s Sonatrach are
middle-level performers that disclose
relatively little about revenues and
anticorruption programs. They need to
increase their reporting on policy and
management systems as well as all
areas of revenue transparency, TI said.
GEPetrol (Equatorial Guinea), Societe Nationale des Petroles du Congo
(Congo-Brazzaville), and Sonangol (Angola) were among the worst performers, lacking disclosures on payments
and anticorruption efforts. “Further
improvement for this group requires
increased reporting on all areas of
revenue transparency at all levels of

implementation,” TI said.
Reasons for poor disclosure included conﬁdentiality clauses and difﬁcult
environments, but Olaya called upon
all companies in this group to negotiate for transparency.
However, the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers criticized
the methodology and data by TI for its
report. “Much of this was proprietary
and irrelevant to the issue of transparency,” the association said.
In February, Conger (former Zaire),
Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar, Congo
(Brazzaville), and Sao Tome and Principe became candidates for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI), launched in 2002 as a program
whereby companies voluntarily publish
what they pay and governments disclose what they receive.
As candidates, the nations must
publish a fully costed work plan agreed
with other stakeholders. The next stage
will be full compliance with the EITI
through dissemination of the information on revenues.

National Oil Co. (NAPCON), and would
forgo its present regulatory and policymaking functions (OGJ Online, May 9,
2008).
“It will focus on how to make itself
competitive both domestically and
internationally with its own capital
from international and local markets,”
Egbogah said. Basic business units will
be incorporated joint ventures instead
of joint ventures. The change would enable NAPCON to secure funding from
the market instead of relying on the
government.
NNPC is looking for an additional
$3.8 billion this year to meet its JV
commitments. The government has provided $4.9 billion. On May 20, NNPC
signed upstream finance deals with Total
SA and Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN)
for a total of $3 billion. The loans will
help the government reach its target for

domestic gas needed for power projects
and local industrial development.
According to the agreement with
Total, NNPC will borrow $1 billion and
pay back the loan with cash rather than
crude oil as in the past. Similar terms
were reached with Mobil, but the sum
is $2 billion.

Angola’s growth
Elsewhere in Africa, Angola has overtaken Libya as the region’s second most
prolific oil producer.
At 1.695 million b/d last year, the
country’s output was up 20% from the
2006 level. Libya’s 2007 production
was down slightly at 1.7 million b/d. In
February, the latest month for which data
are available, Angola’s production averaged 1.919 million b/d and Libya’s, 1.76
million b/d (OGJ, May 12, 2008, p. 62).

nantly from deep water, however, with
thick salt layers and diapirs complicating technical problems.
At present, Angola has 21 deepwater
fields on production. Start-ups within
the last year include BP PLC’s Greater
Plutonio complex on Block 18 and ExxonMobil Corp.’s Kizomba C on Block
15. Next year, Chevron Corp.’s Tombua
and Landana fields on Block 14 are
scheduled to start production, which
will hit 100,000 b/d. And in 2011 Total
SA’s Pazflor on Block 17 is expected to
produce first oil.
Speaking at the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston, Graeme
Stewart, the Resource Development
Manager for BP in Angola, said seismic
imaging, subsea acoustic monitoring,
and real-time downhole data were key
to successfully starting Greater Plutonio.
The field has 43 wells: 20 producers, 20
water injectors, and 3 gas injectors.
Steward said “world-class seismic”
provided “very clear imaging of the
subsurface,” which he called “absolutely
critical to targeting wells.”
The US Energy Information Administration expects Angolan oil production to
peak at around 2.5 million b/d in 2011
and fall to 2.4 million b/d by 2013.
Analysts worry about how Angola’s
joining OPEC at the beginning of 2007

will affect production.
Syanga Abilio, vice-president of
state-owned oil company Sonangol,
told OGJ: “We joined the institution
that works to protect price, and it was
important to be part of that. We were
an observer at OPEC for a long time.
We have a quota of 1.9 million b/d,
but that does not bind us on further
exploration and production. We had our
oil infrastructure destroyed during our
civil war, and there is nothing to fear
with future investment.”
Spiraling costs are a major problem
for operators in Angola. According to
Chris Brown, West African analyst at
Wood Mackenzie, Edinburgh, projects
under development in Angola could, at
$30-40 billion, be double the cost of
those now on stream. Pointing out that
Angolan production-sharing contracts
are based on internal rate of return,
Brown said, “Much of the upside is
taken by the country; thus, if development costs are high, Sonangol will lose
a higher percentage, but both company
and country will lose out.”
Angola’s latest licensing round attracted interest from 200 oil companies
in 10 blocks: the onshore Cabinda
Centro Block in the Cabinda Centra
basin and KON11 and KON12 in the
Kwanza basin; shallow-water Block 9;

deepwater Blocks 19, 20, and 21; and
ultradeeepwater Blocks 46, 47, and 48.
The government has prequalified 40
companies and suspended its blockproposal deadline while it evaluates
applications by private Angolan companies.

Angolan LNG
Angola’s focus so far has been
oil, but natural gas is also of growing importance with the development
of Angola LNG and the formation of
Sonangas, a subsidiary of Sonangol that
will focus on gas development.
The Congo basin holds the best
potential for gas. Sonangol’s Abilio said
Sonangas is mapping and interpreting
geological information and plans to
drill a well by the end of the year.
Angola LNG will gather otherwiseflared gas to produce 5.2 million
tonnes/year of LNG targeting the US
Clean Energy terminal near Pascagoula,
Miss., in 2012. Associated and nonassociated gas will come from Blocks 15

0 and 14 (Chevron Corp.). The partners
will also develop previously discovered
nonassociated gas fields on Blocks 1
and 2 to supplement the gas produced
with oil. The plant will also process 125

House passes bill to create oil antitrust task force within DOJ
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US House passed, by a vote of
324 to 84, a bill that would create a
new oil antitrust task force within the
Department of Justice. Supporters of
HR 6074, which also would give DOJ
authority to sue foreign oil cartels for
violating US antitrust laws, included
103 Republicans, according to its sponsor Rep. Steve Kagen (D-Wis.).
“Until we finally have an energy
policy other than drill-and-burn, this
bill will begin to set things right for the
American people,” Kagan said following

the vote. “We cannot drill or grow our
way out of this energy crisis. We must
begin to think differently in America.
That includes loosening the stranglehold
other nations have on our economy and
exploring new forms of energy.”
The new “Petroleum Industry Antitrust Task Force” would be charged with
determining the existence and extent of
gasoline price gouging, anticompetitive
price discrimination by refiners, actions
to inflate prices by constraining supplies, and possible oil price manipulation in futures markets, Kagen said.
The bill, which would amend the
Sherman Antitrust Act, also requests a

Government Accountability Office study
on the effects on competition of prior
oil industry mergers and divestitures,
he indicated.
“This legislation will address the
loopholes and exemptions that oil
companies exploit at the great expense
of our citizens,” Kagen said. “By passing
the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act,
the House agrees that it is time to give
US authorities the ability to prosecute
the anticompetitive conduct committed by international cartels that restricts
supply and drives up prices.”

Frequent investigations
Opponents disagreed when Kagan
introduced the bill on May 19. “It
seems that every year, Congress conducts a new investigation of the oil
industry,” said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). “By my estimation, in this House,
committees have held no less than 20
hearings, and that’s on gas prices. In
the House Judiciary Committee alone,
we’ve held two hearings just this year
and there’s another one scheduled for
May 22,” he added.
Gasoline prices have continued to rise
despite such oversight, King continued.
“As the Federal Trade Commission [FTC]
has reported, changes in world oil prices
have explained 85% of the changes in
the price of gasoline in the US. The
price of gas at the pump closely tracks
the price of a barrel of oil in the world
market. Further, the FTC has repeatedly
found that there is no broad-based collusion to fix prices or engage in price
gouging in the retail sale of gasoline.”
This would be the second time the
House considered a No Oil Producing
and Exporting Cartels (NOPEC) bill,

T E R E S T
which would attempt to change the
Act of State doctrine and the concept of
sovereign immunity, King said. “There
is no certainty that enabling the attorney general to sue [the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries] for an
antitrust violation will result in lower
gas prices for Americans. Given the
instability that such a suit might create
in the world oil market, this legislation
would be long on psychic compensation but short on actual returns to
America’s pocketbook,” he maintained.
King urged House Democrats to consider bills that would authorize federal
leasing on the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge’s coastal plain and on more of
the Outer Continental Shelf instead. “I
recognize that this bill will likely pass
the House again, but I urge the majority to quit with the cheap theatrics and
easy votes,” he said.

House leaders respond
House leaders responded to H.R.
6074’s passage along party lines. “The
House voted today with a strong bipartisan and veto-proof margin to hold for-

eign oil cartels and Big Oil accountable,”
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said.
The legislation gives DOJ “a critical
tool to pursue antitrust actions against
OPEC-controlled entities for fixing
prices,” creates a new oil industry task
force within DOJ, and requires that
major oil company mergers in recent
years be examined for anticompetitive
effects, she said.
“Instead of using a veto threat to
shield cartels and Big Oil companies
from accountability, the Bush administration should work with Congress to
protect consumers,” Pelosi said.
Minority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.)
said that with the price of oil nearing
$130/bbl, consumers deserved more
than warmed-over legislation seeking
to authorize federal lawsuits against
overseas oil producing nations.
“Unfortunately, what we saw today
on the floor was more theatrical than
substantive in nature,” he declared.
Republicans plan to offer proposals later
in the week to produce more oil and
refine more gasoline domestically, Blunt
said. ✦

MMS prepares for 2008 hurricane season
Officials from the US Department
of the Interior’s Minerals Management
Service participated in a media forum
May 15 with representatives from the
US Coast Guard and the American
Petroleum Institute to discuss new final
rules regarding enhanced information
on hurricane conditions. The groups
also discussed the design of offshore
structures and the actions needed to
reduce risk of severe damage to basic oil
and gas structures in the Gulf of Mexico
in the event of hurricanes this season.
MMS work in environmental and
personnel safety proved worthy during
the 2005 hurricane season, according
to Walter Cruickshank, MMS deputy
director. Before hurricanes Katrina and
Rita passed through the gulf, a total of
748 platforms (93%) and 101 drilling
rigs (75%) were evacuated safely with
26

no personnel injuries.
Last month MMS published a new
regulation, effective May 15, incorporating three API bulletins that impose
more-stringent design and assessment
criteria for new and existing structures
in the gulf.
“Our belief is that this regulation
will help increase the survivability of
offshore infrastructure in the event of a
storm,” said Cruickshank. “We can say
today that we are much better prepared
than we were 3 years ago.”
MMS launched a hurricane web site
last year in an effort to better inform
the public about evacuations, production shut-in statistics, historical information, and links to other federal agencies involved in hurricane preparation
and response.
As part of the response effort, MMS

has been testing its continuity of operations (COOP) plan this week. “COOP
took place [May 15-16] and tested
our ability to transition from our New
Orleans region site to [Houston] and
to handle the reporting of offshore
evacuations and production shut-ins,”
explained Lars Herbst, MMS regional
director, Gulf of Mexico region. He said
the drill was a success.
Since Katrina and Rita, the Coast
Guard has placed a liaison officer at
MMS’ COOP site to pass information
between MMS and Coast Guard headquarters in New Orleans.
The Coast Guard’s contingency plans
are based on saving lives, being able to
reopen critical ports and waterways,
and responding to environmental damage, said Joel R. Whitehead, Coast Guard
District 8 commander. ✦

during the May 15 hearing.
“I think the disagreement today
involves the timing for developing the
legal framework for leasing. We believe
it should happen only when we know
the water needs, the water resource
impacts, and the energy needed to produce oil from oil shale,” Ritter told the
committee.

Unanswered questions
“I recognize that it could provide
significant economic and employment
opportunities for Colorado,” Ritter
continued, “but we believe we need
to answer these unanswered questions. Providing certainty for potential developers is important, but only
when we understand the impacts.”
But another witness, C. Stephen
Allred, assistant US Interior secretary
for lands and minerals management,
said EPACT’s existing provision already provides the means for developing an environmentally sound and
economically viable oil shale industry
to help meet future US energy needs.
“Accordingly, I would urge Congress
to repeal the current prohibition on
finalization of the oil shale regulations,” he said.
He said EPACT Section 369 uses a
three-pronged approach. First, it permits oil shale research development and
demonstration projects to ensure that
technologies can operate in an economically and environmentally acceptable
manner before expanding to commercial-size operations. Second, it requires
development of the PEIS to identify the
most prospective federally-held oil shale
areas in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming.
Third, it develops commercial oil shale
regulations so companies can make
research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) investment decisions now
so that optimal processes are developed
when the government is ready to move
forward on commercial leasing.

And then there’s water
Water is an additional problem because the area is arid with relatively low
annual rainfall and an existing overcommitment of water supplies and facilities,
Smith continued. He said that the Rand
report cites an estimate by the Office of
Technology Assessment (which went
out of business when Republicans took
control of Congress in early 1995) that
traditional oil shale operations could
require 2.1-5.2 bbl of water for each
bbl of shale oil product.
“While the new in situ processes
may require relatively less water, the
Rand report notes that ‘considerable
volumes of water may be required for
oil and natural gas extraction, postextraction cooling, products upgrading
and refining, environmental control systems, and power production,’” he said.
Local water agencies in the area have
estimated that a 500,000 b/d oil shale
industry would require 25,000 acre ft/
year of water, either from new sources or
diverted from existing uses, according to
Smith. “Such supplies of water adequate
for the newer oil shale technologies
might not be available and, even if they
are, might not remain available in a
changing global climate,” he said.
Ritter said Colorado is rapidly approaching its full allocation of Colorado
River entitlements and soon will enter a
new period of trading and sharing water
among different users. “We do not know
what the environmental impacts will be
on both surface water and groundwater
quality due to extraction operations, particularly when considering experimental
in situ technologies,” he said.
O’Connor responded that Shell will
not proceed unless it can demonstrate
that it can produce oil from oil shale
without threatening Colorado’s groundwater. “We’ve been able to demonstrate
that this process works. The question
now is whether it will work in a large
commercial project. We need regulations and desperately need them now.
It’s not a coincidence that no one has
developed oil shale commercially. The
regulations have not been there,” he
told the committee. ✦

William E. Kovacic told the chairman,
Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), exactly

Noting that diesel fuel historically

the Energy Information Administration reported that week that diesel

Two days before the hearing, EIA

implementation, resources companies
need to understand and actively manage
the other three main drivers of business
success around climate change: customer attitudes, technology innovation, and
new business models,” Van’t Noordende
said.

Consumers, regulators mindful
Deloitte said recent concurrent
surveys of state public regulators and
US residential electricity consumers indicated that regulators expect the costs
of producing electricity to be higher,
while consumers would pay higher
rates to help mitigate climate change.
In a survey of 50 state public utility
regulators, 87% expect the costs of producing electricity to rise next year. Fuel
prices were cited as the key contributing factor by 35%, while 23% cited
environmental compliance, 21% cited
capital costs, and 11% cited inflation.
In the consumer survey, 62% said
they would be willing to pay 5% more
on their electric bills to stop GHG emissions. When asked about specific technologies, 55% said they would pay 5%
more to support clean coal technology.
Deloitte’s consumer survey, based on
telephone interviews with 1,000 adults,
showed 82% of participants believe
it’s important for regulators to impose
laws reducing GHG emissions, yet 45%
did not know whether their state had
passed such regulations.
Of state regulators surveyed, 83%
said they are somewhat or very concerned with GHG emissions, and 70%
indicated it was important to mandate

regulation, Deloitte reported.
When asked to rank preferences
for various GHG emissions-reduction
technologies, regulators ranked nuclear
power as the preferred technology,
while energy efficiency technologies
were second, renewable energy ranked
third, and clean coal ranked last.
Nearly 90% of consumers surveyed,
said they believe that increased consumer use of renewable energy sources,
such as wind and solar, will help the
environment.
Greg Aliff, Deloitte vice-chairman
and US Energy & Resources leader, said
consumers “show a desire for moreefficient energy and a willingness to pay
some amount for it. The real question
is just how much these technology

Murkowski asks Senate
to swiftly ratify Law of
the Sea treaty
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US could forfeit several billion
barrels of oil equivalent if the Senate
doesn’t ratify the Law of the Sea treaty
soon, warned Sen. Lisa Murkowski (RAlas.) in a May 8 floor speech.
Noting that she has spoken frequently about the 10-16 billion bbl potential
beneath the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge’s coastal plain, Murkowski said
“an unquantifiable amount of resource
may lie—even further to the north,
beyond ANWR, off the coast of Alaska
and beyond.”

estimates that the Arctic Ocean may
cover 25% of the world’s undiscovered
oil and gas resources. That number,
based on a 2000 assessment of a few
Arctic basins, could prove conservative

Shell blasted
over Iraq oil

P

olitical activists say Royal Dutch
Shell threatens to trigger greater
conflict in Iraq with plans to control
the development, production, and
depletion of the country’s oil.
The warning from a coalition called
Hands Off Iraqi Oil came as Shell held
its annual meeting amid alleged “resistance” to the company’s “bid to assume
control over oil reserves.”
Protestors from the coalition, including War on Want, Platform, Voices
UK, and Iraq Occupation Focus,
planned to demonstrate outside the
annual meeting in London and question the board of directors inside.
In the view of the protestors, Shell
wants “a controlling stake in the
Kirkuk oil field, Iraq’s oldest and second largest producing field, and the
site of deteriorating ethnic violence,
as well as the Maysan field in the
south of Iraq, and the Akkas gas field
in Iraq’s Anbar province.”
Campaigners warn that “Iraq
would lose billions of pounds in oil
income under a proposed new law
which the British and US governments are pressing the Baghdad
administration to sign.”

There seem to be some non-sequiturs here. Worse, such statements fly
in the face of facts because the Iraqi
government itself recognizes that
international oil companies (IOCs)
represent the best way for the country
to develop its hydrocarbons.
“The state simply cannot do
this thing right,” said Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Barham Salih. “We
can regulate it, but we need private
investment to develop Iraq’s production capacities,” Salih told a group
of delegates last week at the World
Economic Forum in Sharm el-Sheikh.

Reputable IOCs

At the time, Salih told The Times
of London that new exploration
showed his country has the world’s
largest oil reserves, with as much as
350 billion bbl.
The figure is triple the country’s
present proved reserves and exceeds
that of Saudi Arabia’s estimated 264
billion bbl of oil.
Salih said the new estimate had
been based on recent geological
surveys and seismic data compiled by
“reputable, international oil companies...This is a serious figure from

“What is the problem with this
situation? The fact is, we believe the
potential in the Arctic under the ice
may be enormous, but we have no legal
claim as a nation to most of this oil or
gas unless the United States becomes a
party to the Law of the Sea convention,”
Murkowski said.
“I can tell you, if we’re not willing
to claim it, if we don’t step up to claim
it, others will,” she declared.
The treaty allows a coastal state to
exert sovereign rights to all resources,
living and nonliving, within its exclusive economic zones out to 200 nautical
miles, or essentially its outer continental
shelf, she explained. But it also allows
a nation to lay claim to an extended

said.

of its extended OCS, she said.
“This is an area five times the size of
France. For those of us thinking a little
closer to home, that is three times the
size of Texas. I believe it is only a matter
of time before other claims are accepted
as well,” she said.
Several politically conservative
groups have objected to US participation in the Law of the Sea convention
because they believe it raises sovereignty questions. Other organizations
support ratification, including the
American Petroleum Institute, National
Ocean Industries Association, and the
International Association of Drilling
Contractors.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee favorably referred ratification out

Ardmore basin Woodford gas plan takes off
Operators are pursing gas and liquid
hydrocarbons in Mississippian-Devonian Woodford shale in the northwestern
Ardmore basin in southern Oklahoma.
Bankers Petroleum Ltd., which calls
the field Tishomingo, is implementing
a development plan that entails drilling
30 gross wells in 2008 at a capital cost
of $45 million.
The wells produce gas, oil, and
natural gas liquids from the Woodford,
which averages twice the formation’s
thickness in the Arkoma basin (see
table).
Bankers had five wells on production in Tishomingo in mid-May at a
combined 3.1 MMcfd of gas equivalent,
64% gas, and was recovering frac fluid
from a second commercial discovery in
the area.
Bankers is running five rigs drilling
wells with horizontal legs on 640-acre
spacing. Most of the drilling so far is in
the southwestern Johnston and eastern
Carter counties, just north of the Marshall County line.
Other operators in the area include

Demand for oil and natural gas is
driving operators to search for new resources at greater depths. It’s no longer
unusual to spend as much as $100-150
million to drill a well in 5,000-10,000
ft of water to reach reservoirs at
25,000-30,000 ft TVD.
As these deepwater wells age and
components wear, there will be an
increasing need for deepwater intervention services and an increasing demand
for cost-effective, rigless alternatives.
Chevron, BP, and three technology
providers discussed deepwater interventions at a deepwater and emerging
technologies group meeting in Houston
in late April, sponsored by the American

Replacing a downhole pump can
require 35-40 days, plus 2-17 days’
lead time. Replacing a modular seafloor
pump can take 6-14 days, with 2-6
days’ lead time. Replacing a riser pump
can take 2-5 days.
Given the time requirements and

than downhole systems. If the anticipated intervention costs less, installing
artificial lift on more wells will make
sense, fiscally.
Ring suggested several low-cost approaches:
• Use a deep-set master valve, which
allows deeper pump placement without
the need to set a riser and kill the well.
• Use coiled-tubing reentry through
a subsea intervention lubricator system
(SILS).
• Install a pressure canister at the
wellhead.

Key to the study was a scope that included trade of the polymers themselves
and also of polymers “in situ,” that is,
contained in the end product (See box,
“Our methodology in brief”).
One of the study’s objectives was to
provide a balanced perspective on market sector trends within each region and

performance and losing competitive

Our methodology in brief
Accenture Research developed a method for forecasting demand for chemicals by linking industry-expert-derived forecast
demand in downstream end-use markets, supplied by Global Insight (USA) Inc. To do this, we identiﬁed polymer consumption in each major end-use market and region.
This approach of examining demand for polymers produces a more reliable demand outlook because it takes into consideration not only chemicals but also end-market expertise.
For this study, we examined the demand for certain polymer segments1 within many end-use markets2 covering the consumption of all major plastics, ﬁbers, and paints (which we call “polymers” in this study), across a comprehensive group of
manufacturing countries and regions that encompass the entire world market.3
We examined ﬁnished goods and polymer trade ﬂows and balanced the demand outlook with our own supply forecast,
which is based on our understanding of polymer production economics, feedstock trends, and other geopolitical factors.
Based on this work, we observed that:
• World investment is growing fastest in regions with higher risk.
• All regions are growing in polymer consumption, although their focuses are different.
• Seeds of future polymer demand growth can be found in subregions or “hot spots” with a particular advantage.
• Raw material centers are evolving as new resources are found and political tides change.
• The future chemical industry will include more government ownership and, therefore, the competitive landscape will
develop differently.
• Within each region there are “safe haven” markets that are least susceptible to international trade swings.
• Companies are ﬁnding alternative sources of talent in order to lower costs and achieve higher levels of innovation, such
as through the establishment of research and development centers in emerging markets and outsourcing various functions.
• Future investment strategies will require an extremely reﬁned understanding of each region’s product mix, political environment, and potentially wide variances in business costs.

in polymers.
The Middle East and China will remain the axis of trade. The Middle East
will be the largest exporter having an
expected net export of petrochemicals
of 25 million tonnes by 2016 (mostly
geared toward serving China); correspondingly, China will be the biggest
importer of polymers with an expected
net import of 16 million tonnes by
2016.
Growth in other regions of the
world may more likely be overlooked.
The polymer industry will continue to
grow in the US and Western Europe,

The multipolar world
Globalization, the formative idea of our age, continues to affect the economic
geography in ways we are only beginning to understand. The rise of this new
world—what Accenture calls the multipolar world—is constantly reshaping our
perspective.
Increased economic interdependence across ﬁve key dimensions characterizes
this multipolar world:
• Capital. The rapid growth of emerging economies as sources of outward
foreign direct investment and destinations for portfolio investment.
• Talent. Favorable demographics spurring rapid growth of emerging-market
workforces.
• Resources. Increasingly intense competition for energy, commodities, and
raw materials.
• New consumers. Rapid income growth creating up to a billion new consumers in emerging markets.
• Innovation. The growth of new clusters of innovation and specialization in
emerging economies.
The multipolar world is opening new opportunities not only to traditional
companies, but also to local and resourceful operations that understand more
closely the potential in their “own backyards.”
The multipolar world is not a world of absolutes, where traditional ﬁrst-world
economies begin to give way before the rise of countries such as India and China.
Rather, in the multipolar world, not only will the traditional and new powerhouses have signiﬁcant roles, but other players will also: Mexico, Russia, South Korea,
Brazil, and Eastern Europe, among others.

44

In China, as domestic capacity grows,
the country will continue to experience
a shortage of polymers. Its export of
polymers in situ will rise dramatically
during 2006-16 (Fig. 5).
Fig. 5 shows that textiles, commodity electrical and electronics, and basic
machinery are strong in China. In 2007,
China contributed just more than 15%
of the world’s manufacturing, but only
slightly more than 5% of the world’s
gross domestic product, indicating its
lack of value-added sectors, such as
services.
Economic growth is skewed toward
manufacturing investment for finished
goods, which is causing increased
inflation. This may result in competing,
low-labor-cost nations such as India,
Vietnam, Indonesia, and Latin America
winning more investment.
One subregion or investment “hot
spot” is along Thailand’s Myanmar border, where textile investment is growing
rapidly due to its abundant low-cost
labor pool. Textile investment is a good
indicator of future manufacturing
investment by other labor intensive,
polymer-consuming industries.
On the other end of the axis of trade,
the Middle East and Africa will continue
to be the largest exporter of polymers
(primarily by the Middle East), and
there will be a dramatic rise in their
exports through 2016. Because most
finished goods are imported to these
regions, there will be a less dramatic
but still notable trade deficit of in situ
polymers during the next decade (Fig.
6).
Like China, the Middle East and Africa are far from a clear-cut investment
case. Supply development challenges
vary by country, as does the role of
government in industry.
Some countries are under economic
sanctions, such as Iran for example, and
others may have foreign investment restrictions and other factors at play. Also,
in most emerging markets, there are
investment hindrances surrounding the
areas of intellectual property protection,
barriers to market entry and acquisitions, labor regulations, environmental

Keys to adding value
How do these trends translate into
smart investment strategy? For making
the most out of investing in a multipolar world, we recommend:
• Adding more value for current
customers. The first key to adding value
is to sell more to the same customer
groups—materials, services, or systems.
The paint industry, for example, no
longer sells just paint to auto manufacturers; over time industry companies
have taken over the role of the paint
shop—providing expertise in applying
the paint and recovering spent solvents
or waste materials afterward.
• Using mergers and acquisitions

and safety issues, and other concerns.
The obstacle in all cases will be to
balance revenue growth with operating margins (which lead to total return
to shareholders). This is an important
point. We frequently see companies
investing in China for revenue growth.
Their operating margins get diluted,
however, because more of their assets
will be competing in the low price,
cost-competitive markets of those
regions.
In contrast, the developed regions
offer slow revenue growth, but higher
operating margins. There is growth in
these areas, and the demand for polymers will no longer be confined to the
most basic forms.
Competitive manufacturers will
continue to demand innovative products, and companies with a smart global
investment strategy understand that,
while producers must be able to serve
in China, product innovation begins
in the developed nations and migrates
elsewhere. To meet downstream needs,
therefore, producers also need to remain on the leading edge of innovation.
Some of this innovation can come
from the abundant pools of scientists
and engineers in India and China. Many
companies have placed research and development assets in those areas to serve
traditional and burgeoning markets.

(M&A) to enhance market position.
Accenture research into high performance has shown that companies that
are leaders in M&A increased margins
relative to their peers. These companies
have M&A instituted as a process, with
people dedicated to the acquisition and
timely integration to get new areas of
business up and running quickly.
Also key is that top-tier businesses
do not acquire simply to add volume.
Rather, they acquire to add value—to
enhance their services and products for
their customers. Selective M&A can also
be used to enhance positioning; a domestic paint manufacturer, for example,
may acquire a company with a more
global presence to serve in other areas.

safely and securely, with
minimal risk to the environment. This ability is enhanced by an
associated integrity monitoring system
that provides rapid and sensitive leakdetection capabilities. ITP InTerPipe’s
PIPIP technology received DNV’s Certificate of Fitness for Service in 2007.
Leaks are primarily detected by monitoring pressure in the annulus. Because
the inner annulus is closed, arbitrarily
small leaks can be detected via pressure
measurement; the only variable being
how much time is required. The leakdetection capability in the PIPIP system
is orders of magnitude better than can
be achieved with conventional leak detection. For example, a leak of 0.002 cu
m LNG/hr (0.00004% of the flow rate)
can be detected in about 18 hr.
The case study presented shows the
ability to detect leaks when about 40
l. of LNG had leaked into the annulus.
Since the inner annulus pressure is
less than the triple point of methane
(117 millibara), pure methane cannot
exist as a liquid in the annulus. Leaks
will consist primarily of a mix of vapor and solid methane, with the solid

contact with the inner pipe.
Leak location can be detected by
fiber optic methods for all leaks large
enough to affect the temperature of
the intermediate pipe. Annulus pressure monitoring will detect a small
leak more quickly than the fiber optic
temperature monitoring. The fiber optic
method will detect large leaks more
quickly. A leak in the intermediate pipe
can be distinguished from a leak in
the inner or outer pipes by either the
fiber optic measurement or the rates at
which the pressures of the inner and
outer annuli change.

Background
LNG projects involve large capital
investments and all product must pass
through a pipeline to and from the
ships. This requires reliable pipelines,
particularly if they are to be subsea and,
ideally, accurate, reliable pipeline-integrity monitoring systems. This article
discusses the inherent safety of an LNG
PIPIP design as well as leak-detection
thresholds and times.

Pipe design
ITP undertook a formal technology
review process for its LNG pipe technology, culminating in a DNV Certificate of Fitness for Service (OGJ, May 21,
2007, p. 62). Fig. 1 shows the multiwalled LNG pipe.
Its key features include:
• A 36% NiFe inner pipe with a
coefficient of thermal expansion ten
times lower than that of stainless steel.
The low CTE minimizes expansion and
contraction of the pipeline, mitigating
the need for expansion loops or bellows. LNG carriers have used 36% NiFe
for membranes for more than 40 years.
• Patented microporous insulation,
used in subsea pipelines since 1998.
The insulation consists primarily of
silica and titanium dioxide. Installed in
an LNG pipeline, it provides an overall
U-value of 0.131 w/sq m-°C. using
only 40 mm of insulation. The insulation also has high mechanical compressive strength and can support the
weight of the filled LNG pipe, eliminatOil & Gas Journal / May 26, 2008

ing the need for centralizers. The insulation can tolerate temperatures up to
900º C., allowing the intermediate and
outer pipes to be welded directly over
the insulation without damaging it.
Field joints can thus be insulated with
the same procedures as running pipe.
• An inner annulus, typically continuous along the entire pipeline length.
The inner annulus operates at reduced
pressure. The reduced pressure increases
the thermal performance of the insulation, eliminates inner annulus conditions which could allow methane to
exist as a liquid (only solid and vapor
can exist), and acts as a straightforward,
robust, and sensitive leak-detection
system.
• An intermediate pipe designed to
handle collapse, providing additional
protection from external damage and
the environment. Depending on specific
application, the intermediate pipe’s
design can provide double pressure
containment to prevent release of the
LNG into the environment.
• An outer annulus with the pressure
continuously monitored.
• A carbon steel outer pipe designed
for collapse and prevention of buckle
propagation, and featuring anticorrosion coating and cathodic protection for
a subsea pipeline.
The triple-wall pipe design provides
two barriers of protection from accidental external damage in a subsea
application. Onshore applications would
typically use a double-walled design.
Bulkheads connect the inner and intermediate pipes and the intermediate
and outer pipes. These bulkheads form
sealed inner and outer annuli. Field
joints consist of straightforward butt
welds for all pipes (inner, intermediate,
and outer).
A pipeline integrity-monitoring
system based on continuous pressure
monitoring of both annuli detects leaks
and differentiates between leaks in any
of the three pipe walls, providing leak
detection orders of magnitude more
sensitive than conventional pipeline integrity monitoring systems. Including a
fiber optic system in the outer annulus

can provide secondary leak detection

pipeline at 1-m intervals.
A pipeline integrity-monitoring system similar to the one described here
recently quickly verified the integrity of
Camisea LPG PIP pipelines in Peru after
a magnitude 8 earthquake centered near
the pipeline installation

Methane
The inner annulus of the PIPIP system is maintained at a reduced pressure
(i.e., below atmospheric). Fig. 2 shows
a phase diagram for pure methane.
Maintaining pressures below the triplepoint pressure of 117 millibara prevents
formation of liquid methane. Instead,
when the LNG flashes across the leak
to the reduced-pressure environment
in the inner annulus, the final phase
will be either vapor, or a mix of vapor
and solid methane. Thus, as long as the
inner annulus pressure remains below
117 millibara, no liquid methane can
exist.
The LNG’s composition, however,
affects this process. Since the triplepoint pressures of ethane, propane, and
butane occur at much lower pressures, a
small portion of any leak may be liquid
depending on the actual composition of
the LNG.

-120

-100

-80

Preventing liquid methane from
entering the inner annulus limits the
likelihood that it could accumulate at
the bottom of the intermediate pipe.
Such accumulation would result in
highly localized cooling and, for PIP or
PIPIP designs using a carbon-steel intermediate or outer pipe, a drop below the
design temperature of the carbon steel
pipe.
Since only gas and solid are present,
however, the solid will remain local
to the leak (it will eventually sublime
into a gas phase) and the gas phase will
diffuse into the annulus. If only gas is
present, it will also cool the intermediate pipe, but being much more diffuse
will do so in a less localized manner.

Integrity monitoring
The PIPIP design provides a rapid,
sensitive, and accurate leak-detection
system. Both annuli are continuous and
the pressures in the annuli are continuously monitored. Since the annuli are
closed and the pressures in the two
annuli are different (<117 millibara in
the inner annulus and about 3 bar in
the outer annulus), any leak results in a
pressure change in one or both annuli,
allowing the leak’s detection. A fiber optic in the outer annulus can also detect
the location of any leak in the inner
pipe that poses a risk to the intermediate pipe.

The gauges specified for annuluspressure monitoring on the ITP LPG
pipeline in Peru provide the basis for
pressure measurement accuracy. The
pressure measurement gauges are accurate to ±6 millibar, up to 1,200 millibara. This gauge is sufficient, but more
accurate gauges are also available.

Detection time
The elevated vapor mass created by
a leak in the inner pipe causes pressure in the inner annulus to increase.
The ±6-millibar accuracy of the gauges
makes a 15-millibar increase in the
pressure sufficient to detect a leak.

Two methods have calculated the
time required to detect a 15-millibar
increase in pressure as a function of leak
size. The first is a simplified method, ignoring any pressure drop resulting from
flow in the annulus and simply calculating the amount of methane necessary to
increase the pressure by 15 millibar.
This proves quite easy (and independent of the
starting pressure),

rate yields detection time, independent of leak location.
The second method accounts for
pressure drop in the annulus; that the
pressure at the leak will be higher than
at the ends of the pipeline, where it is
measured. The leak is always assumed
to occur at the point farthest from the
pressure measuremens, as this requires
the longest time to detect.
Gas leaks in the annulus stemming
from a leak result in laminar flow.
Analysis of the problem as pseudosteady
state is also assumed. The radial velocity profile adjusts quickly to changes
in pressure and flow. A momentum
balance for the flow in the annulus then
provides a relationship between the
volumetric flow rate (Q) and the pressure gradient (Equations 1-3).
These equations represent the standard solution for laminar flow in an
annulus, with correction Fc applied for
eccentricity of the inner pipe. Integrating the standard solution around the
circumference of the annulus, treating κ as a function of angular position
determined by the geometry of the
eccentricity, determines Fc.
Since the mass flow rate consists
simply of the product of the volumetric
flow rate and density, and the density
is related to the pressure via the ideal
gas law, the momentum balance can be
written as shown in Equations 4-6.
A mass balance on a section of the
50

annulus (including the void space in
the insulation) yields Equation 7.
Combining the momentum and
mass balances provides the final equations to be solved (Equations 8-9).
A semi-implicit technique in Mathcad solves the partial differential equation numerically. A variable-size mesh in
the axial direction uses fine discretization close to the
leak and coarser

rate (the leak
rate) and the
outlet boundary condition is no flow
(the outlet is closed).
Fig. 3 shows the times required to
detect a leak as a function of leak size.
For leak sizes of interest, <0.04 cu
m LNG/hr, the simplified calculation
method provides a good estimate of
detection time since the pressure drop
becomes progressively less important
for small leaks.
Fig. 4 shows the average annulus
pressure and the outlet pressure (where
the measurement is made) as a function
of time. Fig. 5 shows the pressure profile at the time a leak would be detected
from outlet pressure monitoring.
The closed, low-pressure annulus
makes the leak-detection capability
in the PIPIP system orders of magnitude better than can be achieved with
convectional leak-detection systems. For
example, a leak of 0.002 cu m LNG/hr,
or 0.4 ppm relative to the flow rate, can
be detected in 18 hr.

area, a leak of the inner pipe is indicated; a leak from the outer to the inner
annulus has a negligible effect on the
temperature of the outer annulus and
the intermediate pipe wall where the
fiber optic is located.
A leak in the intermediate pipe, however, will cause the pressure in the outer
annulus to drop, which will be detectable. Since the fluids in both annuli are
ideal gases at about the same temperature, the pressure change in the outer
annulus is related to the pressure change
in the inner annulus simply by the ratio
of the volumes of the two annuli.
If the leak is in the intermediate
pipe, the inner annulus pressure will
increase at about 60% of the rate that
the outer annulus pressure decreases
(Equation 10). A gas detector connected
to the inner annulus provides a further
possibility for distinguishing between
inner and intermediate pipe leaks.
Detection of methane would indicate
an inner pipe leak. This method would
generally require use of vacuum pumps
to pull gas in the inner annulus through
the detector.

indicates a leak. Since fiber optic measurement resolution is 1 m, the temperature 0.5 m from the leak provides
the measure of when a leak is detected
by the fiber optic.
A method was developed to predict
the temperature of the intermediate
pipe as a function of time and distance
from the leak. This model was used
to predict temperature profiles along

Version 2.05 modules provide these
enhancements:
• Modbus dictionary. In flow applications,
RTUs and SCADA networks often use the
open modbus protocol because of its common support and its multipoint (polled)
architecture. The inRAx flow computers
provide a modbus master port to allow users to poll data from a remote chromatograph device. The modules have an internal
modbus map, so for the convenience of
the user the version 2.05 upgrade was
equipped with a modbus dictionary,

complicating wiring designs. Alternatively,
the inRAx integrated flow computer supports eight to 16 meter runs; and, now
version 2.05 modules support multiple
streams (as many as four per meter) and
allow the PLC/PAC to switch the active
stream via the module over the back plane
of the controller.
• Data archival/event logging. Version 2.05
modules have an expanded data archival
and event logging feature, which allows
35 regular daily and 48 regular hourly
archives, and 1,440 daily and hourly extended archives per meter.

Why suspension
of SPR ﬁll can
lower oil prices
“Extrapolation of this fall’s evidence
could take prices as high as an unbelievable $120 if adult supervision is not brought
to bear on DOE.”
Consultant Philip K. Verleger Jr. issued
that prophecy to two Senate subcommittees last Dec. 11. Since then, $120/bbl crude
oil has become painfully believable.
Adult supervision has arrived. Under
bipartisan pressure from Congress, the De-

partment of Energy on May 16 announced
it is suspending by as much as 13 million
bbl this year’s acquisition of crude for the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Until now, the Bush administration had
argued that 70,000 b/d or so of crude acquisition for the SPR couldn’t inﬂuence price in
an 86 million b/d oil market.
That would be right if all crude were
alike. It’s not. And the market’s longstanding preference for light, sweet crude has
intensiﬁed recently because of growing requirements for light products with sharply
reduced sulfur levels.
In his Senate testimony, Verleger noted
that a leap in crude prices last year away
from 2006 levels coincided with DOE’s
revival of acquisition of crude for the SPR.
About 33% of crude acquired for SPR is
sweet.
Verleger estimated that SPR purchases
lowered global supply of light, sweet crude
by as much as 0.3% and raised the price by
perhaps 10%. At the time, the light, sweet
crude price was $94/bbl.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries makes a companion point in
its May Monthly Oil Market Report (OGJ
Online, May 15, 2008).
OPEC points out that growth in demand
for distillate was more than twice that
of gasoline during 2000-07 while construction of reﬁnery processing capacity
tilted strongly toward the slower-growing
product. So reﬁners must run light crude to
meet soaring demand for distillate, especially diesel, and the price spread between
light and heavy crude grades has widened.
Meanwhile, Iran is chartering tankers in
which to store heavy crude it can’t sell.
More so than usual, market tightness is
a phenomenon of the light, sweet end of
the crude-quality spectrum.
More so than seems probable, therefore, suspension of SPR ﬁll can be expected
to make a difference in price.

Earthquake may shake energy market
Days after the massive May 12 earthquake hit the Sichuan province of central
China, its potential impact on world energy markets remained uncertain, but damage to hydroelectric and nuclear power plants could prove critical, analysts said.
The earthquake was reported to have damaged as many as 17 dams in Sichuan
and neighboring provinces. French nuclear experts said it possibly could have damaged several nuclear fuel and research sites as well. Moreover, recovery efforts could
boost demand for petroleum fuels for construction and transportation.
“Oil demand growth from 2007 to 2008 in China was recently estimated by the
International Energy Agency to come in at 350,000 b/d on a base of 7.54 million b/d.
In our view, the earthquake may actually add to this forecast,” said Adam Sieminski,
chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington.
The Sichuan province is China’s main gas producer and consumer, accounting for
a quarter of the country’s gas production. PetroChina, the primary operator, said it
had restored a third of the daily output of 6 million cu m of gas that was shut in after
the quake. Sinopec’s giant Chuanxi gas ﬁeld in Sichuan was reported to be producing at 20% of capacity after many chemical plants were closed, up from only 10%
earlier when 1,000 gas wells were shut in. As of May 15, the ﬁeld was reported to be
producing 1.6 million cu m/d.
OPEC’s outlook
In its latest monthly market report, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries still sees world economic growth at 3.9% in 2008, unchanged from the
previous month amid signs that the credit crisis may be easing. Forecasts for Japan
were revised slightly up, while those for the “euro zone” were slightly down. OPEC’s
forecast for US economic growth was unchanged at 1.1%.
“In the narrow technical sense, the US is not yet in recession. Advance ﬁgures for
US gross domestic product in the ﬁrst quarter still indicate positive growth, albeit
at a meager 0.6% yearly rate, mainly on continued strength in exports and a rise in
inventories. US payrolls in April fell for the fourth month, but the loss of 20,000 jobs
was much smaller than the average of 80,000/month in the ﬁrst quarter of 2008,”
said OPEC analysts. “Overall, the better-than-expected data and signs that the Fed’s
easing cycle were at an end helped lift the dollar from its lows vs. the euro and yen.
Inﬂation continued to trouble China, India, and other emerging markets and could
dampen growth in the months ahead.”
Oil demand in April was “very weak” within the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, although winter product demand improved across
Europe. US oil consumption declined sharply, due to both the slowing economy
and warm winter weather, and is expected to experience the usual seasonal drop in
consumption in the second quarter. “This year’s summer driving season is not likely
to show its normal annual growth due to the anticipated weaker gasoline demand in
the US,” OPEC said. “North America is forecast to be ﬂat, while oil demand in other
OECD regions is expected to decline due to weakening transport fuel demand in the
second quarter.”
The group lowered its forecast for non-OPEC supply growth in 2008 to 700,000
b/d, with production reductions in Mexico, Norway, UK, Denmark, Australia, New
Zealand, Brazil, and Russia to be partially offset by increases in India, Syria, and
Chad. Growth in OPEC NGLs and nonconventional oils now stands at 340,000 b/d in
2007 and 540,000 b/d for 2008.
In April, OPEC crude production averaged 31.7 million b/d, a decline of 393,000
b/d from the previous month due to production disruptions in Nigeria and Iraq. Demand for OPEC crude in 2007 was estimated to average 32 million b/d, an increase
of 280,000 b/d over the previous year. In 2008, the demand for OPEC crude is expected to average 31.8 million b/d, or 120,000 b/d lower than in the previous year.
OPEC said it continues to produce 32 million b/d, and its excess capacity has
grown to more than 3 million b/d. “The start-up of new projects, such as the 500,000
b/d Khursaniyah ﬁeld in Saudi Arabia, should help to further ease market fundamentals,” the report said.
The cartel also said, “The surge in crude oil prices since the start of this year has
not been equal across all crude grades. While light, sweet West Texas Intermediate
has increased by more than $24/bbl, heavy grades have risen by much less, resulting
in a widening differential between light sweet and heavy sour crudes.”

RAMTM Multilateral Completions for Extended-Reach Wells
Getting liners to bottom in extended-reach multilateral wells can be a problem. The
RAM™ Rotating Self-Aligning Multilateral System is the solution. The RAM system
allows continuous rotation of lateral liners to bottom, even in wells with step-out ratios
greater than 5:1. And, it delivers reliable Level 3 and 5 multilateral junctions with
selective flow control and access to all laterals.

Already, the RAM system has helped increase total oil recovery from viscous reservoirs
on Alaska’s North Slope. To see how it can make extended-reach multilaterals and
their related benefits possible for you, contact us today.

Two Minute Warning!
Polyguard announces
RD6 - OS coating
for offshore girth welds.
warning to our competitORS:
• Your girth weld coating takes 4 + minutes to install.
• RD6 - OS takes about 2 minutes.
• Effective immediately, your system may be obsolete.

ANNOUNCEMENT TO USERS OF
OFFSHORE GIRTH WELD COATINGS:
YOUR COATING QUALITY JUST WENT UP — FOR TWO REASONS
1. In offshore pipeline construction, the rule of thumb for a ‘quick lay’ of pipe is four minutes. That’s about the
time of a welding cycle. When the welding cycle is finished, the superintendent wants to pull the next joint.
If girth weld coating installation isn’t complete, it slows the whole job down. There is a lot of pressure to hurry,
and that can affect coating quality.
2. RD6 has demonstrated, in twenty years of use on Big Oil pipelines, that it is a non-shielding coating.
CP current could reach the pipe surface if the coating were ever to disbond from the pipe surface.

YOUR PROJECT COST JUST WENT DOWN — FOR FIVE REASONS
The five reasons are — five less installation steps. RD6 - OS requires no torch. This means no preheating the
steel, no heating the underlap, no heating the overlap, no heating the closure, no heating circumferentially around
the pipe, no heating until recovery is complete. Far less application steps… far less possibility for human error.
The truth is, the RD6 - OS coating will be finished before a torched coating is past the first step of steel preheating.

Challenge us to prove our two minute claim.
Call Chic Hughes at (713) 829-3709 for a demonstration.

MMS approves Cascade-Chinook FPSO plans
The US Minerals Management Service has approved development plans for the Cascade-Chinook oil and natural gas project in
the Walker Ridge area of the Gulf of Mexico. Cascade-Chinook lies
165 miles off Louisiana in 8,200 ft of water.
The project, operated by Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), will involve the first use of a floating production, storage,
and offloading vessel in the gulf. “The Cascade-Chinook project
will be the first production from deep discoveries in the Lower
Tertiary trend of the Walker Ridge and Keathley Canyon areas of the
gulf,” said Lars Herbst, regional director for the MMS gulf region.
“This is an important step for Petrobras and all oil and gas operators exploring in deepwater Gulf of Mexico,” Herbst said, adding, “The FPSO and many associated first-use technologies lead the
way in providing the infrastructure necessary to produce safely in
the gulf’s ultradeep water.”
The next step in the development process is the MMS review
of Petrobras’s deepwater operations plan, which outlines the specific details and capabilities of the FPSO facility and associated new
technologies and must be approved before production can begin.

New MMS committee to revise Indian oil valuation
The US Minerals Management Service published a notice on
Apr. 28 that it is forming a committee to consider recommendations for revising the rule governing valuation of oil produced
from American Indian leases.
The negotiated rulemaking committee will include representatives from the federal government, Indian tribes, individual Indian
owners, and the oil and gas industry, the US Department of Interior
agency said. It particularly will make recommendations regarding
the oil major portion provision contained in most tribal and allotted leases. Those leases define major portion as the highest price
paid or offered at the time of production for the major portion of
oil produced from the same field, MMS said. It has begun to take
nominations for members.
The agency originally announced its intention to establish
a negotiated rulemaking committee in December 2007 when it
published technical corrections to the March 1988 oil valuation
rule, according to MMS Director Randall B. Luthi. “Those technical
corrections and the pending recommendations of the negotiated
rulemaking committee will bring added certainty to the valuation
of oil produced from American Indian lands and help ensure that

Exploration

American Indians receive the proper royalties,” he said.
MMS published a proposed rule for public comment in February 2006 after a series of public meetings with tribes and individual Indian mineral holders, the agency said. It decided to make
technical corrections to the current rule and convene the negotiated rulemaking committee after receiving diverse comments from
tribes and the oil and gas industry.
Once the committee reaches consensus on the rule’s major portion provision as well as other provisions the committee might
want to address, MMS said it will use that recommendation as the
basis for an amendment to the rule, which it also will publish in
the Federal Register.

Global warming risks underestimated, report says
The risks of global warming were underestimated in the Stern
report on climate change, its author said, and urgent action is
needed to address the problem.
“However, I’m optimistic about an international agreement,”
said Nicholas Stern at the IHS Energy Symposium in London. He
called for global leaders to agree by next year on an action plan to
reduce carbon emissions and stem world temperatures.
Stern is hopeful that participants at the next environmental
summit in Copenhagen will agree to such action. The 700-page
report he wrote examines the economic impact of climate change
and says 1.5% of the world’s gross domestic product needs to be
invested in stabilizing emissions at 500 ppm by 2050. “We need to
move quickly,” he said.
However, deforestation and agriculture are also major causes of
emissions, Stern warned, and he called for urgent policies to tackle
the problems. Carbon capture and storage for hydrocarbons would
be important in reducing carbon emissions as would other energy
sources such as nuclear and renewables, he said.
Stern recommends carbon trading and taxation, quotas, and
auctions of greenhouse gas emissions, which he says are all necessary to change behaviors.
“Poor countries want flows of finance and the transfer of technology to deal with this. We need a clean development mechanism
that is better than this one, which is too small and too micro.”
After publishing the report 18 months ago, Stern, a former
World Bank chief economist, was severely criticized for “scaremongering.” He has since met with the Chinese and Indian government to discuss how they can address climate change. ✦

updip well is being drilled.
The Anduin West prospect on Mississippi Canyon Block 754
found 30 ft of net gas-condensate pay. The well was drilled in
2,696 ft of water.
The Anduin West well is being completed, and a production test
is planned. ATP has a 10% working interest in Gladden and a 25%
working interest in Anduin West.
Production from the discoveries is expected to begin in late
2009.
ATP’s Innovator floating production platform will handle the oil
and gas from both discoveries. Innovator is moored in 3,000 ft of
water on Mississippi Canyon Block 711.
Innovator—a semisubmersible drilling rig previously named
Midland and owned by Rowan Cos. Inc.—was acquired by ATP
and converted into a floating production platform.
ATP has 100% ownership of Innovator, which handles production from Gomez oil and gas field.

Ecopetrol to evaluate Tempranillo ﬁnd in Huila
Columbia’s state-owned Ecopetrol will soon begin evaluating an
oil and gas discovery in Colombia’s southern province of Huila.
The find, the Tempranillo-1 well, was drilled in the Upper
Magdalena Valley basin and is part of Ecopetrol’s wholly owned
10,184-hectare Brisas-Lomalarga-Dina-Potrerillo block.
“During these tests, crude and gas flowed...without artificial assistance. The crude is light and flowed at rates that varied between
1,600-2,400 b/d,” Ecopetrol said, adding that gas output averaged
2-2.75 MMcfd.
“With the results obtained in the initial tests, Ecopetrol will
draft a plan to evaluate the discovery’s potential, including an extensive test period that will begin in the next few weeks,” the company said.
Tempranillo-1 is one of 20 wells that Ecopetrol plans to drill
this year. Currently, the company produces about 19,000 b/d in
Huila.

North Chilean gas ﬂows tease March Resources
March Resources Corp., Calgary, said it is encouraged by admittedly noncommercial gas flows at its first well in northern Chile’s
Tamarugal basin.
The company perforated 16 intervals in four zones to evaluate
gas shows and drilling breaks in the Cerro Empexa and Cretaceous Guatacondo formations at the Pica-1 well. Gas is thought to
be sourced from underlying Late Jurassic Majala formation black

Uganda’s Kingﬁsher appraisal well spuds
Heritage Oil Ltd., Calgary, has spud the Kingfisher-2 appraisal
and exploration well in Block 3A in southern Uganda’s Albert
graben.
Projected TD is 4,100 m. Heritage will deviate the well from
shore beneath Lake Albert to appraise reservoirs discovered at
Kingfisher-1 and evaluate the deeper primary target it did not
reach due to rig limits.
High case estimate for the deeper target is six times that of the
most likely 118 million bbl gross volume estimated for the four
secondary zones.
Kingfisher-1 tested a combined 13,900 b/d of 30-32° gravity
oil with some associated wax from four intervals in 2007.
The Kingfisher structure’s areal extent is put at 45 sq km based
on a 325-sq-km 3D seismic survey shot in mid-2007.
Heritage’s 2008 program calls for two wells at Kingfisher in
Block 3A and two to three wells on Block 1 targeting relatively
shallow seismic amplitude anomalies.
Heritage and Tullow Oil PLC hold both blocks 50-50. ✦

shales. Due to limited equipment, all zones are commingled.
The well’s main targets were at 2,800 m to TD 3,110 m, but
two perforated intervals between 2,000 m and TD yielded no
pressure increase or gas to surface.
Nine intervals were perforated at 1,500-1,800 m. Gas surfaced from each of the first four intervals perforated, but wellhead pressure was too small to measure. Gas continued to surface
from the next three intervals perforated, and a small increase in
surface pressure was measured, increasing as each interval was
perforated and ending at 210 KPa. Shut-in pressure was 760 KPa
12 hr later.
Two intervals were perforated from the top of the Guatacondo
formation at 1,350 m to a depth of 1,475 m. Gas continued to
surface, but wellhead pressures started to decrease.
Three intervals were perforated at 1,040-1,150 m. Gas continued to surface, but pressure fell to 450 KPa by the end of perforating.
The last perforating tools contained fluid, but it is not known
which zones may be wet or whether the fluid is from drilling
or the reservoir. March plans to seek the source of the fluids and
will try to establish gas flow from the intervals where it observed
definitive pressure increases.

Petrobras orders three newbuild semis
Petroleo Brazileiro SA (Petrobras) signed three lease contracts
with Seadrill Ltd. for three newbuild semisubmersible drilling rigs
and a separate contract with MPF Corp. Ltd., Bermuda, for a multipurpose floater. The contracts all involve deepwater projects off
Brazil, Seadrill said.
Seadrill said its lease contracts are valued at $4.1 billion total:
• One 6-year contract is for the $542 million West Eminence
deepwater semi under construction at Samsung shipyard in South
Korea (OGJ, Sept. 24, 2007, p. 41).

Processing

• Petrobras also signed a 6-year contract for the West Taurus,
a $457 million deepwater semi under construction at the Jurong
shipyard in Singapore.
Fourth-quarter delivery is scheduled for both West Eminence
and West Taurus. Both contracts call for start-up of operation off
Brazil in 2,400 m of water in early 2009.
• Petrobras, in addition, signed a 6-year contract for West Orion, a $532 million semi under construction at the Jurong shipyard in Singapore. West Orion is scheduled to be delivered during
second-quarter 2010. The start-up of operations off Brazil in 2,400
m of water is scheduled for third-quarter 2010.
In a separate deal, Petrobras signed a $630 million contract with
MPF for the 3-year lease of its new multipurpose floater MPF-01
under construction at Dragados Offshore SA’s Cadiz, Spain, shipyard. The MPF production-drillship is scheduled for delivery in late
2009.
Petrobras secured an option to extend this contract for another
2 years, making the total value of a 5-year deal $965 million.
In addition, Petrobras recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Noble Corp. to extend the leases of five deepwater
rigs currently drilling off Brazil—two semis and three drillships—
for a period of 29 rig years at a potential cost of $4 billion (OGJ
Online, Apr. 4, 2008). ✦

QP lets work contract for reﬁnery in Qatar

SK Energy builds diesel unit at Inchon reﬁnery

Qatar Petroleum has let an engineering contract to Axens to
design processing units for a new 250,000 b/d refinery in the
Messaieed Industial City in Qatar that is scheduled to start up by
first-quarter 2012.
The Al Shaheen refinery will use Axens’ process technologies
to establish a 51,000 b/d Hyvahl vacuum residue desulfurization
unit; a R2R 60,000 b/d residue fluidized catalytic cracker (RFCC);
and a 30,000 b/d Prime-G+ RFCC gasoline desulfurization unit.
The refinery units, combined with advanced technologies, will
make this “one of the most modern refinery complexes in the
world,” Axens said.
The Hyvahl unit will improve the feed quality to the R2R unit
and will coproduce an upgraded diesel cut, Axens reported. Hyvahl
has long cycle lengths on the 11% asphalt containing Al Shaheen
VR feed because of the permutable reactor system (PRS) system.
The PRS system increases hydroprocessing operations by removing
particulate matter and metals in the feed, eliminating pressure drop
build-up in the hydroprocessing section, it added.
The R2R RFCC is a “cold-wall construction adapted to maximize gasoline and propylene production,” Axens added, and its
Prime-G+ FCC naphtha desulfurization technology will enable the
production of ultralow-sulfur gasoline, the company said.
Last year, QP let a lump sum front-end engineering design contract to Technip for the facility. An oil pipeline will extend from Al
Shaheen oil and gas field 90 km offshore to Messaieed, 110 km
onshore, as well as to other import-export facilities (OGJ Online,
Aug. 31, 2007).

South Korea’s SK Energy Co. plans to build a 40,000 b/d dieselproducing hydrocracking unit at its refinery in the port city of
Inchon, 40 km west of Seoul. The unit will process heavy oil into
transportation fuel.
The project aims to increase exports of lighter, higher-value
products to China and Southeast Asia. The new unit will produce
naphtha, diesel, and kerosine using low-priced bunker-C fuel as
feedstock.
SK Energy said construction on the unit, expected to cost 1.5
trillion won, is scheduled to start in June, with commercial production to go online in June 2011.
The facility will eventually increase SK Energy’s overall heavy
oil-processing capacity to 202,000 b/d from the current 162,000
b/d. It also will expand the ratio of SK Energy’s heavy-oil processing facilities to overall refining ones to 17.6% from the current
14.5%.
In March, SK Energy completed construction of a residual fluid catalytic cracker at its 840,000 b/d refinery in Ulsan, 414 km
southeast of Seoul.
The 60,000 b/d capacity unit is set to launch operations in
June, when SK Energy will be operating three RFCCs with a combined capacity of 162,000 b/d.

Nippon Oil to add to Negishi reﬁnery

ing out 100,000 kl/year of ETBE. Demand for ETBE in Japan is
expected to reach 840,000 kl in 2010, based on projections for
sales of biofuel.
Japan currently imports all ETBE used for biofuel, and domestic
production will help reduce transport costs and carbon dioxide
emissions. Nippon Oil aims to purchase bioethanol from domestic
sources in Hokkaido.
Meanwhile, Nippon Oil, aiming to offset the fall in demand
for oil products in the domestic market, will nearly double its oil
product exports to 2.7 million kl in the fiscal year started in April.
The refiner will increase its export capacity to 260,000 b/d
from 230,000 b/d by the fiscal year ending March 2011, said Nippon Oil Pres. Shinji Nishio.
Shinji said most of the planned exports, mainly kerosine, jet

fuel, and gas oil, will be sold to oil traders in the Asia Pacific market.

Lummus taps GTC for BTX extraction unit
Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), Taiwan, will use GTC Technology’s GT-BTX extractive distillation technology as part of its No.
6 naphtha cracker and No. 7 BTX project in Lin Yuan, Kaohsiung,
Taiwan.
Lummus Technology (formerly ABB Lummus Global) was
awarded the overall contract for the project, which will produce
600,000 tonnes/year of ethylene (OGJ, Aug. 13, 2007, p. 10).
GTC’s technology extracts high-purity benzene, toluene, and
mixed xylenes (BTX) from hydrotreated pyrolysis gas.
This is the 20th license of the GT-BTX technology. ✦

Iran, Pakistan resume IPI gas line talks
Iran and Pakistan have restarted talks on the design and construction of the 2,700-km Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) natural gas
pipeline. India, which earlier had reservations about the project, is
showing interest as well in becoming a project stakeholder.
The proposed line, which initially would transport 600 million
cu m/day of gas, is scheduled for completion in 2011.
Following a recent visit of Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas
Minister Murli Deora, a delegation from Iran, led by President
Mahmoud Ahamdinejad, visited Pakistan to discuss the project.
Ahamdinejad met on Apr. 28 with Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and exchanged views on bilateral matters, including the IPI
pipeline project.
India welcomed the Iranian president’s visit and expressed hope
that it would advance the project.
According to Deora, the $7.4 billion IPI pipeline deal would be
“clinched soon.” He said India and Pakistan were near reaching a general agreement on the transit fee. Deora added that Ahmedinejad’s visit
would be utilized to pave the way for trilateral talks on the deal.

Indonesia’s Seroro LNG start-up delayed again
Indonesia’s planned fourth LNG plant, to be built in Senoro,
Central Sulawesi, will begin operations later than expected due to a
disagreement over the pricing of gas for the facility.
“We have extended the target for initial production as negotiations on the gas prices have yet to reach an agreement,” said
Lukman Mahfoedz, president director of Medco E&P. The project
partners are Mitsubishi Corp. 51%, state-owned PT Pertamina 29%,
and Medco 20%.
Lukman said the Senoro facility is to start production in first
quarter 2012, marking the second delay in the project, which was
initially expected to go online in 2010 but was delayed until 2011
amid similar price uncertainties. Upstream regulators are still calculating the budget needed to develop the gas fields that will supply the plant.
Project partners will buy gas from two fields in Senoro. The first,
on Toili block, is jointly owned by Pertamina and Medco, while the
second, on Donggi block, is wholly owned by Pertamina.

A third plant in Papua, designed to have capacity of 7.6 million
tpy, is due to begin operations under BP PLC by yearend.

Brazilian ﬁrm plans $1 billion ethanol line
Brazil Renewable Energy Co. (Brenco) plans to invest $1 billion to
build a 1,100-km, 4 million l./year ethanol pipeline extending from
Alto Taquari in Mato Grosso state to Santos—the country’s largest
port—in Sao Paulo state on the country’s south Atlantic seaboard.
Brenco has applied to Brazil’s environmental protection agency
Ibama and the national petroleum agency ANP for the necessary
licenses to construct the pipeline. Brenco said its line would not
compete with other ethanol pipelines planned by state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras).
In addition to the Port of Santos, the pipeline will serve five
other proposed terminals at Alto Taquari in Mato Grosso; Costa Rica
in Mato Grosso do Sul; Paranaiba in Goias state; and Sao Jose do Rio
Preto and Paulinia, both in the state of Sao Paulo.
The announcement was made as construction began on Brenco’s 450-million-real sugar and ethanol mill in Alto Taquari. The
facility will process 3 million tonnes of sugar cane and produce
275 million l. of ethanol by 2009.
The Alto Taquari mill will be the first of 10 units Brenco plans to
build in Brazil by 2009 having a combined capacity of 3.7 billion
l./year of ethanol. All of the output will be carried by the proposed
ethanol pipeline, which may also ship ethanol produced by other
operators in the region.
In 2007, Brazil exported just over 3 billion l. of ethanol, according to the Brazilian Development Ministry Foreign Trade Department. The Port of Santos handled some 60% of the exports,
followed by the Port of Paranagua with around 23%.
The country’s ethanol exports are expected to reach 3.91 billion
l. in 2008-09, up 27% from the 3.1 billion l. exported in 2006-07,
according to the Union of Sugarcane Industries.
Brazil’s total ethanol production in 2007 was reported to be
20-22 billion l. Production is expected to exceed 100 billion l./
year by 2025, according to ICIS Chemical Business. ✦

Declining production
I reckon Thomas Wyman’s letter, “A
disquieting look,” has factual merit, but
let’s not take the wrong trail (OGJ, Apr.
14, 2008, p. 12). Oil production has
always declined since Drake drilled the
first well. What doesn’t get replaced by
newly discovered, but surely more costly,
reserves will be replaced by rerouting
use.
Nuclear can displace a significant
amount of oil and gas used for generating electricity. Coal is moving into the
picture, too, but it needs the people’s
help. Coal was made clean and safe 25
years ago.
The Oil & Gas Journal’s editorial, “Energy and the poor,” had it dead center
(OGJ, Mar. 17, 2008, p. 23). “The tactics
governments use to implement fuel
preferences raise costs more generally
than [costs of specific regulations] and
often more insidiously”—not to mention the reserves they keep out of the
pipeline. That keeps supplies short, and
the prices rise.

Energy trade and security
Given the concern they profess for energy security, Democrats in the US Congress—including
the two seeking their party’s presidential nomination—should act thoughtfully rather than scornfully on international trade. Energy security and
free trade are connected in ways that shouldn’t be
ignored.
Hoping to be president, Sens. Hillary Clinton
of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois have
entered a contest of revulsion toward the North
American Free Trade Agreement. Obama asserts
that NAFTA is bad for the US but says he would fix
rather than repeal it. Clinton also promises to fix
the agreement but must deal with her own past
enthusiasm for the pact, an achievement of her
husband’s presidency. There have been reports that
one side or the other is really just posturing for
support from labor unions so no one interested in
trade needs to worry—reports promptly denied,
of course.

No comfort
Apparently, a trading partner to the north takes
no comfort from those assurances. In an annual
meeting of the leaders of Canada, Mexico, and the
US last month, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper responded to the Democrats’ chatter about
renegotiating NAFTA by flexing his country’s oil
muscle. Noting that Canada is the premier supplier
of energy to the US, Harper said that if NAFTA
renegotiation became necessary, “We would be in
an even stronger position now than we were 20
years ago, and we will be in a stronger position in
the future.”
Harper and Mexican President Felipe Calderon
both called for damage control on another trade
initiative Democrats want to wreck: the Colombia
Free Trade Agreement (CFTA). Democratic House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California on Apr. 10
changed procedural rules to block a vote on CFTA,
to which the US agreed in 2006 after negotiations
conducted under a now-expired law designed to
expedite approval of trade deals.
Pelosi has long opposed CFTA, claiming it hurts
US workers and doesn’t hold Colombia accountable for human rights violations and labor-related
violence. Her objections are hollow. If anything,

CFTA favored the US in its already-fluid trade
with Colombia. And the Latin American country
not only has made progress in human issues and
the rule of law but also wants to solidify relations
with the US in response to the growing menace
of nearby Venezuela. Pelosi’s maneuver rebuked an
important ally and oil supplier and weakened US
leadership on trade.
Continuing her assault on US economic
interests, Pelosi on Apr. 22 sent a letter asking
President George W. Bush to support three bills he
has threatened to veto. One of them, the No Oil
Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, would let
the Department of Justice bring antitrust action
against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. Passage of the bill would be a clumsy
and heavy-handed way to deal with OPEC and a
sound reason for its members to shy away from
the enormous investments energy consumers need
them to make in future oil supply.
A more-constructive way to respond to OPEC
would be to compete. But competition requires
new oil and gas production in the US, which
depends on increased leasing of federal land.
Democrats show nothing but disdain for leasing
and thus for domestic oil and gas supply.

Crimping supply
Americans dislike their dependence on foreign
oil, especially OPEC oil. But they like energy security. The latter can’t be achieved in isolation from
the former; assertions to the contrary are fantasies
promulgated by political opportunists. The US
does and will continue to rely on imported oil and
needs to view oil in trade—oil from producers
with strong motivation to sell—as a vital element of energy security. It needs to treat oil as a
component of trade in general, which should be
promoted as essential to national economic and
security interests.
Congress should be encouraging US competitiveness and the development of all economically
sensible and quantitatively meaningful energy
sources. The hostility now on display toward trade,
resource development, and commercial energy
sources promises only crimped supply, rising cost,
and diminished American credibility. ✦

The industry began life on May

discovered commercial amounts of
oil in southwestern Iran, giving rise
to Anglo-Persian Oil Co., later called
Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. Its history,

Route to nationalization

COMMENT

Nationalization of the Iranian oil
industry followed years of unsuccessful
negotiations between the government
and Anglo-Iranian Oil.
Throughout the global economic
depression of the decade before World
War II, the government sought a greater
share of revenue from oil produced in
Iran, eventually settling for an increase
of only 2 British shillings/tonne of
exported oil. Its efforts to secure a fair
share of oil revenue during and after

From the Iranian viewpoint, AngloIranian Oil sought only to prolong the
colonization of Iranian oil rather than
to commercialize it, making nationalization inevitable. The

Royal Dutch Shell 14%; Standard Oil Co.
of California, Standard Oil Co. of New
Jersey, Texas Oil Co., Gulf Oil Co., and
Mobil Oil Co. 8% each; and French Oil
Co. 6%. Once again Iranian oil started
to flow.
The Iranian share of profits in the
consortium agreement was not impressive by modern standards, barely
matching Aramco’s 50-50 profit-sharing agreement in Saudi Arabia. However, Iran’s success in nationalization of its
oil industry became a model for other
oil-producing countries, particularly
the Arab producers in the Persian Gulf
region, which nationalized their oil
industries in the following years.

Era of development
From 1954 onward was an era of
construction and economic development in Iran. The successful application
of nationalization and the recapture of
oil wealth inspired Iranians and stimulated economic expansion for a quarter
of a century.
In 1957, the government of Iran
established a new standard for oil
agreements worldwide: the principle of
50-50 profit sharing plus 25% income
tax payable by international oil companies. Thus was the concept of 75-25
profit sharing created.
Agip and Pan American Oil Co. were
the first companies to participate with
NIOC on the basis of the 75-25 contracts. This kind of agreement, although
not popular with international oil
companies, caught on quickly in oilproducing nations.
In the following years, NIOC
captured parts of the East European
markets, to the dissatisfaction of major oil companies. Iran also quickly
recognized the value of the gas that
had been flared under the consortium
contract. Under an unprecedented
agreement with the former Soviet
Union, Iran began to export moderate
volumes of gas in exchange for its first
large steel mill.
In 1973, after long and difficult
negotiations, the government dissolved the consortium, 6 years before

the termination date of the original
agreement. With that act the Iranian oil
industry became nationalized not only
officially but in practice as well. NIOC
became the essence of the oil industry
in Iran and took on the responsibilities
and challenges that went with a modern
and well-established oil company.
The company had grown from a passive office in 1951 after nationalization
to an active, mature, and well-respected
international oil company in 1973. Its
managerial team by then was welltrained and experienced.
After 1973, Iranian oil production
easily surpassed 6 million b/d, and
NIOC kept an average of 52 drilling rigs
active in the Zagros fold belt (see map).
New pipelines were laid to refineries
and exporting terminals. Nine wellmaintained refineries were in operation,
and two more were near completion,
with total capacity reaching more than
1.58 million b/d. The largest and the
most modern terminal (Azarpod) in the
region was constructed in the Persian
Gulf to accommodate very large crude
carriers.
Also in the early 1970s, NIOC expanded internationally, investing heavily
in refinery construction in South Korea,
India, Senegal, and South Africa under
agreements to provide crude oil to the
new facilities. NIOC also signed a preliminary agreement to enter US markets
to refine crude and distribute products.
All of this was accomplished while
Iran played a leading role in decisionmaking by OPEC, which it helped
found in September 1960.

Revolution, destruction
The Islamic Revolution changed
everything. A healthy, economically
sound oil industry gradually ceased
to exist. Production of over 6 million
b/d dived to below 3 million b/d after
the revolution and never reattained its
prerevolution peak. Experienced and
well-trained oil workers from all levels
in every industry sector were arrested
or terminated; many fled the country to
escape execution.
Before these chaotic acts of retali-

ation showed any sign of abatement,
the 8-year war with Iraq began with
an Iraqi invasion in September 1980. A
result of this nonsensical conflict was
the destruction of the Abadan refinery,
the Kermanshah refinery near the Iraqi
border, many miles of pipelines and oil
field installations, particularly in southwestern Iran, and major production
platforms in the Persian Gulf.
Twenty years after the war ended,
the damage to the oil industry is still
evident. Hardly any of the affected
installations have been replaced or repaired by the Islamic regime.
Currently, oil production is barely
3.8 million b/d, declining at an average
rate of at least 200,000 b/d/year (OGJ,
Feb. 10, 2003, p. 20). Lack of regular
maintenance and rare replacement of
worn-out parts and equipment for the
past 29 years have caused much irreversible damage to the Iranian oil industry. Uncontrolled production during
the war with Iraq and in the aftermath,
lack of investment and introduction
of new and modern technologies to
the Iranian oil industry, and—most
of all—ever-increasing sanctions by
the western powers and by the United
Nations Security Council coupled with
poor management with roots in bribery
and corruption, have driven the Iranian
oil industry to the brink of bankruptcy
(OGJ, Jan. 28, 2008, p. 20).
The throughput capacity of the refineries in Iran has been so limited that
the Islamic Republic has been forced
to import petroleum products, including gasoline, from foreign producers in
order to meet public needs. To make the
situation worse, presently there is only
one gas station in Iran for every 37,000
automobiles, far below the ratios of
other oil-exporting countries.

NIOC changes
NIOC before the revolution was a
very effective organization with a wellfunctioning management. It operated
efficiently not only in refining but also
in production, petrochemicals, natural
gas, domestic performance, and international marketing.

It accomplished all this with merely
32,000 employees. Presently, with the
creation of the Ministry of Petroleum in
addition to NIOC, a near-bankrupt oil
industry is struggling to survive with
nearly 112,000 employees.
In the name of privatization, the
Islamic Republic divided NIOC into
pieces, each given to an individual affiliated or ideologically associated with
the regime. In most cases, each sector
registered under a new company outside of Iran.
Many formally named and unnamed
oil companies and petroleum-oriented
businesses have been established under
the regime for the sole purpose of
collecting bribes under the guise of
commissions in order to prepare and fix
contracts with the Ministry of Petroleum. Under these conditions one has
to be connected to the system to be
successful. The connection too often
requires illicit payments.
In a well-publicized example, Statoil
of Norway in 2006 acknowledged the
payment of bribes in 2002 and 2003
to an Iranian official to secure a development contract for part of offshore
South Pars gas field. The company paid
fines and disgorgements in the US and
Norway totaling $21 million and submitted to a 3-year deferred-prosecution
agreement.
Last year, top executives of Total
came under formal investigation by
French authorities for suspected bribes
paid in 1997 in connection with
contracts for two South Pars development phases. Total in March 2007
acknowledged the investigation and
said the agreements under investigation
complied with “applicable law.” France
didn’t totally prohibit the payment of
bribes until 2000.
The oil ministry of the Islamic
Republic has a section under the name
of “office” for foreign negotiations and
contracts. NIOC, now part of the ministry, has a similar department that independently negotiates and signs contracts
with foreign oil companies. Therefore,
one organization has different offices
for the same purpose.
28

Often a contract is awarded to an
unqualified domestic “oil company”
to carry out a specific assignment. The
“oil company” then delegates the assignment to an inexperienced foreign
company of East Asian origins, awarding a much cheaper—possibly half the
original—amount while appropriating
the remainder for itself. This results
in a great setback for the Iranian oil
industry. All of these corrupt actions are
knowingly carried out to benefit only a
small group within the system.
Iran’s corruption is widely acknowledged. In the 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index published by Transparency
International, the country scored 2.5
on a scale in which 10 means “highly
clean” and 0 means “highly corrupt.”
Other countries receiving that score
were Burundi, Honduras, Libya, Nepal,
Philippines, and Yemen.
The Iranian regime’s deceptions extend to oil and gas reserves disclosures.
While most oil-producing countries
publish estimates of their proved
reserves periodically, state-controlled
firms in Iran, such as NIOC, do not let
outsiders verify their extremely inflated
estimates (OGJ, Nov. 1, 2004, p. 20).
Oil industry authorities in the Islamic
Republic, in order to secure loans from
international monetary organizations,
to attract private investors and major
companies, and inflate Iran’s production
quota in OPEC, have always provided
false reserves information. Further,
reserves estimates are used as political
tools, bolstering power and prestige for
the Islamic Republic.
There is a massive managerial vacuum in Iran due to a bureaucratic and
hierarchical decision-making structure
and the fact that many decision-makers
are not necessarily appointed for their
managerial competence. Because only
a few leaders in the Islamic Republic
control the wealth, the system is incompetent and open to abuse.

Shrinking income
Oil accounts for about 90% of Iran’s
hard-currency income. Increased oil
prices in the last several years have

encouraged many members of OPEC to
invest this extra cash flow in their own
petroleum infrastructures.
Iran and Venezuela are exceptions.
For the past 29 years, Iran has produced
an average of 3.395 million b/d of
oil and exported an average of 2.445
million b/d. The average export per
year has been 892.425 million bbl.
The Islamic Republic thus has sold
25,880,325,000 bbl of crude oil in
the past 29 years at an average price of
$30.96/bbl, earning more than $801.2
billion.
Where has this huge amount of
money gone? Certainly, none of it was
invested in Iranian oil infrastructure,
which badly needs renovation and repair, upstream and downstream.
The Islamic regime of Iran is one
of a few governments that the world
community has accused of promoting international terrorism, purchasing
and storing weapons of mass destruction, and abusing human rights. Critics,
including western democracies, believe
oil revenues are making these programs
possible.
No one can recall any part of the
world where a country so rich in manpower and natural resources (about
10% of total world oil and about 17%
of total world gas reserves, according
to official estimates) and with such a
huge well-educated middle class, has
experienced such a profound and rapid
deterioration of its living standards
as Iran has since the revolution of
1979. ✦

House SPR oil purchase hearing splits along party lines
Nick Snow
Washington Editor

frenzy that is driving up prices,” he
said in his opening statement.

Democrats and Republicans at an Apr.
24 US House committee hearing on
continuing oil purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when prices are
breaking records disagreed on which
government policies send the wrong
signals to markets.
Democrats on the Select Committee
on Energy Independence and Global
Warming said suspending purchases for
the SPR would effectively ease upward
price pressure by sending more oil
onto global markets instead of into
storage (OGJ Online, Apr. 25, 2008).
Republicans responded that authorizing
leasing with appropriate environmental
safeguards within the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge and on more of the
Outer Continental Shelf would be even
more effective.
Witnesses testifying before the committee offered recommendations ranging from generating more research and
development funding by exchanging
some light, sweet crude in the reserve
for heavier grades to adjusting scheduled deliveries of royalty in-kind crude
so that continuing to fill the SPR would
cost less money.
Democrats on the committee said
it made no sense to continue buying
crude for the reserve when prices are
so high. “When your house is on fire,
it’s insane to increase your insurance
instead of grabbing a hose and turning on the water,” said Rep. Jay Inslee
(D-Wash.).
Committee chairman Edward J.
Markey (D-Mass.) urged the administration of President George W. Bush
not only to suspend SPR purchases,
but to release crude from the reserve.
“If President Bush were to announce
his intention to release oil from the
[SPR] today, it would put an immediate end to the speculative feeding

‘The biggest problem’

30

F. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), the
committee’s ranking minority member,
said, “I don’t know whether tapping
the SPR would have an effect on gasoline prices. I do know that the biggest
problem is a lack of domestic supply.
Congress has closed off ANWR, most of
the OCS, and much of the Rocky Mountains. It has tried to take tax breaks away
from domestic producers. In short, it
has voted down every measure which
would have increased US production.”
John J. Hall (D-NY) said, “We are, in
fact, working on increasing domestic
production of other fuels to reduce our
dependence on oil which has so many
adverse consequences. There are a lot of
new energy sources coming into play
with the financial incentives we have
enacted.”
But John B. Shadegg (R-Ariz.) said
upward pressure on gasoline prices
would best be reduced by increasing
domestic oil supplies. “I agree that we
need to develop alternative forms of
energy, but every expert who has appeared before this committee has said
that the US economy will be oil-based
for the next 30 years at least. We have
already sent the wrong kind of signal to
speculators by locking up so much of
our domestic resources on the OCS and
in the Intermountain West,” he said.
Democrats said legislation is needed
to limit financial speculators’ impacts
on oil markets. “We have heard from a
number of oil and gas executives about
the role of speculators and greed in
driving the price at the pump up, especially for home heating oil,” said John
B. Larson (D-Conn.).
Inslee added that the US Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s authority
needs to be expanded so it can regulate
over-the-counter energy commodity
transactions. He said that HR 594, the

Prevent Unfair Manipulation of Prices
(PUMP) Act which Rep. Bart Stupak
(D-Mich.) has introduced, should be
seriously considered.

‘Not the entire story’
One witness questioned committee
members’ focus on market speculators. “They’re not the entire story,”
said Kevin Book, senior vice-president

refiners have to bid up the price of

But Mark Cooper, research director

does not produce the kinds of price

The SPR’s size relative to the global

have little impact on prices, he added.

Congress also should consider instituting a nationwide 65 mph speed limit
to reduce demand, Berry told the committee. It already has asked the administration to require that all new trucks be

“I think there has been opposition

three specific steps: an outright sale of
40 million bbl from the SPR (which
would produce almost $4.5 billion in
new revenues), suspending the RIK
program in ways that reduce a positive
budget score which could generate at
least $1 billion of new funding for carbon sequestration and energy efficiency

programs, and exchanging 50 million
bbl of light, sweet crude in the reserve
for heavy oil on the market which, if
done correctly, could net $500 million
without reducing the SPR’s overall size.
Markey said that steps clearly need
to be taken. “We have the worst of both
worlds right now: wasting taxpayers’

money buying oil at record-high prices
and putting upward pressure on those
prices with our purchases,” he said. Following the hearing, he told OGJ that he
had not invited anyone from the Bush
administration to testify that day. “But
I plan to in the very near future,” he
said. ✦

Bush to Congress: remove obstacles to raise oil, gas supplies
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US President George W. Bush urged
Congress to send a positive signal to
world energy markets by removing
obstacles to more domestic oil and
gas production. He also rejected calls
to quit filling the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve while oil prices are near record
levels but said he would consider
suspending the federal gasoline tax
through the summer and other proposals.
“If Congress is truly interested in
solving the problem, they can send the
right signal by saying we’re going to
explore for oil and gas in the US territories, starting with [the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge],” Bush told reporters
at an Apr. 29 press conference.
“If we’re generally interested in
moving forward with an energy policy
that sends a signal to the world that...
we’re going to become less reliant on
foreign oil, we can explore at home
as well as continue with an alternative
fuels program,” Bush said.
Congressional Democratic leaders
immediately dismissed Bush’s proposal.
“Only President Bush could allow ‘Big
Oil’ to write our nation’s energy policy,
guarantee billions in oil tax breaks and
refuse to stand up to [the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries], and
then shirk responsibility for [gasoline]
prices that have more than doubled and
oil prices that have quadrupled since
he took office,” Senate Majority Leader
Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said.
“President Bush’s ‘Rose Garden’
32

rhetoric will not lower gas prices for
Americans struggling in a weakening
economy. He must work with Democrats in Congress to invest in renewable
energy and lessen our dependence on
oil,” Reid said in a written statement.

‘Same failed energy policy’
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (DCalif.) termed Bush’s call for more
domestic drilling “the same failed energy policy that has brought record gas
prices.” She said, “Drilling has increased
dramatically since 2000—the number
of wells on land has increased about
66%—and yet the price of gasoline has
more than doubled since President Bush
took office.”
Authorizing leasing within ANWR
would not significantly reduce US dependence on foreign oil or reduce retail
gasoline prices, Pelosi said. “Experts
have concluded that opening up the
Arctic for drilling would produce only
a 6-month supply of oil 10 years from
now [but] nothing that will help consumers today,” she said.
Bush said a major reason for higher
gasoline prices is that global oil production has not kept pace with growing
demand. “Members of Congress have
been vocal about foreign governments
increasing their oil production. Yet they
have been just as vocal in opposition to
efforts to expand our production here
at home,” he said.
Bush said the US Department of
Energy estimates that ANWR contains
enough crude to allow US production to grow by about 1 million b/d,
“which translates into 27 million gal of

gasoline and diesel every day.”
Bush said the country is making a
transition to “a new era where we’re
going to have batteries in our cars
that allow people to drive 40 miles on
electricity.” There will be more ethanol
and alternative fuels, he said. “But in
the meantime, we need to be sending
a signal to the world markets that we
intend to explore here in America.”

Expand reﬁning capacity
Bush said, “We can also send a clear
signal that we understand supply and
demand, and then when you don’t
build a refinery for 30 years, it’s going
to be a part of restricting supply. And
therefore, we ought to expand our
refining capacity by permitting new
refineries and getting after it quickly.”
Pelosi urged Bush to suspend oil
purchases for the SPR before and after
his press conference, but the president
rejected the idea. Buying crude for the
reserve represents 0.1% of total global
demand, he said. “I don’t think it’s going to affect price when you affect 0.1%
and I do believe it’s in our national interest to get the SPR filled in case there’s
a major disruption of crude oil around
the world,” he said.
A full SPR is particularly necessary
because Al Qaeda believes an attack on
a major overseas oil production facility
would disrupt US and other nations’
economies, according to Bush. He said
he does not see any cost benefits from
suspending crude oil purchases for the
reserve but feels “it costs you oil in the
case of a national security risk.”
Pelosi responded, “Contrary to the

Momentum builds
for SPR bill

T

ruckers drove around the National Mall in Washington, DC, on
Apr. 28, blowing the horns on their
rigs and shouting through bullhorns
before an afternoon rally to protest
record-high diesel fuel prices.
The US Energy Information Administration reported the same day
that the nationwide average retail
price for diesel was $4.177/gal, up
49% from Apr. 30, 2007, when diesel
was selling for $2.811/gal.
Members of the 110th Congress
say their constituents complain about
high food and fuel prices. The voters
are restless as almost a third of the
Senate and nearly the entire House
stand for reelection. It’s increasingly
apparent that many members feel
pressure to “do something.”
Most probably won’t be satisfied
for very long to simply let House Minority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) say
Democrats have done nothing since
regaining control of Congress early in
2007 while fuel prices have continued to climb, or let Speaker Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.) respond that House
Democrats have passed at least three
measures aimed at higher fuel prices

domestic oil and gas supplies by
authorizing leases on more of the
Outer Continental Shelf, within the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and
in more of the Rocky Mountains.
Many Democrats think producing
more fossil fuels simply will accelerate global climate change.
Democrats and Republicans also
won’t likely come together behind
Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) call
to suspend the federal gasoline tax
through the summer. But they could
embrace Sen. Byron L. Dorgan’s
(D-ND) bill to halt purchases for the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

‘Momentum is building’

Dorgan, who has changed the
purchase suspension trigger from
$50/bbl to $75/bbl after introducing
the measure on Feb. 6, still plans to
attach it to another bill. “He has the
support of all 51 Democratic senators
and, now, all three major presidential
candidates. So momentum is building,” a member of his staff told me.
In the House, Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) has spoken out frequently on the issue. The night before

president’s assertion, the American
people would benefit from suspending
these government purchases. It could
reduce [gasoline] prices by 5-24¢/gal,
a critical first step for America’s families, businesses and the economy.” She
said the SPR has been tapped previously
by Bush, as well as former Presidents
Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. “In
2000, this action brought the price of
oil down by one-third—from $30 to
$20/bbl,” she said.
Responding to a question about the
proposal by Sen. John McCain (RAriz.), the presumed 2008 Republican
presidential nominee, to suspend the
federal gasoline tax from Memorial Day
through Labor Day to ease upward price
pressure, Bush said he did not want to
wade into presidential campaigns but
added that he would consider this and
other ideas.

Candidate observations
Sen. Hillary R. Clinton (D-NY), who
is pursuing the Democratic presidential
nomination, said Apr. 28 that she would
fund a suspension of the levy with a
windfall profits tax on oil companies.
Her opponent, Sen. Barack Obama
(D-Ill.), told an audience Apr. 29 in
Winston-Salem, N.C., that the “gas
tax holiday” idea was “a gimmick that
would save you half a tank of gas over
the entire summer so that everyone in
Washington can pat themselves on the
back and say that they did something.”
He also supports a windfall profits tax,
he said.
Responding to a reporter’s statement
that the World Bank estimates that 85%
of the increase in world corn prices
since 2002 has been due to the growth
of ethanol demand, Bush said he
thought that weather, increased demand
for corn, and higher costs of raising
it were responsible for 85% of the
increase and that ethanol represented
only 15%.
“By the way, the high cost of gasoline is going to spur more investment
in ethanol as an alternative,” Bush said,
adding, “The truth of the matter is it’s
in our national interest to have our

that are unstable or may not like us.”
Bush said, “We’ve put a lot into ethanol. As a matter of fact, the solution to
corn-fed ethanol is cellulosic-ethanol...
and we’re spending a lot of money along
those lines. But energy policy needs to
be comprehensive and we got to understand that we’re in a transition period.
The problem is that there’s been a lot of

focus by the Congress in the long-term
steps such as hydrogen and the intermediate steps such as biofuels and battery
technology research, but not enough
emphasis on the here and now.”
Pelosi said congressional Democrats
are pressing the Federal Trade Commission to use the authority it received in the
2007 Energy Independence and Security
Act to investigate record gasoline prices.
“The House has also passed legisla-

tion to crack down on oil price gouging, hold OPEC accountable for oil price
fixing, and repeal profit subsidies for
profit-rich Big Oil companies so that
we can invest in a renewable energy
future,” Pelosi said, adding, “However,
President Bush and most of his Republican allies in Congress have opposed
these efforts. Today, American consumers face more pain at the pump, paying
a record $3.61/gal.” ✦

EIA: Lieberman-Warner bill could raise gas prices
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Climate change legislation headed
for debate on the US Senate floor in
early June would significantly reduce
domestic greenhouse gas emissions but
also could dramatically increase natural
gas prices, the US Energy Information
Administration said Apr. 29.
Electricity generation would account
for “the vast majority” of GHG emissions
cuts under S. 2191, which Sens. Joseph I.
Lieberman (I-Conn.) and John W. Warner
(R-Va.) introduced on Oct. 18, 2007, according to EIA. New nuclear, renewable,
and fossil fuel plants with carbon capture
and sequestration would be the key
compliance technologies through 2030
in most cases, it said in its analysis.
But EIA also warned that if such
technologies are not used, electricity
generators probably would use more
gas to offset reductions in coal-fired
generation, “resulting in markedly
higher delivered prices of natural gas.”
The bill would raise electricity
costs by 5-27% by 2020 and 11-64%
by 2030, EIA said. The projected real

Forum: US, Mexico must
solve gulf boundary dispute
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The US and Mexico are becoming more aware of the
potential for disputes over deepwater Gulf of Mexico
oil resources, experts agreed at an Apr. 23 forum at the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in
Washington, DC.
But some of the participants suggested that discussions between the two countries could be severely
limited unless Mexico finds a way to make the transboundary resource question a binding international
matter separate from oil’s place in the national constitution.
“International law is the only vehicle that can effectively deal with this issue,” said David Enriquez,
a partner in the Goodrich, Riquelme, and Associates
law firm in Mexico City. He suggested that the United
Nations Law of the Sea could provide a basis for a
Mexican-US transboundary oil resources agreement
and said the countries should form bilateral working
groups soon.
But Miriam Grunstein, an associate in the Thompson & Knight law firm’s Mexico City office, said the
transboundary oil resource question may ignite a
drive for broader energy reforms, which could take
years to achieve. “It not only would be crossing
national boundaries but also boundaries involving
industry practices,” she maintained.
Lourdes Melgar, an independent energy consultant who served in various diplomatic positions in
Mexico’s foreign affairs ministry during 1993-07,
said the two countries agreed to a boundary in the
Gulf under a 2000 treaty, which included a 1.25-mile
leasing buffer on each side.

of premium connections.

‘Mexico needs to act’
No discussions have been held since, and there
could be a rush to lease tracts on the US side when
the agreement expires on Jan. 1, 2011, because of
significantly higher crude oil prices and improved
deepwater exploration and production technology,
she continued.
“There very likely are significant fields in the
Perdido Belt between the Western Gap and the coast.
Mexico urgently needs to act or it will lose its share of
these resources,” Melgar said.

exico has agreed to talks with
a rebel group that last year
claimed responsibility for a series of
attacks on oil and gas installations that
severely dented the country’s economy
(OGJ Online, Sept. 21, 2007).
The Ejercito Popular Revolucionario bombed the Cactus-San Fernando
natural pipeline to force the release
of fellow militants it alleges were arrested by the government on May 25,
2007. Back then, Mexican officials
said the rebels were not in custody.
The Mexican government still
claims to have no idea about them.
But the Interior Ministry at least
promised to keep investigating the
disappearance of the two men, identified as Edmundo Reyes Amaya and
Gabriel Alberto Cruz Sanchez.
Mexico has good reason to be cooperative with the militants. Although

was in the throes of fending off an
attack of a much different kind. This
time, the attack was launched by thousands of demonstrators who marched
in Mexico City to protest a government bill to partly privatize Pemex.
The reform looks to bolster
Mexico’s oil industry by offering
incentive-based oil service contracts
and opening the refining industry to
private capital.

‘Constitution violated’

Organized by the so-called Oil
Defense Movement, the demonstration was headed by former Mexico
City mayor and presidential candidate
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who
said President Felipe Calderon’s plan
“violated the spirit and letter” of the
constitution.
Obrador, who lost to Calderon in
contested elections in 2006, said the
president “intends to turn over to
private and foreign individuals the
exploration, drilling, refining...pipelines and storage of (Mexico’s) oil.”

said that exploration activity near the
boundary has been modest in the 10
years that the Department of Interior
agency has been issuing leases. “It’s
still largely a wildcat area at its initial
stage of geologic evaluation. Only one
development is proceeding, about 10
miles from the boundary which is far
enough to not raise drainage questions,
and it would not produce before 2010,”
said Chris Oynes, associate director
of the offshore minerals management
program at MMS.
“Currently, the US government
does not have a mechanism to acquire
data from Mexico to enhance our
understanding of the region. There are
indications that the faulting is complex,
which mitigates the risk of the resources
migrating. The question could arise with
leases closer to the boundary,” he added.
“Time is running out,” declared Joseph M. Dukert, an independent energy
consultant who is president-elect of the
US Association for Energy Economics.
“When producers talk about drilling
wells in water 2 miles deep and not
stopping until they’ve gone 5 miles
down, sometimes through a layer of
salt, they’re not talking about producing
conventional oil.”
He noted that Mexico’s national oil
company, Petroleos Mexicanos, has not
had the financial resources to develop
deepwater drilling expertise and consequently is unprepared to produce much
of Mexico’s remaining oil resources.
Dukert said that he does not expect Pemex to be privatized but added that the
boundary agreement of 2000 has set
the stage for bilateral cooperation that
could be extended to the transboundary
resource question.

‘Doomed us to isolation’
Other participants questioned
whether the issue can be addressed without major reforms at Pemex that could
require a constitutional amendment.
“In my view, constitutional change
would be preferable. Our constitution
has pretty much doomed us to isolation,” said Grunstein, who noted that

Mexico’s president, there have been 500
constitutional trials. Felipe Calderon
succeeded Fox on Dec. 1, 2006.
Grunstein said that energy reform
proposals currently before Mexico’s
congress are “a sliver of a solution” because they simply give Pemex authority
to negotiate transboundary agreements
without requiring it to provide contract
arrangements to attract the necessary
foreign partners to evaluate, explore,
and develop deepwater oil resources.
The bill acknowledges that the transboundary question exists but provides
no legal framework to reach and implement agreements, she said.
Melgar conceded that the bill actu-

ally is a very limited oil sector reform
proposal but added that the national
constitution said that international law
can apply when transboundary questions arise. “That could form the basis
for talks and agreements,” she said.
Foreign companies see it as a very
timid effort, Grunstein responded.
“They think it’s interesting that the
government is starting to discuss this
question. But they still want to be able
to book reserves if they help develop
the resources,” she said. The problem
extends to refining because building and operating a plant for Pemex
without having title to the property and

equipment, to the feedstock, or to the
products is not appealing, she added.
“There is a political consensus that
the transboundary reservoir issue needs
to be addressed,” Enriquez said. But he
also expects that it will be necessary for
the courts to rule on any reforms that
pass Mexico’s congress and become
law to provide a possible legal basis for
contracts.
Grunstein said that this would pose
a risk. “If the [Mexican] Supreme Court
does not rule in favor of the reforms,
we’re toast. We’ll be confronting not
only the constitution but also a judicial
opinion which would be setting a legal
precedent,” she warned. ✦

Mexico imports more gasoline as oil production drops

Mexico’s gasoline imports rose
to 360,700 b/d in March, the highest level since November 2007. This
coincided with a 7.8% decline in the

Mexico to reduce oil exports to US in 2008
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Mexico will reduce its crude oil
exports to the US by an average of
184,000 b/d throughout 2008, a situation
that could continue for 2 years longer,
reported a Mexican media outlet.

said a reduction in US-bound exports for
2008—and possibly until 2010—was due
to Mexico’s reduced oil output.
It said the original plan for oil exports
in 2008 envisioned some 1.678 million
b/d heading to the international market,
but the sales volume at the end of the
ﬁrst quarter stood at 1.499 million b/d, or
179,000 b/d less than initially anticipated.
El Universal said the US Energy Infor-

report by the energy ministry. It said
Pemex has not built a refinery since
1979.
Pemex is already drafting plans
for a plant with two separate refining
trains that would process 300,000
b/d by about 2015.

Elsewhere, Pemex’s Minatitlan
refinery will add 100,000 b/d in
capacity in 2009.
Still, to fully reduce imports, officials say Mexico will need to build a
refinery every 3-4 years over the next
2 decades.

mation Administration earlier this month
predicted a 13.2% shortfall of imports
from Mexico during the current ﬁscal
year. According to EIA ﬁgures, Mexico
exported 1.533 million b/d to the US in
2007.
Based on its December 2007 ShortTerm Energy Outlook, EIA forecast
Mexico would produce 3.52 million b/d
of oil in 2007 and 3.32 million b/d in
2008. The decline in Mexican output is
driven mainly by falling production at
supergiant Cantarell ﬁeld, according to
EIA.

Oil production drop
Mexico’s premier Cantarell field produced 1.15 million b/d of oil in March,
down 5.7% from February and—
according to the energy ministry—the
seventh straight month of waning
production at the field.

It added that regulation of future LNG terminals in France should
encourage investment so that France
and the European Union will have
sufficient regasification capacity, and it
emphasized that operators must follow
market rules in their relationship with
clients.
To enable the smooth cohabitation
of exempted and regulated terminals, regulations should not favor one
regime over another, but encourage
investment in both cases, the working group insists. Competition will be
exercised on the offer of services and
the price level, it added.
In the medium term, a better
balance between capacity offer and
demand will lead to an adjustment of
the prices applied by the exempted
terminals with regard to those of the
regulated terminals. The same transparency and “Use it or lose it” requirements should be applied to both

industrial investment. In a European
market open to competition, all projects should be considered within a
private investment logic.
“Supply safety does not depend

only on import capacities and regulation; transparency of infrastructure
data also plays a prime role,” concluded Colette Lewiner, president of the
working group and vice-president at
consultant CapGemini. ✦

Surplus capacity urged
Another strategy involves the
amount of regasification capacity
provided. Because the market is set to
become a sellers’ market dominated by
gas producers and the strong development of arbitrage between destinations, importing countries are better
off maintaining or developing surplus
regasification capacity and surplus LNG
terminals, the study group advised.
It said France offers many possibilities for hosting new LNG terminals
because of its geographic situation and
extended coastline.
The group said the priority for
regulation should be to set up a stable
framework favorable to investments
in gas terminals because construction

In its BC-10 integrated field development
off Brazil, Shell is using
new subsea technologies
that incorporate caisson

Drilling
submersible pumps, surface BOP with slim riser,
and high-power umbilicals.
Paul Dorgant, Shell’s BC-10 venture
manager, told OGJ that Shell anticipates
being in Brazil for a long time.
The heavy oil field will be developed
with deepwater, horizontal wells and
openhole gravel pack completions and
produced to an FPSO.
Shell has interests in 10 offshore exploration blocks in the Santos, Campos,
and Espiritu Santo basins off Brazil.

Campos basin
Campos is one of five major basins
off Brazil, located between the Espirito
Santo basin to the north and the Santos
basin to the south. Campos stretches
from the State of Espirito Santo south
to Cabo Frio, off the northern coast of
Rio de Janeiro State.
Campos basin encompasses several major
fields: Albacora, Albacora
Leste, Barracuda Caratinga, Bijupira-Salema,
Marlim, Marlim Sul,
Marimba, Marimba Leste,
Roncador, and Jubarte.
Industry believed the
basin held the largest oil
reserves on the Brazilian shelf, until Petrobras’

Shell operates the Bijupirá and Salema fields in
the central Campos basin
and has non-operating
interests in two blocks in the northern
Campos basin: BM-C-25 and BMC-31.

Key technologies
Shell will integrate proprietary technologies, in-house expertise, and thirdparty products to produce the heavy oil

at BC-10. The key technologies include:
• Horizontal wells.
• Artificial lift—with all boosting at

All production will flow at natural reservoir pressure.
• Flow assurance—hot oil circulation required to flow the high-viscosity
oil.
• Slim, deepwater riser, electrical
umbilicals.
• Heavy oil

If you’re a senior engineer on a busy platform in
the North Sea – and responsible for subsea and
downhole operations – then you know all about
the horrors your control lines are exposed to.
Especially at one kilometer below sea level and
another kilometer into the ground.
You’re also fully aware of the nightmare that
would result from a sudden failure or other serious malfunction of those mission-critical lines.
Such knowledge tends to make many people
rather nervous.
While others stay remarkably assured, never
seeming to give their installations much of a
thought.
Their secret? Tubulars made of engineered
materials from Sandvik. Materials that will resist
just about any subsea or downhole torture
imaginable.
As the oil and gas industry is up against more
hostile operating conditions, Sandvik’s cure is
more innovative metallurgical technology and
more advanced materials.
By continuously developing new, higher grades
of these materials, we’re able to produce lighter,
yet tougher tubes. Tubes that withstand corrosion, pressure, high temperatures and mechanical
stress better than ever before.
Engineered materials from Sandvik. Possibly
your best insurance against bad news.

ward investment oil price assumptions,
helping to justify the huge expenditures
needed to explore and develop fields in
increasingly deeper water.
Rig constraints, which have limited
deepwater exploration and development, will ease with the delivery of
almost 80 new drillships or drilling
semisubmersibles during the next 2-3
years.
A variety of small companies hoping
for a quick return from +$100/bbl
oil have been drawn into developing
marginal fields, including fields where
production was shut-in but producible
reserves remain.
Speculators, who until recently did
not have a big presence in floating
production, now have 14 production
floaters on order and plan to have the
equipment ready to ride the tide of
requirements for new systems.
IMA’s recent study describes 134

offshore projects in the planning stages
that potentially will require floating
production systems, with some projects
requiring multiple systems (Fig. 3).
About 29% of these projects are at the
bidding or final design stage and 71%
are in the concept development or study
phase.
IMA believes there is a very strong
likelihood that 50-75% of these projects
will actually materialize into equipment fabrication contracts within the
next 3-5 years. It also believes another
large number of floater projects will
undoubtedly surface during the next
several years that are not currently on
the radar screen.

Order forecast
IMA’s 5-year forecast expects
130-158 production floater orders
between 2008 and 2013, as well as
orders for another 40-50 FSOs. These

systems will entail capital expenditures
of $65-81 billion.
FPSOs will remain the most popular
type of production floater, accounting
for around 80% of the orders and capital expenditures. ✦

two regular deck transport barges, 250
ft by 72 ft in size. Versabuild says the
pattern of support hinges decouples the
heave, pitch, and roll motions of the
support barges from the lift structures.
It says the structural design allows
the system to remain stable under transit and lifting conditions and dynamic
loads generated from wave action that
can be expected when lifting structures
both under water and through the
water surface.
Versabuild validated the system in
a series of scale model tests at the offshore model basin in Escondido, Calif.
This system is designed to lift
structures as single units from the
seabed in water depths up to 400 ft.
The system has a rated lifting capacity of 4,000 tons. Versabuild notes that
the four independent lift blocks allow
for controlled lift operations of the
large unbalanced structures for which
accurate weight data are unavailable.
These structures may rest on the seabed
at varying degrees out-of-level and in
some instances may be upside down.
Each lift block has a 1,000-ton rated
lift capacity and the blocks have a 45 ft
by 80 ft spacing for flexibility to distribute lift loads and accommodate an
out of level structure with an unknown
lift weight and center of gravity.
The blocks operate in synchronous
mode or independently.
Versabuild notes that the 3D space
frame of the structure also provides
out-of-plane or side-load capacity, allowing for structures that initially lift
out of level to be lifted and releveled
during the lifting process without the
need to rerig. It adds that the pattern
of support hinges also dampens the
effect of skewed-loading, reducing the
possibility of overloading one lift point
during lifting operations.
The clearance between the support barges is about 110 ft at the water
line, which allows a 400 ft by 100 ft
barge, which hauls away the topsides,
to be maneuvered between the support
barges. ✦

FOURTH-QUARTER 2007
FIRST QUARTER 2008

Winter
2007-08
in the US
was colder
than any
winter since
2002-03
and total
heating degree days in the Northeast
and upper Midwest were nearly equal
to their 30-year
averages. Despite the
colder weather, US
propane markets experienced no price
spikes or distribution system problems. Improvement
in domestic production during fourthquarter 2007 helped offset the impact
of colder weather and stronger demand
in the residential-commercial sector of
the US retail propane market.
Feedstock demand for propane during first-quarter 2008 was also somewhat weaker than expected. This factor
also helped offset the impact of the
inventory deficit and colder weather.

Feedstock
demand
Feedstock demand for propane is an important balancing element for the overall propane
market in North America. When colder weather
pushes sales and consumption in the retail markets steadily higher, ethylene producers in the
Gulf Coast have substantial capability to reduce
their consumption and effectively offset some or
all of the impact of a colder than normal winter. Historically, most of the seasonal decline in
ethylene feedstock demand has occurred during
fourth quarter. Frequently, feedstock demand for
propane rebounds during ﬁrst quarter.

During fourthquarter 2007, US
feedstock demand for propane
tracked the typical
seasonal pattern
and declined by
32,000 b/d vs.
consumption during third-quarter
2007. Feedstock
demand averaged
298,000 b/d during fourth-quarter
2007 and was 21,000 b/d (1.9 million
bbl) lower than during fourth-quarter
2006. Propane’s share of fresh feed averaged 18% during fourth-quarter 2007
vs. 19.6% during third-quarter 2007.
Propane’s share of fresh feed during
fourth-quarter 2007 was also 1% lower
than the average for 2004-06.
Contrary to typical seasonal patterns,

74

however, feedstock demand for propane
remained weak in January and February
2008, averaging 295,000 b/d. Propane’s share of fresh feed remained at
18% during January-February 2008.
The year-to-year decline in feedstock
demand totaled 4.4 million bbl during
first-quarter 2008 and 6.4 million bbl
for the full winter heating season. The
persistent weakness in feedstock demand during the winter heating season
offset about 50% of the year-to-year
inventory deficit at the beginning of the
winter heating season.
The emerging economic recession
has already affected housing starts and
consumer confidence fell sharply during first-quarter 2008. The downturn
in housing and consumer spending is
likely to reduce demand for ethylene
during 2008. Ethylene producers will
operate at 85-88% of capacity and total
demand for fresh feed will average
1.65-1.70 million b/d.
Until March, ethylene production
had been forecast to increase by about 1
billion lb compared with output during
2007. Feedstock demand for propane
will reach 340,000-350,000 b/d during second and third-quarter 2008 and
propane’s share of fresh feed will average 20-21%.
Fig. 1 illustrates historic trends in
ethylene feedstock demand for propane.

almost equal to the 30-year average. For

Propane supply
Profit margins for propane recovery from gas processing plants were
at record high levels in all producing
regions during fourth-quarter 2007.
Although natural gas prices (and hence
recovery costs) increased more than
propane prices, profit margins during
first-quarter 2008 remained strong.
For refineries, propane prices averaged $16-17/MMbtu, or $10-11/
MMbtu higher than natural gas prices
during fourth-quarter 2007. Refineries had no incentive to burn propane
instead of natural gas during the winter
heating season. Hence, US propane
production during fourth-quarter 2007
represented the industry’s full recovery
capability.
Data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicate that
total domestic production from gas
plants and net propane production from
refineries averaged 852,000 b/d, or
44,000 b/d (4 million bbl) higher than
year-earlier production volumes. Petral
estimates domestic production averaged

during November through March,
heating degree days were 7.3% higher
than in 2006-07, 0.4% higher than the
30-year average and 6.2% higher than
the 10-year average.
Petral estimates that total retail propane sales averaged 835,000-845,000
b/d in fourth-quarter 2007, or
45,000-55,000 b/d higher than in
fourth-quarter 2006. We estimate that
total retail propane sales increased to
1.18-1.20 million b/d in first-quarter
2008, or 40,000-60,000 b/d higher
than in first-quarter 2007.
Total demand during the winter
heating season totaled 185 million bbl,
or about 10.5 million bbl more than
during the previous winter. Estimates
for retail demand during the winter
heating season are based on variations
in heating degree days vs. the previous
year.

according to the EIA’s inventory statistics in its Petroleum Supply Monthly.
For North America, inventories reached
a seasonal peak of 73.7 million bbl at
the end of October, or 12.4 million bbl
lower than the inventory peak in 2006
and 9 million bbl lower than the average peak for 2004-06.
Typically, inventories decline by
12-15 million bbl at the end of December from their seasonal peak. A late
flurry of waterborne imports, however,
partially offset normal withdrawals of
inventory from storage. As a result, at
the end of December, inventories were
only 8.8 million bbl below the seasonal
peak.
During a typical winter, propane
markets pull 40-44 million bbl of
inventory from primary storage. During 2000-06, withdrawals of propane
from primary storage totaled less than
40 million bbl only once (2002) and
withdrawals averaged 42.4 million
bbl (excluding 2002). With an inventory deficit of 9-12 million bbl at the
beginning of the winter heating season,
propane marketers reasonably expected
inventories to fall to a new record low
at the end of March 2008.
This year, total heating degree days
(combined for the Northeast, Middle
Atlantic, and Upper Midwest) for the
winter were almost equal to the 30-year
average. The combination, however, of
weak feedstock demand NovemberFebruary and increased domestic
production helped offset stronger
retail demand. As a result, the cumulative withdrawal from primary storage
totaled about 38.0-40.0 million bbl,
based on EIA’s weekly inventory reports.
Inventory in primary storage in the US
declined to a minimum of 23.0-24.0
million bbl at the end of March 2008.
Purity propane in primary inventory
in Canada totaled 10.1 million bbl on
Sept. 1, 2007, or 1.4 million bbl less
than year-earlier volumes but equal to
the 5-year average. Based on statistics
from Canada’s National Energy Board,
companies withdrew 7.5-8.0 million
bbl of propane from primary storage
during the winter heating season and

7.5-8.0 million bbl in late March 2008
and were 3.0-3.5 million bbl below
average.
Propane inventory in primary storage in PADD III (Alabama, Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico,
and Texas) reached its peak at the end
of November 2007 (about 2 months
later than in PADD II) and totaled 31.1
million bbl. Inventory in PADD III was
about 3.1 million bbl below the 5-year
average.
By the end of January 2008, inventory in primary storage in PADD II
declined to only 20.8 million bbl and
was equal to the 5-year average. Withdrawals of inventory remained at typical
levels during February and March,
and inventories fell to a seasonal low
of 12.8-13.2 million bbl at the end of
March 2008.
At this level, inventories in PADD III
were about 2.0 million bbl below the
5-year average.

December, however, WTI ratios were
consistently 69-70%.
Petral notes that US propane inventories declined by only 8.8 million bbl
during November and December or
4.4 million bbl less than the average
November-December decline in inventories during 2000-06. As the inventory outlook improved, concerns about
“running out of propane” diminished
sharply. Spot propane prices in Mont
Belvieu declined by about 1¢/gal in
January 2008 and the WTI ratio slipped
to 68%.

Pipe coating
Bredero Shaw applied both internal
and external coatings to the Medgaz
pipe joints. Flow efficiency coating
consisted of a thin-film epoxy applied
inside the pipe, reducing friction and
turbulence and helping reduce both
pipe diameter and power requirements.
Bredero applied a three-layer polypropylene anticorrosion coating to the
outside of the pipes; a layer of fusionbonded epoxy, followed by an extruded
copolymer adhesive, and an outer layer
of extruded polypropylene. The inner
FBE layer provides resistance to cathodic

disbondment, reducing cathodic protection costs.
The outer polypropylene layer
normally protects the pipe during
transportation and installation, as well
as providing added installed resistance to shear forces, chemicals, and
abrasive soil conditions. For Medgaz,
however, Bredero applied an additional
reinforced concrete weight coating,
providing both negative buoyancy and
mechanical protection. Besides the cage
reinforcement applied to the outside
of the coated pipe, the concrete itself
mixed iron ore aggregate, cement, sand
or granite aggregate, and water.

Pipelay

O FFSHORE PIPELAY METHODS

In 2004,
Medgaz became
concerned that the
limited availability
of J-lay vessels capable of deepwater
pipelay might disrupt the project’s
schedule, pushing
start-up past 2009.
The J-lay method,
with the pipe leaving the vessel from
a near-vertical
orientation, places
its only substantial stress during
pipeline installation near the touchdown point in the
sag bend, making it the method used in
deepwater applications.
The S-lay method, by contrast, places
initial installation stress on the pipe in
the overbend region near the stinger,
which is then compounded by the
combined bending and external pressure experienced at the sag bend (Fig.
3).
Concerns that this combination of
strains placed on high-grade, thickwalled, large diameter pipeline in a
deepwater environment could lead to
local buckling and reduced collapse
strength have so far prevented it being
used in such applications.
Medgaz commissioned C-FER
Technologies to explore the possibility
of an extension of the deepwater S-lay
method from small-diameter pipelines
to large, and to X70 grade pipe from
previously used X65 material. Medgaz
and C-FER were particularly interested
in the effects on heavy section buckle
arrestors of exposure to the S-lay overbend’s high bending loads.
Results suggested that S-lay could
be successfully used for ultradeepwater pipelay of the sort encompassed by
Medgaz, demonstrating that the line’s
proposed pipe-buckle arrestor connection design would not cause premature
buckling as the pipe crosses the stinger,
nor would high bending strains at the
90

Medgaz ultimately booked both
the Castoro Sei (S-lay) and the S7000
(J-lay) for installation work on the
pipeline, but added flexibility to their
selection process by investigating the
limits of S-lay vessels in deepwater,
large-diameter pipelay.

Integrity management
Medgaz has developed its own integrated CAD-GIS system for integrity
management. The integrated system
will combine all GIS spatial data, CAD
design information, pipe procurement
and tracking data, maintenance data,
and pipeline survey data into a single
source, which will then be able to
capture and present different views of
data acquired during any phase of the
project.
Medgaz anticipates that the integrated system will avoid some of the
problems associated with traditional
systems; disjointed survey and CAD
information, the need to manually correlate data at all stages; a resulting poor
collaboration between survey, engineering, construction, and repair-maintenance functions; and a lack of project
data flow between various applications
(OGJ, Aug. 21, 2006, p. 57).

Power
Three Rolls-Royce RB211-6761
DLE gas turbine packages will power
Medgaz. The 44,000-hp dry low emissions units will provide the front-end
gas boosting from Beni Saf. Seven
RB211 units at two compressor stations perform a similar role on the GME
pipeline (between Algeria and Spain,
via Morocco), which exits North Africa
near Tangier before going under the
Straits of Gibraltar and into Spain on the
outskirts of Tarifa. GME entered service
in 1996.
The Medgaz turbines will each power high-efficiency Dresser-Rand Datum
barrel gas compressors. The compressor
station’s inlet pressure will be 45 barg
(about 650 psig), with a maximum 200
barg outlet pressure. Arrival pressure in
Spain will measure 82 barg. ✦

New tool designed for ethanol leak detection
Here’s the new 2020ComboPRO for
ethanol leak detection in fuel ethanol
plants.
The tool helps in compliance with air
quality operating permit requirements
of the US Environmental Protection
Agency’s new source performance
standards (NSPS) Subpart VV. The
portable and easy to operate instrument’s photoionization detection
technology measures ethanol
leaks accurately and quickly, the
company says. The tool’s large
digital display prompts the
operator through basic
operations, and critical data are displayed in
less than 3 sec. Its measurement range is
0.1-10,000 ppm, and audible and visual
alarms alert the operator when predefined
limits are exceeded. The 2020ComboPRO
meets and exceeds the requirements of
NSPS Subpart VV specific to EPA Method

21 for fugitive emissions, also known as
leak detection and repair. And the tool is
also rated intrinsically safe for explosive
environments.

New feature incorporated into ﬂextop computers
This manufacturer of high-performance, portable computers has incorporated Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel Corp.’s
Harpertown L5420 Xeon 45nm Quad
Core processor into NextDimension flextop computers.
As many as two Harpertown Quad Core
processors are offered for the following
computer models:
• The NextDimension Pro and Pro HD,
the NextDimension Evo, Evo HD (shown
at right), and the Vigor Pro SD. The new
low wattage version of the processor provides an increased clock speed of 2.5 GHz
and 12 MB cache, which helps enhance
performance by caching bits of data and

code in the chip itself while performing
other tasks simultaneously at a rapid rate.
The company says users will
benefit from Intel’s
45nm 820 million
transistors placed
into the Intel Xeon
processor 5400 series,
an increase over the
previous generation
Intel Xeon processor 5300 series, which
featured 582 million transistors.
More transistors means more capability, performance, and energy efficiency
from enhancements that include expanded
power management capabilities. These features are designed to reduce virtualization
overhead, and 47 new Intel SSE4 instructions can help improve the performance of
media and high-performance computing
applications, which are common among
NextComputing users, the firm points out.

Energy politics
warps analysis
of oil markets
Deception in service to energy politics is
standard practice in the US Congress.
In the latest abomination, six senators
from the Joint Economic Committee twisted facts in order to scold President Bush for
not coaxing more oil out of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The senators—Democrats Charles E.
Schumer of New York, Byron Dorgan of
North Dakota, Bob Casey of Pennsylva-

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

nia, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, and Amy
Klobuchar of Minnesota plus Independent
Bernie Sanders of Vermont—threatened in
a letter to Bush to block arms sales to OPEC
members that don’t “signiﬁcantly increase
daily production of crude oil.”
A table in an accompanying press
release showed annual average production
declined last year for Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
and the UAE.
“We are writing to urge you to demand that OPEC members increase their
oil production because they are currently
producing well under their capacity,” the
senators said.
News ﬂash: It already happened.
Last year’s crude production by OPEC
members began in the middle of a slump
that started in mid-2006 when the group
became worried about rising global inventories; indeed, important members were
limiting supply.
But that practice ended before yearend.
“Key producers since November appear
to have loosened the taps once again, allowing stock cover to rise,” wrote International Energy Agency in its April Oil Market
Report.
Contrary to the senators’ assertion, unused OPEC production capacity, excluding
politically shaky Indonesia, Iraq, Nigeria,
and Venezuela, remains low: 2.3 million b/d.
Saudi Arabia, which controls most of
that cushion, might let output rise by a
further 300,000 b/d. But then total spare
capacity would fall back to 2 million b/d,
low enough to keep the market skittish at
least until new capacity comes on stream
later this year. Once again, lawmakers have
communicated a scrambled view of the oil
market. The senators deceptively used annual averages to accuse exporters of withholding supply when monthly averages
show they’re in fact raising output.
And congressional pressure on foreign
governments for more oil looks unpersuasive or worse in the context of longstanding US refusal to sanction oil and gas work
on most federal land.

Distillate demand driving market
Growing demand for middle distillate fuels in Asia and Europe has created a
world shortage that can only be resolved by processing more crude to produce these
straight-run products. But because additional crude supplies are not forthcoming,
the result has been a sharp escalation of crude prices, said analysts at the Centre for
Global Energy Studies (CGES), London.
If members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased
their total production by 500,000 b/d, world oil prices would begin to retreat, CGES
claims. However, the price of OPEC’s basket of 13 benchmark crudes averaged
$95.27/bbl through late April, with no indication of any interest among cartel members in increasing production and reducing prices.
In its Monthly Oil Report, CGES said: “OPEC’s view of a ‘fair’ price for oil has
continued to rise in tandem with actual prices, and there is no sign that the organization intends to take any action whatsoever to try to bring oil prices down. Indeed, the
OPEC oil ministers...continue to argue that their actions have had no bearing on oil
prices, which, in their view, are being driven higher by a weakening US dollar, geopolitical tensions, non-OPEC production problems, reﬁnery bottlenecks, speculative
trading on the futures markets—in fact, just about everything imaginable, with the
one glaring exception of their own production policies. OPEC’s member-countries
consistently produced less oil than the world needed from its residual suppliers in
2007, leading to a massive global stockdraw that averaged 750,000 b/d.”
The oil industry began this year with just 67 days’ worth of forward stock cover, 5
days less than at the start of 2007, CGES observed. Global oil inventories were drawn
down last year “as OPEC ﬁrst tightened supply to avert falling prices and then failed
to boost it again in the face of another year of less-than-expected non-OPEC production,” CGES said. The ﬁrst quarter of 2008 witnessed a further draw of 500,000 b/d,
making it the sixth consecutive quarter of falling global oil inventories.
“Worryingly, OPEC once again expects strong growth in non-OPEC output this
year, just as it did in 2007,” said CGES. OPEC expects non-OPEC output (excluding
Ecuador throughout) to increase by 900,000 b/d between 2007 and 2008, compared
with the 600,000 b/d forecast by the CGES. This may not seem a huge discrepancy in
relation to the 86 million b/d of global oil demand, but, given OPEC’s caution since
the Jakarta meeting of 1997, the impact of any underestimate of the amount OPEC
needs to produce tends to get magniﬁed.
“The world needs OPEC to err on the side of overproduction, not output restraint,
if last year’s massive stockdraw is to be reversed and oil prices are to be brought
down from the heights they have reached in the ﬁrst months of 2008,” said CGES.
“At the moment, the organization shows no sign that it recognizes that the world
needs more of its oil and that inventories need to be replenished through large-scale
restocking. On the contrary, OPEC gives every indication that its pursuit of high oil
prices will continue. Faced with what looks like a one-way bet, it is little wonder that
ﬁnancial investors see oil as a safe haven for their funds as the US dollar weakens
and yields on more traditional investments disappoint.”
Production boost
CGES warned, “If forecasts of robust oil demand growth in 2008 are borne out,
OPEC will need to boost its production to prevent oil prices from continuing to rise
over the coming months. Even if global oil demand follows the CGES’s far more
pessimistic forecast, increasing by just 600,000 b/d this year compared with the IEA’s
[estimate of] 1.3 million b/d, OPEC will still need to maintain output at its current
level for the rest of the year just to ease the upward pressure on oil prices and allow
global oil inventories to be replenished at a rate similar to the one at which they
were drawn down last year.”
CGES said market points to watch include:
• US economic growth and the impact of any slowdown in the US on China and
the rest of Asia.
• Any widening of the discounts offered by Saudi Arabia for its heavier export
grades, signaling higher output.
• Eastbound ﬂows of oil as an indicator of Asian Paciﬁc oil demand.
• US crude and product inventory levels in the second quarter of 2008.
• And the level of global reﬁnery runs during and beyond the turnaround season.

Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel. When people work together, the beneﬁts are clear. With
cleaner-burning ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD), the beneﬁts to air quality will soon
be plain to see.
ULSD is the product of advanced industry technology, combined with multi-billion
dollar investments in new reﬁning and transportation delivery systems. Working with
government and engine and vehicle manufacturers, we’re successfully implementing
one of the largest-ever changes in the nation’s fuel system.
Now most of the diesel fuel available on America’s roadways is ULSD. When ULSD
is paired with a new generation of advanced diesel engines, emissions of smog-forming
pollutants and particulates will drop to near zero. Beginning immediately, and until the
nation’s heavy-duty vehicle ﬂeet is completely replaced, annual emissions from trucks
and buses will be dropping – reaching a 90 percent total reduction by 2030. That’s
a clear beneﬁt anyone can see.

API IN CHINA | By Robert Dodge

A good business keeps up with its
customers. And that is what took API
President and CEO Red Cavaney and
a delegation of colleagues to Beijing in
November 2007.

KEEPING PACE
WITH THE
WORLD

Their mission: Ofﬁcially open API’s ﬁrst overseas ofﬁce.
With 80 percent of API’s Certiﬁcation Programs’ customers
outside the United States, it made sense that the association
would go global. And with Chinese oil and natural gas
equipment manufacturers seeking to create new liaisons and
lines of communication with the U.S. oil and natural gas
industry, it made sense that the ﬁrst overseas ofﬁce would be
in Beijing.
Indeed, Chinese oil and natural gas equipment manufacturers
are the fastest growing segment of API certiﬁcation holders.
“If you go back to the key tenet of customer relations, you go
where the customers are,” Cavaney says. “It was very clear
two years ago that if current trends continued, China would
overtake the United States in terms of certiﬁcations.”
Certiﬁcations in China have been growing at an annual rate
of 50 percent and 2007 was no exception. Today, about 800
Chinese companies hold nearly 1,400 certiﬁcations—up from
just 500 at the end of 2004.
Certiﬁcations represent a signiﬁcant portion of API’s selfsupporting programs and provide valuable service to the
industry that also includes standards, training, education
and information. Globally, API has certiﬁed nearly 9,000
individuals who hold over 15,000 certiﬁcations, as well as
2,500 manufacturers who hold 4,000 licenses.
And now, those companies are looking for ways to create new
education and communication links with the United States.
“Our customer volume and expected long-term growth
in China led us to establish our ﬁrst international ofﬁce in

Beijing,” says John Modine, Director
of API’s Certiﬁcation Programs. “The
ofﬁce provides the kind of education
and communications liaison sought by
the Chinese.”
Modine says that the business and
political culture of China requires an
organization to have an ofﬁce with a
senior representative to make those
connections. The ofﬁce lends substance
and the credibility needed to meet with
senior executives at Chinese oil and
natural gas companies, as well as top
government ofﬁcials.
“Now we have standing. It’s like tacit
approval,” Modine says. “And now
that we have established a presence,
we can set up meetings with high-level
government and oil company ofﬁcials.”
Cavaney and a small group of senior
API ofﬁcials made the best of
several days in Beijing, meeting with
business executives and government
ofﬁcials and conducting a number of
interviews with key blue chip media.
The visit ended with a media brieﬁng
and a reception to ofﬁcially open
API’s ﬁrst overseas ofﬁce.
Opening an ofﬁce overseas was a
big step for API, but Cavaney was
operating on familiar ground. In fact,
last year’s trip was a capstone of career
experiences that have taken Cavaney to
China many times.
During the mid-1960s, Cavaney made
several trips to Hong Kong during his
three tours of combat duty in Vietnam,
but the seeds for this career-long
association with China were planted
in 1969 when he received a call from
some old college buddies with a very
appealing invitation. His former
classmates were working on President
Richard Nixon’s White House staff, and
they wanted Cavaney to drive down to
San Clemente, CA where they had been
sent to prepare the home that was to
become Nixon’s Western White House.
As a young White House aide,
Cavaney worked on the advance
8 |

team that planned President Nixon’s
historic trip to China in 1972. Later,
he headed the White House Advance
Ofﬁce for President Gerald Ford
and made several trips to China in
planning Ford’s trip to Japan and
China. And once in the private sector,
Cavaney’s travel there continued with
numerous business trips.
All of these experiences put him in an
excellent position to recognize the need
for API to establish a Beijing outpost,
as well as offer some comparisons of
today’s fast-growing China with the
less developed infrastructure and more
rigid political environment he ﬁrst
encountered early in his career.
“I recall in the earliest period that most
of the roads were hard-packed dirt,
suitable for bicycles, which were the
primary mode of transport,” Cavaney
says. “No skyscrapers could be seen.
Everything was very rudimentary,
yet functional. Most of the heating
was done with charcoal. Most homes
burned it for cooking and warmth. If
you were outside for an hour, charcoal
ashes would, invariably, stick to your
shirt collar and cuffs.”
When Cavaney became head of the
advance team for President Ford, he
not only did the pre-advance planning
but also traveled with President Ford
on Air Force One, including the 1975
trip to China. One memento from that
era serves as a graphic reminder of how
far things have come in China.
“We did not have a U.S. Ambassador
to China yet, but we did have a Charge
d’ Affaires,” Cavaney says. “The most
senior U.S. diplomat in China happened
to be George Herbert Walker Bush,
later to become our 41st President. To
this day, I keep a framed, personalized
note that he hand-typed on a portable,
manual typewriter.”
Indeed, China has changed since then.
Its economy routinely grows at doubledigit rates, expanding 11.4 percent in
2007. And while many trading partners
in the West would like to see China

make greater democratic reforms, the
government is scrambling to meet the
growing expectations of a massive
population eager to acquire the beneﬁts
of middle-class afﬂuence.
“And,” Cavaney says, “visual evidence
of such is seemingly everywhere. The
fact that they have grown so quickly,
the scope and the pace astonishes
me. The fact that you now have 40-,
50- and 60-story skyscrapers almost
as common as mice in a wheat ﬁeld is
rather extraordinary. And, I was also
impressed that some of the technology
they deploy for the man on the street
could more than hold its own in the
U.S. consumer market.”
Such rapid growth requires energy. And
with China having very little of its own
oil and natural gas reserves, it needed
to quickly develop energy companies
capable of competing with the global
giants of the industry to tap reserves
beyond its borders.
In fact, China’s energy consumption
has nearly doubled in the last ten years
at a time when its production has been
ﬂat, according to data compiled by the
Energy Information Administration.
China consumed 7.7 million barrels
of oil a day during 2007, up from 3.9
million in 1997.
A large portion of that growth came
from imports: According to the EIA,
China imported 3.4 million barrels of
oil each day in 2006, up from 631,000 a
decade ago.
Cavaney pointed out that China
recognized the beneﬁts of API’s
presence. “They needed to address
concerns about the quality of some
Chinese goods and supplies, and so they
are getting a respected name to validate
top quality products and services when
earned,” Cavaney says. “At a very high
level, we were well received, which
stands as further afﬁrmation that the
Chinese oil and natural gas industry
supports API’s presence and recognizes
the beneﬁts that we can bring by having
people directly in place.”

ADVANCES IN THE INDUSTRY | By Cathy Landry and Ray Connolly

REACHING NEW
HEIGHTS IN
DEEPWATER
DRILLING
Take the tallest building in the United States,
the 1,730-foot Sears Tower in Chicago,
and stack it on top of itself six times,
and you begin to understand the
achievement of the nation’s oil and
natural gas industry when it began
drilling to 10,000 feet. That’s almost
two miles below the ocean’s surface.
“But it’s far more than just water
depth that presented a challenge
to the industry as it moved toward
drilling in deepwater areas of
the Gulf of Mexico,” explains
Doug Morris, API’s Group
Director of Upstream and Industry
Operations. The Gulf can be a
hostile environment, with storms and
hurricanes, strong ocean currents,
powerful subsea currents at various
depths and thick layers of salt which
often interfere with traditional seismic
technologies. And that’s not all. “At
these depths, we must deal with a
corrosive ocean environment and
pressures of 4,500 psi [pounds per
square inch] on the seaﬂoor,” says
Morris. “Deep formations are often

located more than 25,000 feet below the
seaﬂoor. And high temperatures and
high pressure formations often exceed
400°F and 15,000 psi.
“These are major challenges that require
‘outside of the box’ thinking,” adds
Morris. “And this is something that
our industry engineers are very good
at. There are many examples of major
engineering feats that have allowed the
industry to reach down deeper and
deeper into the Gulf.”

to be connected beneath the water to a
single platform.
“These systems, both above and
below the water line, are truly modern
engineering marvels,” Morris says.
“The scope of the industry’s
achievement is staggering when viewed
over the past two or three decades,”
says Tim Sampson, API’s Senior
Advisor for Drilling and Production
Operations. “Who would have thought

Gulf of Mexico was overcoming the
“weight issue,” says Charlie Williams,
Shell Oil Company’s Chief Scientist
of Well Engineering and Production
Technology. “The deeper and deeper
you go, the bigger and bigger the
drilling riser and other equipment
needed to develop and produce from
the well becomes.”
Rigs previously were designed to drill
in shallower waters and were not able
to accommodate heavier weights.

“These systems, both above and
below the water line, are truly
modern engineering marvels.”
The prize explains the drive to go deep:
The government estimates there may
be 56 billion barrels of oil under the
Gulf of Mexico. And every one of those
barrels is important at a time when
the nation is trying to fortify its energy
security. To be sure, offshore areas have
been a major supplier of oil and natural
gas to America for half a century. But
now, about 30 percent of the oil and
23 percent of the natural gas produced
domestically comes from offshore, and
most of that is from the Gulf.
“The majority of this production is now
coming from areas in more than 1,000
feet of water,” Morris says. “Seven of
the top 20 oil ﬁelds in the U.S. are now
located in deepwater areas. There have
been at least 100 deepwater discoveries
and 21 of them have been in water
depths greater than 7,500 feet.
“As the push into deeper waters has
grown,” he says, “the industry has
continued to respond with an array of
exciting, new approaches. Among those
are tension-leg platform spars, which
are ﬂoating platforms or rigs tethered by
conventional mooring lines, and subsea
systems, which allow one or several wells

20 or 30 years ago that we’d be at
10,000 feet? Nobody. At that time,
1,000 feet of water was considered
extremely deep—a spectacular
achievement. Now, we’re producing
in 9,000 feet of water and have drilled
wells in more than 10,000 feet.”
Getting there was not easy. While the
process of drilling in deep waters is not
so different from drilling in shallow
waters—both require rigs or platforms
to house personnel and equipment to
drill the wells—signiﬁcant advances in
technology were necessary. In the early
days of offshore drilling, all oil platforms
rested on the seabed; but as exploration
moved to deep waters and more distant
locations, ﬂoating production systems
came into use. As production moved
into even deeper waters, equipment
became bigger, and soon massive
ﬂoating platforms with onboard
processing facilities and storage,
sometimes spanning the equivalent of
two or three city blocks, took the place
of smaller ﬁxed platforms. And that was
only the beginning.
Probably the single greatest obstacle to
moving into the deeper waters of the

“Generally, the bigger they are, the
more they weigh,” explains Williams.
A lot of technical work was applied to
reduce the weight of the equipment
required to drill and explore for
hydrocarbons at these extreme depths,
such as using aluminum, alternate alloys
and improved ﬂoatation.
“Advances in buoyancy technology
and riser tensioners, which stabilize the
riser [the mechanism that pumps the
oil from the seabed back to the surface]
from the movement of the rig or the
ship, have been made and successfully
implemented to meet the challenging
load requirements required to drill in
the ultra deepwater environments,”
says Williams.
Williams points to other recent
advances, including slim hole
technology, also known as “micro hole
drilling,” which uses smaller diameter
holes and is a breakthrough in costsaving methods. Another recent cuttingedge technology is monodiameter
casing, which employs pipe that is the
same diameter from the ocean bottom to
the surface, unlike conventional casing
that telescopes to a narrow diameter

at the wellhead. The single diameter
saves costs in a variety of ways and has a
smaller environmental footprint.
“These technologies have enhanced
our ability to successfully explore and
produce hydrocarbons in these extreme
environments,” says Williams.
Williams also takes great pride in a
technological breakthrough that solved
the “shallow water ﬂow” problem that

and labor to drill a well can cost in the
hundreds of millions of dollars, while
the cost to build and deploy a cuttingedge deepsea platform is often in excess
of $1 billion,” says Sampson. For that
reason, discoveries need to be “pretty
signiﬁcant” to persuade a production
company to move forward with
development. “What may be considered
a good ﬁnd in 1,000 feet of water might
be completely dismissed at 10,000 feet,”
he says.

add smaller and smaller ﬁelds to the
production stream.
“The ultimate goal may be to place all
the wellheads and other facilities on the
ocean ﬂoor rather than on the surface,”
says API’s Doug Morris. For instance,
Morris says a North Sea facility recently
installed subsea separation and booster
pumps, underwater systems that separate
gas and oil and give the crude the added
pressure it needs to move from the well
to the platform.
“Assuming that we can
improve on reliability and
address issues such as control
and power systems,” Morris
says, “it might be possible
to totally eliminate the
production facilities on the
surface and rely on subsurface
production facilities for
transmission of ﬂuids all the
way to land.” Those advances
require time, patience and
investment, but companies
appear to have decided
to allocate the research
and development money
needed to press forward
with deepwater development
because they see opportunities
in the Gulf of Mexico.

had thwarted deepwater development
efforts. Shallow water ﬂow refers to
streams of salt water located just beyond
the ocean bottom that often ﬂow into
the well bore and make it extremely
difﬁcult to drill. By developing special
ﬂuids to contain the ﬂows and new
drilling procedures, the industry was
able to overcome “one of the biggest
obstacles preventing producers from
moving off the shelf and into deeper
waters,” Williams states.
“Another obstacle to deepwater
development is more prosaic—the
enormous costs associated with drilling
wells two miles under the sea,” says
Sampson. “Amid strong crude oil
prices, competition has intensiﬁed
among producers to rent rigs and other
equipment and ﬁnd qualiﬁed workers,
causing prices to skyrocket. Equipment

As technology continues to advance,
the issue of needing big deposits to
make a project economically viable
may change. Increasing numbers of
subsea wells are being completed
close to existing deepwater and ultra
deepwater infrastructure, allowing
companies to access the smaller
accumulations that otherwise might
have been left alone. But this raises a
whole new set of cost issues. “When
you use tension leg platforms, you
have direct access to the well in case
you need to make a repair. But when
you are using a subsea system and
need to make a repair, you need to
bring back the huge drilling rigs,
which can be very expensive and
complicated,” explains Shell’s Charlie
Williams. Technological advances in
subsea systems could bring operating
costs down, allowing the industry to

“Twenty years ago, there were doubts
about the resource potential of the
deepwater area,” Morris explains.
“We now realize that it represents one
of our best sources of new domestic
energy resources. The trend in the
Gulf has been that the more we drill,
the more we ﬁnd—so this number
could increase over time. We know
that these resources are there—it
is just a matter of developing the
technologies to reach them.”
Shell’s Williams adds that before the
industry was able to tap oil and gas in
the deep waters, output from the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico was declining as the
closer-to-shore shelf areas aged and
depleted. “We needed the deepwater
to sustain the rate of production in the
Gulf. Improvements in technology

And new technology could keep the
Gulf of Mexico a major U.S. producing
area for years to come. But moving into
even deeper waters than 10,000 feet
likely will not be part of the equation.
“In the Gulf of Mexico, there’s really
no need to go any deeper,” Williams
observes. “While there is some debate
over how deep the Gulf of Mexico
is, the general consensus is 12,000
to 14,000 feet deep. All the new rigs
coming out are 12,000 feet capable.
We’ve really reached the limit on what
we need to do in the Gulf of Mexico
when it comes to depths, but there are
still lots of opportunities for other types

access deposits farther away using
a single rig. “There’s also been a
huge amount of activity to improve
recovery from the Gulf of Mexico,”
says Williams, noting new technologies
could be applied to existing wells to
get as much oil and gas as possible. A
technological breakthrough that allows
even better seismic imaging of oil and
natural gas deposits below thick salt
accumulations that litter the Gulf of
Mexico also could open another avenue
for producers. “There’s a belief out
there that there are some really good
opportunities below these salt beds,” he
adds. Strengthening the capabilities of
mooring systems, utilizing dynamically
positioned rigs and developing systems
to pump mud returns back from wells
also could pay dividends.

companies bid more than $5.2
billion in a federal lease sale in

percent of the bids on leases that

that the technology will be applied

THE NEW API CREDIT EXCHANGE | By Cathy Landry

WHERE ECO-FRIENDLY
MEETS USER FRIENDLY
A 2005 federal law requiring increasingly
higher amounts of ethanol and other
renewable fuels be blended into the
nation’s motor fuel supply has left
many reﬁners, blenders and importers
scratching their heads and wondering
how they will comply. API is hoping to
make it easier for its member companies
and others in the industry to meet the
terms of the renewable fuel program
with the API Credit Exchange (ACE), a
new web-based service that allows users
to ﬁnd trading partners to buy and sell
renewable fuel credits.
“We are trying to help our industry
comply with the new law. We saw
there was a need for this kind of
service so we decided to step in,”
says John Modine, Director of API’s
Certiﬁcation Programs.
The world of renewable fuel credits
opened in September 2007, when
the federal Environmental Protection
Agency established rules to implement
the Energy Policy Act of 2005’s
Renewable Fuel Standard. It mandated
increasing use of renewable fuels in
gasoline and diesel. The standard
culminates in 2012 with the annual
blending of 7.5 billion gallons of
renewables—in the beginning almost
exclusively from corn-derived
ethanol—into U.S. motor fuel
supplies. “As part of its new
rules at the direction of
Congress, the EPA
established a credit
trading program
in an effort to
ensure the
industry
could
14 |

comply with the 2005 Renewable Fuel
Standards and still have the ﬂexibility
to meet America’s energy needs,” notes
Patrick Kelly, an API Downstream
Associate. “The trading scheme is
designed to provide the ﬂexibility
needed to make certain that ethanol and
other renewable fuels are integrated into
the nation’s gasoline pool as quickly and
as effectively as possible,” Kelly adds.
API worked hard to persuade Congress
to include this credit trading provision
in the law.
Under the program, companies that
produce more ethanol-laden gasoline
than they need to fulﬁll their renewable
fuel obligations have the ability to sell
those gallons in the form of credits.
Companies short of the renewable fuels
required can then purchase the credits.

the so-called obligated parties—some
fear it would be complicated and costly
if traders were forced to get on the
phone with dozens of companies seeking
to ﬁnd out who may be in the market to
buy or sell credits. Currently, many of
the obligated parties ﬁnd potential credit
counterparts through traditional trading
avenues, like brokers who manage their
crude or oil-products trades. But some
busy brokerages, Kelly explains, appear
not to have a great deal of interest in
the trading of credits. “Brokers get a
percentage of the dollar amount of a
deal, so they are generally less
interested in trading a
renewable fuel credit
than doing a

crude oil transaction on which they
can make a lot more money,” Kelly
says. Moreover, smaller companies that
must meet the renewable requirements
“might not have the contact list”
necessary to ﬁnd potential trading
partners because they are not routinely
involved in trading activities, he adds.
API recognized a void existed, and
decided to step in and help. “We
realized that the industry might need
some assistance,” Modine says. “What
we came up with was a service that
allows parties wanting to buy or sell
credits to post their needs on an easy-touse bulletin board system. Our goal is to
help the industry meet their obligations
under the new [renewable fuels] law in a
simple and straightforward way.”
In March, API Certiﬁcation Programs
launched the API Credit Exchange, a
secure, web-based system that allows
market participants to easily identify
potential buyers and sellers of credits.
Subscribers can provide a bid/ask
price as a starting point for
negotiations, or they

can choose not to enter a price.
They also can make their names and
information available to all subscribers,
allowing potential counterparties
to contact them directly. Moreover,
they can opt to keep their positions
conﬁdential, whereby the system
will notify them when a prospective
counterpart has expressed interest in
a trade. “ACE users can feel conﬁdent
that API will protect conﬁdential
business information,” Modine says.
He notes that API has a “proven track
record in doing so,” and vast experience
with providing industry statistics and
certiﬁcation programs, which often
include managing and shielding sensitive
company information.
While actual credit trading is done
between parties off-system, the ACE
service gives subscribers access to an
online database, which allows them to
track their trades and create data reports
ready for submission to the EPA.
Summary reports, which could assist
subscribers with federal and state ﬁling
requirements, also are available through
the ACE system. “The latest industry
news is also posted on the site, giving
subscribers a one-stop clearinghouse to
meet credit trading needs,” Modine says.
Subscribers are charged an annual fee to
use the ACE system.
In addition to its credit
trading service, API
will provide

workshops and support services to
help obligated parties familiarize
themselves with the Renewable Fuel
Standard regulations and assist them
with compliance efforts. “We want
the industry to know they have help if
they need it,” Modine says. “They need
to comply with these rules because
it’s the law, and we want to give them
the tools and the information to make
compliance as seamless as possible.”
Renewable fuel credit trading services
are likely to be more and more in
demand in coming years as the use
of ethanol and other renewables
continues to grow, particularly with the
higher mandate passed by Congress in
December 20071. Advanced biofuels—
like cellulosic ethanol, which is made
from switchgrass, corn husks, wood
chips and other nonfood agricultural
products—also will be increasingly
required, although most of the fuels
are not yet available in commercial
quantities. “Under the EPA program,
a gallon of advanced biofuels will be
given more credits than a simple gallon
of corn-derived ethanol, and the ACE
system intends to calculate credit values
for advanced biofuels automatically,
taking the guesswork out of the
process,” Kelly says.
For more information about the EPA
renewable fuel regulations, contact
API Downstream Associate Patrick
Kelly at 202-682-8192 or email him
at kellyp@api.org. For information
on the ACE system or to subscribe
to the service, contact Keyo Didier
at 202-682-8320 or email him at

In December 2007, Congress
passed a law dramatically
increasing the mandate to use
renewable fuels, requiring
that 36 billion gallons of
renewables be blended
into gasoline supplies
by 2022.

A DAY IN THE LIFE OF VICTORIA GRIMES | By Robert Dodge

HER BOOTS WERE MADE
When Victoria Settles Grimes was
a young waitress in California’s San
Joaquin Valley, she never imagined that
one day she would wear a pair of oil
industry work boots that would imprint
in such far-ﬂung places as California,
Colorado, the Gulf of Mexico, Texas
and Alaska.
But after 31 years in the oil and natural
gas industry, Grimes has kicked up quite
a bit of dust.
That’s because Grimes, 55, who
describes herself as a California farm
girl, got a chance to pursue her dreams
in the oil business and

never looked back. She’s been both
a worker and trailblazer for Shell Oil
Company, ﬁrst digging ditches as a
roustabout, later being the ﬁrst woman
to command a Gulf of Mexico platform
and more recently splitting her time
between recruiting Native Alaskan
villagers to work in the industry and
supporting a 22-boat ﬂeet poised to
drill off the state’s coast in the chilly
Beaufort Sea.
“When my daughter was a ﬁrstgrader, she used to say, ‘Mom, please
don’t leave your boots on the front
porch’,” recalls Grimes, explaining
that her children did not want their
friends to know their mother wore
boots to work.

Today, Grimes is a SIMOPS
coordinator, which means she is
an expert at managing complex
simultaneous operations. She continues
to work for Shell in Alaska and lives
in Anchorage. And now, her grown
children are proud that their mom, who
is also the granmother of 17, wears work
boots—and they admire her recruiting
work for Shell, which is aimed at
convincing young women to consider
careers in the oil and gas industry.
“When I go to the colleges, I speciﬁcally
talk to the women,” Grimes says. “I
tell them, ‘This is a great career. There
are many opportunities for you.’ There
is a stereotype that the typical oilﬁeld
worker is this big, burly guy who has
more brawn than brain, and that is just
not true anymore.”

Wherever she goes, Victoria Grimes’
boots leave a big impression.

FOR WORKING
Grimes counts herself among the ﬁrst
career women who started tearing down
those old stereotypes. Her career started
in 1976 in the San Joaquin Valley when

she was eager to move on from her
waitress jobs at Fong Chinese Food and
the El Rancho Mexican restaurants to
land one of the $12-an-hour positions in
the oil industry. “That was a fortune in
those days,” she recalls.
She was hired on as a roustabout and
on her ﬁrst day of work, Grimes found
herself digging a three-by-four-by-six
foot trench in 112-degree heat. “I
had blisters on both hands and
both feet,” Grimes says. “But I was
keeping up with the boys.
I was a farm girl, and
anything they could do,
I could do better.” Grimes
built a reputation as
a hard worker and
was given new
opportunities,
including
working
on a wellpulling
hoist.
There, she
learned
about the

importance of safety—the hard way:
“I put my hand someplace where it
should not have been. I broke two
ﬁngers. I was so afraid they were going
to ﬁre me.”
But after her recovery, she was
welcomed back to work. From there,
she worked at an electric-generation
facility and as a well tester and tank farm
gauger. And then in 1982, she became
a foreman, working in a variety of water
and gas plants. “Shell is fantastic about
training,” Grimes says. “They want you
to have all the tools that you need to be a
good supervisor and operator.”
By 1992, Grimes was on her way to the
Gulf Coast, ﬁrst working in Houston
as a contractor auditor and efﬁciency
expert. The jobs gave her a good
window on the nuts and bolts of the
company, reviewing the contracts with
small vendors and trying to understand
how Shell could spend its money more
efﬁciently. And that led to her ﬁrst
offshore assignment, setting up and
launching the new Mars platform.
Mars is a large ﬂoating oil and natural
gas platform, anchored to the seaﬂoor
by 12 tendons. Grimes joined the team
that ﬁnished up all the documentation
to launch Mars and then she followed
the platform to do the start-up work
and eventually deploy the craft
from Corpus Christi. Once out in
the Gulf, Grimes was a process
associate, who reported directly
to the Mars foreman.

“It took us quite a bit of time to start
a platform that big,” recalls Grimes,
describing the process before the
platform was deployed about 130 miles
southeast of New Orleans. “A small
team including myself took the time to
crawl all over that platform. With that
much equipment, everything had to
be set up for production before we left
Corpus Christi.”

then would have the next 14 days off.
“You eat, drink and sleep together.
You’re one big family,” she says.
On a typical day, Grimes says she
was up at 5:00 a.m., and would have
breakfast before attending a safety
planning meeting. That was followed
by a review of the platform’s scorecard,
a record-keeping device to keep track

One asked me, “What are you going to do?
Are you going to cook for us?”
But Mars proved to be a mere stepping
stone. Grimes was given her own
command in late 2003, becoming the
ﬁrst female foreman in the Gulf. She
took command of two platforms about
160 miles southwest of New Orleans:
Bullwinkle, a large ﬁxed-leg facility
with about 100 workers, and Boxer,
a much smaller one located about
six miles away. Grimes knew she was
breaking new ground the ﬁrst day she
ﬂew by helicopter to Bullwinkle.
“I was there waiting for the helicopter
with six guys who were going out with
me,” she says. “One asked me, ‘What
are you going to do? Are you going to
cook for us?’”
Grimes politely told him she was not
a cook.
“Are you going to be making
beds, doing laundry?” her new
employee asked.
“I smiled at him, and then I told him:
‘I’m the new foreman for Bullwinkle.’”
“So you’re the boss?” he said, asking
the obvious. As his friends burst out
laughing, Grimes responded: “Yep, I
guess I am.”
No harm was done, says Grimes,
laughing about the exchange. In fact,
she speaks fondly of her days on the
platform and the family atmosphere of
the crew who worked for 14 days and

of production, costs, chemical usage
and other measures.
“If we overspent, we would look at what
we could rearrange in the schedule. We
always tried to stay a step ahead,” says
Grimes. “And we shared it with the
crew so they knew our status each day so
they could help build the plan.”
The morning meetings were followed
by a ﬂurry of daily activity: Inspections
of the various jobs underway on the
platform, helicopters coming and going,
more meetings about upcoming jobs,
phone calls to the mainland and supply
boats arriving.
“After dinner, I would catch-up on
phone calls and emails and then go to
bed around 10 or 11 p.m.,” Grimes says.
But it was not all work. “We had a big
screen television, and we’d all gather
around for popcorn and football,” she
says. “And on the Mars platform, a lot
of workers played musical instruments
so there was often a Friday evening
sing-a-long.”
“One of the best things I liked was the
beautiful sunsets and sunrises. And the
sea life was amazing—dolphins, manta
rays and lots of sharks,” Grimes says.
Grimes was noticing something else
among her workers—an observation
that was also made by her superiors: The
average age of the industry’s workforce

was rising and the retirement of the
76-million Baby Boom generation was
going to hit the oil and natural gas
industry hard.
“I brought it up and asked, ‘What are
we going to do when all these “gray
beards” are gone?’ says Grimes. “Shell
managers decided we needed to get a lot
more young people on board, educate
them and get them prepared to carry the
company forward.”
Indeed, the average age of the industry
workforce is 54, and with many eligible
to retire at age 55, experts believe at
least 50 percent of the current workforce
will be retiring during the next ﬁve to
ten years.
From the Mars platform, Grimes was
transferred to New Orleans where she
was one of an initial two-person team
that designed Shell’s initial plan to
reach out to college students. “We built
the program from just about scratch,”
she says. In the end, they designed
an internship program for students
that included a three-month working
experience on a platform and a threeyear structured training program—an
experience she is now promoting with
Native Alaskans.
“It’s kind of like a dating experience for
them and us,” says Grimes, explaining
the students are getting a chance to see if
an industry career is compatible. “They
can see if that kind of experience, work
and schedule is right for their lives. They
do real work, taking readings, gathering
samples and conducting tests.”
Now, Grimes is based in Anchorage
and essentially has two jobs where she
rotates between winter and summer.
During the summer months, she works
in a marine support group that is poised
to begin drilling in the Beaufort Sea.
Last summer, that 22-boat ﬂeet—which
included a tanker, seismic boats and
drilling rigs—maintained positions
in the sea, hoping a federal appeals
court in San Francisco would clear
environmental objections and allow
the company to proceed with plans to

drill four exploratory wells. But the
court blocked the plan, saying it would
take more time to consider claims by
environmental and native groups that
drilling could hurt the environment.
Shell says it has met all requirements
and can safeguard the Beaufort Sea and
North Slope from harm.
Keeping the ships and boats at the
ready throughout the summer was a
monumental task. Grimes’ team kept a
daily logistical operation running that
allowed the boats to remain deployed.
They organized aircraft and boats to
orchestrate shift changes and deliver
food, as well as respond if a crew
member was sick or injured.
“We have to make sure they have the
resources they need,” she says. “There
are a lot of moving parts, and you
have to be aware of what everybody
else is doing. This is a brand new
project, and we’re painting on a blank

canvas. We have a lot of experience,
but Alaska is a very special place in
terms of climate, culture, resource
availability and logistics.”

efforts around Houma and Venice,
Louisiana. A little over $23,000 was
raised by the offshore platforms to buy
gifts for almost 200 children.

After the court ruling and the onset of
winter, Grimes shifted to her other job—
visiting Native Alaskan villages to recruit
workers. It is a continuation of the work
she started for Shell to replace retiring
Baby Boomers. She tells the prospective
students about the programs designed
for oilﬁeld production and scholarships
that are available from Shell and the oil
and natural gas industry. But her work
in Alaska has another dimension: She
also is a goodwill ambassador for the
company among Native Alaskans at the
same time she is recruiting workers to
fulﬁll Shell’s long-term plans to produce
in the Arctic Ocean. She also continues
to keep a toe in the Gulf of Mexico
business. At Christmas, she ﬂew to New
Orleans to manage one of the two huge
Christmas Gifts for Local Children

On a recent Friday, Grimes was at her
desk at 5:00 a.m. preparing to ﬂy to
Point Hope, a small village near Nome
where the temperature that morning was
20-degrees below zero. A high school
basketball tournament was about to begin.
“We have a big project that we are
building up in Alaska, and we want
Alaskans to be proud to work for
Shell,” Grimes says. “We spend a lot
of time at the universities, but we also
want to make sure that the remote
villagers learn about us and know that
we care as much about the environment
as they do.” Grimes was looking
forward to putting on her trusty boots
and heading out to make a pitch to the
students shaped by three decades of
working in the oil patch.

API DATA | By Karen MatusicBY KAREN MATUSIC

THE ENERGY WORLD
IS POWERED BY NUMBERS
Statistics are the oil and natural gas
industry’s lexicon—the language by
which we measure our performance,
support our policy positions and gauge
our country’s future energy needs. As
the national trade association of the
U.S. oil and natural gas industry, API is
a leading source of the industry’s data
and information.
The energy world is built on a
foundation of statistics; therefore,
reliable and timely supply and demand
data is crucial for sound economic and
energy policy-making. In a market as
volatile as the energy market, accurate
data serves as a crucial reality check. It
is vital to head off unexpected supply
shortfalls and ensure that there is
enough production capacity to meet
future demand growth. Global energy
security is not achievable without it.
U.S. energy statistics—those of
both API and the U.S. Department
of Energy’s Energy Information
Administration (EIA)—are relied
upon worldwide by both the
International Energy Agency,
representing most of the world’s
biggest energy consuming nations,
and OPEC, representing the major
oil exporters, major ratings agencies,
and economic forecasters as well as
consumers and businesses both in the
United States and abroad.
“API’s weekly survey of U.S.
oil supply data is essential to
industry analysts, state and federal
government ofﬁcials and the public
for a number of reasons,” says John
Cook, Director of the Petroleum
Division at EIA. “The API survey
provides access to micro-level
20 |

data key to API studies of reﬁning
conditions. Given signiﬁcant
uncertainty, in part stemming from
substantial week-to-week variation
in oil imports and inventory
movements, the API data, when
coupled with similar EIA statistics,
provide a useful range within
which actual demand and supply
components lie in high likelihood.”
Given the thin cushion of global spare
production capacity and relentless
demand growth, it is not surprising
that crude oil prices have scaled record
heights this year. Reporters from
both small and large media outlets
are getting as well versed in industry
data lingo as seasoned statisticians. It
is not unusual to see the terms heating
degree days, reﬁnery utilization, or
even 3-2-1 crack spreads crop up
on the pages of USA Today or your
hometown newspaper these days. As
public awareness of the complex oil
and natural gas industry grows, so does
the nation’s ability to set sound and
meaningful energy policy that will help
Americans meet our energy challenges.
“From a ﬁnancial market perspective,
the global energy market is a datapoor market. That being said, thanks
to the EIA and API data, the U.S.
has the best fundamental data in the
world, and our market relies heavily
on it,” says Katherine Spector, head of
global energy research at JP Morgan
Chase Bank.
As Director of API’s Statistics
Department, Hazem Arafa leads
a team of three statisticians, three
economists and three analysts as they
develop and manage databases on

a variety of industry operations that
go beyond the weekly and monthly
supply and demand reports that are
carefully analyzed by the world’s oil
traders and analysts.
“Our goal is to collect industry data
and disseminate information,” says
Arafa. “We don’t just cover how much
the industry spent to drill wells or to
save the environment, we also cover the
where and the why.”
Through the Monthly Statistical
Report and the Weekly Statistical
Bulletin, API aims to provide timely
preliminary data on inventories,
reﬁnery activity, and production
of major products and imports, at
a national and regional level. The
survey, which API has been doing
in some form for nearly 80 years, is
based on voluntary reporting from
companies typically accounting for 80
to 90 percent of U.S. industry volumes
for the most important ﬁgures. Input
from companies who are not API
members also are included in surveys
in order to provide a comprehensive
snapshot of U.S. supply and demand.
Ron Planting, API’s Manager of
Statistical Information and Analysis,
and his team compile data from nearly
500 reports from respondents every
week, covering reﬁneries, blenders, bulk
terminals, pipelines, holders of crude
oil inventories and importers across the
U.S. But the group spends most of its
time going over the submitted data both
manually and with specialized software,
looking for unusual values, inconsistent
relationships, missing reports and other
things that can affect the quality of
the data.

“We seek corrections or explanations
from respondents for unusual
submissions, and always reserve the
right not to use data that cannot be
veriﬁed,” Planting explains. “We also
have statistical procedures to estimate
for non-respondents in order that our
published results represent the entire
U.S. industry.”
Planting is also one of the most calledupon API spokespersons when gasoline
prices rise.
“Objective information is key—and
that goes beyond setting the record
straight,” Planting says. “The fact
that we aim to produce high-quality
information demonstrates that the
industry is not just spinning words, but
rather takes its role with consumers
and government very seriously. That
applies to supply/demand trends,
health and safety data, environmental
expenditures and all of the other
information we collect.”

This data was especially
important last year when
reﬁners were unfairly accused
of purposely holding back
supplies to boost gasoline
prices. API data showed
that, despite planned
maintenance and
unplanned shutdowns
at a number of U.S.
plants, fuel output
set a record high
in 2007.

LOOKING FORWARD | By Madelyn Thornton

PREPARING FUTURE
ENGINEERS THE API WAY
Imagine the surprise of recently minted college graduates who show
up for their ﬁrst job and discover that after four years of study they
lack the practical knowledge needed to start work in the industry.
And imagine the dismay of their new employer.
API management thought this scenario
was playing out at the nation’s oil and
natural gas companies far too often.
What was missing? They were surprised
to learn at the Offshore Technology
Conference and SPE Annual Technical
Conference and Exhibition that many
of the undergraduate and graduate
engineering students headed for careers
in the oil and natural gas industry had
never seen an API standard. API believes
petroleum engineering students should
not only recognize API standards, but
be aware of their practical use in and
importance to the worldwide oil and
gas industry.
Bill Eustes, an engineering professor
at the Colorado School of Mines,
agrees: “Access to these standards
is huge for our students. The ability
to print and distribute applicable
sections of a standard makes the
material more cohesive.”
Discussions at various industry
conferences, as well as with engineering
professors, led to the launch of the
API Engineering Partnership in
2004. Under the program, IHS, API’s
primary standards distribution, and
API make the standards accessible to
students by offering complimentary,
internet-accessible subscriptions to
the complete set of API standards to
engineering schools.

Engineering professors enthusiastically
embraced the program. As it turns out,
many had been hoping for such a donation
effort for some time. Participants in
the program now include Texas A&M,
University of Texas, Louisiana State
University and the Colorado School of
Mines, to name a few.
“The inclusion of the standards doesn’t
so much change the curriculum as
enhance it,” Eustes says. “By consistently
implementing API standards into the
material, students have a strong starting
point for what they do and are able to see
the practical application of what they learn
from their textbooks.”
For instance, he used the example of API
Bulletin 5C3, Formulas and Calculations
for Casing, Tubing, Drill Pipe and Line
Properties in a classroom discussion.
Students were able to see proof of the
calculation rather than just examples from
the text.
The API program also helps colleges and
universities in earning and maintaining
their accreditation status. The Engineering
Accreditation Commission recognizes
the importance of including industry
standards in the curriculum. In its criteria,
the Commission requires that engineering
programs must prepare students for
“engineering practice through the
curriculum, culminating in a major design
experience based on the knowledge and

skills acquired in earlier coursework and
incorporating engineering standards.”
The size and complexity of the oil and
natural gas industry perpetuate a wide
range of jobs and ﬁelds, all of which are
touched by API standards. API publishes
approximately 500 technical standards,
which contain pertinent engineering and
operating practices.
The API Engineering Partnership is
unique in that API is the only standards
developing organization that offers
its complete collection of documents
to college and university engineering
programs. The program ensures that
students become comfortable not only
with the information provided, but
also with API. This aids in laying the
foundation for a positive relationship with
API, which will hopefully continue into
the students’ professional careers. As the
petroleum industry develops and adapts
to an ever-changing economic, political,
and technological environment, API takes
its position as a vital participant in the task
of preparing new engineers for upcoming
career and industry challenges.
Future oil and gas industry engineers will
be referring to API standards virtually
every day of their careers. the API
Engineering Partnership is a win-win
situation for everyone when they can learn
from the very same standards they’ll be
using throughout their working lives.

When the 110th Congress began its ﬁrst
session last year, the oil and natural gas
industry readied itself for a contentious
time: The new Democratic majority had
vowed during the 2006 campaign season
to retaliate against the industry for what
were characterized as unconscionably
high prices and proﬁts.

supplies, the economy and the average
voter in unacceptable ways.

After last year’s vigorous debate,
policymakers decided against proposals
that would have caused economic harm.
Indeed, the ﬁrst session of the 110th
Congress ended with no major damaging
legislation signed into law. But 2008 is
underway with a revival of the majority
leadership’s efforts, and many of the
punitive measures thwarted last year are
expected to come around again this year.

In fact, the gavel beginning the second
session of Congress had barely fallen when
calls to hit the industry were heard. And
this year’s frothy economic and political
mix helps explain why: Oil, natural gas
and motor-fuel prices continue to rise.
Industry proﬁts remain healthy, and,
without context, drew renewed allegations
of greed and gouging. Weakness in the
economy worsens. The presidential—and
congressional—election contest is in high
gear, and candidates of every stripe ﬁnd
the industry to be a convenient scapegoat
for any and every ill.

During 2007, the House and Senate
tried to enact a variety of proposals
that would have hurt the industry,
including proposals to increase industry
taxes by $8 billion to $31 billion; bar
companies with certain deepwater Outer
Continental Shelf leases from bidding
on future lease sales; repeal existing
incentives and erect new barriers to
domestic exploration and production;
give the federal government draconian
authority to combat oil and petroleum
product “price gouging;” subject OPEC
nations to U.S. antitrust laws, and
quintuple the federal biofuels mandate
without providing a mechanism to
protect against supply shortfalls.

But when the ﬁnal energy policy
legislation was sent to President Bush for
his signature in December 2007, all but
the renewable fuels mandate had been
eliminated. And it included an industrysupported mechanism allowing waivers
of the biofuels mandate.
What happened to produce this turnaround? For starters, API undertook
an aggressive educational effort to
demonstrate how the proposals would
hurt consumers and the economy. And
a robust public debate—that included
API, its member companies and allies—
helped convince Congress and the
Executive Branch that ill-advised energy
policy initiatives likely would hit energy
26 |

API INSIGHT

|

But the debate is not over. The
economic and political environment
promise more proposals from lawmakers
that would impose new regulations and
taxes on the industry.

The House already has approved a
bill imposing more than $17 billion in
industry tax increases. The Senate was
considering how it would respond.
Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, draconian
climate change legislation and tough
security requirements for reﬁneries
and chemical facilities were both being
drafted. The Department of the Interior
was telling Congress that the Treasury
stood to lose $35 billion if royalties
are not collected on deepwater Outer
Continental Shelf leases.
At the other end of Pennsylvania
Avenue, regulations were being written
to implement the new biofuel standards,
and costly new requirements to control
ground-level ozone pollution were in
the ofﬁng. Beyond the Beltway, Senators
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama
pledged to impose tens of billions in
taxes on the oil and gas industry in return
for being elected president, while the
Republican nominee Senator John McCain
campaigned for energy independence and
“break[ing] the dominance of oil in our
transportation sector.”

Here is a detailed look at the public
policy initiatives in Washington that
have the industry’s attention:

TAXES
A lot of lawmakers on Capitol Hill look
at the industry and see a set of very deep
pockets. The Democratic leadership sees
the industry’s prosperity ﬂowing from
the world market price of oil, and that
prosperity consequently is unearned and
undeserved. This attitude holds that oil
companies do not need any tax breaks
and Congress should use the money to
ﬁnance worthier parts of the economy. It
also ignores the link between investment
and reliable energy supplies.
And some critics forget this is an
industry that employs 1.9 million
Americans in high-paying jobs;
delivers the reliable supplies of oil,
natural gas and reﬁned products that
keep the economy running; already
pays hundreds of billions of dollars
in taxes and invests more than that
in conventional and advanced energy
development every year.
The White House has threatened a
presidential veto of the $17 billion-plus
House tax bill. Congress would ﬁnd it
very difﬁcult to override a veto. Even
so, the expectation is that Congress
will continue to propose tax increases
on the industry—whether they are the
same limitations on manufacturing and
foreign income treatment that have
failed before, or windfall proﬁts taxes or
taxes to ﬁnance the federal “superfund”
for hazardous waste cleanups. And our
full-scale efforts to educate the public
and policymakers on the very real
downsides of such policy will continue.
GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE
With the Senate poised to consider
a “cap and trade” bill by the middle
of the year, API and its member
companies are engaged in the emerging
debate over mandatory greenhouse gas
control legislation. A bill approved by
the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee late last year would
impose severe requirements on the
oil and natural gas industry. It would
make the industry accountable for deep
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the production and
consumption of oil, natural gas and

reﬁned products. And there would
be no means of ensuring changes in
consumer behavior that could produce
the cuts.
The industry would have to spend
tens of billions of dollars to purchase
“allocations” to account for the
required cuts, driving up the cost of
domestic exploration, production and
reﬁning. This in turn would encourage

force the rewriting of so-called deepwater
royalty relief Outer Continental Shelf
leases. At stake are a series of leases written
under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act,
which provided limited exemptions from
royalty payments to companies producing
oil and natural gas from federal leases in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The limits
on royalty relief are included in leases caseby-case and have included volume caps as
well as price thresholds.

attractive topic during any congressional
recess that coincides with heavy travel
periods—as well as for presidential
candidates in coming months.
CHEMICAL SECURITY
In 2006, the President signed a law
imposing the ﬁrst federal anti-terrorism
security requirements on industry
facilities, including reﬁneries that handle
speciﬁed chemical substances.

THE DEBATE IS NOT OVER
producers to move those activities and
jobs to countries facing no mandatory
requirements. The idea is particularly
ironic in light of the recently enacted
energy law, with its 36-billion-gallon
biofuels mandate and increased
automobile fuel efﬁciency requirements.
Taken together, the auto fuel efﬁciency
and biofuel mandates enacted last
year would reduce greenhouse gas
emissions from transportation by
hundreds of millions of tons. Even so,
the oil and natural gas industry would
still shoulder most of the new burden
proposed in the Senate’s cap-and-trade
legislation. The House has yet to act
on climate legislation, but the Energy
and Commerce Committee is expected
to produce a bill sometime this year;
if the Senate approves its measure
that could spur House ﬂoor action. It
remains unlikely a climate bill will make
its way to the president in 2008—and
if it does, it would face a veto. But the
climate change debate will continue.
The leading presidential contenders
support mandatory control legislation
and are expected to work with the next
Congress to enact a bill.
ACCESS
Rep. Nick Rahall (D-WV), chairman
of the House Natural Resources
Committee, has expressed interest in
revisiting several anti-access proposals
that failed last year.
The ﬁrst proposal that may be picked
up from the cutting room ﬂoor would

Designed to encourage exploration and
production, the program’s value is seen
in its results: Since 1996, deepwater
natural gas output is up 407 percent and
crude oil is up 386 percent.
The controversy over the program
arises from deepwater leases issued in
1998 and 1999 that contained no price
thresholds. The Congressional Budget
Ofﬁce (CBO) estimated that this would
cost the Treasury $10 billion in foregone
royalties over 25 years. Since the leases
were issued, a federal trial court ruled
that the law does not allow for price
thresholds on any deepwater royalty
relief lease. If that decision is upheld, the
CBO estimates the hit to the Treasury
would be $60 billion over 25 years.
Attempts last year by congressional
critics of the program to force
leaseholders to insert price
thresholds into their contracts ran
into constitutional concerns. Similar
proposals this year likely would draw a
veto threat from the White House.
PRICE GOUGING
With crude oil prices hovering above
$100 per barrel, and the summer driving
season ahead, some in Congress may
seek to revive federal price gouging
legislation. Relatively stable prices and a
veto threat by the president prompted
Congress to ultimately remove a price
gouging provision from last year’s
energy bill. No speciﬁc proposal has
been offered this year. But price gouging
legislation would make a politically

in the making—requires facilities

sensitive security plans and implies
that states may not impose more
stringent requirements.
Environmental and “right-to-know”
public interest groups objected to
these provisions. They also took issue
with the lack of requirements to adopt
“inherently safer” production processes
and feedstock, mandates that would
impose new processes or materials that
are deemed less dangerous but not
necessarily more secure.
Inherently safer practices were sought
by environmental groups after years of
failing to institute similar provisions in
the name of eco-protection. The new
Democratic majority was listening. The
House Homeland Security Committee
was expected to approve a bill in early
March that would mandate inherently
safer technology and let states set even
tougher requirements.
API has been joined by a large
number of other interests, including
manufacturers and agricultural
producers, in ﬁling objections to the
legislation. It is unclear when the House
might take ﬂoor action on the legislation,
and the Senate Homeland Security
Committee has not announced plans of
its own.

API’S OILFIELD TRAINING PROGRAM | By Jessica Pointer

A little bit of knowledge goes a long way. Just ask Kelton Mallery.

OPENING DOORS
TO NEW CAREERS
A little bit of knowledge goes a long way. That’s the whole
idea behind API’s Oilﬁeld Training Program, which helps
young adults learn critical entry-level skills they need to get
started and succeed in their ﬁrst jobs in the oil and natural
gas industry.
Just ask Kelton Mallery. After graduating from the oilﬁeld
program in April 2007, he went to work in the maintenance
department at Parker Drilling Company. “Everything I
learned in the program, I do on the job,” he says.
The API Oilﬁeld Training Program opened in 2004 at
the Carville Job Corps Academy in Carville, Louisiana
in response to concerns of API member companies who
noticed they were spending a lot of time and money
recruiting and training entry-level workers, only to
see many leave. The companies wanted a way to make
prospective workers more familiar with the requirements
and responsibilities of entry-level positions before they
showed up for their ﬁrst day of work.

“Everything I learned in the
program, I do on the job.”

“There is a great deal of turnover in entry-level positions
in the oilﬁeld, and in our industry this is costly because
you cannot send folks into the ﬁeld without training,” says
Denise McCourt, API’s Director of General Membership
and General Relations. “Some people get hired, go through
the training and determine they simply don’t want to do the
work. They ﬁnd it’s too hard, too cold, too hot, or working
seven or 14 days in a row is not appealing to them.”
McCourt was looking for a job training partner that had a
long-term track record of training entry-level applicants,
so she contacted Job Corps about creating a program to
meet the industry’s needs. The Job Corps program was
a natural ﬁt because its mission is very similar to the API

friend told me about the training he
was doing which got me interested,”
he says. “I grew up south of Lafayette
and was interested in working in the
oilﬁeld. I spoke to a Job Corps recruiter
and decided to enroll in the program.”

For Mallery, making the decision to work
for Parker was not difﬁcult. “I was really
impressed by their training program,”
he says. “Because of a previous visit, I
decided to work for them.”

oilﬁeld initiative. Administered by the
U.S. Department of Labor, the Job
Corps teaches young adults the skills
they need to become employable and
independent, as well as place them in
meaningful jobs.
McCourt toured Job Corps facilities
and met with several service and supply
companies in the Carville area and
decided that it would be a great location
for the training program because of its
proximity to the Gulf Coast.
Finding an instructor was the next
step—one that was unexpectedly easy.
“I interviewed for a maintenance
position at the Job Corps facility, and
during the interview I was asked if I
knew anything about the oilﬁeld,” says
John Taylor III, who recently retired
from the petrochemical industry where
he managed four service companies that
serve the oil and petrochemical industry.
He has been teaching API’s Oilﬁeld
Training Program since its opening.

To design a training curriculum, API
created the Job Corps Advisory Council.
The council meets regularly to evaluate
and make changes to the curriculum
to accommodate employers’ needs. A
recent change to the curriculum was
adding a physical training component
to better prepare workers for heavy
lifting on the job. “Working with the
council has been great,” Taylor says.

“A lot of the companies are very helpful
in providing resources and getting the
students employed.”
Since it opened, 50 workers have
graduated from the program and most
have been placed with Gulf Coast
oilﬁeld service companies. Students
are introduced to the basic health,
environment and safety requirements of
working in the oilﬁeld, including how to
lift properly. They also learn about basic
pieces of equipment and how they work,
as well as receive certiﬁcation in OSHA
basic training, ﬁrst aid, CPR and marine
water survival. Students with a high
school diploma or equivalent can ﬁnish
the program in about four months;
those needing to complete high school
take about eight months and ﬁnish with
a General Education Development
(GED) diploma.
“For many students who do not have
a high school diploma, this program
represents a second chance to earn a
diploma and learn valuable job skills,”
says Herb Fritts, director of the training
center. Mallery agrees, adding, “The
training that I got in the program really
helps me in my job. When I started, I
knew a lot about the job that I would
be doing and already had the necessary
skills and certiﬁcations.”
Mallery learned about the training
program from a friend that was in
another Job Corps program. “My

The training program focuses on workbased learning to help identify students’
job skills. Students undertake two workbased learning trips while still residing
at the training center. During the
training program, students meet with a
career transition specialist to determine
their interest in speciﬁc companies and
careers. The career transition specialist
also checks in with the students up to a
year after graduation. “We’ve tried to
set up the program to give the students
multiple employment opportunities,”
Taylor says.
Until recently, only high school
students and young adults in the
southeast Louisiana region were
recruited to the Carville location. But
with a grant from the Department
of Labor, more prospective students
outside the region will be able learn
about the training program.
Indeed, the success of the Louisiana
program suggests the concept may be
expanded to other locations where
Job Corps could play an increasing
role in helping the industry solve its
long-term workforce shortage. Now,
there are plans to open another API
Oilﬁeld Training Program in Riverton,
Wyoming, and the list keeps growing.
“Other states are hearing about our
program and are asking for more
information,” Taylor says. “Our latest
inquiry came from Alaska.”

Many of our meetings and conferences offer excellent sponsorship and exhibit opportunities. Laura Barcaskey of Durable Mecco said of one API conference: “It was
a well spent three-days to get better acquainted with the key industry leaders of your industry, and to learn more about the application of our products in the oil
industry. As with most industries today markings for traceability is a key topic, and technology is allowing data to be captured in new ways in heavy applications such
as down-hole drilling and those subject to harsh environments/processes. We, at Durable Mecco, look forward to strengthening our relationship with the American
Petroleum Institute to handle their diverse marking and identiﬁcation needs.”

COVER
The construction of new gas and liquids pipelines, such as this
42-in. line in East Texas, comprises only the first step in effectively
bringing these materials to market. In addition to building and
operating such systems safely, operators strive to operate their
pipelines as efficiently as possible once in service.This issue’s special
Pipeline Report, beginning on p. 56, features articles addressing the
efficient operation of liquids pipelines; the first focuses on developments in drag-reducing agents, while the second evaluates models
for determining the viscosity of crude oil blends. Photo from

Hostages released from Nigerian Shell facility
Most hostages taken Oct. 10 from a Royal Dutch Shell PLC facility in southern Nigeria have been released, authorities said Oct.
11, adding that a further 8 workers are due to be set free later in
the day.
Around 60 oil workers were seized when attackers wielding
automatic rifles occupied the Shell facility at Oproma in Bayelsa
state after overrunning the nearby navy base. The attackers initially
demanded that Shell tackle erosion problems, in addition to supplying electrical light and water to the community.
Hafiz Ringim, the police commissioner for Bayelsa state, said an
agreement had been reached between the government and militant
leaders following discussions on Oct 10. He did not detail the conditions that had been agreed.
News of the release came as senior security officials in Nigeria said they were laying down strategies to limit the impact of
militant attacks in the oil-producing delta. The officials met after
militants claimed to have killed 30 members of the armed forces
in gun battles with government gunboats and attack helicopters in
the creeks of the eastern Niger Delta last week.

2005 Energy Policy Act, authorizes the US Secretary of the Interior,
as delegated to MMS, to distribute $250 million/year to Alabama,
Alaska, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas from fiscal
2007 through 2010.
All CIAP funds will be distributed through grants, MMS said.
The states must use all funding received under CIAP for coastal
programs and activities, including implementation of a federally
approved marine, coastal, or comprehensive conservation management plan; mitigation of impacts from Outer Continental Shelf
activities through funding of onshore infrastructure projects and
public service needs; and wetlands protection or restoration.
Each state has to submit a coastal impact assistance plan by July
1, 2008, to receive funding from the program, MMS said. They
also have to submit individual grant applications as required and
governed by the DOI’s grant regulations.

Exploration

&

Development

Petrobras group encouraged by oil ﬁnd off Brazil
A group led by Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) agreed
to accelerate its exploration program based on results from a light
oil discovery on Block BM-S-11 in a frontier section of the Santos
basin 150 km off Rio de Janeiro, said partner BG Group PLC.
The Tupi well, in 2,126 m of water, flowed 4,900 b/d of 30°
gravity crude and 4.3 MMscfd of gas from a deep presalt reservoir
through a 5⁄8-in. choke. Tupi involves a large structure that requires
appraisal drilling and evaluation.
Petrobras, operator, has a 65% stake in the frontier block. BG
Group holds 25% interest, and Petrogal 10% interest.

Tullow, Hardman to explore Ugandan Block 2
The Ugandan government, Hardman Resources Ltd., and Tullow
Oil PLC have agreed under a new memorandum of understanding
to progress the appraisal and development activities for Block 2 on
the Ugandan side of the Albertine Graben.
The companies want to realize the full potential of existing dis-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

coveries and “provide time for the continuing active exploration of
the remainder of the block.”
The partners plan to spud the Nzizi-1 well, an updip appraisal
well to the southwest of the Mputa oil discovery, by early November.
They will also carry out further 3D and 2D seismic surveys to
better define the volumes of the existing discoveries, develop infill
locations, and explore the northern area of the block to identify
drilling prospects in 2007-08. The partners are currently evaluating the most effective way to drill offshore prospects in Lake by
the end of 2007.
The partners and the government are keen to start early production with the discoveries already made. If their investigations prove
to be technically and commercially feasible, the petroleum development could use the oil discovered to fuel a potential 50-Mw
local electric power station and supply a small refinery. This would
be significant for Uganda, which has no oil production.

Saudi Aramco will start development
of offshore Manifa oil and gas field in first
quarter 2007 with a production target of
900,000 b/d of Arab Heavy crude.
It expects to let a lump-sum, turnkey
contract by yearend for construction of
a causeway to shallow-water parts of the
field. The causeway will have a 21-km
main artery and branches totaling 20 km
to 27 drilling islands.
In addition to the causeway, the project
will include a central processing facility;
a primary gas-oil separation plant; utility
and water supply plants; a water-injection facility with capacity of 1.74 million
b/d; offshore platforms including jackets, platforms, and electric submersible
pumps; offshore crude and water-injection

trunklines, flowlines, and electrical cables;
pipelines to the Khursaniyah gas plant and
Ras Tanura and Juaymah oil terminals; and
an upgrade at Khursaniyah to handle 120
MMscfd of Manifa gas.
The completion target is mid-2011. Aramco has received bids for the front-end
engineering and design of onshore parts
of the project and hopes to let the contract
by the end of October. It plans to award
offshore lump-sum bid packages early in
2007.

Heritage prepares to test
Kingﬁsher well in Uganda
Heritage Oil Corp., London, has temporarily suspended drilling at its Kingfisher-1
exploration well on Block 3A in Uganda in
preparation for a testing program.
The production test, expected to begin in about 30 days, is scheduled to take
about 3 weeks.
Heritage plans to test as many as four
intervals in the well. The intervals have a
total net pay of 37 m in a stacked sand and
shale sequence typical of the Albert Graben
basin.
Kingfisher-1 has been drilled to 2,125

sure testing and sampling have shown encouraging indications of
hydrocarbons, Heritage said.
The well encountered hydrocarbons in a section above the primary objective, and drilling to the primary objective is scheduled
to resume after this initial testing has been completed.
It could take an additional 60 days to reach the target depth of
3,000-4,000 m.
Kingfisher-1 is the first of a possible two-well initial drilling
program on Block 3A, for which Heritage is the operator with a
50% interest; Tullow Oil PLC owns the remaining interest (OGJ
Online, July 21, 2006).

Firms start exploration south of Mobile Bay
Private Corpus Christi, Tex., independent Royal Exploration Co.
and Petsec Energy Ltd., Lafayette, are starting a two or three-well
program for gas in Gulf of Mexico federal waters south of Mobile
Bay.
The duo plans wells on Mobile Blocks 950 and 951 off the
Mississippi-Alabama state line and Block 873 southeast of North
Central Gulf gas field, which is near the mouth of the bay.
The wells, the first to be drilled on the portfolio of 33 leases
acquired in August 2006, can be drilled in 12-15 days/well and, if
successful, hooked up in within 4 months from completion of the
drilling program, Petsec Energy said.

Heerema to remove North West Hutton platform
BP PLC has let a contract to Heerema Marine Contractors for the
main decommissioning work on its North West Hutton integrated
drilling, production processing, and accommodation platform 130
km northeast of the Shetland Islands in the UK North Sea. The platform sits in 140 m of water.
The field, discovered by Amoco Corp. in 1975, produced 125
million bbl of oil between 1983 and January 2003.
Heerema’s contract covers offshore removal and onshore recycling and disposal. A heavy-lift vessel will remove the 20,000-tonne
topsides and the 17,000-tonne steel jacket down to the tops of the
footings (OGJ, June 20, 2005, p. 51). The units will be moved to
the Able yard on Teesside for recycling and disposal.
About 97% of the material recovered will be recycled, according to BP. After this work is finished, Heerema and subcontractors
will decommission the pipeline, clear debris, and inspect the platform site.
Detailed engineering for removal will begin immediately. Offshore removal is expected to begin in 2008 and to be completed
by the end of 2009. A BP spokesman declined to tell OGJ the value
of the contract.
BP said the contract “represents the largest remaining element
of the total North West Hutton decommissioning project.” BP has
completed well abandonment and topsides cleanup.

standing 65% stake to be transferred to National Iranian Oil Co.
With the agreement, Japan will likely avoid withdrawing from
the development project altogether. But the Japanese government
will suspend planned financial assistance to the development project.
As a result, Iran, which is cash-strapped and has little technological expertise, is thought likely to attempt to transfer most of its
concession to a third party.
NIOC Managing Director Gholamhosein Nozari has already
suggested that Iran could transfer the 65% share to other companies, either Iranian or foreign. France’s Total SA is considered one
possibility, along with other unnamed Russian and Chinese firms.
Due to the threat of United Nations economic sanctions, however, it is uncertain whether NIOC will be able to find a new participating company among any international firms for the project.
Inpex, owned 29.35% by the Japanese government, signed a
contract with NIOC in February 2004 to develop Azadegan. But
development work for the field was delayed by the possibility of
UN sanctions being imposed on Iran due to its nuclear program.
Also Inpex reportedly is requesting from NIOC a proportionate reimbursement of the substantial advance fee it paid for the
development rights.
Azadegan, in southwestern Iran, was one of Iran’s biggest oil
finds when announced in 1999, with oil in place of 26 billion bbl
and reserves pegged at 6 billion bbl.
The field is eventually expected to produce 260,000 b/d of
crude oil, equivalent to 6% of Japan’s total crude imports. ✦

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

According to BP, no company has tried to dismantle a steel jacket structure of this weight and in this water depth, meaning that
new cutting tools are required to carry out the operation.
North West Hutton field is operated by BP (25.8%) on behalf
of CIECO Exploration & Production (UK) Ltd. (25.8%), Enterprise
Oil UK Ltd. (28.4%), and Mobil North Sea Ltd. (20%).

Hess lets contract for Songa drillship off Libya
Hess Corp. has let a contract to Songa Offshore for the Songa
Saturn drillship.
This contract is for the drilling of one well off Libya in fourth
quarter 2007. The contract will start after the Songa Saturn completes a contract with Noble Energy Inc. in Equatorial Guinea.
The revenue totals $17 million. The Songa Saturn is available

b/d by 2010. Current production figures were not immediately
available. ADCO is part of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. group of
companies.
In addition to boosting production, the SAS field development
is intended to enhance the environmental aspects of the fields and
to provide facilities to enhance operation of the fields until 2040.
The contract is scheduled for completion in mid-2007. The
project’s commissioning is slated for 2010.
SAS fields are 180 km south of Abu Dhabi City. Production began in 1974 at Asab and was followed by Sahil and Shah.

Santos begins Maleo ﬁeld production off Java
Santos Ltd., Adelaide, has begun natural gas production from
Maleo field off eastern Java under a $550 million deal with Indonesia’s state-owned PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN).
Santos has agreed to sell 243 bcf of gas to PGN for 8-12 years.
The new gas supply is expected to reduce east Java’s diesel fuel
consumption by 6.75 million kl.
Gas will be supplied at a plateau rate of 110 MMcfd for 5-6
years, then tail down as the field depletes.
The $75 million development comprises a mobile offshore
production unit supported by a new six-well wellhead platform
connected to a 7.4-km spur line to the existing East Java Gas Pipeline. From there gas is distributed to the Surabya and Gresik gas
grid.

Processing
EPA, API mark ULSD’s arrival at retailers
The US Environmental Protection Agency marked the arrival of
ultralow-sulfur diesel fuel at retail outlets with a ceremony at the
Columbus, Ind., headquarters of diesel engine manufacturer Cummins Inc. on Oct. 10.
US refiners began to produce diesel fuel for highway use with
a 15 ppm sulfur content on June 1, down from 500 ppm previously, under EPA orders. The federal agency said that the lower
sulfur fuel will be used by more than 90% of the nation’s trucks
and buses. It estimates that this will cut nitrogen oxide emissions by 2.6 million tons/year and particular matter emissions
by 110,000 tons/year.
American Petroleum Institute Pres. Red Cavaney, who also attended the ceremony, noted that while the change is arguably the
most complex and costly transition ever experienced in US motor
fuels history, its implementation has been smooth so far with no
significant problems concerning supplies or vehicle performance.
Most retailers will complete the transition to ULSD by Oct. 15,
he added. Only ULSD will be allowed for highway and virtually
all off-road vehicles by 2010, and for nonroad, locomotive, and
marine diesel engines by 2014.

The field was discovered in 2002 and contains proved and probable reserves of 240 bcf.
Santos has a 75% interest in the Maleo partnership, and Petronas
subsidiary PC Madura holds the remaining 25%.

PTTEP to ramp up Arthit ﬁeld gas production
Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production PLC (PTTEP) plans to
increase production by as much as 45% from its Arthit gas field in
the Gulf of Thailand, in the first 3 years of operation.
To meet rising domestic demand, PTTEP will produce an additional 120-150 MMcfd of gas from Arthit in addition to the earlier
scheduled rate of 330 MMcfd.
The production increase is made possible with the help of a
floating production, storage, and offloading vessel at the field, 230
km off the southern Thai province of Songkhla.
Following a series of delays caused by technical problems and
equipment shortages, PTTEP has rescheduled the Arthit production
start-up to first quarter 2008 (OGJ Online, May 4, 2006).
The company said it would discuss terms and conditions for the
sales of additional gas supplies with state-owned PTT PLC.
PTTEP has an 80% stake in the field; Chevron Thailand Exploration & Production Ltd. holds 16% interest; and Moeco (Thailand),
a Thai unit of Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., holds the remaining
4%. ✦

will convert vacuum residue to lighter products.
Flexicoking integrates fluid bed coking and air gasification to
eliminate petroleum coke. It allows refiners to process vacuum
resid, atmospheric resid, oil sands bitumen, heavy whole crudes,
deasphalter bottoms, or thermal cracked tar to produce highervalue liquid and gas products.
Flexicoking produces a clean low-sulfur fuel gas, which can be
used economically in refinery furnaces and boilers, as well as by
power plants to minimize nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides emissions.

Husky taps Axens for Lloydminster upgrader

Husky Energy Corp., Calgary, has selected Axens NA of Princeton, NJ, to supply three technologies for a possible future expansion of Husky’s 82,000 b/sd heavy oil upgrader at Lloydminster.
Axens has studied process configuration optimization to establish a firm technical basis for developing the basic engineering for

Enterprise to lay pipeline for Shenzi oil

Electricite de France plans LNG terminal

Enterprise Products Partners LP has signed definitive agreements
with producers to build, own, and operate a pipeline connecting
deepwater Shenzi oil and gas field in the Gulf of Mexico with existing systems.
The 83-mile, 20-in. pipeline will be able to carry as much as
230,000 b/d of crude. Shenzi field is in 4,300 ft of water, covering
Green Canyon Blocks 609, 610, 653, and 654.
The new pipeline will connect a tension-leg platform under
construction at the field with the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline
and Poseidon Oil Pipeline systems at Enterprise’s Ship Shoal 332B
junction platform.
The Shenzi TLP will have production capacities of 100,000 b/d
of oil and 50 MMcfd of natural gas (OGJ Online, June 14, 2006).
Production is to begin by the middle of 2009 from seven wells
completed subsea and tied back to the platform. The field eventually will have as many as 15 wells.
Shenzi gas will move through a new lateral to the Cleopatra
trunkline and on to Ship Shoal 332.
BHP Billiton Ltd. operates the field and holds a 44% interest.
Repsol E&P USA Inc. and Hess Corp. hold 28% interests each.

Electricite de France (EDF), the partially state-owned French
utility, plans to boost its gas presence in northwest Europe by
building an LNG regasification terminal in northern France, taking
capacity at the Gate LNG project in the Netherlands, and increasing
its gas pipeline capacity through the Netherlands and Belgium. The
plans are significant, considering EDF’s previous focus on electricity within France and Europe.
Over the next 3 years EDF will investigate building and operating a 13.14 million-tonne/year LNG regasification terminal at
Dunkirk Port in northern France. If the project proves feasible, EDF
will start terminal operations by 2011.
EDF said the terminal’s capacity under the first phase will be
4.38 million tonnes/year; it plans to expand this to 8.76 million
tonnes/year in the second phase.
An EDF spokeswoman told OGJ that the terminal’s regasified
LNG under the first phase would go to France, the UK, Germany,
and Belgium. “The EDF Group is looking to secure supplies for
north Europe,” she added.
The Dunkirk Port Authority, which focuses on the North Sea, is
France’s third largest third port, handling 6,300 ships a year and
annual cargo traffic of more than 53.44 million tons. EDF beat four
other candidates to win the LNG tender from the Dunkirk Port
Authority.
EDF has also agreed with Gasunie, the Dutch gas transport
network operator, to take a 10% capital stake in its Gate LNG
regasification terminal in Rotterdam, which will become operational from 2010. Vopak, the Dutch terminal tank operator, will
reserve for EDF 2.19 million tonnes/year of regasification capacity at Gate LNG.
Gasunie subsidiary GTS and Belgian transporter Fluxys have also
agreed to reserve 3 billion cu m of long-term gas capacity for EDF
through the Netherlands and Belgium. “These positions are in addition to the 2 billion cu m transport capacity already acquired by
the group on the interconnection between mainland Europe and
the United Kingdom,” EDF said.
The company said all of the additional gas supplies were important for its subsidiaries in Great Britain, Germany, and the Benelux
countries where EDF and the Dutch company Delta are developing
an 870 Mw combined-cycle gas turbine power plant in southwest
Netherlands by 2009. ✦

Gazprom submits plans for Altai gas pipeline
Russia’s OAO Gazprom has submitted to Russia plans for a segment of natural gas pipeline as part of a larger project aimed at
transporting Russian gas to China.
The 54-km pipeline section would extend through Altai. An Altai government commission is expected to take 5 days to accept or
reject the project.
If accepted, the pipeline route is to be approved by yearend,
technical design is to be ready in 2007, and pipelaying would start
in 2008.
The Altai line will link western Siberian fields and western
China, where it will be connected with the projected 2,800-km
West-East Chinese pipeline, through which gas will be supplied
to Shanghai.
Under the general project, Russia intends to supply 60-80 billion cu m/year of gas to China through the proposed pipeline,
which will be commissioned in 2011.

Biofuels in transportation
technologies is needed to provide a
sustainable energy future.”

Agriculture factor
Angel White
Associate Editor
In pursuit of energy independence,
the US government is promoting the
use of biofuels as transportation fuels.
The Department of Energy has set a
goal of ethanol production equal to
about 30% of the country’s current
gasoline demand by 2030, said Alexander Karsner, DOE’s assistant secretary for
renewable energy.
Karsner was one of several speakers
representing key biofuel interests—government, automobile manufacturers, oil
and gas companies, agricultural entities,
and academia—at a recent conference at
Rice University, Houston.
From the automobile industry, Susan
M. Cischke, vice-president, environment and safety engineering for Ford
Motor Co., said about 63% of transportation fuels are imported. Over the
years Ford improved the gas mileage
efficiency in its vehicle fleet, including
cars, trucks, and sport utility vehicles,
she said.
But Adam Schubert, US product
strategy manager for BP Fuels Management Group, said transportation energy
demand is projected to double by 2050.
According to Kyriacos Zygourakis,
professor of chemical engineering and
bioengineering, Rice University, the US
needs about 60 billion gal of biofuels
to replace just 30% of 2004 gasoline
demand.
“It is a formidable task to provide
a liquid alternative to transportation
fuel,” he said. “A broad portfolio of

According to a Sept. 15 report by
Simmons & Co. International Ltd., “The
National Corn Growers Association
forecasts US corn supply will be sufficient to support 16 billion gal of ethanol by 2015-16, which could displace
about 7% of US gasoline consumption
on a btu-equivalent basis.”
The report further stated that “while
we do not expect alternative fuels to
carry the lion’s share of the transportation fuel burden, they can make a
meaningful impact. In fact, current
ethanol and biodiesel technologies
should allow for displacement of
5-10% of current fuel consumption.
Future technologies, such as cellulosic
ethanol, could allow displacement of
nearly 30%.”
Additionally, it said, “The promotion
of ethanol results in a shifting from political risk in the Middle East to agricultural/weather risk in the Midwest.”

FFVs, E85
Sergio Trindade, International Fuel
Technology Inc. director, science and
technology, said, “There are definite
limits to biofuels’ ability to meet transportation fuels demand.”
He added, “What’s the point of flexfuel vehicles without a flexible infrastructure?”
According to the Simmons report,
“In the US, one drawback to these
vehicles [which run on a high blend
of ethanol and gasoline, such as E85]
is the lack of available fueling stations.
There are only 800 retail outlets in 37
states which offer E85 fuel. By comparison, there are about 180,000 gasoline/
diesel refueling stations in the US.”

Biodiesel
The biodiesel industry in the US is
small but has great potential for growth,
the report noted. Biofuels use a large
variety of feedstock and, unlike ethanol,
can be shipped via pipeline. They also
have a favorable energy balance.
The report cited a DOE estimate that
biofuels provide 3.2 units of energy for
every one unit of fossil fuel required to
make them.
Michael Pachero, director of the
National Bioenergy Center for the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL), addressed the growth potential of biodiesel recently in a statement
prepared for the US Senate Committee
on Energy and Natural Resources.
“The growth of [the biodiesel] industry is currently limited by a number
of barriers to market penetration,”
he said. “Additional engine testing is
needed to better understand the performance of B20 (20% biodiesel) and
lower blends in the advanced emissioncontrol diesel engines that will enter the
market in the 2007-10 time frame in
response to EPA regulations.”

Biobutanol
NREL is teaming up with oil industry technology developers to explore
options for integrating biomass streams
into petroleum refineries.
This concept has been the basis of
a joint effort by BP PLC and DuPont to
develop biobutanol. This advanced biofuel, produced from the same agricultural feedstock as ethanol, can be added
directly into refinery gasoline streams
(OGJ Online, Sept. 29, 2006).
Schubert believes, “Biofuels is not a
silver bullet but a valuable piece of the
puzzle to attain a sustainable energy
solution.” ✦

New US diesel era
As US fuel consumers enter a new era of highway diesel fuel this week, the first and probably
only thing many of them will notice is the price.
It’s down from the high levels of this past summer
but higher than the price of gasoline. While hardly
lacking in precedent, a diesel premium to gasoline
tends to attract the attention of drivers of dieselpowered vehicles, who have been conditioned by
history to think their fuel should be the cheaper of
the two. It’s also something to which truck drivers
and other diesel users should accustom themselves.
Gasoline and diesel trade in disparate markets,
of course. Because prices of both fuels move with
the price of their raw material, a crude swoon
since August explains much about their recent
declines. Otherwise, the fuels have different demand and price influences. Gasoline is subject to
seasonal driving patterns. Diesel prices, because
the fuel is chemically so similar to heating oil, are
sensitive to winter weather. Market differences like
these keep the diesel-gasoline price relationship in
flux and perhaps less relevant to economic analysis
than, for example, crude-product price differentials.

Diesel premium
But gasoline and diesel prices are what appear
on service station signs across the country. It’s the
difference between them that fuel consumers will
notice—and complain to politicians about. And
regulations taking effect this week lift chances that
the diesel premium to gasoline will become more
the norm than the exception. Oil industry officials,
therefore, should prepare for questions from a
driving public facing a new round of fuel-market
changes.
Starting this week, 80% of the diesel produced
or imported by all but the smallest refiners and
sold at retail for road use must contain no more
than 15 ppm sulfur. That’s a 97% cut in diesel sulfur content. The Environmental Protection Agency
mandated the ultralow-sulfur product to protect
emission-control equipment required on diesel
engines entering the market next year. When it
proposed them in 2000, EPA said the engine and
fuel changes would cut emissions of ozone pre-

cursors by 95% and of soot by 90%.
The refining industry spent an estimated $9 billion to install equipment needed for compliance.
Beyond the capital costs, the industry’s operating costs have increased for the hydrogen inputs,
catalysts, processing severities, and other changes
made necessary by the EPA diesel program. And
there are indirect costs, such as new pressure on
total oil supply as newly intense processing lowers
product yields. Overall, therefore, the cost of making highway diesel has risen, although a crudeprice slump now masks the effects.
In addition to the newly elevated manufacturing costs, diesel faces a market squeeze. Supply
of ultralow-sulfur diesel in the US now largely
depends on domestic and nearby hydrotreating
capacity and availability of sweet crude. Because
other countries also are lowering diesel sulfur
content, competition for on-specification product in international trade will be intense, which
means the price will be high. Meanwhile, US demand for highway diesel has a new and growing
stimulus: the logistics of fuel ethanol, production
of which is geographically diffuse and transportation of which requires trucks. Further boosts to
demand for ultralow-sulfur diesel in the US will
come from regulatory steps extending the requirement to 100% of highway diesel by 2010 and to
off-road product in 2015.

Rising prices
Increased costs plus supply limits plus intensifying competition for international supply plus
new demand add up to rising prices for highway
diesel unless crude prices collapse. And no one
expects crude prices to collapse. So the next few
years might be very good to producers of diesel
from biological feedstocks and natural gas, whose
products are free of sulfur. But they may challenge
consumers of diesel and of goods transported by
diesel vehicles.
When regulations raise fuel costs, consumers
ultimately bear the burden. In this case, the costs
will yield health benefits associated with lower
levels of air pollution. Those benefits are very important. But the costs can’t be severed from them.
The relationship must not be forgotten when
questions arise about diesel prices, as they will. ✦

The global oil market is suffering
now from a lack of investments in the
1990s when oil prices were low and
refining margins poor, said analysts at
Fesharaki Associates Consulting & Technical Services Inc. (FACTS), Honolulu.
“Low excess upstream capacity and
persistent threats to supply security
have continued to keep [crude] prices
high. Moreover, refining capacity has
been tight due
to low investments over the
past decade,
particularly in
the upgrading capacity
needed to refine heavy crudes into lighter products,”
said Jit Yang Lim, senior FACTS consultant, in a recent report.
The historically cyclical oil and gas
industry is on a new plateau, said Lim.

countries from the former Soviet Union
and Africa accounting for 60% of the
growth and the Americas for 30%.

Sea and OECD Pacific also [should]
see a temporary respite in 2007 from
recent declines,” it said (OGJ Online,
July 12, 2006).
IEA forecasts a 1.2 million b/d
(1.4%) increase in crude consumption
globally during 2006 and a 1.6 million
b/d (1.9%) increase in 2007.
Analysts at the Houston office of
Raymond James & Associates Inc. said,
“IEA believes that Asian, South American, and Saudi Arabian producers may
help fill suspended supply from the US.
However, the agency has also raised its
2006 Chinese oil demand growth forecast from 6.1% to 6.5%.” (OGJ Online,
Aug. 11, 2006).

Energy prices
In the future, oil prices are likely to
be driven by a shortage of crude oil
production capacity instead of refined
products—“exactly the mirror image of
the situation today,” said Lim. “Additional refining capacity is limited in the
short term, but much more is coming
before the end of the decade. China will
add 2.3 million b/d of refining capacity between now and 2010, while India
will add more than 1.3 million b/d of
refining capacity by 2010” Lim said. “In
addition, the Middle East is expected to
add around 3 million b/d of capacity
by 2012, and another 1.2 million b/d
is expected to be added in the US. There
is a potential refining surplus looming
by 2010-12, and this surplus will have
a worldwide impact,” he said.
The global market has been growing
strongly with incremental demand close
to 1.5 million b/d since 1995. Demand
projections by IEA, OPEC, and the US

average about 1.5 million b/d in annual growth for the next 5 years. “The

in 2004. “This solid growth can be
traced to China’s robust economic
performance, with 10.1% real GDP
growth and the corresponding growth
in petroleum use in almost every sector
of the economy,” FACTS reported.
India’s energy demand growth is
likely to stay strong, with expanding
demand in its agricultural sector after
growing strongly in the past 2 years.
Japan’s demand is declining, with
its nuclear power issue “somewhat
resolved.” Although Japan’s economic
situation improved recently, its mature
economy and soon-to-be-shrinking
population are not promising prospects
for long-term growth of oil demand,
FACTS said.
South Korea has recovered somewhat
from the brief recession of early 2003
and is expected to grow at a moderate
rate as a maturing economy. “Overall,
Asia Pacific is expected to have an incremental demand of around 700,000 b/d
for 2006,” Lim said.
With oil prices holding at relatively
high levels in a prolonged increasing
trend, observers now seem to be more
receptive to Colin Campbell’s theory of
peak oil, which holds that “oil production is going to be flat or even decline
in the near future,” said FACTS. “We
believe that the issue is not so much
that the oil is not there in the coming
decades, but that it will be more difficult to deliver the oil to the market,”
its analysts said.
Key factors contributing to high
prices are persistently strong, though
moderating, demand and the perception of tighter supply and rising costs in
the future. Unexpected strong demand
for petroleum products led to a sudden reduction in spare refining capacity worldwide that drove up product
prices, bringing with them increases
in crude prices, said FACTS analysts.
“Petroleum prices have so far been
product-led and demand-driven, but
there is now the underlying fundamental concern with the industry’s lack of
resources or problem of adding new
production capacity,” Lim said.

Politics at play?
Energy analysts venture that politics
influenced the decision to shut out
foreign companies. Russia’s President
Vladimir Putin wants to retain as much
control as possible over Russia’s energy
resources and revenues to give the
country a new source of wealth and
power.
Russia used its leverage last winter
when it cut off gas to Ukraine—and
consequently to parts of Europe—in a
successful attempt to double the price
of gas to Ukraine (OGJ, Mar. 20, 2006,
p. 57). The incident followed a similar crisis in 2004 between Russia and
Belarus. This month Gazprom threatened to cut gas exports to Bosnia unless
Bosnia begins to pay a $105 million
debt amassed over 1992-95 (OGJ, Sept.
4, 2006, Newsletter).
The Kremlin also takes issue with
what it considers interference by the
US in Russia’s attempt to join the
World Trade Organization. US President
George W. Bush publicly chastised Putin
for what Bush termed backsliding on
human rights and democracy issues, an
encounter that generated a hot response
from Putin and a cooling of relations
between the countries.
In addition, Putin is said to be exasperated by Washington’s warm relationship with Russia’s ex-Soviet neighbor

Those elusive
pass-throughs

O

il and gas prices have fallen
more quickly than autumn
leaves in the past few weeks, which
has helped improve the US economic
outlook.
While the US Energy Information
Administration forecasts higher heating fuel prices for the coming winter
months, it also anticipates prices
will be lower than in the comparable
2004-05 period. Winter heating
demand could raise the cost of West
Texas Intermediate crude to $67/bbl
by January from an average $63.80/
bbl during September, EIA said.
That would still be less than this
past summer’s peak price—enough,
some economists and policymakers
say, to ease concerns about inflation.
Oil prices apparently haven’t ignited
inflation yet, and it’s reasonable to
wonder why. The standard explanation is that the US economy is more
diverse and relies less on cheap energy than it did in the 1970s and ‘80s,
when businesses passed through
higher energy costs as increased
prices for goods and services.

Kohn said energy price passthroughs were much more evident
before 1980, when US monetary
policy not only accommodated them
but also allowed second-round effects
to become embedded in more persistent inflation increases.
“Since the early 1980s, the passthrough to core prices has been
limited or nonexistent, at least in part
because households and firms have
expected the Federal Reserve to counter any lasting inflationary impulse
that they might produce,” he said.

Reduced reactions

Oil price movements were more
persistent before 1980 than they
were after—until recently. “Households and firms probably expected
deviations of energy prices from
long-run averages to be largely
reversed and saw less reason to try to
adjust wages and prices in response
to what they viewed as transitory
changes in energy costs,” Kohn suggested. He said there probably have
been some pass-throughs recently

Georgia, which is seeking membership
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Russia has imposed sanctions on
Georgia for alleged spying.
That background, along with the
recent curtailing of Royal Dutch Shell
PLC’s work on Sakhalin II for “environmental infringements,” also leaves
analysts wondering about the role of
politics in Gazprom’s decision to deliver
gas to Europe via pipeline rather than as
LNG to North America.

Europe to receive gas
Miller, however, said that Europe,
Gazprom’s traditional export customer,
was the company’s first priority. It
has been providing gas to Europe for
more than 30 years, and European gas
demand is expected to grow about
2%/year, according to the International
Energy Agency.
In 2005 Gazprom sold 156.1 billion
cu m of gas in Europe, more than a
quarter of European gas supply, Miller
said in the company’s 2005 annual
report. That is about 2.9 billion cu m
more than it provided in 2004. With
European production declining, members of the European Union will import
as much as 75% of their natural gas in
2015, compared with 57% in 2005,
IEA said.
Russia has the gas. The Russian
part of the Barents Sea is estimated to
contain about 22 billion boe (OGJ, June
13, 2005, p. 45). Shtokman, one of
the largest gas fields in the world, lies
555 km east of Murmansk in 350 m of
water (see map, OGJ, Sept. 4, 2006, p.
70). In January, the Russian Federation
Nature Ministry’s State Commission for
Mineral Reserves estimated Shtokman
reserves at 3.7 trillion cu m of natural
gas and more than 31 million tonnes
of condensate. The hydrocarbons are in
four main reservoirs at depths of 1,9002,300 m.
Gazprom expects to begin production from Shtokman in 2010. The gas
initially will be piped from the field
to the Russian coast and then under
the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany

Stream pipeline, formerly called the
North European Gas Pipeline. Nord
Stream, based in Zug, Switzerland, is
a consortium of Gazprom, with 51%
interest, and subsidiaries of Germany’s
BASF AG and E.ON AG, 24.5% each.
Construction began Dec. 9 on the
917 km, 56-in. onshore portion at
Babayevo, Russia, 800 km east of St. Petersburg, Gazprom said (OGJ, Dec. 19,
2005, Newsletter). It will connect existing pipelines from Siberian gas fields to
the planned Nord Stream transmission
line. The onshore system will include
seven compressor stations delivering an
operating pressure of 100 bar.
Original plans also called for an LNG

liquefaction plant near St. Petersburg.
Wingas and E.ON Ruhrgas will build
two onshore connections totaling 850
km from Geifswald to the south and
west of Germany. From Germany the
gas can be transported to Denmark,
the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, and
France, with a possible new pipeline
spur to Sweden.
Intec Engineering has completed
work preliminary to front-end engineering and design on the subsea line,
which will be 48-in. in diameter with a
6-in. concrete coating for a total of 60in. diameter. It will have an operating
pressure of 210 bar. Pipeline operations

are scheduled to begin in 2010 with an
initial capacity of 27.5 billion cu m/
year. Capacity could be doubled with a
parallel second line to be built in Phase
2 (OGJ Online, Sept. 21, 2005). The
subsea line will need no compression
stations in the Baltic, Nord Stream said.
Total capital expenditure for the offshore part of the project, if both pipelines are built, would exceed €4 billion
to be financed 100% by Gazprom.
The Nord Stream project received the
European Commission’s Trans European
Network (TEN-E) designation in 2000
as a priority energy project contributing
to ensuring safe and reliable supplies

Cavaney: Industry needs to reconcile good with bad
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
The oil and gas industry faces a huge
paradox as executives from its biggest
companies gather in Washington, DC,
for the American Petroleum Institute’s
2006 annual meeting Oct. 15-16.
On one hand, the business itself is in
excellent shape. Profit margins are good
not only in exploration and production, but also, for a change, in refining
and marketing. Efficient operations and
dedicated employees kept disruptions
from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last
year from being worse, and the recovery since has been impressive.
On the other hand, the industry has
a bad public image. The Gallup Poll
listed energy as No. 4 in its Top 10
2006 election issues on Sept. 21. “The
oil and gas industry receives the most
negative ratings of 25 US business and
industry sectors rated in 2006. This
suggests that government efforts aimed
at controlling and regulating the oil
industry will be met with high levels
of public approval,” it said in an article
posted on its web site.
Industry leaders are very much aware
of this paradox, API Pres. Red Cavaney

the business works, Cavaney said. “We
had to become more vocal. Our friends
were telling us they couldn’t go on being the only voices,” he said.
Cavaney emphasized that what API
and its members are undertaking is
an educational advocacy effort, not
an image campaign. “At our coming
annual meeting, we’ll ask the board
and membership for reaffirmation that
the industry needs to carry forward
over several years to try and get a more
balanced perspective in developing
national policies,” he said.
“It’s an incredible dichotomy,”
Cavaney observed. “From an operations standpoint, companies are at the
top of their game. From a public policy
standpoint, the industry is in a severe

the Union address. Cavaney said it was
a catalyst for groups and individuals
opposing the use of oil to aggressively
promote alternatives as ways to achieve
energy independence.

‘A fool’s errand’

I

n a bid to move Japan toward energy self-sufficiency, the country’s
Ministry of Economy, Trade, and
Industry is promoting technologies
to provide new fuel sources, among
them methane hydrate.
Described by some observers as a
sherbet-like substance, methane hydrate is a mixture of methane trapped
in frozen water. Some reports say the
energy generated by each cubic meter of hydrate is equal to that released
by up to 180 cu m of natural gas.
Word of the new resource
emerged last February when a
research team from the University
of Tokyo and the Japan Agency for
Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) announced that it
had successfully tapped a cache of
methane hydrate lying relatively close
to the seabed 30 km north of Joetsu,
Niigata Prefecture.

Near the seabed
The new cache was said to be the
first discovered in Asia lying relatively
close to the seabed, making it fairly
easy to extract, unlike most known
deposits, which exist hundreds of
meters below the ocean floor.
JAMSTEC identified the methane
hydrate deposit off the coast of Joetsu
at ocean depths of 800-1,000 m and
successfully extracted samples from
the site by inserting a 10 cm-diameter tube just 6-12 m into the ocean
floor. Seabeds around Japan are now
thought to contain 7 trillion cu m of
methane hydrate, equal to 100 years
of natural gas consumption in Japan
at the current rate of use. It will thus
come as no surprise to learn that the
Japanese government hopes to extract
and use its of subsea methane hydrate
26

to reduce its dependence on crude
oil, a dependence made all the more
uncertain by future price rises due
to supply-demand conditions and
geopolitical risks.

Tests in Canada
Indeed, starting about December,
METI, and Japan Oil, Gas & Metals
National Corp. plan to conduct methane production tests in northwestern
Canada with the Canadian government. If the experiments go well,
the Japanese interests may begin trial
extractions of methane hydrate from
the Pacific Ocean floor by fiscal 2009.
The Japanese government, which
aims to begin commercialized
extraction of methane hydrate in
fiscal 2017, believes that commercial methane hydrate harvesting can
become a reality if low-cost, high
volume production methods are
developed.
It is not alone in that belief.
China plans to spend $100 million over the next decade on studying natural gas hydrates, and trial
exploration of methane hydrate is
expected to become viable between
2010 and 2015. According to one
report, China so far has discovered
enormous deposits of gas hydrates in
offshore areas; those spotted in the
northern part of the South China Sea
are expected to amount to half the
country’s onshore oil resources.
But the National Development
and Reform Commission said that
further technological breakthroughs
were necessary before the fuel would
be commercially developed. Doubtlessly, the Chinese will be keeping a
very close eye on developments in
Japan. ✦

“As a long-term goal, it might be
worthwhile. But looking at what the US
economy faces over the next few decades, the idea is a fool’s errand. None
of the current technology will accomplish this,” Cavaney said.
He said control of the US House of
Representatives, and possibly the Senate,
could move to the Democrats, and their
energy strategies may rely more on
mandates than the marketplace.
“We’ve seen this movie before. After
the oil embargo in the 1970s, government tried to develop several programs.
It did a pretty good job on energy efficiency standards initially but just about
everything else, from price controls to
the windfall profit tax, failed,” he said.
At that time, he said, there was
enough spare productive capacity that
the industry could continue to supply
consumers. “Now, there’s such a passionate search for the successor to oil
and gas that we’re concerned that policymakers could direct efforts toward
perceived solutions. But what if they fall
short of their goals and the oil industry
has been so marginalized that it can’t
step up to fill the void? Our national
economy would be at a serious disadvantage,” Cavaney said.
He said he would like to see national
energy policymakers emphasize energy
security, instead of independence, by
first, recognizing the value of conservation and efficiency, particularly with
growing demand overseas from emerging economies; second, increasing
and diversifying supply sources, both
domestically and globally; and third,
increasing government’s support of
technology research and development.
Cavaney said the industry has been
doing its part to foster research and
development. Of the $135 billion of

he said the oil and gas industry spent
73% of the total, government spent
another 4%, and the remainder came
from other businesses, academia, and
special foundations.
“If we are marginalized with burdensome taxes, we’ll lose our capacity
to reinvest,” he warned.

National oil companies
Cavaney also pointed out that the
worldwide oil industry has changed in
the last 30 years as national oil compa-

nies have become dominant, reaching
a point where they own 79% of the
total reserves. “If US policy formulas
for energy marginalize publicly held oil
companies and make them noncompetitive, who does that leave to supply consumers?” he asked. Cavaney said that for
every example of successful governmentdriven energy efforts, such as automotive
fuel efficiency and the removal of lead as
a gasoline antiknock compound, there
are several more failures.
“Most economists agree that command-and-control schemes don’t work

as well as a free market. Many say that
while there is no totally free market in
oil and gas, it still is preferable to mandates,” he said.
API’s president observed that while
free and transparent energy markets
are preferable, “at the end of the day,
energy is driven by government policies—from where you can drill or build
facilities to the composition of fuels.
There has to be a constructive partnership between industry and government.” ✦

“As the world oil market changes,

including a third quality stream in addition to the sweet and sour streams it
already has because that would be more
economical and efficient.
GAO’s review aimed to answer three
questions:

• Based on experience, what factors
do experts believe should be considered in filling and using the strategic
reserve?
• To what extent can the SPR protect
the US economy from damage during
oil supply disruptions?
• Under what circumstances would
a larger SPR be warranted? ✦

DOE’s responses
Responding to the report, DOE said
it agreed with most of the recommendations but noted that the SPR’s history
“is replete with changes in priorities
that led to either acceleration or deceleration of the fill program.”
DOE said that in accordance with
both federal law and good management, it always favors minimizing oil
acquisition costs but cannot always
delay or defer purchases for this reason.
For instance, during 2002-04
several domestic producers that send
oil into the SPR under the Department
of Interior’s royalty-in-kind program
were willing to defer deliveries because of spot and future market prices.
DOE said that its fossil energy office
was focused on security concerns at
that point and did not generally agree
to deferrals.
“In the current market, futures prices
are generally higher than spot prices
and consequently companies are not
eager to defer deliveries, and there is
no opportunity for the department to
significantly reduce acquisition costs,”
it added.
DOE also questioned GAO’s estimate
of $590 million in potential savings
from 2001 through 2005 using dollarcost averaging because all oil acquired
for the reserve during this period was
under DOI’s royalty-in-kind program
and involved no cash purchases.
Although DOE said it agrees that
some SPR oil should be heavier than
what is currently stored, it does not

Stewart also cited water produced

“This is a difficult water to dispose of

have been developed to treat this water,
but its beneficial use has not been

uses include municipal augmentation of
a new water resource, industrial and agricultural interests, and environmental
enhancement through the creation of
wetlands and in-stream flows,” he said.
He said two federal agencies could
help find ways to use produced water
aboveground. The Bureau of Reclamation has experience removing salt from
brackish water and has access to end
users, while the US Geological Survey
understands how produced water can
be used and what water-quality technologies are necessary.
“In addition, there will be a need to
prove to the energy industry that these
technologies are feasible and will assist in the development of new energy
resources,” Stewart said.
Templet told the subcommittee,
“Water treatment must compete with

forgoes the opportunity to use millions

Bliss said the IOGCC expects by the
end of 2006 to complete a national
study with ALL Consulting LLC of Tulsa
of managing produced water from conventional and unconventional onshore

operations. The Department of Energy’s
National Energy Research Laboratory

funded the study, which has identified
uses for produced water that include
agricultural irrigation, power generation, aquifer storage and recovery, enhanced oil recovery, surface discharge,
and water for wildlife.
Bliss said the final handbook for the

P ICKETTS RIDGE ASA AND TOP YEGUA STRUCTURE, 1992

Production effects
Premier’s 1992 survey identified
Picketts Ridge, a 200-acre ASA named
after the Yegua field that was present on
the far southwest end of the ASA (Fig.
2).
This ASA was an elongate anomaly
with the Energy Development No. 1
Barr, producing 1.2 MMcfd of gas and
23 b/d of oil (completed in 1991)
located in the southwest corner of the
anomaly. It appeared to Premier that an
offset opportunity could be drilled in
the northeast part of the anomaly.
In attempting to lease the offset
acreage, Premier found that a company
was already preparing to drill to the
northeast about a half mile. The Landers
No. 1 was located on 2D seismic data to
test the crest of a Yegua structure (Fig.
2). This structural test was located just
outside the ASA.
The well cut three Yegua sands but
was plugged and abandoned as the
sands were tight and wet. In 1996, after
5 years, the No. 1 Barr well went off
production.
Premier resurveyed the Picketts
Ridge Prospect in 1998 to determine what effect the depleted No. 1
Barr had had on the ASA. That survey
found that the ASA was now absent
around the Barr well but was still
present to the northeast covering 160
acres (Fig. 3).
Premier interpreted this to mean that
hydrocarbons were still trapped and
that the No. 1 Barr did not drain the
entire accumulation. This makes sense
considering the Barr well produced
only 0.315 bcf but the original ASA
covered 200 acres.
In 2003, Patterson Petroleum drilled
this remnant ASA 500 ft south of the
Landers dry hole and made a completion in the Lower EY Yegua sand at a
rate of 1.5 MMcfd and 325 b/d of oil.

Sand traps juxtaposed
The Jones ASA mapped in 1992
covered 600 acres and was an isolated
anomaly that was not on trend with
other Wilcox or Yegua production (Fig.
9). It was an oval anomaly that was
enigmatic without seismic to map the
subsurface.
In 2004 Dynamic Energy drilled
two wells in the Jones ASA. The wells
were completed at two different depths
in Yegua sands and had rates of 784
Mcfd and 6 b/d of condensate and 1.8
MMcfd and 46 b/d of condensate. The
ASA appeared to indicate one trap but
was reported to be two separate AVOs
in the Yegua, which seems to be corroborated by the depths of the different
perforated intervals (Fig. 9).
The ASA shape from well locations
probably reflects two hydrocarbon traps
that parallel the regional grain and are
stratigraphic in nature. Contrast this
with the Picketts Ridge ASA, where the
traps are in line (Fig. 2).

the Yegua or Wilcox sand section. We
believe this confirms that ASAs reflect
vertical seepage of gas from subsurface
hydrocarbon traps to the surface and
then to the atmosphere. This atmospheric seepage information defines the
size, shape, and geological orientation
of hydrocarbon accumulations and saves
time and improves success rates.
Premier’s airborne seepage work in
Wharton County confirmed our postulation that an exploration program that

2,000

4,000 ft

begins with an atmospheric seepage
survey can cut costs and immediately
begin delineating drillable prospects
when followed up with a solid geological and geophysical evaluation.
An airborne survey can assess 30,000
to 45,000 acres/day. As the Gulf Coast
trend is now covered with extensive 3D
surveys for sale, ASA mapping can be
used to focus an explorationist on the
specific areas to purchase 3D seismic
data for prospect mapping.

Premier continues to purchase
seismic data to
develop anomalies
defined from the
1992 survey.
One current

prospect will test a deeper structure under a Yegua, Nod mex field. The strong
anomaly over a depleted Nod mex
field indicates the high probability of a
deeper trap.
The other ASA to be drilled later this
year is a 2,200-acre Wilcox trap. It was
one of several ASAs larger than 2,000
acres Premier initially identified with
the 1992 seepage survey. Other Wilcox
ASAs in the immediate area have proven
productive, and the similarity of this
anomaly to them and Wilcox structure
supports this as a Wilcox trap. A 3D
survey was purchased and an up-tothe-coast fault develops a trap in the top
200 ft of the Wilcox, forming a threeway closure.

Continental Energy retained 18% of
the 900,000-acre PSC in East Kalimantan.
To earn its 70% stake, CNPC will
pay an $18.7 million earning obligation into an account jointly controlled
by Continental. The money will fund
exploratory drilling on the block.
CNPC will lend Continental development funds and carry Continental’s development costs, if any, in the amount
of $41.3 million above the earning
obligation. CNPC will pay Continental
a $3 million cash bonus contingent on
the first commercial oil or gas discovery
in the PSC.
The PSC is in the Tarakan basin,
where 15 fields with 349 wells have
produced more than 310 million bbl of
oil and 97 bcf of gas.

supply of jack ups will
expand more than 16%
by 2009, adding 61 jack
Drilling
ups now under construction, in addition to 3
delivered earlier this year.
Nearly two-thirds (39) are being
built in Southeast Asia, chiefly at Keppel
FELS, Jurong Shipyard Pte. Ltd., and PPL
Shipyard Pte. Ltd. in Singapore. Twelve
jack ups are being built on the US Gulf
coast, about 20% of the total. Yards in
China and United Arab Emirates are
each building 4 rigs, a yard in Indonesia is building 2, and India and Russia
are each building 1 (Table 1).
Most of these newbuilds will come
to market in 2007 (21 rigs) and 2008
(27 rigs).
Analysts have been concerned that an
increasing number of rigs built on spec,
without firm contracts, might flood the
market and drive down day rates. However, given the robust demand for modern, efficient units, it is unlikely that
there will be any softening of
contract pricing in 2007-08.
Many of the contractors have
announced contracts over the
last 6 months, while the jack
ups are still in early stages of
construction.
Some of the rigs are being sold by speculators to
drilling contractors, such as
A.P. Moeller-Maersk’s recent
$420-million purchase of
two Baker Marine Pacific
Class jack ups under con-

struction at the Jurong shipyard for

Matt Simmons, chairman of Simmons & Co. International, told attendees
at the Canadian Offshore Resources
Exhibition & Conference in Halifax on
Oct. 4 that the international offshore rig
fleet is too small, too old, and insufficient to drill the existing portfolio and
meet future needs. He stressed continuing attrition of older units and a dearth
of arctic-class rigs, and noted that two
jack ups will be leaving the Canadian
Maritimes in the next 6 months.
It seems likely that the newbuilds
will have only a small impact on the
market and that will probably not appear until first or second-quarter 2008,
in the middle of the surge.
Lately, many jack ups have been
moving to the Middle East for contracts.
Rigzone reports that about 18% of the
worldwide jack up fleet is working in
the Persian Gulf (73 rigs) and about 3%
(11 rigs) is working in the Red Sea.
Saudi Aramco announced in early
July that it had 101 rigs working, a
new record, including 16 jack ups. By

contribute to initiating AEAC.
For this reason, TETRA developed
a set of best practice guidelines and
procedures to help fluid suppliers,
transporting contractors, and operators
to ensure proper quality control of the
fluids. It says maintaining active quality
assurance and control throughout the
transportation cycle ensures that fluids
pumped into a well will have the same
specifications as ordered or designed.
The company determined that the
chemical effectiveness of the fluid can
be compromised when fluids are conveyed in lines or placed in trucks, workboats, or rig tanks that previously held a
fluid incompatible with the metallurgy
used in the well completion.
TETRA, therefore, designed a best
practices program that provides specific
guidelines and procedures for inspecting and cleaning trucks, tanks, lines,
and vessels to ascertain that the chemical integrity of the clear brine fluids has
been maintained.
For example, because the use of thiocyanate-containing corrosion inhibitors
is common in fluids used in non-CRA
applications, the company says it is
reasonable to assume that any vessel or
storage tank may be exposed routinely
to a reclaimed fluid containing the
thiocyanate ion or other contaminants.
As a consequence, small but significant amounts of residual thiocyanate

three ethylene plants and two polyethylene plants at Joffre, Alta. This case study
describes a DMCplus controller that was
commissioned at this plant.
The process separates two feed
streams into three components—a
light hydrocarbon and two considerably heavier hydrocarbons. The middle
component is removed in a side draw,
which is then further purified in a side

The solution, ProcessDoctor Online,
monitors applications and reports on
performance and diagnostic measures.
More importantly, it integrates with
plant maintenance business processes,
providing all interested parties with information needed for specific job functions in the applications’ maintenance
work processes.
It contains these best-practice functions:
• Benefit documentation.
• A holistic control asset-monitoring
and reporting platform.
• Targeted information.
• Flexible deployment.
• Compatibility with multiple controller technologies.
It allows plants with MPC applications to document their benefits and
automatically report the benefits to
senior managers. It provides continuous monitoring of MPC and regulatory
controls and instrumentation, can be
deployed on site, at corporate headquarters, or deployed as a service, and is
compatible with several different commercial MPC packages.
It also supports several monitoring
and diagnostic work flows. Monthly
reviews by managers, daily or weekly
monitoring by engineers, and longterm assessments by engineers to find
subtle patterns of behavior are all supported. This article will discuss the daily
monitoring and diagnostic work flow
shown in Fig. 1.
The work flow is intended to facilitate the standard investigations that engineers must perform in order to maintain MPC applications. It focuses on the
most common maintenance problems
with MPC controllers, and integrates the
investigation of MPC, regulatory control
and instrumentation.

indicate significant problems with the
models. The average model index of
0.59 for this controller indicates that
there are some models with significant
problems.

Daily analysis
Fig. 3 shows the impulse response
graph for the last day the DMC controller was active. It shows that the controller is slow relative to the desired, or
benchmark, performance. Disturbances,
models, poor regulatory control, or
constraint issues may cause this.
Low values for CV constraint violation (14.47%) and MV saturation
(12.53%) indicate that the controller is
not significantly affected by the active
constraint set, but the model index of
0.62 indicates some problems with the
models. The next step is to review the
CV details in the same report (Table 2)
to investigate the low model index.
Details for the CVs show that most
of the models are excellent, except for
three CVs: SMTDC044, SMTD080F, and
SMRIL2F. Of these, two have been disabled (service factor is equal to 0). The
third, SMTDC044, must be investigated.
The detail report for SMTDC044.PV
shows that the prediction error does
rise and fall with the value of the CV
itself. This is particularly clear at the
very end of the data set. Analysis of the
contributions to prediction error shows
that a feed-forward variable, SMTI042.
PV, is most likely causing the prediction
error. The model between SMTI042.PV
and SMTDC044.PV is the most likely
cause for the poor predictions (Fig. 4).
Further analysis of the average model
index during the month indicates
that models are excellent, with a few
exceptions. SMTD080F and SMTDC044
have consistently poor predictions, and
SMTC080F is marginal, with an average
model index of 0.66.
For all of these CVs, the manipulated
variable SMFCRFLX.SP is usually among
the MVs that correlate well with prediction error. While there are other MVs
that correlate with the prediction error,
SMFCRFLX, the column reflux, is likely
to be a dominant variable. The models
corresponding to this MV are therefore
suspicious and should be investigated to
see if they need to be reestimated.

• Increased throughput of the fluid

Drag reduction
In a pipeline, a fluid moves in one of
two types of flow: laminar or turbulent.
Laminar flow exists with no deviation
in velocity in the direction of flow, and
turbulent flow exists with local deviations in velocity relative to the bulk
flow of the fluid.
Crosscurrents and eddies cause the
velocity deviation in turbulent flow.
This causes the fluid molecules to move
randomly, wasting a significant portion
of the applied energy used to move the
fluid.1
Four major factors govern the flow
regime of a fluid in a pipeline: pipe
diameter, fluid density, fluid viscosity,
and the average velocity of the fluid. The
transition from laminar to turbulent
flow is governed by the dimensionless group called the Reynolds number
(NRe). The following equation calculates
the Reynolds number:
NRe = DVρ/μ
where: D = pipe diameter; V = average velocity of the fluid; ρ = density of
the fluid; and μ = viscosity of the fluid.
DRAs are only useful if a fluid is in

laminar flow increases linearly as flow
rate increases, but in turbulent flow, a
more significant increase in pressure
drop appears as flow rate increases.
Adding a DRA, however, can minimize the pressure drop of the same
fluid in a conduit at a given flow rate,
allowing it to be pumped with less
energy.

turbulent flow. A turbulent state typically corresponds to Reynolds numbers
greater than 4000. The greater the
Reynolds number, the higher the levels
of potential drag-reduction performance.
The Reynolds number is directly
proportional to diameter, velocity, and
density, but indirectly proportional to
fluid viscosity.

viscosity prediction formulas use the
simple-mixing-rule equation based on
calculations of the weighted average of
the component viscosities (Equation 1,
see accompanying box). This approach
is very straightforward and requires no
experimental viscosity determination of
crude oil blends.
The complex nature of crude oils,
however, renders such formulas ineffective and has led to numerous efforts
to develop viscosity models capable of
adequately predicting the viscosity of
crude oil blends. Most simple viscosity-mixing formulas do not involve any
viscous interaction term and can be
expressed by Equation 2.
Literature suggests many forms of
the viscosity function, f(µ).6-10 Choosing f(µ) = lgµ transforms Equation 2
into the Arrhenius model (Equation 3).6
Viscosity function f(µ) may also
serve as the cube root equation of viscosity, as in the Kendall-Monroe model
(Equation 4),7 the reciprocal viscosity6 8
(Equation 5), double-log term9 (Equation 6), and the more complex Cragoe
model (Equation 7).10
The viscosity functions, however,
often do not obey the linear weighting
rule described in Equations 3-7, necessitating further modifications to nonlinearity. Fig. 1 illustrates this deviation for

the Arrhenius model.
Based on the Arrhenius model, Lederer developed a correlation (Equation
8) for predicting the viscosities of heavy
petroleum oil with light petroleum solvent mixtures.11 For the limiting value
of α = 1,the logarithm of the mixture
viscosity equals the volumetric fraction
of heavy oil times the logarithm of the
heavy oil viscosity, plus the volumetric
62

(17)

fraction of the solvent times the logarithm of the solvent viscosity.
These volumetric fractions are unbiased. But for a value of α lower than 1,
the volumetric fraction is biased toward
the solvent, and the limiting value of 0
provides a mixture viscosity identical to
the solvent viscosity.
Rhames and Nelson examined this
equation for mixtures with low viscos-

ity ratios, defined as (µ1/µ2), and found
this functional expression provided an
excellent fit for their data.6 Shu used the
same functional expression for mixtures
of high-viscosity ratios typical of bitumen and solvent fractions, and correlated the parameter with characteristic
properties of the individual mixture
components, including the viscosity
ratio and the densities of solvent and oil

Polyguard RD-6TM Pipeline Coating System

Got Pipeline Responsibilities ? ?
If you have pipeline responsibilities, it is important that you know about cathodic shielding.

Can you define “shielding”?
Why the need to know?

“Materials and construction practices that create electrical shielding
should not be used on the pipeline.”
NACE Standard RPO169-2002, Control of External Corrosion on Underground or Submerged Metallic Piping Systems

The NACE standard (page 3) defines shielding:

“Shielding: Preventing or diverting the cathodic protection current from its intended path.”

Coatings with solid film backing are proven to shield. That is why shrink sleeves and solid film backed tapes have lost
favor with pipeline operators in North America. High resistivity of film backings “hides” corrosion activity from cathodic
protection currents.
First, the Pipeline Research Council reported(1) that both corrosion and SCC were; “..enhanced by cathodic shielding at
the disbonded areas..” by solid polyethylene film backed tapes. In the mid 1990’s, Canada’s National Energy Board
concluded that solid film back tapes contributed to an outbreak of SCC failures because of shielding.
Although usage of solid film back tapes and shrink sleeves has declined in North America, both are still broadly specified
elsewhere in the world.
FBE and Polyguard RD-6 are “fail / safe” coatings. This means that they have been proven to allow passage of protective
currents to reach disbonded areas with corrosion potential. Once there, the current raises the pH of the water to 9 or more,
a level which significantly reduces corrosion.

POLYGUARD RD-6 COATING HAS BEEN USED OVER 18 YEARS ON THOUSANDS OF
PROJECTS. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, NEITHER EXTERNAL CORROSION NOR SCC HAS
BEEN A PROBLEM UNDER RD-6. WHY? BECAUSE RD-6 IS “FAIL/SAFE”.
We don’t have space here to show you the evidence, but we invite you to our website to review both external and internal
testing. Or, call us at 214.515.5000.

Who said crude
wouldn’t drop
below $60/bbl?
Here’s an assignment for anyone who
has at any time this year declared that the
price of crude oil would never again fall
below $60/bbl.
Find a legal pad and a pencil, and write
this sentence 500 times: Oil prices can’t
rise forever.
If the statement still seems questionable, write it 500 times again.
The price of West Texas Intermediate

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s

crude fell below $60/bbl last week after
reaching $75/bbl at times in July and
August.
Suddenly, instead of asking how high
the crude price might go, people are wondering about the bottom.
Does a 20% price drop in 2 months’ time
constitute a collapse? If not, it’s certainly
the grad-school version of what economists
refer to as “a correction.”
Whatever you call it, the price drop
should surprise no one.
A coincidence of extraordinary inﬂuences elevated crude prices earlier this
year: low levels of idle production capacity,
failure of production outside the Organization of Petroleum Countries to come on
stream as expected, unusual strains in key
product markets, geopolitical pressures,
hurricane fears.
Several of those pressures have eased.
And demand has relaxed seasonally in the
US and other important markets. Prices are
dropping. What else can they do?
So where’s the ﬂoor? The answer to that
question depends on two forces.
One of them is demand, which has
wobbled under the weight of high prices
but still has structural support from
economic development in Asia and India
and developed-world prosperity. The other
critical force is the unpredictable price that
elicits real production cuts, as opposed to
talk about the subject, from OPEC’s most
important producers. That price will be the
level at which revenues from unadjusted
production become too low to sustain
national budgets.
So there is a ﬂoor, and it’s probably
higher than the ﬂoor level of the last price
collapse—or correction, as the case may be.
Maybe it’s much higher.
But for anyone who risked money on
the proposition that the crude price would
never again fall below $60/bbl, the difference between a ﬂoor of $40/bbl and one
of, say, $30/bbl might now not matter very
much.

Crude prices dip below $59/bbl
The November contract for benchmark US light, sweet crudes fell $2.35 to $58.68/
bbl Oct. 3, the lowest front-month closing on the New York Mercantile Exchange
since Feb. 16. But oil prices rallied upon reports that oil exporters informally agreed
to cut production.
The Oct. 5 Financial Times reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries informally plans to cut production by at least 1 million b/d, or at least 4%.
An OPEC spokesman said most member nations support a voluntary reduction,
and that the change could be ratiﬁed during the cartel’s scheduled Dec. 14 meeting
in Abuja, Nigeria. “OPEC is going to defend a price ﬂoor for its oil of $50-55/bbl,” FT
reported an OPEC spokesman as saying.
But OPEC’s president denied reports of an informal agreement. Edmund Daukoru,
Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president, told the Wall Street Journal, “We are toying with the idea of an emergency meeting. We will have to agree on how much,
how soon, and how we distribute it among the member countries.” Daukoru said cartel members would not agree to a formal cut in production quotas until after OPEC
had met. The production quota for OPEC, excluding Iraq, is 28 million b/d.
OPEC produced 27.7 million b/d in August, the US Energy Information Administration said. Iraq produced 2.2 million b/d in August but was not part of the quota.
Until the FT report, the markets appeared unconcerned about oil supply. Earlier
in the week, traders showed little reaction to announcements that Nigeria cut oil
production by 120,000 b/d and Venezuela by 50,000 b/d, effective Oct. 1.
The voluntary reductions in Nigeria and Venezuela’s production represented less
than 1% of OPEC supply, and oil prices continued to decline despite those production cuts. Venezuela President Hugo Chavez suggested an “appropriate” oil price
would be $50-60/bbl.
Analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc. said frontmonth crude oil futures plunged more than 20% in just over 2 months. They cited an
all-time closing high of $77.03 on July 14.
In both dollars and percentages, the overall fall of crude prices since July 14
marked the steepest sustained decline since late 2004 when oil fell to levels around
$40/bbl from $55/bbl, RJA analysts said. “Recognizing that oil in [the fourth quarter]
is likely to average below our $68/bbl forecast, we lowered it [on Sept. 25] to $62, but
we again reafﬁrm our conﬁdence in our $70 forecast for 2007,” RJA said.
Barclays Capital Inc. analyst Paul Horsnell foresses a “drawn-out stabilization”
of oil markets. “We suggest that the best template for current circumstances is the
experience of 2001-02,” Horsnell said. And [we] see the path as being determined by
ﬁve main aspects: perceptions on the US economy, the global economy, non-OPEC
supply, OPEC policy, and Iran.”
Natural gas
Natural gas prices on Oct. 5 marked a 5-week high, gaining 30.3¢ to close at
$6.298/MMbtu on the NYMEX.
EIA reported a 73 bcf gas storage injection for the week ended Sept. 29 compared
with a 77 bcf injection for the previous week, a 44 bcf injection last year, and the 5year average injection of 68 bcf.
The year-over-year storage surplus rose to 398 bcf, and the 5-year average storage surplus increased to 366 bcf. Supplies are now at 3.3 tcf vs. 2.9 tcf last year.
Ronald J. Barone, UBS Securities LLC managing director, expects that EIA will
report a 70-80 bcf injection into storage for the week ended Oct. 6. “Given current
weather forecasts and year-earlier injection comparisons, we expect the year-overyear surplus will be in the 400-425 bcf range by the middle of October.”
The EIA weekly inventory report showed an increase in US fuel stockpiles, which
was what traders had expected. On Oct. 4, EIA reported commercial US crude inventories rose by 3.3 million bbl to 328.1 million bbl during the week ended Sept. 29.
Gasoline stocks increased by 1.2 million bbl to 215.1 million bbl during the same
period. Distillate fuel inventories rose by 200,000 bbl to 151.5 million bbl.
Imports of crude into the US averaged 10.5 million b/d, down 570,000 b/d from
the previous week. During the last 4 weeks, crude oil imports have averaged 10.7
million b/d. Input of crude into US reﬁneries declined by 573,000 b/d to 15.3 million
b/d, with reﬁneries operating at 89.9% of capacity.
Gasoline production dropped, averaging 8.9 million b/d while distillate fuel production fell slightly, averaging nearly 4.2 million b/d.

Thinking to the future:
- Committing more than $300 million each
year on clean and renewable energies
Finding even more energy today:
- In 2004, achieved exploration
record 78% higher than 10-year
industry average
- Using steamflooding to extract
heavy oil that was previously
unrecoverable — more than 1.3
billion barrels from one field alone

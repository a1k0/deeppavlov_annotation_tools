COVER
The BW Cidade de Sao Vicente floating production, storage, and
offloading vessel pictured on the cover ran extended production tests
of the first two wells drilled in the exciting presalt play in 2,170
m of water on Block BM-S-11, 280 km off Rio de Janeiro. Production from that discovery by Brazil’s national oil company will
likely put Petroleo Brasileiro SA among the world’s top 5 integrated oil companies within a decade, say company officials. Since they
control 90% of the world’s oil resources, NOCs are a major factor
in the global oil market. Some like Petrobras are expanding operations beyond their borders. Some like Petroleos Mexicanos struggle
with depleting resources. And some like Petroleos de Venezuela SA
become the focus of political ambitions and confrontations. NOCs
face special challenges functioning as a government agency while at
the same time competing as oil companies in a world market. OGJ
takes a look at these and other NOCs in a series of articles starting on p. 18.

Court lets MMS sales outside Alaska proceed
A federal appeals court clarified its order vacating the current
federal offshore oil and gas leasing program on July 28 by saying
that the ruling applies only to the Alaska portion of the plan.
The action clears the way for the US Minerals Management Service to proceed with lease sales on other areas of the Outer Continental Shelf. “We are moving forward with the planned Aug. 19
Gulf of Mexico lease sale,” US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said
on July 29.
He sought the clarification on May 11 after the US District
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia decided on Apr. 17
that the Bush administration did not use sound science when it
expanded leasing areas in the Beaufort, Bering, and Chukchi seas
for the 2007-12 OCS plan. It issued an order vacating the program
and ordered a rewrite after more thorough studies had been conducted.
Through the US Department of Justice, Salazar asked the court
to clarify that the order applied only to the Alaskan parts of the
5-year plan, and that sales in other areas could proceed. The American Petroleum Institute also sought a similar clarification.
The new order stated that relief granted in the Apr. 17 opinion
applied only to Alaska, “specifically leasing in the Chukchi, Beaufort, and Bering seas.”
Salazar said, “I am pleased with the court’s decision. With respect to the Arctic Ocean and Alaska, we will continue to work
expeditiously to address the environmental issues identified by the
court in the existing 2007-12 5-year plan.”
In a July 29 statement, API encouraged DOI “to move quickly to
redo the environmental sensitivity analysis and maintain all scheduled past and future leasing in Alaska so that exploration and production activity and future leases sales under the 2007-12 plan can
take place in that state.”

ICE agrees to be regulated after CFTC ruling
The InterContinental Exchange (ICE) agreed to be regulated
after the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) effectively ruled that one of ICE’s natural gas contracts should no
longer be exempt.
The ruling came July 24 when CFTC, using new authority to apply regulatory and reporting requirements to exempt commercial
markets with significant price discovery functions, ruled that ICE’s
Henry Financial LD1 Fixed Price Contract fit that description.
ICE declared itself a registered CFTC entity on July 27 and announced that it would begin submitting enhanced market statistics
for its cash-settled Henry Hub gas swap market to the commission
immediately. It said that clearing firms will begin providing large
insider trading data to the CFTC, that ICE’s data will be incorpo-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

rated in the commission’s weekly Commitment of Traders Report,
and that the Henry Hub swap will be subject to position limits and
accountability levels.
CFTC announced on June 9 that it would review the contract
to determine whether it performed a significant price discovery
function and should no longer be exempt, exercising authority
for the first time which it received when the 2008 farm bill became law.
It based its July 24 decision on further analysis of the contract
and its characteristics, including its high average daily trading volume, its reliance on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s physically
delivered gas futures contract, and trader usage of the ICE contract’s
prices.
With clear indications that the ICE contract satisfied these three
conditions, the commission did not analyze possible material price
reference and consequently reached no conclusion on this fourth
qualifying condition, CFTC said.
ICE noted that it has worked with CFTC since October 2006 in
developing regular over-the-counter market reporting, including
large trader information.
“We appreciate the CFTC’s use of its broad powers in the OTC
markets to provide regulatory certainty and to underscore the integrity of these important contracts,” said Jeffrey C. Sprecher, the
exchange’s chairman and chief executive.

NARUC backs regulation of hydraulic fracturing
State utility regulators approved a resolution at their summer
convention in Seattle urging Congress to leave regulation of hydraulic fracturing to the states.
The resolution by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners’ gas committee said the organization “has observed with great concern the current debate in Congress over the
appropriate method for regulating the use of hydraulic fracturing
to complete oil and gas wells.”
US Reps. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) and Maurice D. Hinchey (DNY) introduced a bill on June 4 which would bring the process,
which is used to recover gas from shale formations, under the Safe
Drinking Water Act. US Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) introduced
similar legislation in the Senate the same day.
Doing so, NARUC’s resolution said, “would add burdensome
and unnecessary regulatory requirements to the drilling and completion of oil and gas wells, thereby increasing costs of producing domestic natural gas resources without any ancillary benefit to
public health, safety, or the environment.”
The resulting increased cost of producing domestic gas resources would reduce domestic supplies; raise costs to consumers; raise
utility prices for consumers; reduce tax and royalty revenue for local, state and federal governments; and increase US dependence on

ECA presses Pennsylvania Marcellus work

A group led by Anadarko Petroleum Corp. said the Vito exploration well cut more than 250 net ft of oil pay in subsalt Miocene
sands and plans to drill two other prospects along trend in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Vito went to 32,000 ft in 4,038 ft of water 170 miles southsoutheast of New Orleans in Mississippi Canyon Block 984. The
partners will evaluate data from Vito and set the timing for an appraisal well.
Anadarko plans to drill its Haleakala prospect to the west and
Silverado to the east in 2010. Both target similar subsalt Miocene
objectives.
Anadarko will move the Noble Amos Runner semisubmersible
to the Caesar/Tonga development in the Green Canyon area.
Anadarko operates Vito with 20% working interest. Shell Offshore Inc. owns 55%, and StatoilHydro USA E&P Inc. has 25%.
Shell will become Vito operator after the rig is released.

Energy Corp. of America, a private Charleston, W.Va., operator,
is developing gas production from Devonian Marcellus shale in
Greene County in the southwest corner of Pennsylvania.
In May, the company began a 3-year program to develop 10,000
acres it holds in the county. It is producing 8 MMcfd of gas from
wells completed only in the Marcellus and more than 15 MMcfd
from vertical wells in which it has commingled Marcellus gas with
output from other formations.
Two rigs are drilling horizontal wells to the Marcellus, which
lies at about 8,000 ft true vertical depth in Greene County. The
company holds more than 1 million acres in the Appalachian basin
on which the Marcellus varies in depth from 3,000 ft to 8,000 ft.
ECA has drilled 155 Marcellus vertical and horizontal Marcellus wells, and initial potentials of the completed wells have ranged
from 500 Mcfd to 3 MMcfd. The wells produce little condensate.
ECA drilled one of the first horizontal wells in Greene County

Cabot nails vertical Marcellus-Purcell interval
Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., Houston, is producing 39 MMcfd of
Marcellus shale gas from seven horizontal and 20 vertical wells in
northeastern Pennsylvania, where it notched a critical success with
one of its latest vertical completions.
Cumulative recovery is 5.8 bcf since the company’s first Marcellus well came on line a year ago in Susquehanna County.
A ninth rig is preparing to spud, and 18 more horizontal wells
are to be drilled this year. Three other wells are completing, and 12
are waiting on completion or pipeline hookup.
The most recent horizontal completion, Teel-8H, flowed at an
initial 10.3 MMcfd with a maximum spot rate of 12 MMcfd, and
its 30-day average is 9.8 MMcfd.
The vertical Teel-6 had initial flow of 4.2 MMcfd from 370 ft

of lower and upper Marcellus, and Cabot believes the stimulation
contacted most of that interval including the gassy Purcell limestone that separates them.
Cabot called Teel-6 “a critical event in the development of our
Marcellus acreage” because the size and shape of its individual leases on its large acreage block limit much of the drilling to vertical
wells.
The $1.4 million well is also the first at which the company
stimulated the entire column, whereas it has fract its horizontal
wells entirely in the lower Marcellus and only slightly in the curved
section has it treated the upper Marcellus.
Cabot is hiking takeaway capacity at its Teel compression station
to 70 MMcfd on Aug. 1 and 100 MMcfd a year later. ✦

Production

Tuned water may improve Saudi waterﬂooding
Minimal chemical alteration to injection water may help increase oil recovery, researchers at Saudi Aramco’s EXPEC Advanced
Research Center say.
“If the current lab results are demonstrated in the field, it will
change the way we conduct waterflooding in the company,” said
Amin H. Nasser, senior vice-president of exploration and producing for Aramco. “The application of this approach will not be limited to mature fields but also to fields in early development stages.”
At the laboratory scale, early tests indicate significant incremental oil recovery from Arab-D carbonate reservoirs, the company
says.
Aramco’s main seawater treatment facility, Qurayyah, processes
millions of barrels per day of water for injection into the giant
Ghawar and Khurais oil fields.
The research focuses on optimizing water properties such as
salinity and ionic interactions without adding foreign fluids or
chemicals.
“This research seems to have changed our perception of waterflooding from being a mere physical process—increasing reservoir energy and sweeping oil toward producers—to one that also
entails chemical interactions between reservoir fluids and rocks,”
said Mohammed Y. Al-Qahtani, executive director of petroleum engineering and development for Aramco.

Indonesia wants lower cost-recovery write-offs
Members of Indonesia’s House of Representatives, in a move to
head off a potential budget shortfall, have urged the government’s
upstream watchdog BPMigas to reduce the cost recovery given to
oil and gas contractors.
“For now, BPMigas should limit the amount of cost recovery,”
to $10 billion from $11.05 billion said Suharso Manoarfa, vicechairman of the House’s budget committee, in a hearing with the
government and the central bank.
The move aims to decrease the budget deficit in case the Indonesian Crude Price (ICP) falls to $58/bbl at yearend or oil lifting
is lower than the 960,000 b/d level set in the planned revision of
the 2009 budget.
“If the ICP is $58/bbl [during this year’s second half], there

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

will be a 9 trillion rupiah deficit in state revenue,” said Suharso,
who also noted that during January-June, oil production reached
953,000 b/d and will need to reach 967,000 b/d for the remainder of the year to achieve the government target of 960,000 b/d
for 2009.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said she would ask the
energy and mineral resources ministry to balance the amount of
cost recovery spent and the amount of oil sold in order to prevent
a negative net income in oil and gas revenue.
In April, the Indonesian government drafted new rules aimed
at reducing national expenditure by redefining some cost components as downstream instead of upstream.
At the time, Indonesia’s energy and mineral resources minister
Purnomo Yusgiantoro said, “We hope that this will decrease spending on cost recovery in our state budget (OGJ, Apr 27, 2009, p.
37).

Shell orders pumps for St. Joseph ﬁeld off Sabah
Shell Malaysia Exploration & Production BV placed an $8 million order for Flowserve Corp. barrel-type injection pumps for its
waterflood development in St. Joseph field, off Sabah.
Shell operates St. Joseph field under the North Sabah 1996 production-sharing contract with coventurer Petronas.
Shell expects water injection to start in 2010, according to a
presentation to the International Petroleum Technology Conference, Kuala Lumpur, Dec. 3-5, 2008.
The presentation, “St. Joseph Field Waterflood Project: Fractured
Water Injection Using Smart Well Technology,” by Darryl Harris,
Nicolette G. Du Rieu, and Keith Ian Rollett of Sarawak Shell Bhd.,
describes St. Joseph as a mature oil field that has been on production since 1981, with gas injection starting in 1996.
It says the scope of the waterflood development includes installation of a new offshore living quarters platform and seawater
treatment and injection facilities plus drilling of six horizontal water injection wells and five infill wells.
The presentation says that the flood will involve the injection of
treated seawater at a rate of 60,000 bw/d into a laminated reservoir with historical problems of controlling water and gas breakthrough through high permeability streaks.

Europe’s LNG imports for July, August to set mark
LNG shipments to Europe will increase by more than 40% in
July and August, according to the latest edition of European LNG
Report from market analysis firm Waterborne, Houston. This development, says Waterborne, will continue to depress natural gas
prices on the continent. “We are adjusting our forecast numbers
upward for European LNG imports in July and August based on
strong import growth expected in the UK and Belgium,” says Steve
Johnson, Waterborne president.
Under shipment scenarios devised by Waterborne, total European LNG imports for July will exceed 4.5 million tonnes, setting a
record for 1-month imports and representing a 40% increase over
July 2008. For August, total European imports will reach nearly 4.2
million tonnes, a 45% jump over the same month last year.
Shipments to Spain will lead European importing countries in
both months, reaching more than 1.8 million tonnes in July and
more than 1.6 million tonnes in August, according to Waterborne.
France will import 804,000 tonnes in July and 844,000 tonnes in
August.
The UK will receive 732,000 tonnes of LNG in July followed
in Augsut by 552,000 tonnes. Dragon LNG’s terminal at Milford
Haven, Wales, received its first commissioning cargo on July 14,
weeks earlier than expected. “We are also projecting increased LNG
shipments from Qatar into Milford Haven’s South Hook terminal,
which opened in May,” says Johnson.
The July edition of the European Waterborne LNG Report looks
at the effect of the Medgaz pipeline on Europe’s LNG markets, if
planned, new pipeline connections are built across the Pyrenees.

Woodside opts for Broome support base
Woodside Energy Ltd., Perth, has signed an option agreement
with the Broome Port Authority to lease 15 hectares of land as a

Woodside has an option period of 3 years in which to execute
the minimum 25-year lease.
The Browse fields include Torosa, Brecknock, and Calliance,

which lie about 425 km north of Broome. Combined contingent
resources are estimated at 14 tcf of dry gas and 370 million bbl
of condensate. Woodside is still considering the type of facilities it
will need to develop the field and where they will be located.

Santos issues FEED contract for Gladstone LNG
Santos Ltd., Adelaide, has issued a contract to Fluor Corp. for
the front-end engineering and design of Santos’s Gladstone LNG
coalseam gas project in Queensland.
When completed, Gladstone LNG will produce 3-4 million
tonnes/year of LNG from a gas supply of about 5.4-7 million cu
m/year from Santos-operated coalseam gas fields in Queensland’s
Bowen and Surat basins.
The scope of the work for this contract, according to Fluor,
includes preparation of an execution plan and cost estimate for
engineering, procurement, and construction of upstream facilities
required to deliver coalseam gas from Santos-operated, coalseam
gas fields in central Queensland to the proposed Gladstone liquefaction plant near Gladstone. As operator of Gladstone, Santos has a
60% share of the project.
Malaysian state oil company Petronas holds 40% (OGJ Online,
June 18, 2009). The joint venture will develop and operate the
435-km gas pipeline to Gladstone and the LNG liquefaction plant
on Curtis Island at Gladstone.

Reward for help solving Dawson Creek bombings
EnCana Corp., Calgary, has doubled its reward offer to $1 million for help in solving six bombings of its natural gas facilities in
the Tomslake area near Dawson Creek, BC.
The company says the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is investigating the six bombings that occurred between October 2008
and July 2009 at three pipeline locations, a metering shed on an
EnCana wellsite, and two wellheads.
The most recent attack on a wellhead occurred on July 1 and
took 4 days to bring under control, EnCana says. ✦

the cover photo of a Gorilla jack up
rig caught the eye of a general who
thought the unit would make a grand

Rowan executives were receptive to
the idea since drilling was in an even
bigger slump back then than now. The
Air Force’s idea was to erect a 5 million
lb rocket over the rig’s moon pool in
the Vandenberg harbor and then tow
the rig out beyond the 3-mile limit of
California’s offshore authority. There the
rig would set up as it would at a drilling site; the rocket would be readied
and fired by remote control from Vandenberg’s onshore launch command.
Air Force officers toured jack ups
to assess the feasibility of using them
for offshore launches. It was estimated
then a jack up launch platform could be
custom-built for $100 million, compared with $3.3 billion for one Vandenberg launch pad that was never used.
Nothing came of the plan, however. In
time the market improved, and Rowan’s
rigs went back to work.
In 1999, however, Sea Launch Co.
LLC—a consortium of US, Russian,
Ukrainian, and Norwegian investors—
began launching satellites for commercial customers from the converted semisubmersible Ocean Odyssey. The Long
Beach, Calif.-based company says it has
made 31 launches from an equatorial
position in the Pacific Ocean. In June,
however, it filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. ✦

Enriching a muted discussion
Three recent developments—one scientific and
two polemic—should enrich discussion about human activity and climate change. In popular media
and much of government, however, no such discussion exists. That this is so provides more cause for
fear than does whatever global warming may result
from the use of fossil energy.
The scientific development is publication of a
paper in the American Geophysical Union’s Journal
of Geophysical Research suggesting that nonhuman
influences account for most observed warming over
the past 50 years. Australian researchers J.D. McLean
of Applied Science Consultants, C.R. de Freitas of
the University of Aukland, and R.M. Carter of James
Cook University found a close relationship, with a
5-7 month delay, between the Southern OscillationEl Nino phenomenon and two temperature records
covering 1950-2008 and 1980-2008.
“Overall the results suggest that the Southern
Oscillation exercises a consistently dominant influence on mean global temperature, with a maximum
effect in the tropics, except for periods when equatorial volcanism causes ad hoc cooling,” the researchers write in an abstract. The relationship “shows the
potential of natural forcing mechanisms to account
for most of the temperature variation.”

Squelching doubt
According to another development, the researchers should expect trouble. In a paper entitled “Climate Money” published by the Scientific & Public
Policy Institute, Washington, DC, Australian science
writer Joanne Nova describes a well-funded political
mechanism dedicated to squelching doubt about the
need for urgent warming responses.
“The large expenditure in search of a connection
between carbon and climate creates enormous momentum and a powerful set of vested interests,” Nova
writes, asserting that the US government has spent
more than $79 billion since 1989 on policies related
to climate change. A paucity of funds and sometimes
abusive resistance await those who question the
carbon-climate link. “In this scientific debate,” she
argues, “one side is gagged while the other side has a
government-funded media campaign.”
The existence of this public-relations snare is
nothing new. Massachusetts Institute of Technology
climatologist Richard Lindzen is among scientists
who have complained about it (OGJ, Apr. 24, 2006,
p. 19). With the US Congress deliberating cap-and16

trade legislation with potential to overhaul US economic patterns, however, concern about the quality
of debate seems hugely in order.
The third development is a triumph of packaging: a brochure published by the George C. Marshall
Institute entitled “The Cocktail Conversation Guide to
Global Warming.” While breaking no new argumentative ground, the brochure cleverly compresses into
one place several vital points that too seldom receive
attention.
It notes, for example, that the ballyhooed “scientific consensus” is a mischaracterization of summaries
written by government appointees of complex scientific reports produced every 5 years by the United
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). “These summaries leave out the assumptions
and uncertainties contained in the longer assessment
reports,” the brochure says.
The brochure also raises questions about warming
assumptions fundamental to the politics of behaviorchanging response. Although emissions of greenhouse gases increased in the last half of the 20th
century, global surface temperatures haven’t risen
since about 1998. And ocean temperatures, which
may more accurately represent planetary conditions,
have been monitored systematically only recently and
show little, if any, recent warming.

Unanswered question
And how many people know how little warming can be directly attributable to the relatively slight
human contribution to all carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere? The brochure notes that the potential for
troublesome warming depends on amplification of
CO2–induced warming by related changes in cloud
cover and water vapor. IPCC computer models all
assume strong secondary warming from decreased
cloud cover and increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Yet various physical observations suggest that
net cloud and water-vapor changes might, on balance, have the opposite effect.
In fact, the Marshall Institute brochure calls uncertainty about cloud and water-vapor feedbacks “the
most important question in global warming research
today.” Yet the popular wisdom is that the science is
“settled,” the debate over. And a determined effort
remains in progress to raise energy costs painfully
before a muted discussion can raise any more contrary questions. ✦

National oil companies control the
vast majority of the world’s oil reserves,
produce most of the planet’s crude, and
own much of the oil and gas infrastructure, which makes them major forces in
the industry.
But while competing as oil companies globally, NOCs face special challenges locally as agents of their governments with obligations to serve the
needs
of their
nations.
Some are
successfully expanding
operations beyond their borders. Some are
struggling with depleting resources.
And some have become the focus of
political ambitions and the center of
confrontations.
Mexico’s Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Venezuela’s Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), and Brazil’s Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) are certainly

Pemex, PDVSA, Petrobras:
how strategies, results differ

the most talked-about and likely the
most influential NOCs in the Western Hemisphere—each for different
reasons.
Pemex and PDVSA are among the
five largest suppliers of crude to the
US. Petrobras has expanded around
the world to meet the needs of its own
18

huge market, the Western Hemisphere’s
third largest. Its prolific presalt discoveries off Brazil have the potential to lift
it into the top echelons of integrated
companies.
The contrasting histories, conditions,
and directions of Pemex, PDVSA, and
Petrobras illustrate the wide range of
strategies that NOCs follow in response
to their unique combinations of competitive and political pressures—and the
full range of successes and failures.

Pemex struggles
Pemex is sole producer of crude,
natural gas, and petroleum products in
Mexico and the country’s most important company. It is the biggest enterprise in Mexico, the biggest source of
income for the Mexican government,
and the third largest exporter of crude
to the US, behind Canada and Saudi
Arabia.
Once it was the model for other
Latin American NOCs trying to develop
their own resources. But Pemex’s crude
production has fallen for years due to
“steep decline rates from maturing oil
fields (mainly Cantarell field), a lack
of foreign investment, and a high tax
burden on Pemex,” said analysts in the
Houston office of Raymond James &
Associates Inc. The decline is so bad,
they said, “Mexico may become an oil
importer within the next 5 years.”
Pemex’s reserve replacement rates
rank near the bottom and its costs near
the top among NOCs. Its development
of gas reserves appears to be stalled.
And it is in dire need of technology to
explore ultradeep waters of the Gulf
of Mexico and of a large infusion of
money to fund exploration and development. Yet Mexico appears determined
to maintain its constitutional ban on
foreign ownership of natural resources.
“Mexico is effectively closed to foreign investment. This inhibits the interchange of differing geotechnical ideas
and denies Mexico sufficient risk capital
to fully exploit its oil and gas resource,”
said Andrew B. Derman, partner and
leader of international energy practice

at Thompson & Knight LLP in Dallas.
“Given Mexico’s proximity to the US, it
could be one of the hottest oil and gas
plays on the planet. One would think
that Mexico would exploit its resources
now when there is a demand. Mexico
may discover that exploitation mañana
is not nearly as profitable.”
Michael C. Lynch, president, Strategic Energy & Economic Research Inc.,
differs from the generally pessimistic
consensus on Mexico. “I think Mexico
will probably surprise many,” he said.
Lynch said, “[Pemex’s] first need has
been capital; the government has a long
tendency to starve them of money, and
only recently has this been reversed.
Mexican drilling activity is twice what
it was a couple of years ago, and they
have a lot of medium-sized fields that
could make a serious contribution. (The
decline in rigs rates has helped them,
but the peso decline offset that somewhat). Deregulation and outside investment would certainly help, but capital is
the main thing.”

Pemex production
At the start of this year, Pemex
claimed proved reserves of 14.3 billion boe of oil and gas, including 10.2
billion boe developed. It also had 14.5
billion boe of probable reserves and
14.7 billion boe possible. Proved gas
reserves were 17.6 tcf, including 11.5
tcf of associated gas. Proved, probable,
and possible gas reserves totaled 60.4
tcf. The largest concentration of reserves
is offshore, primarily in the Campeche
basin, where tropical storms and hurricanes sometimes disrupt operations.
Pemex’s production dropped to 2.8
million b/d in 2008 from 3 million
in 2007. Two thirds of its production
is heavy Maya crude that averages 22°
gravity and 3.5-4% sulfur content.
Pemex retains its lighter crude for domestic consumption and exports Maya
production to the US. Last year exports
were down 16.8% to 1.4 million b/d
of crude, with 1.2 million b/d going to
the US.
From 2004-07, Mexico was the
second-largest oil supplier to the US,

but fell to third in 2008 behind Canada
and Saudi Arabia. Proximity of the US
market and the sophistication of US
refineries will continue to attract most
of Mexico’s oil exports, according to
analysts at the US Energy Information
Administration.
Production from Cantarell—once
Mexico’s biggest oil field and among
the international giants—slipped below
700,000 b/d in May from peak production of 2.1 million b/d in 2004.
“The death of Cantarell has been
much discussed,” said oil analyst and
investor Gregor Macdonald. However,
he said, “What’s less recognized is that
the toppling of Cantarell has absolutely
shattered Mexico’s effort to halt the
decline of oil exports.”
Ku Maloob Zaap (KMZ) adjacent to
Cantarell in the Gulf of Campeche is
the largest source of new production
growth. It recently overtook Cantarell as
Mexico’s biggest producer, with record
output of 814,000 b/d in April. The
KMZ complex produced 740,000 b/d
of crude in 2008, up from 550,700
b/d in 2007. Production has doubled in
the last 3 years with a nitrogen reinjection program similar to one at Cantarell.
Pemex expects KMZ production to peak
at 820,000 b/d before declining to
810,000 b/d next year.
Pemex is investing heavily in KMZ
to offset Cantarell’s decline. The field
contains 18% of Mexico’s non-Cantarell
proved reserves. However, KMZ crude is
heavier than Maya crude. Analysts report
Pemex documents show KMZ’s oil quality and production are falling due to
encroachment of water and salt.
Some 20% of Pemex production is
from onshore fields. The largest in the
south, Puerto Ceiba, produced 50,000
b/d in 2008. The largest in the north is
Arenque (10,000 b/d in 2008).

plans to invest $11 billion over the
next 4 years at Chicontepec. It currently
produces 30,000 b/d, but Pemex hopes
to increase production to 700,000 b/d
by 2017. Pemex estimates Chicontepec
contains possible reserves of 17.7 billion boe.
Most Chicontepec crude is heavy,
some as heavy as 18° gravity. The reservoir is highly fractured and at low pressure, and the region lacks infrastructure for large-scale development. Low
permeability makes extraction difficult.
On top of that, some analysts suggest
Pemex systematically exaggerates the
recoverable oil in the basin.
Many industry observers believe
Mexico’s oil production has peaked and
will continue to decline. In March, EIA
forecast Mexico will produce 2.9 million b/d of oil in 2009 and 2.7 million
b/d in 2010. Last year Mexico enacted
legislation to reform its oil industry so
Pemex could better curb the production
decline. The reform permits Pemex to
create incentive-based service contracts
with private companies. Pemex received
greater autonomy under the reforms,
including the ability to issue its own
debt and establish more flexible mechanisms for procurement and investment.
Mexico opened its downstream gas
industry to private operators in 1995
but prohibits any company from participating in more than one function
(transportation, storage, or distribution). Gas consumption has increased
for domestic power generation to free
up oil for export. But Mexico is a net
importer of gas, and increased consumption means increased imports
from the US or via LNG.

Venezuela has 99 billion bbl of
proved oil reserves, the largest in South
America (OGJ, Dec. 22, 2008, p. 20). Its
gas reserves are 171 tcf.
In the 1990s, Venezuela increased
opportunities for foreign and domestic
oil companies under operating service
contracts with PDVSA, granting operating rights to private-sector companies
in selected fields with a cash fee paid
per barrel of oil produced and delivered
to PDVSA.
After President Hugo Chavez took
office, however, he began raising taxes
and royalties. Under threat of total
nationalization, he forced companies to
convert their operating service contracts into joint ventures with PDVSA as
senior partner.
In 2002, nearly half of PDVSA’s
employees walked off the job in protest
against Chavez’s administration. But
they lost the months-long strike, and
Chavez fired 18,000 PDVSA workers.
That, said critics, drained the company
of technical knowledge and expertise.
Industry analysts speculate the strike
caused permanent damage to PDVSA’s
production capacity.
Labor troubles are again bubbling
in PDVSA. Dissident union leaders say
many of the 100,000 workers employed by PDVSA and some contractors
are disgruntled about overdue pay, a
6-month delay in renegotiating a contract with oil workers, and government
efforts to consolidate all unions into a
progovernment, socialist organization.
Meanwhile, PDVSA is incorporating
thousands of workers from recently
nationalized oil service contractors.
In May Venezuelan troops seized the
assets of 60 foreign and domestic oil
service companies in a conflict over $14
billion owed by PDVSA. The company
brought in more than $120 billion in
revenue in 2008, but this year it will
likely make just $50 billion.
Outside analysts estimate PDVSA
needs to spend $3 billion/year just
to maintain present production from
existing fields, many with decline rates
of 25%/year or more. Meanwhile, the

The Angolan experience
The recent deals mirror Sinopec’s
successful strategy to obtain upstream
holdings in Angola. Loans to the Angolan government and long-term crude
supply deals helped Sinopec acquire
50% of deepwater Block 18 via Sonangol’s right to preempt.
Sinopec subsequently leveraged its
relationship with Sonangol, the Angolan NOC, into new opportunities in
development and exploration. In 2005,
a Sinopec-Sonangol joint venture took a
25% stake in Block 3/80 upon expiration of Total SA’s development license.

Gazprom grapples with dents to revenues, investments
Uchenna Izundu
International Editor
The dramatic fall in gas prices over
the past year has dented revenues and
investment plans of OAO Gazprom, the
world’s largest gas producer.
In June Alexander Medevev, deputy
chief executive of Gazprom, said he expects an 11% drop in exports this year
to 142.1 billion cu m and a 38% drop
in export revenues to $40 billion.
European customers are expected to
pay over $2.80/thousand cu m for Russian gas in 2009. Medvedev said despite
the crisis, gas consumption in Europe
was higher in fourth-quarter 2008 and
first-quarter 2009 than in the warm
spring of 2006-07. “Temperatures play
a bigger role than GDP dynamics,” he
said.
The company doesn’t expect to
return to 2008 production levels until
after 2012.
“I think they are right,” said Jonathan Stern, director of gas research at
the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “Gazprom is dependent on the
global and national economy, and there
is nothing that they can do to change
that picture.” In 2020, gas is expected
to constitute 82% of the group’s net
income with oil being 14% and power,
4%.
With Gazprom being inextricably
tied to the Kremlin and a major political
tool in its foreign policy, the company
has benefited from the government’s
drive to exert greater control over the
energy industry.
Chris Weafer, a strategist at Uralsib
Bank in Moscow, said this was a major
transition year for Russia as Vladimir
Putin’s presidency had focused on
stability and restructuring. Now his successor, Dmitry Medvedev, wants to push
a controversial reform agenda and attract foreign investment. This, however,
has been delayed by the economic crisis
and the conflict with Georgia.

Pushing Ukraine and other former
Soviet Union countries to pay market
prices is a major headache. Ukraine is
struggling to pay for the gas because of
the impact of the financial crisis on its
economy. In January Gazprom stopped
supplies for 20 days because the countries could not agree on future gas and
transit prices. Gazprom lost well over
$1.1 billion in direct revenues because
of the dispute. In response to erratic
payments, Gazprom in June threatened
to cut gas again if Naftogaz Ukrainy,
Ukraine’s national gas company, did not
pay for the gas.
The European Commission urged
Ukraine to reform its gas industry and
is working with international financial
institutions, Ukraine, and Russia to
reach an agreement on payments.

Presence overseas
Gazprom is an example of an NOC
contributing to its country’s economic
growth.
“NOCs are more proactive and innovative on their relationships with the
future in mind, and they are investing
in countries to access reserves such as
China and Russia in Africa and Latin
America,” said Johan Nell, head of upstream at Accenture.
One of its latest deals was the signing of a protocol in June with Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp. to form a
joint venture, named Nigaz, to conduct
gas exploration, production, and transportation and to build power generation facilities in Nigeria. The venture
could be worth up to $2.5 billion.

There’s no doubt that the $300 billion OFS sector will have to identify efficiencies itself. Cost reductions will be

These are particularly important for

part as low company valuations result in

But as industry interdependence
rises, oil companies themselves must
adopt an entirely new approach to supplier relationships and procurement.
Today, for example, NOCs and IOCs
will often procure services at the lowest
headline cost in an attempt to minimize
short-term outlay. This can often result
in rewarding suboptimal suppliers and
raising longer term expenditure. In
what effectively boils down to a commoditized transaction, contracts are less
likely to be awarded to the most innovative business model or to the most
technically advanced solutions. Instead,
the transaction can add costly management resources and processes.
IOCs must therefore ensure that
procurement is led by a search for value
creation to distinguish more effectively
between lowest headline costs and
lowest true total cost of ownership.
Procurement should also be pursued
with a relentless drive for higher levels
of performance across all areas of
the integrated value chain, including
advancement in the health, safety, and
environmental impact.

ciple should also be adopted by more
NOCs. This not only reflects the growing power of NOCs and the reserves
they control, but it also follows from
the increasing levels of cooperation
between IOCs and NOCs. The sustainable exploitation of new fields demands
a healthy support for suppliers—local
and international—as these regions seek
to create skills-rich labor forces that
they currently lack.

On line markets
A major advance for local suppliers
in recent years has been the establishment of transparent online markets
aligned to NOCs’ needs. Petrobras’s

one such example. In addition, Brazil’s

of 2005, has improved the efficiency of
procurement itself, with savings of up

and the reverse auction system. But it
has also helped to increase local content
from about 14% to over 30%. Angola’s
Sonangol has established an online marketplace, which helps vendors win new
business by participating in a growing
supplier network.
But local marketplaces are not a panacea in themselves. It still remains for
the presiding NOC to choose whether
to use an efficient online marketplace to
hold auctions and pursue procurement
by headline cost or to adopt a comprehensive approach that rewards optimal
suppliers who can deliver lower total
costs over the long term. Combining
the two elements of value creation is
critical for a sustainable future.

thought CFTC should seriously consider setting position limits in energy
markets. “As a regulator, we have to
ensure for market integrity both when
the skies are clear and when there are
storms on the horizon. As we consider
the effects of large, concentrated positions on the markets, our regulations
should address times of volatile or
uncertain markets as well as when the
markets are stable,” he said.
Gensler added that he was pleased
to read in Donohue’s written testimony that CME supports adoption of
a hard-limit regime, including singlemonth and all-months limits, calling it
a significant development. But Gensler
added that three basic questions remain:
What formula should be used to determine where position levels are set?
Should they be set by the CFTC or by
individual exchanges? Should noncommercial exemptions be provided for
financial risk management?
Gensler noted that in CFTC’s position limit exemptions for agriculture
commodities, there are three different
categories: commercial parties with
physical inventory and sales, commercial parties with physical anticipatory
needs, and noncommercial entities such
as swap dealers. “The commission is
taking a close look at whether to eliminate these hedge exemptions for certain
swap dealers and possibly create a new
risk management exemption,” he said.
Noting that he has introduced legislation requiring the CFTC to use its
emergency powers and giving it new
authority to curb excessive speculation,
Sanders questioned giving any position
limit or reporting exemptions to any
noncommercial trading entity. “I think
the American people would have a hard
time understanding why large financial
firms are being treated the same way
as large trucking companies and other
bona fide users of oil products. We have
reached a point where the overwhelming majority of trades are conducted by
speculators,” he said.

USGS monitoring
ecological impacts

T

he US Geological Survey has
assessed domestic energy resources for more than 125 years.
While its evaluations also cover coal,
oil shale, and uranium, its major
activity remains oil and gas, where it
forecasts and prioritizes volumes of
undiscovered, technically recoverable
resources.
Now, a fact sheet posted July 23
on its web site describes how USGS
has also begun to assess and monitor environmental impacts associated
with energy development.
“Using its integrated-multidisciplinary expertise in geology, biology,
hydrology, and geography, USGS
created the Ecological Assessment and
Monitoring process to evaluate the
consequences of resource extraction,
production, distribution, and use on
ecosystems,” it says.
Environmental impact assessments
depend first on the energy resources
being considered; then on landscapes,
habitats, and biota at risk; and finally
the objectives of the agency charged
to manage the resources, according
to the fact sheet, entitled “Ecological Assessment and Monitoring for
Energy Resource Development.”

Identifying stressors
The report by Tom Owens, of
USGS’s Center for Biological Informatics in Denver, on the environmental assessment and monitoring
(EAM) process begins with strategic
planning. Once a petroleum province is identified, stakeholders begin
to identify factors, called stressors,
which can influence the ecosystem
and shape resource management
decisions.
“Most stressors are sociopolitical

or economic in nature and may be
affected by expanding economies
and populations, commercial and industrial development, and increased
standards of living. When examined
cumulatively, the oil and gas wells,
infrastructure, and human activities
that directly affect the landscape may
be substantial” in energy resource
areas, it observes.
A conceptual model is developed
next to link drivers, stressors, effects,
and end points for planning purposes. It can indicate how stressors
may produce cumulative effects, such
as when suppressants used to control
road construction dust can potentially damage plant communities, the
report says.

What it provides
Complementing the US Environmental Protection Agency’s existing
processes, a USGS EAM can initially
characterize the at-risk landscape
by conducting a baseline biological
resources inventory, the fact sheet
continues.
“Depending on the resource
management questions and technical issues linked to the assessment
and monitoring needs of [DOI’s]
resource-management bureaus,
existing data and information may
be analyzed and evaluated within the
context of uncertainty sufficient for
resource management needs,” it says.
In the face of climate change
and other shifting baselines, these
resource management bureaus and
their USGS partners may develop
assessment, monitoring, and surveillance programs critical to the longterm sustainability of ecosystems and
their resources, the report says. ✦

ing exemptions for West Texas Intermediate crude contracts since 2006,
many of which are for swap dealers

Stupak continued. “Swaps are currently
excluded from requirements for position limits designed to prevent excessive speculation. An estimated 85% of
futures purchases tied to commodity
index speculation come through swap
dealers,” he said.
Gensler noted that position limits are
designed to prevent undue market concentration. “To the extent that financial
parties, such as money managers, hedge
funds, and swap dealers participate in
the futures markets, position limits
have the potential to increase liquidity
by reducing the positions of the largest
traders. Position limits can enhance
liquidity by promoting more market
participants rather than having one
party that has so much concentration so
as to decrease liquidity,” he said.
Stupak also said he would like to see
foreign boards of trade, such as the InterContinental Exchange and the Dubai
Exchange, with significant energy trad-

ing operations in this country operate
under the same regulations as domestic
commodities exchanges. “The CFTC
does not have the authority to regulate
foreign markets that act as price-setting
markets dominated by US energy trading. CFTC must enforce standards on
all markets to eliminate loopholes,” he
said.
Sanders said his bill contains a
similar provision, as well as a conflict of
interests section that would bar investment firms from issuing commodity price forecasts from one division
while holding a significant position in
another unit. “Frankly, the American
people are tired of record-breaking Wall
Street profits and excessive compensation packages while Americans are
losing their jobs. They’re tired of hedge
funds betting that the subprime market
will get worse. And they’re sick of Wall
Street betting that the price of oil will
go up while Americans pay millions at
the gas pump,” he declared.
CFTC will hold two more hearings
on energy commodity position limits
and exemptions on July 29 and Aug.

Poten: Abu Dhabi gas demand could limit sour gas for LNG
Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Co.
is considering plans to increase LNG
production at its complex on Das Island
beyond 2019, when its 4.7-million
tonne/year LNG sales contract with Tokyo Electric Power Co. (Tepco) expires,
according to Poten & Partners, New
York, an industry consultancy.
The expansion option would include
replacing smaller existing trains with a
much larger new one. It would depend
upon expanding gas production to
cover growing domestic demand and
reinjection into oil fields, while freeing
up extra offshore gas for LNG export.
With domestic energy demand
growing at 10%/year, said Poten, Abu
Dhabi has decided to move forward
with a plan to invest as much as $50
billion in developing large onshore
and shallow-water sour-gas reserves.
But freeing up extra gas for LNG could
prove to be a very tall order, according
to Poten’s analysis.

Consumption, plans
Standing at more than 6 trillion
cu m, the UAE’s gas reserves are the
world’s fifth largest. Much of the gas,
however, is either already locked into
the gas caps in Abu Dhabi’s oil fields or
needed for reinjection.
With official oil reserves of 98 billion bbl, the gas reinjection requirement will continue for many years.
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC)

by 8%/year through 2020.
With the country almost exclusively
dependent on gas-fueled electric power
generation, says Poten, total gas consumption is projected to reach close to
90 bcm/year by 2018, doubling the
50 bcm including reinjection used in
2008. The UAE has already tapped gas
supplies from Qatar via the Dolphin
pipeline to meet its needs, but its own

large sour-gas reserves in the past had
been considered too costly to develop.
ADNOC has now decided to go
ahead with the onshore Shah sour-gas
development, although it is hoping to
reduce the cost of this 1-bcfd, $1012 billion project by 30%. ADNOC
and partner ConocoPhillips signed the
joint-venture agreement on July 9 (OGJ

The project consists of developing
wells, pipelines, and gas plants with
corrosion-resistant material throughout
to handle 23% hydrogen sulfide and
10% carbon dioxide gas. The sulfur and
condensates would be removed and
exported through the port of Ruwais,
while the treated lean gas would be fed
back into the domestic market.
This level of capital expenditure
implies a cost of $4/MMbtu for the gas,
says Poten. In hopes of lowering these
costs, ADNOC issued tenders for four
large construction packages even before
concluding a final agreement with
ConocoPhillips. The tenders cover gas
gathering systems, wells, gas pipelines,
processing plant, off site facilities, utilities, and sulfur recovery. Officials expect
the project to start up in 2015.

Sulfur pipeline
Notably missing, Poten points out,
is a tender for a 136-km liquid-sulfur
pipeline connecting the Shah field to
Ruwais, where the sulfur, more than
4.2 million tonnes/year, is to be granulated and exported to global markets. It
is understood the sulfur pipeline package was not released due to a lack of
qualified bidders.
Sulfur is already trucked from the
Habshan gas-treatment plants to Ruwais. That option is hardly viable for the
expansion, says Poten, as it would add
more than 600/day 20-tonne truckloads of molten sulfur to the traffic on
the main western highway. Any delays
in the pipeline would therefore be
controversial.
Once Qatar’s current projects are
fully operational, the gulf area will be
exporting huge quantities of sulfur,
perhaps more than can be absorbed in
the global market, according to Poten’s
analysis. The alternative to exporting
would be to cast the sulfur in giant
blocks in the desert, an option that has
not been acceptable to ADNOC in the
past but would remove the need for the
pipeline or trucking.

he Venezuelan government is fast
politicizing the country’s oil and
gas industry, now requiring workers
to support the socialist revolution of
President Hugo Chavez if they plan
on keeping their jobs.
“We are convinced that the majority of the working sector in the oil
industry supports (Chavez’s socialist) Revolution,” said Oil Minister
Rafael Ramirez. “So…we are going
to discuss the collective agreement
with those revolutionary sectors of
oil workers.”
Ramirez was referring to longdelayed talks with oil workers to
establish a new 3-year collective
bargaining agreement on pay and
benefits. And, underscoring the need
to be politically correct, he said the
negotiations would resume after
union elections take place.
Those remarks echo earlier ones in
which Ramirez actually said Venezuela’s oil workers will be suspected of
conspiring against Chavez’s socialist
revolution if they do not join socialist
workplace groups.

No counter-revolutionaries
“By now, there should not be a
single counter-revolutionary in the
heart of our company, our industry,”
Ramirez said at a rally with workers
taken on by state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA after it nationalized dozens of oil service companies
earlier this year. “There cannot be a
single PDVSA installation where socialist committees do not exist,” said
Ramirez, who has long spearheaded
Chavez’s drive to bring politics into
Venezuela’s main industry.
“Whoever is not in a committee will be suspected of conspiring

against the revolution,” the minister
said.
According to Ramirez, Venezuela
is nearing its target of “liberating”
8,000 oil workers from recently
nationalized private companies and
hiring them to work for the state-run
oil company—under the umbrella of
socialism.
Ramirez last week said 6,900 former employees of private local and
foreign companies are now on the
PDVSA payroll—sending the company payroll to 80,000 workers.

Severe pressure
The figure is nearly double what
it was when Chavez took office in
2001, and industry analysts warn that
it will put severe pressure on PDVSA’s
financial health, especially given the
drop in oil prices.
If the Chavez regime has any concerns about that, Ramirez is not the
one to ask. “Costs are being reduced
in a process that has had no problems,” the minister said.
To keep the public focused away
from any such problems, however,
the Chavez regime has again raised
doubts about the US, saying a recent
decision by Washington, DC, to land
troops in neighboring Colombia
is part of a wider plot. “It’s an act
of aggression toward our country,”
Ramirez said of the plans that would
allow US military personnel to operate from bases in Colombia, which
shares a 1,400-mile border with Venezuela. “We are worried about what’s
happening,” he said.
“Now that the Yankees want to
set up four bases in Colombia…it
forces us to review our relations with
Colombia,” intoned Chavez. ✦

$7-8 billion Integrated Gas Development project (OGJ Online, July 16,
2009). IGD will generate an additional
1 bcfd (10.34 bcm/year) through
construction of a 38-km pipeline from
offshore fields to Das Island where the
gas will be partially processed. It will
then be piped to an onshore plant in
Ruwais for final processing and use in
the domestic market.
The project is scheduled for completion by 2014. ADNOC has awarded a
$402-million engineering, procurement, and fabrication contract to
majority government-owned National
Petroleum Construction Co. The contract covers part of the offshore pipe-

T E R E S T
line construction and is scheduled for
completion by mid-2012.
ADNOC plans an additional four tender package releases for IGD in the next
few months, covering gas development
work in the onshore Bab field and the
offshore Umm Shaif field.
IGD’s first phase will deliver 500
MMcfd from Bab, followed by a second 500-MMcfd offshore phase. The
offshore component reduces potential
gas reserves available for any future
LNG production increase at Das Island,
signaling the importance to ADNOC of
meeting the demand for domestic gas.
Meanwhile, ADNOC is taking

measures to fill an immediate supply gap. The week of July 20, the firm
announced a new contract for Qatar to
supply 400 MMcfd of “interruptible”
gas via the Dolphin pipeline, which
currently delivers 2 bcfd of Qatari
North field gas from Ras Laffan to Abu
Dhabi. The pipeline has 1.2 bcfd of
unused capacity and the contract is intended to supply gas in the summer to
meet peak power-generation demand.
Elsewhere in the UAE, Golar LNG
plans to station its 125,000 cu m Golar
Freeze as a floating regasification and
storage unit at Jebel Ali for 10 years
from 2011 to fuel growing power demand (OGJ, July 27, 2009, p. 33). ✦

Shell Gas & Power to push ahead with ﬂoating LNG
Shell Gas & Power Developments BV,
The Hague, signed an agreement July
28 in Paris with a consortium of Technip and Samsung for design, construction, and installation of several floating
LNG (FLNG) facilities over a period of
up to 15 years, according to an announcement from Shell.
The companies also signed a contract
for front-end engineering and design
for Shell’s 3.5 million tonne/year
“FLNG solution.”
Shell conceived its technology, said
the announcement, to place gas liquefaction directly over offshore gas fields
and thereby precluding long-distance
pipelines and extensive onshore infrastructure.
The concept’s key dimensions are
about 450 m by 70 m, with a 3.5
million tpy LNG capacity, plus associated LPG and condensate production,
taking total liquid production potential
to more than 5 million tpy. Estimated
topsides weight is more than 50,000
tonnes, said the announcement.
Shell’s FLNG design is, according to
the company, “suitable for more distant
offshore fields, designed to operate
under harsh metocean conditions and
process a wide range of gas compositions.”

Shell Gas & Power is pushing ahead with
the design, construction, and installation
of several floating LNG facilities. Artistic
impression from Shell.

The broad operating parameters of
the Shell design mean it can be redeployed, said Shell. Its standardized
“design one—build many” approach
permits “material repeatability gains”
during design and construction. After
completing the FEED phase, Shell said it

will examine key aspects of each potential FLNG project in its portfolio before
considering a final investment decision.
“This innovative alternative to traditional onshore LNG plants provides
a commercially attractive and environmentally sensitive approach for monetization of offshore gas fields,” said
Shell. ✦

In 1962, Atkins and Hale completed
the Dipper No. 1, in 28-16n-1e, in
Blackland North field in Macon County,
for an initial production of 3,120
b/d of oil, the highest reported in the
Sangamon arch area. The main oil-saturated zone is in a reef and reef rudstone
facies at 2,003-37 ft in the upper part
of the lower Racine sequence. The cumulative production of the Dipper well
has been over 123,000 bbl of oil, and it

An offset to the southwest, the
Atkins and Hale Whitley No. 1, was
completed in the same zone with an
initial production of 350 b/d of oil.
It produced 93,000 bbl of oil before
it was abandoned in 1971. These two
wells have produced nearly one half of

there were no company or drilling contractor lost-time accidents.
Some of the lost-time incidents that
the software helped to avoid during the
implementation phase were:
• Stuck pipe situations by listing the
immediate steps to take when problems
arose
• Lost time by calling for in time
checks of required drilling tools.
• A previous stuck-pipe incident by
recommending a change to a heavyweight drill pipe as the bottomhole
assembly in an 81⁄2 in. hole section.
• A previous waiting time on wrong

practices called for to avoid previously

could not be set and the 5-in. drill pipe
was required for reaming or check trips.
• Rechecking factory make-up for all
pretorqued connections to avoid losing
tools in hole.
• Circulating bottoms up completely
or circulating each liner joint to bottom
in case of hole problems to avoid stuck
pipe situations.
• Baker locking bull nose and underreamer nozzles to avoid fishing jobs for
drilling tools.
• Not function-testing the motor
with a polycrystalline-diamond-compact (PDC) bit inside casing to avoid
casing and bit damage.
• Not running junk baskets through

Japanese refiners face a surplus of
capacity at a time of massive global
refining surpluses.
Analysis by the East-West Center, Honolulu, of Japan’s oil-product demand
and exports outlook estimates Japan’s
excess refining capacity for 2009 at
780,000 b/d, 990,000 b/d for 2010,
and 1.4 million b/d for 2015. These
estimates are based on current refining

million b/d to 1 million b/d starting in
2011. Although many Japanese refiners are unwilling to entertain this dire
prospect, it is difficult to see any other
option.

Petroleum product demand

Following a 2.8% decline in 2007,
Japan’s petroleum product demand fell
further in 2008, by 4.4% to 4.6 million
b/d. Demand for all products, except
fuel oil, contracted on a year-on-year
basis. Fuel oil demand, including crude
oil for direct burning, increased by
7.1% due to large-scale nuclear power
plant shutdowns and a consequent increase in thermal-power generation.

lighten with industrial demand declining significantly—and optimize existing
capacity, along with eyeing more product exports. In view of the envisioned
decline in fuel-oil demand, the following two refiners plan to add new units:
Taiyo Oil to add a 25,000-b/d
residue fluid-catalytic-cracking unit at
the Kikuma refinery by fourth-quarter
2010 and Cosmo Oil to add a 25,000b/d coker at the Sakai refinery by April
2010.
Except for these two, there will be
no major investments in conversion
units until 2015, as refiners reduce
crude distillation unit capacity in the
face of falling domestic demand and
growing difficulty in exporting refined
products.

Increased exports helped refiners
ease throughput cuts as well. Japan’s
product exports increased to 375,000
b/d in 2008 from 267,000 b/d in
2007. It should be noted that we treat
bonded bunker sales and bonded jet-fuel sales as domestic demand; therefore
exports represent only genuine exports.
Diesel exports increased to 220,000
b/d in 2008—which accounts for nearly 60% of Japan’s total exports, from
142,000 b/d in 2007. Asia—mostly
China and Singapore—accounted for
55% of Japan’s total exports, followed
by Oceania (Australia and New Zealand,
25%), Europe and CIS (8%), North
America (6%), South America (Brazil,
Chile, and Colombia, 6%), and the
Middle East (1%).

emerging new refining capacity for selfsufficiency. The Asian product market is
expected to be a battlefield of product
sales, and competition will become
fierce. We must keep in mind that
market competition will come from
national oil companies that aggressively export to emerging markets, for
example, India’s Reliance Industries Ltd.
Furthermore, the global environment
surrounding the refining industry is
restraining product exports from Japan
to the US. Since second-quarter 2008,
US demand declined initially because
of higher prices. But demand continues
to decline because of economic recession. The US has become a large gas oil
exporter, looking for export markets in
Latin America and Europe. Given that
these changes had taken place in the
past year, the US market has little room

for product imports.
Especially with the economic
downturn, it seems difficult for Japanese refiners to depend too much on
exports on a full-cost basis. We believe,
however, that there will be opportunities for Japanese refiners to export on
a marginal basis; opportunities will be
open if refiners seek a marginal profit
through exports.
Based on FGE’s outlook for product
demand and imports-exports, Table 1

summarizes Japan’s product balance
outlook. Japan’s total exports for 2009
are forecast to fall to 280,000 b/d, of
which gas oil accounts for 150,000
b/d, and further to 245,000 b/d in
2010.

Japanese refiners—excess refining

demand outlook and product exports
indicate Japan’s excess capacity (based
on current refining capacity and assuming 93% yield for main petroleum
fuels) for 2009, 2010, and 2015 are,
respectively, 780,000 b/d, 990,000
b/d, and 1.4 million b/d. Even assuming that Nippon Oil and Nippon
Mining Holdings remove 400,000 b/d
from the market (including the Osaka
refinery), there still remains excess
capacity. Japanese refiners are facing a
surplus problem at a time of massive
global refining surplus.
In order to optimize production,
logistics, and commercial competitiveness, refiners must make strategic and
innovative decisions because petroleum
is an economic necessity and will continue to be a vital mineral to be used
mainly for transport fuels and feedstock
for petrochemical.
Forming alliances and joint ventures will become more important for
the industry in order to help ease the
costly, as well as socially and culturally
complex processes of closing regional
refineries. Especially, strategic alliances
that come with crude supplies or product export outlets will help Japanese
refiners prolong their refineries’ lives.
The strategic alliance between Nippon Oil and China’s CNPC to operate
Nippon Oil’s Osaka refinery is one
such new model, in which Nippon Oil
will own 51% and CNPC 49%. Under
the new plan, the Osaka refinery will
be converted to an export-oriented
refinery. CNPC will supply crude oil to
the refinery and market all the refined
products.
Indeed, this alliance will give Nippon Oil the alternative to keep the
Osaka refinery operating.
Such countries as Vietnam and
Indonesia that have oil but insufficient
capacity should be interested in such
JV opportunities with Japanese companies, as they can reduce product import
dependency while avoiding investing
large amounts to build their own refineries. Japanese refiners can utilize their
existing refineries and help the energy
security situation in the region as well.

In conclusion, the sharper-than-expected 2008 demand decline illustrates
clearly that the base of Japanese refiners’
business is deteriorating quickly. The
global economic recession is indeed
worsening the environment surrounding Japan’s refining industry in 2009.
Along with the suggested strategic
alliances and JVs, there is an inevitable
conclusion that substantial refining
capacity in Japan needs to close. We
expect refining margins to become
more negative in line with the global
refining business in 2010-11, resulting
in refinery closures in Japan (in a range
of 500,000 b/d and 1 million b/d)
starting in 2011.
Many Japanese refiners are unwilling
to entertain these dire prospects, but it
is difficult to see any other option. We
believe the refiners will need to plan
and adjust to the tough circumstances
lie ahead. The merger between Nippon
Oil and Nippon Mining Holdings will
certainly make other Japanese refiners
reassess their business strategies, and
consequently, another wave of industry
reorganization would take place. ✦

structure was considered a necessity.
Of the several available technology
features, the following were selected for
the coker design:
• Vertical Plate Coke Drum technology (CB&I design); gives longer
coke-drum life and is more tolerant to
operating upsets.
• T-Rex skirt shell attachment; for reduction of stresses in the shell to avoid
shell cracks.
• DeltaValve unheading devices
(bottom and top); industry-accepted
approach to removing operating personnel from the hazardous environment
of the bottom and top head during the
unheading step. Also, improves the efficiency of unheading step by decreasing
the time required to unhead the drum,
leaving more time for the other decoking steps. These devices also reduce
ongoing unheading maintenance costs.
• Remote cutting station
(Ruhrpumpen control system and
DeltaValve control system); moves the
cutter’s station from the top deck and
allows the unheading control of the
drums to occur at a location off the
coke drum structure.
• Auto switch cutting tool
(Ruhrpumpen design); allows the operator to switch the tool from boring to
cutting mode without having to be on
the coke drum’s structure.
• State-of-the-art decoking control
system; 100% electronic system.

Vertical plate technology
In the past decade, demand for
delayed-coking capacity has been
steadily increasing due to the financial benefits of processing heavier
and lower-quality crudes. To keep up
with this demand, many refiners with
delayed-coking units have chosen to
shorten the heat-up and cool-down
parts of the decoking cycle.
This action, however, reduces the
useful life of the coke drums because
the severe operational thermal cycling
causes the steel plate and the weld to
be stressed with each cycle. Also, due
to their different relative strengths, the
drum may bulge and eventually crack

Depending on plate size limitations, up to 70% of
the circumferential weld seams can be eliminated,
resulting in a cylindrical shell section that can
endure the most severe thermal cycles (Fig. 2).
near the circumferential weld seams.
This leads to the coke drums being
taken offline to make needed repairs or
partial shell replacements.
Although industry recognizes that
shorter, more severe cycles cause the
bulging and cracking to appear sooner,
only a few refiners have the option of
increasing cycle time because of current
refining economics.
Recent efforts to improve the reliability and life span of coke drums have
focused on mitigating the stiffening effect of the weld seams, which increases
stress and is chiefly responsible for
distortion and cracking. These measures
have included:

• Decreasing the weld metal’s yield
strength to be within a closer percentage of the base metal’s yield.
• “Blend grinding” the weld profile.
• Using higher alloy clad materials
to construct the coke drums.
• Maintaining a uniform shell thickness throughout the coke drum (there
are often step reductions in thickness
from one shell course to the next based
on each shell’s specified design pressure).
• Specifying materials greater than 2
in. thick.
Although several of these proposed
specifications have indeed responded
to some of the issues of thermal cycling, none of them has been effective
in preventing coke-drum distortion
entirely.
In 1997, CB&I conducted its own
analysis of coke-drum distortion and
cracking and concluded that the best
solution would be to eliminate circumferential weld seams. Incorporating
technology and expertise from other
applications, CB&I developed a method
for successfully fabricating shell plates
with the long side oriented vertically.
This process allows for the fabrication of cylindrical shell sections of up
to 46 ft without a circumferential weld
seam. Depending on plate size limitations, up to 70% of the circumferential
weld seams can be eliminated, resulting
in a cylindrical shell section that can
endure the most severe thermal cycles
(Fig. 2).
Since 2000, CB&I has completed 11
vertical plate coke-drum retrofit projects
and 6 new coke drums, including 2 for
the Frontier project. Frontier and CB&I
chose the vertical plate technology to
take advantage of the improved reliability and life span.

T-Rex skirt attachment
Several alternative skirt designs have
been developed to counter skirt-weld
failures. One such design is the T-Rex
skirt, a culmination of best practices
and lessons learned from years of fabricating and repairing coke drums.
Recently, a finite-element analysis

The bottom unheading device has
substantially improved delayed-coker
design and safety. By creating a completely sealed connection from the bottom of the coke drum down through
the discharge chute, the unheading
device isolates personnel, equipment,
and the environment from exposure
to hydrocarbons, hot coke, water, and
steam.
With the addition of the bottom unheading device, the following benefits
are realized:
• Substantial savings in time, up to
2 hr, to implement the unheading and
reheading portions of the decoking
cycle.
• Reduced operating and maintenance expenses.
• Fewer coke-drum operators.
• Operators are not required to be
on the structure when the drum heads
are removed.
• The bottom DeltaValve device also
has throttling capability so as not to
overwhelm the primary crushing and
transportation systems.
• The deck design provides substantial open area that benefits operator
safety and ease of maintenance.
For the Frontier project, the bottom
unheading device is supported by a
dual-purpose monorail system. While
the primary function is to support the
weight of the unheading valve, the
monorails were extended to allow the
removal of the unheading valve from
the unit without the need of any assistance crane. Fig. 4 shows the open
design and monorail system of the bottom unheading valve.
The traditional approach to top
unheading, as with bottom unheading, was labor intensive. The operators
working on the top head were exposed
to upsets within the coke drum expelOil & Gas Journal / Aug. 3, 2009

input/output panels, variable frequency drives, and programmable
logic controller. The operator shelter
is centered facing the chutes to allow
operators to observe the coke leaving
the drum.
The interior of the cutting shelter
consists of two sets of panels, one for
each drum, controlling the decoking
equipment. The cutting shelter also
houses the DeltaValve top and bottom
control panels. Also included are readouts for coke-drum acoustics and vibration that the operator uses to determine
when the coke drum’s wall is reached,
as well as the camera system located on
the structure.
The camera system consists of four
tilt-and-pan cameras operated from the
cutting shelter. These cameras have low
light, zoom, and panning capabilities if
required by the location.
Two of the cameras are mounted
near grade to provide views where the
coke chutes are located. These cameras provide two additional angles to
prevent a loss of line-of-sight in case
of heavy steam in one direction due to
the prevailing winds. A third camera is
in the top unheading deck to provide
general monitoring of the area as well
as the location of the cutting tool and
the rotation of the drill stem.
The fourth camera is about half
way up the derrick structure with the
primary function of providing a view
of the rotation of the hoist cable. Fig.
5 shows the camera display for the
operator.

The auto-switch cutting tool allows
the operator to switch from boring
mode to cutting mode without needing to remove the cutting tool from the
drum. The switch is done by cycling
the pressure to the cutting tool.
Properly used, this enhances operator safety by not requiring operator
presence on the structure with a full
coke drum open to the environment.
This operation is performed very
quickly, thereby providing time for use
in other steps in the decoking cycle.

drum is in the coking cycle. The stem
does not have to be tied off when not
in use.
• The dome acts as a venting chamber for fumes that are expelled when
the top head is opened and to dissipate
heat during the coking cycle. The dome
is vented to a more remote location.
• Containment for coke pieces that
are expelled during a blowout.

some existing LNG contracts with Asian
customers; for example, BG supply
deals with Asian customers. These cargoes could be swapped with available
Pacific LNG, providing customers with
product of a specification with which
they may be more familiar and reducing transport costs in the process.
• It also seems likely some spot cargoes of Pacific LNG will be routed into
the US West Coast and Atlantic markets
over the next couple of years.
But prices of spot sales of gas are
likely to remain subdued to 2011.
From 2012 Wood Mackenzie estimates
the Pacific will once again require
incremental LNG from the Middle East
or the Atlantic to balance the market.
Strong medium-term growth in China’s
LNG import requirements predicate this
estimate.
Chinese buyers are in advanced
stages of negotiations for contracting more than 10 million tonnes/year
of LNG from several potential new
projects. Other Asian buyers are seeking
LNG in the same time period due to the
expiry of contracts in Indonesia, Brunei,
and Malaysia. This supplier competition, combined with uncertainty about
which new projects under consideration will actually progress to final
investment decision (FID), is contributing some uncertainty in the market,
particularly for 2013-14 supply.
This medium-term supply-demand
picture still favors sellers, providing
price support in the negotiation of
long-term contracts. Analysis, however,
suggests the Pacific market east of India
requires only a further 36 billion cu m/
year of new LNG in 2015, while the
combined potential output capacity of
PNG LNG, Queensland Curtis, GLNG,
Ichthys, and Donggi—all ostensibly chasing FID within the next 18
months—is 57 billion cu m/year when
fully operational. Qatar could also decide to re-market flexible Atlantic LNG
into the Pacific and lock in the market
ahead of these new LNG projects.1

of FID on new volumes becomes more

Biofuels analytical solutions portfolio expanded
The EcoAnalytix biofuels analytical
solutions portfolio has been expanded to
include nine analyzers and systems, crossing six technologies: ICP-optical emission
spectroscopy(ICP-OES), gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography,
infrared, differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC), and liquid scintillation counters
(LSC).
The company’s biodiesel and bioethanol portfolio has been expanded to
include 1) the fatty acid methyl esters
system based on the Clarus GC for determining fuel composition, 2) oxidation
stability system based on the DSC 8500
for determining the oxidation status of
biofuel, and 3) the 14C LSC system for
determining the fuel blend. This range
represents a full suite of methods and
technologies for biodiesel development
and testing needs.
A full suite of systems for testing
bioethanol, a sugar-based fuel made from
such crops as sugarcane, corn, or wheat,

is also available. This line consists of an

From the Subscribers Only area of

Needy California
takes a new look
at big oil project
Fiscal distress is nudging California
toward a measured embrace of—gasp!—oil
and gas development.
Staggering under a budget deﬁcit of $26
billion, the government will try to maneuver around opposition to a plan to develop
the Tranquillon Ridge prospect off Santa
Barbara (OGJ Online, July 23, 2009).
With extraordinary concessions, Plains
Exploration & Production Co. last year won

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

the approval of hypersensitive Santa Barbara County and antioil environmentalists
for production of perhaps 100 million bbl of
oil from beneath state waters via Platform
Irene on federal acreage.
The concessions included an agreement
to cease all production off California and
to remove onshore processing facilities
when Tranquillon Ridge production ceased
in about 15 years. In January, however, the
State Lands Commission, including Lt. Gov.
John Garamendi, rejected the lease. Garamendi said the state didn’t want to imply
acceptance of offshore drilling anywhere
(OGJ, Feb. 23, 2009, p. 18).
Now, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenneger is
reported to have made Tranquillon Ridge
revenue part of a ﬁscal deal with the legislature. The package includes $100 million in
advance royalty and the expectation of $1.8
billion in royalty over the project’s life.
Generally opposed to drilling off California, Schwarzenneger has voiced support for
Tranquillon Ridge development because of
the reliance on directional drilling from an
existing platform in federal waters.
And, of course, he needs the revenue.
Desperately.
Although supporters of the project
include such environmental groups as the
quintessentially Californian Get Oil Out, the
proposal is controversial.
Some Californians, including Garamendi, want to infect the rest of the US with
their costly energy delusions.
“We are taking dirty money,” he said of
the suggestion that the state earn money
from resource development.
And he added, “Big Oil has offered to
California $100 million to seduce the state
into granting the ﬁrst new oil drilling lease
in California since the Santa Barbara oil
spill 41 years ago.”
This may be the ﬁrst time an independent producer has been characterized as
Big Oil. But it’s hardly the ﬁrst time a California politician spouting off about energy
has betrayed an impressively limited grasp
of relevant facts.

A $60-70/bbl price band
Strong rallies in both equity and commodity markets in late July pushed frontmonth crude contracts above $68/bbl in New York and $70/bbl in London just 2
weeks after the price dipped below $60/bbl in a more pessimistic market.
That rapid rebound prompted analysts at KBC Market Services, a division of KBC
Process Technology Ltd. in Surrey, UK, to ask, “Is this becoming a new price band,
this time set by the market and not by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries?”
The rally started with better than expected earnings at a number of companies
and improved economic data. The Federal Reserve raised its 2010 growth forecast
and trimmed the amount of the 2009 contraction. But the bull market run was not
supported by any major improvement in supply and demand. “The only rationale
that explains the run-up is that expectations of a better tomorrow are growing.
This perception also prevents the whole complex toppling over under the weight of
stocks,” said KBC analysts. “In the real world, oil stocks are almost brimming over
the top of the tanks and, with the exception of China and a few other places, demand
remains ﬁrmly in the doldrums.”
China’s second-quarter gross domestic product was up 16.4% from the previous
quarter and 7.9% from a year ago. “The oil data seem to conﬁrm the improvement in
the Chinese economy,” said Paul Horsnell, a managing director and head of commodities research at Barclays Capital in London. China’s oil demand in the second
quarter was up 5.2% from a year ago, having fallen 3.1% in the ﬁrst quarter. Had
Chinese demand continued its ﬁrst-quarter weakness into the second quarter, global
oil demand would have been 600,000 b/d lower, Horsnel said.
Meanwhile, KBC analysts said, “There are still plenty of skeptics out there who
believe that even if the bottom of the recession is near, the recovery will be slow and
could even be reversed when the stimulus packages lavished on economies around
the world wear off.” They warned, “If the current more-positive outlook for the global
economy turns sour—and there are many respected commentators still talking about
the W-shaped recession—the much anticipated oil demand will be pushed further
out into the future and the sheer weight of stocks could lead to a major correction in
product prices that will drag crude down too.”
Good signs for marine rigs
The deepwater market is showing evidence of ﬁrming, and a sharp increase in
tender activity for jack up rigs suggests that market may be nearing bottom, too, said
analysts at FBR Capital Markets & Co. in Arlington, Va.
For jack up rigs, they said, “We have already seen several tenders for signiﬁcant
term work in major markets such as the Middle East, and inquiries to rig owners are
picking up. We believe that as many of these come to fruition, global ﬂeet utilization
should stabilize” toward the end of this year. However, FBR analysts said, “Demand
is far short of a rebound in day rates, and we continue to believe current levels will
persist for some time.”
On the other hand, FBR increased its rate forecasts for ultradeepwater rigs by
$75,000/day after Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) contracted Transocean
Ltd.’s Cajun Express semisubmersible unit for roughly $500,000/day. The rig is a
Sedco Forex Xpress 2000 design semisubmersible unit capable of operating in moderate environments and water depths of 8,500 ft.
Petrobras signed a $558.5 million, 3-year contract for the rig to drill in ultradeep
waters off Brazil. Within a year of executing that contract, Petrobras has the right to
convert it to a 5-year contract valued at $894.3 million. The contract term is expected
to commence in the ﬁrst quarter of 2010 following the completion of the rig’s current
contract. That deal highlights the strength and resiliency of the high-end deepwater
market, analysts said. As a result, FBR raised its ultradeepwater rate forecasts to
$475,000/day for most high-end rigs.
“Although few data points exist, the contract, combined with an uptick in activity
from independent and major operators, leads us to believe $60/bbl and above oil will
provide meaningful support to the ﬁfth- and sixth-generation market. We expect a
sharp differentiation, however, between newer and high-end rigs vs. older upgraded
rigs,” FBR analysts said.
Day rates are forecast on a rig-by-rig basis, with relatively newer fourth-generation rigs up by $25,000-50,000 to $400,000-450,000/day. “Lower-end ﬂoaters, such
as those built in the 1970s and 1980s, should continue to see signiﬁcant pressure,”
analysts said.

General

Interest

US independents urge Congress to change
As oil prices approach $100/bbl, eight associations representing US independent oil and gas producers asked Congress to consider the consequences of passing legislation that would reduce
domestic supplies further and increase prices even more.
“Increasing taxes on the industry by $16 billion to pay for renewable fuels, restricting development of federal lands (onshore
and offshore), and implementing new and unnecessary environmental restrictions doesn’t produce additional American oil or
natural gas. As a matter of fact, these policies would be counterproductive and increase prices to consumers,” the associations said
in a Nov. 7 joint statement released Nov. 13 by the Independent
Petroleum Association of America.
“The failed energy policies since the 1970s have been a major
contributor to the decline in US oil production from 9 million b/d
to 5 million b/d, and the rise in imported oil from 5 million b/d
to 12 million b/d. If the bills being pushed by the [congressional]
leadership pass, that trend will continue, and prices to consumers
will rise and become even more volatile,” they indicated.
The Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association, Ohio Oil & Gas Association,
Kansas Independent Oil & Gas Association, Oklahoma Independent
Petroleum Association, Independent Oil & Gas Association of West
Virginia, and the Independent Oil & Gas Association of Pennsylvania also signed the statement, which the groups developed during
IPAA’s 2007 annual meeting.

Analyst predicts oil-price decline next year
Oil prices will decline as demand for oil from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries flattens or recedes in 2008,
says Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research.
Lynch told the American Petroleum Institute’s Houston Chapter
that current oil prices are not sustainable. He predicts growth in
non-OPEC oil production over the next 5 years and believes the US
has seen a peak in gasoline demand, with car buyers now choosing
smaller vehicles.
Although dependent on changes in OPEC output, the oil price
Saudi Arabia wants to defend, and the condition of the global economy, price weakness will likely occur as soon as the second quarter
of next year, when Lynch sees an oil price of about $70/bbl. He
thinks inventory pressures will lead to a sustainable long-run oil
price of $40-45/bbl.
The consequences of a price collapse will be that US onshore
drilling stagnates, exploration and production in the shallow Gulf
of Mexico declines, and a possible pause in oil sands development,
Lynch said. High-cost producers will be most affected by a drop in

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

prices, especially those with sunk costs. Also, alternative energies
such as biofuels and hydrogen will feel a pinch from lower oil
prices, as will exporting nations and refiners.
The entities that thrive despite lower prices will be producers
with large cash reserves and governments friendly to foreign investment. But companies spending most of their cash flow now
will suffer and become takeover targets.
Lynch also sees a near-term drop in US natural gas prices. A
combination of record amounts of gas in storage, a predicted
warm 2007-08 winter in the US, a slower economy, and new supplies coming online will depress prices over the next few months,
he said.

WEC: China, India need huge energy investment
China will need $3.7 trillion worth of investment for energy
projects by 2030, of which three fourths will be dedicated to electric power alone, India’s secretary for power said Nov. 14 at the
World Energy Congress in Rome. India, by contrast, will require
$1.25 billion, with a similar share for power.
Anil Razdan said both countries need technology that will reduce emissions of coal used for power generation because oil and
gas imports are too expensive. Market forces alone cannot develop
technologies, he said. International cooperation is necessary to ensure that developing countries benefit from the best technologies
if they are to meet their power requirements.
“We can’t leave market forces alone for individual profit,” he
stressed, calling demand-cycle management and energy efficiency
critical strategies.
Although India and China have plentiful coal reserves, Razdan
warned that they might have to import coal. “India may have to
import more than China whose reserves are on the coast,” he said.
“India’s are in the interior, and this adds more pressure with transportation costs.”
According to Razdan, India’s coal demand is projected to grow
twofold by 2030, and oil requirements are expected to increase by
2.5% and nuclear power by 5.8%.
“China’s oil needs are forecasted to rise by 2.6% and nuclear by
10.5%,” he said.
Economic growth in these countries with the world’s largest
populations is fuelling the huge demand for energy. Conservative
estimates place their growth in gross domestic product at 8-9%/
year and energy consumption at 7-8%/year, Razdan added. Chinese
and Indians aspire to own cars and consumer goods, which will
have serious implications for carbon emissions if left unchecked.
Razdan said efforts are being made to increase the use of renewable energy sources, but these are not always economic options or
available in sufficient amounts.

EU discusses new European gas sources
Representatives from the European Union, Africa, and the Middle East discussed new sources of natural gas for European consumers at a Nov. 1 energy conference at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.
Europe wants to reduce its dependence on Russia, Norway, and
Algeria by developing other supplies in the Middle East and West
Africa. The meeting also was intended to highlight Egypt’s potential role as a transregional “bridge” between the Middle East and
Africa.
Benita Ferrero-Waldner of Austria, EU commissioner for external relations and neighborhood policy, co-chaired the meeting
with Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Egypt’s foreign affairs minister. In her
opening speech, Ferrero-Waldner said, “We are working to pro-

mote the access of Middle East and West African natural gas to the
EU market via pipelines such as the Arab Gas Pipeline originating
in Egypt and the planned connection in Iraq, as well as the important Trans-Saharan pipeline from Nigeria to the EU via Algeria”
EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs of Latvia said a comprehensive Africa-Europe energy partnership is one of the priorities for a “real European foreign policy.”
High-level representatives from all three regions discussed cooperation to enhance regional energy security, address climate
change, and improve access to energy sources.
Results of the conference will be considered by the EU-Africa
Energy Partnership to be launched at the EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December. ✦

Most recently, KRG signed a PSC with OMV Petroleum Exploration
(OGJ Online, Nov. 7, 2007).
In conjunction with the five new contracts, KRG Minister for
Natural Resources Ashti Hawrami said, “In Kurdistan, we are setting an example: This is the first post-Saddam framework for oil
investment in Iraq which follows the democratic, federal, and free
market principles mandated by the Iraq constitution.”
He said he hopes for a similar framework for all of Iraq.
“Without such a framework, investors cannot have confidence
in contracts issued by authorities in other parts of Iraq,” he said.

afternoon [Nov. 7], but there is always a degree of uncertainty.” BP
began evacuating the platform, because the storm was expected to
be in full force at 9 p.m. GMT time that evening.
ConocoPhillips shut down 5 of the 16 platforms in Ekofisk oil
field, which produce 140,000 boe/d. The field is between Norway
and the UK in the North Sea, about 360 km from the UK coast.
StatoilHydro halted production of 320,000 boe/d from Grane,
Visund, Oseberg South, and Heimdal fields.
Production from Veslefrikk, Huldra, and Troll C fields were not
affected, although StatoilHydro also reduced staff by 114 people
on the Veslefrikk platform and by 11 workers on the Huldra platform. Staffing at the Troll C platform also was reduced by about 20
people.
Nexen Inc. temporarily shut down the Buzzard platform after
the storms damaged the upper section of one of the three power
generation turbine exhaust stacks. The company said it did not expect production to be down for an extended period of time since
the platform can operate at full rates with two turbines.

north of Houston to handle sour gas from the Cretaceous Rodessa
formation at 12,000 ft.
The expansion is accepting 20 MMcfd of gas and is expected
to reach its 50 MMcfd capacity by the end of November, said GeoPetro Resources Co., San Francisco. MGP purchased the field’s existing 18 MMcfd treatment plant from Hanover Compression LP in
July 2005.
Upon completion of the plant expansion, GeoPetro plans to
produce the Fannin and Magness wells at rates higher than when
plant capacity was 18 MMcfd. It also plans to produce the Mitchell
well, shut-in awaiting a workover and the plant expansion, and in
early 2008 the Wilson well if a frac job is successful.
Madisonville oil and gas field was discovered in 1945 and was
developed with 125 wells in shallow zones, but the Rodessa was
left undeveloped because the gas contained hydrogen sulfide.
The Magness well, drilled n 1994, had 139 ft of net pay in
Rodessa and flowed sour gas with 28% of impurities. It flowed
12 MMcfd from 10 ft of perforations on a 22/64-in. choke with
3,915-19 psi flowing wellhead pressure. It flowed at 20.8 MMcfd
on recompletion in October 2001, and CAOF was 176 MMcfd.

Shell to design Mariisky reﬁnery upgrades
Under a two-phase, $1.3 billion investment program, Mariisky
NPZ LLC, Mari El, Russia, will upgrade its Mariisky refinery with
the support of Shell Global Solutions International BV to increase
refining capacity and meet stricter European specifications.
The 1.3-million-tonne/year Mariisky refinery produces naphtha, vacuum gas oil, diesel fuels, and kerosine from crude delivered
via the strategic Surgut-Polozk pipeline, which is 150 m from the
refinery. The refinery’s capacity will be increased to more than 4
million tonnes/year following the expansion.
Under the Phase 1 expansion, expected to cost about $1billion,
Mariisky plans to expand crude distillation capacity by adding a
crude distillation unit (CDU), a high vacuum unit (HVU), a solvent deasphalting unit (SDA), and a hydrocracker (HCU), which
will maximize kerosene and diesel production.
A Mariisky spokesman told OGJ that Shell’s feasibility study for
the proposal indicates that capacities of the new units would be:
CDU, 7,060 tonnes/stream day; HVU, 4,670 t/sd; HCU, 7,560 t/
sd; and SDA, 1,750 t/sd. “Some changes may be introduced during
[the front-end engineering and design] phase,” he added.
The parties agreed that Shell will supply the basic design packages and licenses for the CDU, HVU, and HCU units. Design work
is expected to be finished in September 2008.
Shell said the diesel produced at Mariisky would meet Euro V
specifications, while the kerosine would comply with Russian fuels
specifications and, if required, international kerosine A1 specifications, with minor modifications.
Once the first phase is finished, Mariisky plans to invest another $300 million in upgrading light-end fuels via aromatics

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
production of benzene, toluene, and mixed xylene. The refinery is
expected to become a fuel-oil-free refinery, manufacturing light,
high-value products.
The Mariisky spokesman said major unit capacities would be:
continuous catalyst regeneration unit (platformer), 2,360 t/sd;
naphtha hydrotreating unit, 3,660 t/sd; and sulfolane extraction
unit, 2,020 t/sd.
The company will evaluate laying another pipeline to the refinery from the large-volume Surgut-Polozk pipeline.

Work proceeds on Khalifa Point reﬁnery
A survey and geotechnical investigation have been completed
for the $5 billion Khalifa Coastal Refinery project planned by International Petroleum Investment Co. (IPIC) of Abu Dhabi and
Pakistan’s Pak-Arab Refinery Ltd. (Parco) near Hub in Baluchistan
Province (OGJ, Oct. 15, 2007, Newsletter).
A detailed feasibility study for the 300,000 b/d refinery will be
completed by January 2008, with the front-end engineering and
design expected by November 2008.
A construction contract is expected to be awarded by March
2009, with completion of the facility due by December 2012.
IPIC will hold 74% of the project, with Parco holding the remaining 26%.

through “super enzymes” in the next generation of biofuels. This
partnership builds on earlier collaboration that began in November
2006.
The companies will conduct research together over the next
5 years, with Shell making an equity investment in Codexis and
becoming a member of the company’s board. “Research will focus
on adapting enzymes to improve the conversion of a range of raw

materials into high-performance fuels. It will assist Shell in developing the next generation of biofuels as it explores a number of
nonfood bio materials, new conversion processes, and alternative
fuel products,” Shell said.
Codexis scientists say they have developed super enzymes that
can outperform naturally occurring varieties. This pioneering technology has been used to improve manufacturing processes for leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Merck. ✦

Crew detained after oil spill off San Francisco
US authorities have detained the all-Chinese crew of the Cosco
Busan, a containership that spilled some 58,000 gal of heavy bunker oil into San Francisco Bay after it rammed a section of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
The Cosco Busan’s entire crew is being detained aboard the
ship for questioning, according to Capt. William Uberti, head of
the US Coast Guard for Northern California. The ship was departing from the Port of Oakland for South Korea when the accident
occurred.
The crew’s detention came after Uberti notified the US attorney’s office on Nov. 10 about issues involving management and
communication among members of the bridge crew: the helmsman, the watch officer, the ship’s master, and the pilot.
After ruling out mechanical failures as a cause of the accident,
investigators were reportedly focusing on possible communication
problems between the ship’s crew, the pilot guiding the vessel, and
the Vessel Traffic Service, the USCG station that monitors the bay’s
shipping traffic.
The accident left a gash nearly 100 ft long on the side of the
926-ft vessel and ruptured two of its fuel tanks. Spillage from the
ship’s oil tanks has killed dozens of sea birds and spurred the closure of nearly two dozen beaches and piers.

Tangguh ﬁeld on schedule to export LNG
Indonesia’s Tangguh gas field will begin exporting LNG to South
Korea or China by early 2009 as scheduled, according to a senior
government official.
Kardaya Warnika, chairman of government oil and gas agency
BP Migas, said preparations at the Tangguh gas field are 80% complete, and production of LNG is expected to start in late 2008.
“The first delivery will go to either South Korea or China,” he
said, adding that, “South Korea is more prepared because it already
has a gas storing terminal.”
Current buyers for Tangguh’s output include China’s Fujian (2.6
million tonnes/year), South Korean K-Power and Posco (1.11 million tpy), and Sempra Energy on the western coast of Mexico (3.6
million tpy).
However, the Indonesian announcement coincided with reports that Mexico’s gas regulator Comision Reguladora de Energia approved the modification of the permit for the Costa Azul
LNG regasification terminal and storage facility to allow its expansion.
According to the statement, the regasification capacity of the
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Costa Azul project will be expanded to 2.6 bcfd from 1 bcfd, and
its storage capacity will be increased to 320,000 cu m through the
construction of two additional tanks.
Owned by Sempra LNG, the Costa Azul plant in Ensenada, Baja
California, is due to start operations in 2008. Sempra LNG and
Royal Dutch Shell PLC equally split the terminal’s capacity under a
20-year agreement.
Last month, BP Berau Ltd., operator of the Tangguh LNG project, announced it is considering construction of as many as eight
additional LNG trains at the company’s existing site in Papua (OGJ
Online, Oct. 26, 2007).

TransCanada to start Keystone line construction
TransCanada Corp. is preparing to begin construction in
spring 2008 on the 1,845-mile US portion of its Keystone oil
pipeline project, which will transport oil from Canada to the US
Midwest.
Keystone will total 3,456-km, including additions to existing
Canadian pipelines and mainline flow reversals. It is expected to
start up in late 2009 with the capacity to deliver 435,000 b/d of
crude oil from Hardisty, Alta., to the US at Wood River and Patoka,
Ill.
The company has entered into contracts or conditionally awarded about $3 billion for major materials and pipeline construction
contractors and is continuing to secure land access agreements.
TransCanada intends to apply to Canada’s National Energy
Board in November for additional pumping facilities to expand
Keystone’s capacity to 590,000 b/d and extend the line to Cushing,
Okla., starting in 2010.
Based on the increased size and scope of the project and the
executed material and service construction contracts, the Keystone
project cost is now estimated at $5.2 billion.
Plans to expand Keystone were announced earlier this year following the successful completion of an open season that secured
an additional 155,000 b/d of firm contracts for oil delivery from
Hardisty to Cushing (OGJ, July 16, 2007, p. 10).
The project has secured firm long-term contracts totaling
495,000 b/d for an average of 18 years. And producers and refiners
continue to express interest in contracting for additional volumes.
In response, Keystone intends to hold another binding open season
by yearend.
Keystone received NEB approval this year for two major applications to construct and operate the Canadian portion of the project.
Applications for US regulatory approvals at federal and state levels
are proceeding. ✦

Warming response
In a letter in the Oct. 15 issue, Andrew Palmer took you to task for your
attack of Rep. John Dingell’s suggestion
that government should take action to
reduce consumption as part of a climate
change policy (OGJ, Oct. 15, 2007, p.
12).
I would like to ask Mr. Palmer to
answer two questions: How much in
volume of greenhouse gases (GHGs)
are put into the air in a year? And how
much in volume of GHGs are emitted
through natural causes: i.e., volcanoes,
fires, earthquakes, hurricane, evaporation, life other than humans, etc.? The
balance is the contribution of humans.
I haven’t seen any global-warming extremists come up with these numbers. I
have seen an estimate that it is less than
4%.
Of course, we should conserve as
much as practicable—but not to the detriment of our way of life and economy.
And how about the fact that the
Southern Hemisphere has been in a
cooling stage? Oh, I forgot, that is climate change. What are we going to do
about that?

Clinton’s energy plan—2
The energy plan that US Sen. Hillary Clinton
(D-NY) recently made part of her presidential
campaign requires perspective available from a
national biofuels program already in place, which
she would expand. Like the biofuels program, her
plan makes promises it can’t fulfill and would create problems no one should ignore.
Problems that shouldn’t have been ignored
when Congress enacted sales mandates for
lavishly subsidized biofuels are now painfully
evident. Dominated by ethanol from corn as a
gasoline additive, the program is raising the price
of food. Incredibly, ethanol supporters deny this.
But the US Department of Agriculture is clear on
the subject.
“As the ethanol industry absorbs a larger share
of the corn crop, higher prices will affect domestic use and exports, providing for more intense
demand competition between domestic industries and foreign buyers of feed grains,” notes a
September article in the USDA publication Amber
Wave. Expansion of corn-growing acreage reduces
land available for other crops, including soybeans,
demand for which is being lifted by biodiesel
production. So prices of those crops rise, along
with prices of eggs and meat—especially pork and
poultry. “While the ethanol boom can be expected
to bring higher incomes to farmers and reduce
government outlays for farm programs, it will also
most likely mean higher food prices for consumers,” says the USDA article.

with subsidies of 51¢/gal for ethanol and $1/gal
for biodiesel, costs that grow as mandates expand.
Rising food prices, environmental and supply
threats to water resources, and a growing fiscal
burden are a lot to pay for a program that can’t—
no matter what its supporters say—meaningfully
extend energy supply or improve air quality.
Yet Clinton proposes more of the same with a
hugely expanded biofuels mandate—and worse.
As she has done before, she proposes to raise taxes
on the oil and gas industry to create a $50 billion
“strategic energy fund” (OGJ, June 12, 2006, p.
19). She thus would start by limiting investment
in economic energy to pay for energy that can’t
otherwise compete. Then she’d raise vehicle fuel
efficiency standards to 55 mpg by 2030, helping
automakers meet the goal by issuing $20 billion
in “green vehicle bonds.” Her plan includes a
number of other manipulations, but that $70 billion is what should raise alarm.
The Clinton program would create a slush fund
for political favors, subject to the type of parochial
influences that bred the biofuels swindle. And,
like biofuels, it’s grounded in ludicrous promises,
including cutting oil imports in 2030 by twothirds and slashing emissions of greenhouse gases
in 2050 by 80%. Those are formulas for hardship.
Displacing imported oil with costlier domestic alternatives is, by definition, expensive. And cutting
greenhouse gases by as much as Clinton proposes
would be even more so.

Water threats

Political opportunity

The push to burn food for fuel also is raising
the need for water for irrigation and threatening
water quality through increased use of fertilizer
and pesticide. “If projected future increases in
use of corn for ethanol production do occur, the
increase in harm to water quality could be considerable,” said an October report by the National
Academy of Sciences. “In addition, expansion of
corn production on fragile soils can increase loads
of both nutrients and sediments. It is vitally important to pursue policies that prevent an increase
in total loadings of nutrients, pesticides, and sediments to waterways.”
Meanwhile, biofuels sap the national treasury

Yet Clinton calls climate change “one of the
greatest economic opportunities in the history of
our country.” The opportunities would be for political friends with exotic energy to peddle and no
one else; witness the wealth transfer now under
way from taxpayers and food consumers to corn
growers and distillers.
Politicians will say anything. The hard fact is
that their energy errors hurt people by imposing
unnecessary costs. And they always err when they
make energy choices best left to markets because
they, unlike markets, base decisions on political
expediency instead of economics and physics.
The biofuels fiasco is just the latest example. ✦

Placid Refining Co. LLC began a
$200-million upgrade of its 55,000b/cd refinery in Port Allen, La. (OGJ
Online, July 23, 2007). The upgrade
will increase the facility’s gasoline production by 30% to about 1.3 million
gpd while reducing total air emissions
by about 50%. The upgrade is being
implemented in two phases.
The project’s first phase involves an

His analysis suggested that ultimate
recovery from nonconventional resources could range from 1 trillion bbl
to more than 2 trillion bbl, depending
on whether the figure is a conservative or target one. There is great scope
for improved recovery, Jum’ah stressed.
“I believe that recovery rates for oil
shale will fluctuate over time but that
the world’s need for liquid fuel supplies over the very long term, coupled
with continued advances in technology,
mean oil shales will eventually be viable
for future generations,” he said.
National oil companies (NOCs)
control 50% of the world’s proved
conventional reserves. According to
the International Energy Agency, IOCs
have rights to about 30% of global
reserves.
In contrast, Jum’ah said, nonconventional oil reserves are shared by
multinational firms. “NOCs are generally more focused on the discovery and
recovery of conventional oil, which
accounts for virtually all of their reserve
bases, while IOCs are targeting nonconventional resources to a larger extent.”
He called on IOCs, NOCs, service
companies, technology developers, and
research institutions to cooperate in
research and development.

“There are huge uncertainties associated with biofuels,” Jum’ah added. It is
“difficult to predict their contribution
to the energy mix.”
Biofuels’ growth depends on government policies and incentives rather than
market fundamentatals, he said, adding
that some biofuels demand a choice of
using crops for food or fuel.
Jum’ah recommended that energy
efficiency and using technology to
make fossil fuels more environmentally
friendly were the best ways to cut environmental impact of energy usage and
consumption.

World energy supplies
Brian Statham, chair of the WEC Energy Scenarios Study, said an “unprecedented level” of cooperation would be
needed to address the world’s energy
problems. “Almost one third of the
world’s population doesn’t have access
to energy and they don’t care about the
environment,” he said.
WEC has proposed that governments
and companies should aim to halve the
number of people without access to a
minimum level of commercial energy
to 1 billion by 2035, and halve that
again to 500 million by 2050. Green-

house gas emissions should be stabilized by 2035, and manmade emissions
should be reduced by 2050, according
to the report, Deciding the Future:
Energy Policy Scenarios to 2050. The
study focuses on policies needed for a
sustainable energy future rather than
using economic modeling to construct
scenarios.
Statham said there are sufficient
resources to meet demand. However,
major investment is needed in research
and development on energy sources
and technologies, Robert Schock, WEC
director of studies, told WEC Today.
He said $10 billion is currently spent
worldwide, but this figure is miniscule
considering the importance of energy
to the world economy which is estimated to be $50 trillion. “We need all
energy options on the table. It’s up to
countries to decide whether they want
to use nuclear or not. Energy efficiency
is important for [research and development].”
The report concluded that new concepts for public and private partnerships
would need to be developed and that
governments need to provide consistent long-term signals for companies
to make investments in the energy sector. ✦

Energy bills would cost $1 trillion, study says
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Energy legislation currently before
the 110th Congress would cost nearly 5
million jobs and drain $1 trillion from
the US economy, a study commissioned
by the American Petroleum Institute
concluded on Nov. 13.
Seven legislative proposals in bills
passed earlier this year by the House
and Senate would restrict available
energy supplies and likely increase their
costs, the study by CRA International
found.
It examined the potential economic
impacts of requiring a 10 million b/d
26

reduction from projected 2030 US oil
consumption, the use of 36 billion
gal/year of renewable transportation fuels by 2022, and more than $15 billion
in increased oil and gas industry taxes
over 10 years. It also studied potential consequences of proposals aimed
at stopping alleged oil product price
gouging and additional access restrictions and expenses in domestic oil and
gas exploration and production.
The study estimated the economic
impact of establishing a renewable
portfolio standard for electric utilities
and raising motor vehicle fuel efficiency
standards to an average 35 mpg, both
by 2020.

“This legislation would put consumers in a squeeze,” said W. David
Montgomery, a vice-president and
cohead of CRA’s energy and environmental practice in Washington. It
would reduce domestic oil production by roughly 4% and gas production by 2% during 2010-20, reduce
petroleum demand by 18% in 2020
and one-third in 2030 from projected
levels because of high prices, and cut
the average US household’s purchasing power by $1,700 and the nation’s
aggregate business investment by $219
billion by 2030, he said.

House GOP members demand energy bill with ‘energy in it’
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
Having been excluded from energy
bill discussions, US House Republicans
said they are counting on “fossil fuel
Democrats” to safeguard 2005 Energy
Policy Act provisions designed to
increase domestic oil and gas production.
Otherwise, the bill almost certainly
will accelerate already climbing crude
oil prices and increase US reliance on
imports, House GOP members said at
a Nov. 9 brieﬁng at the Capitol.
“We want an energy bill that has
energy in it,” said Minority Whip Roy
Blunt (R-Mo.). “Gasoline prices are
an average 85¢/gal higher since the
Democrats took control of Congress
in January. Markets react to what they
think Congress will do. Every proposal
the Democrats put on the table reduces
energy supplies instead of increasing
them,” he said.
Asked if he would support a bill
without tax components, Blunt said
that would not be enough to win support from House Republicans. “We
essentially embrace the principles
President Bush outlined in his letter to
Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi [(D-Calif.)],” he
said.

Governments vs. supplies
“There are large supplies of oil for
the world to continue using economically for some time,” Montgomery said.
“There simply isn’t a more efficient
or economic source of transportation
fuel. The problem is with governments,
both among politically unstable foreign
suppliers and in restricted access to
domestic supplies.”
R. Bruce Josten, executive vice-president for government affairs at the US
Chamber of Commerce, who attended
the briefing at API headquarters, said:
28

Oil shale off table
Joe Barton (R-Tex.), the Energy
and Commerce Committee’s ranking minority member, said that the
energy bill which the House passed
in August took 2 trillion bbl of shale
oil off the table by rolling back EPACT
provisions. If Democrats truly want to
reverse soaring oil prices, they should
insert Alaska National Wildlife Refuge
leasing authorization, a US Outer
Continental Shelf inventory, and oil
shale provisions into their legislation,
he suggested.
“If ANWR had gone on line 10 years
ago, it would have been producing 3
million b/d by now. If an OCS inventory had been conducted and prospects drilled, that would have given
us another 1 million or 2 million b/d,
and oil prices wouldn’t be approaching
$100/bbl,” Barton said.
“If the Democrats want an energy
bill, we’ll help them. If they simply
want higher prices to discourage consumption, they’re already getting that,”
he added.
John M. Shimkus (R-Ill.), an 11-year
member of the Energy and Commerce
Committee, mentioned the “fossil fuel
Democrats” and said that several have
told him they would like to see more
supply issues in the legislation.
“This price increase is different from
others. There’s no supply interrup-

“Congress doesn’t seem to understand
it’s not an either-or proposition. We
need energy from all available sources.
This legislation pushes us exactly in the
opposite direction. We’re already seeing impacts as consumers cut back on
purchases of other goods to pay higher
prices for gasoline and heating oil.”
Montgomery said CRA’s study used
the US Energy Information Administration’s 2007 Annual Energy Outlook as a
starting point and did not assume higher oil prices. “We’ve done pretty well
in the US with short-term oil shocks

tion such as Hurricane Katrina behind
it. This simply is a demand-driven
upward push in the price of a barrel of
crude oil,” he said, noting that prices
have climbed from $58.31/bbl when
the Democrats assumed control of
Congress in January to $98.62/bbl on
Nov. 8.

Do more with carbon
Geoff Davis (R-Ky.) said that
Democrats appear determined to leave
coal-to-liquids out of energy alternatives because of a mistaken impression that the fuel would pollute the
atmosphere. “If we’re going to have
a proactive policy, let’s give entrepreneurs a chance to do something with
carbon besides bury it. It could play a
critical part in producing biomass, for
example,” he said.
John E. Peterson (R-Pa.) said that
the energy bill which cleared the House
extends offshore natural gas leasing
bans onshore to areas such as Colorado’s Roan Plateau. “Any attempt to deal
with climate change will increase pressure on gas. We should be increasing,
not reducing, our domestic supplies,”
he said.
“You can’t move forward with an
energy bill that produces less energy.
If it produces more energy, it will also
produce Republican votes,” Blunt maintained.

since we got rid of price controls in the
early 1980s. That might be more difficult with price gouging legislation,”
Montgomery said. Bills that passed the
House and Senate would affect available
product supplies and possibly lead to
lines similar to those of the late 1970s,
he added.
A report he prepared with two other
CRA analysts, Robert E. Baron and Mary
K. Weisskopf, for Oxford University’s
September 2007 Journal of Competition Law & Economics found that the
price gouging provisions in the bills

would cost an estimated $380 million/year, assuming
that a gasoline supply disruption comparable to the
one following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005
occurs every 5 years.
The current legislation would require a 112-billion-gal (2.67 billion bbl) reduction in US petroleum
consumption in 2030 to 190.5 billion gal (4.54
billion bbl) from 302.5 billion gal (7.2 billion bbl),
the latest CRA study indicated. This would be offset
partially by increases of 5.7 billion gal (135.7 million bbl) in corn-based ethanol consumption to 20.1
billion gal (478.6 million bbl) and increases of 29.9
billion gal (711.9 million bbl) in cellulosic ethanol
consumption to 30.2 billion gal (719 million bbl).

Limited ethanol offsets
However, the offsetting effects of increased ethanol consumption would be reduced by the energy
necessary to produce it and by its having only 70%
of gasoline’s efficiency, according to Montgomery.
“It would require a substantial amount of demand
destruction to comply with the Senate bill’s mandate.
By implication, it also would involve some form of
rationing,” he said.
Reliance initially would be heavier on corn-based
ethanol, with its attendant food supply impacts, as ethanol processes for cellulose are researched and developed, he continued. While ethanol mandate proponents
say there would be environmental benefits, “it’s hard to
find a worse carbon reduction starting point,” he said.
Jobs lost as a result of the current legislation would
be heaviest in chemicals and oil refining, Montgomery said. He conceded that reducing demand and
creating an ethanol fuel infrastructure would result
in new jobs but suggested they would not pay as
well. “Replacing an $80,000/year refining job with
one that pays $25,000/year for caulking windows
to make buildings more energy-efficient is not the
same,” he said.
Additional restrictions on access to domestic oil
and gas also would limit the benefits gained from
reduced consumption, Montgomery said. The study
assumes 50% cuts in supplies on Colorado’s Roan
Plateau and from federal split estates resulting from
provisions passed by the House. US split estates hold
undiscovered resources totaling an estimated 593 million bbl of liquids and 6,947 bcf of gas, it said.
Provisions imposing a renewable fuels minimum
for electric utilities and higher Corporate Average
Fuel Economy standards for cars and light trucks are
technology mandates, Montgomery said. “Both would
interfere with the market and take away from consumers and businesses choices for meeting the goals,”
he said. ✦

Colonial CEO describes
workforce recruitment,
retention challenges
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The nation’s largest oil products
pipeline system faces the impending
retirement of a quarter of its workforce
and competition from other industries
for new employees as it prepares a
large expansion of operations, its chief
executive told a US Senate committee
on Nov. 6.
Oil and gas industry consolidation
sharply reduced employment by more
than 500,000 jobs from 1982 through
2000, Colonial Pipeline Co. President
and CEO Norm Szydlowski told the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee during a hearing on energy
industry employment.
“While Colonial’s employment
remained relatively stable during those
years, we have had to deal with the
same shrinking pool of candidates
applying for careers within the overall
industry. We are competing hard for
candidates who may have fewer skills
than candidates 10 years ago,” he said
in his written testimony.
The products pipeline has responded
by offering entry-level workers with
high school diplomas starting base
salaries around $42,000/year with shift
differentials, overtime, bonuses and
benefits, and geographic differentials
in critical markets, Szydlowski said.
Nonskilled employees potentially can
increase their annual base pay to an
average $70,000/year, while those who
become lead operators receive $84,000,
he indicated. “The competition for
engineers and more highly skilled
employees is more intense and the pay
packages accordingly climb dramatically,” he added.
Keeping qualified workers is difficult
when the trend is for them to work 2-3
years to master skills before looking for

“But an even larger contributor is the
graying of our workforce,” he told the
committee.

Szydlowski noted that the US Bureau

Chavez seeks
oil price charity

V

enezuelan President Hugo
Chavez last week said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries should devise a plan to
sell oil to poor countries at prices
lower than those paid by wealthy
nations.
“I would sell oil to a rich country
at $100[/bbl] and to a poor country perhaps at $20[/bbl],” Chavez
said in an interview on state television. “That breaks with the schemes
of capitalism....OPEC could do it,
although there are hard positions on
it, but I’m taking the issue to discuss
it.”
Chavez said, “How are you going
to sell oil to Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the world, at $100[/
bbl], the same price that you sell it
to the United States? It’s not right
ethically.”
He added, “We’re going to try
to obtain the support, if not of all
OPEC countries, of some of them,
and of other major producers to
design a formula thinking of the
coming years.”

Con su permiso?
Chavez said Venezuela is setting an
example by selling oil under preferential credit terms to Latin American
and Caribbean countries. As we have
noted, he also is selling oil at low
rates to western nations like the UK
(OGJ, Feb. 26, 2007, p. 34).
But as we also have noted, Chavez
is providing price breaks at the expense of his own people, who have
no choice in his pricing schemes.
“Con su permiso?” is how the
question is phrased in Spanish, the
question he could easily ask his

32

own people about the price their oil
is sold at. But we have yet to hear
Chavez utter it to the street urchins of
Caracas.
As one report recently noted,
“Food shortages are plaguing the
country at the same time that oil
revenues are driving a spending
splurge on imported luxury goods.”
That’s what Rory Carroll of Britain’s
Guardian newspaper reports these
days.

Food for the barrios?
Milk has all but vanished from
shops, Carroll says, while distraught
mothers ask how they are supposed
to feed their infants. Many cafes and
restaurants serve only black coffee.
Families say eggs and sugar are
also a memory. “The last time I had
them was September,” said Marisol
Perez, 51, a housewife in Petare, a
sprawling barrio in eastern Caracas. Barrio? That’s another word for
slums.
Up to a quarter of staple food supplies have been disrupted, according
to Datanalisis, a public opinion and
economic research group. To Chavez’s
detractors the scarcity shows that his
revolutionary “21st century socialism” is driving South America’s oil
power towards ruin.
We are certain the OPEC members will give Chavez’s proposals for
cheaper oil a polite hearing. In our
experience OPEC members are very
polite.
They will probably not tell Chavez
to shut up, as did Spain’s King Juan
Carlos recently. But they will doubtless not care to take his ideas much
beyond the listening stage. ✦

on our proposed project would not
begin before 2011, our forecast is that
the labor market will be as tight, if not
tighter, by that time,” he said.
Szydlowski said Colonial also has
been conducting research on possibly
transporting ethanol and other biofuels.
“As you may be aware, we are working with others to determine whether
ethanol can be transported in a steel
pipeline without inducing stress-cracking. While initial results are encouraging
and there is much work to be done and
questions to be answered, we hope to
make test shipments in 2008,” he said.
While such efforts aren’t likely to
add significantly to Colonial’s long-term
workforce needs, system modifications
to handle these fuels could create additional demand for scarce design and
construction expertise, he added.
He recommended that Congress and
the administration encourage policies
which improve technical schools and
skilled trade training, and consider providing federal tax relief to companies
offering phased retirement initiatives so
employees won’t retire solely for access
to lump sum post-career benefits.
Also, said Szydlowski, “As Congress
works on solutions to the immigration
question, please keep in mind that foreign workers represent a potential pool
of skilled workers that would address
our workforce shortages.” ✦

Proper solids control is essential for
optimum drilling fluid
performance. This article
presents a new technique
to test shaker screens,
Drilling
complementary to API
RP 13C.
The evolution of high-performance
linear and elliptical motion vibratory shakers has culminated in shaker
screens often being the only separation
device employed on a drillsite. Designating and labelling screens has been
historically controversial; screen labels
do not always correctly define the separation potential of a particular mesh. In
1993, the American Petroleum Institute
(API) issued Recommended Practice
(RP) 13E for the drilling industry; it
was a significant step forward in identifying screens with distributed aperture
sizes.1
The last 10 years have seen the introduction of multilayer screens, screens
with rectangular openings, and screens
with wave-formed surfaces. Although
these new screens offered improved
conductance and blinding resistance,
they also introduce complexities in
determining the screens’ separation
capabilities.

O D U C T I O N

For instance, a laboratory test sieve is
made of a single-layer screen cloth. The
openings are quadratic in shape and
the cut size is marked onto the sieve,
followed by a certification process. With
screens used on a shale shaker, however, there are several different types of
screen cloth, which may not have quadratic openings. It is not uncommon to
find screens with oblong openings.

Norwegians develop new method to
measure shaker screen performance
In multilayered screens, several layers
of screen cloth, having different mesh
sizes, are glued together. In this case,
the mesh sizes no longer determine
their separation capabilities.
Screens with different types of
surface and openings are used in shale
shakers. People tend to use a standard
image analysis technique, as earlier recommended by API, for arriving at some
numbers representing the separation
capability of such screens. The experience of Norwegian operators Statoil
ASA and Norsk Hydro AS (now Statoil-

Hydro ASA), however, showed that this
method of screen designation, using the
image analysis technique, was inadequate for correctly defining separation
capacity of complex screen configurations. There was a need to develop a
standardized test procedure acceptable
to both organizations.
Screen performance relies on several
other properties, including screen conductance or flow capacity, dependent on
the extensional viscosity of the drilling
fluids. Shaker motion is another issue.
38

Total blinded area will affect the flow
capacity. Screen wear affects the life of
the properties. Some screens vary in
their separation performance because
wires move during use, even though
no obvious holes are generated in the
screen. None of these extraneous effects is taken into consideration in the
present study, however. Our focus is on
the original separation performance of
the screens, measured in realistic model
drilling fluids.
Current drilling operations in

depleted reservoirs often add particles
to enhance formation strength.2 In
such cases, it is important to know the
particle size distribution of the coarser
particles in the drilling fluid. This makes
it necessary to measure both the cut
point and separation characteristics of
the screens. The method outlined in this
article was developed while keeping
in mind the approach of API RP-13C
and the needs of the oil companies that
supported this development work.3 This
procedure is seen as complementary to
the API procedure and will improve understanding of the screen performance.
Tests following API RP-13C are
conducted by sieving the selected
particles in air. Flow through a screen is
predominantly extensional. Therefore,
evaluating screening of particles for
formation strengthening requires using
a base fluid that has both a viscosity and
an extensional viscosity that are realistic
for drilling fluids.4
There is a strong connection between shaker motion and fluid viscosity.
We selected a fluid that does not change
properties with vibration5 and should
give a coarser and less sharp cut point
than tests in air would provide. The
coarser cut point will be more realistic
than a cut point measured in air.
While we acknowledge that the
present API RP-13C gives valuable
information, as did the earlier recommended practices, it does not give all
the relevant information necessary for
oil well drilling operations. The new
test procedure gives the industry some
additional necessary information. This
article describes the procedure and
thoughts behind the test development
and discusses the results obtained and
the challenges researchers still face.

A cut point curve graphically displays
the fraction of various size particles removed by the solids control equipment
compared to the quantity of that size
particle presented to the equipment. For
example, a D50 cut point is the intersection of the 50% data point on the Yaxis and the corresponding micron size
on the X-axis on the cut point graph.6
This cut point indicates the size of the
particle in the feed to the solids control
equipment that will have a 50% chance
of passing through the equipment and
50% chance of being retained by the
screens.
The values reported are D50, D16,
42

and D84. The values of D16 and D84
are selected because they are one
standard deviation from a gaussian
distribution mean. Fig. 3 shows the cut
point curve and the cut point values, as
well as the particle size distribution of
the test sand (feed Baskarp 10) and the
discard sand (coarse fraction).
Robinson and Morgan presented
the results of the work committee
establishing new API procedures on
shaker screen designations.7 The new
API procedure uses the D100 values
for aluminium oxide particles in air as
screen designations. These values define
a new type of cut point that is adequate

for most drilling operations. Previously,
shaker screens were designated by mesh
number. Screen opening and mesh
number is not uniquely defined, even
for single cloth screens, as shown by
Dahl et al.8 Therefore, we follow one of
the conclusions stated by Robinson and
Morgan: Mesh number should not be
used to designate screens.7
If particles are added for formation
strengthening,9 it is necessary to know
both the cut point and the particle
separation skewness. The skewness is
defined as S = D84/D16, where these
values are measured values and not
values determined by image analysis or
any other theoretical evaluation.
Since the D100 value does not reveal
a practical limit for the content of large
particles, a measured D50 value is more
usable for screen selection if formation
strengthening is the main focus. This
is because it is no longer sufficient to
know the maximum particle size in the
fluid equal to the D100 cut point value.
What is needed is information about
the particles that are separated from
the fluid and the particle-size distribution of the particles following the fluid
through the shaker. It is the particle-size
distribution that can prominently affect the formation and prevent further
growth of fractures.

Test procedure
The shale shaker used for the tests is
a Derrick shaker FLC 2000, modified
to suit test requirements (Fig. 4). The
screen’s deck is mounted on the fixture
as shown in Fig. 1, and this fixture is
also identified as ”A” in Fig. 4.
Real separation cut points (efficiencies) have been measured with predefined solids representing cuttings
both larger and smaller than 100 μm.
The test procedure is as follows:
1. Mount the screen deck on the
fixture.
2. Attach the fixture and screen deck
on the shale shaker.
3. Prepare the fluid and test viscosity; add xanthan gum to reach desired
viscosity.
4. Start the shale shaker.

The fourth DryTree & Riser Forum will be held in Houston, Texas this
year at the OMNI Hotel on November 28, 2007. This year’s theme,
“Deeper Water - Practical Solutions,” will present practical experiences
relating to choices when choosing drytree production systems
and deepwater riser systems. During this one-day forum, speakers
and delegates will explore the technology, tools, decision-making
processes, and functional requirements of the concept selection
and execution employing drytrees and various riser systems.

Additionally, the first six presentations are made available through a
live webcast from the conference floor and participants will be able to
attend and ask pertinent questions and share insight during the first
half of the conference. The final six presentations are closed to press
to ensure that the extremely topical discussions and timely nature of
the conference material is maintained.
Plan today to join the best minds in the industry in presenting your
knowledge, experience and expertise to a gathering of industry peers
from around the world.

History

Projections

Modeling and analyses
indicate that as long as natural gas
prices do not fall dramatically unconventional gas production will continue
to expand, particularly as investment in
improved recovery technology continues and as new plays and prospects are
developed.
As summarized in the first article in
this series (OGJ, Sept, 5, 2007, p. 35),
the US has seen a decade of progress
in unconventional gas. Annual production from all three unconventional gas
resource plays—tight gas sands, coalbed
methane, and gas shales—reached in
2006 a record 24 bcfd and proved
reserves at the beginning of 2006 were
a record 105 tcf.
Today, two out of three wells in
the US target these three natural gas
resource plays.
Contrary to views by some that unconventional gas is merely a playground
for small producers, today 9 of the 12
largest US natural gas fields produce
unconventional gas. At the top of this
list is the 3.8 bcfd produced from the
Cretaceous-age tight gas and coalbed
methane of the San Juan basin. Next in
line is the 1.4 bcfd produced from the

EIA’s projections in past
Annual Energy Outlooks.
Table 2 shows the projections
through 2005 for unconventional gas in 12 Annual
Energy Outlooks and compares these with the actual
value. For example, the 1996
outlook projected that unconventional gas production
would grow only modestly
to 2.6 tcf by 2005. Four years
later, with benefit of new
data and an improved model,
the 2000 outlook raised the
2005 production estimate to
5.6 tcf.
The actual unconventional
gas production in 2005
was about 8.0 tcf, substantially exceeding both earlier
projections. If history holds,
EIA’s projections for unconventional gas production 10
years from now may, once
again, turn out to be conservative.

March 3 – 5, 2008 / Moody Gardens Hotel & Convention Center, Galveston, Texas

SUBSEA TIEBACK
Forum & Exhibition

PennWell invites you back to the 8th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition.
SSTB has become the premier event for one of the fastest growing field
development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March 3 – 5, 2008 in
Galveston, TX at the Moody Gardens Hotel & Conference Center. Over 2,000
people and 150 exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference.You can’t
afford to miss it.
As our industry confronts new challenges, it has never been more important
to submerse yourself in them. This year’s theme is “Subsea is here, the game
is changing.” As our game changes, the sharing of knowledge and collective
experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety,
and economics of the subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by
industry leaders. As in the past, only by participating in this conference will you
be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will not be published and no
Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room
stays inside the conference room. We hope you will join us.

RECOVERY METHODS

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

THE RETHINKING CONTINUES
By rethinking recovery methods, producers have brought to a hungry market gas from reservoirs once considered economically and
technically impossible. Tight sands, shales, and coalbeds now represent large and growing sources of an essential form of clean energy.
But they’re still unconventional. The reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing
wells in them are high and rising. They present unique environmental problems.
Producing gas from unconventional reservoirs proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the
market requires continuous rethinking – the kind of thinking that shoves back limits on what’s possible
with gas supply.
Rethinking of recovery methods will continue Sept. 30 – Oct. 2, 2008, at the Unconventional Gas
International Conference & Exhibition at the Hilton Fort Worth in Fort Worth, Texas. Planned by editors
of Oil & Gas Journal and an advisory board of industry experts, the event will highlight innovation
from unconventional gas plays around the world. It will be your chance to meet and learn from other
professionals in the fastest-growing sector of the gas-producing industry.
So mark your calendar.
Plan to attend the ﬁrst annual Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition.

The US gasoline supply deficit has grown
considerably in recent
years because demand
growth has outpaced refinery output. The recent
Refining
flurry of refinery expansion and upgrade projects, however, in addition to regulations
that will increase ethanol consumption,
will reverse this
trend before the
end of the decade.
We expect the
refinery supply
deficit of gasoline
to remain broadly
constant in the
short term at just more than 50 million
tonnes; however, the addition of ethanol significantly reduces the balance. In
2006, ethanol use of 16 million tonnes
reduced the total gasoline deficit to
about 40 million tonnes.
We forecast ethanol’s contribution to grow rapidly during 2006-10,
increasing about 20 million tonnes. This
additional supply more than halves the
2010 gasoline deficit to only 16 million
tonnes. This means that less than 4% of
gasoline demand must be met with imports by 2010 vs. almost 10% currently.
Beyond 2010, because of slower demand growth and continually increasing crude processing due to refinery

capacity expansions, capacity creep, and
slightly higher utilization rates, the deficit reduces further. Our forecast shows
the US moving to balanced gasoline by
2020 (Fig. 1).

Slower gasoline growth
Gasoline is the single most important oil product in the US, accounting
for more than 40% of total demand.
Demand has grown at 1.6%/year during the past decade due to increased car
ownership and travel, whereas vehicle
fleet efficiency has changed very little.
Growth has fluctuated, depending on
the state of the economy and changes
in pump prices; in 2002, demand
grew nearly 3%, whereas in 2005, the
increase was as little as 0.6%. Demand
will grow at 1%/year through 2010,
with growth subsequently slowing and
eventually stagnating by yearend 2020.
The amount of ethanol blended into
the US gasoline pool has risen sharply
during the last 5 years, particularly
since the phaseout of methyl tertiary
butyl ether in 2006. The amount of ethanol blended will likely reach 18.5 million tonnes (6.1 billion gal) in 2007,
almost three times the amount used in
2002. This is beyond the level dictated
by the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS)
passed in 2005, which requires 4.7 billion gal of renewable fuels by this 2007.
Ethanol demand should continue to

*Includes planned reﬁnery investment up to 2013. Reﬁnery supply includes MTBE before 2006, but does not include ethanol.

We therefore forecast total gasoline
demand to grow to 432 million tonnes
by 2020 from 400 million tonnes in
2006. Due to increased ethanol consumption, however, demand for refinery gasoline will remain static at around
today’s level of 385 million tonnes
during the next 15 years.

Higher gasoline production
Refinery production of gasoline will
grow by 40 million tonnes 2006-20
due to the combined effects of slightly
increased refinery utilization rates, additional crude and upgrading capacity
from planned projects, and the effect of
capacity creep.

Utilization rates will increase by
2010 from the low rates seen in 2005
and 2006 (due to refinery shutdowns
and maintenance caused by Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita, and one-time events
such as the BP Texas refinery explosion)
but will not be at their maximum due
to a number of project tie-ins that year.
From 2010 onwards, we expect that
utilization rates may increase further
but we do not believe that they will
exceed the levels in 2004, which were
93%. An increased safety and reliability
focus in refinery processing, in addition to the processing to tighter-quality
specifications, is unlikely to allow rates
to rise higher than this.

We forecast total additional crude
capacity (currently planned and we
believe to be realistic) to be about 0.94
million b/d by 2013, of which around
500,000 b/d will be on stream by
2010. Some small expansions will add
about 435,000 b/d of crude capacity to existing sites. Two major crude
expansion projects are the 180,000b/d expansion at Marathon Oil Corp.’s
Garyville, Ind., refinery, expected to
start up in 2010 and the 325,000-b/d
expansion of Motiva’s Port Arthur, Tex.,
refinery, which we have assumed will
be completed in 2011.
Due to the large number of expansion projects, we do not believe creep
will have much effect in the short to
medium term; therefore, the majority
of creep will increase capacity in the
2012-20 period in which projects have
not yet been planned.

Reﬁnery supply growth

The deficit in the refinery supply
of gasoline has grown considerably in
recent years, increasing to 55 million
tonnes in 2006 from 23 million tonnes
in 2000. We expect the deficit, however,
to start to decline gradually because increases in crude and upgrading capacity
will grow refinery supply at a slightly
faster rate than demand growth.
The deficit will fall to 45 million
tonnes by 2020 (Fig. 3). This is before
accounting for the effects of ethanol.

Modeling the corrosivity of liquids
transported over the life of a pipeline can determine the current
PIPELINE INSPECTION— condition of pipelines in which
in-line inspection is not possible.
Conclusion
Such modeling also allows development of a risk-based approach
to extending asset life.
The first part of this two-article
series (OGJ, Nov. 5, 2007, p. 92) described the parameters of the riskbased approach and
presented the first
of two case studies in which use of
uncertainty modeling helped assess a
pipeline’s current condition.
This second, concluding, article presents the second case study.

A North Sea operator with an extensive subsea pipeline network experienced difficulty in performing inline

Proper integrity management, however,
required system-wide assurance of

own provide confidence
in the condition of the subsea section
of the pipelines and therefore does not
satisfy corporate requirements for the
assurance of the integrity of each of
the pipelines. The operator therefore
decided to carry out a comprehensive
assessment of all pipelines using the
statistical modeling-based approach.
Using this approach to develop a
written scheme for examination (WSE)
for each pipeline provides an auditable
trail and clearly identifies corrosion
threats and mitigation measures.
The ages of the pipelines in the
network vary considerably, and they
carry a variety of substances, from dry
gas to wet oil to methanol. Consistently
assessing the integrity of each pipeline
establishes an overall picture of asset
condition across the network.
This case study demonstrates the
process of developing a WSE for one of
the operator’s gas pipelines.

with much of what does exist held by
inaccessible legacy data systems. The
quality of the data is also often poor.

this example captures tacit knowledge
and embeds it in a software system that
can be updated annually.
Extensive data collection and interpretation took place. Discussions with
the operator, review of production
profiles for each offshore asset, and
review of design and operating data for
appropriate reservoirs allowed reasonable estimation of the following key
corrosion-related input parameters:
• Operating conditions (temperature,
pressure, and flow rates).
• Reservoir parameters (CO2 content
and water cut).
• Reservoir water chemistry (bicarbonate and total dissolved solids).
• Chemical injection philosophy
(estimates against target levels).
• Pigging philosophy (estimates
against target levels).
• Pipeline physical parameters (e.g.
design code, material of construction,
nominal wall thickness, original corrosion allowance, etc.).
Each of the input parameters for
each of the defined operating periods
then receives a range of credible values.
The data collected and national production statistics for the region allow identification of major operating changes in
the pipeline life, including the tie-in of
new wells and reservoirs.

New laser technology gives fast moisture detection
New water moisture and carbon dioxide analyzer technology is available that
uses tunable laser diode (TDL) spectros-

copy to provide accurate and virtually
instantaneous measurements of trace gas
amounts of H2O or CO2 in the LNG liquefaction process.
By its nature, the TDL based gas detection method is not susceptible to aging
affects, making its factory calibration a
timeless constant, the company points
out. The result is a low maintenance analyzer that does not require consumables
or scheduled calibration.
The system consists of a cell that the
sample gas flows through, a tunable laser
diode that emits a specific wavelength of
light through the gas, an optical detector,
and software to analyze and output the
results.
The technology, which the firms says
is considered a new standard in natural
gas measurement, is fast, and the results
are reliable. Changes in gas concentrations
during dehydration can be seen immediately, without the wet-up and dry-down
delays that occur with traditional moisture
analyzers, the company says. Furthermore,

this TDL sensor does not become desensitized or drift over time.

Failure to enact
bad energy bill
would be triumph
Given what it has to work with, the 110th
Congress will not have failed on energy if it
enacts no legislation on the subject.
A conservative observer nevertheless
discredits the Democratic leadership for its
failure so far win enactment of an energy bill.
In a Nov. 9 article in Wall Street Journal’s
online Opinion Journal, former White
House political mastermind Karl Rove catalogues bloopers committed by the House

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

and Senate since Democrats regained control: unbridled spending, proposals to raise
taxes, failure to pass a budget, security
lapses, and preoccupation with investigations of political opponents.
But in a list of “Congress’s failures” to
enact legislation, Rove includes an energy
bill.
“Congress has not done its work,” he
says of this list. “And these failures will
have consequences.”
In fact, the consequences of failure to
pass energy law as proposed would be
altogether constructive.
Congress doesn’t intend to do anything
to expand oil and gas supply, such as allow
leasing of closed federal land.
Instead it proposes to punish oil and gas
companies with tax increases, distribute
proceeds among politically favored producers of tiny amounts of uneconomic energy,
and expand an ethanol mandate that’s raising food and energy costs.
A strategy of suppressing growth of oil
and gas supply and replacing it fractionally
with costlier alternatives is supposed to
promote energy security.
It won’t. It can’t. It will raise energy costs.
That’s senseless. But that’s what will happen if this Congress passes an energy bill.
The idea that passage of no energy bill
constitutes failure ﬂows from the liberal assumption that market distress compels the
government to act.
Oil prices above $95/bbl indeed signal a
market in distress—a market trying to grow
against limits to supply.
In response to such distress, the priority
and perhaps only appropriate action by
government is removal of whatever supply
limits it may itself have imposed, such as
leasing moratoriums.
Proposals before the 110th Congress
promise the opposite—further limits on oil
and gas supply coupled with subsidization
of expensive substitutes.
For US energy consumers, failure to
enact this folly would represent not failure
but triumph.

M a r k e t

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

High crude price divides market
With front-month benchmark US crude touching a record high of $98.62/bbl in
overnight electronic trading Nov. 7, the oil market essentially split into two main
groups, said Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc. in London.
One group sees the possibility of $100/bbl oil “as being almost magical in that it
is the result of external and near mystical forces and supposedly unconnected with
any real fundamentals,” Horsnell said. “Explanations include a weak dollar, speculation, and, most entertainingly of all, negative gamma from options positions.” However, he said, “In our view, none of those factors are particularly signiﬁcant. Indeed,
they miss the main point. If the supply side still looks bust above $90/bbl, then prices
are rising simply because they are too low.”
Horsnell puts himself in the opposite group who claim the recent spike in crude
prices resulted from “worsening supply-side weakness” and “steady but not spectacular demand growth” among countries outside of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. “For us, the main question is whether we have seen
any more sign of an amelioration as prices approach $100/bbl than we saw when
prices approached $70/bbl.” He said, “If anything the supply-side is now looking
weaker short term, medium term, and longer term. In other words, the path of least
fundamental resistance still seems to lie to the upside.”
An opposing view
Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research Inc.,
Amherst, Mass., ﬁnds it “hard to credit” a paradigm shift in the oil market “where
oil is much harder to discover and produce than before, demand is growing much
faster, and prices have much less effect on demand. Lynch said. “Demand growth at
present is one-half to two-thirds the long-term trend, and while Chinese oil demand
is growing rapidly this year, it is growing much more slowly than in the past—about
6% versus 8-10% previously. The easy oil didn’t suddenly disappear 5 years ago, and
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ surplus capacity has been low
for most of the last decade and a half, without prices soaring.”
The push towards $100/bbl crude “seems to have been driven more by hedge
funds and traders, that is, speculators not investors, (over)reacting to relatively unimportant news,” said Lynch. “However, while a short-term reversal taking prices back to
$70-80/bbl is probable in the next few weeks as speculators sell off, the ‘investors’ who
have been buying energy derivatives for several years are less likely to pull out.”
Price drops have two causes: overﬂowing inventories or a price war within OPEC
(or between OPEC and non-OPEC), Lynch said. “The latter often causes the former,
but not always,” he said. “The market next year appears increasingly likely to experience a sharp price drop, especially from current elevated levels but probably even
below the $75/bbl or so that many forecasters expect, as it appears that weak oil demand combined (possibly) with unexpected additional supply from Iraq and Nigeria
will mean that surplus capacity in OPEC will grow by as much as 2 million b/d.
Lower production
Lynch sees improvement in two important producing areas. “Iraq has been able
to operate its Ceyhan export pipeline at nearly 50% capacity (or 300,000 b/d) for
about 2 months now, reportedly due to better security on the pipeline, which had
previously been sabotaged whenever it operated,” he said Nov. 12. “Royal Dutch
Shell PLC is in the process of restoring its Nigerian production, as the new Nigeria
President Umaru Yar’Adua is attempting to stabilize that region through negotiation.
Neither is guaranteed to result in long-term resolution, but it is important to remember that there are upside production risks as well as downside. (That upside could
easily mean an additional 500,000 b/d of production next year, which isn’t factored
into current projections.)” Horsnell noted third quarter oil production by some major
integrated oil companies was “rather poor.” Combined production from Shell, BP
PLC, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil Corp., Chevron Corp., and Total SA fell 720,000 b/d,
or 6.2%, to 10.86 million b/d from the third quarter of 2006.
“These output falls from major companies are not in themselves directly responsible for $100/bbl oil,” Horsnell said. “However, they are strongly symptomatic of a
mounting supply-side weakness, particularly within non-OPEC areas, that is in our
view one of the main reasons why prices have been testing ever higher. If major oil
companies have in general been ﬁnding it difﬁcult to increase output even after a
multiyear rise in prices, a fairly powerful signal about the sustainability of the upwards trend does appear to have been sent.”

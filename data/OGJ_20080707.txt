COVER
Foster Creek, the first commercial steam-assisted gravity drainage
(SAGD) project to come on stream, began producing bitumen
in 2001. Production is from the McMurray formation in the
southern part of Alberta’s Athabasca oil sands region.The EnCana
Corp.-operated project currently produces about 30,000 b/d of
bitumen.With future expansions, production may reach 150,000
b/d.Two articles in the week’s special report, Oil Sands Update,
starting on p. 51, describe the latest status of the reserves, production, and marketing of the vast bitumen resources found in the oil
sands of Alberta. Photo from EnCana.

Minimizing wear, extending service life
InnerArmor coatings can be created from a
wide range of materials, and also in layers,
for unprecedented sliding-wear properties and
exceptional wear resistance.

GE
Oil & Gas

Efﬁciency:
it’s genetic
It starts with the right people and it ends with the right solution.
With over 40 years of experience, GE’s Oil & Gas business is a
recognized leader in turbocompression packages for large pipelines.
A perfect example is the PGT25+G4 which was recently installed
as the core unit driving 14 compressor stations across a 3,700-km
North American mainline system. The PGT25+G4 is a two-stage,
high-speed power turbine coupled with an enhanced gas generator
using proven aeroderivative technology that achieves signiﬁcantly
higher efﬁciency and availability than non-aero alternatives. The
unit offers 34-MW power output and 41% thermal efﬁciency – the
highest in its class. At 6,100 RPM, it can directly drive a compressor
without a gearbox in most oil and gas applications, and comes in
both standard and dry-low emissions (DLE) versions.
Turbocompression efﬁciency – it’s in our DNA.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Brazil plans oil law changes, oil management ﬁrm costs of compliance and administration for industry and governBrazil’s Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao plans to propose to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva the creation of a new
state-run firm that would manage oil discoveries made in recent
months in the subsalt layer of the Santos basin.
Lobao, who is responsible for developing a new model for oil
exploration, is scheduled to present a study on the matter within
60 days, according to a report in Valor Economico business newspaper.
The paper reported that Lobao—after considering suggestions
received in recent weeks—is convinced that the best solution for
the country is to adopt a production-sharing regime, which would
require legislation changes to Brazil’s Petroleum Law.
In countries where this regime has been implemented, the paper said, state-owned companies have the role of deciding on production levels and supervising exploration in fields.
According to Lobao, the new state firm would neither drill wells
nor extract oil but would hire government-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA or other firms as service suppliers.

Australia’s Offshore Petroleum Act 2006 in effect
The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 (PSLA)—Australia’s primary legislation for the administration of its offshore petroleum resources since the riches of Bass Strait were discovered
and first produced in the 1960s—was replaced July 1 with the new
Offshore Petroleum Act 2006 (OPA).
Martin Ferguson, resources and energy minister, says the new
act will make the legislation easier to understand and will reduce

Exploration

&

ment.
However, he said there are no changes to major policies or the
current management regime.
The OPA received Royal Assent in March 2006 but could not
be proclaimed until all states and territories had updated their offshore petroleum legislation. This was completed when Tasmania
amended its legislation on June 16.

UK oil participants agree to share best practices
Offshore operators and contractors in the UK have agreed to
share experiences and best practices on the design and development of new learning products and services under a major partnership to help address the skills shortage in the oil and gas industry.
OPITO-The Oil & Gas Academy and the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board (ECITB) will work with Oil & Gas UK
and the Offshore Contractors Association.
“As well as allowing for improved quality and transferability of
the skills pool leading to increased safety and overall business performance, the new alliance will also provide a combined menu of
skills and training solutions for operators and contractors,” OPITO
said.
ECITB Chief Executive David Edwards said, “The changing business models within the industry means that more alignment is
needed to address the skills priorities. Working together will make
this happen more quickly and effectively whilst ensuring duplication of effort and cost is eliminated over time.” ✦

Development

Lukoil, ConocoPhillips start W. Siberia ﬁeld
A joint venture of OAO Lukoil and ConocoPhillips has begun
first-stage oil and gas production from Yuzhno Khylchuyu field in
the Nenets Autonomous District of northwestern Siberia, Russia.
The first 32 development wells in the arctic field are producing
oil through a 98-mile, 21-in. pipeline to the Varandey oil export
terminal on Kola Bay on the Barents Sea. The field’s oil is 35.5°
gravity with 0.71% sulfur, better than Russia’s 32° gravity, 1.3%
Urals export blend.
Discovered in 1981, Yuzhno Khylchuyu field has more than 500
million bbl of proved oil reserves. It is considered one of the largest fields in Russia’s Timan Pechora oil and gas province and the
anchor field for an overall $4 billion in developments by the joint
venture.
Interests in the OOO Naryanmarneftegaz joint venture, established in 2005, are Lukoil 70% and ConocoPhillips 30%.
Besides the 32 wells, the first stage comprises a 3.8 million

tonne/year oil treatment unit; an oil desulfurization unit; a 40,000
cu m tank farm; a pump station; a 17-mile, 11-in. Yareyu-Yuzhno
Khylchuyu high-pressure gas pipeline; a 370 million cu m gas
treatment plant; a 125-Mw power supply complex; and 178 miles
of 220 kv high-voltage transmission lines.
Second-stage start-up planned for December involves 32 new
wells, doubling the capacity of the oil treatment unit, and adding a
compressor station and sulfur disposal and storage facilities.
Design capacity is projected at 150,000 b/d in 2009. Crude is
to be loaded from floating storage at Varandey onto 70,000 dwt
tankers for shipment to Europe and North America.

axis of the Lake Albert Rift basin, is significant because it upgrades
several other prospects to be drilled later.
Tullow will not test the well, as it wants to assess the results of
its other wells after it finishes regional drilling. Ngege-1 reached
a TD of 640 m and was drilled some 3 km from the crest of the

BLM posts ﬁnal EIS for Pinedale Anticline area
The final supplemental environmental impact statement for the
Pinedale Anticline Project Area (PAPA) in Wyoming is available, the
US Bureau of Land Management said on June 26.
The FSEIS is part of a US Department of the Interior analysis of
a proposal by Questar Market Resources Co., Shell Exploration &
Production Co., and Ultra Petroleum Inc. The three producers have
proposed conducting year-round drilling and completions within
the PAPA, BLM said.
BLM added that the FSEIS is not a decision document, but is designed to inform the public and interested agencies of environmental and socioeconomic impacts that could result from the project and
to evaluate alternatives.
Additional information acquired from public comments and
from internal reviews could result in the selection of an alternatives
or group of alternatives to provide the best operating practices,
impact mitigation and management practices to reduce environmental harm, BLM said.

Cabinda Gulf installs Angola gas platform
Chevron Corp. subsidiary Cabinda Gulf Oil Co. Ltd. has successfully installed the Takula gas processing platform on Block 0 off
Angola. Commissioning and start up is expected to happen during
the third quarter.
AMEC Paragon was the engineering contractor for the project.
The platform is in 57 m of water with the capacity to process
100 MMscfd of sour gas for injection and delivery to the new onshore Cabinda gas plant. It is bridge-linked to an existing platform
and is a single-train facility designed as a 5,000-tonne, single-lift
modular deck.

option for future work in the area. Design has begun, and materials
specification is under way. Production is scheduled to start by yearend 2009. Nini East holds an estimated 17 million bbl of oil.
Bladt Industries will work with Saipem UK to design, produce,
and install both the jackets and topsides and develop a pipeline to
connect Dong’s Nini and Cecilie fields to the Siri platform where
oil will be treated and shipped. Total platform weight will reach
about 3,500 tons. Fabrication should take 15 months, after which
it will be towed, installed, and commissioned.
Total investment, including a pipeline between Nini and Nini
East, is 2.1 billion kroner.

Oxy to acquire interest in Joslyn oil sands project Petrobras, Mitsui sign ultradeepwater contract
Occidental Petroleum Corp. signed an agreement with Enerplus
Resources Fund to purchase a 15% interest in the Joslyn oil sands
project in northeastern Alberta for $500 million (Can.).
Joslyn, operated by France’s Total SA, holds more than 8 billion bbl of bitumen in place. While still in the early stage of development, Joslyn currently has more than 1,800 delineation wells
drilled and is being developed by steam assisted gravity drainage
(in process) and surface mining. Oxy plans to spend $2 billion to
develop the reserves, the company said.
Enerplus acquired a 16% interest in Joslyn in 2002 and subsequently sold a 1% interest to Laricina Energy Ltd. in early 2006 in
exchange for common stock in that company. Enerplus will have
invested $115 million in its 15% interest in Joslyn.

Transocean Inc.’s subsidiaries reached an agreement with subsidiaries of Petrobras and Mitsui to acquire a newbuild ultradeepwater drillship under a capital lease contract.
The currently unnamed newbuild is under construction at Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. yard in Geoje, South Korea.
Costs to be incurred by Petrobras and Mitsui for the drillship’s
construction are estimated at $750 million.
The rig will feature Transocean’s patented dual-activity drilling
technology, allowing for parallel drilling operations in deepwater
well construction.
Transocean said the rig will have a variable deckload of more

Construction begins on Marathon Detroit reﬁnery
Marathon Oil Corp. has begun construction of the $1.9 billion heavy oil upgrading project at its Detroit refinery following
issuance of an air quality permit by the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality.
The project will include an additional 80,000 b/d of heavy oil
capacity and increase the total refining capacity to 115,000 b/d
from 102,000 b/d. The increased capacity will supply more than
400,000 gpd of additional transportation fuels to the marketplace.
The project is expected to be completed in late 2010.
Fluor Corp. will provide integrated engineering, procurement,
and construction services.
Construction on an associated 29-mile pipeline in Monroe and
Wayne counties, Mich., is expected to begin in second-quarter
2009 and complete in 2010.

ERG will have a 51% share in the JV and Lukoil may be able to
increase its stake in the future under the agreement. Both parties
require approval from the European Commission and other antitrust bodies.
The complex 320,000 b/d Isab refinery is on the coast and will
meet growing middle distillate demand in Europe, mainly kerosine
and diesel fuel.
According to their equity stake, ERG and Lukoil will source its

own share of oil to refine and market the products. “The Isab refinery has the flexibility to process crudes such as Urals, and Lukoil
intends to fully integrate its share of the refinery into its supply
chain,” Lukoil said.
Lukoil Pres. Vagit Alekperov said the company’s refining capacity
would increase by 13% and its overseas refining capacity by 60%.
“The refinery’s advantageous location and an opportunity to process Russian crude make this project very attractive.” ✦

Five planned LNG terminals in Italy move forward
Italy’s privately-held Anonima Petroli Italiana SPA, Rome, applied for approval from the country’s Environment Ministry for an
offshore regasification terminal with an capacity of about 4 billion
cu m/year.
The facility will be located in the Adriatic Sea in front of Anonima Petroli’s Falconara refinery. After converting the LNG, the company will inject the gas into Snam Rete Gas SPA’s grid. Construction
will take just over 5 months.
The news coincided with reports that Gas Natural could win
environmental clearance for an 8 billion cu m regasification terminal it wants to develop at Trieste in northern Italy. An official at
the environment ministry confirmed that Gas Natural’s LNG facility
had received positive opinions from a series of subcommittees at
the ministry, and it said the project could be approved or a series of
observations on the plans could be made.
In June, Iride SPA and CIR SPA’s unit Sorgenia SPA said their
planned 12 billion cu m regasification terminal at Gioia Tauro,
which won environmental approval in April, has been granted access to European Union funding. The Gioia Tauro terminal is due
to go online in 2013.
In early May, Royal Dutch Shell and Italy’s ERG received local
authorization to build their planned joint Ionio LNG import terminal in Sicily. The partners hope to begin construction of the import
terminal in 2010 and to have it operational by 2013, according to
ERG’s power and gas division head Raffaele Tognacca.
Later in May, following a feasibility study completed early this
year on its Triton LNG project 30 km off Italy’s Marches region in
the Adriatic Sea, Gaz de France signed a joint development agreement with Oslo-based Hoegh LNG for the design, construction,
and operation of a floating storage and regasification unit vessel
(OGJ Online, May 30, 2008).

Maryland LNG project wins CZMA appeal
US Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez overturned one state’s
objection to a proposed LNG project but upheld another as the US
Department of Commerce issued two federal consistency appeals
decisions on June 26.
The secretary ruled against Maryland’s objection to AES Sparrows Point LLC and Mid-Atlantic Express LLC’s proposal to build an
LNG facility east of the Port of Baltimore on Chesapeake Bay. However he upheld an objection by Massachusetts to Weaver’s Cove Energy LLC and Mill River Pipeline LLC’s proposal to build an LNG
terminal and pipeline near Fall River.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

Sponsors of each project had appealed to a rule after the state
had determined that the project was not consistent with its plan
under the Coastal Zone Management Act. Under CZMA, federal
agencies may not issue permits for a project unless the Commerce
secretary overrides the state’s consistency objection on appeal.
In a decision announced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of General Council for Ocean Services, Gutierrez overrode Maryland’s objection after determining
that the national interest, which would be served by the Sparrows
Point project, outweighs its limited adverse coastal effects.
The proposed terminal and associated pipeline would help meet
regional energy demand by providing enough natural gas capacity to heat about 3.5 million homes daily or to generate enough
electricity each day for about 7.5 million homes, the decision indicated. The impact of dredging on fish and aquatic vegetation would
not be significant, Gutierrez said.
The decision means sponsors of the Sparrows Point project can
continue to pursue federal permits and licenses, but will still be
required to comply with all state and local permitting regulations
and complete all required environmental reviews.
A timetable at the project’s web site anticipates that the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission will complete a final environmental impact statement by Aug. 15 and issue a certificate by Nov. 20.
In the Massachusetts decision, Gutierrez upheld the state’s objection because it determined that adverse coastal effects, particularly navigational concerns associated with tankers traveling up the
Taunton River to deliver LNG to the terminal outweighed the project’s national interest.

LNG construction approved for the Netherlands
Dutch Economy Minister Maria van der Hoeven approved construction of the Netherlands’ first LNG import terminal in Rotterdam.
The €800 million Gate terminal, a project of Neder Nederlandse
Gasunie NV and Royal Vopak, will consist of three storage tanks
with a capacity of 180,000 cu m each and one jetty. The terminal
will have an initial throughput capacity of 9 billion cu m (bcm)/
year, which can be increased to 16 bcm/year in the near future.
A consortium comprised of Techint Group, Sener Ingenieria y
Sistemas SA, Entrepose Contracting, and Vinci Construction PLC
will build the terminal, which will come online in second half
2011, at a cost of €800 million. Dutch port operator Havenbedrijf
Rotterdam NV will invest €60 million in basic infrastructure as
the project will significantly strengthen its position as an energy
port. ✦

Global warming response
It is well known that the hydrocarbon
industry, by its very nature, is responsible for a large share of the production
of products which go on to become
greenhouse gases. Some elements of
the industry have historically been very
conservative in their outlook towards
environmental matters, not least in the
historical heartland of the industry,
the US. Hence telling the hydrocarbon
industry that its products are the cause
of global warming has been rather like
telling a young mother that her baby is
ugly. It is undoubtedly difficult to argue
the effects of global warming, which has
proven to confront the comfort zone of
some people in those industries–never
an easy task. This is often because the
data are not clear-cut but rest on the
basis of probabilities but which, in the
opinion of experts, indicate that the
cause and effects are pretty certain. Too
many people make judgments on the
micro level (e.g., the weather today),
whilst not having access to the macro
information on world climate changes
(e.g., melting glaciers).
Global warming is a global problem, which requires a global solution,
and unless we get the energy industries
on board, including those in the US,
any attempts to solve this problem are
doomed. It is disappointing that, despite
substantial and substantiated evidence,
we continue to see letters such as that
from DeForrest Smouse, which counters
the learned (and mostly independent,
despite what he wants to think) bodies
of opinion (OGJ, June 2, 2008, p. 12).
When we outside America hear Americans like Mr. Smouse say, “We need a
concerted effort to stop the scare tactics
of those whose major purpose is in opposition to the economic stability of the
advanced nations of the world,” we are
saddened.
America, please wake up. Please
remove your prejudices. Please read the
huge information available. A good place
to start would be with the final Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
report, found at http://www.ipcc.ch/
pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.

operation you demand from your plant takes an
experienced team and technical know-how.
Emerson’s global Oil & Gas industry experts help you
apply today’s PlantWeb ® predictive digital technologies
for a smart plant built to deliver optimized, reliable
operations now and into the future.

temperature increase the coker
charge rate by 25% or more? Yes
…with current unrealistic vacuum column design! The proper
design is one which can provide
minimum coker charge with
design features that incorporate
efficient residue stripping and
low column operating pressure.
If you design your vacuum unit
correctly you can indeed expect
to achieve a 975°F VGO cutpoint
and a 5-6 year run length. But it
won’t come from conventional
cheap unit designs. If the wrong
designs are used it could mean
replacing the heater, having to
add residue stripping and new
ejector systems. The revamp can
cost 40% of a new unit. The
choice is yours. Pay now or pay
through the nose later.

The Myth of the

crudes will come to make-up a
substantial fraction of feedstocks
to North American refineries.
Today, however, for the most part
refiners both north and south of
the 40° parallel seem to be
unaware of the extreme challenges this change will present.
To run an oil sands crude in a
vacuum unit designed for conventional heavy feedstocks and
to expect a 1000°F cutpoint for a
5-6 year run is like believing in

crudes are ultra-heavy, fouling,
hard to desalt, corrosive, thermally unstable and tough to vaporize
in the vacuum column flash zone
even at elevated temperatures.
Can any crude oils be nastier to
cope with?
First and foremost, heater outlet
temperature can be no higher
than 725°F and possibly lower
to avoid extremely high cracked
gas rates and rapid coke laydown. Even at these reduced
temperatures the heater tubes
must be double-fired, coil steam
rates high, coil layout correct, oil
mass velocity high and heater
outlet pressure selected properly.
But won’t lower heater outlet

A last word: Because process and
equipment design is critical when
processing oils sands crudes,
know-how and actual experience
designing units to process these
feedstocks can make the difference between success or possibly
disastrous reliability and yields.

For a more thorough discussion of
cutpoint ask for Technical Papers
236 and 237.

Oil sands: the short view
Canadians know energy short-sightedness
when they see it. This quality distinguishes them
from their neighbors to the south.
Election-year goofiness targeting the oil sands
of Alberta has nearly escaped notice in the US. But
it’s creating an uproar in Canada.
Well it should. The oil sands represent a worldclass resource. Their development dominates—
some say overheats—the Albertan economy and
accounts for much of the economic growth of all
of Canada. Oil sands and heavy oil have the potential to generate wealth for many decades. And a
market needing oil lies just across the border.

Fickle market
But that market is fickle. A few politicians have
discovered that the production of oil sands and
heavy oil emits more greenhouse gases than that
of most conventional oil. They see this as a reason
to shun the development and use of unconventional hydrocarbons. Their choosiness plays into
the hands of extremists who want humanity to
quit burning hydrocarbons of any type.
Congress initially raised alarm about the environmental drawbacks of oil sands with a section
in last year’s Energy Independence and Security
Act that seems to prohibit federal agencies from
buying fuels derived from unconventional crude.
Lawmakers have said they didn’t intend to impose
such a ban. An effort to clarify the measure is
under way.
The idea, however, won’t die. Last month the
US Conference of Mayors adopted a resolution
modeled on the federal initiative. It called for
bans on purchases for use in city vehicles of any
fuel with life-cycle emissions of greenhouse gases
deemed excessive. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who spoke at the meeting,
later took an apparent jab at oil sands with a comment about “dirty, dwindling, and dangerously
expensive” oil.
These developments have received little attention
in the US. In Canada, however, they’re big news. A
June 26 article in the Calgary Herald, for example,
said grumbles about oil sands in the US have stimulated efforts to develop markets elsewhere.
Political revulsion toward oil sands serves no

legitimate interest and highlights the confusion
rampant in US discussions of energy. A country
with an appetite for oil as strong as that of the
US—an appetite that will remain hearty no matter
what policies the nation adopts—can’t afford to
spurn supply from any source. It also can’t afford
to appear hypocritical in international affairs, as
the US so often does on energy.
The country perpetually regrets its dependence
on oil from far-off exporters thought to be hostile,
for example, yet now resists supply from a friendly
and nearby neighbor. It frets about the reliability
of supply from foreign producers yet gives no apparent thought to its own reliability as a consumer.
For persuasive economic reasons, the US so far has
refused to adopt limits on emissions of greenhouse gases. But it doesn’t hesitate to act on climate change when the target is an energy resource
central to the economy of another country—a
country that happens to be a premier ally.
What’s more, resistance to the use of products
derived from bitumen and heavy oil conflicts with
environmental values. Contrary to the unrealistic
wishes driving energy politics, the US and the
world will continue to use oil in large amounts
for many decades. The substance has advantages
of scale and form against which nonhydrocarbon
energy sources can’t easily compete. Energy policy
should aim not to eradicate the use of oil and
other fossil energy but rather to manage the environmental consequences of that use while helping other energy forms gain economic traction as
supply supplements.

A laboratory
The oil sands of Alberta present nearly every
environmental and social problem associated with
oil development and consumption. They also offer
the immediate economic compulsion to find solutions. Alberta thus is a commercial-scale laboratory
from which energy companies, governments, and
environmental groups can learn much about managing the disadvantages of fossil energy in order to
responsibly exploit the many advantages.
To foreclose such important work, as the US
initiatives obviously seek to do, indeed would be
short-sighted. It also would be irresponsible. ✦

‘Silent disruption’
limiting oil supply
Lucian Pugliaresi

T E R E S T
Recent increases in the price of
oil result largely from a collision of
demand growth with what might be
called a “silent disruption” to worldwide supply.
Like past constrictions to the delivery of crude oil and oil products, the
current phenomenon has raised prices
as much by lowering expectations for
future supply as by immediately removing physical volumes from the market.
Unlike past disruptions, this one lowers
expectations not by way of a single
event, such as a war or natural disaster,
but rather through a series of mostly
geopolitical developments that together
impede investment.
The combined effects of those developments, important among which
is a surge in resource nationalism, have
lowered expectations for global oil supply during 2005-10 by 2.5-4.5 million
b/d (see table).

grown robustly (see figure).
When the events highlighted in the
figure occur, not only does the world
oil market lose existing production, but
expectations on the availability of future
supplies are revised downward.
A recent or perhaps recurring trend
is resource nationalism, wherein host
nations change the terms of their contracts with international oil companies
(IOCs) that are developing indigenous
oil and gas resources. Encouraged by
the swift escalation of oil prices in recent years, this trend is now spreading
rapidly. Venezuela’s 2007 nationalization plan led to a significant decline in
investments and even the expulsion and
banning of ExxonMobil from the country. Foreign direct investment in 2007
declined by about 50% compared with
the yearly average during 2003-06.

Iraq

Produced 2.4 million b/d 1999-2002. The
US invasion in 2003 offered promise of
rapid investment in Iraqi oil sector as
economic sanctions were removed.

Turmoil in Iraq drops output to 1.8 million b/d in 2003-06. Lost production between eras, 600,000

postponed investment and inability to
perform ﬁeld rehabilitation.

Nigeria

Production rose to 2.4 million b/d from
2.1 million b/d during 2000-05, with
expectations of achieving up to 4 million
b/d by 2010 commonly accepted prior to
2005.

Civil strife and attacks on oil infrastructure has hurt
production and investment. Oil production declined in
both 2006 and 2007 (2.11 million b/d) after 2.4 million
b/d in 2005.

500,000-700,000 b/d due to shut-in
production, political instability, and ﬁghting, plus unrealized additional output from
postponed investment.

Venezuela

In 2002 oil production surpassed 3 million
b/d, and showed growth potential after
several years of relatively consistent
production.

A strike at yearend 2002 at PDVSA sent production into
a nosedive. As of 2007 the country had recovered to
slightly less than two thirds of 2002 peak production.
Recent nationalization has hurt investment, furthering
Venezuela’s production difﬁculties and growth potential.

About 800,000 b/d decline in output, not
restored after 2002-03 strike, plus loss
of previously expected output expansion
after 2007 nationalizations, due to likely
fall-off in investment.

Russia

Russian production skyrocketed during
1999-2005, to 9.51 million b/d from
6.31 million b/d. Privatization of Russia’s
energy industry brought in western
investment and more-efﬁcient production and management methods. Output
was projected at 10 million b/d by 2006
and expected to grow to 12 million b/d
by 2010.

Renationalization of Russian oil companies, most notably Yukos in 2004, scared off investment and slowed
production growth. Russia failed to reach 10 million
b/d production as of January 2008 but has seen slight
growth over the past few years. Russia’s major ﬁelds in
Western Siberia remain in decline; Eastern Siberia is not
yet producing oil.

Near-term loss of output from renationalization 200,000-400,000 b/d. Longer term
loss unknown, but could be substantial,
and loss in annual output over next 10
years may be as much as 1 million b/d.

Sudan

A peace treaty signed in 2005 to end the
country’s civil war was expected to allow
for development of previously inaccessible ﬁelds. The Sudanese government
said in 2005 production would reach
600,000 b/d by 2006. Oil reserves were
in the billions, rather than the previously known 560 million bbl of proved
reserves.

Fighting has continued and rebel groups launched
recent attacks against oil facilities in Sudan, mostly run
by Chinese companies. Production has yet to reach
600,000 b/d and has fallen about 200,000-250,000
b/d short of expectations over the past few years, but
grew to 570,000 in 2007. New production slow to come
online as many new ﬁelds remain inaccessible due to
ﬁghting, and many western countries have launched
divestment initiatives.

200,000-250,000 b/d of additional output
not realized, investment outlook remains
limited, and access to known reserves
has declined.

Argentina

During 1991-98 Argentina’s crude oil
production grew by 80% to 917,000 b/d.
After 2 years of slight decline, production
picked up again in 2001.

During the 2 years following 2001, production remained
constant. In 2004 Argentina nationalized the country’s
oil industry and created state oil company Ensara. Ensara has been poorly funded by the government.

State company, Ensara controls all oil
projects; oil production has been declining
since 2004 and dropped below 800,000
b/d in 2007.

Kazakhstan

After the fall of the Soviet Union,
Kazakhstan opened its borders to oil and
gas exploration. A major discovery was
made in the Caspian Sea of an estimated
13 billion bbl. Production from this ﬁeld,
Kashagan, was expected to begin in 2005
with a consortium of foreign oil companies and Kazakhstan’s KazMunaiGaz.

The government has implemented several
restrictions against foreign oil companies over the
past several years as it seeks to strengthen control
of its energy resources. It currently is renegotiating
the Kashagan deal it made several years ago with the
consortium of foreign oil companies.

Most of the Kashagan oil output delay
is due to technical problems. Difﬁcult to
determine future loss from governmentforced renegotiation of contracts, but may
result in chill on investment levels for
new resources.

US

Opening the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge (ANWR) to development—it
has an estimated 10.4 billion bbl of
crude reserves—was the major part of
President George W. Bush’s energy policy
when he took ofﬁce in 2000.

Legislation that would allow drilling in Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) has failed to be passed by Congress. Attempts at new offshore exploration have seen
similar fates. In August 2007, US courts revoked Shell’s
right to drill three exploration wells in the Beaufort Sea
near ANWR.

Depending on when ANWR leasing
would have occurred, loss in domestic
production could be substantial, the exact
amount is unknowable as the prospect
has not been drilled, but it could be as
much as 1 million b/d had leasing occurred 10 years ago.

Canada
(Alberta)

Canada has the second largest crude oil
reserves in the world, 179.2 billion bbl,
behind only Saudi Arabia. It is estimated
that about 95% of those reserves are
located in Alberta’s oil sands deposits.

In 2007 the Alberta government introduced new royalty
rates, which will increase the government’s take by an
additional 15%. Alberta has already seen a loss of investment that will hinder future production in the region.
In 2007, oil and gas land sales were down over 50%.

Several companies, including Canada
Natural Resources, Nexen, and Imperial
Oil have announced reduced investment
in the area. Loss of output is unknown,
but rising royalty rates likely will curtail
future output growth.

Bolivia

In 1999-2006 natural gas production, a
major part of Bolivia’s economy, grew by
nearly 400% to 466 bcf.

Nationalization of state energy resources in 2006 by
President Evo Morales and the subsequent loss of
foreign investment and management caused production
growth to diminish. The government announced that it
will be unable to meet contractual export requirements
to Argentina and Brazil in 2008.

Lost production and exploration due to
signiﬁcant decline in investment. Loss of
new production is unknown, but is likely
to be substantial over the next 5 years.

Mexico

During 1995-2004 Mexican production
increased to 3.85 million b/d from 3.08
million b/d. In September 2004, the EIA
predicted production of 4 million b/d in
2005.

Mexico’s production has been in decline since 2004.
The 4 million b/d predicted for 2005 never materialized.
Instead output dropped to 3.78 million b/d. Only 3.53
million b/d were produced in 2007, and 3.39 million b/d
are expected to be produced in 2008. Some analysts
believe Mexico’s oil output has peaked, but the more
serious problem is that Pemex, Mexico’s state-owned oil
monopoly, does not have the funds needed for exploration and development of new ﬁelds.

Much of Mexico’s lost production comes
from lack of funding for Pemex. Pemex’s
budget is subject to approval by the
Mexican Congress. Pemex operates on
a very tight budget, large debt service,
and no legal authority to bring in outside
investors. We estimate lost of Mexican
supply to the world market in 2005-10 to
be at 500,000 b/d and possibly more.

Country

*Estimated loss of supplies to the world market, 2005-10, would be 2.5-4.5 million b/d. In the end, the estimate of lost production is just that, an imprecise estimate. In many respects,
the lost opportunities from these unfortunate events may be more signiﬁcant as producers lose opportunities to evaluate and extend new technology and gain information that could
enhance future exploration in the region in question.

reductions in investment in the exploration and development of petroleum
resources, an arena in which there is a
growing consensus that the industry is
already “effort-constrained.”
Russia’s attempts at resource nationalism may have come at an inopportune
time. Foreign investment has suffered
over the past several years as its western
fields are in decline. Output has now
dropped for 5 months in a row, and
strife at TNK-BP has intensified.
Projects that present relatively high
technical thresholds, extraordinary
project completion risks, and very long
lead times to initial production may
now be unable to attract adequate capital to go forward.
This trend in unilateral contract
changes, combined with growing limitations on access to resource development, and in many cases unrealistic
terms for new projects, is all adding to
the so-called peak-oil problem, which
is now more about constraints above
the ground than below. In a kind of

perfect storm of bad luck, the resurgence in resource nationalism has been
supplemented by civil strife and armed
conflicts in several important producing
regions in the world.
The world oil market has been
subject to considerably more turmoil
than that generated by the resurgence
in resource nationalism—armed attacks in Nigeria and Sudan are relevant
examples of the rebel activity and civil
strife that have caused and continue to
bring to the world reduced oil market output—and more importantly,
expectations that new opportunities to
expand production must be postponed.

Role of expectations
Ultimately, prices in the world oil
market are set by the fundamentals of
supply and demand. However, crude
oil prices at any given moment reflect
a wide range of considerations that go
well beyond immediate conditions in

Major shifts in the price of crude oil
since the early 1970s can be explained
in part (perhaps largely) by major shifts
in expectations about future output. For
example, the important consequence
of the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo was
the structural shift in the ownership
and control of the vast resources of the
Persian Gulf region. The embargo, by
changing expectations about future production levels from the major Middle
East oil producers, brought about a
sustained increase in the value of oil.
The second oil price shock, in 1979,
can be seen in a similar light, as the
Iranian revolution also sent a signal
that the region was in for a period of
instability and that the prior view that
future output from Iran and Iraq would
expand substantially was no longer
likely. In both cases, prices were affected
by changing expectations about future
production levels.
The subsequent fall in oil prices in
the mid-1980s can be linked to a funOil & Gas Journal / July 7, 2008

Constraints in worldwide reﬁning capacity
The US currently consumes about
20.5 million b/d of petroleum and
produces about 8.5 million b/d, including natural gas liquids and processing
gains. Its remaining supply is provided
via imports of crude oil and petroleum
products plus about 700,000 b/d of
ethanol.
However, ethanol is not petroleum,
and it presents some unique challenges
to the transportation fuels division of
the industry. It is relatively more expensive to transport as it has no access
to the US products pipeline network,
operates at two thirds the btu value of
conventional gasoline, and consumes
substantial volumes of transportation
fuels in the production of its main feedstock, corn.
Rising world demand for transportation fuels, particularly middle distillates, have grown at a much faster rate

damental shift in medium-term expectations about demand (as consuming
countries engaged in fuel substitution
and conservation) and to Saudi Arabia’s
becoming no longer willing to restrict
output to protect the price structure.
From the 1980s until the 1999 oil
price recovery, OPEC was unable to
limit (or had collectively been unwilling to agree to a strategy of limiting)
sufficient volumes of oil production to
obtain price levels that were substantially above long run replacement costs.
Part of the problem with OPEC is that it
collectively does not and cannot arrive
at a consensus on long-term production
strategy because of the divergent longterm interests of its membership.

Prices surge
Since mid-2004 the price of oil
has risen dramatically as the world oil
market also has faced a perfect storm of
bad luck. Resource nationalism has run
rampant, harming near-term output,
and shifting expectations on future
production.

than additions to reﬁnery capacity. The
world reﬁning industry, therefore, is
operating at very low levels of excess
capacity; furthermore, existing capacity
is not well matched to the recent high
growth in demand for middle distillates. This creates an environment producing periodic spikes in the price of
transportation fuels. For example, US
reﬁning capacity is 4 million b/d below
effective available capacity (3 million
b/d below nameplate capacity). As a
result, the US must import diesel fuel
and gasoline components—historically
10% of consumption—from foreign
reﬁneries.
Middle distillates, including diesel fuel, have been growing at much
higher rates than gasoline. Until new
worldwide reﬁning capacity is added to
improve the output of middle distil-

World oil prices initially rose to
$30/bbl from about $10/bbl.While
this was substantially above the levels
experienced in the 1990s, it reflected
some combination of rising demand
and increased difficulty in replacing
reserves as producers moved to technically more challenging environments,
having produced much of the “easy”
oil. The supply outlook was generally
positive, with output rising to keep
pace with growing global demand.
Expectations about rising investment
in oil and gas development in Nigeria,
Russia, Sudan, Venezuela, the US, and
many other places soon turned into
an environment where projects were
postponed, access to resources was
denied or postponed, or contract terms
were changed. Within a few years, an
era of positive expectations during
2000-04 evolved into an era of negative
expectations, and the bad news keeps
on coming.
Superimposed on this supply situation
have been rising incomes in China, India,
and other parts of the developing world.

lates, the world can expect to continue facing a market where gasoline
remains heavily discounted to diesel
fuel.
Although both gasoline and diesel prices are very high, the price of
gasoline has been attenuated by the
large volumes of coproduced gasoline
components on the world oil market.
As European and Asian reﬁning centers
attempt to maximize output of middle
distillates, they have no choice but to
also produce gasoline components
which are often sold into the US market.
The decline in the value of the US
dollar also has increased the cost of
imports, but EPRINC is reluctant to
speculate whether there is a direct
causal relationship between the two.
This is a complex and esoteric issue
involving trade ﬂows and monetary
policy which is better addressed by
analysts other than EPRINC.

In these economies, too, demand
is rising rapidly for middle distillates,
particularly diesel fuel.
The figure and table show the forces
that have brought about much of the
shift in expectations about production. Note that by early 2005 historic
forecasts of production growth by the
US Energy Information Administration
and others were unrealized. Combined
with falling OPEC excess capacity, this
shrinking of expectations about future
production helped drive crude oil
prices upward.

Effects of disruption
The oil market is highly integrated,
and a disruption somewhere in the
market is a disruption everywhere.
The silent disruption described here
results not from a single event but from
events at several production centers. This
production is missing from the market,
and the subsequent higher prices are
imposing substantial costs on the US
economy and US consumers.
In the period described in the figure

as the “Era of positive expectations,”
buyers and sellers reasonably expected
that oil supplies would grow from
major producing regions. These additions to output did not occur, largely
because of problems above the ground
and not below. The problems in the
upstream market have been amplified
by constraints in refining capacity (see
sidebar).
Oil prices of course could be expected to rise in response to demand
growth and the rising costs of new supplies. But current price increases reflect
a failure of the world petroleum market
to deliver new supplies from fields that
could easily do so within the current
(or even a lower) price structure.
US policies that have restricted opportunities to expand conventional
supplies from Alaska and prospective
offshore and onshore provinces in
the Lower 48 have contributed to this
high-price environment, along with
civil strife in Nigeria, delays in new
OPEC capacity, and resource national-

ism in Venezuela.
Many observers have argued that
these higher prices provide benefits in
the forms of demand reduction, new
conservation initiatives, and acceleration of incentives for moving the US
to the fuels of the future. Whether this
is a cost-effective approach for the US
economy depends on whether current prices are in fact approaching the
long-run backstop price: i.e., the price
where alternative fuels, conservation,
unconventional supplies, etc., are so
plentiful that the price of oil can rise
only modestly if at all.
Our perspective is that the current
price structure is not sustainable. But
failure to provide access to conventional
fuels may mean the transition to a lower
and more-realistic price level may also
involve unnecessary economic pain. ✦

MMS grants offshore leases for 5,
8, or 10 years, Hrobsky said. “Every
leaseholder has to pay bonuses before
production begins. Shooting seismic
can take years. Exploratory wells need
to be drilled. Not every lease has oil
and gas on it and if it does, it may
not be economically recoverable,” he
explained.
“This 68 million-acre argument is
bogus. Lots of it is acreage which has
been unsuccessful. Some of it is still in
the process. If we want to drill fewer
wells that produce more oil and gas, we
need to get into prime areas,” said Rep.
John E. Peterson (R-Pa.).

Lack of time, equipment
Responding to a reporter’s observation that Republicans say H.R. 6251
duplicates existing federal law, Pelosi
said, “That’s not what we hear from the
industry. Some executives say they don’t
have the time. Others say they don’t
have the equipment.”
Noting that congressional Republicans and the Bush administration want
to expand federal leasing to more of the
Outer Continental Shelf and into the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Pelosi
said, “If [oil and gas producers] don’t
have equipment to drill their existing
leases, where are they going to get it to
drill in pristine areas? If they don’t have
enough time to drill what they already
have, where will they find it for new
areas?”
Republicans said that continued
Democratic opposition to more federal
leasing is a mistake. “Doing nothing is
not a policy,” said Henry E. Brown Jr.
(SC), adding that when President Bill
Clinton vetoed ANWR drilling authorization 13 years ago, he said it was
because it would not supply oil for 10
years. “I’m more concerned about oil
leaking from a passing supertanker and
washing up on beaches in my district
than I would be about production from
a well 50 miles offshore,” Brown said.
Tiahart said that the Appropriations

of the US Department of the Interior’s
fiscal 2009 budget because public support has grown for amendments that
would lift congressionally imposed OCS
leasing moratoriums, authorize leasing
within ANWR, and overturn an oilshale leasing moratorium. “The Interior
budget bill is the best vehicle to start
bringing prices down. If you have a
reliable supply, it helps keep speculators
at arm’s length,” he said.
Thelma D. Drake (R-Va.), who
serves on the Armed Services Committee, said that the US Department of
Defense faces the prospect of having to
use emergency funds or divert money
from other programs to pay for suddenly higher fuel costs. “The majority’s
refusal to let us explore for oil and gas

“The CFTC should use its emergency
powers to drive out speculators who are
pushing oil prices higher. The laws of
supply and demand have been suspended. It has taken on almost a casino
atmosphere. We represent Main Street
instead of Wall Street on this issue,” said
Larson.
Emanuel said CFTC’s reluctance to
move against oil price speculators follows the same pattern as with home
mortgage and student loans where regulators essentially had their hands tied
behind their backs. “In each case where
this administration [in the past] has put

J

orge R. Pinon does not want US
politicians to become so concerned about Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez or a possible Chinese
presence in Cuba that they overlook
the rest of the Western Hemisphere.
Excluding Canada, the area supplies US 32% of the US’s total oil
and gas imports, Pinon said during a
recent presentation to the US Energy Association. And he also thinks
Mexico could face bigger problems
than Venezuela.
“It does not have Venezuela’s

What’s more, [state oil firm Petroleos

to behave in an entrepreneurial way.
From a stewardship standpoint, it
doesn’t know how to take the country forward,” Pinon said.

“[Petrobras] can’t seem to do anything wrong. But it faces challenges
including a 5-8 year development

Pinon said. Still, he said, Petrobras
and President Luis Inacio Lula da
Silva “could be the wedge the US
is looking for” against Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez and Petroleos
de Venezuela SA.

Venezuela’s potential

If Brazil is an 800-lb gorilla, Venezuela weighs in at 1,600 lb because
its resources are considerable, Pinon
said. Chavez has diverted PDVSA
from its core function, and production from its conventional oil fields
has been neglected, but Pinon said
this might not last. “If the Venezuelan

GOP Senate bill
would improve energy
market regulation
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
US Senate Republicans introduced
legislation that they said would balance developing domestic fossil fuel
sources with promoting alternatives
and improve energy commodity market
regulation.
The bill, which has 43 cosponsors,
grew from efforts by Senate Republicans to intensify the energy debate and
provide a vehicle for bipartisan action
to address high gasoline prices, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said.
“It uses a three-pronged approach
(conservation, innovation for newer
technologies, and expanded exploration of our domestic resources) to solve
America’s energy crisis. It also would
create thousands of jobs and help get
prices down at the gas pump,” he maintained.
Democrats in the House as well as
the Senate oppose expanding oil and
gas leases on the Outer Continental
Shelf or authorizing prompt development of regulations for leasing federal
onshore acreage for oil shale development. Two provisions in McConnell’s
bill address these issues by repealing an
oil shale moratorium that Democrats
inserted into the Department of the
Interior’s fiscal 2008 budget and by
allowing coastal state governors to petition for OCS leasing at least 50 miles
offshore with concurrence from their

state legislatures.
The bill also would increase research
and development support for producing
electric cars and trucks and take several
actions to improve US regulation of
energy commodity markets. Specifically,
it would increase funding for US Commodity Futures Trading Commission
operations and staffing, codify CFTC
actions on position limits and transparency limits for foreign exchanges and
require the CFTC to gather information
on index traders and swaps dealers.
“We must expand our domestic
energy production and limit the hold
Middle Eastern nations have on our

T E R E S T
economy,” McConnell said. “The United
States is the third-largest producer of
oil in the world after the Saudis and the
Russians. While we must work now to
reduce our dependence on fossil fuels,
if we truly want to achieve energy independence, America must be allowed
to take advantage of the vast energy
resources we have right at home.”
The bill represents the latest effort to
reduce US dependence on foreign oil
by addressing fundamental supply and
demand problems, according to Pete
V. Domenici (R-NM), the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee’s ranking

minority member.
“While the majority has come up
with excuse after excuse for opposing
more production, to me the path forward should be clear. Passing a bill like
this will send a strong message to the
world’s oil markets and the unfriendly
nations we buy oil from that America
has had enough. I hope that the Democrats will reconsider their widespread
opposition to increased domestic production,” he said.
The House Western Caucus, led
by Rep. Chris Cannon (R-Utah), also
planned to introduce an energy bill on

“By far, the most important component in consumption is growth

China and India, and the absence of

carbon constraints, which would lead
to growth in carbon dioxide emissions
of about 2%/year. Right now, economics and technology constraints suggest
there will be no meaningful carbon
capture and storage contributions before 2030,” Caruso said. ✦

CAPP alters Canadian oil sands production outlook
The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) has released its
annual crude oil production from oil
sands outlook, which is slightly altered
from its earlier report.
CAPP’s 2008 Canadian crude oil
supply outlook evaluates two cases,
both extending to 2020. The moderate growth case represents the expected
outlook, and a more-aggressive pipeline
planning case was also developed.
In the moderate growth case, total
Canadian crude oil production, including conventional, oil sands, and Atlantic
offshore, was projected to increase to
almost 4.5 million b/d in 2020 from
2.7 million b/d in 2007.
In the pipeline planning case, production rises even more—to 5 million b/d.
Oil sands continue to be the main
source of Canada’s growing oil supply,
said CAPP, which estimates industry will
invest about $20 billion on oil sands
development during 2008.
In the 2008 forecast, CAPP extended
its anticipated oil sands growth over
a slightly longer time frame, which

resulted in a slightly lower production
profile in the 2008 forecast than in
2007.

Oil sands outlook
CAPP took a poll of oil sands producers in early 2008 to obtain their
current and planned oil sands production through 2020.
“The growth in oil sands remains
significant; the potential for oil sands
growth is unchanged, but this will be
accomplished over a longer period,”
said Greg Stringham, CAPP vice-president, markets and fiscal policy.
“Even with growing world demand
and higher global prices for oil, oil
sands projects take substantial time and
effort to address issues such as rising
construction costs, labor constraints,
public concerns about environmental
impacts, and completing detailed regulatory processes,” Stringham said.
Recent trends indicate the year-overyear decline rate for conventional crude
oil production has slowed somewhat
due to higher crude oil prices and

that production has increased slightly
in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, CAPP
said. However, due to the maturity
of the Western Canada Sedimentary
Basin, conventional crude oil supply is
expected to decline gradually over the
forecast period.
In order to accommodate the expected growth in oil sands supply, 1.1 million b/d of pipeline capacity is being
added from Western Canada through
yearend 2010. CAPP believes that capacity should be sufficient until 2013.
“Subsequently, additional pipeline
capacity will be required to meet expected oil sands growth. This new pipeline capacity will include expansions

Earlier this month, SEC staff recommended that reserves reporting requirements be updated in order to provide
more estimated reserves information to
investors (OGJ, June 23, 2008, Newsletter).

Christopher Cox. “But the current oil
and gas disclosure rules often interfere
with an investor’s analysis because they
are tied to outdated technologies.”
The proposed revisions suggest
some clarifications in terminology for
reserves and resources classification.

Deﬁning ‘reasonable certainty’

ing Standards Board consider using
average prices rather than single-day,
yearend oil and gas prices as the basis
for calculating estimated reserves reported in 10-K filings.
Financial Accounting Standard (FAS)
69, which FASB adopted in 1982,
mandates the use of prices as of Dec. 31

of each year. Some producers said this
practice distorts reserves volumes and
values.
SEC said this rule change would
maximize comparability of reserve estimates among companies and mitigate
distortion of the estimates that arises
when using a single pricing date.

SEC proposes to define the phrase
“reasonable certainty,” which is the
standard now used in the definition
of proved oil and gas reserves, yet
“reasonable certainty” is not defined.
Consequently, it has been the subject of
disagreement within industry.
“We propose to define the term ‘reasonable certainty’ as much more likely
to be achieved than not,” said SEC’s proposed rule revisions.
The SEC also wants to clarify definitions for deterministic and probabilistic
methods of estimating reserves. Both
methods would be allowed under the
proposed rule revisions.
Companies now use deterministic
methods for reserves estimates that are
reported to the SEC. Some companies
use probabilistic methods for estimates
reserves although those figures are used
internally by executives.
Previously, industry-recognized
definitions covered only proved reserves
based on deterministic estimating
methods, which was the SEC requirement. In 1987, the Society of Petroleum
Engineers (SPE) issued definitions for
probable and possible reserves classifications that found wide acceptance
in industry. SPE and World Petroleum
Congress issued new definitions in
1997 that allowed for the probabilistic
estimation of reserves.

Yearend prices
Another proposed revision would
require companies to report estimated
oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the previous
12-month period. Currently, companies report reserves based upon
yearend prices.

Angevine said. “The Colorado Oil and
Gas Association estimates that the new
rules could increase drilling costs by
$60,000-600,000/well.”
Alaska, which increased its petroleum production tax, was listed 22nd
among the least attractive jurisdictions.

California was ranked 11th. California’s ranking grouped it with other
high-risk nations such as Russia and

“California’s expended prohibitions
on offshore drilling and concerns about
environmental regulations are having a
detrimental effect on the way the state

Angevine said.
A total of 396 respondents participated in this year’s survey. Companies
represented in the survey accounted
for more than one third of the industry’s global spending on petroleum

Brazil sets sights on increasing oil production
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Brazil will at least triple its oil
reserves by exploring the new Tupi
offshore area, and will use the future
revenues on healthcare and education
for the country, according to Brazilian
President Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva.
“This is very promising for Brazil. We have to take advantage of this
oil to develop the country,” Lula told
Bloomberg Television. “It’s a chance for
the Brazilian poor to use this money
as opposed to having people with a lot
of oil and three or four watches and a
Rolex in their pockets. We want to take
advantage of these riches to ensure that
Brazil can take a great leap forward.”
The Brazilian president avoided
estimating the exact amount of petroleum that will be produced in the areas
recently discovered by state oil concern
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras). Asked
whether there was a possibility of tripling the current volume of production,
he said, “There must be more than that,
but I don’t have the exact figure because
there would be a lot of speculation in
the stock market.”
Concerning the methods that the
government will use to explore the new

Brazilian discoveries, Lula said, “That
is a state secret.” He said only that exploration of the Tupi well in the Santos
basin would take place in March. “We
are going as deep as possible; we are
working even more intensively.”
Lula said he has changed his mind
and won’t seek membership for Brazil
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. “I’m under no illusion that Brazil will join OPEC,” he said.
“I used to be, but am no longer.”
Instead, Lula expressed confidence in
his country’s transformation into a major producer of petroleum and exporter
of petroleum products.
“I cannot discuss the size of the
reserves, but I feel that Brazil is going to
be transformed into a major producer.
I do not want it to become an exporter
of petroleum,” he said. “I want Brazil to
export petroleum products.”

No reason for high oil price
Meanwhile, according to Lula, there
is no reason for the successive rises in
the price of oil. “Petroleum does not
need to cost what it does; half that
amount would be fine,” he said.
He pointed out that the experts attribute the higher price of petroleum to

several things such as rising consumption in China or the increasing use of
reserves in the US. “But we are aware
that the price does not need to be what
it is.”
He said, governments need to
consider the impact of petroleum costs
on food production, citing the cost of
fertilizer and transportation. “I believe
that the world will realize the irresponsibility of this point in time because of
both petroleum and food,” he said.
He said the stand by US Democratic
presidential hopeful Barack Obama
against purchasing Brazilian ethanol and
John McCain’s stand in favor of it are
just part of an election strategy. “When
they take office,” he said, “they will
begin working in terms of reality.”
In fact, Lula is convinced that Brazilian ethanol will be used in the US
regardless of who wins the upcoming
presidential election. “Whoever wins
the election there will realize that it is
cheaper, generates more employment,
guarantees more peace, and creates no
conflict with food production.”
“I’m convinced that whoever wins
the election will start using ethanol
made from sugar cane,” Lula said. ✦

Khodorkovsky’s
independence

L

ast week, just as millions of
Americans—many of them in the
oil and gas industry—were preparing for their July 4 Independence
Day celebrations, the Russian government announced new charges against
former OAO Yukos head Mikhail
Khodorkovsky and his associate Platon Lebedev.
As you may recall, Khodorkovsky
was arrested in 2003 when his jet was
stormed by armed police on a runway
in Siberia, and he is now serving an
8-year sentence in eastern Russia.
Speculation has it that former
Russian President Vladimir Putin used
Khodorkovsky’s arrest and jailing
as part of an effort to reassert state
control over his country’s lucrative
energy sector.
The “new” charges against
Khodorkovsky and Lebedev include
money laundering and “stealing
almost 350 million tons of oil,” the
investigative branch of the prosecutor’s office said.

The same absurdity
In reply, Khodorkovsky said, “The
investigators have repeated the same
absurdity about me stealing the entire
Yukos oil output during 6 years.”
His lawyers described the charges
as a slightly modified version of theft
and money-laundering claims filed
against him in February 2007 but
never brought to trial.
Even Russia’s Kommersant newspaper saw through the charges. On July
1 the paper said: “Yesterday, Mikhail
Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev
were charged with a theft of some
350 million tons of oil and laundering
487 billion roubles and $7.5 billion.
You can hardly render this accusation
new: Compared with the previous version, only stylistic inaccuracy has been
38

improved, and some of the paragraphs
have been swapped.”
One wonders when this farce will
ever end. Some Russian observers
have speculated that Putin’s successor, Dmitry Medvedev, could release
Khodorkovsky to signal a break with
some of his predecessor’s policies.

Medvedev=Putin
But any hope of that seemed to
have faded in early June when Medvedev rejected any outside intervention over Khodorkovsky.
“Issues related to the serving of
sentences should not become the
subject of interstate negotiations,”
said Medvedev during a visit to
Berlin, his first trip to Europe since
succeeding Putin earlier in May.
The matter arose when a lawyer for
Khodorkovsky called on Germany’s
leader to raise his client’s case during
talks with Medvedev.
“I hope that German Foreign
Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and
the chancellor, Angela Merkel, plan
to discuss this subject with Medvedev,” said Yury Schmidt, chief defense
lawyer for Khodorkovsky.
Schmidt said he was more hopeful
for his client’s release following talks
he held with Steinmeier during the
German minister’s visit to Russia in
mid-May.
“Steinmeier asked me precise questions on legal procedures that would
allow Khodorkovsky to be freed,” said
Schmidt. “This is not a question of
pardoning Khodorkovsky, but of legal
avenues allowing him to be freed.”
Not much seems to have come
of that meeting, though, apart from
thinking that “Medvedev” is just another way of spelling “Putin.”
Some Independence Day celebration. ✦

Japan to aid Iraq
in rebuilding oil,
gas industry
Eric Watkins
Senior Correspondent
Iraqi Oil Minister Hussain Al
Shahristani and Japanese Minister of
Economy, Trade, and Industry Akira
Amari—voicing concerns over global
oil prices—agreed that both countries
would cooperate in a variety of measures aimed at reconstructing Iraq’s oil
and natural gas industry.
“The two countries confirmed that
rebuilding the oil industry and increasing output are important for the stability of crude oil prices, and Japan is ready
to fully cooperate to that end,” Amari
said after meeting with Al Shahristani.
Japan and Iraq will strengthen
cooperation in a range of economic
fields centering on the energy sector.
They said oil and gas development and
the reconstruction of existing energyrelated facilities are essential for the
rehabilitation of Iraq.

Basra reﬁnery upgrade
Japan reconfirmed its commitment
to implement development loans it has
pledged, including one to help build
refinery and export facilities in and
around Basra. The ¥2.1 billion loan to
Basra includes installing secondary units
such as a fluid catalytic cracker.
In January, the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation said it had
signed an agreement with Baghdad for
as much as ¥182.7 billion to restore
war-damaged facilities, including ¥50.1
billion on the oil export facility reconstruction project.
At the time, JBIC said the two countries also agreed to spend ¥36.8 billion
for rehabilitation of the Al-Mussaib
thermal power plant; ¥30.2 billion for
the Iraqi port area rehabilitation project;
¥32.6 billion for rebuilding the power
grid; and ¥30.9 billion on other civic
rehabilitation and construction projects.

In early June, JBIC signed additional
loan agreements totaling ¥57.7 billion
for the Basra water supply improvement project and reconstruction of the
Kurdistan electric power grid.
Japan’s oil and gas firms have reaped
rewards from the investments. In April,
Inpex Holdings Inc. and three other Japanese companies passed a preliminary
screening of potential bidders for Iraqi
oil exploration and development.
In addition, Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., Nippon Oil Corp., and
Mitsubishi Corp. are among 41 of the
120 applicants to have passed the Oil
Ministry’s preliminary screening. The
41 include ExxonMobil Corp., BP PLC,
and oil and gas companies from China,
Russia, and India.
Iraq expressed hope that more
Japanese companies will participate in
bidding for projects to develop Iraqi
oil fields, while Japan offered to train a
hundred Iraqi engineers a year during
2009-13.
The Iraqi oil ministry said this week
it is planning by the end of the month
to announce the first round of tenders
to develop its oil and gas fields.
A ministry spokesman said names
of the fields, duration of each contract,
closing dates for receiving bids, and other
details would be made public on June 30.
The oil and gas fields include Kirkuk
and Bai Hasan in northern Iraq, as well
as West Qurna 1, Zubair, Rumaila, and
Missan in southern Iraq. They also said
two gas fields—Akkas in western Iraq
and Mansoriya in the east—will be
included. ✦

The nation’s high court said punitive
damages should be limited to $507.5
million. In a ruling released June 25 in
Washington, DC, the court was divided,
5-3. Associate Justice Samuel Alito had
recused himself from the case because
he owns ExxonMobil stock.

Associate Justice David Souter wrote
the opinion, saying punitive damages
could not exceed what ExxonMobil
already paid to plaintiffs for economic
losses. Associate Justices John Paul

Ginsburg dissented.

BP: Free markets effective where allowed to work
Marilyn Radler
Senior Editor-Economics
Despite high prices, above-average
economic growth drove robust global
energy-demand growth last year, according to BP’s latest statistical review
of world energy.
Energy consumption worldwide increased 2.4% in 2007, driven by developing countries. This compares to 2.7%
worldwide energy demand growth a
year earlier.
Mark Finley, general manager of
global energy markets for BP America,
told a Houston audience June 24 that
it is countries outside the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development that are driving today’s global
economic growth and have accounted
for 90% of all energy demand growth
over the past 5 years.
These non-OECD countries have
experienced an energy-intensive form
of economic growth, as the world’s
heavy industry has shifted away from
the developed OECD countries.
Global oil demand grew 1.1% last
year, with robust growth in oil-exporting countries. Oil consumption growth
by non-OECD oil importing countries
has shown the greatest acceleration.
40

Countries that subsidize energy prices
accounted for all of the 2007 growth,
Finley said, while oil demand in countries within the OECD declined nearly
1%.
Where allowed to work, high prices
are effective at keeping demand in
check, Finley said; US gasoline consumption, for example, has declined
with higher pump prices.

Oil production slows
In its first decline since 2002,
worldwide oil production fell 0.2%, or
130,000 b/d, last year. However the US
posted its first oil production gain since
2000, led by onshore output in the
lower-48.
Worldwide proved oil reserves were
flat from 2006, totaling 1.24 trillion
bbl, enough to meet current production
for 41 yr, according to BP’s assessment. Finley noted that estimates of
the world’s oil reserves keep rising,
much more so due to factors above the
ground, including prices, rather than
due to geology.
Finley said that through 2007, the
average crude prices for the first time in
history increased for 6 years straight.
Rather than speculation in the oil
markets, Finley said that tightening

fundamentals and concerns of future
market conditions are driving current
prices for oil, heating oil, and natural
gas. Speculation is a symptom—not a
cause—of higher prices, he said.
The BP report shows that last year,
natural gas consumption grew by an
above-average 3.1%, although only
North America, Asia Pacific, and Africa recorded above-average regional
growth.
Coal was the fastest growing fuel in
the world for the fifth consecutive year,
as global demand rose 4.5%, above the
10-year average of 3.2%. ✦

and extensively damaged in the 2004
and 2005 hurricane seasons. The
destruction from
hurricanes
Ivan, Katrina, and
Rita was
severe with
122 structures destroyed and 76 others severely
damaged. The physical impact of the
hurricanes to the offshore infrastructure
has been widely reported in the trade
press, but the financial impacts of decommissioning and the potential value
of the lost production have not been
examined.
The purpose of this four-part series
is to examine the destroyed infrastructure from the 2004 and 2005 hurricane
seasons and the likely contribution this
collection of assets would have made to

future production in the gulf.
In Part 1, we describe the weather
risk that operators encounter and
review the factors that are involved in
redevelopment decisions. The impact of the 2004 and 2005 hurricane
seasons on the infrastructure and
production statistics in the gulf are
summarized.

Weather risk

Storms and hurricanes regularly
challenge and endanger the coastal
community and energy infrastructure
in the Gulf of Mexico.
Powered by heat from the sea, a
hurricane acts as a gigantic heat engine
transforming warm ocean water into
powerful wind fields. The wind fields
generate waves and current that interact
with the built environment, increasing
the stress load on offshore structures,
which in some cases, leads to catastrophic failure and destruction.
Tropical cyclones are steered by the
easterly trade winds and the temperate
westerlies, and around their core, winds
grow with great velocity and generate
ferocious and violent seas. Each year
around 100 tropical disturbances develop between May and November over
the Atlantic Ocean. About 25 of
these disturbances develop into

Aggregate losses

Katrina (46)
Rita (69)

Assets capable of producing at high
rates or those associated with significant
levels of remaining reserves are more
likely to be redeveloped than structures
with low production rates and-or less
reserves. Structures in close proximity
to other infrastructure where produc46

tion may be aggregated or drilling opportunities exist are also more likely to
be redeveloped.
For mature fields, the natural energy
of the reservoir is often near exhaustion, with production rates that are
low and remaining reserves not likely

Losses incurred in a hurricane are a
combination of physical damage and
time element losses.
When production operations are
disrupted, either by damage on site or
elsewhere, cash flow is impacted. Insurance claims on time element coverage
are typically categorized as business interruption from damage to assets (e.g.,
platforms, pipelines, etc.), and contingent business interruption, associated
with damage to upstream facilities
such as processing plants, trunk lines
and refineries, owned by third-parties,
which prevent production from being
received.
Hurricane Ivan caused energy losses
of $2.5-3 billion, while Katrina and
Rita were responsible for a record $15
billion in losses.4 In Ivan, about two
thirds of the total losses were attributed
to business interruption and contingent

the time will be
shut in 1, 2, or 3
days depending
on the strength and location (path) of
the storm. Obviously, the more central
the storm path is relative to production
fields, the greater the amount of oil and
gas will be shut in. Shut-in production is usually not “lost,” since after the
storms pass and operators assess the
integrity of their wells, pipelines, and
structures, chokes and valves will be
reopened and production resumed.
After Hurricane Ivan, damage to

subsea pipelines, production platforms, and onshore processing facilities
required six weeks to restore 80% of
shut-in oil production and 10 weeks to
restore 90% of shut-in gas production.
The paths of hurricanes Katrina and Rita
crossed higher-density infrastructure
regions and caused more damage to
the natural gas systems and processing
facilities.5

*Structures are classiﬁed as oil or gas producers according to their cumulative GOR measured in cu ft/bbl. Structures
with GOR ≤5,000 are classiﬁed as primarily oil producers; structures with GOR >5,000 are primarily gas producers.

vice (MMS) requires operators to shut
down facilities and evacuate personnel
with the approach of extreme weather, and thus the storm path, speed,
strength, and operator response impact
the rate at which production is shut in
and the peak value of the curves. The
duration of the storm and its impact
on production facilities and pipeline
infrastructure will determine the
plateau and slope of the shut-in curve
after peak.
Many factors may complicate and
delay efforts to get production back to
prestorm levels, including damage to
onshore support facilities and staging
areas, the availability of service vessels
and helicopters, and the effects of per48

sonnel dislocation and property loss.
If onshore gas processing plants are
inoperable for any length of time, for
example, the loss could delay a recovery of natural gas production—even if
platforms and pipelines are unaffected—because gas needs to be processed
before flowing to market. Production
levels will return to prestorm levels if
no wells, structures, or pipelines are
damaged or destroyed. Production
associated with destroyed wells and
structures that are not redeveloped is
classified as lost.

Damage rates
The amount of damage incurred
from a hurricane would be expected to

be roughly correlated with the strength
of the storm and the number of structures in the storm path.
We tabulate exposure levels and
physical damage estimates (Table 2).
Damage rates are a probabilistic function, and we observe that the number of structures destroyed correlates
weakly with damage estimates; e.g.,
the number of structures destroyed by
Katrina was about half that of Rita, but
Katrina’s losses were nearly double.
The number of offshore structures
that are destroyed or damaged depends
not only on the path and strength of
the storm but also the physical characteristics of the wind and wave fields
and their interaction with the offshore
facilities, the location of the structure
relative to the storm path, design characteristics, and various other factors.
The complexity of analysis requires
sophisticated meteorological, metocean, and structural modeling to normalize exposed entities to wind speed,
structure type, and design specifications.6 7

Destroyed structures
Hurricane Ivan entered the waters
of the Mississippi River delta, the area
most susceptible to underwater mudslides, and destroyed seven platforms
and caused significant damage to 24
other platforms.
Significant damage is defined as
damage that prohibits production or
requires complete structural analysis
of the platform before returning to
production. Thirteen pipelines were
damaged. Several drilling rigs were
caught in the storm’s path and incurred
extensive damage (Table 3).
Hurricane Katrina entered the gulf
in late September 2005 as a Category 4
hurricane and destroyed 46 platforms
and severely damaged 20 others. Hurricane Rita followed in mid-October
2005 destroying 69 platforms and
damaging 32 others (Fig. 4). A number
of semisubmersible and jack up drilling
rigs broke free from their moorings
during the storms and drifted throughout the gulf causing additional damage.

Most of the structures destroyed
were older than 10 years, but some
were in the prime of their production life cycle (Table 4). The majority
of the destroyed infrastructure—with
the exception of Typhoon and a small
number of other developments—were
mature assets in the latter part of their
life cycle.
Chevron, Apache, BP America, Forest
Oil, and Energy XXI owned more than
half of the destroyed structures and a
majority of the destroyed wells (Table
5). In total, over 850 wells throughout
the gulf were destroyed by the storms.

As hydrocarbon prices increase, the
threshold level of production which
would be considered marginal decreases. Twenty-two structures, most
of which were early in their life cycle,
exhibit strong production levels and are
the best candidates for redevelopment.

production and revenue streams. ✦

Aggregate production
Gas, oil, and water production from
the collection of hurricane destroyed
structures as a percentage of total gulf
production is shown in Table 6 and depicted graphically in Fig. 5 along with a
forecast of future production.
Hurricane destroyed structures represented 1.2% of the total gas and 1.5%
of the total oil production in the gulf in
2005 and 3.4% of the total produced
water.

Structure classiﬁcation
Structures are classified as primarily
“oil” or “gas” producers using the cumulative gas-oil ratio (GOR), measured
in cubic feet gas production per barrel
oil production (Table 7).
For GOR <5,000, a structure is
considered primarily an “oil” producer,
while for GOR >5,000, a structure is
considered primarily a “gas” producer.
The amount of oil, gas, and BOE production is used to proxy the cash flow
position of operators and provides an
indirect indicator of the status of operations at the time of the event.
A marginal producer would likely
be producing less than 50 b/d of oil or
300 Mcfd of gas, depending on structure type, water cut, oil and gas price,
operating expense, and other factors,
but it may vary at somewhat higher or
lower levels. Production greater than
200 b/d oil or 1,200 Mcfd gas will be
commercial under almost all circumstances.

Special Report

ERCB expects to start using a 6%
mass cutoff instead of a 3% mass for
recoverable bitumen in future updates.
Although this cutoff will reduce bitumen in place by 20% in AWM, 35% in
CLC, and 50% in PRBG, ERCB expects
data from additional drilling will offset
these decreases.
The report says that these four
deposits contain more than 64% of the
total initial in-place bitumen resource
and about 87% of the in-place resource
found in clastics (Table 1). Of the
173 billion bbl remaining established
reserves, ERCB considers 82%, or 142
billion bbl recoverable with in situ
methods and the remaining 31 billion
bbl recoverable with surface mining
methods.
The currently active mining and
in situ areas contain about 22 billion
bbl out of the 173 billion bbl deemed
recoverable.

Production
ERCB says bitumen production from
in situ projects increased by
7.1% in 2007, compared
Fig. 2
with 2006, while production from mining projects
increased by 4.3%. In 2007,
the minable area produced
286 million bbl, while in
situ projects produced 196
million bbl.
In situ recovery includes
both primary methods and
enhanced recovery, such as
injection of steam, water,
or other solvents into the
reservoir to mobilize the
bitumen.
The report notes that
production in 2007 from the
three current surface mining
projects was:
1. Syncrude Canada Ltd.,
367,000 b/d.
2. Suncor Energy Inc.,
267,000 b/d.
3. Albian Sands Energy
Inc., 150,000 b/d.

Futures sources of production from

minable resources include:
• CNRL’s Horizon project with proposed production starting third-quarter
2008.
• Shell Canada’s Jackpine mine with
production expected to coincide with
completion of the Muskeg Mine expansion in late 2010.
• Petro-Canada-UTS Energy-Teck
Cominco’s Fort Hills project with production proposed by 2011.
• Imperial Oil-ExxonMobil’s proposed multistage Kearl mine with startup expected in 2011.
• Total E&P Canada Ltd.’s proposed
multistage Joslyn North mine with production expected in 2013.
With these projects, ERCB expects
total mined bitumen production to
reach 1.76 million b/d in 2017, up
from 0.78 million b/d in 2007.

(Suncor) project in 1967. Also shown is
the price of SCO from 1971, which the
report says is generally at a premium to
light crude oil.
Companies have drilled most in situ
producing wells in the oil sands as deviated wells from pads to minimize the
drilling and production footprint. From
1985 through yearend 2007, 34,276
wells have been drilled to explore for
and develop the oil sands. In 2007 of
the 4,295 wells drilled in the oil sands,
1,376 were development wells and
2,919 were exploratory. About 8,900
wells were on production during 2007,
with the average well producing 62
bo/d (Fig. 5).
Production from the Cold Lake
region accounts for 59% of the in situ
production, with another 35% produced in the Athabasca region and 7%
in the Peace River region, according to

port says the petroleum coke produced
in the delayed-coking operation for upgrading bitumen is a potential source of
energy through gasification. This energy
source could reduce natural gas use in
the oil sands.
Suncor has been burning sulfur-rich
coke in its boilers for decades at its
mine near Fort McMurray and is responsible for most of the total coke use
as a site fuel. The company has also sold
petroleum coke to Asian markets since
1997, mostly Japan, according to ERCB.
In addition, Syncrude began using coke
as a site fuel in 1995, and ERCB says the
company is seeking alternative uses for
its coke surplus such as using it as a reclamation material.
Sulfur is another by-product of oil
sands. Its price has recently increased
from $50/tonne in midyear 2007 to
the $150-350/tonne range, according
to ERCB’s report (Fig. 7). ERCB estimates that remaining sulfur reserves in
Alberta decreased by 3% in 2007, with
China being the major importer. ERCB
notes that exports to China in 2007 decreased by 24%, compared with 2006,
because of competition of exports from
the Middle East.
China uses sulfur for producing
sulfuric acid and producing phosphate
fertilizers.
ERCB estimates that about 208 million tonnes of elemental sulfur will be
recoverable from the 5 billion cu m of
remaining established crude bitumen
reserves in the surface minable area.
The reports says the 40.5 tonnes sulfur/1,000 cu m of crude bitumen ratio
reflects both current operations and expected use of high-conversion hydrogenaddition upgrading technology for the
future development of surface-minable
crude bitumen reserves. ✦

have expressed interest in accessing new
markets and several pipeline companies
have offered proposals for transportation.
Potential new markets include the US
Gulf Coast, East Coast, West Coast, and
Asia (Fig. 2).
On the other hand, some refiners in
the traditional markets have announced
plans for facilities to use more oil sands
crude, especially diluted bitumen.
Through acquisitions and joint ventures, oil sands operators and refiners
are working to secure their markets and
supplies. Pipeline projects are under
way to provide deliveries within these
markets.
Historically, producers have diluted
bitumen for shipment in pipelines using condensate, in a blend commonly
referred to as DilBit. In some cases, they
have used SCO as diluent, yielding an
SCO blend called SynBit.
Most SCO has been light sweet crude
with no vacuum resid, but upgraders also have produced medium-heavy
sour SCO. The quality depends on the
upgrading technologies employed. The

In Alberta, bitumen upgraders produce the SCO, most of which has been
light sweet SCO (about 32° gravity and
less than 0.2% sulfur) with no vacuum

800,000 b/d in 2007. This is predominantly from resource-based projects
(Suncor Energy Inc., Syncrude Canada
Ltd., and Athabasca Oil Sands Project
(AOSP) at Scotford), but Husky Energy
Inc.’s stand alone upgrader at Lloydminster produced about 53,000 b/d.
Purvin & Gertz estimates that about

Bitumen blends
Upgrading provides a market outlet
for bitumen. Within Alberta, most of
the upgrading occurs as part of integrated resource projects. To date all the
mining projects have upgraders although the AOSP upgrader is not onsite.
The OPTI/Nexen Long Lake project
will integrate in situ production with
upgrading.
In 2007, resource upgraders produced about 650,000 b/d of SCO.
Companies have plans for expansions
of existing projects. The new Fort Hills
upgrader project, led by Petro Canada,
will be in the Fort Saskatchewan area,
although Total E&P Canada Ltd. and
StatoilHydro Canada Ltd. have delayed
plans for their upgraders. Husky cancelled its standalone upgrader at Lloydminster and development has slowed
for the standalone upgraders planned
by BA Energy and North West Upgrading Inc.
In 2007, in situ sites produced about
500,000 b/d of nonupgraded bitumen.
Most of the bitumen growth will be
from in situ projects although mining
projects could produce and sell bitumen
if the extraction process can meet bs&w
specifications.
Without upgrading, companies must
dilute bitumen with lighter petroleum

and light sour crudes. Japan is concerned about competition for Middle
East crude. The refineries have very little
coking capacity and their FCC capacity
is small compared with North America.
They may also be candidates for SCO
although SCO with less VGO might be
of greater interest.
As noted, a potentially significant
market for SCO is diluent use in SynBit
that typically contains about 50% bitumen and 50% SCO. If there were a large
demand for SCO as diluent, this would
reduce the supply of segregated SCO
and strengthen the price. On the other
hand, if companies imported more
condensate and naphtha for diluent, this
would reduce the demand for SCO as
diluent and leave more segregated SCO
with a weaker price.

to meet pipeline specifications for
density and viscosity. Condensate historically provided most of the diluent,
although companies have used SCO and
other light streams. Some DilBits such
as Cold Lake, Peace River, and Wabasca
go directly to market.
Since 2005, companies have blended
some of the DilBit and all of the SynBit
with conventional heavy crudes into
Western Canadian Select (WCS). DilBits,
WCS, and conventional heavy crudes
compete in the market.
As bitumen production grows,
producers will need more diluent.
Producers already use nearly all the

may be recycled from Midwest refineries. The future supply of bitumen blend
will depend on bitumen production,
upgrading capacity, and the source and
type of diluent used.

Bitumen blend qualities vary due to
the bitumen quality as well as the quality and ratio of diluent in the blends.
Fig. 6 compares distillations.
DilBit with about 25% condensate
contains around 36% vacuum resid.
SynBit with about 50% SCO contains
about 28% vacuum resid and about
36% VGO. Refineries need large cokers
to process DilBit and large FCC units
to process SynBit. The uncertainty of
diluent sourcing and the impact on
bitumen blend quality make planning
for new refinery projects difficult. The
sulfur distribution varies due to diluent
blending. Some of the bitumen blends
from Athabasca and Peace River have
high total acid numbers (TAN), so that
refiners may require special metallurgy
to process these blends.

An increase in ethane cracking contributed to reduced coproduct propylene supply during first-quarter 2008.
Because gas-plant ethane production
will likely continue to increase during
second and third-quarter 2008, ethane
cracking will remain strong and may
set additional records. Concurrently,
however, coproduct propylene supply
will remain tight.

Production, million lb/d

Ethylene industry demand for
fresh feed averaged 1.68 million b/d
in fourth-quarter 2007; demand was
slightly lower in first-quarter 2008 at an
average of 1.61 million b/d. Demand
for LPG feedstocks (ethane, propane,
and normal butane) averaged 1.16 million b/d in fourth-quarter 2007 and
fell to 1.13 million b/d in first-quarter
2008.
Due to the decline in LPG demand,
ethylene producers cracked a somewhat heavier feed slate in fourthquarter 2007, but the feed slate shifted
lighter during first-quarter 2008.
Specifically, LPG feeds accounted for
70% of total fresh feed in first-quarter
2008 vs. 69% of fresh feed in fourthquarter 2007.
Demand for propane and normal
butane typically rebound during first
quarter. Propane demand, however,
remained nearly constant during firstquarter 2008 vs. fourth-quarter 2007
and demand for normal butane was
unusually weak.
In contrast, demand for ethane
remained robust during fourth-quarter
2007 and first-quarter 2008. Specifically, ethane’s share of total fresh feed
increased to 50.3% during first-quarter
2008 vs. 49.5% during fourth-quarter
2007 and 47.4% during third-quarter
2007. Demand for ethane set record
highs on a volumetric basis in December 2007 (847,000 b/d) and on a
share of fresh feed basis in March 2008
(52.3%).
Table 1 shows trends in olefin plants’
fresh feed slates.
Based on projected ethylene industry operating rates of 85-88%
for second and third-quarter 2008,
total demand for fresh feedstocks
will average 1.55-1.65 million b/d.
Total demand for LPG feedstocks will
average 1.15-1.20 million b/d during
first-quarter 2008 and will increase to
1.20-1.25 million b/d during secondquarter 2008.

contributed to reduced production in
first-quarter 2008, but ethylene producers also reduced operating rates in
multifeed crackers due to unfavorable
economics for naphthas, condensates,
and gas oils.
Production from LPG plants totaled

Ethylene economics, prices
Feedstock prices, coproduct values,
and ethylene plant yields determine
ethylene production costs. Petral Worldwide maintains direct contact with the
olefin industry and track historic trends
in spot prices for ethylene and propylene. We use a variety of sources to track
trends in feedstock prices.
Some ethylene plants have the
necessary process units to convert all
coproducts into high-purity streams.
Some ethylene plants, however, do not
have the capability to upgrade mixed
or crude streams of various coproducts
and sell some or all their coproducts at
discounted prices. We evaluate ethylene
production costs in this article based on
all coproducts valued at spot prices.

than in early January.
Spot prices for propane and natural
gasoline declined 15.8% and 14.3%,
respectively, during mid-January
through mid-February. More significantly, however, spot prices for natural
gasoline increased 15.5¢/gal (10.8%)
during mid-February through midMarch; purity ethane prices were steady
at 94-96¢/gal.
Gas-plant ethane production in the
Rocky Mountains began to increase in
September-October 2007 and many
feedstock buyers and gas processors anticipated additional production growth.
Furthermore, a series of ethylene plants
started turnarounds in February and
March 2008.
The anticipation of greater ethane
production and the temporary but minor slump in demand tipped the ethane
market into a modest surplus during
February and March. Finally, feedstock
buyers and ethane producers seemed
remarkably reluctant to accumulate
any inventory during the various plant
turnarounds. The shift in perceptions
regarding ethane supply and pricing
had an unexpected bearish effect on
ethane prices during February through
mid-May.

Our tabulation of global oil production
includes lease condensate but excludes
NGLs, which are commonly included
in global petroleum production statistics.
Global crude production has not
declined on a year-to-year average basis
since 1980-84. Furthermore, global
demand declined in response to a surge
in oil prices after the Iranian revolution
and forced producers to curtail global
crude production.
Our price forecasts for ethylene feedstocks, production costs, and ethylene
and propylene prices are based on the
view that crude prices will remain in
a strong bullish trend. Price forecasts
published in fourth-quarter 2007 were
bullish, but prices exceeded our bullish
expectations. Forecasts for West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) crude prices of
$150/bbl, $175/bbl, and even $200/
bbl before yearend 2008 are now almost commonplace.
Our forecasts for ethylene production costs for second and third quarters 2008 are based on WTI prices
of $125-150/bbl. Although there is
increasing evidence that U.S. gasoline
demand has begun to decline, demand
for refined products in the developing
economics continues to grow. Global
competition for stagnant crude supply
will remain a bullish factor for crude
and petrochemical feedstock prices this
year.
ULR-WTI pricing differentials were
below expectations during first-quarter
2008 and the strong bounce forecast
for April and May fizzled. Furthermore,
slumping demand for gasoline will
keep bearish pressure on ULR-WTI
differentials during second and third
quarters.
Rising crude prices, however, will
push ULR prices on the US Gulf Coast
to $3.1-3.2/gal in second-quarter 2008
and $3.3-3.5/gal in third-quarter 2008.
These forecasts set the economic basis
for feedstock prices including light
naphthas and propane.
Spot prices for purity ethane in Mont

Belvieu rebounded in late May and early
June and have a significant potential
to increase another 20-30¢/gal during
third-quarter 2008.
Ethylene production costs (full cash
costs) will be about 55-60¢/lb for purity ethane, 64-66¢/lb for propane, and
72-76¢/lb for natural gasoline in thirdquarter 2008. The projected increase in
production costs will push both spot
and contract ethylene prices higher
during third-quarter 2008.
By early June, spot ethylene prices
had already reached 60¢/lb. Spot prices
for ethylene will increase to 64-68¢/lb
by September. Contract prices will average 72¢/lb for third-quarter 2008 and
will increase to 74-75¢/lb in September. ✦

INDEXES FOR FINISHED STEELS

Gary Farrar
Contributing Editor

Nelson-Farrar indexes for finished
steels changed drastically during
2004-07. Generally speaking, the alloy
steels changed less than carbon steel
products.
Alloy bars started the period with
an index value of 874.8 and peaked at

Alloy
sheets

Structural
plates

How indexes
have changed

Coldrolled
sheets

Alloy
bars

1,689.3. Alloy sheets were at an index
value of 563.7 in early 2004, and at
1,084.9 in early 2007.
Index for cold-rolled sheets was
1,083.9 during first-quarter 2004,
and was 2,086.6 during first-quarter
2007. During the same 4-year period,
structural plates started at an index of
1,209.0 and hit a high of 2,019.2 in

early 2007.
Composite index for steel products were as high as 1,689.3 during
second-quarter 2007, up from 1,069.6
in first-quarter 2004. The composite
category includes all steel-mill products.
This analysis shows a large increase
in the cost of finished steels during
2004-07. ✦

I TEMIZED REFINING COST INDEXES
The cost indexes may be used to convert prices at any date to prices at other dates by ratios to the cost indexes of the same
date. Item indexes are published each quarter (first week issue of January, April, July, and October). In addition the Nelson
Construction and Operating Cost Indexes are published in the first issue of each month of Oil and Gas Journal.

Operating cost
(based on 1956 = 100.0):
Power, industrial electrical
Fuel, refinery price
Gulf cargoes
NY barges
Chicago low sulfur
Western US
Central US
Natural gas at wellhead
Inorganic chemicals
Acid, hydrofluoric
Acid, sulfuric
Platinum
Sodium carbonate
Sodium hydroxide
Sodium phosphate
Organic chemicals
Furfural
MEK, tank-car lots

The Texas-Gulf Coast
natural gas pipeline
buildout during the last
year has caused price and
flow changes offering a
Pipelines
glimpse into what will
likely take place as the
construction boom continues. Even as
these projects advance, however, the
scope of announced storage projects
in the region
has raised the
possibility of a
large excess in
capacity moving forward.
One of
the most
important pipeline projects affecting
the Southeast-US Gulf region, CenterPoint’s Carthage-to-Perryville project,
went online in May 2007, adding 1.2
bcfd of capacity between Carthage, Tex.,
and Delhi, La., near Perryville. Four
other new projects entered service in
first-quarter 2008. Three projects built
by Trunkline, NGPL, and Gulf South
increased capacity eastward out of Texas
by 2.5 bcfd (OGJ, Apr. 28, 2008, p. 57).
A fourth project on the Enbridge Texas
pipeline system added upstream transportation from the Bossier Sands area of
East Texas to South Texas.
This first part of two articles examines the basis shifts already underway

E AST TEXAS FLOWS INTO CARTHAGE-PERRYVILLE

Texas-Gulf Coast pipeline projects
have led to a large increase in deliveries
from Texas into the Southeast US-Gulf
Coast region. Imports from Northeast Texas into the area via CarthagePerryville are up an average of 1.8
bcfd so far in 2008 as compared to
the same period in 2007, including a
1-bcfd gain on CenterPoint’s CP Line
and a 700,000-MMcfd increase on Gulf
South’s East Texas to Mississippi expansion. Figs. 1 and 2 show the flow and
capacity patterns from East Texas to Perryville and South Texas into the Henry
Hub via the Houston Ship Channel,
respectively.
Despite limited capacity to move gas
east from Perryville, the pipeline expansion projects have already led to price
increases in the Carthage area and other
parts of Texas.
Fig. 3 shows the Carthage Hub basis
moving from an average of –$0.54/
MMbtu in the first 3 months of 2007
to –$0.24/MMbtu for the same period
in 2008. Carthage prices at the beginning of April were rapidly closing the

Flows shift
Since no new capacity east of Perryville has been placed into service yet,
access to premium Southeast delivery
locations, such as Transco Zone 4 and
FGT Z3, remains constrained, causing
incremental gas flow into Perryville to
move primarily along Columbia Gulf.
The subsequent increase in deliveries to Columbia Gulf has led to a
decrease in northbound flows out of
Henry Hub to Perryville. Columbia Gulf
reconfigured its Rayne compressor last
year, allowing southbound flows to

gap with Henry Hub and may rise into
positive territory compared to the Hub
in reaction to new capacity between the
Perryville Hub and delivery points at
the edge of the Southeast US-Gulf Coast
supply bubble.
Houston Ship Channel prices and basis have also gained substantial ground,
moving from –$0.49/MMbtu in first
quarter 2007 to –$0.30/MMbtu a year
later and averaging –$0.15/MMbtu
for the first three weeks of April 2008.
Carthage and the Houston Ship Channel
have also closed the gap with points in
the premium Southeast market, including Transco Zone 4. The Houston Ship
Channel-Transco Z4 spread has dropped
to $0.61/MMbtu on average in firstquarter 2008 compared to $0.84/
MMbtu first-quarter 2007.

interconnects to
accommodate the
increased supply
arriving into its system in the Perryville
area. The company also reactivated two
interconnections with Transco in South
Louisiana and boosted capacity at its
FGT interconnection in May, allowing
more Perryville gas to reach premium
market points in South Louisiana by
displacement.
Northbound flows from Henry Hub
to Perryville on Columbia have declined
700 MMcfd so far in 2008, compared
with a year earlier. Although a net
northbound flow on Columbia remains,
the increased supply in the Perryville
area is displacing enough northbound
material from South Louisiana to effectively allow more gas to be delivered to
South Louisiana interconnects.
Similar flow changes have occurred
on Texas Gas and to a lesser degree
Trunkline.
In contrast with previous years,
when these pipes moved gas through
Perryville and into the Midwest and
Ohio Valley, they now deliver more
gas into interconnects in South Louisiana, providing access to Southeast
and Northeast markets. These flow
shifts caused the price at Perryville to
drop below Henry Hub last year when
the Carthage-to-Perryville line went
into service and continue to pressure
Perryville pricing, which has averaged
$0.02/MMbtu less than Henry Hub
since January 2008 (Fig. 4), compared

with a $0.04 premium to Henry Hub
during first-quarter 2007.
Flows on the Gulf South ETX to MS
Pipeline expansion have similarly increased supplies into Transco at Holmesville, Miss., and TETCO at Kosciusko,
Miss.

Upcoming shift
The Gulf South Southeast Gulf
expansion added 1.3 bcfd from Harrisville, Miss., into the Transco Zone 4
pool when it entered service May 31,
2008. The Southeast Supply Header
will add 1.0 bcfd from Perryville, La.,
to Gulfstream in second-quarter 2008.
These two developments will debottleneck the gas supply corridor between
Perryville and the premium Southeast
pricing region, shifting both west-east
and north-south price differentials.
The remainder of this first part of
the article will focus on Gulf South
flows during the first 4 months of 2008
and examine a likely scenario of flow
and pricing shifts as the Southeast Gulf
expansion comes online.
Boardwalk’s Gulf South Pipeline is
a network-based system that generally
transports gas from northeastern and
southeastern Texas into North Louisiana on two main pipeline legs. The
pipeline also has traditionally transported supply from South Louisiana
to the premium Southeast on another
pipeline leg. Its latest East Texas-toMississippi expansion of 1.7 bcfd will
allow Gulf South to flow additional
gas from Carthage, Tex., across North

flowing into expansion delivery points,
including Columbia Gulf at Delhi, La.,
Texas Gas at Bosco, La., and TETCO at
South Raymond.
Opening the Gulf South Southeast
Expansion allows Gulf South to flow 1.3
bcfd directly to Transco Station 85 vs. its
previously limited access to the premium Southeast market (Fig. 6). Most of
the new capacity will fill immediately,
with the following consequences:
• Prices in the Transco Zone 4 pool
will come under downward pressure,
likely flattening the price differential
between Carthage and Transco Station
85.
• Gulf South deliveries into Transco
at Holmesville will decline.
• Supply pressures at Perryville will
decline, resulting in lower deliveries into Columbia and other pipelines
and a reduced incentive to displace gas
moving from Henry Hub.

McCain more like
Democrats than
Bush on energy
In another display of confusion about
energy, Democratic leaders in Congress
responded to oil-supply initiatives from
the US president and the Republican who
would succeed him as though they were
identical.
They couldn’t be more wrong. But give
them time.
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) gave a
speech in Houston in which he switched

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

position to call for exploration off the East
and West Coasts.
McCain upholstered the appeal with
harsh criticism of oil exporters and speculators, a restatement of opposition to limited
leasing of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and a pitch for his cap-and-trade plan
for greenhouse-gas emissions.
The next day, President George W. Bush
offered an energy package that differed
importantly from McCain’s in substance
and tone.
Like McCain, Bush called for exploration of federal waters now inaccessible to
producers. But he also advocated leasing of
the ANWR Coastal Plain, restoration of an
oil-shale leasing mechanism, and stimulation of reﬁnery construction.
Bush mentioned the disadvantages of
US reliance on foreign oil but did not, as
McCain had done, harangue about exporters. Neither did he demonize speculators or
veer off into global warming.
While the president did lapse into his
vacuous rhetoric about “our addiction to
oil,” his message on oil supply was rounded
and thoughtful. It made McCain’s look halfbaked and coarse. Obsessed as they are
with “windfall proﬁts” and “price gouging,”
Democrats saw no difference.
If Bush and McCain were serious about
addressing gasoline prices, said Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid of Nevada in a
typical Democratic response, “They would
stop offering the same old ideas meant to
pad the pockets of Big Oil and work with
Democrats to reduce our dependence on
oil, invest in renewable energy sources,
crack down on excessive speculation, and
stand up to countries colluding to shake
down American consumers.”
Someone who had heard McCain’s
speech logically might expect the Arizona
senator to feel mostly the same way about
Bush’s plan.
He is not, of course, the ﬁrst Republican
to lean toward the other party on energy.
This helps explain why so much promising
federal land produces no oil or gas.

Markets ignore rumors of war
There was virtually no reaction in world oil markets when Iran denied the rumor
that Israeli aircraft had attacked its nuclear facilities on June 23, saying such an act
would be “impossible.”
Normally tales of a possible war in the Middle East provoke a collective knee-jerk
reaction from energy traders in fear of supply disruptions. When Israel’s Transport
Minister Shaul Mofaz earlier said Israel would mount such an attack if Iran continues
its program for developing nuclear weapons, benchmark US light, sweet crudes shot
to a then record intraday high of $139.12/bbl before closing at a record $134.54/bbl
June 6 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up a whopping $10.75 in the biggest
1-day gain ever at that point.
Oil price records were plentiful in June. As the US dollar fell, the August contract
for benchmark US light, sweet crudes hit an intraday high of $140.39/bbl June 26 on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, then closed at a record $139.64/bbl. Despite huge
intraday swings, however, prices were held around $135/bbl for most of the month.
Crude prices climbed in early trading June 20 following reports that Israel’s large
military exercise in the eastern Mediterranean was really practice for a potential
bombing attack on Iran’s nuclear plants. Yet subsequent talk of an actual attack by
bombers failed to generate any buzz at all.
“We had not heard the rumor before it was on the screen, and we still wonder if
there was ever a rumor given the market’s lack of price action,” said Olivier Jakob at
Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland. “Israel has taken great care to publicize its ‘Glorious
Spartan’ military exercise over the Mediterranean between May 28 and June 12, and
we have to wonder where this rumor of an attack on Iran started from.”
Israelis train
Under Glorious Spartan, more than 100 Israeli ﬁghters together with bombers
and rescue helicopters reportedly trained with the Greek air force over the Mediterranean, replicating the ﬂying distance and mid-air refueling necessary for a ﬂight from
Israel to Iran. Maneuvers reportedly included low ﬂying over mountainous terrain, a
mock attack on a well-defended airbase in Greece, and practice with live ammunition
at a nearby ﬁring range for aircraft.
Jakob said, “There is deﬁnitely some psychological warfare going on, but turning
to the operational realities we note that the Olympics run Aug. 8-24 and is followed
by Ramadan Sept. 1-30.” Ramadan is one of the most holy Muslim religious observances.
An Israeli air raid would need approval from the US military to penetrate Iraqi air
space to reach Iran. “We would give little chance of a US nod for an attack during the
Olympics; Israel might not care about striking during Ramadan,” Jakob said. “Any
attack during that timeframe would expose US troops in the [Persian] Gulf to greater
grievance and risk.”
Moreover, the US Navy had only one carrier, the USS Lincoln, in the gulf in late
June. “Carrier deployment plans have been disturbed by a ﬁre on the USS George
Washington on its voyage from Norfolk, [Va.,] to the East Paciﬁc, forcing it to stop
in San Diego for repairs until August. The USS Reagan is stationed near Hong Kong
and unless it was to sail to the gulf we will view the possibility of air bombardment
on Iran not an immediate reality,” Jakob said at that time.
However, John Bolton, former US ambassador to the United Nations and an
advocate of hard line foreign and defense policies who is inﬂuential among conservative Republicans, said he expects Israel will likely to attack Iran sometime “between the November presidential election in the US and the inauguration of the new
president.” Bolton was US representative to the UN August 2005-December 2006 on
a recess appointment. He is now counsel to the law ﬁrm Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, DC.
Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency
under the UN, claims an attack on Iran would turn the Middle East into “a ﬁreball.”
He threatened to resign his ofﬁce if there is an attack.
Meanwhile, the European Union imposed new sanctions on Iran, curbing travel
for certain Iranians and freezing some banking assets. “The carrot and the stick approach continues as on the same day the US administration leaked to the press that
it was debating opening a US diplomatic interest section in Teheran. In order to do
this without the administration appearing to the public as capitulating would probably need to be accompanied by another toughening of sanctions,” Jakob said.

It takes extraordinary expertise
to make well placements
extraordinarily precise.
The extreme complexities of many existing oil and gas reservoirs
make optimal well positioning critically important. To that end,
economic success is based squarely on the right combination of
experienced geosteering specialists, superior technology to guide
the bit and an accurately placed and optimized bottomhole assembly with the correct MWD or LWD components.
Halliburton’s abundance of these critical resources—plus real-time
drilling technology and process optimization that’s viewed within a
Halliburton Real Time Center™ (where drilling is connected with
geophysicists and geologists)—can result in reduced rig costs and
increased reserve recovery and production. All this, with enhanced
safety and diminished environmental risk.
To meet your precise well-placement challenges, unleash
Halliburton’s precision solutions. For additional details, visit us at

s oil and natural gas drilling and production activity
fans out into ever more hostile environments and
increasingly complex geology, the basket of downhole tools available to the operator is growing more
sophisticated.
Much of the emphasis is on taking the guesswork out of
what is happening downhole, as industry continues to take
steps toward the “Holy Grail” of the all-digital oil ﬁeld.
That’s critical for companies coping with the high temperatures and pressures of deep gas plays, the complex well geometries of multilateral and other extended-reach wells, and
complicated logistics of deepwater subsea completions.

“New devices that are under development can economically provide real measurements of downhole conditions,
thereby providing valuable information that can be used to

where we can improve.”

New tools for unconventional resources

Challenges abound for service and supply companies developing new downhole tools, notably in the area of unconventional
resources, according to Martin van Onna, general manager,

oiled tubing (CT) drilling and well service applications
are being improved by a host of new downhole tools to
serve this fast-growing area of drilling and production.
As demand for CT drilling and well services grows,
service and supply companies are responding with new downhole tools for horizontal and extended-reach/multilateral drilling,
underbalanced and overbalanced drilling, well stimulation, cleanouts/solids removal, frac jobs, perforations, cutting and milling, and plug removal.
Among the leaders in this ﬁeld are BJ Services and the Baker Oil Tools division of Baker Hughes.

Extended-reach/multilateral wells
Operators are increasingly developing new ﬁelds and redeveloping mature ﬁelds by drilling multilateral wells to extend reservoir access and enhance the effective drainage from minimal
surface facilities, notes John Misselbrook, BJ Services senior
advisor for coiled tubing technology.
“Stimulating or cleaning out these multilateral wells can
be challenging without technology designed to navigate and

continued workover motor R&D work and a speciﬁc, highly
experienced, engineering cutting-and-milling single-focused
team. As our insert technology has advanced, our successes
have been passed on to our customers, with the development
of systems to provide ﬁt-for-purpose solutions for the cutting
or milling of material as diverse as 13% chrome, 25% Super
Duplex chrome, SM2535, Inconel™ 718, and 925 Incoloy™.
Baker Oil Tools’ provision of engineering, tools, and application services to a North Sea customer allowed for the successful completion of the world’s ﬁrst casing exit window to be created out of duplex 25% chrome casing, Mackenzie cites.
“This successful campaign of exits, where actual wellbore
operations saw a 60% milling time improvement over onshore
ﬁeld trials, prompted the client drilling superintendent to say,
‘The windows were critical to the viability of the Scott TTRD
project. This new milling technology was developed by an excellent approach to testing and engineering” and the director
of global drilling to comment, ‘The driver for us was obvious; by
overcoming a technical barrier, we opened up the possibility of
achieving improved returns from a maturing asset.’”
The Baker Oil Tools DELTA Exit System™ was developed
from experience garnered from creating a casing exit on a
well-publicized underbalanced CT drilling campaign in the
Middle East.
“These particular wells required the casing exit to be milled
while still maintaining gas production, which necessitated the
use of a predominantly gas driven power medium,” Mackenzie notes. “However, milling a casing exit in such an environment created signiﬁcant vibration
issues that ultimately led to the
development of the single-trip
DELTA Exit System to mitigate
such problems.
“One of the initial runs of the
DELTA Exit System allowed for a
window to be milled with coiled
tubing prior to the open-hole section being drilled utilizing the Baker Hughes Inteq CoilTrak system.
Two laterals, with a combined total
footage of 3,593 ft, were created
out of the 7-in. liner prior to the retrieval of the DELTA whipstock back through the 5.625-in. restriction.”

Plug removal
The largest market for plug removal operations presently is
in North America in the removal of composite bridge and frac
plugs, according to Mackenzie.
“Composite plugging devices are required to be removed
quickly and reliably—and in many cases in multiples—from
the wellbore in a single trip in order to achieve client returns,”
he says. “The average CT drill-out time for a cast iron bridge
plug is approximately 1 hr, as compared with less than 20 min.

plugs are used in a wellbore, the drill-out time begins to grow
exponentially, a factor that is not evidenced in composite technology operations.
“At Baker Oil Tools, we have and continue to invest signiﬁcant R&D into the operations of design, manufacture, supply,
and installation of the composite plugging devices and associated setting equipment, as well as the investment in technology for the coiled tubing removal of these same plugs.
“We have multiple examples of operations where we have
set and removed signiﬁcant quantities of composite plugs for
frac operations. In one such instance, the operator required the
setting and subsequent removal of 18 composite bridge plugs
within its 4.5-in., 13.50#/ft tubing string.
“After performing successful frac operations, a 3.7-in. OD

a maximum weight on bit of 3,000 lb, all 18 bridge plugs and an
additional 120 ft of wellbore ﬁll were removed in a single coiled
tubing trip.
“Looking forward, we are starting to see increased areas of
opportunity with very large growth potential for coiled tubing
frac plug operations and subsequent removal operations outside the North American markets.”

Technology gaps
Determining well depth is a still a challenge for CT applications,
according to Mackenzie.

“It is well known that accurately determining
depth in a well with coiled tubing is problematic, and the question of accurate, real-time depth
correlation when intervening on coiled tubing is
one that still needs to be addressed.
— Gordon Mackenzie, Baker Oil Tools

“It is well known that accurately determining depth in a well
with coiled tubing is problematic, and the question of accurate,
real-time depth correlation when intervening on coiled tubing is
one that still needs to be addressed.
“Although there are any number of devices and methodologies that can be employed to help determine depth, I believe
there still to be a technology gap to be answered here.”
On the lateral well front, one of the main issues prevalent
today is in the identiﬁcation of where the required lateral to
enter is and how to reliably and consistently get the CT and
related BHA to enter it, Mackenzie adds: “Some systems do
exist today to help in this, but I would suggest there is still a
technology gap to be ﬁlled here.” ]

facility. And the path to it is our PlantWeb digital architecture.Whether upstream
or downstream, offshore or onshore, Emerson gives you insight to make better
operating decisions. You’ll find inefficiencies that rob performance and profit and
add risk...like unplanned outages, wasted maintenance, excessive energy
consumption, process variability or threats to HS&E. Your people will operate more
effectively as well. Learn more at _____________________

Japan offers loan to rebuild Iraq’s infrastructure

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

access disputes.
The proposed regulations are designed to establish a way for
shippers of oil and gas from federal leases on the Outer Continental
Shelf to notify MMS if they believe they have been denied open and
nondiscriminatory access to pipelines on the OCS, the agency said
in a notice published in the Federal Register.
The rules also would provide MMS with tools to assure that
pipeline companies provide open and nondiscriminatory access to
their systems, it added.
MMS noted that the OCS Lands Act mandates that pipelines provide such access to both owner and nonowner shippers. It said
the proposed rules would implement complaint procedures and
alternative measures for shippers who allege they have been denied such access. It said it would accept comments on the proposal
through June 5 and on its reporting burden by May 7.

The Japanese government has agreed to lend Iraq some ¥102.8
billion ($862 million), with just over half of it earmarked for reconstruction of Iraq’s oil pipelines, refineries, and export terminal
facilities.
Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ¥50 billion would be
used to upgrade Iraq’s oil export facilities, while another ¥2 billion will enable refurbishment of a refinery in Basra on the Persian
Gulf.
The ministry released a statement that Iraq boasts the world’s
third-largest crude oil reserves and that it is important for Japan to
build a long-term strategic partnership with Iraq.
In February, Japan imported 290,973 kl of crude oil from Iraq
out of total worldwide imports of 18.7 million kl.
The ministry said another ¥32.6 billion in loans will go toward
rebuilding Iraq’s power sector, and some ¥18 billion, for the repair

Marathon makes oil discovery in deepwater GOM similar to that encountered by the 1994 Troika discovery well at
Marathon Oil Corp. has made a deepwater discovery on Green
Canyon Block 244 (OCS-G 11043) in 2,900 ft of water in the Gulf
of Mexico about 137 miles south-southwest of Venice, La.
The Droshky-1 well (previously named Troika Deep) was drilled
to a TD of 21,190 ft and encountered high-quality oil-bearing reservoirs. The well logged about 250 ft of net oil pay, with thickness

the same location, according to an analyst note. Troika has estimated recoverable reserves of 220 million boe, the analyst said, adding
that conservative estimates of recoverable reserves at Droshky are
placed at 100-150 million boe.
Development of the discovery is possible through the Troika
Unit infrastructure about 2 miles from the Droshky well.

Preparation has begun for drilling of two sidetrack wells, which
are expected to take 30 days each. Marathon has the drilling rig
under contract until the end of the sidetrack program, after which
engineering development studies will follow, the company said.
Marathon holds a 100% interest in the Droshky-1 well and a
50% interest in the Troika Unit.

Dominion acquires block off Tanzania

Toreador Resources Corp. and its partners reported that final test
results from the Alapli-1 exploration well yielded a commingled
flow rate of 7 MMcfd of gas from just outside the South Akcakos
subbasin in the Black Sea off Turkey.
Toreador’s joint venture partners are Turkish national oil firm
TPAO and Stratic Energy Corp. (OGJ Newsletter, Mar. 19, 2007).
On final test, the Alapli-1 well’s flow came from 15 m of perforations. The three zones were 1,068-1,242 m TVD in the Eoceneage Kusuri formation. The final test was a commingled flow from
all three zones through a 32⁄64-in. choke with a flowing pressure of
1,080 psi. Dallas-basded Toreador has a 36.75% interest in the well,
while TPAO has 51% interest and Stratic has the remaining 12.25%.

Dominion Petroleum Ltd. has signed a production-sharing
agreement with Tanzanian government agency Tanzanian Petroleum Development Corp. (TDPC) for an exploration block off eastern Tanzania.
Block 7 covers 8,500 sq km on the continental slope and lies in
100-3,000 m of water in the Indian Ocean.
Dominion plans to spend at least $8.75 million during the initial 4-year exploration period—$1 million on geological and geophysical surveys, $4 million on acquiring more than 4,000 km of
2D seismic data, and $3.75 million on acquiring more than 500
sq km of 3D seismic.
Initial data analysis previously acquired by Dominion suggests
there are encouraging prospects in the shallower part of Block 7 at
drillable depth. The company is required to drill a well before the
second 4-year term.
Previously, Dominion entered into three PSAs with TDPC covering more than 10 million acres in the onshore Mandawa, Kisingire,
Lukuliro, and Selous licenses and was scheduled to drill four wells
(OGJ, July 10, 2006, Newsletter).

Southern Tanzania gas project growing

EnCana lets FEED contract for Deep Panuke ﬁeld

Artumas Group Inc., Calgary, expects its Msimbati-1X exploration well to become the second hydrocarbon discovery in the
Mnazi Bay concession, Rovuma basin, in southern Tanzania.
The well, 2.5 km southeast of the Mnazi Bay-3 well site, went
to TD 6,570 ft and penetrated the primary objective Middle Miocene sands (Msimbati Prospect) at 4,800 ft. These sands represent a
high-amplitude fairway separate from Mnazi Bay gas field.
At 6,000 ft, the well encountered the classic Miocene/Oligocene sandstone formations of Mnazi Bay gas field, which the MB-2
and MB-3 wells appraised. Drillstem test results are expected in
mid-April. The field was discovered in 1982 and began delivering
gas in January through a 27-km pipeline to the 12-Mw Mtwara
electric power station (OGJ Online, Sept. 27, 2006).
Artumas approved 60 line-km of 2D seismic surveys that will
focus on highgrading a deeper exploration prospect for an Eocene/
Cretaceous oil test on the Mwambo Prospect. The company expects
to drill a well in the third quarter.

EnCana Corp. let a front-end engineering and development contract to Intec Engineering and IMV Projects Atlantic for the subsea
and pipeline design for EnCana’s Deep Panuke dry gas development
off Nova Scotia.
The FEED work will result in bid packages for the subsea and
pipeline engineering, procurement, and construction contracts
and will support project sanction, expected by yearend.
Deep Panuke is to recover 390-890 bcf of sales gas, with a mean
estimate of 630 bcf, at the rate of 300 MMcfd. The field would
produce for 8 to 171⁄2 years.
EnCana earlier proposed two pipeline options to handle the gas:
One is an offshore connection to the Sable Offshore Energy Project
pipeline, operating since the end of 1999. The other is a separate
176-km subsea pipeline adjacent to the SOEP line with a linkup
onshore near Goldboro, NS. Either would deliver to the Maritimes
& Northeast Pipeline (OGJ Online, Nov. 17, 2006). ✦

AWE expects production from Tui ﬁeld at midyear

Repsol YPF to use two Dalma rigs in Algeria

Australian Worldwide Exploration Ltd. Group, Sydney, is expecting the “Umuroa” floating production, storage, and offloading vessel to reach its Tui area oil development off New Zealand in midApril. The field is on Taranaki basin permit PMP 38158 about 50
km offshore (OGJ Online, May 8, 2006).
The FPSO sailed from Singapore earlier this month.
AWE, which became project operator after acquiring New Zealand Overseas Petroleum Ltd. in early 2006, said it anticipates starting production June 30. Peak production is expected to be about
50,000 b/d.
AWE holds a 42.5% interest in Tui field. Japanese company Mitsui has 35%, New Zealand Oil & Gas subsidiary Stewart Petroleum
holds 12.5%, and Pan Pacific Petroleum NL of Sydney has 10%.

Repsol YPF SA has let a $23.24 million contract to Dalma Energy for two deep-drilling land rigs to be used in Algeria.
Repsol YPF operates a group that last year reported several gas
discoveries in the Reggane basin of Algeria’s Sahara Desert (OGJ
Online, May 18, 2006).
Dalma, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aabar Petroleum Investments Co. PJSC, Abu Dhabi, owns 22 rigs, all under contract in the
Middle East, North Africa, India, and Southeast Asia.
The 2,000-hp rigs under contract to Repsol YPF were built in
China at a cost of $22 million each.

Group Inc., East Falmouth, Mass., to design, build, and install a
meteorological and oceanographic measurement system on BPTT’s
Cassia oil and gas production complex off eastern Trinidad and Tobago.
Woods Hole will provide systems design, integration, installation, and real-time data display along with monthly data monitoring and archiving during the 24-month project.
Measurement of the predominant and spurious currents and
waves and their impact in this environment is important for the
continued safe and efficient operation of BPTT’s production platforms off Trinidad and Tobago’s east coast, Woods Hole said.
The BPTT Cassia Metocean system will consist of two Nortek
AWAC acoustic Doppler current profilers—arranged to generate a
continuous profile of currents through the 90 m water column and
measure wave height and direction at the installed location—and
several wind, barometric pressure, and temperature-relative humidity sensors.
The systems will be integrated into the Woods Hole integrated
real-time system, which will acquire and store all raw data and
display the processed data on the Cassia production complex for
operational use in real time through a web-based data server application. It will enable BPTT and BP’s affiliate offices in Houston
to view the real-time processed data through any BP web-enabled
access port. ✦

China reﬁnery due delayed coker heaters
CNOOC Oil & Petrochemicals Co. Ltd. (COPC) has let a thermal
design, engineering, procurement, and material supply contract to
Foster Wheeler USA Corp. for two delayed coker heaters for a fourdrum delayed coking unit to be installed at COPC’s newly constructed 250,000 b/d refinery in Huizhou, Guangdong Province,
China.
The delayed coker heaters will use Foster Wheeler’s Terrace-Wall
design.
Foster Wheeler previously was awarded the process design
package contract for the delayed coking unit, which will be based
on the company’s Selective Yield Delayed Coking (SYDEC) process.
Foster Wheeler said the delayed coker heaters are an integral component of the SYDEC process technology.
The new $2.64 billion refinery will process crude oil from
CNOOC’s Penglai field in Bohai Bay (OGJ Online, Sept. 8, 2005).

China plans three petrochemical plants at Daqing
Authorities in Daqing, China, near the projected terminus of
Russia’s East Siberia Pacific Ocean oil pipeline, are planning several
large-scale petrochemicals developments.
According to China’s National Development and Reform Commission, projects being designed include a 1.2 million-tonne/year
ethylene plant, a 450,000-tpy propylene facility, and a 1 milliontpy fertilizer plant.
The plans were announced even as oil output from Daqing field,
operated by a PetroChina Co. unit, has been declining in the past
several years, dropping by 3.4% in 2006 to 43.41 million tonnes.

Despite the downturn, Chinese authorities expect the pipeline
to make up the domestic production shortfall by delivering as
much as 30,000 tpy of crude from Russia’s East Siberian fields.
According to Russian state media, quoting Chinese official
sources, preparations by China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC)
for the construction of a branch of the ESPO line are well under
way.
“We’re confident that the branch will be built, and we’re conducting active preparations for this,” a CNPC management source
told Interfax-China, adding that CNPC has begun cooperation with
Russia’s Transneft for construction of the line.

Creek, Colo., natural gas processing plant to the Overland Pass
Pipeline via the proposed 150-mile pipeline extension.
Construction on the 14-in. lateral pipeline is expected to begin
around mid-2008 with start-up scheduled for early 2009. Upon
completion, the lateral will transport volumes from an existing
Williams’ plant. Volumes from Williams’ recently announced Willow Creek plant are expected to be transported in third quarter
2009.
Along with construction expenditures of $433 million for the
Overland Pass Pipeline, Oneok Partners is spending an additional
$216 million to expand and upgrade its existing NGL fractionation
capabilities and the capacity of its NGL distribution pipelines.
Oneok Partners is managing the construction of the Overland

Price-gouging politics
Decisions about energy policy, important as
they are to consumers and taxpayers, should
evolve from honest, level-headed discourse. The
US instead gets this: “As gas prices rise, so do Big
Oil’s efforts to deceive the American public.”
The statement came Apr. 10 from Rep. Bart
Stupak (D-Mich.), sponsor of legislation to make
“price-gouging” illegal (OGJ Online, Feb. 28,
2007). Stupak was responding to a study by W.
David Montgomery of CRA International for the
American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF).
The study likens price-gouging laws to price
controls, which it estimates would increase the
economic losses of a supply disruption as large
as those following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in
2005 by $1.9 billion (see p. 26). It says past price
controls have aggravated shortage and worsened
conditions for consumers. And it asserts that
making price increases that occur during energy
disruptions criminal offenses would discourage
delivery of the costly replacement supplies consumers need.

on labor, health, and construction are even more
suspect. He has received $376,250 from industrial
unions, $323,207 from health professionals, and
$318,350 from building trade unions.
What Stupak calls “the fact of the matter” about
the FTC investigation is incorrect. FTC did not
find that “petroleum producers and refiners” were
gouging consumers. It didn’t investigate producers
and had no reason to do so; producers don’t sell
anything to consumers. And while the FTC found
a handful of instances in which actions by refiners
seemed to meet a technical definition of “gouging,” it pointed out that emergency conditions
mitigated the apparent offenses. “Our investigation
uncovered no evidence indicating that refiners
make product decisions to affect the market price
of gasoline,” the commission said in a summary
of its report. “Instead, the evidence indicates that
refiners responded to market prices by trying to
produce as much higher-valued products as possible, taking into account crude oil costs and other
physical characteristics.”

Sulfur rules shaping
global construction

Tightening specifications for the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuel
are shaping global construction in the
oil and gas industry.
Oil & Gas Journal’s semiannual
Worldwide Construction Update shows
strong activity for sulfur recovery plants
and refinery hydrodesulfurization units.
The update is based on a survey of
refining, petrochemical, LNG, gas processing, gas-to-liquids, sulfur recovery, and pipeline projects. Respondents include operators, engineering
firms, and construction companies.
Compared with the previous
edition of the update, the current
survey shows a slight increase in sulfur recovery projects in engineering
stages as well as a large number of plans
for new and revamped hydrodesulfurization units in several locations (OGJ,
Nov. 20, 2006, p. 20).
Following are examples of key
projects in each category from a much
larger list, details of which appear in
tables available online (see box).

with the addition of a 28,000-b/d distillation unit. The project also will add a
29,000-b/d vacuum unit, 20,000-b/d
fluid coking unit, 11,000-b/d catalytic
reformer, and 20,000-b/d mild hydrocracker. The project is to be completed
in January 2012.
In Brazil, Petrobras is building
a 140,000-b/d delayed coker at its
241,500-b/cd Sao Jose dos Campos
refinery. Toyo Engineering is contractor
for the project. Completion is due in
March 2009.
Shell plans a 150,000-250,000-b/d

Meanwhile, subsidiaries of China
Chemical & Petroleum Corp. (Sinopec),
ExxonMobil Corp., and Saudi Aramco
jointly signed two separate contracts for
a related project to triple capacity at a
Fujian Province refinery (OGJ Online,
Feb. 27, 2007).
The projects seek to meet China’s
rapidly growing demand for oil products and petrochemicals.
One contract is for the Fujian Refining & Ethylene Joint-Venture Project,
which will increase capacity to 240,000
b/d from 80,000 b/d at the refinery in
Quanzhou City. The expanded refinery
primarily will refine and process sour
Saudi Arabian crude. The project also
includes construction of an 800,000tpy ethylene steam cracker, an 800,000tpy polyethylene unit, a 400,000-tpy
polypropylene unit, and an aromatics
complex to produce 700,000 tpy of
paraxylene.
Elsewhere, plastics company Borouge signed a $1.3 billion lump-sum,

turnkey contract with Germany’s Linde
Group and Consolidated Contractors
Co. for the construction of an ethylene cracker, part of a major expansion
project in Ruwais, Abu Dhabi. The 1.5
million-tpy cracker will undergird a tri-

pling of production capacity at the facility to 2 million tpy of polyolefins. The
project also includes a 752,000-tpy olefins conversion unit, two 800,000-tpy
polypropylene plants, and a 540,000tpy polyethylene plant. Completion is
scheduled for 2010.

On March 1st 2007, we dropped the word “Saab” from our brand name of high-precision
radar tank gauging systems from Emerson. The former Saab Rosemount product range
is now called simply Rosemount.
So is this just a matter of “label branding”? Not really. Shifting from Saab Rosemount
to Rosemount is like shifting to top gear – you keep the power, you just move faster.
Because at Emerson, customer-focused progress is something that happens every day.

FTC opposes Western Reﬁning’s merger with Giant
Nick Snow
Washington Correspondent
The US Federal Trade Commission
said it will oppose Western Refining
Inc.’s planned $1.4 billion acquisition of Giant Industries Inc. because it
would significantly reduce competition
in northern New Mexico’s light products market.
The commission unanimously approved a complaint challenging the
transaction on Apr. 10 and cleared the
way for its staff to seek a temporary
restraining order and preliminary injunction in federal district court to halt
the deal while an administrative trial is
held.
Western Refining and Giant Industries immediately issued a statement
saying that the federal agency’s decision
is without basis in law and would be
vigorously challenged in court. A hearing schedule on the matter was to be
determined in the next few days, they
said.
The two independent refiner-marketers compete as bulk suppliers of
22

gasoline, diesel fuel, and other light petroleum products in Albuquerque, Santa
Fe, and elsewhere in northern New
Mexico, according to Jeffrey Schmidt,
director of FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Western’s acquisition of Giant
would eliminate this competition, leading to higher prices of these important
energy products,” he said.
The federal agency noted that Giant
owns and operates two refineries and
adjacent terminals in northern New
Mexico at Bloomfield and Ciniza from
which it supplies bulk gasoline and diesel to New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and
Colorado. The Scottsdale, Ariz., company
also supplies light products to northern New Mexico from its Albuquerque
terminal, FTC said.
FTC said Western operates a single
refinery in El Paso that supplies gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other light
products to Albuquerque, El Paso,
Phoenix, Tucson, and Juarez, Mexico.
The company also is one of two refiners
using the Plains Pipeline to ship light
products from El Paso to northern New
Mexico, it added.

Already concentrated
FTC contends that if Giant is not
acquired by Western, it would soon
increase the supply of gasoline to
northern New Mexico by bringing up
to capacity production at its two area
refineries and that the merger would
prevent this. The combination would
substantially increase concentration in
an already concentrated market and
substantially reduce competition in the
bulk supply of gasoline to northern
New Mexico, it added.
It also contends that Western “has
both the incentive and the means” to
limit gasoline supplies to northern New
Mexico once the acquisition is complete
by diverting some of Giant’s planned
additional supplies for Albuquerque and
Santa Fe to other markets. Western also
could reduce supplies into the area by
shifting some of its current bulk supply
on the Plains Pipeline, FTC said.
Officials of the two companies
expressed surprise at the agency’s action. “This merger will result in more
product being provided to the combined
companies’ customers and is, therefore,

procompetitive. The FTC’s decision demonstrates a fundamental and troubling
lack of understanding about the areas in
which Western Refining and Giant operate, the competitors in those areas, and
the competitive nature of those areas,”
said Paul L. Foster, Western’s president
and chief executive officer.
Fred L. Hollinger, Giant’s chairman
and chief executive officer, noted that
the two companies represent less than
1.5% of the nation’s total refining capacity, and that FTC has approved mergers and acquisitions in the past several
years that have created much larger
refining companies. “The employees of

both companies have spent countless
hours preparing documents in response
to the FTC’s information requests,
and we and our advisors haven’t seen
anything that we believe would serve
as a basis for the FTC to oppose this
merger,” he said.
The companies said FTC has never
suggested the need for divestitures
or other potential remedies, and that
numerous state and trade association officials submitted letters supporting the
merger. They note that the companies
are small, independent refiners; that the
areas in which they operate are highly
competitive and have numerous fuel

supply options; that Western has one
of the industry’s best operations and
its expertise would help ensure more
reliable gasoline and diesel supplies by
improving utilization rates and reducing the risk of unplanned refinery shutdowns; and that the combination would
create a more stable organization.
FTC said the proposed merger,
which was announced on Nov. 13,
2006, violates Section 5 of the FTC Act
and Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as
amended. It said it plans to appoint a

Price-gouging
salvos begin

T

he US summer driving season is
6 weeks away, and the first gasoline price-gouging salvos of 2007
have been exchanged.
At a US Federal Trade Commission conference on energy markets
and competition, Cambridge Energy
Research Associates Inc. Chairman
Daniel Yergin attempted to put concern about gouging in the context of
lessons from the energy crises of the
1970s.
One such lesson, he said, is that
tight supplies and elevated prices
are most effectively relieved when
markets work without government
interference.
“The question the FTC will have to
confront is what this word ‘gouging’
means and whether it’s necessary to
intervene,” Yergin said. “It could look
politically attractive. But to intervene
quickly would simply interfere with
the market’s ability to respond.”
Meanwhile, the American Council
on Capital Formation released its own
study concluding that price-gouging
legislation would do more harm than
good. Former US House members
Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.), who are on ACCF’s
board, suggested that a price-gouging bill simply is an indirect effort to
control prices.

aging refiners and marketers from
securing higher-price supplies from
other sources, it said.
“The fact that the US continues
to import a significant amount of
gasoline from foreign producers
should give great pause to legislators
seeking to impose price-gouging
legislation,” Archer said. “In the event
of a disaster and potential price caps,
foreign producers simply will sell
their products in other countries at
higher prices—ultimately harming
the very consumers the controls were
meant to protect.”
AACF said price-gouging bills,
such as the one recently introduced
by Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.), have
vague criteria for determining when
a violation occurs and ambiguous
definitions of price-gouging, which
would lead to market disruptions
(OGJ Online, Feb. 28, 2007).

Not surprised

In a response to reporters, Stupak
said he was not surprised that AACF,
which he called “an organization
that receives hundreds of thousands
of dollars in funding from Big Oil,”
would produce a study critical of
price-gouging legislation. “Last May,
the FTC examined the actions of
petroleum producers and refiners following Hurricane Katrina and found

produced 20-50 times more water than
crude, which traditionally has been a
problem for the industry. Currently,
each of the oil and gas producing states
making up IOGCC’s membership are responsible for regulating produced water
in accordance with its specific geology
and geography.
US oil and gas operations produce
14 billion bbl/year of water, according
to IOGCC. It pointed out that the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico
produces huge volumes, with only a
small percentage suitable for irrigation.
The Powder River basin in Wyoming
and Montana produces only modest
volumes, but most of this can be used
for irrigation, it said.

Guidebook’s features
Arthur said the guidebook will help
state and federal authorities develop
produced water regulations, which will
encourage beneficial uses while protecting each region’s environment. Oil and
gas producers also can use it to plan
produced water stewardship as they
move into new areas, IOGCC said.
Technology transfer recommendations in the guidebook also may prove
useful as operators try to maintain
economic production from older fields
that have progressed to higher waterto-oil ratios, it added. IOGCC said the
guidebook also will provide operators
a valuable reference as they pursue
unconventional resource plays such as
the Barnett shale or coalbed methane,
which can involve unusually high initial
water production rates.
The guidebook assembles operational parameters of produced water
management strategies, leading edge
water treatment technologies, and water
reduction techniques into a catalogue
of currently available practices. Many of
these already are being used while others require more field trials, according
to IOGCC.
Water quality data from many important US onshore oil and gas basins
also are listed, with case studies providing examples of water stewardship successes and specific lessons to be learned.

Shell to pay $353 million in reserves settlement
Royal Dutch Shell PLC agreed to pay
$352.6 million, plus administrative
costs, to investors outside the US in a
settlement related to a series of reserves
writedowns. Shell admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. Investors had
said the oil and gas major was involved
in improper accounting for oil and gas
reserves during 1997-2003.
The company reclassified reserves
five times in a little over a year (OGJ
Online, Feb. 4, 2005).
In an Apr. 11 news release, Shell
said it agreed to settle with a group of
European and other investors outside
the US. Parties to the settlement involve
institutional investors including Dutch
pension funds led by Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP. Others are organizations

representing individual shareholders in
the Netherlands and the Shell Reserves
Compensation Foundation, a settlement
foundation.
The agreement depends on the
Amsterdam Court of Appeals declaring
the settlement binding for all of the
shareholders that it covers and is subject
to agreed opt-out provisions. Regarding US investors, Shell intends to offer a
proportional settlement to them, pending approval from the US court overseeing the case.
A legal director for Shell told reporters at a news conference in London that
the firm plans to offer US investors an
$80 million settlement.
In addition, Shell is asking the US
Securities and Exchange Commission

to distribute to shareholders the $120
million that Shell paid in 2004 under a
consent agreement resolving the SEC’s
investigation into Shell’s reserves recategorization.
Grant & Eisenhofer PA attorney Jay
Eisenhofer said it was an unprecedented
settlement of a large-scale European
shareholder dispute. His law firm
represented the investor group and the
special purpose foundation. Grant &
Eisenhofer is based in Wilmington, Del.,
and New York
“The scale of recovery and the sheer
collective unity of the investor group
are both unique in a European context,”
Eisenhofer said, noting that the shareholder class involved a broad swath of
public pension funds. ✦

SPE industry groups approve new reserves deﬁnitions
Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)
board members approved a new Petroleum Resources Management System,
ending 2 years of collaboration by SPE,
the World Petroleum Council (WPC),
the American Association of Petroleum
Geologists (AAPG), and the Society of
Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE).
The boards of the other societies also
approved the system following industry
review and comment. Coordinated by
the SPE Oil and Gas Reserves Committee
(OGRC), the new system consolidates
and replaces guidance contained in the
1997 SPE-WPC Petroleum Reserves
Definitions, the 2000 SPE-WPC-AAPG
Petroleum Resources Classification
and Definitions publications, and the
2001 SPE-WPC-SPEE Guidelines for the
Evaluation of Petroleum Reserves and
Resources. The new system also includes
28

the 2005 SPE-WPC-AAPG Glossary.
ORGC Chairman John Ritter, senior
director, worldwide reserves and reservoir engineering, Occidental Petroleum,
said previous guidelines were “not
sufficiently rigorous or encompassing
to meet the requirements of industry
stakeholders due to advancements in
technology, the international expansion of the industry, and the increasing
role of unconventional resources.” The
2007 system builds on industry efforts
to achieve consistency in estimating reserves (OGJ, Oct. 23, 2006, Newsletter).
The old and new resource classification remains basically the same. The
new system explains the classification
in 30 pages, plus a glossary, compared
with a 4-page explanation for the 2000
classification. The new explanation
emphasizes project-based resources and

makes recommendations on various
topics, including aggregating methods
and economic criteria.
The primary updates are:
• Categorization is based on quantities recovered by applying a defined
project to a reservoir base case that
uses the evaluator’s forecast of future
conditions (including prices and costs,
technology available, environmental
standards, fiscal terms, and regulatory
constraints) but permits an option to
use constant conditions.
• Recognition of the growing importance of unconventional resources
(including bitumen, oil shale, coalbed
methane, and gas hydrates).
• A way to enable low, middle, and
high categories of contingent resources.
• An introduction of classification
modifiers. ✦

il and gas were on the agenda
when Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe and Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao met in Tokyo last week seeking
to build “mutually beneficial strategic ties and a steady improvement in
relations.”
Ahead of their talks, Abe praised
Wen’s visit as “a big step forward” toward nurturing the strategic relationship, while Wen said his trip “will
lead to significant achievements and
reflects both sides’ desires.”
Afterward, the two nations issued
separate joint statements on boosting
environmental and energy cooperation. Abe and Wen were also expected
to issue a joint document confirming
collaboration in areas of common
interest.
A joint statement signed by the
two countries’ foreign ministers
featured a commitment of “political will” to fight global warming in
a new climate change framework
beginning in 2013.

The Russian oil—and the East

will transport it—must be a sensitive topic between the two Asian
nations. After all, it was China that
first broached the subject of such a
pipeline with Russia several years ago.

But memory is short and desire
is long, especially in Russia where
a crafty old Kremlin saw—and has
since exploited—competition between Japan and China over supplies
of oil and gas.
Even now, with the ESPO system
under construction, Russia continues to play the two sides against
each other in an effort to extract

China’s Citic Group for $1.9 billion,
produces 45,000 b/d of oil. Karazhanbas oil field is the main asset of Nations
Energy in Kazakhstan.
Balzhanov expects to submit an internal report to KMG EP’s board within
the next couple of months about these
possible acquisitions, he said.
In addition, KMG EP has offered
its parent company, JSC National Co.
KazMunaiGas, $1.07 billion for a 50%
stake in National Kazgermunai LLP.
KMG EP’s shareholders are to vote on
that offer Apr. 12. Balzhanov said it was
pursuing the deal because the company
produces 60,000 b/d of oil from young
fields and has a favorable tax regime.
KMG EP will meet investors in Boston
and New York to discuss the acquisition.
KMG EP also is in early talks with
western majors about asset swaps so the
company can diversity its portfolio, he
added, but he declined to give details.
“With oil price increases and greater
competition in the sector, we don’t
want to be lost in the process,” Balzhanov said. “We want to integrate with
the international oil industry and recognize that we must play the rules of the
game. We have adopted standards and
procedures used by western majors and
adopted a code of corporate governance
to be more transparent.”

Elixir-Gawler merge
Elixier will be the continuing
company, and its headquarters will be
in Perth with an office in London, the
companies said in a news release. The
value of the overall transaction was not
finalized.
Elixir shareholders will represent

PERSONNEL MOVES AND PROMOTIONS

ExxonMobil makes executive appointments
ExxonMobil Corp. has made several executive appointments.
The major has elected M.W. Albers
senior vice-president. He will become
a member of the company’s management committee and assume certain
responsibilities for its upstream businesses.
Prior to his appointment, Albers
held various managerial positions in
development, operations, production,
and engineering. Most recently, he
served as president of ExxonMobil
Development Co. following his role as
EMDC vice-president, Africa, Chad/Nigeria.
Albers also served as executive assistant to ExxonMobil’s chairman and
president at the company’s Irving, Tex.,
headquarters. Prior to that, he served
as Alaska interests manager and production manager for the Western US.
After several assignments in
Texas and New Jersey, in 1991 Albers
transferred to Esso Australia in Melbourne as technical manager and later
became operations manager. He has
been with the company since 1979.
Separately, N.W. Dufﬁn, executive
vice-president of EMDC, was appointed president of EMDC, succeeding
Albers.
Dufﬁn joined Mobil Oil Co. in the
UK in 1979 and has held various
managerial positions in production,
operations, and development.
In 1992, he served as producing

Veneco Pres. Bill Schneider said the
field has seen limited capital in the last
decade. In addition to the fee leasehold,
the field includes a largely undeveloped
offshore portion under lease from the
State of California that is easily reachable from onshore locations.
The other agreement covers the
acquisition of several Texas Gulf Coast

advisor for Europe and Africa based in
Fairfax, Va. In 1995, he transferred to
Aberdeen as operations and northern
North Sea manager and in 1998 was
named senior vice-president, Mobil
Oil Indonesia. After the Exxon-Mobil
merger, Dufﬁn became vice-president,
EMDC, with responsibility for projects
in Russia-Caspian Sea and the Middle
East. He later served as vice-president,
Africa, for ExxonMobil Production Co.

Other moves
Toreador Resources Corp. has made
several appointments within its E&P
division.
The company has appointed Michael
J. Fitzgerald executive vice-president,
E&P.
Previously Fitzgerald served as
Toreador’s senior vice-president, E&P.
He joined the company in late 2001 as
part of the acquisition of Madison Oil
Co., which he cofounded, and served
as vice-president, exploration, since
1992. Before that, he worked for Triton
Energy Corp., Dallas, for more than 10
years. He began his career as an exploration geologist for Texaco Inc. in New
Orleans in 1972.
Edward Ramirez, Toreador’s vicepresident, technical, was promoted to
senior vice-president, E&P, succeeding
Fitzgerald. Ramirez joined Toreador in
2001, also as part of the acquisition of
Madison, which he joined in 1993. He
began his career as an interpretation

fields, including Manvel field in Brazoria County, which is similar to Veneco’s
Hastings field.
Since acquiring Hastings last year,
Schneider said, Veneco has completed
over 100 workovers in the field, increased production by more than 35%,
and added 3 MMboe to proved reserves.

geophysicist with Mobil Oil Corp. in
1974, working primarily on evaluation
of seismic data in East Asia and the
Gulf of Mexico. He joined Triton Energy
Corp. in 1980 and served as a geophysicist and geophysical manager through
1989. After that, he served as an
international marketing manager and
international coordinator at Schlumberger-Geco-Prakla in Houston.
Senior International Geophysicist
William J. Moulton was appointed
vice-president, technical, succeeding Ramirez. Prior to joining Toreador
earlier this year, he was a consultant to
Toreador on the South Akcakoca Subbasin project in the Turkish Black Sea
since mid-2004. He has been working
as a geophysical consultant since 2000.
Prior to that, he served as manager of
advanced imaging services for Geotrace Technologies. He has previously
worked for Snyder Oil Corp. (now Devon Energy Corp.) and Enserch Exploration Co. (now Newﬁeld Exploration Co.)
as an exploration geophysicist.
Bill Barrett Corp., Denver, has
appointed R. Scot Woodall senior vicepresident, operations.
Woodall has more than 20 years
of operational experience, including
drilling, completions, production, and
facilities. He most recently served as
senior vice-president, Western US, at
Forest Oil Corp.
Previously he worked for Amoco
Production Co. as senior petroleum engineer and operations engineer and for
Santa Fe-Synder Corp. as senior operations engineer and, later, as operations
and engineering manager.

“We see the same type of potential in
the Manvel field,” he added, “particularly since both produce from Frio sands
and are very similar geologically.”
Veneco initially plans to return idle
wells to production, enhance the lift
systems, and upgrade the facilities. This
work is expected to yield results similar
to that in Hastings field of increased

daily production and proved reserves.
Schneider said studies may prove
Manvel to be a good candidate for CO2
flooding.
The properties being acquired have
an estimated combined total proved
reserves of 9.7 million boe and proved
plus unproved conventional reserves
of 14.7 MMboe as of Dec. 31, 2006.
Conventional reserves do not include
reserves from tertiary recovery methods. There are 75 wells on the properties, and the two acquisitions should
add over 500 boe/d to Veneco’s average
net production this year.

Perth alliance formed
Conceived by Baraka Petroleum Ltd.,
the Perth-based alliance of companies
also includes Beach Petroleum Ltd. of
Adelaide, Arc Energy Ltd., Adelphi Energy Ltd., and Advanced Well Technologies Pty. Ltd., all of Perth.
They signed a memorandum of understanding to pool resources in seek-

ing, evaluating, and acquiring projects.
A spokesman from Baraka said the
alliance’s creation will allow member
companies to jointly acquire projects of
a magnitude that probably would not be
possible for any of them acting alone.
They will be looking at projects in the
$20-100 million range.
Baraka’s general manager, Mark
Fenton, who originated the idea, says it
will “allow the companies concerned to
punch well above their weight.”
He said it also reduces the overall
risk and pools complementary resources to ensure the most-efficient use
of each company’s financial and human
resources.
The companies have signed confidentiality and noncompete agreement
as well as a joint evaluation agreement.
Unlike a joint venture, no company
is obligated to take part in all or any of
the opportunities that are brought to

the table. The alliance will be flexible,
enabling a sharing of costs through the
various stages of a project, and companies can elect to discontinue participation at various agreed-on points in a
project.
Projects to be contemplated include
production, rejuvenation, development,
near-field exploration, and frontier
exploration.
The alliance will start immediately,
initially evaluating prospects in Africa
where Baraka already is a key player in
Mauritania and Mali.

KMEP to buy terminal
Terms and value of KMEP’s transaction were withheld pending closing,
which is expected in the second quarter, a KMEP spokesman said.
Vancouver Wharves involves five vessel berths on a 139-acre site. Terminal
assets include rail infrastructure, dry
bulk and liquid storage, and material
handling systems. ✦

The East Texas Deep Bossier gas
play is growing fast with some of the
country’s highest-delivering wells and a
lot of room to grow.
Dry gas production from the
Amoruso area alone topped 200 MMcfd
in early April 2007, having doubled
since February 2007 due to the hookup
of several high-rate wells. The Robertson County area’s production rate could
double again before the
end of 2007, one participant said.
Amoruso is considered
one of the five largest US
onshore discoveries in the
past decade.
While drilling to the
Bossier at 14,000-18,000 ft, operators
have seen good potential in shallower
pay zones that have yielded good recoveries throughout the East Texas basin.
These include the Upper Cretaceous
Austin chalk and Woodbine, Lower Cretaceous Georgetown, Rodessa, James,
Pettit, and Travis Peak, and Upper Jurassic Cotton Valley.
Operators expect to ultimately
recover several trillion cubic feet of gas
from the area, but it is too early to be
precise about the total.

East Texas Deep Bossier
gas deliveries expanding

Amoruso prospect
EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. has
operated all but one of the wells drilled
so far at Amoruso, namesake of geologist John J. Amoruso, under its 50-50
agreement with Leor Energy LP, private
Houston independent (OGJ, Oct. 23,
2006, p. 20).
An application has been filed for official designation as Amoruso field.
Leor Energy operated the discovery
well, McCullough-1, completed and
placed on production in late 2005. The
companies had 19 wells producing in
early April, several more were to go on
line through mid-June, and eight rigs
were running.
A well to 16,000 ft takes 75-80
days at an average $8 million to drill
and complete. Crews face hard drilling in complex geology and pressures
of 15,000 psi in the Deep Bossier, said
Guma Aguiar, vice-chairman and chief
executive officer, Leor Energy.
Initial production rates probably average 10-15 MMcfd, but several of the
wells have started out at 45-55 MMcfd,
Aguiar said.
In the last 10 years, he said, only
26 US wells have made 1 bcf of gas or
more in their first 30 days on produc-

tion, and three of the top 10 wells are
in the Amoruso area. Initial production rate averaged 17 MMcfd at the last
13 wells and 22 MMcfd at the last six
wells, Aguiar said.
He expects many wells to yield 80%
of their estimated ultimate recovery
in 3-5 years and have producing lives
of 15-20 years. Leor projects EUR of
2-3 tcf net to its Amoruso area interest
excluding development upside.
Initial data are to be delivered in the
third quarter from a large 3D seismic
survey in Robertson County supported
by Deep Bossier operators EnCana, Leor,
ConocoPhillips, Gastar Exploration Ltd.,
and Chesapeake Energy Corp.
The program for the rest of 2007
calls for offsetting some of Amoruso’s
best wells, working on 640-acre units.
Aguiar estimates that EnCana has drilled
only 1-2% of Amoruso’s 55,000 acres.

Other ﬁelds
Several other fields are under development in the Deep Bossier and shallower formations.
Chesapeake Energy Corp., Oklahoma City, acquired 16.5% of Gastar
and a 33% working interest in Gastar’s
26,000 net acres in Hilltop Resort field,
Leon and Robertson counties (OGJ
Online, Nov. 15, 2005).
Gastar said its 2006 Deep Bossier
reserves increased 86% to 21 bcfe after
production of 2.9 bcfe, but the numbers don’t reflect late-2006 successful
wells, and gross East Texas gas sales
nearly doubled as of Mar. 31 from the
end of 2006.
Log analysis showed that Gastar’s
Lone Oak Ranch-2 well, TD 18,100 ft in
Leon County, cut 36 ft of apparent net
pay in two Bossier sands and was being
cased at the end of March.
Gastar was drilling the Wagner-1 and
Donelson-3 offset wells. Other recent
completions were John Parker-2, Williams-1, and Wildman Trust-2. LOR-2
was in completion, and further production growth was expected in the second
quarter from 22 MMcfd in mid-March,
Gastar said.

ConocoPhillips is working to the
north in the Rainbolt Ranch area.

Expanding play
EnCana and Leor are in early drilling
stages of another project farther east.
Project Houston, aimed at Deep

Bossier gas and the same bailout
zones as in Robertson County, takes in
100,000 gross acres in Angelina, Houston, Nacogdoches, and Trinity counties.
The first well there was disappointing, but the second well has raised high
expectations, Aguiar said. ✦

A pilot project on a
portable variable-speeddrive and load cell for
obtaining counterbalance effect (CBE) data
in the Duri steamflood
Production
improved the sucker-rod
pumping efficiency from
wells that had low lift efficiency caused
by incomplete pump fill.
The Duri steamflood on the Island
of Sumatra in Indonesia is the largest in
the world and currently produces about
200,000 bo/d.
In the field, incomplete or low
pump fill is the most common operational problem experienced especially on ramp-down wells. The low fill
results from having a pump capacity
that exceeds the formation’s ability to
flow fluid into the well or from having excessive gas or steam at the pump
intake.1
Excess pumping capacity creates
shock loading from fluid pound (Fig. 1)
that can cause rod buckling, excessive
pump and tubing wear, unnecessary
friction, and stress fluctuations throughout the entire pumping system.
Shock loading transmitted to the
surface pumping unit may cause vibrations greater than the unit can tolerate.
These vibrations may reduce equipment
run life and magnify the effects of an
unbalance pumping unit and gearbox
overload.

O D U C T I O N

A reduced pump size is least effective
because of its high cost.
A shorter stroke length has minimal
effect on the problem and is limited
because of the fixed number of crank
holes, worn-out holes, and the fact that
many pumping units in Duri have been
set-up for a maximum stroke length.
A combination of a reduced stroke
length with reduced speed, however,
can deliver good results.
Pumping intermittently by placing the unit
on a timer or installing
a pump-off controller (POC) are the usual
methods for reducing
pumping frequency. Both
methods have at least four drawbacks:
1. Intermittent pumping changes
the frequency, but not the pumping
speed. When the unit comes back on,
the loads associated with motion and
fluid pound reoccur.
2. During the downtime, liquid
flows from the reservoir into the wellbore. This flow builds a liquid level in
the casing that creates backpressure on
the producing formation. Maximum
flow occurs with minimum backpressure; therefore, the liquid column
height should be kept as low as possible.
3. Starting the unit from a dead stop
requires more power. The start phase
also induces a shock on the pumping
unit, rods, and pump.

Duri steamﬂood
The Duri field uses only sucker-rod
pumps for lifting fluids because these
pumps can handle high fluid temperatures and sand production.3
In 1995, Duri reached a peak production of 350,000 bo/d and currently

produces about 200,000 bo/d with an
average steam injection of 1.017 million bbl of cold-water equivalent/day.
Most of production comes from Pertama and Kedua sands, with some areas
also developed in the Rindu formation.
Fig. 2 shows that 2,372 out of a total
of 4,200 producing wells or 56.5% of
the wells in the field had low pump fill.
This is because pumping parameters
were not adequately downsized as oil
production declined.
Steam breakthrough is one problem.
In this case, the average wellhead temperature increases rapidly from 200° to
250° F. and is usually accompanied by a
decline in oil production. Also the average reservoir pressure rises to 150–200
psi. High pressure makes lifting of fluid
difficult. This condition requires close
monitoring of producing wells and
numerous changes to maintain normal
or even pump-off conditions.
A pump-off condition means that
the pump lifts all fluid supplied by the
reservoir. This ideal condition occurs

when the producing parameters are
aligned with producing rate and at the
lowest operating fluid level near the
downhole pump intake.
A dynamometer survey can determine the pump-off condition. At Duri,
these surveys are taken once on each
well every 2 months.
The dynamometer survey also measures the pumping system efficiency,
pump fill, and loading of its components. A petroleum engineer can use
these data as a source for optimizing the
pumping system.
There are two kinds of dynamometer surveys: simple dyno and full dyno
analysis.
A simple dyno survey identifies the
mechanical condition of wells and operating fluid level above the pump (Fig.
3). Full analysis measures the pumpingunit balance, structural and gear reducer
loads, rod stress, power consumption,
and component mechanical efficiency.

44

Speed optimization
Each area in the steamflood experiences production phases with rapid
increase within the first few years followed by a slow decline with steam
maturity. To accommodate the declining
phase, the field requires aggressive optimization efforts; otherwise, the field
will incur multiple failure costs related
to overpumping conditions, repairs,
and downtime oil lost.
Three key points in this optimization effort are: dynamometer data for
analysis and candidate selection, application of VSD (variable-speed drive)
for obtaining optimum pump speed at
the production rate, and drive-sheave
size change.
Well candidate selection starts by
grouping wells according to pump fill
that include plots of:
• Very low pump fill wells that are
candidates for pump downsizing but
are outside the scope of this project.
• Medium fill wells that are candidates for a combination of reducing

pump speed and stroke length. These
are in the scope of this project.
• High fill wells that are closely
monitored until reaching fluid over the
pump or pump fill greater or equal to
100%. At that stage, the units need an
increased stroke length or speed so as
not to have an excess fluid level over the
pump.
One can obtain the optimum speed
for producing a well at its highest rate
with software simulation, but this
method is not popular at Duri because
of inaccuracies caused by the many assumptions made.
Variable-speed drive is the most
popular method for adjusting speed to
an optimum level. For the best result,
these drives are installed permanently
on individual wells (Fig. 4). That is ideal
for accommodating rod load changes
to the most suitable speed at anytime.
At Duri, the plans call for installing the
drives on new wells that are still in the
ramp-up phase with high production
rate.

the amperage. The process often needs
repeating until the technician obtains a
satisfactory ampere reading.
This method can be effective if the
unit already is nearly balanced. It may,
however, result in a grossly unbalanced
condition. Because the ammeter cannot
detect whether the alternating current
is leading or lagging the voltage, the
motor current will indicate a positive
value, regardless of whether the motor is regenerating or motoring. One
may mistake regenerative currents for
motoring currents, thereby, severely
unbalanced the pumping unit.4
Repeatedly moving heavy weights
also increases the safety hazard to technicians for the trial-and-error process.
An important consideration is that
the downhole fluid level increases while
the pump is down for this balancing
work. A longer downtown requires
longer times to normalize the load. This
can lead to wrong amp readings if the
load is not stabilized.
Simplified balancing calculations
with a computer program is another
way for balancing a unit. Output of
this simulation includes the distance
and direction that the weights should
move and the needed pounds added or
reduced. The software also contains information of crank and counterweight
data for most common pumping unit
brands.
But at Duri, this software has the
problem that some of the pumping unit
brands and models are not included
in the software, making the software
unusable. The software, furthermore,
requires much downhole and surface
data that may be unavailable.
The best alternative solution at Duri
has been to use a load cell and load
indicator. The load cell installed above
the carrier bar records load changes to
obtain counterbalance effect (CBE) data.
The CBE data is sufficient to move
the counterweights the right distance
during the first adjustment. This is a
much faster balancing process and uses
the CBE data provided in the dyno full
analysis. Compared to the amp probe,

46

the load cell method is much easier,
faster, more accurate, and safer.

Results
The 10-well pilot project provided
the following results:
• 40% pump speed reduction,
averaging from 9.1 to 5.5 strokes/min,
equaled 1.9 million stroke/unit/year
less without reducing production.
• 50% vibration reduction, averaging from 0.68 to 0.32 in./sec to the
safe range below 0.5 in./sec.
• Reduced and balanced gearbox
loading.
• More than 20% reduction in ampere reading, which leads to energy savings and a smaller motor size from Size
3 to 2 on all 10 wells.
• 70% increase in pump fill and
79% increase in fill ratio.
• Reduction in steam interference.
By improving pump fill with a
slower speed, the field reduced fluid
pound and shock loading and friction wear, resulting in reduced failures
and well downtime. In other words,
production did not increase directly by
slowing (optimizing) the speed, but
rather indirectly through reduced well
downtime.
After speed reduction the production
trend followed the long-term decline
(Fig. 5).

WOB of less than 2 tons usually provided maximum air-hammer ROP.
• Bits. Air drilling normally uses
mining bits. Because the tolerance
specifications on mining bits are not as
strict as the API oilfield standards, drift
diameter of the casing becomes more
important. Initially standard mining bits
of the following sizes were used to drill
the first four wells:
• 444.5 mm (171⁄2 in.).
• 314.0 mm (123⁄8 in.).
• 241.3 mm (91⁄2 in.).
Special impact hammer bits have
been designed to drill future wells in
hopes of increasing performance and
minimizing the number of bits. These
bits will be fully diamond-enhanced
with protected gauge and face. The
diameters of the 314-mm bits are also
equipped with enhanced diamond inserts to enhance gauge protection.

from 33-3,032 m.
• Fewer bits used compared to
Puguang 2-2. Only three hammer bits
were used to drill the 2,997 m.
• Good hole stability. Montmorillonite and mudstone formations were
encountered during air drilling. The
hole would have easily collapsed and
enlarged had mud been used. Air drilling eliminated this possibility.
• Low deviation. At most 1 ton was
put on the hammer bit; therefore, the
hole was quite straight. According to
the survey, hole deviation was only 0.8°
at 2,505 m.

the well was reamed, but at that point
large amounts of cuttings were being lifted from the well. The kelly was
drilled down but there was some rotary
table stalling and the well was producing large amounts of cavings. It was
obvious that the hole was collapsing
and the decision was made to mud up
the well.
The foam was blown out of the hole
with air and the well was circulated
with air for another 30 min. Sinopec decided to pull out of the hole to
change the BHA to prepare for mud-up.
After 60 m of drillstring was pulled, a
tight spot was encountered and air was
put back on the hole. After working the

that the subsequent hole collapse could

positive in attempting to air-drill the
Xujiahe formation, including the nuisance gas formations.
Other highlights from drilling PD-3
are:
• The hammer bit used from 703 to
2,252 m is currently the longest bit run
in the field.
• This well was the fastest to reach
2,980 m from start of drilling the intermediate section in the field (10 days).
• Minimal bit use. Only two hammer bits were used to drill the section,
including a bit used in the previous
well.
• Up until the introduction of foam,
hole stability was not an issue.
• Vertical hole was achieved with
deviations less than 0.5° recorded. At
2,900 m, deviation was only 0.25°.

Lessons
There were several key operations
lessons and a few significant changes
from the planned objectives as implemented.
The operator, Sinopec, has successfully employed air drilling on four
wells. The individual well times were
reduced by 20% and air-drilled sections
reduced by 41 days, or 50%.
Using a team-based project approach, the program has maintained
an admirable safety record, given the
environment. To date, there have been
only two minor medical cases and no
lost-time incidents.
The application of water-based foam
in the zones above the main reservoir (mudstones,
siltstones) was not

tions to water is
extreme. The main
issue is that the formation below 2,600
m consists of kaolonite, which is 100%
soluble, and was identified in the core
sample studies.
The only other possible option to
using pure air or N2 would be to drill
these formations with an oil or dieselbased foam system.
Nonproductive drilling time in the
Pugaung field is significant. Unusual
drilling practices and philosophies
caused numerous delays. Adopting API
standards and establishing a best practices culture are essential to achieving
better drilling performance in China.
As much as both parties would like to
adopt a technical limit methodology,
there are more significant issues to be
addressed, which are primarily culture
and role related.
As the team addresses these issues,
however, several opportunities for
further reducing the drilling curve have
been identified:
• Batch drilling sections down to the
reservoir.
• Drilling 26-in. conductor below
the aquifer to 70 m.

• Inspecting drillstring to maintain
API standards.
• Adopting cementing best practices.
There are many other areas that, if
addressed, could result in additional
savings. The team believes drilling and
completing these wells in fewer than
120 days, as opposed to 200, is achievable.

Future of MPD
The sour-gas Feixinguan reservoir
is located between 4,700 and 6,000
m below surface. The geology encountered consists primarily of mudstone,
siltstone, and shale sequences above the
productive reef. This oolitic dolomite
reservoir has a porosity of about 3.65
to 8.71% and permeability that varies
from 0.1 to 126 md. The average initial
formation pressure approximates 7,977
to 8,267 psi (55 to 57 MPa), with a
formation pressure gradient of about
1.09 to 1.18 sg. The reservoir formation temperature is estimated at 120º to
133º C., with an initial gas saturation of
90%. The reservoir has gas productivity
from its original vertical wells between
10 and 20 MMscfd.
This reservoir is deep, high pressured, and extremely sour. From a riskanalysis perspective, these wells would
have the highest risk classification in
the world if UBD were applied. Using
in-house risk assessments and reservoir
screening tools, the Feixinguan reservoir scored poorly as a UBD candidate.
The mean score of +18 from the
reservoir screening tool indicates that
the reservoir is an average candidate for
underbalanced reservoir drilling (in
terms of average horizontal candidacy
and APTi), but the low susceptibility
to damage and low clay content of the
reservoir, in combination with the sour
and high -pressure characteristics, made
it a poor UBD candidate.
In addition, the operations risk-assessment score of 8.3 is extremely high
and there is no record in the world of a
well with such high levels of H2S at this
depth ever having been drilled underbalanced. There are also political factors

to consider, as China has currently
banned UBD operations in sour-gas
reservoirs.
Consequently, MPD methods will
be applied at close-to-balanced conditions to achieve the main objective of
improving ROP in the reservoir. At the
same time, increasing the angle through
the reservoir to about 80° should also
provide further reservoir exposure and
potentially increase productivity.
Drilling ROP drops significantly to
less then 1 m/hr with borehole pressures reaching 10,000 psi. Drilling the
reservoir section currently takes 70 to
90 days. At this moment in the project,
MPD packages are not designed to drill
large productive horizons. Air-drilling
operations are suspended if any potential gas or oil zones outside of the
design parameters are penetrated.
The proposal is to drill the reservoir
with minimal overbalance or at balance, with a fluid designed to minimize
reservoir damage. Optimizing drilling performance through the use of
motors, advanced rock-bit technology,
improved drilling hydraulics and solids
control systems in combination with
MPD well-control equipment, should
allow significantly improved drilling
rates and, at the same time, reduce reservoir damage.
The surface equipment deployed for
MPD operations will ensure that any
H2S produced to surface can be safely
handled with the gas busters and flare
systems. Further improvements in rig
hydraulics and solids control equipment
will also help to reduce drilling times.
Optimizing well cleanup, combined
with optimizing the running of the
completion tubulars, will allow further
overall time savings.

wells, and more than 15 rigs are scheduled for drilling this year. The additional
use of MPD in the non-reservoir sections would result in:
• Increased ROPs and shortened
drilling curves.
• Reduced bit use.
• Enhanced overall drilling performance through reduction of vibration,
drillstring-related problems, and sticking potential.
The most attractive reason to use
MPD systems in the field is to achieve
and support the goal of drilling three
wells/rig/year. The field has a tight delivery schedule, and initial performance
(long drilling times) was creating
doubt that production targets would be
reached.
The initial use of percussion drilling
in the Puguang field produced excellent
results, so far demonstrating that:
• Air drilling is highly successful in
the surface formations.
• Formations down to 3,000 m are
extremely water sensitive.
• The project management road map
works effectively in addressing engineering and operational design.
• The project team approach works
and can be implemented in China with
cooperation of the operator.

Recommendations
Since the initial Puguang wells were
drilled and completed in years per
well, conventional drilling was deemed
uneconomical. Thus, Sinopec decided to
test air drilling and MPD techniques in
an initial two-well trial.
After the trial was successful, extensive air drilling was used in subsequent

acentric factor.
Although many data in the literature
include values of the acentric factor, ω,
the value of ω for petroleum fractions
is not readily available. Even for defined
compounds, there are instances where
experimentally determined acentric factor values are not available.
Vapor pressures, for example, may
not have been measured at a reduced

constants may simply be unavailable.
Under these circumstances, the acentric factor cannot be calculated. One
would therefore have to use estimation
methods for the acentric factor or apply
a general correlation of the acentric
factor.
Although many estimation methods have been proposed, there are
two practical ways to estimate ω from
a single vapor-pressure point. One is
to solve an acentric-dependent cubic
equation of state and the other is to use
a generalized vapor pressure equation.
Both methods are lengthy and tedious
procedures.

Permitting,
opposition

The US government has slowly but progressively acted
to streamline the permitting process for
LNG terminals since 2002, primarily
through the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission and the US Coast Guard.
FERC eliminated open-season
requirements in 2002, giving developers clearer incentive to invest in LNG
terminals, and progressively asserted its
authority in determining facility siting.
FERC ruled in December 2002 that the
proposed Hackberry (La.) LNG import
terminal could be built without complying with the open-access requirements
that had been strictly applied to all parts
of the gas transmission chain previously
as part of ensuring open competition in
the deregulated gas market.
The Hackberry decision has encouraged proposals to build new receiving
terminals by removing the risk that
potential developers might lose some of
their built capacity by having to offer it
to third-parties at market rates.
Moves in September 2004 sought
to make FERC a one-stop LNG facilities

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and
new FERC regulations to implement
both the act and maritime safety and
security processes recommended by
the Coast Guard, cleared away many
potential obstacles and delays impeding approval of, and investment in, LNG
terminals. But they also require project

These projects will help the US diversify its fuel supply by tapping global
LNG markets. Expanding LNG import

Worldwide, well over 50% of all pipelines use
coatings which shield (block) cathodic
protection currents if disbondment occurs.
If you specify corrosion coatings with solid
polymeric backings (shrink sleeves, tapes,
and most multilayer systems) on pipelines
with CP, the high dielectric backing can
block your protective CP current. This can
happen if and when the coating disbonds
from the pipe and water reaches the
disbonded area.
Cathodic shielding is a serious problem and a
documented problem. Since the late 80’s there
is a large body of published research on
shielding. Much of this research can be seen on
our website.
Corrosion coatings which permit the passage
of cathodic protection currents to water under
disbonded areas are called “fail/safe” coatings.
In other words, if the coating fails, your
cathodic protection current can keep your
pipeline safe.
Two types of corrosion coatings are proven to
allow the passage of protective CP currents.
One of these proven “fail/safe” coatings is FBE.
The other proven “fail/safe” corrosion coating
is Polyguard RD-6. We have sold RD-6 since
1988, so there are thousands of installations.
We know of no project where serious corrosion
or SCC has been found under the rarely seen
disbonded areas of RD-6.

of the fastest rates in the US over the
past 10 years. Natural gas is now the
leading source of fuel for electric generation in New England. New England’s
monthly load factor for gas pipelines
approached 90% over the 3 mid-winter months this year, indicating little
redundant capacity on gas pipelines
during peak periods. If New England’s
economy is to grow at the 1%/year
forecast by the Energy Information
Administration, much of that growth
will be driven by increased power and
therefore gas consumption, placing
more pressure on an already strained
gas supply network.

Energy NA’s Everett terminal in Boston
make only 15% of New England’s gas
supply.
Because the region lacks any gas
storage, however, regasified LNG makes
up 25% of the gas delivered on a peak
winter day. Its tight supply situation,
lack of underground gas storage, and
limited existing LNG infrastructure
cause the New England gas market to
experience significantly higher wholesale and residential natural gas prices
than the rest of the US.

From the Subscribers Only area of

Global warming
melts separation
of power in US
Can anyone guess which branch of the
US government produced the following
paragraph?
“A well-documented rise in global temperatures has coincided with a signiﬁcant
increase in the concentration of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere. Respected scientists believe the two trends are related.
For when carbon dioxide is released into
the atmosphere, it acts like the ceiling of

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

a greenhouse, trapping solar energy and
retarding the escape of reﬂected heat. It is
therefore a species—the most important
species—of a ‘greenhouse gas.’”
Glosses make this statement typical of
arguments for urgent responses to global
warming. The paragraph thus might seem
to belong to some political document, most
probably issuing from Congress or, perhaps, an agency of the Executive Branch.
But no, the Judicial Branch served up
the delicacy. It appears atop the Supreme
Court’s Apr. 2 opinion that CO2 should be
subject to regulation as a pollutant under
the Clean Air Act.
Supreme Court justices are busy people.
Their spacious minds brim with legal
knowledge and arguments about the many
complex cases awaiting their decisions. To
them, it probably seems unimportant that
observed warming hasn’t always coincided
with the Industrial Age’s CO2 build-up, that
temperature averages in fact fell for many
years while the gas concentration rose.
The justices also might consider it
inconsequential that CO2, a life-sustaining compound of which human activity is
hardly the only source, is less important as
a greenhouse gas than water vapor.
Yet pesky trivialities like these, which
supporters of aggressive CO2 regulation
ignore, lie at the center of arguments over
what to do about global warming.
If average temperature and CO2
concentrations haven’t changed together
consistently, for example, the gas build-up
can’t account for all observed warming. It
might therefore be impossible to inﬂuence
global average temperature much with cuts
in emissions of a relatively small portion of
one gas among several. Controversy about
this, notwithstanding senseless talk about
scientiﬁc “consensus,” is lively.
And their honors have taken one side in
a political issue of the type that the Constitution seems at pains to reserve for other
branches of government.

US gas storage near record high
The US winter heating season ended Mar. 31 with 1.569 tcf of natural gas still in
underground storage, “the second highest level ever,” said Robert S. Morris, Banc of
America Securities LLC, New York.
That’s down 127 bcf from the same period a year ago but 337 bcf above the 5year average. The Energy Information Administration reported the injection of 58 bcf
of gas into US underground storage in the week ended Mar. 30, vs. withdrawals of
22 bcf the prior week and 10 bcf during the same period in 2006. The latest update
of gas in storage “does not appear to reﬂect any overall change in domestic supplydemand fundamentals,” Morris said. The Nov. 1-Mar. 30 heating season was 2.5%
warmer than the 10-year average, he said.
In a separate monthly report, EIA said total US “organic” (excluding, or adding
back, hurricane-related shut-ins) gas production declined 0.7% sequentially in January but increased 0.5% from year-ago levels. “January production was negatively
impacted by well ‘freeze-offs’ in the Midcontinent and Rockies due to ice storms,”
Morris said. EIA revised its 2006 production estimate to a 3% increase from year-ago
levels (1.6% organic) vs. a previous estimate of a 3.3% increase. “Our models still
yield a 2.4% year-over-year increase (0.7% organic) for last year. Thus, our long-held
proprietary models continue to yield slightly lower growth estimates vs. the EIA’s
projections but indicate similar trends,” Morris said.
“Our 2007 production growth forecast is still just over 3% (1.6% organic), with
nearly one third of the organic increase due to the start-up of the eastern deepwater
Gulf of Mexico Independence Hub in the third quarter, which may in fact come on
line sooner or ramp up quicker than we are now modeling,” said Morris.
Captives released
After nearly 2 weeks of tough talk, Iran’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad suddenly decided to release 15 captive UK naval personnel as an Easter holiday “gift”
to the British people. Eight British sailors and seven marines ﬂew to London from
Tehran Apr. 5. They were seized Mar. 23 in the Persian Gulf by naval units of Iran’s
Revolutionary Guard after the British personnel ﬁnished inspecting a merchant ship
for possibly smuggled goods just outside the Shatt al-Arab waterway dividing Iraq
and Iran.
Iran claimed the inspectors trespassed into its territory and threatened to put
them on trial. However, UK ofﬁcials said data from a position-tracking satellite prove
the British personnel were 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi waters when they were illegally seized.
Neither side admitted wrongdoing. Ahmadinejad announced the release after ﬁrst
pinning a medal on the commander of the Iranian unit who took the prisoners. Even
as the captives returned home, British Prime Minister Tony Blair called for continued
international pressure on Iran, blaming elements of the Iranian government for backing militants in Iraq, where four British soldiers and a translator were slain in an ambush hours before the freed crew touched down. The UK, like the US, is a permanent
member of the United Nations Security Council, which is still trying through trade
sanctions to force Iran to postpone its nuclear program.
Oil stocks and prices
The May contract price for benchmark US crude fell Apr. 4 in the New York market
following Ahmadinejad’s decision to release the captives. The loss was limited,
however, by the EIA’s report that US gasoline inventories fell for the eighth consecutive week, down 5 million bbl to 205.2 million bbl in the week ended Mar. 30. That
draw “was larger than expected, but it includes a correction for a report mistake in
[the previous] edition when the stock draw came out less than expected,” said Olivier
Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix GMBH, Zug, Switzerland. “The correction
does not change anything to the current stock level, but we need to keep in mind
that when adjusting for the correction we are drawing only at half the weekly pace
suggested by [the latest] report,” he said.
However, Eitan Bernstein at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc., Arlington, Va.,
said: “This should serve to remind investors that the reﬁned product supply-demand
balance remains tight, and with gasoline inventories currently 3% below comparable
year-ago levels and the summer driving season less than 60 days away, the outlook
for reﬁning margins remains very favorable, in our view.” Commercial US crude
inventories registered a larger-than-expected gain of 4.3 million bbl to 332.7 million
bbl during the same period. Distillate fuel stocks were unchanged at 118 million bbl.
